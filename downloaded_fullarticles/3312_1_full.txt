              <p>When Draco’s cover is blown during a deep undercover operation and the Ministry is compromised, Ron takes Draco to the only safe place he can think of—Potter. Hiding out with a taciturn Harry Potter, who has been missing from the Wizarding World for almost two decades after a shocking fall from grace, is nothing like Draco thought it would be. Draco has to navigate dealing with this Potter while being hunted by Dark wizards and wanted by extremists in the Ministry. When things take a turn for the worse, Draco has to decide whether he's going to keep running or find a way to protect the world and the people he cares about most.</p>

      <p>Please do not repost my fic or put it on GoodReads.</p>
<p>Written for Harry/Draco Big Bang 2018. </p>
<p><b>Author's Notes:</b><br/>I can't thank the mods enough for putting together this enormous and almost year-long fest! Writing a fic this long was a monumental challenge, but I had so much fun doing it and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to participate. The mods were all rock stars and did a fabulous job organising and running this fest.<br/>Many, many thanks to my incredible beta, <a href="https://maesterchill.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Maesterchill</a>. I appreciate every minute you put into this beast, your comments and suggestions and corrections were so incredibly helpful and insightful. I can't thank you enough for your patience, dedication, and willingness to work with our schedules and my insanity.<br/>Thanks to my wonderful artists, <a href="https://saulaie.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Saulaie</a> and <a href="http://prettypurpleflower.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">prettypurpleflower</a>, for their beautiful artwork, and for all the time they put in to illustrating this fic. It was a pleasure to work with both of you!<br/>Special thanks to the lickable Saulaie, who helped me so much by being a great listener, a great shoulder to cry on, and the best support I could have asked for. Getting to know you, and to get an offering of such great ideas and advice has been the most rewarding outcome.</p>
<p>This fic was inspired in part by the song I'll Surely Die by the Rubens. Listen to it here on <a href="https://youtu.be/g5R4NPe08Sg" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> and here on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/505hcmko3QLhVyuQNGOdDW" rel="nofollow">Spotify</a>.<br/>The title is from Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.</p>
<p>I hope you'll enjoy reading this! Please check the chapter notes for warnings.</p>
<p><b>Artist's Notes:<br/></b><br/><b>Saulaie —</b> Gotta thank the mods again for their work, and for assigning me to another brilliant fic and writer. It was a delight to draw for this, and to read it, and to wait for the updates, and to yell at Korlaena a lot in between those things. She satisfied my long haired, bearded, older!Harry needs and I can't thank her enough for that. There were obviously so many amazing scenes to choose from, and the 2 I finally went for are beautiful examples of how well Korlaena writes growing love and tenderness between H &amp; D, and I truly hope I managed to capture that in what I did. ENJOY!</p>
<p><b>prettypurpleflower —</b> Working with korlaena to get my painting together has been a wonderful journey. From the first second I was determined to do something with the bike theme of the story, even though and also because I have no clue about bikes. My piece went through a lot of changes since that first idea and I hope the end result will make you guys happy. Last but not least, thank you to korlaena for the amazing story and the mods for the fest!</p>

</p><p>“I was born free, and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside.”<br/>
- Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Don Quixote</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>The crack as they land echoes through the empty courtyard, seeming too loud in the stillness of the night. Draco’s not sure where Ron has Apparated them to—they’ve hardly spoken a word since escaping the raid. </p><p>He releases Ron’s forearm and casts his gaze around their surroundings. It’s not any place that Draco recognises—it seems Muggle, based on the cars and the shopfronts. </p><p>The area is diffused in fog, the only light coming from street lamps and moonlight which paint the stone buildings and walkways a cold, dark grey. The town seems unusually still in this late hour, and the strangeness of it sets his nerves on edge. </p><p>Draco can hear noises of the city in the distance, but the loudest sound is his own racing heart, pounding like the drums of a warship in his ears. Ron and Draco are panting from the exertion of the fight they just escaped. Draco is trying to quiet his breath and let his heart rate go down, though his mind is racing and his eyes are darting about for any sign of danger. </p><p>Ron is still as he surveys the area. He looks over to Draco and gives a short nod, which Draco returns, and they move forward together, their pace fast but measured. </p><p>The heels of his shoes click against the cobblestones and echo ominously around the brick and stone buildings that surround them. Draco tightens his grip on his wand, feeling reassured by the weight of it in his palm, and he keeps his gaze constantly moving as Ron leads them down the unfamiliar streets. </p><p>A warm trickle of blood runs behind his ear and down his neck, and Draco wipes it away absently. He knows Ron is hurt too, but there’s no time to stop and assess any injuries. The adrenaline surging through his veins keeps the pain at bay and his feet moving.</p><p>Before long they turn down a narrow street with a line of cars parked along one side. Ron slows their pace and eyes each car in turn, then seems to make up his mind and stops beside one. They both turn their heads to look up and down the street, and Ron discreetly taps his wand to the Muggle vehicle. He glances at Draco and jerks his head toward the car in silent gesture. </p><p>Draco purses his lips but moves around the other side and gets into the passenger seat. The car feels cramped and alien to Draco, and he levels an unimpressed look at Ron, who looks even more cramped than Draco feels, what with his long limbs bunched up and his head nearly touching the ceiling.</p><p>“Harder to track,” Ron says and shrugs by way of explanation, breaking their cautious silence now that they are in an enclosed space. </p><p>“Are you even capable of handling this Muggle contraption?” Draco asks, watching as Ron somehow makes his seat move down and back and wrangles some strange strap about himself. </p><p>“Put your seatbelt on,” Ron directs instead of answering.</p><p>“My what?”</p><p>“Your seatbelt,” Ron says and points, “by your shoulder.”</p><p>Draco huffs but he turns to see the same sort of strap Ron had just dealt with, and it extends out when he pulls at it. He glances to Ron, but Ron is looking up and down the street through the windows, surveying the area again. </p><p>Draco holds the strap out, not exactly sure how one is meant to put it on, and then settles for holding it against himself. Ron is busy tapping his wand to the car, which makes it create a low growling noise that fades to more of a hum. He has no earthly idea if this device is supposed to make such a noise, but Ron seems satisfied and only then turns his attention back to Draco. </p><p>A crease appears on his forehead, and then Ron is reaching over for the strap Draco is still holding uselessly. He grabs at a buckle on it and clicks it into something next to Draco’s seat, and Draco watches and lets him do all this with a small frown. </p><p>“You never answered whether you know how to work this thing,” Draco points out dryly. </p><p>Ron smiles at him, though Draco can tell that it’s strained, and he says breezily, “ ‘Course I do. I drove one to school second year, din’ I?”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Draco says and rolls his eyes. “Drove it straight into the Whomping Willow, if memory serves.”</p><p>“And it was a good learning experience,” Ron concludes as he wiggles a shaft between their seats. </p><p>The car lurches forward and then stops abruptly, making both of them jerk forward and get stopped by the seatbelts. Now Draco thinks he understands their purpose. </p><p>Draco sighs and closes his eyes as Ron continues to work the strange components of the vehicle. Somehow, they end up moving backward and then forward, and Draco doesn’t open his eyes until he feels that they are moving steadily down the street.</p><p>“Merlin help me,” Draco mutters. “Out of all the Aurors of course I’d get stuck with a foolhardy Gryffindor who seems to think that <i>crashing</i> a vehicle is proof of being able to operate it competently.”</p><p>The words are light and humorous, a contrast to every one of Draco’s nerves that are currently on high alert. The familiar comfort of teasing is needed to release some tension and add levity to the heavy situation they have found themselves in.</p><p>The corner of Ron’s mouth moves up in a brief smile, barely there and gone again with hardly enough time to notice. </p><p>Outside of their current situation, Ron seems older and more careworn than he last remembers. Draco has been deep undercover for the last three years and it’s been a while since he has had a face-to-face with his Auror handler. </p><p>Much as he likes to complain, the truth is that Draco is happy he was assigned to Ron. It was difficult at first, but they found a rhythm through the years and tonight has only served to prove once again that Draco can trust Ron with his life. </p><p>When it’s apparent Ron is not going to respond and seems occupied with driving, Draco lets it go with the small hope that Ron won’t crash them into a tree. </p><p>Ron’s forehead is creased again and occasionally he fusses with the shaft between them, doing something with his legs as well. Draco watches how his eyes dart out the window in front of them and in circuits around the mirrors on the car. </p><p>At this late hour, all of the shops and businesses are closed, and the first sign of other life is a car driving past them in the opposite direction. At this point Draco would like to think that the chances of having been followed are low, but he hasn’t survived these long years without preparing for the worst. </p><p>Draco looks out the window for several minutes in silence, watching the town pass by, the other cars on the road, and the occasional pedestrian. The seats seem to be leather and the car is too chill for Draco’s liking. There was no time to grab his heavier cloak before Ron was Apparating them out of the fight. Draco scarcely had time throw a set of robes over his pyjamas, grab his emergency kit and slip his boots on before the house had erupted into shouting and the bright flashes of curses. </p><p>Draco shivers and then raises his wand to cast a Warming Charm. Ron’s hand shoots out and he holds it flat above Draco’s wand to stop him. </p><p>“Don’t. It was Damian’s men what attacked you. If he’s got access to the Auror department they might know about the tracker we have on your wand.”</p><p>Draco sighs and puts his wand down. He doesn’t put it away, because if they do get attacked again he wants it ready and in hand, tracker be damned at that point. He settles for grumbling, “It’s too bloody cold in this damned thing.”</p><p>Ron grunts, presumably in agreement. “The car can make heat. It’s one of these buttons, I’m not sure,” he mutters and starts fiddling with the panel of buttons in front of them. Draco bats his hand away irritably. If he’s going to deliver them anywhere safely he won’t to do it while not watching where they’re going. </p><p>“I told you that tracker was the very worst idea,” Draco spits with a bit more venom than he intends to.</p><p>“And I told you that there’s no choice in it,” Ron snaps back. “Good job we had it too, or I wouldn’t have been able to save your arse every damn—”</p><p>“<i>—FOR THE GODS, FADING RESISTANCE, DRAINING THE WEAKNESS—</i>” </p><p>Draco yelps, and both he and Ron jump when the music blares inside the car, growling at them at top volume. Draco scrambles to hit the buttons before he manages to push the one that turns the music off. </p><p>Draco’s heart is in his throat, thrumming wildly. He takes large gulps of breath, trying to calm the heart rate he had only just got back to resting. </p><p>Ron looks over and Draco meets his wide-eyed gaze. There’s a split second where neither of them say anything, and then both of them break out into a loud peal of laughter. Draco holds his stomach with one hand and his face with the other, his whole body shaking. Ron wheezes and wipes his eyes, trying to pay attention to the road and fight the wide grin splitting his face and the laughter rolling through his body. </p><p>“Mother of Merlin, what in the <i>world</i> do these Muggles listen to?” Draco huffs out, which starts them both laughing again shortly. </p><p>Ron darts another quick, amused look at Draco and then shakes his head. </p><p>“If I ever step another foot into one of these things again it will be too soon,” Draco says. “Really? Stealing a Muggle vehicle? Why on Earth, Weasley?” </p><p>Ron smiles and chuckles, answering lightly, “You know we can’t Floo. And it’s not as if we have brooms. And I don’t want to keep Apparating if they can track our wands.”</p><p>Draco gives a noncommittal hum in reply, quiet for a moment, and then asks, “Where are you even taking us?”</p><p>Ron’s hands tighten around the wheel and his mouth pinches before he answers, “Somewhere safe.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center><p>It’s taking much longer to get to their destination than Draco would have expected. Mainly because Ron is taking a long, winding path. </p><p>At first Draco had wondered if Ron was lost and if he was even capable of navigating the Muggle cities. After the second time he’d noticed Ron go three times around the same block, he had concluded that Ron was actually checking to make sure they weren’t being followed. </p><p>Draco notices when Ron watches the mirrors a little too closely, seeming suspicious of another car behind them, but nothing ever comes of it. Even if the idea of wizard pursuers coming in the form of a Muggle vehicle is completely absurd, they hadn’t each lived for forty-plus years without being as cautious as they are.</p><p>Draco is exhausted, mentally and physically, but he wouldn’t be able fall asleep even if he wanted to. They make some small talk during the ride, and Draco figures out how to get the car to create heat and play music that isn’t what Ron calls ‘Death Metal’.</p><p>After the first few attempts at getting Ron to divulge where they are going with no success, Draco gives up on trying to discern their destination. They go through several small farming towns, and Draco has very little idea of where they end up, only than that it’s Muggle and in the country. Miraculously, they make the drive without Ron crashing them into a tree.</p><p>By the time Ron pulls the car over and stops completely, the sun has recently risen, and the sky is changing from oranges and pinks into a light blue. They had passed through the main street a short while ago and seem to be on the edge of the town, next to what looks to be an automobile repair shop connected to a house and set by a grove of trees apart from neighbouring houses. The words ‘BLACK BIKES &amp; REPAIRS’ sit atop the open garage filled with motorbikes, which Draco can see through its two open garage doors. </p><p>“Where are we?” </p><p>“Holmbridge. Stay here,” Ron says, pinning Draco with a stern look. “I need to talk to him first.”</p><p>“Who, exactly?” Draco asks impatiently.</p><p>Ron purses his lips and dodges the question with a sighed, “Just stay put.”</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes, but he stays in the car as Ron gets out. He watches as Ron looks around the area, then walks across the street and up to the house. He goes to knock on the front door but is waylaid by the appearance of a man in the garage, standing up from behind a motorbike that had hidden his presence. </p><p>It makes Draco feel ill at ease, the sudden appearance of him. At this distance and angle all Draco can make out is a middle-aged looking man with dark skin, long black hair that reaches just past his broad shoulders, and a short beard. </p><p>Draco squints at them in suspicion as Ron pulls the stranger into a tight hug and pats his back. They start to talk, and Draco watches their interactions, but the man’s body language is minimal and hard to read. He seems vaguely familiar, but Draco can’t get a good enough look to place him.</p><p>Sitting and waiting is not something Draco is very good at. He feels trapped and exposed, sitting in the metal Muggle box. It sets his teeth on edge, but Ron has asked him to stay so that’s what he does. He trusts Ron, and it doesn’t even hurt anymore to admit to it.</p><p>Draco pulls his emergency kit out of his robe pocket, a nice little buckskin pouch with an Extension Charm that Hermione had gifted him several Christmases ago. He roots around in it until he finds what he’s looking for and pulls out one of his Extendable Ears. </p><p>Espionage has been Draco’s game going on fifteen years now, and if Weasley thinks he can have some secret conversation about him with a stranger, then he has seriously misjudged his partner. Draco will stay put alright, but he won’t be left out.</p><p>Over the years Draco has added some of his own charms to the Extendable Ears, Disillusioning them and making them easier to manipulate. He cracks his door open and slips the ear out of it, twisting and tapping the end of it to make it grow and wiggle its way across the street into the garage. </p><p>Once it seems close enough, Draco puts the end near his ear and holds his breath to listen.</p><p>“—won’t be for long, I swear. You know I wouldn’t involve you if there were any other option, but I think the Auror office is compromised, which means our safehouses are compromised,” Draco can hear Ron’s pleading voice explaining to the man. </p><p>The dark stranger says nothing but nods his understanding. </p><p>Ron continues in a relieved rush, “A week, tops. I just need to explain the situation, show them Draco’s file, show them our sting operation. It’s a huge mistake on their part, probably some young little twit trying to impress Dami—er, trying to make an impression. For now, I just need them not to lock up my star player with a bunch of wizards who just found out he’s been grassin’ on them.”</p><p>“It’s fine, Ron. He can stay,” the stranger finally speaks. He turns his head towards the car and the light catches on a pair of glasses.</p><p>It’s only years of training that keep his face carefully clear of the shock that just shot through his body like a bolt of lightning—no pun intended. He may not have recognised him right off, but Draco would know that voice anywhere. </p><p>Ron has taken him to Harry sodding Potter.</p><p>Draco is pretending to be leaning his head in his hand against his door in boredom, but really he’s watching them out the corner of his eye and cupping the end of the Extendable Ear next to his own ear. Draco holds his carefully posed nonchalance as if his brain hadn’t just Bombarda-ed itself. </p><p>Everyone knows Ron and Potter were best of friends as children, and Draco had wondered if Ron might still be in contact with him, but where Draco prides himself on seeing every piece on the board and therefore never being surprised, he had truly never seen this coming. </p><p>Never in a hundred lifetimes would Draco ever expect to see or even hear of Harry Potter again. The man had completely disappeared from Wizarding society nearly two decades back after killing a suspect, being ousted as a potions addict, and then shamefully tried by the Wizengamot and discharged from the Aurors. </p><p>No one has seen or heard from him since. Except perhaps Ron and Hermione. They must be the only witch and wizard who know where Harry Potter has been hiding himself all these years. </p><p>Out of curiosity, Draco had poked around the subject with Ron and Hermione a few times years ago, but they had both seemed convincing enough when they said they didn’t know where he was. </p><p>When Draco is done having his mind blown, he notices that Ron is speaking again, this time in a softer tone.</p><p>“—be careful. Don’t…” Ron trails off with a sigh, then continues, “Don’t get too attached.”</p><p>Potter? Attached to Draco? Not bloody likely.</p><p>After a moment Ron speaks again, his tone gentle but firm, “I’m sorry for shoving this on you, but I don’t want you getting involved. Just a week and then none of this is your problem, okay?”</p><p>“Do what you need to. Don’t worry about me,” Potter reassures Ron, though his tone falls flat to Draco’s ears. </p><p>They seem to have some sort of silent communication happening between them, and then Ron is pulling Potter in for another quick hug. Draco quickly reels the ear back in, keeping his hands low to hide their activity, and carefully pulls his door shut right as Ron is turning to make his way back to the car.</p><p>The driver’s side door opens with a squeak. Ron drops down into the seat and shuts the door behind him. He turns to Draco, his expression like that of a soldier steeling himself to march into battle.</p><p>“You mean to strand me here with Potter,” Draco accuses before he can get a word out.</p><p>Ron’s eyebrows jump up briefly, seeming surprised that Draco has already figured out the identity of his custodian, and Draco scoffs.</p><p>“I have eyes, Weasley,” he snaps, despite the fact that he hadn’t actually recognised Potter at first glance. He looks quite different than Draco last remembers.</p><p>The surprised expression on Ron’s face fades back to its normal hard determination. “It won’t be for long, a few days, a week at most. Just give me enough time to clear up the utter shitshow Damian’s Dogs made of our operation.”</p><p>Draco folds his arms over his chest and sets his own stubborn expression. “You said you were taking me somewhere safe. How can I trust that he’s stable enough to not kill me in my sleep?”</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with him!” Ron shouts so fiercely that Draco jumps a little and has his wand in his grip before he even knows he’s going for it.</p><p>After the shock fades, Draco glares at Ron, not at all impressed with his outburst. Ron sighs and runs a hand over his short hair. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he quickly apologises. “Just...you trust me, yeah?”</p><p>Draco runs his tongue over his top row of teeth and huffs a short breath out his nose. “Merlin help me, but I do.”</p><p>“Then trust me on this,” Ron says, clearly fighting to keep his voice calm as he continues, “This is the absolute safest place I could take you. And I wouldn’t ever bring anyone here if <i>I</i> didn’t trust them implicitly.”</p><p>Draco purses his lips and furrows his brow, but he nods his understanding. This is Harry Potter, after all, the fallen hero no one has seen in nearly twenty years. It is a show of trust on all sides for Draco to even be here. </p><p>“If we rip each other apart, then on your head be it,” he can’t stop himself saying. </p><p>“He won’t hurt you,” Ron emphasises again. “There’s nothing wrong with him.”</p><p>“Everyone has something wrong with them,” Draco says dryly.</p><p>Ron sighs and shakes his head, but it’s in an agreeable sort of way. “He’s not—I mean that he’s not <i>mad,</i> he’s…” Ron trails off and looks at Draco, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. “How much of that did you hear?” he asks, jerking his head to gesture toward where he and Potter had been standing.</p><p>“Enough,” Draco drawls and smirks.</p><p>Ron throws a hand out irritably, then closes his eyes and rubs his forehead. When he looks back up at Draco, his expression is resigned. “Just—try not to be a git, okay? For me? You’re only staying here based on my good word.”</p><p>“Well, I <i>suppose</i> if it’s for you…” Draco sighs, drawing out the vowels and using his inflection to express what a hardship this will be for him. He’s being sarcastic, but they both know that this <i>will</i> be a hardship. </p><p>They may be in their forties and well out of Hogwarts, but he and Potter had never gotten along. Draco resigns himself to the situation because he has no other choice. </p><p>Besides, he’s been charming and beguiling Death Eaters, Dark witches and wizards and all of the most dangerous sort for much of his adult life. Handling Harry Potter for one week should be no problem. </p><p>A bit of worry has snuck onto Ron’s face and Draco waves off his concern. </p><p>“Relax, Ron. I’ll be fine. I’ll expect to hear from you soon.” Draco raises an eyebrow at him to punctuate the importance of that last bit, and Ron gives a brief smile and a nod in response. Draco hesitates for a second, then he adds, “Be careful.”</p><p>Ron smirks and shakes his head. “What are they going to do? Lock up the Head Auror?” </p><p>Draco sees through his bravado. After the battle they just escaped, Draco’s not sure if there aren’t any boundaries Damian and the Anti-Dark Arts squad he runs won’t cross. The Huntsmen, they call themselves. More like hunting dogs, rabid as they are, Draco thinks bitterly. </p><p>Draco fumbles a bit with the seatbelt but manages to free himself and step out of the car, grateful to finally be outside the stuffy Muggle Death Trap and be on his own two feet again. He watches Ron turn the thing around and drive away, and then Draco turns to face his fate. </p><p>Across the street Potter is standing there, facing him, watching him, and Draco fights back a shiver crawling up his spine. Something about it reminds him of those Western movies Ron likes, of the good guy and the bad guy facing each other down for a duel at dusk. Only it’s morning, and there are no good guys or bad guys in this story—just a couple of aging men.</p><p>Draco shakes off the imagery and moves forward. Goosebumps rise on his arms as he crosses the street and strides up to Potter.</p><p>“Potter,” he greets and starts to extend his hand out when he notices the soiled state of Potter’s hands. He quickly changes course and clasps his hands behind his back, giving Potter a simple nod instead.</p><p>He knows by the way Potter’s eyes darted down to catch the movement that he is aware of Draco’s aborted handshake, but Draco refuses to feel badly for it.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Potter greets in turn and doesn’t offer his hand. His expression is something flat and neutral that Draco can’t read anything into. </p><p>Now that he’s up close, Draco can get a much better look at the man.</p><p>Potter looks a mess—wild, unkempt hair hanging just below the crest of his shoulders, face full with an untrimmed beard that must be at least a couple months worth of not shaving. He is in some sort of blue bodysuit that’s splattered with old grey stains and fresh black smudges. His fingers are covered in the same mysterious black substance, as well as a red rag he’s wiping them with, though the rag is just as blemished and seems to be doing little more than spreading the mess around.</p><p>Gone is the knobbly, underfed youth of Draco’s memory, and in its place stands a fully fleshed out man. The exact shape of his figure is hard to determine by the workman’s bodysuit, but Draco can tell by the way he fills it out, the way it stretches over his shoulders, that he’s far better built than Draco would have imagined.</p><p>His face has weathered some with age, his skin looks even darker and richer than Draco remembers, no doubt from years spent in the sun. The creases around his mouth seem deeper, and crow’s feet decorate the sides of his eyes. Most of his hair is still that stark, jet black, but silver has crept up his sideburns and temples, and into two streaks of his beard that frame the bottom of his chin.</p><p>The one unchanged factor is those sharp, moss green eyes behind round glasses. Draco watches them move across him, seeing when they stop and note the blood on Draco’s neck and collar. Potter’s flat expression is unchanged by this discovery.</p><p>He wonders what sort of changes Potter might be seeing in Draco from his perspective, and he feels the familiar prickle of discomfort and insecurity from his own aging beauty. </p><p>Draco has always thought of himself as a handsome man, a good mix of the Malfoy’s noble carriage and the Black’s comely features, as he had oft been told as a child. However, he is also hyper aware of the appearance of every new wrinkle on his face and his receding hairline. </p><p>He knows his hairline could be worse; it resembles his father’s at his age so he still has a mostly full head of hair with all recession appearing at his temples, accentuating his widow’s peak. At one point he tried to grow it out, but when he started seeing his father in the mirror he had cut it short. Now it’s longer on the top, getting shorter down the sides and at his neck, as is fashionable these days.</p><p>Draco had always been blessed with a high metabolism, but it’s started to fail him more in recent years and has not been able to keep up as well with his opulent lifestyle of rich meals and a steady intake of wine. It’s left him with a softer belly than he would like, but he’s good at using well cut robes to hide any unseemly pudge. </p><p>“Come on, then,” Potter says and moves toward the house. He enters not by the front door, but through a side door in the garage. He leaves it open, not bothering to look back and check if Draco is following him. </p><p>Draco does follow him inside because he sees no other option. After he steps in, he closes the door behind himself and looks around. They have walked into a living room which is furnished with two worn, mismatched armchairs. </p><p>The room is ringed with various houseplants and painted a light yellow. There’s a TV on one wall but hardly any pictures or paintings to be found. The only pictures Draco sees are a few lining the wall along the staircase. </p><p>The space holds the strong scent of <i>someone else’s house,</i> a smell that is always hard to define exactly. Potter’s house smells of something warm and vaguely sweet, clean and lived in, with lingering hints of a meal recently cooked. </p><p>Potter takes Draco on an eerily silent tour of the house. He briefly shows him each room without introducing them—not that the grand total of six rooms need any introduction—until they get to the guest bedroom and Potter says, “This is yours.” </p><p>Draco tries to keep any disdain from his face, but he’s not sure how successful he is. The house is clearly Muggle built and maybe fifty years old at most. It’s nothing at all like the grand five <i>hundred</i> year old manors Draco is accustomed to. </p><p>The house is tiny in comparison; every part of it feels narrow from the living room to the staircase. It barely fits two bedrooms, and has only a single bath. The walls are all painted flat colours, mostly beiges and yellows. The trim around them is a simple off-white. The doors are all plain identical things, with basic round knobs. There’s no wainscoting, no friezes, no decorative relief, no hearth with an intricately carved mantle depicting wizarding history. </p><p>It’s utterly depressing.</p><p>Draco has spent his fair share of time in hovels on the job, but more often than not his assignments have him spying on wizards from a similar background as himself, with similar amenities to his own home. The operation he had spent the last three years of his life in was one such, and Potter’s house is a stark change from that.</p><p>“Clean towels are here,” Potter says, cutting into Draco’s musings. He gestures at a slim door next to the bathroom.</p><p>Draco nods and then Potter is turning away and walking back downstairs without a word. For a brief moment he is not exactly sure what to do with himself. Is he expected to follow Potter? Should he settle into his room?</p><p>Based on Potter’s negligent attitude, Draco decides to do what sounds most appealing to him and take a shower. He gets a towel from the slender linen closet and locks himself in the bathroom.</p><p>The space is much smaller than Draco is accustomed to and he bangs his knee on a cupboard as he is undressing. When he is naked he regards himself in the mirror, finding all the new bruises on his body and trying to get a look at the cut on his head which he got dodging a powerful Diffindo that nearly took his head off.</p><p>He feels it out delicately; the blood has dried so it seems to have scabbed over. Even still, Draco would rather heal it now and not have to worry about it. He grabs his wand instinctually to do just that, then stops short of casting the spell when he remembers that he probably shouldn’t be using his wand right now—not if he wants his location to remain a secret. </p><p>With a sigh, Draco sets his wand back down and then steps into the shower. He fiddles with the knobs until he gets the temperature just right, wishing that he could also adjust the weak pressure of the stream. The shower stall is small but at least it is clean.</p><p>Draco puts his hands against the cold tile and leans forward into the spray. He closes his eyes and basks in the sensation of the warm water saturating his hair, trickling down his brow, dripping off his nose and eyelashes, and running down his back. </p><p>Draco is not sure how much sleep he got before Ron’s Patronus had startled him awake, but it couldn’t have been more than four hours, and since then he has spent every minute awake and on the alert. He’s absolutely knackered, his nerves are fried and a large part of him wants to curl up under the warm spray and fall asleep.</p><p>Draco unselfconsciously uses Potter’s soap and shampoo, which seem adequate and thankfully don’t irritate his sensitive skin. The soap smells of honey and beeswax, the shampoo is less definable as something clean and vaguely masculine, and both are subtle scents.</p><p>Only once the water starts to run cold does Draco leave the comforting respite of the shower, cramped and unfamiliar as it may be, and step out to towel himself off. He digs out a spare set of robes he keeps in his emergency kit and throws them on, then leaves the humid warmth of the bathroom to get settled into his room. </p><p>The guest bedroom somehow manages to be even more bland than the rest of the house with its beige walls, boring white curtains and a rudimentary set of white bedding. Apart from one lovely heartleaf philodendron, hanging to the side of the window and draping all the way to the floor, there’s been no effort to decorate the space—no pictures, no paintings, no knick-knacks. It’s certainly not the kind of living space Draco is accustomed to, but it will do for a few days. </p><p>He finds hangers in the empty closet and hangs up his robes. He’ll have to remember to ask Potter later how he can wash them without magic, or perhaps Potter would be willing to wash them when he does his own laundry. They will need special attention to get the blood out of the collar.</p><p>Once that’s done, Draco is as settled in as he can be. He is wearing the only other clothes he has, and his emergency kit will stay packed and on him at all times from now on. </p><p>Draco sits on the edge of his bed and wonders if he should try for a nap. He is exhausted but not sure if he would be able to slow his thoughts down or relax his nerves enough to fall asleep. </p><p>He chews his lip and furrows his brow as he looks around the room. It’s always such a strange sensation to be in someone else’s home but this feels especially surreal.</p><p>He is sitting in Harry Potter’s house, staying in his spare bedroom.</p><p>Harry Potter. <i>Harry. Potter.</i> Draco can’t quite wrap his head around it.</p><p>His stomach makes itself known in the form of a loud grumble and Draco glances down to it. He wonders what the chances for food are. None if he doesn’t do anything about it. </p><p>Draco makes his way back down the narrow staircase, past the entryway and into the living room. He moves cautiously, looking about for Potter but not spotting him. He tries the garage door and finds him in there, tinkering with one of the motorbikes.</p><p>Potter looks over when Draco steps out into the garage, stopping his work to watch Draco. He doesn’t say anything, and Draco finds it rather disconcerting to be stared at in silence by Harry Potter. Naturally, his reaction is snark. </p><p>Draco puts a hand on his hip and raises an eyebrow. “Is there any food?” he asks, his tone coming out more entitled than he intends.</p><p>Other than an eyebrow twitch, Potter seems unmoved by this show. “There’s food in the kitchen. Help yourself.” And with that he turns his back to Draco and resumes whatever it is he was doing before.</p><p>Draco huffs irritably, but he goes inside to the kitchen and looks around it. There are hints of untidiness, a few dishes in the sink, a pan left on the stove, but overall the space seems rather neat. </p><p>Draco is unsure whether Potter lives alone or has a partner. If he does have a partner there is no sign of them, and if he is a bachelor then he is a surprisingly tidy one, especially considering the wild state of his appearance.</p><p>After some searching, Draco finds a loaf of bread and puts two slices in the toaster. He doesn’t feel comfortable enough to try and cook anything more complicated than that, and at least he understands how to use the toaster from seeing Ron and Hermione do it at their house. </p><p>Draco is feeling good about this simple choice until the toast pops and comes out far too dark, almost black. Draco makes a face of disgust, wondering if he’s managed to muck it up somehow or if Potter intentionally set his toaster like this. Who wants to eat burnt toast? It’s supposed to be gold, not charcoal, Draco thinks disdainfully.</p><p>He finds the butter dish and slathers it on so he can force the toast down, not at all satisfied, but at least it’s something in his stomach. </p><p>After the toast is gone and he has washed the crumbs from his hands, Draco looks around and wonders, now what?</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center><p>Draco figures out how to get the telly turned on, knowing a bit about the remote from using Ron and Hermione’s. He ends up watching TV to pass the time, but he can’t stop his mind from wandering back to the raid he just narrowly escaped. </p><p>Draco remembers being asleep in a large, four-poster bed with another man, Roberts. He remembers being woken up abruptly from Ron’s Jack Russell telling him that Damian’s men are coming to raid the place. The dog tells him in Ron’s voice to get ready, and that Ron is coming to extract him. </p><p>
  <i>Draco jumps out of bed and grabs his wand. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Roberts had woken up from Ron’s Patronus, and he is looking at Draco in confusion, and he asks Draco what the hell is going on. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Draco looks to the man, whose expression is turning more suspicious with every passing second. Draco stuns him. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>He leaves the bedroom, looking one way down the hall when a hex flies past him from the other direction. It clips the side of his head with sharp, cutting pain. Draco whips around and drops low, sending a hex back to a man he recognises by his robes as one of Damian’s men. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>The wizard blocks Draco’s spell with a furious determination in his expression. Draco tries to yell at him that he’s an informant working with the Aurors, but the wizard ignores him and casts a Confringo that explodes over Draco’s shield. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Thinking fast, Draco sends a Reducto at the chandelier above the wizard’s head. He tries to jump out of the way but it catches his leg and sends him sprawling. Draco stuns him and steps around his body. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>If Damian’s men are casting first and asking questions later, then that isn’t good for Draco. He can’t get caught in this raid and locked up with the men he’s been spying on, not now when Roberts knows him for a traitor. Right now Draco needs to escape; Ron can explain his presence afterward.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The sounds of shouting and explosions echo through the manor and Draco carefully makes his way down the hall, toward the back staircase. He fights several of Damian’s men as he makes his way through the manor, hexing everyone he comes across including the Dark wizards he’s been working with. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>When he turns a corner, he comes face-to-face with another Dark wizard, and the man’s face twists in fury when he sees Draco, like he knows Draco for what he is now. Draco barely dodges the Cruciatus aimed at him by jumping back around the corner. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>A Bombarda erupts over his chest and sends him crashing into the wall behind him. It knocks the air from his lungs and stuns him for a second, and he looks up to see one of the Huntsmen bearing down on him from the other end of the hall.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The wizard has his wand raised, and just as he’s casting an Expulso Curse, Ron jumps in front of Draco and blocks it, sending it back at the wizard and shielding them from the explosion. After confirming the Huntsman is knocked out, Ron turns and offers a hand to Draco.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Draco takes it and pulls himself to standing with a groan. He wipes the trail of blood from his mouth, wraps an arm around his bruised chest and nods when Ron asks if he’s alright.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Ron tells him they need to get him out of here, and Draco leads them out onto the manor grounds. They need to get outside the Anti-Apparition Jinx before they can leave. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Three of Damian’s men jump into battle with them when they spot Ron and Draco fleeing through the courtyard. They both take up duelling stances, shielding and countering the curses thrown at them from three different angles as best as they can. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>While Draco shields, Ron counters, and when Ron shields, Draco throws offensive spells. They work together as a well-oiled machine and take the wizards out one by one.</i>
</p><p>A hand on Draco’s shoulder startles him and, before his mind is even fully awake, Draco is out of the armchair and on his feet, wand held up, ready for another attack.</p><p>For a split second his brain is completely confused by the image of Harry Potter standing in front of him, calm as can be with a wand pointed at his heart, and then he remembers where he is. </p><p>Ron has dumped him at Potter’s place. </p><p>Draco puts down his wand, pursing his lips and noting how the lighting has changed in the living room. There is no more direct sunlight through the curtains, so he must have accidentally dozed off. </p><p>Potter has changed out of the work suit and his hands are clean. He is wearing a long sleeved blue Henley that has the top two buttons undone. The shirt stretches across his shoulders and chest then tapers down to hang looser around his waist, accentuating his physique in a casual way. It makes him look positively edible. </p><p>“There’s food in the kitchen, if you want any,” Potter tells him. He is holding a plate of it, a pasta with grape tomatoes and basil leaves with a salad. At first Draco thinks it’s meant for him, but then Potter sits in the other armchair and starts eating it.</p><p>That’s perfectly fine, Draco thinks. He is capable of serving himself after all, and he wouldn’t expect Potter to have a house elf. </p><p>Draco goes to the kitchen to investigate. He dishes up food for himself and then, following Potter’s lead, eats it with him in the living room. Potter doesn’t have a dining table, which Draco finds strange. Though really, there’s not room for one in his small house.</p><p>In the time he was gone, Potter has changed the channel to some other show, a drama of some sort. Much of the plot doesn’t make sense, but at least it fills the silence between them. </p><p>Potter finishes before him and disappears into the kitchen for a little while. When he comes back he stops in front of Draco, looks at him coolly, and says, “Put the dishes in the washer when you’re finished. I’m going to bed, knock if you need anything.”</p><p>Draco nods and Potter goes upstairs. He furrows his brow and chews a bite of the pasta slowly, wondering at the weird situation he has found himself in. Not only is it surreal to be in the presence of Harry Potter, a veritable ghost that no one has seen for nearly two decades, but Draco finds Potter’s behaviour to be quite strange as well. </p><p>He’s almost like an Inferius—devoid of life. His tone is even, his expression is neutral. They’ve not had much interaction yet, but it still seems odd. He’s nothing at all like the fierce, powerful wizard of Draco’s memory. That Potter would have thrown him out on his arse, rather than invite him in with cool indifference. </p><p>Draco shivers and tries not to think too hard about the other man in the house. He tries not to think about how he was charged for murdering a suspect and abusing illegal potions all those years back. Which of course means that Draco thinks of nothing else.</p><p>Perhaps the potions addled his mind. Draco has seen it before, witches and wizards looking as if they’ve been hollowed out by their addictions. Except Potter’s case seems to be the opposite, he looks rather good for his age, quite lush, if Draco’s being honest. It’s his personality that’s been hollowed out instead. </p><p>Perhaps Draco shouldn’t judge too quickly. It’s barely been a day, and maybe Potter is being more taciturn than normal because he doesn’t like Draco and how the situation was thrust upon him. Or maybe he’s holding his feelings back for Draco’s benefit, so they won’t fight. Or, or, or... </p><p>Draco turns down the volume and curls up in the armchair, feeling out of place and strangely alone. He discovers that it’s only nine o’clock and he spends a few more hours watching telly before he decides to try and get some sleep. </p><p>Inside the guest bedroom he pauses, then locks the door behind him. He would like to think that Potter wouldn’t come into his room unannounced, but Draco doesn’t really know this Potter at all. </p><p>Draco tosses and turns for much of the night.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center><p>The next morning, Draco is anxious to hear from Ron. He didn’t get the best sleep, partly due to his nap the previous afternoon, but mostly because he always has a hard time sleeping in an unfamiliar environment. The house makes all sorts of sounds Draco isn’t used to, and he couldn’t stop worrying and wondering about Potter, on top of replaying the events of the raid over and over in his mind.</p><p>Draco wants this strange little foray into Potter’s sad life to be over as quickly as possible. He also wants to know that he can return home to his own Manor without any of those Huntsmen, overzealous little upstarts that they are, blowing down his door and arresting him for any imagined misdeeds. </p><p>The fact that they didn’t even try to arrest Draco and instead immediately cast potentially lethal curses at him shows how rabid and incompetent they are. And not just at Draco either, they flat-out attacked Ron as well. Draco can’t wait to see them on trial for the crap they pulled yesterday. He’ll be only too happy to see them disbanded and locked up. </p><p>Draco had hated Damian from the beginning, hated how after trying Potter, Damian Perriss became a household name, and everyone was talking about how Damian was going to clean up their society. </p><p>His campaign has often sounded far too similar to the rhetoric Draco had heard in his own home as a boy, only this time from the opposite spectrum with pro-Muggle, anti-traditionalism beliefs. </p><p>Early on Draco had recognised Damian’s formation of this new anti-Dark Arts squad as a bad job. Trying to counter one extreme with the other does nothing but harm. He has learned that well enough over the years.</p><p>Now they’ve gone and mucked up an Auror-sanctioned, three-year sting operation. Surely now they’ll face some punishment for their rash actions and extremism.</p><p>Draco attends to his morning routine as best he can in a strange home without his regular supply. He washes in the shower with Potter’s things and spends thirty minutes in front of the mirror agonising over the state of his hair and skin. He can’t dry his hair like he normally would with a spell, and he has none of his lavish skin creams to keep it moist or ward off wrinkles. He knows that as soon as he steps out of the humid bathroom his skin will dry horribly. </p><p>He finds shaving items in the cabinet and uses them, refusing to let his stubble get out of control. Afterward his skin isn’t as closely shaved as he likes, and he has nicked himself in three places, unaccustomed as he is to shaving without a charm. </p><p>With a resigned sigh, Draco turns away from his reflection and dresses in the same simple set of backup robes he had worn yesterday. He’s not entirely happy about it, but they are somewhat cleaner than the bloodstained ones. At least he put three pairs of spare underwear, undershirts, and socks into his emergency kit, so he is wearing something clean underneath. </p><p>Draco puts his forearm holster on under his sleeve and tucks his wand into it, feeling safer for having it on hand even if he knows better than to use it. </p><p>When he goes downstairs, the house is eerily empty. The silence mixed with the strangeness of being in an unfamiliar house makes Draco want to crawl out of his skin. He’s never been able to handle silence or solitude very well. </p><p>As he moves around the kitchen, Draco hums under his breath and makes himself more toast, this time carefully reading the dial on the toaster and turning it down first. He spots a kettle and flips it on, then searches the cupboards for tea. </p><p>Draco is not completely unfamiliar with some Muggle instruments, as he has seen things like the toaster and the kettle being used at Ron and Hermione’s home. He’s never used them before coming to Potter’s house and his confidence in them is shaky at best, but he manages alright. </p><p>After another dry breakfast, made only slightly better by a cup of tea, Draco decides to seek out Potter and finds him in the garage. He’s in the stained blue work suit again, tinkering with a motorbike. He seems distracted enough to not have noticed Draco. </p><p>Draco hesitates, then closes the door carefully and goes back into the house. His heart has already started to speed up at the thought of what he’s just decided to do, but it doesn’t seem too dangerous a thing. Potter seems well distracted and Draco is curious.</p><p>He cautiously makes his way back upstairs and to Potter’s bedroom at the end of the hall. Draco takes a calming breath and opens the door slowly, not sure what to expect, but being cautious as ever. </p><p>A loud whistling noise erupts from the room and Draco sees movement on the far side of it. He startles, and his wand is in hand, raised and ready for action. </p><p>As the door slowly swings further open and the moment drags on, nothing happens. </p><p>Draco’s heart is up in his throat, pounding rapidly. The whistling continues, but the space appears empty. Across the room is a mirror with shadows wavering over its surface, and Draco recognizes it as a Foe Glass and the movement which had startled him. The whistling then also becomes apparent as what must be a Sneakoscope. </p><p>Draco takes a breath and tucks his wand back into its holster. He glances around the room a last time then turns and leaves, shutting the door behind him. With his departure the alarm stops. </p><p>From what he had seen there is nothing special about Potter’s room. There are a few houseplants, a bookshelf, a large bed with turquoise bedding and soft yellow walls. It seems much like the rest of the house, except apparently it’s armed with Dark Detectors, which makes Draco’s snooping much more difficult. </p><p>The Dark Detectors are the only wizarding items Draco has seen since being here, which Draco finds strange. He wonders at who Potter could even have as enemies these days; he’s been living outside the Wizarding World for an age. Still, hatred runs deep, Draco knows this well enough. </p><p>He muses that his own enemies might now be considered Potter’s enemies by the Foe-Glass since Potter is harbouring him. Whoever they might be, Draco is glad to see that they are merely distant shadows in the mirror. </p><p>Draco wonders if the Dark Detectors are a sign that Potter’s life might not be as droll as he had first thought. </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>◊ ◊ ◊</p>
</center><p>Potter finds him a few hours later lazing in an armchair watching telly. Draco had been a little too embarrassed to seek out Potter after having the whistle blown on him while trying to snoop around Potter’s things. </p><p>They make eye contact, say nothing, and the moment seems to last a second too long before Potter looks away and sits in the other armchair. Draco can’t tell if Potter is aware of his snooping, but if he is he doesn’t seem to care. </p><p>Potter sets a plate on his lap, picks up the sandwich on it with one hand and his other he holds out to Draco expectantly, seemingly for the remote. </p><p>Draco purses his lips, not liking the expression of entitlement even though it is completely valid since this is, after all, Potter’s home and Potter’s television and Draco doesn’t actually know enough about Muggle shows to feel too attached to what he’s watching. </p><p>Draco is an adult now, and there’s no reason to get irritated over something so little or try to keep it from Potter just to annoy him. He places the remote in Potter’s hand and Potter switches it to a different channel. </p><p>After an awkward moment of not a single word exchanged between them and Draco feeling hungry and annoyed that Potter only brought one sandwich, he asks, “Could I trouble you for one of those?”</p><p>Potter looks over at him, chewing slowly and then swallowing. </p><p>“Yeah,” he says, looking back to the telly. “Ingredients are in the kitchen.”</p><p>Draco’s eye twitches at that. “I suppose I’m expected to make all my own meals here, then?”</p><p>That gets Potter to look back up at him. “Sorry. I assumed you were an adult, capable of making a sandwich,” he says, and though his expression is still clear, his tone and words are exactly that of the old sarcastic little prick Draco knew him to be.</p><p>The instant flash of relief and satisfaction that sweeps through Draco’s entire being is unexpected, but not at all unwelcome, from finally getting a reaction other than disinterest from him. Gods, it feels just like when he would get under Potter’s skin back at school, and Draco wants more.</p><p>“And I assumed it was polite manners to serve your guest food at mealtimes.”</p><p>“Are you a guest?” Potter asks, his eyes flashing briefly with that old wit. “I thought you were a fugitive.”</p><p>“A fugitive you are housing,” Draco shoots back. “Are you not my acting guardian?”</p><p>The edges of Potter’s mouth tighten and pull down minutely, but Draco sees it. He has to look carefully to find anything in Potter’s flat expressions. </p><p>“Whatever helps you sleep at night,” Potter says blandly. </p><p>Draco releases a short huff from his nose and crosses one leg over the other. He glances away from Potter as he debates his answer. He taps his fingers against the arm of his chair, then decides to run with what he’s thinking. </p><p>“I didn’t, actually,” he says and looks back at Potter, narrowing his eyes and watching his expression carefully as he continues, “Not when I’m trapped in the house of a powerful, unstable murderer and abuser of illicit potions, all while fearing that at any moment Damian’s Dogs might pop in unannounced for some tea and torture.”</p><p>Draco didn’t think it was possible, but as soon as the word ‘murderer’ had been spoken, Potters expression shut down further, and now he is simply studying Draco in an eerie silence that drags on. </p><p>As ever, Draco refuses to back down. He said what he said, and he meant it to rile Potter up, so he holds his gaze, hoping to see something of that old fire that once blazed brightly behind those too-green eyes. </p><p>Potter taps his middle and pointer finger a few times against his knee. It’s the only outward sign of a reaction to Draco’s words, but even in that Draco feels some measure of satisfaction. </p><p>“If they come there’ll be warning. No one can Apparate onto the property, there are wards,” Potter says, completely sidestepping the whole drug-addict murderer thing. </p><p>“You’ve put up wards?” Draco hadn’t noticed, and he hadn’t thought to test for them, but it makes sense. </p><p>“Of course,” Potter says dryly.</p><p>Draco frowns, wondering exactly which spells he’s used. “Am I truly trapped in here, then?”</p><p>Potter almost looks as if he wants to roll his eyes. He doesn’t, but his tone is a little more biting when he says, “This isn’t a prison. The wards keep enemies out, but you’re free to leave anytime if you feel unsafe. It’s your neck to risk.”</p><p>“You won’t stop me then? What if I get into trouble?” Draco asks, his concern about Potter’s attitude and his role in all this rising. </p><p>“No. I’m not here to protect you or keep you, and if you leave I’m not coming after you. You’re only here because this is the last place anyone would come looking.” </p><p>It’s obviously true, if Potter’s managed to elude all those that have sought him over the years. Still, it’s unsettling to hear how little Potter cares about Draco’s safety. Potter had <i>always</i> cared. Even when he shouldn’t, even when it meant flying through a room full of Fiendfyre to save someone he loathed. </p><p>Draco furrows his brow and chews on his lip as he studies the other man, surprised to find how much of a stranger is staring back at him. </p><p>When Draco doesn’t respond, Potter returns his attention to his sandwich and the television. He only stays for as long as it takes to finish eating, and then he’s up and heading back out to the garage. </p><p>Draco idly rubs the goosebumps on his arm, mulling over what he knows about Potter and trying to figure out if he’s sincerely as detached as he seems. </p><p>Ron’s words drift back into his mind, and Draco wonders again, but from now a somewhat different perspective, what exactly he meant when he told Potter not to get too attached.</p>
