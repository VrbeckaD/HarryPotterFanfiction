    <p>Harry Potter had known since he was very young, since before the cupboard, before the hate, and before the hurt, that he was <em>different</em>.</p><p>It wasn't the fact that he knew things that he<em> shouldn't</em>, and it wasn't the fact that he learnt much faster than what should be normal.</p><p>It wasn't even the fact that he remembered. Not always, only sometimes and <em>never</em> for more than 5 minutes.</p><p>Remembered, a smile, <em>his</em> laugh, bright eyes-</p><p>Then forgetting until something reminded him-</p><p>No, it was the fact that the first thing he learnt, was to count to four.</p><p>It was the pounding in his head, the one that left him with spitting headaches, and a want to cry out for something, <em>someone</em>.</p><p>It was the, <em>one, two, three, four</em>, that he came to recognise as himself.</p><p>Yes, Harry Potter knew he was different.</p>
