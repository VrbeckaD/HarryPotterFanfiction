    <p>Hermione Granger's wild man of brown hair was caught up in a fluffy white towel, it was wrapped tightly around her head like a turban. Her pretty, well-scrubbed face was now covered in some kind of warm, fruity smelling green slime, leaving her feeling like a specimen from the late Professor Snape's potions classroom. Her brown eyes were lightly closed and hidden beneath two slivers of cool cucumber, a pigmy troll was doing what felt like the military two step on her back. His pudgy little feet pummelling her bum one minute before dancing lithely and expertly up her spine, where its long fingers and toes then dug into her flesh, kneading what were her obviously tense and knotted shoulders. Despite being an at times, rather sadistic sensation, is was also blissfully soothing, and Hermione could feel herself beginning to relax and unwind, the tension she never realised she had, ebbing slowly from her naked body.</p>
<p>Hermione's boss at the Ministry of Magic was Ralph Messervy an exceptionally tall, sandy haired wizard, clean shaven, he spoke very quietly and <em>frightfully</em> well, always putting Hermione in mind of a muggle politician from a very bygone era. Head of The Department of Mysteries and wizard in charge of the Unspeakables section, he didn't wear conventional wizards' robes, preferring his impeccably tailored three-piece suits, silk ties and white shirts, which, as he liked to drop into conversations from time to time, he acquired from a little muggle tailor on Saville Row. That would certainly account for his bygone, political mugglelike appearance, she'd thought, upon first hearing this.</p>
<p>When Hermione had been called to the Ministry for the obligatory post job debrief with him, a few days earlier, he had told her, in that no nonsense, soft upper-class voice of his, she should take a few days off, recharge her wand after her last assignment overseas. Hermione had assured him it wasn't necessary, that she was fine, in fighting form and more than ready for her next task. As their conversation had gone on, the young witch realised it wasn't actually a suggestion at all, and she knew no amount of protestation on her part was going to change the sage wizard's mind. Hermione had groaned inwardly but smiled at her boss thanking him for his thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>"Thoughtfulness be buggered."</p>
<p>He had said forthrightly in his usual quiet, cut glass tone, waving his hand dismissively, his piercing but kindly bright blue eyes remaining firmly fixed on her.</p>
<p>"You're my best Unspeakable Granger, got to keep you in top form. Don't care what you say, that last assignment in Jamaica was a rough one in more ways than one. Do you good, few days away from it all, no interruptions, no work, Firewhiskey or two." He'd given her a conspiratorial wink.</p>
<p>"A good lie in, bit of r and r all around, rest that wand arm and all that."</p>
<p>Hermione had blushed a little at his praise, withholding a grin at his phraseology. Substitute a Kir Royale or two for the Firewhiskey and she had to admit the idea did sound rather appealing, even if she wasn't too good at taking time off and relaxing.</p>
<p>He was right, well of course he was, it stood to reason, that was why he held the position he did, her last assignment had been rough and challenging to, both mentally and physically. Perhaps a few days, not too far away just relaxing, wasn't such a terrible idea after all.</p>
<p>Hermione discovered as she exited his office, his <em>suggestion </em>wasin fact already a fait au complet.</p>
<p>Adjoining his own office, behind a large leather covered door was that of his ever-efficient assistant. She was an equally tall witch, a pretty redheaded by the name of Lois Bliss, who was just as elegant as her boss and ran his office with clockwork like precision. She'd given Hermione a warm smile and cheery Hello, as the younger woman had entered her small, ridiculously neat and tidy office, her expressive green eyes sparkling as she handed her a brochure and reservation confirmation for a long weekend at the Firefly Manor Hotel and Spa, an exclusive wizarding retreat buried in the heart of the English countryside.</p>
<p>"I'm so jealous." Lois Bliss had confided to Hermione in a very girlish way.</p>
<p>"The spa and treatments are just to die for! As for that cocktail list, and just look at the size of those beds." She'd gushed.</p>
<p>From beneath the cold cucumber, Hermione could still see the wistful look in her green eyes, hear the good-natured envy in her tone, as she'd had flicked quickly through the shiny brochure Lois Bliss had handed her. Page upon glossy page of luxury, from those very large, sumptuous still beds and rooms, to the moving images of the opulent spa and panoramic grounds.</p>
<p>Even if it did go against the grain, Hermione had to agree with Ralph Messervy's envious assistant it did look, <em>to die for, </em>the enormous beds did look exceptionally invitingand as for that sparkling reddish pink kir royale topped with a blackberry on the cocktail list, one or two certainly had her name on.</p>
<p>Hermione hadn't sampled either the bed or the cocktail. She'd arrived just after 2pm and had been shown to her enormous room overlooking the stunning grounds, by a house elf called Tiffy. The timid little creature, wearing a smarter than usual tea towel like garment, had informed Hermione that a welcome treatment session in the Valerian Spa was booked for 3pm, at which point she had apparated away with a sudden pop, leaving the young witch with just enough time to unpack, and have a quick rather childish bounce on the bed to see if it was as soft and inviting as it looked…it was. She had then slipped into one of the complimentary waffle robes, embossed with a large gold F and fully glowing insect on the pocket, and headed to the spa.</p>
<p>An hour and a half or so later, here she was covered in scented green slime, being trampled on by a pigmy troll but feeling surprisingly relaxed. The tiny dumpy creature suddenly leapt from her back, its work clearly done, and Hermione stretched languorously, her body relishing the loss of its rather hefty weight, at the same time savouring how good it now felt. Turned onto her back, the cool cucumber was removed from her eyes and the scented green slime rhythmically bathed from her face with cotton pads and a refreshing cleanser. Hermione wanted to open her eyes but found she just couldn't.</p>
<p>Loathed at she was to admit it; Hermione Granger hadn't been this relaxed in a <em>very</em> long time.</p>
<p>A grate of coals softly crackled in a hole in the stone wall, every so often they would crackle just a little louder and the sweet scent of jasmine and oranges would drift into the air and to her nostrils, clearing her senses. The remainder of the circular room was enshrouded with misted glass, ensuring total privacy, warm subtly coloured water constantly poured down the frosted panes, coupled with the sound of the fire it was positively hypnotic. Perpetually warm moist towels moved over her body, they too had a sweet aroma, but one, through her almost trance like state Hermione couldn't quite place, they rubbed and buffed her already sensitised skin and she slipped even further into her dreamlike state. Somewhere in the back of her mind she idly wondered if this was what it was like to be under the Imperious curse, if it did, that would be why it took so much willpower to resist, she certainly wouldn't want to fight it.</p>
<p>Hermione felt one hand carefully raised, the back became coated in a thick heavy cream which was then slowly massaged into the skin, one finger at a time, this was repeated on the other hand and then on both of her feet. Another substance was then applied to her palms and the souls of her feet, she tried not to jump at the tickling sensation across her instep. This had a very different consistency to the heavy cream, it was more oily and slippery, leaving her skin feeling much more silky, it left a tingling warm sensation in its wake, the strong scent of peppermint drifted to her nose.</p>
<p>"Tea tree oil". She thought vaguely as her skin continued to tingle and cool.</p>
<p>"Would you like to replace your robe before I file and polish your nails?" A soft female voice asked.</p>
<p>Hermione's therawitch had returned to the room, the moist warm towels which had previously brushed over her body had been replaced by one large warm towel which lay across her torso, hiding her modesty and keeping her from chilling.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes finally drifted slowly open, the blonde witch, with the whitest teeth Hermione had ever seen, smiled brightly at her patiently waiting for an answer, as she held out the waffle gown she'd worn earlier.</p>
<p>"Yes thank you."</p>
<p>Hermione replied, returning her smile, a little self-consciously, trying not show too many teeth of her own. Her parents might have been dentists but even she could not boast teeth that resembled a toothpaste commercial.</p>
<p>The willowy, attractive blonde handed Hermione her robe, turning discreetly away to face a vast array of coloured polishes, as she slipped it back on.</p>
<p>"Is there a particular colour or shade you would like to use?" The therawitch asked, looking from what appeared to be a hundred different coloured tiny bottles, to Hermione and back again.</p>
<p>Hermione hadn't given it a thought, she wasn't even aware there were that many different colours. She didn't paint her own nails very often, she really couldn't be bothered, and, in all honesty, they were rarely in any condition to warrant the effort, if she did, well it was usually with a clear varnish or something very natural. The three weeks she had spent in the Caribbean on her last assignment had given them a chance to grow and for once they didn't look too shabby. She wriggled her toes, glancing down at her feet, those three weeks in Jamaica had also given her usually pale skin a healthy looking tan and Hermione decided to make the most of it, even if she was the only one who was going to see it.</p>
<p>"A nice bright red I think." She said adventurously, giving another self-conscious smile to the willowy blonde.</p>
<p>The young woman positively beamed, almost blinding Hermione, returning with a handful of tiny bottles which matched the criteria. Truthfully Hermione wasn't sure she could see that much difference between any of the bottles they all just looked red to her.</p>
<p>"Vampire Blood, Berry Broomstick, Cherry Cauldron" The therawitch, began to read the labels.</p>
<p>"That one looks nice."</p>
<p>Hermione said, pointing to one of the tiny bottles in her own well-manicured hand, her eye catching one containing a shade which did look brighter and deeper than all of the others. Again she was almost blinded by a dazzling smile, the therawitch's eyes sparkling almost mischievously.</p>
<p>"Scarlet Veela" She said, that same air of mischief in her tone.</p>
<p>"Excellent choice, excellent." She enthused accioing a small stool and beginning to paint with lightning speed and expert precision. That wry smile still curving her lips, the devilish little twinkle still glinting in her eyes.</p>
<p>Hermione watched as the seemingly quite ordinary red polish coated her fingernails. It was of course magical polish, which meant it wouldn't chip or peel, and would remain bright and shiny until Hermione or another therawitch cast a removieo spell upon it.</p>
<p>"It's a lovely bright colour." Hermione said, wiggling her fingers and holding her hand into the light.</p>
<p>The therawitch moved to her toes, there was that smile again and that inexplicable little twinkle.</p>
<p>"It makes the wearer feel very feminine and sexy." The blonde witch said, sitting back to admire her handiwork.</p>
<p>"Right!"</p>
<p>Hermione tried to hide her amusement and conceal any scorn in her voice, fearing she might offend the other woman. It was red nail polish, a very nice shade of red admittedly, exceptionally bright but still it was just red nail polish. Okay, it did make Hermione feel a little more feminine but then anything girlie she didn't do as a matter of course made her feel that way, a darker shade of lipstick than she would usually wear, a little extra mascara, or Merlin forbid a squirt of perfume all made her feel more feminine, when she remembered or had to make a special effort.</p>
<p>"Well I certainly feel more feminine already." She complimented the therawitch.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>The blonde gave her another of those smiles, this time her eyes were lit with a knowing look, but she said nothing, as Hermione rose and left the room.</p>
