    <p>The day Jude Law realises he is in love with his best friend, is a day he knows he'll never forget.</p><p>They’re running lines together - like they always are. Whenever Jude has a scene he can’t get quite right, Diana is his go-to acting coach; her years of training as a director proving Jude with priceless knowledge. When introducing Jude to a new character, she loves to get him to dig beneath the surface of his <em>own</em> character, to dig deep into his heart, and soul, to make him empathise with his character - find commonalities and, consequently, find the areas in which he can truly <em>become</em> the character. Her coaching has never failed Jude yet, securing him countless main roles, and all in quick succession.</p><p>However, despite the familiarity of the situation, and the fact they have both done this hundreds of times before, something about today feels different. Jude can’t put a finger on exactly what it is, but something’s completely changed his perspective of Diana. Maybe it’s just happened in this moment, all at once, without a reason, suddenly and instantly, like a flash of lightning, a snap of her fingers, where one minute she was the woman he knew and the next he's looking at her with entirely new eyes.</p><p>It's more likely, however, that it’s happened gradually, over the years, as a result of all their history - their very first meeting having planted a small seed which has grown over the years, over the seasons, and has eventually come to bloom...and this is just him finally accepting it, allowing it, letting himself feel what he's most certainly feeling right now without fear, without holding himself back. "<em>To every thing there is a season</em>..." It's entirely possible that this is just now, at last, their season.</p><p>“Quite frankly, Judas, you’re not giving me enough passion here.”</p><p>“Did you just call me ‘<em>Judas</em>’?”</p><p>“First time for everything.”</p><p>“Right. Okay, love, whatever floats your boat.”</p><p>“But this guy’s supposed to be in love, right? Like really, truly, utterly besotted with this so-oblivious-it’s-slightly-unbelievable woman, who’s basically perfect for him in every way. And you’re acting it like she’s one of your traditional weekend flings. Come <em>on</em> Jude, there can’t have been that many meaningless women that you’ve now forgotten what real love is. Picture the one woman you truly love. In your head. Don’t tell me who she is, just close your eyes and picture her."</p><p>Jude closes his eyes, grumbling after a few minutes when nobody comes to mind.</p><p>“What do I do if I’m not in love with anyone?”</p><p>“Describe your perfect woman to me.”</p><p>Jude tries his best to look totally unamused.</p><p>“Don’t pull that face at me, Jude Law – when you win an Oscar for this, I want credit.”</p><p>He grins, shaking his head at her in fondness, “You’re insane, you know that Floss?”</p><p>She laughs at his use of the nickname. Despite it having nothing to do with her real name whatsoever it carries memories for the two of them – memories of their relationship that neither one will ever let go of.</p><p>“Of course, I do, but it’s all your fault. Spending eight years with a man can shape you in ways you’d never imagine. You've made me like this.”</p><p>“Wonderful.”</p><p>Diana dismisses his comment with a playful flick of the hand and begins pacing back and forth in front of him, “Personality traits of Jude Law’s perfect woman. Go!”</p><p>Crinkling his eyebrows in thought, Jude almost snorts in derision. His '<em>Perfect Woman</em>'? Jude Law has been on many, many dates, and his perfect woman simply doesn’t exist – if she did, he’d have found her. <em>T</em><em>he notion of ‘the perfect partner’ ruins any chance anyone on this planet has at finding happiness, </em>Jude thinks. <em>We set such ridiculously high standards, <strong>expect</strong> perfection, that we're almost always met with that familiar disappointment when the honeymoon phase wears off and we realise that actually, they're just  as human as we are.</em></p><p>However.</p><p>Despite his protests, traits do in fact begin to appear in Jude's mind.</p><p>Little traits.</p><p>Traits he’s never even realised he’s been looking for, or rather, <em>noticing</em>.</p><p>And once he starts listing them, he finds it very difficult to stop.</p><p>“Hilarious; she’s <em>got</em> to be hilarious. I want her to make me laugh so hard that I cry, every, single day. This life's too short to go through it any other way." Jude smiles, adding, "She’s got to love dancing too – the one thing I’d hate the most would be if I asked a woman to dance and she turned me down.”</p><p>Diana snorts, “Is that a personality trait, or an ego boost, Mr Law...?" </p><p>“A personality trait, thank you very much! It shows she loves having fun; doesn't take herself too seriously, and that she’s also got an appreciation for music and the arts.”</p><p>“What if she’s just…shy?”</p><p>“<em>Diana.</em>"</p><p>“Okay, okay.” Diana raises her hands in surrender, smirking. She’s enjoying this far too much, he thinks. “Fine. Anything else?”</p><p>“Intelligence. Intelligence in a woman is seriously attractive. I want somebody who can argue their case; who knows what they believe in and will defend it like their life depends on it. And for goodness’ sake, Diana, she’s got to be romantic. I want to be able to read her poetry while we eat little picnic sandwiches on a tartan rug.”</p><p>As she finally begins to get a reaction out of him Diana grins, sitting down on the warm, deep-red couch.</p><p>“Okay, Romeo. What about looks?”</p><p>“I’d prefer it if she was shorter than me; I like the idea of being able to protect the one I love." He smirks, "And you <em>know</em> I love blondes.”</p><p>The words are out before he has time to take them back.</p><p>It doesn’t occur to him, until the very last moment, that he’s been describing Diana. Forever his best friend, Diana has always been the main woman in his life. The day they met, on that dingy garage set all those years ago, Diana became his main priority – he’d risked everything for her within mere moments of knowing she’d existed. He’s never questioned why he did it, or to what purpose; he had just done it without thinking.</p><p>But in the years that have followed, it’s become a habit. Any time she needs him, day or night; Jude Law would go to the ends of the earth for Diana Frost. He has.<br/>But it’s never occurred to him that he might be in love with her.</p><p>Now, of course, he can’t believe he's ever been so naïve. If he was ever going to fall in love with anyone, of course it was going to be Diana. They work, they fit, and they may not be perfect, but that's because they're both so painfully <em>human</em>, and as human beings, they’re perfect for each other.</p><p>If she makes the connection between Jude's ‘perfect woman’ and herself, Diana never lets on, for she just laughs and says, "Right. Now, I think we’re getting somewhere.”</p>
