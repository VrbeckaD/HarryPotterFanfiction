  <b>Chapter One: No Wonder</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>During Harry’s fifth year (the second time around), Bea reveals that</span>
  </em>
  <span> she</span>
  <em>
    <span> is Death.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Bea lifted her head, groaning. Harry stared at her, momentarily horror-stricken.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“Bea… Bea are you okay? Don’t move-” He started to kneel. Voldemort looked on, a sinister smirk twisting his features more. Bea shook her head slowly, cutting Harry off and keeping him at bay.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“You know… I can’t die.” She grunted, getting to her knees. Plaster and crumbling cement from the fountain fell from her course locks as she stood.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“What…? I mean… I know, but…”</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“Don’t you get it?” Bea turned towards Voldemort, but kept her gaze on Harry. He faltered, unsure what she meant. “There’s a reason I call you master.”</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“Bea, we’ve… we’ve seen </span>
  <em>
    <span>eons</span>
  </em>
  <span> together, fought together, destroyed… </span>
  <em>
    <span>nations</span>
  </em>
  <span> together…” Harry whispered. “But I’ve never seen you… hurt like this.”</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“Yeah, well.” Bea coughed, a hacking sound that brought with it a spittle of blood. “I’m getting lazy, yeah?”</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“Besides, I’m supposedly the master of death. <em>You</em> helped me become that. How can you be hurt?”</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“I <em>do </em>have to play a hapless mortal, you know." Bea chuckled. "We don't want old Voldy here to get <em>too</em> suspicious." She shrugged bits of dust from her shoulders and shook her thick hair. "Besides... I do not simply serve you because you're the Master of Death. You see, master…” Bea raised a hand towards the Dark Lord. He frowned at their hushed conversation, even as a whirlwind seemed to emanate from her palm. The roaring winds became silent for but a moment, and in this moment, she whispered, “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>am</span>
  </em>
  <span> Death.” </span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Harry stood there. In all his power, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>eons</span>
  </em>
  <span> of knowledge and memories, he could not fathom a time where he was this surprised. With a choked laugh he hung his head. Voldemort, still poised to strike, looked beyond Bea to him. His shoulders were shaking and sniffs could be heard, as though he were trying to stifle a cry. Bea knew otherwise. She could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> it. He was elated, mortified at his own stupidity- but elated.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“That… that explains so much…” Harry pressed a hand to his still lowered face, dragging it down as if trying to pull the very countenance off his skull. With another hiccough, he burst into laughter, throwing his head back, looking very much like an Heir of the Noble and Ancient House of Black, madness creeping into his voice. “Your power, your knowledge. Your… </span>
  <em>
    <span>patience</span>
  </em>
  <span> to deal with </span>
  <em>
    <span>me…</span>
  </em>
  <span> You could have only been a god… or…” Harry trailed off, his laughter ceasing abruptly, and Voldemort was </span>
  <em>
    <span>enraged</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>How dare that weak-willed wizard laugh in his face? Does he not know that he faces death by his wand? To his chagrin, that insolent </span>
  <em>
    <span>chit</span>
  </em>
  <span> that always seem to accompany the infernal boy— his twin— chuckled, her breath easy and content as she responded in a very quiet voice. </span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Did she just call him ‘Master’?</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Whatever the girl said, Harry burst into another round of giggles and he nodded, seeming to consent to whatever point she had. </span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“I may love her… but, damn... you… You make me feel… </span>
  <em>
    <span>alive.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” His voice held a tone of irony to it that bewildered Voldemort. Mulling over their hushed conversation in his presence, however incensed him. Here he was, he, who has gone beyond what any wizard has in pursuit of immortality and </span>
  <em>
    <span>succeeded</span>
  </em>
  <span>, ignored as if he were a passerby on a train! He decided to do away with the niceties.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Avada keda-</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He scowled as the statue of the wizard from the Fountain of Magical Brethren jumped to life and intercepted the curse, blocking his view of the children.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>“You’ve made a mistake in coming here, Tom,” came the strong, steady voice of the one man he was truly wary of:</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Albus Dumbledore. The wizard approached from the Floo Corridor, his wand raised but his eyes were firmly affixed on the children huddling behind the statue. Strange. Before, when they had faced him, they were determined, fearless— daresay carefree. With their headmaster present, it was though they cowering, yellow-bellied twits. What sort of game did they think to play with him…?!</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Bea sighed. Dumbledore had nearly seen her destroy Voldemort. Though it would be of no consequence to either of them, she wanted to follow the timeline as closely as feasible. Her master’s elation at her revelation had her giddy and nearly drunk with the widened connection. He had never known or suspected what she truly was. And though he fully trusted her, this new understanding seemed to swell the very thread between them— the thread that shared life, love, magic, trust. In this heightened stated, she could feel every bit of him, his love for Hermione, his very essence that made him her master. His every whim could practically be tasted. If she hadn’t gotten to know the boy- the </span>
  <em>
    <span>man</span>
  </em>
  <span> behind the Master of Death, she would act on his every impulse. But she knew what he immediately felt wasn’t what he immediately acted on; otherwise the wizarding world would be nothing more than a sea of blood at his feet. Every soul a delicious smorgasbord that she would have engorged herself on. She appreciated the tension. </span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>There have been many times when Harry would find himself empathetic towards the beings of a particular universe or eon, and would ignore Death’s very nature: to consume. She was by no means starving; but she relished in plague and illness, flourished in war. When her master got it into his head that he had the very near powers of a god, he would go down, help the impudent mortals, give them paradise…</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>And suddenly realise that Death is a very necessary part of an intricate cycle. And Death, who had never been chained before in her existence, would quite literally chomp at the bit. Her master, who had spurts of sadism, the little bastard, would finally take notice, and force her admit that yes, she wanted to destroy; yes she wanted to consume, meanwhile taking joy from the growing frenzy in her eyes, the pooling drool on her tongue. Thus, in a startling yet pleasing turn, her master would turn his back on the worlds he saved, the paradises he created, and unleash upon those errant mortals his companion, his knight.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>And Death would grow.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>When she would lie, content, on the bed of the voids between the galaxies, full but never satiated, he would ask with a smirk if she enjoyed herself. With a purr and lazy grin, she would look at him before whispering ‘Only if you did, Master.’ Immediately with which Harry would concur. Bea had wondered for millennia if Harry had only acquiesced simply because he would feel bad if his guilt would keep Death from enjoying— well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>death— </span>
  </em>
  <span>and in his guilt unleash her upon people he spent a long time shaping and saving and loving. Now, however…</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>Now, she knew. He was enraptured.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>And wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> tantalizing!</span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span>With Dumbledore’s attention fully on Voldemort, Bea stood, wrapping her arms around Harry. She stared beyond Dumbledore’s shoulder— difficult, given the man’s exceptional height, waiting for Voldemort’s furious gaze to find hers. The moment red met with brown, she grinned. Time ground to a halt. She let her grin widen, and Voldemort’s eyes followed. Bea continued to say nothing, her Glasgow grin being the last thing Voldemort saw of her until time flowed and she vanished, and he had to leap back many metres to avoid a bright plume of golden light from Dumbledore’s wand.</span>
