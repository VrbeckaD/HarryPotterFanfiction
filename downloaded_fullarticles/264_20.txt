<p>The hours spent cleaning the catacombs of the Ministry of Magic were boring and notably uneventful until one of the two teenagers working crashed into something. A sudden bright light blinded both him and his partner temporarily and a soft thud could be heard nearby. When their eyes readjusted, a gray-haired man was in front of them where the light had been, dressed all in black except for two accents of color in his tie and scarf and carrying a wand in his right hand. The man slowly stood up and opened his reddish-brown eyes, peering at them curiously. He took a step toward them. The platinum blond-haired boy raised his wand in defense, poised for attack. A timid looking brown-haired boy eyed the man nervously and shifted behind his friend for protection. Though clearly frightened, he managed to speak in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>“Vex, we’re not supposed to do magic outside of school. Headmistress McGonagall told us. Remember?” He fidgeted with his own wand as he watched Vex standing in front of him. He wished he could help instead of being a coward. Vex shook his head and gripped his wand.</p>
<p>“Henry, shh. It will be fine.” Did the rule about performing magic and dueling outside of Hogwarts really matter in this situation? Rules don’t apply in such dangerous situations. They had to defend themselves. They were about to be sixth years, they’d had enough dueling lessons.</p>
<p>“But” Henry began only to be cut off by the man reaching out with his empty hand, attempting to say something. This motion caused the sleeves his button-down shirt to roll up, revealing his forearms. That’s when they saw it. There, on his left arm, was a Dark Mark. A Death Eater? It had been years since they were on the prowl. Vex knew he needed to disarm the man immediately.</p>
<p>“Expelliarmus!” the blond shouted without hesitation. The man’s wand flew out of his hand. Wandless, he made no attempts to move. Vex held his wand pointed at the man as he approached them. Henry was visibly shaking.</p>
<p>“Who are you and what do you want?” Vex awaited his answer.</p>
