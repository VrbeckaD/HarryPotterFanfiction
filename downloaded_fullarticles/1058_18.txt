    <p>Avada Kedavra. The killing curse. Derived from the Aramaic “let this thing be destroyed”. The spell that means death. Everyone knows that. Its why the spell is outlawed. No good can come from it. No positive outcome. Just harm, for the caster and the target.</p>
<p>Except for one small child on Halloween.</p>
<p>People speculate why that child was spared. Why she was so special.</p>
<p>None of them realized the truth. The most important truth of that night. For unlike every other victim of the killing curse, Harriet Potter’s mother had been a life guard. </p>
<p>Why would that make a difference? What would that change? </p>
<p>Everything. </p>
<p>For Lily Potter was also Lady Potter, and that meant she directed the five Potter elves.</p>
<p>And she taught them CPR.</p>
<p>Such a simple thing, and it changed their world forever.</p>
<p>On that Halloween, when the Dark Lord Voldemort cast the killing curse, it hit a shield created by Lily’s love. The shield split the effect of the curse, so that half hit the child and the other half the would-be-murderer. For the man known as Voldemort, that was enough. Enough to split the crack in his pitiful remaining bit of humanity wide. Enough to send half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of his consciousness spinning to Albania, and the other, final bit to the cooling body in the crib.</p>
<p>Emmy, of course, did as she was taught the moment she got to the room.</p>
<p>She dove to the crib, and the rapidly cooling body, and started to compress the little mistress’s chest. </p>
<p>She pushed and pushed and pushed and prayed to her ancestors that Lady Lily (they weren’t allowed to call her mistress, because that was an insult where Lady Lily was from) had taught her right. </p>
<p>That the curse just froze the body, and if you got blood pumping quickly enough, the person would wake up.</p>
<p>She pumped, and prayed, and when she felt the little baby take her own breadth, she cheered. </p>
<p>Miss Harry was alive. Alive alive alive alive! Emmy and Callie and Parky and Smithy and Willie would not be alone! They would have a Little Lady to serve, and live with Doggie until Little Lady was old enough to be the new Lady. They would protect her, just like Lady Lily said to. </p>
<p>A moment after Miss Harry was breathing, the other elves popped in. Emmy glanced around at her fellows. </p>
<p>Smithy and Callie had neat sackcloth togas, each stained but well loved. Smithy still had dirt on his ears, and Callie smelled of yummy things cooking and oranges. They were responsible for the Potter farms, and had been mates for several years. They didn’t make elflets though; three Potters were far too few for five elves to care for, so they agreed to wait until there were more little sirs and ma’ams to support more elves.</p>
<p>Parky wore a well starched suit made of old sheets, Potter crest carefully stitched onto the brim of his newsboy cap. He was in charge of the Potter Manor, while the Lord and Lady had to hide.</p>
<p>And Willie…. was Willie. He was the runt of his litter, and not very smart. His first family had given him clothes when he couldn’t learn to talk, and Mistress Euphemia had taken him in. He did very little cleaning, his magic was to weak, but was good with the animals, and always tried his hardest. Other family’s elves had been mean to him, thought he was a bad elf because of how he was born. But not Potter Elves, no no no. Potter elves stick together, and protect Willie so he can serve their family as best he can, in his own way, just like Mistress Euphemia told them. </p>
<p>“Lady Lily…” Callie whimpered to the spill of red hair before the crib. Parky immediately ran forward, and dove over the corpse, trying to do for the Lady what Emmy had done for the Heiress. </p>
<p>Willie strode forward, and tugged Parky off as his desperation turned to despair, and Smithy held his mate while she sobbed. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a big popping was heard outside the cottage. </p>
<p>The elves looked to Lady Lily, using the silent hive mind of their kind to process what had happened. Lady Lily and Lord James were dead. The Evil Man was gone but not, a bit of him attached to the Little Lady. Someone was coming. Hide hide hide! A good elf goes unseen!</p>
<p>So, when Doggie ran upstairs and picked up the now crying Little Lady from the crib, they stayed silent. When he sobbed over the dead bodies of his family, they stayed unseen. When the big shaggy man showed up and took the Little Lady to Dumblydoor, they popped back to their stations, content that the Little Lady was safe, and they would be called when they were needed.</p>
<p>Except one. </p>
<p>Willie did not trust Dumblydoor. Oh, he might not be smart or able to talk with the other elves right, but Willie knew bad people when he saw them. That was how he ended up on the streets, after all. Bad people.</p>
<p>So he followed Shaggy Man to Hoggywarts.  </p>
<p>He watched as Madam Poppy looked over the Little Lady and found the bit of the Evil Man. </p>
<p>He watched Dumblydoor cast all sorts of spells on the Little Lady, and when Dumblydoor turned on Madam Poppy and the Shaggy Man. </p>
<p>He watched as Dumbly bound up the Little Lady’s magic, as her hair turned from the light brown of a contented Metamorphmagus to the dark black of her father, as the connection between the Potter Elves and their Lady was muted. </p>
<p>And he watched as the Little Lady, not even old enough for sentences, was left on a doorstep in the freezing cold, no protection to speak of. </p>
<p>He guarded her, that night, and watched as Lady Lily’s sister dragged the bundle inside. </p>
<p>As the muggles fought over what to do. As they agreed to keep her and “stomp the magic out”. </p>
<p>As the Little Lady was shoved in a tiny cupboard to be out of the way. </p>
<p>All this Willie saw, and remembered.</p>
