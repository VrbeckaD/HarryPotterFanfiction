    <p>Harry Potter was battered, beaten and hungry when Hagrid came through the broken doorway of the shambled house in the sea. Just minutes before he’d been blowing out candles drawn in a blanket of dust on the stone floor, wishing himself a happy birthday and not really meaning it, for it was anything but happy. Harry had always been anything but happy. Harry thought that the half-crushed cake Hagrid drew from his coat might have been the finest meal he’d had his entire life, which was funny because there was nothing extraordinary about it at all. Though there was nothing extraordinary about Harry Potter, either.</p><p>Harry found out much sooner than anyone had expected that he was much more extraordinary than he, or anyone, had ever imagined.</p><p>The knowledge hadn’t come when he pulled the sorcerer's stone from a reflection, or when his touch burned the face of Professor Quirrel. It hadn’t come when he killed a basilisk or defeated Tom Riddle, nor when he fought off a hoard of dementors at only thirteen. Harry hadn’t even realized he was extraordinary the night of Little Hangleton, when his wand somehow countered the Dark Lord’s against all odds. It wasn’t any of that, for it had come much sooner than that. Though, it did, in the end, all lead back to his wand.</p><p>The day Harry Potter realized he was extraordinary was the day Hagrid took him to Diagon Alley, and the moment he was handed his wand. It was a lovely thing, eleven inches and carved of holly, though at the time Harry could think of nothing but the fact that he was holding a wand in his hand. A wand! It had chosen him, and he had done magic without even realizing it!</p><p>Ollivander told him about the phoenix feather at its core, of course, and Harry did find it quite strange, but there wasn’t much he could do about it then, nor did he understand who Voldemort truly was, how much he had truly destroyed. So while Ollivander seemed somewhat shaken, or at the very least morbidly fascinated, Harry had other concerns.</p><p>And oh, if only Ollivander had known. How much more concerned he would have been.</p><p>“Before you’re chosen, Harry, there is one more thing I must tell you,” Ollivander had said, a gaze lingering on his wrist. Harry was wearing his muggle clothes, of course, a shirt of Dudley’s that was meant to be short sleeve but hung to Harry’s elbows nonetheless. Still, his pale wrist was clearly visible. Something about the gaze unnerved him enough to flip his wrist to face away, and Ollivander’s eyes rose easily to Harry’s as if he’d only glanced for a second. “When your spell is cast with the correct wand, something may appear on your wrist, just there,” he’d tapped on his wrist, covered beneath the sleeve of his robes. “It is the mark of your soulmate.”</p><p>“Soulmate?” Harry asked. He was surprised only briefly before he shook himself. After all he’d seen that day, there was really nothing that should surprise him.</p><p>“Soulmate,” Ollivander nodded solemnly. “It will appear to you as your wand’s magic and yours agree to each other, only if you’re younger than the individual bearing your mark. If your soulmate has not yet been acquainted with their own magic, you won’t receive yours until they’re old enough to walk into a shop and choose a wand for themselves. Or, rather, let it choose them.” He smiled then, the briefest tilt of his lips, and he seemed much less frightening to Harry.</p><p>“Well, what is it then?” Harry inquired. “What is the mark and what does it mean?”</p><p>“The mark is unique for everyone, no two are the same. It could be a sentence or a pairing of words, a symbol or marking that you don’t know the meaning of. You might not understand it at first, but you will, eventually, and when you find your soulmate, you’ll know.”</p><p>“Because they'll love me?” Harry’s voice had tilted up slightly with hope as he spoke the words. Unfortunately, he didn’t think his aunt and uncle loved each other very much at all. He was looking forward to the idea.</p><p>Ollivander huffed a bit of a laugh. “Well, we certainly hope so. But, in a more straight-forward sign, they need only to lay a finger on your mark for you to feel it burn, and you will know.”</p><p>The hungry look had all but diminished from Ollivander’s eyes by the time he handed Harry the wand with the phoenix core, and although they still glinted a bit with curiosity the flip of Harry’s wrist proved unnecessary. Ollivander's eyes hadn’t so much as flickered downward.</p><p>“One last thing,” Ollivander had said before Harry exited the shop back into the hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley. “This mark is a secret only for you and your soulmate. Protect it now and always.”</p><p>Harry had nodded solemnly, a hand clamped over his skinny wrist, but didn’t look down at his still pink skin until he’d been easily carried into the crowd outside of his shop.</p><p>In green ink, shining sharply, almost menacingly, were two words.</p><p>
  <em> Avada Kedavra.</em>
</p><p>———</p><p>There are two notable markings on Voldemort’s skin. One is a dark branding on his left forearm, that of a serpent, and represents all that he has ever cared for. The Dark Mark is a power that cannot be rivaled, an army that cannot be broken, and tyranny. Voldemort’s reign concentrated down to dark black ink on pallid skin. Oh, how he treasures it.</p><p>The second mark sits on his opposite wrist in green ink and somehow seems much more stark, although the color isn’t nearly as contrasted as the black against his skin and the lines are fine. Really, the thin scrawl should go unnoticed, and Voldemort tries his best to let it be so. Yet, still, they glare at him.</p><p>A power you know not.</p><p>The words stopped puzzling Voldemort many years ago. During the years before he’d become a lord, when he was still roaming the halls of Hogwarts, pulling together followers and creating his first Horcrux, the words may have troubled him. He was still seeking power then, hungering for it and not yet possessing it in the way he knew he someday would. The words then would have been a threat. He hadn’t claimed power yet. He hadn’t made it his own, hadn’t yet grabbed wizarding Britain by its neck and squeezed just to see the veins pop. He hadn’t tasted power, not yet. He knew manipulation and deceit, but that was child’s play.</p><p>Back then, had he been stained by the words, he might have fretted. He might have fretted that the words hinted at something that might bring his downfall. A power he knew not . At the time there would be no greater threat.</p><p>But Voldemort doesn’t need to worry anymore. What is there to worry about? In a few years the Potter boy will be dead and wizarding Britain will be completely under his reign. There is no power that Voldemort knows not; not anymore. He knows it all, and what are the words, anyway? A mark of a soulmate. When they were put on his skin he was a child, still weak, his soul still completely intact and the possibility of love still available to him, somewhere, although even then he’s sure he would have shuddered at the very idea. Of course they had appeared to him, as they did everyone, but Voldemort knows very well that any of the meaning they once held has gone. He isn’t capable of love, isn’t capable of empathy, is sickened by the very thought of such weakness.</p><p>Much like the Dark Mark, the words can’t be removed, although Merlin knows Voldemort has tested every possibility. If he could rid himself of the wretched skin the words are inked onto he would carve it out himself, but the ink would only resurface. There is no ridding himself of them, despite the sight of them disgusting him to no end. Voldemort knows the words hold no meaning now, that they are a prophecy that cannot be fulfilled, and yet they stay marring his skin. He loathes them. The Dark Lord knows no weakness and the skin of his right wrist suggests otherwise. If he hadn’t witnessed Peter’s mark reappearing on the hand conjured by Voldemort he might even consider hacking the entire thing off and replacing it himself, but the soulmarks truly are stubborn little things.</p><p>Voldemort doesn’t fear the words themselves, not anymore. But he does fear soulmates.</p><p>When a soulmate dies, so does the other. It’s only a matter of time before the person left behind finds themselves with a wand in their mouth or standing in the path of a train. There is no exception to this rule. It has nothing to do with strength of mind or willpower; it’s simply the way it is.</p><p>If he were asked the Dark Lord would say quite adamantly that such powers have no effect on him. If he cannot love, surely the curse can’t touch him. Surely. And yet, there is a chance, and Voldemort does not tolerate chances.</p><p>So perhaps there is a power he knows not, although Merlin knows he would never utter the thought, not even to himself. The threat isn’t his soulmate or a power he knows not —the threat is the unknown variable, the thought that if misfortune were to befall the person who wears his mark, he could very well fall too.</p><p>So he will find this person. This wildcard. This being with a power over him, because nothing will ever have power of him.</p><p>No, Voldemort won’t be having that. Certainly not.</p><p>———</p><p>There are two notable markings on Harry’s skin. The first mainly serves to attract a lot of stares and secure the first page of the Daily Prophet much more often than Harry would like. The second sits quietly beneath the sleeve of his cloak and goes by perfectly unbothered, and yet seems to bother Harry far more than the brand on his brow has ever served to. Both have got everything to do with Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Both are a death sentence, in some manner of speaking.</p><p>Harry has heard a lot about the night his parents died—more than he might have liked, probably—but he only remembers this: a green, blinding flash of light. He witnessed the light himself in Little Hangleton just a year ago. Voldemort’s stark face, Cedric’s void eyes, his body on the ground...</p><p>But most of all the green, a sudden flash so blinding that Harry didn’t even see him fall.</p><p>He sees the color every time he allows his eyes to linger on his right arm, his hands to trace the script with the tip of their fingers. He wishes it was blinding, just so he wouldn’t be able to look at it. But it is not, and so he looks. And looks. However much he hates them he finds it so hard to pull his eyes away, and he doesn’t bother making excuses as to why. There are too many explanations, really, it would be a bother trying to sort through them all.</p><p>Excuses aside, here is the fact of it: Harry is going to die.</p><p>He’s always known, really. He’s known since the first time someone explained to him the killing curse, the first time he’d heard the words. The terror that twisted in his stomach right then was a terror unique to any other he’s experienced. The killing curse is tattooed on my right wrist, was his first thought. His second was, Voldemort is my soulmate .</p><p>Then the third: I am going to die.</p><p>Because he was. He is. No witch or wizard can live without their soulmate, and Voldemort can’t live. Eventually, he’ll have to die, and Harry is the one expected to kill him, which ultimately means killing himself. Figuratively, and eventually literally.</p><p>Harry remembers when Kevin Entwhistle’s father died during second year. It was a freak muggle accident, construction gone wrong while he was passing through muggle London. When a muggle dies they plan the funeral within the week, but when a wizard who’s bonded with their soulmate dies, they wait. Kevin left school that week to spend time with his mother. Everyone knew time was limited. It always is. Eventually she died, too, stepped right off the top of a building, and only then did they start planning the funeral. For both of them.</p><p>When Harry kills Voldemort he’ll die. He knows this, has always known this. It’s the biggest reason no one can know about the words on his wrist. If they knew, they wouldn’t let Harry do it. They would look for other options, another way to stop him, anything , but none of it would work. Nothing will ever stop Voldemort but death.</p><p>The Dark Lord is incapable of love. If Harry believed his death would drive Voldemort to his own he would have made that choice years ago, but he doesn’t think that’s the case at all. Voldemort won’t die when Harry dies, because ‘soulmate’ has no meaning to him. ‘Soulmate’ is a mark on his right wrist that he can’t rid himself of and nothing more. So this is how it will go: Harry will eventually defeat him, and when he does he will be the one driven to death, because Harry can love. Harry can love deeply, and no amount of sheer hatred for his soulmate can turn that off. Soulmates, at the very core, are instinct. Fate and powerful magic and instinct. Harry couldn’t resist it if he tried.</p><p>Harry lies in bed, the creaks and groans of 12 Grimmauld Place the only thing breaking the silence and the dim light of the streetlights from the window the only thing breaking the dark. His hand is held up above him, palm turning up and down, green ink glinting and shimmering as if alive. Harry looks. And he looks. Because it is all he’s ever known how to do with the words.</p><p>Maybe, he muses, he was always meant to do this. Maybe he’s always been raised for slaughter. Maybe this is the plan by the fates-that-be, death by a love that Harry doesn’t even feel. Death by hatred. Death by soulmate.</p>
