    <p>"The true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying."</p><p>—Albus Dumbledore</p>
<hr/><p>Harry James Potter was unamused. Death, on the other hand, found the situation quite entertaining.</p><p>Though the results were undeniable and it only left Harry sighing and wondering how his luck got him into another crazy adventure, although, this time he wouldn't have his two best friends joining him.</p><p>"So, what do you say?"</p><p>"I feel that I have no say in the matter." Harry bluntly stated, looking at death with a blank face.</p><p>Death, fully covered by his black robe, shrugged his shoulders, amusement rolling off him as he stared at his new Master.</p><p>Groaning, Harry just rubbed his face.</p><p>"How bad could this be?" He asked warily, looking at Death behind his fringe.</p><p>"You wish you wouldn't have requested that Master; however, please do enjoy the trip." Death said in his husky voice, bowing elegantly towards Harry.</p><p>Before Harry could say anything more, his vision became clouded, and his body began to tingle, and Harry then knew no more</p>
<hr/><p>Melva Eileen Snape was born the twenty-second of August in the year of 1958 to Eileen and Tobias Snape.</p>
<hr/><p>When Harry woke up again, he was no longer with Death, nor was he at King Cross Station, instead, he was comfortable in the arms of someone.</p><p>"Isn't she beautiful Tobias?" A soft-spoken voice asked. Feeling a finger cold running down his face. The words became jumbled in his mind.</p><p>Disorientated, he tried his best to move, but his limbs wouldn't budge.</p><p>"Shh… it's alright Melva; mummy's here." The woman whispered, but her words didn't register. Instead, Harry did what his instincts told him to do.</p><p>He cried.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry was a year old when he slowly understood what was going on around him.</p><p>He made a list of what he had slowly learned.</p><p>One: He was no longer a boy, he was a bloody girl. His new name was <em>Melva Eileen Snape.</em></p><p>Two: His parents were Eileen and Tobias Snape.</p><p>Three: He was going to be a big sister even though it was accidental.</p><p>Four: He was in the damn past. Bloody hell.</p>
<hr/><p>When her new brother arrived, Melva peered at her mother before curiously looking down and laid her eyes on her sleeping new brother.</p><p>Severus Tobias Snape was small, tiny in her mind.</p><p>He was pink and wrinkly with only soft tresses of black hair showing on top of his head.</p><p>"See Melva, you're a big sister, and as a big sister, you have to protect your baby brother now," Eileen said tiredly.</p><p>Melva only nodded her head; her black eyes stared wide at her mother before glancing at her little brother.</p><p>She made a promise to herself.</p><p>A promise to keep Severus Snape from becoming the man she knew he would become in the future. So damn the consequences and damn if she messed up the future, it was probably screwed already, just because she was born.</p>
