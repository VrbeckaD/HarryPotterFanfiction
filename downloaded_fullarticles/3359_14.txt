    <p><u>Note's:</u> So, Maeve Farrell is Godric Gryffindor, Aletheia Kincaid is Rowena Ravenclaw, Lela Darroch is Helga Hufflepuff. I put a lot of thought into these names and based them from how J.K described the founders houses, the time the Founders lived, and what the names of said Founders mean.</p><p>Like Godric's means "God's Power." So, Maeve's means "Intoxicating, legendary warrior queen." Now I chose Maeve due to the courage and bravery it takes to be a warrior, and if you look at the thought process of the time the Founders supposedly lived, to be a monarch was to be God's Power on Earth. Plus, she's a red-head, I always thought red-heads can be intoxicating no matter the emotion their showing.</p><p>Rowena means "Fame and Happiness." However, Aletheia means "Honesty, Truth." I chose this due to how I see house Ravenclaw, and my own 'slightly biased' view of Ravenclaw herself. I never thought that Rowena was one to actively seek Fame, that was Godric's thing, and so in search of a name that has the meaning of knowledge or some such other, I found Aletheia. Then it made sense, Rowena was a genius (and a book worm) which means she has a very low grasp of emotions, however it would also make her brutally honest and truthful.</p><p>Helga means "Prosperous and Successful." Lela, on the other hand, means "Loyal, Loyalty, and Faithful." Hufflepuff, the House, is said to be unwaveringly loyal and full or hard-working people.</p><p>Hadrian means "from Hadria" it is of Latin origin, I honestly just prefer the look and sound of Hadrian to Harry, so I will be using Hadrian. I will also be changing his middle name, anyone want to make any suggestions, or want to guess what it might be?</p><p>Farrell means "of Proven Courage." The House of Gryffindor values courage and bravery, so I thought why not.</p><p>Kincaid means "Battle Leader." Now I know what you're probably thinking, why chose that last name for the reincarnation of Rowena? Simple. Smart people make excellent leaders, they're terrifying in battle and highly valued by their friends.</p><p>Darroch means "Strong, oak-hearted." Although I was trying to find a name that meant 'strong-hearted.' Or 'Strong-willed' of which I didn't but I did find Darroch and I liked it. I also coupled that with loyalty and got the most terrifying mental image ever. Also, I couldn't really find a last name that meant 'Hard-working' that I liked.</p><p>Side Note: I also learned that Harry is of old German origin and means "Home Leader." So, Harry will not be called Harry in this story, even though I thought that 'Home Leader' worked due to him being the leader and seeing Hogwarts as his home. I think I laughed for a full minute when I fully thought about it.</p><p><u>Character Summary's:</u> Godric Gryffindor - Maeve Farrell is a fiery red-head with a quick temper, she is stubborn and courageous.

Also just so you all know before hand this will be Harry/Maeve/Lela/Aletheia, or a Salazar/Godric/Helga/Rowena, which is why the relationship tag is marked as Work's-In-Progress. A. They're still children. B. I'm still working out a few kinks.</p><p>Chapter One should be up soon.</p>
