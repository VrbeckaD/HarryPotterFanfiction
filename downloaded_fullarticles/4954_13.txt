  <u> <b>Tell Me How You Met...</b> </u>
</p><p> </p><p>10 year old Teddy J Lupin was sitting on the rug playing with his younger siblings before they had to be put to bed by Kreacher, who had decided to re attach himself due to his loyalty to Narcissa. The elf led a sulking 9 year old girl, twin girls and another boy to their bedrooms after their parents said goodnight to each of them in turn. Teddy was promised a later bedtime to allow him to accustom himself to Hogwarts hours so it would not be such a shock.</p><p>His mother, an elegant witch, blonde and beautiful – stared into his father's eyes with warmth. His father a sandy-haired werewolf by the name of Remus John Lupin smiled equally dotingly on the witch sitting in the seat that was situated five feet away from the the spot on the carpet Teddy chose to sit in. This was the time when he knew he should remain silent. His father was rarely happy when his younger children were out of his sight.</p><p>It had been a busy day. Aunt Hermione and Uncle Lucius had arrived with their increasing brood. His older step-brother Draco and his lovely wife Luna had come with their two beautifully ethereal blonde children. He maintained his party trick of changing his nose into that of a pig to make the younger children laugh. When he felt his parents were gazing rather too long at each other he coughed.</p><p>He loved his mother when she blushed. He adored it when his father coughed and shuffled his feet with embarrassment.</p><p>“All right,” he stated tucking his legs underneath him on the rug as he unwrapped a chocolate frog. The card dropped out and it was his Godfather – Harry. He had hundreds of him, he was hoping to sell them, in order to use the money for one of his Aunt's charities. “I want to know how you two met, fell in love and wound up with me!”</p><p>“It is a long story,” Remus said quietly. The boy used to stop asking when his father used those words but he was not going to be put off any longer.</p><p>“So,” Teddy shrugged. “It's Saturday, it is only 7 o'clock. I think you can tell me before my bedtime.”</p><p>Narcissa, his mother sighed and took Remus' hand in hers: “There is a saying, Remus,” she said. “Curiosity killed the cat, if we do not tell him, he will only find out the truth from others at Hogwarts and in the History lessons.”</p><p>“I suppose,” he sighed. “Go ahead,” he waved his hand. “Tell him the story, I am too tired to be story-teller tonight.”</p><p>Teddy was excited. His mother was excellent at telling stories, second only to his Godfather Harry. Bright blue eyes sparkled like sapphires as the story began shaping itself in his imaginative mind. He changed his eye colour to that of his mother.</p><p>“Teddy,” she sighed. “Do you know about... The Battle of Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Aunty Hermione told me about a big, bad, naughty wizard who thought he was so much better than anyone else, all cause he was Slytherin's Hair.”</p><p>Remus chuckled: “Heir,” he corrected his excitable son.</p><p>“Air!” Teddy said.</p><p>They decided to leave semantics until a later time. Teddy had decided to sit on the chair opposite his mother, so he could listen in comfort</p><p>“Aunty Hermione was correct,” Narcissa said regarding how seriously his demeanour had had suddenly become. He looked so much like his cousin-come-step-brother, that she felt tears spring to her eyes as she remembered Draco at this or the same age. How hers and Lucius choices had ruined his innocence. “This wizard was Slytherin's many times great great grandson. When he found this out he waged war against all those he did not think were worthy of being taught magic.”</p><p>“The ones who weren't Slytherins Hairs,” Teddy said solemnly.</p><p>“Yes,” Narcissa said. “Salazar Slytherin came from a desperate time. A time when the fear of Muggles infiltrating our world was not imaginary but real. Oh so real. Muggleborns were considered with distrust. Rowena somewhat shared Salazar's beliefs but still felt it prudent and wise to teach them, so they may fall in love with our world too much to betray... Some of his kith and kin were pretenders to Salazar's throne. Then, as time progressed, so did Muggles. Science made them less fearful of Magic. Tom Riddle, though, decided he should be the one to continue what his ancestor started oh so long ago.</p><p>This obsession made him create his army. They were called Death Eaters, they decided to rid the world of people like Aunty Hermione.”</p><p>“Why? Aunty Hermione is clever and kind!”</p><p>“There were people who decided to make their own army. They called themselves the Order of the Phoenix. Led by the only wizard Tom was scared of, that wizard's name was Albus Dumbledore. He was Headmaster at Hogwarts for a very long time.</p><p>Two members of this Order decided to get married. They had a brave child called Harry. Harry grew up resilient, stubborn, hot-headed, and loyal. He made friends with Aunty Hermione and Uncle Ron. Time and again the trio thwarted the Death Eaters and Tom.”</p><p>“Go Aunty Hermione!” said Teddy with smug satisfaction that his favourite witch beside his mother was a defeater of evil, “but this does not answer why you two fell in love. Were you Order members too?”</p><p>“No, Teddy,” Narcissa said. “I was neither a Death Eater or an Order Member. I was <em>married</em> to a Death Eater.”</p><p>Teddy turned to Remus, his eyes turned to black: “You were a...”</p><p>“No Teddy,” Remus said reaching out to his son. “I was an Order member.”</p><p>“But mum said...”</p><p>“Teddy,” Narcissa sighed. “I think it is time I tell you,” she offered a sheepish smile to her husband. “I am not your real mother. Your birth mother died in the battle – your <em>real</em> mother was another strong, brave witch. Your real mother is the reason you can Metamorph because she was one as well.”</p><p>“I don't understand,” Teddy said switching accusing glances between his parents.</p><p>“Teddy, once upon a time I was married to Uncle Lucius – who was a Death Eater,” Teddy paled as he glanced at the ceiling suddenly worried for his siblings.</p><p>“But he's married to Aunty Hermione, is she in any danger?”</p><p>“No, Teddy,” Narcissa said. “Uncle Lucius loves Aunty Hermione very much. He won't harm her or allow her out of his sight. Though it was not always so... you see, Teddy, Draco is your step-brother because I am his mother, we have not lied to you about that but, we have been economical with the truth. His father is Lucius.”</p><p>“I always wondered why Draco calls him senior.”</p><p>“We did not wish to confuse you, or the children he has now (and continues to have) with Hermione. I retained the title of mother. After much deliberation Lucius decided to allow Draco to call him Senior.”</p><p>“So, my real mother,” Teddy turned to Remus with wide tear filled eyes the darkest shade of brown. “D-didn't s-she l-love m-me s-so s-she w-want-ed t-to die?”</p><p>“No!” Remus leapt up and crossed the room and hugged Teddy fiercely. Tears rolling down his own cheeks. “No,” he soothed by stroking Teddy's hair now mousy brown hair. “Dora, she loved you, adored you – she read to you whilst you were in her womb, she ate all the foods you seemed to want her to eat and she named you after her own father.”</p><p>“S-so w-why...”</p><p>“I had a sister,” Narcissa sighed. “Another sister,” before Teddy pointed out he knew about Aunty Andromeda. “Andromeda was Dora's mother. So, yes, that makes me your adoptive mother and great aunt.”</p><p>“When you said long I thought you meant story length, I didn't think you meant complicated.”</p><p>Narcissa laughed a little: “I suppose it does seem like three separate stories in one, does it not?”</p><p>“A bit.”</p><p>“All right,” Narcissa sighed. “I suppose we had best describe it in separate parts, until you have attained full understanding of each – I shall start with the tale of the three sisters...”</p><p> </p>
