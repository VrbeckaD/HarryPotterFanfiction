    <p>A frustrated Harry walked into the Auror office he shared with one of his best friends; Hermione Grange. The witch automatically took notice to her friend's, now common, behaviour.</p>
<p>"Another fight with Ginny?" She guessed.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, "You have no idea," he replied, "I'm honestly thinking about getting a divorce."</p>
<p>"Good thing you haven't had any children yet" commented Hermione while helping Harry with his coat.</p>
<p>"Thanks," responded Harry to the small gesture. "You'll never guess what the fight was about this time!" Harry said sarcastically.</p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Hermione took a wild guess and say; children."</p>
<p>"You bet!" Harry replied.</p>
<p>The chocolate-eyed witch sighed, "You do realize that Ron's going to kill you when he finds you're going to get a divorce with his little sister"</p>
<p>Harry gave a hearty laugh "I'll get killed if I stay with Ginny any longer, so either way, I'm a dead man. But seriously, when I married Ginny, I thought she got over the fact that I'm the 'boy-who-lived, twice', but oh no! It seems that the only reason she married me was for that reason! Every time we go out in public when cameras are around, she's all sweet and caring, but when they're gone she yells at me for somehow embarrassing her in front of the paparazzi or for some other stupid reasons!"</p>
<p>Harry was getting really worked up, his face was red, he was pacing, and his hands were clenched. Hermione silently walked over to him, and stopped his pacing by putting her hands on his shoulders, looking him in the eye Hermione said "If you're not happy with your current lifeâ€¦ why don't you try and start over?"</p>
<p>Harry looked at her for a couple of seconds, thinking about what she just said, "And no I do not mean using a time-turner," Hermione added as if knowing what he was thinking. </p>
<p>Sighing, Harry grabbed Hermione's waist and engulfed her in a huge hug. Immediately Hermione hugged back, it was almost like it was a second nature for her now. With all that they have been through together, hugging Harry had become apart of her everyday life, but now that he was married, the hugs became few.</p>
<p>"Thanks" Harry practically whispered into her hair. </p>
<p>Smiling in content, Hermione pulled back a little, "No one can make decisions for you, Harry. What you do in life is up to you," she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Harry smiled back at the shorter brunette, in agreement. For the rest of the day, Harry seemed to be in a remarkably better mood, he smiled more, and he was a bit more enthusiastic about everything. Now if only that happiness could have lasted to when he got home...</p>
