    <p align="center">Chapter One:</p><p align="center">How it All Started</p><p> </p><p>Theon Harlaw cursed under his breath and made a sharp turn to the right, narrowly avoiding slamming into a tree and breaking his nose. He tried to spur himself faster, the ridges of his wand’s handle digging into the soft flesh of his palm as he desperately gripped it tighter.</p><p>He tried to cast another spell, a simple <em> Lumos </em> that he had mastered even before he went to school, but his wand remained unresponsive.</p><p>Useless. His magic was useless.  </p><p>But, there was a silver lining to that fact. If <em> he </em> couldn’t use his wand, then neither could <em> they. </em> And he wasn’t like them, he was <em> different </em> . All he needed to do was find a lake, a pond, a river, <em> any body of water </em>, and he will be safe.</p><p>
  <em> Turn right, turn right, turn RIGHT! </em>
</p><p>His blood was water, and it ran through his veins like a raging river, desperate to overflow and drown everything around it. The young man took another turn to the right, and he could see thin tendrils of light peaking from between the interlocking branches. When he broke through the thick line of trees, he barely took three steps before his foot was met with air.</p><p>Theon grabbed on a lone tree to stop himself from falling off the edge of the cliff. When he looked down from the rocky expanse, he could see the ocean waves kissing the white sands below.</p><p><em> Home </em>.</p><p>“Damn that half-breed!” He heard someone thunder from behind him. “When I catch him, I am going to -- I am going to--!”</p><p>“Watch your tongue before I tear it out of your mouth!” A familiar voice called out, angry and spiteful. “And what, exactly, are you going to do?”</p><p>Theon looked desperately at the waters below. He needed to get down there, he needed to get away from them before they find him.</p><p>He heard the sharp crack of breaking twig, and he turned around and came face to face with his uncle. His uncle gave him a cheeky one-eyed smile that made him feel naked and raw.</p><p>“Hello Theon,” Euron purred and Theon shuddered. “Why do you run, little Kraken?”</p><p>But Theon didn’t answer, his words trapped somewhere between the rising bile and his fast-beating heart.</p><p>The waves roared beneath them, as if the ocean could sense the tension in the air.</p><p><em> HoME </em>.</p><p>His uncle’s companion, a burly man with more hair than face, didn’t seem to be too impressed with the dark-haired man. “This <em> boy </em> is the Dark Lord’s son?”</p><p>Theon met the large man’s sneer with a dark stare of his own. He was boiling hot with a familiar old hatred, yet at the same time, his heart fluttered in his chest with a fear that felt too close and too real.</p><p>Euron’s laughter was like a piercing <em> Crucio </em> and Theon bit back another shudder, determined to remain strong. He was going to be strong, he was going to stand tall; for himself, for his mother.</p><p>“There might yet be hope for you yet, little boy.” He said, his hand reaching down to settle on the pummel of his sword. “Now come here so we can all go home, nice and easy.”</p><p>“You’re joking right? This shitty brat made us chase him for <em> weeks </em>!” The robust man protested, but Euron didn’t reply and he continued to watch his nephew with an animalistic glint in his uncovered eye.</p><p>Dread sank in his gut as his eyes followed his uncle’s arm. At the same time, he resisted the urge to giggle madly; who carried a sword around in the twenty-first century anyway?</p><p>“I am not coming with you.” Theon said and he blinked rapidly, surprised at his own daring. He repeated himself, his own words bolstering his confidence. “I am never going back with you.”</p><p>Rather than being furious, his uncle seemed amused at Theon’s unwavering statement. “And where exactly do you intend to go? You’re the <em> Dark Lord’s son </em>, Theon -- the world is full of danger. Your mother learnt that the hard way didn’t she?”</p><p>Theon closed his eyes for just a moment, trying to remember his mother as she was and not as Euron implied. He tried, but the memory was too graphic, too soon for him to forget easily. He couldn’t think of his childhood home without thinking about the blood-stained walls. He couldn’t think of his mother without remembering her grey corpse, strewn on the ground like a battered ragdoll. He couldn’t look at his uncle without remembering how he looked that day, soaked in Alannys’s blood, as if he had bathed in it, and picking his teeth with one of his mother’s decorative pins.</p><p>Theon opened his eyes and looked at his uncle’s sword, remembering how red it was that day.</p><p>Euron looked down at his sword, as if he knew what he was thinking about. The young man checked on his mental shields, and found them intact. He observed his uncle’s smile, and it reminded him of a shark’s, full of teeth and greed.</p><p>“I won’t hurt you, little Kraken.” He crooned, but he didn’t remove his hand from the sword. Instead, he extended his free hand for Theon to take.</p><p>“Just come along, <em> half-breed </em>.” The unknown man said, pointing with his chin towards the cliff’s edge. “You’ve nowhere to go.”</p><p>Theon looked down at the ocean and it beckoned him to come closer, to sink into its cold embrace.</p><p>
  <em> hOMe. </em>
</p><p>He raised his head and his green-blue eyes met his uncle’s dark one.</p><p>“I’d rather die as Alannys’s son, than live as Balon Greyjoy’s soldier.”</p><p>He lurched his body towards the empty blue ocean below and he allowed gravity to pull him closer, and closer and closer --</p><p>His skin prickled, and his eyes filled with tears. He opened his mouth, but whether he screamed or not, he didn’t know; the wind’s growling was too loud in his ears. His blood was sea-water, eager to go back to where it belonged and he wasn’t scared of the ocean below. As the distance between himself and the ocean grew smaller and smaller, Theon found himself content and prepared for what was to come.</p><p>
  <em> HOME. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>“No! Please, no! Don’t take him away!” Alannys screamed loudly in his ear, desperate and completely broken. Her strong arms were wrapped completely around his body, as if she was trying to meld him back into her body, hide him away inside her. “Please, please -- anyone but him, anyone but my Theon!”</p><p>This wasn’t right.</p><p>His mother never begged. She held her head straight and tore down everything and anything that stood in her way. Alannys Harlaw was strong and proud because she was of the ocean and he was like her because he was of Alannys Harlaw.</p><p>This was wrong. Alannys Harlaw died seven years ago.</p><p>But it was his mother’s voice. It was his mother’s arms. It was his mother’s scent.</p><p>Did this strange woman have her face, too?</p><p>Filled with a desperate desire to see the animated face of his mother, Theon forced his eyes to open. They were tired, lazy and unwilling to move, as if he had slept for an entire day. For a moment the world was just a blur of multi-colored bubbles, and then the world sharpened to a painful degree.</p><p>He raised his head up, shaky and tired.</p><p>It was his mother. There were bags under her eyes and worry lines that he never saw before, but Theon recognized her. He knew those blue-green eyes as well as he knew his own, and he knew that sharp chin and strong eyebrows.</p><p>He saw them in the mirror everyday.</p><p>“Mother?” He whispered, falling back into age-old habits and speaking in Mermish.</p><p>At the sound of his voice, she stopped her screaming and screeching. Her arms grew slack and she looked down at him, giving him his first clear look at her face. Theon drew back, struck by how <em> different </em> she looked. This was his mother, but she was not at the same time; she was older, caged and absolutely miserable.</p><p>“Theon.” She warbled back, also in Mermish. “My baby, my Theon -- I knew you’d wake up, I knew you’d come back to me, I--”</p><p>But whatever she was going to say next was cut off, when he was harshly removed from her defenseless grip.</p><p>“No!” She screamed, this time in English, lunging towards him as he was carried away. An armored man stepped forward and held her back. Theon recognized him; it was his uncle Rodrick.</p><p>His dead uncle Rodrick, murdered by the Dark Lord for helping Alannys and her youngest to escape.</p><p>“Give him back! Give him back, he’s my son! Mine! Only mine!”</p><p>Theon struggled against the arms that held him, but he was too weak, barely able to move. He looked up to see who was holding him and he nearly choked on his jumping heart.</p><p>Balon Greyjoy. The Dark Lord.</p><p>Father.</p><p>The man didn’t even look down on him. He simply extended his arms, and Theon turned his head to see a dark-haired man opening his arms to recieve him from Balon.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck Theon.</p><p>
  <em> Why was he so small?! </em>
</p><p>“W-what?” Theon managed to croak, his throat dry and disused. But still he forced himself to speak, to try and understand. He looked down on his small hands; it was the hands of a child, not a fully grown man. “What’s going on?”</p><p>The man who was holding him looked down on him in pity and the young man felt humiliation burn in his cheeks. He tried to struggle out of the man’s arms, but they were firm and strong around him.</p><p>“Take him,” Balon said impassively, confusing Theon. Didn’t his father want him by his side? Didn’t he chase him down all the way from the islands to Paris? Didn’t Balon order Alannys’s death just so he can force Theon to be with him? “He’s a true Ironborn. He won’t bend or break to you, no matter what.”</p><p>Theon choked on his tongue, on his desire to refute the Dark Lord’s claim. He never swore to serve the Dark Lord, he never killed a Muggle -- how could he be Ironborn?</p><p>The burly man next to the man holding him gave Balon a disapproving look.</p><p>“You’ve lost your eldest sons, Lord Greyjoy and now you’re giving away your youngest. Is that all you have to say?” He roared, resembling an animal. Rodrick and Maron were dead?</p><p>Balon didn’t look at them and instead he kept looking down.</p><p>“We do not sow, <em> Your Grace </em> .” Balon said, the words dripping with poison and ill-intent. Theon caught a stray thought from his father’s too-open mind. <em> You and yours will get it Baratheon, sooner or later, but we will rise. Rise above you because-- </em></p><p>“What is dead may never die.” He whispered, looking at the man who sired him, understanding slowly dawning on him. Balon raised his head and looked at Theon in the eye for the first time since this strange sequence of events began.</p><p>Theon thought he almost looked sad.</p><p>The men turned away, ready to separate Theon from the people who brought him into this world.</p><p>He craned his neck and watched as his mother broke out of his uncle’s grip. She threw herself onto the ground, near the two men, and her dark hair spread on the ground like spilled ink.</p><p>“Wait, please!” She begged, one hand gripping the dark haired man’s ankle tightly. “Please! He just woke up from years long of sleep! He knows nothing! Let me explain the situation, first -- please!”</p><p>The man who was holding him shared a look with ‘Baratheon’. They seemed to come to a wordless understanding, and Theon was passed to his mother’s shaking hands. She turned away from everyone and hid her face near his ear.</p><p>“What do you remember, my son?” She asked, switching back to Mermish.</p><p>“I fell.”</p><p>“Yes.” Alannys confirmed, sounding relieved. “You fell from a tower two years ago, and you’ve been sleeping ever since.”<br/>
Theon furrowed his eyebrows in confusion but he let Alannys continue to speak in their shared tongue.</p><p>“Aerys Targaryen was displaced from his throne and Baratheon took his place.” Alannys spoke, rushed and looking over her shoulder and towards the impatient men behind her. “Your father rebelled against King Baratheon -- he thought he could be king, thought he could build you and your brothers a better legacy than what he inherited.”</p><p>Theon glanced at Balon, and saw that his father had bowed his head down once more, eyes masked by his graying hair.</p><p>“But he lost, and I lost your brothers and now I am going to lose you too, as a result of his pride and foolishness.” Alannys’s voice broke even as her hand carassed his cheek, and Theon leant into it, chasing the familiar warmth he had been deprived of for so long.</p><p>“They intend to take you as a hostage and if your father rebels again, they will lop your head off your shoulders.”</p><p>They both stilled at her grim words.</p><p>“But don’t you worry; I won’t let him risk your life, I promise.” Alannys whispered.</p><p>The man who had held him took a step towards Alannys. “Lady Harlaw…”</p><p>“A moment, Lord Stark, one more moment please!” Alannys requested with a wrecked voice but Theon could sense the thick <em> charm </em> coated around it like honey.</p><p>“When they take you to Winterfell, find a body of water. I will speak to you through there, my little fish. And don’t you ever forget,” She said, raising his face so their ocean colored eyes could meet. “You are of the ocean and they will never take that away from you.”</p><p>Theon wanted to ask more question, to beg her to explain the situation better. To ask whether she was <em> his </em> mother or some doppelganger he had conjured up in his madness.</p><p>But there was no more time. King Baratheon barked harsh orders and Lord Stark made his way towards them, probably to pick him up. But Theon shook his head and pulled away from his mother, forcing her to put him down on weak, unsteady legs.</p><p>He took one step, then two and almost fell face first on the ground if it wasn’t for Lord Stark’s hands on his shoulders.</p><p>Theon raised his dark hard and looked at the older man with his pale eyes, but he sensed neither ill-intent nor scorn from the man. But there was no warmth in that gaze either.</p><p>“I will walk.” He said, straightening his back. An empty pit in his stomach begged him to lay down but he ignored it and drew strength from the roaring ocean around him.</p><p>Lord Stark looked down on him with something akin to respect and he nodded his head. Theon didn’t look back, knowing that he will crumble down and break if he saw his mother.</p><p>And he couldn’t look weak now.</p><p>After all, he was Theon Harlaw and he was the son of Alannys Harlaw, a Siren of the sea. How could he show weakness when the salty air caressed his nostrils, urging him to be strong?</p><p> </p>
