  <p>SIRIUS BLACK ARRESTED FOR BETRAYING THE POTTERS AND KILLING TWELVE MUGGLES AND PETTIGREW.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga Black stared at the headline. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Then she read the article. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She reread it, but it still made little sense. He couldn't have possibly betrayed that wretched friend of his. The mere notion made her scoff in disbelief. James Potter was—had been—a typical foolish, ill-mannered Gryffindor, but her blood traitor of a son had been pathetically attached to Potter. There was absolutely no way he would betray Potter to the Dark Lord, no matter how often she—no matter how often <em>Orion</em> had wished his former son would see the error of his ways and stop associating with those blood traitors. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>The rest of the article made just as little sense. Killing twelve muggles? That muggle-lover? </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga pursed her lips, thinking of the ugly row they'd had about muggles and mudbloods before the Traitor stormed out of the house—to never return again and to <em>die</em> for her. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>No. There was no conceivable way he had done anything the article claimed he had. Even killing that Pettigrew creature was suspect. Walburga didn't remember her firstborn ever having particular fondness for that half-blood filth—she had always thought Pettigrew had been more of a follower of his than a friend—and yet it was unbelievable that he would kill that pathetic boy. Not because he wasn’t capable of killing; no. Despite his claims to the contrary, Sirius Orion was entirely capable of cruelty. He just thought himself better than <em>them</em>. He liked to think of himself as “good,” unlike the other Blacks. He would never do something like killing one of his precious Gryffindor friends. No. Something was amiss.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga glared at the article one more time before sitting up on her bed. “Kreacher!”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>There was a loud crack.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“The Mistress summons Kreacher?” the elf said, bowing.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Robe me,” she ordered, standing up. “I'm going out.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Something like surprise flickered over the old house elf’s face. She knew why Kreacher was surprised. She hadn't left the house in months, and she hadn't left her bed in weeks. She’d had a cold—that was the reason why it was so hard to get up in the mornings. She wasn't depressed, no matter what Lucretia said. Her husband was dead, her only son was dead, and her—the Traitor had been as good as dead to her for five years. She was alone, but she was entirely fine. Walburga Black didn't <em>do</em> depressed. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She stood unmoving as the house elf’s magic robed her in mere seconds in a burgundy dress and black velvet robes. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She looked in the mirror and saw a regal woman with pale skin and sharp gray eyes. She was fifty-five, middle-aged by Wizarding standards, but she looked younger. Her hair was still pitch black. She had never been as conventionally beautiful as Orion—and He—had been, but she had always been rather striking. She was glad to see that the strain of the last few years hadn't shown on her face. She couldn't afford showing any weakness to the lesser people. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>As Kreacher finished working on her hair, Walburga turned and left her bedroom. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>In the hall, she paused, listening to…silence. The house was so very silent. Something in her chest clenched, a dull ache the source of which she couldn't pinpoint. It must be the lingering cold. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga entered the library and stopped in front of the family tapestry. She stared at the picture of her husband (dead), then at the picture of her son (dead) before moving her gaze to the scorched mark where His picture had once been. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She stared at it.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>It was impossible to completely remove a Black from the Black Family Tree, no matter what they told the outsiders. A Black was a Black until their death. The Family Tree was based on blood. That was how it knew when a new Black was born or when a Black died. Removing one from the tapestry was impossible. They could only mask it.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga pressed her wand against the scorched mark and murmured the spell. The illusion disappeared.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She stared hungrily at the handsome face of her firstborn, despising herself for the way her throat constricted. Traitor. He was nothing but a filthy traitor. Traitor to the ideals of their family, traitor to their family. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She hadn't seen him in five years. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“I should let you rot in Azkaban,” she bit off, glaring at his picture. “It's all you deserve for abandoning—” The lump in her throat became painful and she cut herself off, blinking the tears away furiously. Merlin, this was pathetic. He didn't deserve her tears. She should feel nothing. He wasn't her son. Her good son—her only son—was dead, dying for the right cause. That ungrateful traitor meant nothing for her. If he was unlawfully imprisoned, then that was what he <em>deserved</em> for choosing blood traitors over his family. If he was abandoned by his blood traitors, now he knew what she felt like five years ago when he abandoned her. Served him right.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Locking her jaw, Walburga restored the illusion and turned away from the tapestry. She would do nothing for him. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Let him rot in Azkaban.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>***</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Her resolve lasted a week.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga hadn't seriously thought that he would be abandoned by the so-called  Light side. She had expected at least the filthy muggle-lover Dumbledore to demand a trial. But the portrait of Phineas Black that hung in Hogwarts reported that Dumbledore seemed to believe the reports and had no intention of getting involved. The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that no one had made any inquiries—and that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>It made her furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time they might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn’t be allowed.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Kreacher, robe me,” Walburga ordered and waited impatiently as she was clothed in another set of expensive, fine robes.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>This time she didn't go to the Black Family Tree. She went to the Floo room and traveled to the Ministry. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>It was full of disgusting mudbloods and blood traitors, as always, and Walburga barely kept her sneer off her face. She had to admit that she hadn’t entirely approved of the way the Dark Lord had chosen to conquer the Wizarding world and restore the supremacy of Purebloods—everything would have been so much easier to accomplish with politics, without spilling unnecessarily the blood of Purebloods—but at moments like this, all she wanted was for the filth to disappear and stop <em>touching</em> her.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“I want an audience with Crouch,” she told the Crouch’s secretary.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>The girl who looked barely out of Hogwarts (did she know Him?), gave her a distracted look. “Mr. Crouch is busy, Ma’am. I can make you an appointment in four days—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Do I look like I am willing to wait four days?” she gritted out. Did she not know who she was speaking to?</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>This time the girl gave her a longer look. Perhaps she finally recognized the Black looks, or perhaps she could simply sense how much superior to her Walburga was, because she said, “I can try to get you an audience if it's really urgent, Ma’am.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“It is,” she bit off. “Tell him Walburga Black is here and he will see me at once.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>The girl’s eyes widened a little. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She stood and disappeared into Crouch’s office.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga waited, standing tall and proud.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She didn't have to wait long.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Mr. Crouch will see you, Ma’am.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga went inside.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch was seated behind the huge desk, a deep frown on his face. “Walburga? Please take a seat. To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She didn't appreciate being addressed so familiarly. She and Bartemius Crouch were hardly friends. Crouch’s mother belonged to one of minor Black branches, a distant relation, but the Crouches’ blood wasn't as pure as the Blacks’. Walburga was positive there had been a mudblood several generations back, something the Crouches tried to hide, but she knew everything where Blood was concerned. Not to mention that Bartemius Crouch associated with blood traitors, openly condemning supporters of the Dark Lord and unnecessarily harsh toward Dark wizards.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>He was no friend of hers.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga didn't sit. “You are not an idiot, Bartemius. You know why I am here.” </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch gave her a wary look, something pinched and stubborn about his expression.  “I was entirely within my rights to arrest Sirius Bla—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Do not say that name,” she snapped.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch stared at her. “It’s been years, Walburga. Four, five? Sirius—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Do not say his name,” she bit off again. She knew she was being irrational. She could hardly expect Ministry officials not to say the Traitor’s name. But she couldn't bear hearing it. Her son was dead. Dead. </p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch gave her a puzzled look. “I've heard that his name was forbidden to say among the Blacks, but Merlin, woman! It's been—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“I don't care how long it's been,” she gritted out. “I wouldn't expect a Crouch to understand our affairs. But that's irrelevant right now.” She narrowed her eyes. “Let's talk about relevant matters. Since when can the Ministry send people to Azkaban without as much as a trial?”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>A muscle ticked in Crouch’s jaw. “It was a war. During the war, the DMLE has the authority to send dangerous criminals straight to Azkaban, especially in most obvious cases like Black’s. The man is a Death Eater. He was caught at the crime scene—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“Let me rephrase the question,” Walburga said, her voice very even. Only people who knew her well knew that she was at her most dangerous when she was seemingly calm. Crouch wasn't among them. “Since when does the Ministry have the authority to send a son of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black to Azkaban without as much as a trial?”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch gave her a mulish look. “He's disowned. He doesn't have that protection—”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“If you bothered to check,” Walburga hissed. “You would have found that he’d never been officially disowned. In fact, Arcturus Black still has him listed as the heir.” It was something Walburga didn't understand, but she’d never pretended to understand her father-in-law’s reasons. The old man was stubborn as a mule and impossible to get hold of. She hadn't seen him since Orion’s funeral. The only reason Walburga knew that the Traitor was still listed as Arcturus’s heir was because Narcissa had visited her, asking if she could convince Arcturus to make her son the heir. Walburga had promised the girl nothing, of course. It infuriated her that the Traitor was still the Black heir—he would hardly appreciate such an honor—but the thought of a Malfoy brat inheriting the title was unthinkable.  The Malfoys were upstarts compared to the Blacks.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch swallowed visibly at the news, a bead of sweat running down his forehead. “I didn't know.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>She glared him down. “Now you do and you will transfer him from Azkaban into the Ministry’s holding cells where he will wait for his trial. Immediately.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch glared. “What are you hoping to accomplish? He will be just sent back after his trial! He's a Death Eater and murderer!”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Walburga met his eyes. “I wouldn't be so sure of that.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch paled. “What? You can't possibly believe…How can you know?” He gave a harsh laugh. “You can't know anything! You haven't seen him in how many years, woman?”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Her lips twisted. “I gave birth to him. There’s no one in the world who knows him better than me.” Not knowing him had never been the issue. She knew him, had seen the first concerning signs long before he'd been sorted into Gryffindor. It had been one of the reasons she'd tried to constrict him and mold him—to make him <em>better</em>—but she had lost that battle. She had lost him.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Pushing her errant thoughts away, Walburga eyed the head of the DMLE. Crouch was a highly ambitious man. She might despise his views on Dark wizards, but she could respect his ambition and drive. She also knew ambitious men were capable of many unsavory things in order to achieve their goals. She could sense that he was already thinking frantically how to save his precious reputation in case she was right.</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“One more thing,” she said, smiling nastily. “If something happens to him on the way from Azkaban, you will take his cell in Azkaban yourself.”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>Crouch gave her an affronted look. “Who do you think I am?”</p>
</div><div dir="auto">
  <p>“A desperate man,” she said and left, her head held high.</p>
</div><div>
