    <p>Voldemort had an evil plan to steal one of Harry’s friends in the night so Harry would come and find them and he could kill Harry. He edged towards Hogwarts quietly. He slipped into the girl’s dorm even though he was a boy. There he saw one of Harry’s best friends… Hermione Jean Granger. THE MUDBLOOD. He picked her up and used his wand to go back to his lair. But not without leaving a note on Harry’s pillow.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry James Potter woke up and saw a note on his pillow. He read it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dearest Potter, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I have written this to inform you that I have taken your friend. The only way to get her (Hermione) back is to come to my lair and get her. ALONE. You shall not inform anyone about this. Once you come to my lair we shall duel. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Yours Truly,</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lord Voldemort.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry gasped. He had taken Hermione! Harry was gonna have to get her back.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you reading mate?” Ron said.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stuffed the note in his pocket. “Nothing.” Harry said. He couldn’t inform anyone of this. Not even his other best pal Ron.</p><p> </p><p>“OH, oh so you’re keeping secrets from me now??” Ron said.</p><p> </p><p>“NO no I’m not.” Harry said. But Ron tackled him to the ground and stole the note.</p>
