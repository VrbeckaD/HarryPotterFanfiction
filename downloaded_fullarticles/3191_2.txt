    <p>Meanwhile, in the time that had passed since Remus left, Sirius had done nothing <i>but</i> think of him.. He couldn’t help but wonder if he was alright, if he was awake yet- and if so, was he scared? Did he know what happened? <i>How</i> much could he recollect from that night? It was like a mantra, repeating in his head until the record scratched and made him feel sick.. More so than he already felt, of course. </p>
<p>His body was a canvas, and the blood painted the glaring reminders of what had happened to them.. To him. Even after hours had passed, he could still see flashes in his mind as if it were <i>happening</i> still. Her cold fingers... wrapped around his hair as she clutched it in her fist, holding him so tightly that he’d been certain she was just going to snap his neck. The hot breath against his ear as she and Remus did their silent dance of communication. The way she’d suddenly crashed to the floor, everything happening too fast to process, and then... Sirius could almost still <i>feel</i> the white hot agony of her ripping into his flesh. Tearing at the muscle in his back, ripping it open in the process.. He could feel the ghost of warm blood flowing down his back, hear the utter panic in James’ voice as he cried out his name, feel the creaking floorboards screech and moan as the sound of snapping jaws and battle took over. The thump as her body finally hit the floor.. </p>
<p>Sirius was shaking, clenching his fists so hard that they were white-knuckled, and he wouldn’t have even noticed if not for the hand that settled on his shoulder. It made him jerk his head up, eyes wide as he took in the fact that it was James- <i>just</i> James. They were safe, they were fine, Remus was fine. The kitchens of Hogwarts were secure, and none of the house elves bustling around them looked particularly murderous.. He felt small, for a moment; Childish, for being afraid, even if only for a fraction of time. He hadn’t even endured that much.. Not nearly as much as Remus, and even despite that fact, his better half walked around every single day without this fear. Without the nervousness, or the constant worry that he’d be attacked again. How the hell did he do it? It had taken Sirius years just to stop flinching every time an adult man put a hand on him, or a Professor called him Mr. Black. Now he had another reason to flinch, another reason to turn up the volume of his perfect facade.. Why? Why was he so weak, sometimes? It made him want to get angry. Made him want to clench his fists for a <i>different</i> reason, and exercise that explosive aggression that put Regulus in the hospital wing.. But he couldn’t. Even <i>trying</i> to, he couldn’t.. Because he wasn’t angry, to put it simply; He was devastated.. Over what he’d become, over the fact that Remus was lying in a hospital bed barely clinging to life, over said condition being due to <i>murdering</i> someone for him. When the sixteen year old pictured all of that, <i>any</i> of that, really... He didn’t want to scream or break things. Sirius wanted to cry. For the third time just that week- that <i>hellish</i> week- he wanted to break down and cry. However, just like the first two times... He didn’t even have it in him.</p>
