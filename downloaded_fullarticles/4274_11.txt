          <div class="userstuff"><p>It started in the library.</p><p>As per his usual routine, Cyrus had squirreled himself away in a vacant corner, hidden behind the massive shelves of near endless knowledge. Magic was truly a riveting subject; no matter how much he learned, there always seemed to be more! Not even being raised with its knowledge had put a damper on his curiosity.</p><p>Naturally, his dedication to learning his innate heritage had placed him in the studious house of Ravenclaw. Which, he supposed, suited him just fine. Especially since, unlike the other houses, it was so easy to be left alone – not stuck traveling in a group of morons determined to make a nuisance of themselves.</p><p>Just peaceful, and quiet, and <em>alone</em>. The perfect equation for some extra personal study in the library.</p><p>“Why the fuck I gotta know this shit?”</p><p>…or, at least, it <em>should</em> have been. Cyrus shot a cutting glare at the only other table nearby, where a single, red-tied student with magically-bleached hair sat, cursing at the parchment before him. This <em>again</em>?</p><p>The blue-haired Ravenclaw returned his attention to his own books. The other boy would leave soon – the Gryffindor usually did after getting frustrated. A few moments of silence was all it took for Cyrus to begin forgetting the other wizard was nearby, until yet another slew of loud cussing broke his concentration.</p><p>“Do you <em>mind</em>?”</p><p>“Huh?” The mystery teen’s head snapped up, giving Cyrus a once over. “Ah, nah, I don't mind yo.” He offered an attempt at a smile before once again returning his attention to the books and parchment on his table.</p><p>Cyrus <em>almost</em> gaped at the dismissal, and his glare intensified as Guzma gave yet another curse to his apparent schoolwork. With a barely-restrained huff, Cyrus attempted to return his attention to his own readings. The librarian could hear a pin drop from three floors down; it wouldn't be long before the Gryffindor was dealt with.</p><p>Thirty minutes later and Cyrus was beginning to doubt that. Despite the constant barrage of sudden, frustrated noises that were loud enough to keep the Ravenclaw from processing more than a single sentence the whole time, the librarian had yet to appear and silence the red-and-gold clad disturbance.</p><p>Cyrus, fed up with the noise, took a calculated risk. The slam of his books on the Gryffindor's table drew a startled yelp out of the other teen. “Hello, I couldn’t help but notice you seem to be having some trouble.” Cyrus spoke in his best imitation of pleasant company.</p><p>Gray eyes blinked. “Um.. yeah, I guess?” The stranger said, ruffling the back of his head and pointedly looking away from  Cyrus. “But it ain’t nothin’ too big, I can handle it.”</p><p>Oh no, like hell was he giving up that easily. If Cyrus had even the slightest hope of getting anything done, this Gryffindor needed to be dealt with, and now. “Are you quite sure?” The ‘Claw prodded, gradually losing his pleasant facade. “Because your swearing has been making it impossible to study <em>for the past hour</em>.”</p><p>“Ah– Shit, man. I didn’t mean– Er, I’ll just go, okay?” He stood to leave, rush gathering his belongings which had been strewn over the table.</p><p>“<b><em>Sit</em></b>.”</p><p>The rough screak of wood on wood sounded as the Gryffindor immediately plopped back in his seat.</p><p>"I'm going to help you, and this is <em>final</em>, because otherwise you're just going to keep coming in here and being a nuisance." Cyrus stated, pushing down the urge to sigh at the wide-eyed stare he got in return. “Is that clear?”</p><p>“Yeah, uhh…” The other teen got out eventually, word processing finally catching up with him, but he trailed off as sheepishness took hold again. “I, uh, didn’t catch your name, yo?”</p><p>Reluctantly, Cyrus resigned himself to exchanging pleasantries with the loudmouth. “Stone. Cyrus, Stone. And you are?”</p><p>“Guzma.” He didn’t bother with his last name. He was muggleborn – it wasn’t like it would mean anything. Plus, he wasn’t exactly eager to be throwing his jackass of a dad’s name around, anyway.</p><p>“Alright, Guzma.” Cyrus slid into a spare chair next to the bleach-haired teen, peering at the parchment in front of him. “What is it you’re so worked up about?”</p><p>Guzma nudged the parchment over, giving him a better look. “…astronomy?” Cyrus shot the other teen an appraising look. He’d expected something more along the lines of charms, or perhaps potions.</p><p>“I know, right? Hard as fuck, I can’t keep all them moons straight.”</p><p>He clearly wasn't the best artist, either, if his handmade diagram was anything to go off of. At the very least, all the planets and their corresponding moons were appropriately arranged.. “Well, you seem to have a basic grasp of their positioning, so let’s start there.” It didn’t take long for Cyrus to slip into lecture mode from there – astronomy was a strong point for him. Much to his relief, Guzma’s attention didn’t stray as he spoke.</p><p>-</p><p>Neither realized how long they’d been sitting together until the Librarian themself appeared table side.</p><p>“<b>Students.</b> ” The eerie, booming voice startled both of them to attention. “ <b>The Library Is Closed For Today. If You Wish To Continue Studying, You Will Need To Do So Elsewhere.</b>”</p><p>To say Cyrus was shocked would be an understatement – how had it gotten so late? The amount of time he’d spent with Guzma was unexpected, seeing how he usually preferred to keep to himself, but somehow he found himself not minding the other at all. The Gryffindor was far more intelligent than Cyrus had initially given him credit for. They’d even…gotten along, really, and fairly well. They actually had, dare he say it, <em>fun</em> over the course of their studying. Despite the strangeness of the whole situation, the Ravenclaw found himself marginally upset that their time together had come to a close.</p><p>“Uh, so…I’ll…see ya tomorrow?” Guzma asked, haltingly, as they gathered up their study materials. The blue-haired teen took a moment to rearrange his books before responding.
</p><p>“...I suppose I can live with that.”</p><p>Guzma grinned barely hesitating for a split second before he leaned forward stealing a quick kiss on the cheek. “See ya tomorrow!” He called out, already bolting from the room.</p><p>Yes…Cyrus tried to ignore the too-obvious blush he just knew would be on his face. He supposed he could live with that.</p></div>
