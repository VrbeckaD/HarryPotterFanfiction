    <p>There were a lot of things Severus had to go through in his miserable life. Some which he had thought that he had escaped, like his obligation towards his mother. Sure, he loved her dearly and would’ve risked his own hide for her without a second thought. But when her sickness became too much and his drunkard of a father had used the little money they owned to buy more booze to get more drunk, instead of providing her the necessity of medical care, she finally died on her deathbed when Severus was well into his 3rd year. The news were painful and Lily and her family had taken care of him and helped him pick up the pieces.</p><p>The second obstacle he thought he had escaped was his own father. The beatings he had to endure almost every night and the neglect in which he had experienced since he was a toddler were almost tolerable when Eileen was still alive. But when his mother had kicked the bucket, he didn’t hesitate to leave his house at Spinner’s End and stayed at Hogwarts every summer holiday in the name of self-preservation.</p><p>The last horrid thing he also had to endure was during his time at Hogwarts. (“The safest place on earth.” Severus remembered how naïve he was, and because of that same naivety that he became the target of scorn and taunts from both the house of snakes and lions. He told himself everyday that he should’ve known better.) He almost hated his time at school, some days were bearable, especially when he had his Lily by his side, while other days his patience and tolerance were wearing thin and he gripped his wand until his knuckles turned white at every jeers and sneers and every single <strong><em>pranks</em></strong> the filthy <em><strong>pigs</strong></em> decided to play on him.</p><p>He has yet to escape them though, but he prayed, and prayed, and prayed that he will. But his stomach twisted almost painfully when he felt like there was a damnable force in his life that always pushes him and the Marauders together as if screaming at him that his future will revolve around them and escaping them would never come to fruit no matter what he does. He almost vomit his lunch at the Great Hall when he gave himself time to think about it and had to excuse himself when Regulus told him he looked a tad green. Madam Pomfrey said he had caught the stomach flu but he knew better.</p><p>When he turned fifteen, the pranks lessened until it was almost none existent. The Marauders no longer targeted him and by some miracle almost the entire student body stopped giving him looks of disdain and the name calling ceased completely (A Gryffindor had called him by his last name the other day and he almost dropped the mountains of books he was carrying for a joyful read by the lake out of shock. He didn’t know what he wanted from him because he immediately snapped his mouth closed and fled the scene before the other boy finished talking. It took him a couple more students to call him Snape instead of Snivellus that he realized that he wasn’t hallucinating or dreaming. He went to Madam Pomfrey that evening for incase.) He suspected that it was Lily’s doing since she loathed the way the Marauders treated him. She probably threatened them and it finally got drilled into their thick skulls. Severus asked her about it and she said that she hadn’t talked to any of them for months after they found out about her sexual orientation. Confused, Severus let it slide and lived his almost peaceful life as best he could.</p><p>He reprimanded himself once more and kept telling himself that <strong><em>he should’ve known</em> <em>better</em></strong> when Black led him towards the Shrieking Shack during his 6th year. He was already feeling shitty and was probably contemplating offing himself, and it was probably why he listened to Black’s directions to meet him near the Whomping Willow in the Forbidden Forest. Curiosity played a big role in it definitely, but a tiny part of him was seriously done with everything that had happened during the couple months of the start of the school year when he was told by his fellow Slytherins that he was expected to take the Dark Mark. The Marauders sets on targeting him once more with small pranking and mild taunting just to rile him up for a fight or two and that left him paranoid, afraid of getting ambushed in empty corridors like the old days.</p><p>He cursed himself and Black and the rest of the Marauders and even the whole damn school as he ran as fast as his legs can take him. He cursed Potter most of all at the moment as he was the one that is in the process of saving his life, dragging his feet like he was riding a broom during his Quiditch match and gripping Severus’ wrist like his life depended on it and squeezed hard enough that it might bruise for a couple of days. They didn’t stop running even when their lungs burned with the lack of oxygen and they didn’t chance a look behind knowing the Werewolf chasing them would easily catch up if they slowed down even a tiny bit.</p><p>Severus’ mind was reeling and he almost tripped a couple times if not for Potter’s strong hold of him. He thought that Potter should’ve just let go of him and save his own life since Black was the one that sent him down there. It puzzled him that Potter looked desperate on keeping him alive as if he didn’t want him dead, not that he thought Potter bode well with the idea of being a murderer but it’s more the fact that Potter had told him that his mere existence bugged the hell out of him one too many times before and he expected Potter to turn a blind eye and deaf ears to Black’s actions, much like Lupin had been when his imbecilic friends bullied him to hell and back in the past. If he was questioned, he could’ve just said he had tried to save him and slipped during the run and Severus got mauled to pieces because of it.</p><p>If Potter did land in Azkaban, he could probably still save himself from it with his wealth and family connections. He didn’t know how the Aurors here work but there were still policemen that accepted bribery to do one’s dirty work for them in the muggle world. He’s sure they’re no different here too. Severus was tempted to let go just to get the satisfaction of the off chance that they do land in Azkaban and the Aurors here are far more competent than the muggle police force. But then he’s far too stubborn to let them get the satisfaction of his death in their hands, which was the reason why he’s bolting through the heavy forest to get to the Headmaster for protection.</p><p>¤</p><p>Severus was seething in his seat, face flushed red and hands gripping the sides of his seat as if the cool metal stool could calm down the fire raging within him in dangerous blazes of rude remarks and hurtful to the bones words. He bit his tongue to not lash out at the Headmaster and his blatant show of favoritism towards his own House. “Young Sirius shall receive his due punishment, Severus.” Dumbledore’s fatherly voice shot through his growing migraine and made it worse by the second. “I’m not quite sure how a month worth of detention and benching him off the Quiditch team is an appropriate punishment for <strong><em>attempted</em> <em>murder</em></strong>, Headmaster Dumbledore,” he spat and abruptly stood up, his chair knocked down with a loud clang from the sudden force. “and I can’t believe you let that – that,” his hands flew around in search of a better word, “that <strong><em>monster</em></strong> stay here!”</p><p>“He’s not a monster!” Black stood up too, quick to defend his friend, and leveled Severus with a glare in which he returned with the same amount of ferocity.</p><p>“Funny. I’m not talking about Lupin, Black.” He snarled, hand reaching into his robes for his wand, “I know a werewolf can’t stop himself once they transform, it’s common knowledge but I’m sure you know about it when you sent me down there to kill me off. You on the other hand, had all the control over your mind and body,” his brow twitched when he noticed Black was inching towards his wand too, “but then again, you have the Black’s blood running in your veins. There’s a muggle saying, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Guess someone inherent mommy dearest’s insanity.”</p><p>“Why you snivelling –“ Black had gripped his wand first and aimed it directly towards Severus’ throat with a hex at the tip of his tongue. Severus on the other hand, refused to take out his wand and chose to hold it tightly within his robes. He raised a brow at the wand and stared back at Black’s grey eyes to make a point of his earlier accusation. He deemed himself the victor when Black’s face flushed in obvious anger when he realized he had given ammunition to his enemy.</p><p>“That’s enough Mr. Black!” both students flinched and finally remembered where they were. Black’s eyes flitted briefly towards Potter, who, to Severus’ surprise, is standing much closer to him now with his wand at the ready by his side.</p><p>Potter shook his head once and Black lowered his wand. Severus mentally snorted, ‘mangy vile mutt.’</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat to gain their attention. “Now Severus, my boy, I would like to request you to not inform the whole student body of Remus’ odd… conditions.”</p><p>“<strong><em>What!?</em></strong>” the repressed fury came back in full as he looked at the old man incredulously, “You can’t be serious!? Lupin tried to <strong><em>kill</em></strong> me! Whether he wasn’t in his right mind or not, he’s a bloody werewolf. A dark creature that has no jurisdiction over his primal instinct even if it’s just once a month! And you’re letting such a creature to live among students who doesn’t know better. If <strong><em>Potter</em></strong>,” he uttered the name as if it was a curse, “hadn’t come, I would’ve –“</p><p>“Mr. Snape, you will not use such a tone towards your professor.” He hadn’t realized he was practically screaming by now. He gritted his teeth shut. Dumbledore gave him a look like a father reprimanding his child and Severus felt himself become small, flashbacks to where his real father hated how he disrespected him, but at least the Headmaster didn’t take out a belt as his weapon of choice to instill manners into others with a merciless hard smack to the back until they’re broken and bloody. For a moment, Severus silently thanked the little things in his life.</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat again, “Now Mr. Snape,” another look, “I know that your first encounter with a werewolf has left you on edge and slightly in hysterics. Mr. Black shall receive his adequate punishment in due time for his actions. I don’t see it fair for Mr. Lupin to leave Hogwarts and strip him of his chance to live a normal school life if you were to tell the other students when he clearly wasn’t at fault. Mr. Black had admitted his fault and had regretted his decision in endangering another student over a simple prank gone wrong. Surely you should be the better person and forgive him?” Dumbledore’s smile was kind, but Severus saw the glint in his eyes. A demand, not a request.</p><p>Severus’ throat constricted, “And if I don’t? if I chose to tell everyone?” it wasn’t like the others would believe him anyways – but Lily and Regulus probably would, at least that’s something comforting to know.</p><p>The man sighed and spoke lowly, “Then I shall have no choice but to punish you for disobeying a direct order from me with expulsion.”</p><p>He didn’t know what happened, but after Dumbledore said what he said, he saw red. His chest burned and he was clenching and unclenching his fists, trying his hardest to reign his anger. But it burned and burned and burned every fiber of his being and he’s so fed up with everything that had happened, tired and angry and bitter over everything that had led him here. He resented everything and everyone in his life. The stress over the months – over the <strong><em>years</em></strong> – had somehow finally caught up to him and combined with today’s event made that scorching and dark feeling intensified tenfold from his head to the tip of his toes. He always had a temper, had embedded himself with the feeling of pure hate because hate was all he knew. He grew up with hate. So that’s what he’s going to do.</p><p>“EXPEL ME THEN YOU FUCKING CRAZY BIASED OLD COOT!” he roared with all the fury his body provided. “YOU PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A TEACHER. YOU ALWAYS SIDE WITH THE GRYFFINDORS WHILE OTHERS SUFFER FROM YOUR DECISION! CAN’T EVEN CONTROL YOUR DAMN MUTTS WITHOUT THEM TRYING TO KILL A STUDENT. OPEN YOUR BLOODY EYES AND LOOK AROUND YOU. <strong><em>YOUR</em></strong> STUDENTS HAVE BEEN TORMENTING EVERYONE! AND YOU DEFEND THEM LIKE THEY’RE SAINTS! WELL I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, YOU INCOMPETENT OLD SWINE. I DON’T BLAME SOME OF US WHO SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO VOLDERMORT. AT THE RATE YOU’RE SHITTING OUT OF YOUR ARSE, I ‘D PROBABLY TAKE THE DARK MARK JUST TO SPITE YOU. YOU FUCKING CUNT. YOU FUCKING <strong><em>DOUCHEBAG</em></strong>.” His ears were ringing, his throat hurts from the shouting and he balanced himself with his hands gripping the Headmaster’s desk, digging his nails into the wood and he was certain that it would leave a crescent mark but he didn’t care. He stopped caring about anything anymore.</p><p>The room was shocked into silence from Severus’ furious outbursts. The two boys next to him just stared at him as if he has gone mad – who knows, maybe he did – and the looks from the Headmaster was priceless, and if Severus wasn’t so livid, he would’ve bursts out laughing. Unfortunately, he was still seeing red and he still felt like someone casted fiendfyre inside his very being. So he ploughed through.</p><p>“AND YOU!” he whipped around to face Potter, robes billowing behind him, making a sharp snap in his wake. The bespectacled boy tensed when the cold obsidian eyes stared up at him. “I’m tired with you and your shit. With your stupid fucking pranks for only an idiotic Gryffindor can pull. Only someone who has half a brain to consume his time with meaningless bullshit. You and your whore of a best friend, you and your disgusting pet wolf, you and your putrid rat. I’m sick of it. <strong><em>Sick</em></strong>. <strong><em>Of</em></strong>. <em><strong>All</strong></em>. <strong><em>Of</em></strong>. <strong><em>It</em></strong>.” He jabbed a finger into his chest hard to emphasize his every word. He reveled in the pained wince from Potter for a second, then gave him the nastiest sneer he could muster, “You’ve won. You’ve finally broke Snivellus. Finally made him snap. Congratulations, you arrogant swine. I’ll be more than happy to stop existing from your life. Be damn happy to leave! Being a bloody wizard is not worth this much agony.” It is worth it. However, he couldn’t take another second with them any longer.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact from Potter’s hazel eyes, he spat, “Headmaster, I wish to leave Hogwarts for good.” Dumbledore, finally awaken from his stupor, spluttered as a response.</p><p>“Severus, my boy, I think you should calm down first before you make rash decisions you surely regret.” Dumbledore’s plea was met with deaf ears.</p><p>His sneer deepened and in a fit of blind rage, he continued to let his emotions move him into action. The black haired boy fished out his wand, gripping both ends with his hands and lowered it onto his thigh with as much strength his lithe body could make and successfully snapped his wand into two. The boy in front of him gawked at him in disbelief and horror. “I can’t continue my studies without a wand, Headmaster Dumbledore. I cannot afford another one, therefore, you have to let me leave this school.” He turned his head towards the old man and drawled menacingly, “Or if that’s not enough, I will tell the students about you hoarding a dangerous creature in a school with far too many students with renowned and influential family. Imagine the chaos that will ensue.”</p><p>Dumbledore clicked his jaw and his face turned grim. “Very well, Severus. If that’s what you want. I shall have a train ready by tomorrow morning for your departure.”</p><p>Severus nodded, “Thank you, Professor Dumbledore.” He threw away the broken wands onto the ground and shot a hateful glare towards the two Marauders, “Have fun celebrating my leave. You earned it.” With that said, he confidently strode out with his crooked nose pointed into the air.</p><p>¤</p><p>Severus stepped into the morning train with his trunk with begrudging difficulty. He doesn’t have his wand anymore so he couldn’t shrink his trunk and stuff it in his pockets like he used to. The memory of yesterday evening still lingered at the back of his head. He could feel the ugly bile of regret and depression came back crawling and clawing at the back of his throat and threatening him to release a frustrated scream and a desperate sob, but he stayed strong. He didn’t dare to look back at the Headmaster and Deputy Headmistress of his former school because if he did, he might begged them to take him back.</p><p>Severus inwardly laughed bitterly at the idea of him begging for forgiveness and repenting over his own actions. He did regret what he had done, and cursed himself up and down for letting his emotions overrode his rational thinking. But Severus is nothing but prideful. He’d rather leave with the little bit of dignity he has left than staying with none.</p><p>As he stuffed his trunk in an empty carriage, he recalled yesterday’s event. The consequence of his actions had hit him hard like a pile of bricks and it almost pushed him into the brink of a panic attack in the middle of the Slytherin’s common room. He willed the panic away as best he could and started on packing. He didn’t let himself think about it until the next morning when he walked out from Hogwarts’ ground and met the ancient Headmaster waiting for him to send him off.</p><p>He sighed long and loud as he rubbed his tired face. He didn’t even tell Lily and Regulus of his leave. Lily would be so mad when she visits Spinner’s End during the holidays later and he was sure they’re going to start another fight. And Regulus… well, he doesn’t think he’ll ever see him again anywhere in his future though. He cursed his life and the people in it for the umpteenth time within the few hours since he woke up. Lily and Regulus were the only source of happiness he had left since his mother died, but now, he had fucked himself over and ruined the only good thing in his life. And for what? Giving Potter and his insolent gang their victory in exchange for them to leave him the hell alone for the rest of his life, only to send himself into another jaw of death in the hands of his father back home in Cokeworth?</p><p>He hasn’t seen his father for almost 3 years. He doubted that he’d be happy to see him back just to tell him that he quit school. Maybe he would. He could just tell him that he’s no longer a wizard anymore since he can’t do magic without his wand – though he could do wandless magic but he could stop himself from doing them – and with enough time, he could even forget that he was once a wizard and that there’s another mythical world within the world he’s already living in. Maybe he could even tell his father that he had succeeded beating the <em><strong>freakiness</strong></em> out of him. And maybe, his father would look at him like how he had looked at him before his magic manifested – with love and not hate, with kindness and not fear, with unbridled tenderness and not rage. He could have a normal life. One of a muggle.</p><p>He frowned, perhaps that’s where he was supposed to be. He’s a half-blood, meaning he had the choice from the beginning to choose to stay as a muggle or stay as a wizard. Being a wizard, he thought in despair, had caused all the problems in his life. Had made his father a raging and hateful monster that had landed hits and kicks and hurtful insults to his own wife and only son. Had made him go to Hogwarts and left his mother in the hands of his father and died because he wasn’t there to take care of her. Had him sorted into Slytherin, only to be bullied by so many houses because he was different no matter where he goes. If he had chosen wisely, if he hadn’t accepted the letter, maybe he could be happy – <strong><em>happier</em></strong>.</p><p>He sat for what felt like hours in the carriage, thinking and wondering about the what-ifs, plaguing his mind with unnecessary sadness and longing. He didn’t hear the carriage door opening and closing until he saw a concerned looking messy-haired boy sitting across from him. He blinked owlishly, his mind was still blurry and when he finally focused, his hands clenched and he barely held himself from strangling the occupant in front of him.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing here Potter? Come to gloat over your success?”</p><p>The boy flinched from the amount of venom in Severus’ voice, and after a moment of unsure silence, he gave him a tentative smile.</p><p>“No. I…” he looked around the carriage awkwardly, his confidence diminishing.</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Severus wanted to throw something at him but he doesn’t have anything on his being except for the clothes on his back so he settled with a snarl.</p><p>“I said get out. The train is about to move and you’re still here.”</p><p>Potter looked down dejectedly, “O-oh.” He still didn’t move from his seat but instead played around with something in his robe.</p><p><em>Probably his wand</em>, Severus thought angrily, unwanted memory of the feeling of his own wand snapping into two zooming past his mind like a fleeting thought. He probably came here to hex him to bits since he’s now defenseless in every sense of the word. Severus harrumphed and quickly stood up to go find another empty carriage to brood in.</p><p>Before Severus could reach the door, he was immediately stopped by a hand on his wrist, "I’m sorry.” Potter’s voice was uncharacteristically soft and gentle and he sounded like he was close to crying but Severus couldn’t give two shits about his sudden apology and roughly pushed him away. Potter’s head slammed onto the train’s window harshly and that would’ve made Severus smile but God, he needed a way to dispel his anger.</p><p>“YOU DON’T GET TO BE SORRY!” Severus wanted to cry, to scream, to cut himself so that the rage burning in him could find a way to get out because it was too suffocating and he wanted to strangle himself more than he wanted to strangle Potter. To end it all because he suddenly couldn’t breathe and everything felt like a terrible nightmare rewinding itself over and over and he’s too exhausted to even stand. He pressed himself against the carriage door.</p><p>“ALL YOU’VE EVER DONE IS RUIN MY LIFE SINCE OUR FIRST YEAR. 6 FUCKING YEARS OF TORMENT AND HUMILATION FROM YOU AND YOUR PESTS, YOU DON’T GET TO BE SORRY FOR ALL THE THINGS YOU’VE DONE!”</p><p>Potter moved hesitantly towards him, hands in the air to cup Severus’ face and wipe away the tears. Severus recoiled from his touch as if burnt and violently shoved him to the ground. Using the distraction, with unsteady hands, he unceremoniously threw the door open and fled into an empty carriage at the far end of the train. Once inside and the door is locked, Severus unwillingly admitted that he was indeed crying and sobbing and Potter had finally won the entire war they both had for he had shown his enemy his weakness. He broke down silently and hoped that the pain would end.</p><p>¤</p><p>Severus’ idled mind failed to notice that the train was finally moving and it had probably been moving for the past hours until they arrived at the train station. Deeming it safe to leave the safety of the carriage, he went back to grab the trunk he had left. He peeked through the window to see if Potter was still there or not, and when there was no sign of him, he carefully slid the door open and grabbed his trunk.</p><p>But before he could, his eyes caught sight of 2 familiar wooden stick and a piece of paper at the seat where he previously sat on. He scowled at it and paid no heed of its existence and made to exit.</p><p>He stopped half way out the door and hesitantly looked back. He couldn’t just leave it there. It’s trash and he couldn’t just leave garbage laying around, where was his manners? He reasoned.</p><p>Moving back into the carriage, he paused to just stare at it. A shaky sigh escaped him and he gently grabbed his broken wand, relishing at the tiniest feathery touch of magic coursing through it. Said magic would be gone within a few days or so, he was sure.</p><p>He pocketed the wand and turned to the note. He didn’t want to take it with him though. It must’ve been from Potter, he thought to himself, it would be foolish to accept anything from him – except his own wand of course.</p><p>He was about to turn around and leave it when the train conductor saw him still lounging in the carriage. “What are you still doing here lad? You ought to move now. The train waits for no one!” he said but not unkindly. “And please don’t leave your trash around either.”</p><p><em>Dammit</em>.</p><p>“Yes, of course, my apologies.” He gave the note another distrustful glare until he warily took it and shoved it inside his pocket. He’ll throw it away at a nearby trash can as fast as he could, and heaved his trunk out into the warm air of King’s Cross Station.</p>
