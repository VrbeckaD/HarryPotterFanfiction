<p align="center">Lily is not paid enough for this </p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Lily knew Severus would feel trapped, but she still didn’t let him know Sirius and Remus would be here. After the events of the last school year, they needed to get together and exchange information.</p>
<p>Severus arrived by Floo. He spent the few weeks of his summer holiday at his cottage and agreed to spend a week with Lily and Harry before returning to the castle. She should have given him a heads up, but she was afraid Severus would back down.</p>
<p>Sirius and Remus were chatting quietly in the kitchen. Lily noticed they were acting weird around each other ever since Christmas, but she couldn’t exactly say what caused it. Sirius was pulling away, obvious enough for her to see. He even tried to set Remus up on a date, needless to say that went bad for all involved.</p>
<p>She hated to get Severus in the middle of that, but it was necessary. Harry was away, spending the day with Narcissa and Draco, so today was the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>Severus appeared at exactly the time he mentioned in his latter.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lils,” He gave her a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sev. How was your summer?”</p>
<p>“Peaceful, thank you. Yours?”</p>
<p>“You know, never a dull moment with Harry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he seems to attract… trouble.”</p>
<p>“That is what we wanted to talk about actually.”</p>
<p>“We?” Severus’s tone turned a few degrees colder.</p>
<p>“Remus and Sirius are here,” She said looking down.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Only for today to dissect what happened at the end of the school year,” Lily defended.</p>
<p>“It is nice to know your merry group still finds me… useful,” his tone was biting.</p>
<p>“We never asked you to do that in the war.”</p>
<p>“No, but it sure helped.”</p>
<p>“What helped was you coming clean and telling us about the prophecy. What helped was you researching the blood magic with me.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t lose you… or leave your safety in someone else’s hands… Not even Dumbledore’s.”</p>
<p>“And you did save us… Without your help then… This is why I believe you want to keep Harry safe. Someone after the stone is not personal, but Voldermort being involved is.”</p>
<p>“Fine, I can go and talk to them now,” He sighed.</p>
<p>“Thank you!” She smiled warmly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius and Remus were sitting a bit farther from each other than usual sipping their tea. They both jumped when Severus and Lily walked in.</p>
<p>“Tell us everything you can remember,” Sirius demanded.</p>
<p>Lily was ready to chasten him, but Severus complied before she got the chance.</p>
<p>She took a seat while Severus spun his tale.</p>
<p>“And he just left?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“He was in no state to confront Dumbledore,” Severus explained.</p>
<p>“What did he want from Harry? He didn’t have the stone,” Sirius asked glaring at no one in particular.</p>
<p>“From what Dumbledore said, the Stone would reveal itself to the person that didn’t want to use it.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you have it?” Sirius raised his head challenging.</p>
<p>“Because I wanted something more and the mirror latched to that,” Severus explained avoiding their eyes.</p>
<p>“What?” Sirius asked.</p>
<p>“Not your business, Black,” Severus snapped.</p>
<p>“We need to trust you now, so tell us everything we need to know.”</p>
<p>“Merlin! Let the man keep his privacy, Sirius,” Remus intervened.</p>
<p>Sirius opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>Severus nodded to Remus.</p>
<p>“The Stone was safely destroyed at the end of the school year,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I read about Flamel and his wife deaths in the Prophet,” Lily chipped in.</p>
<p>“But is there something else that he can use? Can unicorn blood sustain him long term?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Not without a body to letch on,” Sirius answers.</p>
<p>“Is he strong enough to bond to someone else like he did with Quirell?” Lily asks.</p>
<p>“I felt him being quite weak, so maybe not. He did say most of his followers abandoned him.”</p>
<p>“Can this story make more of them look for him?” Remus asked biting his lip.</p>
<p>“Not many purebloods are willing to give their bodies to him. Besides, the full story is still a secret,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“But can he return?” Lily asks in the silence that fallowed.</p>
<p>“It will take a lot of dark magic… I do not know any ritual that can do this…” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“His soul remained here… how? Do you think he has the Stone?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“The Peverell stone?” Sirius caught his train of thought. “We know two of them are real, so the third must be as well…”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t the stone return him immediately?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“Not if you have that much blood on your hands,” Sirius debated.</p>
<p>“But why is he back in such a weak state?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Maybe some part of his soul was already gone at the time of his death. There are a lot of dark rituals for that…”</p>
<p>“You would know,” Severus couldn’t help himself to add.</p>
<p>Sirius rose from his chair and made a move for his wand, but Remus got it first.</p>
<p>“Lily,” Remus sighed and she grabbed Severus’s wand too.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Severus complained.</p>
<p>“Better to make sure,” Lily added. “Can he fully return?”</p>
<p>“I do not know… It took him 10 years last time,” Severus answered.</p>
<p>“Should we talk to the Order?” Lily asked the room.</p>
<p>“It’s too soon, we have nothing concrete,” Remus said.</p>
<p>“But it’s always good to keep an eye out… Maybe cast stronger wards,” Sirius said looking at Lily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you are staying still, right?” Lily asked Severus.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Great, we can work on them while you are here.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure…” Sirius started.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Lily glared at her friend.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sirius raised his hands in the air.</p>
<p>“We should….” Remus started, but caught himself and stopped. “I have a tutoring in 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>“A lot of pureblood families, from what I heard,” Severus commented.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s the house,” Remus said embarrassed.</p>
<p>“The black magic within attracts all the pureblood,” Sirius joked. “I’ll go with you,” He said and rose from his chair.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Madame Greengrass always asks about you anyway,” Remus said with badly conceived venom.</p>
<p>“I should get a percent then – from bringing you customers.”</p>
<p>“The mascots are not usually paid,” Severus said drily.</p>
<p>Both Remus and Lily started laughing, but Sirius glared at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lily was making dinner when the Floo flared. She got her wand out, but Severus beat her to it. Harry’s messy hair popped from the fireplace. He looked sad and marched straight to her.</p>
<p>“What is wrong, baby?” She lowers her wand instantly.</p>
<p>“Draco won’t talk to me. He keeps writing to his pureblood friends and ignores me.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to talk to him?” Lily asked petting his hair.</p>
<p>“I… just want my friend back,” Harry whispered.</p>
<p>Lily caught Severus’s eyes over her son’s head and they look especially guilty. Lily hugged her son and gave him some hot chocolate to cheer him up. She fire called Narcissa to let her know he was alright, since he just took the Floo on his own from their house without letting anyone know.</p>
<p>After dinner, Severus was quick to help her wash and move over to their guess room.</p>
<p>“What have you done?” She sighed staring at her best friend.</p>
<p>“I may… had a talk with young Black,” Severus said.</p>
<p>“A talk about what?” Lily glared.</p>
<p>“Being a Slytherin.”</p>
<p>“Have you, in any way shape or form, caused this rapture between them?” Lily’s tone was icy.</p>
<p>“Unknowingly and unwillingly.”</p>
<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>
<p>“That he needs to befriend more pureblood Slytherins and build himself a protection from bullies. And it worked, he is not bullied anymore!” Severus was quick to point out.</p>
<p>“But he also lost his best friend in the process!”</p>
<p>“Draco looks happier, maybe only Harry is the one that is suffering… and besides Harry has plenty of other friends,” Severus said.</p>
<p>“Not this important!”</p>
<p>“They do not seem to like each other very much… Draco seems exasperated by his presence!”</p>
<p>“Because this is how their friendship works!”</p>
<p>“If you and Narcissa are friends, your sons do not have to!”</p>
<p>Lily glared.</p>
<p>“You do not get to destroy a good friendship again.”</p>
<p>“We came out good in the end,” Severus sighed.</p>
<p>“After we went through literal hell together!” Lily said her voice breaking. “I do not want my son to go through anything that we did…”</p>
<p>“I will fix it!” He said putting a calming hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Lily nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>To cheer a mopping Harry up, Lily and Severus took him to the Burrow the next day to see Ron and the other Weasleys.</p>
<p>Lily always liked Molly and Arthur’s home. It was cozy and felt like theirs to the core. It was also a magic house, but younger than Sirius’s and not filled with so much black magic.</p>
<p>They arrived at breakfast, the dining room was hectic. The table was filled and overflowing almost. Molly was still putting things down from the kitchen. The twins were laughing over something in a corner; Percy was having another one all to himself, filled with textbooks by the look of it. Arthur was drinking his coffee while reading the paper and Ron was struggling to stay awake, his hair sticking in all direction. Lily couldn’t see Ginny yet, so she assumed the girl was still sleeping.</p>
<p>“Good morning!” Molly smiled cheerful and ruffled Harry’s hair.</p>
<p>“Morning!” There was a chorus from various people in the room.</p>
<p>“Breakfast?”  Molly asked.</p>
<p>“No, thanks, we ate just before…” Lily started, but Harry plunked himself at the table and grabbed a plate.</p>
<p>Lily glared at her son.</p>
<p>“He is a growing boy,” Molly said squeezing her shoulder. “Coffee, Severus?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” he said politely.</p>
<p>A pair of small feet was heard noisily coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Mum, have you seen my red sweater?” Ginny asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear it was on the cat,” Molly said pouring Severus his coffee.</p>
<p>“You didn’t say we had guests,” Ginny said turning bright red. “And Harry too…” She ran up the stairs.</p>
<p>Harry continued to whisper with Ron not noticing.</p>
<p>Lily threw a questioning look at Molly.</p>
<p>“She got to the stage,” Molly shrugged.</p>
<p>“Harry?” Lily asked surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, mum?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, honey,” she shook her head. Her son, the heartbreaker.</p>
<p>The breakfast was a loud affair, Harry seemed to fit right in and soak into the chaos though.</p>
<p>“Can we celebrate my birthday here this year?” Harry suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“We do not want to impose on Molly and Arthur” Lily chided.</p>
<p>“But we have a pitch in the back; we can all play Quiddich after,” Ron piped in.</p>
<p>“It’s really no trouble! The house seems quieter now without Bill and Charlie anyway,” Molly said sad.</p>
<p>“Quieter!?” Lily saw Severus mutter.</p>
<p>“If ii’s really no trouble…”</p>
<p>“It will be our pleasure,” Molly smiles brightly.</p>
<p>“Yes!” The boys high-fived each other.</p>
<p>“We will make you the best firework show ever,” Fred and George said in creepily unison.</p>
<p>“If anything catches fire like last time…” Molly pointed a finger at them.</p>
<p>“We perfected the formula” Fred said serious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lily woke Harry up with a kiss on his forehead. She had breakfast pancakes waiting for him downstairs. Severus was drinking his tea in the kitchen, feeling a bit awkward from what Lily could tell, but he never missed one of Harry’s birthdays and he sure wouldn’t start now.</p>
<p>Harry jumped out of bed, very excited and ready to start the day. Lily had her and Severus’s birthday present ready to give him, before they get to the Burrow. Harry had been asking more questions about James lately, so Lily gifted him a photo album filled with pictures of James. Photos from the Potter’s family album, photos Sirius and Remus had from school and early family photos Lily had, even some with Harry.</p>
<p>Severus was out when they got in, but Lily was sure he didn’t make a run for it, although she did suspected it. Harry was happily munching on his pancakes talking a mile-a-minute about his plans with Ron for the day.</p>
<p>Severus arrived caring a lot of packages; owl post had arrived by the looks of it. Harry got many presents from his friends this year. He seemed to be a popular kid.</p>
<p>Harry abandoned his breakfast and started unwrapping them, throwing paper everywhere in his wake. He got a lot of sweets by the looks of it, that nice girl Hermione gave him a quill, her sister’s present was terrible as always…. Harry didn’t seem surprised, or disappointed which was a good thing.</p>
<p>She slipped in her own present while Harry was busy demolishing the other ones. When Harry opened it he gasped, he rose, putting neatly his treasures on the table and taking the photo album to the couch. He saw pictures of James before, but never all of them in one place. It took her a while to gather all of them, more so from the now deserted Potter estate.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Harry said in a chocked voice.</p>
<p>“How about you go to your room with that and I clean up here?”</p>
<p>He nodded and made his way out not taking his eyes from the album.</p>
<p>Lily started cleaning, just to get her hands busy. She knew she did the right thing, but somehow going through the entire album still hurt her, more than she thought it would.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Severus asked.</p>
<p>She jumped; he was so quiet, for a moment she even forgot he was here.</p>
<p>“I will be,” she said schooling her features. “I should be at some point, right?”</p>
<p>“It is not a race, Lils,” Severus’s voice was soft.</p>
<p>“I know,” she sighed. “I just wish… It’s not a great start for a birthday, is it?”</p>
<p>“It is good for him to get to know James… especially at his age.”</p>
<p>“What did you got him?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“Some book on Quiddich strategy since he seemed interested.”</p>
<p>“He will like that,” She smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“He is not very pretentious, but then again, I do compete with a tooth pick”</p>
<p>Lily laughed.</p>
<p>“I swear to Merlin she either forgets and sends whatever is in her house at that time or her poor kid has terrible birthdays.”</p>
<p>Severus smiled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They get to the Burrow just after noon. The Wesley’s were waiting by the Floo. Ron jumped and tackled Harry as soon as they were out of the chimney. Lily laughed and stepped past the tangle of giggles and limbs.</p>
<p> She brought the cake this time, not of her own making though, as baking had never been her strong point, but one from a muggle bakery she and Narcissa really liked. Molly as always had outdone herself in preparing the food for dinner, Lily did offer help, but was promptly shut down.</p>
<p>Remus and Sirius arrived next. Remus was cranky and his eyes were more yellow than usual. Tomorrow was a full moon and he already felt the effects. Sirius stack very close to him and tried to run interference and keep very talkative people away from Remus. Lily watched them with a sad smile on her face for one of her best friends.</p>
<p>Remus had been in love with Sirius for so long is not even funny, even James knew about it. They used to talk about it, about how Sirius dated all the popular girls, but never too long, how he dropped everything for his friends. They hoped he felt the same, but you could never tell with Sirius.</p>
<p>Due to his childhood and family, Sirius didn’t cope well with feelings and showing his emotions. Lily didn’t even know if he liked her or hated her for years till James actually said it for him. Remus was not easy to read either, but Lily acted as his confidant for years, so it was heard not to see it now.</p>
<p>Last year, Lily thought Sirius actually was in love with Remus, but then he started setting his friend out on dates and flirting again… She really thought it would be better for them to stop living together, only if she could get that past Remus’s love sick brain.</p>
<p>Sirius put a present in the pile, the biggest and fanciest box as usual. Remus rolled his eyes affectionately and put his own present in. They would be such a good couple… if only, Lily sighed. She walked over to them and handed Remus a cup of tea. He smiled to her thankful.</p>
<p>Sirius escorted him to the living room and hovered over him as he took a seat on the couch. Sirius Black, the mother hen. Harry ran to his godfather and hugged him tight, then patted Remus’s shoulder. Lily’s heart filled with affection for her son, Sirius beamed in a corner.</p>
<p>The other people invited were Draco and Narcissa. They arrived a few minutes after everyone. Narcissa greeted the hosts and put her present in the pile. Draco didn’t seem very happy to be here.</p>
<p>Lily signaled Severus and he made his way to his godson. Draco looked pleased to see him at least and the two struck a conversation that lasted most of the evening. Lily hoped Severus could get some sense into the kid.</p>
<p>The dinner was delicious as expected of Molly’s cooking. Harry blew out the candles and opened some presents. A new sweater from Molly, a Quiddich book from Ron, some muggle novels from Remus and a… girl’s uniform kit from Sirius?</p>
<p>Lily turned to Sirius.</p>
<p>“It’s for your little rebellion, I thought it’s better to have your own than keep barrowing them.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed and hugged his godfather. He thanked everyone else for their presents.</p>
<p>“We will gift you…” Fred started.</p>
<p>“The firework show at the end of the night,” George ended the sentence.</p>
<p>“How about some Quiddich now?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Harry grinned widely.</p>
<p>The twins rose from their seats as well.</p>
<p>“I want to play too!” Ginny said glaring daringly at her brothers.</p>
<p>“But, you are a g… small,” Ron said.</p>
<p>Molly glared at him.</p>
<p>“Fine, but we are not going easy on you!”</p>
<p>“Draco, do you want to play?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Draco said after a pause.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Sirius talked over him.</p>
<p>Draco glared.</p>
<p>“You are too young for teenage tantrums, go and have some fun!” Sirius sighed glaring at Draco.</p>
<p>The young Black jumped from his chair and followed the others out.</p>
<p>“So I assume your talk didn’t work?” Lily asked Severus.</p>
<p>“I did try… He said he is happier with his new friends.”</p>
<p>“He is not though… I haven’t seen his real smile this summer, no matter how much Parkinson or Zabini visit,” Narcissa said.</p>
<p>“We better go and watch over them,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Lily turned to him surprised.</p>
<p>“Fred and George are playing… Harry is… smaller than them,” He defended.</p>
<p>“Oh, daddy Padfoot,” Remus teased.</p>
<p>Sirius blushed faintly and then hid it under his Pureblood mask.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” he said instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They played three on three. With a Seeker, a Beater and a Chaser in each team, it was a mess and everyone invented rules, but they seemed to have a good time. It was a weird dynamic with the twins in different teams. But the real surprise came from little Ginny. She not only flown beautifully, she was faster than any of the boys and delivered the most goals.</p>
<p>And then the snitch got released and Harry and Draco just shot up after it. Harry was good as usually, but Draco… Draco was in tune with his every move, following his every step. She saw Harry play before and she never did like Quiddich, but even for her, Draco was a fairly good seeker, more competition for Harry than most of the official seekers in the other teams.</p>
<p>“Draco is good,” Sirius said proud.</p>
<p>“I actually asked him to trial for the team”, Severus said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that Harry’s job?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Some healthy competition…  if we take the amount of detention he got last year as an indicator, back-up may be in order,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“Speaking of… A girl’s uniform!?” Lily turned to Sirius.</p>
<p>“You know the girls have no trousers for their Hogwarts uniform, right?” Sirius asked her instead.</p>
<p>“Obviously,” Lily glared.</p>
<p>“Well, so does Harry and he is not happy about it,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“You are enabling him,” Lily sighed.</p>
<p>“I am supporting a revolution” Sirius winked.</p>
<p>Draco’s team won; neither caught the snitch, so the game was won because of Ginny. But Draco had the hugest smile on and Harry was beaming. Fred and George did deliver on their promise of the best firework show. Even Sirius was impressed and went to congratulate them after the game.</p>
<p>Lily didn’t hear their conversation only a loud scream at some point of:</p>
<p>“You are Padfoot!?” coming from Fred she assumes followed by “And that is Moony!?” from George.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She did try to get out of going to Diagon Ally this year, but unfortunately someone covered her shift for her and there were no excuses left. Severus was going to leave this morning as well and she was not very happy about that either. It had been nice to have some company that was not under the age of 13.</p>
<p>They all had breakfast together, Harry the only cheerful one at the table. Severus ate n silence and insisted on washing the dishes after everyone was done.</p>
<p>They all walked towards the Floo, the Potters to go to the shopping district and the potion teacher to return to Hogwarts. Severus hugged her awkwardly and pated Harry’s hair before going through the flames.</p>
<p>Lily took a deep breath and Floo’s herself and her son. The Weasley clan was waiting for them at the Leaky Cauldron, which was a plus, but didn’t make Lily any less worried.</p>
<p>The streets were crowded, but mostly people leave them alone. Everyone seemed to be heading towards Flourish and Blots though. They got all the new items on the list, but had the books left for last.</p>
<p>“We need to go in at some point,” Harry said staring at Lily.</p>
<p>“I know…” She sighed. “How important is Care for Magic Creatures though?”</p>
<p>Harry glared at her.</p>
<p>“I really want to get Lockhart’s autograph,” Molly said excited. “Do you know he is teaching Defense this year?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you know him!? He was a lot younger than me.”</p>
<p>“He was a few years younger than us… Used to hang around us a lot…” Lily frowned.</p>
<p>“Was he as handsome and brave?” Molly asked.</p>
<p>“You can say that…” Lily hesitated.</p>
<p>“Mum, quit stalling, we have to go,” Harry said from the door of the shop.</p>
<p>Lily sighed and followed. The little shop was busting with people like an overfilled kettle.</p>
<p>The Potters made their way to the school book section while Molly and Ginny waited in line for the autograph. Ron tagged along with them, while Fred and George had mysteriously vanished as soon as they made their way in.</p>
<p>“Sirius, no!”</p>
<p>Lily perked up at the familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Did they follow us again?” Lily asked Harry.</p>
<p>“But, Moony,” Sirius pleaded. “The<em> best way to kill a werewolf is with a wooden stake to the heart,” </em>Sirius reads from a large tome. “I will give him a stake to the heart,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“I said no, bad dog,” Remus reprimands and keep browsing.</p>
<p>“I have everything, you can stop embarrassing me now,” Draco’s voice whispered.</p>
<p>”Does young master Draco want Dobby to take the books back home?” a house elf voice asked.</p>
<p>“No, Dobby, thank you,” Draco answered. “I will carry everything alone. Meet me at home!”</p>
<p>The house elf disappeared with a loud pop.</p>
<p>“Sirius! Draco! Remus!” Harry said and sprinted towards them.</p>
<p>“That was in order of who he loved more,” Sirius winked at Remus.</p>
<p>“We didn’t follow you!” Remus greeted Lily.</p>
<p>“This time!” Sirius singsonged.</p>
<p>“Got everything already?” Lily asked Draco.</p>
<p>“Yes, the School section was pretty empty since everyone is crowding at the front,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Who is that guy?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“That, little pup is an a…” Sirius started, but Remus interrupted loudly.</p>
<p>“Absolute okay professor for Defense.”</p>
<p>“Go and get your books, boys,” Lily turned to Ron and Harry.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you got a house elf,” Lily turned to Draco.</p>
<p>“He is not mine... Dad left him for me for when I celebrated my 12<sup>th</sup> birthday,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Oh” Lily widened her eyes making eye contact with Sirius who shook his head.</p>
<p>“That is great,” She finished weakly.</p>
<p>“He is a menace though… Keeps saying I shouldn’t return to school, that I am in danger.”</p>
<p>“Considering Hogwarts’s past record, it is kind of a safe bet there,” Sirius muttered.</p>
<p>Remus glared at him.</p>
<p>“Especially since they get teachers like that” Lily gestured vaguely at the front of the room. “And they will keep getting them till some actual good people apply,” She said staring at Remus.</p>
<p>“I heard Lockhart was the only candidate this year,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Well, that explains a lot,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>Remus looked back at the shelves behind ignoring Lily’s eyes.</p>
<p>“We got everything,” Harry called running towards them with Ron in tow.</p>
<p>“As soon as I get out of here the better,” Lily called.</p>
<p> “Yeah, happy to leave this crowded hell,” Sirius sighed.</p>
<p>They got half way across the room, when Lockhart emerged at the little podium in front of the store. The crowd of witches, that was pretty calm up to that point, started pushing and prodding applauding loudly and cheering.</p>
<p>Lily lost all focus on the Glamor spell, but she hoped no one would notice. She used it every time she went out, but since she didn’t actually have a social life, that was not very often.</p>
<p>“Lily Evans!” The annoying voice thundered.</p>
<p>The crowd stopped in mesmerizing synchrony. They got near the front now and the public cleared to leave only their little circle in an isolated island.</p>
<p>“And young Potter as well!”</p>
<p>The group turned towards Lockhart’s stage.</p>
<p>“Oh my, my friends, Sirius Black and…” Lockhart stared for a few seconds at Remus.</p>
<p>“Pettigrew!” He called.</p>
<p>“Lupin” Sirius snapped.</p>
<p>“Lupin!” Lockhart smiled broadly.</p>
<p>A camera flashed.</p>
<p>“We were just leaving!” Lily said gathering Harry and Draco’s hands.</p>
<p>“But you can’t! I can’t just see you guys and not give you the gift that are my books, my entire collection just for you, Evans,” he said smiling creepily.</p>
<p>“My name is Potter, actually!” Lily said cold.</p>
<p>Lockhart stepped closer levitating a pile of books behind him.</p>
<p>“My apologies, I guess you will always be Evans to me,” his voice dropped, but it was still loud enough in the silent room.</p>
<p>Lily shivered. Sirius and Remus watched in amused horror waiting for something to happen. Ron cleverly had escaped in the crowd.</p>
<p>“Funny since you barely knew me in school!” Lily said in a cutting tone.</p>
<p>Lockhart made his way to them and threw the pile of books in a distressed Draco’s arms. He took Harry by the shoulders and dragged him closer.</p>
<p>“How about a picture for the Prophet?”</p>
<p>“Take your hands away from my child!” Lily raised her wand.</p>
<p>Gasps could be heard from the room and a big number of cameras flashed.</p>
<p>“It’s just a photo!” Lockhart made a fake smile.</p>
<p>The Bat-Bogey Hex came naturally even after all this time. Lockhart immediately let go of Harry and her son stepped into the protective family circle. Sirius was puffing trying to control his laughter and Remus was smiling widely.</p>
<p>“We are going now!” Lily hissed.</p>
<p>Lockhart was still clutching his nose face contorted in pain. No one stood in Lily’s way as she stormed out.</p>
<p>“That was amazing!” She heard from young Ginny.</p>
<p>She winked at the youngest Weasley and made her way out.</p>
<p>As soon as they got into the street, Sirius collapsed laughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“That was brilliant! His face! I missed that!”</p>
<p>“You are not used to be the one not receiving it!” Remus joined in laughing.</p>
<p>“I should have had more control!” Lily frowned.</p>
<p>“When did you ever?” Sirius burst laughing again.</p>
<p>Lily glared at him.</p>
<p>“Careful, Black, if I get to hex my old victims again…” She threatened.</p>
<p>I surrender” Sirius said rising his arms.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Notorious<em> hermit Lily Potter-Evans.</em>.. There is a hyphen in your name? “Sirius asked from the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>Lily groggily made her way to the kitchen. Sirius was sitting primly at her breakfast bar sipping her fancy tea. She was too sleepy to wander how did he got in.</p>
<p> “No,” she said going straight for the cupboard to get a pot of coffee going.</p>
<p>“I thought so. Going on: <em>Attacked famous writer Gilrderoy Lockhart at his book signing in Diagon Ally last night. Our sources do not pin point a reason for the violent outbreak, but Lily Potter-Evans is known for her temper,“ </em>Sirius read.</p>
<p>“Coffee?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head no and continued reading out loud.</p>
<p>
  <em>“Lockhart was cursed using the famous Bat-Bogey Hex and was bleeding for hours. He stayed to finish his book signing and went to Saint Mungo’s only after it, where he was not, thankfully, treated by intern Potter.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“</em>I am a full on Med Witch,” Lily groaned.</p>
<p><em>“Lockhart said he holds no grudge and will teach young Potter as any other student being gracious enough to take… </em>Blah-blah, not interesting,<em>” </em>Sirius folded the paper. “But this one is for the fridge. It’s been years since the last one.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t exactly missing them,” Lily sighed and finished brewing her coffee.</p>
<p>“But you at least expected it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did,” she sighed. “Are there any photos of Harry?”</p>
<p>“Nope, you managed to make first page all on your own,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“Did she ask for a psych eval again?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“Yep! And also social services!”</p>
<p>Lily sighed, “Thank Merlin the law is not in her hands then!”</p>
<p>“It was the most fun I had in ages,” Sirius beamed.</p>
<p>“You have a boring life then,” Lily said and poured her coffee in a large “best mum” cup she got from Harry.</p>
<p>“Lately it is… I mean, the house is still a disobedient mess, but at least it stopped locking us out of rooms,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“Is the house elf any more hopeful?”</p>
<p>“No, he still hates us and everything we stand for.”</p>
<p>“Charming,” Lily sipped her coffee.</p>
<p>“He likes the new guests we keep on having though and he acts like the perfect house elf when anyone is around.”</p>
<p>“The new students Remus is having?”</p>
<p>“And their parents. I knew the house would help him get more students, but I didn’t count on so many pureblood families needing tutors,” Sirius frowned.</p>
<p>“You had tutors,” Lily pointed out.</p>
<p>“Yes… But I feel like every single mother or one that has a daughter of age has been in our place”</p>
<p>“Well, Black is a very sought after last name,” Lily shrugged.</p>
<p>“Black? I thought they were…” Sirius widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“There for Remus?” Lily’s eyes lighted up.</p>
<p>“Of course, he…” Sirius trailed of lost in thought.</p>
<p>“They were there for you… for some reason,” Lily rolled her eyes. Great, like Sirius needed his ego boosted more.</p>
<p>“But…” Sirius frowned and bit his lip, the sign he was pondering over something. “I do not want them.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t say you do not want anyone,” Lily smiled over the rim of her cup.</p>
<p>“I didn’t and I won’t say anything else!” Sirius glared at her.</p>
<p>“You tried to set him up with one of them,” Lily pointed out.</p>
<p>“I know…” Sirius got deflated, disconcerting.</p>
<p>“Do you maybe….” Lily began.</p>
<p>“Have to go home now?” Sirius deflected by jumping from his seat. “Yeah, see you tomorrow at the station, hermit Potter,” He rushed off to the Floo before she could get another word out.</p>
<p>“Huh, interesting,” She smirked into her cup. “Maybe there was something there after all.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, they all drove to King Station in Arthur’s beat old car. Molly and Arthur in the front and she, Ron and Harry in the back seat. Fred and George refused to ride it and they took Ginny with them.</p>
<p>They pulled at the station and Arthur parked, a bit wobbly, but Lily was not going to comment on it. The kids jumped out of the car when Lily heard a familiar rumple down the street.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t,” She whispered.</p>
<p>But he did, because Sirius’s motorcycle strolled in. Sirius had his long hair loose, he even wore his old leather jacket; Lily rolled her eyes. He was either acting childish or the midlife crisis finally hit him. Remus was not with him, obviously, but the bike had an attachment and a very unhappy Draco in it.</p>
<p>“Here we are, last stop,” Sirius singsonged.</p>
<p>“You are embarrassing me,” Draco hissed as he jumped down.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, I am cool,” Sirius killed the engine.</p>
<p>“I am walking myself to the train next year,” Draco said his voice shaking.</p>
<p>“No, you are not. Your mother asked me to make sure you got here safe and I will do that till you graduate.”</p>
<p>“Safe? On that stupid machine? It’s a wonder we got here alive!”</p>
<p>“Stupid!? Do not listen to him, Jasmine!” He petted the bike dramatic. “You have no idea what a treasure she is, she can even fly!”</p>
<p>“Do not tell me….” Molly turns to a crestfallen Arthur. “Was that why you were meeting up with Sirius so much lately? Arthur Weasley, you will remove that as soon as we get home.”</p>
<p>Arthur nodded.</p>
<p>“Come on, we need to get to the station,” Lily said in the tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Dobby!” Draco called. A young house elf popped by the motorbike. “Help me with the luggage, please”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master,” The elf bowed and took the suitcase from the motorbike. “I do advice master Draco to not go to school this year,” the creatures whined.</p>
<p>“Yes, but you insist on not telling me why,” Draco snapped.</p>
<p>The house elf bowed his head.</p>
<p>“I can’t master… But please.”</p>
<p>“Enough, Dobby” Sirius said with authority.</p>
<p>“Yes, master Sirius.”</p>
<p>“We are meeting the others at the station in front of platform 9 ¾. We should hurry though, we are quite late.” Molly fretted.</p>
<p>The group made their way inside. They find the Weasleys easily, since the platform was almost deserted.</p>
<p>“You are almost too late to catch it,” Ginny huffed.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, you can all go in now, we have all the luggage,” Arthur said.</p>
<p>Fred and George were the first ones to go in, followed by Ginny. Molly and Arthur went next with the luggage. Lily stepped in. Most kids have already boarded, Arthur and Molly ushered theirs inside.</p>
<p>Lily waited for a few minutes, but the boys and Sirius did not cross. The train started puffing out steam announcing it would depart in a few minutes. She turned to the wall to cross, but the magical gateway was not there, it was a simple muggle wall.</p>
<p>“What is happening?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Something wrong, dear?” Molly asked.</p>
<p>“The gateway is closed.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be… not till everyone has left the station,” Arthur frowned.</p>
<p>“What are they doing, they will miss the train!” Molly said worried.</p>
<p>“They are not alone, Sirius is with them,” Arthur put a comforting hand on his wife’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“That is what I am worried about,” Lily said.</p>
<p>The train was about to leave the station, but Lily and Molly walked to the driver and let him know about the problem with the barrier.</p>
<p>Arthur and a couple of other parents that worked for the Ministry managed to make the barrier active again in a few minutes.</p>
<p>They got back on the muggle part of the station, but the kids were not there.</p>
<p>“Maybe they are waiting by the car,” Molly said.</p>
<p>Lily followed her out, although she had a bad feeling already.</p>
<p>Of course, the car was not there. Only Sirius’s motorbike and a note - “<em>Sorry, we took the car. I should be back in a few hours. Do not tell Remus</em>” and Sirius’s signature at the bottom.</p>
<p>“We should signal the train to go,” Lily said with a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sirius didn’t return for dinner. In fact, he only came back the next day with the train. Lily and Remus were waiting for him on the platform.</p>
<p>“You told Remus,” Sirius glared at Lily.</p>
<p>“Sirius,” Remus sighs. “Are you turning 11 again?”</p>
<p>“I had to take them to school,”</p>
<p>“We had the train waiting for them! We were there, we wouldn’t let it leave without them,” Lily said.</p>
<p>“I panicked,” Sirius looked down.</p>
<p>“Do you know why the gateway closed?” Lily asked.</p>
<p>“No, we just crushed into the wall,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“And then decided to fly to Scotland?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Seemed like a good idea at the time,” Sirius mumbled.</p>
<p>“You put them all in danger,” Lily glared.</p>
<p>“We had the invisibility on all the way, they were perfectly safe,” Sirius replied.</p>
<p>“That is why you parked into the Wimping Willow?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“It was foggy, alright?” Sirius snapped.</p>
<p>“Not alright!” Remus raised his voice.</p>
<p>In the time Lily had known him, she could count on one hand the times Remus had raised his voice. Sirius seemed as surprised as she was, because he stared at Remus and didn’t argue further.</p>
<p>“The kids have detention for months now!” Remus pointed a finger at Sirius.</p>
<p>“And what are you going to do, punish me, Professor Lupin?”</p>
<p>Sirius’s flirty tone went over Remus’s head judging by his snappish answer.</p>
<p>“You are not allowed to fly that monstrosity again!”</p>
<p>“Moony!” Sirius cried in outrage.</p>
<p>“No, I, in fact, asked Arthur to remove the flying mechanism on it!”</p>
<p>“And what if I just put them on again?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare, Black!”</p>
<p>Both Lily and Sirius watched Remus speechless.</p>
<p>“We are going home now and we are using the damn bus!” He said and turned away from them.</p>
<p>“He is scary” Sirius whispered conspiratorially to Lily.</p>
<p>“You did deserve it” She whispered back.</p>
