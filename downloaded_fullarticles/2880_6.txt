<p>Draco looked up from the jumper he was knitting to glance over at Harry, poring over his own knitting in deep concentration.  </p>
<p>
Both of them had taken to Muggle London as if it were second nature and although he and Harry had reintegrated the Wizarding community a few years ago, they’d kept their flat in Muggle London.  Using magic freely in the daytime was a gift, but Muggle London had their heart.  It witnessed their first meeting by chance, their pain and subsequent healing after the war, quiet moments in the corner of a candlelit pub, movie marathons and tentative hand-holding in the dark, learning to trust, learning to live again. Everything. </p>

Harry felt the tingle of Draco’s eyes on him and looked up to see a nearly heart-stopping fondness in his partner’s eyes. </p>
<p>
“You giant sap, you,” he said, pulling Draco in closer to him, sighing with content. </p></div>
