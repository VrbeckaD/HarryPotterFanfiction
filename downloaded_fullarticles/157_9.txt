    <p>Max and Sandra, two friends who were thirteen years of age, were walking home one summer’s evening from a fine game of hide-and-go-seek when they heard it. A strange wheezing sound that came from a shady looking alleyway. Glancing curiously at each other, they cautiously tip-toed into the alley where they saw what looked to be a police-box.</p><p><br/> “A police-box,” Sandra commented.</p><p><br/> “It says ‘Pull to Open,’” Max added, already reaching for the handle of the door. He hesitated. “What if there’s someone in there?”</p><p><br/> “Then they have a good reason for being in there, and maybe we should go in there too, just in case,” Sandra suggested. “If you won’t, I will!” And with that, she yanked the door open.</p><p><br/> “Sandra, wait!” Max called after her as she darted through the doorway, “I think I remember from class that police-boxes were mainly used to lock criminals into-“ he cut off as he followed her in, staring wide-eyed at the impressive scene. It looked like something out of a sci-fi novel.</p><p><br/> “Max, what…” Sandra was inches away from him, staring around also. “It’s like someone fit a different dimension in that box…”</p><p><br/> “Bigger-on-the-inside type spell, maybe?” Max suggested, suddenly feeling a little nervous. The gangly teen started to back up when he backed into something…somebody. Slowly, Max turned around. He cursed silently to himself. His magic with Art and Entertainment wouldn’t help in a battle situation. Unless, of course, he could captivate them to death. Sandra was more formidable, but it didn’t look like there were any plants in the immediate vicinity, and she couldn’t write a get-out-of-hell-free card, so all that was left was her magic with music. Which wasn’t as strong as her plant magic. Damn.</p><p><br/> “What are you doing in my TARDIS?” The man – for it was a man – behind Max asked. Sandra whirled around as Max stared at the man. He looked a little like a monkey. A blue eyed, big eared, monkey. In a leather jacket. Max’s eyes traveled over his shoulder. The door was closed. Great.</p><p><br/> “Um…” Sandra seemed, for once, at a loss for words.</p><p><br/> “We heard a sound,” Max started, “and-“ he was cut off by the man in front of him.</p><p><br/> “Let me guess, you lot decided to investigate,” he snapped, looking a lot miffed.</p><p><br/> “Well, we were curious, you know,” Sandra snapped back, folding her arms and glaring at the man over her long nose.</p><p><br/> “Sandra…” Max sighed, dragging his hand through his hair nervously. Sandra just scowled.</p><p><br/> “Max,” she said with a mocking sigh. Max wrinkled his nose.</p><p><br/> “Haven’t you heard that curiosity killed the cat?” The man asked, glaring right back at her.</p><p><br/> “And haven’t you heard that satisfaction brought it back?” She demanded. “And while we’re at it, we might as well add that the phrase ‘blood is thicker than water’ is incorrect. It’s; ‘the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.’ Would you like me to go on with more incorrect sayings?” She had moved to Max’s side, and stood shoulder to almost-shoulder with him, presenting a united front.</p><p><br/> “No,” the man seemed more amused now then angry. “No, you don’t.” Suddenly, the ground they were on decided to move, and there was a loud wheezing sound.</p><p><br/> “That’s the sound we heard!” Sandra gasped as she clutched onto Max’s arm for dear life. Max was likewise clinging onto a convenient railing. The man was stumbling also, looking quite shocked at the turn of events.</p><p><br/> “WHAT DID YOU TWO DO?” he yelled, scrambling over to some steps that the two teens were now noticing.</p><p><br/> “NOTHING!” Sandra yelled back. “WE JUST OPENED THE DOOR!”</p><p><br/> “YOU HAD TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING!” the man yelled back, pulling levers at some kind of consol. “AND HOW DID YOU OPEN THE DOORS ANYWAY?”</p><p><br/> “IT SAID PULL TO OPEN!” Max shouted, wrapping his arm around Sandra and pulling her close after she almost hit her head on a railing. The man let out a frustrated shout, and the ground stopped shaking. The man muttered irritably and checked a screen.</p><p><br/> “Do you two remember which dimension you’re from?” He asked casually. Max and Sandra stared at him, and then each other, with wide eyed. Mutely, they shook their heads. “Damn.” He said. “I only have enough left for one jump, but if it’s the wrong one…” he looked slightly apologetic. “I’m sorry, I’m afraid you’re both stuck in this dimension.” He grinned.</p><p><br/> “Hello, I’m the Doctor.”</p><p><br/> Max did the manly thing and fainted.</p>
