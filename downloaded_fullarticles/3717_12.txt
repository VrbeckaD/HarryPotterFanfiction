    <p>Vitiate loved power. He enjoyed it immensely, especially when torturing prisoners. In his mind, the prisoners needed to be punished. If he wasn't going to do it, then someone else would. And he needed to be ready for what was to come.</p><p>Vitiate was a Sith with red skin, a rugged face, and eyes black as night. His robes were black, too, and his lightsaber had a yellow beamed blade protruded from its silver hilt. He moved with grace and valor, using all his might to charge at his targets and strike them down.</p><p>He smiled when the Sith Lords stood before him. Their lush, green planet Nathema was fertile with life. It was this blissful. It almost made Vitiate sorry for what he was about to do.</p><p>"Come with me," Vitiate said, leading the Sith Lords outside. There was a beach with its large body of water. And here they were, standing in a circle. He moved to the center of the circle, preparing for what was coming next. "I promised we would get salvation! The Jedi will die and we will live!"</p><p>"Where are the Jedi?" one Sith Lord, a man with purple skin, sleek black hair, and black tattoos stretched across his forehead and nose, asked. He wore robes with silver armor over them.</p><p>"Close your eyes." Vitiate looked at the Sith Lords, telling them, "Do it!" They did, making the ruler smile.</p><p>Vitiate extended his hands, summoning the strongest force he could muster. In a sheer blast, the whole planet trembled. The other Sith Lords were gone, and so were the peoples of Nathema. It was an empty world now, with voices of the citizens speaking in loud whispers, wondering what happened.</p><p>Vitiate smiled, turning to look at someone not there. "And now, Parker Dooley, you're next. I'm coming for you, whether you want to believe it or not! The choice is yours alone." He nodded, smiling wickedly. "I'll see you soon." He laughed, forcing the creature having the vision to fall back into his own thoughts.</p><p>That creature was the red dragonoid Parker Dooley, who awoke with a horrid expression. "No," Parker said in a hushed voice. "How could he do that?"</p><p align="center">~o~</p><p>Parker sat up on his red cushioned bedroom bench seat, nestled in one corner of his and Eliza's master bedroom, close to the red curtained window. The floor had grey carpets that stretched out throughout the house and in various rooms. There was also an oak writing desk seated next to a gold, standing lamp, as well as a dark mahogany bedside table, situated next to the bed. He looked at his human wife Eliza, still sound asleep on their four-poster queen-sized bed, with its mahogany, polished wood frame, seated against a grey-painted wall in the centermost part of the room. Her breathing was even, almost like she was dreaming.</p><p>He grinned, taking in her features: her brown locks of hair, now starting to turn grey in some places, her fair features, her pale skin, and the green nightgown she was wearing. He checked his red scaly hands. Sure enough, they still had sharp black claws. His spikes were also black, while his short grey horns sat on top of his head, curving back with its tips pointed upwards.</p><p>He briefly caught a glimpse of himself in a tall, oval-shaped standing mirror with gold rope-like framing. The mirror stood next to the master bathroom, which had a blue, tan, and white tiled, stone floor, as well as a white toilet, a low-standing tub, a white sink with a silver faucet, a marble counter, and white painted cabinets, and a window with a white shade, as well as purple curtains draped over it.</p><p>Yup! His tail was still medium-sized, curling around his red scaly feet, while his face was dragon-like. His snout was short with its tip standing upright. The clothes he wore were a white tunic and a pair of brown breeches. It had been too long since he'd been human, but if he were human, then he would have soft, thick, curly brown hair, bright blue eyes instead of his yellow dragonoid ones, pale skin, and fair features. He sighed, wondering when he would ever become human again. Perhaps he would always stay a dragonoid. Well, who knew, right?</p><p>What didn't make sense was the vision he had moments ago. It wasn't even dawn yet! But that didn't stop his mind from thinking about the Sith Lord Vitiate. What was a Sith? The thought struck him. The Sith were creatures and people feeding off the darkness. For a moment, he thought he saw red beamed lightsabers in the vision, but he must have been fooling himself. Besides, even if he could wield such a blade, what would he use it for? Surely, it would be used to cut down enemies, bend them to his will – no! He mustn't think that!</p><p>He'd done terrible things already and received punishments in return. Vicious punishments that changed him. From being whipped to being scratched by that cream-colored Oriental cat Jine – he wouldn't forget her – he was used to being beaten. His acts were out of defense, but that nymph and the way he almost attacked her was something he couldn't keep his mind off of. He felt awful for almost doing that. He shouldn't have thought it!</p><p>It was those dark thoughts that were responsible for what he almost did, but also what he nearly did to the dragonoid chieftain, the leader of the evil dragonoids, who was killed instead by his youngest brother Turen, now named Mordru. Turen – Mordru was responsible for that death. He protected Parker, but was it really necessary?</p><p>Parker sighed, staring at his reflection one last time in agony. He needed to speak to a healer, someone to help him out with his visions and dark thoughts. Yes! That was right! He just hoped Eliza wouldn't mind him being gone for an hour or two. He turned his attention to a piece of parchment paper and wrote a note to her.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Eliza, My Darling Wife,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm going to the healer's house to find a healer, speak to them about these visions and dark thoughts. I shouldn't be too long.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your Loving Husband,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Parker</em>
</p><p>He nodded, leaving the note on the bedside table. He returned to his and his wife's bed, kissed Eliza on the forehead, and told her where he was going. In quick strides, he left their bedroom in high spirits. Hopefully, there was a healer who understood what he was going through.</p><p align="center">~o~</p><p>The healer's house stood directly across from Parker and Eliza's house. Herbs and various plants decorated the walls, windows, and wooden patio. The herbal house had thatched roofing, too, along with beige walls, similar to the color painted on Parker and Eliza's house. He looked around, checking to make sure he wasn't followed. There wasn't anyone around. He was alone. He shrugged, opening the door and entering the healer's house.</p><p>The interior proved to be more elaborate than the exterior. There were plants all around, as well as various herbs hanging from the ceiling and the front desk, which was made out of dark oak. He looked around but found the place mostly empty.</p><p>"Hullo?" Parker asked, curious. Seeing that he wasn't disturbed, Parker closed the door and made his way into the waiting room. How was he going to find a healer here? Maybe if he rang that silver bell, sitting on the front desk, then someone would come out to give him advice. He rang the bell now, half-expecting to meet someone important.</p><p>At first, nothing happened. Then a dark oak door opened, revealing a man with flaming red hair, emerald green eyes, and donned in red armor, along with a red cloak. Parker gulped, wondering if this man was friendly.</p><p>Parker mustered up the courage to speak to him. "Are you – I'm sorry, but do you work here?" The man approached, eyeing him suspiciously. "I don't mean to sound rude, but I need some help."</p><p>"You're looking for advice," the man said, curious. He smiled, gesturing to him to come forward. "Come here. We can get you settled, and then ask the big questions!" He opened the door wider, letting Parker through.</p><p>The hallway Parker and the man entered was narrow and plain. Sure, there were a few green-leafy plants in decorated vases here and there, but these plants didn't crowd the hallway. Instead, they livened up the corridor, making Parker feel at peace for once. At last, he and the man entered the first room on the right.</p><p>To Parker's surprise, this room was decked in red. From red curtains draped over the windows to a red couch and chair, all set up and ready for go. Among the red was an insignia of a lion inside a gold crest. A gold letter H rested in front of the lion, in the centermost part of the insignia. But that wasn't the only detail he noticed. The insignia appeared on every corner of the room, including on pillows and bookcases, filled to the brim with books and scrolls.</p><p>The second Parker and the man were in the room fully, the red dragonoid took a seat on the couch, enjoying the couch's softness, as the man closed the door, giving them some much-needed privacy. Parker looked up as the man sat down and picked up a clipboard holding a small stack of blank, lined paper. The man grabbed a quill, put on his glasses, and returned his gaze to the red dragonoid.</p><p>"Just so you're aware, my name is Godric Gryffindor, one of the four Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," Godric introduced himself. "Just know that won't detract us from our session. Now, tell me your name again."</p><p>"Parker Dooley," Parker said, confused. "What is this about?"</p><p>Godric wrote the red dragonoid's name down. "Yes, we will get to that soon." He set the quill down on the clipboard, asking Parker, "Now then, tell me what troubles you?"</p><p>Parker was reluctant, at first, to speak about his visions. He didn't want to go into full length detail about his life! He wanted to wait until their next session to do that… that is, if he had another session with him. Eventually, he spoke about his visions, noticing a pattern right away. By the time he was done, he looked up at Godric, who stroked his soft red beard.</p><p>"This is most disturbing," Godric said, shaking his head. He asked the red dragonoid, "Have you noticed a pattern? With these visions, I know I'm beginning to see a pattern."</p><p>"They all end the same. Someone suffers, goes through pain, and then either dies or is badly injured," Parker said, trembling. "I know that in my previous vision, before this recent one, I came out of a fire, badly injured. The lion, who I, Eliza, and Maxin have raised – Corin – he's going to change things. If not for the better, then it will surely be the end of me."</p><p>Godric stroked his beard again.</p><p>"What should I do?" Parker asked, worriedly.</p><p>"That depends." Godric said, putting his clipboard on top of his black-surfaced desk. "Normally, I don't take stock in visions, but yours sounds real enough."</p><p>"They <em>are</em> real!" Parker exclaimed, troubled. "Are you saying my visions are fake?"</p><p>"No," Godric said, putting his glasses on top of the clipboard. "I believe you. I believe your visions are real and that doesn't happen very often in my world." He shrugged. "Most of the time, witches and wizards from my home world take visions lightly, unless they are real." He added, curtly, "I believe your visions are real and will need to be dealt with properly."</p><p>"What can I do? There must be a way for <em>them</em> to stop!" Parker said, distraught. "For these visions to end."</p><p>Godric shrugged again. "I doubt your visions will ever end. What I will say is that you shouldn't trouble yourself. The future is uncertain, but the best way for these visions not to come true is not to dwell on them." He added, out of courtesy, "Do yourself a favor: don't dwell on the past or even on the visions. Live each day knowing you're here and alive." He checked the clock on the wall, informing him, "We'll end there for today."</p><p>Parker stood up, confused. "What? We're not going to fill out an appointment slip?"</p><p>"Eh?" Godric asked, confused as well.</p><p>"I learned what it meant in Eliza's world," Parker shrugged. "An appointment slip is something you write down to date of our next appointment, as well as the time." He asked, curious, "Don't you understand? It means I could come back at an appointed time!"</p><p>"Parker," Godric stood up, "don't worry. Just come back whenever you feel like it." He added, "Isn't your house on the other side of the fountain, in one of the village squares?"</p><p>"Why yes," Parker shrugged again, confused.</p><p>"Well, then you have nothing to worry about." Godric approached the door and opened it for him. "We'll speak again soon. Enjoy yourself and, hey, don't let these visions bother you." He nodded, waving to him.</p><p>Parker waved back, before walking down the hallway, opening the door, and stepping out to the waiting room. He shook his head, as he left the healer's house untarnished. "Unbelievable. That wasn't a whole lot of help!" He stepped down from the patio, making his way back to his house.</p><p>If he was lucky, Eliza wouldn't be up. But it was anyone's guess as to what was going on inside their house right now.</p>
