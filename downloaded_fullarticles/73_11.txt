  <em>"Step aside, and I'll spare you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No! I won't let you kill my son!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Fine... It's your choice after all...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Avada Kedavra!"</em>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Daiki yawned loudly while standing with his best friend Tetsuya at Kings Cross. Like every year they received weird looks because of their rather interesting baggage. Who the hell brought owls to a train station?! But it was fine as long as no one saw them running through a wall...<br/>
Daiki yawned again, causing Tetsuya to sigh and look at him.</p><p>"Please stop it, Daiki. I know you had a hard time with your aunt and uncle, but people will see you differently when you're constantly bored and lazy. You're famous after all."</p><p>"Whatever... I didn't want to have that annoying scar in the first place."<br/>
Just to provoke his friend, he yawned a third time and of course, since they were at platform 9¾ now, people were staring at him.</p><p>"We should wait here for Satsuki," Tetsuya said and Daiki barely understood him because it was very loud around them. Tetsuya's low presence wasn't helping him either. Even after five years Daiki had to make sure every minute if he was still standing next to him.</p><p>Everyone at Hogwarts thought that Tetsuya's mother accidently used an invisibility spell on her son when he was younger and that his presence lacked because she couldn't fix it properly. Of course Tetsuya was denying this theory and Daiki was also pretty sure that it had been Kise who made that up.</p><p>"Dai-chan! Tetsuya!"<br/>
It was impossible to miss the small girl with her pink hair in the crowd.</p><p>"Ah, good to see you again, Satsuki! Summer was hella annoying," Daiki greeted her and she laughed.</p><p>"I believe you. The Dursleys still aren't nice to you, are they?"</p><p>"No, but that doesn't matter. They're now at the hospital because they think I've turned Dudley into a frog..." He grinned.</p><p>"What?! Have you?!" Satsuki immediately shouted and Daiki rolled his eyes.</p><p>"No, of course not... I just locked Dudley inside a Dixie toilet and gave aunt Petunia a frog whom she believes now is her beloved son."<br/>
Satsuki sighed.</p><p>"Well, I somehow expected something stupid like that..."</p><p>"Hey! It wasn't stupid, it was funny! You should've seen their faces!" Daiki swore he heard Tetsuya giggle in the background.</p><p>"Come on now or the Hogwarts Express is leaving without us!" she ignored his last sentence (and the fact that Tetsuya did seem to find it funny.)<br/>
Daiki's luggage cart squeaked when he began pushing it towards the train.</p><p>"I hope we get a compartment for us this time. I wouldn't want to cope with those noisy Hufflepuffs from last year again," Daiki grumbled while following Satsuki through the train.</p><p>"Don't worry, something's always free," Tetsuya said.</p><p>"Sure, but when someone's going to disturb us I'm gonna kick them out," he threatened and glared at a few second years who were ogling him like he was the eight wonder of the world. Okay, he probably was the eight wonder of the world and it wasn't that bad to be famous, but the constant staring was one thing Daiki would love to get rid of.</p><p>"No, Dai-chan, stop with those empty threats! You're practically the symbol of Gryffindor right now. Slytherin hates us already and if you're insulting Hufflepuff, they may join them and we're finished! So please be nice and behave!" Satsuki lectured him.</p><p>"Okay, okay, fine. But my threats are never empty!"</p><p>At least they were lucky and eventually got a compartment only for the three of them. For Daiki it would be the perfect time to sleep now and he'd wake up when Hogwarts was in sight, but of course his friends had other plans. And he also wasn't able to go to sleep when Satsuki's stupid cat Crookshanks kept wandering over his legs. He wanted to shake the damn beast off, but Satsuki would only get mad at him and if he didn't watch out he could arrive at Hogwarts as a cat himself.</p><p>"Daiki, do you still remember how we first met?" Tetsuya asked when the Hogwarts Express slowly started to move.</p><p>"Tch. Of course, but why remember that all of a sudden?" he grumbled, looking outside of the window where the platform was filled with lots of parents bidding their children goodbye, some of them were even crying. Daiki scrunched his eyebrows, at this moment always wondering how it felt to have someone waiting at home for him.</p><p>"It was just funny how you thought you were alone in your own compartment," Tetsuya said and showed one of his rare smiles.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, then you greeted me and I got startled so much that my head collided with the window and I was gone for the rest of my very first time going to Hogwarts. We all know the story!" he continued slightly embarrassed.</p><p>"And then Satsuki came in, too because she saw you laying on the ground and thought you ate a gummly jibblebean," Tetsuya added with a straight face.</p><p>"A... What?! What the hell is a gummly jibble-whatever-thing?!" Aomine asked confused.</p><p>"A bean that makes one dumb, lazy and arrogant at the same time," he explained monotonous.</p><p>"What the fuck...? You've just made that up, have you." Daiki knew Tetsuya long enough to see through his facade.</p><p>"No, I haven't," he replied and his owl hooted at the same time as to clarify his words.</p><p>"Oh, shut up... And you too, Nigou!" Daiki glared at the owl playfully and it was staring right back. He still was amazed how these big blue eyes of the snowy owl resembled Tetsuya's so much.<br/>
Satsuki was trying her hardest to not laugh at that ridiculous staring contest while stroking Crookshanks' orange fur.<br/>
Suddenly another owl began complaining, causing her to look down.</p><p>"Oh, Dai-chan! Do you also have an owl now? He's pretty, what's his name?" Satsuki asked and wondered why she hadn't noticed the bird earlier.</p><p>"She," Daiki corrects her.</p><p>"It's a girl. I bought her with Tetsu in Diagon Alley a few days ago." He picked up the cage with the rather small barn owl and showed it to Satsuki.</p><p>"Aw, how cute! What's her name?" she asked excited. Tetsuya snorted in the background.</p><p>"Well, uh... her name's Quaffle..." he scratched the back of his head and looked away.</p><p>"What?! You called an owl Quaffle?! Are you serious?! That's the most uncreative thing I ever heard from you!"</p><p>"You're one to talk! So you wanna tell me Crookshanks is creative?" he contered.</p><p>"Whatever, you're way too obsessed with quidditch, you weirdo!"</p><p>"And you're too obsessed with books," he stuck out his tongue.</p><p>"Please calm down, children," Tetsuya finally interfered.</p><p>"Sorry, Tetsuya. But Dai-chan, where's your toad? You always had him with you," Satsuki wanted to know.</p><p>"Ah..." he looked a little sad.</p><p>"Dudley threw him against a wall, saying he was ugly. That's why I locked this stupid fat pig away in the first place. Since Toady is not with me anymore, I decided to get an owl."</p><p>"I'm sorry Dai-chan. Toady was a good toad..."</p><p>"Though the name wasn't more creative at all," Tetsuya coughed.</p><p>Their conversation went on for the most time. They were talking about this and that, and Quaffle, a very energetic owl, also seemed to like to pester them with her constant hooting. Daiki sometimes looked out of the window and watched how the landscape changed slowly.</p><p>"I'm excited to see what first years Gryffindor will get," Tetsuya started with a new theme.</p><p>"Hopefully they're not as dumb as the ones from last year," Daiki sighed and he could see Satsuki rolling her eyes without even looking at her.</p><p>"Well, they are fine when they're not as stupid as you are," she said.</p><p>"Also, we're arriving at Hogwarts soon, so we should change. I'm leaving you alone now!" Satsuki grinned and exited the compartment.</p><p>Daiki grumbled while searching for his Hogwarts uniform in his bag. The time always ran away on the way to the magic school. And why hadn't the damn lady with the snacks showed up yet? He at least wanted to eat a few chocolate frogs.</p><p>"You excited for quidditch, Tetsu?" Daiki asked.</p><p>"Of course. My parents gave me a new broomstick, so I'll be able to catch the snitch in less time," his friend answered.</p><p>"Cool, but don't do it too early, I want to have fun as well. I'm going to beat that damn Haizaki into the ground, you'll see. That arrogant Slytherin bastard..." he growled the last part.</p><p>"You know you can't tell other people that they're arrogant when you keep your nose this high yourself," Tetsuya sighed and Quaffle hooted for the hundredth time and seemed to agree with the plain wizard.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, you're right. And stop betraying me, Quaffle! You're supposed to be on my side!"</p><p>"I think she's way smarter than you..."</p><p>Soon Hogwarts was in sight and the friends got ready to leave the express. They watched how Hagrid took the first years and climbed with them into the boats.</p><p>"Ah shit..." Daiki suddenly cursed.</p><p>"What's up?" Satsuki asked.</p><p>"I forgot my magic wand in the train. Be right back!" he explained and stormed off. He heard Satsuki huffing how much of an idiot he was and that he should hurry up.</p><p>The express was already empty when he got back to their compartment. He searched under the seats, when suddenly a familiar voice spoke to him.</p><p>"Searching this?"<br/>
Daiki turned around and scowled at the person in front of him.</p><p>"Haizaki. Give me back the wand," he demanded.</p><p>"So you're still alive, huh? The boy who lived... Tch. I could just throw that piece of wood outside the window..."</p><p>"You wouldn't dare!" Daiki launched forwards, but Haizaki stepped back.</p><p>"Oh, seems like poor Aomine is going to start his sixth year without his magic wand..." Haizaki grinned in a slimy way. Daiki knew it was over when the bastard actually threw the wand, but suddenly someone else caught it mid air.</p><p>"Shougo, we're not that mean, are we..." a velvety voice spoke up behind the Slytherin. Daiki wondered how the dude managed to be here this quickly and catch the wand just in time. He looked closer at him and frowned when he noticed his wand's savior was also a Slytherin. He had grey eyes and black hair that covered his left eye which made him look like an emo. And for a Slytherin (not that Daiki ever would judge a Slytherin...) he was unfairly handsome.</p><p>"Mind your own things, Himuro!" Haizaki hissed angrily.</p><p>"Now come on, let's all be friends, alright?" That Himuro guy smiled and lied one hand on Haizaki's shoulder. Then he stepped towards Daiki and gave him back the wand.</p><p>"Sorry for Shougou's behavior," he said. Daiki squinted his eyes, the smile on the guy's face seemed so fake he could vomit.</p><p>"Who the hell are you? I've never seen you at Hogwarts before..." Daiki said, but Himuro's smile didn't waver.</p><p>"Is that how you say thank you? But fine, my name is Tatsuya Himuro. Until now my parents have teached me at home, so that's why you don't know me." He extended his hand towards him, but Daiki didn't have any intentions to shake it. The fake smile eventually fell. And when that Himuro looked at him with cold eyes, Daiki knew it was the best thing to not trust him.</p><p>"I should have said it would be better for you if we were friends..." The hand remained, but Daiki still didn't move.</p><p>"Let's go, Himuro, that's Daiki Aomine you're talking to, he's not worth it," Haizaki interrupted, slicking back his silver hair in annoyance, but Himuro ignored him.</p><p>"And?" His voice was somehow threatening.</p><p>"Thanks, but I have enough friends," Daiki answered, staring down on him. Then he turned around and finally left the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>"I wouldn't be so sure about that..." he heard Himuro mutter behind him, but he just shrugged it off and made his way to the castle. He'd be late, but that didn't matter to him.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"Dai-chan, what the hell took you so long??" Satsuki confronted him after he had entered the great hall and took his seat between her and Tetsuya.</p><p>"I just met someone I really didn't want to," he answered, looking at the food on the table.</p><p>"That's not explaining anything at all!" Satsuki replied, but Daiki wasn't listening to her. Tetsuya slapped his hand away as he tried to steal a grape from the plate in front of him.</p><p>"Not until the first years are sorted into their houses," Tetsuya said, looking at him blankly and Daiki groaned. His friend was taking the whole 'in which house do you belong'-thing way too serious. But he knew that Tetsuya was really happy when Gryffindor got newbies. He also had many fans in the years under them because he always helped the younger ones when they got lost or had problems with something.</p><p>Daiki leaned back in his chair. He thought it was rather boring to watch the whole ceremony, though he couldn't deny it had been exciting when he had sat on the chair with the talking hat on his head. That was maybe because he was the Daiki Aomine and practically everyone had wanted him in their house. He still remembered what the hat had said to him and his friends.</p><p>
  <em>"Satsuki Momoi, huh? You're pretty smart, I can sense that. I know that you'd be happy in Ravenclaw, that's where your talents could bloom to their full potential, but there's something else that counts for you... Hmmm, you're biggest desire is to be with your friends, right? For that you'll go through thick and thin! And that's gotta be...</em><br/>
<em> GRYFFINDOR!!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The smile on Satsuki's face was the biggest he'd ever seen.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Kuroko Tetsuya." The hat laughed a little.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're so plain, I don't know to which house I should send you. Maybe Hufflepuff is the right choice for you. You're kind and always helping, but there's also a will inside you. A will to prove others that they're wrong and a will to surpass them, and that definitely means...</em><br/>
<em> GRYFFINDOR!!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For once in his life Tetsuya actually looked surprised before he excitedly walked over to the Gryffindors who were cheering and greeting him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"So, Aomine Daiki, the boy who lived... I can't deny that I'm excited myself. Let's have a look... It seems like you got a lot of a Slytherin in you, you would fit in there well. Yeah, that would be just right for you!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No..." the tiny voice of a eleven year old replied.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I don't want to go there. I want to be with my friends!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Are you sure? You could achieve great things in Slytherin."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No, I want to be in Gryffindor. Please!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The hat sighed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"If you think that's the right thing for you, then it shall be...</em><br/>
<em> GRYFFINDOR!!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And the cheering was as loud as possible.</em>
</p><p>"Dai-chan! Snap out of it, you have to say something to our first years!" Satsuki pulled at his cape.</p><p>"Ah... What?" He looked around. A few kids looked at him with big eyes. Daiki sighed. Had he been that absorbed in his thoughts that he missed how the first years got sorted? Well, it wasn't that bad, at least he could finally eat something.</p><p>"Dai-chan!!"</p><p>"Ah... uh, yeah... So, I hope you're doing fine in Gryffindor and kick those fucking Slytherins in the face!" He grinned at the last part when he saw most of them nodding and looking at him like he was the greatest wizard in the world. Of course he got hit by Satsuki a second later for that.</p><p>"Please don't listen to him, he has a bad influence on you. Be nice to everyone and collect points for our house," Tetsuya stepped in front of Daiki and gave the children thumbs up, so that the kids were now looking at him with sparkles in their eyes.</p><p>Suddenly Dumbledore stood up from his seat and slowly walked up to the podium with the golden owl. Everyone was silent by now and watched him as he turned his voice louder with a spell.</p><p>"Welcome at Hogwarts, everyone. Welcome back to the ones who already experienced the magic world and welcome especially to those who are new to everything. Before you are going to enjoy this wonderful meal, I have a few things to announce.</p><p>Like some of you noticed, it's our priority to keep our students save. And mainly because of the dark lord and his death eaters the security level has been increased. That's why Azkaban has sent us a few Dementors. Though there's almost no chance that you might encounter one, I have to warn you. Dementors are black-hearted creatures. It wouldn't be wise to anger them." Dumbledore made his words clear when he looked at everyone over his glasses. His gaze seemed to linger on Daiki a bit longer before the old wizard smiled again.</p><p>"Let's change to something else. Aside from our new first years, we also got two new students older than eleven at Hogwarts. Firstly, we have Tatsuya Himuro, an amazing wizard who took lessons at home until now. But he decided to spend his last year before adulthood at Hogwarts. Being already sorted, I'm sure he's going to be an enrichment for Slytherin!" Dumbledore motioned towards the Slytherin table where Himuro stood up. Everyone clapped, well, except Daiki who was glaring at him. There was something that told him he should avoid this guy.<br/>
Dumbledore cleared his throat, so that everyone was looking at him again.</p><p>"The other one isn't here yet due to an incident. But I'm sure he'll come through this door every second."<br/>
In the same moment as he ended his sentence, the door to the great hall was pushed open. And once again it was proven that Dumbledore was omniscient.</p><p>Daiki watched how a boy around their age slowly glanced inside the hall before making his entry. He looked kind of unique with his vivid red hair that seemed to be two colored. His blood red eyes studied his surroundings nervously and it looked like he wasn't fond of all the attention given to him. He wore a simple black cape without the symbol of a Hogwarts house yet.</p><p>"Please welcome Taiga Kagami, a former student of Durmstrang who changed to Hogwarts for his sixth year!" Dumbledore spoke and everyone was whispering as they heard the name of the wizarding school in north Europe.<br/>
McGonagall smiled at the redhead when he finally reached the chair with the talking hat. The whispering still hadn't died down.</p><p>"Durmstrang? Seriously? I bet he's going to be in Slytherin..."</p><p>"From Durmstrang... The school doesn't have a good reputation, I heard the headmaster is a death eater."</p><p>"They teach their students dark arts there, have you known?"</p><p>Daiki clicked his tongue. Why was everyone so fast to judge that Kagami? True, he wasn't really a fan of Durmstrang himself, but the redhead somehow seemed like a lost puppy with all the others staring at him. Daiki felt almost sorry for the guy. He knew how it was to walk down the long way to the chair with every pair of eyes on him.</p><p>Kagami carefully sat down with the talking hat on his head. It somehow looked funny how a sixteen years old wore it instead of an eleven year old. Not a second later, the hat opened it's eyes.</p><p>"Oh?" it spoke.</p><p>"Interesting. Indeed, very interesting. From Durmstrang you say? Hmm... you know a lot of spells students are just allowed to read about. Your soul definitely belongs in Slytherin, but your heart tells me something else. You're frustrated. Frustrated about something I will not reveal here and this frustration keeps pushing you forward. You're determined to make new friends and get rid of every evil creature that could threaten them. You're kind, you always try to do the right thing. And most importantly you do everything to reach your desires without giving up once. Those are clear signs for...<br/>
GRYFFINDOR!!"</p><p>The gasps were louder than the cheering, but it seemed like that doesn't matter to Kagami, because he smiled dazzlingly at the Gryffindor table where most of the cheers came from. As he walked over to them, Daiki almost wished he could sit next to him. He got the feeling that they were similar in a way.</p><p>"He looks nice, don't you think?" Satsuki asked when they watched Kagami taking a seat a few places away from them.</p><p>"Maybe we should help him to get used to Hogwarts."</p><p>"Yeah..." Daiki agreed without looking away.<br/>
Dumbledore then announced they were allowed to enjoy the food now and still, it was the highlight of Daiki's day.</p><p>After everyone had finished eating, the students were making their way to the common rooms. A few yawns were heard during the rather complicated walk with turning stairs and ghosts who liked to annoy them.</p><p>Daiki threw his stuff on his bed as soon as he entered the sleeping dorm. He sure was tired as hell, but also happy to be back again. He had missed Hogwarts so much the time he had to be with the Dursleys.<br/>
Daiki immediately fell asleep after changing. The lessons were going to be boring as always, but he was looking forward to his first quidditch match.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>When Daiki opened his eyes the next morning, the first thing he saw were strands of red hair, mostly hidden by the covers in the bed next to him. He was confused for a second. Wasn't Susa normally sleeping there? But then he remembered that Susa was done with Hogwarts since last year. Daiki hadn't really known him in person, but he had been a good Chaser in quidditch.<br/>
The redhead he saw could only be Kagami with his odd colored hair. Daiki wanted to know how he'd do in quidditch. Maybe he should ask him some time.</p><p>During breakfast, they firstly talked to each other. It seemed like Kagami was a little stupid, so he still got lost this morning although he just had to follow the others down to the great hall. It occured that Tetsuya had found him desperately trying to open a door that wasn't even there in the first place. The two of them quickly befriended each other and Daiki was a little jealous.</p><p>"Ah Taiga, those are Daiki and Satsuki, my best friends," he introduced them and Kagami smiled widely.</p><p>"Cool, nice to meet you, I'm Taiga Kagami!"</p><p>"We know," Daiki said while biting into his toast.</p><p>"Don't be rude, Dai-chan!" Satsuki scolded him and then also smiled at Kagami. The redhead sat down between her and Daiki and also grabbed a few toasts.</p><p>"You play quidditch?" Daiki asked, still stuffing his mouth.</p><p>"Uhm, yeah, I do!" He looked at him excitedly.</p><p>"And? You any good?"</p><p>"I guess, yeah..." Kagami scrunched his eyebrows, slightly confused why Daiki didn't seem that friendly.</p><p>"Alright. We need a new Chaser, so come to the quidditch court the day after tomorrow."</p><p>"Hey, Taiga, since you're from Durmstrang, did you play with Viktor Krum?" Satsuki asked him.</p><p>"Yes, I actually did," he laughed.<br/>
"He's an incredible seeker. Our matches were amazing!"</p><p>"Whoa, that's immense! You played with Viktor Krum, the quidditch star from Bulgaria?!" Furihata, one of the Beaters of the team interfered.</p><p>"Ts, that Krum is nothing. I could crush him with one hand," Daiki said, causing Kagami to look surprised.</p><p>"I don't think so. Who are you to say something like that?"</p><p>"What?! You don't know who I am?! Are you fucking serious?" Daiki growled. That Kagami guy really had to be a helpless case when he didn't know him.</p><p>"Uh, Daiki Aomine, right...?<br/>
...<br/>
The Daiki Aomine?!"</p><p>"Yeah, the Daiki Aomine!" he repeated and glared at Kagami a little, but his face morphed into surprise when the redhead looked at him like he had won the house cup.</p><p>"Wow! I would've never thought I'd meet you! You're so cool!"</p><p>"Taiga, please don't say that to him, he'll become only more arrogant," Tetsuya said.</p><p>"What the hell, Tetsu?!"</p><p>After that, they finally began to eat. It was kind of amazing how Kagami used to devour his toasts. He ate much of them, veeery much to be precise and he just ate like he didn't know how to. First, he stuffed a few in his mouth, then he chewed once and gulped everything down while already grabbing the next eatable thing. Daiki watched him in awe.</p><p>"So... why did you decide to change from Durmstrang to Hogwarts?" Satsuki asked him, when he was done gulping the pumpkin juice.</p><p>"Ah, I don't like the cold. And you can believe me, it's very cold up there," he explained and added "man, this food is good, not the frozen drinks we got at my old school."</p><p>"Where is Durmstrang by the way?" Daiki asked.</p><p>"No one really knows. It's in no map because it's a secret."</p><p>"You don't know where your own school is, you loser?"</p><p>"Who are you calling a loser?!" Kagami snapped.</p><p>"You, because you are," Daiki teased him and enjoyed how Kagami got angered.</p><p>"Calm down, both of you!" Satsuki sighed.</p><p>"We have Charms class with Ravenclaw now. Let's go," Tetsuya added and all of them stood up.</p><p>"I have the feeling I am going to get lost about a hundredth times more..." Kagami sighed, when they used a shortcut through a portrait.</p><p>"Don't worry we'll help you, right, Dai-chan?"</p><p>"Yeah, sure..."</p><p>"You can also ask ghosts, when you're not with us. Most of them are friendly," Tetsuya recommended.</p><p>"Ghosts?!" Kagami shuddered.</p><p>"What, you've never seen one, Bakagami?"</p><p>"No, we don't have them at Durmstrang and don't give me weird nicknames!" the redhead shouted the last part.</p><p>"I'll call you whatever I want," Daiki replied.</p><p>"You're really not as cool as I used to think..." Taiga huffed.</p><p>They made it just in time to Charms. Professor Flitwick stood on his pile of books like every year. Kagami was a bit weirded out because he'd never seen such a small teacher before.</p><p>"Today we're learning 'Depulso'. It's a spell with whom you can push things away. It's so strong that you can move rocks as big as dragons out of the way. This also works with people, but please refrain from doing this here," the professor said. He paired the students up and ordered them to push their tables away with Depulso.</p><p>"So, how do we do this?" Kagami asked Daiki who was supposed to work with him.</p><p>"The hell should I know?" he growled in response. The other narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"I don't really like your tone..."</p><p>"Do I look like I care?"</p><p>"What's wrong with you, what have I done to you?" Kagami snarled. So he was the type to quickly start a fight, huh?</p><p>"Nothing, but you're not interesting either, so I'll treat you how I want," Daiki answered.</p><p>"You're such an arrogant prick, you know that?" The redhead tried to keep his voice down which wasn't really working.</p><p>"Stop! What are you two doing there? Five points deduction for Gryffindor!" Professor Flitwick suddenly shouted, causing everyone to look at the two.</p><p>"Everyone, keep going," the small professor sighed after a few students laughed at Kagami and Daiki.</p><p>"Congratulations, Bakagami," Daiki hissed and got ready to dodge because his partner looked like he really wanted to smash his face into the table.</p><p>"Dai-chan, Taiga, please get ahold of yourselves!" Satsuki warned them as she pushed her and Tetsuya's table away in an elegant movement.</p><p>"Not with this idiot!" they both shouted at the same time.</p><p>"At least try to solve the task," Tetsuya said and Kagami sighed. He looked around what the other students did and noticed that not everyone was as good as Satsuki. Most of them only achieved to push the table a foot away from them, some only a few inches.</p><p>Can't be that hard, he thought and pointed with his wand at the table.</p><p>"Depulso!" Kagami shouted while swinging his wand a little too harshly. Before he could do anything else, the poor table almost flew with unbelievable speed against the wall. There was a loud crash, assuring that the table just died.</p><p>"Kind of amazing, Mr Kagami, but you and Mr Aomine have been so disturbing earlier that I can't give you points for that," professor Flitwick said somehow amused.<br/>
Everyone was looking at the redhead as if he had done something great. Which he hadn't really. He'd still been a little angry at Daiki and that had seemed to influent the spell.</p><p>"Wow, do you have some special magic wand?" A student from Ravenclaw approached him laughing.</p><p>"Huh? Uh, no..." Kagami answered, only causing the Ravenclaw to laugh more.</p><p>"I'm Kazunari Takao, nice to meet you," he smiled and made a peace sign.</p><p>"Takao, we're in the middle of the lesson and your table hasn't moved one inch!" a deep voice spoke up behind him. That caused Daiki to look up.</p><p>"Midorima..." he said darkly.</p><p>"You too, Aomine, please concentrate now," Midorima repeated and pushed up his glasses.</p><p>"Pfff, come on, Shin-chan. Yours didn't move either. We can't let those Gryffindors beat us, can we?" Takao cackled.</p><p>"Kagami, gimme your wand for a second!" The redhead handed it to him a little reluctantly.</p><p>"Now pay attention," the small Ravenclaw grinned and aimed at his table.</p><p>"Takao, I don't think that's a good id-..."</p><p>"Depulso!"<br/>
They watched in horror how the spell did not hit the table but Midorima who was standing close to it. It didn't push him away but the spell flipped him over, so that he landed face first on the ground. Only Takao's laughter filled the silence.</p><p>"Haha, amazing, Shin-chan! Kagami, you're wand is really aggressive, I love it!"</p><p>"Well, I don't!! You gotta pay for this, Takao!" Midorima shouted as he managed to stand up.</p><p>"How did he even end up in Ravenclaw?" Kagami asked a little dumbfounded.</p><p>"I'd like to know that too," Daiki answered.</p><p>"The lesson is over for today," professor Flitwick announced, a little stressed with all the rumble. His class didn't behave like six years at all...</p><p>During the break, Kagami joined Daiki, Satsuki and Tetsuya since he didn't have any other friends at Hogwarts. Of course he told them he was happy to stay with them because he usually wasn't that good in making friends. Daiki was still a little annoyed that they lost house points because of the redhead, but after Satsuki had cornered him and threatened him to curse his poor self, he tried to be nicer to Kagami. It wasn't like the guy was that bad, but he had to earn Daiki's respect first. He also wanted to see how the newbie coped with a challenge. A bonus was that it was funny to see him riled up. But he should keep that to himself.</p><p>"How about we show you around a little, Taiga?" Satsuki asked and Kagami nodded.</p><p>"Do we really have to? I'm too tired to move," Daiki complained.</p><p>"I don't have a problem with you not tagging along," the redhead said.</p><p>"Oh, fine, then I'm coming just to annoy you, Bakagami!" Daiki grinned and laid one arm around Kagami's shoulder.</p><p>"Get off me!"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>The two were about to argue further when Satsuki pointed with her wand at them and suddenly both of them couldn't speak anymore.</p><p>"That was a good idea," Tetsuya sighed, enjoying the peace.<br/>
They walked around in the castle, showing Kagami their favorite places. After a few minutes he and Daiki were also allowed to speak again.<br/>
It was just then, that two students appeared Daiki would rather not like to encounter. He nodded to Tetsuya and Satsuki and they seemed to understand, ignoring the two as they passed each other. It would have went well, if Kagami hadn't stopped in his tracks.</p><p>"Tatsuya!" he gasped. The two Slytherins stopped walking and turned around.</p><p>"Taiga..." Himuro narrowed his eyes and glared at him. Daiki watched him annoyed. That guy was giving off bad vibes. And the other one wasn't better.</p><p>"Daiki, long time no see," Himuro's campanion, a small wizard with two colored eyes smiled.</p><p>"Uh, yeah..." Daiki responded, not wanting to say something wrong, because Akashi could be scary as hell.</p><p>"You," Himuro hissed and Daiki looked at him, but then realized he was talking to Kagami who had a look of despair on his face.</p><p>"How pathetic, you're still wearing that?" He motioned towards the ring that the redhead was wearing around his neck.</p><p>"Tatsuya, we're still-..."</p><p>"No, we're not. Throw the damn ring away, it's disgusting to see you with it. To think we're still brother's..." Himuro interrupted him angrily.</p><p>"Please, Tatsuya, I'm sorry, it will never happen again!" Kagami looked like he was about to have a breakdown and whatever had happened between the two of them, Daiki felt sorry for Kagami.</p><p>"You can't promise that. Don't get in my way again," Himuro warned him before turning around and walking away. Daiki looked at Kagami and saw him clutching the ring with his hand tightly.</p><p>"Brothers, you say?" Akashi asked and the redhead nodded, looking on the ground.</p><p>"Well, not really brothers, but we were so close we saw us as brothers. But then we had a... fight and he still hasn't forgiven me," Kagami explained a little sad and Tetsuya patted his back.</p><p>"Don't worry, Taiga, you'll eventually make up with him again," Satsuki supported him and the redhead smiled a little, once again happy to have friends.</p><p>"Who are you, by the way?" he then asked Akashi.</p><p>"Ah, sorry, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Seijūrou Akashi and not like the Slytherins Daiki likes to portray," he smiled.</p><p>"I wouldn't be so sure about that..." said one whispered to himself and instantly received a threatening look from Akashi.</p><p>"So you're Taiga Kagami from Durmstrang? It's a pleasure to meet you, so let's be friends," he directed his gaze at Kagami again and extended his hand. Daiki sure knows what was going to happen next and he was about to interfere when Kagami smiled again and said "yeah, sure." But before he could even shake Akashi's hand, the latter one had pulled out his wand quickly and aimed at the other's eye, not with a spell but with the wand itself. Kagami was able to dodge it just in time, catching Akashi's wrist and holding it in a firm grip.</p><p>"What the fuck...?!" he snarled and stared at the small wizard who still smiled at him. It seemed like Kagami overcame his shock which was quickly replaced with anger.</p><p>"Heh, interesting. You were better than I expected. I'm sure we're going to meet soon again, Taiga Kagami." The creepy smile still remained on his face as he turned around to follow Himuro. He was almost excited to face the former Durmstrang student again.</p><p>"And? Did you manage to stab his eye?" Himuro asked a little annoyed as Akashi caught up to him.</p><p>"Surprisingly not. He's different."</p><p>"Yeah, I guess he is. There was a reason he changed from Durmstrang to Hogwarts, you know?"</p><p>"That would've been my next question," Akashi laughed quietly.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"I told you, Slytherins are kinda weird," Daiki already said for the third time, his arm around Kagami's shoulder again.</p><p>"Yeah, I think I got that," the redhead grumbled, still failing to shake Daiki off..</p><p>"But that doesn't mean you're supposed to stay away from them. You definitely have to kick their asses!"</p><p>"Sure, Dai-chan, always." Satsuki pulled his ear.</p><p>"However, what do you think of Hogwarts so far?" she asked Kagami to cheer him up.</p><p>"I love it! It's so much brighter than Durmstrang. The classes are also cooler. But I'm mostly looking forward to quidditch," he smiled.</p><p>"That's nice, Taiga," Tetsuya said and the four of them chatted for a while before they had to head to Potions. Even Daiki enjoyed himself, which he rarely did when someone was speaking to him.</p><p>"I really want to know who we got this year as a professor in D.A.D.A." Satsuki said.</p><p>"D.A.D.A.?" Kagami asked.</p><p>"Defence against dark arts. It's the most interesting class I'd say," Daiki answered.</p><p>"But it's somehow cursed. No professor teached it for longer than a year," Tetsuya added.</p><p>"Sounds exciting," Kagami laughed.</p><p>"Like I said, Baka. Aren't you listening to the great Daiki Aomine?"</p><p>"Most of your words aren't even reaching my ears, Aho," the redhead smirked, earning a light smack on the back of his head, causing him to laugh.</p><p>"You sure are cheeky, Kagami," Daiki grinned.</p><p>"Just call me Taiga like the others do."</p><p>"Alright Tiger!"</p><p>Satsuki and Tetsuya both smiled. It looked like Daiki and Taiga would be real friends soon.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"And? Are you going to tell me about the reason?" Akashi asked, sitting in his favorite armchair in the Slytherin common room.</p><p>"It's not really something I should talk about, it's a well kept secret after all..." Himuro answered, sitting across from him with a book.</p><p>"Now I definitely want to hear it." Akashi pierced through him with his differently colored eyes.</p><p>"You're going to be in trouble if you tell anyone." Himuro lowered his voice.</p><p>"I won't. What happened in Durmstrang?"</p><p> </p>
