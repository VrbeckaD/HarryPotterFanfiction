  <span>Hello and welcome to episode 1 of “Local Idiot Asks Questions No One Wanted Answers To”. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will this be in any way structured, concise or even coherent? No. This will we a true mess with no possible way of understanding how my brain works. I’m gonna just type and not do anything else. No editing, no rewording. If I think it, I’m gonna write it down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This will be raw footage of the inner workings of my truly dumb mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I ask the hard-hitting questions that plague my mind at 2 am on a Saturday when I finally decide to take a shower. I seek to unravel the truth to things not-yet realised. I dare to go where no writer has gone and truly push the limit on “Is there such thing as a dumb question”. I purvey the world for things that needn’t be questioned, but should and will be. I fight for everyone who has ever asked something only to be asked “what the fuck is wrong with you??” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the age of fourteen, nearly five years ago now, I began my goal of being the one true dumbass. The pinnacle of idiocy and foolishness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It is a goal I proudly pursue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And I will start with my most recent question: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Can</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sectumsempra used to cut fruits and vegetables?? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like… officially I know it's for causing lacerations and hemorrhaging, but who says I can’t use it to chop of some lettuce for my sandwich??? What are the limits on what I can lacerate. It ain’t like spells are all set in stone anyways. If a dude in high school could invent it, I bet anything I could make it into a really weird kitchen spell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What I’m trying to say here is could I freak out my roommates by casually using sectumsempra while cutting bananas for breakfast in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How far can I stretch the meaning of a spell/curse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For example, can Diffindo be used like that too??? Like it’s considered the “severing charm” I guess??? And its used for clothing and shit so technically, if they both do things similar to cutting, what the fuck is stopping me from using them to do dumb things like cut my onions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Can I use it for something else???? Can I cut my lawn with them, or could I just straight up use it as a paper shredder when I’m cleaning out old paperwork? Can </span>
  <em>
    <span>other</span>
  </em>
  <span> spells be used like that??? Or even </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potions???? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Also did Snape ever get Sectumsempra patented? Could Harry or someone else just… Claim it as theirs?? How does that shit work in the wizarding world. Like anyone could just say “oh yeah I invented that spell” unless they have some way of registering new spells and their uses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I really doubt he did, because it’s like a dark curse or whatever, but god imagine having fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sectumsempra</span>
  </em>
  <span> registered as a simple cutting charm??? Or better yet: A god damb surgical spell? Like anything can be misconstrued into a positive if you do it right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Plenty of charms are used in very questionable ways, so why the hell not use a dark, devastating curse on your vegetables??? When the fuck else am I gonna use it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What’s stopping me? Nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On a kinda related note, what does dittany look like??? Like in my head, it’s a kinda pearly white. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the only reason I think that is because I have a vivid idea of someone saying “I accidentally put dittany instead of mayonnaise on my sandwich and now my tongue is numb”. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Can dittany even make your tongue numb? I know a whole lotta pain/injury creams that can do that. Never get Neosporin in your mouth, you’ll thank me later. That shit nasty and makes your whole mouth feel weird. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What about other weird shit??? Can Dittany be put in other shit? Can you make dittany scented?? Or add some other things to give it other properties- like something to make you sleepy or relax your muscles? Can I make a dittany bath bomb. Epsom salt and dittany, perfect for the day after a full moon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Can you put pepper-up potion in your morning coffee? Or like… bake the potion into a batch of brownies. Delicious baked goods filled with something to keep you feeling pretty a-okay. Honestly that sounds hella nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Are there bakeries that sell pepper-up pastries? If not, then I’m officially patenting that. My idea now. Pepper-up pastries, Blemish-clearing brownies, hangover muffins.... The possibilities are endless. Cooking and potion making is supposed to be similar, isn’t it? Or that’s what I’ve been told so unless I’ve been lied to then it’s totally possible to mix the two together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It could be a baker and a potion master, married at the ripe age of 29 and living their best life of owning a little cafe/apothecary in Diagon Alley. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They have one child, a little girl no older than 3. She likes to watch her parents dance after diner in the living area, with that look that makes it seem like they’ve been married for fifty years instead of just four. She falls asleep to one parent reading out loud from an old potions textbook from their school days. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck now I have a new character- three new characters actually. I love them all, though. </span>
