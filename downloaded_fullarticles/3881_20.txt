  <em>June</em>
</p><p>Lily sat up in the cool, dim room, and looked down at the sleeping body next to hers. Severus was all limbs, and so tall that from a distance he always gave the impression of being lanky and angular. But in close proximity, he just seemed large. Substantial, smooth-skinned, and very, very male. The thought made Lily shiver in a way the cold room had not. The blanket was bunched around his hips, the cleft of his taut arse just visible, the deep groove of his spine impossibly long, his shoulders square and rounded with lean muscle. His hair was almost as long as hers, soft and loose.</p><p>Sleeping with Severus was a mistake that Lily kept making. She knew it was wrong to do something that filled her with so much shame, even though the source of that shame was difficult for her to puzzle out. It might be because she was sleeping with Severus in part due to pity. He was so deeply solitary, and apparently immune to any source of companionship except Lily. But then, it might be because she was sleeping with her son’s teacher, and her best friend and dead husband’s nemesis. Or it could be that even though she was sleeping with Severus, she insisted on keeping it a secret, even though she had always thought she didn’t care what other people thought.</p><p>It might be because she felt an answering vulnerability in herself when she stared into Severus’s impossibly dark eyes and found a secret softness there.</p><p>By the time Lily surfaced from the most intense period of grieving for James, she had still had Harry to think of, to prioritize. Occasionally she found a sexual partner to assist her with her basic physical needs. By the time Harry was at a point that it wouldn’t have been irresponsible for Lily to search for a more complete partnership, the idea held little interest for her. She thought she might have outgrown the urgent despair over someone else that had come over her - an illness, a delirium - when she fell in love with James as a teenager.</p><p>Lily listened to Severus breathe. She watched the expanse of his muscled back, the curve of the arm that was flung above his head, the sparse dark hair on the back of his absurdly elegant, long-fingered hand. She nearly surrendered to the urge to press her sated body against his for no reason but the pleasure of closeness, contact, companionship.</p><p>But Lily had never been one to surrender. She slipped noiseless and naked from the bed, walked briskly across the cold stone floor, and donned the robes that she’d left neatly folded on a chair by the fireplace. She hated the floo, but after a moment’s consideration, decided the rush of flames would be a more considerate way to part with a sleeping lover than the crack of apparition. Even at the level of Lily’s talent, the noise would still be startling and especially harsh in a room walled with stone.</p><p>“12 Grimmauld Place,” she said into the blue fire that leapt to life from the handful of floo powder. She stepped forward without looking back.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Hermione spent the summer after her first year deeply ensconced in the Wizengamot’s private library, trying not to dwell on the injustice of a public governing body maintaining a non-public library, reminding herself over and over, in an inner voice that sounded like Draco Malfoy, and quoted him, too, <em>It’s all right, Granger; “self-improvement is a selfless endeavor.”</em></p><p>She had learned in her whirlwind introduction to British wizarding society, courtesy of said Draco Malfoy, her self-declared secret best friend, that the library was a relic of a pre-Democratic period in their magical nation. When magical society in Europe was still feudal, the most powerful lords contributed to a central library for their collective intellectual gain, though the old families certainly had their secret heirlooms in their own libraries as well.</p><p>When the Ministry was formed, a brief four hundred years ago, the library was appropriated by the new government. In the decades afterward, Wizengamot members were known to smuggle out the most valuable tomes originally contributed by their ancestors, so the breadth of unique work wasn’t what it once was. However, on occasion a bibliophile was made minister and sought to utilize public resources to expand the collection, and the end result of all of this history, recent and ancient alike, was the finest library Hermione could ever hope to see.</p><p>Hermione’s apprenticeship was under Rosemary Longbottom Black Redington, more commonly known as Scary Mary, a nickname that had horrified Hermione’s sensibilities until her elderly mentor had revealed, in phrasing characteristic of her caustic sense of humor: “Fuck ‘em, I <em>am</em> damn scary.”</p><p>And it was true. Rosemary Longbottom Black Redington was twice married and thrice widowed, officially, as her first husband, Phineas Black, had been declared officially dead twice in his life, whether due to mistake or resurrection, history couldn’t be certain. She still dressed daily in the traditional mourning attire of a dutiful widow in the late eighteenth century, which was roughly the moment of her first husband’s first death.</p><p>Rosemary Longbottom Black Redington was a vicious advocate of selective wizarding traditions and quick to dismiss others. She was without sentimentality or vulnerability that Hermiome could find, but she was a pragmatist. Which is why, despite her solid status as a Pureblood darling and advocate of so many conservative causes, she took one look at Hermione’s academic transcript and declared that they would be excellent friends, without commenting once on her parentage.</p><p>That declaration, taking place as it did on the occasion of their first meeting, left Hermione feeling pleased and hopeful, imagining a grandmotherly sort of relationship wherein Rosemary Longbottom Black Redington, font of wisdom, guided her young protege through the wizarding world with a gentle and affectionate hand.</p><p>However, Hermione soon learned that “friend” in her mentor’s mind meant “ally” and “resource” and other words that denoted a source of advantage, and really, that wasn’t so bad either. After all, Hermione already had the baffling and very physically demonstrative friendship of her secret best friend to adjust to. Any further development of her atrophied social skills would be too taxing and potentially jeopardize her ability to take full advantage of the library.</p><p>“Psst, Hermione,” Draco said loudly near her ear.</p><p>Hermione tried not to jump out of her chair, scowling at him. “You know I hate when people speak in libraries,” she hissed, at a far more appropriate volume. Draco had already told her that this was a baseless pet peeve in the wizarding world, especially in a library used primarily by adults, since anyone wishing to be left undisturbed could cast a silencing charm. But Hermione couldn’t help the effect of so many hours spent in muggle libraries in her formative years, and his talking bothered her just the same.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, but Hermione knew by now that the gesture was more fond than sincerely irritated. She also knew that he wouldn’t stop bothering her now that he’d decided he needed her to amuse him, so she closed her book and twisted on the bench to face him. He had sat angled toward her but with his legs away from the table, and she could see from his casual robes that he hadn’t been at his apprenticeship that morning.</p><p>“At least whisper,” Hermione murmured stubbornly. “I take it Lord Nelson is traveling somewhere that doesn’t take kindly to minor apprentices again?”</p><p>Draco’s apprenticeship with the Ministry’s ICW delegate was prestigious if fickle. Lord Nelson often evaded Draco’s company by claiming this or that foreign body prohibited children from accompanying the delegates. Still, Draco had done a lot of traveling and met three heads of state. If Hermione hadn’t had the library, she might have even been jealous.</p><p>“Yes,” Draco muttered. “But mummy took me shopping to cheer me up.” He brightened. “I got a pair of blue knee high dragonhide boots. Very sophisticated.”</p><p>“Mmm.” Hermione hoped her noncommittal noise didn’t betray her skepticism.</p><p>“Is Scary Mary done with you yet? It’s Saturday! Surely she won’t know if you skive off.”</p><p>“What did you have in mind?” Rosemary Longbottom Black Redington wouldn’t know, and if she did, she wouldn’t care. She had specifically told Hermione that she spent too much time in libraries for a young girl, and should spend her Saturdays getting more sunlight before she wilted like a sad plant.</p><p>“My mother is at the spa and my father is at the hunting lodge in Switzerland this week. Pansy is coming to the manor so that we can stay up late and transfigure water into whiskey until the elves figure out what we’re doing and threaten to fetch mummy. It’s a tradition.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t deny a certain amount of intrigue. She’d been spending the summer with the Potters, an easy floo from the Ministry, and going home to her parents’ most weekends. But her parents were on holiday and while Hermione was somewhat star struck by Lily Potter, she and Harry had gotten off to such an awkward start that they didn’t really try to be friendly with each other anymore. Draco had arranged the accommodations and while Hermione was grateful and it had gone more or less smoothly so far, she wasn’t looking forward to an entire weekend there with nothing to do.</p><p>“Your parents leave you home alone all weekend?”</p><p>“Not intentionally,” Draco said smugly. “They think I’m going to Pansy’s.”</p><p>“All right,” Hermione said uncertainly. For someone who prided herself on being sensible, she had a way of getting caught up in Draco’s excitement and carried far off the course she would have plotted for herself. “Should I invite Harry?” It seemed like the polite thing to do, since she was staying with him and he was in their year.</p><p>To her relief, Draco made a face of feigned horror as though she couldn’t possibly be serious. Hermione laughed, and Draco grinned back at her.</p><p>Draco’s features, so refined they were sharp when he was sad or angry, lit up in a beautiful way when he smiled, which was most of the time when they were alone together. He sometimes reminded Hermione of a bird, all barely-contained energy and unconscious athletic grace.</p><p>“You won’t regret it,” Draco promised, and Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I’d better not,” she said, smiling, and forgetting to whisper.</p><p>She didn’t.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Harry didn’t know what he was missing, or his evening alone at 12 Grimmauld Place might have started off even more bleakly than it did. As it was, with nothing to compare it to, being solitary in the dark and hostile House was merely boring. He wandered the rooms on the ground floor, noticing how nicely the paint colors Lily had chosen set off the carved woodwork, some of which was sluggishly animated, as though the carved figures there didn’t think Harry was worth the effort to impress.</p><p>As he sometimes had over the summer when he was desperate to be entertained, Harry climbed the staircase to the attic and sat cross-legged outside the firmly closed door to the chamber where the a thousand-year-old hive of pixies had been moved during the renovations. Lily had negotiated and Sirius had signed, a lengthy treaty with the queen of said hive. The conditions included the hive relocating from the third floor bathroom and promising never to take blood from a nonconsenting human, even if it was “just a bit” and the human was “asleep anyway” and the bite “barely left a scar.” Harry rubbed the still-red mark by his right elbow with a scowl, and soon the pixie sentry appeared through the keyhole on the door.</p><p>“What the bloody hell are you doing here, man?” The pixie asked. “We don’t need supplies for two more days.”</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes so he could better make out the sentry’s facial features in the poor light of the lampless hallway. All he had was the last of the evenings sunlight through the window directly behind him. The pixie was small, even for a pixie; roughly the size of a small moth, with sparkly fuschia wings. He wore a tiny loin cloth and nothing else, and his skin was a faint green hue that did not complement his wings at all.</p><p>“I was just checking in,” Harry lied. “Doesn’t my mother do that at night, when she’s about?”</p><p>“No,” the pixie said flatly. “Get lost.”</p><p>“Rude,” Harry observed. “I’m not in your territory, so you can’t make me go.”</p><p>The pixie had been hovering at Harry’s eye level, but now it rose to perch on the door knob, where it could fold its arms and scowl better. “Lurking around and acting like a dick conflicts with the spirit of our treaty,” the pixie said.</p><p>“You don’t sound like a several hundred year old magical creature,” Harry observed. “You sound like a twelve year old smartass.”</p><p>“I haven’t been speaking English that long. I probably sound appropriately archaic when I speak in a Celtic tongue, or old German.”</p><p>“How many languages do you know?” Harry was surprised. “I figured you all just...” he was going to say “spoke English,” but of course a mere moment of reflection made that supposition seem horribly naive and ethnocentric.</p><p>The pixie continued to scowl, but now it unfolded one arm to inspect its fingernails, a preening gesture, Harry thought. “We speak the language of any host, like proper parasites.” The pixie called itself a parasite rather matter of factly, Harry thought, but then again there was nothing intrinsically negative about the word.</p><p>“The Blacks were celts, originally,” Harry remembered, thinking out loud. “Your hive has been here longer than that bathroom, I guess.”</p><p>“As you’d know if you had paid attention during the treaty summit,” the sentry said. “But you didn’t grace us with your presence.”</p><p>Harry had still been feeling hostile about all the bloodletting he’d been subject to while unconscious, and the specialist had thought it best he keep his distance.</p><p>“Well, I’ll be going, then,” Harry said, wondering what the pixies did hour after hour, day after day in their hive that made the years pass tolerably. “What do you, um, have planned this weekend?”</p><p>The pixie gave him a blank look. “Big party,” it deadpanned. “I’d invite you, but we’re already at capacity.”</p><p>Harry matched the pixie's scowl and went downstairs.</p>
