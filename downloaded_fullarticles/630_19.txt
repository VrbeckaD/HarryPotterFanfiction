    <p>Authors Notes: This is planned at being a long series and this part I plan to end just as Harry gets his Letter. Resuming after that for his Hogwarts years for a Sequel, and a third Sequel is planned for afterwards. For this one in particular there will be Fluff at most and not a whole lot. It is more of a family/bonding/hurt/comfort type of deal without adding in too much detail to the abuse that happened prior.</p><hr/><p>
  <b>For the better?</b>
</p><p>The sky was cloudy and it was a chilly morning in Little Whinging, Surrey. Young Harry did not know this of course. He was locked away in his cupboard, not seeing the light of day aside from the crack under the door. He was lucky he could make out shadows from the tiny room with how bad his eyesight was. Harry heard the sliding lock on his cupboard click open, signaling hit was time to start doing chores. The first chore on his list since I was the first day of the week, and a school day, was breakfast. He was currently six years old, just turning that age over the summer. He only knew about his birthday from hearing his Aunt Petunia complaining and signing about it to Uncle Vernon over the summer. She was sighing and complaining only because they would have to enroll him in school to keep up appearances with the neighbors she so hated. They were just really nosy. This caused many arguments between Vernon and Petunia which resulted in Harry being punished for existing. The punishment was that Harry had been locked up for a week over the summer without daylight or anything aside from moldy bread, water and his bucket.</p><p>Today however, Harry was lucky enough to have stale bread to make a sandwich for his school lunch as he had to go there with Dudley later on today. He had been to the school for a week so far and this was the start of the second week. He still had to get up with Petunia around 5:30am though. Plenty of time to get breakfast started for her Duddykins. Petunia was annoyed that Harry wasn't big enough to do the breakfast all on his own as she had to get up at the crack of dawn, mostly to hand him the cooking utensils he couldn't reach. If he was tall enough she would happily still be asleep and just leave his door unlatched so he could do it all himself.</p><p>Petunia was feeling generous, but also because it was the first day of the school week and he was due for one anyway, so it was bath day for Harry. So before starting on breakfast, she ushered him into the bathroom and proceeded to scrub him nearly raw with all the filth he had had from the previous week. Harry struggled not to squirm out of her reach, knowing If he did he would be punished again like the last time. Like any time really. Last time he did squirm he was smacked so hard he nearly crashed into the side of the tub.</p><p>"Sit still, boy." Petunia said as she gripped said boy by the hair and sighed as it needed to be cut again. She had cut his hair a few weeks ago and it currently looked as if she hadn't even touched it. She knew it was probably some sort of freakishness considering who his parents were. She wouldn't tell Vernon about these minor instances of freakishness as it would set Vernon on edge. If it was more major she would not resist telling him and knew he would probably try to beat the freakishness out with his belt buckle and all. As it was whenever he did have a punishment it was dealt out over the weekend to give him time to heal before school.</p><hr/><p>Harry, by now, learned the hard way not to be smarter than his cousin. He had earned a severe beating from Vernon over the weekend for getting an A in one of their activities for class, having got 9/10 words correct. Dudley meanwhile had gotten a C, only getting 5 of the words correct. So it was no surprise that he was currently running from the oaf for correcting him in class earlier. Dudley and his friends came up with a new game the first week of school that they were currently trying to recruit Harry into playing. This game was called 'Harry Hunting'. So Harry was running from them, narrowly missing them when he suddenly ended up on the roof. He was shocked and unsure how he got there nor how he was going to be able to get down.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the muggle children or Harry, he had been watched for the past week and again this week as well. One of Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters tasked himself with stalking this child who looked nothing like someone who would vanquish anything. Barty grinned when the lead he had gotten off of Severus turned out to be viable. He had to give an unbreakable vow for Severus to even divulge any information he had overheard from Dumbledore as to young Harry's whereabouts. Barty had to tell of his intentions for the boy and had to vow not to seriously harm not kill the boy, aside from whatever blood would be needed for the potion he was planning on using.</p><p>Barty had suspected that Severus' loyalties were not to the dark at the moment as they once had been. He had been wavering a lot since the Dark Lord vanished. Barty was just glad he had agreed to help, even with a vow being needed to get him to even help in the first place. That man was just stubborn and more so since the Dark Lord was gone. But without his help Barty would not currently be outside of the school he was watching Harry from. He hated being around these stupid muggles, but he still did not know where Harry lived so this was at least a reliable location none the less. He knew Harry was six and was not surprised to see him running by the border that Barty was snooping behind, but what surprised both of them was that Harry just apparated flawlessly onto the roof. Barty saw this as a perfect opportunity.</p><p>Barty then made the quick decision to follow Harry onto the roof, apparating just a little bit in front of him. He did this mostly not to startle the boy too much so he wouldn't slip and fall off the roof. He would not be useful dead, Barty would also probably get killed by the vow if that happened as well. He planned to securely grab Harry from there and bring him to the manor now rather than later. Harry was shocked but not startled when a man appeared out of thin air in front of him on the roof. He was still unsure how he even got up there, but to have someone else do the same was even more peculiar. How did this happen? It most certainly was not normal and Uncle Vernon would strangle him once he found out about this bout of 'Freakishness'.</p><p>Barty looked thoughtfully to Harry, choosing to be kind to the boy as to ease him into trusting him sooner so he could grab him before those filthy muggles came around and saw the ordeal. "Hello Harry. You don't know me but I can help you get down from here if you can trust me." He didn't wait for Harry to respond but slowly made his way over to the boy. Harry, after a few moments to think things over, nodded his acceptance. "Just grab my arm and hold on tight. Do not let go." Barty waited to see if Harry agreed again, knowing to be patient to a child in general. Harry nodded again but instead of holding onto Barty's arm, clung to him instead. Barty wondered if there was something wrong with this picture and chose to look into it after. They apparated away to the destination of the manor.</p><p>Harry felt a really weird tugging sensation at his navel as his head started spinning, shutting his eyes helped. Barty made sure he held on tight, tapping Harry on the shoulder once they had made it to Riddle Manor. "You can let go now, Harry. I brought us somewhere safe. I know you must be confused but for now hold any questions you may have and just follow me." Barty said as he started to lead Harry inside the property of a rundown looking building, until they walked through the wards.</p><p>Harry still felt dizzy but let go of the man who he went along with, now realizing how stupid it was to give his trust over to someone who brought him to an abandoned looking building. He was beginning to think he should not have so readily went along with this stranger, but anything was better than the punishment waiting for him at the hands of Uncle Vernon. He felt something that made his skin tingle as he followed the stranger to the abandoned looking building. He gulped when it started to change appearance as they walked closer to it. Once it changed he couldn't believe his eyes as he gawked at what now stood out as a Beautifully kept Manor. The manor had a nice siding of brick and stone and a luscious garden Harry really would like to explore if given the opportunity to do so. He was lead to a bedroom on the first floor when he was about to ask a question only to be told to wait. He was then left alone as the man left the room and locked the door. Harry heard the click of a lock, otherwise he would have tried to see if it was unlocked. He sighed and took in the scenery of the room.</p><hr/><p>Barty left Harry in one of the unused bedrooms that occupy the manor, locking him securely inside so he wouldn't wander around. He did not trust any of the other Death Eaters in the Manor not to harm him if they found him before Barty had the chance to go over the plans and explain. He walked down the hall on the second floor towards the library, hoping to find some inner circle members he hoped were there. Luckily when he entered the library, Narcissa, Lucius and Severus were holed up in there chatting.</p><p>Barty wanted Narcissa to give Harry a health check before and after the extraction of the blood he would need. He had a hunch something odd may come up on the scans so he wanted her to do a thorough health check, the boy was just too small. He needed the blood for the Resurrection Potion he was going to use to revive their Lord. Before going ahead with that, he wanted to discuss it with Severus since he would be tending to the potion as the steps were taken. Then there was the fact that he would have to let the other inner and outer circle members in on their plans and deliberate before any of this could be accomplished. Step one was complete. They had the boy!</p><p> </p><p> </p>
