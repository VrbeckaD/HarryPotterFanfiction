    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Harry Potter stood still and if it wasn't for his chest heaving, one would think he was a statue. The war had come and gone he had finally defeated Voldemort the bane of his life since he was a mere child.</p><p>Around him people were eerily quiet, not believing it was finally over. It was only when the scream from Molly Weasley that people seem to snap out of it and began moving. Some helping the injured while others found their family and friends. Poppy Pomfrey was checking as many people as she could before ordering them into separate areas of the great hall depending on how serious their injuries were.</p><p>Members of the ministry were ordered to collect the dead no matter who they fought fo,r they deserved to be treated like anyone else. A small hand came to rest on Harry's shoulder. The young man lowered his head the tears finally winning out.</p><p>"It's over now Potter."</p><p>"Is it?" Harry said not lifting his head as he spoke to Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>"Come, let Madam Pomfrey check you over."</p><p>"Yeah in a minute." Harry said finally looking up and giving his Professor a small sad smile.</p><p>"Make sure you do Harry." The witch squeezed his shoulder before turning and ordering someone to bring a stretcher.</p><p>Finally Harry moved the sound of his name being called. Instead of turning to face one of his best friends he headed towards the forest. All the while his friend's shouts following him. The once deadly whomping willow now no longer able to protect the secret entrance to the shrieking shack.</p><p>Walking through the tunnel he closed his eyes for a moment to brace himself for the sight that was to come before him. Severus Snape had taken his last breath only hours before his eyes staring blankly back at Harry's. Opening his eyes he stepped into the room that held the former potions master's body.</p><p>Harry frowned in confusion. He could have sworn the man had died in the room he was standing in. There was no sign of any disturbance for quite sometime. Dust lay thickly on the wooden floor. Moving from one room to another he check each and everyone only to come up empty handed.</p><p>"Harry?" Hermione called out startling the young wizard. "Harry what are you doing here?"</p><p>"I wanted to bring Professor Snape's body out."</p><p>"Body? What are you talking about Harry? Professor Snape is up at the castle helping Madam Pomfrey in the great hall."</p><p>"No it can't be you were here, you saw him die too."</p><p>"Harry what are you talking about? Come on everyone is getting worried about you." Gently taking his arm Hermione lead him out of the shack.</p><p>Hermione was worried for her friend. She checked his head for any obvious bleeding, however she only saw scratchers on his face and dirt from when he got thrown back by the final blow that destroyed Voldemort. No one knew where Harry had gone only hours before the finally battle. Everyone else was busy preparing the castle and securing the grounds while herself and Ron had gone to find the last horcrux. He wasn't there for the beginning of the battle however he was brought forward in the arms of Hagrid surrounded by death eaters and the dark lord himself leading them.</p><p>Even the young witch had difficulty remembering what happened next. Everything was now just a blur, but no doubt in time it would come back to her. The grief of her friends and Fred one she considered her brother. She had left her boyfriend's side to follow her friend.</p><p>Harry stared up at the broken castle, people still milling around gathering the dead. It would seem that the injured had already been taken inside. White sheets laid upon those who had lost their lives until they could be moved. People stopped what they were doing and watched as Hermione continued to hold the saviours arm leading him towards the castle.</p><p>The large doors hung precariously on their hinges, glass was crunching underfoot. No one took any notice of the couple as they walked further into the hall. Harry looked around taking in the damage not only to the hall, but the people too.</p><p>It was only when he caught sight of billowing robes and black hair walking away from him did the young wizard seem to snap out of his daze. Wrenching his arm from his friends grip he started running towards the wizard. As though sensing something was wrong Professor Snape turned only to be engulfed in strong small arms wrapping around his waist and a crop of black messy hair pressed against his chest.</p><p>Startled Severus went to push the boy back only to stop himself and allow his arms to wrap around the boy and hug him closer to himself. Looking up he spotted Minerva and young Granger looking as confused as he felt.</p><p>"I thought you were dead," the young man sobbed into his chest.</p><p>"I'm perfectly well, Potter."</p><p>Harry hugged him tighter as he felt the professor try and dislodge himself from his embrace. Sighing the older wizard removed one arm and gently lead Harry to a bed that he had quickly conjured up.</p><p>"Lay down Potter I need to check you out." Poppy said her voice firm, but caring at the same time.</p><p>Severus gently pushed the raven haired wizard onto the cot bed finally being able to get out of the boys strong grip of his robes. No sooner had he done that Harry started whimpering like a dog grasping thin air trying to make contact with his potions professor.</p><p>Grumbling the older wizard took the younger man's hand in his. "Lay down and let Madam Pomfrey check you over."</p><p>"Don't leave me." Harry said looking scared.</p><p>The wizard was just about ready to sneer at Harry only for Poppy to give him a look that told him not to dare move. Sighing he patted Harry's hand before pushing him down onto his back so he could be checked over for injuries. After a few checks with her wand he was declared very much in tact save for the few scratches.</p><p>"Well everything seems fine. However Potter you are exhausted and under nourished. You are to drink both of these." she said holding up two vials.</p><p>"I don't want to sleep." he said turning his head away from her.</p><p>"Don't make me force it down your throat." Snape finally snapped sick of the pampering the young wizard was getting.</p><p>Harry flinched at the anger in the professor's voice yet didn't move to take the vials.</p><p>"I promise professor Snape will be here when you wake up." Poppy said.</p><p>"Promise?" Harry said finally facing them looking up into dark eyes.</p><p>After a few brief seconds and a heel on his foot from Poppy, Severus nodded. Smiling Harry took the vials and drank them both down without protest and soon his eyes fluttered closed. Poppy had given him a very strong dreamless potion so the young man would sleep for at least eight hours. With an easy flick of her wand Poppy had Harry in a clean set of pajamas before tucking him in.</p><p>"What pray tell was that all about?" Minerva said following an angry looking Snape.</p><p>"Obviously the boy has been damaged in the head." his eyes refusing to meet the witches.</p><p>"You may have convinced Tom Riddle with your lies but you can't fool me Severus." Minerva sighed.</p><p>The potions teacher didn't stop and he continued up to the headmaster's office. The gargoyle let him without a password. Snape stopped and gently patted the statue. "You know what to do."</p><p>Walking into the office he noticed that all the previous headmasters and headmistresses had abandoned their frames no doubt going to check on the damage to the school. Sighing Severus opened the top draw and pulled out a photo running his thumb gently over the moving photo. Hearing footsteps coming up the winding steps he quickly placed the photo back in the drawer before charming it. Standing he went to the drinks cabinet and poured two fire whiskeys.</p><p>Turning he handed the glass over to his friend. "Sorry for your loss." he said going to sit down only to be pulled into strong arms and hugged.</p><p>"Sev, he did it."</p><p>The former potions master finally broke and his knees buckled from beneath him sobs racked his body, the pair sunk to the floor the glasses smashed the whiskey soaking their robes. How long they stayed in that position nobody knew for it didn't matter. Everyone was safe in the castle.</p><p>Charlie Weasley was the secret keeper to Albus Dumbledore it was only he that knew the true meaning of the relationship between Severus Snape and Harry Potter. The once former student was the only person whom the spy could turn to in times of worry and despair. The redhead caught a glimpse of Albus returning to his portrait. He looked down at the man who had given up so much to protect his best friends son.</p><p>"You should rest my boys." he said kindly, not surprised to see the man he had seen grow from a scared eleven year old, who stepped through the doors of Hogwarts to a devoted allie all in the name of love. Severus struggled to make any friends other than Lily Evans. None of his Slytherin family trusted him for his friendship with the Gryffindor.</p><p>"I must get back to work." Severus pulled back and stood casting a quick spell to clean up the mess.</p><p>Charlie was about to protest only to be stopped by a patronus who went straight to the headmaster. 'Harry must be waking' he thought to himself. He couldn't help the small smile that threatened to become a full blown smile. Charlie chuckled lightly only to get glared at by Snape. Holding up his hands in peace the young wizard inclined his head to Albus before patting Severus on the shoulder leaving him to straighten himself out before he went down to the great hall.</p><p>Once the door was closed the wizard looked at the man who had come to consider his father in so many ways yet at times hated the man for making him do what he had done. Albus looked at him sadly knowing what was going through his head.</p><p>"Forgive me son. There was no other way." Albus said.</p><p>"There is always another way."</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>"What am I to do now?"</p><p>"Be honest to yourself and to he who you love."</p><p>Severus nodded and headed to the door masking his face to the usual scowl he wore. Just as he was about to close the door behind him Dumbledore spoke.</p><p>"Be kind to the boy, he has a lot to figure out and blames himself for so many deaths. Take him from here."</p><p>Severus didn't pause and continued to the great hall.</p><p>"You requested me Poppy?"</p><p>"The ministry are demanding to speak to Potter. He is not ready to be questioned."</p><p>"Very well I will speak to the minister." he said leaving the still sleeping hero.</p><p>Kingsley was talking loudly to Minerva at the entrance. Severus tugged on his robes and stood his full height.</p><p>"Snape tell Minerva that I have full authority to speak to Harry as I see fit."</p><p>"You are correct that you don't have to listen to Professor McGonagall, however as Headmaster it is I that decides whom Potter will speak to and when."</p><p>"As minister…"</p><p>"You have no authority over my students in my care. I ask that you leave and assure you Mr Potter will speak to you when he is willing and able. Now if you would kindly remove yourself from here so that we may continue with our work."</p><p>Kingsley spluttered and stuttered only to get a raised eyebrow from Snape before he turned and walked away. The headmaster knew Kingsley would need to talk to Harry and was a good man even a friend to the young hero. However first he must rest and grieve with his friends. How long that took would depend on himself and Poppy.</p><p>"Professor?"</p><p>Severus paused and looked down at Hermione Granger the girl who had been a vital part of the defeat of the dark lord. "Miss Granger I am now headmaster of this school and such you will address me as that or sir."</p><p>"Sorry of course sir." she blushed. "I was wondering if I may have a word?"</p><p>"Very well it shall have to be quick as I have things to be getting on with." he growled before turning and walking briskly making the young witch jog to keep up with them.</p><p>As soon as they were out of the hall he slowed down letting her walk at a normal pace. "Harry believes he saw you die in front of us in the shrieking shack."</p><p>Snape pulled out his wand and aimed it at a statue and waved his wand. There before her stood Ron. Gasping she went forward and touched the once statue who chuckled before poking her back.</p><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>"Not all things are written in a book Miss Granger."</p><p>Hermione turned back to see Harry himself standing beside Ron on the other side Voldemort. The girl squeaked in surprise, but knew for a fact the man was dead and he most certainly never wore a pink tutu.</p><p>"But why sir?" she asked as the statues turned back to themselves.</p><p>"To keep him safe. Now if that is all Miss Granger I must get on." Snape went to go back to the great hall.</p><p>"I'm glad he has you headmaster." Hermione walked in the other direction leaving Snape confused.</p><p>Harry was just stirring when he arrived and sat down on the chair he had conjured up for himself. Unsure how this would turn out he sat and waited until the young wizard opened his eyes his hand automatically going for his glasses that he normally set beside him each night. Severus took Harry's glasses from his robe and put them into Harry's hand.</p><p>"Thanks," he said before he put them on.</p><p>"Your welcome."</p><p>Harry blinked tempted to rub his eyes to make sure his eyes weren't playing tricks on him. Sitting beside him was the man whom he thought had died.</p>
