    <p>Ginny put her nontuple espresso down on <i>Madame Lonelyheart’s Coffehouse</i> café table with a decisive crash.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re going to be up until infinity o’clock or so in the morning because of that, you know,” Luna said mildly. “You really might be better off with an Amphetamine potion if you need extra energy. Would you like me to brew you some when we get back to the flat tonight? You do seem a bit <i>snappish</i> lately—“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not snappish at all!” snapped Ginny. “I’m just trying to figure out why you keep talking to Draco Malfoy when we both know that he’s nothing but a piece of evil puppy-torturing small-kitten-drowning scum who undoubtedly doesn’t ‘mind the gap’ when instructed to do so in the Underground!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You do seem to have given his character quite a bit of thought,” Luna said mildly, “considering that you haven’t spoken to him since Hogwarts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I haven’t given him any thought at all,” said Ginny. “I haven’t noticed him any longer than it takes me to push past him on my way to the office of the Junior Minister of Culture—why <i>does</i> that wing have to be so close to the elevator to the Department of Mysteries, by the way?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s the same elevator that goes everywhere else in the Ministry,” Luna pointed out, fairly enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny glared at her. “Yeah, well, then I’d like to understand why Draco Malfoy always seems just about to get in it while I’m in the middle of walking to Blaise Zabini’s office. It’s bad enough that I’m on my way to be sexually harassed whilst making my best attempt to show Zabini my sketches for those stupid statues. I shouldn’t have to see <i>Draco Malfoy</i> hanging about the elevator and staring at me like the specter at the feast as well. Why does he always <i>look</i> at me like that? He doesn’t ever even <i>say</i> anything. Well, not that I’d <i>want</i> him to say anything. Then I’d have to say something <i>back</i>. It’s bad enough that I feel obligated to look at him, just because he’s looking at me—“ Ginny broke off and rather abruptly downed the rest of her espresso at this point. Four years out of school, Draco Malfoy quite assuredly <i>was</i> something worth looking at, even under those dreadful florescent lights in all the Ministry corridors, and even with that strangely haunted look on his face that he always seemed to have when looking at her. Not that she would ever admit it. Not that she would ever remember… well, not that there even was anything to remember when it came to Draco Malfoy, because whatever it was that had almost happened between them all those years ago, had never really quite happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Anyway, none of this explains why I saw you having tea with him on Tuesday, Luna,” said Ginny, getting to the main point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s so awfully nice to catch up with old school friends,” Luna said vaguely. “Especially those who haven’t been struck down by the Creeping Calliopes from tropical climes. It’s so unfortunate whenever that occurs. And Draco’s right in the Department of Mysteries now, after all. Just a few floors away from the Department of Dreadfully Detailed and Remarkably Meaningless Memoranda. I’m supposed to get a new cubicle next week, did you know?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No.. I didn’t… I suppose this one will be larger than one foot square, well, congratulations, Luna… anyway,  the only <i>mystery</i>,” growled Ginny, “is how he managed to spread enough bribes around to clear the Malfoy name. I wouldn’t have thought that even the Malfoy money was enough for that. Maybe it was those exceptionally tight trousers he always wears. I can just picture him bending over in front of the chief justice of the Wizengamot, <i>supposedly</i> in order to pick up a stray Galleon from the floor, and then—“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thought you didn’t notice him at all,”Luna said mildly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t!” Ginny said through gritted teeth. Then she sighed. “I need a night out, Luna. Maybe Saturday, just for some moral support before going in to approve those marble columns for the sculptures on Monday…. What are you doing on Saturday? Want to try that new Irish pub I heard about in Hogsmeade?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sounds lovely,” said Luna. “I hear they have a traditional Irish bard who plays ballads about death and tragedy and battles where everyone got killed and all sorts of cheerful things.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just what I need,” said Ginny, getting up from the table. “Er… what’s Malfoy doing there, anyway?” she asked, as casually as she could. “In his work, I mean?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nobody knows, really,” said Luna. “That’s why it’s the Department of Mysteries.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How about this?” asked Ginny that afternoon, pushing the final set of sketches across the large walnut desk at the Junior Minister of Culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mm-hmm,” came a noncommittal voice from behind a copy of <i>Playwizard.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny glared at him. “Put that <i>down</i>. You’re supposed to be giving these your final approval.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise Zabini set the magazine down and leered at her. “I’ll give you final approval, all right.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re supposed to sign off on these, so I can start to work on those marble columns when they come in on Monday.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can start to work on a marble column right now. And you don’t have to wait until Monday.” He leaned across the desk and smiled at her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you don’t do this, then I’m going to have to go back to the drawing board!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve got your drawing board right here,” he drawled, putting his feet up on the desk and leaning back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>”<i>Zabini!</i> Do you even know what you’re talking about?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not really.” He shrugged. “But it’s got something to do with sex,right?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No! Not everything is about sex!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked genuinely confused. “It isn’t?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She sighed. “Blaise, why in the world did you take this job as Junior Minister of Culture?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because it’s a great way to pick up both gay boys and hot new girlfriends,” Blaise said promptly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t you care about the art at all?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You mean this job has something to do with art?” He looked even more confused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny smacked her forehead with her palm. “Look, will you just sign here and let me go home so I can relax, take a nice long bubble bath, and get ready for the weekend—and don’t you <i>dare</i> drool on these sketches, Zabini!” She waved her wand threateningly. “Don’t make me hex your balls into a knot again!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise winced. “Right, right. A rare moment of professionalism coming right up. Oh, by the way, while I’m temporarily <i>not</i> utterly obsessed with sex, let me ask you this—do you think you could put in a good word for me with Lovegood?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “Why don’t you just feed her the usual line about how honored she should be to shag the Great Zabini?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because somehow, I think it actually might not <i>work</i>. I really suspect that she’s got more than two brain cells to rub together. Quite unlike my usual conquests.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She does.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then why did you encourage me to try my normal approach?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny smiled. “Actually, I was planning to videotape Luna’s reaction to you and put it on HexTube. I think that the entire wizarding world would be very entertained by watching you run from a horde of Vengeful Vomiting Velicoraptors.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blaise gulped. Hastily, he scribbled his name across the contract she thrust at him. Then he peered past her, into the hallway, and his face creased into a frown. “Why the hell is Malfoy always standing by the elevators whenever you’re in here, Ginny?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You mean you’ve noticed it too?” she gasped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, I always thought my old mate was the hottest of the male hotties at Hogwarts, and he hasn’t cooled down even one little bit if you ask me,” said Blaise. “Can’t tell you how many times I’ve tried to convince him to take a walk on the wild side, but alas, he’s hetero as could be. And he’s been so bloody <i>serious</i> since he started that job at the Department of Mysteries. Downright glum. Still, those trousers of his are evil as ever, aren’t they… of <i>course</i> I notice anything he does. And whenever you’re about, Ginstress, so is he.”</p>
