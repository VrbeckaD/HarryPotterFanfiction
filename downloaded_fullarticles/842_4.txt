  <em> "They're singing deck the halls, but it's not like Christmas at all, I remember when you were here—"  </em>
</p><p>"Amanda. You're doing it again." </p><p>"Am not." </p><p>"Mariah." </p><p>"Shit." </p><p>"Careful, Erica will hear you. No swearing on shift," Draco chuckled. He readjusted the headband that was starting to press on the parts of his skull that you generally don't want to have pressed and smiled cheesily at his coworker. </p><p>"You know you don't have to wear that thing back here, right? Her control of Christmas <em> Fucking </em> Cheer does not yet extend to the stock room." </p><p>"And <em> you </em>know what my response to that is going to be."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. You really need this fucking job etcetera. Whatever. That doesn't mean she gets to terrorize you. You have enough of that in the rest of your life. By the way, has he—" </p><p>"Banned. Subject," Draco interjected with a very pointed glare up at her. She held up her hands in surrender. </p><p>"I just wanted to ask if—" </p><p>"Amanda," he warned. </p><p>She shook her head but did stop talking, in favour of holding out the reindeer pyjamas she'd just pulled down from the shelf. He took them, scanned them, and threw them in the box to the left.</p><p>He sighed at the completely unnecessary double-checking they were currently doing. "Mandy, if it has Santas and its been there all year, it's on clearout. I think we can safely assume she wants it out."</p><p>"That may be so," she said, gesturing with her own price gun, "but I have 30 minutes left, and if I'm here, I don't have to be out <em>there</em>. So shut it and take them one at a fucking time like I asked, my utterly gorgeous blonde Adonis and future boyfriend." </p><p>Draco took the next pair and chuckled, wagging a finger at her jokingly. "Fine, my magnanimous, raven-haired beauty," he teased. "But I'll remind you again, your compliments change nothing, darling." </p><p>She sighed, pouting in an exaggerated sadness that made him laugh. "Still gay, then?" </p><p>"As a lavender unicorn." </p><p>She shrugged at him, winked, and threw down a dusty case of frilly red panties, embellished with the words <em>ho ho ho.  </em></p><p>"Andrew!" a cranky voice called a moment later.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes so hard that it gave him a sharp pain in the back of his temple. "Do you think that's <em>my </em>name today, or is she trying to get <em> Andre's </em>attention?" he sighed, holding his scanner out to Amanda, already knowing the answer. "Back here, Erica!" </p><p>"Ah. There you are, Andrew. I—" </p><p>"<em>Draco, </em>" Amanda interrupted. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"His name. It's <em> Draco.</em>"</p><p>"Ah. Right," Erica answered with a hasty wave of her hand. "The weird name." </p><p>Amanda cleared her throat angrily, taking a step down from the ladder to glare at Erica. Draco shot her a begging, pleading sort of look that she of course ignored. </p><p>"I don't strictly think you're <em>allowed </em>to say anyone's name is 'weird' at work. Not to mention, it's kind of, you know, horrible. No matter where you are." </p><p>Draco winced. Amanda, always meaning well, was only just barely still employed. Even though he knew she didn't care, he really, <em> really </em>did and he did not want to be caught in the crossfire. </p><p>Erica, however, looked up for the first time in weeks. In fact, for practically the first time ever, she looked up as though she had just noticed that she was speaking to a <em> real </em>person, and not some sort of clothing-slinging, customer-service-programmed robot. She blinked once, looked between them, and then nodded sheepishly. </p><p>"Right. Yes. No. Of course, it is. I'm so sorry, Draco. That is obviously... not what I meant. I just—sorry." </p><p>"What can I do, Erica?" Draco replied, effectively seeming to calm her and ease her embarrassment. </p><p>"The floor is slammed. Whoever thought it was a good idea to do a pre-<em>pre-</em>sale can eat my—sorry, I just got off the phone with cooperate. It's been a long one." She exhaled slowly, gripping her ubiquitous clipboard tightly and closing her eyes. "Reminder that the bloody <em>music </em>changes tomorrow, and I don't. Want. To. Hear. About. It." </p><p>"I'm headed to the till," Draco said soothingly, shooting a murderous glance to Amanda, who just mouthed 'kiss-ass' at him. </p><p>Truthfully, Draco knew he was a kissass. He always had been, sort of. He felt comfortable there. </p><p>Still, the rest of his shift was spent with his stomach roiling at the thought of being fired so close to Christmas, and he sent a <em> very </em>explicit text to Amanda on his break. </p>
