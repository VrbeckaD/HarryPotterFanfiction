    <p>This was the third time Harry had given her that look. Currently, Tonks was sitting besides Remus’ grave, and Harry stood in front of her, with Teddy still in his arms. Tonks sighed and continued to silently trace the words on her husband’s grave. </p><p>She couldn’t remember how long she’d been sitting there. The serene breeze softly swept her locks, the way Remus sometimes would when he searched solace. She knew that Remus had loved her, but she couldn’t help but question if he only ever saw his life with her and Teddy as solace. He had lived through two wars, and he had done so all whilst suffering from his werewolf condition, hating himself for it. After all of his adventures as a Marauder, his service in the Order, he knew he could come home to his wife and his son. Remus saw his family as his solace. </p><p>She had long stopped crying, but she kept tracing the three words engraved on the elegant stone. Those three words seemed too small to reach the depths of love and joy that Remus had brought into the lives of the people who loved him. Her index brushed over the words one last time. Marauder. Husband. Father. A last tear rolled down her cheek. Slowly, Tonks stood up and brushed off her dress. The red dress she was wearing was the one she’d worn on the day Remus had proposed. Tonks’ throat tightened and she touched the necklace upon which her wedding ring dangled. </p><p>Tonks wasn’t sure when he’d left, but Harry had taken Teddy for a stroll, to give Tonks a moment. When Harry saw that she had stood up, he offered her a warm smile and started making his way back to Remus’ grave. Tonks reached for Teddy who also reached for her. Harry gave Tonks her son and put his arm around her shoulders. Tonks leaned into him. Harry gave her the look again, and Tonks’ heart softened at the thought that he worried for her.</p><p>“Harry, I appreciate your worrying,” her voice was hoarse, “but today everyone has been offering their condolences, their support and right now all I want is to give Teddy a nice bath, and take a nap.”</p><p>“I understand,” Harry’s voice was distant, he had been to so many ceremonies and funerals that he would gladly go back to his newly acquired loft and sleep for a week. But he was the boy who lived, he had people approaching him, he had been interrogated at the ministry on the events of the battle. He had barely had time to rest. </p><p>“I’m very grateful that you’re here Harry,” she faced him, “I know you must be very busy, but you have to take care of yourself too, you need rest.”</p><p>Harry loved Tonks the way he loved Hermione, and the fact that Remus had chosen him as Teddy’s godfather was a blessing. And so, when Tonks invited him over for tea, he gladly said yes. Upon entering into the Lupin home, Harry first noticed that the place smelled faintly of Remus, he then noticed that the house held not only his scent, but traces of his presence. The living room was full of stacks of books, a few chocolate bars were stashed neatly besides the couch and a couple of photographs were hung on the wall.</p><p>One of them was a moving picture of a young Sirius Black who roughly swung his arm around an unsuspecting young Remus’ neck. Their Gryffindor uniforms were the same, but Remus wore them neatly, whereas Sirius’ robes were a mess. They must have been around fifteen, Sirius’ earnest display of affection and his playful smile contrasted with Remus’ surprised look. And for a second, when Remus realizes that it’s Sirius, there is a glint in his eyes. Harry stood by the picture, and naturally he thought of his parents. </p><p>“You know Remus has a full album of pictures of his Hogwarts years, we can look at it if you want.” She knew why Remus never touched the drawer that contained what little remained of his Hogwarts life. James and Lily’s tragic deaths, Peter’s betrayal, what could’ve been with Sirius, it was all too painful. </p><p>And so, with Teddy nested in her arms, Tonks showed Harry the album. They were sat on the small couch, and the closeness to each other was comfortable. The pictures were sometimes funny, but one of them had Harry’s eyes tearing up. James Potter sported a charming smile as he pointed at Lily, who rolling her eyes but seemed amused nonetheless. They were standing underneath mistletoe. They were in the Gryffindor common room, standing by the fireplace. Sirius’ hair poked in the bottom left corner of the picture and Harry could picture Peter, Sirius and Remus all cheering on James from behind the couch that faced the fireplace. Had they been the ones to enchant the mistletoe? Probably. 

Tonks’ words suddenly interrupted his thoughts.</p><p>“You know, Remus had to go to your parents’ funeral alone.” Her voice barely above a whisper, “he only told me once, that he had been alone at the funeral. Your parents and Sirius, Remus and even Peter, they suffered so much.”</p><p>Harry nodded and took a deep breath. “But they also loved and lived bravely. I’ve always thought that my dad had to sweep my mom off her feet to take her on the greatest adventures. And I think that you still have your own adventures to live Tonks. With Teddy, with us, your family and friends, and even...”</p><p>Tonks held her breath, she knew he would say something about it. How she could find love again.</p><p>“And even find another special person to bring along your adventures.” Harry then hugged Tonks and left to go to dinner with Ron, Hermione and Hagrid. </p><p>That night, as Teddy snored lightly besides her, Tonks thought about what Harry had said. Tonks then thought of the picture that hung in her living room, Sirius and Remus had been each other’s adventures at some point, that much she knew. “Maybe,” she thought, “I don’t want to be someone’s solace, maybe I want to be someone’s adventure.”</p>
