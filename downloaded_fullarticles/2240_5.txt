    <p>She knew that this was not proper and she would be punished as soon as the idea floated into her brain. But there was something about the temptation that made it irresistible.</p><p>Her parents would never forgive her for this, and her brother would feel disappointed in her. But somehow that did not seem important.</p><p>She reached, standing on the tips of her toes as she had been taught in ballet, and twisted the mahogany knob. The door swung upon, revealing all she had hoped for.</p><p>Her breath caught at the wondrous sight she was beholding.</p><p>Vivid colours all tangled up in a swirling mess that rather did not seem such a mess, after all, was what she saw. The colours blended together in harmony as they moved perfectly in sync in a counter clock-wise motion. Not one collection of colours was out of sync.</p><p>Ladies with men, men with ladies, stepping perfectly together. Each pair kept the right amount of distance between them as they showed off their skill in twirling and fancy steps. They were obviously showing off, perhaps to impress the lord and lady of this event.</p><p>The girl smiled, adoring the collection of colours that paired so seemingly well with each other.</p><p>No one else smiled. What seemed to her to be a festive occasion, was actually not. It was dignified, it was respectable, and it was not in the slightest bit enjoyable. The music was lifting and the dancing was impressive, and no one was enjoying it.</p><p>Small gracious smiles were painted on the people's faces as they twirled around, and around in the cursed dance of elegant facade. None of them wished to be here, but none of them would dare suffer the consequences. They had a reputation after all, and this was the opportune moment to revalidate their stake in the social ladder known as life.</p><p>Snide remarks were being passed out with the hors d'oeuvres and alcohol. It was a competition to see who could utterly crush the other's spirits the quickest.</p><p>The little girl did not see any of this. How would she? She did not yet know of the cruel truth that was the society she would enter in a mere few years. To her, this was a night of spectacular dancing and laughter. She could not see that the laughter was scripted to be at each other's expense.</p><p>Lupus Malfoy could not wait for her opportunity to join the grown-ups dance and be allowed in the elegantly carved ballroom.</p><p>The dancers all stopped in time with the music and bowed to each other. As they all started socializing, the girl could clearly see her mother.</p><p>Blonde hair like her offsprings', blue eyes that her entirely her own, and a bone structure her daughter dreamed of. She was the prettiest woman here, everyone was aware of that fact. She appeared only seventeen, the epitome of womanhood. This was Narcissa Malfoy, the woman the girl was proud to call her mother.</p><p>However, Lupus was not the only one to notice someone.</p><p>Blue eyes met the dark brown and the little girl knew that her mother would head over to her.</p><p>It was obvious she had been spotted, but her mother did not move an inch and her facial expression did not change in the slightest.</p><p>Lupus would not be getting attention from her mother today, that much was clear. She knew the reason why, but she still felt the hurt in her heart as she noticed a hand close the doors and then grab her arm.</p><p>She felt the sensation of disapparation and then she was back in the room that she so did not desire to be in.</p><p>The house elf disappeared after silently escorting her back.</p><p>She was relieved when he left. She absolutely despised the Rosier's house elf. He mirrored his owner in being cruel, quiet, and just overall strange.</p><p>Eager faces awaited her.</p><p>"What did you happen to see, Malfoy?" Daphne Greengrass, holding the hand of her little sister, asked.</p><p>Lupus smiled slyly. "It was beautiful Greengrass, dancing in sync that I bet none here could perform at half the talent."</p><p>This had the effect she hoped it would, on the person she hoped it would.</p><p>"Betting is a vulgar profession, and I believe you to be horribly incorrect about my skill level. Lupus Malfoy, will you do the honor of dancing with me so that I might prove you wrong?" Blaise Zabini stood up, offended. He was usually quite quiet, but when he became offended everyone would hear of this.</p><p>"You may." She nodded, taking his hand that he offered.</p><p>"Daphne, you're a female, would you like to dance with me? Parkinson, get the music," Draco, Lupus' twin brother, asked and then demanded. As he did.</p><p>Once the invitation was accepted and the music acquired, the two pairs started dancing, working their hardest to be in sync but also better dancers.</p><p>And so they danced the night away, Lupus still wishing to be with the adults but not understanding what she had here was so much better than anything they could ever have.</p>
