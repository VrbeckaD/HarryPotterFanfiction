    <p>Harry doesn't know why he bothers. </p><p>His life isn't all action and adventure anymore and it doesn't come with a steamy romance that's all fireworks and pent up sexual energy that can't be controlled. But he'll dare anyone to even attempt that kind of life when they have a demanding eight year old to raise alone. The most action he is likely to get now is the occasional big case at work and weekly Sunday dinners at the Burrow. That is how he likes it. He doesn't need the action and adventure with the steamy romance, <i>especially</i> the steamy romance. Because that's all his friends seem fixated on - his disastrous love life, or lack of as they are so keen to point out. Just because they're paired up doesn't mean he has to be. He's only twenty-six for God's sake, he has time. Maybe when Teddy is at Hogwarts and he doesn't have to be there for the boy twenty-four/seven; he'll get through every man and woman in England if it'll make them happy. But no, that's not good enough because that's not <i>now</i>.</p><p>That is how Harry finds himself on a date one Thursday night. He honestly doesn't know why he bothers voicing his opinions to his friends. Freedom of speech his ass. </p><p>It's not like there's anything wrong with the guy sitting across from him; he's nice looking, with floppy brown hair and light blue eyes that remind Harry of the sky on a clear day; he dresses up nicely without trying to show off wealth or desperately impress him, going for a more semi-casual look with faded jeans and a dark shirt; and he hasn't once mentioned the scar or the past. They talk about the weather and work, Quidditch and their players (and their asses). They laugh and they smile and Harry has a good time, genuinely so. But when they leave the restaurant, even his date knows that they're going their separate ways; they shake hands at the door and leave in opposite directions. </p><p>Because while Harry doesn't need the steamy romance part of the movie right now, he isn't saying that he doesn't want it at some point. He doesn't believe in all that crap about love at first sight; there's no elusive One that a person is meant to be with, who you fall instantly in love with. There needs to be time to get to know a person. Besides, he's so awkward in romantic situations that he probably wouldn't recognize it if it was true, even if it whacked him in the face and screamed at him. </p><p>(Fact One as to why the date wasn't ever going to go anywhere: He didn't blunder through the conversation and horribly embarrass himself like the idiot he's been known to be.) </p><p>But he does believe in <i>the spark</i>, the moment you see someone and everything else disappears and you just <i>know</i> that they could be special. You can't keep anything down because your stomach is so tied up in knots that you're a little afraid of throwing up and you want to hear everything they have to say but understand very little because you can't stop staring at some part of them and <i>wonder</i>. They become all you think about the more you know them and can pick them out in a crowded room.</p><p>(Fact two as to why the date wasn't ever going to go anywhere: He didn't get any of that.) </p><p>Harry believes in it because he's felt it before. Just once. Technically. He feels it all the time, but it's always around just one man. No one else has ever turned him into such a mess with a simple glance his way or with a smile. (<i>God, that smile</i>.) Not even Ginny; sure, he felt something one might consider close to it, but it faded too soon and talking to her became comfortable, easy, but not in the way he might have liked. She felt like a friend not a partner. </p><p>Though he won't lie, it's probably because he met the guy he wants when he was eleven and has wanted him since he was fifteen. Maybe if he hadn't, he would never know the difference and would be with Ginny right now and they would be something close to happy. </p><p>But despite hating that his guy won't see him the way he wants, Harry won't ever hate feeling this way. The very idea of not knowing what it feels like to be falling so completely in love is heartbreaking. </p><p>Ugh, his life would be so much easier if the idiot just realized he loved Harry the same way. </p><p>Harry let's himself into his empty house, torn between thankful that Teddy is staying at his grandmother's so can't pester him about the date and sad over coming back to said empty house. With Teddy gone, Harry heads toward the fridge in his flat's open plan living room and kitchen area, grabs the ice cream from the freezer and heads to his room. The jeans and shirt are replaced with sweatpants and a raggedy t-shirt and he picks the first horror movie he comes to, putting it into the DVD player before climbing under the covers and eating. </p><p>People need to lead worse lives than him and die tonight. Romantic comedies are always out after a date, he can't have other people happy, and porn is just depressing. They may be paid to fuck, but at least they're getting some. </p><p>Ice cream gone before the movie is even halfway through, Harry settles down under the sheets and prays for sleep to come without dreams of the guy he should have been out with and curses his terrible luck. </p><p>Only Harry Potter would fall for someone destined to become his best friend.</p>
