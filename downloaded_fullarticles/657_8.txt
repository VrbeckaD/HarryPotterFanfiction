  <strong>Chapter 1 Decisions, We make </strong>
</p><p>Hermione has always thought that Harry acts before he thinks. That also goes for Ron and it frustrates the witch all the more when she found out that Harry plans to meet his doom at the hands of the evilest tyrant she's ever had the chance to encounter. Although she knew why Harry had to do it. It always ate her that there was a huge chance Harry, himself might be an accidental Horcrux and for them to defeat Voldemort, he had to die.</p><p>But couldn't he just waited? </p><p>
  <em>Waited for what?</em>
</p><p>Goodbye, she guessed! Farewell or maybe promises for the future. Just something would have been ok. Words he could have left his best friends.</p><p>But he didn't and now, <strong>they</strong> have to wait. She has to wait. </p><p>Hermione was perched in a wall hiding from a death eater. She just needed to breathe. To think.</p><p>She felt a coldness in her hand, looking down at her dirtied finger she gazed down at a time turner. Nobody has ever known this but when they had to infiltrate the department of mysteries when Harry thought Sirius had been kidnapped and tortured back in their fifth year, she stole one before the battle took place. At the time, she had no idea why she did it. Maybe she thought she could use it if it came down to being necessary but she couldn't even force herself the idea of using it, not until now.</p><p>And the fact, that all the other time tuner was destroyed that day, it meant she holds in her hand the only remaining time tuner in the entire wizardly world. That was a heavy thought to have. The repercussion she will ultimately make if she were to use it, had paralyzed her from using it. The reason she never entertained it until now. </p><p>But, if Voldemort succeeds in this war, they were doomed. Muggles and wizards alike. It would put the world into chaos. She doesn't think there's any more 'necessary' situation than that.</p><p>The brunette couldn't help her throat constricting. "If I used it..." she mutter. <em>She can never come back.</em></p><p>She'd read the consequence in using the time turner for more than five hours and if she plans in using it. It would mean the end for her. But weighing out the good in her head, she felt bittersweet at the prospect that her life would have been worth it in the end. </p><p>Finally set on a decision, she clutched the time turner in her hand. A determined look on her face. If it comes to it, she'll be no better than Harry in saying goodbyes. </p><p>She gave deep and strangled breath, something close to a sob or a chuckle. </p><p>"Hermione" she looks up to see Ron finally spotting her. "Why are you crying? Are you hurt?!" </p><p>The brunette looks at Ron. Really looks at him. He looked like he crawled in an abandoned tunnel in the middle of a sewer. Hair messed up, face dirty and clothes that looked more black from the dust and smoke. She'd bet she'd looked worse.</p><p>She gave a small smile at him. Ron wasn't the best person to give you a compliment... or even study... or even read the atmosphere to save him but he is a great friend. Not perfect but everybody has flaws. It just so happens, Ron's insecure about everybody thinking they're better than him. Not even seeing how great he really is. </p><p>He may make her mad, and frustrated but he also makes her laugh and maybe happy he considered her his friend. </p><p>Hermione shakes her head before pocketing the time turner in her hand and wiping the tears in her eyes using her other hand. "I'm fine, Ron. Don't worry"</p><p>"But you were cryi-" Ron was cut when Hermione hugged him. It took Ron a full minute to register what Hermione did, before hugging the witch back. </p><p>"Should I be worried, Hermione? You seem off." Hermione chuckles and laughs at the statement. </p><p>She guessed she doesn't hug the big oaf as often as she has. She steps back from the embrace to face the boy. "You should be worried for Harry. He's the one who ran off without saying goodbye" </p><p>Ron smiled back at her too. "I know." His voice a little low and held much more than those two words. A meaning they both knew in their hearts. </p><p>Suddenly Hermione could feel something change in the air. Something dark, musty and... <em>death.</em> Hermione and Ron shared a look before they saw a few witches and wizards were walking outside.</p><p>She had a feeling she might finally know what had happened to Harry. Following the crowd, she heard someone scream. Looking outside, she saw Voldemort with his army of death eaters. And Hagrid carrying the lifeless body of Harry Potter, her best friend.</p><p>The brunette fairly expected it. Assumed he was going to do it. But nothing had prepared her into actually facing the time where Harry is no more.</p><p>"Stupid girl..." Voldemort turns to a distraught Ginny, restrained by her father. "Harry Potter is dead. From this day forth. You place your faith... in me" the look of pure joy in the eyes of the snake made Hermione angry. </p><p>"Harry Potter is dead!" Followed by the laughter of his followers. Hermione's hand inched closer to the time turner in her pocket. She saw Voldemort open up his hands to those who will change sides. She doesn't blame Malfoy when he was ushered by his parents to come to them.  Not when she noticed she neither saw the glee his eyes usually are whenever he finds something he enjoys. Because deep down, Hermione has a faint picture that he never wanted Harry dead, nor Dumbledore or anyone else. </p><p>But what made her gripped the time turner, even more, was when Neville began to edge himself on his feet towards Voldemort. Neville's eyes didn't display any fear nor the feeling of giving up. If anything, he looked like he wanted to end things himself. </p><p>Hermione didn't want to see another one of her friends die. She just can't anymore. When Neville placed his hands inside the sorting hat, Hermione had the same idea of pulling out the time turner. Turning her back to the scene, she just had to save herself from seeing this one death. Quickly she laced the time turner in her neck and began turning the hand with precise turns. </p><p>Her back might have been turned but she heard a lot in a span of minute. Ron screaming for her name. Neville roaring to life and Harry.</p><p>Hermione froze. Her hands let go of the time turners and turned around, just in time to see Harry sending a spell to Nagini. Just when she felt a surge of jubilation that Harry was alive, a hard fact hit her. She already turned the hand. She already put on the time turner. She already made her choice.</p><p>Hermione felt her body being pulled by something. Then she felt being sucked by a vortex. Then the feeling of falling.</p><p>Harry has always acted before he thinks. Maybe this time, Hermione pulled the trigger before looking where she aimed.</p>
