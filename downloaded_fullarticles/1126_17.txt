    <p>“Join me, Albus,” Gellert said, standing over him.</p><p>The room they were in was made of warm colours and comfortable furniture. Wooden shelves lined the walls, spilling with books and various pieces of astronomy equipment. A knitting basket lay on the side of the comfortable armchair Albus was sitting on. Behind him, there was a door that led deeper into the chambers, to his bedroom that was equally as comfortable and as to his tastes as the living room was. These rooms had been designed for him, with all the care and attentiveness it required. But for all the comfort the chambers offered, there was one thing they could not conceal.</p><p>Heavy manacles etched with runes bound Albus’ wrists, suppressing his magic. He was a prisoner here. Had been for some time now, ever since he had made a fatal mistake in their final duel, and Gellert had stripped him of his wand. Darkness had enveloped him then, and Albus had expected never to wake up again. But instead of the Afterlife, he had found himself coming back to consciousness in a comfortable fourposter bed, a soft blanket placed over him and the cuffs burning around his wrists.</p><p>Albus looked up at Gellert, the one dark spot in the room filled with warm shades. The expression on Gellert’s face was unreadable, his arms held behind his back and his black and silver eyes trained steadily on Albus’ face.</p><p>“We could rule together,” he said, softly, kneeling down next to Albus and enveloping his hand around his. “Be together, always.”</p><p>Albus said nothing and drew away his hand from Gellert’s hold.</p><p>Gellert’s fingers twitched, a hint of irritation flashing through his eyes. He rose to his full height, his face foreboding. “If you won’t join me, then- ” he said, letting the implied threat trail away into the air between them.</p><p>“You’ll kill me?” Albus stated calmly. The thought did not distress him any longer. He had made peace with the fact that he would most likely be killed by the only person he had ever loved long before their final confrontation. The sting of it had faded into a numb pain of acceptance that only rose into a dull throb on occasion when he was lying alone on his bed, his fingers itching for the person who was supposed to be lying next to him. </p><p>Gellert’s face had grown still at the question, his hands withdrawing back behind him. Albus scrutinised him for a moment, his eyes roaming over his familiar features, now weathered by age, but still handsome, looking for any hint of his true feelings.</p><p>“You can’t do it, can you?” he asked, his voice rising with creeping realisation. “You wish you could, but you can’t. You tried to use Credence to kill me, but in the end, you couldn’t." Gellert said nothing, but Albus could see the discomfort on his face. "What is holding you back, Gellert? Certainly not sentiment,” he asked, the final line not quite a question, but not a statement either.</p><p>Gellert’s lips were suddenly on his, cutting off his thoughts. Albus closed his eyes instinctively, the old, almost forgotten feeling of being kissed returning to him. Still, he could tell that this was different from their last embrace. Gellert’s lips were slightly chapped, and his moustache tickled Albus’ upper lip. His mouth tasted of a faint hint of ash instead of the lemony taste of Bathilda’s favourite tea. The kiss was hard, almost painful, where before their kisses had been playful and light.</p><p>After a moment, Gellert withdrew a few inches, his lips brushing softly against Albus as he breathed a confession into the air between them, “I love you.”</p><p>Albus opened his eyes, the illusion shattered. Gellert’s face was so close that it was hard to look at him, the curves of his face growing blurry around the edges. Albus leaned his head back, taking in Gellert’s expression. He found no love in his eyes, only the burning, suffocating feeling of ownership and possession. Albus’ eyes shuttered, and he raised a hand and placed it on Gellert’s cheek, causing him to flutter his eyes as he leaned into the touch.</p><p>Gently sweeping a thumb across Gellert’s high cheekbone, Albus told him, “You don’t love me.” Gellert’s eyes flew open, and he withdrew from Albus’ touch, indignant anger covering his features. The image of him grew smudged again as Albus felt his eyes fill with moisture. “If you loved me, you would let me go,” he said, his voice choked, trying to hold back his tears. He raised his hands, displaying the cuffs encircling his inflamed wrists.</p><p>“This isn’t love, Gellert. It’ll never be,” he whispered, his voice full of pity. Gellert’s nostrils flared, anger taking over him, consuming him as it had for all his life. He started to leave, but Albus grabbed him by the lapels of his suit, preventing him from rising. Framing his face with his hands, Albus kissed him. “Let me go, Gellert. Let me go,” he whispered.</p><p>Gellert gripped his hands tightly and tugged them away from his face. “No,” he hissed, his eyes burning, “I will not. Not ever.” A spot of spit flew from between his lips. Taking a deep breath, he kissed Albus’ hands before letting them drop back onto his lap. Gellert rose and smoothed down his coat, regarding him with only a hint of his previous anger. “I can be patient. You will change your mind eventually.”</p><p>Albus sighed and, exhausted, slumped back against his chair. “You will wait for a long time.”</p><p>Gellert said nothing more, ignoring him as he turned and strode out of the door.</p>
