<hr/><p align="center">November 1st, 1981 - Dursley House on Private Drive, England.</p>
<hr/><p>A sight that will have most people instantly hating the residents is on the steps of the Dursely Household porch. Already the Police have been called by the milkman who has been the first to notice the child all day. A small male toddler with snowy hair and golden topaz like eyes are staring around in confusion. Unknown to anyone, even the boy himself, he has been granted a 'pardon' of sorts by Death.</p><p>With that pardon comes the memories of his past life. One Killua Zoldyck has been reincarnated into the toddler, who quite well remembers the 'servant' his mother kept being nice to. His father was rude to Minky the House Elf and often abused and used her. Before he can stop himself to think he calls out. "Minky! I need you." He blinks at his perfect English before deciding to ignore the oddity of speaking clearly.</p><p>POP!</p><p>A sob echoes from his right side as the elf appears and grabs his tiny basket, which has been holding him all night. Harry stares up at her tearful eyes and allows her to pop him into the Potter Manor. She instantly places him in a playroom where there are all sorts of things a baby would love to play with... if only they had the right mind for it. Killua stands and walks over to the wall, touching it carefully as the elves watch him closely. He touches the wards with a tiny tendril of his magic.</p><p>"A barrier of some sort?" He asks earning a sharp inhalation from each of his elves.</p><p>"Master, that be the wards. The protect the house and you, young Master. Minky has a question... If you, Master, are willing to let us elves ask questions." He turns toward them, knowing that his best friend, Gon, would want him to be the best person he can be.</p><p>"I know that all of you are knowledgeable in your areas of expertise. If you feel that any of you need to ask a question, please do so freely." They give him a beaming smile filled with extreme happiness and pride. A few start to sway as if they are ready to faint at the kindness shown to them.</p><p>"Master, will you alter the wards? A fidelius is certainly necessary. It keeps secrets very secret." The elf looks worried as she speaks. Killua knows that she is more knowledgeable about it than he is so he reaches for her. She takes ahold of his hand and He draws both of their minds into the wards. He commands the wards with a sternness that surprises the elf with him.</p><p><em>"Wards, I command you to download, or instill, all the knowledge that is hidden within your reach into Minky and I. Afterward Minky and I will be discussing different protections to have you increase your protectiveness. In the meanwhile I want you to start drawing power from whatever natural energy source is nearby. Minky, do you know of one?"</em> He turns toward the light that is obviously his trusted elf servant as he realizes that they both look like orbs of light. She bobs up and down for several seconds.</p><p><em>"Minky knows of the Ley Lines under the castle. they are lines of power flowing just under the surface of the earth's skin. They also sometimes rise above, as they do here as they are extremely powerful lines."</em> Minky replies and Harry bobs again as he looks at the much bigger orb that must be the ward's conscious. He nods toward the ward's orb and it bobs once before completing his command immediately. Harry gets a mild headache as he processes it all as Minky starts whimpering and crying in pain.</p><p><em>"Wards, please slow down on Minky. And do something to soothe the pain. I have a higher pain tolerance and she seems to be going insane from the pain. Also, connect all the house elves to the wards, both the bonded and the not-bonded. Also, send a 'message' into the leylines to recruit house elves. Make sure they can access the message through whatever magic they have."</em> The house elf almost instantly sighs in relief as she stops immediately making the soul, wrenching noises. He goes over to her, with an idea, before he starts taking half of her pain.</p><p>The pain sharing technique is usually used by the Zoldycks to not bodily harm their torture subjects yet cause them extreme pain. Killua, being as smart as he is, decides on a whim to try it for his elf to give him pain. His orb begins fluctuating as he experiences more severe pain, though the wards thankfully keep the same pace and pain relief as they did before. After what feels like five days Minky comes back to awareness in the ward's space.</p><p><em>"Minky, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that would have hurt you. For now, we need to start going through the wards books." </em>An assortment of wards instantly pop into his mind and he is surprised by a modified Fidelius his mother created. <em>"Ward, the modified fidelius based on intent should be added. If you can start creating modified wards that cause pain, like torture kind of pain, to those who harm anyone, even if thinking that it is something completely normal. This includes harming the elves, servants, and hired workers."</em> Minky follows alongside his thoughts and starts helping to modify the wards within seconds before Harry tells them something else.</p><p><em>"Minky, Wards..." </em>They both become aware of him wanting something and so they focus on him. <em>"I want you both to be aware that Minky has permission to alter the wards. She also has the right to place the property into lockdown to protect me, the residents and guests."</em> Minky sobs audibly as she rubs her orb against him. her orb stiffens for some reason before detaching from him.</p><p><em>"Minky apologizes, Master! Minky should not have shared her magic with you, Master. This is horrible, Minky is a very bad elf! Master cannot have elf magic, it may harm you, master!"</em> Harry rubs against her again, sharing some of his own magic, before realizing that he initiated a bond with her. She floats in the wards with shock at the action.</p><p><em>"I do not find that unappealing. It will be fine."</em> Minky instantly quiets before Harry brings them both out of the ward's magic. Opening his eyes he sees that three elves are diagnosing him carefully.</p><p>"I am fine. Minky and I have been communicating with the wards." the elves sigh in relief as he notices that Minky is not being treated despite the tears running down her face. "Please bring Minky a Pain Relief Potion. She needs it after that headache I caused her." The elves quickly obey and Minky quickly drinks the potion.</p><p>"Thank you, Master Hadrian." She hiccups as she whimpers a little again.</p><p>"You are welcome. Someone pop her into a dark room to rest, she probably has a migraine from where the property's wards gave her the knowledge of all books and tomes in the ward's reach." The elves look stunned for a moment before a smaller elf quickly obeys, popping with the elf into a dark room in the dungeons if his senses are correct. A few moments later and the elf reappears with narrow eyes.</p><p>"Master also 'downloaded' the knowledge according to Minky." He raises an eyebrow at her in amusement.</p><p>"Thanks to my reincarnation I did not really feel any pain until I decided to take on some of her pain." The elf jerks her head back in shock at the news, along with the rest of the elves. "Even now I feel that I am fine, though you may cast diagnostics upon me if you wish." The elves all shake their heads at the offer.</p><p>"If you, Master, are willing to let us verify it than I am completely sure that you are honest with us." The other elves nod in agreement. Killua smiles at them appreciatively with a knowing look on his face.</p><p>"You have already detected the past life, didn't you?" the elves nod to him curtly.</p><p>"Correct, for the five minutes you were connected to the wards we were able to determine that you have a past life in your memories." Killua nods to them before stretching languidly.</p><p>"Thank you for being honest. Right now, we are going to start preparing for anything that might come at us. I doubt the dark lord is dead, I remember his spirit fleeing. Though he lodged a piece of his soul in me by accident. I'll simply have to detach it and place it in another object." The elves start in horror before nodding curtly. </p><p>By the time that he goes to Hogwarts he is going to be the First Technomancer.</p>
