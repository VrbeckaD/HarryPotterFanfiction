    <p>Ron Weasley was the youngest son of six in his family.  Ginny was the only one younger than him, but she was a girl so Ron didn’t really care about that.  It was obvious from the start their mother would dote on her excessively and she did. </p><p>Ginny got a new wand right from the start.  Ron didn’t get one until after he went a year with a broken wand.  Ginny got better dress robes for this year.  No one would say why they needed them, but the set he got was terrible and looked like a dress instead of dress robes.  He even first thought his mom accidentally left one of Ginny's dresses on his bed when he saw it. </p><p>Ginny also got better clothes in general, but then again despite the family’s claims of otherwise, they were trying to dress her up so she would catch the eye of someone with money.  Ginny still wanted that someone to be Harry Potter, even if she had been acting less fan girly about it.  Their mother and father just wanted her to catch the eye of anyone who could provide for her and wouldn’t treat her too terribly. </p><p>Speaking of Harry Potter…</p><p>That led Ron to his current annoyance.  Harry Bloody Potter.  He had been friends with Harry since they met before first year and yet the scar headed boy still was too annoying with his lot in life.  So, what if he lost his parents?  There were a lot of people who lost their parents, especially after the war against Voldemort.  Harry Bloody Potter was both famous and rich!  And yet he did nothing with it all! </p><p>Harry could have been the one to shut Malfoy up, but he didn’t.  Even Draco ‘My Father’ Malfoy couldn’t hold much weight if Harry freaking tried to actually use his fortune and fame.  Everyone knew the Potters were richer and more politically powerful than the Malfoys, but Harry just chose to be stupid and annoying and whine about his parents all the time. </p><p>He was The-Fucking-Boy-Who-Lived!  He had the wizarding world ripe for his taking, but no, he didn’t take it.  He could get with pretty much any of the girls he wanted as well, but he was too noble and cowardly for that.  Hell, Harry bowed down and cowered before those goddamn muggles that treated him so terribly! </p><p>No.  Harry didn’t deserve his fame or his money.  There wasn’t anything Ron could really do about those things, even if Harry was frustratingly annoying with them.  Ron wished he had just a little bit of that fame and money.  He could put it to good use, even if it was just to get Lavender to lift her robes and drop her knickers for him.  There was one thing he could try to do though.  It would really get at Harry too.  Ron didn’t know how exactly to accomplish it yet, but he intended to figure it out. </p><p>That was why he was currently looking through their family library, even if it was just a bookcase or two.  Ron looked over the titles of the different books, but there wasn’t anything that would work.  He did have that one book he recently received, but that was just for the first steps of his idea and nothing else.  He pulled out a couple of books from the bookcase in frustration until he came to one that seemed to be stuck. </p><p> “What the?” Ron asked out loud.  He then held it and tried pulling harder on it.  With a grunt of effort, it finally budged and sent Ron almost to the floor.  Ron blinked and looked at what he just did.  The book that was stuck seemed to now be at an awkward angle.  However, there was a series of clicks and Ron was glad he was home alone for the moment.  He wasn't sure what was happening, but he had a feeling it would be bad if someone else found out about it. </p><p>Soon the clicks stopped and there was a hiss sound before the whole bookcase swung open.  There was a small room that was clearly constructed with magic he had never seen before on the other side.  Ron entered and suddenly torches lit up around the room.  “What?!” he exclaimed to no one. </p><p>There was a hanging banner with the family’s Coat of Arms on it, but the colors were darker than the version Ron had seen.  They weren’t darker because of age or anything of the like either.  This banner was obviously enchanted to never age or fade.  The change was also too drastic to be simply explained by the fabric used for it. </p><p>Another change was the motto on the bottom of the banner.  Ron was always told they didn’t have one, but if they did it would be “Blood-Traitor and Proud of it!”  The banner in front of him however had a much different motto.  “Overwhelm and Overcome, even if by numbers alone”.  It seemed there might be more to why the Weasley family always had so many more children than the other pure-blood families by a good amount. </p><p>Under the banner, there was a dark brown leather-bound tome.  Ron’s eyes glistened as he looked it over.  Ron didn’t really hate reading, he just felt it was stupid to read unnecessarily.  However, an ancient family Grimoire?  That was worth a read or several.  It was even worth memorizing! </p><p>Ron’s eyes were greedy as he picked up the ancient tome.  He was grinning from ear to ear.  He looked around the room and realized this was all there was to it.  He then said to the banner and himself, “I think it’s time I got the Weasley Family back on track.  Overwhelm and Overcome, even if by numbers alone.” </p><p>With those words, he walked back out of the secret room and got himself some water before heading up to his room.  Hermione always nagged him about studying over summer instead of waiting until last minute.  Now that he had something worth studying, he would do just that. </p><p> [-] [-] [-] </p><p>Ron had spent several days looking over the Weasley Grimoire.  He was surprised by the magic inside it.  It seemed in the past the Weasley family weren’t really all on board with the whole “For the Light!” thing.  Ron always thought it a bit foolish really.  Why should they try to be the better wizard when their opponents aren’t and you had people like the Malfoys and the other Stinking Slytherins running around owning the place? </p><p>Ron never stepped too far out of line because they had Dumbledore on their side and even Bloody Dark Lord Voldemort didn’t dare cross the Headmaster.  However, Ron always felt they should do things differently.  Why have magic if you aren’t going to use it properly? </p><p>The youngest Weasley son did find it rather interesting just how much he had learned from the tome in these few days.  It was further proof to him most of the stuff you were taught at Hogwarts was rather basic and unnecessary.  He also studied the book called Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches.  The twins recently gave it to him as a joke. </p><p> “We were going to wait until you were older,” Fred started. </p><p> “But we figured it would take you at least two years to even understand the first chapter,” George continued. </p><p> “And we all know you could use all the help you can get,” Fred started again. </p><p> “Especially with a face like yours!” the twins chorused together before laughing and walking away. </p><p>Ron may have gotten the book as a joke, but it was useful and he would use it on his target for a particular ritual that caught his eye.  It was just what he needed to get at Harry for good.  Why should too noble and too cowardly Potter get the girl?  Ron had seen the way the two sneaked glances at each other last year.  It was as if Hermione hugging Harry after the Chamber changed something between them. </p><p>That also angered Ron.  If it wasn’t for him, they would have never solved the Chamber issue.  The only reason Lockhart didn’t obliviate them and leave them for dead, is because Ron’s broken wand backfired on him.  Why the hell should Harry be the one who got the big happy hug?  On top of that, she purposefully spurned him as well! </p><p>Yes.  Ron would use Hermione to get back at Harry.  Harry wouldn’t get the girl.  Ron Weasley would get the girl instead of Harry Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived.   Hermione would be showing up earlier than Harry by a few days, since Harry had to wait until after his birthday to arrive for the summer. </p><p>Ron would use what he learned from the book to get her more agreeable.  Then he would tell her there was something he wanted help with that they wouldn’t show the others yet.  Hermione would be a little worried at first, but if he dropped the hint it was special magic she couldn’t find in any books, she would agree in the end.  Dangle impressive magic and arcane knowledge in front of Hermione Granger, and it was pretty much hook, line, and sinker. </p><p> [-] [-] [-] </p><p>There was a knock on the door.  Ron quickly got up and answered it.  “Hello, Ron!” Hermione said before giving him a slight friend hug.  It was nothing like she gave Harry in second year, and her hugs for Harry were even more than that now. </p><p> “Hey, Hermione!  Good to see you again.  You look nice.  Have a good summer?” Ron said in greeting.  He missed the blush that quickly flitted across her cheeks at being told she looked nice. </p><p>She instead smiled, even if it was a bit strained, and said, “I have been busy.  Lots of homework and other things to study!  I may not be taking too many classes now, but I still have a heavy load of classwork.  Have you done any studying yet?  You mentioned you already did your shopping for the year.” </p><p>Ron was wondering about her strained smile.  He wondered if she was getting it ready to turn into a frown or a scowl when he told her his usual answer.  Ron didn’t know the actual truth though.  There was a reason Hermione so readily agreed to spending so much of the summer in the wizarding world this time, despite how she usually preferred to be with her parents for as long as possible. </p><p>The truth was Hermione’s summer was very lonely this year.  Her parents seemed even more distant than usual.  There was even more she couldn’t talk about to them that happened while at school.  It even felt at times her parents couldn’t stand being in the same room as her.  She had even made some discoveries about herself that she wanted to talk to them about, but she didn’t feel she could anymore.  This current feeling had nothing to do with her recent discoveries about herself though.  Coming to the Burrow, she already felt more at home because of the signs of magic everywhere in the house. </p><p>Ron gave her a bit of a confident grin that she hadn’t seen on him before as he said, “I actually have been doing some studying this year.  Though it isn’t all to do with school.” </p><p>Hermione looked to him with curious honey brown eyes in question. </p><p>Ron then leaned in and whispered, “I’ll tell you about it later, when we can be alone together.” </p><p>Hermione blushed a little as her heart beat a little faster at the closeness between them.  “Sounds interesting,” she replied in a voice slightly higher than her normal tone. </p><p> “Well.  I’m sure mum will have my head if I don’t quickly bring you to the kitchen so she can greet you,” Ron said with a roguish grin as he held the door for Hermione to enter. </p><p> “I do like coming to your house,” Hermione said as she looked around the place briefly.  “Harry arrives on the 31st right?” she asked.  She missed the flash of annoyance on Ron’s face, since he was behind her closing the door. </p><p> “Yep.  Can’t leave the Dursleys until after his birthday at midnight.  That’s how it always is.  You can be sure we won’t leave him there a moment longer than needed though,” Ron said as he put on his usual friendly face again and guided Hermione to the kitchen.  He hated how she hadn’t even been here more than a few minutes and was already yammering on about Harry Bloody Potter. </p><p>It didn’t matter though.  Before Harry arrived, it would at last be Ron’s turn to get everything.  Hermione would be the first thing Ron Weasley got and not Harry Potter.  He couldn’t wait until his plan came together. </p><p>It was his time now. </p>
