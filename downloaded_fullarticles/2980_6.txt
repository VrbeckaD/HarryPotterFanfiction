          <div class="userstuff"><p>Graves stroked Credence's hand removing the angry red marks that Mary Lou had left there. Placing the Deathly Hallows necklace on the boy.  "Once you find the child, I will be able to help you explore your magic", he said.  Credence was crying, he was scared and weak. He had never been cared for by anyone and he wanted to believe that that was what Graves was doing. But there was something inside him that told him that this was wrong.  If Graves truly cared about him, he would help him now instead of using for his means with the promise of being saved later.  He thought he was being saved from abuse but he was only being abused more.  He sobbed harder, shaking into Graves' shoulder.</p></div>
