    <p>Tony Dinozzo could not believe his luck. As dangerous as his job is, it had taken a car crash to bring him down. As minor as the accident was, his hand was completely mangled. The ER Doctor took one look at his left hand, and immediately called in a specialist.</p><p>"That hand is in bad shape. You're lucky one of the foermost Orthopaedic surgeons works through this hospital. Dr. Potter-Black specializes in hand injuries. If anyone can get you all fixed up, it's her. We'll get you an I.V. in, and some pain meds going. Dr. Potter-Black will be here shortly, just hold tight." He said, then left Tony alone.</p><p>Tony looked over to the side table, and grabbed his phone with his good hand. He called the one person he could always count on.</p><p>"Gibbs? There's been an accident."</p><p>Leroy Jethro Gibbs was not expecting that call. Usually, calls on his day off were him getting called in on a case. He definitely wasn't expecting Dinozzo. The tone of his voice was enough to make him take notice. The fact that he may lose some of the function in his hand was chilling.</p><p>Luckily, Gibbs was close to the Hospital, and he got there in ten minutes. One look at Tony's hand had him wincing. He was about to say something (and probably put his foot in his mouth) when there was a knock on the door, and in walked the Doctor. At least he thought it was the Doctor, although it could have been an Angel.</p><p>She was petite, maybe 5ft 3in without the three inch heels she was wearing. Apparently they had called her in from an event of some kind. She had long, platinum blonde hair that hung in loose curls. Pale skin, high cheekbones, and full lips. All of this, however, was eclipsed by her almond shaped, emerald green eyes. Looking into those eyes was like a punch to the gut to Gibbs. She was wearing a long, form fitting, navy blue sleeveless dress.</p><p>"Hello, Mr. Dinozzo. I'm Doctor Potter-Black. Doctor Miller gave me a brief description of your injury. Why don't you tell me what happened while I examine your hand?" Dr. Potter-Black said, her British accent cutting across the room.</p><p>As she was talking, she turned aroud to wash her hands, and Gibbs almost swallowed his tongue. The dress that was modest from the front was completely backless. The dark blue material was hugging her ass lovingly, and Gibbs had never wanted to be a piece of fabric more.</p><p>He was officially in trouble.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>If Gibbs was having trouble schooling his reaction to the beautiful Doctor, Tony wasn't even trying. His jaw was hanging open, eyes wide. It was only a matter of time before he said something stupid, inappropriate, or both. Case in point-</p><p>"Oh my God! You are so hot! Are you sure you are the surgeon? Can we play doctor either way?" Tony's nonsense finally broke Gibbs out of his stupor.</p><p>"Dinozzo! Show some respect!" Gibbs barked as he slapped Tony on the back of the head.</p><p>Doctor Potter-Black just raised an eyebrow at them, and stated; "I am going to pretend that is the narcotic talking. I assure you, I am completely qualified. Now, I can tell by the x-rays that you will need extensive surgery, and some metal pins to provide stability. You will require physical therapy, and depending on your occupation, approximately eight weeks off work..."</p><p>"What? I can't do that! I am an NCIS Agent, I can't just take two months off work!" Tony sputtered.</p><p>The Doctor put her hand up to cut him off. "Mr Dinozzo, I can't say for sure how long you will be off. I can say with certainty that you will be on desk duty at least. This is a very serious injury. You'll have to discuss that with your superiors. For now, we need to get you to the OR." She looked at Gibbs and asked "Are you a relative?"</p><p>"I'm his medical Power of Attorney, and a friend and colleague." He said, reaching his hand out to introduce himself. "Leroy Jethro Gibbs, it is a pleasure to meet you."</p><p>As she took his hand, the air seemed to become charged with tension. "Hyacinth Potter-Black. The pleasure is mine." She said. "Let's get you to the OR, Mr Dinozzo. Don't worry, everything will be just fine." She said, and with that she left the room, and the Nuses came in to get Tony. Leaving Gibbs to wonder what the Hell just happened.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>"What the Hell just happened?" Hyacinth muttered to herself as she changed into scrubbs. </p><p>One minute she was enjoying her birthday out to dinner with most of what was left of her family, then she got the call about a severe hand injury. This was not unusual. She had established herself as the go-to for complex orthopaedic surgery. She specialized in hand injuries, and received patients from the Tri-State Area.</p><p>Her life consisted soley of work, and her children. She knew it wasn't healthy, and that it worried the people close to her, but since the death of her husband she had poured everything she had into her twin boys. It was bad enough that they had never met their Father. They would never doubt their Mother's love for them, not while there was breath in her body.</p><p>Hyacinth had not felt even the smallest spark of attraction since Bill died. She was six months pregnant at the time. That was one of the darkest days of her life, and that was saying something.</p><p>Hadrian William Sirius Potter-Black and Harrison James Rigel Potter-Black were born two months later. They had been the only men in her life since then. It was disconcerting to be so instantly attracted to someone, after five years of nothing. Oh, people asked her out, a lot. But she had always turned them down. She had never even been tempted. But boy, was she tempted now!</p><p>There was something so sexy about Leroy Jethro Gibbs. The strong jaw, baby blue eyes, and intense expression. Dark blue jeans clinging to muscular thighs- "Woah, Hya. Down girl!" She thought to herself. She was disconcerted, but she had a surgery to get to. She could have a nervous breakdown later.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Six hours. Gibbs had been in the surgery waiting room for over six hours, drinking cup after cup of what he thought was supposed to be coffee. It was now after 1a.m. The Doctor had sent updates twice to let him know that Tony was stable. Gibbs was still worried, though. Six hours was surely a long time, right?</p><p>Gibbs was running his hands through his hair when Hyacinth walked in. Her name being hyphenated probably meant she was married, right? 'Focus Gibbs' He thought. Even in scrubbs, she was gorgeous. She looked tired, though.</p><p>"Hello, Mr Gibbs. Mr Dinozzo is doing well. His damage was extensive, and his hand is basically being held together by metal pins right now, but the nerve damage was minimal and I beieve he will make a full recovery if he follows my instructions, and the physical therapy. Do you have any questions?" She asked.</p><p>"What are the chances he has permanent damage?" Gibbs asked.</p><p>"About ten percent. That goes up to 30-35% if he doesn't do his therapy. I will stress this to him, but he may listen better to you. I have office hours tommorrow, so I'll be by to look him over just before lunch. He is in recovery now. Once he wakes up he'll spend an hour or so there, then he will be taken to his room."</p><p>Hyacinth looked down at the paper in her hands. "He is in room 409." She looked up again,  and a tendril of hair escaped her messy bun. He wanted to curl it around his finger, and see if it was as soft as it looked. She leaned forward, and put her hand over his. She smelled like lavender and jasmine, and he subconsciously leaned forward and breathed in her calming scent.</p><p>"Go home and rest, Mr Gibbs. There is nothing you can do from here, and your friend will be fine." Hyacinth said.</p><p>"Call me Jethro." Gibbs said, his intense gaze caught and held hers.</p><p>"Go home, Jethro. You can come back tommorrow." She let go of his hand, and turned to leave the room. Gibbs didn't know if he would get another chance, so he said "Is there a Mr Potter-Black?" right before she left the room. </p><p>She turned slowly, and looked at him searchingly for a moment. "Not anymore. He died five years ago. Why do you ask?"</p><p>Gibbs was shocked. She was a Widow too? "I am sorry for your loss. I lost my first wife, as well. It's just... I am very attracted to you. Would you like to go out to dinner sometime?" He aaked in a rush. He had never felt so much like a teenager aaking a girl out for the first time, not even with Shannon!</p><p>Hyacinth was surprised, and a bit unsure. She knew it was time to move on, but it was hard! "Um, I actually haven't dated since he died. I'm probably terribly out of practice." She said, then bit her lip. "Maybe we could start with lunch, or coffee?" She asked, uncertainly.</p><p>Gibbs let out a breath he had been holding, and gave her a half smile. "Lunch sounds great. Can I have your number?" He asked. Gibbs couldn't believe how ridiculous he was being! However, he could hardly believe she said yes. She was beautiful, intelligent, and successful. She was also sexy as Hell.</p><p>"I'll probably be here around lunch to visit Tony. Would you like to get something quick tommorrow?" He asked, slyly.</p><p>"I would only have an hour, is that alright?" She asked, then bit her lip again. That right there was distracting, Gibbs thought.</p><p>"That sounds fine. I guess I'll see you then?"</p><p>"See you then." She said, giving him a shy smile.</p><p>'Yep, I was right.' Gibbs thought. 'I'm in trouble.'</p>
