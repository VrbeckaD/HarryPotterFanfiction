Possessing the ability called The Gamer, he experiences life in a game like setting which was derived from his gaming addiction. Jihan had developed his from that but Harry’s had appeared when he was eight. When he had first been hurt so badly by his uncle that he had nearly died. It was also when Jihan got the alert he had an apprentice appear. Jihan called him Little Brother so that no one would know that there were two ‘The Gamers’ now. Harry was fine with it and they soon learned they could send messages to each other via their ability instead of a computer after about a year. Jihan at 27 now gets a message that Harry needs him in England. The quest of a lifetime. Taking care of his Little brother.</span>
