    <p>Remus Lupin was sitting in his living room late at night because he couldn’t sleep for some reason. His boyfriend Sirius Black was sound asleep in bed and had been for most of the night since they had gotten back from James and Lily Potters house celebrating Halloween with their god son. He looked at a piece of paper that James had given him. And made sure he took home with, with specific instructions to take it to Gringotts if something was to happen to him and Lily.</p><p>Remus and Sirius knew things where bad. Voldermort had this crazy idea that Harry was going to kill him because seer saw it and had told someone. Severus Snape, the little bat had run to his master and told him when he heard it. Voldermort blamed Harry and now wanted the blood of his god son.</p><p>Now James, Lily and Harry where hiding out under a charm, only their friend Peter Pettigrew knew where it was located. Lily put a charm on the paper to make it glow and make a sound if something had happened to them, it was a smart idea. Sirius and Remus always made sure to keep the paper within earshot, always fearing the worst.</p><p>James made sure Sirius swore on a wizard’s oath not to do anything stupid should something happen. James knew that if something where to happen that Sirius would do something stupid and get himself in trouble.</p><p>Remus grabbed the papers and walked up to the bedroom where his boyfriend was sleeping. He set the papers on the dresser, as he did Lily’s scream filled the room, “SOMETHING’S HAPPENED, GET HERE NOW!”</p><p>Sirius jumped up when he heard Lily’s scream, he grabbed his wand and threw on his rode. Remus grabbed his wrist stepping in front of him, “we don’t know what we will find.” He took a shaky breath “remember your oath. If the worst has happened, we grab Harry and come home.”</p><p>Sirius nodded his head, “the oath won’t let me do anything rash, now let’s go.”</p><p>Together the apparated to the field outside of James and Lily’s house. Walking up to the house they saw the door blasted open. They drew their wands and ran inside to find James lying on the floor battered. Sirius rushed over checking for a pulse, “Damn it!” He groaned when he didn’t find one.</p><p>Remus rushed to the stairs “do you want to wait here while I find Lily and Harry, he asked his voice cracking. Sirius jumped up “Harry!” at that moment a baby’s cries echoed through the house. Both men rushed up the stairs following the cries wands at the ready.</p><p>They got to Harry’s room and opened the door and discovered Lily laying on the floor against Harry’s crib and Voldermort sprawled crossed the floor eyes grazed over with death. They knew without a checking for a pulse that she was dead. Their hearts broke, and both wanted to cry but they had more important things to worry about right now.</p><p>Sirius walked over to the crib and saw his god son crying. He picked Harry up and walked back to Remus ricking the baby trying to get him to calm down. They both walked back downstairs, out of the house into the cold autumn air.</p><p>Once they were outside they were greeted by a familiar voice, “Good evening gentlemen, chilly night tonight.” They looked up and were greeted by a smiling Albus Dumbledore. He smiled at them but both men knew not to trust that smile. He walked up the them and held out his hands “now boys give e Harry, I saw the inside. Voldermort may be dead but his followers will still peruse Harry for revenge. They will suspect a wizard family first, he would be safest with his aunt Petunia” Dumbledore said smiling.</p><p>Remus growled “look Albus I respect you but I will not allow you to take Harry to a home where the people will hurt him physically and mentally because mark my words Petunia and her husband will” he said with conviction.</p><p>Sirius nodded his head shifting Harry to a more comfortable position, “James and Lily wouldn’t want that. And as his god father I won’t allow it to happen,” He glared at the old man. “they made it obvious they wanted their son with us, so we will take the boy home with us tonight, we have a copy of their will and it will determine everything,” he finished as he took Remus’s hand in his as he apparated them home.</p><p>Once home Sirius took a sleeping Harry to a bassinet they had bought in case of emergency. Remus followed him looking over his shoulder putting his hands around his waist, “life is about to change drastically for us.”</p><p>Sirius chuckled “that is an understatement love.” He let a sigh, “no point trying to sleep, why don’t you go shower, I’ll start collecting things we need for the will reading tomorrow” he spoke his voice shaky and crackly.</p><p>Remus nodded and stepped back pulling Sirius around to face him, “look at me” he puts his hand on his boyfriends checked raising his bloodshot eyes to him, “you don’t have to be a black around me it’s okay.” His own eyes were on the verge of streaming tears, “we will get through this.”</p><p>Sirius placed his hand on Remus’s, “together we will, all three of us.”</p><p>Remus gave Sirius a tender kiss, “I’m going to shower, and then try to catch a few hours of sleep.” He gave a halfhearted smile and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Sirius turned looking down at his god son, “I swear I’ll protect you.” A tear fell down his cheek as he headed from the bedroom casting a charm, so he could head everything around Harry.</p><p>As he closed the door le leaned against it, he heard the shower running and knew he would be alone for a while, so he sat in front of the door and everything rushed back to him. The site of the door blown in. His friend the loved like a brother sprawled out on the floor. The gut wrenching feeling he had when he couldn’t find a pulse. The weight of it all broke through to him and he let it all out.</p><p>Tears poured as he sobbed remembering the sight of Lilly sprawled on the floor. “Forgive me my friends, I shouldn’t have trusted Peter,” he sobbed into his hands. As he shed his tears he felt something fall into his lap.</p><p>Looking down he saw a paper there all he saw was James name and he jumped up tears still rolling down his face. “Sirius,” Remus said his voice full of concern at his boyfriend’s tears as he noticed the shimmering paper. “A letter from James,” he asked walking over to comfort his lover.</p><p>Sirius nods, unable to find words as Remus takes the letter guiding him to the bed where Remus laid down and pulled Sirius down with him, laying him on his chest as he rubbed his hand though his hair, “do you want to read it now or later.”</p><p>“Now,” Sirius’s voice came out choked and cracked but also firm in resolve.</p><p>

  <em>Remus &amp; Sirius</em>

  <em>If your reading this then that means that Peter betrayed us, and we have been killed. Please don’t blame yourself Sirius. We know you will think it was your fault, that if you hadn’t said to miniated Peter then we would still be alive, and Remus if you had only tried harder to kill the man yourself then we could have come out of hiding, but neither of you are at fault. WE died protecting the one thing that means more to us then our lives. Your lives are about to change now, you will have a baby on your hands. We know you are probably wondering why you. Well besides the obvious reasons of being his god fathers, you both will love him with all you have and will teach him to be a strong kind man. You will teach him everything we wanted to teach him, you will, you can tell him stories of our times together and show him the love he deserves. We might not be with you in the flesh, but we are with you all in spirit and in everything you guys do. Now, you will find a folder on your dresser, Lily charmed it to appear if we die. In it are documents you will need to take to Gringotts as soon as possible. The first paper is our will, no one can read it but Gurlok, the Potter manager at Gringotts. The second is Harry’s Heritage Sheet. The third and fourth are letters to Harry, give them to him when he is older. You might want to be in the room Lily’s is kind of sappy. Before I end this note I want you both to know that me and Lily love to both as our own family.</em>

  <em>                                         With all our love, even in death</em>
</p><p>
  <em>                                                     James and Lily</em>
</p><p>Silence filled the room. Remus laid the letter on the nightstand with silent tears rolling down his face, as he flicked his wand and the bassinet holding harry floated to the foot of the bed. He laid his wand down and turned the lamp off letting the moonlight fill the room.</p><p> He tightens his grip on Sirius the only tell his crying being the wet spot on Remus’s stomach. He ran his hand through his boyfriend’s hair as both men just dried themselves to sleep, to full of grief to speak.</p><p>The next day Remus got up and walked over to his god son’s bassinet and saw he was up, he picked up Harry and carried him downstairs and into the kitchen. Remus sat him down on the highchair while he made breakfast for them.</p><p>Sirius woke up to the smell of pancakes and slowly got out of bed, he looked over at the bassinet finding it empty he freaked out for a second but heard a giggle downstairs and knew where Harry was.</p><p>Walking downstairs he saw his boyfriend putting some cut up pancakes in a plate onto Harry’s highchair. He sat down and they started to eat and decided after they ate and got ready they would go to Gringotts and get the paperwork out of the way and then go shopping.</p><p>Remus looked at his boyfriend “I sent a letter to Gringotts stating that we would be for the reading of James Potters will” He told his boyfriend. Sirius nodded his head as he had a mouth full of food. Remus continued “I told them that James left the will in a stack of papers that no one can open but the Potter Manager, and we would be in soon” he said.</p><p>Sirius said ok and got up and told him he would give Harry a bath while Remus cleaned up the kitchen. Remus laughed and then groaned looking at the mess but started to clean anyways, after the kitchen was clean he went upstairs to get dressed himself.</p><p>Once they all were dressed they floo’ed to the Leaky Cauldron and went into Diagon Ally, they went straight to the bank. Once they were in Gringotts they asked for Gurlok the Potter Manager. </p><p>They were shown into a room and waited for the goblin to enter the room, 5 minutes later a goblin entered the room and introduced himself “hello my name is Gurlok I am the Potter Manager what can I do for you” he asked the men.</p><p>Remus pulled out the will and passed it to Gurlok “this is the will of James and Lily Potter who died last night at the hands of Voldermort” He said sadly. Gurlok took the paper and once he did the paper unrolled itself and you heard a light and paper appeared. He knew this will was to be a real one because that was the spell goblins used when someone came for a will made from them.</p><p>Gurlok was surprised at first because not many people got goblin made wills mostly because whatever was written in that will was iron clad as the muggles like to call it. Also, it was made by blood magic and because of that nothing in this could be made false.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">
  <em>First, I want everyone to know that if this will be being read when Harry is a baby it means that Voldermort killed us. If that happened I need to say that Peter Pettigrew was our secret keeper not Sirius Black. We switched because we thought it would be safer. Now to the part of who gets the stuff…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>To Remus Lupin I leave all the book in the Potter estate I know how much you loved the books when you visited mate. I also leave 1,000,000 Gillions, I know you’re going to complain but I’m dead what am I going to do with all my money. Lastly, I want to thank you for being one of my best friends.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>To Peter Pettigrew I leave Nothing but time in Azkaban, I hope you rot in hell for betraying your friends like you did. I gave you my friendship, Hell I even gave you a place to stay when your mom kicked you out and this is how you repay me.</em>

</p><p align="center">
  <em>Finally, last order of business before this will is done who gets Harry James Potter. Lily and I sat down and though about it, she wants me to say it took forever for us to come to a decision. Really there was only one to make the most obvious one to make. We leave our son to Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, they are his God Fathers after all but not only because of that but because they love him and will teach him how to a wonderful man. </em>
</p><p align="center">

  <em>James Emmerson Potter</em>
</p><p>Gurlok took out the second paper and slid it across from Remus and Sirius “this is the paper each of you will sign, it will make both of you the magical guardians of Harry James Potter” He told both men.</p><p>Remus looked at the paper “what about in the nuggle world, and there isn’t a way for anyone to try and take him away from us right” he asked the goblin?</p><p>“No when you sign these papers Harry will be both of your responsibilities, now if you both where to get married and wanted to adopt him by blood then we would do that here” he told both men.</p><p>Remus and Sirius looked at each other and took the paper and quill and signed it, a bright light shinned from the paper for a minute and then disappeared. Gurlok smiled “congratulations on becoming the guardians of Harry James Potter” he told both men as he took the paper and put it with the folder of the will.</p><p>Sirius looked at the goblin “what about the information about the secret keeper what will happen to that” he asked. Gurlok told them he would personally give it to the authorities and make sure it was dealt with.</p><p>Remus remembered about Harry’s heritage sheet “Gurlok what about the other piece of paper in the folder” he asked the goblin?</p><p>Gurlok looked at the two men “I feel that we should wait to go over it when you both decide if you want to adopt him” the tiny goblin said.</p><p>“Why is that” Sirius asked, Gurlok looked at the two men “because if you choose to blood adopt him then your heritage will add to his”.</p><p>Both men smiled and agreed to wait and told him they would have an answer by the end of the month about the adoption.</p><p>After making sure that the only people who could deal with the Potter vaults were Remus and Sirius and Harry when he came of age.</p><p>After stepping out of Gringots they decided to take Harry into the muggle world to get the supply’s they would need for him. It would be safer for Harry when they went out with him right now, Remus could get the magical things they would need.</p><p>They spent a couple of hours inside the store getting a crib, dresser, baby changing table, some toys, and most of all clothes. Once the little family was done getting everything they took it outside and in an ally Sirius shrunk it all down and appropriated them home.</p><p>Upon arriving home Sirius took the shrunken shopping bags up to Harry’s room, while Remus and Harry followed quietly. Sirius was taking out the crib and putting it together, once everything was put together and in its place, they stood back and admired the room.</p><p>Remus looked at the quiet boy in his arms and saw that Harry was fast asleep, he smiled and put Harry down for a nap. Both men walked out of the room and Sirius put up a spell to let them know when Harry woke up, and walked downstairs to put the other things they got that day away.</p><p>An hour later while Remus was making dinner the alarm sounded, and Sirius went to go get Harry, While Remus finished dinner and put the plates of food on the table, he put Harry’s baby plate on his seat.</p><p>Once they both came downstairs and Sirius sat Harry down they got to eating, laughing at Harry eating his own food. With dinner done Remus gave Harry a bath and put him in his pajama’s, and brought him into the living room to play with some of the new toys.</p><p>Later that night when Harry had tired himself out playing with his stuffed toy lion that Sirius had charmed to walk around and roar whenever Harry moved. Harry tired himself out walking around everywhere.</p><p>Sirius picked up a sleepy Harry and walked to the little boy’s room slowly, upon arriving he put Harry in bed and covered him up and leaned down and kissed his forehead. Remus leaned down and did the same.</p><p>Both men shut the door quietly and Remus put the charm to let them know if Harry woke up before going into their bedroom to get ready for bed.</p><p>Both men knew life would be hard but for Harry they would make sure he had a life full of love and laughter.</p><p align="center">
