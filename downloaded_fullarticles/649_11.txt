    <h3>Vanquished</h3><p><em>Harry’s stomach gave a jolt; the Threstral’s head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last… he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body… presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had.</em> (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, ‘The Department of Mysteries’)</p><p>As Harry slid off the Threstral’s back and found his feet again, he looked about himself, wondering where his friends had ended up. Just a little further, he caught sight of another Threstral walking its flight off.</p><p>“Ron?” he called out. “Hermione?”</p><p>Worried now, Harry gave a single pat of gratitude on his Threstral’s back and walked a bit further from the telephone box that served as an entrance to the Ministry of Magic.</p><p>From the corner of his left eye, he found another two Threstals sniffing each other out.</p><p>“Ginny?” he tried then. “Neville? Luna?”</p><p>Nobody replied.</p><p>The terror he’d felt at the thought of Sirius dying shifted then to a new startling realization. ‘Where are my friends?’ he thought. ‘Did they fall off? I thought I heard a shriek. I definitely heard a shriek then.’ Wariness entered him, casting the street around him in a darker, grimmer light. ‘They can’t all have fallen off their Threstral.’</p><p>Now that he was the only human left, the Threstrals seemed to gravitate towards him. ‘We only took six,’ he thought, counting the animals surrounding him now. There were more than fifty Threstrals looking at him now, as if he were their master. Harry shivered. ‘So the entire flock followed us,’ he concluded, a horrific suggestion entering his thoughts. ‘Did they eat them? They did, didn’t they?’</p><p>Unnerved, uncertain, haunted by what might already have happened, Harry hurried over to the telephone booth. Shakily he started pushing the right combination. <em>Six two four four two.</em></p><p>“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic,” a cool female voice said. “Please state your name and business.”</p><p>“H-harry Potter,” he replied. “I think my friends are dead!”</p><p>‘Thank you,’ the voice said. ‘Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robe.’</p><p>A badge flopped out of the coin receptable of the telephone. Numbly, Harry glanced at what was written on it. ‘Harry Potter, concerned citizen’ it read.</p><p>“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.”</p><p>Harry didn’t reply. The booth nevertheless descended.</p><p>‘They can’t be dead,’ Harry tried to cheer himself up. ‘Ron at least would have screamed if something invisible would start to bite. Ginny! Ginny would have hexed, I’m sure.’ Neville would have only whimpered in fright. Hermione… Harry couldn’t tell. Would she scream, curse or freeze up? Or started punching. He remembered third year and Malfoy’s black eye.</p><p>Still, he’d only heard a very brief shriek there, right into their descent.</p><p>The booth’s door suddenly opened, while in what felt like the distance, that voice said: “The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening.”</p><p>Harry stepped into the Atrium, feeling a sudden wave of loneliness overcome him. ‘I want my friends back.’</p><p>He didn’t know whether it was because it was nighttime or because Voldemort had made <em>arrangements</em>, but the only sound that could be heard in the large space was the water splashing into the fountain.</p><p>Seeing the golden centaur brought him back to the confrontation with Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest. He sniggered at the memory of Grawp saying “Hermy”, but quickly shut up when he remembered that Hermione was no longer there.</p>
