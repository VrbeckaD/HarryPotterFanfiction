  <em>Dear Head Auror H.J. Potter,</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Department of Magical Law Enforcement,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>We would like to offer congratulations for your excellency in the Mystical and Missing Creatures case. The professionalism you showed was phenomenal, and we hope that you could spare a bit of compassion and handle this case with discretion, at least until the perpetrators have been properly processed. We unfortunately have to ask that you extend this kindness to a few other cases as well. Dealings with those in such high positions of power only leave us open to attacks, and in this political climate this is something we cannot afford. I’m sure you understand and I can personally assure you that your silence will pay off.</em>

  <em>Undersecretary Mickey Wallis,</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Ministry of Magic Head Office</em>
</p>
<p>Harry sighed, glaring at the letter for a second before incinerating it. The ashes fluttered to his desk and he stared blankly at the letter he had just begun writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Daniel - </em>
  <br/>
  <em> I have so much to tell you when I get home. I’ll be home early so we can finally go to dinner with your parents. I promise I’ll dress nicely </em>
</p>
<p>Harry sighed once again, balling the letter up and grabbing another sheet of parchment. He shook his head as another memo flew into his office, hoping that it wasn’t another case. But he could already see the bold print at the top of the paper, signifying that not only was it another case, but that he would not be coming home tonight.</p>
<p>
  <em>Daniel - </em>
  <br/>
  <em> I won’t make it home again tonight. I can’t talk about it now, but I promise that I will. Soon enough. Don’t wait up for me. Love you.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry</em>
</p>
<p>Harry sadly tied up his letter to Cecil, who hooted disapprovingly at him.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me like that, you know I can’t help it.” Cecil hooted again before taking off. Harry watched him fly off for a bit before turning back to the memo on his desk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <strong>URGENT: MUGGLE INVOLVEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Harry’s eyebrows raised and he reluctantly had to admit his interest was piqued. He’d dealt with plenty of urgent cases, and plenty of Muggles, but never both at once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>MUGGLE FOUND DEAD NEAR THE LEAKY CAULDRON, WIZARD INVOLVEMENT SUSPECTED<br/>Amy St. James, Muggle, was found dead feet away from local pub The Leaky Cauldron. <br/>Suspect(s): Draco Malfoy, wizard<br/>Witness(es): Theodore Nott, wizard; Mandy St. James, Muggle</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Harry shot up from his seat, reading the page twice, three times, before it disappeared in a mushroom cloud of smoke. Coughing, Harry quickly gathered his things and was prepared to apparate to the coordinates when a fire suddenly roared to life at his floo. Daniel, his boyfriend of two years, appeared in the flames before stepping out into Harry’s office.</p>
<p>“Harry, thank goodness!” Daniel dusted off his robes before striding over to Harry and gathering him up in his arms. “I thought I might miss you!” Daniel brushed his cheek with a kiss before stepping around him to sit on the little couch Harry had in his office. “Alright then,” Daniel said, patting the seat next to him. “ Explain to me why you have to cancel on my parents for the twentieth time.”</p>
<p>“This can’t be-”</p>
<p>“It is.” Daniel pointed to the spot next to him. “Sit.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Harry began, sitting. “That’s the thing. I can’t tell you.” Harry’s stomach twisted when he saw how Dan’s shoulders drooped. Dan’s bright brown eyes seemed to dim a little at his words, and Harry wished he could say something to soften the blow, but there simply wasn’t anything he could do. “Dan, please don’t be angry-”</p>
<p>“Why the hell shouldn’t I be?” Dan flung himself up, eyes blazing. “We’ve been dating for two years, and you still haven’t met my parents.”</p>
<p>“Dan-”</p>
<p>“We haven’t been on an actual date for months, and anytime we do, you’re always thinking about work!” Dan began to pace about his office, and his shoulders shook as he spoke, betraying his emotions.</p>
<p>“Dan please--”</p>
<p>“No, Harry! I’ve tried not to let your job get in the way of us, but it’s hard when it’s all you seem to care about!</p>
<p>“It’s not all I care about!” Harry shook his head, rising and moving to his desk. “I told you that this job would be difficult, and <em>you</em> told me you could handle it!”</p>
<p>“I thought I could because I thought <em>you</em> could leave it for a few seconds! Obviously I was wrong!” Dan marched over to the fireplace, grabbing a handful of floo powder. Harry made to go after him, but his robes caught on one of the handles of his desk.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Harry,” Dan looked back, and all the flame in his eyes was washed out, leaving behind something cold and empty. “Don’t follow me. I’ll be gone by tomorrow.” With that Dan was gone. Harry felt a part of himself go with Dan. He couldn’t figure out if he was angrier with his job or with himself.</p>
<p>He and Dan had been on shaky ground for a while, but Harry had hoped that when he got a break in cases, they could mend it. But he’d never gotten a break. First it was working to prove himself, then to being Head Auror, and somewhere along the way he’d completely forgotten that Dan needed him, and he’d gotten used coming in after he was asleep and waking when Dan had already left. Now he looked back and couldn’t believe how stupid he’d been. He knew how bad it was getting, he should’ve made time. He couldn’t possibly expect their relationship to survive like that. But he did. And he regretted it so much.</p>
<p>Another memo flew into his office then, reminding him of what he’d been doing before Dan showed up. Harry shook his head, straightened his shoulders, and promptly Apparated. He’d deal with how he felt later. For now, a muggle girl needed him.</p>
