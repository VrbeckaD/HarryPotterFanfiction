    <p>Hermione was looking through the titles of the books perched upon the shelves within the newly-opened Central Library of the Wizarding World. Her fingers delicately brushing across the leather-bound spines, and inhaling the rich and intoxicating scent of new books and the musty waft of old tomes.</p><p>The place was now home to a myriad of books that had been acquired from all across the world, including but not limited to all the subjects that had been tackled in Hogwarts, and even included books about Dark Arts practices.</p><p>The library was the only good thing that Tom Riddle had come up with since he had taken his position as Minister for Magic. Apart from finding a reason for kicking out Albus Dumbledore from Hogwarts and even from the Wizengamot, the Minister had started using his pureblood connections to push forth the Muggle-born Registration Commission.</p><p>At the moment, Ministry employees with muggle descent were being interrogated one by one, and it wouldn't be too long that commission would progress and encompass most of the muggleborns in all Great Britain, and even those who are still attending school, like her. Such law could marginalize most of the muggleborns in the Wizarding society, but that probably was Minister Riddle's plan all along.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted when she heard voices in the distance.</p><p>"I planned to have that particular wing expanded this week."</p><p><em>That's the Minister's voice! </em>She thought, panicking and she immediately hid behind the book cases.</p><p>"The builders will be working in a few days to accommodate the books that will be arriving from Egypt this month."</p><p>Hermione peered through the book cases and her movement must have caught the attention of the Minster because she saw him glanced in her direction. At once, she ran and hid herself in another section of the library.</p><p>"Excuse me, for a second, ladies, gentleman. Percy, do you mind showing them the new wing that was just opened last week?"</p><p>"Of course, sir."</p><p><em>Damn! Damn! Damn! </em>Hermione inwardly cursed as she stood there frozen on the spot.</p><p>She knew at once where the Minister was headed since she could hear him coming her way.</p><p>"What are you looking for in this section of the library?"</p><p>She heard him call out and knew that she was too late to avoid him.</p><p><em>Shouldn't a librarian be asking that question? And not you, Minister? </em>She wanted to say but instead Hermione whirled around and said, pretending to be surprise to see him.</p><p>"Oh, good afternoon…Minister Riddle! I didn't see you there! I'm so sorry. I must have been engrossed in -"</p><p>"You didn't answer my question." Tom Riddle cut in, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>Hermione resisted the urge to squirm beneath his penetrating stare.</p><p>"I was ordered by the...err… Head of my Department to look for - for something… umm…interesting to write about..on an article..," Hermione responded, it was a rather lame excuse, but she couldn't think of anything else when she had those dark blue eyes drilling into her.</p><p>"In the Adult Section?"</p><p>"Yes, yes…" Hermione nodded her head vigorously, until she realized what he said. "Wait, WHAT?!"</p><p>"You just ventured into the Adult Section, or didn't you read the sign?"</p><p>Hermione looked up and saw that he was right. She flushed scarlet in embarrassment.</p><p>She noticed the Minister was frowning now.</p><p>"I did, and yes, I'm looking for a book that talks about – about …ugh, err…"Herrmione floundered, her eyes trying to find a book that would help her cover story.</p><p>"Dark Erotica…" she finished lamely, her cheeks flaming.</p><p>"Really?" Minister Riddle asked. "Who do you work for, Ms…."</p><p>"Luna Delacroix." She said immediately, "And I work in Witch Weekly, you see…and recently most of my loyal readers have been clamoring for some articles about Dark Erotica."</p><p>"So, you are here to do your research?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The Minister stared at her hard, like he was trying to read her mind. Almost at once, Hermione raise up her mental barriers and forcing herself to calm down.</p><p><em>He can't find out that I'm lying and have stolen identification from a Ministry woman! </em>Hermione thought frantically as she mentally strengthened her mental shields for fear of discovery. <em>The Minister can't find out that I'm still underage to be even browsing through this section of the library! He can't! I don't want to get expelled from Hogwarts!</em></p><p>Thinking fast, Hermione scanned for something to distract the Minister and her eyes landed on a green lacquered book in front of her. She hastily raised her hand to picked it up, and was surprised to hear the Minister shout.</p><p>"No, don't open that book!" The Minister yelled hurriedly.</p><p>Hermione didn't open the book though, instead she dropped it out of surprise and the book opened on its own.</p><p>And it was too late.</p><p>A dark void appeared from the book and Hermione found herself being sucked in. She saw the Minister tried to escape. And Hermione, who was trying to find purchase to help herself out of her predicament, caught the Minister's robes instead and inevitably the Minister and her were dragged along into the void and straight into their living nightmare.</p>
