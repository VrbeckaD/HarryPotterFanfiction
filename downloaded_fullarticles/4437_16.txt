    <p>Hermione was sitting under a tree thinking about what had happened an hour ago. She had been told by her parents that they were indeed Pure-bloods in hiding. They were afraid that if it got out that they were still alive, she would get killed. Not only did both of her parents go to Hogwarts, but they were also both in Slytherin. Hermione Jean Granger was really Hermione Jean Zabini. She let a tear fall down her cheek and played with a strain of grass.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>An Hour Ago</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She opened the door to her parent's room, tired of arguing with them. She saw them looking in a box with papers, pictures, and other things that reminded her of her magical world. She was unsure what to think of it and shook her head. She cleared her throat to get their attention. "Mum, Dad I wanted to tell you something" She started to say.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her parents turned around and noticed she was in their room and saw the box. Her father looked worried and tried to hide it. "Hermione dear, what did you need?" Her mother said quickly helping push it under the bed with her foot.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She looked up at her mother confused "Nothing important…I...I mean I was just coming to tell you something. I wanted to say sorry." She watched their faces "What are you hiding in that box anyway? You can't think I didn't see it when I came in" She noticed her parent's faces go from shock to being nervous.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I don't know what you mean sweetie," Her father said walking over to her "that was just an old shoe box, your mother and I keep pictures in it" He looked at his daughter hoping she believed his lie.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She walked into the room and pulled the box out from under the bed "so you don't mind if I look at it then, right? Since it is only old family photos?" She said lifting the box lid slowly.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her father took the box out of her hands before she was able to look inside. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I don't think you want to look in here sweetie, it's just a bunch of mine and your father's old memories" Her mother sighed worried, knowing her daughter was smart and knew they were hiding something. "This box is very precious to us dear- it contains our past and our future. I know you, and you will be angry with us, but we had to do what we did to survive in our world."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her father handed her the box and patted on the bed, "Come sit down Sweetpea; you have a right to know about us…and I guess it's time you learned the truth about your mother and me" He stood up and took his wife's hand.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Now please don't hate us. Yes we regret a lot in our past, but we did what was best for you baby," Her mother said looking upset "We love you very much" She kissed her forehead and walked out of the room, leaving Hermione alone.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione looked at the box and frowned "What are you hiding from me..." She said to herself before opening it up with shaky hands. She looked in the box and slowly pulled everything out; little did she know her curiosity would make her life change.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She looked at a picture of her parents; they were maybe 16 at the time. She smiled a little before noticing that this photo was taken with a wizard camera. She looked at it closer and gasped almost dropping it; they were wearing Slytherin robes and laughing. She looked next to them and saw Professor Snape and Lily Potter talking in the corner. She was shocked, to say the least, but had to keep looking. She found two wands and a box of Bertie Botts every flavour beans; under that was a letter from Professor Dumbledore telling her parents that he would watch out for her safety while at Hogwarts.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She couldn't look anymore, she started to cry a little and found a picture of her and her parents. She must have been at least five years old and laughing from being tickled by her father. She smiled at the image even though she had tears running down her face. She came across another picture of her and a blond haired little boy chasing each other around a big garden. She was sticking her tongue out at him and grinning before having him chase her. She sighed and carefully pulled out one last photo before dropping it in her lap in fear; it was her parents and Tom Riddle Jr sitting in the three broomsticks talking and laughing. Her mother looked pregnant, and her father had a tattoo on his arm he was showing to Tom.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione got scared and put the picture away before finding one last thing; it was her birth certificate. She looked at it and started to cry again "No…this must be a mistake" She reread it and put her head in her hands. "I thought I knew them," She said before hearing the door open.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Sweetie, lunch is ready…if you're hungry" Her mother said quietly before walking over to her. She saw the birth certificate in her hands and sighed "You know we wanted to tell you sooner…We just were afraid if anyone found out that you would be hurt…" She hugged her and looked at her hands reading the certificate herself and smiling.</em>

  <em>Hermione looked at her mother and sighed, "My whole life has been a lie." She stood up slowly. "You know I have been bulled the last six years for being a Muggleborn by my "Brother's best friend." She felt a tear roll down her cheek, "Why is this happening to me now?" Hermione said as she walked into the kitchen ignoring her parents. She sat down at the table and put her head in her hands; she watched as her parents sat on either side of her.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Sweetie you have to believe we wanted to tell you the truth. We were just afraid for you." Her mother said sincerely, "Look how your brother turned out…" Hermione shook her head before her mother continued, "I know we told you that you were an only child, but if you would have known the truth…we were afraid you would get hurt."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She looked at her parents and squeezed their hands, "I am upset that you kept this from me, but I do love you." She looked at her plate and pushed her food around. "So Blaise is my brother, yet he treats me the same as the other Slytherins do." Hermione's hands were still shaking a little bit but tried to keep calm. "Why can't I remember anything, I looked at the pictures, and I just don't remember." </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione looked at them and sighed sadly "I am leaving early for the Burrow this summer. This is too much to take right now" She sat there a few more minutes before standing up, "But I want to know if there is anything else you need to tell me."</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <strong>Back to Present</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>She took out a piece of parchment she had with her and started to write to her friends; she just hoped that they would understand and not be mad at her.</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry and Ron,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Today I found out the most terrible news. My parents have lied to me, and I figure they put me under a memory spell since I don't remember anything. I am actually related to Blaise Zabini. He and I are twins…I know he has treated me like everyone else has; so I am confused about it all still. I am making them lift the charm off of me so I can hopefully remember my past and this blond kid I used to hang out with apparently. I understand if you are mad at me, I hope I can see you on the train at least. I miss you guys. I will keep you updated on what I know and find out.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Please owl back,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione rolled up her letter and called for her owl, "Take this to Harry and Ron please." She gave him a treat and watched him fly off.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Camilla watched her daughter walk outside and sighed "Honey, I think she hates us now" She held back tears "Maybe we should lift the charm and let her remember the truth." Liam nodded his head in agreement and squeezed her hand.</p>
<p>They walked outside as they saw her owl fly off. "Sweetie, we want you to know why we did it. We know you figured out you have a memory charm on you. We want you to know the truth, can we lift the charm?"</p>
<p>Hermione nodded and closed her eyes as her father reversed the spell. She kept her eyes shut and felt her memories coming swarming back, she wanted to cry but at the same time felt comforted. She suddenly felt whole, like a part of her had always been missing. Hermione felt happy and imagined herself having a brother.</p>
<p>Then one memory after another came back to her, she felt moody and tried to bring up each memory slowly. Hermione remembered crawling into her parent's sitting room and playing with Blaise. She saw herself sitting at the table and watched her parents talking to Death Eaters and crying. She felt anger and maybe a little remorse. She remembered being in a stroller with Blaise as her parents were running from Death Eaters, she felt scared and wanted to scream in fear. Then Hermione remembered saying bye to her brother and crying as he went to live with her aunt. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. She suddenly missed him immensely and wanted to hug him and ask if everything would be okay.</p>
<p>She felt more tears coming and sniffled, looking at her parents she stood up and hugged them "I'm sorry I got mad at you, I know you were just protecting me." Hermione smiled a little biting the corner of her lip, "But I don't understand why Blaise went to live with someone else." She looked confused and for some reason wanted to call him Blay. She would have to figure out why later.</p>
<p>"Well Hermione, your aunt said she would look after him until we came out of hiding. I trusted my sister, but if I had known she was going to return to the Dark Lord I would have told her no!" Her mother looked sad "I miss your brother everyday Hermione. I still talk to him though, he writes me once a week and tell us about Hogwarts and how you are doing. You know he misses you, He tells us all the time. He told me to tell you sooner, but I was too afraid to."</p>
<p>Hermione tried to look mad but failed miserably and snorted "Afraid of what, I am a big girl, and I helped defeat Voldemort. I am the smartest witch of my age!" She remembered something and shook her head "You both were in Slytherin right?" She watched them nod their heads "Then how come I was sorted into Gryffindor and Blaise into Slytherin?"</p>
<p>Her parents laughed a little, glad their daughter was back to her usual self; even if just a little bit "Well it just shows us that you were born to be good, thanks to you and Harry we can stop hiding from our world. If you three had not defeated the Dark Lord, we would never have been able to be an honest and normal family again. Well as normal as any magical family, that is."</p>
<p>The smiling and laughing calmed everyone down, and they went back inside. "Dad, why do I remember a blond haired little boy but I cannot remember his name for the life of me?"</p>
<p>Her parents looked at each other and nodded "He was your best friend, your first little boyfriend. You and he were inseparable, and it was so cute."</p>
<p>Hermione blushed slightly before smiling, "Okay so what was his name? Does he go to Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>Her parents ignored her questions and continued "We used to laugh when you would say he had cooties and boy germs, but you would always hug him when he left and kissed his cheek. Blaise used to get jealous because it was his friend too and you would always steal him away to play with you. We used to joke that you two would get married one day."</p>
<p>They looked sad for a moment "But then his father took him away and said we were becoming too good for the Dark Lord and he didn't want his son to be on the good side. You were sad when he left; you would cry every night asking for him. He gave you that little-stuffed dragon you still sleep with."</p>
<p>Her father chuckled "You would tell us that your dragon "Drake" would always keep you safe and you never went anywhere without it."</p>
<p>Hermione blushed a little "I don't sleep with Drake anymore…well fine, I do; but only because it makes me feel safe" She looked at her hands and grinned " Besides that dragon used to talk to me when I was little, it used to tell me it loved me and that it would always protect me from evil."</p>
<p>She covered her mouth with her hand "I swear I don't know where that came from; I didn't remember that until just now." She turned red and pretended that her nails needed to be looked at. She bit her bottom lip "Please continue" she said not looking at them embarrassed.</p>
<p>Her parents shared a knowing glance and smiled "Well, the day he left you two took a walk around the backyard and held hands. He told you he would always remember you and never love anyone else because you were his. That he was going to wait for you and that he loved you. Your father and I found it to be sweet but for two eight-year-olds to say that we were worried this would affect you more then we wanted. You cried yourself to sleep the night he left and used to blame Blaise for him leaving. It was kind of cute, but also heartbreaking to see our little girl so sad. That's when we decided that when we went into hiding, we would put a memory charm on you so you wouldn't be sad anymore and so you would be safe."</p>
<p>Her mother hugged her and kissed her forehead "Don't cry sweetheart, you will remember his name when you are ready to. We do know who he is, but we are still unsure how you will take it." She took her hand and went to the living room to sit down. "You look tired dear; maybe you should take a nap. This is a lot to deal with in one day."</p>
<p>Hermione agreed and kissed her parents' goodnight before going to her room and falling asleep. In her dream, all she could think about was a cute little blond boy with blue-grey eyes and a grin on his face. She smiled in her sleep and let her mind relax as the rest of her memories slowly came back to her. "I miss you," she said in her sleep before turning over and frowning.</p>
