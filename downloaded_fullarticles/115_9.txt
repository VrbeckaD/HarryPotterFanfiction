    <p>Livinnis Vivian Fall glared at the goblin who handed her a thick golden key.</p><p>Vivian thought it would have been easier, certainly, to steal their child from under their noses than to go through the legalities of it all. There was a line to her determination she could muster before Narcissa decided to change her mind, a circumstance much gruelling than the case she had against the child's father, and for a considerate moment before heaving the key against the tinier lock, she wondered whether she should give up her little joys of mischief.</p><p>She could shred Lucius, the child's father, to pieces on temporary guardianship considering how far she had buried her bones down in the law school around her seventh life.</p><p>Narcissa, however.</p><p>She was a weaver of society, a fine retainer of people, considering the many acquaintances she could pull out of their occupations and friends to be called from afar. There was one little man from Bulgaria who made his way over to the courtroom when Narcissa demanded a last-minute witness in less than three seconds without knowing what he was walking into. And if that little man had lost some of his composure, Vivian would not have been leafing through papers for an additional day, but alas he was all professional and sharp, and Vivian had to delay the official hearing. Most importantly, she was Narcissa Black, with a house name to her blood and more respect within all things magical.</p><p>She did, delightfully, anticipate the joy of the theoretical regards in organising words as it served better evidence than trying to prepare a debate for hours, nonetheless looking for references to which clause and such law. But as her dearest brother had taken over those paper legalities, she had nothing to do but prepare her tongue for a ridiculous exercise.</p><p>The manner in which she burdened herself was distasteful.</p><p>Vivian dusted her knee-length skirt as the vault clanged open. It was her last bid to convince Narcissa with her wealth, of all things, but her brother had been adamant in pressing upon her some figurative evidence. She stalked in the vault, which held at the forefront a hall of silver linings upon bare walls with an elongated table and chair sufficient to hold an abundant meal of polished black wood in design. There were the continuous rows of shelves she did not deign observing, as it was endless in its existence.</p><p>She didn't sit, nor offer Narcissa a reprise from their adventure down the goblin-made tunnels, and stood stoically as she spoke.</p><p>"There was never an otherwise for the Blacks and neither for those who became in-laws to such a prestigious line. I may be a descendent of Flamel, but as tied in blood to the Fawleys, and by extension the Blacks, it was either we extended our riches or destroyed it all like the Gaunts." Vivian moved her gaze towards the expressionless woman. "There will always be the if, the hesitance, so allow me to reassure you by this impression."</p><p>Vivian looked unimpressed, factually uncaring, of the vault they stood within, perhaps more than the size of her husband's Narcissa had walked into the day before their wedding with her father's assessing leer. The vault was a mansion of displayed wealth, and for a moment Narcissa wondered if outward extravagance should be held with contempt when faced with the grandeur before her, and Vivian's common clothes. She was quite certain, after all, that the glass vase held on the lower second shelf was a hallmark of the Wizarding World's French Magical Committee of Extraneous Affairs, gifted to the German Ministry with their Peace and Unity gifts.</p><p>"There is no Fawley married to someone of lower their status, Ms. Fall." Narcissa's voice rang clear, sharp.</p><p>"Lower?" Vivian asked.</p><p>"Unheard of, as mundane a Fall is in this world."</p><p>Vivian could feel her patience wear thin. Kidnapping was certainly under consideration, she thought briefly. She closed her eyes so as to prevent her glare.</p><p>"Vivian Fall, the Fall a derivative of Fawley, one which ran to the guide of Grindelwald long before the jester entered court. By all means call me a Fawley, save I have created my own name as by tradition. His accomplishments are so minute compared to the accomplishments of Grindelwald I wish myself under a rock."</p><p>"You fear him." Narcissa said, understanding the 'jester' for who she indicated.</p><p>"I fear death. The fall of the House of Fawley. Besides, I highly doubt you've ever heard of a younger Flamel other than I?"</p><p>"Oh?" Narcissa intoned.</p><p>It was a sigh of boredom to its utmost. Vivian felt her fingers twitch. Narcissa had seen her for the past three months they were past acquaintances, and reigning in her body language was becoming harder the more fonder Vivian saw Narcissa's stone face to be. Although fond may not be the most adept description.</p><p>Vivian sighed, turning to the rows of glass displays, and frowned at the few rattling boxes to relive her mind.</p><p>"You truly cannot be as ignorant as to the casualties of war by your upbringing."</p><p>"This is not about him," Narcissa's sharp voice rang, "it is about my son."</p><p>A blinding mother's love, Vivian tilted her head, before she found herself understanding Narcissa's misunderstanding. Vivian reigned back another sigh.</p><p>"I am not asking for your son. I am asking for your son's safety, Black. You, not your husband."</p><p>Black, she emphasised, so as to separate Narcissa from her husband's standing in society. Vivian watched the corner of Narcissa's eyes crinkle and wondered if she had understood.</p><p>"I see."</p><p>Vivian swallowed a thoughtless word which lingered in the hollowness of her mouth before grudgingly ending the conversation.</p><p>"I'll begin the procedures tomorrow, then."</p><p>She knew Lucius Malfoy, and where his fingers breached. Hence she was capable of suing, despite the  considerable distance between herself and Lucius Malfoy over his sole heir Draco Malfoy on the 1st of December, 1981, when Draco Malfoy had turned slightly over one years and three months.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was, to the date, one month after Lucius Malfoy had been acquitted of serving under the 'Dark Lord', and exactly two weeks after Vivian had began to establish the counter-case against the acquittal on the charges on lack of evidence.</p><p> </p><p align="center">...</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>1981 December 1st</em>
</p><p>The British Ministry of Magic was damp, dark, and grey. There was not much to be seen within its walls, as its important departments lay elsewhere but the ministry in name, hence the word 'courtroom' was more viable as a description. It's magic, still festering, was one Vivian was attuned with. If building could have emotions, and in this world they certainly did, Vivian would have called the building cold, dispassionate, but so complimentary to her own decision making attributions it made sense to revel in it once she stepped foot within.</p><p>The ministry was going to be disappointed, she thought, once the war is over.</p><p>"Ah, Ms. Fall."</p><p>The woman seemed less than pleased to greet her, despite breaking her from her thoughts.</p><p>"It is such a bothersome task, I must have you know, to be working around legalities for two months."</p><p>"Why," Vivian smiled pleasantly, "it will be over quite soon, don't you think?"</p><p>Millicent Bagnold glared at her with displeased eyes, as she knew Vivian was, quite frankly, incapable of succeeding with Narcissa Black refusing to give any evidence nor testimonies. She was pleased to round up Lucius with the others on a brand of a criminal, save she had wished for that, and nothing further.</p><p>"You know as well as I do, it will end quite devastatingly."</p><p>"Oh, my."</p><p>Vivian tilted her head, and her gathered hair fell smoothly on her shoulder. It covered the side of her face from which Millicent Bagnold stood, and quickly forming a grimace at their conversation Vivian smiled once she turned back. Millicent kept on.</p><p>"The moment you stepped your pointy toes in British soil, you were bound to our priorities."</p><p>Vivian stared for a moment before breathing out a singular laugh. Bagnold looked at her judgementally, and turned to walk down the grey corridor.</p><p>"You do realise that you may be tearing apart a perfectly happy family? Their prestige is not something that you can simply look over, as much as their connections, and you will witness yourself from those at those ministry seats, as you should be. What you demand is conflicting even for your own comprehension, as what you mean by temporary guardianship may as well mean indefinite separation."</p><p>Her words were degrading, explaining something Vivian herself knew well only reflected her, and the ministry as a whole, perception of the case.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"I demanded nothing of that sort, Millicent. I've never asked them to refrain from any contact, but to only replace their son into a better environment. It is for the best, considering what happened earlier on your tenure."</p><p>Millicent Bagnold paused before the courtroom's doors.</p><p>"What I do not understand, then, is the reason you seek out a Malfoy. If you are about to adopt an innocent child out of future conflict you may as well start up an orphanage."</p><p>"Don't make me consider that seriously Millicent," Vivian whispered as she opened the doors, "I may actually begin a two-year campaign to extract every soul."</p><p>Vivian reigned in her snort at such a paling face, then reconsidered her words. If the session was to be successful it was probably possible to begin a campaign of relocating children, yet her brother would be more than willing to twist her neck if she began anything on a larger scale. The horrors of children remained, after all.</p><p>She found herself meeting a viper's eyes, one which demanded strangulation. It was a pity, as she had once known the woman as a passing acquaintance. Someone of formal treatment without a second glance.</p><p>"No." Millicent hissed before strutting to her seat.</p><p>Before the wide, grey courtroom, she sat on the highest throne, as all others watched on in a peacefully hateful silence.</p><p>"We will begin the session. Familial hearing of the 1st of December, into disputes claimed under the recent rise of You Know Who and the services of Lucius Malfoy by Vivian Fall, and further claims over the son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black, Draco Malfoy. Scribe, Bartemius Crouch, Minister for Magic, Millicent Bagnold, Head of the Registrar of Magical Families and Children, Ophelia Hester-"</p><p>Vivian felt a pointed look and turned to find Narcissa staring complacently at her. Profanities welled in her mind, because she had seen the look on desperate people who were, perhaps, before a decision that was not of their own choosing but for their beloved ones. And those decision were mostly ill placed for those on the receiving end.</p><p>"Vivian Fall, please submit any further evidence or claims before the procession."</p><p>"None."</p><p>"Any involved-"</p><p>"Narcissa Malfoy." Narcissa spoke.</p><p>Lucius turn a lightly troubled gaze towards his wife, even as Vivian snapped her gaze to him with a start. Perhaps she had misread complacency, or she was more tired than she thought she was.</p><p>"Lucius Malfoy, please submit any further evidence or claims before the procession."</p><p>"None."</p><p>It really didn't bode well for neither Vivian nor Lucius when Narcissa had such determination at the forefront, and with sudden compulsion she found herself looking at Lucius with more than strangled features. Certainly, when their eyes met, his dull eyes seemed to confer.</p><p>"Proceeding, Narcissa Malfoy, regarding the claims on the 16th of August..."</p><p>Well, Vivian leaned back with a startling realisation that she had shared a brief moment with Lucius, this also bode well. With Narcissa, with a court, with herself, something was bound to change in the most twisted manner she wouldn't have been able to place herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The hearing ended in the late evening, and was recorded as the longest familial hearing of the decade.</p><p>"My goodness, I would have never seen that coming." Millicent stumbled forward as she mumbled to herself.</p><p>Vivian smiled sinisterly as she strode down the hall. She had not meant to eavesdrop on Millicent Bagnold's self-importance, nor did she wish to agree. She did, however, wish to provoke.</p><p>"Oh," Vivian said, "I did. The moment she stared at me when I walked in, I had that notion it would all go below. Down."</p><p>Millicent glared.</p><p>"I must have you know those are usually reserved for dealings with lawyers outside of court, and that the accuser does not have the right to speak freely with the testifier, and that I've broken so many rules for the two of you, that you should be expecting a charge. At the least a formal warning."</p><p>"No one can stop Narcissa Black. I think we have only just began to realise how long a patience she has for the moment to strike."</p><p>"Leave, I demand of you."</p><p>Her boundless energy never seemed to drain, Vivian thought wryly. But watching Narcissa emerge from the door Vivian displaced Millicent's elbow briefly before turning towards the blond-haired woman.</p><p>"By my will, Bagnold. Narcissa."</p><p>"Vivian," she returned.</p><p>The woman looked infuriatingly calm, considering how many confusions she had caused both her husband and Vivian.</p><p>"I would like to go over the finer details," Vivian enunciated, "where the necessary tools for a contract may be."</p><p>"Then I must impose, as my husband begins his house arrest."</p><p>Vivian slowly angled her foot towards the gates as fireplaces roared to life. It was in indication to leave, although there was much she wished to speak of, and even as they both headed towards one labelled 'South' Vivian could only take notice of Narcissa's freshly worn heel of her boots. It meant anger, by the manner she placed more weight on her heels, perhaps frustration or a temporary loss of composure.</p><p>They sat in Vivian's sitting room down Dover between red bricks.</p><p>"You are not under his control," Vivian sighed into the air, "and in between the devotions for your husband and your son you know where your loyalties lie. I have taken up a post in Durmstrang as their offer came nearly weeks before, one of the few reasons I wished to conclude our disagreements as quickly as it could be. If you are unsure and I must ask you with certainty, to confirm your connections with my lodgings by your means."</p><p>It was to be her son's lodgings, after all, in the possible nearest future where she could find with within her mother's heart to bring forth the initiative of relocation. A quill lay scratching between them.</p><p>"There is one thing I wish to ask further of you, as the head of the House of Fawley."</p><p>"I must ask you to refrain from calling me that even in the most private settings, Narcissa."</p><p>"Vivian." Narcissa restated. "While it is understandable why you are eager in extracting my son out of British soil and the castle in Scotland, and have long come to the understanding of your position, it does create a question as to why it has to be my son."</p><p>Vivian sat back, before completely releasing her grasp on the wine glass she had took to her hands for safety.</p><p>"I suppose I should not restrain myself. Allow me to reassure you that the following story can be verified, but it is widely rumoured as a folklore in Germany that a destiny exists for every born, a prophecy some may find interesting and others like any other. Most often they are abandoned, even if told, because one simply must forgo thousands of stories for the one vital one, or simply untold as it is deemed unimportant. It is partially my curiosity which has landed your son in the midst of this relocation, but simply put, the House is preparing for the Second Wizarding War, and your son's fate has been quite clinically destroyed in the most positive sense by my hands."</p><p>"The House." <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa began, but closed her mouth leaving the statement hanging. To which Vivian found her attentions honed on, as that was as close it could come to stuttering for someone of high upbringing.</p><p>"I believe I have already told you everything you must know, and by your oath I can answer more questions you inquire than I could of anyone else." Vivian reassured.</p><p>"You have once insisted that the House of Fawley does not involve themselves with outside matters and have not for three generations."</p><p>Vivian considered her words.</p><p>"We do not, as it guarantees our safety and the safety of our contacts," Vivian sounded the words carefully, "but I have taken a personal interest towards the fate of your child with, as I have insinuated, personal reasons. I will certainly leave his fate in his own hands, however, although I do have a completely different road ready for his taking if he desires."</p><p>"Heir."</p><p>Vivian nodded.</p><p>"Perhaps it may please your husband to know the House of Fawley does not associate themselves with other Houses with no prospective nor fundamental standing. For example, one of my other reasons for taking a personal interest in your son is the family's generations worth of survival. Not as extensive as the Blacks, but weathering through two major wars is a notable difference."</p><p>"Is it a similar tradition, then, to take other children as heir?"</p><p>"Ah, you've misunderstood something, Narcissa." Vivian smiled gently for the first time, "in all terms of legalities the House of Fawley does not exist. Which means, whoever is the next head of the House of Fawley will never be known as one."</p><p>Narcissa looked convinced, although it was well hid. Their conversation was coming to a close. A conversation which altered the fate of so many, yet so little in its ripples.</p><p>"And to emphasise,"Vivian added airily, "only nine living people, including you, know of me as Livinnis Vivian Fawley. All others have only heard of our reputation, and I promise you, it can be utilised to the greatest effects."</p>
