    <p>“Excuse me,” Harry said to a short, stout woman with red hair.</p><p align="left">“Hullo, dears,” she said with a warm smile “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new too.”</p><p align="left">The woman pointed to her youngest son who was tall, thin and lumbering. He had freckles like his siblings, rather large hands and feet, and to top it all off, his long nose.</p><p align="left">“Yes,” Harry said respectfully “but I’m alone, so why did you say ‘dears’ like there’s two of me?” Well then, who’s that behind you?” the woman said, moving her nose up a little, indicating that Harry should turn and look behind him.</p><p align="left">When he did, he saw a pair of brown eyes looking back at him, staring into the sparkling emerald of his own. Her hair was long and – unlike his – not black, but rather a very dark shade of brown that seemed to be black. She too had a large trolley like Harry and the other children, a rather beautiful white cat sitting in a cage much like Hedwig’s, its blue eyes piercing his soul. The main difference however, was the fact that the cat’s cage had far thicker bars and was filled with cat litter in the deep bottom.</p><p align="left">“Hi... um... sorry if I startled you,” the girl said with a smile “I saw your trunks and I thought I could follow you to Platform 9 and ¾.”</p><p align="left">Harry just smiled.</p><p align="left">“That’s okay, all we need to know is – ”</p><p align="left">“How to get onto the Platform?” the woman said, not seeming to be annoyed by the fact that Harry was now talking to this girl.</p><p align="left">As Harry turned back to the woman, her son and daughter, he and the other girl nodded.</p><p align="left">“Not to worry,” she said, her eyes moving between Harry and the girl “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared or you’ll crash into it, that’s very important to keep in mind. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.</p><p align="left">“Er- ladies first whatever-your-name-is,” Harry said quickly “I’m Harry by the way.”</p><p align="left">“My name is Mert Goldsworth,” Mert said with a look of exasperation that leached into her voice “And I hate being second.”</p><p align="left">With a muttered thank you to the woman, Mert rushed toward the ticket box and disappeared like Fred, George and Percy. Now it was as if she had never been standing behind Harry in the first place.</p><p align="left">“Must have had a rough morning,” the woman said with a kind smile in Harry’s direction.</p><p align="left">Ron nodded in agreement. Mert was on the other side of the barrier watching the younger children see off their older relatives and she was sure they would cry if something bad happened to the owls. Judging by the looks they gave her cat, this had actually happened at some point and knew better than to ask. The first few carriages of the red steam engine in front of Mert were packed with children of varying ages, many of them leaning out of the window to get one last word out to their parents or siblings. While Harry began to wonder what it would be like to have his own parents waving him goodbye, he almost ran into a round-faced boy who was talking to an elderly woman. Mert snorted to hold back a laugh, acquiring a grin from the awkwardness of it all.</p><p align="left">Harry swerved and heard the distracted boy say “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”</p><p align="left">"Oh, Neville,” the woman sighed.</p><p align="left">A boy a little further away with black dreadlocks was surrounded by excited students.</p><p align="left">“Give us a look Lee, go on!” someone said with a big smile.</p><p align="left">The boy with dreadlocks lifted the lid of the box in his arms and his crowd got closer, all of them squealing and shrieking as a long, hairy leg moved out from the now-open box. Mert gave it a sideways looks and cringed at the sight, her grin finally dissipating. Mert watched Harry struggle with his trunk, only to have one of the older ginger-haired boys help him. Mert looked down at her feet and searched around her for somebody to help, but nobody seemed tall or strong enough. After all, even Harry was having trouble with his trunk and he was taller than her by a hand. Just when all hope seemed lost, someone tapped her on the shoulder and spoke into her ear.</p><p align="left">“I’ll take the trunk, you take that cat,” the boy said.</p><p align="left">Mert nodded and caught sight of a burly boy with brown hair behind her.</p><p align="left">“Um... thanks. I didn’t catch your name,” Mert said as she entered a compartment reserved for first-years.</p><p align="left">The boy flashed a toothy yet oddly charming smile.</p><p align="left">“Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team,” he said proudly “I suppose you’ve never heard about Quidditch or the houses before?”</p><p align="left">Mert sat Winter next to her and Oliver stood in the doorway. She shook her head no.</p><p align="left">“Well,” Oliver began, beaming “At Hogwarts there are four houses a first year like you can be sorted into: Gryffindor – like me – Slytherin, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. Brave people go into Gryffindor, if you ask me. I reckon the nasty ones go into Slytherin, the ones who are too nice for their own good go into Hufflepuff and the smart ones end up in Ravenclaw. Quidditch is a bit harder to explain, but once you see a match you’ll get it pretty quickly.”</p><p align="left">“Well then,” Mert said with a look of determination on her face “I guess I’d want to be in any house... especially if I can prove that all the kids in Slytherin aren’t that bad.”</p><p align="left">Oliver smiled again, this time with a little less teeth showing.</p><p align="left">“You do that sweetheart,” he said with a wave, leaving Mert alone for a few seconds.</p><p align="left">Oliver suddenly ducked back and said “Hang on, what’s your name?”</p><p align="left">Mert held back a chuckle.</p><p align="left">“Mert Goldsworth. It was nice meeting you Oliver... and thanks for carrying the trunk.”</p><p align="left">“Anytime,” Oliver said, weaving his way around a few younger students as they raced past him to another carriage “Watch it you lot! Enjoy the trip Mert.”</p><p align="left">Mert waved goodbye to Oliver who was giving three boys odd looks. They made a right turn for Mert’s compartment and she furrowed her brow.</p><p align="left">“Is anyone taking up these seats?” a blonde boy asked.<br/> Mert relaxed and shook her head.</p><p align="left">“No,” she answered “But you’re welcome to take them if you like.”</p><p align="left">The boys crowded into the compartment and they began introducing themselves... at least, the two taller ones looked like they wanted to. The blonde boy did it for them.</p><p align="left">“I’m Malfoy, Draco Malfoy,” the blonde said as he gestured to the two boys at his side “And this is Crabbe and Goyle. What’s your name?”</p><p align="left">“Mert; Mert Goldsworth.”</p><p align="left">“Haven’t heard of anybody with that name before...” Draco said, looking over at Mert’s cat Winter.</p><p align="left">“I love cats,” Crabbe said with a smile as he tried to pet it.</p><p align="left">Winter sniffed his fingers and hissed, hair standing up on end. Crabbe moved his hand back and sat next to Goyle on the opposite side while Draco sat next to Mert. It was lucky they had, because the train had begun to move almost as soon as their rear ends touched the seat. Draco looked out of the window at a man who resembled him; tall and gaunt with long white-blonde hair tied behind his back. Draco received a small wave from the man Mert could only assume was his father.</p><p align="left">“Winter!” Mert said angrily when he hissed again “Behave yourself; he was going to hurt you. He just wanted to say hello.”</p><p align="left">Winter nodded and Mert jerked her head in the cat’s direction.</p><p align="left">“Try again,” she said casually “Winter’s a rare cat: he can change forms.”</p><p align="left">Winter suddenly morphed into a beautiful owl like Harry’s, the only difference being her eyes. A strange pale blue rather than the yellow that was most common in the species.</p><p align="left">“Amazing!” Goyle said “Where’d you get him?”</p><p align="left">“My father found him on the streets one night and he transformed right in front of us... because I got upset about not being allowed to have cats in the house,” Mert said, earning confused expressions from the three boys.</p><p align="left">“What happened?” Crabbe said, completely mesmerised by Mert’s story.</p><p align="left">“He turned into a fish so we had to put him in a bowl of water,” Mert said with grin “and the next day we got my letter for Hogwarts.”</p><p align="left">“How is he rare if you changed him then?” Crabbe said, earning a scoff from Draco.</p><p align="left">“And how many times have you seen a transfiguring animal Crabbe? Goyle?”</p><p align="left">He paused, and when he got no answered, continued to make his point.</p><p align="left">“I thought so,” he said proudly “I’d love to have a friend like you Mert; someone who’s smart, knows what they’re talking about... and of course you have at least half a brain in your head too.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Well then, you’d probably want to talk to Harry,” Mert said, feeling a little guilty about the way she had spoken in front of the kind woman “He seems nice enough.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Wait, what was his full name?” Draco said eagerly “Did you catch it?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Sorry, no,” Mert said “Why? Is he someone special?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“He more special than 10 of your cats!” Crabbe said with a dead serious expression.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Is he what all the fuss is about?” Mert asked as she pointed toward the front of the train “Is that why everybody ran that way?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Come on you two, we’re investigating,” Draco said, leaving quickly through the sliding door of the compartment with Crabbe and Goyle in tow.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">After a little while, Draco came back with a pink tinge in his pale cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Was it him?” Mert said with widened eyes.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Draco kicked the seat and Mert jumped slightly in shock.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“He didn’t want to be friends with me... some ruddy Weasley got to him first,” Draco scowled “Potter said he could ‘tell who the wrong sort are’... the nerve.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert made a face of disappointment. Harry had seemed like a nice person, but to imply that Draco wasn’t of a ‘nice sort’ told her otherwise.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“You know what Draco?” Mert said as Draco sat down next to her.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“What?” he said dejectedly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Goldsworth more than Potter’s friendship any time of the year,” Mert said crudely, holding out a hand for Draco to take.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Draco looked at Mert side-on and turned to face her, staring at her hand and then looked up.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Let’s hope you’re a Slytherin,” Draco said with a lopsided smirk as he shook her hand.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert smiled.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“I’ll be one of the best Slytherin that ever was or will be,” Mert said with a wicked grin.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">She held the expression and looked over at Goyle.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“That’s a pretty scary face your making,” Goyle said as he edged closer to Crabbe.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert laughed and Draco joined her. Mert saw Goyle’s injured hand and pulled a small bandaid out of her pocket.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“What happened to your finger?!” Mert said with worry.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Weasley’s bloody rat,” Goyle muttered.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Winter can lick it and heal up your wound a little faster, right?” Mert said to the caged animal.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">She opened the door and Winter flew out, sitting on Goyle’s knee and turning into a small white dog. He lapped at Goyle's hand and he made a pained face for a</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">couple of seconds, but soon it subsided.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Why did that get rid of the sting so much?” Goyle said in exasperation.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Dogs saliva is good at healing wounds on their own body, so why shouldn’t it help with ours?” Mert suggested, seeing the lady with her trolley roll past.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Give a second,” Mert said as she stood and poked her head out of the door.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">After a quick exchange of Galleons, Mert had gotten them a packet of Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans each and a small cup of water for herself.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Thanks,” Draco said as he took the jelly beans.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">He deposited two of the packets in Crabbe’s hands while he kept hold of the other two, including Mert’s. She couldn’t eat them while she treated Goyle’s hand.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">After wiping over Goyle’s hand with the water to get rid of the blood, Mert used the bandage to cover up the injured finger.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“That should keep you going until we get to Hogwarts,” she said in assurance “Then you can have someone else look at it.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Crabbe was stunned by Mert and Goyle looked like he was ready to marry her.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Thanks Mert,” he said with a smile as Crabbe dropped the beans in his lap.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Well... I’m going to head off and change into my robes,” Mert said as she undid a buckle on her trunk, her robes falling into her hand “You lot can change while I’m gone.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert wasn’t there to see it, but the boys were scrambling to grab their robes and put them on before she got back. Of course, that had lead to Crabbe getting a nasty bruise on his hip form falling into the seat while he put on his socks. When Mert got back and they were fully dressed, they all started a game where one person picked a bean of a particular colour, the group found one that looked the same and then they all ate it, revealing what flavours were hidden inside. The worst one was a sickly green coloured bean which – in Draco’s case – turned out to be vomit flavoured. He didn’t need to eat the bean to find out what vomit tasted like, because he had been forced to run off and do exactly that in the boys lavatories. Mert and Crabbe got green apple and Goyle was stuck with cabbage. After watching the countryside change from rolling hills and open meadows to mountains and forests, Mert realised that they would be stopping very soon. As if proving her right, they all heard a voice echo through the train.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes time. Please leave your luggage on the train, as it will be taken to the school separately.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert smiled and locked Winter away in his cage. Draco glanced at the new addition to his group and – when they all alighted the train – they heard a voice call out to them.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Firs’-years! Firs’-years over here!”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">The owner of this voice was tall man with a big beard and belly to suit. He was holding a big lamp above all their heads. He spoke to Harry over all of their voices only to remember that he had a job to do.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“C’mon, follow me – any more firs’-years? Mind yer step now! Firs’-years follow me!” the man bellowed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Draco slipped and stumbled next to Mert along with his friends, each step placed down to find footing on the steep, damp path. Nobody spoke, but the occasional bump caused a student to squeak in fright until the person with a wandering  hand that sat on their shoulder calmed them down. Crabbe and Goyle were practically hugging one another but Draco was at least playing off his fright by pretending he had come back from a fall. One of the girls off to Mert’s right – with thick, brown frizzy hair – gave him a look that spoke of nothing but disappointment. The boy who had been searching for his toad sniffled here and there, but stopped when they heard the tall man speak again.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” he called over his shoulder, “jus round this bend here.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Mert and most of the other children gave a resounding “Oooooh” at the sight before them.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">They had left the dark, narrow path to find a black lake spanning the gap between themselves and a rather tall mountain. Perched on top of this mountain with windows that sparkled against the night sky was a vast castle, covered with turrets and towers that took Mert’s breath away. It was one of the most astounding things she had ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“No more’n four to a boat!” called the tall bearded man, pointing to a small armada of wooden boats on the edge of the water, barely touching land.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Harry and the youngest Weasley son were joined in a boat by the girl with frizzy brown hair and the boy that still hadn’t found his toad. Mert got into a boat with Draco, Crabbe and Goyle, sitting next to the latter of the three. She didn’t mind it because – despite outward appearances – he was a nice person to be around.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Everyone in?” the bearded man shouted, expecting an answer that never came “Right then – FORWARD!”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">With the word spoken, all the boats along the shore jolted forward and began floating across the lake, not a single ripple in sight. The ride was so smooth that Mert could have sworn it was made of glass; it even had the same reflective qualities. A great silence had fallen over the children as they watched the castle loom ahead in the distance. It was like travelling back in time. Soon the castle towered over them as they got ever closer to the cliff on which the ancient structure stood.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Heads down!” the man yelled from his boat.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Not wanting to find out what would happen if they didn’t follow his instruction, all of the students bent their heads down – forward for most – but the boy who seemed to be forgetful bent backward and made a squeal, telling the others in his boat that he had seen a big spider, causing the boy with red hair to shudder. Mert snickered when a wall of ivy ran over their backs and the boy made a louder squeal than before: even Draco, Crabbe and Goyle had a good giggle. They entered a dark tunnel in the side of the cliff, under the castle until they reached what looked like an underground harbour. As they clambered out of the boats quickly, Mert’s robes got caught and she fell down onto the sharp rocks and pebbles, rock piercing her skin. Despite the burning pain, Mert stood up and found a friendly hand lift her up. The boy who lost his toad apparently got it back, judging by the joyous cry of “Trevor!” nearby.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Thanks... who’re you?” Mert said as she picked a few rocks out of her forearms and knees.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“I’m Pansy Parkinson,” the girl said with a smile “What about you?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Mert.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">She followed Pansy and the others to up through a passageway in the rock – led by the tall man and his big lamp – coming out on crisp emerald grass that was overshadowed by the castle. Mert slid a little on one foot and realised that it was quite slippery. Goyle managed to almost bowl over Pansy and Crabbe as he went for a trip, but Draco used it to his advantage and slid away from them. When they got to the door after climbing a flight of stone steps, the tall man called out to Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle at the back.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“You alrig’ back there, everyone still here?” he said with genuine worry, quickly turning his attention to someone else “You there, still got yer’ toad?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">The man raised one large fist and knocked on the huge oak door three times. In her mind, Mert heard a voice say <em>This is it!</em></p>
