          <div class="userstuff"><p>She sits in his lap</p>
<p>Before the sitting room hearth</p>
<p>Lost to eyes of green.</p>
<p>His fingers slide through red-gold</p>
<p>Tresses, lavender scented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Behind, needles click,</p>
<p>Percussion in four/four time; </p>
<p>Molly, knitting, says,</p>
<p>‘Harry, you need a haircut,’</p>
<p>A gasp, freckled hands entwine,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Red hair framed face;</p>
<p>Brown eyes glare over shoulder.</p>
<p>Daring. Possessive.</p>
<p>‘His hair is all mine now, Mum.</p>
<p>That is in the vows we made.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chuckling, he asks her,</p>
<p>‘Which part was that, remind me?’</p>
<p>She grins wickedly.</p>
<p>‘To be my Heart, and my Soul,</p>
<p>Thus keeping us balanced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘With my hair short, then</p>
<p>To keep our souls in balance</p>
<p>Your hair must be long.’</p>
<p>Laughter abounds, even Ginny</p>
<p>He floats on musical mirth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I love your laugh,’ says</p>
<p>Harry. Foreheads touch lightly</p>
<p>Velvet lips press once.</p>
<p>Arthur nods, his daughter holds</p>
<p>His son of heart, now in law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Glinting, Molly’s eyes</p>
<p>Catch his, exchange within</p>
<p>Hope, and Joy, and Love.</p>
<p>Leaning in, she says quietly.</p>
<p>‘Remind you of anyone, Dear?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His fingers stroke laugh</p>
<p>And worry lines, graying hairs,</p>
<p>Sees smooth skin, red locks.</p>
<p>Conspiratorially,</p>
<p>‘Yes, they do, Mollywobbles.’</p>
