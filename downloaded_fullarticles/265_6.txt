          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry held out his hand, face slowly turning red. </p>
<p>“Yes?” Draco asked, knowing full well what Harry wanted, but enjoying watching him squirm all the same.</p>
<p>“Dance with me?” He asked awkwardly, and Draco smiled, grey eyes glittering.</p>
<p>“If you insist,” he replied, taking Harry’s hand. </p>
<p>They were at one of the many Ministry Balls that happened every year, Draco’s hair tied back in a loose ponytail, Harry’s as wild and untamed as ever, both wearing their work mandated dress robes; Harry’s red for the Auror department, Draco’s a navy blue for the Unspeakables. </p>
<p>A large crystal chandelier was hanging over them, and it sent sparkling lights around the room as witches, wizards, and wixes alike spun across the polished floor. They ignored the many faces turning their way as they walked, nosy officials, wondering why <em>the</em> Harry Potter was asking someone like Draco Malfoy to dance. Draco didn’t mind; he was used to it. And it was about time that everyone learned he and Harry were together. This seemed like a perfectly fine way to tell them. </p>
<p>“I beg you not to step on my toes,” Draco intoned as they began to face each other, Harry’s blush growing ever more apparent. </p>
<p>“I’ll—I’ll try,” he said, staring at their feet in focus as they moved. </p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, sighing playfully and wrapping his arm around Harry, pulling him closer. He leaned forward, bringing his lips devilishly close to Harry’s ear, his breath warm, “why don’t I take the lead, sweetheart?”</p></div>
