    <p><br/>
“Potter, wake up,” Mrs Dursley’s voice was Harry’s daily alarm clock. If it weren’t for her sharp, clipped voice waking him up every morning, the day just wouldn’t feel right. <br/>
<br/>
Though it didn’t feel right, anyway. Something was strangely off in her voice, the way the syllables were a bit too rushed, just barely wavering at the end. You wouldn’t have noticed it if you hadn’t heard the same whine every morning for the past 13 years, which Harry had. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And for some reason, there was a pause before she walked away in an odd shuffle, rather than her usual unhesitant trot. Something was definitely wrong, but Harry couldn’t exactly place it. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He sat for a little while in his uncomfortable bed, rubbing his blurry eyes before putting on his glasses, and raking a lazy hand through uncooperative hair. Again, he noticed something unfamiliar, the house was quiet. Unlike every other morning, he couldn’t hear his cousin shouting at the telly, or at his aunt and uncle. It was like he was abducted by aliens in the night. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Harry could only dream. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>So he stuck with reality, and pulled on a pair of cotton shorts, despite the upcoming autumn chill, and one of Dudleys ugly green T-shirt’s. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He was surprised to not hear the snarky remark from his uncle to ‘hurry up’ when he reached the creaky floorboard at the top of the  thickly carpeted stairs. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Harry’s journey down them was hesitant but curious, and he resisted the urge to stick his head over the banister to snoop a look into the kitchen. Instead he kept his eyes front, and tapped down the last stairs, and into the hallway. He peeked a glance at his old bedroom like he did almost every morning, glad he wasn’t stuck in the confined space any longer. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Come along, boy,” was the first thing he heard from his Uncle all morning. He had stepped into the kitchen and almost had a heart attack at the sight of his extended family sat around the table. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Aunt Marge was there, as well, which alone could have sent him into cardiac arrest. Now he knew for sure there was something wrong: they were all looking right at him, which they tended to avoid on a daily basis. </p><p>Dudley was sat with an untouched plate of bacon, eggs and beans on toast, something Harry never saw in front of him unless it was placed by himself. He was staring at Harry with a gormless gape on his face, his parents stood on either side of him. Petunia had her bony hands on his shoulder, looking uncomfortable and slightly guilty. Vernon was stood further back, by the window — like he’d previously been looking out of it. Aunt Marge was sat on one of the chairs, a steamy mug of tea in front of her, and a smug sneer on her face. <br/>
<br/>
“Good morning...?” Harry tried. Mr Dursley went slightly red. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“It is certainly <em>not </em>a good morning, Potter,” he replied thickly, “Not for you at least.” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Harry gave them all a confused, slightly worried, look, hovering by the kitchen door without knowing exactly what to do. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Aunt Marge gave him a cruel smile, “It’s certainly not a good morning for him, Vernon. But it’s a very good morning for us, indeed. In fact, it’s such a good morning I think we should celebrate later on tonight. It’s such a special occasion after all...” </p><p>The cruelty in her voice was enough to make Harry shudder. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“In approximately four hours, a train will be leaving Paddington Station, heading westbound to Manchester. Shortly after the train has arrived, a staff member at The Little Trolly Inn is expecting the arrival of a ratty 14-year-old-boy with a scholarship to attend Humperdink Academy for Boys. That staff member is to provide a room for the boy until the school opens for the new year at the start of September. Now Harry, who do you think that boy is, hm?” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Harry had grown stiff as the woman talked, a bubble of dread, anger and disbelief growing in his chest. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Me,” He croaked, the look of dread plastered on his face giving the cruel woman satisfaction. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Look Vernon, the boy has some brains after all!” She cooed to her brother, before sharply changing her tone, “Now go pack your things.” </p><p><br/>
“What?” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Are you deaf boy?! Go pack your things!” She repeated harshly. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What—? You can just— you can’t just <em>kick me out </em>without any notice—?” Harry spluttered, flabbergasted. <br/>
<br/>
“We can, and we will,” Uncle Vernon’s voice cut him off. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“And what about when the school years over— how did you even get me a scholarship?!” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“That’s for me to know and you to never find out— and we’ll cross that bridge when it comes to it. Now go, or we’ll send you with nothing.” </p><p>Harry looked around in frustration, before storming away from the kitchen. He should’ve stayed in bed. </p><p>There was nothing in his room to pack, besides old hand me downs and a few cheap clothes from charity shops. There was a fairly good rucksack, though; something bought for Dudley to get him into hiking, which was never going to happen to begin with. It could probably pack around 70 litres, so he knew it would be enough to store everything. By the time he packed his small collection of clothes and tied a pair of Dudleys unused (slightly big) walking boots on his feet, the bag had barely gotten heavier. He listened for anyone coming up the stairs before removing the bottom plank from his wardrobe, pulling out a book. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Among it’s pages was about £100 worth of five and ten pound notes he’d salvaged or earned throughout his years. A few pictures of people he didn’t recognise, and an old photo of Aunt Petunia and her sister. Harry’s mother. Lily Potter. They were children, but Petunia still had a sour face. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Lily was beautiful, though. Despite it being low quality, he would sometimes compare the picture to the mirror, and try to pick out any slight similarities— the most obvious being their smiles. <br/>
<br/>
He stared at the picture a moment, before stuffing it in the book, and the book in the bag. As a last resort he placed a tattered red cap over his unruly hair, and left his bedroom without looking back. </p><p align="center">•••</p><p align="left">When he reached the top of the stairs, he started at the sight of his Aunt Petunia, a long finger pressed against her thin lips as she waved him towards her. </p><p align="left">Avoiding every creak on the stairs, he made his way towards her cautiously. </p><p align="left">“Listen, Potter. I didn’t agree to this—“ She held up a hand before Harry could sneer at her, “If it had been my way, I would have kept you here. As much as a hinderance you are, you’ve grown on me. More like a rash than anything else, but nonetheless, you are my sisters son, and as a mother myself I find it hard to watch you leave to fend for yourself.”</p><p align="left">Harry could only gape at her. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">“Shut your mouth or the flies will get in,” she murmured, a small smile on her lips, “Now take this. I was planning to spend it on getting a decorator for the sitting room, but I suppose the lavender isn’t so bad after all.” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">Harry stared at the envelope in her hands. It looked thick enough to hold a good amount of money, and Harry almost denied her offer. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">But then he saw the almost desperate look in her eyes, barely conceived by her snobby, cold mask. And he let her slip the envelope into his bag. </p><p align="left">With only a small glance, and firm nod, she glides away back into the kitchen, probably before anyone noticed she’d gone missing for a strange amount of time. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">Harry stood in shock for a little while, before actually moving towards the kitchen, hardening his face. <br/>
<br/>
“About time. Now, we didn’t bother buying you a ticket. You need to learn responsibility, so you will buy your own—“ Vernon said. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">His sister cut him off, “And no funny business, you better get the right ticket at the right place for the right time. Paddington station eleven o’clock, on the dot, you should arrive sometime in the afternoon. Your uniform and equipment shall be given to you when you arrive at school.” <br/>
<br/>
He was handed another pack of money, and at that moment he had never even breathed the same air that that much money had been stored in. </p><p align="left">“We expect to hear only good things, Potter. Goodbye, now.” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="left">With nothing more to be said or done, he was ushered out of his home of thirteen years. And forced onto the streets, completely and utterly on his own. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
