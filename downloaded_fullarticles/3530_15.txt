  <u> <strong>The Meeting</strong> </u>
</p><p> </p><p>Remus was sitting on the first step of the main staircase, breathing deeply. He had just been let out of the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey had tried to persuade him, but he had insisted, "It's the Christmas Holidays", he'd protested, "I can't just sit in the hospital wing the entire time!"</p><p>If he could get back before morning, he wouldn’t even have to answer any awkward questions, or come up with any excuses. James, Sirius and Peter already knew of course, but other people could be surprisingly nosey. He was beginning to regret his decision now, as he looked up at the mess of winding staircases leading up to his dormitory. He had just stood up, dragging his hand across his hair for a moment, and began to make his way upstairs, when he heard voices. He hesitated for a moment. Curiosity drove him on, and he began to follow the noises. It was clearly a reasonably a large group of people, judging by the footsteps, possibly as many as ten, which was surprisingly large for any secret night outing. He debated for a moment he really could be asked to deal with a bunch of rule breakers, It was the Christmas holidays…but Dumbledore had made him a prefect…and he was curious anyway. And with that he made up his mind, he stepped out. And then stopped in surprise.</p><p>There were a fair few people standing in the corridor, but what made Remus stop was the fact that they were all from different houses, and all different ages. Everyone Remus recognised, he knew were Half-bloods or else suspected to be muggleborn. They looked at Remus slightly warily. Remus looked at them</p><p>“So”, he said, raising his eyebrow, “What’s happening here?”<br/> There was a pause. A tall Hufflepuff 6th year girl suddenly broke the silence.</p><p>“Oh you know,” she said breezily, “Just wandering about an abandoned corridor at midnight, it’s a free country”, she finished with a smile.</p><p>Remus stared at her for a moment, feeling slightly miffed. It was a perfectly reasonable question, he thought irritably.</p><p>A Ravenclaw boy with long tousled blond hair rolled his eyes. “Smooth Claire, smooth”, he said sarcastically. He looked at Remus, slightly disdainfully, before answering. “Well, if you really wanted to know, we’re heading for the nearest muggle town, it’s a bit of a tradition to be honest.”</p><p>Remus turned the information round in his head. It was odd to aim for a muggle town, usually if a student was sneaking out they aimed for Hogsmeade, or The Forbidden Forest if they felt daring.</p><p>A Gryffindor 4th year wearing a leather jacket smiled at Remus with familiarity. “You’re Remus right?” she asked, interestedly, “well, really, you have a muggle parent, right? You fancy joining us? We’ll be back some point tomorrow, and you won’t get into any trouble, honest, and it’s the holidays, so no one minds much what we get up to!” She finished grinning. The other students looked at each other, a few seemed to have a silent conversation, but by the end they seemed willing to let Remus tag along.</p><p>This was an unexpected turn for the evening. Remus couldn't help but feel a small bubble of pride at being invited along, and well, it wasn’t as if there were many other opportunities presenting themselves at that moment.<br/> “Well,” he said, feeling slightly bewildered, “you know, sure, why not.” He grinned awkwardly.</p><p>“Well, I guess that’s settled then.” Said the first Hufflepuff girl, apparently-Claire, “Come on then. It’s a bit of a trek to get there, but it’s worth it!”</p>
