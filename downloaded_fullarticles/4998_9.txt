</p><p>Minerva never felt so out of place in her entire life. Her owl arrived shortly after her eleventh birthday, and but for a whirlwind day trip to a strangely quiet alley and wand shop in the otherwise noisy and sooty London, she’d had no contact with the wizarding world. The young wandmaker had peered at her as if she were a specimen, but the golden sparks that flew from the wand he’d given her spread a warmth through her chest and the smile stuck on her face for hours. Her other friends were back at school together in the village which was not so far off from these wild highlands, but she now felt as if they belonged to another world.</p><p>The line of horseless carriages wheeled into the underground courtyard and she cautiously stepped down, letting herself be swept up in the murmuring crowd of other anxious students her own age. An elderly man stepped through the door and unnecessarily spread his hands for silence. The countless wrinkles around his eyes did not smile with the rest of his face, and he touched a smooth worn supple wand of an ashy wood to his throat before speaking. His voice was strong and his welcome came from his throat as if he had said it countless times before.</p><p>“Welcome, first years, to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am your headmaster, Professor Armando Dippet. Congratulations on your admittance to this fine and proud institution. These ancient halls have produced the finest minds of the last several centuries, and I have no doubt you will strive to be counted among them.</p><p>“Tonight you will take part in one of the most important ceremonies you will ever experience. The sorting hat will determine your place and housemates for the next seven years of your life, and establish for you a community which will last far beyond your time here and into your professional life. When you enter the Great Hall please remain in a single line and stand against the far wall. When you are summoned to be sorted, sit atop the stool and refrain from any unnecessary questions. The Sorting Hat will take care of the rest. After you have been sorted you may sit with at your house table with your new friends. Thank you, and again--welcome.” Dippet’s wand flicked down from his throat and disappeared from view as he disappeared back through the door.</p><p>Several older students with shining badges came through and began motioning the students to form a queue as they entered the school. One of them, a curly-haired girl walked beside her and lead her through the high vaulted hallway.</p><p>“I’m Pomona Sprout, one of the prefects in Hufflepuff." She smiled kindly down at Minerva. "What’s your name?”</p><p>“I’m Minerva McGonagall. I think my mother was in Gryffindor.” Minerva pushed up her thick glasses and met the other girl's green eyes with a small smile.</p><p>Pomona grinned. “Gryffindor’s a good house, too. They’re all interesting if you ask me. Do you come from a wizarding family?” They entered the Great Hall.</p><p>“No, Mam’s a witch—none of us knew until my owl arrived last year.” Minerva was motioned to line up against the wall with the other first years.</p><p>“Oh, my! Well, I’m sure you’ll have plenty of questions. You can find me after classes at the greenhouses if you’d ever like to chat. I’m to go sit with my house, now. Don’t be anxious, I’m sure the Sorting Hat will know just where to put you.” With a smile and a light shoulder squeeze, Pomona was gone before Minerva could say that she wasn’t anxious, nor sure what to be anxious about.</p><p>A middle-aged wizard with bright lime robes was propped against a podium on the dais near the front of the hall, and he read off the first student’s name with a clear voice that carried across the room of chattering, giggling students.</p><p>“BOTT, BERTRAM!”</p><p>The boy walked towards the dais looking back every few meters before shakily perching on the stool. The wizard rather unceremoniously dropped a wrinkled pointy hat over the student’s eyes, and Minerva saw the boy’s fingers tighten involuntarily on his jacket hem. To her shock, the hat ripped open and a voice rang out from the tear.<br/>
</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p>The boy slid off the stool and stepped uncertainly towards the table of applauding students in yellow. The wizard in the lime green robes called another name, the student sat down on the stool, the hat called out another word, and the ceremony continued in this fashion.</p><p>“LONGBOTTOM, FRANCIS!” Minerva smiled as a sandy-haired round boy made his way up the dais and awkwardly sat as he was pronounced to be a Gryffindor. He beamed as he made his way down the steps, enthusiastically returning the offered high fives from his new housemates.</p>
<hr/><p>“Mam, will I have friends at school?”</p><p>Isobel McGonagall looked down into her daughter’s deep green eyes. She hadn’t spoken to her housemates in nigh on a decade, but lately she’d begun to wish to have them nearby. They’d been like sisters, the five of them. Nights spent in Gryffindor tower singing and writing and practicing charms. If her daughter was placed in Ravenclaw as she suspected, Isobel had little wisdom to offer.</p><p>“My darling, I’m sure you’ll find others just like yourself.” She leaned down to grasp her daughter’s hands. “Just remember to be yourself.” She winced at her own saccharine attempt at reassurance. “I mean. . . don’t hold yourself back, Minnie.” Her daughter’s eyes gazed back at her solemnly. “There will be people who are scared of girls as smart as you, and they may bully you or be cruel. There are other people who will want to be your friend because they think to take advantage of your intelligence and willingness to share. Don’t be afraid to be as smart and as gentle as you are with your friends here.”</p><p>“I won’t, Mam. I won’t be afraid—I’ll be brave.” The emerald eyes looked down in thought and Minerva chewed thoughtfully on a nail as she pondered her mother’s advice.</p><p>Isobel began to wonder if her daughter was as blue as she suspected.</p>
<hr/><p>“MCGONAGALL, MINERVA!”</p><p>The wizard in lime green robes searched the line for the next student and Minerva stepped forward. As she strode to the stage she caught the eye of the wizard and felt curiosity in his returned gaze. She ascended the steps and steadily took her place on the stool. Her last sight before the hat closed over her eyes was the bright smile of Pomona amidst the sea of black robes, and she found a calm reassurance in returning it.</p><p>“Oh, my… we’ve had students like you before, but never quite like you.” The voice felt as if it was directly behind her, but Minerva felt no breath or air moving.</p><p>“Can I be with my friend?”</p><p>“Oh, no. My dear, your mind it’s… lovely. So sharp... You see things as they can be, not as they are. That’s quite a rare skill, you know. You have the will to make it so, too. Even rarer.” The voice crooned seductively.</p><p>“Yes, I know. Mam’s told me that before. But I’d rather be with my friend. She’s been quite nice to me, and school can be very scary, you know.”</p><p>“Scary? Yes, I suppose it is. Dear child, you have a surprising amount of gumption for one as small as you.”</p><p>Minerva scoffed indignantly. “Why does my size matter? I can do just as much as anyone else here!” The voice somehow managed to produce an amused huff of air despite its lack of lungs.</p><p>“I see that. Very well, then. Better be… GRYFFINDOR!” The voice rang out across the hall and the Minerva winced as the light flooded her eyes. She felt a gentle hand at the small of her back and a very human breath on her shoulder as the man behind her leaned over and whispered, “Congratulations, Minerva. You’d best go join your new housemates, now. I’ll see you in class soon.” She slid off the stool and walked towards the table of students cheering the loudest and waving wildly. Only after finding an empty seat did she remember to search for her friend. Pomona locked eyes with her across the Great Hall and returned a friendly wave.</p><p>“SELWYN, AUGUSTA!” A tall wiry girl clambered up the stool and a knowing smile spread across her narrow face as she was placed in “RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>One of the last students to be sorted was a girl whose pink sweater peaked out underneath the black Hogwarts robes. The hat touched her braids and shrieked “SLYTHERIN” as she strode directly to the table, a self-assured smirk sliding across her face.</p>
<hr/><p> Once in the house common room, Minerva began to feel at ease. The dark reds and burnished golds of the furniture felt like her mother’s room at home, and the lion motif called to mind a brooch that was often lost in the folds of Isobel’s shawls and scarves. She climbed the steep stairway to the girl’s dormitory with five other girls to find trunks placed at the foot of each bed. Her bed was nearest the window through fluttered a sweet night breeze. Minerva stretched out on the bare sheets and looked around at her new housemates. A girl with dark unruly hair and glasses sat on the bed next to Minerva’s, her legs swinging across the divide between the beds.</p><p>“I’m Euphemia Kapur. You’re Minerva? I saw you with the sorting hat. Such a long time to sort you, other people seemed surprised. Were you surprised?" The girl spoke with a light East Anglian accent and her hair moved wildly as she spoke. "Do you ever get called Minnie? Can I call you Minnie? I shan’t if you don’t like, but I think it’s such a friendly sounding name.” She smiled openly, revealing crooked teeth. Minerva found herself smiling back.</p><p>“Me Mam calls me Minnie sometimes. You can too, I guess. My friends at home call me anything they want to as long as it’s nice.” She found herself sorting through the questions and picking out the easiest ones to answer.</p><p>“I shall call you Minnie, then. If you change your mind just tell me and I’ll stop. I know I talk a lot but I’m a really good listener, too. You can call me Mia.” The dark eyes behind the glasses were playful and energetic.</p><p>“Mia.” She tried out the name on her tongue. “It’s very nice to meet you. Aren’t you tired? I’m beat.” Minerva could feel her small body begin to droop, but Mia giggled and bounced on her mattress.</p><p>“No! I’m so excited I couldn’t possibly sleep. Do you want to go explore?” Mia's eyebrows wiggled in a conspiratorial manner. Minerva let the question hang in the air for several seconds before responding in a meaning-laden tone.</p><p>“I think I’m too tired to explore right now. Perhaps you’d like to take a walk together after classes tomorrow instead?”</p><p>Mia’s face fell. “I suppose that’s prudent. I just… my parents told me so much about this school and I want to see it all as soon as I can. They said there’s secret passageways and forbidden books in the library and thousands of pictures that will tell you all about the place if you ask them nicely. And ghosts. I’ve never met a ghost.” She laughed with good-natured surprise as she saw Minerva’s eyes grow three times larger. “Oh, they’re all quite harmless. The worst the Bloody Baron can do is give you the shivers.”</p><p>"The who?"</p><p>Mia laughed with glee. "Oh, this <em>will</em> be fun!"</p>
