    <p>
  <span>Sirius sighed, tipping his head back in the ‘Head Boy’ chair that James would kick him out of immently when he stopped awkwardly flirting with Lily. If Remus was there they could’ve been laughing over his frequent blush and pointing out what it was in Lily’s body language that gave away how much she actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked</span>
  </em>
  <span> James now they’d gotten to know each other better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You ready, Padfoot?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius smiled, already shifting out of the chair to the bench behind. “‘Course, was waiting for you two to stop flirting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How considerate of you, Sirius.” Lily said graciously. “No mirror today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not today. Dumbles has confiscated it until Pete can stop blurting out about ‘you-know-what’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If we don’t get it back soon, we’ll just find a way to knick it back. At least for whilst we’re broadcasting.” Sirius put in, meeting James’ excited grin with one of his own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right! Ready? 3, 2, 1...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They all raised their wands, speaking almost in unison.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>“Sonorus.”</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello everyone and welcome back!” James’ voice rang out clear, Sirius had mentioned to him once or twice how the show seemed to be helping with the groups’ confidence, especially Remus’. “I’m James Potter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Sirius Black.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I’m Lily Evans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Before we start properly, where’s Pete?” James looked pointedly at the door as if expecting it to open with perfect comedic timing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius leaned forwards to rest his chin and crossed arms on the back of James’ chair. “No idea, mate. Thought he was with you still.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remus said Peter was on a date earlier, that’s why he skipped breakfast, is he still with her?” Lily suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A date?” Sirius exclaimed at the same time James clapped his hands together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah go him! Go you, wormtail, wherever you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which unfortunate soul is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Someone from Hufflepuff I think; that’s all Remus mentioned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where is Moony? I thought he said he’d be here too? And clearly he’s not on a date too seeing as you’re here, Padfoot.” Even Lily smiled conspiratorially at that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.” Sirius muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James’ face contorted in a confused frown. “You don’t actually think-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Merlin, no!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, he’d never. He’s gonna be pissed you even said that, Prongs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah no, he loves me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Makes one of us.” Lily smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t help cheering in response. “Yes! High five, Lily!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You guys suck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up! Don’t wanna hear it! Stop laughing, both of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry Prongs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was at least a minute before Sirius had himself under control and by that point Lily was bringing them back to the main concern at hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So we have no clue where Remus is? Should one of us go and look for him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh...uh...nah, I’m sure he’s fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You sure, Sirius? We’ve got the ma- we could, you know, just</span>
  <em>
    <span> look </span>
  </em>
  <span>for him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Subtle, James.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have no idea what you mean, Lily!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Leave him be.” He rolled his eyes as the sort-of-couple shared a worried look before turning to face him, physically twisting themselves round in their chairs to stare into his soul.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay? Has something happened with you two?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed, shaking his head. “Leave it, Prongs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright. So, Lily! Here’s a question for you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought we’d moved past the interview stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Never, far too much fun.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, here we go. Out of the five of us-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily cut in quick, aiming the question more at Sirius as they both knew James would just steamroll by. “Five of us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You, me, James, Moony and Wormtail.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James rolled his eyes and started again. “Out of the five of us, which houses do you think we’d be in if not Gryffindor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s-...Actually not as bad a question as I was expecting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Way to have confidence in us, Lils.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To be fair to her, we don’t have the best track record.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Sirius.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James scoffed. “Start with Remus, seeing as he’s not here when he should be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ravenclaw.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And your reason why.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, Remus is always going on at you guys about doing your work-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not that we really need to.” James preened smugly, only cowing slightly when Lily hit his arm closest to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-and he’s probably the wittiest out of all of you. He takes his education seriously. He’s smart and values that highly, he values wisdom and is pretty wise himself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Moony.” Sirius sat up, back ram-rod straight as he looked the boy in the doorway over for anything out of place but there were no new bandages save the ones he’d turned up with that morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Remus is- oh. Hi.” Lily blushed a little as she realised who had just walked into the room, giving a little wave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus’ brow furrowed a little as he smiled back at her, seeming to be deliberately ignoring Sirius’ attempts to catch his eye but he did slide onto the bench next to him. Their shoulders knocked together briefly, a small reassurance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Charm, Moony.” James said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>Sonorous</b>
  <span>. Thanks Lily, that was sweet.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius glanced over to see James’ eyes flicking between the two before settling back on Remus. “Where’ve you been?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Out and about, had to pick some stuff up from Pomfrey and was stopped on my way back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You alright? By who? It wasn’t Snivellus was it?” Sirius did another look over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m fine.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who was it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was just McGonagall, alright Padfoot?” Remus hissed under his breath, Sirius nodded and tried to keep his surprise off his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okaay...Lily! Who’s next?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Oh, Peter would be in Hufflepuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus leaned forwards. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No need to sound so shocked.” James laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s very loyal to you guys, if a little…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cowardly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sirius!” Remus slapped his leg.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. He’s a little too trusting but he’s loyal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James seemed to consider it for a second before nodding. “Seconded.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thirded.” Remus said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fourthed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do Sirius next.” James poked him in the arm as he spoke, clearly trying his damned best to clear any tension in the room; Sirius couldn’t help wondering what on earth he’d done to deserve such a best friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t.” He made a dramatic gagging sound, earning a snort from James and an exasperated smile from Lily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think Remus would jinx me if I tried.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn right, right Moony?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mhmm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, thanks.” Sirius teased, nudging his shoulder against Remus who’d been pulling at the bandages on his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No problem.” Remus said quietly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to take this as my cue to draw all attention away from the back bench. Go on then, Lils.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sirius...hmm…” Lily tapped her fingers on her leg.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius took the opportunity to turn and sit sideways on the bench to whisper as quietly as possible despite the charm. “Remus…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, Sirius.” Was the only response, whispered before he’d even come up with how best to phrase his question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d say Hufflepuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” James cried. It was possible he was speaking louder to cover his and Remus’ conversation in which case he owed the man a butterbeer. And Lily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I stand by my choice. He’s loyal to a fault and values your guys’ loyalty too much to not be. He doesn’t really care about academia like Remus and he’s not particularly ambitious or driven by power.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re not fine. I’m not blind, Moony.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sirius, drop it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why won’t you talk to me about last night? What’s so different? What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good answer, Lily! Me next!” James was definitely speaking louder than necessary if Remus’ flinch was anything to go by.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d say the same. Though I can’t really see you in any house but Gryffindor though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop it Sirius.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Please.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Remus. I can’t just-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that everyone? I thin-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leave it well enough alone!” Remus’ voice burst out, startling them all as he pushed himself to his feet as best he could between the bench and Lily’s chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius stood up at the same time as Lily, she beat him to the punch. “Remus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait! Shit, don’t go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>Quietus</b>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let go of me, Prongs.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let him go, mate. He needs to calm down and so do you.” James reasoned sternly, keeping his fingers locked around Sirius’ wrist despite his tugging.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should I go and check?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. See, he’ll be fine. Lily’ll check he gets back to the room safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine.” Sirius deflated into the chair Lily vacated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>Quietus.</b>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the hell was that about, mate?” James asked after the door clicked shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow. With that tone of voice, I definitely believe you. Oh, stop glaring!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He started fiddling with the cuff of his sleeve just for an excuse not to look at James. “What house did Lily put me in? I wasn’t listening.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Smooth.” Came the sour reply. “She said hufflepuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she said you didn’t fit any of the others. Definitely not Slytherin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That makes one of us.” He muttered under his breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing, what did she say for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Same.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled. “She knows we can never be separated then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Best friends for life, mate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>Sonorus</b>
  <span>. Sirius, go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Always nice talking to you, Evans. You have such a way with words.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James kicked him. “Just go, Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bossy. </span>
  <b>Quietus</b>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Moony okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be fine. They will be too. Once they get their heads out their asses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, Lils! We’ve influenced you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, no, you haven’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m so proud of us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve corrupted you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you’re proud of yourselves?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re incredible.”</span>
