    <p>Harry Potter was a strange boy. <strike>He was a boy with female body parts</strike> – ah, sorry guys, wrong fuckfiction 😉 (for now – bye, you Eskimos; to shorten it I will be using an acronym BYE. BYE.)</p><p>So all over again:</p><p>Harry Potter was a strange boy – even for a lizard. I am not going to describe how and how much – I think you will notice it on your own.</p><p>Harry was sitting in a dungeon, attending a Potions lesson. And Potions lessons meant only one thing – unbearable pain. It wasn’t that Harry hated the cellar room or the cellar bat – it was just the opposite. Anybody with a bit of brain loved professor Snape. And his very big muscles. And his beautiful yellowish skin. And his <strike>silk</strike> <strike>velvet </strike>polyester voice. And Harry – even if it didn’t look like it – , even Harry had a bit of brain – granted, it was very very little thing seen only with a scanning electron microscope, but it was there.</p><p>The pain was caused by the cruel reality. Harry could try a try to attract attention (and undying love) of professor Snape – or rather how Harry was calling him in his thoughts, batty Sevy – how he wanted, but the professor was so strong that he resisted Harry’s personal charm. At the beginning of this lesson, Harry was so desperate that he started blowing raspberries and flambéing them in the cauldron. When he offered professor the most luscious raspberry, Snape just ordered him to – you know.</p><p>At first, Harry lit up as a Christmas tree, because even though little Sevy wanted to go faster in their relationship than Harry expected, it was quite romantic love confession. However, how big was his disappointment when Sevykins started shouting and stopped him before Harry could do more than strip off his trousers.</p><p>Now, Harry was just sitting and staring at the beautiful man and his glittering hair.</p><p>
  <em>How can anybody be so fucking gorgeous? It is as though he wasn’t from this planet. His parents must have been definite-</em>
</p><p>The whole world turned upside down (and threw away everyone who didn’t hold firmly).</p><p>How is it possible that he didn’t figure it out sooner?</p><p>The ethereal beauty, the unrelenting attraction, which Harry felt only for the ones of his kind…</p><p>It was all crystal clear. And it explained everything. But now he had to make Severus see it too.</p><p>***</p><p>‘What. Do. You. Want. Again. Potter! I am interested in no raspberries, blueberries, oranges, bananas and other fruit.’</p><p>Harry wanted to go slowly, but the mention of no bananas unsettled him, so he shoved Severus with his hand, which he had knocked on his door with, inside, ran in hurriedly after him and slammed the door shut.</p><p>‘I need-’ panted Harry, but Snape interrupted.</p><p>‘The only thing you need is transplantation of brain, you imbecile. I had always thought you are same as your father. But I was wrong.’</p><p>‘Oh, so you love me too?!’</p><p>Snape continued with disgusted voice, shuddering visibly. ‘In fact, you are hundred time worse than your father. I don’t know what you are playing at – but if you think I have so little self-restraint and throw my arms around you when I see the splendid flambéing in your cauldron, you are mistaken! And now you storm into my room as though it was your room to storm into!’</p><p>‘Sev-,’ Harry tried to defend himself weakly, but Snape ignored him and continued.</p><p>‘You blackhaired brat. You are worse than chips without fish.’</p><p> ‘Sev-,’</p><p>‘Worse than Asylum the film company. Worse than D&amp;D Star Wars films.’</p><p>This horrible comparison gave Harry strength to speak in capital letters. ‘I AM YOUR FATHER!’</p><p>Snape only stared at him, so Harry tried to explain it quickly. ‘It hit me, when I realised that you must have extraordinary parents – when you are such a beauty – who passed the high-quality genes on you. And who else has more first-rate material other than Harry Potter and Vernon Dursley?’</p><p>Batty Sevy flinched so violently that a glass with eel eyes dropped. Or better – a glass with eel eyes would have dropped if this had happened before arrival of the new headmaster. Believe or not – the new headmaster was fond of sweet things perhaps even more than Albus the Acid Pops Master, so instead of eel eyes it was only the muggle jelly-like edible eyeballs and one or two pairs of also edible, but not so jelly-like, maybe rather Gryffindorstudent-like ones which nested in Severus’ hair and made artwork more beautiful than even Jon Snow’s curls. </p><p>‘Well, err, I knew that it would be a shock for you to know you share genes with somebody so awesome as me, so I said, to make it easier, that I am your father. Strictly speaking I am your mother.’ (Yeah, I was pulling your leg with the crossing the female organs – what would Harry Potter fuckfiction be without MPREG? And please don’t ask if I am five years old that I can think that boys have children: when the mother of Kit Harrington did the impossible and taught him how to speak (even if it’s only ten words), why couldn’t be males pregnant?)</p><p>‘Vernon is your father. But he doesn’t know it yet. In fact, we didn’t know we have a child. Yes, I gained weight during holidays, but I thought it is because of the sweets our headmaster sends me – and when I pooped something badly wrinkled, we thought it was just a tapeworm. But in fact, it was you! Can you believe it, Sevikins, my little son? We flushed you away – and yet you are here. Do you remember your daddy?’</p><p>Severus had been standing shocked for a while now. Everything fitted. It was so logical. It explained everything. The reason why he is so brilliant, handsome, why his hair seems to never grease (thanks, citrus toilet cleaner!), why he tends to have a tea party with Moaning Myrtle in the pipes…</p><p>However, one thing didn’t seem right. ‘Vernon? Isn’t Vernon Dursley your uncle? You were incesting and made me?!’</p><p>‘We aren’t blood-related. But it isn’t important for now, is it? What is important is that we found each other. Come to daddy.’</p><p>And Severus came. He sprinted to Harry and gripped his leg like a little child. ‘Dad, I am so glad I’ve found you. I’d missed hard and strict hand of a father my whole life, that’s why I am so bitter. Every time I failed an exam I had nobody t-to spank m-m-me. And now I finally do.’</p><p>In a moment, both of them, the father/mother and the son, were crying. ‘And I am not even born of incest!’ shouted Severus happily.</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. ‘Dunno, why it should bother you. Your half-brother is incesty. I hope it doesn’t mean you will look down on him for it!’</p><p>‘I have a brother?!’</p><p>‘Yeah, his name is Dudley. Although I don’t know, if I can call him your half-brother. Hmm, how is called the relationship when your mother is father of your brother? Well… never mind, he is your brother, and his mother is my aunt Petunia. Dudley is our golden boy.’</p><p>Before describing what happened after, I beg you all to stop before you judge (if I were a good writer, I would make the discourse-time longer, but I am obviously not a good writer, so I have to say it clearly) and please understand that Severus found out only a couple of minutes ago his whole life was a lie. He wasn’t born of unfulfilled love of a snake and a kettle, how he thought, but quite literally from Harry Potter (‘s hole). And his father’s been loving a son and caring for him for a long time. And Severus isn’t that son. Not at all.</p><p>Severus stiffly broke free from his father’s trouser leg, ignored his suggestion to compare their pics and apps, lifted and flicked his wand and transfigurated Harry into young snake. However, it brought only bad memories.</p><p>Longbottom’s long bottom wasn’t any better.</p><p>A few hundred transformations later, Severus took a short break and glanced around his room. It was in ruins – the reason for this the ill-conceived transfiguration of his fathermother in a blue whale cock. And still Severus couldn’t remember the information he had read some time ago in the handbook “What to do if one (or two) of your parents turns out to be Harry Potter” about what to transform Potter into.</p><p>At that moment, an owl flew through his closed window – which Severus naturally has, even though he lives three kilometres under the ground – and carried a message with headmaster’s handwriting.</p><p>And Severus suddenly knew what to do with Potter.</p><p>***</p><p>AAAAH, this is the end of chapter one. BYE (meaning bye, you Eskimos). Yeah, with use like that it would be shorter just write it whole, but it is too difficult for me to understand something complicated like this.</p><p>And sorry for insufficiently few clever author notes in the text, maybe more next time, I had to lay back down into my cradle. BYE.</p>
