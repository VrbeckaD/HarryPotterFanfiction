    <p>The door slammed behind me, hard enough to knock dirt down from the stairs overhead, and I could hear the bolts drawn across to lock it. I was trapped in my cramped, dirty little cupboard again. I smiled as I lay down onto my lumpy mattress, sighing with relief. <em>Finally</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Being locked in my cupboard was supposed to be a punishment. It really was pretty uncomfortable – not a lot of room in here, and they usually didn't feed me either. But when I was locked up, the Dursleys liked to pretend I didn't exist. Dudley didn't bully me, Uncle Vernon didn't shout at me, Aunt Petunia didn't bother me. It was a quiet, cool, dark place, where I could lie on my blanket and think. I'd learned to hide food away, and I'd gotten used to the spiders years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I'd started acting out, just enough that they'd send me in here. I was being careful – I didn't want them to think I liked it, so I begged and begged, and it seemed to make Uncle Vernon do it more often.<br/>
<br/>
I reached up and pulled the old shoelace that turned on my one bare lightbulb. Then I took the stolen book from the little pouch in my backpack no one else knew about, and started to read.<br/>
<br/>
It still felt bad to steal books. I used to borrow them from the school library all the time. But Dudley didn't like it, and one day, he took one of my books and ruined it, tore the cover off and threw the pages in the mud. Aunt Petunia wouldn't pay the fine – she blamed me, said I was a delinquent, a vandal, a nasty young boy. So now I was banned from borrowing books. I stole them instead. I had been for three months now. I was good at it – at not being seen, at hiding then, at only reading when I was locked in the cupboard or hidden away outside. But I didn't like being the delinquent that my aunt and uncle always said I was.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had a good reason. I was being abused, I'd read enough by now to know that. That didn't mean I could do whatever I wanted – I'd read more than enough books with villains who thought so to ever believe it myself. But what happened wasn't my fault. I ought to still be able to borrow books, if Dudley hadn't destroyed mine and Aunt Petunia hadn't lied and then refused to pay the fine. I always made sure to return the books on time, just as if I'd borrowed them – I read quickly, so that wasn't hard, but still, I did it. And my books were the only thing I had to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
So I felt guilty about it, but I did it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Books let me escape, let me get away from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia and Dudley and into wonderful, magical worlds, where the good guys always won and your parents always loved you and the bullies always got shown up in the end. Best of all was, when I was reading a book, I wasn't Harry Potter any more. And that was what everyone wanted, wasn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Today I was reading <em>The Hobbit</em>, a nice big fantasy book, with dwarves and dragons and wizards and <em>magic</em>. I sure didn't get any of that out here in the real world – the Dursleys hated even the <em>word</em> magic. They wouldn't even let me watch <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. They thought it made them look normal, that they would have nothing to do with magic, but I hadn't the heart to tell them that most people didn't cry out in fear of children's stories.<br/>
<br/>
That, more than anything else, made me wonder if there really was magic in the world after all – there had to be <em>some</em>reason the Dursleys cared so much. But, honestly, I doubted it. <em>If only I really were so lucky.</em><br/>
<br/>
Besides, it'd be hard to top <em>The Hobbit</em> for a good magical world. I just couldn't get enough of it – I was definitely going to steal <em>Lord of the Rings</em> next. I sank back into the book, into Bilbo's riddle game, his escape from Gollum, his new invisibility ring, and finally his return to his companions.<br/>
<br/>
<em>"What did I tell you?" said Gandalf laughing. "Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess."</em><br/>
<br/>
I had always liked Gandalf – actually, I almost imagined I'd met him somewhere. I had a very fixed image of him in my mind, with long hair and a long beard and neat little half-circle glasses. The only thing that didn't quite fit was the outfit – in the story, he wore grey, but I couldn't help but imagine him wearing bright, mismatched, sparkling, utterly flamboyant robes.<br/>
<br/>
Then I heard a noise.<br/>
<br/>
High and piercing, like a tea kettle. Quiet at first, but it got louder and louder, accompanied by a searingly bright light, right here under my stairs, bright blue and flickering like a fire. My eyes darted to the door – would the Dursleys notice? Or had they done this themselves somehow? They couldn't, could they?<br/>
<br/>
I reached out and grabbed for the light, and it went out. I'd taken hold of a letter, thick and oddly folded. It took me a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the dark again, blinking and squinting, before I could read it.<br/>
<br/>
First, my eyes caught on the photograph paperclipped to the front. It was of a woman with green eyes like mine and a face like a softer, rounder version of Aunt Petunia's... along with a man who looked just like me, and a very young child in their arms.<br/>
<br/>
And then the photo <em>moved</em>, the people inside smiling and waving to me, and I gasped.<br/>
<br/>
What was this? Were these my parents? This couldn't be a prank – moving photos weren't a <em>thing</em>, were they?<br/>
<br/>
Carefully, I unclipped the photo and started reading the letter beneath.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Dearest son,</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Your name is Harry Potter. You are a wizard, and you are a half-blood. If any of this surprises you, keep reading. This is not a fake or a forgery, and it was not sent to you by accident.</em><br/>
<br/>
I sucked in a breath. Now I was starting to wonder if I was dreaming – if I'd fallen asleep, <em>The Hobbit</em> in my hands, and now I was dreaming of magic. It had happened before, but it never felt so real.<br/>
<br/>
<em>I am your father, James Potter. If you've received this letter, then I, your mother Lily, and your godfather Sirius Black are all dead, or may as well be. When we lived, we were soldiers in a war of wizards, and if you're reading this, then our side lost. This letter is to explain ourselves: who we were, why we died, and why you don't know about it. But I don't know exactly what happened to you – please open the tabs for the reactions you have.</em><br/>
<br/>
There was a war? That was pretty grim, certainly much grimmer than <em>The Hobbit</em>, but I had read some books like that. They had always been easy to get into for me – they felt familiar. If this letter was for real, then now I knew why.<br/>
<br/>
There were five little tabs there on the page – <em>I'm not a half-blood!</em>, <em>Wizards aren't real!</em>, <em>That's not my name!</em>, <em>My parents were bad guys!</em>, and <em>I already know all of this!</em> – with a little doodle of a grabbing hand pointing at them.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely didn't know all of this, so I wasn't going to open that tab. Harry Potter was my name, so I didn't want to open that tab either. I didn't think I was a half-blood on account of not knowing what that meant, and the Dursleys did always say my parents weren't good people. But there was only one thing here I <em>really</em> wanted to know. I grabbed the little tab marked <em>Wizards aren't real</em>, and yanked it open, revealing a whole long section.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Yes, we are real</em>, the letter said. <em>How else do you explain this letter just showing up? And you're one of us too. I'm sure you've noticed it by now, even though you're only nine, even if you don't know what it is. Strange things happen around you. You can do things you can't explain.</em><br/>
<br/>
I... I <em>did</em>. My hair growing back when Aunt Petunia cut it, finding myself somewhere too high to reach when Dudley chased after me, particularly awful clothes shrinking so much I couldn't fit into them any longer. I'd even started to use it on purpose a little – it helped me hide and sneak when I stole books. Was that really magic? <br/>
<br/>
<em>If you haven't heard of wizards, that means you've been raised by Muggles – people who don't have any magic. That's not what we planned for, but it's not totally surprising, if things went wrong. In the Muggle world, you won't know about the war. You won't know who Lord Voldemort is, the blood purist terrorist leader we fought, who very likely won. He's almost always called You-Know-Who, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, or the Dark Lord, or something else like that, to inflate his ego.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>He hates Muggles, like the ones you live with, wizards whose parents are Muggles, like your mother, and of course wizards who defied him, which include both of us – and unfortunately, because you are our child, very likely you. You should be safe with the Muggles for a little more than a year still – the Wizarding world doesn't seek out children living with Muggles until age 11. After that, though, you may be in trouble.</em><br/>
<br/>
I grimaced. The magical world sounded worse and worse the more I read. I was actually starting to wonder if Dudley and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia might not be the better option.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Here's what you can do about it.</em><br/>
<br/>
Below that was an arrow directing me to fold the tab back up. I did, and more of the letter had appeared.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Whichever path your life took, now you know: you might be in terrible danger. Hopefully, because you are a half-blood, they won't try to kill you immediately. But there's always a chance they will, and that means you need to be able to defend yourself.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>The problem is, there aren't many options to let an 11-year-old hold his own against fully-grown, fully-trained adult wizards. In fact, there's really only one – the Dark Arts. Powerful, very powerful, and I'm told it feels incredible to use, a euphoria like little else in magic. But it's also illegal, corrupting, dangerous, incredibly damaging to your health, and addictive. It is the signature magic of Lord Voldemort. Of our enemies. Your life will, if you decide to study it, forever be a struggle for control against your magic. If there were any other choice, any other option I could suggest that might work, I would do so. But there isn't. I'm sorry the Dark Arts to be your inheritance.</em><br/>
<br/>
I felt a scared little flutter in my chest as the genre of my life's story changed once more. I was to be the orphan secretly trained in the dangerous forbidden techniques I would need to survive. I'd read books like that, too. And those protagonists could be cool. They could do awesome things. But, somehow, they always seemed to end up like Dudley in the end. Even when they were still supposed to be the good guys, even when I was still supposed to be rooting for them, they got mean. Hurting people, being nasty and mean, talking down to people, being awful to wise old wizards who only wanted to help.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to be that kind of protagonist.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Your mother is scared, and so am I. If I had started learning the Dark Arts at age 9, I would have been a terror before I was 11. But Lily was always serious, even on her very first day of Hogwarts. She was never prone to cruelty or foolishness. She could have withstood learning the Dark Arts at your age. I hope you take after her more than me. And... if you're scared, like we are, about what you might become if you do this... know that it's a good sign. Promise me that if you go through with this, you'll listen to us, to your books, that you'll try to stay kind and understanding, to stay in control.</em><br/>
<br/>
Reading those words, I started to cry, the letter blurring with tears. "I... I'll try," I whispered. "I promise! I n-never want to be like Dudley. I don't w-w-want to be like..." My voice trailed off, as I thought of still more heroes – the ones who had touched evil powers, and lost to them. "I'll try my best," I said, my voice a quiet, scared whisper, "to keep control."<br/>
<br/>
It took me a little while before I could wipe my eyes and keep reading.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The first book I want you to read is called <u>What Makes A Dark Wizard: The Nurmengard Survey of 186 Captured Wizards In Grindelwald's Army</u>. It will explain, far better than I ever could, the risks you might take, the danger you might face. And then I want you to make your own decision. Know that, whether you choose to stop your research or to continue, we support you.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>The Survey is a very simple book. It just presents the facts: the lives of one hundred and eighty-six sad, depraved men who served a Dark Lord, expressed in statistics and charts but also in stories, the long and oftentimes sickening tales of how the most feared Dark Wizards of their time fell into Grindelwald's hands. I could have given you sermons, fiery condemnations of the Dark Arts. But I think, and many people agree with me, that this tiny little book is more sobering than any of them could ever be.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Whenever you're ready to start your studies, you can summon our family trunk. It's laced with old magic, made to follow the head of household whenever or wherever you may need it, made in a time when, at a moment's notice, a wizard may need to run. If only that time had ended. Simply place your hand over your heart, and speak the word retrove (reh-TROH-vuh) to summon it. The word verzende (vur-SEN-duh) will send it away once more, hiding it from anyone who might find it.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Good luck.</em><br/>
<br/>
The letter was signed <em>James Potter</em>, in flourishes and swoops that felt almost goofily overdone, and yet eerily familiar.<br/>
<br/>
I just stared at it for a few moments. Unable to process, unwilling to believe. But only for a moment, and then I put my hand over my heart and spoke the magic words. With a quiet <em>puff</em> and a flash of light, an old wooden chest appeared, painted ornately with dragons and wizards and a Potter family crest on the lid. My mattress sagged a little under its weight.<br/>
<br/>
My first spell. I felt distantly like I ought to be proud, like I ought to be screaming and clapping, ecstatic. But instead I just felt a pit in my stomach. I hoped I could do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then I opened the lid, took out the first book, and started to read.</p>
