    <p>“You can’t be serious,” Pansy breathes out in disbelief. “A divorce?”</p><p>Draco is in their cottage in Dublin. He is sitting in his favorite armchair, gaze unfocused on the fireplace (a muggle one, disconnected from the floo network because Harry liked the warmth it provides), a glass of bourbon in his hand and an almost empty bottle in the coffee table. He feels lonely, this doesn’t feel like home anymore. Not without Harry beside him. Snuggling together and taking about everything and anything, sharing soft caresses and sweet kisses. He remembers teaching Harry how to dance in this living room, fun nights with friends, movie nights, even making love in this same armchair, but none of that matters now.</p><p> “Yes,” Draco answers after some time, and then takes another gulp of his drink “He asked me to let him go. He wants to move on.” </p><p>At first, he couldn't even register what Harry said, he couldn't give them meaning because his husband asked him to meet on a restaurant and he was over the moon. He asked, for the first time since the accident and Draco was exited. He should have known better though, he has never had the best of luck. He froze for what seemed like an eternity and felt his heart breaking, but then he agreed, what else could he do? If Harry wanted to leave, he would do it one way or another. At least he didn’t disappear on him.   </p><p> “What do you mean?…how? Why?” she was in shock, they were so happy together. It was just so… “I thought that things were getting better that you’ve been working on your relationship, getting to know each other again and solving the memory problem.”</p><p> </p><p>And indeed, what a problem it was. The memory problem, the now constant presence looming over their marriage consuming and destroying them. It has been months since the accident, when Harry woke up in the hospital bruised and disoriented, with no memory of the last six years of his life - his<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>husband</em><span class="apple-converted-space"><em> </em></span>included.</p><p>This situation was ridiculous, he lost his husband because of a bloody snitch. They were playing Quidditch for hours when it started to pour, the snitch appeared and Harry that idiot Gryffindor went after it trying to pull a risky manoeuvre, and one of the new players somehow put himself in the way and Harry tried to avoid colliding with him and he slipped, lost control, and fell and hit his head. He didn’t wake up for 3 days, the worst 3 days of Draco’s life and when he finally did, he wasn’t his husband anymore, they were Potter and Malfoy.</p><p>Draco was so relieved to see those gorgeous green eyes again that he thought everything would be alright. The healers said he would get his memories back in a couple of days and they could continue their life. Well...it didn’t work out as plannned.</p><p> </p><p>His glass is empty, and he tries to reach for the bottle, but he misses. Pansy is there and she catches it before it falls and refills his glass.  “I thought so, too. But how do you react to the man you love telling you he doesn’t want anything to do with you. At least he tried, he doesn’t remember our good times, but our Hogwarts years are fresh in his mind. For all I know he could hate me, but he still tried…” he admits very quietly and a tear escapes from his eye. Malfoy’s don’t cry he thinks, and he feels foolish, but this is the only way he knows he can hold himself together.</p><p> “So… what’s going to happen now?” Pansy asks carefully, she only remembers Draco crying in front of her twice once when they were about four and he fell of a tree and the second after the trials when he didn’t go to Azkaban. He was the strongest person she knew, and he was breaking apart.</p><p>Draco’s quiet for a very long time. “I am moving back here, he will stay with the Weasleys” he is fighting down the bitterness that’s welling up in him. He is trying to reign his emotions and Pansy can see how much it costs him “He wants to try again,” he takes a deep breath to calm himself, but his voice still breaks a little “he wants to try again with <em>her</em>”</p><p> “What?” she can't believe it.</p><p>He swallows hard because his throat’s getting thick and his eyes are starting to prickle. But he won’t cry in front of her. <em>Malfoy’s don’t cry, Malfoy’s don’t cry, Malfoy’s don’t cry</em>he repeats like a mantra “Ginevra and Harry have reconnected, they are ‘<em>in love’</em>” Draco shrugs, looks to the ceiling and softly says. “It’s not fair. Why does he remembers being engaged to <em>her</em>years ago and can't remember me! I'm his husband! Why could he fall in love with her and not with me”</p><p> </p><p>He can feel Pansy staring at him, and he feels himself break, he starts crying and he cannot stop, it really is over. Pansy is there in a minute holding him close and letting him cry his eyes out, carding her fingers through his hair. “I am sorry love…” is the only thing she says.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And Draco can’t even be angry with Harry, that’s… that’s probably the worst thing. Because he can sense how distraught Harry is, how guilty he felt for hurting him even though he doesn’t remember loving him. Because that’s how Harry is. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But he has to accept that Harry doesn’t love him anymore, hell he is not sure Harry was even attracted to him, they kissed a couple times, but Harry always felt awkward and uncomfortable later, and the only time he tried to take things a little further Harry had jumped as if he had been burned by his touch.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He wondered if they were together now, that ginger she-Weasel draped around his <s>husband </s>ex-husband. The Weasley’s never completely accepted him after all, and after moving away they didn’t see them than often. Now they could have the happy marriage they’ve always wanted between the prodigal adopted son and their only daughter. There is nothing else to do, Harry doesn’t remember them being happy for the past 5 years, he doesn’t remember  their first date, first kiss, their lovemaking, the breakfast in bed, the lazy Sundays their anniversary, their wedding just 3 years before,  going house hunting, or helping Draco open his small potions store or coaching the neighborhood kids quidditch team, or opening his bakery or how they were taking about having kids, looking at adoption agancies just before the accident  and no matter how many photographs, pensive memories, love letters, muggle video tapes and many others mementos prove  their love, you can't fabricate feelings, and he can't keep fighting for Harry, not  if he doesn’t want Draco in his life. It would only hurt them more.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“But, Dray, are you giving up?” Pansy whispers in tears too, She can't believe it because it can't happen. Draco is back but not Harry, they are too people that against all odds are perfect together, and complement each other. Her best friend is losing his husband, but she is also losing a dear friend. Over the years she and Harry made peace with each other and <s>are</s>were close. Harry is leaving everyone behind, he doesn’t now it but they will all miss him “he’s your husband, he’s the love of your life!”</p><p>And now he finally looks at her, for the first time in the night and his eyes are empty, his face probably red and puffy and his voice’s hollow when he replies, “No. My husband fell of his broom and died, Pansy. This is Potter and he’s not mine anymore.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
