    <p align="center">Lily and James Potter never fought. Well, that is until the decision came to where their first born, Harry, would go to school. James, being from a pureblood family, wanted him to be home-schooled, as he had. James had been offered lessons from a kind woman from the Order who was already in the process of teaching her own kids. Her eldest would be starting in Hogwarts next year and her youngest was just a year younger than Harry. It was perfect. However, his wife had other plans.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“There’s nothing wrong with Muggle schools, James. It will be a good experience for him!”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">James couldn’t help but splutter his next words “A good experience for him? How will he make friends in Hogwarts if he doesn’t know the first thing about wizards?”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“I’m not saying we hide it from him since that would be ridiculous. But what do you think he needs to know? I didn’t know anything about the wizarding world before I went to Hogwarts and I recall a certain Professor Slughorn saying I was the ‘brightest witch of my age’”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“Of course he would, you were always sucking up to him.” At the sight of Lily’s face, James quickly changed the subject. “This is different, Lily. What if something happens? We can’t knowingly put Muggles at risk. Alice is sending little Neville off to that lovely woman. You know her, she’s Arthur’s wife. She made you that lovely carrot cake when she found out you were pregnant”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“You mean the one I barely sniffed before you had it swallowed down?” She gave James one of her looks. “Of course I remember, Molly is as much a sweetheart as she is formidable she’ll be a great teacher but the thing is, as much as I would love Neville and Harry growing up together, I have this worry that Harry won’t turn out to be magical. And then what? I don’t want him to think that the magical world is the only way to live. That will be worse if all his friends are wizards. I just don’t want him to think he’s missing out.” Lily looked away from James and he got the hint that she was trying to avoid eye contact. “We don’t know if he’ll take after you or me.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">James’ mouth fell open at her words. “Lily Jaqueline Evans-Potter” He stood up, ever dramatically and took her by the hand. “How dare you treat your heritage as something to be ashamed of? Just because your sister is practically an Acromantula. And how dare you think for one second that our children taking after you is in any way a bad thing? Might your dear husband remind you how many times you wiped the floor with him in Order training? You helped to rid the world of the most dangerous wizard there ever was. You are by far a better witch than most people could ever dream of and I am not just saying that because you’re such a suck up. You, of all people, should know that blood doesn’t matter.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Lily was grinning and giggling throughout his whole speech it was adorable and James hadn’t even noticed that he had wrapped her up in his long gangly arms. As he looked down on his beautiful wife, he saw a mischievous glint in her eye, a feature of hers that he had come to fear.</p><p align="center">“What?” He asked warily.</p><p align="center">“We”</p><p align="center">“We what?”</p><p align="center">Lily reached out to stroke James’ cheek. He very nearly swooned and it was a good thing he was holding on to her. “<em>We</em> helped beat the most dangerous wizard there ever was”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">James smiled and looked at his wife like she was the best thing that had ever happened to him. She was. “Right. Of course,” He said trying to speak around his very big smile. “We”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">They kissed and James felt the world melt away. He would never get tired of the way her lips brushed his, how her soft skin felt to his touch, how lightheaded she made him feel. He felt himself wishing the rest of the world didn’t exist, wishing he never had to stop kissing Lily Evans-Potter. Far too soon, they parted.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“Great! I’ll call the headmistress tomorrow.” Lily picked up Harry from where he was attacking his sleeping sister with the Acromantula teddy Hagrid had given him for his second birthday. He was ignorant of the scene behind him as if it happened all the time.</p><p align="center">“Lily Potter, you slippery Veela” James crossed his arms but his eyes said that he could never truly be mad at her.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Lily’s laugh rang out from the hallway. “Trust me, Jamie. This will be really good for him”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">And it was. The school Lily had chosen was newly opened after the war. It was run by a delightful woman by the name of Harriet Avery. She had come from a pureblood wizarding family and was the lead authority when it came to Squib relations. She wasn’t magical, but she was well aware of the needs of a young wizard to be. Both she and Lily had convinced James that this was a good idea. Something along the lines of “It’s important to let your child be aware that although the magical world is a fantastic place it isn’t the most important thing and that he will be loved whichever world he chooses to reside in. The best way to do that is by surrounding him with both nonmagical and magical people.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">James didn’t understand the psychology behind it but Mrs. Avery seemed to know what she was talking about, and he couldn’t ignore how much it meant to Lily.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“I think that’s a fantastic idea!” Sirius had said one summer night when they were sitting out the back garden. Lily was putting Harry to bed and James had wanted the opinion of his dear friend Padfoot. They sat on garden chairs with butterbeer and camaraderie that James had missed while in hiding.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“Prongs, you know my family history so I might not be the lead authority in muggle-wizard cooperation’s however isn’t this what we fought for? Giving our children and future children a choice to marry who they want and be friends with who they want and not have to worry about the politics behind it all. This will be good for Harry I think.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">James groaned “That’s exactly what Lily said. And Mrs. Avery”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Sirius laughed. His eyes sparkling as they always did. “Well, then it looks like you’re outnumbered old friend”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">And that was that. Harry was sent off to school at four years old. Lily had tears in her eyes when she put him in his uniform on the first day and she insisted on taking at least twenty photographs of Harry with his tiny school bag outside the house. James himself had wondered who had been chopping an excessive amount of onions nearby. Amelia giggled at the sight of her big brother having to endure a photo shoot, unaware that she would be doing the same thing in two years’ time.</p>
