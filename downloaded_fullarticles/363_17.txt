    <p>Sirius, Remus, Marlene, Dorcas, James and Lily were leaving the Three Broomsticks after getting a quick drink. Marlene was chatting animatedly to Sirius, and Dorcas and Remus were rolling their eyes fondly at their partners, James and Lily looking on amusedly. "Hey, James!" Sirius called excitedly, "Let's go into Zonko's!"<br/>
"Sure," James agreed.<br/>
"I'm going into Honeydukes," Marlene announced.<br/>
"I'l come," Dorcas called eagerly.<br/>
Remus smiled, "Me too," <br/>
"I'll join you," Lily walked over.<br/>
Sirius kissed Remus on the cheek, "Be back soon!"<br/>
James followed him and the others headed into Honeydukes.</p><p>Remus walked over to the sugar quills, "Might get a couple for Sirius. I'm sure he'd use them more than he uses a quill to write with."<br/>
Lily laughed, "I might get some for James as well."<br/>
"You should," Marlene said "Both of you should. They'd both love it."<br/>
"Yeah," said Lily.<br/>
"I will," Remus said.<br/>
"Hey, Marlene love!" Dorcas called "Which of these should I get?"<br/>
"Coming!" Marlene called back.<br/>
"They're so cute," Lily grinned.<br/>
"I know," Remus smiled.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Zonko's James &amp; Sirius were piling their arms full of prank supplies. "This is so cool!" James was bubbling over with excitement. "I know!" Sirius was in almost the same sate, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>In the common room that evening Remus was writing an essay with Sirius seated next to him. "Moony, I'm bored!" Sirius complained.<br/>
Remus sighed, "I'm doing my homework."<br/>
"But it's not due in till next week!"<br/>
"It makes sense to do it now, so I don't have to rush it next week."<br/>
"But I'm bored!"<br/>
"Go and bother James, or Marlene, cariad. Just until I've finished my essay."<br/>
Sirius kissed Remus on the shoulder, "Alright,"</p><p>Sirius wandered over to where Marlene was sitting with Dorcas' head in her lap. She was playing with Dorcas' hair, and Dorcas had a blissful smile on her face. They both looked completely at ease with the world. "Hey Sirius," Marlene waved.<br/>
"Hey Marls, Dorcas!" Sirius grinned at them, his troublemaker's grin which his Moony loved so much. <br/>
He sat down next to Marlene, "So, how's everything going?"<br/>
"Great, thanks," Marlene grinned at Sirius, and her grin was just as much of a troublemaker's grin as his was, and Dorcas loved it.<br/>
"Everything's good," Dorcas said, her voice muffled from her position in Marlene's lap.<br/>
Marlene nodded, "That's right babe, it is."<br/>
"How about you?" Marlene asked.<br/>
Sirius smiled, "Brilliant!"<br/>
"I'm glad," she said.</p><p>Lily was also doing her homework, and James was sitting behind her, kissing her neck. She liked it, but she wished he'd stop distracting her. "James," she said finally, turning around, "Go and join Sirius."<br/>
He kissed her shoulder, "Fine."<br/>
<br/>
James sat next to Sirius and lent into his shoulder slightly, "Hey."<br/>
"Hey," Sirius pulled James further into him and fell against Marlene.<br/>
"Hi," Marlene shoved Sirius off her.<br/>
"Hi," Dorcas said sleepily. <br/>
</p><p>That night in the boys' dormitory, Sirius climbed into Remus' bed as usual. They talked softly, kissing each other tenderly, delighting in the feeling of having someone else in your arms, having someone else hold you. "Time to sleep now, annwyl," Remus said at last, kissing his boyfriend's back. They slept curled around each other, embracing each other, protecting each other from the horrors that they had both experienced. </p>
