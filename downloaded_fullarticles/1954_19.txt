    <p>
  <span>Broomstick after broomstick whoosh through the air, red capes and green robes fluttering in the gusts of wind as the players slow down into a spiral descend towards the grass on the pitch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Red and gold, green and silver-- the players line back up, clutching their broomsticks with one hand, standing face to face and chest to chest with their equivalent player on the opposing team. The two boys at the very end stand particularly close. Black hair flying in every direction belonging to the boy donned in red intercepted with gold; blonde hair still somehow sitting perfectly atop the head of the boy in green robes, silver details reflective under the warm autumn sun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walk forwards until they’re peering close at each other, head to head, glaring at each other with undisguised rivalry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A boy with binoculars sitting in the stands watching frowns, squinting through the lens. “What in the world are they doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy sitting next to him dressed in the same robes in the colour of the reddening autumn leaves with the same gleaming black hair snorts rather unattractively. He is considerably smaller than his friend with the binoculars, who is both greater in height and remarkably more bulky, which his long, red robes do a poor job of hiding. The taller boy, who is still peering at the two rival players on the pitch in complete utter confusion, has his glossy black hair swept cleanly out of his face, exposing a pair of ears that stick out from his head on a peculiar angle. “Being stupid, that’s what.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if on cue, both boys on the pitch suddenly break out into loud giggles and guffaws, reaching over to clasp hands and pull each other into tight hugs. The other players on the field look on, amused smiles on their faces as they begin to disperse, leaving the pitch as the Quidditch trials come to an end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the two boys, one in red and one in green and quite equal in height, break apart just to link arms and head towards the spectator stands, their tall friend rises from his seat, lowering the binoculars from his big, round eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jongin!” he bellows, low, rough voice booming out, and his other three friends, all donned in similar robes and red scarves for the fall weather, immediately let their hands fly to their ears in an attempt to spare their hearing. “Sehun! Over here!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All four boys that had been sitting on the stands all rise to their feet from their seats, waiting for the two players to reach them, before erupting in cheers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Jongin!” a brunette with wavy, silky hair falling over his forehead grins wide, reaching over to pull the Gryffindor flyer in a quick hug from the side, eyes disappearing with the eruption of his smile. “Welcome to the team, Mister New Seeker!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jongin, the boy with the wild black hair that seems to have a mind of its own and the long cascading red cape, giggles in the other boy’s embrace. “Thanks, Baekhyun,” he smiles warmly, only to be given an eye roll from another boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks like you'll be mum’s favourite this month,” Jongdae huffs, only for Jongin to tackle him. And only then does Jongdae let his usual cheeky wide grin break out over his face, patting his brother on the back (with perhaps a little more force than necessary). Jongdae even has the exact same hair as Jongin, black strands that sit messily atop his head, some falling haphazardly over his forehead. It runs in the family, as does spectacular talent in magic does, too. “But really, good job making the team. And as Seeker, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Prodigy Seeker we've got here,” the tallest boy with a smile so wide it seems to catch all the rays of the sun joins in, and reaches forwards with a fist extended for a bump from Jongin’s gloved fist-- a gesture he was more than happy to teach his wizard friends. “Slytherin better watch out,” he adds, throwing the green-robed blonde next to Jongin a wink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve been looking forwards to pretending to be enemies on the Quidditch pitch since first year,” Jongin laughs, pulling the other boy in by an arm looped around his friend’s neck. “Besides, I wouldn't underestimate Sehun if I were you! Passed with flying colours on his first try!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two best friends glance at each other, sharing similar looks of raised eyebrows and mischievous smiles that reveal their equal passion for Quidditch that had glued them together since they first met last year. Inseparable since meeting on their very first trip on the Hogwarts Express, Jongin had approached the quiet blonde sitting perfectly straight upright alone in a cabin, flashing sunny grins and introducing himself and his brother in the blink of an eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jongin had met Jongdae’s friends before, when Chanyeol and Baekhyun visited their house over summer break to hang out. It was Chanyeol and Baekhyun, too, who had let Jongin borrow their brooms and taught him to fly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ten year old had only owned big collections of Quidditch books, but had never tried it for himself before. His big brother doesn’t even own a broom, despite loving the game just as much as Jongin does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But meeting Sehun, watching the quiet blonde’s eyes light up immediately once they got started talking about Quidditch, it all outweighed being sorted into different houses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A year later, with the graduation of the seekers from Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, Jongin and Sehun agreed to attempt the Quidditch trials together at the start of the new school year, both now second years while Jongdae and his friends have entered fourth year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And miraculously, the two of them entered the trials together-- Sehun with his old hand-me-down Firebolt that belonged to his older brother who also played Quidditch when he attended Hogwarts, while Jongin had to borrow a broom from the school-- and passed the trials together too, both the new star seekers of their respective teams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Sehun finally speaks, he does so with a shy little tight-lipped grin, pulling his eyes into dainty little crescents. “So you never know,” he chuckles, voice soft and quiet, starkly contrasting to the booming yells from the Gryffindor fourth years. His thin, prettily smiling eyes sweep across the Gryffindors, landing on the Quidditch players amongst them. “Maybe Gryffindor should watch out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The older boys are set off into a round of good-natured laughs at this, laughs that are vastly different from the way they chortle everytime an unsuspecting student (or even better, teacher) walks into their set-up pranks around the school. Their laughter is as light-hearted as Sehun’s words are, and despite their rowdiness, they quieten just for Sehun to speak, ever since being introduced to the soft-spoken Slytherin last year. Baekhyun and Chanyeol had immediately taken to the adorable shyness of the boy, while Jongdae can’t get enough of his scathing sarcasm-- though it is the last fourth year Gryffindor of Jongdae’s group that still acts as though a stranger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amongst this, the shortest Gryffindor watches the exchanges happen between all his friends without a single word, with only a slight smile-- until he reaches forwards to pat Jongin on the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congrats, Jongin,” he says, everyone else quieting down immediately so that his low, deep voice could be heard. His round, dark brown eyes flicker over to Sehun, blinking slowly at him through his thick-rimmed glasses, and he turns his small smile towards him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me you haven’t met Sehun yet?” Chanyeol pipes up in the sudden silence, rapidly looking back and forth between the Slytherin and his short friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve met,” the small boy hums in his usual quiet rumbling tones. “Last year. But we never properly introduced ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baekhyun makes a noise of disbelief. “You never introduced yourselves through an entire year?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ignoring him completely, the Gryffindor turns to the younger Slytherin, who is actually frustratingly towering over him already. “Nice to meet you, Oh Sehun,” he smiles, warm and inviting, and definitely notices Sehun’s rapid succession of blinking at that. “I’m Doh Kyungsoo.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Sehun manages to force out, belatedly realising he should probably reach out to grasp Kyungsoo’s outstretched hand. “I-- I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyungsoo only chuckles, and the tips of Sehun’s ears glow a gentle pink against his bright blonde hair at Kyungsoo’s apparent amusement before quickly glancing away in his embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Chanyeol says loudly, slinging a long, thick arm over Jongin’s shoulders. “Wait does this mean now that Sehun’s on the Quidditch team, Slytherin’s going to know all of our tactics?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a little giggle, Sehun follows along behind them as Chanyeol bounces out of the stands with Jongin in tow. “That’s why I said Gryffindor should watch out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Jongdae is right on their heels, arguing about the superiority of his house when it comes to Quidditch, Kyungsoo falls behind to the tail of the group, feeling absolutely no need to take part in their conversation that swings towards Quidditch yet again. Despite all his friends and even Jongin either playing for Gryffindor or being just as passionate for Quidditch, as Jongdae is, Kyungsoo can’t help but tune them out everytime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baekhyun joins him as he shakes his end, incessantly muttering that he “can’t believe they never greeted each other all year long”. Kyungsoo doesn’t respond, as he often doesn’t with those friends of his-- though his wide eyes do find the back of the blonde boy’s head again from behind, watching as the two second years laugh together as they walk.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s when Sehun follows Jongin and their friends to the Gryffindor common room one night that he sees Kyungsoo again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though it hasn't been long since the Quidditch trials last time, Kyungsoo doesn't tend to hang out with the group all the time, preferring to stay in the Gryffindor dormitories or curl up on the squishy couches in the common room with a thick blanket by the fire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who even knows what he does cooped up in there all the time,” Baekhyun had scoffed when Sehun mindlessly asked about Kyungsoo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn't even study,” Chanyeol complains. “Or I'd be able to copy his homework more often. But most of the time he doesn't do homework either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He's probably just playing wizard chess and eating whole bags of Every Flavour Beans again,” Jongdae had added as they reach the seventh floor corridor, rounding the corner with Sehun in tow to reach the portrait of the Fat Lady that guards the entrance of Gryffindor Tower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though the seventh floor is quite literally on completely opposite ends of Hogwarts to where Sehun needs to go, down in the dungeons where the Slytherin common room is hidden, they had agreed to meet up in the North Wing on the 7th floor, where they can talk while completing their homework and eat all of Chanyeol’s snacks as they study with no fussy librarian breathing down their necks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which means no curfew either-- the students were able to stay in the study hall for longer than they normally would have been able to in the Hogwarts library, until the sky outside the large floor-to-ceiling windows fully darkened to black and all the flaming torches along the seventh floor corridor sprung to life. The North Wing serves as the perfect study hall, with its hundreds of bookshelves lined up along the walls and warm lamps dotting the wooden tables. So of course, Sehun came along when he ran into Jongin who said he was going to meet up with his brother-- and only upon arriving does Sehun realise that one Gryffindor is missing from their group.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But just as they exit the North Wing from the door right next to the portrait of the Fat Lady, the portrait swings open, revealing a Gryffindor boy with short hair shaved on the sides and glasses clambering out of the portrait hole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Kyungsoo!” Chanyeol calls out, and the rest of the group of friends stop, blinking dumbfoundedly as Kyungsoo straightens up, holding the portrait up for them. “Where are you going at this time?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shorter Gryffindor boy doesn’t respond, only flashing a look of annoyance at the group. “Are you getting in or not?” he snaps, the boys hurrying towards him to climb through the portrait hole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The portrait swings shut behind Chanyeol, Baekhyun, Jongdae and Jongin, leaving Sehun standing in the middle of the corridor. The flickering flames of the torch over his head lights up his blonde hair in shifting patterns, and Kyungsoo’s eyes dart towards him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun jolts, turning his head in a poor attempt to pretend he had not in fact been looking at the other boy, acting as though he had only just noticed Kyungsoo was there. It’s not the most convincing act, but Kyungsoo pauses for a moment before he nods his head briefly in acknowledgement of Sehun’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s all Sehun gets before Kyungsoo is briskly striding off down the corridor. The Slytherin pauses, waiting for the other boy to round the corner and disappear out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With another glance at the golden watch on his wrist, Sehun hurries towards the staircase descending from the seventh floor. He spares Kyungsoo some thought, wondering like Chanyeol voiced where in the world the boy was going this late into the night, before shaking his head. What Kyungsoo is doing is certainly not Sehun’s business, and his primary concern should be the high risk of landing himself in detention with the Hogwarts caretaker if he doesn’t get himself down to the dungeons. He waits at the top for the staircase to swing towards him, knowing that it should be shifting around to now stretch from the seventh floor down to the fourth floor, where he must wait again for another staircase to move, connecting with the first so that it would lead him down another few floors to the ground floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as the marble steps are within stepping distance from Sehun’s position on the edge of the corridor, he jumps onto the staircase, hurrying down the steps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A Slytherin this far away from bed at this time would be quite difficult to explain, and though travelling via the moving staircases in the middle of the castle is not exactly hidden, it would be the fastest means of getting down through all seven floors of the Hogwarts building. He can risk a bit of exposure if it means he can get to the Slytherin common room faster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But just as Sehun jumps off the second set of staircases, knowing better than anyone else to hop over the fake last step that joins onto the ground floor corridor since he had stepped right through it and fallen flat on his face in first year, he pauses, freezing in his spot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spies a familiar flash of red robes, a familiar slouched back, familiar short black hair before the boy turns a corner into the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Doh Kyungsoo?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun frowns. How did Kyungsoo manage to get all the way down here just as quickly as Sehun? He had assumed the moving staircases right through the middle of Hogwarts would be the fastest-- Kyungsoo must know a secret route that is just as fast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon second thought, Sehun’s thin, angled brows furrow together further in confusion. What is Doh Kyungsoo doing down here?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He weighs his options-- but it isn’t difficult to make up his mind. His curiosity regarding Doh Kyungsoo is far too great.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a quick glance around the corridor, Sehun inches towards the corner that he had last seen Kyungsoo, a corner of the ground floor away from the Transfiguration classrooms and shadowed with no torches on the walls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heart thudding in his chest and unease settling in his veins, Sehun peers around the corner-- and watches as Kyungsoo, at the very end of the corridor that stretches out in front of him, stops beside a painting of what seems to be a fruit bowl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The confusion lies much heavier now in the front of Sehun’s mind, watching, holding his breath, as the Gryffindor boy raises a hand and.... tickles the pear in the fruit bowl painting?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes he must have, because Sehun can clearly see the painted pear shake in soundless giggles, rolling around in the frame of the painting before the whole thing swings forward, revealing a little wooden door. And without further ado, Kyungsoo turns the knob, bending down to fit through the doorway, and shuffles in, the wooden door closing behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A secret door? What is Doh Kyungsoo doing snooping around the castle finding secret doors this late at night? Another glance at his watch-- it's close to 11 o’clock already, and certainly past the curfew for the students in younger years. With a last confused glance at the picture of the fruit bowl that Kyungsoo had disappeared behind, Sehun slips away from the corner, hastening along the ground floor corridor to the less grand set of stairs that lead down to the dungeons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here, the golden light of the torches that had lined all the other floors turn a bright emerald green. Perhaps ominous to anyone else, but this is home to Sehun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With another glance over his shoulder, the boy runs down the dark hallway as it slopes further and further down, his footsteps muffled by the black carpet underfoot-- everything starkly different to the red floors and golden lamps of the seventh floor, the home of the Gryffindors. But here, Sehun knows he is descending down this corridor to below the Great Lake, here what little light they have is the colour of potions and walls are shrouded in shadows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That prompts Sehun’s subconscious to bring up the thoughts of a certain Gryffindor sneaking around in the middle of the night again, and he could nearly feel the bubbling of his curiosity before he swallows it back down his throat. Rounding a corner and facing the secret entrance of the Slytherin common room, he pauses to catch his breath, thanking all the stars that would be visible at this hour from the Astronomy Tower that he didn’t run right into the Slytherin prefects.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a quiet whisper of “mint slice”, the great stone entrance swings forward, and the boy quickly stumbles through, forgetting cleanly about any and all Gryffindors and focusing just on diving into bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jongdae,” Sehun pipes up, the older boy pausing in his munching of chocolate frogs to hum at him in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon exiting the Great Hall, Sehun was unceremoniously ambushed by two of his older Gryffindor friends, Jongdae and Chanyeol each wrapping their arms around his broad green-clad shoulders, donning identical grins on their faces. Ever since first year they had claimed Sehun, insisting that being friends with Jongin means that they are automatically his friends too. (“Besides, you're way cooler than Jongin,” Jongdae had laughed.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had dragged him up the stairs and into the Entrance Hall, where Jongdae had explained that they’re hanging out for a study session as he pulled Sehun up the Grand Staircase, and added that “Jongin isn’t invited” with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And thus Sehun finds himself in an armchair in the study area on the fourth floor sitting opposite Jongdae and Chanyeol, who’s leaning his head of silky black hair on his shorter friend’s shoulder as they each read their textbooks. As they dragged Sehun into the room, he had found Baekhyun and Kyungsoo at another table, the brunette sucking on a sugar quill as he works on his long charms essay. Settling at the table adjacent to them with Jongdae and Chanyeol, Sehun had felt eyes on the side of his face and turned, only to be startled at big eyes peering at him, and a gentle tight-lipped smile flashed his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Kyungsoo mumbles in that quiet, low voice he always seems to use, round, searching eyes glued to Sehun’s face. The intensity of his gaze isn’t hindered at all by his big square glasses, the black frames framing his face perfectly and adding to the intimidation factor that his heavy eyebrows already have. And so of course the shy Slytherin boy only gives him a quick nod before quickly turning back to his own table, completely missing the furrowing of Kyungsoo’s thick eyebrows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that doesn’t stop Sehun from letting his eyes stray all throughout their study session, wandering from the transfiguration book open in front of him to the wall he’s facing, to the carpet, before landing over at the short-haired Gryffindor again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His glances don’t last long though, always just fleeting little looks before Sehun attempts to pinch himself and focus his eyes back on his homework, to no avail.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A closer look yet again and Sehun realises that while Kyungsoo is scribbling on a long stretch of parchment that probably should be his own charms essay, it looks more like the parchment is dotted here and there with random little inky doodles instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Sehun’s suspicions are confirmed, as the moment Baekhyun leans back in his seat with a long sigh of relief escaping him, Kyungsoo straightens up to pull a fresh piece of parchment out of his bag, snagging Baekhyun’s freshly completed essay from in front of him as he quickly begins to copy it. The brunette Gryffindor barely complains, only letting out a sigh and shake of his head before resuming his sucking on his quill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Sehunnie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun’s attention snaps back to Jongdae, who is still buried nose-deep in his divination reading. “You know all the secret passageways through Hogwarts, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chanyeol had straightened up from that neck-breaking position he was in with his head on Jongdae’s shoulder, groaning as he rubs the junction between his neck and shoulders. He puts down his Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them textbook, quickly grabbing his notebook that sits with his quill and ink on the table in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He flips his leather-bound notebook open to a fresh page, beginning to dutifully sketch some new creature from the textbook that he doesn’t already have notes on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Jongdae frowns in thought, eyebrows sloping upwards towards his hair line in that curious way they do. He puts his reading down, clearly loving having any excuse to neglect divination. “I like to think that I do, but in all honesty there’s definitely a great majority that Chanyeol and I haven’t discovered yet. Like the Chamber of Secrets,” he sighs, and Chanyeol looks up at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We definitely need to work on that one,” the taller boy agrees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jongdae nods, before looking over at what Chanyeol is still sketching and both eyebrows go shooting up his forehead. “What even is that??”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An Augurey!” Chanyeol exclaims. He ignores Jongdae’s quieter mutter of “a </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>??”, hurtling on as he points happily to his sketch. From across the table, Sehun can’t make out much of it except for ink blobs and random lines flying all over the page, and with the way Jongdae squints at the drawing, Sehun guesses that it doesn’t make a difference whether you see it upside down or not. “You know, like an Irish Phoenix, it sings when it’s about to rain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure that isn’t like… a malnourished chicken?” Jongdae cocks a eyebrow, only for Chanyeol to wave him off dismissively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what it’s supposed to look like,” the tall Gryffindor insists. “Thin and pretty sad-looking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Jongdae seizes Chanyeol’s little leather notebook, remarking under his breath about how neat his Care of Magical Creatures notes are, he reads out some lines of information on the Augurey, “native to Great Britain and Ireland”, “the myth that the cry of the Augurey signalled impending death was dispelled in 1824”, “feathers repel ink, and they live in a tear-shaped nest in thorn and brambles-- I’d be pretty miserable if I lived in thorns as well”. Chanyeol looks endlessly pleased at the amount of detail he goes into for each and every animal in his little notebook, and Jongdae remarks the same as he gives it back to his friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you sketch every creature?” Sehun asks, and Chanyeol nods enthusiastically, flipping the pages as he holds up the book for Sehun to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unicorns, dragons, dragons, dragons, nifflers, occamys-- Sehun’s eye catches on a blank page with only text and no sketch as Chanyeol flips to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No drawing for acromantulas?” he asks, only for Jongdae to snigger and Chanyeol to vehemently shake his head, pulling the book back to sit in his lap once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way,” he says shuddering. “I hate spiders.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spiders must be his worst fear or something,” Jongdae chortles, glancing back at Chanyeol who quickly flips past the pages on acromantulas and back to his unfinished notes on Augureys. “But he still took his time to write all those notes on them, even though he jumped about fifty feet into the air when he saw a tiny spider on a shelf behind me when we were in the broom closet--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He quickly breaks off his train of thought, Chanyeol whipping his face around to turn huge, rounded eyes on him. They stare at each other, glancing at Sehun in a moment of stunned silence, before Jongdae quickly shakes his head, laughing quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun frowns the slightest. What in the world would they have been doing in the broom closet, of all places?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevermind that,” Jongdae breezes on cooly. “Why were you asking about secret passageways, Sehun? Found one?” he leans forwards in his seat, almond shaped brown eyes glinting with the sudden onslaught of mischief as his lips curve upwards, raising his brows with a lilting grin at Sehun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It reminds Sehun of his question he wanted to ask them in the first place. A quick glance between the two Gryffindors opposite him, Sehun shrugs as casually as possible. What is with these fourth year Gryffindors? First Doh Kyungsoo sneaking off at midnight, now Jongdae and Chanyeol getting themselves in broom closets. How many of them are keeping weird secrets?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could only hope that his best friend Jongin isn’t keeping anything this weird from him. Baekhyun seems to be the only Gryffindor Sehun can trust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No particular reason. I came across a corridor on the ground floor,” he starts slowly, watching as Jongdae blinks long eyelashes at him, eyes wide in curiosity. “There’s nothing but a painting of a fruit bowl at the end of it-- do you know that one?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Sehun could even finish his sentence, Jongdae’s nodding, leaning back into the couch he shares with Chanyeol and into the taller student’s arms that automatically wrap around Jongdae’s smaller shoulders. “That’s just the kitchens,” he says, grinning in that lazy, easy way he always does, simple lifts of the corners of his lips. “We found it in our first year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun frowns. “The kitchens?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, where a whole army of house elves cook up our meals. That’s where all the food comes from when it magically appears on our plates. There’s a pear in the painting of the fruit bowl,” Jongdae continues, and Sehun’s breath catches the slightest in his throat, mind flashing back to the way Kyungsoo had reached up to the painting… “You tickle the pear if you want to go in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun mindlessly nods-- mindless, because of the way his thoughts have flown right back to the night before. Jongdae peers at him curiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is something wrong, Sehunnie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, nothing,” he responds, before risking a small glance towards the other table-- only to find that only a Byun Baekhyun is sitting there. “Where did Kyungsoo go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baekhyun looks up, shrugging. “Left after finishing copying my homework.” his sugar quill is basically gone by this point, and he smacks his lips, standing up from his armchair, stretching and letting his long robes pull up as he yawns. “Oi Jongdae, want my charms essay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Gryffindors sitting opposite Sehun immediately rise to their feet, Jongdae reaching out to grab the parchment Baekhyun holds out to him with a victorious little wiggle of his behind. He turns to flash a sunny grin far too bright for the time back at Sehun. “It’s getting late, so we’ll be going as well. See you next time, Sehunnie!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a chorus of bye’s and waves, Chanyeol immediately latching onto Jongdae’s arm, the three of them slip away behind one of the tall ceiling high bookshelves that hides a secret passageway to the seventh floor behind it, leaving Sehun to glance around, then up at the giant clock on the brick wall of the study room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s hands are gold, though there are no numbers. In fact, the clock only shows how much time there is before the next class, the clock face only reading classes one to four, as well as breakfast, lunch and dinner. But it still tells Sehun that it is definitely too long past dinner for students to wander around in the school, even if Kyungsoo is just going to the kitchens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But is he? Sehun quickly packs up his things, swinging his bag over a shoulder as he hurriedly heads in the opposite direction of the bookshelf the Gryffindors snuck behind to get to Gryffindor tower. Sehun instead steps behind a tapestry at the back of the other end of the study room, that Chanyeol had pointed out to him. The tapestry flutters shut behind him, leaving Sehun in a low little tunnel of sorts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fishing out his wand from the pocket of his trousers with a quiet murmur of “</span>

    <span>lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>”, the tunnel lights up, Sehun quickening his steps down it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He notices it sloping down underfoot, thinking of how the older boys promised that it would lead him from the fourth floor down to the ground floor, where he could just hop down the staircase that leads down to the dungeons-- and indeed, Sehun notices as he emerges from behind yet another tapestry, that he is exactly where he wanted to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because the tapestry at the end of the tunnel he just climbed out of just happens to be right at the corner of the corridor that he now knows leads to the kitchens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Put that light out, would you?” comes a voice from just above Sehun’s head, and the poor boy jumps, clutching his wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only when he swings it towards the wall that he finds the portrait of a rotund man with a thick, bushy beard holding up his hand against the light from Sehun’s wand, peering through his fingers at Sehun with a look of undisguised annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” the boy quickly whispers. Not that he needs the light anymore, with the torches lining the walls. With a hushed mumble </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘nox’</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the wand slips back in his pocket as he strides down the corridor and towards that painting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And in all honesty, he feels a little bit silly. Even though he had seen Kyungsoo himself do it, and confirmed by the Ace Prankster Kim Jongdae himself, Sehun still glances around, fiddling with his fingers, before reaching a hand out, and stroking the pear in the fruit bowl painting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And apparently it just doesn’t work unless you tickle it, because once Sehun does, the painted fruit starts to writhe, shaking again in soundless giggles-- and then the painting swings forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun jumps back, immediately withdrawing his hand as he watches with wide eyes and holding his breath as the little wooden door behind the painting is revealed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And in a sudden stroke of bravery, or more likely curiosity, Sehun grabs the little handle and turns it, clambering through the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Kyungsoo had to stoop over to shuffle through, Sehun must nearly crouch to the floor to get his much larger frame through the doorway that most certainly wouldn’t be for humans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly the door quietly shuts behind him, and Sehun freezes, just making out the sound of the painting swinging back into place in front of it, and he takes a deep breath, slowly squeezing his way inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And once he does, the ceiling rises up enough for him to stand again, and he immediately ducks into what must be a little side storage room, shadowed and filled with cardboard boxes. He squeezes his broad shoulders and long legs between some boxes, peeking around the corner into the kitchen, and gasps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Screaming pots and kettles, sizzling pans and stoves, clanging of plates and cutlery, rumbling of great big ovens that dwarf Sehun’s entire body, thousands of hurried little footsteps of house elves scurrying back and forth through the entire place… and a Gryffindor boy, amongst it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sheer noise of the large kitchens is certainly enough to drown out Sehun’s little gasp of astonishment as well as his second one once his eyes land on Doh Kyungsoo. And he’s thankful for the cacophony of sounds, because whatever the short-haired boy is cooking up in the pot that sits obediently in front of him smells so delightful that Sehun’s pretty sure his stomach rumbled a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun watches silently, head peeking out from around the corner, as Kyungsoo is handed a silver ladle by a house elf perched on a tall chair next to him, and the boy reaches with it down into the pot. He brings what looks like a golden brown stew to his lips-- and Sehun gets to witness the bright blossoming of an absolutely delighted smile light up his entire face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Never in the few times he’s seen Kyungsoo has he ever smiled like that. Then again, while Sehun doesn’t know if the boy smiles more freely when he’s with his friends, this big, bright, unrestrained smile stretched from ear to ear is so different to the tiny little tight-lipped grins that he normally wears on his face that Sehun can’t quite comprehend it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun just watches in silent awe and confusion, honestly, as Kyungsoo chatters happily to the elves as he extinguishes the fire beneath the pot with a quick wave of his wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shy, quiet, serious Gryffindor fourth year who looks like he never has time for anyone’s waffling, smiling the happiest and brightest while cooking in the kitchens at midnight with some house elves?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The crying of the large ovens catch his attention, Kyungsoo’s head snapping around with his eyes wide, and silences it as he runs over to pull the great big doors down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another night finds Sehun yet again down in the kitchens, but only because he thought Kyungsoo might be-- and upon stepping in, watching as Kyungsoo flicks his wand here and there, learning how to magically cook from the house elves, Sehun’s suspicions were confirmed. It does seem that the Gryffindor boy visits the kitchens nearly every night, and almost always brings back some of the food he makes in little boxes to save for himself to snack on the next day. But he never forgets to leave the majority of his cooking to the elves, telling them that they should eat it, they’ve worked hard. By the time Kyungsoo begins graciously thanking his little helpers for all their tips and guidance, Sehun would be slipping out of the fruit bowl painting first, not particularly fancying running into Doh Kyungsoo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smell of baked goods flood the entire kitchens, and Sehun finds himself getting increasingly hungrier the longer he stays and watches. Kyungsoo’s being handed tiny little pink oven mitts, which enlarge with a ‘pop’ at the tap of his wand, and he’s eagerly pulling the tray out of the oven, round eyes wide and shiny with excitement and giggling slightly when the steam from inside the oven fogs up his glasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A large cake is brandished in Kyungsoo’s hands, and though naked with no icing or frosting, the way it’s steaming fresh from the oven and the even, golden colour is enough for Sehun to quietly swallow as it’s set down on the bench top. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyungsoo has a sort of knack for this, for cooking, or so Sehun’s found. So far everything he’s created has looked, smelled, and tasted (going by the expression on Kyungsoo’s face and the exclaims of the house elves) magnificent, and Sehun would be lying if he said he wasn’t dying to try it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Gryffindor himself seems to enjoy sweets in particular, often telling the house elves to package up little pastries and cupcakes so that he could snack on them between classes and while he completes his homework. Even now, as the elves bustle about the boy asking him eager questions of how he wants to decorate the cake, Kyungsoo pauses to consider, before deciding on “milk chocolate ganashe frosting and cream cheese”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyungsoo grins happily at his choice, setting the huge cake aside on the equally large cooling racks to cool as the elves move the frosting in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I like chocolate things the best,” he responds to a curious house elf, and Sehun pricks up in his piqued interest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does see Kyungsoo munching on chocolate frogs in the study halls, but he had never imagined that the Gryffindor boy who seems so distant and unapproachable would share something with Sehun, even if this something is just their love for chocolate. It makes a little thrum of warmth spread down Sehun’s spine, makes his thin lips tweak up a little in pleasant surprise as he watches Kyungsoo stick a finger in the chocolate before sucking on it, humming happily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s like the kitchen is his happy place. Sehun knows Kyungsoo is best friends with the other rowdy boys from Gryffindor, Baekhyun, Chanyeol and Jongdae. Sehun also knows that Kyungsoo never seems to be interested in the things the three are plotting between them, and yet somehow always finds himself in the midst of the action as well in one way or another. But it’s like Kyungsoo is a different person in the kitchens-- he smiles, he giggles in delight at the things the elves say, he laughs with no restraint in his deep voice, he hums in approval at the taste of his food, and he doesn’t seem to have a single moment of irritation or boredom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy in question sits on a stool, waiting for the cake to fully cool before he could begin with the decoration, and his thick eyebrows suddenly scrunch in a moment of thoughtfulness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me,” Kyungsoo suddenly leans forward, propping his chin up on his hands as he peers at the elves. “Am I ugly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun quite nearly snorts out loud from his hiding spot at the entrance of the kitchens just behind his usual tower of cardboard boxes. From the scent wafting out of them, the boxes seem to contain a great assortment of fresh fruits and vegetables. He's never heard such a ridiculous thing. Doh Kyungsoo, ugly?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun shakes his head in disbelief. Kyungsoo may very well be one of the handsomest boys Sehun has ever laid his eyes on. That may not be the case for every person, but Kyungsoo’s big round eyes, tiny button nose, thick plump lips, askew hairs from his bushy eyebrows-- every single feature forms the image of a mature boy, a boy far too mature for his age, yet somehow still retaining the radiant child-like purity in the way his lips stretch when he smiles and the way his cheeks glow as they bunch up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don't thinks young master Doh unattractive at all,” comes the high warbling of a house elf, and Sehun nearly misses Kyungsoo’s next words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why does he look away every time I see him then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That catches Sehun’s attention. He glances around the corner again, finding Kyungsoo looking at the elves with an expression of genuine confusion, as though he has been attempting to solve this question for the longest time. Kyungsoo sighs when the elves shrug unhelpfully, gazing at his cake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No matter,” he quickly says, as though shaking himself out of his own daydream. “Boys can wait-- chocolate cake won’t wait for anyone, though!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And like that, he pulls the cake towards him, and the elves hop up onto tall stools to help coat the sponge in a thick delicious layer of chocolate frosting, Kyungsoo’s little moment thrown into the backs of everyone’s minds-- except for Sehun’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun slips silently out of the kitchens, still running Kyungsoo’s words through his mind. Boys?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With an amused grin, Sehun heads quickly down to the dungeons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Interesting. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun was happy to hide behind his vegetable boxes and silently observe Doh Kyungsoo. He enjoyed it, enjoyed learning little insignificant details about this interesting Gryffindor boy. He prefers just watching, actually, secretly watching.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do Young Mister wants something to eat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is not secret nor silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun’s entire long-legged body jumps, knocking straight into the stacks of cardboard boxes stacked up in columns all around him with a humiliating crash. The house elf standing before him winces, quickly moving to help him up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Young Mister alright?” the elf quickly says as Sehun stands again, snapping his fingers for the boxes to all straighten and right themselves into their original places after Sehun’s little mishap. He turns to Sehun, the Slytherin desperately gesturing with his finger over his lips to shut it, but continues babbling on anyway. “Young Mister musts be hungry. We mades some cakes!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, no, no,” Sehun hisses between his teeth, but the elf already grabbed hold of the end of Sehun’s green robes, tugging him out of his hiding spot and into the kitchen with surprising strength for such a small figure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And straightaway, Sehun glances up, only to meet Kyungsoo’s eyes head-on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyungsoo blinks wide eyes at him, brown gaze fixated on Sehun’s face, thick eyebrows rising on his forehead. He swallows, and Sehun’s eyes drop, following the motion of his adams apple. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Sehun,” the boy says eventually. “What-- what are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun opens his mouth to blurt out an excuse, any excuse, but a high-pitched voice beats him to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I founds this Young Mister watching from the store room, Young Master,” the house elf piques up to Kyungsoo, though the Gryffindor’s eyes stay resolutely on Sehun’s face. “He looked so very intrigued, I thoughts he musts be hungry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun flushes, cheeks growing pinker with Kyungsoo’s unbroken staring. “I-I wasn’t spying,” he tries. “I was definitely not spying on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he glances back to Kyungsoo, the boy is grinning at him with his face lowered, peering at Sehun from under his eyelashes, under the black frames of his glasses. He chuckles, and Sehun is hit in the face with a sense that Kyungsoo absolutely did not buy his little lie at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And finally, with a little jerk of his head, Kyungsoo sits back down on his tall stool at the table, beckoning Sehun over. “Care for a doughnut?” he smiles, shyly, hopefully, holding out the sweet towards Sehun who shuffles closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stops in front of the table, hesitating before taking a seat on the tall stool opposite Kyungsoo’s, and flashes the other boy a confused glance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, have one,” Kyungsoo chuckles, again, grabbing a plate beside him to slide a doughnut across the table to the Slytherin. “Of course you purebloods wouldn’t have heard of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun looks up, looks nervously at Kyungsoo. He’d never thought he’d be anxious over being a pureblood-- but Kyungsoo only laughs lightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a muggle treat,” he explains. “I made them myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun wants to say</span>
  <em>
    <span> I know, I watched you make it</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but stuffs his mouth with doughnut in an effort to keep himself quiet. To his delight, the icing is chocolate and hazelnut, and he makes a noise of appreciation through his chewing. Kyungsoo grins at that, positively glowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re Baekhyun’s favourite sweet,” he continues, watching Sehun eat with a warm smile on his face and a satisfied look in his eyes. Sehun doesn’t remember Kyungsoo ever being quite this talkative. Perhaps it’s the effect of being in his happy place that opens his mouth into smiles and chatter. “He’s the biggest sweet tooth I know. His favourite sweets from Honeydukes are sugar quills, but his heart belongs to muggle doughnuts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a pause, he grabs another doughnut, this time one with golden icing and sparkly little sprinkles dusted all over it and drops it on Sehun’s plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun doesn't even get the chance to resist, peering curiously up at Kyungsoo. “So then…. are you and Baekhyun muggle born…?” he asks hesitantly, carefully, knowing for sure that Slytherins don't have the best reputation when it comes to the topic of blood status.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, we're both half bloods,” Kyungsoo says easily instead, Sehun allowing himself to visibly relax and reach for the second doughnut. “I actually made these to give to Baekhyun, and I wanted to try out making doughnuts as well-- eat up,” he motions to Sehun. “But since you seem to like them, you can have them all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sehun’s waving his hands in front of him, shaking his head even as he takes another bite. This one is rich with flowing caramel icing, the little golden sparkling popping candy fizzing in his mouth. It’s sweet, something that Baekhyun would undoubtedly delight over. “No, no,” he denies with a small, quiet squeak. “This is already plenty!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To his horror, Kyungsoo only turns away, waving his wand with a swish and a flick-- the doughnuts sitting on the adjacent table that Kyungsoo often uses to prepare his ingredients come floating over, and the elves busy themselves placing them all in containers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have these,” Kyungsoo turns back to Sehun, holding out a packaged box of doughnuts, the back of his neck growing quite nearly as red as his Gryffindor robes. “They’d make great snacks while doing your homework, trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And before Sehun could protest, the container is already shoved into his hands, Kyungsoo’s slight smile glowing in the warm yellow light of the kitchen. He doesn’t pull away, hands lingering on Sehun’s for a beat too long, perhaps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should give them to Baekhyun,” Sehun manages, voice low and quiet, the way it always is. The way Kyungsoo’s is, too. “They were meant for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, now they’re meant for you,” Kyungsoo says decisively. “I’ll make more for Baekhyun another time, he doesn’t need to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He peers at Sehun, corners of those plump lips tweaking up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is between you and me. Don’t tell him, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for the first time, Sehun lets his mouth imitate Kyungsoo’s giving him a small grin of his own, nodding obediently despite the light-hearted lilt in Kyungsoo’s deep voice. </span>
