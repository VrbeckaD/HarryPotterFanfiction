  <strong>Hermione's POV:</strong>
</p><p>It's dark but bright at the same time - the murky air repeatedly punctuated with headache inducing strobe lighting.</p><p>So far it hasn't been a good evening, although the dance floor is packed I'd feel too conspicuous actually dancing; which turns out to be a major fault when you come to a club known for it's raging dance music - people come from towns all over to choose a song from the jukebox. Turns out there aren't many gay clubs with up-to-date music.</p><p> </p><p>So, sat at a side table resigned to an evening ill-spent I spot her, within a group also from Hogwarts she's jiving in tight high waisted leather slacks. She's clearly in her element here, shaking her head so her hair is tossed around her ears - it's so short that's all it could reach.</p><p>Halfway through throwing her head back in a laugh she catches my eye. I'm suddenly aware of how long I've been staring. And that I'm sat alone. Had that I've never been to a gay club before.</p><p> </p><p>I look away and smooth my skirt down focusing on each crease in the silk. I feel so stupid. I would normally look for a better work but it fits so well there's no point.</p><p>She's the person I came here for in the first place and now I'm scared that my fantasy has started to come true... I mean I say fantasy - a better word would be scheme because, as disastrous as this night has actually tuned out, I've been planning it down to every last detail; but as I'm sure you've gathered - it has not gone to plan.</p><p> </p><p>If I carry on furiously rubbing the silk on my dress like this it will be ripped to shreds by the time Pansy gets to me - because as the song finishes she begins to saunter over in my direction waving off her friends complaints with a light wave of her fine fingers.</p><p> </p><p>I gulp back my pride (because a gryffindor is brave as well ) and meet her eyes again. Smile.</p><p>Her eyes light up and her walk becomes more purposeful as she flashes me back a grin, making her look more like a pixie with her petite figure. Her legs are long for her height but perfectly in proportion  to her sleight shoulders, exposed and glowing pale in the ultra-violet lighting.</p><p>All of a sudden she's towering over me and my table, casually leaning against the wall to my right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well I didn't expect this," Pansy purred, hands pushing her shook hair out of her face.</p><p>"Well since I am gay, I have every right to be here, as you do," I snapped. Why am I so hostile - it was just a question...? But she has a point I am new to this whole thing.</p><p>"Oh no, I know you're gay Granger, well - bi to be precise, like you like it " She winked as she easily replied, "I only meant I didn't expect you to be here - alone". She blinked innocently at me as I controlled the urge to slap her.</p><p>Didn't she know I was already humiliated enough over that fact?</p><p>"I mean a pretty girl like you surely would have been picked up by now, before a latecomer like me comes over to do it."</p><p>I'm confused now, was that an insult or a compliment?</p><p>But before I have a chance to process it, Pansy continues, "Look before you either leave or tell me to fuck off...." I can see the frustration and impatience pushing through her persona and she flicks her hair back in front of her face,</p><p>"Just... ugh come on snake let's rattle," she finally blurts out."</p><p> </p><p>I blink at her.</p><p>She wants to fight me? Here? Now? I stand up pushing my chair back roughly and walk away in the direction of the open door.</p><p>I can't get there quick enough and I can feel Pansy's eyes boring into my back as my hands begin to shake.</p><p>I can't if she's following me or if I'e left her there.</p><p>I can't tell which I'd prefer.</p><p> </p><p>FInally I gasp as cold air hits my face- like a slap back to reality.  I slump under the neon sign of the club and run my hands into my hair, feeling the familiar curls and wrapping them around my fingers.</p><p>This just doesn't make sense - I mean I know Pansy and I aren't on the best of terms but I've always just thought of it as banter - flirting even.</p><p>Not actual physical fighting.</p><p><em>Never </em>physical.</p><p> </p><p>As my thoughts tumble over each other I don't notice her come outside until she's sat next to me.</p><p>She's close, closer than we've ever been voluntarily before.</p><p> </p><p>So, flirted with me. Asked to fight me. And now she's sat next to me, staring at me and pearing under my hair. I'm desperately trying not to meet her eyes; she can't see me like this, she can't see how much she affects me.</p><p> </p><p>We sit in silence, tensed positions as we wait for the other to speak. Although I know I should be the bigger person and do - I actually don't know what to do - I'm just too out of it to care right now, I've cared enough about Pansy for one night.</p><p> </p><p>But I do, and as much as I hate myself for it I'm so aware of how our shoulders are touching, bare skin on bare skin. No layers.</p><p>And before I can stop myself I look her directly in the eye, (which isn't hard since she's still peering under my curls) shake my hair out of my face,</p><p>breathe,</p><p>and I kiss her.</p><p> </p><p>Just a small one - nowhere near enough to show how strongly I'm feeling but enough for me to taste her minty chapstick on my lips.</p><p>- And to leave me in shock.</p><p> </p><p>Did i really just do that?</p><p> </p><p>My hair is back over my face as I struggle to stutter out an apology, panic welling inside me stopping me from getting to my feet.</p><p> </p><p>But as I finally find a foothold to launch myself out of this terrible situation I feel someone, no not just someone Pansy, grab my hand and I'm yanked unceremoniously back to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>I brace myself for the hard slap I know is long coming but it's much softer than that and definitely not a slap.</p><p>It's a kiss.</p><p>Pansy Parkinson is kissing me.</p><p> </p><p>And as nice as it is, as gentle yet passionate - I have to pull away.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you want to fight me?" I try to demand but it doesn't have my normal force and authority behind it when I'm embarrassingly out of breath.</p><p> </p><p>"What...?" Pansy says softly as she moves to kiss along my collarbone, I succumb to her but only momentarily, I pull away and continue,</p><p>"You asked me to fight you, and now you're kissing me  - that doesn't make any sense" I've got my head back now and I'm bolt upright; I need to know she hasn't just been toying with me.</p><p> </p><p>Now it's her turn to hide behind her hair although I have to say somewhat unsuccessfully as it stops at her chin and cheekbones.</p><p>Suddenly the thread on her top is apparently riveting as she refuses to meet my gaze while mumbling something inaudible.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry would you like to repeat that?" As I've gained my breath I've also gained back my authority and, Pansy actually seems to respond to it.</p><p> </p><p>She suddenly stands up and my hand is yanked out of hers as she finally spits,</p><p>"...I was asking you to bloody dance."</p><p> </p><p> </p>
