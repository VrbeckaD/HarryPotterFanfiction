    <p>"You can disguise yourself, Black, I know it's you." Severus tried not rolling his eyes when Black, dressed as an old woman came and sat next to him. </p><p>He'd found a quiet corner enjoying his peace until Black came, evidently, looking for him.</p><p>"Well, you're not dressed for the party," Black said to him. </p><p>Severus took a deep sigh. "I'm only attending because Mr Malfoy requested my presence. He said if I didn't come, Potter wouldn't stop harassing me. I don't understand why I needed to be here…" He shook his head. "It's your birthday party and we're not friends." </p><p>"Harry thinks we should be more cordial. Given how he and Malfoy are going to shack up soon." </p><p>"How is that any concern of mine?" </p><p>Black brought out his wand and spelled his costume away. Now, he was dressed in Muggle jeans, a black t-shirt, and a motorcycle jacket. Severus almost caught himself thinking about how good he looked. </p><p>"Those trousers are far too tight for someone your age." </p><p>"I'm turning forty two, Snape, not one hundred and two." Then he raised an eyebrow. "And my eyes are up here."</p><p>"Oh, for goodness sake!" Severus got up to walk away when Black pulled on his hand. </p><p>"Come on, Sev…" Black's voice, low.</p><p>"Sev? You don't get to call me that." </p><p>"Then what do I call you?" Black asked; Severus noted they were still holding hands. He was just about to reply when Black closed the distance between them. </p><p>Severus took a step back, and Black took a step forward. "Why are you running away?" </p><p>"Because I despise you." </p><p>"You do? Still?" Black's tone was more flirtatious than Severus would've liked. And before he knew it, he'd backed himself into a wall with Black still chest-to-chest to him. </p><p>"Don't you dare…" Severus tried to warn but Black's lips were on his. At first, they didn't move but Black tried to deepen the kiss, pushing his tongue in-between Severus's lips. </p><p>Severus lost the battle, opening up to him, and Black moaned into his mouth. </p><p>"You're going to stay the night?" Black asked, once he'd slightly pulled away.</p><p>"What's in it for me?" </p><p>"My arse. Obviously," replied Black.</p>
