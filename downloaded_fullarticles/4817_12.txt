    <p>It's like falling. That strange sensation when your consciousness is just about done lulling you to sleep but your body protests against the peaceful dreaming with a hard, involuntary spasm.</p><p>This time, however, he crashes into the ground feeling bruised and battered, betrayed and helpless- but still, alive and clothed in some tattered uniform he had gotten somewhere. He won't be for long, however, without a proper place to stay- any place to stay, in fact.</p><p>Perhaps the draining sensation in his body isn't from those wizards' spells but simply from dehydration.</p><p>For days, Credence is left walking the streets, taking to the darker alleys now and avoiding the busiest roads, feeling utterly drained. Weakened by the Aurors' hexes and now by starvation, the Obscurial does nothing but stir distant emotions inside him that the young boy no longer thinks he has the strength to fight. He is beaten, cast aside, and betrayed, and that last part hurts most of all. The hope he had, that he could finally learn about magic and learn to control his own powers instead of suppressing them, destroyed by a man named Percival Graves.</p><p>He dares not return to the house where he had lived as a Second Salemer, nor even any of the other orphanages. Something about them scares him, and he doesn't want to be recruited for something... else again.</p><p>But then again, everything until now had been a lie.</p><p>Sneaking around, Credence manages to catch wind of news in the magical world. That kind, short-haired witch- Tina Goldstein- who confronted his adoptive mother before is now working some important job in wizarding government. The young wizard with the bright blue coat- Newt, is it? has traveled back to wherever he is from. He never got to meet him much, but Credence misses him already. And that smartly-dressed man who always seemed to appear when he was hurting most? It turns out that Graves had been impersonated this entire time by some dark wizard. <em> Grindelwald. </em></p><p>He hears whispers on the streets. He doesn't really know if they are true- after all, how can you just... change into someone else? So, as he scavenges what food and information he can, hiding in whatever abandoned shelters he can find, Credence doesn't believe he can ever have friends again.</p><p>Until he dares to venture past a somewhat respectable club into one of the less occupied wider streets. Then he catches a glimpse of someone he thinks he used to know.</p><p>He sees <em> him </em>.</p><p>Curiously- perhaps against his better judgement- Credence decides to follow the man, the first tangible connection to the wizarding world he has caught a glimpse of in awhile. Impersonator or not, maybe he'll get the truth. He deserves at least that.</p><p> </p><p>A wistful glance at the setting sun tells Percival that it is Friday. After all, it's the only day of the week besides weekends that he might get the chance to go home early instead of spending the evening in his office, vetting papers and supervising Auror reports. Though it could be another day- ever since the <em>incident</em> happened, Seraphina has been by his office many times encouraging him to get some rest, get out of the office more.</p><p>So that is indeed what he does, as soon as (though he did try to leave the ward a few days before then) the healers have determined he can walk stably on both legs and has recovered enough to move back into his old apartment. On rare evenings where the Director of Magical Security does not have a pile of important work to accomplish, he uses the opportunity to catch up with coworkers he has known for longer and has even on occasion, attended some fancy dinner event (Seraphina insisted, and she could be very persuasive).</p><p>Mostly, however, he continues to work.</p><p>He works harder, not wanting to lose that sense of security he has always had in his career-heavy life. His affluence makes the rearranging of his apartment an easily accomplished task, but other than that, Percival insists on maintaining his purposeful routine. A freer outlook on life does that to a person, and he refuses to allow Grindelwald to take that from him.</p><p>Adamantly refuses.</p><p>But sometimes the outlook isn't so great. Sometimes the pain of Grindelwald’s torture returns in his nightmares, he struggles to breathe, and it takes him a moment to remember that he's not imprisoned in a dark room somewhere, unable to prevent the dark wizard from hurting everyone he has ever cared about.</p><p>Those nights Percival spends alone trying to drown out the sounds of his own screams- God forbid he ever show that kind of weakness to <em> anyone </em> ever again- with a bottle of Firewhisky, trying to ride things out on his own.</p><p>Tonight, though, Percival expects to finish catching up on case files in his abode, ready for the next morning of debriefing and supervising and important conferences. He makes his way down the main elevator of the lobby, grateful that the day has gone very smoothly, and decides to take a stroll by the park on his way home instead of Apparating (the feeling is quite relaxing, he admits to himself).  </p><p>And then it happens again. He feels a sudden chill down his spine that makes his walls go up all over again, and without even thinking Graves' wand is at the ready like it's been for the last ten years of his life.</p><p>"If you're going to hex me, maybe you should have the decency to do it to a man's face." Percival stops in his tracks, tone icy and intimidating as the multitude of defensive charms he has committed to memory come to mind. He expects some criminal wizard to have it out for him- it wouldn't be the first time- or some other Section 5A he's going to have to take in.</p><p>What he doesn't expect is to hear the trembling, cowering voice of a boy he has only ever seen out of his own case file.</p>
