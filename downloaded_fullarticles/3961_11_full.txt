    <p>“Puny annoying god; stay down!” The Hulk roared. The sound echoed unpleasantly in his already pounding head, and hurt Loki’s ears. It seemed to take forever before the Hulk generously left Loki in peace with his thoughts. He surprised Loki by jumping out the window with another loud yell, then mercifully all was quiet. The sounds of the battle were muted by the ringing in Loki’s ears. Loki shook his head to clear it, instantly regretting it. Forcing himself to concentrate, he took a deep breath and took stock of the situation.</p><p>Frankly, he was shocked to still be alive. He lay in a heap on Stark’s ridiculous living room floor, where the green monster hand unceremoniously dropped him like so much unwanted trash. Splinters of wood dug into his skin. Surprisingly, he hadn’t been pushed directly through the floor.</p><p>A part of him was mortified that the Hulk had been able to throw a god as powerful as Loki around like a doll. If his father was to see him now, he would turn from him in disgust. A true warrior of Asgard would never allow himself to be so easily defeated, not even by a gigantic rage monster. <em>Not that it matters. I’ll never be good enough in his eyes, </em>Loki thought bitterly. After all, if it hadn’t been for his father, he wouldn't be in this situation to begin with.</p><p>Loki forced his thoughts back to the present; now was not the time to dwell on the past. In truth he should be grateful; he was thinking clearly for the first time in months, finally free of Thanos’ mind control. He had suffered much pain and sorrow at the Other’s hands.</p><p>It seemed all he’d needed to break free was a hard hit to the head. Loki couldn’t help but be a bit amused by his current circumstances. How was this even his life? It was like a badly written epic. He smiled slightly at the thought, but it turned into a wince as he struggled slowly to his feet, ignoring his various injuries.</p><p>There was urgent work to be done. This was his disaster to clean up. He could not allow the humans to be subjugated. Humans might be primitive and backward, but they didn't deserve to be enslaved. Walking out onto the gauntlet, he looked up to see the enemy streaming through the portal. The portal needed to be closed as quickly as possible. It was their only hope. Loki had no intention of dying on Midgard.</p><p>Carefully, he gathered his magic around him and flew up to the roof where the Doctor he had enslaved was monitoring the Tesseract. Loki was making his way toward the Tesseract when out of nowhere the Black Widow came flying toward him, almost catching him off guard.</p><p>Loki raised a hand and stopped her in midair.</p><p>Damn all the luck, he did not have the magic to waste battling this woman. He admired her strength and power, but the norns knew she had been a constant thorn in his side. Even while suspended in midair and totally at his mercy, she glared at him fiercely, and he had no doubt that if looks could kill, he’d be dead where he stood.</p><p>He looked Natasha Romanoff in the eye as he spoke.</p><p>“I know I have given you every reason to distrust me, but you must believe me when I say I am here to help. We are in more danger than you realize. I do not have the strength to hold you for long. Soon you will be free. I was forced to come here against my will. I was under Thanos’ thrall. I was his puppet.”</p><p>Natasha snorted in disbelief. “You’re right, I don’t believe you. This is just another of your tricks.”</p><p>Loki wanted to scream in frustration. “You must listen. I am being honest with you. Did you not notice that many of my actions where ridiculously theatrical? Why did I simply not take what I wanted? I assure you, I had the power.” or did you mean “I assumed you knew I had the power”</p><p>Natasha gave a short, humorless laugh. “I just assumed you were an inept drama queen.” She said with a smirk.</p><p>Loki ground his teeth in annoyance, but he didn't rise to her taunting. He couldn't afford to let his anger rule him. “I fought the power as much as I could. I had few choices, but I did what I could to thwart my own plans. I even allowed myself to be captured, but eventually, my need to complete my task overwhelmed me. I assure you there was some part of me that wished to be stopped.”</p><p>His power began to fluctuate, and his hold on his captive began to weaken. He didn't dare try to strengthen the spell, needing to conserve what magic he had left.</p><p>He could see the knowledge of her impending freedom light her eyes, and she began to try to break his hold, valiantly struggling against his power.</p><p>Without further warning, the spell released and Natasha tumbled to the ground. Before Loki could make a move, she had recovered and rolled away from him. In the blink of an eye, she was back on her feet. The scepter held tightly in her hand was pointed directly at his heart.</p><p>Loki stared at her in disbelief. How had she turned the tables on him so quickly?</p><p>She raised the scepter as if to strike him with it. Loki felt his desperation grow. She could do him a great deal of damage. The scepter would respond to her thoughts, though she did not know it. How could he convince her?</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. “I will not fight you. I am the only one who can close the portal permanently. The Tesseract was not meant to be meddled with in this manner. It is a powerful object, far beyond your comprehension. If the Tesseract unleashes its full power, there will be no one who will be able to control it. This entire planet will be decimated by the strength of its power.” He hoped his words adequately conveyed his sincerity, since he had no proof.</p><p>She frowned at him menacingly. Loki was sure all was lost. However, before she could speak, there was a loud roll of thunder and then Thor stood between them, in front of Natasha, protectively, but his attention was firmly on Loki.</p><p>“Brother, I will not allow you to harm my shield sister. This time I will stop you. I will no longer allow our familial bond to stay my hand.” Thor could not hide the pain he was feeling. Loki knew his brother did not wish to hurt him.</p><p>Loki was so happy to see his brother that he didn’t even have the urge to roll his eyes at his brother’s pontificating and posturing. He felt true hope for the first time. Surely, his brother could be made to believe him. Thor was not the brightest of men, but his loyalty was unparalleled.</p><p>“Thor, you know me. You know I don’t desire to rule over this disgusting planet. We are gods. The humans do not deserve our guidance or our protection. However, no one deserves to be invaded and enslaved. I may not share your affinity for these mortals, but I will help you rescue them from my unwitting actions.” He willed Thor to believe him.</p><p>Both Avengers continued to stare at him in disbelief, but Loki could see a faint hope in his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“Look at me, brother,” he pleaded quietly. “You know me better than anyone else. I only wish to fix my mistakes. Please let me. Then I will leave and bother you no longer.”</p><p>Thor looked into his eyes, and then he smiled and reached out and pulled Loki into a hug. His ribs creaked in his brother’s grip.</p><p>“I believe your intentions are honorable, brother. I am pleased you have returned to your senses. I cannot wait to take you home. Father and Mother will also be pleased.”</p><p>Loki flinched, and Thor frowned at him in concern. “Brother…” he began hesitantly, but Natasha cut him off.</p><p>Natasha cleared her throat. They turned to look at her; she was watching them warily. Clearly, she was still ready to fight the moment she deemed it necessary. “Not that this isn’t touching, but we have more pressing matters to deal with. Aliens, remember? Apparently, we’re running out of time.” Her voice was hard with anger and distrust.</p><p>Thor looked at her, his eyes shining with sincerity. “I believe Loki speaks the truth, and that we should allow him to stop the Tesseract. I will watch him carefully. If he lies I will deal with him swiftly, and I will not be lenient, I promise you. ”</p><p>Natasha glared at him. She didn't look happy, but she sighed. “Fine, it’s not like we have any other options. I’ll let you turn it off. If you betray us, I will kill you, very slowly and painfully.”</p><p>He couldn’t help but smile at her. What audacity to threaten him this way. She really was delightful. He remembered the horrible things he’d said to her while she interrogated him. Perhaps once his work was complete, she would allow him to apologize. The Black Widow was not someone he wanted for an enemy.</p><p>He held his hand out for the scepter, and she reluctantly handed it to him. Walking over to the Tesseract, he carefully began funneling the power back into the Gem. It was a bomb waiting to go off; the power had to be turned down slowly and steadily. It took great concentration and all the strength he had left to accomplish his task; he dared not fail. He only hoped that if he lost consciousness that his idiotic brother would catch him before he hit the ground. His head couldn't take anymore knocks today.</p><p>***</p><p>Loki looked around, confused. He was lying on a hammock in one of the gardens on Asgard, but he had no idea how he’d come to be here. This garden had always been one of his favorite places. He had many pleasant memories of playing in these gardens as a boy. They had been a peaceful oasis, where he could be alone. He could feel the light breeze against his face, smell the flowers, and hear the gentle trickle of water in a nearby fountain. The hammock beneath him felt entirely real.</p><p>Was this one of Thanos’ tricks? Perhaps everything that had happened had been one of the Other’s attempts to torture Loki on his Master’s behalf. He had taken sadistic delight in seeing Loki suffer by playing with his mind, tricking him into believing he was safe only to rip it away and leave only agony behind. There were many moments when Loki thought he would lose his sanity completely. Loki felt a stab of fear.</p><p>However, his senses told him this was no dream. His surroundings felt completely real. Often memory was inaccurate, and he had learned to see through some of the Other’s illusions, but this was different. The last thing he remembered was closing the portal on Midgard, and then there was nothing. How had he come to be here?</p><p>Taking stock of his physical state, he realized that he was completely healed, and he could feel his magic once again thrumming under his skin. He was really home, as unbelievable as it seemed. His heart filled with joy; he'd never thought to see Asgard again. There was so much he wanted to do. He turned his face up, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his skin.</p><p>Then he heard a familiar and beloved voice call his name. He looked up to see his mother walking toward him. Hardly believing his eyes, he stood as she reached him. She was smiling, and there were tears in her eyes.</p><p>“My darling boy, I am so happy to see you looking so well. I have been so worried. After you fell, your brother and I looked for you, but we could find no trace of you. I feared the worst.” His mother looked at him tenderly.</p><p>In the next moment, he found himself wrapped in his mother’s arms. He stiffened with surprise but then relaxed, returning the hug, feeling truly safe for the first time in what felt like years. It was such a wonderfully familiar feeling. “Mother, please tell me it’s really you, and not some cruel joke.”</p><p>Frigga pulled back to look at him. She was still smiling, but he could see the concern in her eyes. “I found you in a cell on Midgard. But don't worry, no one will even realize that you are gone. I will return you there. It’s me. I promise you, this is quite real."</p><p>Loki was not surprised. Of course they had imprisoned him. Humans were such an ungrateful lot.</p><p>"For months you have been hidden from my magic, but tonight I found you easily. I was shocked to find you on Midgard, and so severely hurt. I brought you here, so that I could heal you, and so that we could talk in peace. Tell me, what has happened to you?” she asked, looking at him expectantly.</p><p>“It is a long story,” Loki admitted reluctantly. He did not want his mother to know what he had suffered, but he knew her well enough to know she would not stop until she had uncovered the truth. He and Thor had gotten their stubbornness from her. “Come, let us sit and be comfortable,” he invited. Leading her to a nearby bench, they sat together. He filled her in on what had been done to him. When he was done, she was crying openly.</p><p>“I am so sorry for your suffering, my son. I know fighting the Other’s hold on you was painful, but I am so proud of you for not giving in. I always knew that there is a great strength in you.”</p><p>Loki took her hand and clasped it between his own, hating to see her so upset. He spoke from his heart in hopes of easing her anguish and reassuring her of his future intentions.</p><p>“Mother, please don’t cry. I know I have not always been a son you could be proud of. I have been selfish and cruel, always thinking of myself. My need for power. Before the Other took complete control of my mind, I had a great deal of time to think about my choices and my mistakes. This experience has taught me much. I have been exposed to true evil, and it has reminded me of what is really important in life.”</p><p>Frigga simply stared at him for several seconds and then she let out a joyful laugh. Loki could only stare in return. It had been a long time since his mother had laughed so openly in his presence.</p><p>“My son, you have no idea how happy you’ve made me. I have waited such a long time to hear you say these words. I knew one day you would discover what you are truly capable of. I had hoped you would become the good man I always saw in you as a boy.”</p><p>Loki could hear the love and pride in her voice, and he felt tears fill his own eyes. He had hurt her so often in the past. He had been so angry, and he’d taken it out on all those around him, but especially his mother. It was true that his father often hurt him, treating him more like an unwanted burden than a beloved son.</p><p>Odin had never hidden his preference for Thor, often pitting the two boys against one another in competitions. The ultimate prize had always been Odin’s approval, but somehow Loki had always fallen short. As far as his father was concerned he would always be useless. His mother had tried to make up for his father’s poor treatment, but Loki had pushed her away.</p><p>“I am sorry for the way I treated you in the past. I was selfish. I hope you can forgive me, and that we can become closer once again.”</p><p>She shook her head. “There is no need for you to apologize. I am the one with much to atone for; I know how much your father hurt you. In truth, I did nothing to stop him. I was weak, and I allowed myself to be ordered about like a servant. I let my husband rule my actions in the misguided belief that his will must not be defied. I was taught to play the dutiful wife. I fulfilled my role even though I knew it was wrong,” she said sadly. She looked away.</p><p>He could not bear to see her suffering so. It was up to him to ease her pain, and heal the rift between them.</p><p>“I will make you a deal,” he said earnestly. “We will forgive each other our past mistakes, and begin again. I do not wish to lose you. You and Thor are my family. I love you both, though if you ever tell Thor I said that I will deny it, and set his cape on fire for his impudence,” he threatened, but he knew his mother could hear the amusement in his voice.</p><p>Frigga let out another watery laugh, and Loki was grateful to see her mood improving once again.</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t torment your brother so. He has a good heart, and there is nothing he wouldn’t do for you,” she scolded gently.</p><p>Loki wasn’t as certain; his brother had often turned a blind eye to the bullying and derision Loki had endured, but he chose not to say so. He didn't wish to upset his mother further.</p><p>Despite the lightness of her tone, Loki was disturbed to see shadows still lingered in her eyes.</p><p>He squeezed her hand gently to regain her attention. “Mother, is something wrong?” he asked quietly.</p><p>She sighed and looked down at their hands. “There is something I must tell you, and I fear you will turn from me in disgust once you know what I have done.”</p><p>Loki was confused and alarmed. “I can’t imagine what you have done that would make me turn on you now. Please, you can tell me anything. I will listen and help you if I can,” he said earnestly. He gave his mother an imploring look, willing her to speak.</p><p>“It is time for you to know the truth. You must understand, I thought I was doing what was best. You had become cold and had a terrible temper. Still do, if I’m not mistaken.” Loki could only nod in acknowledgement He was often emotional, and needed to learn to control his temper.</p><p>“I could not see you caring for another. Your father assured me we were doing the right thing and I let him convince me. I let his assurance assuage my guilt. I did not mean to hurt you.”</p><p>Her eyes pleaded with him, begging for his understanding. Whatever had happened, whatever his parents had done, it must be terrible, indeed. His father’s motives could never be trusted, and anything he thought best would surely cause Loki pain.</p><p>Loki felt himself go cold. Suddenly filled with a deep dread, knowing the next few minutes would change his whole life. He held his breath as he waited for her to speak, bracing himself for the coming blow.</p><p>His mother took a deep breath. “You have a son,” Frigga said quietly. “Your father and I hid him from you, many years ago.”</p><p>Loki could only stare at her in shocked disbelief. Her words echoed in his head. However, try as he might, they refused to make sense. He would know if he had a child. Unless- the thought was too terrible to contemplate.</p><p>“Mother, please tell me you didn’t,” Loki begged. His mother could not have betrayed him in such a manner; it was not possible.</p><p>She nodded. Her face was deathly pale. Loki wanted to shake the truth from her.</p><p>“We removed all traces of the boy and his mother from your memory. Then we gave him a new identity and hid him away. I know we have committed an unforgivable crime, and I can only hope that someday you will be able to forgive me.”</p><p>Loki felt a tidal wave of rage overtake him as the meaning of her words sunk in. Standing, he turned away in an effort to gain control of himself, unable to look at her, afraid that he might actually hurt her in his anger. <em>A son.</em> He had a child, out there somewhere, a child who had no idea who he was. Under the anger, there was pain, but also a feeling of fierce joy. There was a small part of him that could understand why his mother had thought he wouldn't be able to care for the boy. He might have agreed with her reasons, but that did not make the betrayal hurt any less.</p><p>It didn't matter now. All that mattered was that he had a son to find. He only hoped that his child would allow him to be part of his life. Frigga continued speaking.</p><p>“His mother is a good woman. I’m sure the boy grew up safe and happy. I made sure she would care for him properly, I promise you.”</p><p>He could hear the desperate pleading in her voice. Clearly, she was trying to placate him.</p><p>Glaring, he turned back to her. She seemed to shrink in on herself at the expression she saw on his face. Loki couldn't bring himself to care.</p><p>“Where is he?” he demanded coldly. “Where is the son you stole from me?” He spoke calmly, but underneath his emotions were rampaging.</p><p>Frigga hesitated, and Loki felt his worry begin to rise. What was she reluctant to tell him now? Surely, nothing could be as bad as the crimes she had already admitted to him.</p><p>“You will tell me this instant! Or I will tear all of the nine realms apart until I find him. I promise you. I will let no one keep me from him.” He clenched his hands into fists, his nails digging into his palms, but Loki barely noticed.</p><p>Her face was still pale, and she looked so very sad, but again Loki refused to be moved. She couldn't meet his eyes. “He is on Midgard,” she finally admitted softly.</p><p>Loki felt his blood run cold. His son had grown up in that dirty, dangerous realm? It couldn't be true.</p><p>“He is in England,” Frigga continued in the same soft tone. “His mother married, and she gave the child her husband’s name. Your son is called Harry Potter.” </p><p>Loki sat down again. “You will tell me everything you know about him," he ordered in a hard tone. He would not meet his son unprepared.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p>Loki made his way carefully out of Asgard. Avoiding his father’s patrols was surprisingly easy. Thankfully, a few of his back doors were still in operation, so he didn't have to ask Frigga for help. Loki’s mind was reeling with all the information she had given him. There was a great deal for him to take in.</p><p>After all, it wasn’t every day a man discovered he had an adult son he’d never known anything about. <em>His son</em>. The idea still felt foreign and unreal to him. He'd always been far too self-involved to care for another; he’d never really wanted to be a father. However, now that he knew his son existed, he couldn’t help but feel cautiously optimistic. He'd been alone for a very long time.</p><p>The thought of having a family was very appealing. Perhaps he was even a grandfather. He knew he would make an excellent grandparent. After all, who knew better how to spoil a child than the God of Mischief and Chaos? If anyone knew how to have fun, it was Loki.</p><p>He longed to see his son immediately. Unfortunately, his mother hadn’t known where to find Harry. Loki had been furious when he realized his parents hadn’t even bothered to keep track of their only grandchild. There’s no way they would have abandoned Thor’s child, he was sure.</p><p>As far as Loki was concerned, it was simply more proof that his parents had never really loved him like a son. He hated to think of his child also suffering from their neglect. However, if his mother was to be believed, it was for the best that his father had chosen to ignore the child.</p><p>The most incredible and infuriating portion of their conversation kept replaying in his mind, in a never-ending loop.</p><p>
  <em>His mother faced his anger with a quiet well-practiced dignity. She looks quite regal, even when admitting to her crimes, he thought snidely.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her face was tear streaked and pale. Her pain filled eyes begged him to forgive her, begged him to understand, but he remained unmoved. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I didn’t have a choice,” she insisted. “I was sure your son would be better off with his mortal parent. It was all I could do to convince your father not to kill him,” she’d explained.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It felt like a punch to the gut. Loki stared at her in disbelief before his anger began to rise once again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why would Odin want my son dead?” he demanded. “My son was just a baby. What fault could Odin find with him?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not sure. He was furious, of course,” she admitted. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her voice sounded steadier now. She was growing calmer, becoming lost in her memories. “Ranted about you tarnishing the family honor. Our bedroom furnishings took the brunt of his anger. He was careful not to show his feelings outside our private rooms. He insisted no one could suspect anything about your indiscretion.” She twisted her hands, giving away her true restlessness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Loki snorted in derision. As if his father hadn’t had dozens, if not hundreds, of affairs in his lifetime. He was truly a hypocrite.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> However, Frigga chose to ignore him and continued speaking in the same measured tone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“If I hadn’t known better I would have said he was afraid. At first, I thought he feared the scandal that an illegitimate child might cause, but later I realized that it was your son that scared him. Why, I have no idea. But he was determined that the child never come into contact with anyone on Asgard. His mother had to swear an oath on her magic they would never leave Midgard. It was the only way he would allow them to live.”</em>
</p><p>The conversation still didn’t make any sense to him. The All-Father couldn’t be afraid of a baby. It was unbelievable. Loki could hardly credit it, but his mother had insisted it was the truth. However, she was unable to give him any more information no matter how much he probed. He had no choice but to believe her. Could it have something to do with Loki’s true heritage? It was a mystery he’d have to think more about later. If necessary, he would confront his father. He had to know if his son would need to be protected from Odin’s wrath in the future.</p><p>Frigga had also reluctantly admitted that she couldn’t lift the block on his memory without Odin’s permission, as the spell was tied to Odin’s magic. The revelation had made Loki grind his teeth in frustration. Not being able to remember his son’s mother was galling. How had they met? Had she been a good person? Had he loved her? He had so many questions he wanted to ask her. Perhaps once he found his son he’d get a chance to ask them.</p><p>Once safely out of Asgard, he made his way to Midgard. Without the bridge to aid him, it took far more magic than normal. Luckily, he was at full strength. Then he made his way to his cell, which was surprisingly located in one of the labs in Stark Tower. Apparently, Shield Headquarters had been severely damaged during the battle. Loki couldn’t help but smile vindictively at the thought. Those morons at Shield deserved that and more.</p><p>Making himself invisible, he entered the lab. His mother’s projection of him was lying in the center of a cell that had clearly been created to hold the Hulk. Reaching out, he felt his mother’s familiar magic make contact with his own. Once the sensation would have been comforting, but now all he felt was a stab of pain. How long it would take for the pain of his mother’s betrayal to fade?</p><p><em>She hurt me so, yet I still think of her as Mother and not Frigga. Learning not to love her will be difficult, </em>he admitted to himself. Sighing in frustration, he forced himself to return to his task. There was no time to waste; his new family waited. He grinned to himself.</p><p>It was surprisingly easy to enter the cell. If he’d woken in here, even wounded, it would not have been able to hold him. That was unexpected. He would have thought that Thor would be helping the mortals contain him; even Thor should have been able to see this would not be adequate to hold someone of Loki’s power.</p><p>Loki wanted to make sure that his mother’s spell would hold for the foreseeable future. It would be best to keep the mortals busy for the moment. Not for his own sake; it would be easier to look for his son without the threat of Shield and particularly his brother making himself a nuisance. He didn’t want his son or his son’s family getting drawn into Loki’s problems.</p><p>He quickly lent his power to the illusion, his magic mingling easily with his mother’s. Once he was satisfied, he turned to leave. Just then, his brother and the Black Widow entered the room.</p><p>Loki decided to stay and listen. One never knew when useful information might be overheard.</p><p>The two Avengers stared at Loki inside the cell for several seconds, before Thor finally spoke.</p><p>“I am most displeased with my brother’s treatment. Fury insists on keeping my brother locked in this cell. Loki has committed many crimes against your people, it's true, but he proved himself to be a good man in the end. He is injured, and I will not soon forget a child of Asgard being denied the medical care that his people can provide. I have warned Fury, he is courting war with my people.”</p><p>Natasha nodded. “I understand. It isn’t Fury’s fault. Our World Council is insisting we continue to hold him. I’ll never like your brother. I think he’s a pompous ass, but I agree this is wrong. If you decide to take action, I promise to lend a hand. Stark would probably help too. He’s still pouting like a child because Fury won’t let him run some tests. He’s dying to learn more about magic.” Natasha grinned as she spoke of Tony’s unhappiness.</p><p>Thor nodded once, regally, and then bowed to Natasha before speaking again.</p><p>“I am still considering the appropriate action, as I hope that your government will see reason. I thank you for your offer of assistance, Shield Sister. The sons of Odin will be in your debt. I will call on you if necessary.”</p><p>Natasha nodded and left. Thor stayed behind, taking a seat in a chair located outside Loki’s cell. Apparently, he was prepared to keep Loki company.</p><p>Loki was shocked by the conversation and his brother's apparent concern for Loki’s well-being. Thor had never been willing to defend him in the past, yet he was willing to risk war with the Midgardians on Loki’s behalf. Despite his surprise, Loki couldn’t help but be moved. Perhaps his mother was right, and his brother really did love him. He pushed the thought away; he had suffered too many shocks recently. He really couldn’t bear any more.</p><p>Still, this posed a problem. He couldn’t have his brother ruining his plans. Loki sighed. Why must everything be so difficult? Making himself visible, he saw his brother jump in shock. In the blink of an eye, Thor’s hammer was pointed in his direction.</p><p>Before Thor could speak, Loki decided to take control of the situation.</p><p>“While I am touched by your concern for me,” Loki said dryly, “I assure you I am well. Mother has seen me fully healed, and I am strong once again.” it can be dryly or dryly either is correct</p><p>Thor lowered his weapon as soon as Loki began to speak.</p><p>“Brother!” Thor cried.</p><p>His voice was so loud it made Loki’s ears ring. He managed not to wince, but it was a near thing. It wouldn’t do to show weakness in front of Thor.</p><p>“I am pleased to see you well. I am grateful you have been kind enough to ease my worry, but why do you return to this place, if our mother has freed you?”</p><p>“Thor, I don’t really have time to explain, but it has come to my attention that I have some personal business to attend to. It would be easier if the mortals were not looking for me. They can be such a nuisance. I’d rather not have to deal with them.”</p><p>For once, Thor caught on quickly. “You want to leave the illusion in place,” he said.</p><p>Loki nodded. “Can I count on you to keep my secret?” he asked warily. It was never easy to be on the wrong side of his brother’s morality. He could take offense very easily.</p><p>Thor looked at him carefully for several long seconds. “Is something wrong with father or mother?” he asked quietly, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Loki shook his head, keeping his face neutral. “No. Our parents are well. This business does not involve anyone you know. I really don’t have time to explain, but if all goes well, you will be enlightened soon enough.”</p><p>Loki felt a strange mix of apprehension and anticipation at the idea of introducing Thor and Harry to one another.</p><p>“Can you promise that no mortals will be hurt?” Thor asked.</p><p>Loki couldn’t help but smile, as some things never changed. “I have no intention of hurting anyone,” he responded carefully.</p><p>Thor seemed to be looking into his soul. His silence began to grate on Loki’s nerves, but finally, Thor spoke again. “Very well. I will let you go, to attend to this gravest matter. Do you need my assistance?”</p><p>Loki was surprised by the feeling of fondness that swept over him at the offer.</p><p>“This is something I must do myself. I am grateful for the offer,” he said sincerely. His brother had turned out to be a far better man than he ever could have predicted. Perhaps his time on this miserable planet had changed him for the better, after all. However, he would die a hundred times before he’d ever admit that to Thor.</p><p>He transported himself to his brother’s side, and offered his arm to Thor in the greeting of warriors. Thor accepted the gesture and then pulled Loki into a crushing hug. Loki rolled his eyes, but he allowed the contact.</p><p>“Be safe, little brother.” Thor murmured, and he was lucky Loki was feeling generous enough to let the “little” go … for now.</p><p>He grinned impishly at Thor. “You know me. I always come out on top in the end. I am the God of Chaos after all. No one would dare go against me,” he said in his customary arrogant tone.</p><p>Thor gave a long-suffering sigh, which only made Loki grin wider. Annoying Thor was always fun.</p><p>Then, without another word, he transported himself away, a giddy rush of happiness and determination welling up in him. He had a son to find. The Norns help anyone who tried to get in his way.</p>
