    <p>
  <span>June 2028</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I do believe you have had enough wine for this evening,” Fred Weasley laughed, keeping a firm grip on his inebriated wife. She had her head leaned all the way back and was cackling like mad at one of his jokes. He knew she'd had one too many because she never laughed at his good jokes in that manner, let alone his terrible dad jokes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fine!” Hermione insisted, righting herself and relaxing back against Fred, with a hiccup, as they continued to sway around the dance floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, you’re completely fine until tomorrow’s Daily Prophet proclaims we’ve elected a drunkard as Minister for Magic.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not drunk,” she argued, playing with the hair at the nape of his neck. Over two decades together and she was still able to send shivers down his spine, making it feel like the first time he danced with her. “I’m happily relaxed. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to let my hair down and actually enjoy a Ministry function. Plus, I know you won’t let me do anything stupid.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You do remember who you’re married to, right?” Fred said, pulling back and smirking at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let out another hearty laugh. “Let me rephrase that. I know you won’t let me do anything career-ruining stupid.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, that sounds like me.” Fred pulled her close and nuzzled her cheek, whispering, “I’m excited to get you home and literally let your hair down.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, really?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I'm going to take complete advantage of your ‘happily relaxed’ state. How long is Sabrina staying with George and Ang?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione looked up at him, her eyes sparkling in delight. “She won’t be home until tomorrow evening. Ang is taking her and Lilah out to spend their birthday money on manicures, pedicures, and new summer dresses.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am going to have you in every room of the house before she returns,” he murmured against her lips before kissing them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Promises, promises, Mr. Weasley,” she said teasingly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I always keep my promises.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had held the position of Minister of Magic for just over a year, making it a very stressful one as she navigated performing the roles of wife, mother, and leader of the Wizarding World of Great Britain. There were plenty of late nights and long business trips as she became familiar with the role and other foreign governments she would be working with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The year before had been a similarly long year as Hermione campaigned for the position after being nominated by the one and only Harry Potter. Everyone insisted that she was a shoo-in, but Hermione was adamant that she wasn’t going to run solely on her name and Harry’s coattails. This meant she made sure to show her face at every Ministry function she was invited to and working her backside off to ensure she produced work that wasn’t just competent but exceedingly so. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All of that combined for two years of Fred taking on both parenting roles to their two youngest daughters. It helped that Ella was at Hogwarts for the majority of the years, but Sabrina, their youngest, would only just start this coming August. She was an energetic, spit-fire that was easily bored. To combat the boredom, she signed up for numerous extracurriculars, which meant Fred was run ragged from science fairs, piano recitals, and gymnastic meets on top of managing the Wheezes shops.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Needless to say, he and Hermione had spent the past two years in a perpetual state of exhaustion and were in desperate need of an empty house and no demands. That night would only be the beginning. Come August, Sabrina would start her first year at Hogwarts and Ella would start her final year. Hermione’s schedule would slow down and Fred would just have to worry about his shop obligations. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How about you go start on your long list of farewells so we can get out of here and go enjoy our quiet home?” Fred suggested, arching his eyebrows.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I like where your head’s at.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stumbled out of the fireplace but Fred was able to snag her around the waist before she fell to the floor. He quickly silenced her thanks with a kiss, backing her up against the living room wall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Should we go someplace a little more comfortable?” Hermione breathed against his lips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Every room, remember?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He snagged her bottom lip between his teeth, eliciting a pleasurable “Ahhh” from Hermione as she rolled her hips against his. Fred grabbed her arse and held her close, his erection straining against his trousers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You think you’re still virile enough to have your way with me against this wall?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that a challenge?” He pinned her arms over her head and sucked at the sensitive flesh under her ear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re not as young as we once were.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Challenge accepted,” he purred, gliding his hands down her arms and over her back. As he slowly pulled the zipper down, he hummed in amusement. “No bra? How risque, Minister.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What have I told you about calling me that in the bedroom?” Hermione scolded as her fingers came down to undo his waistcoat buttons. Letting that fall to the ground, she grabbed his tie and pulled his lips back to hers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re not in the bedroom...Minister.” He pulled the tie over his head and attacked her lips again, interrupting her growl. Fred swept his hands over her shoulders, pushing down the straps of her satin sage dress, letting it slide down her body and encircle her feet with shimmering ripples. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You and your loopholes,” Hermione muttered, fumbling with his shirt buttons.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred gently grasped her hands and pulled them away from his shirt. Taking a step back, he slowly started unbuttoning his shirt as he took in the sight of his almost naked wife (those panties would be gone shortly), watching him with anticipation in her amber eyes. When she ran her tongue over her upper lip, his cock screamed for release. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Time had taken a toll on them both. Four kids had left them with streaks of grey hair, laugh lines, crows feet, and stretch marks. They both groused about their aging marks but each one had been well earned. And when Hermione still looked at him the way she did their very first night together, Fred couldn’t imagine a more beautiful sight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Whatcha thinking about?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s voice brought him out of his trance and he finished undoing his final shirt button. Tossing the garment to the side, he answered, “You. Always you,” before wrapping himself around her again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Fred nipped and sucked at her neck, Hermione made quick work of his trousers. She pushed them down, along with his pants, finally freeing him from his cloth prison. He pressed himself against her panties and groaned with anticipation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re so wet,” he murmured against the shell of her ear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s been so long,” Hermione panted, biting his neck. She bit the crook of his neck and then lavished the fresh bruise with languid licks. “I fear one touch and I may just explode.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s okay, love. There will be plenty more explosions to follow.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred tried to take his time as he kissed his way down her body. He ran his hands up and down her legs, caressing her arse and breasts as he tried to get her body to relax. When his ministrations started to evoke soft hums and breathy sighs, Fred gently spread her legs apart and ran the tip of his tongue over her soaked underwear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are these still here?” he tsked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The anticipation is always the best part,” she breathed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Indeed it is.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred hooked his fingers over the sides of the panties. He considered slowly inching them down her legs but then decided he had waited long enough and yanked them straight down. Hermione let out a giggle as he struggled to get them off her feet. Her laughter was quickly replaced with pleasurable mewling when Fred diverted his attention from the panties to plunging his tongue between her folds.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck, yessss.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Without breaking from his task, Fred lifted her legs and hooked them over his shoulders, giving him leverage to delve deeper into her core. As her climax built, Hermione linked her ankles and squeezed them around his neck. It was all going fine until--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ow,” Fred yelped against her folds. He pulled his head back slightly and said, “Careful, love. That pinched nerve is still giving me jip.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought I told you to get that looked at last week?” Hermione glared down at him. Half of her curls had escaped from her updo, giving her her menacing lion look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will when I have an opening in my schedule. Until then, shush! And be gentle with my old bones.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Speaking of old bones, when am I gonna get mine?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione grinned at him and Fred growled, throwing her legs off him. He jumped to his feet and pressed her back against the wall. Her grin never faltered, even when he grabbed her arse and dug his nails in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you know how fucking crazy you make me?” he asked, resting his forehead against hers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Show me.” She wrapped her hand around his length and gave it a slow stroke. “And don’t you dare hold back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred growled again and lifted her off the ground. She locked her legs around his middle and he thrust himself into her. He stilled for a moment, enjoying being sheathed in her warmth. Keeping Hermione pressed against the wall, he started slowly rocking in and out, building up a rhythm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As Hermione’s walls started to tighten, Fred quickened his thrusts. One of her hands was gripping his shoulder and the other had a firm grasp on his hair. He pounded into her hard and fast, ignoring the rattling of picture frames on the wall and reveling in Hermione’s unbridled cries as her climax grew closer and closer…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When her wave of pleasure crested, Hermione sank her teeth into Fred’s shoulder. He felt his legs start to shudder as the pressure of his own release mounted, but he held tighter to Hermione and continued to fuck her into the wall, ensuring she got the most out of her orgasm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come with me, Fred,” she breathed. “I want to feel all of you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her simple request was all it took to break his resolve. As her walls quivered and crumbled around him, he fell over the edge with one more thrust. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When their breathing had slowed, Fred summoned the last of his strength, held onto his wife, and stumbled backward until the back of his calves hit the sofa. He was about to sit down when Hermione mumbled, “I really don’t feel like trying to get cum stains off the couch tomorrow.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Floor?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go for it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred gingerly guided himself to the floor and let out a long sigh, letting his head fall back against the couch. Hermione hummed with contentment and nuzzled her face into the crook of his neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How’s that for ‘old bones’?” Fred reached up and unclipped Hermione’s hair so he could run his fingers through her curls. “I think I’m still quite virile.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, you’re a majestic sex stallion.” Hermione sat up and kissed him, twirling her fingers into the hair at the nape of his neck. “What room is next on your debauched house tour?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred let out a whimper, making Hermione laugh. “How about a nice, hot soak in the tub?” he suggested.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That does sound nice. It’s not because you’re feeling sore though, right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course not!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because you did promise me every room.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I did.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You do remember how many rooms we have, right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah...how about we go with our favorite three? Even majestic sex stallions need sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Deal,” Hermione agreed and rolled off his lap. Fred slowly rose to his feet and offered his hand to help Hermione up. “You go ahead. I like the view from behind,” she said with a wink.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Minx.” He smirked and sauntered towards the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And I like bubbles in my bath!” she called after him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>August 2028</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ella! Are you almost ready?” Hermione called up the steps.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Mum! I’ll be down in a few minutes!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione narrowed her eyes at her middle daughter’s snippy response. Reminding herself to pick her battles with the teenager, she let out a sigh and went back to the kitchen. Her youngest daughter, Sabrina, was sitting at the kitchen table. Her chestnut curls were bouncing as her head bobbed along to music from the radio. Her Hogwarts trunk was at her side and the latest edition of Hogwarts: A History was open in front of her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sabrina Lee was a mini Hermione in just about every way- her looks, her love of learning, her need for everything to be fair and just. In true Weasley fashion, though, she had inherited Fred’s love for mischief and pranks. Her and her cousin, Lilah, were fixtures in the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes shops. They were their fathers' shadows, eager to learn all the tricks of the trade.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, sweetheart?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What house was Eliza sorted into?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ravenclaw,” Hermione answered, glancing at the clock. They needed to be at the train station in twenty-five minutes. Fred still wasn’t home and Ella was still locked in her room. She was already completely exhausted and still had an afternoon of meetings to get through.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And Hugo was in Gryffindor?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Hermione looked back to her daughter and smiled. “Are you worried about where you’ll be sorted?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. As long as I’m in the same house as Lilah I’m happy. And we have a plan so it should be good.” Sabrina went back to reading, ignoring Hermione’s raised eyebrows.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If you don’t mind me asking, what sort of plan?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Please don’t let it involve Skiving Snack boxes,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she silently pleaded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad and Uncle Harry were telling us how the sorting worked because Uncle Ron and George were trying to scare us, saying we had to fight a dragon.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course they were,” Hermione muttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They said you get sorted alphabetically, which means Lilah will go before me,” Sabrina continued as she turned a page in the book. “Uncle Harry said the hat will take your choice into consideration so I’m just going to make the hat put me in whatever house Lilah goes to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have a feeling I know where it’ll send you girls,” Hermione said, chuckling as she thought of all the green and silver stuff she’d be washing over the holidays. Her thoughts were broken by the sound of the floo.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry,” Fred said breathlessly, kissing Hermione’s cheek. “Garret didn’t show up for his shift and left Madeline filling a large order that was supposed to have been packaged last night. I  couldn’t just leave her to sort that </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> work the floor so I had to floo around for someone to fill in the shift, find Garret, fire Garret, and then I helped pack up the order.” Fred sighed and looked over at Sabrina with a grin. “I made it though! Couldn’t miss the start of our little girl’s Hogwarts career.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi Daddy,” Sabrina greeted. She closed her book and carefully placed it in her bag. “Can we go now? I wanna make sure I get to sit with Lilah on the train.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As soon as your father drags your sister out of her room.” She gave Fred a pointed look and added, “Tell her if it isn’t packed then it obviously isn’t important.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“On it.” Fred planted a kiss on Sabrina’s head and hurried to the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, how scary was the Basilisk?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never actually saw it, sweetheart,” Hermione answered, summoning her purse and rifling through its contents. She could have sworn she had a Wideye potion in there. Unless the one she had yesterday to help her get through legislation reading was her last one. Fuck...her memory was going down the toilet lately. She desperately needed a day off to let her mind repair and reset. Giving up on her useless search, Hermione sighed and clasped her purse. “If its bones were any indication then I would say it was very scary. Uncle Harry or Aunt Ginny could tell you more about it.” Hermione paused for a moment and finally looked up at her daughter, her brain finally registering what they were talking about. “Is that in Hogwarts: A History?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course,” Sabrina said, jumping off her chair and slinging her bag over her shoulder. “There's a whole chapter on the Heir of Slytherin and his monster. Do you think I’d be able to--”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not a chance, Sabrina Weasely. I know for a fact that the chamber was destroyed and sealed up after the final battle and you are not to go asking around about it. Understood?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Mum,” Sabrina said with a huff. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took a breath and massaged her temples. The last thing she needed was a letter from the Headmaster informing her that her youngest was sentenced to eternal detentions for trying to find the corpse of a madman’s monster.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. Now, do you have all of your stuff ready?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Mum.” Another huff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A door slammed upstairs, making Hermione grimace. It seemed as though Ella was finally ready, too.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I kept some bacon sandwiches warm for you,” Hermione said as her middle daughter stalked into the kitchen. Fred followed with her trunk levitating in front of him, a look of resigned irritation on his face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want a bacon sandwich,” Ella muttered. She summoned a granola bar from the pantry, yanked the fridge door open, and grabbed a bottle of Pumpkin Juice. “Can we go now?” she huffed, slamming the door closed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cedrella Jean,” Fred started, his voice full of warning.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t call me that!” Ella shrieked. With a frustrated cry, she spun and disapparated with a crack.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you see what she was wearing?” Fred cried, motioning to the spot their daughter had been occupying.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione ran a hand over her face and groaned. “She was wearing a skirt and blouse.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The skirt was way too short and the blouse was extremely low-cut,” Fred insisted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s trying to look hot for Brandon. Can I have her bacon sandwiches?” Sabrina asked, eyeing the plate Hermione had under a warming charm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who’s Brandon?” Fred asked, passing a sandwich to Sabrina and taking a bite from the other.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Some cute Hufflepuff she’s in love with.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fucking Hufflepuffs,” Fred gritted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fred!” Hermione cried. “For the love of Merlin, calm down. She’s seventeen and has a crush on a boy! I know exactly what you were like at that age and Ella wearing a short skirt is quite tame in comparison.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean? I was a perfect gentleman at that age.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione snorted and said, “Do the words ‘Veela cousins’ ring a distant bell?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred scowled. “I love you, Granger, but sometimes I really don’t like you. Or skirts. Or Hufflepuffs.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go, shall we? I don’t feel like flooing all the way to Scotland because we missed the train.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred continued muttering under his breath as he took Ella’s trunk through the floo. Sabrina skipped ahead of Hermione and disappeared into the green flames. Hermione waved her wand, levitating Sabrina’s trunk and taking it through the floo with her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When she stepped onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and her stomach stopped rolling, Hermione glanced around and spotted Fred loading Ella’s trunk onto the scarlet steam engine, so she sent Sabrina’s gliding over to join him. Standing a good distance to his right was Ella, chatting and laughing with her two best friends, Penelope and Samantha.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If there was ever a Weasley that stood out in the family it was Cedrella Jean Weasley, and not just because of the unusual name that she despised. Ella was tall, with long blonde curls and grey, bordering on silver, eyes. It seemed as though some of the Black blood had held on through the generations of Weasleys.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione and Ella used to get along quite well. Ella shared Arthur’s fascination with the Muggle world so she loved hanging out in his workshop, visiting with Hermione’s parents, and browsing Muggle shops with Hermione. When Hermione started campaigning for the Minister position, her relationship with Ella slowly became strained. She knew it was natural for rifts to occur between parents and children in the teenage years, but Hermione found herself desperately missing the closeness the two had and she'd been trying desperately to get it back over the summer. Unfortunately, Ella was sensitive and quick to take offense so the attempts usually ended in a fight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Making sure Sabrina was with Lilah, Hermione cautiously approached Ella. She stood a few feet back and when she finally caught her daughter’s eye, waved her over. Ella frowned but broke from her pack and came to stand in front of Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You ready for your final year?” She reached up to fix a rogue curl but Ella dodged the gesture.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess so,” she muttered, adjusting her shoulder bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighed and gave Ella a smile. “Your father can be an idiot at times, you know?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Understatement.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, but he means well. Sometimes he just gets overprotective of you girls. He did the same with Eliza.” Testing her luck, Hermione reached out and took Ella’s hand. To her surprise, Ella didn’t pull away. “You look beautiful, sweetheart.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks, Mum. I should trust Grandma Molly more often. Apparently purple doesn’t look horrible on me,” Ella said, looking down at her shirt.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Grandma Molly usually knows what she’s talking about,” Hermione laughed. The train whistle blew, giving the students and their parents a ten-minute warning. “I have to go check on Bree and make sure she hasn’t smuggled any contraband into her bag.” She reached up and gave her daughter a tight hug. “Keep an eye on her, okay? I have a feeling she’s not going to be in Gryffindor with you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? You think?” Ella said with a sarcastic laugh. “I’ll do my best to keep her out of detention but I honestly think she’s spent too much time with Dad and Uncle George for her to make it through the year entirely detention free.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know. Also, start thinking about what you want to do for your birthday. We’ll celebrate however you want when you’re home for the holidays.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Love you, Mum,” Ella said, giving Hermione one last hug. “I’m gonna go find Dad.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a full heart, Hermione maneuvered her way through the crowd of people, looking for Sabrina. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oi! Minister!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before Hermione could look for the owner of the voice, she was pulled to the side and into the chest of her grinning brother-in-law.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Our girls are ready to fly the nest,” George said, motioning to Sabrina and Lilah. The two girls were beaming and practically vibrating where they stood. “Their bags have been searched and all contraband has been confiscated.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione gave her youngest a wary look and Sabrina rolled her eyes. “It was just a couple of dung bombs, Mum.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And?” Angelina prompted, looking at her own daughter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fainting Fancies,” Lilah muttered, looking at the ground.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please try to stay out of trouble for at least the first week,” Hermione pleaded, gathering Sabrina in her arms. “And make sure you write to us tonight or tomorrow. Let us know what house you’ve been sorted into.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, okay,” Sabrina said, muffled by Hermione’s hug. “Can we go now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione let her daughter go only for her to be scooped up by Fred.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You behave yourself, Bree Lee,” he said, dangling her over his shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad! Put me down!” Sabrina squealed, smacking his back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred did as she requested, kissing her cheek as he set her back on the ground. “I don’t want to find a Hogwarts toilet seat in the post.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why would I send you a toilet seat?” Sabrina asked, readjusting her bag and giving her father a disgusted look.</span>

<p>
  <span>“Inspiration catches you in weird and wonderful ways,” George said wistfully. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right, let’s stop giving them ideas.” Hermione kissed Sabrina’s cheek. “Get going now so you get a carriage together.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sabrina and Lilah waved before hurrying to the Hogwarts Express and climbing aboard. Within a minute they were both hanging out a window, frantically waving as their parents waved back and shouted “Bye!” and “Love you!” Hermione actually caught sight of Ella giving them a tiny wave from her carriage as the train slowly pulled away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow,” Angelina sighed, watching the train turn a corner and disappear. “I can’t believe how quickly they’ve all grown up.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now the real fun can commence,” Fred said, throwing his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. His smile faltered when he looked down at Hermione and saw her sniffling, with tears running down her cheeks. “What’s wrong, love? You haven’t been this emotional since we sent the twins off for their first year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s just that Sabrina is our last one and it’s Ella’s last year.” She dug a tissue from her purse and wiped her eyes. “Oh, I’m just all over the place at the moment. I feel so tired and rundown. I need to grab a Wideye potion so I can get through my meetings and then come home and collapse.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sounds like a plan.” Fred kissed the top of her head and they said good-bye to George and Ang before apparating away.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred was just about to set up the nighttime security wards when the family owl, Pudge, landed on his outside perch and pecked at the kitchen window. He barely had the letter off of the bird’s leg before it took flight again, disappearing into the night sky. When he saw the tidy script on the front, addressing the letter to ‘Mum and Dad’, he grinned. After quickly finishing the wards, he bounded up the steps, eager to find out which house Sabrina had been sorted into.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had become a tradition with him and Hermione to bet on which house their kids were sorted into. The winner got to pick the next three films they would see at the cinema. Hermione only ever got one wrong (she thought Ella would be in Hufflepuff), but Fred was pretty confident that his little firecracker was currently snuggled under red and gold.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Letter from Bree,” Fred announced, striding into the bedroom. Hermione poked her head out of the bathroom, a ring of toothpaste foam around her mouth. “Time to place your final bets. Still think Ravenclaw?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione ducked back through the door and he heard her spit, gargle, and spit again before reappearing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, I don’t actually,” she said, taking off her silk robe, revealing a tank top and threadbare gym shorts. “I believe we have our first Slytherin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred scoffed and looked at his wife, waiting for the ‘just kidding!’. When she said nothing, he shook his head. “No, my sweet little girl did not get sorted into the snake pit. She’s obviously a Gryffindor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you know your sweet little girl and George’s sweet little girl had a sorting pact?” Hermione asked, turning down the covers and settling into her side. She grabbed the nail file from her side table and set to work on her bedtime routine- file, lotion, and brush before popping in her nightguard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What sort of pact?” Fred pulled off his trousers and tossed them aside. He swapped out his Oxford for an old Harpies tee and settled into bed beside Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just read the letter and you’ll see.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He opened the envelope and unfolded Sabrina’s letter.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dear Mum and Dad. It worked! Lilah and I were both sorted into Sss--bugger and blast, you’re right,” he groaned and then finished, “both sorted into Slytherin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I hate to say I told you so,” Hermione said with a sing-song tone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred looked at her expectantly but she never glanced up from her filing. “Well? Go on, say it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione finally looked up with an innocent look. “I just said I hate to say it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You bloody well don’t,” Fred muttered as she attempted to hide her smirk. He read through the rest of the letter before summing it up for Hermione. “She says the feast went well and she got to see Nev but it’s going to be weird calling him Professor Longbottom. Ella actually spoke to her, congratulated her on her sorting. She swears she saw a House Elf in the dungeons and is insisting that she needs to have a familiar, preferably a cat.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“At least she made it through the night without landing in detention.” Hermione placed her brush back in the drawer, snuggled down under the duvet, and turned to face Fred. “I think I finally figured out what’s wrong with me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fred laid down beside her, frowning. “I wasn’t aware there </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> something wrong with you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, it’s not exactly wrong. But you know how I’ve been really run down and exhausted, plus a bit emotionally unstable and absentminded lately?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes. I thought you said that was from work stress?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think it partially is. But today I went over my menses cycle of the last year and noticed that they haven’t been quite so regular. I called my mother and it seems early menopause runs in our family. I believe that’s what’s starting for me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean, menopause?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean, what do I mean? Menopause, Fred. When a woman is no longer deemed a ‘spring chicken’. I’m turning into an old hen.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” Fred said, finally cottoning on. “Mum always called it ‘the change of life’.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, well, I’m pretty sure I’m hitting that change. Please consider this a pre-apology for whatever I may put you through as I age out of my prime years.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please!” Fred laughed, giving her a quick kiss. “You have plenty of good years left. At least two or three. Maybe five, even.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fred Weasley, you’re horrible!” she cried, giving his shoulder a shove. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He caught her hand and pulled her against him. “But you love me anyway.” He kissed her again, lingering a little longer this time. “You are timeless, Ms. Granger-Weasley. All your years are prime years. But if you think you’re going through this change then it’s probably a good idea to talk to a healer about it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Already made an appointment for next week. Unlike you, I don’t wait for things to get worse before going to a professional.” Fred stuck his tongue out at her but she just laughed. “Speaking of, how has that pinched nerve been?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“About the same. A nice rub might loosen it up,” he said, arching an eyebrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So subtle, Mr. Weasley.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It is what I’m best known for.”</span>
