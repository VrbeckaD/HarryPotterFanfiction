    <p>The Great Hall was full of students' voices and laughs. The light of the floating candles gave a sweet and warm hue to everyone's faces. Most teachers had taken their seats at the long table, but two were vacant. The Headmaster was the one missing, but also one other professor. Severus Snape was not at the table. The usual ghosts of the castle gently slid between the tables, talking to the students and making jokes. The Slytherin table was quiet as ever, but the same could not be said for the Gryffindor table.</p><p>However, as soon as the Headmaster made his appearance, taking the place on the pitch, everyone stopped talking.</p><p>“My warm welcome to everyone”, he said in his majestic voice echoing on the walls of the big hall. He smiled over his multifocal glasses. “Let me introduce you to the newest member of our teachers. Her name is Vesper Mallory”, he continued and stretched out his hand pointing to an elegant presence next to McGonagall. “Would you like to say a few words, dear?”</p><p>The female nodded and rose from her position gently. She walked to the Headmaster and turned her face to the students. Her appearance was frightening as well as particularly beautiful at the same time. She was tall, with a thin body and beautiful curves. She held her hands crossed in her chest and her black painted nails were evident, which was very rare for a teacher. Her face was oval with harmonious features, big cerulean eyes and full lips. She seemed to have a tattoo in her right hand which was not easily distinguishable due to her long dress sleeves. The posture of her body was very stiff and rigid. Her last feature that stole the show was her long, raven black hair that was in contrast to her pale white skin.</p><p>“Good evening students”, she spoke in a monotonous voice. “As the Headmaster previously said, my name is Vesper Mallory and I belong to the Slytherin House. I’m a pure blood witch and I have to say that up to fourteen generations ago, all my ancestors belonged to Slytherin House”, she paused for a moment, glancing over the Slytherin Table. The students seemed rather pleased by her words. “I am here to teach you Defence Against the Darks Arts because I know the subject quiet well. I used to be a Deatheater”, she declared with steady voice. Frightened whispers filled the room and most students seemed terrified. “Muggles often say that once you go black you never go back but I have to say that black magic isn’t my thing. I have tried it and I did not like it”, she turned to look at Dumbledore who was looking at her with so much pride in his old eyes. “I feel the need to thank you, Headmaster. Thank you for the opportunity to let me return back to normal.”</p><p>“I thank you for accepting the position, professor Mallory”, the older man smiled softly.</p><p>With a soft and respectful bow, Mallory returned back to her seat.</p><p>“Let the feast begin!”, Dumbledore announced and all the tables filled with food.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Later that night</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Dumbledore’s Office</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>

  </strong>
</p><p>Just after the end of the dinner, the students were brought to their dormitories and Mallory was already in the Headmaster’s office as he had asked her before. The Headmaster was sitting behind his desk, with a papyrus in his hands and his gaze fixed on her. Vesper had already taken her seat in one of the two chairs in front of his office, her hands again crossed on her chest.</p><p>“I know what you’re going to ask me, Albus…”, she softly spoke, exhaling some air.</p><p>He smiled faintly. “Allow me to think that you don’t.”</p><p>“I’m listening then…”</p><p>“Well…”, he sighed. “Times are really difficult and you know that better than anyone. Voldemort is alive and you are in serious danger, Vesper. I can not risk the safety of the students for no reason. So I suggest that your lesson be in co-operation with the Potions course.”</p><p>“How this will help, Albus?”, her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“Severus Snape can help you protect the students in case on emergency.”</p><p>She huffed. “No, this is not the reason you want him in my lessons. You don’t trust me, Albus. You can say it. I will always be a Deatheater in your eyes!”</p><p>“Am I not the one who saved you from the Deatheaters?”, he let out a shaky breath. “Am I not the one who welcomed you back in Hogwarts when you didn’t have where else to hide?”</p><p>“Yes, but I am not allowed to step a foot outside the castle and believe me I do understand that”, she shook her head. “Only if Bellatrix knew how addicted was Voldemort with me…”</p><p>“My dear Vesper…”, he placed the papyrus on his desk and crossed his fingers, looking at her over his glasses. “That is why I want Severus Snape with you. They are after you and if Voldemort finds out that you are here, sharing the same roof with Harry Potter, he will do anything to penetrate into the castle.”</p><p>“Why him?”, she shrugged. “Why not Minerva?”</p><p>“I trust him more than Minerva”, he responded casually. “He’s like a son to me.”</p><p>Vesper was ready to say something when someone knocked on the door and her thoughts slowly faded.</p><p>“Come on in”, Albus fixed his attention to the door.</p><p>A fine, male figure wrapped in black came into the office with quick moves. You could not easily recognize the face, but Vesper knew that this man was familiar to her. She stood up from her chair as the figure approached the desk. As the hood fell on the back of the man, Vesper’s speculations were confirmed. He was Severus Snape. His black, like coal, eyes were still the same after all these years, just as his hair, like ebony, fell on his shoulders. The posture of his body, still hard and rigid as always.</p><p>“Good evening”, he said, voice like velvet. <em>As always.</em></p><p>“We meet again”, Vesper cocked an eyebrow, smirking. That was so amusing. The first time those two met was fifteen years ago in Hogwarts. He was already at his third school year when Vesper came to Hogwarts. It was that period when Snape had stopped hanging out with Lily Evans and Vesper was the one who approached him first. No one could say that the two of them had become best friends, but they certainly liked each other. Things got more difficult when Vesper started dating Lucius Malfoy. He was certainly a gorgeous young boy but with many requirements. When Vesper was with Lucius, he did not want others with them, so she eventually stopped hanging out with Snape. That was really hurtful, especially for Snape who thought that Vesper was very close to him. Even if he never admitted it. Shortly before graduation, Lucius broke up with her in the worst way. He revealed to her that, during their relationship, he was seeing Narcissa. Vesper was devastated and attempted to win back Snape’s trust but it was already too late. The ship of their relationship had sailed.</p><p>“Welcome back to Hogwarts”, Snape pulled her out of her thoughts. His voice was a little bit colder than before.</p><p>“It’s nice to see you, Severus”, she admitted with a faint smile.</p><p>“I wish I could say the same”, he said in return. “Headmaster”, his black orbs turned to Albus. “I would like to talk to you. Alone”, he pointed the last word.</p><p>“I think I should go back to my chambers”, she looked at the older wizard who was watching them carefully.</p><p>“No, actually, I have a better idea”, the Headmaster stood up from his chair. “You two go to your class and have a first meeting with the students.”</p><p>“What am I supposed to do when Vesper starts teaching?”, he asked.</p><p>“I can always use some help”, she looked at him but he didn’t even bother to do the same.</p><p>“I need to talk to you”, Snape insisted, ignoring the female.</p><p>“Alright, then”, the white haired man nodded. “My dear, Vesper, you can go to your class. Severus will be there after you in a while.”</p><p>“Sure, not a problem”, she walked to the door. “Have a nice evening Albus.”</p><p> </p><p>When she stepped out of Dumbledore’s office, she looked again at the timetable of her courses. All lessons were four hours and were daily, with the exception of Friday where it was a free day. Monday with Gryffindors. The senior year. Perfect, she thought, rolling her eyes. How she adored that House.</p><p>She walked down to the long corridor and turned left. The path to the dungeons was long, as she remembered. The entire castle was quiet because obviously all students had already started their lessons. Only she had been late.</p><p>A few minutes later she arrived just outside the classroom. Behind the heavy wooden door sounded the loud voices of the students. With a sharp inhalation, she entered the classroom without knocking. The students’ faces turned sharply to her side and the noise reduced to a minimum. Vesper walked up to the only desk in front of students and turned on her heels to face them.</p><p>“Good evening”, she spoke, voice stone cold with no smile. “As you already know, I am Professor Mallory and I am your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. You are in your sixth year of study and I require that you have learned by the end of the semester the nonverbal spell.”</p><p>“We don’t even know what this is”, a male student interrupted.</p><p>“You will never interrupt me while I’m speaking”, she narrowed her eyes dangerously. “Five points from Gryffindor.”</p><p>The students sighed disappointed.</p><p>“Who knows what is a nonverbal spell?”, she questioned and a gingerhead girl raised her hand. “Your name?”</p><p>“Hermione Granger, professor.”</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“A nonverbal spell is a spell which is performed without saying the incantation out loud. Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you are about to perform, which gives you a split-second advantage”, explained the girl.</p><p>“That’s right”, Vesper nodded. “It’s not that-..”</p><p>Her speech was interrupted by the sudden opening of the door. It was Severus Snape. She grimaced once she lay eyes on him. He walked past her and settled on the chair behind the teacher’s desk with his arms crossed on his chest.</p><p>“I forgot to mention that professor Snape will accompany our lessons”, she said coldly to the students. “Act like he’s not here.”</p><p>The students looked at each other quizzically but none of them said a word.</p><p>“So…”, she started pacing around students’ desks slowly. “Performing spells non-verbally is very difficult and requires a good deal of practice, as it requires concentration and mental discipline alone. Different wand-woods may also affect the performance of casting non-verbal magic. Many wands made from Dogwood are rather noisy, and refuse to perform non-verbal magic, whereas wands of Pine are some of the most sensitive to non-verbal magic. Willow wands possess a well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic, but of all woods, Alder is known as being the best suited for non-verbal magic. Some spells, such as <em>Levicorpus</em>, are easier to perform nonverbally than others. Most spells, however, seem to be less effective than normal when the incantation is not said.”</p><p>A boy with round glasses raised his hand. That should be Harry Potter, Vesper could easily say. He had… his mother’s eyes.</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Potter?”</p><p>The boy frowned. “How do you know me?”</p><p>“This question is irrelevant with the class but I can tell you that I knew your mother”, she replied simply. “You already know that you have your mother’s eyes. So. What about the question Mr. Potter?”</p><p>He nodded. “How can we block such spells, professor?”</p><p>“That is a very good question, Mr. Potter. You have to be extra careful watching your opponent's moves. What about a demonstration?”</p><p>All of the students nodded. “Professor Snape?”, she turned to look at him. “Care to join me?”</p><p>“A duel?”, he smirked evilly.</p><p>“Sure thing”, she stared back into his dark eyes.</p><p>“Count me in”, he stood up at once.</p><p>“Let’s all go to the Great Hall”, she turned to the students.  </p>
