    <p>
  <span>Hermione pursed her lips and glanced at the clock. It was six already. She massaged her temples - today had been one of her most hectic days, and she could not wait to go home. She supposed Harry was stuck at work, too, since he usually came into her office to give her a ‘see you later’ kiss and a promise to keep dinner ready. He had not done that yet, so she assumed they would go home together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked at the plate of chocolate cake on her desk. It was her secretary Sarah’s birthday yesterday, and the chirpy blonde had bounded excitedly into her office this morning with a huge cake for Hermione. Hermione had decided to take it home because she could not eat the whole thing herself; and moreover, she had been having bouts of nausea for the whole of the last week and the mere sight of certain food items made her want to throw up whatever there was in her stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed and closed her eyes, but had to sit up straight when she heard the door creak. She reclothed herself with her usual professional manner but her face split into a tired but wide smile when Harry’s face peeked out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hullo, love,” Harry grinned at her; Hermione sighed happily at how fantastic he looked in his Auror uniform.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” she said and stood up to move around her desk and in front of it. Harry closed the door behind him and approached her. Hermione looped her arms around his neck and pulled him close for a kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve missed you,” she murmured against his lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve missed you too; do you think we could go home now?” Harry asked earnestly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so. I’m completely knackered,” Hermione said, dropping her head against his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You work too hard, my love,” Harry cupped her face and pressed a kiss to her forehead. “I’ll make you dinner and then run you a nice warm bath, how about that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione automatically frowned at the word ‘dinner’ but it morphed into a smile when Harry kissed her forehead again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go home, love,” she whispered, burying her head in his chest and inhaling his scent.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione pouted up at Harry and then looked at the spaghetti in front of her. Spaghetti was her favourite food, but tonight she felt her insides turn at just the smell of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think,” she said, “I think I’m not hungry. I’ll just go take a shower.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry scrunched his eyebrows. “Are you sure?” he asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded. She could not open her mouth lest she emptied her stomach on her husband. But then, at that very moment, she had to clamp her hand over her mouth and race to the loo at an impressive speed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry put the plate of spaghetti down and ran after her. He saw her hunched over the toilet, one arm hugging her stomach, the other pressed against the wall beside her firmly. He immediately knelt down to hold her hair back and caress her back comfortingly, wincing slightly when she heaved her entire lunch into the toilet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes, Hermione stopped throwing up and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. Her legs trembled as she stood up and rinsed her mouth. In the meantime, Harry flushed the toilet and let Hermione lean back in his arms when she was done washing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wrapped his arms around her and rubbed her back soothingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You alright now?” he asked softly. Hermione mumbled a ‘yes’ into his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He held her for a few moments before she pulled back and looked up at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione bit her bottom lip nervously and ran a hand through her hair. “I - I think,” she began, “I might be pregnant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes widened at her words and his lips parted in a silent gasp. “Are you - are you sure?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed. “I’ve been feeling queasy for a week now, and my stomach turns up at the sight of food. And I’ve been going to the loo more often than I deem normal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked into her face, his eyes filled with concern. “D’you need me to go buy a test? I’ll be quick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “I think I have a couple in my bag. I had gone to the chemist’s the day before yesterday and something told me I’d need them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That something in your head has never been wrong, has it?” Harry smiled a little. Hermione smiled back, before </span>
  <em>
    <span>Accio</span>
  </em>
  <span>ing her handbag. She rummaged through the contents of it before pulling out two thin pink boxes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll wait outside. Good luck, love,” Harry said, pressing a kiss to Hermione’s cheek and leaving the bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wrung his hands together and tapped his foot impatiently on the floor as he waited for his wife to come outside. It took a few minutes before the door clicked and swung open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And?” Harry asked tentatively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Positive,” she replied, her face slowly splitting into a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes widened behind his wiry glasses. “P-Positive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded once, putting up the small pregnancy test before him. Harry grinned at the two prominent lines in the display, before enveloping Hermione in his arms. She held him tight and smiled when Harry buried his face in her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to be a dad,” he mumbled into the wool of her jumper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione played gently with his locks. “You are, love. And you’re going to be a great one at that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled back, his eyes glassy and wet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, love,” Hermione murmured, taking Harry’s face in her hands and wiping away a lone tear that had rolled down his cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m going to be a dad!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he repeated in a whisper. Tears glinted at the corners of Hermione’s eyes too and her breath hitched at the look on his face - a look she had been on the receiving end of several times before, but a look which never failed to make her heart soar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love you. So much,” Harry murmured before pressing his lips to hers, his hands grabbing her by the waist and pulling her flush against him. Hermione’s knees buckled, and she felt immensely grateful for Harry’s arms around her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were both panting heavily when they broke apart. Harry pressed his forehead to hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for everything, Hermione,” he whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled up at him and stood on tiptoes to brush her lips against his rough cheek. Harry knelt down before her and placed his hands on her belly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked fondly down at him and covered his hands with her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mummy and Daddy love you,” Harry whispered before gently kissing Hermione’s belly through the cotton of her shirt. “And we can’t wait to meet you. Be good for Mummy, OK?” he grinned, before standing up to meet Hermione’s teary face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at me, you’ve gone and made me a weeping mess,” she laughed through her tears. Harry grinned. “You’re going to be a fantastic mum,” he said, kissing the tip of her nose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop making me cry, you prat,” Hermione smacked Harry’s arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You still love me, though,” he smirked, tucking a wayward curl behind her ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione couldn’t but laugh. She put her arms around his neck and rested her cheek against his shoulder, allowing him to wrap his arms around her waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Believe me, I can’t help it.”</span>
