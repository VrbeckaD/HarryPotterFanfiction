    <p>The ball was certainly a hit, full of the sounds of clinking of glasses as people reached for more drinks and of the murmurings of the same people. Every few minutes, laughter would echo around the manor and then simmer down again. In a little while, the music would begin, and after that, there would be a speech and then food, followed by more dancing and more drinking. And Severus Snape could care less.</p><p>He stood outside the building, arms crossed in front of his chest, wishing he could avoid going in. If it weren't for the fact that his presence had been requested, he wouldn't have even bothered leaving Hogwarts. There were essays he needed to grade, potions from his upper level classes that he needed to examine, plus detentions that needed to be filled. Oh and there was a meeting with the headmaster slated for an upcoming day. The drudgery of the school went away somewhat during the Yule holidays, a thing he welcomed, but those weren't due to begin for another week…and he had hoped to use the work that he needed to get done prior to their start as an excuse to be absent from the traditional event the Malfoys' held.</p><p>Alas, it didn't work.</p><p>It was in that manner that he came to be at the manor, watching the lights play out over the scenery before him. The snow laid in high enough blankets where the grass was, though the pathways were completely dry. If the muggles knew the wizarding tricks to shoveling, magic might be envied just a little more. Severus was quite glad that he didn't have to worry about ice – there'd be plenty of that to be had inside.</p><p>He was about to resume walking when he heard footsteps behind him and looked over his shoulder to see Crabbe and his wife approaching, with Yaxley close behind them. They had obviously been at the party for a while, as both weren't as steady on their feet as they usually were. Neither said a word to the tall man they passed, and he stayed silent too, narrowing his eyes as he watched them.</p><p>"Late too, Snape?" Yaxley stopped walking, shoving his hands deep into the pockets of his robes to keep them warm.</p><p>He began walking, bridging the gap between himself and certain boredom, and then responded to the other man. "For reasons better than yours, I am sure."</p><p>"Reasons such as not having a date? It's hard to dance at a ball when you don't bring one."</p><p>Severus cut his eyes to the man keeping pace with him. "Unless she's wearing an invisibility cloak, I see no woman at your side either. And I don't dance."</p><p>Yaxley looked abashed for a second, and then couldn't contain a tiny grin. "Yes, well, you know how these balls go. Everyone shares."</p><p>Severus just shook his head and entered the manor. Bellatrix was the first to see him, her expression turning surprisingly gleeful when she noticed the man at his side. She grinned manically and rushed over to them, letting out a cackle. "Snape, I adore your date! I didn't realize you've finally come out of the closet!"</p><p>"You missed it while you were in Azkaban, dear Bella." His voice was thick with sarcasm and an abundance of annoyance. It was well-known that he and the crazy witch were barely on good enough terms to be in the same room, but it couldn't be said that he had tried to make things work out between them. <em>He </em>at least was civil, holding his tongue most of the time (if their master was around). She was a different matter, acting like a barbarian, making little to no sense. "I can't help but notice that you don't have anyone on your own arm. Perhaps you'd like to take Yaxley? He does so love to talk."</p><p>The witch gave the wizard beside Severus a slight wink, looking him up and down. "Alright, just for you. Maybe he'll tell me about your relationship?"</p><p>Yaxley gave Severus a look. "You expect me to pretend that I fancy blokes and we're…together?"</p><p>He shrugged. "She knows neither is true, but Bella will be Bella. If she can give someone hell, she will." He looked to the witch, who winked at his statement. "I assume it is safe to say I will see you again before the night is out. Try not to go too hard on Yaxley; he may not be able to stomach it." And then she was gone, pulling the shorter man with her, and Severus was left alone again.</p><p>Spotting a table set with goblets, he sped toward it, grabbing the first one within his reach. Without bothering to sniff it or look at it first, he lifted it to his mouth and downed the whole thing. It burned going down his throat, but he wasn't complaining; this burn was a good one, unlike the one achieved by anything besides the best firewhiskey. Eying the table, he surveyed what else there was. Butterbeer, mead, vodka in the bottle so people could mix it with what they wished, a pumpkin flavored…something that he didn't care to try, and an assortment of elven brews. <em>'And to think that this isn't even beginning to tap their stores…'</em></p><p>He selected the last goblet he saw that contained his favorite elf-made wine, then turned from the table to retreat to a pillar. That was normally how he spent these wearisome events; drinking and standing alone. Every now and then various people would come by and speak, normally asking if he could brew them a potion to help with some problem or another. Lucius almost always came over when he was ready for a break, and Narcissa could usually be counted on to engage in conversation toward the end of the night. The balls that Draco was allowed to attend, the young wizard normally just stood with his professor.</p><p>Tonight, though, everyone was staying away from the side of the great room he had chosen to occupy, and he was perfectly okay with that. He sipped his wine, alternating between watching dancing and men who slinked off with wives of other men and then reappeared a little while later. Just after seeing Lucius take off with his second woman of the night, he looked back to the dance floor to see a woman heading toward him – but she wasn't just any woman.</p><p>She was tall and slender, her body perfectly formed and her beauty exquisite. Her black dress clung to her in all the right parts, showcasing her curves at their best. The dress was beautiful, simple, but also aggravating. It had no color besides black, any sequins or glitter, or embroidered designs. Elegant, sophisticated, just like her. It was floor length, pulled in at her trim waist, with a V-neck that started just below her breasts. The material covered her enough to be considered decent, but revealed just enough to make a man want to see more. And when she paused on her way toward him, turning around because she heard somebody call her, he felt his trousers growing tighter. The back was simple too, with the fabric forming an "x" across her skin. It was higher up, around her shoulder blades, and there wasn't a shred of fabric from there to the end to of her back. Oh how he wanted her. Finally, she turned back around. Her very movements spoke of regality and refinement, of being the best.</p><p>No, Narcissa Malfoy was not just any woman.</p><p>"Severus! I'm glad you could make it." She flashed him a smile as she stopped before him. "Lucius said that you were afraid you may have had another commitment."</p><p>He took another sip of wine, and then rewarded her with the tiniest of smiles. "And miss seeing you, Narcissa? I'd hardly dream of it." He stepped back from his pillar to regard her again, then took her left hand and kissed it gently, noticing as he did so that she wasn't wearing her ring. "You are stunning, as always."</p><p>She blushed, her pale cheeks coloring, "A gentleman, as always. You flatter me." She shifted slightly, looking at him. "You look well."</p><p>He nodded, about to say that she did too, but he knew that he would be speaking a lie. She was trying to do the typical Malfoy thing by pretending everything was normal, but he could see the pain lurking in her eyes and the ghosts that were causing it. "How are you, really?"</p><p>She eyed his goblet. "Is that firewhiskey?" A drink she preferred to avoid. Not good.</p><p>He eyed her. "Is it really that bad?"</p><p>"I saw him. Both times, with those girls."</p><p>"It's wine." But he offered it to her, watching as she tilted it to her mouth and then watching her throat as she swallowed.</p><p>"Thank you." She moved her wrist, examining the red liquid. "This one's your favorite, isn't it? I had it brought up, hoping you'd come."</p><p>"Yes, it is. I'm flattered that you would think of me." There was drop of wine on her lips, lips that were made to be kissed, and he couldn't seem to take his gaze off of them. His groin ached more as he imagined stepping forward, bending his head down...</p><p>"I always do when we host anything. You're the only one who understands the displeasures of attending something you don't feel comfortable at." She took a step closer to him.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow slightly. "You don't feel comfortable at these functions? You've never mentioned that before."</p><p>She sighed. "Everyone else is allowed to have a good time – you know that nobody stays loyal when we host one of these Death Eater balls. Nobody except me. Lucius would murder any man who dared lay a hand on me, even though he doesn't want to touch me. He doesn't understand why his dalliances bother me."</p><p>Her voice wavered toward the end. "Narcissa," his tone was surprisingly gentle. "You shouldn't have had to see that." A slow song began playing. Taking the goblet back from her, he set it down and then pressed her against him. "Here, let's dance."</p><p>If she was surprised, she didn't show it. "You hate dancing." It was a simple statement that had a question swimming in its undercurrent. She wanted to know why he was doing it.</p><p>"You're supposed to dance at a ball. That's the whole purpose of one."</p><p>"Yes, typically with your date…"</p><p>"Then that must make you my date." He was surprised that he said it, surprised about all of this actually.</p><p>"Well, then. If you're my date, does that mean this is okay?" She pressed every inch of her softness against him, resting her chin on his shoulder. He murmured something unintelligible, settling his hands more firmly upon her, and she found herself smiling. "I thought you might say that."</p><p>The music grew tuneless, monotonous, droning. Eventually, it seemed to disappear entirely. All Narcissa could hear was the whoosh of her blood circulating hot through her veins, and the pounding of her heart beating for the first time in months.</p><p>The stiffness of Severus' starched cuffs contrasted sharply the softness of his fingers flexing occasionally against her bare back. And every once in a while, a wool-covered button scratched the revealed skin of a neglected breast. His dark eyes were upon her. She could feel them almost palpably roving over her body, but she avoided meeting them with her own. She might have been losing her mind, and seeing desire reflected back at her would push her over the precipice.</p><p>Plus, there was her husband…</p><p>"Having fun, kiddies?"</p><p>Cissa's head turned to catch her sister's glinting, mocking eyes. "Bella!" She blushed despite herself.</p><p>The darker witch chuckled, urged Yaxley to spin her out and back in. "I'm having a ball, Cissy!" Bella cackled at her own pun. "Are you?"</p><p>Subtly, Narcissa pressed her body to Severus', hoping to urge him away from the intrusive couple. Instead, she was treated to the firm evidence of his arousal pressing above her hip. "Oh." She couldn't contain the utterance. His hand tightened on her back, and the one leading her edged them to the left, opposite Bella and Yaxley. Slightly stunned, she followed the lead, wide-eyed and tense.</p><p>Bella's laughter followed them. "Hell! You even billow when you dance, Snape!" Yaxley joined in her manic giggling.</p><p>"It can't be surprising," Severus murmured.</p><p>She swallowed, wishing her mouth wasn't so suddenly arid. "No. My sister is notorious –"</p><p>"I don't refer to your sister."</p><p>"Oh." Was that all she could say? Between her fierce flush and her moist knickers, she couldn't seem to form a cogent response.</p><p>"Your husband is quite preoccupied."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Narcissa. Look at me." The hand on her back tightened further, and she couldn't help suddenly imagining it on her bare thigh. She gathered her strength…and looked up.</p><p>'Damn his parents for making eyes that dangerous,' she thought. "What?" She whispered.</p><p>He'd danced them into a darkened corner of the dining hall, shadowing his face and looking either demonic or angelic. "Let me have you tonight."</p><p>"Severus." Her throat threatened to close. Something salacious slithered into her belly and coiled up, prepared to strike. "Lucius…"</p><p>"Is absent." Snape's chin rose stubbornly. He was slowing their dance. "Again," he added with a devilish smirk.</p><p>"Don't humiliate me," she snapped. The old defensiveness could rear its ugly head most unexpectedly and unwelcomely.</p><p>"I assure you that's the last thing I wish to do to you."</p><p>Oh, how she wanted… "Dammit, Severus! Ooph!" A wall was hard at her back, and Snape was hard at her front. "Don't! Please!" But she was already melting.</p><p>"Don't what?" He was barely bottled restraint raising her arms above her head. "Don't stop? Or don't continue?"</p><p>Her mind was shutting down. She could only splutter helplessly. "But… I can't… you… Continue…"</p><p>"Excellent choice." And before she could protest or realize her slip, his mouth arched roughly across hers and the spring in her belly released.</p><p>She groaned with abandon into his mouth. His tongue stroked hers possessively and his hands clutched hers above her head. She broke away, needing air, needing sense, needing… "Let me go! I need to hold you!"</p><p>His chin rested atop her head, fast breaths huffing into her neatly bunned hair. He didn't release her arms, though. "Here?" He asked. He thrust a generous hardness against her belly as if in threat.</p><p>"NO!" She yelped too loudly. She was Narcissa Black Malfoy, by the goddess, and she was still witch enough to maintain propriety even when her very sanity was under carnal duress.</p><p>Her arms were lowered slowly, but not released. "Then you have approximately thirty seconds to take us somewhere…private." His lips dipped to her ear and his voice dipped to the octave below safe seduction.</p><p>She nodded, knees shaky. "Come on."</p><p>Her heels ticked a quick stoccato on the dim marble stairs and she pulled him along behind her. Her heart hammered and a thin sweat broke over her shoulders. She was shaking with nervousness, anticipation and a healthy dose of fear. 'Lucius will murder you if he sees,' she thought. 'Foolish fucking witch! You hardly know this wizard! And he's still a Death Eater! No better than the others.'</p><p>The manor's third floor was completely deserted. It was hardly used, anyway – save for when the Dark Lord called on <em>all </em>of his followers. In the empty silence, she shut off her conscience. It was easy to do when a wanting wizard was trying to press her through the door she chose. "My wand!" She gasped. His hands were already searching out the secret to her dress' dismissal, and the ebony shaft that answered to her was nestled snug against her thigh.</p><p>"Where?" He growled into her neck.</p><p>Her arm struggled from his embrace to reach for her leg, but he was quicker. A rough hand rucked up her dress, and met hers in a fight over flesh and magical wood. She managed to pull it from its holster, but seized when his fingers found her sodden crotch. "Ah!"</p><p>"Ah, indeed," he oozed. "Open the goddamn door."</p><p>Her hand trembled as his fingers explored forbidden territory. "Aloho- OH!" She gasped. A ripping sound was heard, and he was fingering her in earnest. "Oh, Severus…" Her bones were disolving.</p><p>He nudged the neckline of her dress aside and nipped at a pebbled nipple. "Door."</p><p>"I can't!" Couldn't he tell he was destroying her?</p><p>A strange calm settled. His free hand curled around hers, gripping her wand with her. "Shhhh." He soothed her. Kissed her sweetly. She whimpered. "Now."</p><p>"Alohomora." They spoke together.</p><p>The door opened. They tumbled inside. Severus kicked it closed and was swiftly attacking the clasp at her neck again. "Take it off," he hissed. "Or I'll tear it off."</p><p>She tossed her wand to the great bed behind them and reached for the intricate clip on her dress. Severus dropped to his knees before her like a penitent. But far from a penitent man, he was a most sinful one, tugging down the tattered knickers of his associate's wife. He felt the ties of her frock fall against his hair and pulled it down as well.</p><p>She was naked when he stood, preciously pale and bare save for a black leather wand holster on her right thigh. Her arms were crossed over her chest. He shook his head, pulling them away. "Don't be modest, witch. You know you're gorgeous."</p><p>She licked her lips as he backed her to the bed, feminine fingers fussing with his many buttons. "Why?" She snarled. "Why so many buttons?" Her knees hit the edge of the bed and her hands reached the edge of patience. She simply yanked. Hard.</p><p>Woolen buttons scattered with a clatter over the wooden floors. Even in the low moonlight, she caught the serious glint in his eyes. "Eager?" He asked, shrugging out of the frock coat.</p><p>"Damn you," she snatched his shirttail from his trousers. He chuckled low in his throat, molesting her unapologetically while she struggled with his trousers and cravat. Finally near enough to naked, he crawled over her, pushing her into the thick feather mattress.</p><p>Narcissa whimpered and mewled, arched into his curious touches and teasing tongue. He toed his boots off and took hold of her knees, bent to cradle him. There was a moment witnessed only by the stars in the undressed windows – the moment when two souls clothed only in desire and silver light paused to regard each other; the moment when one more heartbeat, one more touch, one more kiss means the difference between transgression and regression; between taking and letting go.</p><p>Amidst heavy breaths, a calloused thumb sweetly stroked the witch's swollen, wet folds. Her hand wrapped with wonder and anticipation around the wizard's ample erection. They lunged hungrily, chose transgression; in their own wild ways, they took and let go at once.</p><p>She could tell he was holding back. Probably her fault, as it had been some time, and she was uncomfortably tight and whingey. "Oh, gods!"</p><p>"Narcissa," he hissed her name like a supplicant, a beggar. She softened in response, relaxed around the satiny steel inside her.</p><p>"Severus." They fell to kissing, moving as one. His hands, his very body spoke of a manliness she'd missed without missing. His mouth and his cock woke her dormant desideration. Her release loomed like a phoenix rising. "I'm so close," she gasped.</p><p>"Thank the gods," he answered. His teeth were clenched.</p><p>His hair hung against the sides of her face, brushing as he thrust. He stared at her unrelenting as if his eyes could eat her lust up. Perhaps they did… She held his head in her clawing hands, tangled the inky locks round her fingers. Planting her heels in the bedding, she shifted her pelvis up. "There! Yes, yes!" And oh, yes… <em>That </em>was pleasure. "Faster! Harder!"</p><p>He didn't make her beg, just groaned into her neck and snapped his hips like a whip until they both cried out. She rippled round him - the surface of a lake disturbed, and he shattered - a vessel of fragile glass, spilling his seed and his strength inside her. Their magic surged, mingled – a feeling with which Severus had little experience and Narcissa had distant memories.</p><p>Floating to earth like feathers, their desperate clutches turned to sweaty caresses. Severus rolled them, bringing her flush with his chest. He brushed fingers lightly over her back and buttocks, making her sigh in contentment. Reluctantly, he spoke. "You should return to the ball."</p><p>She groaned displeasure at the idea, but knew he was right. "I know."</p><p>"Lucius will be seeking you out. He can't know. I would…worry."</p><p>She nodded against his sticky chest. "I don't suppose this can happen again, can it?"</p><p>"It can't?" He tilted her chin up. "I try not to consider impossibilities prematurely."</p><p>Her eyes moistened. "Thank you. For so much."</p><p>He kissed her, closed his eyes. A very small regret tinged his words. "Don't thank me."</p><p>She returned to the party first, charms having brought her back to an illusion of normality. She caught sight of her husband dancing with her sister and felt a little bile rise up in her throat. Then she caught sight of Severus, entering the hall from the eastern archway, and the bile turned to triumph. One little victory…and one great pleasure. She hoped deeply it wouldn't be the last.</p>
