    <p align="justify">In an alternate universe, during the summer of 1996, Draco Lucius Malfoy, sixteen years old, kneeled in front of Lord Voldemort, gritted his teeth, and accepted the searing pain of the Dark Mark while his father screamed between the cold walls of an Azkaban cell.</p><p align="justify">In this universe, Draco Sirius Black drew and magically animated a picture of Lord Voldemort dancing the Macarena, then stuck it to the wall of a bedroom he had been sharing with his boyfriend for ten months. Here, Draco had two baby brothers who were fascinated by the colour of his hair and enjoyed pulling on it. He was a weasel Animagus, had a NEWT in Defence, Potions and Charms, blew up a microwave, created a cloud that was still hanging around four weeks after it spawned, hung out with a portrait of James, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter and had earned his moped license.</p><p align="justify">More importantly, he was completely, hopelessly in love with his long-time rival who was, right at this moment, grabbing onto his waist and pressing his body against him while Draco drove along the fjord. Before they left in the morning to spend the day in the nearest town, they had to ensure that Draco’s mother was too busy to stop them. She hated seeing him use any kind of Muggle transportation, calling them death traps, yet she had no trouble watching him play Quidditch. Sometimes, Draco wondered how she would have handled life at the Tranquil Spire Hotel before Astoria Greengrass’ accidental magic fried all electronics in the building and forced the residents to start using magic again.</p><p align="justify">In a way, this magical incident had been a blessing. Narcissa suffered from post-traumatic stress after her ordeal at the hands of Lucius and Voldemort, and she needed the familiarity of domestic spells and House Elves cleaning and cooking by snapping their fingers. The teenagers missed movie night and especially music, so when Sirius was available, he tinkered with every apparatus and attempted to make them work in a magical setting. He had done it with a motorcycle, so hopes were high. Theo couldn’t wait to start cooking the Muggle way again; Draco thought he was weird, but then again, he was still intimidated by the kitchen and the stupid fire sprinklers, so perhaps the Nott heir wasn’t that odd.</p><p align="justify">The motor of the blue moped sputtered, and Draco parked in front of a small supermarket, removing his helmet and letting Harry play with his hair until it was no longer plastered to his scalp. Without his helmet, Harry looked like something had exploded on his head. With his new square frameless glasses, longer hair and his growth spurt, his appearance made Draco’s knees go weak. Draco had grown up as well and was still taller than Harry. Sometimes, Daphne and Millicent pretended to faint and batted their eyelashes at them because they knew it annoyed their friends. Too bad Blaise was back in Italy for the summer; he was allergic to these ridiculous displays and provided amusing reactions.</p><p align="justify">The couple walked side by side, hands brushing against each other, and browsed the aisles looking for snacks. This supermarket was the only shop selling a certain kind of dried fish that Kreacher adored. Sirius didn’t understand why Draco would buy something for the aged House Elf.</p><p align="justify">The boy grabbed three packs, and Harry readjusted his grip on the plastic basket. “You know he’s just going to hide those things inside Sirius’ shoes, right?”</p><p align="justify">“It’d make him happy.” Draco frowned at the ingredients listed on a can of soda, happy to understand Norwegian quite well to be able to stop buying things that could send him into an early grave. He still loved candy, but he now stuck with those created in the Wizarding World.</p><p align="justify">“Aw, look at you, caring so much for a House Elf’s well-being.”</p><p align="justify">With a smirk, Draco winked playfully. “Your best friend doesn’t need any reason to punch me again. I am merely preparing myself to join S.P.E.W.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re buying Hermione’s respect? With dried cod?”</p><p align="justify">“I am a Slytherin.”</p><p align="justify">Harry rolled his eyes and put a box of Earl Grey in the basket. Draco immediately put it back on the shelf and made a face. “Really, tea bags?”</p><p align="justify">“We’re out!”</p><p align="justify">“This is treason, and you know it. Tea bags, honestly.”</p><p align="justify">“Have you seen your mother when she hasn’t had her tea in the morning?”</p><p align="justify">“Mother is a refined woman who will make you regret buying those things for the rest of your life. Loose leaf, thank you very much.”</p><p align="justify">With a broad gesture encompassing the packed shelves and small bakery, Harry looked at him expectantly, and Draco let out a long sigh. “Very well, I see what you mean. Let’s go to the tea shop.” As soon as he said it, he cringed. “Merlin, no, forget I said that. I am not riding back to town at this hour.”</p><p align="justify">By the time they’d get there, traffic would be too stressful for a new rider. They’d have to go without Earl Grey for a day at the very least. How dreadful. He fought to keep his eyes open when Harry nuzzled the back of his neck and nipped at his skin, and he elbowed him in the ribs. “Not here.”</p><p align="justify">“Spoilsport.”</p><p align="justify">They paid for the fish and two fresh ham sandwiches and spoke briefly with the cashier, Marie, a teenager with a prosthetic hand who liked to practice her English each time they shopped there. Draco was rather interested in the way Muggles treated disability, though he was trying not to be insensitive when he let himself ask questions. Admittedly, it was a rare occurrence. Marie bagged their purchases, thanked them, and they went back outside, squinting in the bright sunlight.</p><p align="justify">They were on the road for twenty minutes before the wards around the hotel shimmered and let them in, and they stopped at the edge of the orchard bordering the entrance. With their helmets off, they walked among the trees and sat at a wooden table installed there around Easter. Hedwig landed near them and preened her feathers.</p><p align="justify">They unwrapped their sandwiches and ate quietly, sharing bits of ham with the owl. Harry ran the tip of his foot up and down Draco’s lower leg, and Draco thought about his luck, blushing like an idiot when his eyes met beautiful green irises.</p><p align="justify">He heard Sirius’ van faintly, the noise muffled by the trees. As much as he wanted to greet his adoptive father who had been away with Dumbledore for a week, he also wished no one would come into their bubble right now. So, he finished his sandwich, took Harry’s hands and softly kissed his fingers over and over again.</p><p align="justify">“Well, well, well, aren’t they cute?”</p><p align="justify">He tightened his grip suddenly, and Harry tried to move away. Turning around, Draco stared at the girl who had rudely interrupted them. Pansy had become a beautiful woman in the past year and looked quite sophisticated in her Muggle attire.</p><p align="justify">Granger’s hair was just as wild as ever, but she was growing into it, from what Draco could see before she launched herself at Harry with a squeal of delight and hugged him tight enough to make a twinge of jealousy flare within Draco’s chest. He stomped on it thoroughly, stood up, and lightly kissed his best friend’s cheeks, holding her hands.</p><p align="justify">Pansy rolled her eyes, snatched her hands back and grabbed him in a headlock, messing with his hair until he begged for mercy. “You look like you have a stick up your arse. Didn’t you learn to be a functioning human being out here?”</p><p align="justify">When she let go of him, he tried to flatten his hair. “I’ll have you know that my greetings were entirely proper!”</p><p align="justify">“Shut up and hug me!”</p><p align="justify">He let himself be squeezed and berated once again for scaring her with his vanishing act, lack of letters and supposed death. He ducked when she attempted to hit him, but she still managed to kick his shin. Hissing in pain, he hurried back to Harry’s side. The other boy was looking at him with an amused smirk twisting his lips, free from Granger’s grasp.</p><p align="justify">He hesitated and met the girl’s gaze. “Granger.”</p><p align="justify">“Mal— Black.”</p><p align="justify">“I apologise for the slurs I threw at you in the past. It was cruel and uncalled for, and I hope you can forgive me.”</p><p align="justify">She held out her palm with a curt nod. “I understand, and I forgive you, but don’t slip again.”</p><p align="justify">Draco steeled himself, shook her hand and finally smiled, Harry’s arm around his waist. He then Vanished the sandwiches wrapping, and Granger (no, Hermione, he had to change his habits) stared at him in horror. “Why are you using magic outside of school?”</p><p align="justify">“This <em>is</em> a school. Technically everything I’m doing within the wards is completely legal.”</p><p align="justify">“What?”</p><p align="justify">“Let’s go inside,” Harry proposed.</p><p align="justify">“Harry James Potter, you have a lot of explaining to do!”</p><p align="justify">Hedwig landed on Draco’s shoulder, and they walked towards the edge of the orchard. Harry took his helmet but didn’t put it on. “I’ll walk with them. See you in a minute?”</p><p align="justify">After making a show of kissing him deeply, Draco straddled his moped, fastened his helmet under his chin and left the trio behind, riding towards the parking where Sirius’ van stood all by itself. The man was still outside and waved cheerfully.</p><p align="justify">“I thought they’d arrive later tonight,” Draco mused after a short embrace from his adoptive father.</p><p align="justify">“Tonks had some free time to Portkey us back here. How have you been? You’re tanned.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m almost always outside.”</p><p align="justify">The man smiled wistfully. “Aaah, I’ll get you a motorcycle when you’re older and then you’ll see that it’s even more addictive. Anyway, I’m starving. Where’s Harry?”</p><p align="justify">“Walking with the girls. Hopefully, they don’t eat him alive. How was your little vacation with the Headmaster?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius shook himself like Padfoot and shuddered dramatically. “If I tell you your godfather was there for most of it, is that enough for you?”</p><p align="justify">It certainly wasn’t, but Draco understood the need for absolute secrecy and didn’t ask for more. They both made their way inside, and Sirius went upstairs. Draco left his helmet on the small table near the entrance, stretched his back and called Kreacher, who cried in pure bliss when he received his dried fish. Toppy was next, and he asked her to prepare some tea—sadly not Earl Grey—if they still had any that wasn’t an insult to his delicate sense of taste.</p><p align="justify">Millicent walked by, humming a song by Abba and wearing a hideous tank top with a hole on the side. She was helping Flitwick paint the walls on the upper floors and dressed to fit the activity. Through the open door of the lounge area, he spied the Greengrass sisters sprawled on the floor, playing with Cepheus and Hydrus under Narcissa’s watchful eyes. Theo was probably cooking or reading outside, and Terence most likely stayed in the infirmary since his Healer apprenticeship had already started.</p><p align="justify">Draco found himself wishing Susan would come back from her travels with her aunt soon; he liked ranting with her for hours on end about foolish things that usually garnered little attention from Harry.</p><p align="justify">He greeted James Potter, who was wandering in a painting depicting longships resting on a rocky beach and sent a quick spell at his hair to make himself more presentable.</p><p align="justify">“Oh my God, Harry, is that your father?”</p><p align="justify">Ah, just in time for Storm Granger. The bookworm ran towards the frame. Pansy noticed Millicent and dragged her away, talking so fast that Draco decided to focus on Harry.</p><p align="justify">Harry was excitedly explaining how the portrait had been found. If possible, Draco fell even deeper in love with him at that moment.</p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify">Hermione’s first reaction upon seeing the van Sirius drove to the Portkey landing site had been one of complete bafflement. She was still trying to smother her thirst for exploration after their temporary stop in Wizarding St. Petersburg and was getting tired of being surprised.</p><p align="justify">The Wizarding World was so much bigger than she had ever imagined. When she had received her Hogwarts letter in September of 1990, she’d had a year to prepare herself before attending Hogwarts. Being eleven a few weeks after the school year had already started, gave her a distinct advantage over people like Harry, who had just one month to get used to the idea.</p><p align="justify">She visited Diagon Alley more than once and read everything she could about the school. Hogwarts: A History was her first purchase and the Holy Grail of Wizarding Society. Or so she thought. Dating a girl from a Dark-aligned family with a long history had shown her she knew next to nothing, and it hadn’t been a pleasant discovery.</p><p align="justify">She had made the mistake of believing she was dealing with people who merely had more abilities than Muggles and dwelt in a secretive society with barely any difference to her own. She had never considered that, while located in the same country, the British Wizarding World was a completely different culture. She had arrived stomping like an elephant with her habits and ideas, and had never, at any point, guessed that she might be offending people by acting like she knew everything when she had barely scraped the surface.</p><p align="justify">It had been an uneasy wake-up call, and she had been angry. Hogwarts: A History was no longer a valid source of information. It was biased and limited. It had useful parts, for sure, but it was Ministry-approved and thus, as Pansy would say, a stinky pile of crap.</p><p align="justify">Now, Hermione wanted to bring in the good things of Muggle society—science, children and women’s rights and so much more. She had access to numerous sources through the members of the Defence Club, had spoken with many Purebloods, Half-Bloods and Muggleborns, Light and Dark, and found that they had several common goals. If they worked together, they could keep their good traditions alive and move forward at the same time. Their generation could change everything.</p><p align="justify">The first time she had learned that there were more than three magical schools in the world, she had felt like a complete idiot and had been consumed with righteous fury, amusing Pansy to no end. Now she knew there were many witches and wizards around the world and many different ways to learn, and Hogwarts had not been the best school for a very long time.</p><p align="justify">So, it was with a certain dizziness that she listened to Harry explain that no, he hadn’t been hiding here and twiddling his thumbs, but that the residents of the Tranquil Spire Hotel had built a school.</p><p align="justify">She was still shocked about seeing Draco ride a moped, but she could only gape and stare when her best friend broke the news. She and Pansy were sitting together in a gorgeous garden under a canopy, a white cat named Perseus purring at their feet. Theodore Nott had baked several different kinds of biscuits and had quickly disappeared after greeting them, supposedly because he was busy experimenting with food. Hermione was introduced to Daphne, Astoria and Millicent since she barely knew them at all, and Harry poured them some tea.</p><p align="justify">“That’s just peach-flavoured green tea. We’re out of everything else,” he explained, smiling sheepishly.</p><p align="justify">“He wanted to buy tea bags! Ouch, Merlin, don’t pinch me!”</p><p align="justify">The bushy-haired girl snorted behind her palm, watching them in fascination. Who would have guessed they could ever be a couple? Pansy had known. Instinct, she had said, from the moment she had read the first letter signed with “Pronglet and Draco”.</p><p align="justify">She tried to get the conversation back on track because her curious mind was screaming. “You were saying something about your school?”</p><p align="justify">Harry nodded proudly, twisted his body around and pointed at the building close to the cliff. “Lilium School for Magic! Where we get core classes and spend way too much time in self-study and tutoring sessions.”</p><p align="justify">“You, Harry Potter, who chose Divination because it was an easy class, are actually studying of your own free will?”</p><p align="justify">“He learned from his numerous mistakes,” Draco said, running a hand in his boyfriend’s hair. “Besides, he’s almost done. Mister I-have-twenty-one-NEWTs.”</p><p align="justify">Millicent cackled. Hermione and Pansy looked at each other, frozen. A minute later, they both stood up as one, spilling tea all over the table and screeching loud enough to scare every bird lurking in the trees around them.</p><p align="justify">They demanded to see the results, stunned when Draco revealed he had a few NEWTs himself, and Hermione understood she was missing something as soon as she glanced at the parchment. Harry had never been dumb, but he wasn’t a dedicated learner either and rarely did his homework without asking her for help. Ron’s laziness, his upbringing—that he didn’t mention often, but hinted at enough to paint a nasty picture—and the weight of Wizarding Britain’s expectations from their Saviour could all be blamed for his lacklustre performance. Nobody ever bothered to teach him useful things either. He was an excellent example of why Muggleborns and Muggle-raised children needed to follow an introductory course about their new world.</p><p align="justify">Here, he was surrounded by people who enjoyed learning, and he was free. It still didn’t explain how he could get a NEWT in Arithmancy though! Her confusion must have shown, because Harry and Draco spoke in hushed tones and she heard them mention that, as they were under a Fidelius, they could explain. Neither Hermione nor Pansy would be able to discuss their secrets to an outsider.</p><p align="justify">She could never have guessed the truth behind Harry’s miraculous NEWTs scores. Pansy looked horrified, and Hermione had to be hugged and comforted until she could stop crying.</p><p align="justify">Later that day, alone in a nicely designed room, she struggled to fall asleep. She felt overwhelmed and hoped the next few weeks wouldn’t be so intense. She and Pansy would stay until the beginning of August, giving her plenty of time to discover the library and more importantly, enjoy her best friend’s company. She had never expected to like Draco, but he was quite frankly hilarious and cared deeply for Harry. Her friend was in good hands. She was looking forward to speaking with Draco; he was, after all, the best student in Hogwarts aside from herself. Their other halves had already lamented over the fact that they would likely bond and never stop discussing books.</p><p align="justify">Indecisiveness tugged at Hermione regarding Lilium and Beauxbâtons. But as much as the miniature school tempted her, she still felt like the French establishment would be the better choice in the long run. Surely, having her exams accredited by such a highly reputable school would be helpful in the future.</p><p align="justify">She tossed and turned, and when she realised sleep would not come, she grabbed Harry’s Dark Arts textbook and started to learn something new.</p>
