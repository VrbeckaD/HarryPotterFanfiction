    <p>Freak arrived from school, later than Dudley, of course. He had to spend a while focusing his powers on himself to be able to move. </p><p>He knew what his name was. He knew he wasn't "freak" as that wasn't a name. But he identified with the word. So he called himself that. </p><p>"BOY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STANDING AROUND THERE!? GO MAKE US DINNER!" Shouted his Uncle. And Freak suppressed a sigh. A sigh would earn him beating which he didn't want on top of a session of "Harry hunting." And the less he thought of that game, the better. </p><p>So, he got to the kitchen, where his aunt was reading a book and sipping tea, although that didn't stop her from sneering at him. 'normal people don't sneer, pet.' he thought in his head and felt his lips curl into a smile, one he quickly squashed. He had long since learned that any emotion showed meant another insult. Which always had the potential to escalate into things he didn't particularly want to remember. </p><p>He opened the fridge and turned on the stove, he pulled the steak towards him with his powers, he reveled in the tingling of life, of power in his hand. His powers had always given him tingles as he used them. He had learned to ignore the tingles when necessary but he had also learnt when to simply enjoy the unique feeling of it. </p><p>He let his mind wander as he put the steak on the stove and got out the vegetables. He knew that everything wasn't supposed to be like this. He knew he was a child and children shouldn't be forced to cook, let alone beaten and "starved". He had, of course. Tried to go to the teachers, and when they waved him off on Petunia's word of him being a liar and an attention seeker. He tried the police. He was aware of a social worker coming in that day, and remembered uncle Vernon fuming as she left. The fact that he didn't remember the rest meant that he was probably beaten to an inch of his life. </p><p>"Obviously that's how they get their exercise. By beating me up." he growled to himself, he flinched when his aunt started screeching at him, however. </p><p>"You insolent brat! How dare you talk like that about my duddykins!" He heard his aunt getting up and jumped back from the stove. He tried to get some words out, anything out to pacify the woman, but he heard the creaking of the chair inside of the living rooms and the steps of the great walrus. </p><p>"What's going on, pet?" The great whale remarked and blood rushed towards Freak's ears. The pounding of blood and the paralysing fear stopped him from hearing his aunt's reply, but he could see it wasn't something in his favor, could feel the earth trembling as his Uncle stomped over to him, and loomed over his 6 year old body. </p><p>His ears were then deafened by his Uncle's shouting, rather than the pounding of blood. </p><p>"FREAK! HOW DARE YOU CALL MY BOY SUCH THINGS! WHY I SHOULD JUST THROW YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE!" He remarked, before grabbing his collar and raising him to be eye level. Freak struggled, trying to get himself free, out of the sheer terror of the moment. The monster stared at him and in his unwilling glance, he saw the going of glee at it's face. </p><p>He felt the first hit on his abdomen. It felt like the force of a car crashing onto him and knocking his lungs out of him. He doubled over as much as he could in his Uncle's grip, he was then struck on the side of his head while his uncle grumbled and shouted in glee, drowning out the cries of pain and the tortured apologies Freak heard himse spout. He was then thrown against the wall, something cracked, his uncle shouted some more, and left. </p><p>Pain... It bloomed everwhere on his body. It ached and hurt, and he wanted it all to just end. He hadn't even meant to say what he said aloud, not had he meant for his aunt to hear it. He felt the tears try to make themselves known, and blinked rapidly to clear them away. He couldn't cry. He wouldn't cry infront of his aunt, who had taken over cooking and was throwing him satisfied glances every now and then. </p><p>He laid there, against the wall for a while. He didn't know how long. Aunt Petunia had finished making dinner and called for the rest of the family. </p><p>Dudley came in first and made a show of looking around, eyes on the food. Freak couldn't supress his breathing, no matter how he tried and that got the baby whale's attention. The whale's eyes immediately got a lot more livelier as he came over and kicked him in the gut. Freak groaned at the pain, while Dudley demanded his father carry him out of here. </p><p>Uncle Vernon looked at him and simply said. </p><p>"Crawl back to your cupboard, boy. We don't eat with freaks here." </p><p>He braced himself. He got up, because he knew that if he stayed. Another beating was coming. </p><p>He put one foot in front of the other, pain shot through him. But he gritted his teeth. He would do this, no matter what his body was screaming at him. Because he didn't want to be beat up again, he didn't want to see the glint of glee in his Uncle's eyes. </p><p>He made it back to his cupboard. He was exhausted, he was dizzy, he was aching, he was in pain. And all he wanted to do was to crawl into a hole and die. But he couldn't. He wouldn't. </p><p>He directed his powers through himself, starting out from his head, and he immediately felt better. His dizziness subsided, some cracks were heard from his body and the aches lessened. But he was even more exhausted as a result of it. Pinprickles surrounded his head and he knew this was because he used up so much power in fixing himself. </p><p>He was about to use even more, However. He put his hands on his head and sent the magic through there and directed it to the depths of his mind. Taking him along with it.  </p><p>He materialized in the schools library, or at least what that looked like in his head. He was safe, he wasn't aching. And he wasn't hurt. This was a place where he couldn't every be Hurt. Because this was his own place, one granted to him by his powers. He commanded his body to lay down and started to explore the library while he wondered about his power. </p><p>He knew his power was immense, it could do practically anything, from making wherever this was, to summoning flames and making cuts. He wasn't sure just what his power was, though. There wasn't any real title he could give his powers, like invisibility, or flame summoning, because he could do both of them. Granted invisibility had only happened once, when he was caught pulling some food towards him by a few police officers. </p><p>He hummed, and picked out a book. The librarian of the school had been warned against him, just the same as the entire neighborhood, that he was a criminal, a liar, a cheat. And a thief. While he was a thief, that was because the Dursleys had given him no choice by trying to stave him. </p><p>So, he had found a solution. He had forced his mind to memorize each page of the books while invoking his power. At first he had thought it was useless. That his power just didn't do that. He couldn't just read books by flicking through the pages. But he had felt his power doing... Something. </p><p>He had tried for weeks after that, and in the end came up with he solution of putting the books into his mind like they were pictures, and reading them from there. And his power had formed this place as time passed<br/>
on. </p><p>He got to the ends of the library and pulled out a book. He had read almost all of the library with his trick and this was one of the never ones, being a Detective Fiction he heard it was argued about a lot whether or not it should be at the library of a school. People had argued about it being not safe for children to read, and other people had argued that the older kids needed to learn culture. </p><p>He just wanted to learn, so with that. He sat down and began to read. </p><p>...</p><p>He had read for a long time, and was pretty sure who the killer was. She had, after all. Been all too proud of herself for seemingly nothing, and the death of her grandfather would allow her to void her own marriage contract. He wasn't suprised when the detective announced her the killer. And he chuckled at himself for getting it right again. He loved this book. He closed his eyes and let his mind wander, the book in his lap. </p><p>Oh how he had wished that it was his uncle or aunt that was announced the killer. That would take them away from. His life completely. That would make him fr-</p><p>One thought froze him. Why couldn't he be the killer. And the Dursleys victims? He had power. He was good at hiding himself and evidence of something without his powers so... </p><p>His heartbeat picked up, his blood burned and his mind churned. He could. He could actually kill them. He could easily make his powers cut their throats, and he could do it now. He could- he could- </p><p>BANG BANG </p><p>"FREAK! GET UP! IM GOING SHOPPING AND YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY THE BAGS" he faintly heard his aunt screech, so he got out of his own mind and onto his body. Which he discovered was also breathing as fast as he did and was still feeling sore from last night. </p><p>He got up, sighing and pushing open the door, his aunt simply sneered at him then walked away. Freak made to follow her, all the while the idea of killing the Dursleys jumped around in his mind. He sighed. </p><p>This was going to be a long day.</p>
