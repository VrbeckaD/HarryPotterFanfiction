    <p>Geoff the Valiant paused and breathed heavily, his long trek behind him yet his greatest challenge ahead.</p><p>He had been walking for days now with his merry band of fellow adventurers across uncountable hazards and dangers. From dungeons containing undead nightmares to the rotten underbelly of cities built on crime, no hardship was to small to overlook nor to great to stop our heroes. Looking around at his friends, he could clearly see they were exhausted but just as ready for battle as if they had just awoken.</p><p>Geoff wore the battle scarred armour of the Glophasrian Knightly Order. Over his mildly dented and scratched suit of plate armour hung a cloak of fur from a dire wolf to keep the biting cold of the mountains at bay. His most prized possession, the greatsword given to him by the king on his deathbed, was displayed proudly at his hip. Ever scar, every dent, and every cut on his equipment and person were treated as badges of honour.</p><p>Their journey was almost complete and now only the Tyrant of the Glophasrian Empire remained. They stood just outside the madmans fortress high in the northern mountains. Bitter wind cut into them like a knife, but they ignored it; the only thing that mattered to them was the barred gate in front of them. The Tyrant was inside, likely expecting these intrusive and unwanted guests. The wretch seized control from the people years ago and now his influence hung over the land like a plague. But it ends today.</p><p>”Is everyone ready!?” he shouted to his compatriots.</p><p>”AYE!” came a roar from the assembled warriors.</p><p>”Right then!” Geoff unsheathed his greatsword and faced the gates, “We end this here and now!”</p><p>They charged the fortress, some screaming their final battle cry.</p><p>Abruptly, they stopped in confusion when a glowing turquoise oval of magic manifested in their path.</p><p>Some of the warriors raised their shields, wary that this was just an illusion from the Tyrant.</p><p>”Hold steady!” ordered Geoff.</p><p>A man stepped out of the portal. He was dressed... unusually. He wore a simple hooded shirt of grey with a black line running from his left shoulder to left hip. His trousers resembled those of a soldier; designed to endure hard conditions without tearing. Most prominently, a satchel was slung across his body and rested just below his right hand.</p><p>”Okay then, this makes it easy.” the stranger muttered as he saw the band of heroes, “Which one of you is...”</p><p>The man paused. Hastily, he rummaged through the pockets on his pants before producing a notebook. He flipped to one of the first pages and pointed to something written.</p><p>”...Geoff the Valiant?”</p><p>”Stand down.” Geoff strode forward, lowering his weapon, “That would be I, Wizard, Geoff the Valiant, Knight of the Glophasrian Empire, Hero of the Northlands, Defender of-“</p><p>”Okay, shut up for a second.” the stranger held up his hand, “I just needed your name.”</p><p>”Why is that?” Geoff asked, “Have you come to join our crusa-“</p><p>Geoff was cut off by a loud and powerful bang. Blood sprayed onto the shields and faces of the gathered warriors as Geoff’s limp body slumped to the ground backward, a small hole in his forehead.</p><p>The dumbstruck adventurers looked at the stranger who had some small metal weapon levelled with their heads. Lowering the weapon, he took out a pencil and crossed something out in his notebook.</p><p>”And that takes care of that!” the man held the weapon up once again, “Now, where’s this Nikolai of Charetton?”</p><p>About twenty minutes later, Dave Fredericks was sitting on the throne of the Tyrant of the Glophasrian Empire. The body of the demon looking bad guy or whatever was crumpled on the ground and serving as a leg rest. The party of heroes was scattered around here and there in the throne room. Dave honestly expected more from level 10 D&amp;D characters. Dave had finished reloading and cleaning his favourite magnum revolver and had put it back in his Bag of Holding and was now flipping through his notebook for another name.</p><p>The notebook was filled cover to cover with names on both sides. Some were already crossed out, but an overwhelming majority were still left unmarked. This wasn’t an easy or particularly normal hobby, but it was damn good fun.</p><p>He picked out another name: Kirito “Edgelord McGee.”</p><p>Pulling out his revolver, Dave held up a device with a small keyboard and screen on one side and pointed it in front of him. Another portal opened up. Dave got to his feet, checked the gun was fully loaded, and took a happy stride into the next universe.</p><p>This was damn good fun indeed.</p>
