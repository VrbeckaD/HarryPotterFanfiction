    <p>Teddy “falls” down the stairs sometime after dinner. Harry is playing chess with Sirius in the lounge. They have a perfect view of the foyer and therefore the staircase, but neither move to help his godbrother.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you check if he’s alive?”</p>
<p>“And give you a chance to switch round pieces? I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“Your son could be seriously injured. Besides, why should you be nervous about this game? I’m pants at Wizard’s chess.”</p>
<p>“Even more reason for you to cheat, Prongslet. Ted will walk again. Remus will make sure of it.”</p>
<p>“What will I make sure of?”  Remus asks peeking out of the kitchen. Before either can respond, he spots the child-shaped lump at the foot of the staircase and sighs.</p>
<p>“Family,” Teddy announces as Remus peels him from the ground and checks him for bruises. Teddy’s got his fake formal voice on. It’s usually reserved for when he wants to seem mysterious or feel older or has done something that will get his <em>Mage of Life</em> comics taken away. “I am experiencing extreme melnan - mele - melancholy.”</p>
<p>Remus rolls his eyes and drops the metamorphmagus onto the couch before going back into the kitchen. Teddy buries his face into the cushions. Harry takes pity on him.</p>
<p>“You fall down the stairs every day, bud. It’s not even embarrassing anymore.”</p>
<p>Harry keeps his eyes on the board as he speaks. Afterall, if anyone’s going to cheat at Wizard’s chess, it’s Sirius Black. His godfather hums in agreement and promptly steals Harry’s last knight. Another sigh from the eleven-year-old goes ignored.</p>
<p>It’s only when Teddy rolls onto the floor like dead weight and jostles their table that Sirius and Harry look up from their game. At the same time. Of course. Teddy’s hair is an overly morose grey and he’s wearing one Sirius’ Queen t-shirts, most likely because it’s the single piece of black clothing he could find in their home. Sirius lets out an overly dramatic gasp and leaps up to clutch Teddy to his chest, spinning him around the room.</p>
<p>“My innocent son, gone too soon!” he cries. Harry laughs at the scene before him, even if it’s somewhat ruined by the so-called deceased son giggling into his father’s chest. “If only someone had listened to his cries for help!”</p>
<p>“If only someone hadn’t taught him to be so dramatic,” Remus quips as he saunters back into the room with two mugs of tea. He hands one to Harry before curling into the armchair by the bookshelf. </p>
<p>Sirius and Teddy both let out identical gasps of indignation. For a brief moment, Harry can see the resemblance between father and son. Of course, Teddy is his godparents’ biological son, but when he’s not turquoise with rabbit ears, he mostly looks like Remus.</p>
<p>“I am not a baby, father. I’m almost a grown man.” Teddy huffs, trying to turn his glare on Remus.</p>
<p>“Gasp! He lives!” Sirius cries, showering Teddy with kisses and tickles. Somehow, Teddy breaks free of his dad’s grasp and crawls across the carpet to snuggle into Harry’s side.</p>
<p>“So much for not being a baby,” Sirius snorts, but his eyes are warm as he looks upon the two. Teddy lets out another huff and Harry pulls him closer, burying his nose in his godbrother’s curls for good measure. Teddy doesn’t pull away. He never does when it’s Harry.</p>
<p>“I need comfort right now, okay? That doesn’t make me any less of a man. You’re the one who’s always saying that masculinity is a hedgehog’s prison.”</p>
<p>Sirius bursts into laughter, followed closely by Remus and Harry. Teddy blushes and turns his head away from the group.</p>
<p>“<em>Hegemonic</em>” Sirius corrects gently, after wiping fake tears from his eyes. He then turns to pout at his husband.</p>
<p>“Don’t <em>I </em>get some tea?”</p>
<p>“Don’t <em>you </em>have hands?”</p>
<p>“Harry has hands and he didn’t have to work for his tea.”</p>
<p>“Harry is my son. Did I raise you, Padfoot?”</p>
<p>“No, but I am more than willing to call you daddy if it will get me a cuppa.”</p>
<p>Harry groans, loud, pointed and heavy with disgust. He looks down at Teddy, who <em>thankfully</em> seems to have missed the interaction entirely. Instead, his godbrother gnaws at his bottom lip, brown eyes a little too wet and unfocused. Harry knows more must be bugging him than embarrassment over his poor grammar.</p>
<p>“Hey, bud. What was with the ‘debbie downer’ act earlier? Are you feeling okay?” Harry whispers, letting Teddy decide if this will be a <em>brother talk</em> or a <em>family talk</em>.</p>
<p>“I’m nervous about next week,” Teddy says, loud enough for his fathers to hear.</p>
<p>The two immediately stop flirting in the corner. They turn to their youngest, understandably shocked. Next week, Teddy would be heading to Hogwarts for his first year.  It’s a daunting task for any eleven-year-old, but this was Teddy. He owned every room he walked into. He was already more of a Gryffindor than Harry could ever be.</p>
<p>“What’s making you nervous, love?”  Remus asks. He scooches up in his armchair to make space for Sirius.</p>
<p>“Well I - I - I’ve never been away from dad for so long and I’ve heard Hogwarts has lots of ghosts about and what if I don’t do well in my classes and -” he chokes.</p>
<p>Harry squeezes his shoulders. “You don’t have anything to be afraid of, bud. Moony and I will be there the whole time <em>and</em> you can always sneak into his office to floo-call Padfoot.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Teddy asks. He turns his wet and hopeful eyes from Harry to Sirius</p>
<p>“Of course, teddy bear. I’ll move my bed next to the fireplace, so I never miss a call,” Sirius assures him.</p>
<p>“You’re also a quick learner,” Remus adds. “You’ll learn a lot of interesting things in your classes and we’ll both be there to help you if you fall behind.”</p>
<p>“Definitely,” Harry nods. “Not to mention, most of the ghosts are pretty friendly. I even went to Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party once. Trust me, the scariest thing in that castle is Snape’s hairdo and I’m confident that we can take him out if the situation becomes dire.”</p>
<p>Sirius barks out a laugh, and Teddy joins in, already used to hearing Harry rag on his prickly, potions professor. Remus pinches his husband’s thigh and gets a kiss on his cheek in return.</p>
<p>Harry rolls his eyes. “You two make me sick sometimes, you know?” And sometimes he wanted what they had more than words could express.</p>
<p>“Ahhh don’t fret, Prongslet. I’m sure you’ll get your kiss from Cedric any day now.” Sirius winks at him. Harry’s furious at himself for blushing, but even more furious at himself for drinking so much butterbeer at his birthday party that he had confessed his crush to Sirius.</p>
<p>“We don’t mean to make you uncomfortable Harry.”</p>
<p>“No, Padfoot’s right. I’m just incredibly jealous.” he deadpans, glaring at his smirking godfather.</p>
<p>“Why would you be jealous?” Teddy asks, peering up at Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess, because it would be nice to have someone to love.”</p>
<p>“But <em>I</em> love you. Don’t you have me?” Teddy pouts, genuinely confused.</p>
<p>“Yeah Harry, don’t you love us?” Sirius mocks.</p>
<p>“It’s a different kind of love, bud. Romantic. Like your dads.”</p>
<p>“Why would you want that?” Teddy scrunches up his nose.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t want to end up bitter and alone like Snape.” Harry says, overly solemn. Teddy nods along sagely as if he understands.</p>
<p>“It seems I’ve taken over Lily’s post.” Remus takes a somehow passive aggressive gulp of his tea. “I’m the only thing stopping Black and Potter from having a go at Snape.”</p>
<p>“And I’m sure Evans appreciates it. I’m also sure that James is having a right laugh.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding. Why would my mum defend Snape?”</p>
<p>Remus looks very much like he regrets bringing it up.</p>
<p>“Snape and Lily were…” – he shares a heavy look with Sirius – “close. They knew each other long before her and James could have a civil conversation, really.”</p>
<p>“Close? You mean like they dated?!” Harry can’t be bothered to mask his disgust. His mind is already miles away with scenes of his beautiful mother getting romantic with that greasy bat.</p>
<p>“No no no!” Remus hurries to reassure.</p>
<p>“Give Evans some credit,” Sirius mumbles.</p>
<p>“It’s just complicated because, well, they were friends for a long time and then they weren’t.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Like most conversations about his parents, Harry is eager and wary in equal measure. Teddy stirs in his embrace, sensing Harry’s distress, but remains quiet. Harry suddenly feels guilty that they had interrupted Teddy while he was expressing his concerns. He squeezes his godbrother’s shoulders to let him know he’s not been forgotten.</p>
<p>“They had a falling out. Things were said that you can’t really take back. Then we left school, the war started and …” Harry’s mind fills in the blanks: <em>and his parents got married, had a baby, and were murdered by Lord Voldemort four years later.</em> “Lily was always so forgiving, with all of us, really. She didn’t talk about Snape a lot after, but I got the impression that if she was given the chance… well… I don’t know.” Remus trails off and Sirius rubs his back, uncharacteristically quiet.</p>
<p>Harry’s trying to process this information, when something occurs to him. “What did you mean earlier when you said my parents never had a civil conversation? ”  </p>
<p>“They butt heads a lot at first. James could be ...” Remus hesitates.</p>
<p>“A prat.” Sirius offers, looking more relaxed now that he was talking about his beloved best mate. “Lily wasn’t the biggest fan of our pranks and then there was the Snape of it all, you know. Your mum and dad would get into a lot. They had ‘Ron and Hermione Christmas 1993’ level blowouts every week of our sixth year.”</p>
<p>Harry felt a bit like his world had been tipped on its axis. His godfathers didn’t seem to notice, knee dip in nostalgia.</p>
<p>“What changed?” he presses.</p>
<p>“They did, Harry.” Remus smiles, sad and fond. “People grow up and let go of childish grudges.”</p>
<p> Harry tries to picture the moment his parents fell in love with each other, when they went from hating each other to loving each other.</p>
<p>Was that even possible? Could two people, after years of knowing one another, take a step back and see each other in a completely new light? Harry hopes its true, if not for his parents’ sake, then his own.Images of a lithe, brunette Hufflepuff, come unbidden, if not wholly unwelcome, to his mind.</p>
<p>Harry had thought his feelings for Cedric would go away over the summer, and he would returned for his fifth year calm and collected around the handsome, prefect. If anything, his feelings had amplified. Harry couldn’t wait to see him again, even if Cedric would only ever see him as a little brother of sorts.</p>
<p>“Am I gonna change when I go to Hogwarts?” Teddy pipes up, suddenly. “Like Harry’s other parents?”</p>
<p>“Yes you are, love, and just like them, you’ll change for the best.”</p>
<p>“You think,” – Teddy bounces in Harry lap, eyes light – “do you think I’ll change so much that I’ll want to be friends with Theodore McLaggen?” </p>
<p>Harry laughs and all tension floods out him. Remus pinches the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t bet my money on it,” Sirius quips, earning him an elbow in the stomach from his husband.</p>
<p>“You never know, Ted. Anything is possible.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He’s so annoying and gives ‘Teddys’ everywhere a bad name. I just can’t picture it, dad.”  </p>
<p> “How about you try while you’re taking a bath, hmm?” Remus sighs. He rises from his seat, even as Sirius tugs on the sleeve of his cardigan to keep his husband by his side. Remus takes Harry’s empty mug and nudges Teddy towards the staircase to get ready for bed.</p>
<p>That night, Harry tries to fall asleep for what feels like hours. His mind is so full. He thinks of Teddy spending nights alone in his common room, Lily Evans glaring at James Potter across the Great Hall and the brush of Cedric’s shoulder against his own last spring.  Eventually, he gives into the urge and gets up from bed to sit at his desk. He pulls out a quill and a piece of parchment, and he writes.</p>
<p>
  <em>Snape, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I doubt anything would be different if you had told me you knew my mother. I’m not completely delusional. After all, you’ve known this whole time that I’m her son and still treat me like the runoff from your cauldron. Are you still mad at her, or maybe yourself, for ending the friendship? Is that why you hate me so much? Or is it because of my father, like you always said? I don’t think I’ll ever not be upset by the things you’ve said about him. Even right now, your insults make my blood boil. But I do wish it could’ve been different. I don’t have many people to talk with about her, and it seems like you knew her before everything. My mom forgave my dad for his mistakes, loved him in spite of them. I’ve never been good at being the bigger person, but I’d like to think that if I was ever given the chance, I would be able to forgive you too.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sincerely,<br/>
Harry Potter</em>
</p>
<p>When Harry’s done, he folds up the letter and addresses it to the Hogwarts Potions Master.</p>
<p>Harry pulls his old glasses case from his drawer and sets it on the bed. Hermione had charmed the case to turn into a box that opens for Harry alone. For a moment, Harry sorts through all his letters.</p>
<p>They will never make it to OwlPost.</p>
<p>Harry writes letters when he’s feeling especially furious or grateful or so in love he can’t help himself. Cedric has a letter of course.  It was written while Harry was ugly crying and stuffing his face with treacle tart, after the hufflepuff had shown up to the Yule Ball with his supposed ex-girlfriend Cho Chang. It’s not like Harry had asked him to the ball. He can’t fault Cedric for going back to Cho. Especially because Cho had a letter too. Sure, it accused her of using a love potions to compel Harry to throw his Quidditch matches, but he was thirteen.</p>
<p>Harry’s feelings were all consuming. He would rather get them out on paper than watch them blow up in real life. That’s why even Draco Malfoy had a love letter. That lapse in judgement was the combined product of a Ravenclaw party, his first time trying firewhiskey and the brief but deluded thought that there could be something between the boys other than snark and hexes.</p>
<p> Not all his crushes were so misguided. He had written a letter to his best friend’s little sister Ginny, after one of the many afternoons they’d spent flying in his second year. The following year, he found out that Ginny actually did like him. Sure, it never went anywhere, but they had more of a chance than he did with his best mate’s older brother.</p>
<p>Charlie Weasley’s letter was by far the longest. It detailed every little plan Harry imagined for their future together as a dragon-taming duo. Admittedly, not his best moment.</p>
<p>They weren’t all love letters, either.</p>
<p>Sirius had one from when Harry was eight years old. His godfather had contracted a curse from one of his patients and didn’t wake up for three days straight. Harry used to like visiting his godfather while he was on a shift at St. Mungos, but the boy hasn’t gone back since.</p>
<p>Remus’ letter was an angry, desperate rant. It was written in the midst of his godfather’s six-month campaign to convince werewolves to integrate with other wizards. Harry had been too young to understand this. All he knew was that Remus was gone. Harry had missed him so much and a part of him had never truly forgiven the man for leaving his family behind.</p>
<p><em>I suppose these are just for a different kind of love, </em>Harry thinks. </p>
<p>At the very bottom of the box, there’s a letter for each of his parents, written three years apart. He’s never reread them.</p>
<p><em>So where did that leave Snape’s?</em> He wasn’t a crush or family, just the possibility of a chance at something he could not name. He tucks Snape’s letter somewhere between Charlie and Draco.</p>
<p>Harry’s about to close the box, when he hears his door creak. He looks over to see it hanging open, even though he’s almost positive he closed it before bed. A yawn breaks free from his chest then and he decides to shrug off the mystery. Harry just hopes it was the wind and not the stray tabby that Teddy kept letting in through their kitchen window.</p>
