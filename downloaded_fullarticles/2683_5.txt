          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lily set down the last of the three obsidian ritual knives (carved by hand, untouched by magic, and older than the House of Windsor).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her hands shook slightly as she carefully began to lay out a circle of crosses - each one freshly cut from the trees, one stick of yew and one stick of elder bound together in an ‘x’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had never attempted something like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of her friends from Hogwarts would have found it to be unconscionably Dark.</p>
<p>
  <em>“My family has an odd relationship with Death,” James said sheepishly, shrugging when Lily frowned at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s one of those things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know - Uncle Sharly talks to mountains and castles, Ama can raise firebirds and call lightning, and if you need a bit of help…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>But she was desperate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Five months pregnant and the focus of a prophecy that had already set its claws into her family and <em>ripped</em> -</p>
<p><em>One large gravemarker, three names engraved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three birthdates, one date of death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily refused to look away, even as her eyes teared up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James was crying into her hair, she could tell, and Sirius was as unmoving as the two stone hellhounds that guarded the graveyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mere yards away, Henry and Priya Potter lay at rest, their elaborately carved gravemarker a testament to the firebirds for which the Potter Matriarch had been so famous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only a bit to the left, and the shared grave of Charlus and Dorea Potter was flanked by the grave of </em>their<em> son, Henry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now James and Sirius had lost the last of their family - and James had lost three parents in one day.</em></p>
<p>The war was heating up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no Henry Potter to terrify the Death Eaters away, nor his wife with her firebirds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James’ aunt and uncle were gone, leaving the ancient home of the Potters unspeakably silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their son was gone, too, leaving only James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only James, and Lily, (and Sirius, if they were being honest,) and The Baby.</p>
<p><em>“There are fairy tales about the Cloak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Silly stories about power and stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the Cloak isn’t about power.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s about understanding that we are all </em>equal<em> in the eyes of Death…</em>”</p>
<p>Maybe the rule-following child that she had been at eleven years of age would have flinched away from this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe she might have once flung hateful words in the face of this option.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But those days were long gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Burned away by war and violence, and leaving only silence in return. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Her baby would die.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless…</p>
<p><em>“Granda told me this story from the time I was very small - before I was even really doing accidental magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a bit different from the official one, or even the new translation that Professor Dumbledore did when we were kids.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James took Lily’s hand in his own, staring at the stylized bridge in the center of the Potter Family’s land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It goes like this: Once, not too long ago, three brothers crossed a raging river on a faulty bridge…</em>”</p>
<p>Thirteen crosses made from elder and yew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three obsidian knives, untouched by magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Caller in the center, and the Cloak on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A simple, unadorned Invisibility Cloak, looking all-too-innocent as a piece of silvery cloth, laid out before her feet.</p>
<p>A request.</p>
<p>“Please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily’s voice wavered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know - I know I’m not really a Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not by blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if you’re listening -”</p>
<p>“I’m always listening.”</p>
<p>There was a girl, about her age, seated on the Cloak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dark eyes, dark hair, dark clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A heavy silver ankh hung from around her neck.</p>
<p>“You called?”</p>
<p>Lily shivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>She</em> was terrifying in the sheer simplicity of all of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No huge crashes of magic, no roaring thunder or flashing lights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just - <em>She</em> was there.</p>
<p>“It’s - it’s my baby.”</p>
<p>Death rocked in place, easy movements that could belong to any teenager comfortable in her skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What about him?”</p>
<p>Lily slid to sit on the ground in front of Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s going to die.”</p>
<p>Death leaned forward, tilting Lily’s chin to meet her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Everything does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that’s not why you called me, is it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You <em>want </em>something.”</p>
<p>“A deal.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The words spilled from Lily’s mouth eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know Jamie doesn’t think you do deals, and Sirius thinks that everything is worth a try, but all of the tales say you might.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just - that you might make a deal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My life, for my baby.”</p>
<p>Death stood up abruptly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s not even born yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t do that kind of thing, in any case.”</p>
<p>“But he <em>will be!</em>”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily shot to her feet, all of the desperate fury that had pushed her to this point boiling forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s my baby, and because some idiot can’t keep his mouth shut, he’ll be killed before he sees his first birthday!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There has to be something, there <em>must</em> be!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You say you don’t do this kind of thing, but you <em>do</em>, don’t you?”</p>
<p>
  <em>“…The bridge split, as they all must do, and the brothers plunged forth to their deaths.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the eldest leapt free, for he had learned Black Magics that made him swifter than any man should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second-born followed, saved by his brother’s powers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The youngest cast himself forward, and clung to his brothers, until they had dragged him free of the river…”</em>
</p>
<p>Death frowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not that simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment here, a moment there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I give you one time, then what about the next?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the next?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I say - fine, your life for your son’s life - what happens after that day?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When his life continues on?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he faces me again?”</p>
<p>Lily shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t - I want him to have a <em>Life</em>.”</p>
<p><em>“…And there stood Death, cloaked in silver, who demanded to know just what they were </em>thinking<em>, to cast themselves unto certain death, and then cheat their day of it’s time…”</em></p>
<p>Death shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A curse for a curse - that I could do, that’s simple protection magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One for one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you won’t be satisfied with that - nobody ever is.”</p>
<p>
  <em>“…And the eldest, who called himself Antioch, drew his wand and told Death that She had no claim on him - he had cheated Her, and he would live that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Death smiled, and asked if he wished for a forfeit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His youngest brother shook his head, backing away. ‘Play not the games of the Endless, brother,’ he warned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘We all know better.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p><em>“But Antioch laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘I have </em>beaten<em> the Endless!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would show the world that I have done so!’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so he demanded his forfeit - an unbeatable wand, to show his power over even Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smiled, and nodded, and lifted a stick of Elder from the ground, handing it to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so the Elder Wand was born…”</em></p>
<p>Lily felt tears spill down her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just want my baby to <em>live</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s been painted as a target before he was even <em>born</em>!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just want him to have a chance!”</p>
<p>Death scowled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“For every boon there is a price - and lives are priceless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would you have your own life, however many years it might be, cast aside for a handful of weeks for your son?”</p>
<p>Lily looked up at Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The coldness that had waited quietly in her soul for this very day, drew forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I would give my years, and any year given by my family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’re bound by oath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I to James, and Sirius, and Sirius and James to Remus and Peter, and Alice to me, and Frank to Alice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any of us would give - should give.”</p>
<p>
  <em>“…And the second brother, called Cadmus, who saw that his brother had won such a prize - he, too fell prey to desire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even as his younger brother asked him to come away, to be pleased with the life he had stolen as his own, Cadmus turned to Death and demanded his dead betrothed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Death refused - those who leave for the sunless lands, at their time, they do not return.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he demanded a way to speak with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Death handed him a stone, a pebble, from the river’s bank, and told him that he could speak to any soul in the sunless lands, should he but turn the stone thrice in his hand…”</em>
</p>
<p>Death sat back down on the Cloak, twisting the fabric in Her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t make deals.”</p>
<p>Lily licked her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But what about facilitating a gift?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A gift of life, freely given?”</p>
<p>
  <em>“…And the second brother was satisfied, and he left, the newly born Resurrection Stone in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which left the last, the youngest, who still went by the name his mother had given him, though his baptismal name was Ignatius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He, who called himself Aodhan, shook his head when Death raised an inquisitive brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘I shan’t play games with one of the Endless, My Lady, though your gift is kind when the time has come.’</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Death smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Canny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You saw what your brothers did not?’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She drew her cloak from her shoulders as she spoke.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Aodhan held out a hand, and took the proffered cloak, folding it over his elbow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘If today is my time, then escaping the river does nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I live on through today, then it was not my time to follow You.’</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Death smiled…”</em>
</p>
<p>“A gift of life, freely given?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Death leaned backwards until She was prone on the ground, sprawled like a child across Her Cloak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As much as any Power, a gift could be facilitated.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She hesitated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Especially for a child of the Sparkling Lake.”</p>
<p><em>“…As the day drew into night, Antioch’s boasts were heard by many a passerby, and he continued his boasts at an inn, where he drank his fill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the night, a covetous man slew him, in his sleep, and stole the Magnificent Unbeatable Elder Wand…</em>”</p>
<p>“Thirteen is a very magical number,” Lily said hastily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As is seven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seven people, willing to give, thirteen years from each?”</p>
<p>Death waved a lazy hand in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seven people?”</p>
<p>“Myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got verbal consent from everyone before I even attempted to call you.”</p>
<p>Death swung upwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You didn’t think it would work.”</p>
<p>
  <em>“…On the side of the road, Cadmus stood, for he had not walked far before falling to temptation, calling his beloved back to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He spoke with her for hours upon hours, of all he had done, and their son, whose birth had stolen the life of his mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He drowned in his beloved, though she begged him to stop, for being called to the sunlit lands gave her great pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And while he wallowed, and night fell, a cutpurse came by.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took Cadmus’ purse, his sword, and then his life, before stealing the Stone as well…”</em>
</p>
<p>Lily froze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, I -”</p>
<p>Death hugged her, and Lily couldn’t - quite - understand what was happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Death <em>hugged</em> her. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Life is hurting right now, and <em>anything</em> is worth a try,” Death hummed in Lily’s ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But there are beautiful things, too, and I want you to see them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rain splashing down your back, and the sound of marbles rolling on stone, and the crunch of a really nice apple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Children laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ferris Wheels.”</p>
<p>Lily’s heart <em>hurt</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The words fell from her lips, almost involuntarily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Playing fetch with ridiculously large dogs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Idiots getting their antlers stuck in the doorway and forgetting they can change back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Butterscotch ice-cream with strawberry sauce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schubert’s <em>Ave Maria</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Properly salty peanuts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kisses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Waking up with someone you <em>love</em>…”</p>
<p>“<em>…Aodhan walked home, carrying a Cloak, gifted to him by a smiling Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘No games,’ She had promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he took it home, and swept the Cloak up, and found that it was an Invisibility Cloak like none he had ever seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he kept it a secret, and when he grew old, he gave it to his granddaughter, who had married the Lord of Sparkling Lake, the land where Aodhan had been born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the night after Iolande took her grandfather’s cloak home to Sparkling Lake, Aodhan stepped out of his house, and breathed in the clean air, and smiled at the stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were beautiful, and he told his gooddaughter so before stepping away from the house, and into the arms of a beautiful lady.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>“Aodhan’s gooddaughter demanded to know who had come calling at such a time of night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Lady simply smiled, and said her name was Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even Death, She said, came in person for an old friend.”</em>
</p>
<p>Lily woke up to find the room dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sun had gone down, while she was…sleeping?</p>
<p>Someone had draped the Cloak over her while she slept.</p>
<p>The knives were neatly stacked in a corner.</p>
<p>The crosses of yew and elder were gone. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>
  <em>“My family has an odd relationship with Death,” James said sheepishly, shrugging when Lily frowned at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s one of those things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know - Uncle Sharly talks to mountains and castles, Ama can raise firebirds and call lightning, and if you need a bit of help, you take out the obsidian knives, make a circle of crosses made from yew and elder, and just…ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Granda said She was great at giving you perspective, and helpful when She could be.”</em>
