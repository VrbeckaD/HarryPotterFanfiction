    <p>Harry started laughing, he couldn't help it. He wiped the tears from his eyes as he regained his composure. "I am sorry, could you repeat that as I think I must have heard all of you wrong."</p><p>"We want to start your training to defeat You-Know-Who." Dumbledore stated. </p><p>"Honestly, Harrison, I thought we taught you how to listen." Lily Potter snapped.</p><p>Harry let out a few chuckles as he looked at their faces. His parents, sitting in the pair of high back chairs they always sat in when they were in the Order's headquarters. He was usually only dragged here when people started to wonder where their other child was. His twin brother glaring at him. His brother, Matthew, didn't like this new development. The Hogwarts staff, well, in reality, it was just McGonagall, Snape, Black, and Lupin. The rest of the Order included the Weasley family, some Aurors, and a handful of others.</p><p>"I have spent the last seven years listening to how wonderful Matthew is. How amazing, how smart, how talented, while I didn't even know you knew my name. I mean it wasn't until last week I actually heard you use it." </p><p>"I am sure it's all a misunderstanding." Dumbledore responded. "Now, Kingsley, Mad-Eye, Sirius, Remus, Severus, and your father have all agreed to train you."</p><p>"No." Harry answered. "Let me set the record straight here. First, I was disowned by the Potter family when I was sorted into Slytherin. So while I still have the unfortunate last name of Potter, I am not part of their family. We won't even mention the Dursley family. Second, Snape can't stand me, so I know he didn't volunteer to train me. I have spent the last seven years listening to all the snakes being told they are a family and take care of each other."</p><p>"Exactly, family-" Dumbledore inserted.</p><p>"Wrong. Care to tell them what you told the Slytherin students about me?" Harry looked at Snape, who was furious at being in the meeting. </p><p>"I am sure we can work it out-" Dumbledore tried again.</p><p>Harry laughed. "No, we won't. You see I have spent the last seven years in this school loathed by everyone. My Head of House informed everyone I was there to spy on them for you and James Potter. Therefore, since I was a spy for the Potters and the Headmaster, my disownment was just a ploy to get more information. While the other three houses viewed me as a traitor to their Savior and his parents." Harry glared at the Gryffindors in the room. "You lot certainly did the Marauders proudly, didn't you? Those weekly lessons on prank hexes, jinxes, and curses will serve you well." </p><p>"It was just creative high jinxes." Dumbledore commented. </p><p>"Third, when I did better on my OWLs than my twin and Granger, I got accused of cheating by every single member of the staff here, including my own Head of House. I had to retake them that day. When I still achieved the same results, I was given a truth serum. How did James put it? Yes, his words were, there is no way a pathic excuse of a wizard could beat his son's scores. Lily, of course, was the one who demanded the truth serum."</p><p>"I told you he wouldn't help. He is just like his father, selfish, and arrogant." Snape sneered.</p><p>"That is my cue to leave." Harry stood up. "I would say good luck, but I wouldn't mean it. I do hope you have a better plan than relying on Matthew." </p><p>"You will sit down and do as you're told." James commanded.</p><p>"Sorry, not your son. I am a graduate of Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft. Here is a huge deal breaker for you, I am an of age wizard now." Harry walked to the door, stopped, looked over his shoulder. "The really pathic thing about this whole mess is if one of you had actually cared about me, I might have stayed and helped."</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry was kicking back on the beach, enjoying the sun, when a shadow fell over him. He opened his eyes. "Snape." </p><p>"Potter." Snape arched a brow. "You are wanted back in Scotland."</p><p>Harry let out a snort. "I hope you didn't buy a plane ticket for my return because I am not going back to Scotland." </p><p>"I am aware. However, your father called in my life debt." Snape was actually furious with the whole Order and their schemes. He was sick of what Dumbledore and Potter were doing. He was especially sick of Matthew Potter and his attitude. He loathed Lily Potter and her fame-mongering. </p><p>Harry sat up. "What did the idiot do?" He knew his family was stupid. He hoped they didn't do anything that would ruin his new found freedom. Snape glared but pulled up his sleeve to show his left arm. The dark mark was gone and in its place was a lightning bolt with HP inside of it. "I think you better explain because whatever task he gave you to change your mark and bringing me back to Scotland would be two different things." He was now actually hoping Dumbledore didn't do something extremely stupid.</p><p>"I don't believe I mentioned returning to Scotland." Snape summoned a chair and sat down. "Your father and Dumbledore proved to be bigger idiots than I believed possible." </p><p>"Why doesn't that surprise me?" Harry knew how awful his family was. "Wait, you aren't being caustic, demeaning, or even sarcastic. What happened?" </p><p>Snape inhaled. "It's a long story. Do you want to speak of it here or go and get comfortable elsewhere?"</p><p>"Might as well go inside and get something to eat. I have a feeling I am not going to like what you're going to tell me."</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Snape looked around the little bungalow, it was cool, inviting, and open. He made himself comfortable on a brown wicker couch. "So how bad?" Harry sat in his favorite chair, a light tan wicker chair. </p><p>Snape wasn't sure how to respond to that question. "It will depend on what you decide." His whole life now depended on what Harry decided. He knew the boy wasn't like his family and he wasn't sure how to explain everything. He knew he would have to.</p><p>"What did the morons do now?" He was a bit surprised at his own attitude toward Snape. He never truly hated the man. He actually understood why the man was the way he was. There wasn't a person in his life that didn't use or abuse him in some way, especially his father and Dumbledore. The Marauders were cruel. He had endured what Snape endured without his life being threatened all the time by Death Eater, Voldemort, and anyone who hated Death Eaters.</p><p>"Since they haven't had the official ceremony for graduation, Dumbledore decided that meant you were still a student and as such, he was your magical guardian."</p><p>"How? I thought it was the Head of House?" It was official the lemon drops were rotting Dumbledore's brains. He wondered if Dumbledore's grey matter was actually now yellow.</p><p>"No, we are considered to be absentia parentes until the parent or guardian arrives during a time of crisis." </p><p>"Great, so as my magical guardian is he ordering my return?" Harry was wondering how legal this was actually. The goblins would be able to find out for him.</p><p>"It is worse. Dumbledore, Black, and Potter worked out this incredible moronic plan. The first part of it was Dumbledore allowing you to be adopted into the Black family."</p><p>"Great. The Flea-Bitten Mutt is now the Head of my Family." How stupid was his family? How was he even related to them?</p><p>"No, not legally. They didn't have your blood so they could only do a verbal acceptance. You would need to return before your next birthday for it to be enforced. Now, if you return after the year, accept it, you become official Black Lord. You won't be the heir because you can call on a magical judgment based on trying to do an illegal blood adoption. It's not well-known family law. I think they are counting on us not knowing it. Granger, I believed researched it. Now, Dumbledore and Potter decided it was time to call in my Life Debt." Snape wanted to strangle the Potter, Black, and Dumbledore.</p><p>"What Life Debt?" His father and Dumbledore expected him to believe their latest plot. </p><p>Snape explained about the prank by Black. How he was almost attacked by Lupin. Potter arriving at the critical time to save his life.</p><p>"That isn't a valid one unless they-" Harry inhaled. "No, they didn't?"</p><p>Snape nodded. "Dumbledore and Potter used guilt and got Black off. They said it was my word, a half-blood against two high-ranking pure-blood families." He worked hard on keeping the bitterness out of his voice over the years. He wanted to make Black pay.</p><p>It sounded like something Dumbledore would do to protect his Lions. Harry wasn't surprised by it. He had seen Dumbledore try and get him to bend using guilt. Harry closed his eyes. "You will lose your life if I don't return?"</p><p>"Yes, in a way. The exact wording he used was pure Gryffindor.  James stated I am binding Severus Tobias Snape to Harrison James Potter. He will provide a way to bring Harrison Potter back to Scotland." </p><p>Harry smirked. "Oh, the loopholes. I do believe it's time for us to collect some debts."</p><p>Snape grinned. There was a reason why Gryffindors and Slytherins didn't get along. They spent the rest of the night discussing the different events over the last seven years at Hogwarts. There was a lot that Snape didn't realize Dumbledore had done. Harry had explained how often his twin and his friends would use the library and how they weren't quiet about anything. Granger wasn't very subtle about she also researched. They began their own plans and research.<br/>
_________________________________________________________________</p><p>Two weeks later:</p><p>"Look, honey, they even arranged for us to have a driver." A tall man pointed to a guy holding a sign with his name on it. The man had dark curly hair and wore glasses, metal frames and round in shape. They had just collected their luggage from the baggage claim area. </p><p>"I can't believe we won a two week trip to Scotland." The wife, a little shorter, had red hair and carrying a baby. They approached the man holding the sign.</p><p>"Mr. Potter?" A taxi driver asked.</p><p>"Yes. We weren't expecting a taxi to be waiting."</p><p>"I have orders to bring you to a place called the Leaky Cauldron and your party will be waiting for you." </p><p>"Oh, how wonderful." The woman gushed. "Can you believe it, Harry? We are finally here in Scotland."</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>"Severus, do you want another Mimosa?" Harry was pouring himself one. They had been busy the last two weeks. They had looked through a lot of research and people.</p><p>"Yes." Snape was reading the latest issue of Potions Monthly and working on his tan.</p><p>Harry handed one of the Mimosas to Snape. "The plane should have landed two hours ago."</p><p>"I do hope Harrison and Donna Potter have a nice holiday in Scotland." Snape took a sip of his Mimosa. "We should have found a way to get pictures of their reactions when Harrison Potter shows up at the Leaky Cauldron." He knew Black and Potter would pitch a fit in the Leaky Cauldron, Dumbledore would do his grandfather act as he tried to figure out what happened.</p><p>Harry sat down, picked up his book. "I can't wait to see their reaction when we show up next year."</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p>A year later:</p><p>Harry and Severus were sitting in Black Manor when a howler arrived. "HARRISON JAMES POTTER, HOW DARE YOU? YOU HAVE NO RIGHT BLOCKING ME FROM MY ESTATES. THE NERVE, REMOVING ME FROM THE BLACK FAMILY. YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. I DEMAND YOU FACE ME, AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR ACTIONS. Your parents and I are very disappointed in you." Black's voice filled the room and the Howler tore itself into pieces after it finished. </p><p>"I was expecting more flare with a side of a temper tantrum." Harry banished the ashes. He passed Snape a cup of tea.  </p><p>"I am sure he had one in Gringotts, the Ministry, and Hogwarts." Snape passed over the biscuits. "We need to bring these back home when we return." They had been enjoying catching up on all the news they had missed while they were gone. </p><p>"When do you want to go back home?"</p><p>"Tomorrow? I believe we have created problems for all of them. After all, they, without the Black seats, lose their political alliance."</p><p>"True. You want to take scuba diving lessons with me when we get home?" Harry wanted to learn.</p><p>Snape thought about it for a few minutes. "It does sound interesting. We can also see what potion ingredients we can find in the ocean." </p><p>"True."</p>
