    <p>The sound of creaking floor boards pulled you out of a dreamless sleep.  You blinked awake turning towards the noise to see a man silhouetted by the light of the doorway.  You recognized the figure in an instant.</p>
<p>“Billy?” you called, your voice still rough with sleep. “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer right away.  There were dark circles under his eyes, but he was clearly awake and alert as he came further into the room, watching you closely. His eyes then darted around the room, switching between the window, your closet door and even under your bed.  It was then you noticed, he was wearing his gun belt.</p>
<p>“Billy, what is going on?”</p>
<p>Your voice snapped him back to reality.  His shoulders relaxed, and his expression turned sheepish.</p>
<p>
  <b>“I had a nightmare about you and I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.”</b>
</p>
<p>He said it so quietly, you weren’t even sure your heard it, but his face told you enough.</p>
<p>Your eyes softened as you moved over in bed and beckoned him to you.</p>
<p>The man didn’t hesitate.  He took off his gun belt and slid under the covers, taking you in his arms.</p>
<p>Neither of you said a word, content in each other’s touch and warmth before sleep took you once more. </p>
