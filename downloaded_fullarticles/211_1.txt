    <p>Has anyone noticed that Gilderoy Lockhart has engaged in physical contact with Harry Potter (that Harry most certainly didn't like) almost as much as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger (and they're some of the main characters), and he only shows up in one book (we're not counting the next book because he doesn't touch Harry Potter more than twice then).</p><p>Also, whenever given the chance, he would pull Harry up to the front of the class for help in acting out his "great adventures". During these, he at least once had Harry pinned to the floor.</p><p>In <em>Struggle To SalvationÂ </em>by LadyCelestialStar on AO3, Lockhart was known to be very... <em>romantic</em> towards very young people, Remus Lupin once stating that "He asked a first-year on a date when we were in our last year," meaning that as a 17/18-year-old, Lockhart asked an 11-year-old on a date.</p><p>When a memory charm (<em>o</em><em>bliviate</em>) has been used on someone, they often feel very dizzy shortly afterward. One time when Lockhart had spoken to Harry when no one else was around, Harry was left feeling dizzy afterward. When Harry had to help Lockhart sort his fan mail, he lost track of time, and very well could have had a memory charm used on him at that time.</p><p>Just thinking.</p>
