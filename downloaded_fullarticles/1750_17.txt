  <span>“Harry, you have got to see this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco’s usually calm voice had inched up an octave, hissing out between his teeth. Harry wordlessly cast a Protego over them both as he spun to stand by Draco’s side, ready to defend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unlikely as it seemed initially, their Auror partnership was defined by this understanding of each other’s tells and utter trust in each other’s instincts. If Draco thought something was dangerous, Harry would be ready - no questions asked. It meant they had the highest successful arrest rate in the department, and the lowest sustained injuries or collateral damage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you recognise those implements? Torture, do you think?” Draco’s voice was sharp, his eyes focused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Through the shimmering bubble of his shield charm Harry cast his eyes over the ornate black trunk that had alarmed Draco so much. He lowered his wand, pinching the bridge of his nose, the impending conversation already giving him a headache.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco, that’s- those aren’t...well. They aren’t torture devices. Exactly.” Harry sighed heavily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean not torture? Look at those clamp things.” He pointed at the delicate devices in question, turning his suspicious eyes on Harry. “How do you know, anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another reason their partnership worked? Unflinching honesty, hashed out from their earliest weeks together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Double fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well. I own a pair like that. I know the guy who makes them. So. Um. I think this room’s clear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Well now…”</span>
  </em>
