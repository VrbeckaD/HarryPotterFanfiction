    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Draco Malfoy watched the reds and orange of the morning sun dance across his eyelids as he contemplated his life choices. His head was pounding, his mouth taste of cheap whiskey and felt like cotton, his whole body ached, and why in the <em>fuck</em> were the birds chirping so loudly? He pulled the covers tighter around his naked torso and willed himself to fall back asleep.</p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>
    <em>"He's spiraling, Pansy."</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>"I know, Blaise. The whole thing was already a mess from the start and this job... I don't know why the stupid git just wont call it quits already and go and work with you."</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>"Ha! Like you don't know why. I'll give you one hint: He has four eyes, two of which are green."</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>If Draco could open his eyes then he would roll them at the barely hushed voices of his best friends who were clearly plotting outside his bedroom door. As if Potter were a reason to stay. If anything, he were a reason to run screaming in the opposite direction! And this was all his fault to begin with!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>"I'm worried about him... Who was that bloke he came home with?"</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>His eyes flew open and his head spun to the side -- an action he immediately bemoaned when his stomach lurched and the room spun, too. His bed was thankfully empty but broken memories from last night came flooding back to him: dancing wildly and singing off-key to some delightful muggle group called the Spicey Girls (or something of that nature), drunkenly crying into a pint of gross beer while two girls dressed in neon fits with tiger stripes cooed over him like a sad kitten, letting some nameless bloke with messy black hair and the wrong colored eyes bend him over against the wall outside a bathroom stall... Sweet Salazar! Had he brought that bloke home?! Wasn't he a muggle?! Holy shite, how did he get them all the way here from Soho?! Thoughts of being locked up for breaking the international statue of secrecy ran through his mind!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The bubbling panic was just starting to mingle unsettlingly with his hangover when more bits of the picture floated into place.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>Shite</em>.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He looked over at the brown robes emblazoned with the ministry's emblem (the letter M with a shining wand in the center) and the the word <em>Trainee</em> stitched underneath. They awaited him mockingly, thrown haphazardly over a chair. He closed his eyes again and took a deep, steadying breath. He didn't know if he had any dignity left still to walk away with but he made up his mind, nonetheless:</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Fuck it. I quit."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>
    <b>1 Day Earlier</b>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The darkness pressed in around Draco, encasing him from every angle, heavy and suffocating. He stilled, his ears straining carefully, at first hearing only the sound of his own quickened pulse thrumming against his eardrums and his ragged breath in the chilled air around him. He was rewarded for his patience, however, with a slight rustle in the distance. Robes against leaves? The smell of damp earth and pine cones and the feel of soil and twigs beneath his feet told him that he was in a forest. That meant that any shot he took could be impeded by trunks and branches.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A flash of light briefly illuminated a hooded figure among the trees. Moments later, the snap of a twig told him that the figure was coming toward him rather than fleeing. He braced himself and crouched in wait.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>"Come on... Come on..."</em> he breathed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>When the next flash of light flared, he was ready. His eyes quickly sought out the assailant and, instead of firing, he focused on apparating right behind him: a risky, dangerous, down right <em>idiotic</em> move in pitch darkness and with no clear landing! -- That is unless, of course, you had the innate grace of Draco Malfoy. He smirked when he came out of the apparition, seamlessly, right as the next crack of light struck, illuminating the surprised and frightened face of his target, mere feet away from his.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>"INCARCEROUS!"</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The simulation ended and the lights flickered on to reveal the disappointed faces of his spectating peers in the viewing gallery. He smiled smugly. They wore that look every time he didn't fail and Draco refused to give them the satisfaction. He tried to contain his excitement as he turned towards the giant magical timer that now shone green to indicate that he'd beaten his personal best: 3 minutes and 56 seconds flat on a simulation where the average time of completion was nearly 15! </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Bloody hell, Malfoy! Are you insane or do you have a death wish?!" Leave it to Weasley to forget to hate him when he was impressed by something. Draco smirked and decided to take what he could get.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Aww!" He placed a mocking hand over his heart. "Were you actually concerned about me, Weasley? I'm touched!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Course not, I'm just glad we're not the ones left picking splinched bits and pieces of you out of fake tree tops!" he called down and shook his head ruefully.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco's eyes involuntarily drifted to Weasley's right and the tanned man with the green eyes and scruffy beard who now wore his black hair long and pulled back into a messy bun. He gasped slightly when he realized that Potter was watching him intently, muscled arms straining against his tight muggle shirt as he leaned over the railing. Draco was sure he was deluding himself by imagining that the look on the man's face might've actually been one of admiration or respect and, for some inexplicable reason, the thought made his ears heat up, embarrassingly. He was almost grateful when the moment was interrupted by a rumbling voice. <em>Almost</em>.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Nice work, Malfoy, but you're still not as fast as Potter." Head Auror Robards said smugly as his quill scribbled something into his floating, dragon-hide bound notebook.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco looked back up at Potter who nodded towards the clock and then smirked wryly at Draco in challenge. He effortfully tempered his temper and turned his attention back to the gruff, stoutly, middle-aged man with the large salt and pepper mustache.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So what? Neither has anyone else! It's not my fault that the stupid git had to go and break the all-time record!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No, but <em>he'</em>s not the one who has something to prove."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" Draco fought to keep the emotions at war with each other from contorting his face. It was the first day of their 3rd and final year of training and he'd consistently been top 2 in their class in years previous -- by a landslide, even -- but, would it ever be enough? He already worked harder than everyone else, faster than everyone else -- everyone, it seemed, except Saint Bloody Potter!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Look Malfoy, I'm going to be straight with you - you're talented. No one can dispute that. But your attitude isn't great and no one trusts you in a position of power or public service -- OK, BRING IT IN!!!" He called out to the rest of the crowd, making it abundantly clear that he considered that the end of their conversation.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"<em>Excuse me</em>?" He hissed as his training mates closed in around them. "Have I not passed every one of those blasted character and aptitude tests just like everyone else?! Have I not chosen a path that, by its very nature, implies that I want to do some good in this godforsaken world for once?! Yes, let me bloody put my life on the line every day to try and keep the world safe because I'm an evil bastard!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Robards merely shook his head. "I call it like I see it, Malfoy. I've said it before and I'll say it again: you are fighting a constant and losing battle. I personally don't know why you'd put yourself through it to begin with but that's just the reality of it. Now fall in line!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco bit back the litany of swear words that were on his tongue. He turned on his heels only to bump headlong into Harry Potter whose curiously, sad eyes met his. He reached out a steadying hand to catch Draco before he could fall. Once he'd caught his bearings, the brooding blonde simply huffed and marched off to the other side of the room.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Robards spoke out: "Ok, thus far, we've been working on increasingly strenuous skills and strategies and, until this point, the simulations have been the main way to test what you've learnt. Well, enough of that! Third year is <em>not </em>for the faint of heart and, quite frankly, if it weren't for how badly our force was dwindled by the war or this soft new minister's insistence on relaxing some of our standards of training, a <em>lot</em> of you wouldn't be here." He looked pointedly at Draco whose fingers curled instinctively tighter around his wand. "This year is when we see who's really meant to be here. We will have cuts at several points throughout the year, the first being at the end of the next test which shall begin this afternoon."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A wave of frenzied muttering rippled through the crowd of fretful comrades.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Settle down! Settle down! This afternoon's test will consist of an actual field assignment." There were gasps and Draco perked up. This is what he'd been waiting for! A time to shine in the real world!</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"About time!" Said Stevens, an eager and sharp-witted brunette girl. They had all been wondering when they'd actually get to go out into the field. It had historically happened in the first year but, after too many casualties, they had finally decided to save field tasks for the final stage of training.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You will be partnered with one other trainee and the team who accomplishes their tasks in the fastest amount of time will be exempt from this first round of cuts. Choose carefully! If you have any brains then it will be someone you trust and who's body language you can read."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>There was an excited, frantic energy in the room but Draco let his eyes shut momentarily in defeat. He'd pointedly isolated himself from the start. He knew that he'd joined as the pariah and so he made sure to keep to himself, avoiding the group lunches and team nights out. It probably didn't help that he was still a down right bitch to most of them. He probably should've played nice but his Slytherin instincts told him to defend himself and he couldn't help it if his best defenses were... moderately offensive. Boy had this come back to bite him in the arse. He looked around the room where all the best candidates who might leave him with even a slim chance of avoiding being picked off by Robards' vengeful cuts were already eyeing the friend they were considering for their partner. Potter was stood next to the red-headed buffoon, of course.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Robards continued: "Potter! Since you are ahead, you'll get first choice at a partner."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco didn't wait to hear his pick. He turned and headed back to the locker room, defeated.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Anger flooded through him as he stopped at the line of sinks. He grasped hard at one of the the porcelain basins, his knuckles turning white as he glared back at the pathetic reflection in the mirror.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"AARGHHH!" He cried out in anguish, his fist connecting hard and quick with the cool, glassy face of the blonde bastard staring back it him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The shattered mirror was satisfying for all of about 4 seconds before he looked down at his hand, bloodied, littered with shards of glass and already turning purple because he'd surely just broken something. And, as if the excruciating pain hadn't realized it was supposed to come until after he'd seen it:</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ow! Ow! Ow! OW!" he whimpered as he nursed his hand. For someone who was averse to pain and blood, he really needed to stop doing that, he thought.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Merlin, Malfoy!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Oh great.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Shove off, Potter!" he managed to get out through clinched teeth. He was the <em>last</em> person he wanted to see right now.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>But, of course, Potter, with his stupid hero complex, did <em>not</em> shove off. Instead, he rushed forward with worried brow and tried to reach for his throbbing hand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"<em>I'm fine, Potter</em>!" he said, fighting back tears.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Potter rolled his eyes. "Malfoy, you just completely pulverized you wand hand..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ok. He had to admit he was feeling stupider by the second. He made a conscious note that if he were going to be an idiot in the future, then he at least needed to use the other hand so that he could heal himself.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He sighed loudly in resignation.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I hate you, Potter." he frowned. He would've put more heat behind it but for that bloody pain...</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Potter's responding smile was disarming as he reached out for Draco's hand again. "You need me to say it back?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco rolled his eyes but gingerly placed his hand in Potter's, all the same. Potter examined the damage with a soft expression that Draco rarely saw. Hogwarts may have been long over but training had only amplified their competition in a different way. They were never quite as vile to each other anymore (he being a proper wizard who respected life-debts and Potter the annoying goody-two-shoes that he was) but, still, challenge always hung heavy in the air between them that was only fueled by the opposite and extreme expectations people had of them. As such, he was used to snarky, arrogant bastard Potter or smug, super Auror Potter. Now, the green-eyed man was being oddly gentle and it was... slightly unnerving...</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Can you fix it?" he finally asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, you've definitely fractured some knuckles and my bone mending is shite..." Draco winced as he turned his hand. "But the cuts seem shallow and I've healed enough cuts and skinned knees for my godson that I should be able to stop the bleeding and splint it easy enough until you can make a trip to St. Mungos."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco nodded. Potter directed him to sit on the nearest bench and then sat facing him. He cradled his hand gently with one of his own large, rough hands and Draco held his breath as he began to delicately pull out the shards of glass, one at a time.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So... Do you want to talk about this?" He nodded towards the mangled hand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco merely rolled his eyes again. This whole situation was already shameful enough without him having to explain it to the bloody savior. Potter chuckled softly but took the cue.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>They sat like that in silence for long moments as the little pile of glass accumulated on the bench as it was removed. When Potter finally spoke again, it was with a gentleness that matched his efforts.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You can't let him get to you, Malfoy." He said without taking his eyes off of the task at hand. Draco had been briefly distracted, mesmerized even, when he realized that Potter had begun carefully, yet, wandlessly lifting out some of the more embedded shards before the words finally registered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Beg your pardon?" He asked softly, not quite trusting his ears.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Malfoy, you're fast, brilliant and ridiculously clever." He pulled out his wand and made quick work of healing his skin.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco gasped softly, stunned by his words. "Potter, I --"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Green eyes finally met his and held his gaze. "You are going to be one of the best Aurors to ever do this, if only you don't let him make you fall apart."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco felt lightheaded as he stared back into sincere, warm green eyes. It wasn't until Potter finally looked away and began methodically casting the bandaging charm to make a makeshift splint that he realized that, at some point, he had started holding his breath again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And <em>that</em> is why I chose you as my partner." he said matter-of-factly as he let go of his hand abruptly. "All done!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco gaped back at him, mouth opening and closing like a bizarre fish.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You <em>what</em>?!" Potter just smiled back at him smugly. "But what about Weasley?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Potter shrugged. "Ron works well with Stevens. Robards said pick someone who reads you well and..." his ears went red. "Well, we've had plenty of practice learning how to read each other what with playing against each other as seekers and, you know..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco raised an eyebrow. "He also said to pick someone you trust..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Potter shrugged again. "Well we've both already saved each other's life at least once."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco's wheels were turning. This didn't make any sense... But then he moved his arm and the resulting pain that shot through his hand reminded him that it didn't very much matter now, anyways.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He sighed. "Potter, that's very kind of you but I can't." He lifted his bandaged hand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's ok, I don't need your hand I only need your brain!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco cocked his head and quirked a brow, unable to help the resulting smirk.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Is that so?" His eyes were lit with amusement despite the fact that he was sure the innuendo probably went over Potter's pure little head.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Potter blushed. "I mean, I could do the wandwork!" Draco bit his lip and nodded. Potter's blush deepened but he continued: "You're cleverer than I --"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Obviously."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He rolled his eyes. "-- which means that you'll catch on to things quicker than I and we can finish faster."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Potter, you want me to go out into the field, completely wandless? I'll practically be naked!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well so long as you have your wand on you you'll still be able to apparate but, otherwise, I can protect you." Draco shot him a skeptical look. "The question just becomes do <em>you</em> trust <em>me</em>?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco searched earnest green eyes and contemplated the question, thoughts of Harry Potter swooping down and plucking him from a sea of fiendfyre and confidently marching into his Wizengamot trial playing like a reel in his mind. He sighed, knowing that the answer was yes, unequivocally. He could never tell <em>him</em> that though.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I promise I'll watch your back, Malfoy. Pinky swear." Draco screwed up his face in confusion as Potter lifted his pinky and then held it out for him. He rolled his eyes at Draco's resistance. "It's a muggle thing."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco hesitantly mirrored the action with his good hand and was surprised when Potter wrapped his pinky tightly around his.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ok, what's the task?" He asked, still a little bemused when Potter released him.</p>
</div>
  </div>
