He placed a hand on his extended middle, feeling the child shift.</p><p> </p><p>He was so curious of how this little one would come out, a child that would one day be ruler of the ghost zone. oh.. and definitely not an only child, not with the way he and Dark went at it.</p><p> </p><p>“You look glorious, becoming more and more beautiful as our child grows,” Pariah Dark purred joining him in the spa, the far larger male leering at his mate.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to see a trick,” Phantom purred back, and shifted his body, Pariah could only drool as his body grew breasts and some fondling showed he had a new opening behind his balls.</p><p> </p><p>“Ohh... I do like this trick,” Pariah said, and showed his mate how he enjoyed it by filling the new entry to the Limit with his seed.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>The next day it was discovered that Phantom was missing, Pariah Dark raged and a long search began for his Queen and unborn child.</p><p> </p><p>This was what twisted him, no longer a just king.

Memories had been with his human self, leaving the active self to be amnesia.. in the very far past.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t know what to think about his ghostly life there, his marriage..
