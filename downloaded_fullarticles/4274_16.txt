    <p>"Out of the way, Potter. You're making the entire room look untidy". </p><p>It was only a sharp glare from Hermione and Ron's hand on his arm that held Harry back from decking the pretentious prat that was Draco Malfoy into the middle of next week. Instead, he just huffed and shrugged off his best friends' hand before taking a seat at the back of the Potions classroom. Harry noticed with much irritation that Malfoy's scent was still clinging to him from where the blonde git had pushed past him in the doorway. He surreptitiously sniffed the left arm of his Gryffindor robe, inhaling the scent of what appeared to be peppermint and fresh parchment. The sound of Ron clattering down behind the bench next to him shocked Harry out of what he was doing, and with an embarrassed grunt he tore the robe off and shoved it under his seat. Before Harry could question too much about what he'd just done, Professor Slughorn shuffled to the front of the room and the sixth year students all fell silent. There was a steaming cauldron in front of the Professor, which Harry had noticed on the way in held a light blue mixture that was slightly glowing. Slughorn collected a small vial of the potion and held it up for the class to see. </p><p>"As many of you may remember from last lesson, I introduced you to two new types of potion," Slughorn began, "Felix Felicis, more commonly referred to as Liquid Luck of course, and the one I hold in my hand now."</p><p>Slughorn paused, the vial still being held aloft, clearly expecting everyone to remember what it was. Harry tried to cast his mind back to the last lesson but he drew a blank, and looking over at Ron he seemed to be having the same problem if the confused frown knitting his eyebrows together was anything to go by. Neither of them needed to be worried however for, as per usual, Harry watched as Hermione's hand flew up into the air from nearer the front of the class. </p><p>"That one is Amortentia potion, Professor", Hermione answered before being called upon, "A powerful love potion, and one that is said to acquire the scent of whatever attracts the person smelling it". </p><p>"Entirely correct, Miss Granger", Slughorn informed her with a smile, "Ten points to Gryffindor. Now, as with last lesson, I am going to ask each of you to attempt to brew a perfect Amortentia potion and, again as with the last class we had together, whichever student's potion is brewed closest to perfection will be rewarded with their own sample," Slughorn said, brandishing the potion for the class to see before setting it down on the desk, "Hurry along now, you have the rest of the hour. Instructions will be found on page 128 of your books. May the best student win!" </p><p>Harry flicked to the right page in his copy of Advanced Potion Making, and went to the cupboard to collect the ingredients listed. Before long, and with considerable help from the Half-Blood Prince, Harry was stirring in the final ingredients to his Amortentia and ladeling some in to a cup. Professor Slughorn made his way round to Harry, leaned down to inspect the potion, and straightened up with a pleased twinkle in his eye. </p><p>"Merlin's beard, Potter!" Slughorn exclaimed happily, "Another perfect success. Well, fair is fair I suppose. One vial of Amortentia potion for you. Good job, my boy! We'll make a potions prodigy of you yet!"</p><p>Grinning from Slughorn's praise, Harry took the vial and stowed it safely in his bag along with his potions book, sending up a silent 'thank you' to whoever the Half-Blood Prince could be. Harry caught up with Ron and Hermione in the corridor, and they both started on their way to Transifiguration. </p><p>"I don't know how you're doing it, mate!" Ron laughed, clapping Harry hard on the back, "But it's bloody brilliant. The look on Malfoy's face every time you out-do him in Potions is just priceless!" </p><p>Harry laughed along with Ron, ignoring Hermione's suspicious, and possibly jealous, glares in his direction. The trio were just walking past the open windows that led to the courtyard when a cold wind made Harry realise that he'd left his robe back in Slughorn's class. Harry cursed quietly at his stupidity, and told Ron and Hermione to save him a seat in Transfiguration before he began to double back to the dungeons. </p><p>Harry reached the classroom at a run, out of breath he grabbed the robe from where it had slipped to the floor and put it on, turning to leave and hoping Professor McGonagall wasn't in a bad mood today. A strong waft of peppermint and fresh parchment made Harry pause for a moment, before remembering angrily why he would now smell like Draco bloody Malfoy for the rest of the day. Harry shook out his robe around him in a half-hearted attempt to get rid of the smell, when he realised that the scent was stronger than it had been before. Pressing his robe to his face, Harry looked around the room, wondering where this stronger scent was coming from, or even if the owner of it was still lurking in the dungeons like the creepy Slytherin he was. Harry's eyes fell on his Amortentia potion, it's steaming contents still in it's cauldron on the table. Harry leaned over it and gulped in a breath, and was immediately hit with a face full of Malfoy-scented fumes. Harry stepped back as if the potion had bit him, taking in ragged breaths and shaking his head. No, Harry thought his emerald eyes fixed on the cauldron, there was no way- no chance that his Amortentia was...that it smelled like....No! Harry slammed a lid over the offending contents of the cauldron, and the scent immediately lessened considerably. Still shaking his head in denial, Harry pulled his robe tighter around himself and started to sprint to Transfiguration, definitely not thinking about blonde hair and the smell of peppermint and parchment.</p>
