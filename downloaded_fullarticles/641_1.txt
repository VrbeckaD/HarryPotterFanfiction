    <p>James frowned as Rosalind jumped up and started shoving her way to the nearest train exit.  He glanced out the window she’d been peering through, seeing nothing that could have caused her reaction — though that wasn’t saying much as the train hadn’t finished pulling into the station yet.</p>
<p>He caught up to her just as it did — unfortunate timing as it didn’t give him a chance to ask what was wrong.  Instead he was forced to try following her through the mass of students and families crowding the platform.  It wasn’t an easy task, if not for her shout he thought he probably would have had to call for Hatty to help find her.</p>
<p>“Mary!”</p>
<p>“Lindy!”</p>
<p>James shoved back whoever had walked into him when he stumbled to a stop.  Rosalind was kneeling in front of a wheeled chair of some sort, clasping the hands of a girl who looked almost exactly like her.  Only the way her eyes looked even bigger in her thin, sallow face and how her curls hung limp and dull on her head kept them from being perfectly identical.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were sick again?” Rosalind chided. “You said you were feeling better!  I would’ve asked to come home if I knew.”</p>
<p>Her sister — because she could only be the twin Rosalind was always writing to — smiled, reaching out to pull Rosalind into a hug. “That’s why I asked Mum and Ta to wait.  You can’t show me all the magic you’ve learnt if you’re not at school.”</p>
<p>She peered around Rosalind, missing the flicker of unease that passed across her face.  James could guess why and was already signalling Father when she spotted him.</p>
<p>“Who’s this?” she asked, giving Rosalind a grin that promised teasing of the sort only a sister could get away with — James would know, he’d had two until recently.</p>
<p>Rosalind flushed slightly as she introduced him.  It was a look that had drawn him in as he’d gotten to know her throughout the year, building to eventually inviting her to stay at Linfred for the summer.  As he watched the same flush spread across her sister’s cheeks and combine with a slight shiver when he brushed his lips over the back of her hand — being careful to bow deeply rather than bringing her hand to him like lesser-bred wizards — he realised there were more differences between the two than just magic and health.  This sister made James’ magic rise in him in a way he’d never experienced, reaching out to ease her chill.</p>
<p>He was blushing himself when he stood back, sending Hatty to bring him one of the charmed blankets from the castle and reaching out to stop Rosalind from wrapping her outer-robes around her sister.</p>
<p>“This will work better,” he said, pushing down the odd urge to tuck it securely around her himself. “It’s charmed to be as warm and soft as you like.”</p>
<p>Rosalind gave him a grateful glance as she fussed over her sister — Mary?  It had sounded more like a nickname than a proper name, the way she’d called Rosalind ‘Lindy’. “I’ll bring it back in September,” she said, “I promise.  Or you can send Ardeo if you need it before then, Mum and Ta set up a small owlery in the back garden.”</p>
<p>James shook his head. “Keep it, we’ve plenty of others.  Hatty makes charmed jumpers and nightclothes too, I’ll send a parcel with Ardeo.”  He glanced at Father for a moment before adding, “Or you can come visit.  All of you.  Linfred’s always comfortable and —”</p>
<p>Rosalind shook her head before he could add the many other features that made the castle one of the most envied ancestral homes in Europe. “I can’t,” she said, turning to face her parents with the same expression that had made James decide to never, ever try pranking her. “I’m going to help Mary get better.”</p>
<p>James watched as Rosalind’s sister hunched in on herself while her parents and Rosalind began an argument that sounded well-worn.  He shifted, knowing that he should leave quietly, but not quite being able to bring himself to do it.  Instead he looked up at Father.</p>
<p>“Can’t you do anything?” he asked as softly as he could. “Please?”</p>
<p>Father studied him for a long moment in which James did his best not to fidget.  He wasn’t entirely sure why this was so important to him, he didn’t even know the girl’s proper name, but he knew the idea of her continuing to be so ill and upset made his magic agitated in a way it hadn’t been since he’d learnt why Wendy would be attending Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“I am not a Healer,” Father warned him. “The best I can do is offer the castle and access to my contacts with the Unspeakables.”</p>
<p>“Castle?”  James turned to find Rosalind’s sister looking hopefully up at their parents. “I’ve never stayed in a real castle before.”</p>
<p>He grinned as he watched the Cohen parents exchange glances.  The second sister he’d not paid much attention to could complain about whatever friend she’d made plans with all she liked.  No one could resist the pleading of a sickly little girl.  Especially not when she had such stunning eyes.</p><hr/>
<p>Pleading seemed to work well for Rosemary — as James discovered her proper name was through Hatty’s fussing when they arrived — and he could very easily see why.  She didn’t use it often, easily agreeing to read or play games or go on picnics when her sisters suggested them.  But when she did, looking up with big eyes that made it all too clear how painfully thin and small she was, it was impossible to deny her.</p>
<p>Which was how she came to be sitting in a courtyard off the Lady’s room in the heir suite that had appeared the day she moved in.  Neither her parents nor Mother had been pleased by the arrangement, though James imagined for rather different reasons.  Even Rosalind had looked uncomfortable with the idea of sharing a suite with James, despite his pointing out that it really wasn’t that different from sharing the Gryffindor common room.</p>
<p>Then Rosemary had seen the courtyard and the violin that had appeared by what would be her bed.  She had looked at her parents with obvious longing and a quiet mention of how it was “such a lovely little courtyard.”  And that night, James had kissed her hand again and watched Tessie pop her into bed before sleeping in the Heir’s bedroom outside his Heirship Day for the first time.</p>
<p>Now, he watched as she struggled to hold up her violin long enough to finish the piece she had been playing.  Something wizarding, he was fairly sure.  Rosemary had been fascinated by Mother’s collection of wizarding music, enough that Mother had convinced her parents to allow the Potters to hire her a proper tutor.  It would have been brilliant, if not for the fact that it allowed James to more easily see how much more quickly she was tiring.</p>
<p>He stepped forward, casting a lightening charm on the violin so that she could finish.  She’d have an Ollivander violin at Christmas.  One made just for her.</p>
<p>“Healer Goldstein said he’s almost done with Rosalind,” James said when she’d set down the violin, “would you like help getting back in your chair?”</p>
<p>He watched as she grimaced and nodded.  It was the same every time he’d come to assist her in getting to her daily checkups with Healer Goldstein.  The castle refused to allow anyone other than James, Rosalind, and Rosemary into the heir wing and Healer Goldstein didn’t want Rosemary or Rosalind having excess magic cast on them, which meant James or Rosalind wheeling Rosemary wherever she wanted or needed to go.</p>
<p>Problem was, Rosemary hated her chair.  No amount of cushioning charms or elf magic seemed to make it comfortable for her.  James wasn’t sure anything could, with how thin she was.</p>
<p>“Or…” James hesitated even as he held out his arms, “I could carry you, if you like.  It’s not very far and you’re light.”</p>
<p>Too light, really.  Even lighter than James had expected when she’d blushed and nodded, biting her lip in a way that was thoroughly distracting.  He held her close as he walked through the heir wing, taking extra care to not jostle her.  She bruised so easily, at every touch it seemed, and the marks stood out on her fair skin far longer than James thought was healthy.</p>
<p>Of course, he reminded himself, she <em>wasn</em><em>’t</em> healthy.  That was why he was setting her gently down in front of the rooms Healer Goldstein had taken for his offices.  Because she wasn’t healthy and Father had been right, there really was nothing he could do other than offer the castle and every resource available to the Potters.</p>
<p>James’ magic flared at the reminder — jumping even higher when Rosemary gasped and fell against him.  He scooped her back into his arms, ordering the door to Healer Goldstein’s offices open and rushing in.</p>
<p>Then immediately spun back around, his cheeks flaming as he stuttered apologies.  Why Rosalind had had her skirt hiked up above her waist he didn’t know, but her mum was keeping watch so it must be fine.  James only wished he could stop wondering just how identical the twins were.  He supposed that at least his and Rosalind’s embarrassment had made Rosemary giggle, bringing a hint of pink to her cheeks that made her look a little bit less sickly.</p>
<p>Healer Goldstein did little more than wave his wand around Rosemary and scribble something on his odd muggle board when James explained why he’d barged in so suddenly.  He asked James to send for his parents and Mr Cohen, then ushered him and the twins out when they arrived.  James wasn’t sure what was said, even the portraits refused to help him eavesdrop, but when they came out he was excused from all lessons and family meals he didn’t wish to attend and the wards keeping him and the twins out of each other’s rooms for more than a few moments at a time were lifted.</p>
<p>James found himself blushing again at that.  Mr and Mrs Cohen might not understand the implication, he wasn’t sure how much Healer Goldstein had explained about wizarding customs, but to James the message was clear: he’d brought a muggleborn home for the summer and he was now free to enjoy his time with her however they both liked.</p>
<p>He kissed Rosalind’s hand before she went to bed that night, as he had every night for months starting back when they were still at school.  She always retired earlier than Rosemary, who usually slept later and napped often throughout the day.  She would give Rosemary a hug and allow James to kiss her hand — always with a blush, despite how regular an occurrence it was — and then, when she had gone into her room, James would spend an hour or so pretending to read while resisting the urge to tuck Rosemary into his side.</p>
<p>Tonight Rosemary changed the routine, looking up from her book when he settled across from her on the sofa, trying to find a balance between being close enough to appease his magic and so close that she became uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I can stay by myself,” she said quietly, “if you and Lindy want to…be alone.”</p>
<p>James froze for a beat before picking up his book from the side table and opening it to where he’d left off. “Watching someone sleep doesn’t sound very fun.  I’d just keep trying to talk to her and then she’d shout at me.”</p>
<p>She would, he knew because he’d accidentally kept her up discussing transfiguration theory one night.  He hadn’t even noticed she’d been half-asleep for over an hour, unaccustomed to having someone who could keep up with him in the subject.  Then she’d clamped her hand over his mouth and told him that if he didn’t let her go to sleep she was going to find a way to hex him so badly he’d be in the hospital wing for the rest of the term.  It had been when James decided to ask her to spend the summer with him.</p>
<p>Rosemary cut him off before he could tell the story, setting aside her book and rising shakily to her feet.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant,” she said, brushing off James’ attempt to assist her. “You should go in.  Lindy’s fancied you for ages, you’ll probably only have to explain.”</p>
<p>James was too busy ensuring she didn’t injure herself getting into her chair to register her words for a moment.  When he did, she’d already started wheeling herself to her room.</p>
<p>“<em>Wait</em>,” James darted in front of her chair, kneeling so he wasn’t towering over her, “how do you know about that?”</p>
<p>Rosemary rolled her eyes. “You haven’t a telly and I can’t swim or go riding like Becca and Lindy.  Tessie brings me books to read.”</p>
<p>James blinked down at the cover of the book in her lap.  One of the Potter training books, for wizards heading off to their first year at Hogwarts.  He’d known she’d spent most of her waking hours reading, but he’d assumed it had been fairy tales or other stories.  Not the books he still put off reading until the risk of angering Father was too high.</p>
<p>“Go,” she said, gently pushing on his chest. “I can get to bed myself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly.”</p>
<p>He wheeled her into her room and helped her into bed, as he had been doing for the past few nights when she’d begun to be unsteady on her feet as the day wore on.  Rosalind could do it just as easily, but Rosemary fretted about waking her and James’ magic behaved better when he had something useful to do.</p>
<p>He began to straighten after tucking her in, planning to kiss her hand as he always did before changing his mind at the last minute.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t want to follow the traditions,” he asked, sitting in the chair beside her bed.</p>
<p>Rosemary tilted her head before shifting onto her side with a slight wince.  James made a note to ask Tessie to increase the softness of her bed.</p>
<p>“Why did you ask Lindy to come then?”</p>
<p>There wasn’t an answer for that James could manage to make sense to himself, let alone anyone else.  He <em>had </em>invited Rosalind to Linfred with the expectation of having her in his bed any time Mother wasn’t helping her learn how witches were expected to behave.  Except that she’d said she didn’t want to spend that long away from her sister and James had decided against trying to invite anyone else.  He’d planned on meeting her family, introducing her parents to Mother, and seeing if he couldn’t convince her to spend at least part of the summer with him.</p>
<p>Then she and Rosemary had moved into his rooms.  He’d spent days and weeks showing them the castle and grounds.  Introduced Rosemary to his ancestors’ portraits on the rare occasion she managed to convince Rosalind to do something she couldn’t join.  Went on short rides with Rosalind when Rosemary insisted they not stay cooped up on her account.  Until traditions and taking Rosalind to his bed had entirely slipped his mind.</p>
<p>“Jamie,” Rosemary gave him a soft smile before kissing his cheek, surprising him enough to forget the pet name. “Go.  Lindy will be asleep if you wait much longer.”</p>
<p>She was probably right, but James still hesitated.  Something about the idea of leaving this room felt…off.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” he asked, just to put it off a few more moments.</p>
<p>Rosemary waved him away, pulling the blankets up further around her. “It’ll make Lindy really happy.”</p>
<p>There was a part of James that wanted to ask if it would make <em>Rosemary</em> happy, before he pushed the thought away.  Of course it would.  Both sisters seemed to enjoy nothing more than seeing the other happy.  James nodded, kissing Rosemary’s forehead before forcing himself to leave.  He made sure to cast a strong one-way silencing charm around her room before he left.</p><hr/>
<p>Rosalind wasn’t asleep when James cautiously peeked into her room.  Didn’t seem even close, in fact.  She was sitting up in her bed with a book on her lap.  A book with the distinct illustrations and gilded edging of a Potter training book and James found himself wondering if there was some sort of plot amongst the house elves to ensure he did his duty as the Potter heir.</p>
<p>“Is Mary ok?” she asked, immediately setting aside her book.</p>
<p>James nodded as he slipped fully into the room and closed the door behind him. “She wanted to go to bed early.  She…er…”  He rubbed at his hair, trying to think of what to say.  It was strange, knowing that Rosemary was a room away, fully aware of what he was doing. “How much of that book have you read?”</p>
<p>Rosalind blushed. “Enough, I guess.  Is that…you didn’t <em>make</em> Mary go to bed early, did you?”</p>
<p>“Of course not!”  James crossed his arms, scowling at the very thought. “It was her idea, she read the books too.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”  Rosalind traced along the cover of her book instead of looking at him. “Then…how does…I mean…”</p>
<p>James hesitantly sat on the edge of Rosalind’s bed.  Smaller than his or Rosemary’s, he noted absently.  He wasn’t entirely sure how it worked either, not with muggleborn witches who already knew the traditions.  Did he just kiss her?  Push her back onto the bed?  It seemed a bit impolite, not to mention awkward.  Somehow it never seemed this complicated with pureblood witches.</p>
<p>Of course, James had rarely been with pureblood witches who hadn’t come to him.  And he’d never been with a muggleborn without weeks of careful touches and building anticipation.  Something he’d started with Rosalind before getting distracted.</p>
<p>He leaned in slowly, brushing back her hair and giving her plenty of time to move away.  Her curls were thicker and more lustrous than her sister’s, quickly tangling in his fingers so that he didn’t dare try moving his hand for fear of hurting her.  She had soft, plump lips, so different from the chapped skin on Rosemary’s that James constantly wanted to moisten with his tongue.</p>
<p>He tried to push that thought from his mind as he lowered Rosalind onto the bed.  She moved easily with him, even if he found himself thinking that it didn’t feel quite right.  None of the witches he’d been with had been perfect.  He suspected that was just how things worked.  Rosalind was…pleasant, at least, humming against his lips when he pulled her hips to align with his.</p>
<p>James rubbed himself against her as he trailed kisses down her neck and tried to find out what she enjoyed.  It was easier with his eyes closed — it always was — even if it also meant he sometimes ended up with a mouthful of hair.  He let himself fall into the sensations, using the hums and gasps to guide him.</p>
<p>She was warm beneath him, even through their nightclothes.  Warm and soft and, if not perfect, at least closer than other witches.  She tangled her fingers in his hair, pulling him back to her mouth instead of toward her breast where he’d been headed.</p>
<p>“Rosemary,” he breathed, nuzzling against her for a moment before freezing.</p>
<p>James eyes flew open as he scrambled off the bed and began babbling apologies.  If there was one thing he was sure of, it was that calling a girl by her sister’s name when you were minutes away from slipping off her nightdress was bad.  Very, <em>very</em> bad.</p>
<p>“Oh good,” Rosalind sighed, startling James out of  his ramblings. “If it was supposed to feel that strange I don’t think I’d want to do it.”</p>
<p>James could only stare.  He’d expected to get hexed, not to have Rosalind giving him a silly smile as he tried to think of what he was supposed to do next.  Though he supposed he was grateful to not have to ask Linfred to suppress her magic.  And that he’d never gotten past a bit of petting.</p>
<p>Except…James frowned as his brain slowly began to function properly again.</p>
<p>“Oi!”  He crossed his arms over his chest, hoping he didn’t look too much like he was sulking. “Lots of witches think I’m good at that, you know.”</p>
<p>Rosalind laughed as she hopped out of her bed and pushed him toward the door. “Good, go show Mary.  Tell her I said you’re not clever enough for me, silly goose will probably pretend she doesn’t fancy you if you don’t.  And James?”</p>
<p>James glanced over his shoulder more at the shift in the castle’s magic than Rosalind’s tone.  Magic didn’t just change like that for nothing.  Especially not Linfred’s magic, which had been protecting and assisting the family for centuries.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t the only book I’ve read,” she said, taking a breath before continuing. “If you hurt Rosemary, I’ll find a way to make sure you’re the last Potter ever.”</p>
<p>The magic shifting made sense this time.  James forced himself to swallow as he felt the vow take hold.  Father hadn’t prepared him for this, not in any sort of detail.  It wasn’t something he was supposed to have to worry about until he was out of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“I won’t hurt her on purpose,” he promised, because he had to say something.  It was on the tip of his tongue to add that he’d try not to hurt her by accident either, but vows were tricky.  There was no telling what magic might consider ‘trying’.</p>
<p>Rosalind looked him over for a moment before nodding and allowing the magic to dissipate. “Go on,” she said, “it’s getting late and Mary needs her sleep.”</p>
<p>James nodded, grinning and giving Rosalind a hug before leaving.  This was going to be brilliant.  He could feel it in his magic as he reached the Lady’s —</p>
<p>The Lady’s room.  In the heir suite.  Where Rosemary had been staying since she arrived at Linfred.  Linfred, which had made her her own courtyard and given her a violin.  James found himself laughing as he made a quick stop in his study.  Merlin, he was an idiot.  No wonder Father hadn’t said a word about Hatty’s room choices.  At least he didn’t have to worry about being disowned for marrying a muggle.</p>
<p>He nearly skipped to Rosemary’s room, knocking once before peeking his head around the door — and immediately rushing in.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked, wiping away the tears she wasn’t quick enough to hide.  It wasn’t like Rosemary to cry, at least not that he was aware of.  She’d been nothing but smiles since he’d met her.  Smiles and laughter and quiet humming that made him wonder how lovely it must be to hear her sing.</p>
<p>Rosemary shook her head as she scrubbed at her face. “Nothing,” she said, nearly managing to keep her voice from wobbling, “I’m fine.  I was reading a sad book, is all.  Why aren’t you with Lindy?”</p>
<p>James wordlessly picked up the book of pureblood courting traditions that was lying next to her on the bed.  It was a dreadfully dull book, but he’d hardly say it was bad enough to cause tears.</p>
<p>He watched as Rosemary’s breath hitched before she collapsed against him, her tears soaking his nightshirt.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to die,” she mumbled — and James’ magic flew out to wrap around her at the idea.</p>
<p>“You are <em>not</em> dying,” he said, pulling her closer against him and slipping them both under the blankets.</p>
<p>She wasn’t.  It wasn’t possible.  He’d just sent off for a platinum courtship necklace and no Potter intended had ever died before getting married.  His would not be the first.  He wouldn’t allow it.  Not when he had gold and magic and, according to Father, enough sheer bloody-mindedness for a dozen Potters.  He’d find a way even if it meant selling Linfred itself.</p>
<p>“I am,” Rosemary said, no longer trying to hide the way her voice broke. “The medicine stopped working months ago, that’s why Mum and Ta don’t mind us staying here.  I thought…it doesn’t sound so bad.  I won’t hurt anymore and Mum and Ta will stop fighting and Becca can see her friends and Lindy can stop worrying —”</p>
<p>“Stop it.”  James pressed a kiss to Rosemary’s forehead in the hopes of making up for the sharp tone he couldn’t help. “You’re not dying, that’s why Father hired Healer Goldstein.  He’s going to find a way to make you better.”</p>
<p>“What if he can’t?”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll hire more Healers.  Better ones.”</p>
<p>James hesitated for a moment before deciding some things were more important than propriety.</p>
<p>“I asked Father to commission a platinum courtship necklace,” he said, pushing away the thoughts of how Mother would react when she found out this was how he asked Rosemary to court. “A proper one, with the Potter insignia.”</p>
<p>Rosemary shifted to look at him, frowning slightly. “For Lindy?  You weren’t even in there that long!”</p>
<p>“Because she wasn’t the right twin,” James said, brushing Rosemary’s hair back in the hopes the contact would help keep him from holding her tighter than she might be comfortable with. “We didn’t…she said to tell you I’m not clever enough for her.”</p>
<p>He watched as the surprised blush spread across Rosemary’s face.  She looked like a pale, emaciated version of her sister, with none of Rosalind’s obvious health and fire.  James still thought she was the more beautiful twin.  Especially when she murmured a quiet ‘<em>oh!</em>’ before pulling him closer when he kissed her.</p>
<p>“Stop talking about dying,” James said softly as he pulled away. “You’re going to be Lady Potter-Cohen soon, if you’ll have me.  And no one protects their family like a Potter.”</p><hr/>
<p>James carefully eased Rosemary onto the bed when she fell asleep between gentle kisses a short time later.  He’d join her again in a moment, having her in his arms was far too nice to miss out on, but first he had to do a few things.</p>
<p>Three things, really.  He had to send a note to Father, informing him of Rosemary’s expected agreement and asking him to please ensure the ritual could be done as soon as Healer Goldstein said she was well enough.  Another to Mother, so that she could ensure the Cohens understood that magical traditions were different than muggle ones — and hopefully convince them to allow Rosemary to be fostered because James couldn’t imagine only being able to see her over holidays.</p>
<p>And one to Healer Goldstein, along with every book on Potter family magic Hatty could find.  James hadn’t been joking when he’d told Rosemary about Potter protectiveness.  There was nothing more important to Potters than family.  He only hoped that Healer Goldstein would be able to find something in the family magic that would be able to help, now that Rosemary would be part of it too.</p>
<p>James slipped back into bed when he was done, curling carefully around Rosemary.  It felt right, sleeping like this.  Like it was something they should have been doing all along.  He contented himself with the reminder that he’d not have to keep himself from sitting too close to her again.  Not now that she was all but officially his intended.  He could cuddle and kiss her all he liked.  He fully planned on making the most of it.</p>
