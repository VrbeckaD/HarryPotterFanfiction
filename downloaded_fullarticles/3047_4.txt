    <p>Harry sits between Draco and Hermione. In front of him sit Blaise and Pansy. The 18 years-old Griffindor grins slightly at the thought of the last few weeks. When he and Hermione came back for their 8th year in order to get their NEWTS he hadn’t imagine he would befriend his rivals. He never would have thought of spending time with them, enjoying their company and be happy about it. Only Draco had apologized. Pansy as well even if Harry suspected she was forced by Draco. And Blaise just laughed.</p><p>Surprisingly Hermione seems okay with them hanging out. Especially since they spend all their time in the library, studying. As for Harry, he developed quite a crush on Draco and doesn’t know what to do with it. At times he thinks it’s mutual but the git is so rude and unpredictable. He prefers not to act on it.</p><p>Harry sighs.</p><p>He looks at Hermione, hoping he would distract her enough to offer a walk outside. But only her eyes move rereading her potion essay for Slughorn. He turns his head, staring at Draco and his beautiful blonde hair, his gorgeous aquiline nose and his pink…very very very pink lips. The boy sighs one more time and blinks. He shakes his head as if it would make Draco disappear.</p><p>He hears someone clear their throat. He looks up and his eyes meet Blaise’s. He frowns rapidly when he sees the boy smirking.</p><p>“Harry” Blaise whispers.</p><p>He can feel Draco moving beside him.</p><p>“Blaise”.</p><p>“Are you bored ?”</p><p>“Hum…yes actually, out of my fucking mind.”</p><p>“Would you like to have a walk with me ?”</p><p>Harry can see Draco’s head looking up and glaring at Blaise. He doesn’t know what it means but his heart beats faster now and his hands are sweaty.</p><p>“I really need to get some fresh air. I’m suffocating here. And I can see you feel the same. So ?”</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>“Potter, relax, it’s not a proposal. Just a walk. Yes or no ?” Blaise says.</p><p>“Okay”.</p><p>“Fantastic”.</p>
