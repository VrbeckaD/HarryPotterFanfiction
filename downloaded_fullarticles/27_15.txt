<p>
  <em>“Reveal where they are and you shall be rewarded.” The snake-like man hissed. His wand pointed at a woman, she wasn’t young, but she wasn’t old either, she had dignified aristocratic features, a pureblood. The same features morphed into one of disgust as she defiantly held her own.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Even if I knew, I would never let the secret out to you. He’s my son! My family, my blood! Your rewards don’t mean anything to me; I’d die a thousand times over just so that you could meet your end. Save everyone’s time and kill me now, I’ll never bow down, not to a man like you.” She snapped out with whatever energy she had left. She’d been captured the day before, left in a cell to rot, starved and then finally subjected to the Cruciatus when she wouldn’t loosen her tongue. Today the Dark Lord himself decided to have a go. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Euphemia Potter was a strong woman. Unlike most pureblood women she didn’t bend to others’ will, she wasn’t submissive. Although, <strong>like </strong>most pureblood women, she loved her family. If given a chance she’d die for them. Her family wasn’t as large as she’d hoped. But it was more than enough. James, Fleamont and Sirius were the loves of her life. Like a mamma lion (she <strong>was</strong> a true Gryffindor) she would protect them. Lily too was like a daughter to her, and darling Harry had stolen everyone’s hearts the moment he opened his big green eyes to them. These five people meant more to her than the world and she’d be damned if she let anything happen to them. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“There are no men like me” he hissed again, pressing his wand deeper into her throat. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“There are always men like you, and they always lose, just like you will. You’re not a man, you’re a monster! As long as there’s good in the world, as long as there’s love in people’s hearts, you will lose. Kill me then, my life doesn’t matter to me so long as those I care about l\survive.” she murmured, clearly tired and done with the game Voldemort was playing. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You think you’re being brave, blood traitor’s such as yourself often think that, you’re foolish that’s all you are. Power this potent goes wasted every time people like you decide to stick up for scum. You scoff at my ideas now, but what will you do when the very essence of magic, the very purity of it will be adulterated by the same mudbloods and half breeds that you so desperately cleave to. The Potter’s are an old family, a pure family, and I don’t relish in shedding pure magical blood. Tell me where they are now and save your life. Tell me where they are and I’ll save your son and the mudblood he carries around with him. Only the boy needs to die. Tell.Me.Where.They.Are.” he accentuated every word with a deeper jab into her throat. He red eyes were livid; whatever composure he’d maintained over the last few minutes was crumbling. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Dark Lord had had his fair share of stubborn dissenters. Those who claimed to hate the very ground he walked on, usually a good threat would get to them (Wormtail, snivelling brat that he was, was a good example). But never had he encountered a person who was so defiant in their beliefs that they’d rather face death than succumb. He wanted to spare her life; she was from an old family, and influential family. She had old magical blood flowing through her veins. But she was just so damn stubborn. Frankly, anyone who disagreed with him annoyed him, but Gryffindors in their ‘holier-than-thou’ splendour got to him the worst.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>But he was the Dark Lord, legions of wizards bowed before him. He knew exactly what to do. He stepped back, and in his clear voice called out “Bring in the man”.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A flurry of activity took place. Figures rose from the shadows of the dimly lit room, voices started to ring out from beyond the cell; Euphemia could hear the shuffling of robes and the scuttle of footsteps even with the damaged senses. Her heart filled with dread for she never knew if they’d captured Fleamont or not. She knew deep down that he wasn’t dead if he were then the death eater scum wouldn’t have wasted a second to shove it in her face. She knew her husband was strong; he was an Auror, almost up for promotion. He had faced so much; surely he wouldn’t let snivelling bastards like these to take over. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She was brought out of her reverie as her gaze landed on a man whose robes were raggedy, hair dishevelled, and face bloody. She would have denied at first glance that the man was her husband but as the man opened his eyes, the lovely brown of his irises confirmed that he was, in fact, Fleamont Potter. Her heart shattered at the sore sight. No longer was he the same Fleamont who even with his unkempt hairstyle looked handsome, the man before her looked broken, not physically but in every other way possible. His eyes lit up just barely as he saw her. Love shone in them all the same, but this time he was too tired, too worn out and simply too weak to convey much else. He knew in his core that he’d never compromise his son’s family, not that he knew where they were, but even if he did, he’d never. He would rather die.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Dolohov roughly grabbed him by his neck and shoved him at his master’s feet. Fleamont didn’t fight him, he just couldn’t.  “The lady Potter seems to be too honourable to see what is right, too noble. Perhaps she needs a bit of… incentive” he finished evilly as an equally evil look flashed in his servant’s eyes. Without skipping a beat his wand was out and a silent Cruciatus was cast upon the Potter patriarch. His gut-wrenching cries tore through the silence, Euphemia felt like crying out as well with her love. The man that she loved so deeply was now being subjected to unfathomable torture and she could do very little about it. The only way to stop it was to speak up and she already explained why she wouldn’t do it. She forced her face to remain impassive, to not let any emotion show, it was difficult but she did, she focused on Harry’s happy cries, his mindless babble, she focused on anything and everything that would take her away from this misery. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fleamont’s cries eventually stopped after what felt like hours and could very well be that long. Voldemort had at this point lost all semblance of sanity and was now very close to stomping his feet on the ground like a petulant child. Nothing seemed to work on them! He tried ligillimency and found nothing suspicious, but after being in the minds of several highly trained wizards and witches alike, he now knew to not completely trust the visions he saw. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I tried to show you mercy yet you chose to walk over me. I gave you a choice and now you’ve made it. Think long and hard Lady Potter, you do not need to die, you have your final chance, speak up now or see the man you love die.” his cold voice spoke with malice. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“We may not have lived a long life, but we’ve lived a happy one, we’ve seen love, we’ve seen joy and now, we’ve seen pure evil. There’s nothing more left for us to do. Do you think that we’re scared of what lies beyond? We’ll be alive in the memories of those who love us and that’s all that matters.” Euphemia spoke with authority, she very well knew that she was going to die. And in these final moments, she felt that she needed to be stronger than ever. She focused on the five faces of those that mattered even at times including sweet Remus and Peter in the recollections. She let the love she felt for the people she was protecting fill her as she saw Voldemort lift his wand. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her husband had probably already died; she saw a flash of green go by in her periphery. But she couldn’t break down now, she had to be <strong>strong. </strong> “Avada Kedavra” she heard being muttered as a flash of brilliant green erupted from the tip of the yew wand held in pale lifeless hands.  The green that would’ve scared others felt welcoming to her. she imagined looking into Harry’s loving eyes that ironically held the same colour. The light hit her and without a cry, her body slumped forward as all life left it. The lifeless body was now on the floor along with that of her husband’s, no one in the room spoke, not because they felt remorseful, but only because they were trying to think about what to do next. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Clear them out” the Dark Lord muttered, and with a swish of his robes, he left the dimly lit dungeon.</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em>As he left, one of many Death eaters stationed around the corridor too picked up his pace and started to make his way out of the building, the man was one Severus Snape. Ever since he’d heard what his lord planned for the Potter family he’d decided to switch sides, and now as an informant behind enemy lines, it was his job to be the eyes and ears of Albus Dumbledore, and he needed to hear about what had just happened. Two of the most prominent Order members had just been killed, all in Voldemort’s pursuit of Lily and her family. By the looks of it, Voldemort would not stop till he got what he wanted, he was set in his belief that it was Harry who was destined to be his end and nobody could tell him otherwise. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Snape muttered an obscure excuse and walked to the ends of the Manor’s premises, out of the anti-apparition wards and disapparated to deliver the news to Dumbledore in person. This was sensitive information and he couldn’t risk getting caught sending a letter and being in cohorts with the leader of the Light side.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Meanwhile, in the Malfoy Manor, the Dark Lord was sitting at the head of the long table, making it obvious to even the most inobservant that he was the one who actually controlled the power, not Lucius who was, in fact, the legal owner of the building. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Beside him on his knees stood Peter Pettigrew, sniffling and whimpering without any proper reason to. The Lord spoke in his clear voice, “What news do you bring Wormtail?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Even though he never showed any weakness, it was slightly evident that he wasn’t in the right frame of mind to deal with the incompetency that usually ensued whenever a matter concerned the pathetic excuse of a man that was Peter. The man in question himself knew from countless misadventures that an angry Voldemort wasn’t good for anybody least of all the person who put him in that mood.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He knew his master needed rest and he knew that his master wouldn’t do well with dealing with another person today, but the news was important and basically the Holy Grail they were looking for. He knew that if he kept the information from his lord for more than a second longer, he would in all probability die. So without going through the usual salutations he jumped right in and said “The Potter’s have made me the secret keeper.  It was Black before but now they deemed me worthy and unnoticeable enough to keep them hidden” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Bright red eyes that were once closed in exhaustion now shot open, his grip on the chair handle tightened as his thoughts ran around in a whirlwind. This new information triggered a series of emotions and thoughts that were going by too fast for the experienced wizard to comprehend. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He stood up, incarcerated Wormtail wordlessly, brought him close and hissed into his face “Where are they?” Peter struggled to answer as the ropes tightened incredibly painfully across his throat before they loosened considerably. “G-Go-Godric’s Hollow” he choked out before the spell was removed and he slumped forward gagging and coughing. A quick sweep of Peter’s mind told Voldemort that the information was, in fact, authentic and he allowed himself to rejoice.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>As Wormtail looked up, he saw his master in all his glory, a sinister smile on his face. He rolled his head around as if stretching out. “Thank you Wormtail, you shall be rewarded” he spoke in his cold, high voice. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>On 30<sup>th</sup> October 1981, Lord Voldemort knew where his potential enemy lived; all that was left was to get his parents out of the way and to kill the barely one-year-old child.  His dreams of world domination would now come true, with no one to stop them, not even a simpering brat who could barely even say a word. The Dark Lord would rise stronger than ever after having killed Harry Potter and finally would the world realize the truth behind his words. People would flock to him and support his cause, magic would reign. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Little did he know that killing Harry Potter wouldn’t be easy? For the sacrifice Euphemia made would keep Harry safe, it would make sure that the five people she loved and thought about before dying would triumph, always.</em>
