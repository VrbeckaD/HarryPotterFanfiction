    <p>It comes in the form of a man, not entirely unlike The One Who Lived.</p><p>It comes while Harry is having a pint of pale ale with his team. He leans back in the creaky wooden chair of the pub and snorts with laughter when Whitney sloshes foam all over her robes, grinning unrepentantly when she flips two fingers at the rest of them. She doesn’t mean it; she’s in just as good a mood as everyone else is, the black-market magic traders they’d been tracking from London to Troyes finally in custody. </p><p>It’s taken weeks and Harry misses home, misses his friends. But his team, hand-picked for this mission, has worked hard and they deserve a night off. He’s got Portkey-activation discretion, no need to rush back. It’s only a couple of extra forms, and he doesn’t mind filling them out for the opportunity to buy a few rounds in thanks, to sit in a pub with his coworkers, to spend some time wearing his own face in a city small and far away enough from London that he’s not at great risk of being recognised. Harry takes a pull of his warm beer and relaxes.</p><p>It comes with a swish and flick, simple as <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i></p><p>It travels twelve hundred kilometres away, as Hermione sits down in the Great Hall, her skin still flushed, her muscles still twitching with little zings of pleasure. She eyes Rose and Hugo to make sure they’re behaving themselves and makes a mental note to discuss expanding the family table; as younger witches and wizards are taking on fellowships, more and more children not yet placed in Houses have been taking up occupancy. </p><p>Ron ambles into the Hall a few minutes later, a satisfied glint in his eye and an overly-casual expression on his face. Hermione bites back a smile at the tiny smirk he shoots her as he bends to check on the children and say goodbye. Hugo waves at him cheerfully but largely ignores him. Rose, of course, pouts. Ron pets her hair and whispers something in her ear that makes her perk up — probably a promise of treats when he returns from London in the morning. Hermione’s shiver of pleasure grows into something fierce and proud, all-encompassing, watching them. Ron straightens and lifts an eyebrow at her, a more subtle version of the <i>I’ll see you soon, but not soon enough, Ms Granger,</i> than he gave her back in her office before dinner. Hermione hasn’t blushed over sex in years, but she does now and it feels splendid. She returns his knowing look with a nod and gazes at him as he strides out, trying not to sound like a lovelorn teenager when she sighs and spoons crispy roasted potatoes onto her plate.</p><p>It comes with a murmur, not too unlike the ones every pureblood wizarding child grew up hearing.</p><p>It comes in between, to London, as Ron steps out of the Floo and coughs out a lungful of chimney dust. He’s pretty sure Kreacher leaves the fireplaces sooty to spite him; he’s been clear from the start that he doesn’t approve of people using 12 Grimmauld Place as a travelling stopgap. But despite his feelings on the subject, Kreacher appears out of nowhere, as if waiting for Ron to request coffee, and Ron knows he’d make some if he asked. He never thought the curmudgeonly old bastard would have a soft spot for him of all people, but Kreacher’s loyal as hell to Harry, and Ron supposes he can sense that Ron feels the same, in that way house elves seem to know so much while saying so little. </p><p>He smiles at Kreacher with a shake of his head, mind turning back to Hermione as he makes for the street. He hates leaving for an overnight shift, though she’s understanding about how the extra work has been piling up, with Harry gone. But it did afford him with even more reason — as if he’d ever need an excuse — to turn his bossy, brilliant wife into a needy tangle of boneless, gasping pleasure. He walks down the street, whistling, and reminds himself to pay attention the next time Nev blathers on about his Most Extraordinary New Plant; maybe it'll give him a clue about what to buy as a thank-you for taking the kids out for a few hours before dinner. </p><p>It comes with a final puff of air, the trembling sort that was, for two years, so common at Malfoy Manor.</p><p>It starts with a slide into the space between Harry and his loved ones, as Draco dithers over whether he should change before heading down to the hotel bar, perhaps into something that hints he’d be receptive to an invite to the new club across the way. For all that he’d hoped his escape from the clutches of the Ministry would resemble a holiday, the last few days have been nothing but work — and boring work, at that. It’s a nice change of pace, he supposes, but he’s given a firm <i>no</i> to the offer of heading out of Wizarding Paris tonight to chance a Muggle restaurant. He’s already fulfilled his obligations of friendship and duty, and if he’s not wrong, the young wizard behind the bar has been exchanging glances with him for the last two nights. Draco is seldom wrong about such things these days, and he’d much rather take a chance on his suspicions instead. </p><p>He brushes his hair into a smooth quiff and pats on a bit of aftershave, then decides to stay in his robes. They’re as bland a colour as can be, but they do give him an air of mystery if not power, and any shade of grey has always brought out his eyes, anyway.</p><p>It comes with a crash of physics and magic as soon as the sacrifice collapses, blood sinking into the earth. </p><p>The air shimmers and there’s a single beat of silence, every living thing within a kilometre somehow recognising the violation of the natural order. Then a passerby shakes off his tremble with a laugh and says, “Quelqu'un doit avoir marché sur ma tombe.”</p><p>His wife laughs as well, but as they continue on their way, the bitterly sweet smell of dying poppies brushes past him, and he wonders how enough of them are left so late in the season for the cloying scent to cling to him so. </p><p>It fits itself into the body that fell, rising slowly. Its eyes are milky, its hands are bloodless, and everything it sees is an abomination it must cure. It brings death to one, to another and another, and some scream and topple but others join it, the crackle of their magic growing to extend their reach. Like a soundwave, like a Muggle bomb, the curse ripples out, shutting down magical communications and feeding on magic itself. It hangs in the air, heavy and thick as it travels north and south, east and west, spreading out from Paris to hunt for those who can join the swarm and those that are not worthy enough to. </p><p>And if the body who first rose could understand what it was seeing, it would object; it would even perhaps fight the things it has brought into existence. </p><p>It would know there were things it would want to protect. </p><p>It doesn’t. </p><p>Nor does it know that the spell turned out <i>wrong</i>. But neither does it care; it only cares to feed on another, and another, abominations all if they are not part of the masses. </p><p>Though never starving, Death has nevertheless been hungry between the great banquets of wars. Capitalising on the curious new form its been given, its loathing for plucking individual fruits from the vine will become apparent as it cuts a swath through the first feast it's been offered in what feels like an eternity. But those tempting desserts who have defied its clutches are an ever gleeful thought in the back of its mind. </p><p>Death heads for Draco first, because he’s the closest. Harry next — and oh, how it's craved him — in less than thirty minutes, using the force of destruction it's been allotted to slash down every obstacle in its path. It will be in London with Ron hours later, and will work its way slowly up toward Hermione in Scotland, as she tucks her children into bed at night.</p><p>It comes for them all and though each of them have looked Death in the eye, though Harry has shaken its hand, none of them are aware of its impending arrival. When Death comes for them again, it will be nothing like the battle that came before the fall of Voldemort, the dawn cresting and dazzling everyone with its light. When Death comes for them again, it comes with sun slipping behind the horizon and bringing with it darkness. </p><p>They think they remember what it was like, but memories have a way of fading over time. It’s been ten years, five months, and one day since the last time their names were on its list.</p><p>Even if they remembered, they wouldn’t know what to expect.</p>
