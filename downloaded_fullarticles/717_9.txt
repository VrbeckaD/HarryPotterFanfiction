It was good to be home, particularly after how annoying of day it had been; she was reminded so often that for all her drive to be political, she truly loathed politicians. Today had been tiring, though worthwhile, and she was more than happy to be home.</p><p>She shrugged her jacket off and hung it on a hook near the door, smiling as she heard what she thought was laughing deeper into the house.

Hermione almost burst into the living room, skidding to a halt as she did.</p><p>Harry was sprawled out on the ground, staring up at her upside down, a smile bright on his lightly bearded face.
