    <p>Despite everything, he still looked the same. </p><p>Hair still untameable, round glasses, soft face, skinny and tall, and of course, the jagged red scar on his forehead. </p><p>Draco had hoped something might have changed about Potter, made him different, changed the way Draco looked at him. But it was still the same, except their rivalry took place at the Ministry of Magic instead of at Hogwarts.</p><p>He rolled his eyes as the golden fucking trio walked into the elevator. Hermione said, “Good morning, Draco.” Business as usual. Ron gave him an awkward nod. Potter opened his mouth, frowned, and settled for a strange half-smile.</p><p>Draco made a (mostly) involuntary noise of mockery, which ignited an immediate response.</p><p>“What, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Harry, leave it.” Hermione’s voice was still as exasperated as it had always been whenever Draco got a rise out of Potter. </p><p>“Oh, nothing, Potter. I thought for a moment that you’d forgotten how to speak.” The snarky comment was out of his mouth before he even thought to hold back. He regretted it almost instantly. Everyone here already despised him, what was he doing, pissing off their golden boy?</p><p>But what had changed since school, it seemed, was that Potter didn’t retort back or recklessly pull his wand on Draco. He just shrugged, and got off the elevator at the next stop.</p><p>Draco felt embarrassed. Of course Potter hadn’t pulled his wand on him, they were working at the Ministry of Fucking Magic. This wasn’t high school. You couldn’t just mess around and get detention for it. If you mess around, you get sacked. Especially if both your parents are in Azkaban for war crimes.</p><p>Draco let out his breath in a frustrated sigh, and began the long trek to his office. Everyone who had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts had automatically been given a job as an auror if they wanted one, except of course, those who had fought on the other side. </p><p>Most of the Slytherins hadn't been as lucky as Draco. </p><p>He still didn't know why he had got the job. He almost hadn't applied at all, so sure that he would be denied, given the fact that he was literally a Death Eater. He even had the fucking tattoo, for Merlin's sake. But something had made him send in the application, and for some reason, he had been accepted. </p><p>Every other Slytherin student had been rejected. </p><p>The guilt was there, but Draco was used to it. He'd had the same feeling in his gut for years, from the first time he'd realised he liked boys and not girls, until he'd first met Potter, and every waking moment since then when his thoughts had drifted from his family duty to the dark haired boy that intrigued him so much.</p><p>"Malfoy. Have you finished your reports yet?" Hermione stood over him, looking distinctly annoyed that she had been designated the task of speaking to him.</p><p>"I put them on your desk an hour ago, Granger," he sighed.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Well, they aren't there now."</p><p>Draco shrugged, signalling that this conversation was over. He had put the reports on her desk. What happened after that was someone else's problem.</p><p>-</p><p>"Malfoy looks different," Harry said, scowling at the blonde from across the room. </p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Ron mumbled through a mouthful of chocolate.</p><p>"I dunno. He's… paler."</p><p>Ron choked on his chocolate frog. "I'm pretty sure that's impossible, mate. He's basically transparent."</p><p>"Yeah, which is unusual." </p><p>Harry watched Malfoy open a file and look at its contents. </p><p>"Don't both of you have work to be doing?" Hermione had walked over to them. Her hair had been trimmed to shoulder length, and was tied back in a neat bun. She looked very professional, unlike Ron and Harry.</p><p>“Some things never change, do they?” Ron sighed. His hair was getting longer, falling in his face constantly. His robes were tattered and worn, shoes scuffed, lounging on his desk chair.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You. Always bugging us to do work.” </p><p>“Well, if I didn’t, you would never get anything done.”</p><p>“Yeah, but we just do it badly anyway.”</p><p>“You’ll only learn by practise, Ronald.”</p><p>“Oh, we’re busting out the full name now, are we?”</p><p>“For Merlin’s sake, I’m not trying to-”</p><p>Harry zoned them out. Their bickering was almost constant in the workplace, as it had been in school. There had been the brief grace period just after they had got together, when it seemed their fighting had only been because neither wanted to admit their feelings for the other, but now it was back to the usual.</p><p>Well, he was one to talk. He and Ginny hadn’t been doing much better lately.</p><p>Harry picked up today’s Daily Prophet, looking to peruse an article on garden gnomes, but unfortunately the front page caught his eye.</p><p>
  <em><strong>INEXPERIENCED AURORS: THE DOWNFALL OF THE NEW MINISTRY</strong><br/>
HOW AURORS THAT HAVE LITTLE FIELD EXPERIENCE BEING HIRED IS PUTTING US ALL IN DANGER</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In the Battle of Hogwarts, many of our best aurors were killed by You Know Who and his followers. The new Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, has assured us that the ministry has made up for this by recruiting new aurors from those that fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. “The new aurors are young, yes,” Shacklebolt said, “however, they are all receiving the proper training that all new aurors require. We are not putting inexperienced aurors out into the field.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There is no proof for or against Shacklebolt’s statement, however, there is evidence to say that the aurors are slacking. In the last two weeks alone, there have been multiple reports of muggle attacks, secret meetings and dark magic which people are fearing to be a resurgence of Death Eater activity. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Reginald Flourence, who is a senior member working in the auror office, has assured us that there is no real concern. “These are just people messing around and trying to scare everyone. Voldemort is dead, and his Death Eaters have either followed suit, or ended up in Azkaban.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>However, another ministry employee, who wished to remain anonymous, has said the opposite. “The Ministry is crumbling,” they said, “Shacklebolt doesn’t know what to do since most of the Ministry’s best employees were either killed or turned out to be Death Eaters. He has hired inexperienced teenagers in a poor attempt to-”</em>
</p><p>“Harry, the Prophet is full of shit. Stop reading that nonsense,” Hermione said, snatching the newspaper from his hands.</p><p>“Hermione, to quote you, ‘It’s good to know what the enemy is thinking.’” </p><p>Ron snickered.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “When I said that, the Prophet was working directly for Voldemort. Now it’s just a bunch of nosy journalists trying to find an interesting story.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. He still thought it was useful to know what the public was reading and thinking. </p><p>“Well, it’s almost 2. We should get to training.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “I’ll see you two there, I just have a couple of things to finish up first.” She bustled off to her desk.</p><p>“Do you think she actually knows what’s going on, or is she just as confused as the rest of us?” Ron asked. </p><p>Harry shook his head. “No idea.”</p><p>To say that they had been thrown in the deep end was an understatement. </p><p>They had always been told that auror training was rigorous. Harry knew it was difficult to get in especially, because of the difficulty he had in Fifth Year to try and convince Umbridge that he could be an auror. He had almost had his dreams crushed after his O.W.Ls, thinking that he needed an O instead of an E in potions. But Slughorn had replaced Snape, and Harry had taken potions.</p><p>However, none of them had done their N.E.W.Ts. Even the students who had (almost) completed their seventh year hadn’t written exams.</p><p>But, everyone who had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and had finished school had been given an opportunity to be an auror, if they wished. Most people had said yes. </p><p>They reached the training hall fairly quickly, and Hermione was somehow already there. </p><p>“How in the name of Merlin did you get here before us?” Ron asked, incredulous.</p><p>Hermione shrugged.</p><p>“I swear she still has that time turner,” Ron muttered to Harry as Kingsley walked into the room. </p><p>“Quiet down, quiet down, training is about to begin.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>Draco stood on the end of the row of aurors, separated from the bunch. The majority were Gryffindors - pretty much all of them had chosen to be aurors. There were also a lot of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, but he was alone. Pansy had laughed when he’d suggested she apply to. “Even if was allowed in, I wouldn’t be able to stand it. It would just be Potter and his friends getting all the glory, and us on the sidelines.”</p><p>She had a point. </p><p>“Today we’re going to be practising disillusionment spells. They’re pretty basic, but a lot of people who train to be aurors fail the exam because they can’t do the basics.”</p><p>Usually, aurors were chosen by a much more rigorous screening process. Only those with the highest marks - generally Outstanding in almost all subjects, and definitely nothing below an Exceeds Expectations, were chosen for training. Then, they were put into the auror academy for two years and trained before they took a final exam, with written, and practical elements, as well as a psychological screening, to finally become an auror.</p><p>After the Battle of Hogwarts, less than half of the aurors remained. </p><p>Desperate times called for desperate measures. </p><p>The new recruits had been put straight to work, with training squeezed into their schedules. There was a senior auror put to train the recruits, in pairs, as well as general classes. </p><p>Shacklebolt finished demonstrating the spell, and they began to practise. </p><p>“Deflectere!” </p><p>Draco immediately felt the sensation of an egg being cracked on his head, and the cold washing over his entire body. When he looked down, he could only see the floor, with a shimmering, glassy texture over the area where he knew his body was.</p><p>He looked around. Only a few other people had succeeded on their first try. Granger, of course; Potter, also expected; some others whose names he didn’t know; and, surprisingly, Neville Longbottom. </p><p>“Good effort! Those of you who failed, make sure your pronunciation is correct. Finnigan, your wand movement is slightly off…” as Shacklebolt moved between the students, correcting them, Draco waved his wand and the charm dissipated. He felt the reverse of the original spell - a warmth flooding him from head to toe.</p><p>-</p><p>It took a couple more tries for Ron to get it, Hermione correcting him until he slowly disappeared. The three of them stood around for a while, until most people had succeeded, and Kingsley moved on. The rest of the lesson went similarly - Harry and Hermione easily performing spells, Ron close behind, and the rest of the class (spare a few others), taking a while longer.</p><p>“Even Neville’s doing better than me,” Ron huffed, “look.” He pointed at Neville, who performed a perfect Finite Incantatem, exploding the floating beanbag which Kingsley had conjured for them.</p><p>“Ron, don’t beat yourself up. You’re still doing really well,” Hermione said, “you just need to listen more.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Ron snapped, glaring at Hermione. </p><p>“I’m just saying, Ron, Kingsley shows us exactly how to perform the spells. Just copy him exactly, and-”</p><p>“Not all of us have photographic fucking memory, Hermione.”</p><p>Harry tuned out their bickering once again, and found his eyes came to rest on Malfoy. His beanbag, like Harry’s, had disintegrated first try. Malfoy was impressively good at magic - at a higher level than most of Dumbledore’s Army. </p><p>Then again, Malfoy had been a Death Eater. </p><p>Kingsley wrapped up the lesson soon after that, and they headed home. Hermione was still living with her parents in London, but Ron and Harry apparated back to the Burrow with Mr Weasley. </p><p>Term ended the next day, which meant Mrs Weasley was busy making Ginny’s bed, and she immediately set Harry and Ron on degnomeing the garden.</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“Your sister is coming home tomorrow, Ronald,” she said, glaring at him.</p><p>“Ginny doesn’t care about the gnomes-”</p><p>“Ron, just listen to your mother, please,” Mr Weasley said, giving him a look that begged him not to make Molly mad. </p><p>Ron obliged, scowling, and stomped out into the garden. </p><p>“As if Ginny will even notice whether we’ve got bloody gnomes or not,” Ron said, reaching deep into a bush to pull out one of the little creatures.<br/>
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, not really listening. He missed Ginny. Of course he did. He hadn’t seen her in three months. But there was also something else in the pit of his stomach, telling him that he was also dreading seeing Ginny a little bit. </p><p>They fought so much now, and they hardly got any time to spend just the two of them with Harry working every day. Even weekends were filled with writing report after report that they hadn’t finished during the week, and when Harry and Ron were finally finished it was all they could do not to pass out on their way up the stairs.  </p><p>They were definitely in over their heads.</p>
