</p><p>‘No, Scorpius. You have to. You went to the trouble of making it for her, you can’t chicken out now,’ said Albus.</p><p>A visibly uncomfortable Scorpius was sitting across from him. He was pale and rocking slightly, a full plate of food pushed far in front of him. He was awkwardly covering something on the table with the sleeves of his robes.</p><p>‘I’m not chickening out,’ said Scorpius. ‘I’ve just decided that I don’t think this is wise.’</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes and picked up a second slice of toast. Around them everyone was chatting and giggling, exchanging Valentine’s Day cards and gifts. The smell of thick perfume coated the air; pungent and overpowering.</p><p>A light sprinkling of confetti had been scattered along the four tables, tiny pink and red hearts. Scorpius feared he may accidentally ingest some. There were rows of matching paper chains on the walls, separated by large three-dimensional crimson hearts which seemed to ripple in the sunlight. Instead of candles, the Great Hall ceiling was occupied by a flock of golden pixies, who showered those beneath them with sparkling dust.</p><p>Scorpius felt like he’d somehow swallowed a swarm of particularly angry pixies by accident, and they were most eager to get out. Every breath felt laboured and his hands were sweaty, no matter how many times he wiped them on his robes.</p><p>‘Here’s Rose,’ said Albus, ‘now’s your chance. She’s on her own. Look!’</p><p>Scorpius looked up just as Rose was taking her seat at the Gryffindor table. She drew a pattern in the confetti before picking some up and sprinkling some on the table, all the while smiling to herself. </p><p>‘No, Albus. I don’t want to. I can’t. I’ve changed my mind. Remember the beginning of the year? She didn’t even look at the rose I got her.’</p><p>‘Exactly! You’ve got nothing to lose,’ said Albus.</p><p>‘Yes, thank you, Albus. I was already aware of how low the bar was set.’</p><p>‘It’s like my Mum says: nothing ventured, nothing gained. Now, go on!’</p><p>Albus forced Scorpius onto his feet, thrusting the card he had made for Rose into his hands.</p><p>‘You can do this, Scorpius,’ he said with a push.</p><p>Scorpius swallowed and began to walk. He wasn’t aware up until then just how heavy and large his feet apparently were. How he seemed to trudge along so gracelessly. He clutched onto his Valentine, making sure not to crease or damage it in any way. The Gryffindor table was getting closer. Rose was getting closer. She hadn’t noticed him yet, but she would, and that was what scared him.</p><p>Scorpius turned around. Albus smiled, spurring him on, shooting him a quick thumbs up and nodding in encouragement. Scorpius cleared his throat.</p><p>‘Hello… Rose!’</p><p>His voice cracked. His whole body shuddered in response. Rose flinched and looked up, her expression somewhere between bewildered and cautious.</p><p>Scorpius seemed to have spoken much louder than he’d thought too, as some of the other Gryffindors on either side of Rose turned towards him, curious to locate the source of the loud squeaking. Scorpius refused to look at their sneering faces.</p><p>Rose’s dark eyes swept over him, surveying him keenly. They stopped at the card in his hands and immediately widened. She opened her mouth to say something, just as Yann Fredericks and Polly Chapman came strolling towards them. They were holding hands, their fingers tightly woven together.</p><p>Polly was cradling a stuffed teddy bear holding onto a red heart. They were both grinning and laughing out loud. Their grins were replaced with scowls when they saw Scorpius stood before them.</p><p>Scorpius bowed his head and turned to go, but Polly blocked his path.</p><p>‘What are you doing here? I think you’ll find your table is over there,’ she said with a flourish and point of the finger.</p><p>‘I – I know, I’m just going, I – ’</p><p>‘Was he talking to you?’ Polly said, glaring down at Rose. She tried to speak but Polly cut across her.</p><p>‘Why were you talking to Rose?’ she demanded, turning once again to Scorpius.</p><p>Yann lunged forward suddenly and snatched the card from Scorpius’s hands. Scorpius felt his face go crimson.</p><p>‘You’ve got to be joking,’ sniggered Yann, passing the card over to Polly.</p><p>‘Who knew the son of Voldemort had a heart,’ cackled Polly, as people began to get up and gather around them. ‘Oh look, Rose, he’s even drawn a picture of you inside. How sweet!’ she mocked.</p><p>Polly began screaming with laughter, as she threw Scorpius’s card down on the table in front of Rose.</p><p>‘Wait until I tell Karl about this!’ laughed Yann.</p><p>Scorpius looked at Rose, concentrating on her as the crowd around howled and screamed as Polly performed what she could remember of the verse he had written in the card two nights before.</p><p align="left">Rose smiled politely. Her shoulders were hunched slightly, her face looked pained and regretful.</p><p>‘Stop it, Polly,’ she said in a clear voice. ‘That’s enough.’</p><p>Polly merely rolled her eyes and carried on. Yann’s present to her, the stuffed teddy bear, lay discarded and forgotten on the confetti-littered floor.</p><p>Albus arrived suddenly, pushing through the crowd. He steered Scorpius away, elbowing past Yann as he did, only letting go of Scorpius when they reached the Entrance Hall.</p><p>‘Ignore them,’ said Albus. ‘They’re not worth it. They’re just bullies.’</p><p>Scorpius nodded, masking his pain with an enthusiastic smile.</p><p>‘I know,’ he said, clearing his throat. 'It's alright. It went as well as I expected. Anyway… I forgot my Charms homework. I better go it. Mustn’t upset Flitwick.’</p><p>He ran off before Albus could reply.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Later that day, Scorpius went to the Owlery. He sat down and took some parchment, a quill and a pot of ink from his bag and began to write.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Mum,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Happy Valentine’s Day! I hope you received my card this morning. I got yours (as well as the sweets!) Thank you so much. I shared the sweets with Albus, I know you won’t mind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Things didn’t quite go as planned with Rose. She smiled at least, so I’m still hopeful. I wrote the verse you suggested and I’m sure she liked it really.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>All my love to you and Dad.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your son,</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Scorpius</em>
