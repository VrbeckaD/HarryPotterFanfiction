  <span>June’s hand ghosted across the picture frame, her delicate fingers leaving streak marks through the thick layer of dust on the glass. In the photo, a tall man with pale skin and onyx hair gazed at the camera, his handsome features marred by a slight sneer. June couldn’t stop staring. The photo had faded significantly over time, but the secretive look in the man’s dark eyes had withstood the test of time. Sighing, June gently placed the photo back into the wooden box that she pulled it from, and made her way over to the older woman in the corner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mum, who’s that in the photo?” June asked, sinking down onto the dusty loveseat next to her mother and twisting the cap off of another bottle of Butterbeer. Rose pulled her head out of the box she had been packing and distractedly wiped her brow with the back of her hand. Her dark hair was streaked with gray, and most of it was plastered to her forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which photo, dear?” Rose said, slightly out of breath. June pointed behind her and raised her eyebrow. “The antique photo in that equally antique wooden box that doesn’t even belong in this century. You know, the man who looks like he walked out of a Twilfitt and Tattings catalogue?” June’s voice was light and teasing, but she frowned when she saw her mother tense in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought I had gotten rid of that box,” Rose said in a voice so quiet, June wasn’t sure she was meant to hear it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would you get rid of it, Mum? Who is that?” June asked again, her curiosity and concern rising. Her mother continued packing the box in front of her and didn’t answer. A long silence passed before June pressed her again. Sighing, Rose got to her feet with a slight groan and joined June on the loveseat. Grabbing June’s hands, Rose lifted her eyes to her daughter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should never have kept this a secret, my love. But as time passed, I found it harder and harder to tell anyone the truth. I thought that if I got rid of that box, the secret would die with it, and when I died, I would literally take the secret to my grave. It seems as though the box has a mind of its own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess that I should start from the beginning. My mother and father were married in 1998. Little did my father know, but his new bride was already six weeks pregnant with me.” June nodded; her mother being conceived out of wedlock was no family secret. Her grandparents had barely graduated school when they wed. Rose continued. “My mother and father put on a good front to the rest of the world, but behind closed doors, the two of them couldn’t be any more different. The two of them married each other out of expectation, not love. My father had aspirations of wealth, riches and luxury, while my mother was more interested in books, knowledge and learning.” Rose leaned back into the couch and closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This eventually drove an even deeper wedge between my parents, especially when I was born a few months later. My father was a redhead with light eyes, but I came out with hair black as pitch and eyes as dark as the deepest parts of the ocean. Most of their neighbors didn’t think anything of it, because my mother had brown, curly hair and brown eyes, so my features were not that alarming. But, my father was suspicious for years. He never trusted my mother after I was born, and was convinced that my mother was having an affair. Years later, after my mother died, my father’s suspicions were confirmed when he discovered that box in the attic. Inside the box was a letter addressed to me, detailing the truth about who my real father was, along with a picture frame.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>June gasped and felt her heart plummet. Her grandfather had died when she was very young, but she remembered Grandpa Ronald having a kind heart and warm eyes. She couldn’t imagine the amount of heartbreak that her grandfather had experienced at the discovery of his wife’s affair. The discovery of this secret made her heart burn with hatred for her Grandma Hermione. Frowning, June walked back over to the antique box and pulled the dusty photo out, examining it further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand, Mum. This photo looks like it was taken at the turn of the 20th century, not at the beginning of the millennium. How is this even possible?” Turning to look over her shoulder, June saw her mother shrug. “I can only assume that my mother had an old film camera that she used to take that photo.” Rose said. Nodding slowly, June dug further through the box and grabbed the letter her mother had mentioned, and made her way back to the couch with the letter and photo in hand, and sank down next to her mother again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>”So, I’m assuming that the man in this photo is your real father, then?” June asked, pinching the bridge of her nose. Rose nodded solemnly, resting her hand on the photo. “This is why I never told you. Your Grandpa Ron was a good man, and an even better father, even though he knew I wasn’t his. He continued to raise me as his own, even after your grandmother passed before I was old enough to go to school.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you feel about all of this, all these years later?” June asked, leaning her head against her mum. Rose absentmindedly played with one of June’s honey colored curls, but didn’t answer. June took her silence as an unwillingness to discuss that topic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And Uncle Hugo?” June asked, not wanting to know the answer. Rose threw her head back and laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hugo is your grandfather’s son, through and through. If the red hair wasn’t the first sign,” Rose giggled. June felt the corners of her mouth lift.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, do you know his name? Your biological father's name?” June asked, turning to face her mum. A shadow passed over Rose’s face before she answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Riddle. T-T-Tom Riddle.”</span>
