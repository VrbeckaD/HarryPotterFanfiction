    <p>The color scheme was well chosen, the font entirely appropriate.</p><p>The parchment even <em>smelled</em> nice, and the owl was perfectly well-behaved.</p><p>There was, objectively, nothing offensive at all about the invitation.</p><p>But Harry took it as a personal insult.</p><p>The other annoying thing about the situation was that it was the <em>second</em> time in which Harry’s life had completely changed by a cream colored envelope.</p><p>“Oh,” was all he managed to say or to think, as he set it down and stared around at his empty flat. “Well, fuck me.”</p><p> </p><p>“So,” he brought up conversationally at Ron and Hermione’s later that night, all of them safely two drinks in, “have either of you received an invitation to Draco Malfoy’s wedding?”</p><p>The air around them stilled and he received two stunned looks in response, Hermione’s third glass of wine halfway to her mouth.</p><p>“Guess not, then,” Harry muttered, sitting back in his chair.</p><p>“Have <em>you</em>?” Hermione asked incredulously, setting her glass down on the kitchen counter and leaning forward, anything they had previously been discussing rendered irrelevant for the night.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry replied nonchalantly, trying not to let on how much his stomach was churning and how his mind was swimming in curiosity, the thought of the elegant invitation on what must have been incredibly expensive parchment personally addressed to him camping out in the forefront of his mind. “It’s in December.”</p><p>“Paris in December? That's a hell of a destination wedding.” Ron snorted, looking wholly unconcerned as he stuffed another cracker in his mouth. "I say keep it simple, keep it local: that's what me and Hermione did."</p><p>Harry stared at him.</p><p>“<em>What</em> are you talking about, Ronald?” Hermione asked, shaking her head at her husband in disbelief.</p><p>“Doesn’t he live in Paris, still, surviving off his parents?”</p><p>“Ronald, we’ve had this conversation at least twice,” Hermione sighed.</p><p>“What conversation?”</p><p>“Draco Malfoy has worked in the Ministry for over a month now,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “He’s in my division, actually. I’m not exactly sure of his title, but he’s been minorly involved in some of my cases over the past few weeks.”</p><p>“Well, what’s he doing that for?”</p><p>“Just so we’re clear, the question is not ‘how’s Malfoy’s career going’, it’s ‘why am I invited to his wedding’!” Harry interrupted Hermione’s answer, a little scandalized his friends weren’t more concerned.</p><p>“I’m sure he just invited all the top Ministry people,” Ron shrugged. “For appearances, you know. I doubt he actually expects you to come.”</p><p>“I’m not a ‘top Ministry person’,” Harry protested, a little bit offended. “And if he doesn’t expect me to come, why’d he send me one? Did he honestly think I’d run crying to the press if I wasn't invited?”</p><p>“Harry is hardly some stuffy Ministry bureaucrat,” Hermione added thoughtfully, staring intently down at the table. “They’ve been at odds since they were eleven!”</p><p>Harry sighed. “I mean,” he said, shrugging, “We haven’t spoken since the trials. I knew he was at the Ministry but, surprisingly, I haven’t actually seen him.”</p><p>At this, Hermione straightened up and fixed Harry with her intense and slightly inebriated stare.</p><p>“How is that possible?” she asked, her eyebrows coming together slightly. “You see me at <em>least</em> three times a week. Magical Law and the Aurors interact constantly!”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re always telling us what we can’t do,” Harry mumbled, but Hermione chose to ignore this in favor of more investigation.</p><p>“Maybe he’s much more low-ranking than I thought,” she said, the wine allowing her voice to be coated with a hint of smugness, something she was usually adept at erasing when discussing work.</p><p>“Maybe he has a big apology right and ready for you,” Ron suggested, grinning over the top of his glass and raising it in a mock-toast.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dear Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s a bit hard to explain, but I need you to pretend to be my friend.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At least until my wedding. Then you can do whatever you want. You never have to see me again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I apologize for the abrupt and confusing nature of this letter, but I am horribly pressed for time and am writing this with the utmost haste.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I will be seeing you during your lunch break in the cafeteria on Monday.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Until our conversation, please employ whatever tools of discretion you may have at your disposal.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Many thanks,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy.</em>
</p><p>Harry read and re-read the note he had found waiting for him via owl the next morning, even more astounded and further puzzled by the whole weekend. Neither Ron nor Hermione had been able to solve the mystery of the invitation, and Ginny had been even less help. He had fire-called her and she had laughed herself silly for the better part of an hour before leaving for Quidditch practice.</p><p>“Who’s he marrying?” she had demanded first off, her face the picture of anticipation.</p><p>“Uh, Pansy Parkinson,” Harry had replied, unsure of why it mattered.</p><p>“OH, that is too <em>good</em>!” she had cried, falling straight onto her back and dissolving again into giggles without explanation.</p><p>Well, Harry thought, looking at the letter again, it wasn’t the big and weepy apology Ron had told him to expect, but technically, he <em>did</em> apologize.</p><p>”<em>I apologize for the abrupt and confusing nature of this letter,</em>” Harry mouthed the words before laughing and setting the note aside. He and Malfoy had not spoken since Harry, Ron and Hermione had spoken at his trial seven years ago and he had disappeared to Paris with his parents to work on regaining access into high Wizarding society, or so they had all theorized.</p><p>Even if Harry had wanted to reach out to him, and he had thought about it, he had no idea how to go about doing it.</p><p>But as Malfoy seemed intent on proving, you definitely didn’t need much of an introduction.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear that Malfoy is marrying Parkinson?” Seamus asked the next morning, hardly looking up from his newspaper as Harry plopped down into his seat across from him.</p><p>Harry froze. “How do you know? Did you get an invite?”</p><p>Seamus looked at him strangely. “No,” he said slowly, “it’s in the <em>Prophet</em>. Not front page, of course, but I’d thought you’d have seen it.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry recovered, pushing up the sleeves up his robe. “I hadn’t.”</p><p>“Don’t look forward to those children,” Seamus shuddered, folding the <em>Prophet</em> and setting it aside.</p><p>Harry’s stomach churned even worse than it had when he was talking to Ron and Hermione, and he frowned, wanting Seamus to stop talking.</p><p>“I guess it’s lucky they were so fond of each other back at school,” Seamus went on, absently rolling a pen around on his desk. “Some of those arranged marriages can be a nightmare.”</p><p>Harry’s head snapped up to Seamus. “Arranged marriage?”</p><p>Seamus shrugged. “Well, I have no idea whether or not him and Parkinson were predetermined, but it’s been in the pureblood fashion to arrange marriages at birth for thousands of years. Granted, the tradition just keeps dying out with time, but it does still happen.”</p><p>“It does?” Harry asked, unsure of why he was so interested in this idea.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. I mean, it’s even less common now since the War, but it always makes a resurgence when some of the political controversy has died down.” Seamus replied.</p><p>“Has it?” Harry asked darkly, looking over some of the case files piled on the corner of his desk.</p><p>Seamus snorted. “Doesn’t seem like it.”</p><p> </p><p>And then, before anyone was ready for it, Harry found himself walking to the cafeteria.</p><p>The night before he had lost sleep deciding on whether or not to take lunch in the cafeteria or in the Auror department, or perhaps outside of the Ministry all together. Eventually, the blatant curiosity and his basic integrity led him to take his lunch break as he usually did: in the cafeteria with Seamus and whoever else wanted to join them.</p><p>Today, that someone else would be Draco Malfoy.</p><p>And Harry couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>“Mate, what’s wrong with you today?” Seamus asked, side-eyeing him suspiciously as they stood in line for mashed potatoes. He pushed his tray into Harry’s to make him move faster down the line, making Harry remember his presence.</p><p>“Er,” Harry said, eyes skating over the bland food options, “Just expecting some interesting company.”</p><p>“A case?” Seamus asked excitedly, his eyebrows raising. “It better be a case, I’ve been <em>so bored</em> for ages.”</p><p>Harry snorted and grabbed a milk carton, sliding his tray towards him. “Maybe.”</p><p>“What’s the crime?”</p><p>“Well, there’s no crime yet,” Harry laughed, enjoying seeing Seamus’s face fall.</p><p>“If there’s no crime, there’s no case! Don’t say there’s a case!”</p><p>“I didn’t say there’s a case, I said there <em>might</em> be a case—“</p><p>“How <em>might there be a case</em>, then?”</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>The grin on Harry’s face dropped immediately as that name, <em>his</em> own name in that cool voice, shivered down his body.</p><p>“Bloody hell…<em>Malfoy?”</em></p><p>Neither Harry nor Malfoy even looked Seamus’s way as Harry set down his tray on a nearby table and fixed his expression into a neutral and slightly guarded but still cordial one, turning smoothly around and looking at Draco Malfoy for the first time in seven years.</p><p>He hadn’t grown.</p><p>“You haven’t grown,” Harry remarked stupidly, before sighing and shaking his head. <em>Great </em>start.</p><p>“I…what?” Malfoy stuttered, looking startled.</p><p>But he <em>did </em>look older.</p><p>“Harry, what the <em>hell</em> is happening?” Seamus demanded.</p><p>“Seamus, can you sit…down? Just, er—I’ll be there in a second. Okay?” Harry just short of pleaded, nodding his head at the empty table they were headed to.</p><p>“Actually, I was going to take you somewhere. For lunch.” Malfoy said quietly, his chin jerking up a bit but nervousness creeping into his tone.</p><p>“Like a lunch date?” Seamus crowed, narrowing his eyes at Malfoy, who seemed to actually lean away from him.</p><p>“I have my lunch here,” Harry said coolly, feeling like he should defend the pitiful lunch he had acquired with Seamus.</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes flickered down to it once before coming to meet Harry’s.</p><p>“I can get you better lunch,” he offered flatly, folding his hands behind his back.</p><p>Harry pursed his lips, considering his options. On one hand, he could tell Malfoy to fuck off and stop communicating with him, but he couldn’t really think of a solid reason as to why that was a good idea. Malfoy had to have changed since the War and <em>certainly</em> since Hogwarts: they all had. Stirring up that animosity was something Harry instinctively recognized as a bad idea.</p><p>If Harry was honest with himself, the real reason why he wasn't about to tell Malfoy to fuck off was the curiosity burning a hole through his head. Malfoy had been one big mystery to him for seven years. He had heard little to no news stories about the Malfoys and certainly not about their son. They had caused no trouble and had it seemed the only thing that family did was eat, sleep and breathe charitable donations since Voldemort died.</p><p>So on the other hand, Harry would say yes. He would willingly go with Malfoy to lunch, and not say anything until Malfoy explained himself. Until he told him what the last seven years had done to him.</p><p>And, <em>most </em>importantly, <em>why </em>he had been invited to his wedding.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as the door closed behind Malfoy and they were alone in a small but comfortable office, Harry began to rethink his decision.</p><p>He clutched his panini tighter in his hand as he watched Malfoy cross immediately to his desk, taking out a very expensive looking glass bottle filled with some sort of amber liquid and two glasses, filling both and pushing one across the desk towards Harry without so much as looking at him.</p><p>Harry didn’t walk over to take it.</p><p>“Who have you told?” Malfoy started, after a long sip. He finally raised his gaze to meet Harry’s, but there was no negativity there, no threat. Just…apprehension. And even a sort of detachment.</p><p>Harry blinked, the beginnings of anger simmering already in his chest. “What?”</p><p>“I sent you a wedding invitation and a subsequent letter—“</p><p>“I was there, Malfoy, I know what happened—“</p><p>“Alright, then I need to know who knows what. Who did you run to, who did you joke to, which paper did you sell the story to—“</p><p>“Who do you think I am?” Harry started angrily.</p><p>“The man who still appears on the front page of the Prophet monthly,” Draco replied readily. “The boy never out of the paper during seven years at boarding school, especially fourth and fifth year—“</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me, that was <em>your fault</em>, those were <em>your lies</em>! <em>You</em> talked to Skeeter, not me!” Harry burst out, striding up to Malfoy’s desk, his chest constricting with anger.</p><p>Malfoy held up his hands in defense, shaking his head.</p><p>“Then you understand my point. Your story gets out, everything that happens to you gets out somehow. Whether it’s by you or by your arch-nemesis—“</p><p>“<em>Voldemort</em> was my arch-nemesis, don't flatter yourself.” Harry hissed, still hardly keeping from boiling over.</p><p>Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “I don’t think you know how much that hurts, Potter,” he said, placing a lazy hand over his heart. “Anyway, people know what happens to you. One way or another.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, breathing through his nose. “Why did you invite me, then?”</p><p>“Because!” Malfoy said, brightening considerably, though his energy had a definite forced feel to it, “<em>you</em>, Harry Potter, are my best friend!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>One month earlier</em>
</p><p>“And so…Pansy Parkinson,” Draco said, holding Pansy’s left hand with his right and staring into her amused eyes, “will you marry me?”</p><p>“Draco,” she cooed softly, cupping his face with her free hand, “<em>Of course</em> I will. I will devote myself to making your life as miserable as possible. Forever!”</p><p>Draco sighed and dropped her hand, stepping away from her and flinging himself onto the couch in Pansy’s sitting room. “Fantastic. Wedding’s in December.”</p><p>Pansy sighed back at him and pushed his feet off of the cushion, taking her usual spot there instead. “You’re not the only one getting a shit deal, here. A pureblood marriage involves <em>two</em> unwilling people, not just one.”</p><p>Draco groaned and turned over on his back, staring at Pansy through the hair that fell in his eyes.</p><p>“I know, Pans. You’re right. I’m sorry.”</p><p>She smiled and patted his foot, tucking her short hair behind her ear. “Do I at least have a ring?”</p><p>Draco snorted, reaching into his pocket. “Of course you have a ring.”</p><p>“Will it fit me?”</p><p>“Of course it’ll fit you.”</p><p>“Is it an emerald?”</p><p>“<em>Of course</em> it’s an emerald, Pans!”</p><p>Making a face at her friend/fiancé, Pansy took the box from Draco’s outstretched arm and opened it, sighing at what she saw inside.</p><p>Draco shifted at the sound. “You don't like it?”</p><p>“What’s not to like?” Pansy replied, her eyes still on the ring. She turned and tangled her legs in with Draco’s, settling her back against the arm rest. “It’s…it’s exquisite. It’s an heirloom.”</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrows. “But?”</p><p>“But,” Pansy continued lightly, lifting the ring from its box and sliding it smoothly onto her finger, “I do not want to wear it. And I’m not the one you want to give this to.”</p><p>“Pansy…”</p><p>“We had a deal, Draco,” she replied curtly, cutting off any protest. “You know what happens next. I get to continue my easy-going lifestyle with some wifey duties on the side and <em>you</em> get to chase the dream you only get one opportunity to chase.”</p><p>“The dream you’re<em> forcing</em> me to chase,” Draco corrected, accepting the empty box back from Pansy. “You know, they never tell you what to do with the empty ring box.”</p><p>“Easy. Keep it,” replied Pansy, holding her hand up to the light.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Pansy laughed, bringing her hand back down and looking at Draco fondly.</p><p>“In case things change.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry backed up, sure he’d heard correctly but certain he was missing something.</p><p>“Your best friend?” he clarified calmly, the churning in his stomach starting again.</p><p>“Yes. Absolutely. My favorite mate. Like a brother to me.” Malfoy said shortly, his smile dropping and the room darkening.</p><p>“You have to explain yourself,” Harry shrugged, sitting down and unwrapping his panini. “I’m not saying anything else until you do.”</p><p>“Fine,” Malfoy agreed, nodding. “Fair enough.” He looked up at Harry through his lashes, perhaps prompting him to say something.</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrows and waved his hand, motioning for Malfoy to go on.</p><p>“My marriage to Pansy was always a guarantee,” Malfoy began apprehensively, dropping his eyes again. “Ever since we were kids, we both knew we’d been set up.”</p><p>“So it <em>is</em> an arranged marriage,” Harry remarked, surprised. “Do you even love her?”</p><p>Malfoy paused, looking at him up and down. Pain flashed into his eyes for a steely second as they stared each other down, the shame Harry probably should be feeling at the intrusive nature of the question hanging between them obviously, floating in the stalemate.</p><p>“Yes,” Malfoy said finally, stiffly, and the shame seemed to rush back into Harry at this. He swallowed a bite of his panini and nodded, eye contact broken.</p><p>“Right. Sorry. Go on.”</p><p>“Well,” Malfoy said, sounding a bit ruffled, “the marriage was ready to take place any time after we turned seventeen…but then the War happened.”</p><p>Harry pursed his lips as Malfoy fell temporarily silent, automatically feeling defensive.</p><p>And there it was, out in the open.</p><p>The wound between them was open and raw, and it separated Malfoy from the rest of the world. Even though he and Harry had “made nice” at the trials, especially since he had almost single-handedly saved him and his parents from Azkaban, they were not friends.</p><p>They were not friendly.</p><p>They existed in two separate worlds.</p><p>They were, at best, officially neutral. Harry had heard no mention of Malfoy for the better part of a decade—they hadn’t even been in the same <em>country</em>.</p><p>And now, Harry watched Malfoy swallow and scratch nervously at his arm, his body drawn tighter and tighter with tension with every passing second, and somehow felt strangely farther away from Malfoy than he had ever been.</p><p>“What did the War have to do with anything?” Harry asked awkwardly, refraining from sighing in discomfort.</p><p>What <em>didn’t</em> the War have to do with?</p><p>“My family fell from social graces,” Malfoy said quietly, and Harry scoffed.</p><p>“Well, yeah.”</p><p>“You think we deserved it?” Malfoy replied sharply, turning quickly and fixing Harry with a piercing sort of stare that Harry had never seen on him before.</p><p>“Your father <em>personally </em>had a hand in trying to kill me—“</p><p>“But you spoke at—“</p><p>“<em>Malfoy</em>,” Harry interrupted, holding up a hand. “I spoke at your trial for you and your mother. <em>Not</em> for your father. You knew that.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed. “Yes, I did. Um. Thank you, again…”</p><p>“No…” Harry said, rubbing his hand through the side of his hair. “It’s…it wasn’t a…it’s fine.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Go on,” Harry prompted, resisting the urge to take his hand to feel the thick tension in the room, building with each narrowly-avoided fight.</p><p>“Well,” Malfoy began again, sounding even more hesitant to continue. He scratched his arm again. “If you’ve been…thinking about me, or my family—which, I know, isn’t very likely—“</p><p>Harry took a bigger bite out of his panini at this, focusing very hard on not spilling any pesto. “You weren’t in the paper a lot.”</p><p>“Yes, well. My family had been trying to build up a reputation again, mostly through my father in the background and…my mother and I doing charity work.”</p><p>“Noble,” Harry remarked, and Malfoy actually smiled faintly.</p><p>“I actually began to like it. I opened a small clinic in Paris—nothing big, I mainly dealt with specialty cases—“</p><p>“Wait,” Harry interrupted again, jolting up in his seat. “You’re a <em>Healer</em>?”</p><p>Malfoy blinked. “Well, not anymore—can I finish?”</p><p>Harry stared at him for a moment, trying to picture Malfoy in white robes, before nodding blankly, sitting back in his chair. “Sorry. What changed?”</p><p>Malfoy clenched his jaw and looked down, visibly swallowing. “Yeah, um.”</p><p>“Malfoy?”</p><p>“My mother died,” he said shortly, looking at Harry with a hard, fixed expression.</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, the words settling in his stomach with a feeling akin to guilt.</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy was dead. She had saved his life once. And now she was dead.</p><p>Malfoy's mother.</p><p>“Oh. God, Malfoy, I’m—“</p><p>“Not your fault,” Malfoy said curtly, stopping him completely with a shaky wave of his hand. “Cancer. It—the Muggles don’t have a solution and neither do we.”</p><p>“Shit,” Harry said, not really thinking. “That’s…really fucking horrible.”</p><p>Malfoy said nothing, just turned back around to face Harry.</p><p>“After she died,” he carried on, like nothing really had happened, “my father told me I would need to get married. It’s complicated…<em>complicated</em> social politics. We had lost a—key player—in the road to family recovery, and he realized that Pansy’s family wasn't…it wasn’t enough to bring us into the light. They’re not much better off than we are, so my father decided on Astoria Greengrass.”</p><p>“Who’s Astoria Greengrass?” Harry asked immediately.</p><p>“She was at Hogwarts with us,” Malfoy answered, plopping down in his chair and rubbing his eyes. “Year below us. Slytherin, obviously. But her family stayed neutral during the war, they were never even involved.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t she do?” Harry asked.</p><p>Malfoy smiled again, the same slight smile Harry had seen earlier. It softened his face, Harry realized, but it made him look sad.</p><p>“If I was going to marry anyone, I was going to marry Pansy,” he replied, looking distantly at a spot on his desk.</p><p>Harry’s eyebrows drew together. “I didn’t realize you two were ever so…close.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize you were monitoring my personal life,” Malfoy drawled, smirking at Harry. “But that doesn’t matter. My father agreed to let me marry Pansy because I lied to him about something.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“I told him you were my best man,” Malfoy said casually, but he picked at his nails as he avoided Harry’s stare. “Naturally, he didn’t believe me.”</p><p>“Naturally,” Harry repeated faintly, unsure of what was happening. “Sorry, you said <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“So you see my problem,” Malfoy said, rising again from his seat.</p><p>"<em>Your </em>problem."</p><p>"Yes, my problem. The only reason my marriage is even allowed to happen is because the public support that will come from <em>our</em> friendship will vastly outweigh anything people have to say about the relatively...um, <em>dark</em> match." Draco was fidgeting worse and worse with passing second he didn't get an encouraging sign from Harry. His hand was now traveling nervously up and down his left arm, and he hurriedly launched into more speech. "Obviously, this is absurd, because we've hated each other since we were eleven and even when we didn't, we didn't speak for almost ten years. So yes, my problem."</p><p>“<em>Your</em> problem? You mean the problem we are now <em>both</em> involved in, the problem you created for <em>both </em>of us,” Harry summarized, almost ready to take his panini and leave.</p><p>“Well, your <em>mission</em>, actually, should you choose to accept it—“</p><p>“Wait, that’s—“</p><p>“<em>Mission: Impossible</em>, I know, I watch Muggle films now.”</p><p>It was all too much.</p><p>Harry stood up, unable to hear another word. He grabbed his damned sandwich from Malfoy’s table and ran from the room, speeding up at the sound of Malfoy calling his name.</p><p>“POTTER! Potter, <em>please stop</em>!”</p><p>Harry turned the corner and literally plowed into a small old woman he’d never seen before, sending the panini flying and her frail form plummeting to the ground.</p><p>“SHIT!” Harry exclaimed, staggering sideways and then dropping to the floor next to the old woman, who had sat up, blinking heavily. “Merlin, ma’am, I am <em>so sorry—</em>“</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy, I have him,” she said dazedly, and Harry looked over his shoulder to see Malfoy hurtling towards the both of them, his eyes wide with worry as he too dropped to his knees beside the woman.</p><p>“Mabel! Are you okay?”</p><p>“I was just going to grab him, but he’s a lot faster than he looks,” she continued, folding a piece of hair back into place.</p><p>“What?” Harry asked, feeling more and more like he had accidentally traveled to a parallel universe where Draco Malfoy was his friend and employed grandmother bodyguards.</p><p>“Mabel, I never asked you to <em>stop</em> him,” Malfoy said, giving the woman a hand and helping her carefully to her feet.</p><p>“Well, he’s here, isn’t he? Like you wanted?”</p><p>“Yes, but I don’t sic my secretaries on people I want to talk to,” Malfoy chastised her gently, sounding like it wasn’t the first time this conversation was being had.</p><p>“We <em>did</em> talk,” Harry said, straightening his robes. “You tried to drag me into your mess of a personal life—with marriage, and…muggle films…”</p><p>“Okay, well, just come back to my office and I’ll…try again. One last chance.” Malfoy offered, smiling and nodding at Mabel to send her teetering back to her desk.</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said, though he had been planning on leaving anyway. Rolling his eyes at his own curiosity, he followed Malfoy back to his office. “Why do you have a secretary?”</p><p>“Mabel was our housekeeper until mother got sick, and then she was the nurse as well. But after mother died, my father fired her. Then I heard about my new…well, I’d hardly call this a <em>job</em>, but it has an office and with an office needs a secretary. So I found her again, living with her daughter somewhere outside Paris, and I hired her.”</p><p>“What do you need a secretary for?”</p><p>“Nothing really,” Malfoy admitted, opening the door to his closet of an office. “But I do have calls I’d rather not answer sometimes and appointments to be made and kept occasionally, so I pay her more than required to help her daughter and the rest of her family.”</p><p>“I’m inclined to not believe you,” Harry said honestly, reclaiming the chair.</p><p>“Believe whatever you like,” Malfoy said airily, striding over to his desk. Then he turned around, frowning at Harry. “Actually, I’d rather you believe me completely. I need you to like me.”</p><p>Harry laughed at that, surprising both of them.</p><p>“Well,” he said, coughing a bit, “Okay. Last chance. Tell me what I’m really doing here.”</p><p>Malfoy looked at him strangely, as if debating whether or not to say something.</p><p>“The day you testified,” Malfoy said seriously, looking at Harry earnestly. “The day we spoke to each other like normal people—relatively—for the first time, really, ever.”</p><p>“I remember,” Harry said simply.</p><p>“What were you expecting?” Malfoy asked, his eyes going wider and wider. “Were you expecting to…never see me again?”</p><p>“No,” Harry replied automatically. “I don't know. I didn’t…think like that. I didn’t even have time, you vanished the next day!”</p><p>“I know,” Malfoy said, and he actually sounded apologetic. “But if I hadn’t? What if I had stayed? Would you have talked to me again? Would you have wanted to see me?”</p><p>“I don’t…know,” Harry said slowly, looking apprehensively at Malfoy as the feeling of discomfort grew inside him, making his heart beat a bit faster. “I thought…about sending you an owl, something—but I didn’t know what to say.”</p><p>Why was he making excuses for Malfoy for his <em>lack of correspondence</em>? <em>Why</em> did he actually feel bad? He didn’t <em>want</em> to think about Malfoy’s questions.</p><p>But he was now.</p><p>“So that’s my point,” Malfoy said, just a bit breathlessly. “Neither of us know what would have happened if I had stayed. Maybe you would have seen that I wasn’t the same kid from school.”</p><p>“I know you’re not—“</p><p>“Do you?” Malfoy pressed, coming around to the front of his desk. “Do you really?”</p><p>Harry had nothing to say in response. He didn’t know what he <em>could</em> say, much less what he wanted to say. It was still all too much, too confusing, too suspicious.</p><p>“I’m asking for two things,” Malfoy said finally. “I’m asking for your help, and I’m asking for you to get to know me. Should go hand in hand, seeing as you’ll be pretending to be my…best friend.”</p><p>“If I should choose to accept it,” Harry added, and Malfoy smiled. A different smile this time—tentative but relieved.</p><p>“If you should choose to accept it.”</p><p> </p><p>“He quoted <em>Mission: Impossible</em>?” Hermione clarified incredulously, her eyes wide.</p><p>“What the hell is—“</p><p>“A muggle film,” Harry answered Ron’s bemused question quickly, and his eyebrows shot up. “Yeah, exactly.”</p><p>“What did you say? Did you say yes?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“I said maybe,” Harry answered. “I think.”</p><p>“Well, then what happened?” Ron asked, both him and Hermione leaning over the bar division in their kitchen in a way that was almost comical.</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Nothing really,” he answered truthfully. “He just told me not to mention it to anyone else. Since the public is supposed to believe we’ve been friends for a while, it wouldn’t do to have people running around—“</p><p>“—telling the truth?” Ron supplied for him, and Harry sighed.</p><p>“Well, yeah. Then he gave me a time and place for our ‘first appearance’—that’s what he called it, anyway. It’s a general meet-and-greet of the wedding party to be—pureblood tradition, apparently.”</p><p>“An old one,” Ron said, his eyebrows drawing together. “That was popular among famous pureblood families inter-marrying—when the public cared about that sort of stuff. It was…well, it was the modern-day equivalent of a photo-op.”</p><p>Harry groaned. “Fantastic. I avoid cameras like the plague for a decade and now Draco Malfoy gets to parade me around in front of them.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s really what he’s doing?” Ron asked, scowl deepening.</p><p>“I have no idea what he’s doing.”</p><p>“What’s he like?” Hermione asked quietly, tilting her head slightly and looking at Harry curiously. “I mean…does he really seem all that different?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Hermione,” Harry answered, looking down at his hands. “He asked me to get to know him. But I don’t know if that can happen, he just seems so…closed off. Like he’s not saying everything, or like…he just seems…sad.”</p><p>“His mother died, to be fair,” Hermione rationalized, and Ron nodded.</p><p>“Yeah, and he’s being forced to marry Parkinson—“</p><p>“He says he loves her,” Harry reminded him sullenly.</p><p>“—well, <em>and</em> the whole Wizarding World hates him—“</p><p>“Not <em>all</em> of it—“</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione interrupted, smiling secretively, “it sounds like you’ve already said yes.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Malfoy</em>—</p><p>
