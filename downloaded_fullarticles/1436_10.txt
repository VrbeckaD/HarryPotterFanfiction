    <p>Headache. <em>Merlin,</em> it hurt. Like knives and sledgehammers  at the same time.</p><p>The stabbing pain made it hard to think, but there was a sick,  urgent feeling in the pit of her stomach, and she knew there was something dreadfully important. Something she absolutely <em>had</em> to do.</p><p>Tonks fought to remember. She'd been looking for someone—</p><p>Remus.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix.</em>
</p><p>Her eyes snapped open and her fingers scrabbled desperately for  her wand, even as her sluggish brain was realizing that it couldn't  possibly matter anymore—Bellatrix must not still be there, or Tonks would already be dead.</p><p>She blinked a few times, waiting for her vision to clear. No fire,  no falling rocks, no panicked shouting. No <em>battle.</em> She seemed  to be in the hospital wing at Hogwarts. </p><p>And then a pale pureblood face with wide grey eyes swam into view after all, leaning right over her. </p><p>But it was the wrong sister.</p><p>Thank heavens.</p><p>"Mum?" Her voice came out as a rasping whisper.</p><p>"Nymphadora! You're awake!" Mum snatched up Tonks's hand  and held it to her cheek, and a tear or two squeezed out between her  lashes. "The fight is over, love. Harry Potter's done it.  You-Know-Who—V-<em>Voldemort</em>—is dead."</p><p>Tonks's throat was raw, probably from all the shouting she'd been  doing at the battle, and maybe from breathing too much dust and  smoke. But there were things she had to ask. "I was fighting  Bellatrix... What happened?"</p><p>"She's dead, too." Her mother's face was suddenly hard  and fierce. "Molly Weasley took her down.  She'll never threaten our family again."</p><p>Tonks shuddered, remembering the scrawny, malevolent owl that had  found her as she stood over Teddy's cot. The fact that it had  penetrated the security spells around her mother's house was ominous  enough, but the message it brought frightened her more than anything  she had ever seen. <em>That's right, hide at home with your half-breed  spawn and see if it does you any good. I will find the werewolf at  Hogwarts, and I will kill him myself. And then I will come for you,  and your brat, and your blood-traitor mother. The Black family tree  will be pruned.</em></p><p>"I wanted to kill her."</p><p>"From what I hear, you came awfully close." Mum gave a  little laugh, but halfway through, it caught in her throat and turned  into a sob. "You had her cornered, didn't you? I'm told she shot  a Killing Curse at you, but you—you tripped, and hit your head on a  piece of fallen masonry. Only, Bella thought it was her curse that  got you, so she ran off and left you lying there." Mum blinked,  hard. "Everyone thought you <em>were</em> dead, until the fighting  was over and Poppy Pomfrey found a pulse..."</p><p>So the clumsiness that was the bane of her existence had probably  saved her life. It should've been funny. But somehow, Tonks had no  mental energy to spare for humour just now.</p><p>
  <em>The Black family tree will be pruned.</em>
</p><p>She looked around wildly, half-expecting her husband to be  standing by her bed with their son in his arms, ready to start scolding  her for coming to the battle—for losing to Bellatrix <em>again</em>—for  being unconscious and worrying everyone.</p><p>But Mum was the only one there.</p><p>Tonks clutched at her mother's hand. "Where's Remus? And  Teddy? Tell me Bellatrix didn't find them!"</p><p>"Teddy's at home," said Mum quickly. "He's fine. A few friends of Harry's offered to look after him so that I could stay with you."</p><p>Her baby was safe. Tonks closed her eyes and clung, for just a  moment, to that one piece of happy news. But even so, the bottom was falling out of her world, because of the question that her mother <em>hadn't</em> answered. She looked up, straight into Mum's grey gaze,  full of sympathy overlaid with the pain of her own all too recent  loss.</p><p>"Remus is dead, isn't he," Tonks whispered.</p><p>She didn't quite know how she'd forced her own mouth to shape  those words, words that she'd never really believed—no matter how  much she'd pretended to be ready for anything in this war—never <em>really</em> believed she'd have a reason to say. Not for, oh,  another hundred years, anyway.</p><p>But her mother was shaking her head slowly, biting her lip.  "It's—it's not clear."</p>

</center><p>Lily took advantage of a quiet moment to curl up under a shady  tree and have a look at Harry through her scrying-glass. She still  couldn't quite believe how close she'd been able to get to him last  night—and he'd <em>seen</em> her. He'd <em>spoken</em> to her. The  memory alone gave her a fresh surge of joy; then she sighed, smiling  a little wistfully at his image in the glass. No matter how much she  missed her son, it was all for the best that he wasn't here yet.  Although, from what Dumbledore had said this morning, that was  something of a miracle in itself.</p><p>The scrying-glass was showing Gryffindor Tower, where Harry seemed  to have just awakened from a well-deserved nap in his old bed. Lily  watched him rub his eyes and stretch, settling his glasses on his  nose. Then he pulled a towel from a cupboard and set off for the  shower. Grinning a little, she cleared the glass to give him some  privacy and slipped it back into her pocket.</p><p>"Oi, Lily!"</p><p>Quiet moments were surprisingly hard to come by, even in the  afterlife. Lily looked up to see Sirius making a beeline for her  tree, with James right behind him.</p><p>Sirius plopped down cross-legged beside her. "You haven't  seen Moony at all, have you?"</p><p>James stooped to plant a light kiss on the top of her head and  then leaned against the tree, looming benevolently above as he waited  for her answer.</p><p>"Not for a while." She tilted her head to one side,  considering. "Not since he said he wanted to go for a walk."</p><p>"Mmm," said James, somewhat grimly. "We haven't  either."</p><p>"And it's probably not a good idea to leave him alone too  long just yet," Sirius elaborated. "He's had quite a shock,  after all." He jumped up again and held out a hand to Lily.  "Come and help us look for him?"</p><p>They each chose a direction and set off across the sunny meadow.</p><p>Lily had been a bit worried about Remus herself; death wasn't the  easiest idea to come to terms with. But so far, he seemed to be doing  surprisingly well. He was shaky and disoriented when he first turned  up, but then, most people were. He'd found his feet remarkably  quickly once Dumbledore pulled the four of them aside and started to  explain what might happen if Harry used the Resurrection Stone. Then,  in the Forbidden Forest, Remus had been nothing short of  marvellous—standing tall and proud, telling Harry not to be sorry,  that he had died for something he believed in. Even this morning,  when James offered to let Remus choose a new landscape, he had risen  to the occasion with flair, shaping the formless mist into rolling  meadows criss-crossed with low walls of white stone under a mild sun  and a gentle breeze. He really did seem to be just fine—</p><p>Lily stopped short, catching sight of a brown shape huddled  against one of the stone walls.</p><p>Maybe Remus wasn't holding up so terribly well after all.</p><p>"I've found him!" she called over her shoulder, setting  off at a run.</p><p>When Lily got closer, she could see that he was sitting with his  knees drawn up and his face buried in his folded arms, shaking. "Oh,  Remus." She dropped down into the soft fragrant grass, slipped  an arm around his shoulders, and gave him a squeeze. "I'm so, so  sorry."</p><p>James slid to a stop next to his old friend and patted him rather  awkwardly on the back. "I know it's rough, leaving people  behind. But it'll get easier with time. Believe me."</p><p>Sirius, however, came loping over and wasted no time in giving  Remus an emphatic thump on the head. "You <em>prat.</em> Haven't  you learned after all this time not to go off by yourself with your  troubles, when you've got friends who want to help? I reckon you're  even thicker than I thought you were."</p><p>That earned a shaky laugh, and then Remus straightened up slowly  and looked around at the three of them. His eyes were so full of pain  that it made Lily swallow hard, but he gave an apologetic smile and  shrugged slightly. "I'm sorry," he said, a bit hoarsely. "I  just didn't want to worry you lot."</p><p>"Well," growled Sirius, "disappearing for hours is  a bloody brilliant way to accomplish <em>that.</em>"</p><p>Remus laughed again, a little more easily this time. Then he  leaned back against the stone wall and stretched out his long legs  with a small sigh.</p><p>"You know, Moony," said James, reaching over and giving  Remus's hair a bit of a tousle, "it's only a matter of waiting.  Dora and Teddy will be here too, someday."</p><p>"You'd best get in the habit of calling her Tonks, or she'll  pummel you when she gets here," Sirius stage-whispered. "Not  even <em>I'm</em> allowed to call her Dora, and I'm <em>family.</em>"</p><p>And this actually made Remus <em>snigger.</em> Lily gave Sirius a  surreptitious pat on the back. He might have a little too much fun  pushing her buttons sometimes, but he certainly did know how to handle  Remus.</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a while, listening to the  songs of larks and thrushes that Remus's imagination had supplied  when he'd arranged the landscape.</p><p>"The birdsong is a lovely touch." Lily smiled at him.</p><p>Remus raised his eyebrows. "You can hear it over the buzzing?  I can't hear it at all."</p><p>"Buzzing?" James was the one who asked, but Lily and  Sirius exchanged puzzled looks as well.</p><p>"I thought it was just part of being...here." Remus  frowned, but Lily was pleased to see that it was merely his familiar  old frown of concentration. "I hear a buzzing sound all the  time, and sometimes there even seem to be voices, but I can't make  out what they're saying."</p><p>"I've never heard of that happening before," said James  slowly. "I'll ask some of the folks who've been here longer—see  if they know what it means."</p><p>Remus watched James for a moment. "What you said just now,  about this being easier to bear over time—does it really get  better? It must have been horrible for you and Lily, leaving Harry  behind."</p><p>"It was," said Lily. "It is. <em>Every day</em> I  wish I could be there for my son when he needs me." James  scooted closer and put an arm around her waist, and she sank  gratefully against the solid warmth of his shoulder. "But at  first it was like a searing, crushing pain—" Remus nodded  ruefully—"and now it's more like a dull ache."</p><p>"And at least you two have each other," said Remus,  almost too quietly to hear.</p><p>Sirius looked over at her, his face twisted with grief and regret.  "Lily, he's been here long enough. You ought to let him see the  glass."</p><p>She hesitated. "You know we're supposed to wait a week after  someone crosses over before we do that!"</p><p>But Remus looked lost and alone, and Sirius had his arms crossed  and his eyes half closed in that incorrigible <em>I-dare-you</em> pose  of his. Lily sighed, pulled her scrying-glass from her pocket, and  held it out toward Remus. "Here you go, then."</p><p>He looked at her curiously.</p><p>"It will show you anyone alive you ask to see. Just touch the  glass and think of the person you want to watch."</p><p>Remus took the scrying-glass in unsteady hands and whispered, "My  Dora."</p><p>The view through the glass was foggy for a moment, and then it  cleared, showing the hospital wing at Hogwarts. There was Tonks, with  a large white bandage on her head. She looked pale and strained, but  at least she was awake and alert, talking animatedly to her mother.  Remus touched her image almost reverently, running a finger along her  cheek, stroking her fine brown hair. Lily had to look away.</p><p>"She'll be all right," said Sirius quietly. "We Blacks have hard heads, you know."</p><p>Remus nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>"Let's have a look at the sprog, too, shall we?" James  kept his voice light.</p><p>Remus's eyes widened. "Good heavens. If Andromeda's at  Hogwarts, who <em>is</em> watching Teddy?" He touched the  scrying-glass again, and the scene shifted to Andromeda's small,  comfortable-looking house. Teddy was lying on a blanket on the  living-room floor, yowling. His eyes were screwed up tight, and his  tiny fists were flailing. Next to him sat Harry's friend Hermione,  frantically flipping through a very thick book, darting panicked  glances at the screaming infant. Then someone else came into  view—Frank and Alice's boy, Neville. He picked Teddy up and gave him a cuddle, and the baby immediately left off crying and  started blowing little spittle bubbles instead. His hair even turned  bright green, matching Neville's T-shirt. Hermione sat back on her  heels and gaped.</p><p>Lily suddenly realized that Remus was laughing quietly, despite  the tears in his eyes. "Poor Hermione," he chuckled. "That  had to rankle. She hates it when she can't <em>look up</em> what to  do."</p><p>They watched Teddy and the two young people for a while. Neville  really seemed to have a knack with babies, and even Hermione  eventually relaxed and began to look like she was having fun.</p><p>"Can we look in on Harry?" Lily asked. "The last  time I checked, he'd just been up in Gryffindor Tower having a bit of  a nap."</p><p>Remus handed back the glass, and Lily touched it, thinking, <em>Harry  Potter.</em> The view shifted unexpectedly back to the Hogwarts  hospital wing. Harry was sitting by a bed, talking quietly. And he  was holding the hand of none other than one Remus Lupin.</p><p>No one said anything for quite a while. Finally, Remus broke the  silence, staring fixedly at the ground. "Dammit, Harry. You need  to be out with the people who love you, celebrating the end of the  bloody war. Never mind my old corpse."</p><p>"Maybe," said Sirius tightly, "he's telling that  old corpse goodbye because he <em>cares</em> about your sorry arse."</p><p>But Lily had seen something. She tapped the glass again, shifting  the angle of the view, moving closer to the figure on the hospital  bed.</p><p>"It's not a corpse," she whispered.</p><p>Three pairs of eyes turned to her in shock and disbelief.</p><p>"Remus, you're—" She looked at him and shook her head.  "I don't understand how this is possible, but down there, you're<em> still breathing.</em>"</p>
