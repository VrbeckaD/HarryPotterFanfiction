    <p>               Harry really liked the new Defense teacher. He didn’t treat Harry like he was special because of his scar, but he did seem to like him, unlike Professor Snape. Professor Lupin even invited Harry to come to his office for tea whenever he wanted. That’s how this whole situation started. When Remus didn’t show up for class, and instead Snape took over the lesson, to teach them about werewolves of all things, Harry got worried. He went to Remus office and Remus didn’t answer the door. So Harry tried the knob. It was unlocked. He walked in looking around.<br/>
              
             “Remus? I came for tea? Are you here?” He called, walking towards the door at the back of the office that led to Remus’ actual quarters. Harry hadn’t ever been inside but he approached the door and knocked. Remus wrenched the door open and grabbed Harry, dragging him in with a growl.<br/>
 
              “I’m so sorry Harry, this isn’t going to be pretty and I’m very sorry you had to be dragged into this.” Remus’ eyes were crazed and he kept licking his lips and he was holding Harry’s arm to hard and suddenly Harry was scared of what might be happening.  </p>
<p>                “What do you mean? Remus? What is happening?” He asked, his voice quavering with fear. Remus growled and leaned in and sniffed at Harry’s neck.<br/>
           </p>
<p>             “Harry…It’s the full moon. I…I’m a werewolf. And during this time of the month I don’t have very good control of myself. And I…I’m sorry Harry but I need you. It will hurt and you will hate me, but I promise to heal you in the morning…” He pushed Harry towards his bed and threw him down. “Incarcerus!” He cried and ropes bound him all over and he was suddenly trapped. He cried out. Remus whispered a second spell and suddenly Harry was naked. “I’m sorry Harry…I’m not…I’m not myself. And soon, when the moon is finished rising…I’ll turn, and I’ll take you. But I’m going to be careful and prepare you now. So you aren’t so damaged. You’re young…and small…and ripe…” he licked his lips and eyed Harry.</p>
<p>                      The boy was bound on his knees, arms bound together in front of him and his arse in the air, His legs were free and Remus approached him and stroked a hand over Harry’s plump arse. He whispered another spell and pointed his wand at the boy’s rump. Harry jerked as a strange cold sensation swept through him and he felt liquid leaking from his hole. He was terrified, but he knew that magic was a funny thing, and Remus really couldn’t help it. So he held still and let the man rub a finger over his virgin hole. It felt…strange, and made his penis twitch. He wiggled and Remus chuckled, his laugh dark as he pressed a finger through the first layer of muscle in the boy’s hole.<br/>
                     Harry actually moaned and Remus’ cock ached. But he would wait til he shifted. But he pressed his finger in, slowly starting to stretch the boy’s hole. The boy’s reactions were delicious, and he whispered another spell to loosen the muscles more. He pressed in a second finger and Harry actually groaned and tipped his head forward, pressing back against his fingers. This was going to be amazing. He added a third finger and scissors them. Harry was nice and relaxed and suddenly he felt the pull of the moon. He growled and added a fourth finger.<br/>

                          Harry was shocked, this wasn’t something he had ever expected but he…he liked it. And when Remus started trying to add a fifth finger, the idea of having his entire hand inside him made him shiver and he pushed back against the fingers. Remus didn’t quite manage to get the fattest part of his hand inside him before he pulled out with a gasp.<br/>

                         “The shift is coming, don’t fight me Harry, I wont…I won’t bite you if you don’t fight.” He said, and then he whimpered and groaned and there was a snapping noise, Harry looked over his shoulder. He saw Remus dropping to the ground and writhing. But Harry couldn’t see him once he was on the ground. Suddenly there was a loud growl and Remus stood. Only Remus wasn’t a man anymore but a huge wolf, the size of a small horse. He looked at Harry and immediately jumped on the bed. The instincts of an animal he sniffed at Harry’s arse and licked his hole. Harry moaned and buried his head in the blanket. Remus buried his tongue deep inside Harry and ate his arse like the animal he was. Harry found himself loving it, his small cock twitching and leaking over the blankets. Suddenly Remus stopped and mounted him. Harry could feel the wet point of something jabbing against his hole for a moment until he found the hole and rammed inside. Harry cried out, barely stopping himself from trying to jerk away. Remus started thrusting into him, fucking him hard and fast. It probably only lasted a minute before his knot started swelling, the stretching of his rim and the pressure inside was enough to have Harry crying out and coming on the bedspread. Remus shoved inside deep as his knot swelled to full size, tying them together. Harry had been holding up pretty well until then, but the sudden swelling combined with the lightheadedness from his intense orgasm had him passing out. </p>
<p>                   When Harry woke up he could hear Remus weeping. He opened his eyes, and saw Remus sitting naked in a chair across the room. He had his head in his hands.</p>
<p>  “Remus? What…what’s wrong?” Harry asked sitting up, only to cry out at the sharp ache from his bum. Remus looked up quickly but only looked more upset when he saw Harry was awake.<br/>
          “Harry! Are…are you ok? I don’t…” he started crying again. Harry got himself up, trailing a sheet because Remus had banished his clothes.<br/>
  “I’m ok Remus…you told me it would hurt…it isn’t that bad.” He said, walking closer, he laid a hand on Remus’ shoulder. Remus looked up at him in surprise. </p>
<p> “I told you that? I…we spoke?” Remus said, looking confused. Harry raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p>             “Yes? I came to your rooms to have tea, and suddenly you were pulling me in here and telling me you didn’t have a choice, and you were sorry. You don’t remember?” Remus shook his head sadly. </p>
<p>                “Occasionally I black out before the moon even rises. I didn’t…I would never have believed I could do something like this. I’m…Harry you have to understand how sorry I am…and I understand if you want to tell Dumbledore. I’ll start packing my thing’s tonight.” He looked down at his hands sadly. “It’s a shame. If you knew how hard it was for a werewolf to get a job…and a good job like this…but….no…it’s better to be on the streets starving then to endanger children.” He shook his head. Harry felt a bad feeling in his chest and shook his head. </p>
<p>                  “It’s ok Remus…I wont tell anyone. I know you couldn’t help yourself. I…can you give me back my clothes now though? I would like to go get a shower.” He blushed. He could feel the crusty residue on his belly and between his legs. Remus nodded and waved his wand and Harry’s clothes appeared in front of him. He blushed but dropped the sheet to dress quickly. He swore he saw Remus eyeing him, but he dismissed it when he looked at him and the man was looking away. He stood and bit his lip. He did hurt rather badly.</p>
<p>             “Do you happen to have a pain potion I could take? Usually I would just go to the hospital wing but…I know I can’t. And it does ache.” He blushed fiercely. Remus nodded and went to rummage around in a cabinet coming out with a small green vial. </p>
<p>         “Here, take this and go get your shower. I’ll be resting most of the day and you have classes to get to still, it’s barely dawn.” Harry nodded and scampered off, drinking the potion down quickly he felt immediately better and was able to go about his day as usual. Though his mind replayed the night’s events on a loop. When it came time for DADA Harry wasn’t sure what he was expecting but instead of Remus, Snape was at the front of the room. He sneered at Harry and Harry scampered to his seat.</p>
<p>               “Continuing on from your homework yesterday, now that you know how to identify and kill a werewolf, I will teach you about the Wolfsbane Potion, and before you ask, no you will not be brewing it in class, not even seventh years attempt it. It took me nearly ten years of trial and error to prefect it. The Wolfsbane potion enables a werewolf to retain complete control of their human mind during their shift…..” He continued to speak but Harry didn’t hear any more of it, he remembered seeing Snape bringing Remus that goblet of potion, and he now knew what it had been. And he also knew that Remus had lied to him. He felt like he couldn’t breath, and his heart was beating to fast and suddenly Snape was shaking him and calling his name and he looked up at the Potions Master and all he could manage to say was. “He lied.” Before he fainted.</p>
