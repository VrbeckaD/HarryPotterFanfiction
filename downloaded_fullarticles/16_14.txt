    <p><strong>1992</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has always been like this. Most of Hogwarts didn't really know. In fact, only those involved are just the ones who knew. It started during Draco's second year. Draco spent a year slowly accepting that Potter rejected his friendship. The feeling of embarrassment and shame was gone by the time his father finished being disappointed and drowned him in underhanded statements the winter and summer holidays. There was a time he couldn't help himself and wrote down what he felt inconspicuously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was the start of it all.</p>

<p>
  <em> Hi, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>   </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> To tell you the truth, I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't even know if I'm going to send it at all and to who. I just wanted to write all my thoughts down so i can just get it over with then I can move on. Maybe it's the teenager in me? Am I being so dramatic? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>   </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> You see, my father was so disappointed in me. All my life I did everything I could just so he could not feel any disappointment at all. It seems that just one single failure had me going down a pedestal I didn't even realize I was on. That was such a wake up call, see? I was one of the top students in my year but when that particular situation reached his ears it's as if my achievements are all for naught. It hurt. Still does. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I apologize for ever burdening you with my problem, even if I do know it might make your day horrible I felt better than I had in weeks after expressing myself . </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>   </em>
</p>
<p><em> Yours,</em> <em> </em></p>
<p>
  <em> D </em>
</p>
<p>

<p> </p>
<p>Draco stared at the letter then tapped it twice while murmuring an advanced spell Severus taught him during the summer. Within seconds, the contents of his letter transferred to a blank paper with different handwriting as well, magic signature untraceable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Letting out a satisfied smile, he burned the original letter warily looking over his shoulder to his sleeping mates. It would not do well if he had a weakness other Slytherins could exploit. With a sigh, he put the letter in an envelope and nodded to himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Morning came and Draco woke up early as soon as he felt the reflected sun rays outside the lake. He winced, realizing he forgot to draw the curtains, merlin knows the grindylows like to mess around the windows. Spotting a mermaid peek curiously outside the window, Draco signed a 'good morning' to which the mermaid signed one back at him before swimming away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Learning sign language for the bored merpeople had been a past time for him during the last few months of the term in his first year. It helped there was a large mirror by the Slytherin common room. He lost count of the mistranslations he did and even had a merman point its spear at him one time, clearly offended. Feeling good he's getting better at sign language, he spotted the letter he made last night and blinked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Suppose I'd have to send it to see if anyone really gets a letter if it's unsigned." He mused, stretching and beginning to get ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An hour later, he trudged down the owlery and smoothed down the feathers of the Hogwarts owls that hooted at him irritably for disturbing their precious sleep. One particular owl hooted at him warmly when he approached. The owl automatically held up it's leg so Draco can attach the letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hi there, good friend." Draco murmurred, the owl thrilled at the greeting. "I don't know who I can send this to. Suppose you get to pick where it goes." He whispered, handing the letter that got accepted willingly. He fed the owl a few premium owl treats before smiling at it. "Terribly sorry for the inconvenience, though thank you for volunteering."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The owl hooted, nipped Draco's hand affectionately and flew off. Draco watched as it flew away and headed for breakfast.</p>
<p> </p>

  <em> October 12, 1992 </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Days went on, the Halloween passed with too much spiked pumpkin juice that reached its way in the Slytherin commons. Thankfully, Draco preferred not to drink it after he noticed it smelled a bit differently. It was a weekend, one blessedly with no classes at all and Draco was strolling peacefully on one of Hogwarts' numerous fields leading to the lake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was quite enjoying a "me-time" moment, snickering his way out teasingly at Blaise and Pansy who were drowning in their homework thus unable to accompany him. He had just sat down on a lone bench after numerous attempts of warming charms, wind caressing his cheeks just right when he hear a flapping of wings. He looked up and saw a Hogwarts owl flying towards him. He stuck out and arm and the owl landed, hooting at the letters it dropped on his lap, it nipped his fingers before flying away.</p>
<p>Letters.</p>
<p>Upon further inspection, it was untraceable with no malicious charms at all. Mail like that sometimes gets past the wards so his mother taught him that ever since second year. He took the envelope and flipped it over, eyes going wide. <em><em>"To D, somewhere out there"</em></em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh. Draco really didn't expect a reply, two at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><em>'Should I read this?</em></em>' A beat. <em><em>'No harm...'</em></em> Curiosity got him good, he noticed. He opened it with another spell Narcissa taught him and smiled at the first letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> D, </strong><br/> <br/><strong> I guess you might've been curious too if the owls deliver unsigned messages, that's great because we were going to conduct an experiment about it but you beat us to it! Quite a bloody brilliant lad you are! </strong><br/> <br/><strong> No burdens at all with your daddy dearest problem. Would like you to meet ours if you've had a chance to! Though not to compare or anything, just I think our Dad would be proud you're quite good at studying. It's not much but don't let one single failure become a hurdle to your goals! </strong><br/> <br/><strong> So here's a letter you might not be expecting! Hope we didn't scare ya! </strong><br/> <br/><strong> Xo, </strong><br/> <br/><strong> F </strong><br/> <br/><strong> P.S write back if you wanna? </strong></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Despite the sudden cold air that meant snow will fall soon, Draco felt warm as he read the first letter. He put it down and started on the second one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bloody hell, D. You scared the balls out my brother when that owl landed on top of his bed hair! I'd like to thank you though! It took a quite a while to get me to stop laughing because of it. We were distracted and all that but when your owl left, it left your letter in our care, hope you don't mind. I mind, though!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your letter was the answer to our upcoming experiment and you beat us to it! Such a brilliant mind you have, huh? Forget what your daddy dearest has to say! Just be you! That's what we do! I know it would be hard at first but don't worry, D! You can be who you are or who you want to be without your daddy dearest being mean to you! You'll feel better if you write to us more, fancy trying it out? We'll be glad to be of help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Xx,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ker</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>Rereading the letters again, with tears stinging his eyes, he couldn't help the chuckle that escaped his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Stranger, danger" he reminded himself, tucking the letters in his pocket and standing up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though the letters warmed him incredibly, the wind is turning cold too much for him to stay. And if he was speed walking up the field so he could reach Hogwarts and bask in its warmth in the Slytherin commons, well, it was getting cold outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's not as if he had a letter to write anyway.</p>
