    <p>Hermione lurked in a corner of the ballroom, largely concealed by a tall potted plant. She despised these stuffy ministry functions, and after two hours of toasts and smiling and accepting congratulations on her promotion and her war heroism and apparently every bloody thing she’d ever done, she just wanted to be left alone with her book. And for ten blissful minutes she had been.</p><p>“What reading could be so alluring as to keep <em>Junior Minister</em> Granger from the adoring throngs?” drawled a familiar and unwelcome voice. Before she could answer, a large hand with heavily bejeweled fingers reached out and plucked the small book from her grasp. She huffed in protest and looked up into cool grey eyes lit with amusement. There was no trace of the derision she expected to see, but flickering behind the mirth she saw a mix of something haunted and cautious. She found herself mesmerized by the multicolored reflections from his rings scattered through the grey, and realized belatedly that it had been rather a long moment. Her heart pounded against her ribs and she cleared her throat.</p><p>“May I have my book back please, Lucius?” She tried to keep any hint of unease out of her pleasant tone.</p><p>“Now now, Miss Granger, what have we here? A children’s tale? Can’t you read without pictures?”</p><p>Her cheeks flamed with fury more than embarrassment and she stepped forward and snatched at her battered copy of <em>The Tales of Beedle the Bard</em>. Rather than relinquish his hold, Lucius covered her hand with his so they were locked in a silent tug of war mere inches from each other. Hermione found herself suddenly very aware of his physical presence, the breadth of his shoulders, the warmth and size of his hands, the faint smell of expensive hair products. Obviously this was all ridiculous.</p><p>“An old memento, but I find the stories instructive every time I read them. Perhaps you should revisit them yourself since you clearly need as many reminders of moral behavior as you can get,” she hissed.</p><p>Lucius’ low chuckle rumbled through their clasped hands and danced in the air around her as he released the book. She staggered backwards slightly but successfully avoided catastrophe with the potted plant.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to your instruction, Miss Granger. If you find yourself seeking instruction in less ‘moral behavior,’ as you say, I’ll be taking some air on the balcony.” At the shocked look on her face he laughed, his face temporarily open and unguarded. With a positively wicked wink he turned and walked away.</p><p>Hermione stared, the book drooping limply in her hand.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Hermione moaned as warm, soft lips moved down her neck, coaxing and teasing. A whisper of kisses and tongue brushed her collarbone before her paramour recaptured her mouth with his own. She was being consumed, drowning in sensations, the weight of his body on hers making feel both protected and thrillingly overpowered. Their kisses were unhurried and deep, a tangle of tongues as she spread her legs to tangle around his waist and reached up to tangle her hands in his hair.</p><p>A low chuckle rumbled into her mouth as his kisses paused and he dislodged her fingers from his hair to hold both her hands together above her head in a grasp made even more solid by the heavy rings on his fingers. She bucked against him, driving his hard length against her core. This time it was his turn to groan, and the hand not restraining her trailed down her body, massaging her breast and sliding lower, lower, trailing warm fingertips and cool metal…</p><p>Hermione was panting and whimpering now as he teased her, his skilled fingers playing her while the head of his thick cock teased her entrance. She was vaguely aware that she thought they had been wearing clothes a moment ago and hadn’t noticed them vanish. Wandless magic? Any awareness of anything more than her current situation vanished as she felt teeth graze her neck and bite down lightly on her shoulder.</p><p>“Please, Lucius, f…” she began, cutting off into a low cry as he eased inside her. She was tight around his girth and when he was fully sheathed they spent a few moments panting at the wonder of the feeling, foreheads pressed together, gazes darkened with lust, as she adjusted to him. When she pumped tentatively against him he growled low and began to move, slow and deep, then faster as she pushed against the restraint on her hands. Her body arched with pleasure and at her very vocal encouragement he unleashed whatever he had been holding inside and began to pound into her, releasing her hands to lift her hips and cup her ass. Her pleasure built and she scrabbled for purchase on the sheets, grasping for the headboard, anything to contain her as her orgasm crashed over, toes curling and fingers tingling and his name tearing from her lips….</p><p>…and she woke, hot and flushed and shuddering from pleasure, screaming Lucius Malfoy’s name into the dark of her quiet, fully empty bedroom. </p><p>As her breathing quieted, she stared up at her ceiling and tried to collect her thoughts. “This is very bad,” seemed to be a recurring one.  </p>

  <p>It was quiet in the Ministry on Saturday mornings, but at the end of a polished hall behind a polished door labeled “Junior Minister Hermione Granger” was a hidden hive of activity. She had been there since 6am. Sitting in the middle of a plush rug, she nursed her third coffee and surveyed the wreckage around her. There hadn’t been anything for it after the night before. Not that the night before meant a damn thing, she mentally berated herself. How one bristly interaction with an arse of a man who had always been an arse and was only STILL being an arse had led to that completely delicious and altogether upsetting dream she had no idea, but there was only one remedy: organizing. She wasn’t even sure what her plan was yet, but so far it was “take inventory of absolutely everything in this office and then let the new system emerge from the rubble.” Right now she was in the rubble stage. She sighed and cast the spell at her small side table that would summon a late breakfast from the ministry cafeteria.</p>
  <p>She spread liberal amounts of butter and jam onto a thick piece of warm, seed-studded toast and closed her eyes for a moment to savor a blissful bite. It was probably good she was eating, her body was practically vibrating from the morning’s caffeine. As she opened her eyes, she heard the telltale woosh of a ministry memo arriving. She chewed thoughtfully as she watched the colorful piece of paper shimmy under her door and refold itself into a paper airplane before soaring over to her IN tray, which emitted a soft <em> ding </em> . She replaced her toast on its , unfolded herself laboriously from the floor, and retrieved the memo. She smoothed the paper flat and read a brief notice from the Department of Charitable Funds and Trusts. It notified her that the Malfoy Family Foundation had just made a considerable donation to the Muggleborn Initiation Program and that as such the head of the Foundation had been extended an invitation to Thursday’s donor appreciation tea. Hermione frowned. Since Malfoy Industries was already a major donor to the program, this could only mean that father had decided to join son. And she would have to be there, because she was the co-founder of the program. <em> Maybe Lucius won’t come </em> , she thought. It was very short notice, after all. She snorted. Of course he would be there. It was no coincidence that he suddenly appeared back on her radar after their back-and-forth at the gala last night. <em> But why? </em>Hermione crumpled up the memo and began to wipe down her empty bookshelves.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p>Lucius stared blankly at the titles in front of him in <em> Flourish and Blotts </em> as he ran his hands through his hair in exasperation. Really, what was he doing here? He didn’t even have to go to that infernal scholarship tea. Making the donation had been a foolish impulse borne of...of what? Desire? He scoffed. More like masochism and three fingers of whiskey at 1am. Another attempt to punish himself, setting his sights on the one woman even less likely to be interested in him than his estranged wife. There was no reason to suspect Hermione felt anything other than, at <em> best </em>, complete loathing for him. Regardless of the years between the end of the war and this moment, regardless of her friendship with his son, regardless how many nights he woke shouting with horror and remorse, regardless of how many charities he had founded or donated to in an attempt to make impossible amends, all she really knew of him was that he was someone who had put pride and preservation above everything — including, quite specifically, her own life.</p>
  <p>Yet, since the moment he had spotted her with her face in a book at one of the most important events of the season -- utterly surprising, utterly disarming -- all he could see when he closed his eyes were wild brown curls escaping from an updo, flashing eyes, tan skin, and the look on her face when he had dared to touch her hand, dared to tease her. It hadn’t looked disgusted. It hadn’t looked full of hatred. It had looked a little flustered and he thought, though he must now be imagining it, a little curious. Regardless, these past haunted hours were the first time in years he had been haunted by anything <em> good </em>. There was nothing for it. He had to see her again. And this time he would have a plan. He blinked and turned back to the towering bookshelves with renewed purpose.</p>
