          <div class="userstuff"><p>I know some things… </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know how to read. I know how to write.</p>
<p>I know how to do magic.</p>
<p>I know what my favourite colour is.</p>
<p>I know how to brew the most dangerous potions.</p>
<p>I know who my family and friends are.</p>
<p>I know how to evade unpleasant situations. I know how to get into them in the first place.</p>
<p>I know how to become invisible, to an extent.</p>
<p>I know how to cry. I know how to laugh.</p>
<p>I know what to do in life threatening situations, most of the time.</p>
<p>I know who I am supposed to be.</p>
<p>I know what people think of me. </p>
<p>I know every curse and jinx known to  the magic world.</p>
<p>I know every curse known to the human kind.</p>
<p>I know how to behave in social situations.</p>
<p>I know how to tell bad wine from the good one.</p>
<p>I know my priorities.</p>
<p>I know how to dress.</p>
<p>I know how to be rude.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>… I don’t know others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don’t know how muggles can live without magic. I don’t know if I could live without magic.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to cook.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do with my life.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I go to parties.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I don’t dream.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I am still alive.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to stop thinking.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to be a slob.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to give orders.</p>
<p>I don’t know how not to cry when I am angry.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I still go out of the house.</p>
<p>I don’t know what happiness looks like anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t know if my laugh is genuine.</p>
<p>I don’t know who I really am.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to maintain any new relationship.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do in my spare time.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I am not usually hungry.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to be a decent person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know I love him. I don’t know why.<br/>
I know I want him. I don’t know why.<br/>
I know he doesn’t love me. I don’t know if he hates me still.<br/>
I know I can’t have him. I don’t know if it won’t bring me to the edge some day.<br/>
I know why green is my favourite colour. I know why it angers me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think I wouldn’t know how to love him if I could. I don’t think I have it in me. The ability to love someone properly like they would deserve. Like he would deserve. Because there is something wrong with me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I love him in my own twisted way. I love him in my head. I don’t know why I do.<br/>
Because I know I hate him too. I hate him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know I love him.<br/>
I don’t know why.<br/>
I know I hate him.<br/>
I know exactly why.</p></div>
