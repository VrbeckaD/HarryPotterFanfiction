    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Hermione fixes her makeup in the mirror, doing what is necessary because nature hadn’t given her a beautiful face. Pretty, but not beautiful. Not the face of a courtesan naturally.<br/>She tilts her made-up face back and forth, admiring her work. She’s gotten quite good at makeup over the past three months. She doesn’t need the money, she has Prometheus, her artificially intelligent construct, making money for her. </p>
<p>Why Hermione does sex work is simply due to boredom and desire to dabble in something new. She likes the excitement of meeting strangers for sex and seeing how much someone will pay for a night with her.</p>
<p>“Mione, your client is here,” says Prometheus’s voice from a speaker on the desk just outside the bathroom.</p>
<p>Hermione finishes the last brush stroke, then goes to answer the door. She lives in an upscale apartment in the Australian Gold Coast. A muggle apartment. </p>
<p>The man outside the door is eccentric in appearance. He’s wearing a severe black suit. His hair is shoulder length and white blond. His eyes are like amethysts. All in all, it’s one of Hermione’s fantasies. </p>
<p>Hermione smiles. “You got dressed up for me, Tom.”</p>
<p>“I did. May I come in?”</p>
<p>She steps back and Tom steps into her and inhales.</p>
<p>Hermione thinks fast trying to remember if she’d remembered perfume, though she knows she did.</p>
<p>Tom looks at her face. “Go wash your face.”</p>
<p>She hesitates, unwilling to leave him to roam in her apartment.</p>
<p>“I’ll come with you.”</p>
<p>Hermione leads the way to the bathroom. She washes her face, a little unnerved by his intense stare. To break the ice: “You look like a Game of Thrones character.”</p>
<p>Tom smiles. “Wash that scent off of you.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to help?” murmurs Hermione and she unhooks her skimpy bra, letting it fall to the floor.</p>
<p>He weighs her breasts with his eyes, a glimmer of lust lighting them on purple fire. “Quick wash, get the scent off.”</p>
<p>Hermione showers and has to wash her hair. </p>
<p>When she comes out, Tom is naked. He has the toned body of a runner, a look they both share. She lacks the massive cock he’s pumping in his hand.</p>
<p>Hermione’s cunt throbs. She kneels before him without drying her hair.</p>
<p>Tom slaps her cheek with his cock.</p>
<p>She tries to take it in her mouth, but he steps back. “Not here?” she asks.</p>
<p>“What are your fantasies, Hermione?”</p>
<p>Hermione gives him her best smile. “You.” </p>
<p>Tom tilts his head. “Do you want to tie me up, beat me, have me tie you up, beat you?”</p>
<p>“I can tie you up,” says Hermione, utter delight tingling in her.</p>
<p>“Would that make you happy?”</p>
<p>Hermione nods. “Very happy.”</p>
<p>Tom bows. “What should I call you?”</p>
<p>“Sir,” says Hermione and she leads him to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Prometheus, confined to the computer, stays quiet as Hermione ties Tom’s wrists to the headboard.</p>
<p>“Nice computer.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s cunt is throbbing a steady beat. “Nice computer what?”</p>
<p>Tom grins. “Nice computer, Sir.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t send me a list of your fantasies,” says Hermione, fingering Tom’s length.</p>
<p>“I like biting.”</p>
<p>Hermione doesn’t think twice, she sinks her teeth into Tom’s bicep.</p>
<p>He cries out and arches his hips.</p>
<p>“Masochist?” asks Hermione, nibbling the area she bit.</p>
<p>Tom nods. “Harder and play with my cock as you do it.”</p>
<p>Hermione obliges and Tom writhes under her with a curse.</p>
<p>“Break the skin.”</p>
<p>She blinks. “Like with a bite? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Do it.”</p>
<p>“You’re awfully bossy for a man at a Sir’s mercy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do submission very well, I’m afraid. Now, Sir.”</p>
<p>Hermione viciously bites into the meat between Tom’s neck and shoulder. He jerks and moans.</p>
<p>“I’m going to suck your cock now,” says Hermione.</p>
<p>“Sit on my face.”</p>
<p>“I want to suck your cock.”</p>
<p>Tom gives her a look, so Hermione chuckles and sits on his face. He flicks his tongue over her clit, then sucks it into his mouth and nurses.</p>
<p>Hermione moans and grinds on him, certain he can take it.</p>
<p>He bites her.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Pressure builds in Hermione’s belly and she grinds harder. </p>
<p>Tom rewards her with more biting and it doesn’t take long until an orgasm ripples through Hermione’s body. She rolls off of him in a weak muddle. </p>
<p>“Lick me clean.”</p>
<p>She licks his glistening face, then starts kissing him with genuine enjoyment as she plays with his cock.</p>
<p>Tom groans into her mouth and cants his hips up.</p>
<p>“I could ride you,” says Hermione, pinching his balls.</p>
<p>He cries out. “Free me.”</p>
<p>Hermione unties him and he flips them, then pounds into her in a enthralling onslaught.</p>
<p>It’s easily the best sex Hermione’s had working as an escort and she’s sad when the hour ends. She studies him and smiles. “We could go again, no cost.”</p>
<p>Tom smiles back. “This face is that of your fantasy, correct?”</p>
<p>A flash of warning, a warning she can’t say where it comes from flashes and Hermione tries to dart off the bed to her wand, but Tom crushes her to his body as his features morph into Lord Voldemort’s.</p>
<p>She swears and tries to punch him.</p>
<p>“Ah ah ah,” says Voldemort. He captures her wrists above her head. “That was your fantasy. The Targaryen prince. You were marvelously responsive to me. I think I’ll keep the face. Here’s how it’s going to be, darling. You’re coming with me to build an artificial intelligence using the horcrux in Harry. I am going to house the intelligence in a female body because I plan to fuck it. Understood?”</p>
<p>Hermione stares into his monstrous red eyes. “Switch your face back.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s features morph back into the Targaryen prince.</p>
<p>“You can kindly fuck off and break your dick.”</p>
<p>He laughs. “I’d rather stick it in you again.”</p>
<p>Hermione struggles.</p>
<p>Voldemort groans and sinks into her.</p>
<p>She freezes and turns her face away.</p>
<p>“Ah well.” Voldemort pulls out. “I don’t like fucking unresponsive women. Might as well fuck a corpse. Let’s get going. You can pack your computer up and take it with us. I assume you can copy a base level of code from Prometheus to make Riddle.”</p>
<p>“Will you let me see Harry?” asks Hermione, her heart pounding with fear.</p>
<p>“Yes. Pack up the computer.”</p>
<p>Hermione gets up and starts packing the computer with shaking hands, frequently glancing over at Voldemort. Prometheus doesn’t speak, likely busy analyzing the situation.</p>
<p>He smiles. </p>
<p>“Stop looking at me.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s smile widens. “I’m afraid I can’t look away. You are a bewitching woman. I tried very hard to capture you in the time you were still trying to rescue Harry. Tell me, why’d you stop?”</p>
<p>“There was no point. You killed everyone that was helping me. It became a suicide mission.”</p>
<p>“But Harry was your love.”</p>
<p>“There was also the reports that you were torturing him because people were trying to rescue him.”</p>
<p>Voldemort nods. “I would never torture Harry, not when he’s so compliant. Or he is now. Then he was a little wild, but I still didn’t torture him. I enjoy Harry.”</p>
<p>Hermione slips the little box knife on the desk into her hand and walks back to Voldemort.<br/>He raises an eyebrow. “Done?”</p>
<p>She straddles his lap, loathing the feel of him. “Let me go and I’ll give you the best sex of your life.” </p>
<p>Voldemort plays with her full breast. “No.”</p>
<p>Hermione tries to stab him in the neck, but Voldemort catches her wrist and crashes their lips together. His grip on her breast becomes painful. She relaxes her body and doesn’t respond.</p>
<p>Voldemort shoves her from his lap. “Finish the computer.”</p>
<p>Hermione falls hard on the floor and her lower lip trembles.</p>
<p>“Are you gonna cry, Hermione Granger?”</p>
<p>She rises and attacks him, trying to get the box knife.</p>
<p>Voldemort gropes her and whines as she rubs accidentally against his cock. Hermione snarls and grabs the box knife, trying with both hands to pry it from his fingers. He flips them and ruts against her, sending traitorous heat through Hermione’s body. She sinks her teeth into his wrist as hard as she can. </p>
<p>“Ah, fuck,” groans Voldemort. “More!”</p>
<p>Hermione bites his fingers and keeps biting as Voldemort penetrates her. She starts crying, but she keeps fighting. Finally, she spits in his face and snarls.</p>
<p>Voldemort pumps away inside her.</p>
<p>Something in Hermione breaks and she goes limp.</p>
<p>He curses and pulls out, quickly satisfying himself with a hand. He smears his cum on her breasts. “Pack the computer.”</p>
<p>Hermione summons up courage and slaps him.</p>
<p>Voldemort slaps her back, harder.</p>
<p>Tears well up in her eyes and she turns her face away.</p>
<p>He chuckles. “Isn’t this your fantasy? For a Targaryen to abuse you? You were quite vivid in your perversion. Must have taken courage to post it online.”</p>
<p>Hermione shakes herself. She runs an analysis and decides she needs to play it cool. She takes a breath in. “Prometheus is simple. She’s not conscious, she’s a collection of code. I’m not a good enough programmer to make a conscious program.”</p>
<p>“That’s what the horcrux is for, dear. It will animate the code.” Voldemort rises. “Finish the computer.”</p>
<p>“I can transfer the base code to your computer. I don’t have to come with.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s face turns patient. “I need you to help me match up the engineering of the brain and body to the base code. It’s a complex task and will take us working in unison for some time. I’m also unwilling to let that body leave my control.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s lip curls back. “Fuck you.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you back,” says Voldemort. “Now pack the fucking computer.”</p>
<p>“You fucking pack it!”</p>
<p>Voldemort smiles and waves his wand. Foam appears all around the computer. “There. Put on a sports bra and spandex.”</p>
<p>Hermione stares. “What?”</p>
<p>“Sports bra and spandex. No padding. Now.”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>
<p>Voldemort snaps his fingers. “What part of ‘now’ are you not comprehending?”</p>
<p>Hermione hurries to dress in a neon pink sports bra with short black spandex.</p>
<p>“Longer spandex. You’ll get chafing.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to have me to?” asks Hermione in amazement.</p>
<p>“We’re going for a run. Chop chop.”</p>
<p>Hermione puts on longer spandex and stands still for his inspection with a feeling of bizarre disbelief.</p>
<p>Voldemort walks around her. “Go put that riot of hair in a ponytail.”</p>
<p>“At once,” Hermione murmurs and tries to leave the room.</p>
<p>He tisks. “Mirror and hairbrush right over there, sweetie.”</p>
<p>Hermione glares at him and sweeps her hair up into a ponytail.</p>
<p>“Do it over. Make it pretty.”</p>
<p>Hermione fixes her hair and keeps glaring at Voldemort in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Voldemort holds out his hand, his wand in his other.</p>
<p>She thinks fast. “Let’s go for a run here. Do you run often in Australia?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Hermione blinks. </p>
<p>Voldemort crooks his finger at her. “If I have to come get you, you’re going to get a spanking.”</p>
<p>“Um…” Hermione edges towards the door.</p>
<p>He advances.</p>
<p>She sprints through the house only for Voldemort to catch her at the front door. He gives her an aggressive kiss, then drags her to the living room where he beats her ass. Hermione can feel his erection and it’s making her feel horrifying arousal.</p>
<p>Voldemort starts caressing her ass. “I want to pound into this. How often do you let men play with your ass?”</p>
<p>“None of your fucking business!” Hermione knows it’s a mistake, but she starts wildly struggling.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Voldemort gasps and he shoves her down onto the floor.</p>
<p>Hermione twists around and grabs Voldemort’s balls.</p>
<p>The lust on his face is all-encompassing.</p>
<p>“I will crush these in my hands,” says Hermione and she squeezes.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he groans. </p>
<p>Hermione hesitates. “You’re bluffing.”</p>
<p>Voldemort’s eyes are heavy-lidded. “Do it.”</p>
<p>She crushes them and Voldemort falls on her, wildly kissing. He thrusts a hand down her spandex and starts fingering her, sending bolts of arousal through Hermione’s body. She wants none of it and she goes limp.</p>
<p>Voldemort sits back and satisfies himself. “Hmm. Shall we try this again?”</p>
<p>“Fuck you to fucking hell you fucking monster!”</p>
<p>“Come on.” Voldemort apparates Hermione and himself back to the computer, then to one side of a valley in the mountains. On the other side she can see a vast black castle. A dense forest of evergreens lays before them.</p>
<p>Hermione notices that Voldemort now has running clothes on. She rubs her eyes. “I’ll give you another blowjob, just let me go home.”</p>
<p>“This is home now, darling.” Voldemort flicks his wand at the computer and it hovers into the air. “Come now, time to run.” He takes off jogging.</p>
<p>Hermione runs the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Voldemort catches up with her as she surveys a sheer drop. He says “The place I apparated us to is the only point of that mode of travel in the entire valley and the surrounding mountains. We have to travel by foot to the castle. I have thestrals for my lazier subjects, but we will run.”</p>
<p>And so Hermione runs after Voldemort at breakneck speed. She’s in danger of collapsing by the time they come to the castle.</p>
<p>“Well done, dear,” says Voldemort and he cups her face in his hands.</p>
<p>Hermione growls. </p>
<p>Voldemort starts licking the sweat from her face.</p>
<p>“Stop it!” She struggles, which ends in them spilling on the ground. She knows where this is going, so she goes limp.</p>
<p>Voldemort slowly licks the sweat off her face. “That is lovely, darling. Thank you.” He rises and slings her over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Put me down!” Hermione tries to throw herself off of his shoulder.</p>
<p>He spanks her ass hard. “We’re attracting a crowd, dear, do try to behave.”</p>
<p>“Master has good taste,” says a Death Eater.</p>
<p>Voldemort chuckles. “Yes, I suppose I do.” He strides off, walking with her all the way to his private rooms, which are up at the very top of the castle, some seven stories up.</p>
<p>Hermione is still fighting by the time he slings her down on a couch. “I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!”</p>
<p>“Master?” asks a familiar voice, Harry coming into view. “New body.”</p>
<p>“Hello, dear. I brought you Hermione.”</p>
<p>Hermione scans Harry with her eyes. He looks fine. Good, with toned arms and a tan.<br/>Harry dashes over and skids to a halt by the chair. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“She hurt me,” says Voldemort, showing Harry the bite marks on his wrist and fingers.</p>
<p>Hermione sits up. “I-”</p>
<p>“Out, Harry. She needs to be trained. You will not speak to her or attempt to communicate. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>A spark of defiance lights Harry’s eye, but he only nods. “Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>“I’m not calling you Master,” says Hermione flatly.</p>
<p>Voldemort raises an eyebrow. “What do you want to call me?”</p>
<p>“Bitch.”</p>
<p>Harry coughs to cover a laugh.</p>
<p>“You can’t call me bitch, darling. Master will do. Say it with me. Master.”</p>
<p>“Cocksucker.”</p>
<p>Voldemort sighs. “Master.”</p>
<p>“Flaming cunt.”</p>
<p>“Master.”</p>
<p>“Douchebag.”</p>
<p>Voldemort hums. “Agree to call me Master and I’ll let you bathe unassisted.”</p>
<p>Hermione narrows her eyes. “King Bitch.”</p>
<p>Harry groans.</p>
<p>Voldemort picks her up again and carries her fighting form to the bathroom. He holds her by the hair while he fills the bath, then he expertly peels her bra and shorts off of her. The bathwater sloshes as he gets in with her. His hands are wandering and Hermione knows he’s getting off on this, but she keeps struggling because she can’t bear to not.</p>
<p>“Now now, darling. It’s bath time, not time to seduce your Master into sex.”</p>
<p>Hermione succeeds in half throwing herself out of the bath, but Voldemort hauls her back in. He grabs a sponge and starts scrubbing.</p>
<p>She howls and screams.</p>
<p>Harry comes in.</p>
<p>Voldemort stills. “What did I say, Harry?”</p>
<p>Hermione keeps fighting and Voldemort effortlessly pins her body down.</p>
<p>“Mione, stop fighting. Be as submissive as possible and he won’t rape you or have much interest in you.”</p>
<p>“That is quite enough, Harry. Leave.”</p>
<p>Harry stays put.</p>
<p>Voldemort rises and forces Hermione to bend over. “Leave, Harry, unless you’d like to watch.”</p>
<p>“You flaming bastard! Stop!”</p>
<p>Hermione screams and cries as Voldemort pushes into her.</p>
<p>Harry holds up a knife. “Get the fuck out of her.”</p>
<p>Voldemort starts lazily thrusting. “She’s my cunt, Harry. I don’t want to share so soon.”</p>
<p>Hermione stops fighting and lets her knees buckle so Voldemort has to hold her up.<br/>“Darling,” he croons. “Darling. Liven up.”</p>
<p>Harry attacks Voldemort with the knife. They fall to the ground wrestling. Harry snarls.<br/>Hermione rises from the bathtub, shaking. She tries to flee through the door, but it swings shut and locks, so she joins in and tries to shove her thumbs through Voldemort’s eye sockets.<br/>Voldemort has the knife and he pins her, holding the blade to her neck.</p>
<p>“BASTARD!” Harry launches himself at Voldemort, who waves a hand. Harry flies backwards.<br/>Hermione swallows, never being more terrified.</p>
<p>“Darling, call me Master. Call me Master and I’ll show you your room.”</p>
<p>“My room?” asks Hermione, her voice trembling.</p>
<p>Voldemort nods. “It’s below my room. It has a nice view of the mountains.”</p>
<p>“And you will leave me alone?”</p>
<p>“No, but I’ll put on clothes and I won’t assault you unless you initiate another wrestling match. Really, it’s up to you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you… Master.”</p>
<p>Voldemort smiles. “There we go.”</p>
<p>Hermione is shepherded to tower room where Voldemort sets up the computer. He explains that the computer will work off castle’s ambient magic. She barely hears him, her mind is falling into a numb state.</p>
<p>Voldemort slams his hand on the desk, making her start. “Are you listening?”</p>
<p>“I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hurt you, dear. Unless you’re stupid. But you’re not stupid, are you?”</p>
<p>“I can build you the AI and then you’ll let me go, right?”</p>
<p>Voldemort shrugs. “Sure.”</p>
<p>Hermione eyes him. “You’re lying. You’ll kill me.”</p>
<p>“No, dear. I’m not going to kill you.” Voldemort yawns. “Let’s hurry this up. Review the base code you have for Prometheus, review your notes. I’ll give you my notes on the body and computer to house Riddle. Dear God I’m tired. Notes later.” Voldemort kisses her forehead, then heads up the stairs.</p>
<p>Hermione’s frozen for an instant, then she tears through the rooms to the exit, only to find it locked. She screams and screams in horror and desperation.</p>
<p>Harry comes over. He doesn’t speak, but his presence is comforting.</p>
<p>Slowly, Hermione calms down. She’s been kidnapped by Voldemort, but Harry is here.</p>
