  <em> October 16th, 1998 </em>
</p>
<p>It’s hard to identify when and in what order things occurred in my life. I think I have most of the memories, but it’s like somebody dumped all of them into a bowl and whisked vigorously before pouring them back into my head. I only have bits and pieces connected so far, a giant puzzle of my own life, but none of the sides seem to match anymore. Sometimes I question if I contain other people’s puzzles in my brain—it would explain why I can’t understand who I am…was.</p>
<p>I should probably be more concerned about the state of my mind than I am right now. It’s hard to be concerned about anything here though. I’m not sure where here is either…or how I got here…or when I came. It doesn’t really matter though. I like it here. I figure, with more time here I might begin to piece together some of the answers to my questions. All the same, if I can’t find answers, I don’t think I’d mind.</p>
<p>Guard talks to me. I haven’t really seen anyone else, but he speaks as if I will be meeting someone important soon. He never mentions names though. I’m vaguely aware of the fact that names should be important, but here everyone is referred to by what they do. Guard guards me. I don’t do anything yet, so he doesn’t really call me anything. He says he thinks I might get a title at some point in the near future. I wonder what my name used to be. I try to ask Guard his real name, or about what’s outside of this place, or if he used to exist in the world the same way that I think I did, but then he leaves my room and I no longer have anyone to talk to. I’ve mostly stopped bringing up stuff like that, I like talking to Guard.</p>
<p>Talking to Guard is one of the few things I do in this place. I have a decent sized room with a sinfully comfortable bed, a small table and bookshelves on the wall. Most of the books are written in languages I’ve never seen and cannot begin to comprehend. Yet, when I hold certain books, I get flashes of what I think are memories. Did I used to know these words? A few of the books I can read, but they are about things I don’t really understand at all. I still find myself reading them, because I have little else to do and they might be the only thing that brings me the answers I seek. Beyond the books, the room is basically barren, sterile. I’ve come to realize that the room is a scary metaphor of my life currently—filled with so much knowledge, but no understanding. Oh well, everything that goes through my brain gives me a headache most days, and I waste the days away by napping. I’ve adapted a routine of talking to Guard over meals, reading in between breakfast and lunch, and napping between lunch and dinner. I think I’d like to begin doing something more soon.</p>
<p>Today, Guard tells me I need to look nice and to watch my tongue. I don’t think I enjoy being told what to do, but he says it so desperately I wonder if there’s something I should be afraid of about this place. Nothing bad seems to happen here. Nothing at all seems to happen here. It’s nice, I’ve enjoyed it since I’ve been here. However, I feel the seed of restlessness beginning in the pit of my stomach. I begin to yearn for something more.</p>
<p>Guard exits my room after I finish breakfast and I go to search through the books for something I might be able to understand. Today a book near the bottom of one of the shelves catches my eye. It’s very plain and I don’t know why I am drawn to it, it’s a simple black leather-bound book with one barely noticeable rune etched into the spine. I pull it from the shelf and look at the cover; there is no title, but that same rune is etched onto the front as well. It feels warm in my hands and I can innately tell that there is something powerful about this book.</p>
<p>I open the cover and all that’s inside are blank pages. I flip through to see if there is anything written in here at all, but I am met with pristine, unblemished pages. I hold the book in my hands and one of my fingers absentmindedly traces the rune on the cover and the book grows warmer in my hands. Too warm. Hot. Searing.</p>
<p>“Hello, my daughter. It must finally be time.”</p>
<p>I heard a woman speaking, but the pain of holding the book was all I could focus on. I couldn’t seem to drop it, no matter how badly I wanted to. The voice seemed to reverberate in the room, it was more than an echo though…it was everywhere, but nowhere. The pain had spread to everywhere too. There was too much happening, I think I had collapsed onto the floor at some point.</p>
<p>“Help, please,” I managed to gasp out into the room. I wasn’t sure if I was hallucinating the voice or not, but even if I was maybe Guard would hear me.</p>
<p>“Oh, my lost daughter. I shall do so much more than help. All of the pain, all of the questions, all of that confusion, all that and more will be cleared up. You will have a greater understanding than you can dream of. I only ask one thing of you, faith my daughter. You must have faith—in me and in yourself.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” the more I listened to the voice, the less present I felt. I felt myself watching the scene unfold from somewhere outside of my body, the pain staying behind as well.</p>
<p>“Hm. That is a hard question to answer. Most just call me The Lady. You are born of me, in a manner of speaking. However, before I give you fuller answers, you must have faith. Do you have faith, dear child?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you are asking me to have faith in. I don’t know anything right now.”</p>
<p>“Faith does not require you to know, only to feel.”</p>
<p>The way this woman…or entity…spoke was odd, yes, but oddly comforting. I found myself pushing my confusion out of my head and trying to feel. I had stopped feeling the pain from holding the book, but I was still shrouded in warmth from it. It felt like holding a cup of hot tea, or reading my favorite book, finally completing something challenging, or sleeping in with nowhere to rush off to.</p>
<p>“I feel it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes, my child, I knew you would. I have waited for you for so long. You are home, my Valkyrie.”</p>

  <em>October 16th, 2002</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione was smart enough to know that she should consider herself lucky, in fact, that’s probably what saved her, her intelligence.</p>
<p>The war had been over for four and a half years, but it felt like a lifetime ago. She’d spent nearly a whole year with Harry and Ron acting like superheroes, when really, they were just kids who’d never been told no, led by adults who let them finish battles they didn’t started. They never dreamed they could lose. They never imagined what life would be like if they lost. Or even what it would be like if they won.</p>
<p>That’s not entirely true. Hermione had thought about it every night as they slept in that tent, she just never shared her fears with Harry or Ron. Harry though that this was his battle and it didn’t affect anyone else, but he at least was born by magical blood. Ron was a pureblood, he never had to worry. Hermione, however, had too much to worry about. Still, for all her worrying, she never thought she’d end up here.</p>
<p>After Harry was defeated, she served a stint in Azkaban. She was in there for a year, before she was released and became what she is now—part spy, part slave, all traitor. It happened in the dead of night, she was released on the one year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. Of all the people that could have come for her, Bellatrix Black, her torturer, showed up in her doorway. Hermione thought it was finally her time to die, never did she dream that it could be time for her to live and thrive again.</p>
<p>Now, here she was, Bellatrix’s secret informant. The public had been told she died in Azkaban from Dragonpox—nobody believed this of course, they thought she was killed to prove a point—nobody actually knew that she was alive except for Bellatrix, the unlucky few who ever saw her met a quick end. Voldemort suspected that she did not die, but could not confirm the truth. In the grand scheme of things, he cared very little for one missing or maybe dead Mudblood; he had far more crucial things to attend to while trying to run the Wizarding World. What he did care about what his missing Lieutenant, but she had been gone for three years and subtlety was not in her nature, so he had come to accept the fact that she was likely dead.  </p>
<p>Working together had been the oddest three years of Hermione’s life; at first she was terrified she was going to get tortured again, then Bellatrix and her had grown into a stilted camaraderie, now they were basically each other’s whole lives. Hermione knew that there was still something Bellatrix kept hidden, she never gave a full explanation on why she left Voldemort’s side and was actively plotting against him now. The best answer she got was that the Dark Lord lost sight of the ideals he claimed to fight for. But when pressed on how that led to Bella using Hermione as a spy, the answers shut down. It didn’t matter really, Bellatrix was different now and that was good enough for Hermione.</p>
<p>The last few weeks had been quiet, no major tasks to do, but Hermione felt a shift in the air. Something big was going to happen soon. Bellatrix had disappeared for a few days on some assignment, which was standard. But, this time when she left, she didn’t look dressed for battle, but dressed rather impressively regal.</p>
<p>Hermione was beginning to grow restless, pacing around the small unplottable, ever-changing location cabin. Her thoughts always drifted back to Bellatrix and how she had looked when she left three days ago. Was she actually on assignment or was she meeting somebody special? They weren’t supposed to have contact with anyone besides each other. As Hermione’s thoughts kept spiralling, she came to a horrible realization. She was jealous. But what exactly was she jealous of? Maybe it was just that she got to do something, while Hermione was going stir crazy. Or the fact that Bellatrix possibly had other people in her life, while Hermione had nobody else. It could be that Bellatrix had somebody to dress up for, while Hermione had nobody to do that for since her incredibly brief moment with Ron all those years ago. Dear Merlin, no, it couldn’t be that she wanted Bellatrix to dress that way for her—</p>
<p>Hermione was jolted out of her thoughts when she heard the door slam and a frantic, “Hermione?” was heard from the hallway.</p>
<p>“Bellatrix, how was the assignment?”</p>
<p>“Listen we don’t have much time to talk, but I need you to change and come with me, hurry!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing? Where are we going?” Hermione was becoming more frantic as she looked at Bella’s ashen face.</p>
<p>“I swear, you’ll have all the answers to all the questions you’ve been asking me for the past few years. But, I cannot be the one to give them to you. We have to meet The Lady and you must look respectable. Hermione, <em> please</em>, trust me.” Bellatrix pleading, that never happens, whatever was going on must be pretty serious.  </p>
<p>“Who’s The Lady—nevermind, it does matter because I do. I do trust you, Bella.”</p>
<p>Hermione dressed quickly in her nicest robes, which seemed lacking compared to Bellatrix’s ethereally beautiful, yet darkly alluring robes. She realized she had been staring at Bellatrix for too long, but when she finally met her eyes, she saw Bella looking at her in the same manner, with her slightly lidded eyes, dark and captivating.</p>
<p>“You...er...look great Hermione. I’m going to take you to The Lady now. It might hurt, or at least it did my first time, but it will pass.” Bellatrix held out a simple book with a rune on the cover, “trace the rune with your wand hand and hold on to me with your other.”</p>
<p>Hermione clung tightly to Bellatrix’s hand, comforted by her touch, the touch that had started stroking the back of Hermione’s hand with her thumb. She drew strength from this peaceful moment between them, after her afternoon of increasingly nerve-wracking thoughts about the older witch. Hermione began to trace the rune and a light erupted from it, growing in intensity and becoming all colors as it surrounded the pair of witches. </p>
<p>Hermione heard a soft, “oh,” from beside her, letting her know that Bella was just as entranced by what was happening. As the light became too bright to look at, Hermione squinted her eyes and felt the familiar tug of a portkey behind her navel.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Welcome home, my children,” a resonant voice spoke to them as soon as their feet touched the ground.</p>
<p>“Hermione, this is The Lady,” Bellatrix spoke to Hermione, giving her hand a soft and reassuring squeeze.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to meet you,” Hermione said as she curtseyed to the beautiful woman standing before them. She was taller than most humans, with long auburn hair that glittered as if spun from rubies and gold.</p>
<p>“I have heard much about you from my first Valkyrie, I am pleased to finally meet you,” The Lady’s voice was melodic and soothed Hermione’s nerves, even as her confusion grew.</p>
<p>“Valkyrie?” Hermione squeaked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Bellatrix, as you call her, is my first Valkyrie, my <em> Kunna </em>. The gods have been displeased with how things have been on Earth recently and we have all felt it necessary to intervene to bring a peace to these lands again. You have weak men seeking to become gods and ruining all the good that stands in their way. No one plays god better than a goddess. But, I have many other things to do, so I have recreated my legendary Valkyrie to stop the evil permeating here on Earth.”</p>
<p>“This is er...a lot to take in. So these past few years, I haven’t even been working with Bellatrix. I was broken out of Azkaban by Valkyrie...er...<em> Kunna </em>,” Hermione was growing frantic, drawing her hand away from Bellatrix. </p>
<p>“Hermione, no, it’s not like that. It’s complicated—” The Lady held her hand up to stop Bellatrix.</p>
<p>“She is all of those things, dearest one. She is still Bellatrix, but I have gifted her the power of a Valkyrie, specifically <em> Kunna’s </em> powers. You have not been deceived, there was just some truth omitted. But today we are going to explain everything. You will have knowledge beyond your wildest dreams, my lion.”</p>
<p>Hermione, ever the scholar, was instantly ready to hear anything The Lady had to say. “Okay. I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“You have been told to call me The Lady, a common title, but who I really am is Freyja, goddess of war, magic, sexuality and wealth. To be gifted the title of Valkyrie, one must also embody those things, for all are important traits to do what I ask of them,” Hermione couldn’t help but think that there was not a better person than Bellatrix to exemplify such things, “Valkyrie are the Chooser of the Slain, they can decide who dies in battle and of those who die, who will return to Valhalla as a hero and those who will not be permitted into Valhalla. Bellatrix has been bestowed upon her the power to feel, or <em> Kunna </em>. She is able to feel her targets; she can access their feelings and memories in order to determine who is worthy of Valhalla and those who must be slain for the greater good,” Freyja looked deep into Hermione’s eyes at the last sentence, electric blue eyes piercing hazel.</p>
<p>Hermione took a moment to compose herself, feeling as if she had been stripped bare by the stare alone. She finally spoke to Bellatrix, “so you are still the Bella I know, but with some new insight that had you turn away from Voldemort. Why did you come for me though?”</p>
<p>“I will always remain the Bella you know, I just have other names as well, now. I came for you, because not only can I sense the worthy and the unworthy, I felt a pull to you as soon as I had come to understand who I am. I didn’t understand why I was drawn to you, but Freyja has taught me to feel and to trust in my feelings implicitly. And I am very glad that I did,” Bellatrix tucked a loose tendril of hair behind Hermione’s ears as she spoke to her.</p>
<p>“She could feel that you are like her, my <em> Vita </em>. You are another of my Valkyrie, returned to Earth.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, that can’t be. I’m just me, I’m a muggleborn. I’m nobody important.”</p>
<p>“You have been important before meeting me and you will be important after meeting me. I do not care about things such as blood status because they are irrelevant when it comes to you. All Valkyrie are my children, maybe not biologically, but you are <em> mine </em> . I created you long ago and you are special and important. The moment you touched the pages of the great Yggdrasil tree, you came home to me. The book does not respond to just anyone. I imagine Bellatrix told you a little of what she experienced, great pain and extraordinary comfort; that is because she is my <em> Kunna </em>, my feeler. What did you experience, precious?”</p>
<p>“A dazzling, blinding light; it was all colors and no color at the same time. It became too intense to look at and in that moment when I closed my eyes I felt at peace,” Hermione looked up at Freyja expectantly. “There wasn’t any pain though.”</p>
<p>“No. You would not experience pain. You experienced true sight, my <em> Vita </em>. You are the seeing.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix slid close to Hermione once again, knowing that this overload of information would be getting to her and as she wrapped an arm around her waist, she felt Hermione relax into her. Bellatrix leaned in, whispering in her ear, “we are in this together. I know you are overwhelmed, but I am right here with you. </p>
<p>“What does this all mean?” Hermione asked The Lady.</p>
<p>“It means that since the moment you touched the runes on the book made from the Yggdrasil tree, you unlocked all the powers I have granted you. You will begin to see and perceive things about those who must be slain and those who will enter Valhalla when they have fallen. You will know their future actions, so you will always be one step ahead of them. Although you already are a wonderful host of my given attributes, you will begin to embody them more wholly. You will become a force to be reckoned with and you will have my <em> Kunna </em> at your side if you choose so.”</p>
<p>“Of course I want Bella at my side. I need her at my side,” as Hermione said this, she felt Bellatrix grab her side possessively, forging a path of heat straight to her core and up to her heart. </p>
<p>“Good. I am very delighted to hear this, my children. I expect wonderful things from you two. Now go, it has been a long day for you, <em> Vita </em>. You must rest and reflect and hone your skills. Make me proud, my Valkyries.”</p>

  <em>October 19th, 2002 </em>
</p>
<p>The moment Hermione and Bellatrix crossed the threshold into their cabin, Hermione was instantly weak. She sagged against Bellatrix’s lithe form and Bella proceeded to pick her up and carry Hermione to her bed.</p>
<p>“Bellatrix, I’m seeing so much. It’s too much, make it stop. I feel so drained.”</p>
<p>“This is the hardest part, you’ll feel better after you rest. You’re body is adjusting to your new skill and time passes differently in Valhalla. We’ve been gone three days and you need to regain your strength and adapt to having such power.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix turned to leave her, but was stopped by Hermione reaching out and grabbing ahold of her wrist in a vice-like grip. “How...how can we do this? I can sense so many people we must take down. We’ll never survive. Bella, I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“We will survive. Don’t doubt us. But if we must go down, we’ll go down together. I swear to you that I will never leave your side,” Bellatrix spoke passionately and as she spoke she grabbed Hermione’s face to look into her eyes to prove that she meant every word.</p>
<p>Hermione moved her hand from Bellatrix’s wrist and to the front of her cloak and pulled her in even closer, until their lips met with the fervor of three years of pent up emotions, and new revelations, and devotion.</p>
<p>“Together.”</p></div>
