    <h1>Chapter 1</h1><p> </p><p>Blood. There was blood everywhere. Draco Malfoy could only focus on the red substance which was gushing out of a stomach wound, out of Severus Snape's wound. The Professor was lying uncomfortably on the pavement. He looked half dead and he seemed to be struggling to keep his black eyes open, those same black eyes which had scared so many first years with a simple glance and that now looked so weak. His skin was even paler than normal and his breathing was irregular and frail. The blond boy gulped as a nasty thought clicked: his godfather could die. He panicked. How did he end up in a sleazy muggle street from only-Merlin-knew-where with a drained off Snape? Flashes came through his mind…</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>Narcissa Malfoy was unconscious and lay on the cold floor of her Manor. Some Death Eaters had witnessed as she had been crucioed relentlessly by Lord Voldemort until she blacked out, including her own son.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort was now pointing his wand at the young Malfoy, who had never been so scared in his life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I expected more of you, Malfoy. The task was simple: to kill the man. Yet, if it weren't for my loyal servant, that imbecile would still be breathing." Voldemort paused as Draco closed his eyes and thought of something to say, anything to save his life. "You have failed me," the Dark Lord whispered each word slowly and with loath in his voice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Tell me, Malfoy… What do you expect me to do? I cannot let you go that easily without any punishment, can I?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There were some cheers coming from the Death Eaters.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Silence!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Everyone instantly shut up when they heard their master's voice resonating through the big cold room. Draco's eyes were desperately looking for his mother's body hoping that she'd wake up and get him out of this mess, for he knew that he wouldn't be able to get out of it alone. It was no use though, the curses had been so intense and so strong he doubted she'd make it out of it alive. He didn't know whether she was still breathing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort's wand was now caressing Malfoy's pointed chin, making the young boy cringe inside.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You will pay for this betrayal, Malfoy. And the price will be your death."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His grey eyes widened in true horror and Draco felt his palms sweating. He was dead and he knew it. He could do nothing but wait for his last breath. He was paralyzed. As soon as the first syllable of the killing curse got out of Voldemort's mouth, a silky baritone voice cried out, "Run, Draco, run!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco didn't have time to process who had uttered these words, but miraculously, he did as the voice instructed and broke into a run, avoiding jinxes and hexes which were thrown at him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Idiots! Follow the traitors!" Voldemort ordered annoyed by the interruption.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The slytherin boy soon realized that he couldn't apparate for some reason, probably Voldemort's doing, and he also noticed the doors were closed. No spell worked. Alarmed, he did the only thing which came to his mind: he hid in his room as he tried to think of a way to get out of the manor. Suddenly, a cold and sweaty hand covered his mouth. Malfoy freaked out and tried to break free, but the person was stronger than him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Get the broomstick. Now!" the silky baritone voice hissed. It was then he realized that the voice belonged to his Professor. "We'll have to fly away and then apparate once we're far away enough. Got it?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco nodded and hurried to get the broomstick, which was luckily in the cupboard of the room they were in. They heard some steps from Death Eaters who were climbing the stairs, looking for them. Snape indicated with his finger to keep quiet. Silently, he got on the broomstick and motioned for Draco to do the same. He opened the window and once they were out he ordered the boy to close it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco was about to do it when he saw his aunt Bellatrix with mad eyes screaming at them and throwing jinxes, hexes and curses. Draco tried to stop them all before he felt the sick feeling of apparating.</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>He understood everything now. His aunt must have caught Snape with one of her dark spells. The young Malfoy cursed himself for not having stopped the witch. His eyes still hadn't moved from the wound he could see through his professor's black robes. The shape of the wound seemed familiar… It was as if he had been hurt in the same way. It was then that it clicked: Bellatrix had used<em>sectumsempra</em> the same way Potter had used the curse against him. He tried to recall the counter-course Snape had muttered when he was the one in the same position, but the memory was too blurry.</p><p>"Professor! Can you hear me?" he yelled in a quivering voice.</p><p>Snape gave a scrawny nod.</p><p>"Good!" he squealed as he passed his hand through his platinum-blond hair, in a clear signal of distress. "You have to tell me the counter-course of <em>sectumsempra</em>!"</p><p>"Vul-" he trailed off and looked like he was making a painful effort to voice out the words. "Vulnera san-" he coughed.</p><p>"Come on, Snape! I need to know it so that I can heal you!"</p><p>"Sanentur," he breathed out.</p><p>"Vulnera-sanentur?"</p><p>He seemed to be about to nod, but the man blacked out.</p><p>"Professor?"</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>"Bloody hell!"</p><p>Malfoy took out his wand and prayed that he had heard the words correctly. With trembling hands, he moved the wand over the wound as he whispered <em>vulnera-sanentur</em> over and over again. The wound stopped bleeding, but it hadn't closed. He wasn't a healer, what was he supposed to do? <em>Shit, now what?</em>, he thought. <em>I'm a wizard with no knowledge about muggles lost in a solitary muggle neighborhood with a man who could stop breathing anytime now.</em></p><p>"Please, Snape! Wake up! I did everything I could…" he begged as some tears fell down his eyes, but the black-haired wizard kept still. He looked like he was sleeping, if one forgot about his paleness and his gash.</p><p>"Dammit Snape! My father is in Azkaban and my mother is probably dead! You're my godfather! You can't leave me too! Stay with me!" he screamed as he kept hitting his chest, hoping the smacks would wake him up. Malfoy tried to think of something to do, but he was an outsider to the strange muggle world. He didn't know how to react but there was one thing he was sure of: he had to hide everything magic-related. Quickly, he vanished the flying broomstick and then he took Severus wand and hid it with his own.</p><p>Just as he did that he heard a gasp. It didn't come from Snape, so it meant that the solitary muggle street wasn't as solitary as he had previously thought. He swallowed the fear of the unknown and turned around, only to be face to face with a muggle woman who had let some bags she was carrying fall to the pavement due to the shock.</p><p>"Oh my god! Is he dead?" she asked Draco with a quaking voice.</p><p>"I-I don't k-know…" he stammered.</p><p>The woman pushed the teenager aside and put her fingers on Snape's neck.</p><p>"He's alive! Come on, we have to call an ambulance!"</p><p>"Ambulance?" wondered Draco with a confused frown. He had never heard the term.</p><p>"Yes, ambulance! He needs to go to hospital! Now!"</p><p>"We can't go to a mug-hospital!" Malfoy begged, relieved that he had corrected himself before mumbling the word <em>muggle</em>.</p><p>"This man has a huge wound on his stomach! He needs medical help!"</p><p>"Not from a bloody hospital!" The young wizard was scared that if they actually went to a muggle institution and they started to make questions, everything could turn out pretty bad. No. He had to be discreet. A hospital wasn't the solution.</p><p>"Please! I've stopped the bleeding, but the gash doesn't close!"</p><p>The woman seemed distressed for a moment, pondering what to do, until she realized that this wounded man wasn't going to make it through without her help. Following her gut, she mumbled, "Fine. No hospitals. I live two blocks from here. Help me!"</p><p>She forgot about her bags and put Severus's left arm around her neck, motioning Draco to do the same with his right arm. They had to climb the stairs up to a 5th floor carrying the man, for there was no lift on the block of flats. The muggle opened her apartment and carefully put Severus on her bed.</p><p>"I'll get the first aid kit! Stay here!"</p><p>Draco was so nervous that he didn't even take a look at the apartment. His eyes were fixed on the stomach wound. When the muggle got back, she didn't waste any time and instructed, "Help me to remove his clothes!"</p><p>"Excuse me?" he didn't want to see his Professor naked.</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes and replied, "He needs to be shirtless so that I can inspect the cut better and actually heal it, so will you help me? Every second counts. The wound could bleed again, so be careful."</p><p>Against his wishes, he helped the woman out. Once he was shirtless the woman gasped. Draco saw the Dark Mark in his pale arm and froze for a second, but then he calmed down as he remembered that the woman was an ordinary muggle. She wouldn't know about Voldemort. His guess was that she had gasped due to the sight of countless scars all over his chest and belly. The truth was that it was a nasty view. He waited for the woman to react, but she didn't. Frowning, he eyed her and saw that she was petrified, staring at the Dark Mark. Her eyes had turned a shade darker and she looked like she wanted to kill the man, not save him.</p><p>"Madam?"</p><p>The muggle snapped out of it, bit her lip and babbled, "I think this needs stitches. I'm no nurse, but I'll do my best."</p><p>Draco observed as the muggle treated the wound. It was then that he really took in her appearance. The woman was slightly shorter than average. Her skin was tanned: not dark enough to be considered black or fair enough to be considered white. She had curly dark brown hair which reminded him of an afro style. Her eyes were hazel with some golden bits in them. Her nose was upturned and she had large full lips. It was easy to see that she was a mulatto woman: half white half black. What shocked him most about her though was her belly: she was pregnant.</p><p>When she was half-way through her task she requested, "Damn! Please, lad! Could you bring me the bags! They'll be on the pavement, luckily, if someone hasn't robbed them yet… I was so worried I forgot to close the door, so go, please!"</p><p>Draco was stunned. He didn't want to leave Snape alone with this stranger, but he knew he couldn't help him much in this situation. Hence, he got the bags, which no one had stolen, and got in again. Once he entered, he saw that the woman had finished the job and was pointing at him with a big and sharp knife. Her hazel eyes looked mad. The poor color from his already pale face whitened even more.</p>
