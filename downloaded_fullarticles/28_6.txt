    <p>It was Teddy Lupin's seventh year when he first got really angry.</p><p>He was seventeen, young and in love and hopeful. He was seventeen. He was seventeen. Teddy Lupin was a seventh year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was seventeen, and he realized that his father, his godfather, and most of the adults he knew and loved were seventeen when their innocence was stolen. He was seventeen.</p><p>Teddy Lupin knew that he didn't know anything. He was oblivious to the things that truly mattered. Teddy focused on quidditch and being Head Boy and loving Victoire and passing NEWT level potions. He wondered if his father passed potions his seventh year. He wondered if his mother, who had him at twenty-four and died at twenty-five, was afraid for her life at seventeen. Teddy Lupin was seventeen and he always, always, always felt safe.</p><p>So, Teddy sat in the library, pouring over the books that detailed the wars, the pain, the suffering. And he was so angry. He wanted to hit something, break something. He wanted to fucking resurrect Voldemort just to kill him again, with his bare hands like the muggles did. Teddy Lupin was seventeen and seething, so he visited his godfather.</p><p>Harry James Potter sat at his desk, obviously tired, planning out his Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for the next day. Teddy barged in, breathless and red in the face, and promptly burst into tears. God, it hurt Teddy just to look at his beloved godfather. He could almost see him at seventeen, crying by himself and feeling so overwhelmed and hopeless. Harry set down his folder and walked over calmly, his work forgotten.</p><p>"What is it?" The words were shared delicately, as Harry pulled Teddy into an embrace, stroking the mop of purple hair on Teddy's head. Harry felt Teddy's chest, rising and falling rapidly as he cried.</p><p>"You were seventeen, when it all happened."</p><p>Teddy spoke in a raspy whisper, sniffling and pulling his head away to stare up at Harry. Harry, who had raised him on the days when Andromeda just...couldn't. Harry, who had healed himself up with tape and glue and taught Teddy about love, his parents, and magic. Harry, who was as much his father as Remus Lupin had been. </p><p>"Oh, Ted," Harry paused. He didn't know how to respond. "It's okay. It's okay."</p><p>And when Teddy looked him in the eyes, he knew Harry, who had raised him, was a liar. It wasn't okay. It was all so fucked.</p><p>"I was so angry at one point, too," It was as though Harry could read Teddy's mind. "I was so fucking angry. Merlin, I still am, but there's something stronger than anger and hate."</p><p>Teddy Lupin was seventeen, Harry Potter was thirty-five, and they understood. It was a silent understanding that the anger never really does go away. They both understood, Teddy for the first time in his life, that anger would always, always, always be replaced. He would replace it with love. </p><p>Harry looked at Teddy in a funny way, as though seeing himself at seventeen. No, it was as if he was meeting seventeen-year-old Remus. </p><p>Teddy Lupin wiped the tears from his face and stood straighter, nodding at his godfather, who stood several inches taller than him. In that moment, they knew each other like the back of their hands. They were cohesive.</p><p>Teddy Lupin was seventeen and angry, but, that afternoon, he sat with Victoire Gabrielle Weasley on the steps and knew love. Victoire was fifteen and had a fire in her belly. It would only be a few months before Victoire was really angry, too. They would always be angry. Hell, even Teddy's youngest "cousins," Hugo and Lily, would be angry one day. Teddy Lupin was the first to know true anger, but he would not be the last.</p><p>Looking at Victoire, feeling the same warmth of Hogwarts that <strike>his father</strike> his fathers had before him, knowing he would never, ever be alone, Teddy Lupin was seventeen and he truly knew love.</p><p> </p>
