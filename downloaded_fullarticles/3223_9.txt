  <strong>17th July 1975</strong>
</p><p align="left">Caught in the sleepy, half-wakefulness which comes like the time between the end of the night and the start of the day, the first thing which Regulus became aware of was the fact that he was cold.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus was cold.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He was cold and his arse was numb and he seemed to be sitting up against a wall rather than curled up in bed which meant that something was very much wrong, and someone would be held responsible.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It took him an unknowable amount of time, but Regulus eventually managed to unstick his tired eyelids from one another. He discovered then that he needn’t have bothered.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">His head hurt, his eyes were tired and gritty, and Regulus Arcturus Black was sitting on the cold, hard, ground in complete darkness, when his memory was trying to convince him that he should have been safe in bed.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">(He resolutely ignored the small part of his mind which whispered about grey skies and hard stone.)</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">All in all, things did not seem to be going Regulus’ way.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Gladly, he stretched out his legs, which were drawn up against his chest, and frowned when his boots- and why on earth was he dressed if he should have been in bed?- almost immediately nudged a wall.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus- unacknowledged panic starting to rise like bile in his throat- patted the ground.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Smooth stone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He touched the wall behind him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Smooth stone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He leaned forward and ran his hand over the other wall.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Smooth stone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus stood up, somewhat unsteadily, and his heart sank when he heard the scrape of metal over stone, felt a weight around his left ankle make itself known.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Feeling very defeated all of a sudden, he reached a hand up over his head.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">His fingertips brushed yet more smooth stone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">An icy cold feeling settled in Regulus’ stomach, and he was now uncomfortably aware of the sound of his own heartbeat.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus leaned back against the wall, closed his eyes (for all the difference it made), and focused on taking a few nice, deep, breaths.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> Stop panicking, </em> he told himself sternly. <em> You are a Black and a Slytherin to boot. Panicking is not beneficial, and Slytherins do not do things which are not beneficial. Panicking is not </em> proper, <em> and Blacks are always </em>proper.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Unsurprisingly, this did little to comfort him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> There is no reason to panic, </em> continued Regulus, not sounding at all convincing. <em> You are alone in a dark cell, chained to the wall and unarmed. You have either been kidnapped from your bedroom in your highly secure home- which is exceedingly unlikely- and then dressed by persons unknown- which is exceedingly unpleasant to consider- or you dressed yourself, left the house, and were kidnapped and possibly Obliviated then. Alternatively, you may have decided to channel your inner idiot, and have done something remarkably stupid which has brought you here. </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>There is still no reason to panic.</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There may have been some reason to panic.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus pushed all of these unhelpful thoughts- thoughts of fear and irritation, and fear of his parents’ reaction because waking up in a cell seemed like the sort of thing that would happen to <em>Siriu</em>s- as far away from the forefront of his mind as possible, and decided to focus on much more useful things- exploration and escape.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">(He stamped out the irrational spark of unease and annoyance which flickered in his chest at the thought of his parents. He decided to blame it on the stress of the situation getting to him and messing with his head.)</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Kreacher!”, called Regulus, knowing that if he could at all, the elderly house-elf would appear before him in no time.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The quiet pop of elf apparition never came.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus opened his eyes again, and scowled at the unchanging darkness.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He decided to explore the part of the cell to his right first.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Carefully, cautiously, painfully slowly, Regulus inched forwards in his chosen direction, expecting to trip over some hidden hazard of fall down a hole at any moment. His right hand stayed glued to the wall, the other alternated between trailing along the other wall and reaching out blindly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The cell got wider the further along he went. By the time he reached the end of his chain, Regulus was standing at a point of the cell where he could nearly lie out flat without touching either wall.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There had been nothing of note on the ground, or the walls.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The cell could have stretched on forever from where Regulus’ tether kept him, or it could have ended in another wall less than an inch from his outstretched fingertips. It was impossible to tell, and this part of his prison was just as hopelessly dark as the rest of it had been.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus was still cold.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus huffed out an annoyed breath and then shuffled backwards until there was enough slack on the chain to turn around.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">With his left hand on the wall now, and eyes still wide and searching for even the faintest glimmer of light, Regulus started back the way he came, very determinedly ignoring the small part of him which was whispering anxiously about the dark, and the pain in his head, and <em> what if he was blind and it wasn’t dark at all, what would his parents say, </em>he didn’t like this, he didn’t like this, he didn’t-</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The cell got narrower again as he walked, and Regulus soon found himself passing the point where he had woken up.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">His lonely journey was suddenly made much less lonely by the quiet noise which had chosen that moment to make its way to Regulus’ ears.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Breathing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Someone, or something, was breathing somewhere in front of him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Very carefully, Regulus continued to shuffle forwards, listening for any other indication of a cellmate.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>Please don’t be an animal. Please don’t be an animal. Please don’t be a-</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus’ right foot collided, all of a sudden, with something rather soft.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The soft thing yelped.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Hello?”, said Regulus to the darkness, sounding slightly more uncertain than he would have liked.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
  <em>Don’t be an animal- they’re useless. Don’t be an animal. Don’t be-</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Hello,” said a boy’s voice warily, from where Regulus’ foot had found the soft thing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Something- a finger, he realised belatedly- poked Regulus’ shin. Regulus tried not to shriek and instead let out a slightly strangled-sounding noise.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Who are you?”, asked the boy.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus stared down into the darkness for a moment.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Regulus,” he said eventually, deciding to keep his surname to himself until he had more of an idea about his cellmate’s political ideals.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Regulus?”, repeated the boy, what sounded like incredulity colouring his tone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“<em>Yes,” </em>said Regulus testily, patience suddenly wearing thin with someone other than Sirius, for once.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“You know, like the star?”, he added in a slightly less irritated tone, mentally kicking himself for snapping. It would hardly do to alienate his only possible ally so early.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">When this didn’t induce a positive reply (or any sort of reply at all, really), Regulus wrinkled his brow at the darkness. “Part of Leo? One of the brightest stars in the sky? Usually most visible in the northern hemisphere in win-”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Yes, yes, I know,” interrupted the boy, huffily. “I <em> did </em>do First Year Astronomy. You just surprised me, is all. I must’ve read it somewhere recently,” his tone softened and became a bit distant, as if he was just thinking out loud. “It seems oddly familiar.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“First Year Astronomy? How did you-”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“What Muggles would name their child <em> Regulus? </em>”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I don’t know. Intelligent ones?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Maybe,” the boy allowed.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Who are <em> you?”, </em>asked Regulus, deciding that that was more than enough discussion of his name (which was a nice, respectable, family name) for one day, thank you very much.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Harry.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“What’s it short for? Henry? Harrison?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Nothing- I’m just Harry.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“What wizard- or witch- would name their child <em> Harry? </em>”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“My parents, seemingly,” said the newly-identified Harry.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“<em> What </em>were they thinking?”, asked Regulus, finding it hard to believe that a magical couple could ever give their child such a mundane, common, name.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">(It was perhaps a tad illogical- odd, even- for Regulus to fixate on such a minor detail. He blamed stress and the panic that he was most definitely not feeling.)</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I don’t know,” said Harry, an odd mix between amusement and wistfulness in his voice.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus decided that it was time to change the subject.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Where are we?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Harry was silent for a moment.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus heard the rustle of fabric, and then Harry mumbled, <em> “Oh, right.” </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I don’t know,” said Harry more loudly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There was something vaguely familiar about his voice, Regulus decided.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I’ve been here for a while,” continued Harry. “I don’t know how long- long enough for twelve meals, but I don’t know how long’s in between each one. They bring me out what feels like a lot. Just outside is a load of cells- they’re all empty now. Upstairs is a fancy hallway, and then a fancy library-type place. I haven’t seen anything else- I think there’s a big garden outside.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Why do they bring you out?”, asked Regulus, heart starting to sink. It was very possible that he was locked in a cell with a traitor of some sort, or perhaps a prisoner of war- for whom, was the question.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em> If I’m locked in with a traitor, then what did </em> I <em> do? </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Another rustle of fabric, an awkward pause, and an irritated-sounding sigh.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Er, I dunno. I woke up here ages ago- can’t remember how I got here. They ask me questions about useless stuff- where I grew up, my name, how old I am. That sort of thing- nothing important. They always ask the same things- I think they think I’m lying. They won’t tell me why I’m here.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Who are <em> they? </em>”, pressed Regulus.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I <em> don’t </em> know,” said Harry, frustration suddenly evident. “I haven’t a <em> clue- </em> there’s always at least four of them, they never use any names, they’ve got some sort of spell that makes it hard to look at them, and apparently they’ve Obliviated me <em> at least twice </em> since the last time I tried to get out went absoLUTELY <em> SHITWAYS!” </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus stayed quiet, heart thundering.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The only sound in the cell for a few moments was Harry’s harsh breathing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus was very much not used to being shouted at- it was usually Sirius or even Kreacher who took the brunt of that at home, and his various Quidditch captains had all been much more inclined to make nasty comments rather than shout insults.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He decided that he didn’t like it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I’m sorry,” said Harry quietly, sounding reasonably contrite. “I shouldn’t have taken your head off like that- it’s just that nothing I try seems to work lately, no one’s coming for me, and now you’re stuck here too. It’s- it’s all gone to shit, recently.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“It’s alright,” said Regulus. “You didn’t mean it, you’re under stress- I know. Just- <em> don’t shout at me again,” </em>he finished more sharply than he had meant to.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I’ll try not to,” said Harry.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There was <em> definitely </em>something distantly familiar about the pitch and timbre of his voice, Regulus decided. It was as if he had heard someone similar-sounding years ago and was only now remembering. The accent was wrong, though- jarringly so. Harry’s mish-mash of southern English middle-class and western working-class refused to line up with the shadowy half-memory.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus decided not to fixate on it. There were much more important things to be thinking about.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“You might want to sit down,” said Harry. “Nothing’s going to happen for ages- they brought me out before you arrived; I must’ve been asleep when you got here. Unless they want a word with you especially badly, it’s going to be just us for the next while.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus slipped down onto the floor, and frowned at how constrictive this end of the cell was.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Why are you in this tiny corner? I can actually stretch out properly a bit further down.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">A rustle of fabric, a beat of silence, and then an annoyed breath.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Sorry- I keep forgetting that it’s too dark for you to see when I shrug. <em> Anyway, </em>it’s alright back here. This is the back wall, so they actually have to come get me, it seems a bit warmer than the rest, and the door’s down the other end. I don’t like sitting too close to it- never seems to work out for me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There was a loud clank, and an odd sort of amusement in Harry’s voice when he said, “I can’t get too close to the door anymore anyway- they’ve got me tied down properly now. My arm’s been stuck to the wall ever since that time I managed to break the thing on my ankle and run past them.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Oh,” said Regulus, ineloquently. He wanted to say something- he didn’t know what, just <em> something- </em>to sum up the sheer horrendousness of the situation. He had a feeling that Harry was already fully aware of all that, though.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Has it always been this dark?”, he asked instead. “How are you supposed to eat if you can’t see anything?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Very messily,” said Harry, with half a smile in his voice. “It used to be fairly bright in here- some sort of spell on the stones, I think, because there wasn’t any torch or anything. They took away the light after the second time I tried to run- I broke someone’s nose, apparently, and they weren’t too pleased with me. It’ll hurt when they open the door- it’s bright outside.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Besides,” Harry added after a moment, “if you’re funny about dirt, it’s probably for the best if you can’t see anything in here.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“And why would that be?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“There’s this <em> stuff </em> in here- I dunno what it is. It looks a bit like coal dust, and gets <em> everywhere. </em>I’m covered in it now- I’m trying to get some on their fancy rug upstairs.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Dust?”, asked Regulus, deeply confused.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Silence, then, “I just nodded.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Why dust?”, Regulus asked no one in particular. “They could easily keep the cell clean, and it would only be slightly demoralising anyway- but it isn’t at all because we can’t see it. So why bother?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“It must <em> do </em>something, then,” said Harry, thoughtfully.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">There was the quiet sound of metal over stone and then a bony knee bumped against Regulus’ thigh.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Sorry,” said Harry, before continuing, “it can’t be to make it dark in here, or cold- the dust was here before that.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“It wasn’t always cold?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I just shook my head. No, it used to be warm enough. Not cosy, or anything, but not as cold as this either. I don’t know why they made it cold- don’t remember doing anything, though they might’ve Obliviated me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“So we, and this cell,” began Regulus, “are covered in what looks like coal dust. This dust is likely magical in nature, and doesn’t seem to have any noticeable effect on our environment. Therefore, it must be here to affect us. In what way, is the question.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Harry was quiet for a minute.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“You’re clever, aren’t you?”, he eventually said, voice strangely wistful. “You remind me a bit of one of my best friends- Hermione. She’s absolutely brilliant- reads hundreds of books every year at school, and she can work just about anything out.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Oh,” said Regulus, feeling both slightly uncomfortable and slightly touched. “Thank you.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“And,” continued Harry, sounding as if he was trying to contain a laugh, “she talks a lot and asks loads of questions- like you. Bit bossy, to be honest, and she sometimes panics a bit when she’s under pressure.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus narrowed his eyes in Harry’s general direction. “Charming.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Sometimes,” said Harry blithely, bringing to mind Sirius and his...<em> friends. </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus sighed.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Harry snorted.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Right, right, sorry. Enough messing about- back to the dust. The magic dust. The very important magic dust.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He sounded like he was trying not to laugh again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus raised an eyebrow. “Are you <em> quite </em>alright? Have you hit your head, perhaps? Is the lack of light starting to get to you?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“No, no, I’m fine,” said Harry, sounding serious once more. “Don’t know what happened there- wasn’t even that funny.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“The dust, perhaps.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Maybe.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus rubbed a hand over his face and sighed, suddenly bored. “Tell me about yourself- we’re stuck together for who knows how long.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“What about the dust?”, asked Harry.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“<em> Fuck </em> the dust,” said Regulus vehemently, surprising himself. “Fuck the dust, and the dark, and this cell, and whoever it is upstairs, and-and-my <em> parents,” </em> his voice cracked on the word, even as a weight suddenly lifted from his shoulders, as if he had been waiting to say it for years, “and-and the <em> war. Fuck </em>the war, too.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Oh, er, alright,” said Harry, sounding a bit awkward. “You’ve got a point there- <em> fuck </em>the war.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“So, Harry, how old are you?”, asked Regulus, trying not to think about what he had just said about his parents. What he <em> couldn’t </em> have just said about his parents because he loved them and they loved him, and he was the good son who did as he was told even when he didn’t want to and he never questioned them, he wasn’t <em> Sirius, </em> he hadn’t meant it, he <em> couldn’t </em>have meant-</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Er, fourteen, I think? Maybe fifteen, now.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus blinked slowly,</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“How long, exactly, do you think you’ve been down here?”, he asked, trying to keep the horror out of his voice because horror wasn’t beneficial, Regulus.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Er, I dunno. Week or two, maybe? Wh-<em> oh. </em>Oh, no. No, my birthday’s coming up, is all. The end of July. I can only sort of remember a few days of the start of the holidays, so I must’ve wound up here then. Relax, Regulus. That’s still a ridiculous name, by the way.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“It’s better than <em> Harry.” </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“<em>I </em> like being called Harry,” muttered Harry. “Aunt Petunia always said that it was nasty and common- it’s loads better than <em> Dudley.” </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“<em>Who-”, </em> Regulus’ voice rose uncomfortably high, and he had to take a moment to clear his throat. “Who names their child <em> Dudley, </em>of all things?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“I shrugged. My aunt and uncle, apparently. I always thought it was a bit unfortunate.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Was he not picked on at school?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Dudley? God, no- <em> he </em>did the picking on. No one ever messed with Dudley, when we were younger- he was always the biggest in our class and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would get all nasty with the parents of anyone who upset him. I s’pose it’s pretty much the same now- I haven’t asked.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They were quiet for a minute or two, before Regulus said, in a voice which was a bit petulant to even his own ears, “I’m tired, Harry.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He was aware, on some level, that he wasn’t really acting like himself, that things seemed inordinately odd or amusing and the whole world seemed hazy and dream-like, that Harry’s behaviour was somewhat unpredictable, as if he was prone to mood-swings.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Ordinarily, Regulus would have been concerned for his own safety and both of their sanities by now. The best he could do at present was muster up a sleepy wondering as to whether or not <em> this </em>was what the dust did, and confusion as to what exactly the point of it was.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Go to sleep, Regulus,” said Harry.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">A hand found his knee and patted it clumsily. “I’ll wake you up if anything happens.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus yawned- a great, jaw-cracking, thing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">“Will we get out of here, Harry?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Harry’s cheer sounded a bit forced when he said, “Of course we will- we’ll work something out.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was proof of how tired Regulus suddenly was that he didn’t react at all to the false optimism.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Instead he closed his eyes and tried to relax against the wall.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He was still cold and his arse was numb again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Regulus Arcturus Black fell into a slightly uneasy sleep, thoughts clouded.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Things didn’t seem to be going his way, lately.</p><p align="left"> </p><p> </p>
