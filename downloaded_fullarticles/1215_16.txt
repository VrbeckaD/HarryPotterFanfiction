    <p>Harry hated Ministry events, especially ones that celebrated <em>him</em>. He sighed as he downed his fourth glass of champagne that evening.</p>
<p>“Can’t you at least try and act like you’re having a good time?” Hermione asked, exasperation dripping over her words. She knew how those things went by then. Harry would say a few words to kick off the night then slip off to some random, isolated part of the room and quietly nurse whatever drinks they decided to serve.</p>
<p>Harry gave her a half-hearted smile. “I’m eighteen. I killed the most feared wizard of all time. I think I deserve to get drunk at a party thrown in my honor,” he said, his words slurring together.</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Do I have to babysit you all night?”</p>
<p>“What? No. I’m fine!” Harry stumbled a little before regaining his balance. “Really, ‘Mione. I’m good. Go have fun with Ron.”</p>
<p>She took one last look at him before clicking her tongue and disappearing into the crowd. Harry leaned against the wall, scanning the room, when his eyes fell upon Draco Malfoy standing by the champagne table. Without thinking, he downed the remaining contents of his flute, pushed himself off the wall, and made his way over to the blond boy.</p>
<p>Harry cleared his throat once he was close enough for Malfoy to hear. Malfoy flinched at the noise and turned. He scoffed when he saw who it was.</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Harry greeted cooly.</p>
<p>“Potter.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? Are you lost? Perhaps you were looking for the parole offices. That’s about two floors up.”</p>
<p>Malfoy watched him with an inscrutable look in his eyes. He shifted uncomfortably, readjusting his position so he was no longer slouching. “Piss off, Potter.”</p>
<p>“C’mon, don’t be like that. Can’t you humor the guy who got you out of a ten year sentence in Azkaban?”</p>
<p>Malfoy’s mouth pulled into a thin line. He closed his eyes and let out a breath of frustration before speaking again. “If you must know, I’m here on orders from my parole officer. She wants to ‘integrate me into society again’ or some rubbish.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re not really integrating by just standing here. Why don’t you go dance?”</p>
<p>Malfoy laughed mirthlessly. “I don’t dance.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you here? You’re hardly following orders. Why not just ditch all together?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Draco took a sip from his glass. “Were it my way, I wouldn’t be here at all. Though, unlike you, I can’t afford to skive off.”</p>
<p>Harry tilted his head to the side in confusion. “Unlike me?”</p>
<p>“No one’s going to tell off the Chosen One. The Saviour of the Wizarding World. The Golden Boy. The-”</p>
<p>“That’s enough, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. In his drunken state, he could hardly suppress his rage. He didn’t realize how loudly he’d actually spoken until he saw some people turn their heads. Malfoy’s face turned a light shade of pink.</p>
<p>Harry wobbled a bit as he watched the other boy examine him. “Are you drunk?”</p>
<p>“So what if I am? It’s my party.”</p>
<p>Malfoy shook his head. “I can’t be around you when you’re like this.” He started to walk away, but Harry couldn’t just let him have the last word, so he grabbed at Malfoy’s shirt and pulled him back.</p>
<p>At the time, it seemed like a good idea, but Harry quickly realized that he could barely stand up right. It all flashed so quickly before his eyes. He tried to steady himself before Malfoy knocked into him. Harry realized he was falling and clawed at the other boy for support.</p>
<p>Since Malfoy wasn’t expecting it, he fell with Harry right into the table full of champagne glasses. Harry sat there for a moment, eyes closed, before looking to his left. He saw Malfoy laying there, blood running down from a cut in his cheek. He sighed like he’d rather not move from that spot for the rest of eternity.</p>
<p>Harry heard someone clear their throat. When he looked up he saw Hermione looming over him, giving him a reproachful glare. Ron stood behind her, looking upon the scene with a shocked expression.</p>
<p><em>Death Eater Attacks Harry Potter at Ministry Event</em> was the headline of the Daily Prophet the next morning.</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, was seen at the Savior Ball late last night being openly hostile towards Harry Potter, the guest of honor at the event. Witnesses say that Malfoy was insulting and yelling at Potter only minutes before the attack. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“It was brutal,” said a Ministry worker who attended the ball. “He was yelling about one thing or another then took a swing at Mr. Potter which caused them to both go flying into the table. I don’t think Mr. Potter was hurt, but I saw Malfoy bleeding. Serves him right.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A bit of a betrayal on Draco Malfoy’s part since it’s said that Harry Potter spoke at his trial earlier this year. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I was at that trial,” a witch said. “He defended the Malfoy boy until the boy got acquitted and the mother got house arrest. Not much he could do for the father, but he said all nice things about how Draco Malfoy saved him.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Is this any way to repay the person who got you out of Azkaban? When it comes to a Death Eater, that doesn’t seem to matter. Word has it that both boys will be returning to Hogwarts to finish their education. Will the hostility follow them there?</em>
