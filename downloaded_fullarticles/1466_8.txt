    <p>Draco sighed, standing on the edge of the platform watching his son climbing onto the train to wave him goodbye. The last eleven years had been rather fraught for the two of them. But now, here he was, sending his son off to Hogwarts. He had never felt such a mixture of excitement and nerves since Scorpius had been born. At least he knew he wouldn't have as difficult a time of it as he had. Sure he'd be attending with a Potter and wasn't that just perfect, but Draco had done his best to ensure that his son was not brought into the world with the same prejudices he had been. <em>Maybe they would even become friends</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>Draco laughed to himself, <em>yeah, right.</em> A Potter and a Malfoy, friends. That'll be the day.</p>
<p>Scorpius waved to him from the window of the train and Draco smiled, waving back at him. <em>My little Scorpion, all grown up, </em>he thought.</p>
<p>"Cute kid," said a familiar voice from behind him. Draco gasped, turning his head. <em>Potter. </em>Of course, it was, Draco turned back around and barely resisted rolling his eyes. They were in public, and the last thing he needed was someone making a scene that the chosen one was deigning to be seen with a former Death Eater. "Can we talk?" Potter whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>Draco snorted, "No Potter, I'm afraid we can't. I'm very busy."</p>
<p>"It wasn't a question," Potter hissed. Draco cringed, turning around fast he glared at the dark-haired menace.</p>
<p>"Just because you're Head Auror doesn't mean you get to order me around!" Draco spat.</p>
<p>At this, Harry just laughed. "We need to talk, and I'd just as soon we do it in private."</p>
<p>"We have <em>nothing </em>to talk about," Draco replied. He refused to be swayed, even if the prat <em>was </em>devilishly handsome. With that bloody beard, and those denims, and that leather jacket. <em>Bugger it all to hell!</em></p>
<p>"I think we do," Harry said, leaning in closer to whisper in his ear. "When were you going to tell me we had a son?"</p>
<p>Draco swallowed, looking up into Harry's emerald green eyes then. "I have no idea what you're talking about," he lied.</p>
<p>Harry snorted, "I'll just bet. Let's go," he grabbed Draco's arm and dragged him off Platform 9 3/4.</p>
<p>"What about your wife?" Draco hissed.</p>
<p>"She can get back home on her own, this is work as far as she's concerned."</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, "Typical Potter, always full of shit."</p>
<p>"You don't get to make judgment calls here," Harry growled pulling them through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. "You kept my son from me for eleven years."</p>
<p>"You clearly weren't hurting for progeny," Draco snapped. "And let go of me!" he hissed, wrenching his arm free of Harry's grasp.</p>
<p>Harry merely stared at him, the two of them hidden behind the barrier. "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>"You really wanna do this here?" Draco asked, folding his arms across his chest.</p>
<p>"After all this time…"</p>
<p>"Oh for goddess sake!" Draco growled, grabbing Harry's hand and apparating them out of King's Cross and back to Malfoy Manor. "What do you want me to say Potter?"</p>
<p>"Tell me why!" Harry demanded. He swayed a little on his feet when they landed, trying to catch his balance. </p>
<p>"He looks nothing like you," Draco said.</p>
<p>"He looks EVERYTHING like me," Harry growled. "Green eyes, you think I couldn't spot that. My hair, but blond!"</p>
<p>"He's not your son," Draco growled.</p>
<p>"He is!"</p>
<p>"No. He's MY son. I'm the one who raised him!" Draco spat. "You were never there! But you know who was? My mother! Astoria! My friends. They were there for me. They helped me through the darkest times of my life. My mother moved in with me after Astoria died. Pansy helped me through that. Blaise made sure Scorpius was kept safe while your Auror's were hauling me off to the Ministry every other week. My <em>family </em>were the ones who made sure that my son had a stable life despite EVERYTHING YOUR PEOPLE COULD DO TO DESTABLEIZE IT! You have no right Potter to come in here and DEMAND that I tell you anything." Harry frowned. "I have given EVERYTHING to protect that boy. I would have bloody fought off Voldemort himself if I had to, to ensure he was safe. And then you come in here, after eleven years demanding to what? Play Daddy? You HAVE children. YOU HAVE A FAMILY. You made your choice."</p>
<p>"That choice was made for me!" Harry growled. "You <em>never </em>told me."</p>
<p>"It was a one night stand in which two scared teenagers got pissed and fooled around taking out seven years of anger and resentment on each other and then one of them got knocked up!"</p>
<p>"You just left," Harry said, quietly. Coldly.</p>
<p>Draco snorted, "As if it would have mattered? You were <em>always </em>going to marry the Weaselette. Carry on that perfect little golden family and perfect little golden Potter lineage. There was no place for me in that story. Oh yes, the savior of the Wizarding World and his Death Eater lover, and their bastard child. The Prophet would have a field day. They would have never <em>allowed </em>us a life."</p>
<p>"What do you even care what anyone else thinks. I don't."</p>
<p>"That's because they LOVE YOU!" Draco screamed, tears welling up in his eyes. "You have no idea what it's been like for me do you? Do you have any idea what it feels like to be in the middle of dinner and have Aurors show up to your house out of nowhere, and demand to look through everything, and then being hauled out of the house in chains, in front of your sobbing three year old, because they found some old relic of an artifact in your cellar that you KNOW for a bloody fact was not there this morning, and now you have to defend yourself while your house elf watches your kid and calls your mother? Do you know what it's like to not even be able to step foot in Diagon Alley without being spat at? To have to put up silencing charms around your child so that he doesn't have to hear all the lovely things people say about his father. To spend half of your life just <em>waiting </em>for the day that your son is going to come home and tell you he HATES you because of what you did when you were a child. Knowing full well that there is no possible way to avoid it. Have you ever even imagined what it might be like to have to sit your son down at ten years old and explain to him that he's going to have a very difficult time at school because of his father, after he BEGGED you not to send him to Durmstrang or Beauxbatons, because all of his friends will be in Hogwarts." Draco laughed despite himself, tears running down his face. "You couldn't even begin to fathom the life I have lived over these past twelve years and what I have done to make sure my child had some semblance of normalcy. I have spent EVERY waking moment hating myself for what I did, to the point where some days I couldn't even leave the house. So forgive me, Potter, if you weren't a consideration in my mind when Scorpius was growing up, I was too busy trying to figure out how to survive."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Harry said quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh save it, Potter, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not blaming you."</p>
<p>"I know. I just… I'm sorry I wasn't there. I should have tried harder. I should never have given up on you."</p>
<p>Draco snorted, "What's done is done. You have your life and I have mine."</p>
<p>"It doesn't have to be the end," Harry said.</p>
<p>Draco glared, "You're not leaving your wife Potter, and I'm not going to be the other person. Don't fuck up your family and your children's lives just because you feel guilty." </p>
<p>"I deserve to know my son," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Not going to happen," Draco replied coldly.</p>
<p>Harry blinked, "Draco you can't…"</p>
<p>"You don't get it do you?" Draco growled. "I am not going to risk my son's happiness for anyone. I don't care if you did save the Wizarding World and my arse on numerous occasions. He's been through enough. You have your kids and your family. You have <em>made</em> your decisions."</p>
<p>"I just want to be there for the both of you."</p>
<p>"Why? You don't owe me anything. You don't owe him anything either."</p>
<p>"He's my son," Harry repeated.</p>
<p>"No, he isn't, and I'm warning you, Potter. I mean this with every ounce of my being. If you come near him, I will do what Lord Voldemort never could, and not only will I kill you, I will rip off your flesh and wear your bloody face as a Halloween mask, do I make myself clear?" Harry nodded. "Good. Now, get out of my house."</p>
<p>Harry sighed, and made his way over to the floo, grabbed some powder and vanished in green flames. Draco closed his eyes, staring at the empty fireplace, and fell to his knees, and sobbed.</p>
