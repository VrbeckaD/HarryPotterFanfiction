    <p>Harry breathes in carefully through her mouth, mindful to keep the pressure on the fabric over her nose hastily covered by the bright red and gold Gryffindor scarf.</p><p>She can’t help glancing towards him, coiled up tight in the corner of the unused classroom, his normally neat and orderly hair tugged harshly in white-knuckled fists, his eyes fixed on his shoes.</p><p>She's older than him, even if her body isn't, but this is the first time she really feels it. He looks young, vulnerable in a way that worms through her instincts and makes her jaw clench down tight as she swallows thickly around the pheromones that are so dense she can almost taste them.</p><p>Outside the door there’s nothing but rubble – a stray spell in a duel far beneath the great hall in the dungeons. They’d thrown up silencing wards to avoid being caught and it wasn’t likely that anyone had heard them.</p><p>People wouldn’t be wondering about them until first lessons started at nine.</p><p>Harry nudges the time into existence, fingers flexing against her ribs at the glowing zero-three-zero-eight.</p><p>Not even five minutes had passed since her last check and she bends forwards, pressing her forehead against her knees, mushing her nose against the fabric, trying to focus on her own musty alpha smell and not the clean crisp, almost minty scent, of the omega in heat in the opposite corner.</p><p>If someone had told her that the boy who would grow up to become Lord Voldemort was an omega Harry wouldn’t have believed them. The sheer arrogance, the pride, the domineering way he commanded the room – all of it fit neatly into the profile of what an alpha was supposed to be like back in the beginning of the twentieth century.</p><p>When she’d met him on the battlefield in her time the reek of him had nearly brought her to her knees and she wonders when he’d changed and how much of what he’d become anchored in self-hatred.</p><p>“I hope you’re happy.” The fear hidden in the snarl only adds to the tension creeping through her neck and down her spine and she swallows a sound she knows would be entire unwelcome. “People have been speculating about me for years and here we are! The first to find out a <em>Gryffindor</em> <em>mudblood.</em>”</p><p>“It might surprise you,” she manages, her voice raspier than she means, “but I’m not about to out you or anything.”</p><p>A scoff and his scent is so thick that it’s impossible to hide the curl of acidic anxiety in the middle of it all.</p><p>She suspects that if it wasn’t for the fact that heat messed with an omega’s ability to do magic he would have made at least an attempt to her life by now. But with how tightly he was curled up, the lack of anything to drink during the three hours they’d already been stuck here, she doubts he’d manage much more than a stumble in her direction before he collapsed.</p><p>The alpha inside of her won’t let it rest and she shifts, resting her chin on her own knees to give herself a clear view of him, and, him of her, if he chose to. “I’m not,” she presses. “I might not like you, Riddle, but I’m not an-” <em>asshole,</em> she almost says, only just remembering the exact time she is in and- “I’m not <em>cruel.</em>”</p><p>“You only say that because you want to <em>fuck me.</em>” That, is definitively a word he’s picked up from her and she feels shame warming her cheeks because she feels her walls clench down on nothing at the sheer <em>filthiness</em> of it and – he isn’t wrong in the fact that every instinct inside of her is telling her to make her way over to him, on her hands and knees if she has to.</p><p>“You can’t help being what you are any more than I do,” she says but it sounds weak even to her own ears.</p><p>He can’t know how absolutely deplorable her want of him is – that she feels herself getting slick at the scent of him despite knowing that he’d be the reason for her parent’s death. That he’d, instead of killing her, had bonded them intimately in the future and that his death there had nearly brought her undone and caused a backlash of magic that had brought her to the beginning of his school years because she hadn't been able to cope without him.</p><p>Harry spies the restless twitching of his fingers, the way his nails hooks against the fabric of his slacks, worrying it with a low scritch-scratch of noise, his rump on the cold stone floor when he should be-</p><p>“Do you-“ She digs her fingers into her ribs. “Do you want my cloak?”</p><p>She regrets it almost instantly, embarrassment twisting thick inside of her chest, because of course he’d say <em>no.</em> Why would he want something practically bathed in her scent? <em>Why-</em></p><p>Her thoughts comes to an abruptly stumbling halt at the sight of the hand that slowly stretches out towards her, face deliberately turned away from her, and she’s reaching for the fabric before her mind has time to catch up.</p><p>The cloak is heavy – it’s winter, after all, and she’d taken to wearing it when padding through the dark corridors on nights like this when the cool air made their breaths mist. The alpha inside of her is proud of the choice and she pulls herself slowly to her feet and shuffles her way over, letting it pool over his arm and watching as he pulls it against his chest.</p><p>Her eyes flashes alpha red before she catches herself and takes a deliberate step back, forcing herself back into her corner and sinking down as she watches him inhale her scent discreetly, rubbing his cheek against it as he cuddles into it, shuffling it around to make sure it was beneath him and all the way around him.</p><p>Nesting.</p><p>Harry had never seen an omega do it before – had only heard Ginny sigh about how adorable Hermione had been when she’d burrowed down in her room before she was booted out to share with Harry instead while Ron ended up all the way in Bill’s old room.</p><p>Hermione had stolen all of her school cloaks and several of her knitted sweaters for her nest and she hadn’t been able to wear them without the underlying scent of omega heat for <em>weeks</em> afterwards.</p><p>She wonders if she’ll smell like him now – if she’ll be carrying around the crisp minty tang mixing with the smokiness of his magic.</p><p>Harry breathes in raggedly through her throat and forces herself to bury back against her knees as a shiver of desire pools low between her legs. She can feel her panties already uncomfortably wet with sticky want and it takes everything she has to not rub her thighs together as her walls clenches down with an achy empty feeling of want that she has no right to linger on.</p><p>Time passes and Harry’s mind wanders, counting the grey dark stones in the walls, reciting ingredients for potions, trying to recall the names of the bands Ginny had been introducing to her before-</p><p>“Would you swear it?” Harry twitches because Tom’s scent now had a tang of desperation to it that drags her full attention to him, biting down on the inside of her cheek as her mind and instincts veer. “Would you swear not to tell?” he presses when he looks at her, cheeks flushed, pupils so dilated that the reddish brown of his eyes were nearly completely lost.</p><p>“I would,” she says slowly, fingers brushing against the holster of her wand on the inside of her wrist.</p><p>“Do it,” he tells her, almost begs. “Do it and you can – you can <em>fuck me</em>.”</p><p>Harry gives him a long blank look that only makes his cheeks darken more, furiousness and helplessness in his eyes but also a dark reek of <em>want</em> that is so entirely disconnected from anything that she could have expected to leave his mouth that she forgets to breathe through her mouth and finds herself inhaling mint and smoke, eyes lidding, teeth biting down on her lower lip and red creeping around her pupil.</p><p>“I’ll swear it,” she forces out. “Because I’m not an <em>asshole.</em>”</p><p>She drags the wand out, breathing out harshly through her teeth as she struggles to center herself. “I, Harry Lily Potter, solemnly swear not to reveal Tom Marvolo Riddle’s secondary gender unless given his explicit permission.” The magic is sharp, livid and demanding and it isn’t until it’s sealed with a small mark on the inside of her wrist that she realises just what she’d done.</p><p>“Harry Lily Potter.” The name is repeated slowly with liquid curiously and an underlying triumph in his scent that really shouldn’t be making her feel things. “I knew you didn’t look like an <em>Elena Parker.</em>”</p><p>She draws a ragged breath. “No, I suppose I don’t.”</p><p>Some of the red is fading from his cheeks and he’s watching her with a fixed intensity that makes her swallow a noise of want as he shifts to his knees, making sure to keep her cloak close as he inhales.</p><p>“Potter – that’s a pureblood name.”</p><p>“I’m half-blood,” she bites out, far less defensively than she normally did because he was pulling himself up, one palm flat against the stones as he took a slow step forward and towards her as she shrunk back against her corner in response, suddenly overwhelmed as the scent of his heat threatened to swallow her up completely as her head tilted up to keep their eyes locked.</p><p>Domineering, leering, her walls squeezing down on nothing as he breathes in and out.</p><p>When he crouches down and puts a hand on her knee she doesn’t even hesitate, doesn’t think twice about letting it sink down against the floor, followed by the other, opening herself up to him, allowing him to carefully settle between her sprawled legs with one hand that slowly drags up to settle loosely high on her thigh.</p><p>She feels her muscles bunching, a low ragged noise swallowed roughly at her first look at his scent gland as her head hits the wall with a shiver.</p><p>He clasps her wrists in his hands, forcing them down to her sides, leaving her open as he leans forward and Harry squeezes her eyes shut as he drags his tongue from the hollow of her throat and up as she tilts her head to bare her neck instinctively, fingers flexing weakly as she twitches in his hold with a wrecked shudder.</p><p>She shouldn’t want this.</p><p>She should be shoving him off her, should have used her patronus to call Albus, consequences be damned.</p><p>She shouldn’t-</p><p>He pushes a knee up against her, trapping her between the wall and himself as she squirms, feeling his tongue, the way his teeth drags over her prickling flesh, the gentle pressure between the apex of her thighs as her head tilts helplessly, breathing in the heady scent of him so close that she can almost reach out and-</p><p>“Keep your hands down,” he demands in a breathy rush into her ear before releasing her and she forces herself to be still, so knotted up with tension that she barely move as she watches him draw back just enough to find her scarf and pull it off her, wrapping it around his own neck, hiding the scent gland as he inhales the smell of her with a dilation of his pupils and a slow shudder.</p><p>He reaches for the buttons of her shirt, and Harry watches as he takes his time, tugging it off stiff limbs and leaving her in a white camisole without bra beneath it.</p><p>He reaches for her belt next, drawing it through the loops and off completely, her palm pressing down against the ground to help him pull her pants down and over her rump and then down, one leg at the time, before throwing them aside with the shirt.</p><p>The stone is cold against her bare skin and she shivers, painfully aware of the dark damp fabric between her thighs and her nipples straining visibly.</p><p>He’s still dressed in his Head Boy uniform – pin proud on his chest beside the Slytherin crest, her cloak wrapped tight around him, her scarf dangling from his neck, and the sight shouldn’t be making her ache but it does and a ragged whine escapes her before she can reel it in as he leans forward and he pauses, nose flaring at the need that curls through her scent.</p><p>“You want me,” he murmurs it almost like a revelation, a thick satisfaction oozing through him as he draws back completely, pushing up and away from her as she stares at him with eyes that has gone nearly completely red, only sparsely flecked with green. “Come here.” He curls his fingers almost mockingly but the hunger in his voice is impossible to hide.</p><p>Harry stiffly gets her limbs to cooperate, bringing her up with only a slight sway and following him as he backs up against the large desk at the front of the board and she halts just a little bit away, wary even through the mist of want as she struggles against her instincts telling her to push him down, <em>to take him.</em></p><p>Instead she sinks willingly to her knees as he pushes against her shoulder, gasping at the onslaught of arousal from the omega as she breathes out with a shudder.</p><p>She knows what he wants, reaching to open his belt, a ragged noise of overwhelming need making her grasp at his hip at the sight of his cock, thick long and straining, unable to resist the need to push forward and nuzzle against it, inhaling the thick musky scent, wanting it for herself while angling her head, pressing a hand against it and letting it slide over her own scent gland as he stares down at her, his own breathing noticeably strained.</p><p>Harry angles her head, drawing her tongue up along the underside, feeling throbbing veins against the wet muscle, tasting the salty pre-cum over the slit.</p><p>He’s large for an omega – much larger than most alpha, even, and she feels her pussy clenching down as she opens wide, straining her jaw to get the head into her mouth, breathing carefully through her nose, drinking the scent of his heat as she pushes forward, blindly, until her nose touches against the curls at the base of it.</p><p>She flattens her tongue against him, throat straining where he’d sunk far deeper than she’d ever taken anything in her life, unable to breathe until she carefully pulls back, freeing her airways with a shudder and opening her eyes to find a pair of burgundy eyes staring down at her in hunger.</p><p>She realises, as she pushes forward, taking him inch after thick inch, that this must be his first time if he’d been forced to hide his status as an omega and the knowledge is overwhelming, her hands finding purchase and digging into his buttocks as she takes him down all the way to the root and hums, swallowing deliberately as he curses, hips snapping forward, his fingers straining against the wood of the desk.</p><p>She draws back and then forward, giving him an encouraging nudge to push into her, keeping her jaw loose and relaxed as his hip rocks instinctively, the head pushing against the back of her throat before curving and then dragging back along her tongue which she pushes up, mindful of her teeth.</p><p>There’s an edge of desperation to his scent, a warring disbelief of having an alpha willingly kneeling despite the fact that he’d gone to full heat, her eyes vivid red below him as he fumbles to grasp her dark hair, pulling her back and then snapping his hips forward to drive into her.</p><p>Harry struggles not to gag, tensing as he forces her nose into the curls at the root at crotch before dragging out until only the head of his cock remained and repeating it, the pheromones oozing so thick around them that there’s an almost drunken satisfaction veering with the thick knowledge of just who the omega fucking her throat was as he bends nearly in half, pressing hard against the back of her head to keep her in place, her throat plugged shut and her eyes widening in shock as he comes.</p><p>The feeling is strange – helpless and unable to do anything but swallow around him as he gasps and pushes impossibly deeper, forcing his cum into her belly without warning as she whines, pushing against his hip, jerking back.</p><p>But instead of letting her go he follows her and she finds herself on her back, his weight heavy on top of her, one palm pressing flat against the floor above her head as he pushes so deep down her throat that her eyes rolls into the back of her head.</p><p>He reaches down with the other to stroke along the base almost lazily with a little jerk and a wad against her tongue as he drags himself out of her mouth to a ragged gasp and a splutter as she coughs, staring up at him, his cock resting limply on the side of her neck, against her gland, and she shudders as he reaches down and strokes his fingers almost curiously against the bruised skin beneath the red of her eye.</p><p>She grasps at his hip with one hand, breathing hard, his pheromones settling with the first orgasm and her mind creeps slowly back to her, leaving a strange and achy emptiness in her chest with the realisation of what she’d allowed him to do.</p><p>And, worse, that she’d enjoyed it.</p><p>“Most alpha would never have allowed that,” he observes, being surprisingly mindful to keep himself elevated just enough to allow her chest to ride and fall beneath his weight with just a slight strain. “You’re a strange one, <em>Harry Lily Potter</em>.” The sound of her name in that rugged drag of his voice makes her clench. “I told you that if you swore, I would allow you to fuck me.” He stares down at her, brown eyes lingering on her swollen lips. “I changed my mind.” He leans down, leering. “<em>I</em> am going to fuck <em>you.</em>”</p><p>Harry is alpha – her instincts demand that she pushes him down, to show him just what she thought about it, to show him that <em>he</em> belonged to <em>her.</em></p><p>But she knows – she knows that he wouldn’t want it, that he wouldn’t enjoy it, that he’d <em>resent her</em> and she shouldn’t <em>care</em> but she <em>does</em> because the scent of fear that had filled up the room when he first went into heat <em>lingers.</em></p><p>She shouldn’t want him, but she does.</p><p>She craves him. Even in her time, pale and old and more monster than human a part of her wanted nothing more than to show him that, even if the rest of the world didn't want him, <em>she did</em>.</p><p>She knows that, had he only asked, she wouldn’t have hesitated to sink to her knees before him.</p><p>The knowledge is sickening, shameful, and she’d done everything in her power to keep it locked up inside of her when she’d realised just what time she’d woken up in. Taking a stance, challenging him, <em>angering him.</em></p><p>She might as well have been shouting <em>look at me.</em></p><p>Harry realises that he’s waiting for something – that there’s a curl of tension carefully hidden beneath her cloak, his face bent over hers, eyes searching, and she swallows, squeezing her eyes shut and tilting her head back in submission.</p><p>The hunger that flares through his scent is so thick it practically drips and she inhales with a choked gasp as his heat flares nearly twice as heady, spreading and curling around them in a thick mix of magic.</p><p>“<em>Alpha,” </em>he breathes and she only has a second to realize what he was going for before his teeth sank thickly into her bonding gland.</p><p>Pleasure explodes through her, hips arching sharply as she cries out, eyes opening wide, fingers clawing red lines into his skin as she chokes, shivering and quivering as he soothes it with gentle licks, realising with a shudder of warring relief and disappointment that he hadn’t broken skin.</p><p>She lets go of him as he eases down her body, dragging her legs up around his waist and bending forward to drag his tongue up her nipple, mouthing against the fabric as she squirms, feeling his flaccid cock against her core and knowing it was only a matter of time before he was getting hard again as she shivers.</p><p>His mouth is warm - his tongue wet and rough as he seals his lips around her, almost nursing as her chest darkens in embarrassment and arousal as she pushes up, rubbing the wet front of her panties against him and promptly choking on a gasp as he grasps her hip and grinds down hard with a hum that drags a ragged gasp from her.</p><p>Male omega were capable of carrying the children of male and female alphas but they could also impregnate female alphas. The ultimate life-givers.</p><p>But it was rare a female alpha who would allow herself to be impregnated – to carry the shame, bare to the public knowledge that she’d been taken by someone who was considered less than a man.</p><p>It was better in her times but here –</p><p>She groans when she feels him hardening against her, sweat beading against her back as she prevents herself from swelling, rubbing up against him with slick want as he grasps the hem of her camisole and drags his tongue over her bare nipple as he tugs it down, sucking in a way that edges on painful as he settles his weight on top of her, rocking against the spread of her legs.</p><p>She feels the drag of his pants, the uncomfortable press of his belt, but something prevents her from voicing it.</p><p>He draws back, staring down at her with a possessive sort of hunger as he pushes his fingers against the slick panties before he nudges her.</p><p>Mortification colours her chest deep red and she clenches her jaw shut and struggles against every veering instinct as she allows herself to be turned around, onto her hands and knees, stiff in a position that was only meant to be taken by an omega about to be bred.</p><p>Behind her he draws a ragged breath,the air spiking with his arousal, the scent of his heat the only thing that keeps her locked in place as he drags her panties down her hips and off her feet, his cock slipping up against her belly as he presses himself flat against her, palms dragging over skin, pulling the fabric up over her breasts and leaving it there.</p><p>She feels his head rubbing against her and – she’s never been fucked before.</p><p>She’s alpha – <em>it isn’t done.</em></p><p>He pushes forward, the head of his cock stretching her out painfully, and she grimaces, instinctively trying to shift away, only to jerk as he gives a push forward, feeling herself opening and swallowing around the head as he grasps at her hips.</p><p>The feeling is strange – aching and overwhelming as he slowly feeds her inch after thick inch until she’s all twisted up and overwhelmed and the slightest flutter makes an achy sort of pain twist through her and she realises that she’d been far less prepared to take him than she thought as she curls her hands, white-knuckled and overwhelmed and forcing herself to breathe as he finally bottoms out inside of her, painfully pressed up against her cervix, hips flush against her rump, belt and fabric pressing uncomfortably against her bare skin.</p><p>She reaches up, pressing a trembling hand against her lower belly and whines as he jerks, feeling him against the palm of her hand as he lets out a shuddering sigh. “Good alpha,” he murmurs and her teeth bares in an instinctive snarl only to jerk when his palm connects against her rump with a sound that rings too loud in her ears.</p><p>He’s pushing her – straining her instincts, <em>challenging them </em>as he draws slowly out of her before pushing inside, forcing her to stretch for him as a strange white-noise creeps through her and her vision tunnels on the dark stones.</p><p>Sweat drips on the floor below her, beading on her chest and pooling in the hollow of her back as he thrusts into her with a sudden painful snap that follows by another and another, not slowing down, the heat and pheromones so heady around them that every breath is loud and ragged and <em>it’s too much.</em></p><p><em>“Tom.” </em>It’s the first time she’s ever spoken his name and instead of slowing down it makes him thrust harder into her, cock pushing up against her cervix with a twist of her face and a shocked whine as her entire body jerks, trying to get away from it, only to find herself pulled back with another slap against her rump and a dark satisfied rumble from the omega fucking her as if- as if-</p><p>It’s wrong. It’s wrongwrong<em>wrong</em>. Her senses blare, her instincts are going haywire and she’s clawing against the stone floor as he fucks her, just as promised, rough and hard and uncaring for anything but his own pleasure as he repeatedly slams up against her womb, as if he could break through it, and she realises with a sickening twist of arousal and horror that she wasn’t taking any potions because <em>alphas weren’t supposed to need them.</em></p><p>“Not – you can’t come inside.” She reaches blindly back for him, knowing how fertile omegas got in heat and knowing that they didn’t have potions for abortion the way they did in her time and-</p><p>He groans, pressing her arm flat against her back, snapping into her hard, and she realises with widening eyes that he had no intention of stopping, that he was going to <em>breed her</em>, practically clawing into her skin and dragging her back painfully against him as he took her roughly, her hand unable to keep her up as she collapsed forward, hips hitched up, legs spread, knees pressed against the stone, her breasts dragging painfully against it.</p><p>She feels the swelling at the base of his cock with a mute noise of shocked horror and such a strong disconnect from her instincts that her mouth opens with a whine.</p><p>She’d heard about it – that male omega, when breeding a female alpha could – but she’d thought it was nothing but myth, just silly stories and-</p><p>“Tom-“ she gasps out as he pushes it up against her, trying to force it inside of her already far-too-stretched pussy with a relentless and punishing rhythm that edges on brutal, her face twisting up in pain, trying to jerk away but unable to under the heady potent pheromones of heat leaving her weak and overwhelmed beneath him.</p><p>None of the shakiness of his limbs remained – none of the vulnerability that had edged through him when the heat first crept upon him.</p><p>The knot pushes into her, white noise in her ears as he swells far wider than her body was prepared to handle, locking her in place with the head of his cock pushed and locked flat against the opening of her womb as he came hard inside of her.</p><p>Sticky white semen fills her up as he groans, murmuring soft praise against her back as his hips jerks as much as they can, his cock too large, the knot straining something inside of her as her breath hitches, fingers curling weakly where she lies, breathing hard, following along instinctively as he nudges her onto her side with a bit of careful manoeuvring, drawing her tight against him.</p><p>He’s warm against her back, their skin sticky, everything raw and too much and tumbling into an overwhelming mess of confused instincts at the feeling of his knot inside of her, of the warmth of his seed.</p><p>She realises, with a squirm, that he isn’t softening – that he’s just as hard and thick inside of her despite emptying himself and the fact that omegas could come several times in an hour makes itself uncomfortably reminded as he pushes experimentally up against her.</p><p>He nibbles on her shoulder as she tries to twist away only to gasp and still at the feeling of the knot pulling at her opening, heart pounding too hard inside her chest, whining as he pushed her flat out on the floor, legs on either side of her hips, arms wrapping around her as he fucked into her, keeping her in place beneath him until he came with another shuddering groan.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, her uncomfortably full from two more orgasms, the knot had finally deflated enough for him to slip out of her but she’s still aching, raw and needy and strangely empty despite being far too overstimulated as the head of his cock stretched and then popped out of her with a wet noise and a rush of sticky semen.</p><p>She’s aware of his weight over the back of her thighs as she remains still beneath him and he breathes out, nudging his cheek up against hers.</p><p>“Alpha,” he murmurs, breath warm, and she closes her eyes. “You’re mine,” he whispers. “All mine.”</p><p>She rasps a choked breath of want at the claim, tilting her head as he drags his teeth over her bonding gland with a slight pause as he worries it thoughtfully between his teeth.</p><p>He draws back, grasping her hips to turn her around, dragging her camisole up and over her head until she’s completely bare beneath him.</p><p>He touches her breasts, dragging his palm down her sides, touching the flat stretch of her belly as her breathing picks up, shuddering as his hardening cock drags against the slick and come between her legs, the knot still slightly swollen at the base of it.</p><p>She pushes up with a flare of her own scent and he goes willingly, allowing her to straddle his belly, keeping a steadying hand on her hip as she presses up, grabbing and guiding him into her as she sinks down inch after painful inch.</p><p>This way she can see the dilated pupils, the glitter of omega gold in his eyes, the want, the desperate need and <em>wonder</em> at the sight of her perched and spread on his cock with a little shudder, eyes closing briefly before opening up to full alpha red eyes.</p><p>She leans down, black hair falling down her right shoulder as she presses her lips against his ears. “This time <em>I’m </em>fucking <em>you.</em>”</p><p>He laughs, startled, and she inhales the scent of joy in the thick heady curl of arousal, mouth stretching as she tilts and slants her lips over his, deepening it as he opens up for her, coaxing him to respond – first clumsily and then with growing confidence as she moans, murmuring soft praise as she drags back, trailing down his chin.</p><p>She raises up, pressing down experimentally, feeling the stretch but also – she breathes in heavily, instincts purring at the sight of him below her, unable to resist pulling at the Gryffindor scarf until his scent gland was once again visible, nosing up against it, licking over it as she kept fucking him, setting her own pace as he shuddered beneath her, eyes lidding and neck tilting with invitation that is too delicious to ignore.</p><p>“I want to bond you, omega,” she whispers, clenching down on him. “Want to make you all <em>mine</em>.”</p><p>She nibbles on his jawline when he tenses, soothing him with soft murmurs and touch, whispers of want and promises as she rucks up his shirt, touching his pale chest, feeling the warmth of his skin as she fucks him, pressing down against him until the knot was straining against her entrance before pulling back as he shivered, attempting to push her down but unable to.</p><p>Roles reversed, instincts reversed, Harry’s eyes glows as she stares down on the future Dark Lord.</p><p>His eyes flashes as he struggles against himself – his fears and wants as vulnerability creeps back into him even as he fights to hide it.</p><p>“We are destined to be together,” she tells him, feeling the strain of the one-sided bond gaping wide inside of her. “Omega… Tom…” She clenches around him. “You are allowed to <em>want.</em>”</p><p>The noise he makes is desperate and Harry doesn’t fight it as he yanks her down and sinks his teeth into her bond gland, breaking skin as her eyes lid and she pushes down, taking his knot inside of her as his eyes opens wide, letting go with a choked cry as she twists and sinks her teeth into his, gnashing it hard, tasting blood while clenching down and he swells painfully inside of her, his hips stuttering in surprise as he fills her up.</p><p>The bond slots new and different and yet familiar inside of her as she shudders, instincts satisfied as she flattens herself against his chest, breathing out as he touches her hair hesitantly before smothering it down.</p><p>For the first time since Voldemort’s death she feels content.</p>
