    <p>Harry ran his fingers along the scratches in the frame on the underside of his bed, counting them under his breath. “Happy birthday, Harry,” he thought to himself as his fingers grazed the last one. His clock had died sometime in the middle of what he assumed to be June, and so he had no way of knowing exactly when midnight had passed. But if the hint of dawn peeking over the tops of the houses in Little Winging was any indication, it was definitely July 31.</p>
<p>After last summer, Harry had allowed himself to imagine a different sort of summer. A short visit to the Dursley’s where he would be promptly rescued by the Malfoys. But weeks had now passed without a word from any of his friends. He refused to believe that they’d given up on him. That bastard, Dumbledore, must have done something. He’d been forced to leave Hedwig behind when he’d been kidnapped from the school, not that it would do him much good with the bars and locks. He’d hoped, in vain, that perhaps given time his restrictions would ease up. After all, someone had to do the shopping, and the tidying, and the cleaning.</p>
<p>But not, it appeared as though the Dursleys had finally decided that the best thing they could do with their freak nephew was to lock him in his room and pretend he didn’t exist. If the sounds of arguing that floated up through the floorboards was any indication, Dudley at least was not at all pleased with this new arrangement. Not, Harry knew, because of any consideration for his cousin or concern over their treatment of him. No, it was because without Harry breakfast took a little longer, snacks did not appear at his side while he played his video games, and worst of all, it was he who had to walk to the store for the groceries.</p>
<p>At first it was also Dudley’s job to deliver Harry’s tray to his room. Although after finding Harry passed out on the floor of the room it was revealed that instead of bringing Harry the food, Dudley had hidden on the first floor landing and scarfed it down himself. Now Petunia was responsible for making sure that at least Harry got two, if not square meals, then perhaps very tiny triangle meals a day. Harry had long given up trying to talk to her. He’d begged, pleaded and sobbed to be allowed out. He offered to do all the regular chores and more, if only he could be permitted to leave his room and eat a proper meal.</p>
<p>She ignored him, and after a while he simply gave up. He hadn’t spoken since. Without Hedwig it was pretty strange to sit in one’s room and talk to oneself. He was certain that he’d heard somewhere that talking to yourself was the first sign of madness. Or was it when the voices started to respond? Either way, he had no desire to risk it. With nothing else to do, Dudley’s shredded comic books that had been abandoned in the back corner of the closet were only so entertaining, he worked out until he was exhausted. Unfortunately as the summer went on and the lack of food continued, it became more and more difficult to keep up with his workout routine.</p>
<p>He’d taken to sitting on his dresser, forehead pressed against the cool iron bars on the street below, and wondering about the future. How long were they going to keep this up? Would he be left here in September? Or would he be allowed to return to school. Surely Vernon would not tolerate his presence for so long. Knowing that eventually one of “his lot” was going to show up looking for him. But what if Dumbledore arranged it to be so? He wouldn’t put it past the old man to find some way to simply make him disappear now that it was clear he would not toe the line and become the perfect little solider that the Headmaster so clearly wanted. Perhaps this was designed to chip away his resolve and get him back in line.</p>
<p>Certainly by now there were people looking for him. The Malfoys knew where the Dursleys were, why hadn’t they come to get him? Maybe, a dark voice whispered in his mind as he watched the sun come up, maybe Draco was too busy with Fred to notice. What about Uncle Moony? He argued back. But Lupin had Black now. Black’s rehabilitation was likely to take much time and energy. Professor Snape! He smiled, certain that his Head of House would not give up on him. But the voice came back again, icy cold fingers like a Dementor wrapping around his heart as he remembered how tumultuous his relationship with the man had become. He blinked back the tears that threatened to fall, and ignored them when they slid down his cheek. </p>
<p>Today was his birthday. Whatever else, he’d managed to hold onto hope that they would not leave him there. No matter what was going in their lives, surely on his birthday they’d remember him. But, as the sun cleared the last rooftop and it was fully day on his fourteenth birthday he was forced to admit that it was at least possible he would be spending the entire summer here. He refused to entertain the possibility that his confinement would last longer than that. However powerful Dumbledore might be, the absence of “The Boy Who Lived” when school resumed would be noted. The idea of relying on his notoriety to save him turned his stomach. He was no more special than any other student at Hogwarts. But in his darkest moments, when sleep refused to come, he desperately hoped that someone, anyone, would notice and rescue him. The sky was beautiful this morning. A riot of colors and full of hope, despite his circumstances. He smiled softly thinking if this was his only present today he was going to at least enjoy it.</p>
<p>As it would happen, the sunrise was the very least of his presents. No sooner had the sun cleared the tidy row of rooftops when the house was rattled to its very core. </p>
<p>Petunia began to scream for Vernon that they were being murdered and Harry pressed his face to the bars, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of who it was at the front door. He also scanned the street, certain that the commotion would alert the neighbors. But not a single lace curtain was pulled back, and not an eavesdropper was to be seen along the entire length of the street. Desperately, Harry wondered if it might be magic. He’d seen some of the teachers use a small charm to make an area private if they did not wish to be overheard. And he knew that Pansy had been researching how it could be done. Could it be a witch or wizard at the door?</p>
<p>“HOW DARE YOU DISRUPT MY HOUSEHOLD!” Vernon’s voice was added to the chaos downstairs. Barely heard, despite the volume, over Petunia’s shrieking and Dudley crying that he was going to die without having finished the chocolate cake.</p>
<p>The commotion seemed to make its way through the house, and then suddenly Harry felt the tingle of magic on his skin. He wanted to cry. The feeling as so foreign, so familiar.</p>
<p>And then his door was exploding into pieces.</p>
<p>“Harry!” a voice said cheerfully. “You have your things?”</p>
