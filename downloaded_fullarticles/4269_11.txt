    <p>It wasn’t that James was ignoring his family per say- more that he was ignoring certain conversations about his life, and his life decisions that usually accompanied visiting his parents’ house. He had nothing against them- or his siblings. </p><p>Regardless of what his mother said in her letters- he really was really busy with work. Maybe not as busy as he tried to indicate- but busy enough. </p><p>So- when Albus showed up on his doorstep that night grinning with a bottle of firewhiskey and an admission that he had phoned James’ boss to ask when he would be off again- he couldn’t help but feel guilty for staying away so long. </p><p>The problem was- Al had absolutely no ability to keep his mouth shut about anything James told him. There had been that one time in his fifth year that he casually mentioned to him that he was seeing someone, and their mum had sent him a howler inviting his mystery girlfriend to tea over their next break. </p><p>She had dumped him the next day. </p><p>And then there was the time his sixth year he had mentioned he might not just fancy girls- that blokes weren’t half bad either; and his father had sent him a letter not two days later awkwardly explaining that they would of course still love him- but perhaps he should talk to his great uncle Charlie about all of that business because if he was being frank he didn’t really know how to have the gay sex talk. </p><p>James had blushed deep red every time he thought about if for nearly a year- he had sent Charlie a letter his seventh year when he actually needed advice on what to do with boys you might be honestly interested in having- relations- with. So at least he got that out of it. </p><p>So, when Al was standing there with a bottle of liquor he knew would make him spill his guts like a bucket of viritisirum- he knew anything he said would float back to his mother’s ears within an hour of letting Albus go. </p><p>It wasn’t his fault really- he was just terrible at keeping secrets. They ate the kid up inside until he wanted to explode- not that keeping things from his mother was an easy task either- Ginny Potter did not take no for an answer. </p><p> “Seriously Al; I’m good.” He had laughed sliding the shot back across the table to where his brother sat with the half empty bottle—looking utterly pissed. “I have to work in the morning.” </p><p>Which wasn’t completely untrue- but it just wasn’t exactly the reason he had been abstaining from the vice as of late. </p><p>“how’s- er- what’s her name?” Albus inquired</p><p>And it was everything James could do not to snort at him; “Bethany?” he asked, “I assume she’s well; though I haven’t spoken to her since I broke up with her- little over a year ago now.” </p><p>He laughed as Al downed the next shot and proceeded to throw himself onto the table. “I am going to hate myself in the morning.” He mumbled against the oak. </p><p>“you always do.” He replied. </p><p>“usually you’re there to hate yourself with me though.” He whined back. </p><p>“It’s called growing up Al.”</p><p>Albus lifted his head to scowl at him, “abandoning your family and not speaking to them for months is what adults do now yeah? How come Teddy has managed to make it to almost every Sunday dinner for the past year then- and you couldn’t even make it to one?” </p><p>James buried his head in his hand- this was exactly where he had hoped this conversation wasn’t going to go. </p><p>Because if he must know- that was exactly why James couldn’t make it to a single one of those dinners- because Teddy would be there- with his stupid face and his jokes and his girlfriend. Despite what everyone seemed to think- he did want to be there. </p><p>But one could get really sick of watching the boy you’ve been hopelessly in love with for the past- well quite a few years- lock lips with your cousin at your dinner table- all the while pretending you aren’t completely dying inside. </p><p>it wasn’t exactly his idea of a great time- he had tried; for a while to just- ignore all the problems going on around him. He tried ignoring the way his heart jumped in his throat when teddy talked to him- or the way his smile made It pound against his ribcage. He tried to ignore the way his smile wore wider on his face when Teddy sought him out of the crowd and they spent the whole night just talking in some corner about anything- and everything. Playing chess and talking about the books they had read lately or how James was doing in school or Teddy was doing at the muggle university he had decided to attend. </p><p>But it wasn’t as easy as it sounded- especially not when his face flushed red whenever Teddy touched him on the arm- or his ability to speak upped and ran away if he so much as gave him a hug- it wasn’t an easy thing to hide- and he was a terrible fucking person. </p><p>Because Vic was wonderful- and Teddy was great, and they deserved to be happy and they deserved to be happy without James running around with his damn feelings leaking all over the place because- it was ruining things. Because he couldn’t fucking control himself. </p><p>He tried not to think about it- the way Teddy’s lips felt pressed hard against his that night- strong and intoxicating and so fucking- wrong. But it had been a while- a long while and he couldn’t get the image- the feeling out of his head and he thought if he had to see him now after all this time- smiling and laughing and holding hands with anyone that wasn’t him that he would explode. </p><p>It wasn’t Teddy’s fault- James had ambushed him that night out by the shed- they had been talking and laughing and Ted had just looked so fucking beautiful- and he had just- done it. </p><p>And the second he did it he realized he had fucked it all up- that there was no going back from this moment and he had run away before Teddy had a chance to let him down nicely- because he already knew. He already knew he was a terrible, awful person who forces himself on his cousin’s boyfriend and makes his best friend in the world uncomfortable- and he already hated himself so there was no way they didn’t hate him too. </p><p>He had thought about Albus- and Lily- he really had; all the time actually- he had thought about his mom; and dad and how what he was doing right now was in no way fair to any of them. Especially since they had no idea why he was avoiding them and that no matter what he did- he was being an enormous ass. </p><p>But- even that hadn’t been enough to make him go back. </p><p>He had altered his wards- it wouldn’t allow any of them into his house without his express permission- it wouldn’t allow anyone into his house. </p><p>It wasn’t like he hadn’t tried to get over it all- because he had fucking tried- okay? He had thrown himself at bloke after bloke trying to forget the fire that burned in his stomach that night with teddy. But it was never the same- never enough- It never drowned out the need he had to be back in those arms and he fucking hated himself for it. </p><p>He tried to convince himself- for hours- that he could go back. That it would all be okay- and he had almost done it- honestly, he was ready to go- and then he had gone to diagon ally to get his mother a present. </p><p>An -I’m sorry I’ve been such a prick and I’ll stop avoiding you and my problems thank you for still wanting me to be around- present. When he had run into teddy in the shop. </p><p>He had looked tired- haggard. Like he wasn’t getting enough sleep and all James wanted to do was take care of him but that wasn’t his fucking job; and Teddy had a girlfriend for that. </p><p>And he ran away before Teddy could say anything. </p><p>Because apparently that’s what he did now- some fucking Gryffindor he was. </p><p>That had been almost three months ago now- and he was aware of how damn pathetic he was being- but he couldn’t stop hiding out in his apartment- eating single servings of takeaway from his favorite Chinese food place and trying not to cry into his noodles. </p><p>He didn’t need Al here to tell him he was a fucking loser because he already knew. </p><p>He sighed- “I don’t speak for Teddy- or anyone else for that matter. But I’ve been hard pressed to get a day off in months and when I do; I usually spend it cleaning the house or volunteering down at the clinic.” </p><p>He had long since finished school to become a healer- and had been working very closely with Puddlemere United as their on-staff healer. It was true it didn’t leave him much time to do anything but tour with the team- or fix their wounds from practice- but he could have made time- if he wasn’t trying so desperately not to. </p><p>Al knew that. </p><p>He scowled back at him. </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re avoiding Jamie- but I miss you- we all miss you.” He hummed against the bottle. “come home for Christmas, or mum is going to come over here herself and hex you into oblivion.”  </p><p>He nodded back knowing this day had been a long time coming and it was just something he was going to have to do- it could have been worse than Christmas- at least there were a lot of cousins and uncles and aunts there – he could fly under the radar- throw himself into conversations with Molly and Rosie and ignore teddy completely. </p><p>There had even been that time a couple years back when they had gone to France instead of coming to the burrow- he could hope that would be the case again. Though he knew with his luck it wouldn’t be.</p>
