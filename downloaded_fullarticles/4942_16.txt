  <strong>PREFACE:</strong>
</p><p class="western">“<em>Potter, Harry!”</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>A pause. Wide eyes fixed at the front of the room. Nervous anticipation from the staff. Excitement from the students.</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>We’d like to be sorted simultaneously, please.” A gentle demand, but a demand no less, from the black-haired girl who stands even with her black-haired brother at the front of the line of first-year students. They stand in identical poses, hands together in front of their bodies, almost as if at some sort of military rest, their backs and legs tall and straight, not slouching or relaxing, though their faces wear the slightest hint of smiles…or perhaps nervousness. It was impossible to tell.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Er – well – I’m afraid…that simply isn’t possible, Mister and Miss Potter. You see, the Sorting Hat is, well, it is only made for one.” A stutter, confusion, this is not at all what she expected, though she had tried to expect nothing, and it shows. The students are whispering, the staff look nervous, this isn’t going right at all, this isn’t how it’s supposed to happen –</em></p><p class="western">“<em>We insist,” spoken together, firmly, but still politely.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>More confusion. A glance to the head table. The headmaster is frowning, as baffled as she is. She looks back at the two small children in front of her – and aren’t they a little too small for their age?</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>It’s – it’s just impossible! The hat is, you understand, a mind-reading device. That is how it sorts you. It cannot read two minds at once –”</em></p><p class="western">“<em>It won’t need to,” A reassurance from the black-haired boy as they step forward.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>We’ve got this little trick, you see,” says the girl, and together they reach out and pick up the hat, position it so that it just rests on each of their heads by its brim, and close their eyes. Their hands are clasped together between their sides, and the Great Hall is, for the first time, silent as a grave.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Well, if it isn’t – | A cheery greeting. A pause.</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>| Oh. How very interesting indeed. I’ve never done this before. That is certainly a neat trick you have there. | Shock and delight come with understanding; a great sense of being impressed.</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>Thank you.’ The girl thinks.</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>We’ve been able to do it our whole lives,’ explains the boy. ‘Only we didn’t know that it was, you know, magic–’</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>Until just a few weeks ago.’ His sister finished.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Indeed? Well, I’m glad to see you both. Harry and Heather Potter, my goodness – your parents would be very proud about this little plan you’ve laid out in your heads here. Got it all figured out, do you? |</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>We hope so.’</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>Do you think it will work?’</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| I’m sure it will, providing you continue on the way you have been – at least in front of most of your classmates. Merlin’s beard, you even intimidated me! | More shocked impression, a slight sense of vexation. Around them, the hall is still dead silent, no longer with anticipation but with confusion. (The other students are barely breathing. They are all thinking nearly the same thing: “This just doesn’t happen. Who are these children?”)All eyes are on them, just as predicted, just as planned, just as it needed to be.</em>
</p><p class="western"><em>A sincere reply:‘Thank you.’; they don’t get many compliments. Or, at least, they hadn’t </em>before<em>.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Oh…but…what’s this? A – a barrier? A shared barrier? Occlumency – shared Occlumency, and at your age? | Growing fear, growing wonder, growing curiosity, growing concern, for two people no one had ever cared for before their eleventh birthday.</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>A hesitation. The boy finally answers:</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>Apparently.’</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| But...why?| The hat sounds rather hurt, and the children felt badly. The hat was one of the first…well, beings, for want of a better word, that had ever been kind and honest with them.</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>We’d rather not discuss that, sir.’ Heather says gently.</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>It’s private, you see.’</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>We heard about Dumbledore’s habits of peaking into minds and, well…’</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>We thought it would be smart to keep our plans out of his head, for the most part.’ The boy ends the explanation. He hears a cough out among the students, but otherwise continued complete silence.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Well yes, I’ll agree with you there – the old coot does more meddling than is good for him or anyone else, thank Merlin he can’t read me or any of the children I’m currently sorting – but why with me? | The hat is nearly pleading now, and the children rush to reassure him.</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>They’re hard to just put up and down at first, you see…’ the girl says of the Occlumency barriers.</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>And…well…’ her brother cannot finish. She does instead.</em></p><p class="western">‘<em>There are some things we’d rather no one know.’</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Oh. I see. |</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>The hat still sounds hurt, and not a small bit concerned, but concedes.</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>| Hmm, alright then, let’s see here. Oh, this is already the hatstall of the decade. Perhaps the century. Tongues will be wagging. |</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>Good.’ The children think together.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Indeed. Now, you two could easily fit in at any house, but as I’m sure you know by now – |</em>
</p><p class="western">‘<em>You take into account our opinions.’</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>| Yes. And for your plan to work, you can only be in one house. Therefore, I’ll of course have to say – | A deep although unneeded breath that somehow comes through even in thought:</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>SLYTHERIN!” the Sorting Hat cries, and the Potter twins allow smirks as they take the hat down and hand it to Professor McGonagall, who takes it with frozen hands, her eyes unblinking.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>The hall is silent for another moment. Then:</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>What?!” screams a child from one of the tables.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Did I hear that right?” whispers a girl with blue on her robes.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>He’s joking, isn’t he?” says a red-haired Gryffindor boy.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>First the Longbottom kid and now this?” an older student cries.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>The hall is chaos; half the student body is too stunned to speak, some are whispering or talking urgently to one another, and a few are outright yelling. The staff itself is not much better, either wide-eyed and silent or speaking urgently to one another.</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>Pardon me?” the deputy headmistress manages, looking at the old hat in her hands as she raises it to eye level.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Slytherin, Minerva. I said Slytherin and that’s what I meant.” The hat says rather defensively.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>But – but these are the Potter children!” is all Professor McGonagall can managed to sputter out.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Yes, and they belong in Slytherin house,” says the hat loudly over the chaos. The students quiet a bit.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Dear Hat, are you certain–?” a soft, seemingly kind voice intones from the head of the staff table, and the hat interrupts him.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>I am an expert at sorting, Albus. I have been doing it for hundreds of years. I haven’t been wrong before.” The hat says haughtily.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>I suppose not…” the headmaster concedes, looking, for once, at a loss for what to do.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Well…very well, then…You two may–” Professor McGonagall began, but the two Potter siblings were already across the hall and making room for themselves at the silver and green Slytherin table.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>And by making room, I mean that they were shoving students out of the way to make spots for themselves in the very middle.</em>
</p><p class="western">“<em>OOF!” Marcus Flint cries as he’s shoved off his bench, followed by Selene Davis, who cries,“Hey!”</em></p><p class="western">“<em>What?!” says another student, and yet another adds,“Hey firstie, who do you think you are?” as Harry and Heather Potter sit down at the exact middle of the Slytherin table. Marcus Flint stands, looking ready to hit them.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Your kind doesn’t come to the middle of the table, and they don’t push us around!” he says, and Heather waves her hand through the air in a short swipe that makes Flint stagger backwards. Everyone is silent in the hall again.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>New rule,” Harry says, grinning.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>We sit here now,” adds his sister.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>But you can sit </em>by<em> us, if you want.” Harry smirks as he speaks, and heads turn from the Potter twins to the once-king of Slytherin house, Marcus Flint.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>A pause…then Flint stomps to the other end of the table, followed by Selene and several others.</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>The Potter twins nod.“That’s better.”</em>
</p><p class="western">…</p><p class="western">“<em>Apparently the school has some new rulers on its hands, Severus…” says Professor Vector at the front of the room, her brown eyes still wide from the shock of everything she had just seen. Even after a rather unexpected letter she had received little more than a month prior, she still hadn’t quite been expecting such a thing.</em></p><p class="western">“<em>Yes, Septima, and I don’t think they are the kind to be trifled with…” says Professor Snape, impressed enough by the actions of the two children to allow a slight smirk.</em></p><p class="western">
  <em>At the Slytherin table, Harry and Heather Potter smile with satisfaction at the duly impressed looks on the faces around them, and then they return their attention to the front.</em>
</p><p class="western">
  <em>They have to listen carefully and watch closely now. After all, they have an army to build and a school full of children to protect.</em>
