          <div class="userstuff"><p>No one at the Daily Prophet wanted to be the one to tell Rita Skeeter that her column was being cancelled and that essentially she was out of a job, so no one did. They sent her a letter instead.</p><p>She received a letter and was given two hours to vacate her office. She handed the editor a resignation letter of her own and walked out of the building head held high and plans for an incriminating book about the paper already forming.</p><p><br/>

She was sitting in a Muggle café in Manchester when she saw the advertisement. She couldn’t help but admire the cheek it took to post an advert for a magazine writer in a rival newspaper. It was something only Luna Lovegood would dare to do.</p><p>“The Quibbler. Now there’s a thought.” she muttered. She threw a handful of coins on the table, rolled up the paper, tucked it into her bag and walked out of the café.</p><p>She wrote her application in her flat. She paced up and down as she dictated to her Quick-Quotes Quill. “I have worked at a number of respectable publications- why’ve you stopped? They are respectable!”</p><p><br/>

“Hello Ms Skeeter.” Luna looked up from her desk and smiled.</p><p>“Ms Lovegood.” Rita sat down.</p><p>“How do you feel about Hoverbadles?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Illegal Animagi.” Luna smiled innocently.</p><p>Rita froze.</p><p>“I think we’ll be looking elsewhere. Thank you for your time.”</p><p><br/>

The Life and Death of Lord Voldemort: Cults, Killings and Crucio was an absolute flop.</p><p>As one reviewer put it: Why she expects us to spend money to be reminded of what we are trying to forget, I do not know.</p><p><br/>
-</p><p><br/>
Quote, Columns and Lies: the shocking untold truth of Rita Skeeter by Harry Potter was not a flop. In fact, it topped the bestseller list for seven months.</p><p><br/>
-</p><p><br/>
In retaliation, Rita published Harry Potter: Deadly and Dangerous. 26 copies sold.</p><p><br/>
-</p><p>By a combination of unfortunate circumstances, the editor of Witch Weekly was forced to resign. There was a scandal over the payments Gilderoy Lockhart was discovered to have paid the magazine each year he won Best Smile Award and a nasty incident involving a beetle in someone’s soup in the cafeteria.</p><p>The magazine was left without an editor for a month but the deputy editor managed to keep things going until Rita took over after having successfully applied for the job. It wouldn’t have been her first choice of workplace but it payed well and did her reputation good after she managed to up sales slightly, run a good series on the Ministry’s new décor and a popular series on international wizarding food.</p><p>There was only one small problem with the job.</p><p>It was very, very boring.</p><p><br/>

Rita was leafing through the Daily Prophet one morning, looking for a catchy story she could pull from one of the smaller columnists, when she came across an advert that covered one of the pages. It was dark blue, flashed and contained a number of images of smiling, waving children.</p><p>It was an advert for a teaching post at Hogwarts. Rita gave it a closer look. She’d never thought about being a teacher before. She’d been to Hogwarts, of course, but had spent more time gossiping and trying to set people up then actually working, and consequently did rather poorly at her OWLS. It hadn’t made for the greatest start to her CV, but children were terribly interesting to work with. In fact, she could do a wonderful investigative undercover journalism piece if she spent a year working at Hogwarts. It couldn’t be too hard to be a magical history teacher, could it?</p><p><br/>

It had been a long time since she had last been to Hogwarts. Fortunately for Rita, Hermione Granger had long since left the school and moved onto a promising career at the Ministry. Apparently, the school had changed rather a lot under the leadership of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall and Rita was very interested to find out just what had been affected.</p><p>When Rita arrived at the grounds, one of the first things she noticed was the number of new buildings and the amount of repair work that had been done. She’s expected to see some, as much of the castle had been damaged or destroyed during the Battle of Hogwarts, but three new towers was something else entirely. One of the teachers came to meet her at the gates.</p><p>“Hello Ms Skeeter.” the woman tipped up the brim of her hat- which was decorated with a tartan ribbon- and smiled for a small moment before pressing her lips together tightly. “You’re four minutes late.”</p><p>Rita gulped. “Hello Minerva. It’s lovely to see you again.”</p><p>McGonagall’s gaze narrowed and she said in a charming tone, “I wish I could say the same.”</p><p><br/>

Undercover Hogwarts Interview Scoop by Rita Skeeter</p><p>On Tuesday the 18th of February I went to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for an undercover interview for the post of magical history teacher.</p><p>“Oh look, Ginny. Rita went back to Hogwarts.” Harry picked up the paper from the kitchen table and showed it to her.</p><p>“Neville told me about that.” Ginny said. “Said that she’d shown up. Didn’t say anything about a disguise though.”</p><p>“Hang on. It doesn’t say anything about disguises here either. How can I be undercover if you don’t have a disguise?” Harry wondered. “Oh, hello. She submitted her application under a fake name but went to the interview as herself. Apparently she was treated with ‘great contempt and dislike that shock me to my core’.”</p><p>They laughed.</p><p>Harry read out the next sentence. “’Things only improved from there.’ Oh dear, I hope she didn’t get the job.”</p><p>“She didn’t. Why on earth would they give it to her? The governors would have a fit.”</p><p>“Things improved because she was given a tour of the school by a student who read her old columns and thinks they’re brilliant. Then she didn’t get the job and she writes a scathing report of it and is sticking to her job at Witch Weekly.” Harry paused. “Next week there’s an article on my affair with Ron.”</p><p>“I’ll frame it.”</p><p>She did.</p></div>
