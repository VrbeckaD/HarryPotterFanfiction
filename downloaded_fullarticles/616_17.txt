  <strong> <u>Chapter 1/Intro</u> </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I always thought it was funny how people talked about the end of the world. Most seemed to be leaning towards a natural disaster, caused by "God" or mankind, a food shortage, due to overpopulation, or even a comet hitting the Earth. Not once did anyone think that the dead would come back and start eating people?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Even now, no one seems to know where it started or what's causing it, due to how quickly it spread. Some think this is the final judgment, and God is punishing everyone that is unworthy. Others just think it is similar to a cold. That the people are not dead, they just need time and medication.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Personally, I think it is a virus. That somehow after you die it restarts the brain, to an extent. I don't really know the technical mumbo jumbo, nor do I care. Right now, all I do know is that it is a fight or die world, and I refuse to let someone, or something, get my friends or me.</em>

  <em>When it first appeared in Ohio* we were told to stay inside and to not leave until we had to. So that is where we stayed. After the first few days we realized that whatever this was, it was not going to end quickly. We started planning on what we wanted to do. We ended up going to one of those big chain stores that have everything and stocking up on items that everyone overlooked. We grabbed the seed packets, any medication that was left, all types of clothes, and personal items, manly the women kind. The plan was if worst came to pass, we would get out of town before the roads got blocked. Then, find someplace that we could secure, or already was.</em>

  <em>When we were told to start heading towards the nearest school, that the army was there to keep us safe, and could provide us with food and shelter, one of our group members stated that it would be a risk. With everyone being in one location, all it would take was for someone to get infected for the whole thing to go up in smoke. Eventually, from what we heard, that happened. Someone was infected and during the night they died. They came back turned and started to bite a bunch of people. Before anyone realized what was happening most of the camp ended up becoming infected. The soldiers that were left killed all of them, and when they tried to get their next orders there was no answer.</em>

  <em>It seemed that the government had crumbled and with people not knowing what to do, it became a free for all. Hell, on Earth. With no one to stop them, crimes were being committed everywhere. However, it wasn't until the hordes started moving towards the sound of chaos that people really started to die. The undead never seemed to be by themselves, there was always at least one with another, and while they weren't that fast, they were extremely quiet, capable of being on you before you knew it.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It was at this point we packed only the essential items and headed out. We were driving for a couple of weeks, looking for any place we could fortify, against the dead, and filling up when we could. We eventually run out of gas and started to walk.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>While on the move we eventually found a map and decided to start making our way down south, towards Tennessee. After a month all power, running water, and sewage stopped working. It was now the dark ages again, and it seemed that the dead were the new top dogs. They never slept and it seemed that they did not need to eat to keep going. And, the only way to kill them completely was damage to the brain.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Now two months in, and almost out of food, the five of us realized that this was now our life. No one was going to come to help us, and if we wanted to see the next day, we had to learn how to fight to live. We had to be smart and there was no way we were the last ones alive, and if humanity was to continue the ones who were left would have to learn how to survive in this new world.</em>
