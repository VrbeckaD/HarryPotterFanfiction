"You remind me of the sun."</p><p>Remus Lupin looked up to raise an eyebrow at his boyfriend. "Er, why?"</p><p>"Hot."</p><p>"Huh." Remus shrugged and then looked back down at his book. "I can live with that."</p><p>Their friend James then turned to his girlfriend. "What do I remind you of, Lils?"</p><p>She smirked and without missing a beat, she said, "A garbage can."</p><p>"...um." He made a face. "Why?"</p><p>"Because you're trash."</p><p>"Why are we even dating?" James asked dramatically. </p><p>"One man's trash is another man's treasure," Lily reminded him. </p><p>"Aw, that's kinda sweet..." He felt a little bit better.</p><p>"But I never said I was the other man."</p><p>"Damn, Evans!" Sirius interrupted. "Savage! When did you become such a sass queen?"</p><p>She smirked again. "It's just a gift." And of course she loved her boyfriend.</p></div>
