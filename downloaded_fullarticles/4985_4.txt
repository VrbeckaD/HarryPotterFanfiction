          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry still had nightmares after the war. Everyone thought it was strange and unnatural, but after everything he'd been through, it was only expected. </p><p>He'd done so much, bad things and good, and so had the one he'd gone and fallen in love with:</p><p>Draco Malfoy. </p><p>It was 11:48pm, and there was a loud crash as Harry flooed to Draco's apartment. The brunette was crying, and Draco found him on the floor, in tears. </p><p>Draco picked to boy up, who was surprisingly light, and carried him into his room, and placed him on his bed. </p><p>"Harry? Was it the nightmares?"</p><p>He only nodded. They were both in pyjamas, and so Draco put the covers over Harry and himself, and cuddled the boy, who was beginning to stop crying.</p><p>"Dray?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"S... Sing me a song..."</p><p>"Okay"</p><p>"Thanks"</p><p>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine"</p><p>Draco's voice filled the air, and comforted Harry. </p><p>"You keep me happy when skies are grey."</p><p>His voice was almost becoming a sentient being, and felt like it was hugging Harry. </p><p>"You'll never know, dear, how much I love you." </p><p>Harry had stopped crying, and was almost smiling by this point. </p><p>"Please don't take my sunshine away..."</p><p>Draco's voice trailed off, leaving the room in a silence that was familiar to them both. Harry had drifted off to sleep, and the blonde was beginning to as well. </p><p>That night was the night Draco knew he needs Harry, and vice versa, and was the night that Draco promised to protect Harry no matter what.</p></div>
