<p>The fact that it was raining in London was not unusual. But the air was sticky, hotter than the usual September chill. The muggy temperatures did little for Lily’s mood, and remembering why she wasn’t excited to be returning to Hogwarts this year only made her mood darken further. </p>
<p>Last year, she’d been walking into King’s Cross with her best friend, her parents, still healthy and free of worry, and her sister had at least been trying to pretend that she would miss her. Everything was different now. She’d said good-bye to Severus in June after forcing her hand. She could still hear the way he’d spat out ‘mudblood’ for the entire school to hear. There had been so much loathing in his voice, so much contempt, as though she was little more than gum under his shoe. Which, she supposed, she was all along. </p>
<p>And her parents were different too. Her father, sick--dying, and her mother trying valiantly to pretend as though everything was, and would be, fine. Lily had hoped that now that she was rid of Sev, that she and Petunia might actually become closer again. But her sister was as spiteful as ever, blaming Lily for their father’s illness, as though with all her magic, she might be able to cure him. Not that Lily didn’t think Petunia had a point; but she wished that Tuney hadn’t figured out that magic might be the answer. That Lily wouldn’t have to admit her failure to anyone but herself if she never found a cure.</p>
<p>And not even Hogwarts could offer any solace this year. Lily had spent all summer avoiding Severus by hanging out with her old muggle primary school mates. Now she was doomed to have just about every class with her former friend. And she would have to endure taunts from everyone who had always told her he was bad news. And her friends. She’d ignored them for most of the summer, being extremely vague in her letters when she bothered to respond. Lily was under no illusion that she had some making up to do. </p>
<p>So really, what business did she have in resenting the rain beating down as she and her family trekked across the carpark? It was only a fraction of what she deserved after all. And as she reached that conclusion, Lily pulled the umbrella from her head, letting the rain pelt down her thick, auburn hair. It almost felt <em> good </em>. She lifted her face to the sky and shut her eyes, anyone watching just now would think she was a silly girl, delighting in a bit of rain. Really though, it was self penance. </p>
<p>“Lily Jade,” her mother’s voice forced Lily’s eyes wide open and she lowered her head to look at her mum. “You’ll catch a chill before term even starts!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know, mum,” Petunia cut in dryly, “<em> Her </em> sort don’t get our illnesses.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                That stung. It was meant to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dutifully, Lily placed her bright yellow umbrella back over her head, mumbling an apology. Petunia was right, of course. Magic folk didn’t get muggle illnesses. They did get sick, but of a more magical strain. Lily had never had a cold in her life, not until she was locked in a school with hundreds of other wizards and witches just like her. It didn’t seem fair that there was a whole population of people who would never know the pain of something like lymphoma. Would never succumb to any kind of muggle epidemic. </p>
<p>They reached the inside of the station, Lily’s dad whistling merrily, pretending that he wasn’t exhausted from hauling Lily’s trunk. He’d insisted on carrying it. Like he always had every year, but Lily could see that he was tired. He got tired a lot. </p>
<p>It took some time to find a trolley, but before too long, the Evans Family was walking through Platform 9 ¾ , and an incredible thing happened. For the first time in what felt like ages, Lily felt her spirits rise a little. The screeching owls and mewling cats were all too familiar. Everywhere, parents were hugging and kissing their kids goodbye, and fellow students were greeting each other across the platform. Ahead, white steam was billowing from the gleaming, scarlet train.  </p>
<p>“I’m going to put my stuff on the train and I’ll be right back!” Lily said, gathering her things and almost rushing towards the train. She heard a few people call her name, and she smiled and waved in response before boarding. </p>
<p>It didn’t take long to reach the compartment she knew her friends would be in. Mary MacDonald’s parents worked in London and had always dropped her off early so they could get to work. Mary had been reserving their compartment since second year. And Lily grinned upon seeing the familiar, elaborate handwriting on a strip of parchment tapped to the glass. </p>
<p>The compartment was empty, save for Mary’s trunk already stowed up top. Lily opened her own trunk and fished out her scarlet and gold Prefect’s badge, slipping into the pocket of the leather jacket she’d stolen from her dad. Then, closing her trunk, Lily hoisted it onto the luggage rack next to Mary’s, and went back onto the platform, wondering where exactly Mary had gotten to. </p>
<p>Her father looked to be enjoying himself immensely, and Lily thought he looked almost healthy. Seeing him like that gave her hope. Her mum looked half relieved to see Lily, and half annoyed, and judging by the look on Petunia’s face, the two of them had been bickering about something only moments before. Lily decided she didn’t want to ask.</p>
<p>“I think it’s time for a family picture!” her dad’s voice seemed to boom, as though being surrounded by all the magical hustle and bustle had breathed new life into him. When nothing all summer had been able to. Petunia looked even more irritated at the prospect, and Lily felt her mood sink again. Their father was dying. Couldn’t her sister see that there were few chances to capture total family moments. This wasn’t about Lily and her going off to another year of her special school so much as preserving what little time the Evans family had. </p>
<p>Daisy Evans gave her daughter a nudge, and Petunia began shaking off her gloomy expression. Lily took the camera her father had pulled out of his jacket and scanned the crowd for a friendly face who could snap a photo. She spotted Remus Lupin with his parents, who were in conversation with Peter Pettigrew and his mum. </p>
<p>“Oi! Lupin!” Lily gave a shout, and as Remus turned, Lily beckoned him over. </p>
<p>“Lily dear, there is no need to shout,” her mother chided. Lily ignored her. </p>
<p>“Mum, dad, Petunia, this is Remus Lupin,” Lily said as Remus joined them. He looked extremely ill. Nothing new there, but he looked more worn out than usual. “He’s in my year and is prefect with me.”</p>
<p>“Lovely to meet you, Remus!” her dad threw out his hand for Remus to shake. “Call me Greg, I will have absolutely no ‘Mr Evans’ from my daughter’s classmates!”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, er, Greg.” Remus shook his hand before extending it to Daisy and Petunia. “Mrs Evans, Petunia, nice to meet you both.” </p>
<p>Petunia was eyeing Remus with a look of forced politeness. Lily could tell that her sister was judging him by his tired expression. </p>
<p>“We were wondering, Remus,” Lily said. “Could you get  photo of us?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah sure!” Remus seemed to be forcing enthusiasm. He looked <em> so ill </em>. Worse than Lily’s dad had looked all summer.</p>
<p>The Evanses all posed, Lily’s dad resting a hand on her shoulder proudly, while draping his other arm across his wife’s shoulder. Lily and Petunia put their arms around each other, and everyone put on their most glowing smiles. As the camera snapped, they were almost the picture perfect family that Lily had always maintained they were at school. </p>
<p>“Thanks, Remus! I’ll see you at the meeting!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, later, Lily. Nice meeting you all,” he nodded to Lily’s family and went back to join his group. </p>
<p>The train blew its horn, signaling it was time for students to start getting on the train. Suddenly Lily felt a wave of anxiety course through her. There was no avoiding it now, soon she would have to face everyone she had been avoiding all break. She’d been living in a bubble the past eight weeks, pretending she didn’t live in a world where her kind was being hunted, a world where she didn’t have to be perfect. Now it was back to it. And who knew if she was ever going to see her dad again? And if she did, how much worse would he look.</p>
<p>Lily embraced her mother, who was suddenly teary eyed, and briefly hugged Petunia, who looked relieved that she would soon be away from all the freaks. Last, Lily practically lurched towards her dad, arms wrapped around him tight. She would not cry. She was determined not to. She felt her father’s arms wrap around her and he leaned down to whisper in her ear, “Study hard, Li. Nothing is more important than your education. Make me proud. Make yourself proud.”</p>
<p>The tears threatened again and Lily blinked rapidly, pulling away from the embrace, nodding. </p>
<p>“Promise, Li,” he said with mock sternness.</p>
<p>“I promise dad. I’ll see you all at Christmas! Love you!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And with a final wave, she boarded the train with the others.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter and Remus had snagged a compartment at the very end of the train, and James, exhausted from hauling both his trunk and his owl, Persephone, was more than relieved to finally have a place to sit down. Unfortunately Sirius, who had only woken up five minutes before the train was supposed to leave, was now fully awake. </p>
<p>“Where’s Moony?” he asked, looking eager. “Full moon’s in a week, we need to plan our adventure.”</p>
<p>“He’s in the prefect’s meeting,” Peter said, stroking Persephone in greeting. </p>
<p>“Here is probably <em> not </em> the best place to plan either, Padfoot,” said James. “Too many people will be coming round to say ‘hello’. No privacy at all. </p>
<p>“We can just tell anyone who comes round to ‘bugger off’,” Sirius protested.</p>
<p>“No we can’t,” James ruffled his hair. “Now’s the best chance to find out who the other captains are for Quidditch. They’ll be dying to come ‘round and show off. And I can start strategizing.” </p>
<p>“Like you haven’t already,” said Peter. “You’ve been making diagrams since third year.”</p>
<p>“I had to start planning, only an insane person would’ve denied me the captainship.” </p>
<p>“Ever the humble one,” Sirius muttered, eyes on the compartment right across from them. “Hey, Wormtail, did you pick this compartment just so you could ogle at Ayisha Zhu all day?” </p>
<p>Peter blushed, and James straightened up to look. In the compartment across, sat Gryffindors Marlene McKinnion and Mary MacDonald, and Ravenclaw Ayisha Zhu. Which meant for certain that Lily Evans would be joining them too, as well as Hufflepuff’s Melanie Ross. </p>
<p>“She’s way outta your league, mate,” Sirius was saying.</p>
<p>“Shut it.”</p>
<p>“She’s way out of everyone’s league,” James interjected. “She’s been with Dev Bakshi since third year.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t mean I can’t look,” Peter insisted. “She’s well fit.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, she is,” Sirius agreed. “MacDonald’s looking fit too.”</p>
<p>“I thought she just looked sad. I think she’s still hung up about the Mulciber thing.”</p>
<p>“‘The Mulciber Thing’ was an attack with dark magic, Pete,” James sat back, determined to not care about girls this year. “Seems like she has good reason to be upset.”</p>
<p>“Still it’s been, what? Six months? Seven?”</p>
<p>James only shrugged. He couldn’t quite remember when it had happened, only that it had just a few weeks before Sirius sento Snape down the Whomping Willow. MacDonald had been pretty tight-lipped about her ordeal, and the only reason anyone seemed to know that Mulciber was behind it, was because some of his Slytherin mates had dropped just enough hints. Enough for the students to know he was dangerous, but evidently not enough for professors to punish him. Clever git. </p>
<p>“Sometimes it takes a while for people to get over things,” Sirius was saying. “I think Moony is still a bit miffed about what I did to Snivellous.”</p>
<p>“There’s a shocker,” said James dryly. He wasn’t quite in the mood to discuss this topic. Not again. </p>
<p>Sirius had been through a lot this summer. He’d been a right mess when he’d left Grimmauld Place in July for Godric’s Hollow. James had never seen his best mate looking so scared. And kind of...<em> fragile </em>. Besides James, only Fleamont and Euphmina Potter knew just how bad Sirius had looked when he’d moved in with them. Remus and Peter knew some, but not enough. And as bad as it was, as bad as James felt for Sirius, he did not agree that this turn of events meant that he had somehow paid for almost making Remus a murderer. Though Sirius had been put out by Remus’ sometimes very cold reception to him all summer. </p>
<p>The thing was, Sirius had never really apologized. And James knew he wasn’t truly sorry for it. That deep down, he still thought Snape deserved it. And maybe he did deserve something, hanging around all those wannabe Death Eaters, and using dark curses on people; but Remus didn’t deserve that. The “prank” had, James feared, forever altered their group dynamic. Thing was, Sirius didn’t seem to see it. He still thought things could return to normal. Or maybe he just didn’t care. James had been trying to decide which was worse. </p>
<p>That was just one of the things that had been making him anxious over the last couple months. On top of feeling like he needed to keep his mates together, that maybe he was the only thing doing it now; the war was getting more brutal. For weeks the words, “<em> You’re just as bad as he is! </em> ” floated around in his mind, keeping him up. Had he truly been as bad as Snivelly? James had decided to take a closer look at himself, at the people around him, after that. He’d been shocked at how many of his parent’s friends displayed anti-muggle sentiments. Nothing outrageous, all of it was subtle. But James had never before <em> noticed </em> it as bad. And then he realized just how many attacks were happening now, how easy it would be for someone like him to step back and remain unscathed. And he realized, as he thought about how many people he and Sirius had picked on, that his actions were not that different from what he was seeing on the outside. Sure, he wasn’t one for dark magic, but how many people actually deserved what he was throwing at them? Lily Evans had had a point. And it kind of made him hate himself. And her, for pointing it out. Still, he wanted to prove her wrong. He could be better. He had to. Sirius needed him, Remus would need him, Peter would need him. </p>
<p>Unfortunately while many sixth years were rejoicing in the fact that O.W.Ls were over, James was realising just how soon he and his mates would leave the safety of the school for a world that would not treat all of them with respect. It didn’t seem fair, he thought as he looked over at Sirius and Peter who had taken up a game of exploding snap, but then, that just seemed to be how life was. </p>
<p>Remus wasn’t released from the prison that was prefect duties until after noon, and after the lunch trolley had gone around. But he came into the compartment looking tired, and James heard a peal of laughter coming from the girl’s compartment across. And then he heard her saying goodbye to Remus. And then he saw her. And his mouth went dry, a hand reaching up to rumple his hair. And before he could stop himself, he found himself saying:</p>
<p>“Alright, Evans?” He could feel his mated groaning internally. </p>
<p>Lily paused, the door to her compartment half open. She looked a little surprised at his greeting, but she didn’t look angry. More like she was considering whether to respond or not.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said. “You?”</p>
<p>James grinned, hand back in his hair. “Alright.”</p>
<p>“Well, alright then,” and she went to join her friends, where James could hear McKinnion shouting something about Lily Evans not sending enough letters over the summer.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know, I know,” Lily sounded slightly exasperated, but she was careful to keep a note of playfulness in her voice. “I was dreadful at writing this summer, and--” she silenced Ayisha before she could speak. “At meeting up--”</p>
<p>“We didn’t see you <em> at all </em>this summer, Lily,” Ayisha Zhu finally got a word in. “We missed you!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! Family life has just been a little crazy, what with Petunia starting her new job in London. We had to move her down there. And my dad was a bit poorly, so we kept things quiet.” <em> A bit poorly </em> was a massive understatement. But Lily wasn’t ready to share with her friends that her dad was dying. Saying so made it real. And she didn’t want to deal with the pity. She would tell them. Just not now. “Besides, we’re going to have months where it’s just us now that term’s started!”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but I’m still mad at you!” Marlene pouted. Her way of saying all was forgiven. Lily noticed that Mary hadn’t even said anything beyond a ‘hello’. </p>
<p>“My summer was rubbish,” Lily went on. “But your hair is pink, Mar!” </p>
<p>“Oh this?” Marlene ran a hand through her many braids, as though she were waiting for comment. “It’s just a simple charm. Tomorrow, hopefully, it’ll be Gryffindor red and gold. McGonagall is going to freak.”</p>
<p>“She’ll give you detention,” Ayisha giggled. </p>
<p>“Me? Getting a detention before Potter or Black? If it happens you all better get me some kind of medal.”</p>
<p>“Done,” Lily smiled. It was easy to pretend that everything was Just Fine, when at least with her friends, things seemed to be. Or at least, for most of them. </p>
<p>Lily had thought the summer might be good for Mary, a chance for her to get away from what happened to her last term. But her eyes held none of their usual sparkle, and Lily knew she wasn’t the only one who’d spent the summer lost. </p>
<p>“So how were your O.W.L. results?” Ayisha looked around the room. She’d obviously been waiting all morning to ask, when they were all together. And without waiting for answers, she jumped into sharing hers. “Obviously I was expecting O’s in Arithmancy and Runes. But I didn’t think it was possible to pull one off in Divination, or Defense. And well, I <em> guess </em> I didn’t do it in Defense, but and E is perfectly fine. I was dreadful in potions, but thanks for trying to help anyway, Lily.”</p>
<p>Of course, Ayisha was always going to do well in exams. She thrived when it came to them. Her classwork might not be the best, but with the pressure on, she seemed to soar. Marlene got a mixture of A’s and E’s in most classes, with O’s in Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. Lily had done better than she’d expected, given her falling out with Severus right in the middle of exams. O’s in everything except Transfiguration: an E. “I think I’ll be dropping Divination though,” she was saying. “I don’t much like the idea of knowing my future. Not like that, anyway.” </p>
<p>They all turned to Mary. She was silent for a long time, took a breath, then shut her mouth and looked out the window.</p>
<p>“Mary?” Ayisha prompted. </p>
<p>A deep breath. “It’s just…” and then she burst into tears. </p>
<p>“Mary!” both Lily and Marlene leapt to their feet to go and comfort their friend. </p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Ayisha asked. </p>
<p>“It’s just....I f-failed e-everything!”</p>
<p>Lily didn’t believe that for a second. Mary had had a trying year, but it just seemed impossible that she’d managed to fail all of her O.W.L.s, and judging by the looks from Marlene and Ayisha, they didn’t quite believe it either.</p>
<p>“You can’t have failed everything,” Marlene said soothingly. </p>
<p>“Everything important! I got D’s in Defense, Potions, and Transfiguration! Who is going to give a job with scores that bad?”</p>
<p>“There are plenty of Ministry jobs, Mary,” Ayisha insisted. “And other things in the private realm. I know it can sometimes feel like the world revolves around those three fields, but there’s so much out there. You can talk to Mcgonagall all about it, I’m sure.” </p>
<p>It took a while to calm Mary down. She kept going on about how stupid she felt, and how hard it had been to focus after everything. Lily couldn’t fault her for that. McGonagall had even asked them all to keep an extra eye on Mary after her attack, in case she tried to hurt herself. But it seemed Mary had tried to internalize everything, and she’d dealt with the cost in her exams. In truth, Lily felt like a bit of a failure herself in the friend department. How had she not seen how bad things were for her friend? She could’ve done more. </p>
<p>“Lily?” Mary turned still watery eyes on her friend. “Please tell me you, er, didn’t make up with Severus over the summer. Please.</p>
<p>Lily felt almost like she had been punched. That’s what hearing his name did to her. She shook her head. “There’s no chance of that. I know what he is now, I promise.” </p>
<p>What he was was pain. He’d wrung Lily dry for years. Taking and taking, never giving. Always, the whole time thinking her less than human. Always making her feel bad for having other friends. Severus Snape had been a lot of things. But he was never a good friend; and it had taken Lily years to see what everyone else had. </p>
<p>“Good,” Mary hiccuped. “Because I j-just couldn’t bear to see you friends with him. Not when he’s friends with scum like that. W-what if he’d let them h-hurt you?”</p>
<p><em> He already has. In so many ways </em>. “He can’t hurt me, Mary. And I won’t let him hurt you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It didn’t take long for people to realise that some of the coolest people were at the back of the train this year, and soon people began dropping by to say hello and catch up with old news. In years past, James as thought the attention he and his mates got was substantial, but he’d been terribly mistaken. Most of the people who came down their way only dropped in for a few minutes. But the compartment across seemed to soon have a never ending flow of people dropping in, staying for a while, before reluctantly leaving, as though they knew they had to make room for other people coming by. Sirius seemed rather put off by it. </p>
<p>“What is it with people this year? You’d think they would want to hear all about how I’m independent or whatever. Free from parents.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought we were cooler than this,” Peter seemed more put out by the fact that Ayisha Zhu had now been joined by her long-term boyfriend and his crew than anything else. </p>
<p>“You are cool,” Remus and James were playing a round of exploding snap. “That’s kind of the problem.”</p>
<p>“The fuck does that mean?” Sirius looked confused. As though he could not fathom a world where being cool was a disadvantage. </p>
<p>“You and James are the kind of cool that’s almost untouchable--”</p>
<p>“What about me?” Peter huffed. </p>
<p>“You’re not what they are,” Remus shrugged. “Neither am I.”</p>
<p>“And what are we, Moony?” James raised a brow. </p>
<p>“Rich, purebloods with a good family name. And you two don’t exactly welcome people into our little club. People will talk to me and Wormtail, but the second you two pop up, it’s like they’re being kicked out of a very exclusive club.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like we can just invite anyone in, Moony,” James frowned. “We’re protecting you.”</p>
<p>“I know that, but they don’t. To them, you two just seem like you think you’re better than everyone else. People admire you, laugh with you. But they can’t get close to you.”</p>
<p>Sirius seemed bothered by this observation for only a moment, but then looked pensively at the compartment across. “So what is it about all those birds that has people eating out of the palm of their hands?”</p>
<p>“Lily’s cooler than you, Sirius,” Remus said flatly. James and Sirius sputtered and Peter looked even more confused. All three of them turned to look over where Lily Evans was just barely visible. And sure enough, while everyone in that compartment seemed to be engaging with one another, it really looked as though Lily was holding the attention. Weird thing was, she didn’t even appear to be speaking at the moment. Just...listening to some bloke as he told a story. Listening like what she was hearing was the most fascinating thing she’d ever heard.</p>
<p>“She? Cooler than us? Sirius scoffed. “You’re talking about the same Lily Evans who was friends with Snivellous? I mean yeah, she’s fit, but she’s a priss.”</p>
<p>“She’s not,” Remus said dryly. “She’s nice to people, Padfoot. Pays attention to them, remembers their names. That’s why she was picked for Prefect over Mary. She’s nice in a way that you know isn’t an act. And she’s actually er, approachable.” </p>
<p>“Then how come we’ve never noticed how bloody popular she is before?”</p>
<p>But James had. All last year, all those times he thought about asking her out, he’d lost his nerve because everywhere she went, someone seemed to call her friend. The one time he’d managed it was when he’d felt invincible, with the crowd paying attention to his every word. When he’d had her friend hanging upside down. </p>
<p>“Because you only seemed to notice her when she was with Snape,” Remus shrugged. The card deck exploded, and the party across from them flinched, some of them screamed in surprise. </p>
<p>“Bloody hell!” James took a look at his fingers. Burned.. “The fuck kind of deck was that?”</p>
<p>The door to their compartment slid open, “Everything alright?” </p>
<p>All four boys looked up to find Caradoc Dearborn, seventh year Hufflepuff, peering down at them. And everyone sitting in The Lily Evans Fan Club Compartment craning their necks to get a look. </p>
<p>“Just playing with an unstable deck,” Remus actually looked like he was going to laugh. James noticed that his nose looked a little singed too.</p>
<p>“Those burns don’t look good,” Dearborn said. </p>
<p>“Someone’s burned?” a voice called. “Hang on, I’ve got something for that!”</p>
<p>“Uh-er, no need!” James called back. “All good here.” </p>
<p>Whomever had spoken had evidently not heard them, because James could hear a trunk being pulled down from a shelf. He just sat on the floor awkwardly. And then he noticed it. </p>
<p>“Dearborn, is that a Captain’s badge?”</p>
<p>“Course it is. We can’t all make Captain in fifth year like you can, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Brilliant,” he grinned. “It’s about time Hufflepuff had a decent player leading the team.”</p>
<p>“Cheers mate.” </p>
<p>“Whose got burns?” Lily Evans had wandered over, holding a small tin case in one hand, looking quizzically down at the group. James noticed, with an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of his stomach, that she was wearing a skirt. One that definitely did not at all in any way, hide her legs.</p>
<p>“These idiots were playing with an expired Exploding Snap deck, Lily,” Dearborn grinned. For one dreadful moment, James wondered if those two had gotten back together and that’s why Dearborn was down this way. But he felt that sort of gossip would’ve been spread around rapidly if it were the case. </p>
<p>“Here let me see,” Lily knelt down on the floor, a hand extended for James to offer up his burned fingers. </p>
<p>“Er, what is that?” He didn’t move, his eyes just focusing on the tin container.</p>
<p>“Burn ointment, obviously.”</p>
<p>“And you just happen to carry around burn ointment, Evans?” Sirius said it with an air of rudeness. </p>
<p>“When you burn yourself as much as I do, yes,” she shrugged, as though she hadn’t heard Sirius’s hostility. “Are you going to let me help or not, Potter?” </p>
<p>“Wha--oh, er, sure,” he extended his hands, wondering why on earth she was being so pleasant to him. It didn’t make any sense whatsoever. The last time they’d really spoken was during the O.W.L. exams, and it had been a disaster. She hated him. </p>
<p>“What’s in that?” Peter leaned forward, plants and potions always being an interest to him.</p>
<p>“Mostly lavender,” Lily unscrewed the cap and scooped some of the ointment onto her fingers. James could smell the lavender, and something...sterile? “Some aloe vera, and ashwinder eggs.”</p>
<p>“What do the ashwinder eggs do?”</p>
<p>“Mostly they just increase the potency of what’s already in here. It was my mum’s concoction originally, but I started tinkering with it a few years ago.”</p>
<p>Lily, for her part, was feeling just as awkward as James. She was acutely aware of Sirius Blacks occasional hostile glares--they’d never gotten along, to the point where it was almost easier for them to pretend the other didn’t exist, and here she was in their space. With her ex-boyfriend in tow. Thank God, Marlene had decided to take this moment to break away from the rest of their own group to wander over, just as Lily was rubbing ointment onto James’s fingers.</p>
<p>“McKinnion, what the fuck is going on with your hair?” Sirius snorted with laughter. Lily grinned. In the last hour, Marlene had let Lily tinker with some of the charm work that went into Marlene’s pink hair. The color was now such a shade that it almost seemed to radiate light. It was obnoxious and wonderful. </p>
<p>“I have no idea what you mean, this is how it’s always looked.”</p>
<p>“There,” Lily finished with the ointment. “Just, er, don’t do anything with your hands for an hour or so and let that sink in. You should be all fixed by tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome, I guess,” Caradoc held out a hand to help Lily to her feet and she stood, smoothing out her skirt.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you guys around,” Caradoc said, hugging both Lily and Marlene and nodding to James before leaving entirely. </p>
<p>Lily and Marlene made to leave too, back to their own compartment, when Peter blurted:</p>
<p>“Are you two back on then?”</p>
<p>James flushed with embarrassment, but he felt relieved that he wasn’t the one doing the asking. Lily turned slowly, a brow raised. </p>
<p>“Not that it’s any of your business,” she said evenly. “But no. See you guys at the feast.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Lily and Caradoc had dated for a good portion of fifth year. It had been a no-brainer match. They’d been friends for ages, both muggle-borns from the Midlands, both harbored a deep love of football, which then translated to a love of Quidditch. They both socialised in the same circles. </p>
<p>Problem was, Lily had not been a very good girlfriend. She’d been clinging so hard to her failing friendship with Severus, doing all she could to please him, let him know that she could never love or be closer to anyone else. She’d neglected Caradoc, blown him off when Severus demanded. And then when Lily had finally realised that she and Caradoc could’ve actually been something real, he’d had enough. </p>
<p>He’d been kind when he’d dumped her, still Lily had been crushed. She’d blown it before she even got the chance to see what they really could’ve been. And that, on top of finally severing ties with her oldest friend, and her father’s lymphoma, had made for a summer of extremely mixed up feelings on Lily’s part.</p>
<p>She’d hung out with old mates from primary school, starting and ending a relationship with the muggle boy in town whose family owned an auto shop, Kit Parker. Things had gone too far. He’d liked her too much, and she...had felt next to nothing for him. And at first, Lily had wondered if that was because she still wasn’t over Caradoc. But seeing him for the first time in weeks had felt normal. Like they’d never been more than friends. And Lily knew that he’d felt the same. They were over each other, and that at least, was one bit of normalcy. </p>
<p>What was <em> not </em> normal was how James bloody Potter had been acting around her. </p>
<p>He’d been awkward, like he was embarrassed over something. But also kind of civil? Lily didn’t understand it, given that the last time they’d spoken, she’d told him he was just as bad as her Death Eater aspiring former friend. That had been too harsh on her part, she thought now, looking back. And if it were her, she’d still be furious over such a slight. So why wasn’t he? Sirius Black still seemed to harbor some anger; though he and Lily never did manage to get along. At least over the years, she and James had their moments. They had to, given how Lily was a reserve Chaser and Beater for Gryffindor (originally, the old captain had wanted her to have a permanent position on the team, but Lily had insisted she didn’t have the time to commit fully).</p>
<p>Still. Lily had been horrible to him last they spoke. There was no reason for him to even be kind of polite. It worried her, put her on edge. And then she’d wondered if that anxiety was a valid response, or just another way her friendship with Severus had poisoned her. Her brow furrowed a moment at the thought, but then she shook it off as a question was directed her way, and very quickly, she was the girl without a care in the world again. </p>
<p>That was how the rest of the train ride passed; her working overtime to be the light she’d always tried to be with her friends. Her not expressing her real worries, instead debating over and over again which classes she thought she’d take to N.E.W.T. level. And as she spoke, the rain that had been pouring down in London became relentless. The first years were going to have a job of it, crossing the lake. </p>
<p>When at last, the train reached Hogsmeed Station, Lily was relieved to breathe fresh air, even if it meant getting wet. She dragged her trunk to a nearby carriage with her friends, shouting for first years to follow the gameskeeper, Hagrid, as she did so. None of the other twenty-two prefects seemed too dedicated to standing out in the rain, guiding students to carriages. Only Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Head boy, and Slytherin, and Diana Fetterman, the Head Girl, Ravenclaw, were doing their job. So when Lily had her things loaded onto the carriage, Lily said, “See you at the castle,” and abandoned the promise of being warm sooner, to go help manage the crowds. </p>
<p>Thankfully, it didn’t take long. Everyone was eager to get inside, and Hagrid had made quick work of getting the first years loaded safely onto the boats. All that was left was a lone horseless carriage for Lily to take with Kingsley and Diana. </p>
<p>“Thanks for your help, Lily!” Diana said in an uncharacteristically bright voice. Lily liked Diana, she did. She was going to be a brilliant Head Girl; but she was very serious. She could be very shy at times. Kingsley was a brilliant stroke of balance to her. He was friendly, spoke in the kind of voice where you couldn’t help but feel calm. Yes, he was Slytherin, but he’d always been a part of a faction of Slytherins that didn’t buy into the whole blood-purity bullshit. And he was Marlene’s cousin. So Lily knew him a little better than most. He and Diana were going to be excellent. </p>
<p>“It was nothing,” Lily waved her hand dismissively, happy to be under a roof again. “Rain makes people stupid.” </p>
<p>“Still,” Diana said. “You were the only prefect helping us. That shows Head Girl initiative.”</p>
<p>Lily felt her stomach drop. That was the last thing she wanted for herself come next year. “Ah well, let’s hope for everyone’s sake it doesn’t come to that,”</p>
<p>“So modest,” but Lily detected a hint of judgement from Diana. As though she couldn’t understand why anyone wouldn’t want to be Head Girl.</p>
<p>“How’s Marlene?” Kingsley said in his very calming voice, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“She’s good. Don’t say anything about her hair though. Not unless it’s praise.”</p>
<p>“Because?” Diana raised a brow.</p>
<p>“Because Sirius Black has already said something critical about it and Marlene is plotting her revenge,” Lily shrugged. Kingsley laughed as though he’d expected nothing less from his cousin. And Lily felt a little jealous just then of their bond. They were like brother and sister, despite both of them having a large immediate family of their own. Whereas Lily had never felt further away from her own, actual, sister.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey up to the castle passed in polite conversation, both Kingsley and Diana dropping hints for things they had planned during their tenure as head students, and Lily thought they were all in good hands. As they reached the school, Lily said good-bye to them and pushed her way through the throng of students to reach Marlene and Mary. Lily noticed Professor McGonagall, who was on her way to greet the first years, pass a rather repulsed look at Marlene’s shimmering pink hair. A look Lily was certain Marlene had seen, but elected to ignore. </p>
<p>The three of them took their seats at the Gryffindor table, Ayisha having joined her Ravenclaw mates, and waited patiently for the sorting to start. When at last McGonagall came strolling into the hall with the first years, someone let out a groan.</p>
<p>“Merlin, we weren’t that short, were we?”</p>
<p>“Yes you were, Black, don’t be rude,” Marlene hissed back.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t talking to you, McKinnion.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Mary said, as the hat began to sing its song.</p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes at the exchange, wondering if her friends and Potter’s friends had always been this...petty with each other. She’d thought nobody had seen, but James Potter himself seemed to catch her eye a moment and there was something of a sympathetic look about him. Weird. Every single encounter with him today had been weird. </p>
<p>The hat finished its song, and Pettigrew made a comment about how much he wished the hat could sing something that didn’t stress school unity in spite of what was going on outside. Remus said something back about how they could hardly blame the hat, since it lived in Dumbledore’s office, it was obviously influenced by him. And then the first name was being called. And Hufflepuff got the first new student of the year. In the end, Gryffindor wound up with ten more students for their ranks, and Lily was already putting names to faces.</p>
<p>“Does anyone know who the Quidditch Captain for Slytherin is?” Sirius asked, once the food had appeared. </p>
<p>“Emma Vanity,” Mary replied. How Mary knew that, Lily didn’t know.</p>
<p>“I told you no one was mental enough to make your brother Captain,” James said, scooping potatoes onto his plate. “He’s a fifth year besides.”</p>
<p>“Somebody was mental enough to make you Captain last year,” Peter grinned. </p>
<p>“Yeah well, I’m a better player than Regulus is.”</p>
<p>“Here here,” Sirius toasted. </p>
<p>“Speaking of Quidditch,” Mary cleared her throat, looking at James. “You’re going to have to find a replacement. I’m not playing this year.”</p>
<p>A lot of things happened at once. Lily’s mouth fell open, Marlene, who had been mid-sip, started choking. James and Remus dropped their forks, James gaping at Mary like she’d hit him in the head with a Bludger. Peter glanced from James to Mary, as if expecting one of them to laugh, and Sirius looked furious. </p>
<p>“Why the bloody hell not? We’ve got the best chasers in the school and you want to ruin that?” James elbowed Sirius in the side, as though imploring him to keep his voice down. </p>
<p>“Mary,” Lily said gently. “Why would you want to drop Quidditch?”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot more important things than Quidditch.”</p>
<p>“But...You’re so good!” Marlene protested. </p>
<p>“Why are you just telling me now?” James seemed to have recovered his shock and now he just looked immensely irritated. “You’ve been with the rest of the team all summer running drills.” </p>
<p>“Yeah, well I didn’t know if I was going to quit or not. Now that I’m here, I’ve found I’ve lost interest in the stupid sport.” </p>
<p>James sputtered. And Lily looked affronted. She and Mary had been so fascinated by the sport played on brooms once. Two muggle-borns, awestruck at all this new world had to offer. They’d been desperate to learn all the rules of the game, the most excited--Besides James--to take flying lessons. Quidditch had brought her and Mary together. And now Mary was just...not interested?</p>
<p>“Mary--” she began</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it, Lily!” Mary picked up her plate and stood. “You play. I’m done.” And then she walked down to table to join the seventh years. </p>
<p>Lily and Marlene exchanged half worried, half bewildered looks. And Sirius uttered a rather nasty swear. </p>
<p>“Uh, Evans,” James cleared his throat. “Mary’s right. We might need you to play.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have the time to go full time--”</p>
<p>James held up a hand, “I know. And I’ll hold tryouts. But if the new player can’t get up to the same level as the rest of the team, I’m gonna need you to sub in against Slytherin. We <em> can’t </em> lose to them.”</p>
<p>And well, Lily might not have been as dedicated to Quidditch as James Potter, but she was all in for her team. And she knew how devastating a blow it would be to lose to Slytherin after a four year winning streak. She nodded, “Okay. I’ll do it if you need me.” </p>
<p>“Thanks,” James seemed to release some of the tension he was holding onto. And Lily looked down at her plate, appetite gone. What was up with this year? And what was wrong with Mary?</p>
