  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p>Catskills, USA. 2001.</p><p><em>Hermione usually woke before the </em>sun rose, be it for rounds or her internal alarm clock that she loved to hate. She enjoyed sitting and watching the sun come up over the mountaintops, the light slowly creeping up her acres-long lawn. Winter was especially beautiful, when the light would catch the icicles just right and throw beams across the pristine snow.</p><p>She found solace in her old plantation home. She had painstakingly refurbished it bit by bit, from the stone walkway to the deteriorating beams that towered over her head and formed the vaulted ceiling to the whitewashed walls. She had hung old portraits, scavenged from the ruins of Hogwarts, and photos of long-dead friends along the walls. Reminders that, while life was peaceful here in her secluded home, things were truly far from <em>peaceful</em>.</p><p>She scraped her knife over her golden toast as her breakfast tea steeped, staring out over the white landscape. As she bit into her buttered bread, there was a <em>pop</em> of apparition, and a small house elf appeared before her.</p><p>"Good morning, miss!"</p><p>"Good morning, Hatty," Hermione greeted back fondly. "How are you today?"</p><p>"Hatty is well, miss. Hatty wearses a new dress!" she twirled, her patchwork dress - pieced together from bits of cloth Hermione presented her and a pillowcase - spinning about her knobby kneecaps. "Does the miss like?"</p><p>The witch smiled. "I love it. Yellow suits you."</p><p>Hatty gave a trill of delight, hugging Hermione's kneecaps. "Thanks you, miss." Then she turned and began puttering about the kitchen, summoning a stack of thickly sliced bread, a huge bowl of eggs, and other various breakfast items. "Hatty woke miss Cassie and miss Alicia. Miss Cassie likes to throw her shoe at Hatty."</p><p>Hermione stared at Hatty for a long second. "Did...she at least <em>miss</em>?"</p><p>The elf nodded enthusiastically. "The angry miss will have to be much faster to catch Hatty! Hatty is a fast elf!" She waved her whisk in nonchalance before returning to beat the eggs in bowl. The pan on the stovetop was beginning to sizzle, and she poured the milk-whipped eggs into it with a <em>hiss</em>.</p><p>There came the sound of footsteps, and a pair of women entered wearing thick robes - one blue, one yellow, fashioned after their days spent at Hogwarts.</p><p>"I would be a lot less angry, Hatty, if you didn't wake me every morning by clanging two pots together by my ears," grumbled the raven-haired woman in blue as she sat heavily on a stool across from Hermione. "Good morning, Hermione."</p><p>"Yes. Good morning, Hermione," Alicia chimed as she tucked in beside Cassie. "Good morning, Hatty."</p><p>The elf responded by setting a plate before her with eggs and toast and a smile. Cassie stirred a dollop of honey into her tea.</p><p>"Charlotte still out on patrol?" she asked.</p><p>Hermione nodded an affirmative. "We picked up on some tire tracks out by the West field. She went to investigate since I have classes this morning and she doesn't."</p><p>Alicia tilted her head to the side a bit. "What day is it today?"</p><p>"Tuesday, Alicia," Cassie groaned, taking a long drag of her tea. "Merlin, that's good tea." She rolled her stiff shoulders. "I have the 16 year olds out at the old silo, this morning. Identifying Jupiter's moons."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "I'll be in the classroom all day today; History of Magic."</p><p>"Greenhouse, for us!" Alicia chirped. "We are identifying the position of the sun and how it effects -"</p><p>"I <em>hate</em> Herbology. Have I ever mentioned that?" came a fourth feminine voice.</p><p>Alicia glowered, stabbing a quivering pile of scrambled egg and plopping it unceremoniously on her darkened, marmalade smothered toast. "About a dozen times a week."</p><p>"You have straw. In your hair, Char," Hermione smiled, gesturing.</p><p>With a mumble, the girl plucked out a long strand of grass from her short red hair. "I hate those fields. Nothing but thistles and bushes. It catches in my fur."</p><p>Alicia snickered under her breath, glancing up to look at the time. "Oh. It's already seven!" Cassie shrugged, moving to stand, and Hermione followed suit.</p><p>"Best get ready for the day, I suppose," Charlotte harumphed. "I'm going to shower and put on.<em>..clean</em> robes."</p><p>"Slytherins and obsessive cleanliness, I swear," Alicia mumbled as she handed her plate off to Hatty with a smile. "Merlin forbid you sbould have an speck of dirt on your otherwise immaculate being. The world would end!"</p><p>The red haired woman lifted her aristocratic chin and sniffed. "Sorry that us snakes would rather look half dignified and not smell like...what are you wearing? Eau de Compost?"</p><p>Alicia huffed, straightening her robes. "Stuck up Slytherin."</p><p>"You love me, Alicia."</p><p>"That," she hissed, "is beside the point. Now, please excuse me while I go wash off my <em>eau de compost</em>."</p><p>Cassie rubbed at the bridge of her nose. "<em>Must</em> you give me a headache this early in the morning?"</p><p>Behind her, Hermione chuckled. "It's a rather unfortunate gift they have, don't you think?"</p><p>With a shrug, Charlotte gave a wide yawn. "Yes, well, enjoy your classes. I'm off to bed -"</p><p>"Oh! Charlotte!" Hermione stopped her. "Did you figure out what those tracks were from?"</p><p>"Oh. Yes. Some teenagers decided to go off roading on our property," Charlotte answered with a shrug. "I raised some more wards to deter any muggles around that area. We may need to do a sweep, however."</p><p>Hatty swept past, then, levitating a huge bowl of steaming eggs, a towering plate of toast, and several dishes with fruit ahead of her. She paused to inform Hermione they were out of fruit before disappearing into the main dining area, where there came a low murmuring of voices.</p><p>"That's our cue," Cassie muttered, sweeping out the door after Hatty in a swirl of dark blue robes and long black hair.</p><p>Hermione hummed acknowledgement and put a small smile on her face. "Well, I'm off to attend the day. See you later, Charlotte. I assume you'll be out by the pond, as usual?"</p><p>"Yes. Cyril and Jed have almost got their transformations down, and I have the fifteen and sixteen year olds working on stamina this afternoon, after lunch. " Charlotte rolled her shoulders. "Thankfully, none of them are something ridiculous like...an orca. Or something. I don't think we have a big enough pond."</p><p>Hermione gave a nod of aporoval. "I guess it is a good thing we know what we are <em>before</em> the transformation occurs, huh? Could you imagine whales in the middle of the yard?"</p><p>With a chuckle, Charlotte shook her head. "I can see the Muggle headlines, now. Anyway, I'm off. If Fred swing by, tell him -"</p><p>"- I will, Charlotte. Good night."</p><p>The two women swept apart, Hermione following after Cassie and stepping into a large dining area where six underage children sat, buttering their toasts and sipping their teas. One girl - at least fifteen - looked up and greeted Hermione quietly before tucking her nose back into her voluminous book.</p><p>As Hermione moved to pass an older girl, the blonde haired witch looked up and touched her sleeve. "Miss Granger, I have a question about our History of Magic homework you assigned on Thursday. About Maglif and the Giant Wars."</p><p>After assisting Robin, she settled in at the head of the long table alongside Cassie, watching as more students trickled in to eat breakfast before classes assumed. Hermione gave a sad, soft smile.</p><p>After Voldemort had defeated Harry and overthrown the Ministry - and Hogwarts - in that bloody battle on May second, three years prior, Muggleborns had become first on the hitlist. Hunted down and executed like <em>vermin</em>, over one hundred men, women, and children - some as young as four or five - murdered in their homes. He preached that those of Muggle heritage were theives. Leeches on Wizarding society. A disease to be snuffed out if they were to survive.</p><p>So, with the help of the surviving Weasleys, Hermione had done the only thing she could do - <em>fled.</em></p><p>Fred and George - who had scraped through the Battle of Hogwarts by the skin of their teeth - had smuggled her to the United States via shipping container, along with Alicia, a Muggleborn Hufflepuff four years her junior. Cassie had followed soon after, and the three had set to work restoring an old, run-down plantation home in the Catskill Mountains. Charlotte, a Pureblooded Slytherin three years older than Hermione (and with Muggleborn sympathies), had jumped ship and joined them six months later, with the assistance of Charlie.</p><p>A year into their exile, Fred brought to them a newly-orphaned pair of boys - Caden Smith and Fallon Harris, both Muggleborns who had been whisked away just in the knick of time. Their parents, however, had not been so lucky, caught in the crosshairs of the newly established Ministry of Magic. Two months later, Tara Hughes had joined them, and then Dean Murray.</p><p>And then, Hermione came up with a brilliant - albeit dangerous - idea: an underground railroad for Muggleborns. A smuggling system to get those persecuted by the Ministry <em>out</em>.</p><p>Along with a few friends, they had infiltrated the Ministry to try and identify as many children as they could. Luna Lovegood had taken to record keeping for the Magical Births, Deaths, and Marriages department, altering and smuggling them as need be to several individuals that would then try and get to the children before the Death Eaters did. Tonks was one of those, bent on avenging the unjust death of her newborn son the same night as the Battle of Hogwarts, slain whilst his mother and father defended the last stronghold against Voldemort and his followers. Draco Malfoy, Pureblood Prince turned remorseful martyr, was another. After the death of his mother, he had thrown aside his Pureblood rhetoric in order to clear his family name. He had been an unlikely, but irreplaceable, ally.</p><p>Over the course of the following year and a half, Fred had moved permanently to Wizarding New York City and set up shop there, acting as the receiving center for children sent by his twin brother. The population had risen to thirty one in the blink of an eye, it seemed. Together with Alicia, Cassie, and Charlotte, the witches had decided to do their best to educate the children in their charge as to give them the best fighting chance. Among those studies was learning to become an Animagus - Charlotte's specialty. The skill was a must-learn, as it provided the children the opportunity to make a quick, undercover escape should the need ever arise.</p><p>From the front of the house came a loud <em>bang bang </em><em>bang</em>, and the dining room fell silent except for the giggling of Addison as she shredded her toast. Hermione, jolted from her reverie, stood, the chair legs scraping against the hardwood flooring.</p><p>Wand in hand, she went to answer the door, peering through the small peephole at the top and heaving a sigh of relief.</p><p>It was Fred. And there was a girl with him.</p><p>Unlocking the door, it swung open, and the redhead escorted the brown haired child into the house with a grim expression. "Sorry to bother you so early, 'Mione. This," he gestured to the slim girl with the too-big brown eyes and splattering of freckles across her petite nose, "is Emma."</p>
