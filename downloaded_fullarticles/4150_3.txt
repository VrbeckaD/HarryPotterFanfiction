    <p>Earlier on Fullmetal meets Marvel:</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>Well, well, alchemist we meet again!" Truth smiled wickedly. "I assume you want to get back to your little brother," it stated mockingly. "What did you bring me this time as a toll?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>This," Ed held up the miniature arc reactor that Tony gave him, its eerie, light blue glow illuminating her face. "It's a nifty little thing as I understand. One of the greatest inventions in the world you sent me to in terms of energy sources. The Philosopher's Stone if you think about is just an energy source as well."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Truth burst out laughing uncontrollably, literally rolling on the floor – if you could call the great white nothingness they floated in a floor – laughing. At Ed. Which was seriously getting on her nerves, her brow twitching furiously.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>Ahhh…" Truth finally got himself together. "You haven't learned anything at all right?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The blonde alchemist looked at the Gate Keeper, confused, having no idea what he could mean by that.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>I sent you to that world to broaden your perspective on the universe you live in. In which Amestris and your world is but a little speck of inconsequence in the greater scheme of things," it explained mockingly.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>One is all, all is one," Ed answered with the lesson she learned from her teacher all those years ago.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>Yes, that too," Truth smirked, waving her off dismissively. "But what I was implying that I wanted you to see the possibilities beyond alchemy… science… things that you can't explain away. And what you come back with?" it mused rhetorically.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>If I didn't know better I would be inclined to think that you are intentionally trying to piss me off," Truth continued with venom after a few seconds of silence with a heavy sigh. "I might just have to send you to another place to make sure you learn your lesson."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Without waiting for any kind of response, with a gesture of its hand the Gate opened again, the tiny black paws hauling her through as she screamed "YOU BASTARD!" at the top of her lungs.</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Edeline woke up on a wet cobblestone pavement, rain drizzling slightly in her face. </em>At least I have everything I gained last time… – <em>the alchemist thought as she looked herself over, being dressed in jeans, leather jacket, and her auto-mail arm still made of red colored titanium-gold alloy, so she assumed her leg was still upgraded too. Silver pocket watch in its rightful place but the mini arc reactor gone.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Taking in her environment, she knew at once that this was not a place she was familiar with, neither Amestris nor New York. Scrambling frantically for a newspaper around her to check for the date and location.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!" she yelled looking up at the sky when she saw that it was July 31st, 1996. And she was in London.</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>It took the alchemist some moments to notice the name of the newspaper. <em>Daily Prophet</em> – what an odd name she thought. Another several seconds passed by before <em>movement</em> caught her eye on the picture of the front page, prompting her to drop the thing like it was poison. Come to think of it, this alley she appeared in looked very peculiar too, but of course, she didn't know what London was supposed to look like. Creepy looking little shop displays surrounded her in the narrow street that she sat on the pavement of.</p>
<p>Edeline frantically thought her situation over. She knew that this city was supposed to be in the same world as she was in before, located on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, and was the capital of a country named the United Kingdom. But she had never heard from anyone that this country had weird technology that could make images move on pieces of paper. I mean she knew what the television was, so motion picture wasn't the news to her. Scanning over the main title, she read "Death Eater terror continues." <em>What on Earth were Death Eaters?</em> Then her eyes wandered to the subtitle of the newspaper. "The Wizard World's Beguiling Broadsheet of Choice" <em>What the actual fuck?</em> The puzzle was just getting larger and larger, the blonde was starting to get a feeling of immense dread.</p>
<p><em>I need to find a place with internet! Did internet exist even back in 1996? I need to contact the Avengers! Wait they </em>surely<em>hadn't existed back in 1996… Tony! Stark Industries were founded long before even if he wasn't Iron Man yet… Wait nineteen years in the past, how old is he in this time? Around twenty maybe? And what do I tell him? Sorry, you don't know me yet, but you will in two decades, by the way, I am from an alternate universe where alchemy exists, and I came through the Gate… What about S.H.I.E.L.D.? </em>– Ed cried out in frustration as the options ran through her mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she didn't have long to ponder since two men, wearing weird cloak-like attires, appeared before her – literally popping into existence out of thin air – and pointed… <em>sticks?</em>… at her. <em>Was that supposed to be threatening?</em></p>
<p>"Who are you and how did you get in here Muggle?" one of the men who was sporting a beard asked her pointedly. <em>What's a "muggle"?</em> – Ed thought. For some reason, it awfully sounded like some kind of an insult. The blonde was always ready for a fight anyway and besides… <em>Colonel Bastard would have a field day with this if she were to be defeated by a couple of dudes with </em>sticks<em>…</em></p>
<p>Ed quickly slapped her hands together and was immensely relieved when she felt the usual surge of energy in her veins that signaled that her alchemical circle activated. The alchemist quickly transmuted her auto-mail to her trademark cutlass as she took her stance.</p>
<p>"Wait… you are not a muggle!?" the other – African-American – man exclaimed in surprise lowering his wand a bit as he relented on his fighting posture.</p>
<p>"What's a muggle?" the girl burst out with a scowl having had enough with the derogation.</p>
<p>"No-maj to you I guess…" he supplemented gauging her American like accent. Although he could hear a bit of foreign quality to it.</p>
<p>"Still doesn't ring a bell, sorry!" Ed grumbled getting worked up even more by the minute.</p>
<p>"A person born without magic," he explained finally looking thoroughly perplexed.</p>
<p>Ed laughed out at that hysterically. <em>Magic? Really? What kind freak-show did I get into now?</em> Then the words of Truth rang in her mind – <em>I wanted you to see the possibilities beyond alchemy… science… things that you can't explain away.</em></p>
<p>"Well, I don't have <em>magic</em>!" the alchemist stated after getting her bearings together.</p>
<p>"Sure you do… even if it's a bit unconventional," the black man continued to reason with her, although he had to admit the fact that the girl used no wand and could perform… well, something… with the clap of her hands was nothing like anything he had seen before. The other man started to become restless though instead of calming down by learning the fact that they weren't dealing with a muggle. He had the sense that the girl was dangerous.</p>
<p>"Are you a Death Eater?" the bearded man who had addressed her first inquired pointing at her threateningly with his wand. The girl's eyes were unnatural, to say the least. Usually, only werewolves had that kind of irises, and they were allied with the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>"I have no idea what that is either, but you guys seriously need to work on coming up with less ridiculous names!" Ed guessed that it was an Earthly thing because ever since coming to this planet roughly six weeks ago she had the urge to snicker whenever she heard the more and more ludicrous terms and titles people could come up with.</p>
<p>"It's alright Gawain, I am quite positive that girl is not a Death Eater," the friendlier man addressed the first. "I am Kingsley Shacklebolt," he introduced himself finally. "This is my fellow auror, Gawain Robards – well boss now, sorry."</p>
<p>"You can't know that! And don't go revealing our identities to some random little witch you just encountered! She could be the enemy!" Robards reprimanded his subordinate. The confirmed reappearance of Who He Must Not Be Named had everyone on edge.</p>
<p>"WHO ARE YOU CALLING A LITTLE PIPSQUEAK WHO IS SO SMALL THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN DO MAGIC PROPERLY EVEN IF THEY TRIED?" <em>Did I really just say that? I don't even believe in magic! God these people are messing with my head!</em></p>
<p>"What is your name?" Kingsley ignored his boss's and the blonde's rant and asked calmly. If this girl were a Death Eater, she would have tried something by now.</p>
<p>"Edeline Elric," she answered, warily looking back and forth between the two men. The blonde was relieved by the fact that at least whatever this world was her identity wasn't known to anyone for sure. The manga only started in 2001 if she recalled it correctly. "Any of you going to explain this whole Death Eater thing already?"</p>
<p>"Death Eaters are the followers of Lord Voldemort," the dark-skinned man explained making the other wince at the name.</p>
<p>"Don't say the name out loud!" he admonished with shock on his face as Ed burst out laughing again, making both men turn to her mildly taken aback.</p>
<p>"Sorry, geez, warn me next time before dropping names like that on me!" she said wiping off a lone tear from the corner of her eye from the laughing.</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord is no laughing matter! He is a threat to the wizarding <em>and</em> muggle world alike," Gawain spat with venom still not being entirely sure of the girl's origins.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I get it, evil mastermind, have met a few of those," Ed turned severe, putting up her hand signaling her benign intentions then transmuted her hand back to its original state.</p>
<p>"You really have to tell us how you do that," Kingsley's curiosity won over.</p>
<p>"Alchemy," the blonde stated nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Well, there is your answer to whether you are magical or not. Alchemy is an ancient branch of magic, not really practiced in this day and age though…" the man was deep in thought. "Although I have never seen or read about alchemy being used in this way."</p>
<p>"Enough of this nonsense! What do we do with the girl?" Robards tapped impatiently with his foot.</p>
<p>"The <em>girl</em> is still standing right here, you know!" Ed cut in getting tired of being treated like she wasn't even present in the conversation. "Just tell me where I can find a place with internet, and I'm out of your way."</p>
<p>"Internet?" it was Shacklebolt's turn to be puzzled as he faced her. "Oh, that new muggle invention that Arthur always talks about… I'm sorry, but we don't have that in the wizarding world."</p>
<p>"Fine, an international – American to be precise – phonebook maybe?" the alchemist probed further.</p>
<p>"Phonebook?" the black man cocked a brow at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me you guys don't have phones yet?!" Ed exclaimed in shock. <em>Could nineteen years mean that much in technology? We even had phones back home, and that world is supposed to be a hundred years behind!</em></p>
<p>"Well, we know the muggles have, we just don't use that kind of stuff," Kingsley shrugged his shoulders, being sorry that he couldn't help.</p>
<p>"How do you communicate not in person then?" the alchemist inquired wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"By letters, carried by owls mostly, Floo network sometimes… or we just apparate to the person we want to talk to. Much easier I must say."</p>
<p>"Ugh… never mind," her mind reeled with the unknown expressions, but she was just too fed up with this nonsense to care or ask anymore and went right past between the two men hoping that the exit was that way.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you are going?" the bearded man called after her.</p>
<p>"Out of this looney bin and to the muggle world as you call it!" she yelled back as she stomped her way through the narrow alley towards what seemed like a more prominent, busier street ahead, not caring whether they followed her or not.</p>
<p>When she reached it though, she was frozen in her place by a couple of similarly oddly outfitted men, women, and children who were bustling about minding their own business, huddled close together in small groups, clearly as if afraid of something. And the shops! If she thought the displays were weird back there, then she didn't have a word for this. She saw bookshops – <em>Flourish &amp; Blotts</em>, owl shop - <em>Eeylops Owl Emporium</em>, broom shop – <em>Broomstix</em>, a pub - <em>The Leaky Cauldron</em> and many, many more with odd names welcomed her as she stood gaping at the scene.</p>
<p>"Where the hell are we?" Ed whispered forcefully to Kingsley as he caught up with her on her right side, the other man flanking her from the left.</p>
<p>"Diagon Alley," he informed unfazed by the girl's lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>"Diagonally?" she asked back, she wasn't questioning the directionality of the place.</p>
<p>"Diagon Alley," the black man repeated slower.</p>
<p>"How do I get out of here?" the alchemist asked since she saw no exit, the street being cut off by a big white building farther down on her left and the Leaky Cauldron on her right.</p>
<p>"Before you go, would you consider staying? I know a man who could help you out," Shacklebolt said kindly followed by an angry grunt from Gawain.</p>
<p>"No. I just need to contact my friends. They will come pick me up," the blonde insisted.</p>
<p>"You can't go telling people about the wizarding world and what you just saw," Kingsley instructed the girl as he led her through the secret wall opening in the backyard of the pub.</p>
<p>"Like anyone would believe this nonsense!" Ed snorted and rolled her eyes at the taller man as she took her leave.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it's safe to let her leave like that?" Robards asked his colleague after the blonde vanished from their sight, not really concerned with the well-being of the alchemist more like the people of the world outside.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, she will come back," the black man commented with humor in his eyes. He was still going to contact Dumbledore about the odd-ball witch they encountered who seemed to have no knowledge what so ever about their world.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After being led out to the busy Charing Cross Road of London through the Leaky Cauldron, Ed sighed contently that the place looked much more normal than the one she had just encountered previously. True, very different from New York, with the double-decker red buses instead of the many yellow cabs that she was used to, but still.</p>
<p>She cursed under her breath for not leaving the Avengers with her contact lenses in since her bright golden eyes attracted too much attention from the people passing by, and she shoved her right hand deep into her pocket to conceal her auto-mail as she roamed the street looking for something remotely helpful. A library, or internet café, or any other place where she could possibly gain access to the internet and look up what she needed.</p>
<p><em>At least people spoke English here too… even if they had a peculiar accent…</em> – Ed thought to herself with a sigh after not finding anything useful for more than thirty minutes of walking around and deciding to ask a pedestrian for instructions. She decided to talk up a girl only slightly older than herself, guessing that it would be the younger people who knew of this if it was already invented. She wasn't sure of dates from her research in New York when exactly the internet became a thing.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Miss!" Ed began politely to catch the other girl's attention who looked at her warily. <em>Thank God I'm not pretending to be a boy anymore, this would have been even more awkward...</em></p>
<p>"Yes?" the girl relaxed a bit as she took a better look at the smaller girl.</p>
<p>"Do you know where I could find an internet café?" the blonde inquired.</p>
<p>"Oh…" she looked deep in thought. "You mean like that place Cyberia?" Ed had no idea but nodded anyway. "That's on Whitfield Street, I think."</p>
<p>"Where is that? Could you give me directions?"</p>
<p>"About two metro stations on the Northern line," she explained than continued when she Ed's confused face. "We are by the Picadilly line now at Covent Garden, just go a few blocks down to your left to Leicester Square, you will see it when you get there."</p>
<p>Ed looked in the direction that was pointed out to her and realized that's where she had come from.</p>
<p>"Thanks!" the alchemist waved good-bye and was on her way.</p>
<p>On her way, she realized she was going to need money to do anything, so she ducked into one of the many alleys to find some scrap metal to transmute to gold, careful as to no one notice her ministrations. With that, she went into the first pawn shop on her way and came out a few pounds and pence richer.</p>
<p>On that same note, she decided to buy herself a map of London so that she wasn't forced to continually ask for directions from strangers.</p>
<p>With a little luck, she found what she was looking for. <em>Computers sure are bulkier than in the future</em>… <em>What am I thinking… for me this is still pretty much the future…</em> – Ed thought to herself as she glanced in through the window into the café seeing the lines of monitors on the desks.</p>
<p>Her search was a bust though. No Google, the search engine she was used to. Actually no anything! The internet, browsers, web pages that she was used to were all missing, and after a few weird stares that she got from the shop manager, she decided not to ask about it any further. Ed couldn't find anything on Stark Industries or Tony Stark, but she wasn't sure if it was the lack of information, or she was in a completely different world where they didn't exist at all! Last time S.H.I.E.L.D. found her the instant she appeared in this world. <em>Since no one came now… did that mean the organization didn't exist or they didn't have the technology yet to detect the energy surge of the array as I arrived? Or was I just too far away since I landed on another continent this time? Dammit, that I didn't take that stupid cell phone with me too! Would it have worked? Would any of them have the same phone numbers now as they did in the future?</em></p>
<p>With those questions running through her head, she started walking the streets again in a sullen mood, not bothering with the metro. She wasn't in a hurry. After quite some time she stumbled upon a wide river – <em>the</em> <em>Thames was it?</em> – and she stood there leaning against the railing taking in the breathtaking view of the curving waterfront.</p>
<p>It started to get dark, so Edeline decided to find herself a place to stay for the night. She found a small inn not too far, the innkeeper looking at her oddly, probably for asking for a room being this young, or having no luggage at all. She must have looked like a runaway from home. Ed couldn't really come to care.</p>
<p>Upon entering her small but cozy looking room she plopped down on the side of her bed, lying back down, her feet dangling off the bed, staring at the ceiling trying to process all that's happened in a day's worth.</p>
<p>That is until suddenly an old man – in long purple robes and half-moon glasses with almost equally long white hair and beard – appeared out of nowhere making Ed yelp and jump in surprise.</p>
