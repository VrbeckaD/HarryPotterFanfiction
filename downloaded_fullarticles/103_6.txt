  <em>August 15: Thursday</em>
</p>
<p>            Draco swept his wand through the air, warding the door and the shop securely. He took his time, making sure he didn’t forget a single spell. It had been another hectic day, and he was properly exhausted. For the past week, he had had to practically force himself out of bed in the morning, but it was finally mid-August, and the rush of Hogwarts students crowding Diagon Alley was slowly starting to die down.</p>
<p>            It was his second year being fully and independently in charge of Ollivander’s now. Most of the year was quite peaceful, and he was able to dedicate a majority of his time towards research and crafting new wands, with only the occasional customer dropping in for a purchase. Late summer was the busiest time, with an influx of new and returning Hogwarts students flooding the streets, first-years purchasing their first wands and a handful of older students bashfully admitting they had either broken or lost theirs. Christmastime was also somewhat demanding, but far more manageable. Thank Merlin for small mercies.</p>
<p>            After closing up the shop, Draco cast a quick cleaning charm to rid the room of dust and then walked up the spindly spiral staircase into his workshop.</p>
<p>            He adored his workshop. When Ollivander had officially handed the keys of the shop over and signed the deed over to Draco’s name, he had been granted full freedom to make any changes he saw fit. He hadn’t wanted to change much about the shop; Ollivander’s was a staple in the Wizarding community and Draco knew many witches and wizards had sentimental attachments to the store—he himself liked the darkness and airiness of it. He had attempted to tidy up the store a bit, sorting his wands out by core and wood, and setting certain Self-Cleaning Charms, however major changes were only done to the workshop upstairs.</p>
<p>            Ollivander had told him to organise it the way he liked, since it was to be his workplace and therefore needed to be an environment he felt productive in. So Draco had done so, rearranging the work station and purchasing shelves for all of his supplies. He had also put in a couple armchairs and a kettle by the fireplace for breaks and for when Ollivander stopped by.</p>
<p>            Ollivander still came by the store occasionally, even though Draco was now formally a wandmaker in his own right. They had monthly meetings, which Draco welcomed. Ollivander had become more than an instructor in the years since Hogwarts; he was a mentor to Draco. They mostly discussed wandlore and Draco’s research and experiments in wandmaking, but they would sometimes drift off into other topics.</p>
<p>            After Hogwarts, as his apprenticeship had continued, Draco had become more trusting of Ollivander, and opened up more about his ongoing struggles with coming to terms with the part he played in the war. Ollivander was wise, and kind, and had helped Draco through much of his internal strife.</p>
<p>            Draco checked his watch, the pale grey dial softly glimmering in the fading afternoon light streaming through the window, and frowned slightly. Ollivander had been due through the Floo almost fifteen minutes ago. He was always punctual, one of the many things Draco liked about him. However, he was also quite old, so perhaps it had just slipped his mind.</p>
<p>            Draco Summoned a quill and penned a quick note, asking after the senior wandmaker’s wellbeing and whether he would like to reschedule their meeting, and then called over Elpis, promising her a treat when she returned. She hooted happily as he tied the letter to her leg, and took off as soon as he opened the far window.</p>
<p>            While he was here, Draco decided he may as well have some tea, starting the kettle with a swish of his wand and settling into one of the comfortable armchairs. After the busy day he had had, he felt he had earned it, though he couldn’t really complain of good business.</p>
<p>            Last year, he had been terrified of working on his own, certain that no one would want to purchase wands from a man like him. Ollivander had calmed him, reminding him that after the first year of serving as his apprentice in the store, the gossip and judgment had already died down.</p>
<p>            <em>“People have short attention spans, Draco,” </em>Ollivander had said, with a dismissive wave of his hand. <em>“I guarantee there’s something far newer and more interesting than your past to get up in arms about now.”</em></p>
<p>            As usual, he had been right. The beginning had been tough, and he had overheard many people wondering out loud if Ollivander had “lost his rocker” hiring an ex-Death Eater, but over time these conversations grew less and less frequent, and people got used to him being around. He had even become somewhat friendly with some of the other workers and owners of neighbouring shops.</p>
<p>            Still, serving as Ollivander’s apprentice had been one thing; taking over the job entirely was another, and Draco had been fraught with nerves his first few months. There was the occasional customer who vowed their children would never purchase a wand off of him and had instead taken off to Carkitt Market in search of imported wands from Kinta Wolfe in the United States or Filip Poláček from closer to home in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>            Draco had agonized over that initially, but Ollivander had reassured him that his work would speak for itself, and he wouldn’t have to worry about customer disloyalty. Now, only in his second year, he had already earned his place at Ollivander’s in society’s eyes, as well as in Ollivander’s himself. Pre-Hogwarts season certainly proved he didn’t have to worry about customers running to the competition. In fact, he wouldn’t even complain if a few more decided Czech wands were more their style.</p><hr/>
<p>
  <em>August 16: Friday</em>
</p>
<p>            When Draco stumbled into the kitchen in the morning, he found that Polkey had left breakfast for him under a stasis charm. He sighed a little, but pulled the tray towards himself and undid the charm before digging in.</p>
<p>            He had moved into London last year, when he had taken over Ollivander’s, declaring that he wanted to be closer to work. While true, it hadn’t been the only reason. Returning to the Manor from Hogwarts had been difficult. His mother had truly outdone herself in the repairs and renovations, and the cold and maddening feeling of the remainders of Dark Magic had been removed. However, Draco had found that many prickly memories remained. He had once loved this house; had played in the gardens and run through the hallways, but too much had happened here. Too much had changed.</p>
<p>            Narcissa herself had had quite enough of it once her year of house arrest was through, having been confined within its walls as she served her sentence, and she had wheedled Draco into taking a lengthy vacation with her on the Isle of Skye. Upon their return, she had settled into a nice routine and grew to enjoy the Manor again, now that it was a home instead of a prison.</p>
<p>            But Draco had continued to feel slightly uneasy, as though there was a constant chill up his arms he could never shake off. Much as he loved his mother, he had been glad to have the excuse of his work to move out.</p>
<p>            Surprisingly, Narcissa had encouraged it, proclaiming that it was time for Draco to be his own man. She had been proud of his work, even though Draco knew that Lucius would have sneered about it, and had offered to help Draco search for a new place to live. Draco had turned her down, because he knew she’d end up taking over the task entirely. He did promise to have her over as his first guest however, and he had followed through once he had made the purchase.</p>
<p>            His new home was a terraced house in a decent wizarding neighbourhood, a far smaller choice than Narcissa had expected. Draco had known it would be an adjustment, but the Manor had felt so overwhelming and so vast during the last few years, with Lucius being gone and their years of entertaining guests long behind them. He hadn’t realized how empty it would feel with only the two of them there. He was only one person, and he had decided that this was more than enough space for him.</p>
<p>            Narcissa had insisted that one of the remaining Malfoy house-elves be assigned to him. Draco had attempted to argue, but he should have known better than to try and dissuade Narcissa of something once her mind was made up, so Polkey officially became his house elf. He had managed, at least, to convince the two of them that Polkey should spend most of her time at the Manor, since he was often at work anyway, but Polkey still came around to prepare meals and clean up.</p>
<p>            Draco was trying to teach himself how to cook, something he only thought of after a thorough admonishment from his best friend—<em>“You’re a grown man and you can’t even fry an egg? For shame, Draco!”—</em>but it was hard to practice when there was always a meal ready for him in the kitchen. He kept telling himself he’d have a word with Polkey about it, but a part of him was far too selfish to give up these delicious meals for his own dismal cooking.</p>
<p>            After finishing up his breakfast, he cast Cleaning Charms on all the dishes and levitated them to return them to their proper shelves. He could at least say he had gotten slightly better at household spells, though Polkey always managed to find something he’d missed or forgotten to clean.</p>
<p>            Checking his watch, Draco went back to his bedroom to get dressed. It was another day of work ahead of him, and he could only hope today would be less stressful than yesterday.</p>
<p>            Before opening up the shop today, he took the extra few steps down the south side of Diagon Alley to Prospero’s Potions Emporium. It was still early enough, and it had been a while since he had stopped by to catch up with Theo. The young shop assistant, Willa, looked up when the door opened and waved when she recognized him.</p>
<p>            “Hi Draco!” she said, cheerily. “Looking for Theo?”</p>
<p>            “If he’s available?”</p>
<p>            “I’ll check if he’s brewing yet,” she said, and walked through the curtained archway that led to the back of the store. After a few moments, which Draco spent observing the potions under lock and key in the glass case by the register, she reappeared.</p>
<p>            “He said you can go on back,” she told him. He thanked her and walked through the curtain himself, back to where he knew Theo was brewing. Sure enough, in the back workshop, Theo was bent over a cauldron.</p>
<p>            “Hey,” he greeted him gently, so as not to disturb his focus. He knew how concentrated he himself would get while brewing potions, and how much he hated being interrupted. But Theo easily looked up and grinned at him.</p>
<p>            “Hey, Draco,” he said. “How are you?”</p>
<p>            “I’m well,” Draco replied. “Trying to make it through the rest of August in one piece. And yourself?”</p>
<p>            Theo shrugged, ceasing the flame under his cauldron with a casual flick of his wand.</p>
<p>            “About the same.”</p>
<p>            “What are you brewing?” Draco asked, curiously trying to catch a glimpse of the contents of the cauldron.</p>
<p>            “Nothing exciting,” Theo snorted. “There’s some sort of stomach bug going around, we’ve been selling out of our Stomach Soothing Tinctures, so I’m making more batches.”</p>
<p>            Draco nodded, watching as Theo began to carefully spoon the potion into a glass vial.</p>
<p>            “And how is the lovely Miss Cordelia?” he asked, not failing to notice how a smile automatically spread across Theo’s face at the sound of her name.</p>
<p>            “Wonderful as always,” he replied, stoppering the vial and getting started on another one. “She’s been promoted to work as secretary for Quincy Buchanan at the Headquarters of the International Magical Trading Standards Body.”</p>
<p>            Draco’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>            “Already? That’s impressive.”</p>
<p>            “She’s overqualified, to be frank.”</p>
<p>            Draco couldn’t help but smile. Theo’s admiration for his girlfriend was overwhelmingly endearing.</p>
<p>            “She certainly is, but she’s also only, what, twenty-two?”</p>
<p>            “Twenty-one,” Theo corrected, stoppering the last vial and then casting a quick Cleaning Charm on the cauldron. Draco let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>            “She’ll be the head of the whole department in less than five years, I’d bet my wand on it.”</p>
<p>            Theo smiled.</p>
<p>            “I’ll tell her you said that, she’ll be delighted.”</p>
<p>            “Oh, good, after you do that, remind her how much I adored that strawberry toffee she made for Violet’s birthday.”</p>
<p>            Theo rolled his eyes good-naturedly.</p>
<p>            “If you want, you can just ask her, you know. I’m sure she wouldn’t mind making some.”</p>
<p>            “I’d rather do it through you, I think she likes you better,” Draco said, playfully, and Theo shook his head in amusement.</p>
<p>            “Don’t you have a business to run?”</p>
<p>            “Yes, yes, I’m off to run it. Will I see you at Violet and Daphne’s next Slytherin reunion?”</p>
<p>            “You have to stop calling them that, Draco,” Theo said, but he was still grinning.</p>
<p>            “The day she invites someone that wasn’t in Slytherin, I swear I will,” Draco replied, crossing over his heart with his finger.</p>
<p>            “Yes, Cordelia and I will be there. You know, my girlfriend, who <em>wasn’t </em>a Slytherin.”</p>
<p>            “Ah-ah!” Draco raised a finger. “She didn’t go to Hogwarts, so it doesn’t count. She very well <em>could </em>have been a Slytherin.”</p>
<p>            Clearly realizing that it was pointless to argue, Theo made a shooing motion with his hand.</p>
<p>            “Go, Draco, I’ll see you next Sunday.”</p>
<p>            After bidding goodbye to Theo, Draco walked back through the curtain to the front of the shop. Willa was busy with a customer, so Draco just sent her a little wave before ducking out of the store and heading back north towards Ollivander’s.</p>
<p>            Despite his busy schedule, he always looked forward to Violet and Daphne’s dinners. They had started when Violet and Daphne had first moved into their own place, almost three years ago now. Initially, it had just been the five of them—Violet, Daphne, Theo, Blaise, and Draco—the only Slytherins of their year who had returned to Hogwarts after the war. They had all kept in touch after school, some more than others, and Daphne had had the idea to start a tradition of meeting up every so often so that they would actually see each other more regularly.</p>
<p>            It had grown from there, with both Violet’s and Daphne’s younger sisters joining in. They were of a similar age, Laurel being only one year younger than Astoria, but it had been slightly awkward when Laurel had come to her first dinner, being the only one at the table who couldn’t perform magic. She hadn’t seemed bothered in the slightest, and had easily broken the tension by jokingly insisting that she refused to be on dish duty since they could all accomplish it in seconds.</p>
<p>            Draco had already been familiar with her humour and how accustomed she was to being the only Squib in the room, as he had met her before. She was very similar to her sister in her mannerisms and attitude, which of course endeared her to Draco, since Violet was such a good friend of his.</p>
<p>            Occasionally, Ella Wilkins would join them as well. Daphne and Violet had kept up with her after Hogwarts and she now worked at the Velvet Tearoom, an upscale café and bar just a few blocks over from Ollivander’s, even closer than Prospero’s. When she had started there, Violet had asked Draco to pop in now and then to check on her. Initially, that was all it had been, but Draco had become better friends with her, as well as with the head pastry chef, an American woman named Sabrina Sullivan, and he quickly became addicted to their desserts. Despite their friendship, Ella remained rather shy and had been surprised when Draco had invited her to a Slytherin dinner, but she had ended up enjoying herself.</p>
<p>            She didn’t come every time, claiming she didn’t want to impose, no matter how many times Violet and Daphne insisted she was more than welcome, but Draco still saw her often enough due to the proximity of their workplaces.</p>
<p>            Perhaps he’d take a break over lunch and go see her today. It had been a while since he had been there, and he was always in the mood for one of their delectable pastries.</p>
<p>            But first, he had to make it through this morning.</p>
<p>            Truthfully, he loved selling wands. When he had begun learning about wandlore, he had never understood how Ollivander could possibly remember every wand he ever sold, but now that he was a wandmaker himself, it seemed more fathomable.</p>
<p>            Making a wand was an intimate process, the closes Draco had felt to something spiritual. He poured his soul into every wand he made, and it was strenuous, exhausting work. It was always close and careful crafting work as well; he would never allow a subpar wand to be sold.</p>
<p>            Watching kids try out the wands was rather special as well. He had never been particularly fond of children, not having any younger siblings or cousins while growing up, but he remembered how excited he had been to get his first wand and he could see that same excitement in every child’s eyes as they entered his store.</p>
<p>            He wondered if one day he would be able to remember every want he ever sold the way Ollivander did, but just in case his memory was not up to Ollivander’s level, for the time being he kept a log. In his first year, he had sold exactly sixty-three wands. He had worried that that wasn’t enough perhaps, despite how busy he had been, but Ollivander had been encouraging, saying it was a very impressive number for his first year.</p>
<p>            He had sold one wand today thus far, to an energetic girl with wild blonde curls and a mother with the patience of a saint. She had tried six wands before finally landing on the right one, causing quite a bit of destruction in the shop. Her mother had apologized profusely, but Draco had smiled and waved it off, reassuring her that it was all part of the process. The girl had been delighted with her wand and had nodded and listened intently as Draco instructed her on how to care for it. After she had left with her mother, Draco pulled out his log and quill and added a new line.</p>
<p>            <em>Paige Woodward – beech and bumblebee wing, twelve inches, light and yielding</em></p><hr/>
<p>            Elpis still hadn’t returned with Ollivander’s response by the time Draco was ready to close up for the day, which was slightly worrisome. The senior wandmaker did live rather far, but he hadn’t expected it to take this long. He supposed Elpis had probably been tired after the journey and Ollivander had let her stay and rest. While he didn’t have any pets himself, Ollivander had a soft spot for animals, and he loved Elpis, always commenting on her lovely plumage.</p>
<p>            Draco knew Elpis was in good hands, so he put away his worries and warded up the shop before leaving and casting the final locking charms from the outside.</p>
<p>            “Hey Draco,” came a warm voice from behind him. He turned to see Dean Thomas emerging from The Daily Prophet’s main office.</p>
<p>            Ollivander’s store being right across from The Daily Prophet headquarters had been a daunting prospect for Draco when he started working there. Even while under Ollivander’s tutelage, there had always been the odd reporter hanging around outside with a camera, reading to snap a picture of Draco doing something untoward. Only after months of Draco living his typical, not particularly interesting life did they finally let up and more or less leave him alone.</p>
<p>            He was still by no means fond of the newspaper, and he was always careful, but he didn’t do anything these days worth reporting on anyway, so he didn’t feel as hunted as he once had.</p>
<p>            Dean Thomas was one of the few people working at the Prophet that he could stand, despite the dislike they had had for each other during their Hogwarts years. The former Gryffindor had been named Junior Quidditch Correspondent several months ago, after doing grunt work there for years. They weren’t exactly friends, but they had built up a friendly rapport, greeting each other and occasionally exchanging simple news or small talk. Draco would ask what teams Dean expected to make it to the league and Dean would joke that revealing such information would violate his contract.</p>
<p>            “Hello Dean,” Draco greeted him. “Busy day?”</p>
<p>            Dean shrugged.</p>
<p>            “Not really. Quidditch season doesn’t start for another month. You?”</p>
<p>            “Demanding, but quite entertaining. Two Muggleborns bought wands today; that’s always the most fun.”</p>
<p>            “With their parents?” Dean asked, a grin spreading over his face.</p>
<p>            “Oh, yes,” Draco nodded. “The boy’s poor mother nearly fainted when he accidentally shattered the window.”</p>
<p>            “Ah, if only she knew what’s yet to come,” Dean said, devilishly.</p>
<p>            “I made the rules about underage magic explicitly clear to all of them.”</p>
<p>            Draco had learned from Ollivander all the additional information he had to give to Muggle parents, and he made sure he explained everything methodically. It was easy to forget how much Muggles didn’t know, despite how much better his knowledge of Muggles had become.</p>
<p>            After he and Dean parted ways, Draco Apparated home to rest for a bit before he was due at the Manor. He had promised his mother he would go there for dinner tonight, though he wasn’t feeling entirely up to it. He thought he’d much rather wait for Elpis at home and just be lazy on the sofa, but he knew better than to go back on his word with Narcissa. If he tried to say he wasn’t feeling well, she’d be at his house in minutes and have Polkey prepare him a soup.</p>
<p>            So he allowed himself twenty minutes to relax before going to his bedroom and changing into a different set of robes appropriate for dinner. He did enjoy dinners with Narcissa, even when they were after a long day of work. He had always adored his mother, but they had grown even closer the past few years, as he had developed a different relationship with her as an adult. He had admired her as a child, of course, but he had been a daddy’s boy growing up, idolizing Lucius while slightly fearing him as well. But as an adult, he saw how truly impressive his mother was, how capable and strong she was, with at true tactician’s mind and none of the volatile temper Lucius exhibited. He enjoyed spending time with her and was grateful for how their relationship had grown and developed.</p>
<p>            After stepping out of the Floo and brushing non-existent Floo powder off of his robes, he walked over to where she was waiting for him and leaned in to greet her with a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>            “Hello Mother,” he said, smiling at her.</p>
<p>            “Draco, dear, how was your day?”</p>
<p>            “Busy as usual,” he replied, accompanying her into the dining room. “But quite pleasant, and yours?”</p>
<p>            “Oh, it was lovely. I had my second lunch with Andromeda today.”</p>
<p>            This was a new development—Narcissa’s decision to reach out to her estranged sister in an attempt to make peace. She had told him she’d sent Andromeda a letter only a month ago, but Draco could tell she had been thinking about it for a lot longer. Two weeks ago, they had met for lunch, seeing each other face-to-face for the first time in years. Narcissa had gotten teary-eyed just talking about it to Draco. From what she told him, it had been a somewhat awkward meeting, but there had been heartfelt apologies and tearful embraces and they had agreed to meet again.</p>
<p>            “How was it?”</p>
<p>            “Wonderful,” she said, with a soft smile on her face. “She is so kind and warm, I’d forgotten how it feels to be around her.”</p>
<p>            “That’s great to hear,” Draco said, reaching out to squeeze his mother’s hand. “I’m glad you decided to contact her.”</p>
<p>            “I am as well,” she said. “I’d love for you to meet her soon.”</p>
<p>            “I’d like that.”</p>
<p>            Dinner went quite smoothly, and Draco found himself grateful that he hadn’t cancelled on his mother. The food was delicious as always, thanks to the elves, and Draco was reminded again how much he enjoyed Narcissa’s company. She listened intently as he told her of research he was doing on infusing wands with multiple cores, and insisted he eat a second plate of dinner because he was “far too thin, Draco, are you certain Polkey shouldn’t be at your home more often?”</p>
<p>            He was just bidding her goodbye in the living room with a kiss on the cheek when the fireplace roared to life.</p>
<p>            Draco’s wand was in his hand in an instant, his left arm flying out to push his mother behind him. He didn’t even think, his reaction was automatic, an instinctual movement.</p>
<p>            A slender woman emerged from the fireplace, flicking back short pin-straight black hair with long and dangerously pointed red fingernails. She looked up at Draco and smirked at the sight of his wand pointed at her.</p>
<p>            “Come now, Draco, are you really going to hex your dear old friend?”</p>
<p>            Draco’s grip on his wand slackened and he stared at her in disbelief.</p>
<p>            “<em>Pansy?”</em></p>
