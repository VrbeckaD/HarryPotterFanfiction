Perhaps he was startled at being addressed at dinner. It happened rarely enough.</p><p class="p1">“There are rumours,” he said in his low, smooth voice. “That Crouch will be approving the use of the Unforgivables, and-”</p><p class="p1">“Nonsense, Orion,” Mother interrupted, a little too loudly. She waved her hand at him and almost sent her sherry flying across the dinner table. Kreacher’s surprisingly spritely actions managed to save both the glass and the antique lace tablecloth. “It would never pass the Wizengamot.”</p><p class="p1">“Actually Auntie, since the Minister has declared a State of War the Department Heads no longer require approval from the Wizengamot for any temporary legislation that they may wish to pass.”</p><p class="p1">They all turned to look at Narcissa in surprise. She smiled sweetly. “At least, that is what Lucius told me.”</p><p class="p1">“Well,” Mother huffed. “Perhaps you can ask your little friend to have a word with his father, Regulus. What was his name again?”</p><p class="p1">“I hardly think that a teenager-”</p><p class="p1">“Hush, Orion! Let the boy speak!”</p><p class="p1">“His name is Barty,” said Regulus.</p><p class="p1">“<em>Another</em> Bartemius? They named him after his <em>own</em> father? How <em>gauche</em>,” Mother sneered. “It used to be common knowledge that you should leave at least <em>one</em> generation between names. Yet another sign of the degradation of our society and traditions, I suppose.”</p><p class="p1">Regulus thought it best not to bring up his great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, each named Sirius. Perhaps skipping <em>two</em> generations before naming yet another son Sirius made that permissible in her eyes.</p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
