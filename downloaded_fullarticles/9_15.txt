  <em>“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches…” </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <em>   </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">His mother's sunken face frozen in muted horror, blood -<em> there's too much blood.</em> His back is bare, hunched over and mutilated. A silent prayer, where is his redemption?</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <em> “born to those who have thrice defied him-”  </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <em>   </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">A glimpse; a gut-wrenching howl tearing through his raw throat, the belt being brought down a final time.  </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <em> “-born as the seventh month dies.”  </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <em>   </em>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">“Rise.” </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He stiffens, scarcely breathing. The Dark Mark pulses beneath his skin; vile and a staunch reminder of the life of servitude he has sentenced himself to.  </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“You have earned your place within my inner circle. Come, Severus.”  </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The prophecy turns to ash on his tongue and his heart plummets in his chest as he lifts his gaze to the gaunt form of the man who ordered his death.  </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus recalls his death in startling clarity; by no means should he be alive, grovelling beneath the Dark Lord. The sight is burned into his memory. Venom drips from its fangs, another memory, a ravaged body is discarded. An eruption of pain, <em>haunted green eyes-   </em></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">His hand instinctively flies to his neck, trembling fingers darting across unblemished skin. How was he alive? He should have died in the Shrieking Shack. This wasn't a memory, that he was sure of.  Fear coiled in the pit of his stomach with the sinking realisation that he was reliving his past - albeit with no logical explanation - during the height of the war. A war that he had not survived.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He should not be here. He shouldn’t be alive, for that matter. He wracked his mind for any sort of answers. Perhaps Nagini’s bite had induced a hallucination? It was entirely possible – he’d remembered Arthur Weasley’s pitiful state and incessant whimpering. If the wretched Potter boy had any part in this, then there would truly be nothing stopping him from cursing Potter to an inch within death.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Rising from the stone floor, he swiftly matches Mulciber’s gait. He harshly reminds himself to occlude, detaching himself from the improbable situation he has found himself in.  The other man merely cocks a brow – no doubt will Severus be questioned later, preferably over a bottle of Firewhisky. He cannot afford to implicate himself.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Hold out your arm, Mulciber.” The Dark Lord commands, brandishing the Elder Wand.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus freezes as Mulciber unveils the Dark Mark on his forearm. He's to be marked again - as one of his most trusted servants - though there were more pressing matters. The Dark Lord possessed the most powerful wand in existence. He shouldn’t be in possession of <em>that</em> wand. How?</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The severity of the implausible situation he has found himself in collapses on his shoulders, an unbearable weight he knows he must share alone. Under no circumstance should he divulge the nature of his situation to anyone. People were simply not to be trusted; it was a lesson well learnt in his youth. Travelling through time was unprecedented. Living to tell the tale was unheard of.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">There was a reason time travel was strictly regulated. Eloise Mintumble had travelled back five centuries in 1899, trapped for a period of five days in 1402. Her body aged five centuries upon her return to the present and she shortly passed away thereafter. The results were catastrophic. Severus didn’t dare dwell on the consequences of his arrival.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He observes as Mulciber takes the mark, calculating eyes sweeping his arm for the poised snake that he had familiarised himself with. Instead, he notes with rising alarm, crossed wands form behind a coiled snake. One was inducted into the Death Eaters with the Dark Mark, used by the Dark Lord to call upon them. Very few had the honour of entering his inner circle and even fewer were marked once again with the ability to call upon the Dark Lord himself.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The form of his mark hadn’t changed, previously. What was the significance of the wands? He briefly contemplated the significance of this new development, willing himself to tune out the groans and whimpers escaping from his companion.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Only later would he would realise the extent to which history had already altered from his mere presence in the past.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Take your place.” Mulciber does so immediately, his trembling form seizing at every step.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Mulciber places himself by Rodolphus Lestrange and presumably his intended, a bare-armed Bellatrix Black. She captures his glower, narrowing her hooded eyes. Unmarked. Severus entertains the thought that she is deemed unworthy of his mark as he abates his gaze, unchallenging. It would not bode well to incite her ire, sane or not.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The Dark Lord turns to him expectantly. He hastily unbuttons his cuff and uncovers his own branded arm. The murmurs of those in attendance come to a brief lull, shortly before the tip of the Elder Wand touches his mark and his vision explodes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He’s back in the shack, with Lily’s wide eyes peering helplessly at him as he takes his last breath. He’s receiving his first mark, proud - so proud, delirious and intoxicated by the rush of power that courses through him. His vision blurs and he’s back in the present, writhing and convulsing, his nerves lit on fire.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He has never felt pain like this before, excruciating, threatening to tear him apart. The first time around, it was over within seconds. He couldn’t tell how long he’d been subjected to a form of torture far worse than the Cruciatus Curse.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Before, he’d viewed this moment with great pride. The pain was insignificant in the grand scheme of thing; in attaining glory and the acknowledgement he was denied, that he was more than a Half-blood without a sickle to his name. More than the squalor of his childhood home in Cokeworth.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">A bead of sweat rolls down his forehead as he wills himself to endure, remain in control, <em>breathe.</em></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Then it’s all over.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Head bowed, a few inky black strands escape from behind his ear and cloud his vision. He releases a shaky breath and wills himself to keep his eyes trained on the cracked floor. It’s a difficult feat, he must admit, to resist the urge to turn his attention to his arm and study the Mark. Although… if he remembered correctly, he had spent the summers following his graduation residing in Malfoy Manor, fretted over by one Narcissa Malfoy. His godson had yet to be born.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus was conflicted. While maintaining the guise of a faithful Death Eater and confidante of Lucius, he would not be left up to his own discretion to study the Mark and form his own plans. Entering the inner circle had placed him closer to the Dark Lord’s proximity and while he was a skilled Occulems, he had not yet achieved the mastery he had during his time as a spy for the Order of the Phoenix. Nevertheless, Dumbledore was an obstacle that mustn't be disregarded either.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s a shift in the atmosphere that he couldn’t quite place as an unusual silence sweeps over the room, broken from his musings. As if on cue, he swiftly takes his place beside Lucius Malfoy. The man in question wears a guarded expression behind his mask with his shoulders squared and a hunger lingering in his eyes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The Dark Lord was an imposing figure, standing tall before his followers. Perhaps what had surprised Severus the most was his appearance, devoid of any likeness to the slit-nosed being that the Wizarding world came to fear. Pale, yes, although with a charming curl to his black hair and deep emerald robes, only the crimson gleam in his dark eyes betrayed his use of the darkest magic in existence.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“There has been a prophecy,” he spoke at last, cutting through the palpitating silence. “A child, yet to be born, prophesied to be my downfall.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">There’s a sharp intake of breath from Severus’ right. No one spoke.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Mulciber!” The Dark Lord thundered, rousing him from his stupor. “Bring me a list of all magical children born in the month of July.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“As you wish, my lord.” He swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing, disapparating at once.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">The Dark Lord turns his attention towards him and he knows at once what he must do.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“You will aid Mulciber in his search. Do not fail me.”</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">“Yes, my lord,” he drawls, tone levelled. He disapparates at once, feeling Lucius tense beside him, visualising the cracked stone walls of a seedy alleyway. He would find his reprieve there.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><hr/><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">With his mask and Death Eater robe removed, Severus could finally breathe at last. He strode further up the alleyway towards his destination, listening to the echoes of his dragonhide boots on the cobbled street. Flouncing around the corner, he slipped into the dingy pub that he so often frequented as a young man.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Only quiet murmurs and the hum of intelligible conversations could be heard, beside the pop of a bottle and the chink of a glass as the barman poured his drink. Severus preferred it this way, this silent exchange. Efficiency and discretion were to be valued for a man such as himself. There were few who possessed those traits, much to his displeasure.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Settling into a creaky stool and gripping his drink, his mind wandered. There was much to do, and even more to plan. Decisions. His mind whirled with unexplored ideas, ones he’d dare not touch, ones he knew not to entertain.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Gulping his down his drink, he grimaces as the alcohol burns and settles in the back of his throat. His grip tightens on his beer as he dwells on the prospect of facing Lucius later that evening, having drunk himself into a stupor. For his later defence, the alcohol seemed to loosen his nerves and lessen the searing pain in his foreman. As unpleasant as it may be, he has no intention of staying sober for the next 24 hours.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">It was a familiar routine. He nursed old wounds over a bottle and let self-loathing consume him until all that was left was a gaping hole where his heart should be. To bury his sorrows and drink until he forgets.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He can't.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">She would always remain as the girl who he had grown up with, with flaming hair and scabby knees, bright smile, enthralled by the world they were going to take by force. He held onto this memory of her; this Lily, which only existed within his memories. He can’t claim to know the woman that she had grown into, not anymore. Lily Potter wasn’t his.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">She was due, soon, with <em>his</em> child. The prophesied boy, as exceedingly arrogant, reckless and infuriating as his father had been, perhaps even more so. His lip curled at the prospect of facing the boy once again, despite possessing few of Lily’s redeemable qualities. Her eyes. He was certainly not looking forward to another seven years of irrational fear and ire at the boy’s disregard for his own safety. Like father like son, he supposed.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">That future was foreseeable. There was a possibility that if fate had run its course, the Wizarding world would have changed irrevocably under the reign of the Dark Lord. There was no place for him in either. If, went unsaid, he survived.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Knocking back the remainder of his drink and fishing a tenner out of his pocket, he surveyed his surroundings with rapt attention. His caution wasn’t entirely unwarranted; his father had been a regular, and he hardly wished to be mistaken for him. The dim lights flickered and cast shadows on his tightened expression as he weaved through the pub with relative ease and ducked out behind the fire exit, allowing himself to unravel.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">With a fag lit, courtesy of an intoxicated man, he took it between his pursed lips. It was startling how easy one could fall back into abandoned habits. He’d long abandoned the sordid habit once he had taken the post of Potions Master and, begrudgingly, Slytherin's Head of House at Hogwarts and discovered few Half-bloods in his house were familiar with the stench.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus felt lighter as each puff dissipated into the February chill and gave away to hues of pink and orange. Sufficiently intoxicated, an opportunity to inspect his foreman had rose.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Disposing of his cigarette in a nearby gutter, he peeled back his stained sleeve. Dried blood marred the pulsing mark and he murmured a wandless tergeo. It was as he expected; crossed wands, identical to Mulciber's mark. He was not as foolish to assume that this was the only significant change - make no mistake, this was not a world he was as familiar with as he once thought.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">He inspected the mark further, scouring committing every scale to memory. There had been no need to tamper with the mark before, but there was a growing curiosity within him that could not be quelled. Tampering with his mark was a death sentence in itself if the Dark Lord so discovered his meddling and the threat of discovery weighed on his mind. Thank Merlin for small mercies that he was keyed into the wards of Lucius’s study; the dark texts he possessed would prove invaluable in his search.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus knew that he must tread lightly. He could not rely on his knowledge of the past (future?) to aid him; parallels could be drawn, yet not followed. For once, he found himself at a crossroad.</p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal">Severus can only pray that when the time comes, the path he chooses will be right.</p>
