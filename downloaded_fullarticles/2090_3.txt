  <strong>June 23, 1991</strong>
</p><p>Harry woke up with a start, banging his head on the low ceiling of his cupboard. Wait…what? What was he doing back here? It really wouldn’t surprise him if this was his version of hell. Doom to live out eternity serving the Dursley. </p><p>He wordlessly cast <em>dies et tempus</em>, a handy little spell which showed the date and time to softly glow in the air. It was June 23, 1991, 6:00 am. </p><p>Harry reached for the dangling string, turning on the cupboard light. Looking at his body, he realized he was ten years old again.  Was it all an elaborate dream? If not, any minute his Aunt will be banging on the door, telling him to wake up and get breakfast.</p><p>Dudley will come pounding on the stairs, yelling at him to wake up, because they are going to the zoo. It would be Dudley’s birthday, and he would complain about getting thirty-six present this year when he received thirty-seven last year. If only it was true, but nothing good ever happens to him.</p><p>Harry went through his day in quiet shock. His dream was reliving itself down to the last detail. Harry sat in the back of the car with Dudley and Pier Polkiss, heading to the zoo. Harry realized this might be his chance to change the way his life was heading.</p><p>Perhaps this time he might be able to save the others, to save himself. This time Harry spoke quietly to the snake and made sure to avoid being body checked by Dudley when he saw the snake was active.</p><p>With no accidental magic, the trip to the zoo went quietly, not that Harry avoided being starved, his Uncle found any reason to beat and starve him.</p><p>The next day during his housekeeping chores, Harry pilfered a discarded notebook, along with some sharpened pencils. Hiding them in his cupboard until later that night. It would be five more weeks until his birthday, which means, his Hogwarts letter would soon arrive.</p><p>He marveled that he retained his memories of what will happen, realizing it was better to write down the most important details he needed to remember. Primarily, he… Harry Potter, was a Horcrux, and there were five other Horcruxes he would need to find before dealing with Nagini and Voldemort.</p><p>He would also need to get into the chamber of secrets in his first year, to talk some sense into the basilisk, perhaps he can avert that mess that was the second year before it starts.</p><p>There was also scabbers/Peter Pettigrew to deal with, plus also getting his godfather Sirius Black free from Azkaban. There was so much he had to do, how did he accomplish all this crap in the first place! Most of it, he should deal with as it comes up, like that Umbitch.</p><p>Harry also made a note to find Lord Riddle’s bones, and get rid of them. Not that he planned to let himself be entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but better safe than sorry. He argued with himself whether he should let himself be put into Slytherin, or stay in Gryffindor.</p><p>It still would mean dealing with Draco, but it also meant he would be able to get closer to Professor Snape. He would have to think on that a bit more.</p><p>The philosopher stone was not that big of a deal as they made it out to be the last time around. There was no way for the Voldemort possessed Quirrell to get the stone out of the Mirror of Erised, perhaps this year he will focus more on his studies, he needed a better grounding in spell casting.</p><p>While he was sure he would seek out Hermione as a friend, Ron was still up in the air. Perhaps their friendship will be much smoother, with all the changes. Harry closed his eyes, trying to remember if he missed anything important that needed to be dealt with soon.</p><p>If things go per the last schedule, he would have a month between his shopping trip in Diagon Alley and when school began. If he came back here his school things would be locked up and he would spend a month doing more chores than Merlin could count.</p><p>He could spend the month at The Leaky Cauldron, but that could get expensive. He would have to think about that more clearly. He would need to spend at least a week, getting more supplies than the first time around, including a second untraceable wand.  He looked at his notes, making changes on what he thought should be a top priority. </p><ul>

</ul><p>Quidditch is out, he had far more important things he needed to concentrate on, and while flying was fun and all, it won’t help him greatly in the fight to come. He could always buy a Firebolt when it’s all over. On a clean notebook page, he made a list of the additional books he would need to buy.</p><ul>

</ul><p>Harry stopped writing, his list longer than he intended, but necessary, there were many things he knew he had gotten wrong, and many people he had unintentional offended.</p><p>There weren’t any books on Wizarding Culture, as it was something learned from your parents and family, of which he had none. The Victorian books came close enough, it would not hurt at least, the rest he must learn along the way.</p><p>The <em>Magick Moste Evile</em> and <em>Secrets of the Darkest Art</em> he would have to check Borgin and Burkes for, or at least see if they can find it for him. Flourish &amp; Blotts would do for the rest of the books, what could not be bought right then, could be ordered, and sent by owl.</p><p>Harry did some rough calculation, he estimated he had about 120,482 Galleons in his trust fund, or £602,410.00, by the time he died he had 319,995 Galleons, or £1,599,975.00. He knew most of that was from his inheritance from his godfather, hopefully, he can change that outcome. He would rather have Sirius in his life than the money.</p><p>Between buying school supplies, uniforms, a decent trunk with solid security—remembering all the times his trunk was broken into—the extra books, decent clothing, and getting a decent pair of contacts, he would need approximately 2,000 Galleons to cover everything and still get the quality he needed.</p><p>The <em>Magick Moste Evile</em> and <em>Secrets of the Darkest Art</em>, the trunk and possibly his second wand would be the most expensive items he bought. He also knew from experience that Headmaster Dumbledore would always send him back here unless he somehow could get Sirius declared innocent. </p><p>If he could keep a low profile until the letter came and hide it before Dudley can snatch it, he could send his response back and ask for assistance in shopping. He would post the letter from his neighbor Ms. Bride Duibhshíth mailbox.</p><p>A little old lady, who was always kind to him, and the only one in the neighborhood that never believed all the lies about him. Ms. Duffy, as she once told him to call her as it was easier to pronounce for a small child, welcomed him into her home, always had a kind word, warm food, and a tender hand caring for his hurts.</p><p>Harry would live with her if only he was allowed. The Dursely hated her because she was old and not the most beautiful. What she lacked on the outside, she more than made up for on the inside. To repay her kindness, Harry always tried to do small jobs around her house, that she could never manage.</p><p>He would sneak over there whenever he could, mostly when he was locked out of the house. Ms. Duffy always told him there was a season for everything, and one day his season of change will come. He wondered if this was his season of change, being sent back.</p><p>Harry had some time before his letter arrived, he planned to make the most of it helping his friend as much as he could. The last time, with all the disruption, he was unable to see her and left without saying goodbye.</p><p>When he came back for summer, she was no longer next door. It was getting late, and Aunt Petunia will wake him early to make breakfast, Harry closed the notebook, he now has at least a tentative plan to work with, he closed his eyes and fell into a light sleep.</p><p>

</p><p>It was morning already, arriving sooner than Harry could have wanted. He was up making breakfast for a small army, knowing none would be left for him. His stomach was beyond complaining, being used to the lack of food on a long-term basis.</p><p>The Dursley will be gone all day and left a chore list only a half mile long. There no way he could finish everything, and still visit Ms. Duffy. It was days like this he wished he had learned wandless magic so he could finish his chores when no one was around.</p><p>He looked at the list, he was going to get punished no matter what, and if that was the case, Harry finished the dishes and ran over to Ms. Duffy’s house, knocking on her door loudly, the dear old lady was a bit hard of hearing. The door opened slowly, revealing a sight that would make others run. To others, Ms. Duffy would be considered a hag, a true vision of what a witch appeared to be.</p><p>She peered at Harry out of one rummy eye, a fearsome smile widen as she cackled gleefully. Harry stepped closer, hugging her tightly, he had missed her all those years after he left.</p><p>Ms. Bride Duibhshíth wrapped her arms around the young boy, her voice deep and soft, heavy with a Scottish brogue, which only Harry ever seems to understand clearly. She drew him into her house, shutting the door softly.</p><p>“Aye a chuilein, whatna has yer so upset. Ye think ye saw a banshee the way yer holding these auld bones so tight. Come, mo leanbh. Ah am sure those dobbers didnae feed ye again. Aye, I ken sum scran will a dae you sum good.” She ran her wrinkled fingers through Harry’s messy hair. The lad could do with a decent bath and some good food. She pushed Harry towards her bathroom, “Yer howfin mo leanbh, aff with ye for a good scrub. Leave those rags by the door, will find ye a clean goonie.”</p><p>Harry shook his head as he headed to the bathroom, he would have felt offended, if it was not a normal occurrence whenever he managed to get over here. Harry opened the cupboard under the sink and pulled out the basket Ms. Duffy stored there for him.</p><p>It was filled with bath bombs, bubble baths, body washes, facial washes, shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, and hair custards, body sprays, deodorants, and colognes. Harry chuckled, she went shopping again, there were things he would never have gotten at the Dursley’s.  Searching through his bath treasure trove, he saw that she bought two sets, one in a variety of mint, and the other citrus.</p><p>She had also replaced his toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash, he was finally going to enjoy a thoroughly cleansing bath. Turning on the hot water tap, he added two zingy lemongrass fizzers, plus a good scoop of Epsom salt. While the bath filled, he arranged the other items needed for his bath nearby.</p><p>Harry crumbled a bubble bar called <em>Brightside</em> under the running tap and added <em>You’ve Been Mangoed</em> bath oil, the smell of citrus and lemongrass intensified filling the bath with luxurious bubbles. He turned on the cold water to cool down the bath enough for him slide in. </p><p>It’s been a long time since he had a hot bath, he soaked, letting his body warm up before reaching for the ocean salt scrub to wash the grime embedded in his skin. Harry smiled, Ms. Duffy always tried to spoil him, his skin felt so soft after using the scrub. It felt wonderful to have clean hair again, he thought as he washed then conditioned it. </p><p>He just felt so much…lighter! Letting the water out of the tub, he gave himself a quick rinse under the shower, before cleaning out the bathtub. Wrapping a warm fluffy towel around himself, he dried his hair, using the hair mustard to tame it somewhat, the facial wash to scrubbed his face. Lastly, he cleaned his teeth and freshened his breath. He wondered where she bought his bath supplies, he would love to take them to Hogwarts.</p><p>Harry opened the door to find an old fashion nightgown hanging on the doorknob, he smiled as he slipped on the softest cotton gown he has ever felt. Making sure he left the bathroom cleaned, he padded into the living room, where a tea tray waited laden with biscuits and tea.</p><p>A tray sat to one side, a bowl filled with steaming scotch broth and warm fresh baked brown bread. Harry poured Ms. Duffy a cup of Scottish breakfast, the only kind of tea she preferred, adding a splash of milk and two sugars. </p><p>He served her first before fixing his own cup, he preferred more milk in his as the tea was much stronger than the English breakfast, stirring two sugars into his tea before taking a most welcomed sip. Harry placed a cushion on the floor, getting comfortable before the coffee table to tuck into his bowl of soup.</p><p>There was more broth than meat and veg, he didn’t complain as he knew his stomach couldn’t handle much solid food right now. Ms. Duffy made the most delicious soup and the best homemade bread!</p><p>Bride sank into her cozy armchair, sipping her tea as she watched over her adopted child. It warmed her heart to see him relaxed. She sighed, at most, she can hide him here for a few days before they miss their unwilling slave, having to do for themselves that long was beyond the dobbers.</p><p>At least, she will be able to get some good food into the boy. They sat talking about inconsequential nonsense, sharing quiet laughter. Harry told her about possibly going to a boarding school, his parents had applied to when he was born but shared that he did not think the Dursely would allow him to go.</p><p>The old woman cackled, her one good eye twinkling, she quickly made the plan that if he could do his school shopping, in lieu of returning to that hell, he can stay with her until school started. She would make arrangement to get him there, he can be sure of that.  </p><p>Bride knew this would be the last time she would see him once he left for school. She would make the most of it, she estimated her savings, she planned to make sure Harry had some basic essential, and leave the rest to him once she was gone. Perhaps if she could speak to whoever came to take Harry school shopping, she could have them arrange a bank account for Harry, that he could draw from.</p><p>Bride sat in thought, as Harry gathered the dirty dishes, taking them to the kitchen to be washed. Later he curled up on the sofa, reading one of his favorite books, as Bride nodded off in her chair.</p>
