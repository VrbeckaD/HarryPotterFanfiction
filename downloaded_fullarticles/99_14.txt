    <p>Alucard followed after his father, Dracula, eagerly rereading the letter he had been sent by Professor Macha Ní Rioghain, the Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was difficult to say who had been the most surprised by the letter, but his father, who had initially been opposed to idea, was eventually won over by his mother, Lisa.</p><p> </p><p>“Think of all the amazing things you could learn, Alucard,” she whispered in awe, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “Imagine it! You could expand on everything I’ve thought you! A whole new world is opening right before your eyes. You can’t waste an opportunity like this!”</p><p> </p><p>At first, his father had completely opposed the idea, insisting that he would not let him go. His distrust was immediately apparent as he ripped up the letter addressed to Alucard before he even had a chance to read it. Alucard overheard him muttering to his mother about how they must have placed their trust in the wrong vampire, as no one should be able to send letters to them. However, the following morning, another letter appeared, resulting in his father moving the castle to an entire new country. But even after that, another letter appeared, causing Dracula to consider the possibility that they perhaps were not dealing with a trap orchestrated by rogue vampires as he’d initially thought.</p><p> </p><p>His arguments against Alucard going got gradually weaker and weaker. When it became apparent that magic really was involved, he’d suggested that perhaps one of the vampire hunter families had recruited magic users and were attempting to steal Alucard away to blackmail him. But when Lisa pointed out that this wizarding school called Hogwarts was mentioned in several books in his personal library, he began to falter, struggling to come up with another excuse.</p><p> </p><p>“See here!” shouted Dracula, pointing at the bottom of the letter. “It says here that students may bring an owl, a cat or a toad. There’s no mention of swans at all. What will we do? Alucard will be devastated if he can’t bring his pet swan along! Won’t you, boy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not particu-“</p><p> </p><p>“See? There are tears welling up in his eyes at the thought of it! You’ll see, these magic types are not understanding of our kind. Just watch: I’ll write and say that swans are an important part of vampire culture, and all of a sudden, they won’t want you to come!”</p><p> </p><p>At this point, Alucard felt a twang of disappointment. Eventually he had been allowed to read his letter, but it didn’t make much sense to him. A school of Witchcraft and Wizardry? Was he capable of doing magic? However, his initial confusion over the letter began to change to curiosity, and, with the encouragement and support from his mother, it eventually turned to enthusiasm. But perhaps his father was right. This was a school for witches and wizards. What place did a half-vampire like him have?</p><p> </p><p>A big place, apparently. Not a day had passed since Dracula had sent off his long letter of complaint when a reply appeared, just as mysteriously as the other letters. This time, it was addressed to Dracula, rather than Alucard. Both Alucard and his mother read over Dracula’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dear Count Dracula Vlad Tepes,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you for your quick response.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can assure you that your son, Alucard, will be very welcome at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Our school boasts of its diversity, and welcomes those from all different backgrounds and heritages, including giants, muggle-borns (children of non-wizarding folk), veela, werewolves and, our most recent addition: vampires.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>As Alucard will be our first student of vampire heritage, we ask for your understanding and guidance, so that we can make the necessary adjustments to make your son feel at home. I thoroughly enjoyed reading your letter, and took note of all points relating to vampire culture. We will make adjustments as necessary.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>As for the swan, we will be able to accommodate your wishes. Please check your son’s letter once more.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Kindest regards,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Professor Macha Ní Rioghain</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Headmistress</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Check your son’s letter?” read Lisa aloud, as though she was asking the letter to confirm what it meant. She wandered over to the desk and pulled it from the drawer, carefully unfolding it. With a gasp, the letter fell to the floor. Both Alucard and Dracula rushed over, their eyes darting as they read the new addition to the bottom of the letter.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Students may also bring an owl OR a car OR a toad. <u>Those of vampire descent may also bring a swan.</u></em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Incredible!” whispered Lisa in disbelief. “I’ve never even heard of this kind of magic before… have you darling?”</p><p> </p><p>To Alucard’s surprise, Dracula shook his head. He looked almost as impressed as Lisa, but there was still concern on his face. But at this point, Alucard, who had never seen anything as impressive in his eleven years on earth, was sold.</p><p> </p><p>“WOW! How did she do that? Will I be able to do that? I want to learn magic! Can I go, Dad? Please please please please?”</p><p> </p><p>Dracula and Lisa exchanged looks. Lisa smiled at Dracula. Her infectious smile spread to his lips and, slowly, he nodded his head.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>All of a sudden, Dracula came to a stop. Alucard had been so engrossed in rereading the letter that he almost walked into him. They were standing outside of a pub called <em>The Leaky Cauldron</em>. Despite his father hiding his appearance with a long cloak, several people were shooting him odd looks. Together, the two headed inside the pub.</p><p> </p><p>“I have come to bring my son to Diagon Alley,” announced Dracula in a booming voice upon entering the pub. The entire room fell silent. Alucard shrank with embarrassment: why couldn’t his father have just quietly asked someone? But to Alucard’s surprise, someone stepped forward and addressed his father: a man with long wavy black hair. There were several scars across his face, giving him the appearance of some kind of warrior.</p><p> </p><p>“Another first year?” asked the man with a smile. “I’d be happy to help. I am Professor Oisín Mac an tSionnaigh, and I teach Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts. You can call me Oisín. I was just about to bring young Trevor here to get his wand. You could join us if you’d like.”</p><p> </p><p>Alucard eagerly stepped forward, but his father put a hand on his shoulder, forcibly holding him back. It took a second for Alucard to figure out what was wrong. His father was glaring at the disheveled-looking boy standing behind Oisín. The boy didn’t even look up at the mention of his name. His long, ragged hair looked as though it hadn’t seen a trim in years, and his dirty and torn clothes gave the impression that Oisín had just pulled him out of a hole in the ground. However, when Alucard looked closely, he spotted a crest on the boy’s shirt that he had seen somewhere before.</p><p> </p><p>“A Belmont,” hissed Dracula, clutching Alucard’s shoulder tightly. “This boy is a Belmont, a family of vampire hunters. I will not have you associate with his kind, Alucard.”</p><p> </p><p>Alucard stayed silent. After all, what could he say? Trevor, the boy in the dirty clothes, glanced up. His eye’s met Dracula, and they widened with fear. He quickly looked at the floor again, hiding even more-so than he had been behind Oisín.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, now, there’s no need to cause rivalry between the boys, we’ll have plenty of that when the Quidditch season starts,” laughed Oisín nervously. Even Alucard could see the fear in his eyes. “Well, let’s make haste! There’s a lot to be done! I’ll take Trevor to get his wand, perhaps your son would like to check out the book shop? There’s so much beyond what’s on the reading list…”</p><p> </p><p>Oisín trailed off. But luckily for Alucard, his father seemed to have composed himself. He nodded silently and followed Oisín and the boy out a back door, not removing his hand from Alucard’s shoulder. Alucard had been eager to meet other students. But he knew better than to defy his father. Without a word, Alucard watched in awe as the bricks of the wall in the back began to magically move by themselves, revealing the breath-taking street behind it.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome to Diagon Alley,” smiled Oisín, pleased by everyone’s equally shocked expressions.</p>
