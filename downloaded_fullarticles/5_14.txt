    <p>The room was bristling with a sort of seething prickliness. The faces were stony at first glance, but there was violence chafing beneath the surface of every blank, court-appropriate mask. Long had the Wizarding World awaited the trial of Severus Snape. </p><p>So united in rage was the room that the shuffling rows of witches and wizards seemed like one, faceless beast, a festering crowd hungry for the thought of some justice. In the first row sat Dumbledore, looking uncharacteristically grave. Beside him sat apprentice Cornelius Fudge, whose violently orange bowler hat seemed out of place in the grim setting. Clustered around them were a series of reporters, anxiously anticipating <em>his</em> arrival.</p><p>Behind them were the witnesses. Lily Potter sat perfectly straight. Her red hair was pulled back more severely than it had ever been, her face a set of cold lines. All the expected warmth and compassion seemed to have been purged from her in preparation for the trial. She did not glance at any of the other Aurors, not even her husband, staring straight ahead. Cameras flashed as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin arrived and approached their space upon the bench. Sirius had moulded his face into the expected solemnity, but his eyes held a deepset loathing that was noticeable even amongst all the hatred in the room. Lily muttered a greeting to them out of the corner of her mouth. </p><p>The judge's name was Agrippina Selwyn, a tall old witch with a glittering black shawl draped over her robes. She wore mauve lipstick on thin lips and had a very narrow nose. When she called the room to order, it was in a hoarse, deep voice. </p><p>"Please escort in the prisoner."</p><p>Severus Snape was wearing grimy black robes. His hair hung in thick strips of dark grease, and his skin was pale and sweaty. Despite his appearance, he wore an expression of dull contempt that twisted into an outright sneer at the outburst of photographs. His eyes slid over the audience once - resting, if only for a few moments, on Lily - and then focused on Judge Selwyn. </p><p>"Severus Snape," she said. Her voice was harsh and booming. He said nothing, so she moved briskly on. </p><p>"You stand accused of serving the Dark Lord. How do you respond to this claim?"</p><p>"I-" Snape rolled the word in his mouth as if it was particularly distasteful - "<em>plead</em> guilty."</p><p>Whispers began like furious winds.</p><p>"And in the service of the Dark Lord, you were a primary participant in murder and torture?"</p><p>"I was."</p><p>The sounds rose.</p><p>"And in fact, were responsible for inventing some of the potions and spells used in these incidents?"</p><p>"Indeed." </p><p>"To Azkaban!" a man roared. There were shout of assent.</p><p>"And it was by your persuasion that the Longbottom family were attacked, resulting in the deaths of Frank and Alice Longbottom and Neville Longbottom becoming the charge of his grandmother?"</p><p>"I persuaded the Dark Lord of it, yes."</p><p>There did not seem to be a silent person in the courtroom now. Snape looked bored and a little glassy, as if he were mentally somewhere else. Judge Selwyn sent an angry white spark from her wand, which banged furiously and effectively silenced the room.</p><p>"I understand that this is an emotional case," she said, her raspy voice made rougher in her indignation, "and that the newspapers-" (she shot the crowd of reporters a cool look) - "have greatly sensationalised this man and his character-"</p><p>Augusta Longbottom rose to her feet, face taut in fury. She was dressed in a fine mountain of black mourning robes, which served to make Snape's look particularly filthy. "It sound as if you are suggesting that we are responding not to his blatant admission of his heinous crimes, but to the manipulation of media outlets, Judge Selwyn," she said, voice quivering in indignation.</p><p>"I take it," said Judge Selwyn, "that this trial will not become a performance of personal offence, Augusta. Even though-" and her voice was gentler - "it may surround personal matters."</p><p>Silenced, but hawk-like eyes still fixed on the accused, Augusta sat. </p><p>Judge Selwyn beckoned a man forward and so he came, carrying a large pot. It was, as Rita Skeeter eagerly scribbled down, a Court Pensieve, used only in the highest of high profile cases. Many of the audience leaned eagerly forward as it was placed on the table: it was not a common object. </p><p>A Ministry official to the left of Judge Selwyn came importantly forward and tapped the pot with his wand. The liquid inside began to spill out. It was silver and oddly viscuous, a moth-eaten black around the edges, and like some ghastly bacterial colony, it seemed to grow around reality until it itself gave way. It was with a shaken demeanour that the audience found themselves in a small, dark, stone room.</p><p>Lord Voldemort sat before them in a chair. His features were barely human, bone white and seemingly melting into the porous, waxy surface of his skin. His eyes were a vehement red and cruelly intelligent. </p><p>
  <em>"Severus," he said, and it was not a question.</em> The audience started; they had not seen Snape arrive yet. He slunk in, out of the shadows.
</p><p>
  <em>"My lord," he responded. There was a deferential tone to his voice that was hard to attribute to the complacent, sneering man in front of them, but he did not seem a cowering servant, either. "I wish to discuss the prophecy that I reported to you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort laughed. It was high and cold. Snape simply waited.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Nothing escapes you, does it, Severus?" The snake around his feet slowly unwound, fixing blank, yellow eyes on the Death Eater. "Almost as if you are a Dark Lord yourself ... finding secrets ... filching memories ... tell me, who is it that can lie to Severus Snape? Can Lord Voldemort?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I am the Dark Lord's servant," Snape replied. He was keeping a watchful eye on Nagini.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort snarled. "That is not what I asked, Snape."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I should not think that the Dark Lord has reason to lie, but to tell at his own discretion, as is only fitting of your status. I am your servant. I do not question-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Quite right," Voldemort hissed viciously, effectively cutting Snape off, "yet you know of things you should know not! Well come, then, Snape! Let me hear your counsel ... you know of the Potters... you know of the Longbottoms." Fury forgotten, his voice became contemplative. "I am partial to the Potter boy, myself."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"A half-blood, my Lord," said Snape. "Surely-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You yourself are a half-blood, are you not?" said Voldemort dangerously.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Indeed," said Snape. "And I am not your equal."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The fire spat, clawing upwards in suddenly black flame. Nagini hissed warningly.</em>
</p><p>"No <em>man is the Dark Lord's equal!" Voldemort hissed.</em></p><p>
  <em>Snape lowered his head in assent. "I merely meant, my Lord, that if the prophecy is true, then the boy may be the closest wizard to your equal that could ever exist."</em>
</p><p>The audience considered in a series of rustling whispers. Of course, they had all heard … Neville Longbottom …</p><p>
  <em>"Indeed," said Voldemort petulantly, and now he sounded sullen. It was more worrying than the rage. "I am glad you understand the severity, Severus, very glad indeed ... just recently, dear Lucius had to face the wrath of my wand. He is in such a deep bow he cannot see what is in front of him. In such awe of my power is he, he does not consider that it might be rivalled ... but no. No, I shall trust the stars. This is indeed a threat, and it will be treated accordingly ..."</em>
</p><p>

 <em>His voice tailed away from that train of thought. "Why is it that you object to the Potter boy?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"His mother is a Mudblood," said Snape carelessly, "and grew less impressive as she grew older."</em>
</p><p>
Lily flinched. It didn't go unnoticed by James, who placed a shaking hand on her shoulder.
</p><p>
<em>"It is a pattern they often follow. But the Longbottoms are a well-respected family, and their power is great. As the prophecy has told, they have already challenged my Lord three times-"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"One of my servants did speak to me, Snape," interrupted Voldemort silkily, "and suggest that you have an emotional attachment to the Potters."</em>
</p><p>
<em>There was a silence. And then,</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I hope it was not the rat."</em>
</p><p>
 <em>"Indeed it was." Voldemort sounded amused.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Snape glared, undoubtedly ready to launch into a tirade, and then he gasped.</em>
</p><p>
 "What's happening?" Rita asked avidly. She had two quills out now, both scrawling on separate rolls of parchment. Her vicious excitement seemed uncouth amongst the vehement focus in the room.
 </p><p>
"The Dark Lord is invading Severus' mind," said Dumbledore. You could have wrung his voice of sorrow.
</p><p>
<em>Snape was panting on the floor by the time Voldemort had finished. He rose up unsteadily, trying to reassert his composed posture.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"My Lord?" he said at last.</em>
  </p><p>
<em>When the Dark Lord spoke, he sounded more human than they had heard him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"We shall go to the Longbottoms."</em>


</p><p>
 Being discharged from the memory was a discomforting experience. There was a moment in which it seemed that nothing at all was real. The whispers rose again. The way <em>he</em> had approached <em>Voldemort</em> - his composure when speaking to the Dark Lord - the subtle suggestions that his power was great enough to worry You-Know-Who himself - the extraordinary amount of license he had been given - what He Who Must Not Be Named might have seen in his mind!

It took several bangs from Judge Selwyn's wand to quiet the court. Rita's acid green quills were scratching into the parchment very eagerly. Remus attempted to murmur something to Lily, but she shook it off like a spider. Her eyes were burning.
</p><p>
Veritaseum was handed to Snape. He looked mildly irritated but drank it. The crowd immediately began to volunteer questions that his now addled mind could not comprehend. He stared ahead, waiting.
</p><p>
Judge Selwyn once again had to use her wand to silence them.
</p><p>
"We have a list of prepared questions," she snapped, "which should hopefully satisfy. If not, the court may pose questions in an <em>orderly</em> fashion at the end."
</p><p>
It was the man to the right of Judge Selwyn that spoke first. "What was it that was seen in your mind that convinced the Dark Lord to attack the Longbottoms?"
</p><p>
"Memories of Lily and James Potter," Snape responded dully. 
</p><p>
"And how was that <em>relevant,</em> Mr Snape?" Judge Selwyn boomed down at him.
</p><p>
"He suspected that I was advocating against attacking the Potters because I cared for them. At school, I frequently suffered at the hands of James Potter and his friends."
</p><p>
Remus looked guilty; the others did not. Lily shifted.
</p><p>
"My only emotions towards him are a strong hatred."
</p><p>
"And Lily Potter?" the Ministry man pressed.
</p><p>
"I buried all affection and happy memories of her behind Leglimency shields. He was only able to witness our relationship falling apart and the negative emotions surrounding that."
</p><p>
"Did you convince him to attack the Longbottoms because you care for Lily Potter?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
Rita gasped out loud. Lily went very white.
</p><p>
"Did you serve the Dark Lord willingly?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"Why?" called out Rita Skeeter, rabid in her glee. The reporters squawked their appreciation like vultures, cameras flashing again.
</p><p>
"I thought, for some time, that I might feel a sense of kinship or comradery with the Death Eaters. When Lily abandoned me, most of the people I could turn to for friendship were embedded in the Dark Arts and pureblood ideology. It was not true. There was no love between us, only suspicion and competition. But by then, the Dark Lord had recognised my talent. I was able to pursue my skill in ways I had not before."
</p><p>
Even under the Veritaseum, Snape's face had twisted into a sick, longing smile.
</p><p>
"Someone - someone powerful - thought I was <em>useful."</em>
</p><p>
 Judge Selwyn looked down her nose in undisturbed contempt, but the man next to her appeared conflicted. There were faces around the room, beginning to exchange glances and shift in cunning. Everybody had heard the rumours, of course, but this sickening insecurity presented new opportunities.
</p><p>
Of course, there was <em>use</em> to Severus Snape, and now it appeared that he was all too willing to be used.</p>
