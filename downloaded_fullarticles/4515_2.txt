    <p>DISCLAIMER: These are not my toys. These lovely characters belong to J K Rowling. I’m just playing with them.</p><p> </p><p>Author’s Note: Hey!! This is the revised version of this story. I plan to delete the other version from FFN.</p><p>Update 7/1/17 I changed this chapter a bit. I wanted to introduce some things sooner than I originally did.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Fog. Endless fog that I can barely see through. It’s kind of peaceful but super creepy at the same time. I can’t tell exactly where I am but from the thick grass underneath my bare feet, my guess is a field somewhere. It’s not cold, thankfully since all I have on is a nightgown and a satin robe. There is no wind. Just thick fog. I start walking, cautiously, in search of something. I don’t know what exactly I’m looking for but I am sure I will know when I find it. Brushing my hair out of my face, I walk a little faster. Am I the only one out here? “Hello?” I call out. There is no answer. I shake my head in frustration and continue searching. I look all around for anything. There is a tree up ahead, I run towards it, which proves to be a mistake because I trip and –</em>

</p><p>“Ow!” I rub the back of my head as I sit up from falling out of the bed, taking my royal blue fleece blanket with me. I sat there rubbing my head trying to think my way through the dream I had. What is the point of it? Why do I keep having it? I quickly get off the floor and move to my desk. It is the best place for me to think while I am at home. I remember begging my parents for a desk of my own when I decided to rearrange my childhood room. It was a cherry oak wood desk with more storage than one would think. Magic can be such an incredible thing. I moved aside my smoothie than my mother brought up earlier, it was melted, and the uneaten turkey and swiss sandwich with crisps, maybe I would eat that later. Pulling out the brand-new notebook I bought earlier that day I quickly wrote out my dream. Underneath the description, I made a line to separate the dream from the notes I was about to take. I reached in the bag of books I hadn’t put away yet and pulled out a muggle dream dictionary. Flipping through it to the F section I found the entry on fog.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Fog in dreams symbolizes practical work and energy. If you have this dream you must work hard. You need to make the effort to achieve the best you can. This dream also suggests that things in life may not be what they seem. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I hate divination,” I muttered still taking notes. This was not something I could ignore any longer. I had this dream multiple times a week and I was tired of it. Maybe it is a sign, not that I believe in anything as flimsy and ridiculous as that. If anything, it was a clue to something more substantial. There was a reason I was cursed with this dream and I was going to figure it out.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Another possibility is that the fog is an image of what is still unknown or hidden in you- your unconscious, and anything looming out of it is what is emerging into awareness. People in fog are often said to be trying to find their way home.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>BUZZ “This is ridiculous.” I push my hair out of my face and pick up my phone, glad for the distraction. “Hello.” I put it on speaker so I could still write if something came to me.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, I can’t take it anymore.” Harry’s voice came through the speaker.</p><p> </p><p>“If you are going to start talking about Ginny again I may drive over there and smack you in the face.” As glad as I was for the distraction, Harry and Ginny and their relationship troubles were driving me crazy this summer. He called to whine about her shutting him out after he broke up with her for her safety and she wrote to me to complain about how unfair it was that Harry thought she couldn’t take care of herself.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“You are my best friend. Who else am I supposed to talk to?” he complained.</p><p> </p><p>The Boy who Lived everybody. I roll my eyes. “Harry, I love you, I really do. So, let me break this down for you one more time. I have studying to get back to.  It's okay, Ginny will understand eventually. You must give her time to accept this. Then she will realize that you did it for her and not to hurt her." I tried to console him over the phone. I had been listening to him complain about this for a couple weeks. Thank Merlin it was the end of the summer. I moved to my bed to lay down while I was talking to him. It was hot and humid and I was lying with my head hanging off the bed, right in front of a fan with my cell phone on speaker. Since I wasn’t doing anything but listening to him, I looked around my room and noticed that it was a disaster. I was in the middle of packing, so clothes were everywhere. My books were scattered from the studying I was doing earlier. I was finishing up some extra reading for potions, it was my hardest class because Snape hated us. His hate fueled my determination to get perfect marks.</p><p> </p><p>"No, she won't Hermione. She sent me a letter that said not to come to the Burrow for a couple weeks because she wouldn't be able to handle being around me. If she understands, she wouldn't have said that. I love her Hermione, but I can't have anything happen to her just because she's with me. If Voldemort finds out she's one of my weaknesses, he'll use her as bait to get me and she could end up killed and then where would we be? I will not let her become a martyr for the cause of this war. Believe it or not, this is my war. I don't even want to you involved."</p><p> </p><p>I sat up abruptly, almost dropping my phone. "Harry!"</p><p> </p><p>"No, Hermione. I didn't say you wouldn't be involved because I know you already are. Voldemort already knows you're my best friend, but he doesn't know about me and Ginny. And I would like to keep it that way. But she's so damn stubborn. We start school in a week and I haven't been to the Burrow even once this summer. Not once. I don't want her to feel uncomfortable, so I’m abiding by her wishes. I don't know how this trip to Diagon Alley is going to go." He sighed. "Speaking of our trip, have you gotten your letter from Hogwarts yet? Aren't they normally here by now?"</p><p> </p><p>"You noticed that too?" I got up and made my way over to the window to look for an owl. "I thought I was alone in that worry, I brought it up to Ron when I owled him last week but he didn't even mention it in his owl back. Maybe Dumbledore is just playing around with us; you know he's the most brilliant wizard of our time but he's a little off his rocker at times."</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed. "I know. Actually-" I heard some rustling. "I just got mine."</p><p> </p><p>"No fair! I NEED mine. I need to know if I'm Head Girl or not." I started to pace. "What if I didn't get it? What if it's Hannah Abbott?"</p><p> </p><p>"You know you got it, Hermione. I don't know why you stress over that. You've always gotten the highest marks in our class and you know it."</p><p> </p><p>"I wonder who's Head Boy."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, we know it's not me, Dumbledore probably thinks I've got too much to worry about. You know, with trying to stay alive and keep all of you alive as well."</p><p> </p><p>"Let's be honest, it's me keeping you and Ron alive." I laughed "And it's definitely not Ron. I keep hoping the two of you will learn to take notes and to study."</p><p> </p><p>"Hopefully it's not that git Malfoy."</p><p> </p><p>I could almost feel Harry's anger at Malfoy through the phone. I laughed. "Calm down tiger. Besides, don't jinx it. The last thing I need is to have to share quarters with Ferretboy."</p><p> </p><p>"If it is him, Mione, just say the word and I'll-"</p><p> </p><p>I cut him off. "You'll do what? Get more distracted from your school work? Get in trouble over something that's a waste of time when you are supposed to be figuring out how to defeat Voldemort?" I sigh. "Look, Harry, I don't want to get into this, are you going to open your letter or not?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah." I heard him opening his letter.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry? Why did you get so quiet?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Quidditch Captain." He whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Quidditch Captain!" he said a little bit louder, still in shock.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh Harry, that's wonderful! Your father would've been so proud. You're following his legacy!"</p><p> </p><p>"I know. I wish Sirius was still here so I could owl him and say just that."</p><p> </p><p>"Aww Harry. Let's go celebrate after we do our school shopping tomorrow."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay. You know my birthday is tomorrow too. We've got a lot to celebrate; me being captain, me being seventeen and NEVER having to return to this hellhole the Dursley's call home, us going back to school-"</p><p> </p><p>An owl flew through my window and dropped an envelope on my lap. I quickly opened it.</p><p>"And me being Head Girl," I whispered.</p>
