    <p>"What the hell is your <em>problem</em>, kora!? This guy will be a useful informant, so why the <em>fuck</em> are you so against him!? Is it just because he's a civilian, or is there something you're not telling us, kora!?"</p><p>Colonello's demands, slamming his palm into the rough oak of the table, his eyes narrowed and- for once- observant.</p><p>They had been in the midst of the Annual Arcobaleno meeting, where they discussed new missions, possible new contacts, and other Arcobaleno-related business. It had started with Kawahira's first meeting, and as dreadful as that had been, Luce had insisted they continue to meet, and unfortunately the Sky could be very persuasive. They're currently voting on a large, English twenty-something who had somehow landed a CEO position already, and his pending position as a regular informant. Colonello had suggested him, actually, having used the guy once or twice before, and having suitable blackmail against him- apparently he had abused his younger cousin when he was younger or something, and his parents were already in jail or the very same reason. Colonello had promised, quite grimly, that the same fate could very easily await the guy.</p><p>However, Colonello is quick to notice and almost <em>quicker</em> to point out, every time the guy's name- one <em>Dudley Dursley</em>- is mentioned, Skull tightens his fists until his knuckles bleed white, every very good and well-founded point that Colonello makes is instantly brushed aside- <em>dismissed!- </em>by the stuntman, who is then softly supported by Luce. At this point it's a matter of pride for Colonello- he can't allow the wimpy civilian to say his decision-making skills are untrustworthy, because where does <em>that</em> leave him in terms of gaining respect from sweet-hearted, strong-willed Luce, or <em>insufferably</em> smug Reborn? Unfortunately for the CEDEF soldier, they've long ago enforced the rule that the decision to either hire or not hire a staff member (assassins, informants, even <em>cleaners</em>) had to be unanimous <em>in favor </em>of hiring before any money was to be exchanged or any offer was to be made. In fact, the other are <em>all</em> feeling quite irate with the Cloud; as normally he could be easily persuaded to agree with anything. Skull bites his lip, hard, anxiously chewing on the tacky chain connecting his lip to his ear. Colonello focuses his hatred in on it, and without realizing it grips his rifle under the table. His finger twitches on the trigger, and he absently wonders how quickly Skull, with his miraculous healing rates, can heal from a shattered kneecap or two.</p><p>"Sorry." The word cuts through his mood, and he eyes Skull with confusion. The Cloud relaxes tightly-clenched fists, his blood slowly beginning to circulate back to where had previously been milky white. He exhales deeply, a sigh that sounds tired and wrong, and just <em>that</em> (never mind that he, the ever-egotistical nuisance that was <em>Skull de Mort</em>, had <em>apologized</em>) didn't quite sit right with the other Arcobaleno.</p><p>Skull is <em>meant</em> to be childish and carefree, it's his base personality.</p><p>But this teenager (barely even a man) in front of them has dark rings under his eyes badly concealed by makeup, and his hair is untamed, and his Flame sits <em>wrong</em> under his skin. "I just-" he cuts himself off, furrowing his brow. "I happen to <em>know</em> he was... He's likely to betray us- or become a nuisance." Skull did not specify whether that nuisance would be negative or not, but the comment on <em>traitors</em> paired with Skull's unsettled Flames was enough to tell them that <em>no</em>, Skull would <em>not</em> back down from this, and <em>yes</em>, Skull knew <em>exactly</em> what he was talking about. And that is all it takes for them to drop the matter completely- in fact they're quite ready to move on. It's only the soft words (that any<em> normal</em> person probably wouldn't have been able to hear, but then the Arcobaleno aren't normal by <em>any</em> standards) that their previously-civilian Cloud Lackey murmurs that delays them in the slightest.</p><p>"Especially if he ever realized who<em> I</em> am."</p><p> Fon presses his lips together into a hard, thin line, and doggedly ignores the comment.</p><p>As with all things Skull, the others follow his lead.</p>
