<p>Perfection</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Ready?” </p>
<p>Neville, eyes closed, exhales as his jaw’s gently cupped, as a calloused thumb brushes his lower lip. He nods. The hand’s removed. </p>
<p>When something larger nudges his lips, Neville opens up, moaning as that thick cock thrusts into his mouth. “You’re perfect.” </p>
<p>Neville tries to breathe, tries to relax the back of his throat. </p>
<p>“You’re doing great, love.”</p>
<p>Neville’s heart swells at the praise. His aching jaw no longer matters. All he cares about his giving pleasure. He sucks, he swallows, he hums, and is rewarded.</p>
<p>“You really are perfect,” Kingsley whispers afterwards. </p>
<p>Neville simply smiles and curls closer. </p>
