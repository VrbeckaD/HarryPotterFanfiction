  <em>The Forbidden Forest. Hogwarts</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mudblood.</em>
</p><p><em>Filthy. Worthless. Mudblood.</em> She used to hate that word. She used to find it revolting. But when Malfoy’s scrawny half-dead body lay before her, she was amused. She bent, grabbed his dirty long blond hair and took into his filthy face. Malfoy coughed and blood sprayed from his mouth.</p><p><em>Blood</em>. Funny how it all <em>looked</em> the same, <em>smelled</em> the same, <em>felt</em> the same. Funny how all purebloods and mudbloods blended the same way, how you couldn’t distinguish whose was whose. Funny how those who met their bloody death all look equally ugly and pitiful.</p><p>That was how he looked now. <em>Helpless. Weak. Pathetic.</em> She almost felt sorry for him - <em>almost</em>. But she knew better. Death Eaters ruined her life, killed her family, friends. She <em>refused</em> to feel sorry for one of them.</p><p>Malfoy groaned again and raised his head a little. His half-closed eyes fixed on her face, his breathing laboured as he hissed through greeted teeth, “Let go of me, your filthy Mudblood”. “Why, of course, Lucius”, she laughed darkly and pointed her wand at his head. “I hope you will do well in hell”, she smirked, silently casting her the Killing curse. A bright green jet of smoky light shot from the end of her wand. She felt nothing but a thrill of satisfaction as his lifeless body dropped to the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p>She threw her head back and looked into the distance. Dozens of corpses already lay lifeless and still, left to settle into the dirt of the fields. She could barely see the Dark Lord’s figure confronting three members of the Order - Kingsley, McGonagall and Lupin. Harry and Ron were nowhere in sight. She prayed they were alive.</p><p>A familiar shout drew her attention and she turned to see Luna get hit with a green light of the Bellatrix Killing curse. Furious, Hermione tried to focus all the anger and hatred she felt towards Lestrange as she charged towards her hurling herself onto the witch back. The most painful and slowest death curse had already left her tongue as she jabbbed her wand into the witch throat.</p><p>“<em>Vindicta Infernale</em>”, she shouted, a ripple of purple-red energy seeping from her wand into the woman’s throat.</p><p>Shrinking in agony, Bellatrix tossed Hermione aside. She grunted in pain, collapsing on the ground. The infection already spread across her body as she started writhing on the floor suffering pain that no Cruciatus, however agonizing it might be, could inflict. It was slowly eating her flesh out until nothing but bones and hair were left on the ground. And <em>blood</em>.</p><p>Hermione failed to notice that people from both sides of the war stopped fighting to silently watch how Voldemort’s most faithful follower met her end with that horrifying yet magnificent curse. Everything went still.</p><p>Hermione stood up and turned around grinning madly, “What an awesome ancient spell I picked up in Tibet, don’t you think?” She titled her head, deliberately caressing her wand with the fingers of her left hand, “Maybe anyone else want to experience it?”. Half-insane glint in her eyes, her voice sweet and poisonous as she sighed mocking disappointment, “No? How utterly... <em>boring</em>”.</p><p>Hermione's sense of contentment didn't last long, however. Voldemort cried out in fury and charged her, simultaneously firing off a Killing curse towards his other opponents. Lupin’s dead body hit the ground. The fighting had regained its intensity.</p><p>One could have been intimidated by that silent dare to stand up and duel with the Darkest wizard of all time, but not Hermione. Quiet the opposite, actually - she felt excited. That Voldemort had no horcruxes up his sleeves. He was no longer invincible. She had a chance.</p><p>Even though she told herself she was perfectly calm, her heart was beating fast and her breathing increased. But once she came closer to him already lifted her wand prepared to cast, everything froze. “No, it couldn’t be...”, she muttered.</p><p>And there she heard it, the most beautiful song that couldn’t be mistaken for something else - Phoenix song. <em>Fawkes</em>? No, she must have been dreaming. What would Fawkes here in Hogwarts, when Dumbledore was dead. Why would he appear in the middle of the battle?</p><p>Time continued to be still as the Phoenix was singing in a way she never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. His lament song was still echoed in her ears as everything went blank.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Monday, September 20, 1943</p><p>Hogwarts</p><p>Tom Riddle had a lousy day. The classes were boring, students were, as usual, dull and Abraxas’ chatter made him want to curse his fellow Slytherin “friend” into oblivion.</p><p>So there he was, always a perfect Prefect, wondering in the Forbidden Forest, seeking some solitude. He had been walking silently in thick grass lost all track of time.</p><p>He was ready to return to the castle when suddenly he heard a loud CRACK followed by a bright orange light.</p><p>As his vision cleared he spotted a woman, no a girl, lying unconscious on the ground. He quickly checked if she was breathing. She appeared to be alive but still badly injured.</p><p>Her sleeveless (what?) shirt was nearly soaked all the way through with blood, her skin was shaded in red, splattered and streaked with drops and smears of crimson. He thought perhaps that most of the blood wasn't hers. In her right hand she clutched a long, dark wand; a silver chain hung around her neck, hidden underneath her shirt, resting between modest cleavage that still was quite inappropriate for daily wear.</p><p dir="ltr">When his gaze traveled up the length of her graceful neck, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that the girl’s face was  lovely, if not stunning: heart-shaped face, small but slightly up-tilted, graced with a smattering of light freckles nose, full red lips. He could not decipher the color of her eyes since they were closed, but he thought they were dark. Her hair, though matted with blood, was obviously long and curly and some shade of brown.</p><p>The most intriguing, though, was a bright orange light that flared under her skin when he touched her hair.</p><p>“What a perfect end to a perfectly lousy day”, he muttered as he gathered the girl up returning to the castle.</p>
