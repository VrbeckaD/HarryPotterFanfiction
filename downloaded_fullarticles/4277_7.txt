    <p>Hey my loves,</p><p>This is my author's note for the whole story. I know you aren't supposed to use a chapter as an author's note, but I'm making another exception like I did for The Acceptable Answer since these stories are connected.</p><p>There are a total of eight parts to this story. They are all relatively short and easy to read. I will be updating every day until it is complete. I will be posting Part 1 right after this chapter so that you can get a feel for the story.</p><p>Since this is similar to The Acceptable Answer, I will make you aware of the fact that this story is written in first person. It is also written in a diary format. Everything takes place in Daphne's point of view and looks at the aftermath of her break-up with Theo.</p><p>We will see how she copes with a large variety of things over a span of a select amount of days that she has allowed us to peek into.</p><p>This story is completely stand alone, but will make a tad more sense if you have read The Acceptable Answer.</p><p>The story is Rated M for implied sexual situations and language.</p><p>This story is self-betaed, but was originally alpha read by one of my friends. So all mistakes are my own and I apologize for them profusely.</p><p>All of the usual disclaimers apply. I don't write for profit and I certainly don't own any of these characters. J. K. Rowling is a wonderful human being for supporting fanfiction and allowing authors to express themselves with the help of her characters and the world she created.</p><p>This story really hits close to home for me and it has been a struggle to write since the beginning, but it's a story that I wanted to share.</p><p>If you are interested in checking out my other works or keeping up with me in general, I have an author's page on Facebook that you can check out (starrnobella Fanfiction) as well as a group (starrnobella Fanfiction Friends &amp; Fans) that I am very active in on a daily basis. I'm also on tumblr (starrnobella) that you can follow along with me as well.</p><p>Love always,</p><p>~starr</p>
