    <h3>Ch.1 The Vanishing</h3>
<p>Up in his chambers, the king paced back and forth. The dim light of a candle illuminated the room, making the shadows crawl and sway in a ghastly dance.</p>
<p>“What do you mean they can't find the boy?” The other male hung his head in shame, red locks obscuring his eyes.</p>
<p>“He...he wasn't there! Not even a body. Nothing! It's like he just vanished.” </p>
<p>The king growled, ceasing his pacing to stand in front of the only other occupant in the room.</p>
<p>“What of James and Lily?”</p>
<p>“Sir…” He paused, throat tight.</p>
<p>“Spit it out, Arthur! I need to know. Please.” </p>
<p>Arthur swallowed thickly.</p>
<p>“D...dead. They are dead.” </p>
<p>Silence filled the room; a deafening tension weighed heavy upon their their shoulders.</p>
<p>"Who?” His voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>“A rouge veela sir... presumably unmated.”</p>
<p>"A veela? Have they not gone extinct? Well if that's the case is her identity known?”</p>
<p>“He. The veela was a male.” </p>
<p>"I’ve never known of a male veela,” the king sighed deeply. “Are they absolutely sure it was not a vampire?” Arthur gave a hesitant nod.</p>
<p>“From the description of the... incident he was undoubtedly a veela and a powerful one at that.” </p>
<p>"You are dismissed.”</p>
<p>Arthur bowed before leaving the king to his thoughts.</p>
<p> As soon as he left the king let himself fall to his knees, shoulders shaking as he wept.</p>
<p>“Oh stars...why have the fates forsaken me so?” </p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the kingdom of Godric's Hollow a little boy was left on the steps of a humble cottage by the woods. Vivid green eyes blinked up to his saviour as tiny hands grasped at the person's thumb.</p>
<p>Their face scrunched up in disdain as they pried their finger free from the infant's clutches.</p>
<p>Cautiously, they peered around before knocking on the wooden door. There was a stirring behind the cobblestone walls and a faint murmur of voices, candles signalling the approach of the house’s occupants.</p>
<p>And so the figure stole away into the night, sparing one last glance at the child with a mixture of pity and regret.</p>
<p>It was the only way.</p>
