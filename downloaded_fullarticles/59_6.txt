    <p>"RON! RONALD!" Hermione watched him leave and caught the locket when he threw it. She needed to stay strong but there was one less person to fight Voldemort. "I'll get firewood." Hermione walked towards the trees to find kindling and let the tears streak her face silently. The air seemed to shift slightly when she got nearer to the trees and she dug her wand out out of habit or instinct, she didn't know or care which by this point in the war. She walked closer while scanning around for kindling. Hermione softened only slightly but kept her guard up when she heard it. Loud shuddering breaths which changed to hoarse sobs in between quick inhales and slow exhales trying to stop the tears. Hermione stopped when she saw the full view. A raven haired girl was kneeling before a destroyed grave and shrine and there were two bodies flung to an impossible distance in grotesque twisted poses which made them twitch in their death. The witch was crying her eyes out and chanting something over and over. Hermione got closer to hear her and she turned around to watch the lake before her lip trembled and she cried again. She inhaled sharply when Hermione touched her shoulder with one hand.</p><p>"Why are you trying to comfort me?" The witch had baby blue eyes and numerous braids holding her hair back on one side. She was beautiful in an ethereal and tragic sense since she looked like a mythical creature Hermione had seen in one of her books. It had been mourning and its skin was like moonlight. She hadn't been able to translate the creature's name but it stood over numerous bodies with tears in its eyes. Hermione answered the question and looked at the shrine rubble</p><p>"This is horrible no matter who it's done to! Can I ask your name?" She watched her nod slowly</p><p>"Merlynne" Merlynne looked even more miserable when saying it and Hermione thought it was vain and borderline cruel to name a child after a god. She brought out her wand and held it to Merlynne's throat </p><p>"I'm sorry about this" Hermione screamed when she was flung backwards. Merlynne wasn't holding a wand or horcrux and towered over her with... amber... eyes.</p><p>"If he who should not have been born sent you, tell him I have no problem with killing a teen. I failed to before and I suffered for it. An entire kingdom suffered for it!" Merlynne fell to her knees and cried while punching the ground. Hermione aimed her wand and whispered at the sorceress' back</p><p>"Veritaseris" She crawled forward cautiously and asked her potential ally the aggravatingly important question "Which side are you on?"</p><p>"Arthur's. I always have and always will serve him. I was born to" Merlynne's eyes stayed fixed on the lake. "He has to rise" Her words made Hermione frown </p><p>"Are you on Voldemort's?" She kept her wand aimed and waited.</p><p>"No. I killed two of his followers, why would I be?" Merlynne gazed at the lake again "Arthur please... come on you prat" She was still looking at the water when Hermione helped her up. </p><p>"Harry!" She helped Merlynne back to their camp. "This is - this is..." She sighed out of pity and said it "This is Merlynne. She's powerful and she's on our side. She's a sorceress" Hermione watched his reaction and drew him aside "Does she seem familiar?" She waited for Harry's answer</p><p>"Yes and no." He looked at Merlynne again and tried to decipher it "I know what you mean"</p>
