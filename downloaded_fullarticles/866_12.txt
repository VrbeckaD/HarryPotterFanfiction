  <em> 1st of December </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Dear bloody Merlin, Gryffindors are a menace. I am currently sitting in the Eighth Year’s Common Room, trying to busy myself with ordering Christmas presents for my friends and family. It has proven quite difficult to do though, as all around me, my Gryffindor year-mates are jumping around, celebrating something – what, I don’t really know. After all, I <em> was </em> minding my <em> own </em> business before they barged in, shouting loudly and happily.</p><p> </p><p>As yet another pillow hits me in the head, I decide to give up and wait until tomorrow to finish up my gift shopping. I set down my catalogues, half-filled parchment and quill and carefully put some protection charms over them. I wouldn’t really want anything to be destroyed by the ongoing chaos. Looking up, I see that Draco has already done the same and he is currently calmly just watching the ruckus. More often than not, I notice his eyes flicker to – and occasionally linger on – one Gryffindor in particular. I smile. </p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you go talk to him?” I ask, and laugh when Draco splutters in response. </p><p>“I– what– no, I can’t. I don’t want to. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Of course you don’t, that would take <em> way </em> too much brain power for you to understand. Well, if you don’t go talk to him, then I shall do it instead.” I smirk. “And, perhaps I’ll even get to offer him some of my… services? Sweet Salazar, he might even say yes? With him coming out the other month, and I <em> know </em> that I am <em> very </em> good looking.”</p><p>As I had predicted, Draco’s jealousy instantly kicks in. “You will do no such thing, <em> mister Zabini </em>.” It causes my smirk to grow even wider. Draco only calls me that when I’m really getting on his nerves. “I will go. Soon. When things have settled down a bit.”</p><p>“You mean that you just want to keep staring at him. Then what?”</p><p>“Yes, Blaise, I do like to look at him. Good eye candy, that one.” Draco’s previous icy appearance is gone again and we are back to our usual easy banter. He really has changed with time. When he was younger such a provoking incident would have left him with a grudge that he would hold for <em> at least </em> a week and a half.</p><p>“True. However, if by the next hour you haven’t talked to him, I <em> swear </em> that I will.”</p><p>“Sure. Now shut up and let me stare.”</p><p>I laugh and Draco lets out a soft chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>His laughter dies in his throat as his eyes meet another’s gaze. It’s strange, but even for me time seems to slow down and in the frozen moment it’s just me watching the two boys locking each other in place with their eyes. Then it’s over. Potter looks away first, and I hear Draco take a deep breath.</p><p>“Never mind,” he whispers. “You go ahead and talk to him. I’m going to the library.”</p><p>I know very well that Draco is <em> not </em> going to the library because we both finished our homework before starting on our Christmas ordering, so he doesn’t have a reason to go to the library this late in the afternoon. I also know that Draco has several small places in the castle where he hides whenever he wants to be alone. Though, I have never found any of those places and I know that if he leaves, I won’t be able to find out what’s wrong. Every time he returns from his ‘moments’, he likes to pretend nothing happened. </p><p>“Draco, wait–” I start, but my friend is already at the door across the room and he leaves without looking back once. </p><p> </p><p>I cast an eye over the crowd still in the room. They are all still laughing and playing around as if nothing has happened. Except for Potter. Potter is standing still, as if struck by lightning, exactly in the same spot he was before. He hasn’t moved at all and he is visibly very confused by what just happened. I sigh and rise from the chair. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” I say as I approach Potter. “Let’s talk.”</p><p> </p><p>I drag Potter out of the Common Room and lead him into an empty classroom nearby. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?!” he half shouts as soon as the door is locked behind us and I have put up a silencing charm. “Why’d you bring me here?!”</p><p>“I told you,” I answer easily. “To talk.”</p><p>“Why? And about what?”</p><p>“Because we need to. About Draco.” I make sure that my tone is matter-of-factly, leaving no room for discussion.</p><p>“Dra– Malfoy? Why do we need to talk about Malfoy?”</p><p>"Don’t play dumb, Potter, I get enough of that from Draco already.”</p><p>“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Potter mutters.</p><p>“That’s what he says as well. But I’m not gonna fight you about it. I said we should talk, so Imma talk. And you should at least wait and listen to me, even if you don’t want to talk to me.”</p><p>Potter regards me with a piercing stare that makes my skin prickle, but I don’t break our eye contact. Then he nods and grunts. “Fine. Talk.” </p><p>I take a breath and look down on the floor before starting. “You might or might not have noticed that Draco has some provoking characteristics, but I’m certain that you can understand that there are also other, <em> much </em> less provocative sides to him. He’s actually a really good person. Even before… everything… he started to change. He wanted to change. He had already changed, but it wasn’t enough. And it was too late. Mayhap, you think that he’s just a coward and a jerk, and yes, sometimes he is a bit over the top, that’s just how dramatic he is, but let me tell you. He is <em> not </em> a coward. He is one of the bravest people I know. And I know you, so that’s saying something. He is also very strong. I mean, he braved literal hell, and still kept his kind soul. Yes, it’s tainted from that <em> horrible </em> experience, and there are times that it hurts too much for him, but at least he is not broken. And he is as whole as anyone could be after going through that. And I think that you should acknowledge that. You should go talk to him. Get to know him. Leave all of that stupid rivalry behind you and maybe try to become his friend. He might not say it, but I know that he wants it, he wants to be with you. And Salazar knows he deserves that. And–”</p><p>“I know,” Potter interrupts. When I look at him, he's wearing an almost wicked smirk. </p><p>“What?” I ask bluntly.</p><p>“I know that he’s a great guy. We talk you know. And… I’ve <em> been with </em> him for quite a while… you know.”</p><p>“Yeah, but I thought– wait, what do you mean ‘been with him’? I thought you two only met when you study for group assignments and such. You mean you’ve seen him more than that?”</p><p>Potter’s grin widens and his eyes darken with devilish determination. It’s not hard to see why he’s the one that vanquished the Dark Lord when he looks like that. I feel a shiver run down my spine and pray to my ancestors that Potter won’t notice it. </p><p>“Hah, yeah,” he laughs, “I mean… we’re together. <em> Together </em> together.”</p><p>“WHAT?!” I shout out in disbelief. Here I was, talking about them just getting to know each other, and… apparently, I’m the one that needs to get to know <em> them</em>. Even my best friend… </p><p>“But, we’ve kinda… kept quiet about it. Don’t want it to be a big deal. Not even Ron knows. Oh, Merlin, Dray is gonna kill me when he realises I’ve told you.”</p><p>“You’re– but…” I try to make sense of everything. “Then why were you so confused he left earlier?”</p><p>Potter blushes. He’s quite cute when he does that. Takes away the killed-an-Evil-Dark-Lord-vibe a bit.</p><p>“Because, usually, when he does that, he’ll slip me a note or something to let me know where I can meet him so we can be alone and… talk… and sometimes, you know… fuck… but often we just talk. But he didn’t give me anything this time.”</p><p>Understanding slowly dawns upon me.</p><p>“Oh, bloody hell,” I breathe. And then I realise something else. “Oh, <em> bloody hell</em>, he’s having a moment!” I shout and rush out of the room. Obviously, Potter apprehends exactly what I mean as he’s quickly following me. Frantically we run through the castle. We look through every room and alcove, desperately trying to find our friend. We have made our way through half the school when I hear Potter shout ‘I know’ behind me before he turns and sprints the other way. Without skipping a beat, I do the same and dash after Potter.</p><p> </p><p>The Astronomy Tower. It’s bad then. Draco has never told me what happened <em> that </em> night, but I know it’s bad, and he only goes here when he's living through his worst memories or doubting himself more than usual.</p><p> </p><p>When I finally make it to the top of the stairs, I find Potter crouched in front of a very rigid Draco. A gentle hand is tracing through white blond hair, green eyes are intently searching frightened silver, another hand cups a pale face. And then soft lips press against Draco’s left cheek. Right on the place I know there is a dimple every time Draco smiles. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Potter mutters. “I’m here, I found you. We’re okay.” Another light kiss on Draco’s cheek. It’s extremely intimate, but I can’t find it in myself to look away. “Look, Draco, I found a freckle,” Harry whispers and places a kiss higher on Draco’s face. “It’s very small. Almost invisible. But beautiful. And I found it.” Kiss. “Another here. I can count them. Hmmm… seven on this side.” Now, Potter just lets his thumb run across Draco’s skin, ever so gently. “And let’s see… eight on this side. They’re so beautiful. I found them. I found them and I found you. It’s okay. You’re okay. I love you.”</p><p>Finally, Draco relaxes. He leans into Potter’s touch and I let out the breath I must’ve been holding for a moment. I’m feeling lightheaded and I <em> know </em> I shouldn’t be here. This is their moment, and now I know my best friend is fine. I turn to leave, but–</p><p>“What are <em> you </em> doing here?!” Draco shouts as loudly as he can, though his voice breaks a bit. I turn back again.</p><p>“Checking on you, of course. And apparently, I’m following your <em> boyfriend </em> too… thanks for helping me find him, Potter.”</p><p>“I… it’s not–”</p><p>“It’s fine, Draco. Potter already told me.”</p><p>“He… he what?!”</p><p>“He told me <em> everything</em>. How you’re studying and talking and… <em> fu– </em> ” I don’t finish the sentence, but instead just fire away a mischievous grin at them. Then I wink and quickly run down the stairs. Laughing a bit to myself, I hear how Potter’s trying to explain what had happened to a furious Draco. Okay, perhaps not <em> all </em> Gryffindors are a menace.</p>
