</p><p> </p><p>Harry was forced to take the stairs to his apartment as the elevator was out of service, for the second time this week. Harry could always apparate in the living room, however, he usually enjoys doing this in the Muggle way, or as they call it in the United States: No-Maj. </p><p> </p><p>After the war and during his 8th year Harry was harassed by the press, especially Rita Skeeter. Harry retreated himself at Grimmauld Place to avoid them but was also getting depressed and extremely anxious when going out wasn't an option but a necessity. Draco, his boyfriend since 6th year, tried everything he could to help Harry but he was also being harassed by the press, often titles on The Daily Prophet read about his past and his relationship with Harry, The Chosen One. Then after a year of this situation, Harry and Draco were offered a job at the American Ministry of Magic as Strategy Consultor and Dark potions investigator, respectively; they accepted immediately with the condition that they would live in a muggle town and that the press will not know about them moving to the country. </p><p> </p><p>They left shortly after, weirdly and disappointingly nobody went with them to say goodbye, Draco has no one left but her boyfriend and Pansy who was on the US ready to receive them in her home until they got their place and Harry's family, the Weasleys were not supporting his decisions nor his relationship with Draco, Harry didn't tell anyone but the Weasleys and Hermione in risks of a leak to the press. </p><p> </p><p>They have been living in New York for over a year now, and after a few months after their arrival, they got their apartment in a very nice and quiet muggle city. The building has a very urban look but it was very modern and fancy in the inside, Harry and Draco loved it since the very beginning, despite the constants fix the elevator needs. </p><p> </p><p>"Love, I'm home," Harry called out as he left his keys on the table near the entrance and his coat on the rack next to it. "Draco?" Harry advanced inside the apartment as he took off his tie. </p><p> </p><p>"In the kitchen," Draco said from that room and Harry stepped in to find his boyfriend cooking dinner. "Hey" He greeted Harry with a bright smile, he was gorgeous, he was wearing only a pair of tight boxers with smiley faces on it and a light shirt as he had learned that cooking shirtless is not a good idea. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," Harry said breathlessly as he leaned in to kiss his cherry lips. "You look amazing" He commented putting a strand of silver hair behind his ear and Draco blushed. </p><p> </p><p>"Flattering, aren't we, Potter?" He looked away trying to hide his blushing cheeks but this only prompted Harry to hug him from behind, nuzzling his nose in the crook of Draco's neck. </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, I would say," He said leaving a kiss behind his ear to then pull away and go to the fridge to get a cold beer and then to the storage to get a glass of wine for Draco. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Draco said sipping from the glass and leaving it on the counter next to him. "How was work today?" Draco asked as he removed the food from the stove before turning it off. </p><p> </p><p>He sighed as he finished his beer in one gulp and took out another one. </p><p> </p><p>"That bad?" Draco asked as he started serving the food in two plates. </p><p> </p><p>"Ron owled me today" Harry commented as he helped Draco taking the dishes to the table.</p><p> </p><p>Draco stopped dead in his tracks. "What? What did he say?" </p><p> </p><p>"Is it okay if we talk about it another time? I don't want to think about it, let alone talk about it" Harry sighed taking off his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose to keep at bay the upcoming headache. The mere memory of his former best friend, a brother from another mother, caused him immense pain. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey," Draco said getting closer to him and putting a hand on his boyfriend's shoulder. "It's okay, we don't have to talk about it right now, do you need to have a seat? Maybe water?" Draco asked worriedly.</p><p> </p><p>"No, it's okay, thanks" Harry sighed and put on his glasses again to focus his sight on the worried expression Draco was giving him. "It's okay, I'm okay" Harry smiled reassuringly but Draco didn't seem convinced. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," He said after a moment, letting it go. "Let's eat in the living room, I want to watch a movie." He said as he started walking with Harry following him closely.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Draco ate their dinner in silence only interrupted by an occasional laugh or comment about the comedy movie they chose. </p><p> </p><p>"Which one are we watching?" Harry asked as he returned from the kitchen where he was doing the dishes. </p><p> </p><p>"It's called 'It', let me tell you that muggles are not that creative at naming films" He commented as Harry sat down next to him, putting his arm around him from the back of the couch. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmm, well, maybe after the movie you will understand the name" Harry offered, watching him over the frame of his glasses before readjusting them on his face. </p><p> </p><p>"Have you seen it?" Draco asked with curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>"I have, it's good, although I reckon the one from the '90s was better" Harry voiced as Draco played the movie. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, let's see if I like it" Draco shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>The first minutes of the movie were a shock for Draco as he has never seen the movie and never knew what a clown was. He closed his eyes for a second but continue watching more. Harry, on the other hand, was dozing off next to Draco, the fullness in his stomach and the day he had, had him tired. Draco turned to see him, minutes after noticing that he was asleep already, so he accommodated his head in a better position and removed his glasses putting them on the table next to them. Draco leaned in his boyfriend's embrace and put his head on his shoulder to continue watching the movie. </p><p> </p><p>Draco was horrified by the end of the movie. He tried to follow his boyfriend's in his sleep, as he always does when they watch movies and Harry is the first one to fall asleep, but tonight his thoughts were keeping him away. The way Pennywise was presented as a creature that transforms into your greatest fear made him compare it to boggarts and his memory went back to the third year at Hogwarts when Professor Lupin brought one to the class; Draco didn't get to see his boggart as he made an excuse to go out of the class, he knew what his boggart would have been: Lord Voldemort. However, Draco wondered what would have been his boggart after the defeat of the Dark Lord a few years ago by his boyfriend, with this thought in mind, Draco fell asleep. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Draco, you should have known better, this wasn't forever" He heard Harry's voice very low. "This is over" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Harry, please" He begged with a cracking voice. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "No, Draco, did you really thought I was going to choose you over my family? My reputation?" Harry laughed mockingly. "Choose you? A death eater?" Harry continued to laugh as Draco's eyes filled with painful hot tears. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Harry, you promised...You said you loved me" Draco cried as he continued to beg his boyfriend (soon to be ex-boyfriend) to stay.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Good-bye, Malfoy," He said with a cold tone of voice, and Draco's chest, heart ached for Harry. A scream of pure pain left his throat. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"<strong> Riddikulus </strong>" Harry yelled the spell at the cold version of himself that was in the corner of the living room and he saw himself dancing a muggle ridiculous dance before compelling the boggart into the case he brought home earlier that night. "Draco?" Harry walked up in the darkness to find his boyfriend leaning against the wall in front of where the boggart was standing just a moment ago. "Baby?" Harry approached him cautiously. " Are you okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"P-please, do-don't -le-leave me" Draco cried and Harry's hand found their way around Draco's back as he pulled him into a bone-crushing hug.</p><p> </p><p>"Baby, I'm not leaving you, I love you" Harry mumbled with his lips against Draco's hair. " I will never leave you" He continued muttering comforting words followed by soft and teary kisses until Draco calmed down. </p><p> </p><p>"Potter, what in Salazar's name are you crying about?" Draco muttered playfully trying to lighten the mood a bit. Harry looked surprised at this boyfriend's words and cleaned the tears staining his cheeks unaware when he started crying. </p><p> </p><p>"It's just... it was shocking that I'm your boggart" Harry mumbled suddenly finding the needlework of the carpet the most interesting thing in the world. </p><p> </p><p>"You're not my boggart, the possibility of you leaving me is my greatest fear." Draco clarified finding his way back into Harry's embrace. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm a man of word, Draco and you know it..." Harry sounded hurt for the fear of his boyfriend. " I will never leave you, I will be by your side even if you don't want me to be, like in the mornings when all you want to do is kick me out of bed to sleep five minutes more... even there, I will be with you" Harry added and Draco let out a wet laugh against Harry's throat and Harry laughed against his cheek. "I love you, and I want you to go with me back to London, only if you want" Harry sighed when Draco pulled back to look at him in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>"What? Are we moving back to London?" Draco asked with a frown in his eyebrows and lips.</p><p> </p><p>"No! Merlin, no... Ron invited me to his and Hermione baby shower" Harry swallowed thickly before continuing. "He owled me the invite today and well, Molly hasn't been well lately and..." Harry fidgeted with his glasses with nervousness and Draco leaned in to kiss his lips in a quick peck. </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, I will go wherever you want, wherever you go, I'm also a man of word, Potter, and I promised that I will follow you to the end of the world." Harry beamed brightly and Draco mirrored his smile. </p><p> </p><p>"That was so gay, Malfoy" Harry scrunched his nose playfully and Draco huffed as he stood up and help Harry do the same. </p><p> </p><p>"If you haven't noticed, <em> Potter </em> , " Draco said feigning arrogance. "We  <em> are  </em>gay," He said as they made their way to their bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, you're gayer" Harry laughed and Draco smacked his arm a little bit too hard. "Ouch," He rubbed his arm dramatically. "Wait," He stopped Draco from getting in the bed. " I need to take the boggart to the Ministry, will you with me?" Harry pout and Draco couldn't say no.</p><p> </p><p>After Draco put on a pair of sweatpants, they both floo'ed into Harry's office at the Ministry. Harry left for the Magical Creatures Department and Draco stayed at his office, waiting for him. He was about to fall asleep when a piece of parchment caught his attention, feeling bad for violating Harry's privacy he left the invite on the desk and waited for Harry to arrive. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, sleepyhead... ready to go? " Harry shook Draco to wake him up. </p><p> </p><p>"Everything is taken care of?" Draco yawned standing up and stretching his muscles. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, well, not everything... I have to confirm my assistance to this" Harry said holding the invite Draco preferred not to read. "Did you read it?" He asked curiously.</p><p> </p><p>"No, I could be penalized for violating your privacy," He said horrified and Harry laughed leaving the invite again on the desk. </p><p> </p><p>"See this?" Harry pointed at Draco's left ring finger wearing a beautiful gold band with small green jade stones carved in it. "This means, you've accepted to marry me... so you will be my husband, therefore, what's mine it's yours and I have nothing to hide from you... so" Harry grabbed the invite again and handed it to Draco. "You can read it" Draco took the invite and read what was written in it. </p><p> </p><p><em> Ronald and Hermione Weasley kindly invite you  </em> <strong> <em> Harry Potter </em> </strong> <em>  to their baby shower for baby Weasley on the 20th of this month to be celebrated at the Burrow at 4 pm.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Please confirm your assistance by owling back this invite sealed with your family emblem. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Regards,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"But, Harry, this is a single invite, no plus one" Draco frowned his eyebrows at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"I know, I don't care... you're my plus one, always" Harry smiled sheepishly and Draco couldn't help but leaned in and kiss his fiancé on the lips. "I want to show you something," Harry said and from the pocket of his cloak, he pulled out a green velvet box and handed it to Draco. </p><p> </p><p>Draco opened it and found laying inside a golden seal, he carefully took it our and observed the emblem. Draco gasped at the image, it was the Malfoy emblem, but at the same time it wasn't, the shield was there, the dragons were there, the 'M' of Malfoy was there too, but the snakes were replaced by two lions and the 'M' was sharing his space with a 'P' of...Potter.</p><p> </p><p>"It's... is it our emblem?" Draco sounded like he was about to cry for the second time of the night. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, it's not registered yet but we can use it to confirm our assistance to the Weasley's baby shower" Harry grinned.</p><p> </p><p>"Ronald's going to be mad" Draco commented. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm hoping he is" Harry tried to chucked but the sound was drowned in his lips meeting Draco's.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you, Potter" </p><p> </p><p>"I love you too, soon to be Malfoy-Potter," Harry said against his lips making Draco pulled away to throwback is head in laughter. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
