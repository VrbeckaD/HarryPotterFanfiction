  <b>Chapter 1. Perfectly Normal</b>
</h1><hr/><p>
  <span>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley is proud to say that they are perfectly happy and normal people with perfectly ordinary lives. They live in a perfectly ordinary brick house in a perfectly normal suburban neighborhood. Mr. Dursley is perfectly happy with his job as a perfectly normal salesman working for a perfectly normal drill factory. Mrs. Dursley is perfectly happy and perfectly content with her life as a perfectly normal housewife. The couple has a perfectly normal son who is the light of their perfectly normal lives. Yes, the Dursley live perfectly normal and perfectly happy lives. Therefore it is perfectly understandable that when Mrs. Petunia Dursley nee Evans opens her front door to find a baby, of all things, on her front stoop she is not only flabbergasted but outraged as well. Why should such a freakish thing happen to someone so perfectly normal as she and her husband strive to be?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How dare some freakish family abandon their equally freakish child with Mrs. Petunia Dursley’s perfectly normal family? Petunia shutters just thinking about the type of Freaks who would leave a baby on a doorstep rather than choosing to keep their child. Obviously they aren't anyone of good standing or someone one wants to be associated with. Then there's the chance that the abandoned child has managed to catch something between being abandoned and her finding it. Petunia narrows her eyes at the thought of a Freak’s child influencing and corrupting her darling son. Without her permission, her thoughts drift to imagining all the horrible scenarios. A sneer pulls on her features at the thought that the Freak child might be one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They've only had a few run-ins with those occult freaks but this may be one of those occult freaks offspring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Petunia Dursley glares balefully at the sleeping Freak while she decides on what to do about the unnatural and therefore unwelcome situation. Naturally, within moments, she has chosen to refuse to bring the abnormality within her perfectly </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span> home. This Freak has disrupted enough normality as it is. Instead, Mrs. Petunia Dursley picks up the morning post and promptly shuts the door with a soft *clICK*. While she sets about preparing breakfast Mrs. Petunia Dursley hopes beyond all reasonable hope that the deviation from routine will be gone when her husband, Mr. Vernon Dursley leaves for work. Still, Petunia makes sure to mention the oddity to her husband as she bottle feeds their darling little Duddlykins and Vernon eats his breakfast. Her husband's only response is to raise an eyebrow and grunt just as displeased at the odd situation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don't worry, pet,” Vernon soothes before gulping down his third tall glass of orange juice before moving onto his coffee. “It's unlikely whoever left the Freak here cares what happens to it.” Vernon states before wolfing down three more sausages. “Tot’s parents were likely worthless layabouts with no idea what to do with a child and thought to leave it with good upstanding people.” At that last bit Vernon puffs out a bit in pride before frowning as a thought hits him. “The Freaks should have known better than to bother good upstanding citizens, like us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what do we </span>
  <em>
    <span>do </span>
  </em>
  <span>with it, Vernon?” Petunia emplores. She's so stressed by the oddness of the situation that she can't make out any way to relieve her family of the abnormality. “It’s a child, Vernon. Something needs to be done before this completely ruins our lives.” With the harsh reminder Vernon pauses in thought for a good few minutes. Petunia taking notice of the deep creases on her husband’s rounded face tries brainstorming a way for them to get rid of the oddity. “We’ll just dump it at an orphanage,” Vernon says with a decisive nod of his head interrupting her similar thought process. “We can't just go about keeping stray babies like that useless woman down the road collects cats,” Vernon says with a huff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia wrinkled her nose at the thought of Mrs. Figg of number seven. “Worthless Freak that woman.” Petunia absentmindedly comments as she begins to spread strawberry jam over her toast. “She's ruining the names of good upstanding citizens with that unhealthy and freakish cat obsession of hers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That freak is ruining the neighbourhood’s property value and setting a bad example for all the children too.” Vernon agrees while he chews two more eggs over easy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We really should do something about her,” Petunia says before taking a nibble of her toast and swallowing. “I don't want our darling son growing up around the wrong sort after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You're quite right!” Vernon quickly agrees now seeing the appeal. “I won't have my boy being influenced by any rotten, good for nothing layabouts!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you won’t,” Petunia says with a gentle smile. The two then continue to eat their breakfast in amiable silence while just outside their front door a baby sleeps away still under the effects of a bewitched sleeping spell.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Mrs. Petunia Dursley and Mr. Vernon Dursley decided to do their best to salvage the day and continue with their planned weekend trip to visit Vernon’s sister Marge. Ms. Marge Dursley lives on a nice farm just outside of Wales where she raises sheep and cattle and trains dogs. After breakfast Petunia washes the dishes Meanwhile, Vernon sips his coffee and reads the morning paper. Their one-year-old son Dudely plays with his toys and laughs in his playpen. Petunia stops every once in a while to check on her son, Dudley, and her husband, Vernon will make the odd comment about any abnormalities in the news. Neither Dursley makes any comment or mention of the child outside. Both Durselys are politely pretending that oddity doesn't exist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When it's finally time for the young family to leave, Petunia pulls on her favourite overcoat, then picks up their son’s pastel blue diaper bag and her purse. Meanwhile, Vernon holds his smiling giggling son earning a gentle kiss from his wife for his efforts. When they open their door they are surprised to find the baby still there and seemingly </span>
  <em>
    <span>still sleeping</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Now warry and suspicious Petunia narrows her eyes and Vernon kicks the child wondering if the thing died between being abandoned and now. Instantly the child is wide awake. Petunia pales before her face turns red in anger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Vernon,” she hisses in a terrified panic, “it’s one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>. One of those occult Freaks from that Freakish occult world has just left their freakish occult offspring on our front stoop!” Petunia hisses out in an enraged whisper. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vernon turns pink, then maroon and finally white with indignation. “Wait here.” he gruffly orders before quickly turning around and heading back inside leaving Petunia standing in the open doorway with their son and one of those Freak’s unwanted offspring. Petunia takes a step back from the thing. She's wary of touching it. The freak peers up at her with abnormal neon green eyes. When Vernon comes back, his hands are covered in her kitchen gloves and he’s holding a towel and a basket. They'll need to just burn whatever touches the freak. Maybe even hire someone to build them a new porch </span>
  <em>
    <span>just </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carefully and shakily Vernon picks the Freak up before dropping it and their former towel in the basket with due haste. “Alright,” Vernon says with a nod and a firm grip on the basket “alright," he repeats clearly shaken. "change of plans. We can't in good mind leave this thing with any nice normal people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.” Petunia aggres glaring hatefully at the Freak who just looks back at her seemingly confused. “What do we do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll just have to find someplace to leave it. Somewhere where the other occult Freaks can find it.” Vernon says before leading the way to the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do we do that?” Petunia asks, she's confused but obediently follows behind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There's plenty of alleyways from here to London,” Vernon assures her tossing the basket in the back and bucking in. “Hold Dudley in your lap.” Vernon orders as she moves to put him in his car seat. “I don't want him near that Freak.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia nods her head in assent to the decision before bucking in herself and securing her hold on Dudley.</span>
