    <p>The wizarding war was finally over.</p><p>Voldemort was dead, and never to be heard from again.</p><p>Happiness and freedom together now flooded through the towns and cities as celebration after celebration took place. Laughter, joy and chatter spread over the people like a warm blanket of realisation that everything was over. No more fighting. No more hiding away in fear. And yet in all the joy that had been spread over towns, there was double the amount of mourning and sadness. People had lost so many loved ones, that they could never get a chance to see again, due to that war.</p><p>Death Eaters, who were still arrogant enough to stay loyal and tried to carry on with the work that their leader had failed to complete, were chucked in Azkaban, and those who promised to change for good were given second chances. Not many people agreed with let ex-Death Eaters stroll around freely but they had little choice in the matter</p><p>Wizards and witches alike strolled through Hogsmeade chatting ravishingly to their friends; they seemed to be talking about things as big as future plans that could now proceed or even just what they had had for lunch that day.</p><p>It seemed that the warmth that filled the air was contagious, and every man or women that stepped foot in it would suddenly be cheerful too. Even the sun gleamed down on the world, as if it too, were filled with never ending joy.</p><p>The Golden Trio sat around their usual small table in the corner of their favourite pub, chatting joyfully while gulping down some of the most famous butter beer in town. Noise filled every inch of the snug pub as people shouted and conversed with glee. Madam Rosmerter was busy bustling around getting drinks and fussing over some ministry members as usual.<br/>
Before he spoke to the other two, Harry glanced around the crowed pub to make sure no one was listening in to their conversation; even though the war was over people still tried not to think about it or Voldemort at all, they all seemed to shudder with the fear that the news of someone breaking out of Azkaban might suddenly appear in the Daily Prophet, or that Voldemort had never actually been killed and he was just biding his time, getting ready to strike again.</p><p>"So we did it? We really defeated him even after everything that had happened to us?" At Harry's words Hermione smiled, the thought and realisation of world peace had just crossed her mind. Could it be that they, three insignificant 17 year olds, who didn't know what they were doing half the time, had vanquished the most feared wizard of all time?</p><p>"Yeah mate! We did it together" Ron chuckled as he spoke and pecked Hermione on the cheek; they had been official ever since the kiss they had shared in the chamber of secrets, during the battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>The three continued to chat and make jokes. Every so often people came up to their table to congratulate them on their success of winning the final battle and defeating Voldemort. But suddenly, as if a switch had been flicked, silence as thick as ice filled the once joyous room. Mutters here and there were to be heard as two people nervously walked over to the bar.</p><p>Harry scowled as his archenemy walked past him, but he was able to calm himself slightly and control his anger far better than Ron...</p><p>_</p><p>
  <b>Draco's POV </b>
</p><p>I had tried to convince mother that going out in town wasn't a good idea. People hate us. They wanted us to be thrown in Azkaban with the rest of the scummy lot. I mean, except for the Lestrages, we were known as one of the most loyal families to ever pledge are allegiances with the dark side. People even knew that we had given up our own fortress to Voldemort, and that I, only about two years ago had been given the task to kill one of the most idolised wizards of all time, Albus Dumbledore. But, what people didn't know, and would most likely not believe if even they did know, was what happened on the last day of the battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>As we opened the door to the Three Broomsticks opened and stepped inside a heavy silence swam over the room. I could see the hatred in everyone's eyes. I could hear the muttering of anger and astonishment. I could feel the pure loathing burn into me. I slowly made my way up to the bar where Madam Rosmerter was cowing backwards, trying as she might to keep a smile on her face. Suddenly my mother gripped onto my arms for protection, a younger bloke, just older than me, had tried to lunge for her. I wouldn't let anyone hurt her, she was already weak from the torments she got about her husband, and she didn't need any more jeers thrown her way.</p><p>As we walked my eyes flickered over all the tables and I noticed that, sat around one of the smaller ones, in a corner by the window, were the three heroes of the war; the ones that had vanquished Voldemort for good and had put a stop to the constant fighting. I could clearly see the scowl that was forming on Potter's face. What scares me even more was that Weasley had almost hurled himself at me in rage and I would probably be in need of treatment at St Mungo's hospital if it hadn't been for the mudb... but I couldn't bear to call her that, not after everything that she had been through.</p><p>She was no longer the nerdy girl with uncontrollable bushy hair or long rabbit-like front teeth, but an elegant young lady who looked actually quite beautiful. Her golden, brown locks fell around her shoulders in cute curls; her stunning brown eyes shone like the stars and seemed to dazzle anyone that looked at her. She was the most breath-taking girl I had seen and yet I still, after all these years didn't understand the effect she had on me.</p><p>What did I feel? Was it love or just lust? Who am I kidding, I've liked her ever since 1st year.</p><p>It was an act, all of it, the tormenting, bullying and arrogance, a way to pretend, pretend I did not, I do not-<br/>
My thoughts were shattered as my mum coughed loudly at me and I realised I was meant to be ordering drinks, not drifting off to dwell on Hermione of all people.</p><p>We ordered one butter beer and one fire whisky and moved slowly over to the only lonely table there, which unfortunately happened to be right next to <em>there's</em>.</p><p>Weasley smashed his hand down on the table and hissed something at me, which was hardly distinguishable, but I chose to ignore it.</p><p>I had changed and I wanted the world to know I had.</p><p>My eyes shifted over to Hermione and are gazes met for a brief second, but instead of the cheerful brown eyes she usually had, they were coated in a mixture of anger, hatred and yet I also good sense sympathy. I looked away unease filling my stomach.</p><p>She hated me.</p><p>And yet I loved her.</p><p>They walked out after another five minutes and I could have sworn Hermione's eyes and mine met once again. However this time there was no longer hate in her eyes. I was conflicted between thinking it was sorrow or forgiveness. My heart jolted as she slowly smiled a sad smile at me. I smiled back and to my surprise she blushed. She then turned and left the pub with the other two boys.</p><p>Maybe there was a small chance she will forgive me after all. I smiled to myself as I was pulled into a whirlwind of thoughts that were swimming through my head.</p><p>"So that's the girl that you talk about almost every day." I was jolted from my thoughts, yet again, as my mum spoke.<br/>
I was surprised when a small smile grew on her face. I nodded slowly and her smile grew to twice its normally size.</p><p>"Y-you don't care that I've fallen in love with a muggle-born?" I was so amazed when she shook her head. "I am happy that my son has found someone to love. Just please convince her that you, we, have changed." She looked worried all of a sudden. "I will don't worry." I smiled at her and took a sip of my fire whiskey.</p><p>I love her too much for me not to try and convince her.</p><p>Â </p>
