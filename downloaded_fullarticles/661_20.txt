    <p>Hermione was beginning to have doubts about this. She had done her research. Muggle speed dating was very popular in London, all statistics pointed to 67% more success rate that any dating website, classified ads, or app. The safest community dubbed for such successful speed dating was the LGBT community. So here she sat in the latest batch of young people like herself looking for love.</p>
<p>At least that’s what the advertisement said after signing up. The layout was small office-like booths for each table. Not revealing the next person until you moved after the bell rang indication time was up. It felt like a muggle TV dating game show </p>
<p>The first Male had not even bothered giving her eye contact let alone try to speak to her, preferring to spend 3 minutes not to subtly looking down her cleavage. </p>
<p>She almost felt hopeful with batchelor number 4 as the small talk seemed promising, even a joke or two was split between them giving to comfortable laughter. Hermione was quite taken until the bell rang and the young man bent forward with a piece of paper and his number with a wink and statement of “Gimme a text if you fancy some, your place or mine I don’t mind!”<br/>
She crumpled up the note throwing it back at him calling him a Pig as she moved to the next booth.</p>
<p>She growled in frustration, collapsing down into the chair scraping it against the worn floorboards not even yet bothering to look up at her next challenger.</p>
<p>“Hello Pet”</p>
<p>That made her look up. </p>
<p>Eyes widening as looking in disbelief in front of her. </p>
<p>“I know I’m breathtaking muddy but you really need to stop catching flies” The seductive voice whispered as a harsh long fingernail reached up to the tip of her jaw pressuring it up to close.</p>
<p>Hermione shuddered shaking her face to be rid of the offending touch.</p>
<p>“You! . . . Wha . HOW!” She spluttered in disbelief. All the while blood red lips smirked at her flustered state. </p>
<p>“Call it fate or whatever you like Pet. I have to say you’re still as delicious as you looked on my sister’s Manor floor” </p>
<p>“No, just no! I am not doing this shit now!” She cried standing up so abruptly as the chair scraped out whizzing backwards behind her. </p>
<p>She stomped out pushing past the people at the doorway. Rushing out in the drizzling rain focusing on where to find the nearest place to apparate. She noted a nice side lane just up the street and began to make her way. She was so focused she did not hear the steps rush up behind her as a hand grabbed onto her wand arm pulling her into the side alley twisting her around and bracing her back against a solid body. </p>
<p>“Leaving so soon muddy? We didn’t even finish our timed date!” She cooed into her ear. Hermione was almost enraptured as she felt the breath tickle across her ear.</p>
<p>“How can you be here, you’re dead?” She moaned still questioning everything as she was aware how intimate the hold on her was from the dark witch behind her.</p>
<p>“ Don't always believe rumours pet. I could ask you the same thing? Half the wizarding world has been wondering where their Golden girl had disappeared over the last three years. Who knew she would just waltz into muggle speed dating session right across from little old me!” </p>
<p>“What now?” Hermione asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>“Not sure Pet, Quite enjoying the thought of having you underneath me again, And judging by those sweet little fleeting thoughts I’m seeing floating round your head I’d say you would enjoy it too”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t fight it as Bellatrix Disapparated them away</p>
