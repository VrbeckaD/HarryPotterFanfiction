    <p>Draco Malfoy was a lot of things but friendly was not one of them. This much Thalia knew from her infrequent interactions with the man. She understood that the passing of his wife was painful, but she also knew the bitterness that he exuded in social settings was just a natural by-product of his personality. His son was slightly more welcoming – if he wasn’t attending Hogwarts. Thalia had only met his son once and had heard only good things from Hermione Weasley, a Ministry colleague, about the boy. She still had her doubts about the boy's father who seemed to scowl at her at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Thalia was obviously pleased that in her new role for the ministry, she had been assigned the task of analysing the dark artefacts collection that the Malfoys had accumulated throughout their long pure-blood ancestry but she was not pleased that every object she touched would come with the prying eyes and dismissive sighs of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p> <em>If I had as much money as the Malfoys, I wouldn’t be sitting alone in a big manor house, </em>Thalia had thought to herself. When she was younger, she had planned to travel as far away from England as possible but it seemed that life took her down a different path. </p>
<p>She picked up another artefact in the main study. Draco had kindly opened the cases this time instead of insisting that she examine them through the glass.</p>
<p>“What is your title again Ms Willows?” Draco stood behind her with folded arms and a grimace.</p>
<p>“I am an archivist and alchemist for the department of deadly and dark histories and artefacts,” Thalia sighed and lowered the small box from the light. She was relieved that her response had placated him then heard him begin to walk around the room.</p>
<p>“That’s a long title for someone so young,” He commented.</p>
<p>“I’m 30 years old Mr Malfoy,” She sighed.</p>
<p>“Oh, you look much younger,” His voice was suddenly tense.</p>
<p>“Do you know it’s inappropriate to ask a Ministry official, and a woman no less, their age?” She mumbled just loud enough for him to hear.</p>
<p>“It was <strong>only</strong> a question Ms Seiren,” He replied snarkily. The hairs on the back of her neck bristled and she rolled her eyes as she tried to think of a snappy response. She resorted to a deep sigh instead. After all, she was here to work not fight with Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>He thankfully let silence envelop them both.</p>
<p>Thalia’s eyes returned to the task at hand.</p>
<p>The box seemed to be the size of a muggle snuff box. She placed it down on the desk in front of her and putt on her leather gloves and glasses. She had managed to enchant the glasses herself. Instead of enhancing her vision, she would be able to see the marks left behind by whatever magical processes were used. From that she could decide whether she should open the box. She held the box back up and turned it under the flickering oil lamp.</p>
<p>Along the silver were deep scratches and engravings that glowed with deep purples and greens. That was not a good sign but then again, she had to remind herself she was cataloguing a collection of dark artefacts. She didn’t want to risk opening it, so she turned in her chair.</p>
<p>“Can I ask Mr Malfoy what you presume this box to be or do?” She held the box with an outstretched arm and tried to not roll her eyes at Draco’s sneer before he walked across the room to snatch it from her. It was still shocking to her that he wasn’t dressed in a traditional robe. Instead Malfoy wore a black knitted sweater with a pair of dark coloured trousers. It just seemed very un-Malfoy to Thalia. Then the image she had constructed of Malfoy was based on photographs in the Daily Prophet and gossip. There was a 9-year age difference so she had no clue what he had dressed like at Hogwarts when he wasn’t wearing the uniform. That was a long time ago now anyway. The beard and long icy hairstyle was the only indicator of his family history. He looked very much like his father with longer hair.</p>
<p>“I thought you were an alchemist – shouldn’t you at least be somewhat intelligent?” He chided. “It, as far I can tell from family records, absorbs memories and burns them. I am quite sure that a skilled witch, or wizard, could pick a particular date or time of erasure.” He said nonchalantly which made Thalia raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Have you used it?” Thalia immediately winced at her own question. Draco sneered again. It was becoming his default expression around Thalia.</p>
<p>“Of course not, I’m not an imbecile.” He thrust the box back into her hand. “Excuse me I have other things to attend to.” The door to the study slammed behind him.</p>
<p>“What a peculiar man,” Thalia whispered underneath her breath before turning back to cataloguing.</p>
<p>Many hours passed before Thalia realised that Draco had not returned.</p>
<p>She had now visited the manor at least three times over the course of a year and never had Draco left her alone. He hadn’t asked many questions or spoken more than a couple of words, but he had stood behind her the entire time. Thalia had sat in other pureblood homes and been at the end of what she could only describe as interrogation. Other clients were usually obsessed with her heritage and her family line. On one occasion, an eager old woman had dragged in her nervous grandson for Thalia to meet and possibly consider to be her next husband. Being the boy looked no older than 20, Thalia had to politely decline, explain she was actually 30 years old, and then had the case assigned to someone else in the department.</p>
<p>She scooted back her chair and found herself opening the door to peer awkwardly into the hall. She heard nothing so turned back to cleaning up her work and pack her bag. The ledger slid into her satchel then she made a point of taking out her wand to restore the enchantments that Draco had used on the glass cases. She also made sure to lock it with her wand which no doubt Malfoy would complain about.</p>
<p>She pulled on her coat, adjusted her bag strap and checked her makeup in the glass of the cabinets before forcing herself to walk with purpose out into the hall. She turned wildly through the labyrinth that was the Malfoy home. She came into a room that must have been a library when she decided that she probably should have stayed in the study. The house was far too big for her liking.</p>
<p>Pulling back the sleeve of her coat, she glanced at her watch and tried not to scream in frustration. It was already 5pm – she had been there for nearly 6 hours and if she couldn’t find a way out she was going to be there a lot longer than that.</p>
<p>A portrait on the wall eyed her suspiciously and even walked into the next frame to stare at her. </p>
<p>"Are you lost there, little girl?" The Edwardian dressed man asked sweetly. Thalia just rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>Why had Weasley set her up on a blind date tonight of all nights? She had been looking forward to it but now she was trapped with one of the most hated men in the wizarding world. She began to angrily, but with restraint, wrestle with the strap of her bag as she hissed swear words underneath her breath. When she finally became calm, she heard a chuckled. She turned and froze.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy stood less than 5 feet behind her with a smirk. “Lost, are we?”</p>
<p>"The young lady has been standing here for nearly ten minutes," The portrait answered for her.</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t disappeared, I wouldn’t have had to wander around your excessively large home,” Thalia said before walking towards him and giving the portrait a good glare. </p>
<p>“If you had stayed in the study, I would have come to collect you so you would have never gotten lost,” Draco was still smirking. Why was that annoying?</p>
<p>“Well if you hadn’t stormed away after having some sort of tantrum then I wouldn’t have thought to show myself out,” She said calmly. “Now if you would be so kind, I would very much like to leave. I would apparate from inside your home but due to your protective charms, I cannot.”</p>
<p>Draco’s smirk continued but he simply shrugged then turned to show her through the winding halls. Thalia watched his back as he led her through the corridors. It was strange under the dim oil lamps that were scattered through the mansion, he looked younger. When he looked back over his shoulder to check she was still there, Thalia pushed an unwanted thought back down into the disgusting hole it came out of. He wasn’t unattractive. His grey eyes were too guarded for Thalia to gauge what he was thinking.</p>
<p>When they came back to the front door, Draco paused.</p>
<p>The smirk had dropped and instead his grimace returned. “When will you come back for the rest?”</p>
<p>“When is convenient for you Mr Malfoy? It should only take maybe 16 more hours,” Thalia feigned professionalism but felt frustration at her own estimation. She had passed up too many cases for the boss not to question the request to pass this one onto someone else.</p>
<p>“Next weekend would suit me,” Draco said without meeting her gaze and an air of apathy that seemed forced. “I know most ministry don’t work weekends, but it would be very good for me to just get this all over with. If it is an inconvenience, I would always allow you to stay for dinner if you liked.”</p>
<p>Thalia blinked. <em>Did Draco Malfoy just ask me out? No, he wouldn’t be suggesting that. He clearly hates me. Don’t be so stupid Thalia.</em></p>
<p>“I will have to discuss it with my supervisors but… that is a very… polite and generous offer Mr Malfoy. I will send an owl when it is confirmed.” She smiled. The words felt like a lie. Her managers would never agree to her working at anyone’s house over the weekend, let alone a wizard connected to a family of death-eaters.</p>
<p>She nodded a goodbye and walked away from the manor in a dream.</p>
<p>When she got far enough, she apparated to Diagon Alley for her date.</p>
