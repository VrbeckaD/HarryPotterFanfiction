    <p>She bit his shoulder to silence her scream as she convulsed on Harry's cock, his knowledgeable fingers playing her clit just the way she liked it.</p><p>No, <em>loved</em><em> </em>it.</p><p>Harry's head rested against hers as he sought to calm his breathing, the nap of his trousers pressed against the sensitive flesh of her inner thighs. </p><p>"Merlin, 'Mione."</p><p>Hermione grinned up at him and stretched backwards across the kitchen table, confident it would take her weight as it had done so many times before. She could still hear Ron yelling in the other room as he listened to Cannons lost to the Falmouth Falcons as they did every time the two teams played one another. Harry pulled out in a gush of come and he gathered the wetness on his fingertips, bringing them to her lips. She sucked them clean and gently bit the tips as Harry's ears turned red, a sure sign he was still aroused. Normally when any Quidditch game was on, they'd have plenty of time to fuck before Ron would notice their absence, but Ginny was home for the season due to an injury that put her on the reserves and she was expecting Harry to return in a reasonable amount of time. It wasn't like when all of them were in school and Harry and Hermione could sneak off to the Room of Requirement for hours of sex by telling everyone they were "studying."</p><p>"Are you going to come by for lunch this week?"</p><p>The question, while sounding innocuous, was code for semi-public sex since Harry got off on fucking his lover in places they could be discovered. Well, if Hermione was completely honest, she got off on it too (pun fully intended).</p><p>She pretended to ponder it, as if she would ever turn down an opportunity to have sex with him, and Harry got that reckless glint in his eyes she loved so much. He bent down until his head was level with her wet cunt and started licking gently in long swipes; he'd persuaded her a few years ago to keep her pussy shorn of hair and she'd been hesitant at first until the first time he'd gone down on her. Now she couldn't imagine anything else, especially since most days she didn't wear knickers just in case Harry managed to get away from Ron long enough for a quickie. It helped their offices were only two levels apart and their departments regularly interacted so no one batted an eye when either popped in for a quick chat.</p><p>"Harry? Hermione? What's taking so long? I'm starving!"</p><p>Ron's voice was close as he was walking down the short hallway between the lounge and the kitchen. Harry's devilish tongue didn't stop and Hermione's belly swooped with nervous excitement at the thought of her husband walking in on their best friend kneeling between her thighs. It was a common fantasy they indulged in, having Ron walk in and being forced to watch them finish a fuck. Harry was her first lover, after all, and even when she started dating and eventually married Ron, and Harry with Ginny, they never stopped their relationship. At first they kept it a secret because Harry was terrified of his enemies using Hermione to get to him, and then the illicit nature excited them. She knew he loved her as deeply as she loved him, but now it was too complicated to cut through the ties that bound them to other people. It was enough that they spent a majority of their time together in both personal and professional ways with plenty of excuses to fuck. Sometimes she wondered if Ginny knew, if the other woman realized when she went down on Harry she was tasting Hermione's cunt, and had been for years. Hermione had even been present in a way when Harry devirginized the youngest Weasley as he'd went to Ginny's bed with his dick still wet with Hermione's come.</p><p>Of course she should've realized Harry would never jeopardize their lives because by the time Ron breached the kitchen's threshold, they were both respectably dressed and industriously busy making sandwiches that Harry magicked up in the bare second before Ron showed up. Hermione smiled sweetly at her husband, feeling Harry's seed trickle down her thighs.</p>
