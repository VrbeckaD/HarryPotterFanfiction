<p>Information</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Walking over to the Floo, Draco stood there for a long moment. Harry coughed. “Maybe we should call someone else. Is there anyone else you can think of who could help?”</p>
<p>“No.” Squaring his shoulders, Draco reached for the Floo powder. “It’s fine. I just had to…prepare myself.” </p>
<p>Kreacher moaned, distracting Harry, and when he looked again, Narcissa’s face was in the fireplace. </p>
<p>Draco cleared his throat. “Hello, Mother.” </p>
<p>“Draco?” Narcissa blinked. “I didn’t expect— This isn’t your address—”</p>
<p>“I’m visiting Grimmauld Place.” </p>
<p>“Oh?” Narcissa smiled. “Well, I’m so glad you called. You’ve heard the news, I take it?”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“News?” Draco shook his head. “Actually, I called to get some information.” </p>
<p>“Ah.” Narcissa exhaled. “Of course. What do you need?” </p>
<p>“The Grimmauld house-elf’s ill, and—”</p>
<p>“Kreacher?” Narcissa looked alarmed. “What’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“We’ve no idea, but I though you’d know the location of the elf Healer. Do you?” </p>
<p>“Yes, of course.” Narcissa narrowed her eyes. “Wait, didn’t Harry inherit Grimmauld from cousin Sirius?”</p>
<p>Draco coughed. “Yes—”</p>
<p>“I’m glad things are going well with you two.” Narcissa hummed. “Right, give me a moment and I’ll come through.” </p>
<p>“You don’t have to—”</p>
<p>“Of course I do, Draco. Now step aside.” </p>
