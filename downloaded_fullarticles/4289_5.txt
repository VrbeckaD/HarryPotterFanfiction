    <p>Traditional prompt #1: An Owl</p>
<p>Harry stood on the front porch of his little chalet bungalow, drinking his morning tea and watching the sunrise. It was chilly on the coast, the breeze from the ocean almost frigid in early December. He shivered, drawing his cloak about him more securely as he drank more tea and waited. The sky's colours grew in before him, the purple night sky bleeding away into vibrant reds, oranges, pinks and blues.</p>
<p>He sighed when he finished the tea, giving the dregs a cursory glance before dumping the unreadable leaves into the little compost bin beside the house. Setting the cup aside, Harry leaned back and nibbled on his toast, taking in the solitude. It was quiet in Millport, in spite of the tourist-filled summers, and Harry breathed in the peacefulness.</p>
<p>Narrowing his eyes and leaning forward, Harry spied a dark spot on the horizon. The mark smeared the rainbow of this morning, and an unsettling feeling drifted over him when the smudge on the sky moved closer, veered toward him.</p>
<p>The blotch became wings and Harry straightened as the owl homed in on his person. The animal swooped around the house once and came back about before it then landed right on front of him on the veranda railing.</p>
<p>Harry watched the bird breathe, its large chest swelling with each inhale, a parchment clutched in its curled talon. Huge dark eyes studied him, almost as if making certain he was its intended recipient. He supposed that it had been a bit rough getting through the protection spells he'd cast and felt a bit sorry for the owl. He also wondered just how the bird had found him. Very few people bothered with him as of late.</p>
<p>"You got something for me?" Harry asked and held out his palm to the bird. The owl hopped closer and deposited the missive into Harry's hand. </p>
<p>Unrolling the parchment, Harry read the note and got an answer to his question. </p>
<p>Swallowing the knot in his throat, Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could still feel the bird watching him and with a sigh, he turned and walked into the house. Taking a quill from off his desk, he turned the note over and gave his response.</p>
<p>Digging through the cupboard, netted him some owl treats, and he hoped they weren't too stale. Stepping back outside, he offered them to the owl. The bird ate the treats and swiped Harry's response, and then took to the skies.</p>
<p>Harry watched the owl fly away, his heart pounding nearly out of his chest as his answer winged its way to Britain.</p>
