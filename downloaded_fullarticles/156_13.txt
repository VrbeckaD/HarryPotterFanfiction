          <u>Early January 1979, somewhere in the middle of Diagon Alley.</u>

      </p><p>What is infidelity?</p><p>The most correct definition would be the lack of fidelity or betrayal in the relationship by one of the two people in a sexual way. However, would it be just that? It also existed emotionally, but when do you term emotional infidelity without going as far as becoming toxic. Is it wrong for you to be attracted to a person being engaged?</p><p>No, of course not, on the contrary, would the problem arise if you started to like it? Lily Evans thought curiously.</p><p>However, is it something acceptable to fall in love while in a commitment and be called infidelity, even if you are not physically unfaithful? Is having sex out of desire and still loving your partner an infidelity? When did you call it that? Should it be with just the breach of one of those aspects or would it have to be both, that way it would be officially called infidelity?</p><p>Lily asked herself a second time. Although, from her own experience, she could tell that it was either one, they were both painful.</p><p>He looked again at the papers James was holding with great anguish. His notorious nervousness, the small beads of sweat falling down his temple. How apprehensive must a person be to show that painful image? He questioned himself, watching him closely.</p><p>The divorce papers were ready to be signed, the decision was final on Lily's part.</p><p>Two months had passed since the breakup and James's discontent was still very noticeable, despite being one of the culprits of the situation.</p><p>"Lily," says James apprehensively. He gulps, the sound is loud in the quiet environment.</p><p>Lily tilts her head slightly, her hand barely resting on her belly.</p><p>He holds the pen in his right hand, the ink waiting patiently on the table. Outside where they are, everything follows its normal course. Things go on without a pause, yet it feels so different.</p><p>Lily <em>hates him</em> , hates that James has marked her life so hard that now everything is different for her. You want to go back in time and tell your younger self not to fall for this man's lies.</p><p>She licks her parched lips, and looks up to match that of her still husband.</p><p>"Where do I sign?" He asks. James looks at her; it's a painful look.</p><p>You shouldn't see yourself as the victim, she thinks furiously. The hand near her belly turns into a fist, her knuckles forcibly white. It fills her with rage that he dares to see her so devastated when all this happened for him.</p><p>"I don't want to do this," he repeats the same sentence again. Lily sees him, this time disinterested in his words.</p><p>"This is not about what you want or not, James," he repeats; He makes a nasty little grimace, "Because if that's the case, that's something you already did and it didn't go so well for you, did it?"</p><p>The resentment still intact for what happened, the desire to make this person cry not so hidden in him as he wanted.</p><p> James flinches at the accusation; he ducks his guilty face.</p><p>He smiles gracelessly, more like a grimace. "I have explained how things were, I do not understand why you can not understand it," he claims without force. He looks at him exhausted from all this; He had always adored his wife's stubbornness, but now he really cursed her.</p><p>Lily stares at him, stunned by his impudence, "Why can't I understand?", She repeats with her eyes open.</p><p>She lets out a hysterical laugh. You can't believe what James just said; she takes it as a joke. It is after he finishes laughing that he sees her serious face, her jaw clenched; notice the beginnings of irritation on him. Lily shakes her head slowly, her amusement slowly fading, giving way to fury. He feels the anger deep in his chest when he speaks.</p><p>Why can't I understand ?! Why can't i understand ?! Why can't I understand ?! ”, repeats the last question screaming.</p><p>He throws himself on the table; She looks wild with her flowing red hair and sparkling eyes. She is furious and looks angrily at James, his latent magic and anger in the room.</p><p>“You are incredible, what because I cannot understand? Listen to yourself and do us the favor of not repeating those words, ”I mumbled angrily. James raises his head, indignant.</p><p>“It wasn't all my fault! You know it well! I was not aware of what I did. "He claims, getting up," I would never have deceived you if it had been in other causes. Damn it, Lily, I'm just asking you to understand me. ” He screams, exasperated.</p><p>She looks at him with contempt. “There is nothing to understand here. You cheated on me and that's something that no matter how you want to mask it it won't change, James. You can excuse yourself in a thousand ways, but the truth will still be only one "</p><p>James looks at her, determined not to end his marriage and part with Lily. So, he decides to use a topic not yet discussed between them to get it.</p><p>"We are going to have a child," he begins, "tell me how he will feel with his two parents separated. The baby needs a family, he needs us both! ” He protests, though he feels the shame curl up inside him when he finishes saying that last one. Using such a mean subject to get his wife's forgiveness is humiliating, but he had no choice. He doesn't plan to give up until he uses everything in his hands to get what he wants.</p><p>Lily raises her head, it is a slow and deliberate movement that makes her hair fall to the sides of her face favoring her features. James feels his breath catch when he sees her, that woman is so precious that he overwhelms him, makes him want to venerate her as his goddess, the fervent need to touch her is cut off when he sees her gaze; She looks at him with all the displeasure of an angry queen that only Lily can boast of performing.</p><p> "My son will have me, James Potter." She says in a soft voice; her eyelashes flutter giving it a certain charm. James loses his concentration at the small gesture, that's when Lily cracks his features into something more aggressive to announce, “He will have everything and more than he will want; absolutely nothing will be missing, therefore, you have no proof that what you say will happen, ”he growls through clenched teeth.</p><p>"And if you are so worried about what happened to him, then you just have to fulfill your responsibilities as a father and be aware of him," Lily smiles with a certain condescension. James's face serious, surely analyzing the situation.</p><p>"Also, tell me, you shouldn't be more worried about your other child who is closer to being born or maybe your beloved soul mate won't let you be near her," he asks, enunciating each word. Her lashes fall heavy, darkening the green of her eyes. The slightest curve at the corners of her lips. She will not miss the slightest opportunity to hurt him.</p><p>James lifts his chin, he's quick to answer. Excuse me, but that is a matter that does not concern you, Lily. He refutes immediately, then notes: “He will be recognized as my son, but, of course, our son will be the one to become the Potter heir no matter what is said. It is their legitimate place, no factor will not interfere in that. ”, He firmly declares. Look carefully for any change in her face; some softening or softness that lets you know you agree with it.</p><p>The weariness of everything seems to make Lily succumb to a more indolent posture; He shakes his head heavily, already bored with the whole thing. "You're right," she consents, exhausted from arguing, "I don't care about that, I don't really care about anything. Let's get this over with, where do I sign? ”He asks without spirit.</p><p>James watches her quietly. He inhales loudly scared, the reality of things finally taking a weight on him. He sees Lily, who is carefully rereading the papers, the decision to sign them seems indisputable. Feel how the situation drowns him, the feeling is creepy. One of his worst fears is taking place in front of him and there is nothing he can do to combat it. Defeat feels filthy in the contours of his mouth. Feel the beginnings of tears pricking her eyes. He breathes anxiously and in his panic he bites down hard on the inside of his mouth. The blood on his tongue and incisors manages to distract him from the past dread.</p><p>James smirks and turns his face away, his hair becoming his best ally by covering his expression.</p><p>Lily looks at him, the handsome profile of the man illuminated by natural light from a window makes him so attractive. OMG, she thinks desperately and in fierce panic. The feelings he had tried so hard to keep begin to overflow inside him. Grief and sadness were mixed so deeply that it is impossible to distinguish them separately. She looks with wet eyes at James, and how beautiful he has become is the thought that crosses his mind. The traces of a jovial youth have given way to an attractive maturity that adheres to it in a flattering way. For the first time he realizes how different he looks compared to their first meeting; the first time they were a <em>something</em> .</p><p>Disappointment and anger are his companions this day, but the penalty of treason too. She loves this man like no one else, but she loves herself more and that is why it is necessary to end this; to let go of what no longer exists and be able to look at a new future alone for the first time. James has been so embodied in his life that he has never done anything independent or without his influence. And it was time for her to take charge of her own life as an adult.</p><p>He turns to see her, his expression has not changed, only his eyelashes are wet.</p><p> The "[... I promise to love and be faithful to you until the last day of my life ...]" on your wedding day seems so far away now. And she wants to tell him, express to James that the decisions one makes always have repercussions, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad.</p><p>Lily is strong and determined, but even she must remember that phrase at every moment, if she does not want to be tempted to forgive him and return to him.</p><p>"Where should I sign?" He repeats in a soft tone. James's expression is soft as a cotton candy, too sweet that is excessive. The sugary flavor of a soon-to-be ending curls into Lily's taste buds. There will be days that you will remember this moment and hope with all your heart that it does not hurt as it does at that moment.</p><p>He hands her the papers on the page where the agreement must be signed. Lily stains the pen with ink, waits a moment before signing, looks up to see her soon-to-be ex-husband.</p><p>"I love you," says James in a broken voice. The plea huddled in each syllable bliss. Her heart wasted and pitiful for what she was feeling, for what she was letting happen.</p><p>Lily looks at him with wide eyes and a tender heart.</p><p>"Me too," she replies with a sob; then sign.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Lily discovers infidelity with the arrival of the woman one day at her old home. She would declare herself as the soulmate of James and the future mother of her son.</p><p>The news is overwhelming in itself, too much to process at the time. James arrives in less than twenty minutes when urgently called by Lily and he finds himself in full discussion of both women.</p><p>His biggest secret revealed. His worst sin uncovered.</p><p>He manages to look as surprised as his wife when he discovers the advanced pregnancy of the woman named Cordelia and tries to explain things.</p><p>Apparently they had met at one of the ministry parties; both coming to recognize themselves among all that sea of people as the missing piece of what they needed.</p><p>James would be drunk enough not to make a consistent decision, according to his words, and use that as an excuse; and she, ready, with all the decision to sleep with a married man. Magic would have been fueling their union.</p><p>It would be one night's sex and from it would emerge a child of both, not guilty for the actions of his parents.</p><p>James would have tried to pretend that nothing had happened, too in love with his wife to ruin their marriage. Although fear and nervousness would escort him the weeks after that night. He would reach an agreement with Cordelia, in which he asked for absolute secrecy of what happened. She would have agreed, however, at that time, who would warn her how ignorant James was of the consequences of his actions.</p><p>Because of all that, he decided not to tell Lily about anything that had happened.</p><p>Why should he reveal something that would never be discovered?</p><p>However, despite all his plans, it all ended badly. Their marriage ended in divorce and ended with two children of different women; its reputation stained and with great negative on the part of the English society.</p><p>It is that instant that James makes a decision, but how could he have known that with that decision, he lost all opportunity to save things with his still wife?</p><p>It would be days later when he left when Lily would hear, from Remus's mouth, that James decided, for the sake of his first son, to move with Cordelia Lewis to one of the Potter's estates. The why? She doesn't know, Remus doesn't explain to her and she doesn't ask for reasons either.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>THE NEW POTTER HEIR IS BORN, TRUE OR FALSE? (March 13, 1979)</p><p> </p><p>
        <em>By Rita Skeeter, gossip correspondent for The Prophet.</em>
      </p><p>
        <em>The birth of every magical child is the cause of a great celebration and joy for the entire magical community. Of course, this case is not the exception. The entire public, who is awaiting the daily delivery of The Prophet, is aware of the scandalous breakup caused by the old Potter marriage (Lord Potter and the lady, now, Evans) and the appearance of the soul mate of James Potter. His sudden arrival is said to have been the culmination of that youthful romance that we all followed with great enthusiasm; However, for now, none of the protagonists of this fateful ending has decided to go out and comment on the subject.</em>
      </p><p>
        <em>Well, taking up the theme, this day is celebrated by the birth of James Potter's first son, Lord Potter, belonging to the old Potter family and Cordelia Lewis, who comes from a pureblood family, although not of widely recognized lineage. The union of both is unknown even by the public, there is not much information about their first meeting or their coexistence; It is also not known if Miss Lewis will become Lady Potter in the future. The only thing now known from very reliable sources is the child's godfather. That position has been assigned to Sirius Black, a member expelled from the most noble and ancestral house of the Blacks and auror with great expectations of promotion.</em>
      </p><p>
        <em>It is hoped that we will soon be able to learn more about the child's name from this union or a few words from the parents or their sponsor. On the other hand, there is still not much news about Lily Evans and her still developing pregnancy. However, a question that continues to haunt our audience is about which of their children will take command of the Potter family in the future.</em>
      </p><p>
        <em>Will he be Lord Potter's eldest son or the official son of his first marriage? Will soul bonding or ministry roles dominate more for him?</em>
      </p><p><em>Perhaps some of our doubts will be resolved over time, but for now, we will continue to report the latest developments in English magical society</em> .</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Andrew James Potter was born in the early morning hours of March 13, 1970 at the San Mungos hospital.</p><p>His distraught father is seen walking all over the floor, too nervous to sit still. Sirius Black, Remus Lupine and Peter Pettigrew accompanied him together from the day before his birth. The others, friends and acquaintances of the couple, also wait outside the room.</p><p>He is born in the comfort of a safe place with a large group of people waiting to see him. He is received between soft blankets and sweet pampering by both parents.</p><p>His mother's sister is chosen as godmother and his father's best friend becomes his godfather.</p><p>A group of journalist tries to know his face and information about him to show it to the public, but they are quickly rejected and removed from the place.</p><p>By the end of the day the news spreads that James Potter's first son, Lord Potter, is born safe and sound. The bright future that the little magician will have is animatedly discussed, as has been done with all the magical children.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>

      </p><p> </p><p>Lily looks bravely at her fate and firmly decides to continue with her plan, despite all the doubts that ask her not to do it, how bad is what she will do.</p><p> She is curled up in one of the corners of Diagon Alley, the hood of her robe covering her with prying eyes. Take a deep breath to calm down and make the decision to continue with what was planned.</p><p>The place is lighter due to the end of the year parties, the people still lazy to want to buy and all this makes it easier for them to get there quickly</p><p> The crossing to your stop is fast, it doesn't give you time to think about turning back and escaping.</p><p>Gringotts' broad and elegant façade welcomes her when she enters.</p><p>The elves are scattered in columns, each with its own desk. She is avidly followed by all their eyes because of her clothing. It heads quickly to almost the end of one of the columns.</p><p>The creature you choose decides not to pay attention to it; is focused on stamping documents one by one. Lily has to clear her throat to raise her head to look at her.</p><p>"Good afternoon, I request a conference with the elf Kalash." Report kindly. The goblin makes a disdainful grimace, is irritated at being interrupted from his duties.</p><p>"And who is supposed to be asking for it?" He asks sullenly, rising to his minuscule height. Lily, out of courtesy, decides to remove her hood revealing her striking red hair; she runs, for a moment, her fingers all over him.</p><p>"I am Lily Evans, I have come to request a withdrawal that involves one of Lord Potter's assets." Respond formally; From his pocket he takes out some folded papers.</p><p>The goblin looks at her suspiciously, but accepts the papers given to them. It doesn't take too long to finish reading them.</p><p>Smile, somewhat grotesque and smug.</p><p>"Please join me here, Miss <em>Evan</em> s," he says. Lily decides not to pay attention to the mocking tone with which the elf pronounces her name.</p><p>Vault Keeper Potter walks quickly down a sumptuous path. She keeps up with him, quickly realizing that he is not leading her to where the vaults are. Pucker your nostrils.</p><p> Both arrive in a room overcrowded with decoration and valuable objects. There is so much gold and silver that you need to blink to get used to it.</p><p>"Have a seat," the goblin orders, sitting down at a high desk, looking at her with shrewd eyes. "Miss Evans, the withdrawal you request cannot be made. The document you have given me is the title deed to the Potter mansion, not a permit for a retreat, ”he mockingly explains.</p><p>Lily smiles gently to mask her disgust at the deal. "I am very clear about that, elf Kalash," he begins, "however, I find myself in need of liquidity and not of a material good for now." He murmurs, articulating each word. The meaning behind the obvious sentence.</p><p>The leprechaun smiles in a cartoonish way. "Well, for now, it is impossible for him to leave this bank with a single galleon of ours unless he comes with a paper signed by Lord Potter in which the amount of money to withdraw is specified in detail," he would stubbornly report, without taking as an option what she was implying.</p><p>Lily would sigh, the desire to purse her lips barely opaque. ” I think you don't understand me. I need money and I have a mansion at my disposal. ", I would emphasize directly," I am sure you can find a way to make this a beneficial agreement for both of us, right? "She says.</p><p>The calculating glow in her green eyes.</p><p>The leprechaun takes a deep breath, stunned. "Do you know what you are talking about?" He asks, stunned, "The last mansion belonging to an important thoroughbred family was sold by <em>millions</em> of galleons," reveals him energetically. The nuance of his voice does not lose for a single second the greed in him.</p><p>Lily laughs, it's a low, subtle sound. "Yes, I discovered that recently," he admits; his eyes narrow.</p><p>"I wish three million galleons and that James Potter be notified of the mansion's endeavor before anyone else." His smile expands further. "In exchange for all that said, you will be awarded two percent of my loan and if Lord Potter does not agree to pay the debt, you will be in charge of orchestrating the auction of her." He ends up staring at him.</p><p>Kalash looks at her and takes time to think about the request; then he gives a harsh laugh.</p><p>"Well, Miss Evans," she smiles, "I think we have an agreement. Let me, I need some time to write the papers. ” Inform.</p><p>With Lily's silent nod, the goblin leaves the room satisfied.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>The paperwork takes approximately three hours, between reading and writing the details on both sides.</p><p>"I want a bag with three hundred thousand galleons in it, as well as the payment of half the money in a vault that will only be accessed by my son when he grows up," Lily says suddenly after finishing reading another document.</p><p>The goblin looks at her a moment before nodding.</p><p>"The papers are ready, you just have to sign them."</p><p> “The Potter mansion was agreed as a guarantee in exchange for the loan of three million galleons. The requested time before sending a letter to Lord Potter is one month, if he does not agree with the payment of the bill, Gringotts will take the liberty of starting an auction for the property. In addition, half of the money is requested from an account, which will be only for the first Potter-Evans son. Do you agree to the said conditions, Miss Evans? ”Asks the elf.</p><p>Magic begins to press Lily for an answer. The beginning of a magical agreement supposes. She clenches her teeth, she had heard of these binding contracts, but did not expect this to be one.</p><p>"That's right, those are my conditions," he replies with a tight voice. Just after saying your answer, the weight you feel lightens until it disappears.</p><p>"Very well, wait a moment here, I will bring you a bag with your money," says the creature, starting to walk away from the desk.</p><p>"Wait," she stops him on time, "I'd like to know about your housing service. I am aware that you can take charge of finding a property ”. Lily partially turns to see him.</p><p>Kalash raises his eyebrows in dismay. "Are you looking for a specific house or mansion?" He asks, approaching again.</p><p>Lily licks her lips, “You could say yes. I want something that is more <em>private,</em> but still remains in some magical community. It should be medium, enough for two people and in a safe place. " Specifies.</p><p>The goblin taps the desk with its nails. "It will be very difficult to find something in districts with a lot of magic population with the characteristics you want." "The only thing that comes to mind is some muggle suburb, yet that's something you're not looking for, <em>right</em> ?" Lily smiles coldly at the elf's irony. This was his first time here and he could already empathize with all those who gossiped about these creatures as the worst.</p><p>"I think I have made very clear the preferences in which I want housing," he rebukes with acid sweetness, "if it is too much for you, you can tell me; I'm sure I'll find someone more qualified for the job, ”she scoffs.</p><p>Kalash bangs on the desk in fury. The daring of this witch thinks annoyed. “Gringotts is characterized by its excellence in all its services! We guarantee you, Miss Evans ”, contempt drips in every syllable that says in your voice,“ that we will find the house you are waiting for. ”</p><p>Lily nods without taking her eyes off her, "she will also need protections and charms," she adds to the list of requirements. “In the following days I will send her a note with the needs that she must have and if it is necessary to make renovations, let me know. On the other hand, I want him to have all the necessary barriers, that money is not an obstacle, ”he boldly demands.</p><p>"The budget for all expenses will be sent to you by owl tomorrow," the elf informs him, writing down all the requests.</p><p>The red-haired witch ponders whether it is wise to say the question she has. There is a certain chance that they can contact the ministry and ruin their plans beforehand, which would complicate matters too much. He decides to dare and ask.</p><p>"Is there a way to go unnoticed by the regularities of international flu dust?" Kalash blinks curiously at the question.</p><p>"Do you plan to travel to a specific destination?" He asks. Lily shakes her head.</p><p>“I want to go to various places, however, the departures by magicians are regularized and registered by the ministries. I know that one can only Appear in previously known places, as well as, getting to a new place is only possible with the flu powder and I do not want to take the porters into account because of my state. ” He removes a streak that fell near his face with his hand.</p><p>“You can use the chimneys of the Gringotts facilities to move if you want, of course, the cost is higher; however, we guarantee you absolute discretion about your destiny ”, Lily raises an eyebrow, surprised by his service. She shifts in her seat, uncomfortable for doing something illegal.</p><p>"What sets them apart from the ministry?" He asks. His hooded eyes, attentive to the answer.</p><p>Kalash lifts his chin imperceptibly, a gesture more arrogant and arrogant than it seems at first glance. "Our bank is not under the rules of any magician," he explains with some disdain, "we are an entity that has its own rules and laws. You can be sure that the information provided by you will be safe with us ”, his resolution is firm.</p><p>Lily thinks about it for a moment. She needs to get away from Britain and go unnoticed for a few months due to her pregnancy. I was more than sure that James will use everything in his hands to try to find her, but if he played his cards well, that would not happen sooner than planned.</p><p>He looked decisively at the goblin, "Book a way out in three days, at 4 pm," he spoke, getting up. She smoothed with her hand the pleats of her skirt caused by all the time sitting.</p><p>"Of course, is there anything else we can help her with?" Asks the goblin, putting down the pen.</p><p> Lily smiles with the emotion bubbling in her stomach, there is a certain euphoria in the decisions she is making. You may feel the danger of doing something that is not correct.</p><p>"No, there is nothing else. Thank you very much, Kalash, I hope you meet the confidentiality criteria you mentioned to me, ”he repeats before retiring.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Lily Evans comes out, with a heavy bag of galleons in her left pocket and a bright future ahead of Gringotts. Under his hood he smiles with emotion.</p><p>It doesn't take a few liberties to spend on everything you think is necessary.</p><p>Three days later he returns to the bank to leave the country. Next to it is a dragon skin suitcase with everything you need for your stay abroad.</p><p>Short hair barely reaches her chin, she wears a tunic of deep green tones. It looks very different with only small changes.</p><p>At no time do you feel sorry for leaving your country of birth behind.</p><p>"Are you ready, Miss Evans?" Asks the goblin in charge of the Potter vaults and also yours. The aftertaste of knowing that is satisfying to her; his grudge for treason not yet forgotten.</p><p>"What is the destination the lady is going to?" Asks another unknown elf.</p><p>Gringotts fireplaces are handled differently, at no time is the magic or hand of a wizard or witch allowed; even in small actions as flimsy as the flickering of dust.</p><p>Lily smiles broad and bright; and it says: "Jaisalmer, India."</p><p>She advances.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>

      </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to go look for her again?" She asks.</p><p>James turns to see Cordelia, who is standing by the door frame.</p><p>"Did you come here just for that?" He asks, looking away.</p><p>Cordelia purses her lips in disgust. "I will never understand your love for dirty blood," he confesses.</p><p>James turns abruptly. "Don't call it that!" He growls, "if you have nothing more to say; then you better go. " He grabs a couple of papers carelessly and shoves them tightly into his briefcase.</p><p>There is a heavy silence between the two.</p><p> She crosses the distance with practiced grace until she reaches the front of James's desk. She looks at it calmly.</p><p>"What we have for you is still not enough, right?" she asks gently. There is a certain vulnerability that does not allow it to be seen when looking down. He presses both hands over the desk, his body slightly on one side. He takes time to calm down before intensely observing his partner.</p><p>He lets out a sigh, “Stop with that, Cordelia. You better than anyone know that this is not something I would have wanted. I'm not the person you should blame if this deal doesn't make you happy. " James smiles aggressive.</p><p>"What didn't you want?" He asks sarcastically, raising his sharp chin in defiance. "Oh, but, <em>darling</em> , you didn't show it to me that way that night," she hums maliciously.</p><p>James shows his teeth, furious at his words. Permanent anger at his mistake even his companion. He watches tense as she gets closer and closer to him, but he doesn't stop her.</p><p>"Shut-"</p><p>"Why, because you still can't accept that you were also guilty of this?" He interrupts, smiling, "You can continue to blame me, but you and I know that this decision was made by both of you," he whispers close. from his ear, just as he reaches her.</p><p>"What do you want to do with this?" He asks, looking at her.</p><p>“She does not love you, but you continue behind her, even when she has left the country for you. Somehow you cause me partial grief, Jamie, ”he whispers condescendingly.</p><p>James raises an eyebrow when he's done, taking the time to look at her closely, from the costly heeled feet to the ornaments on her hair. Cordelia trembles slightly in fury at what he is doing; again you are comparing it with <em>that one</em> .</p><p>"Do you know the reason why I don't give up?" He asks rhetorically. “Because I love her and I will not stop doing it, as well as looking for her while she is alive. It is something that I think you could hardly come to understand, "he confesses in an effort to hurt her.</p><p>Cordelia looks primly, smiles just a little. “Is that supposed to be something that hurts me, James?” He mutters in a silky voice, “because if so, you should practice even more. Lest your meetings with blood traitors and others cause a reduction in your vocabulary. ” He makes a small mocking sound as he walks away from him.</p><p>James takes a moment to watch her retreat.</p><p>She stands proud in the middle of the room, stopping, and turns to see him as if she feels his gaze.</p><p> It looks beautiful in the morning light; her dark hair loose. The sharpness of her cheekbones and the elegant lines of her body make an attractive combination for anyone. The arch of the lips is provocative. The thick lashes give it a mysterious and untouchable air. She is one of the most attractive women he has ever seen in thoroughbred circles. James feels the desire to burn with anxiety in the lower part of his stomach, the hunger he feels for this woman is no longer surprising, but now consumes him; blinds him from the consequences of his actions.</p><p>He licks his lips, his voice thick with lust. "I will not continue talking to you", ends the conversation gathering the rest of his things.</p><p>There is a sparkle in Cordelia's eyes that shows that she knows what James feels. "Of course Jamie," she smiles sweetly. "I'm sure we will discuss it in detail tonight," the intent behind his tone not unnoticed.</p><p>James looks at her hard before leaving.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>

      </p><p> "Yes, as I told you recently, that's what I need." Sirius looked at him with his arms crossed talking to James kneeling down talking to one of his acquaintances.</p><p>"Okay, I'll try to get as much information as I can. However, I promise you nothing; you know getting that kind of information is complicated, ”the other person murmured with the slight tone of apology. James's face closed.</p><p>"You owe me two favors, Arnold," his harsh and rebuking voice. "I thought saving your son's life would be worth more than a little bit of information, but I see that it is just a euphemism for what you said on that occasion."</p><p>There is a tense silence. Sirius looked curious at the other man's response, already used to the threatening James during his school years.</p><p>"I was, Potter," Arnold growls, irritated by the not-so-discreet insult. "Do you want the information? Well, you will have it tomorrow morning at your desk. ” He answers and then, at the next instant, ends the call.</p><p>James gets up from the floor, he is satisfied with the agreement.</p><p>"I suppose you've got what you wanted, but surely you know she's smart enough not to have gone that way, right?" Sirius casually asks. He lays his back on James' desk and looks at him long.</p><p>His closest friend decides to ignore it, and begins to read one of the papers thrown on the office chair. Sirius grimaces at the room, he personally is not a cleaning lover like Remus is, but he also doesn't enjoy being in a messy and dirty place. He knows that James thinks the same as him, so what a surprise it is to find his office in such a chaotic state, which not even the most complicated missions have accomplished.</p><p>There are papers, clothes, and liquor bottles, if what Sirius can see is correct, thrown away without care. Look closely at James, again, to see the beginnings of a scruffy rake, as well as his hair more tangled than usual.</p><p>He frowns, concerned.</p><p>"You look terrible, you know that?" Sirius waits a moment for an answer, but James still pays no attention to him. Her frown is furrowed, deep. The irritation begins to rise in the pit of your stomach. The temptation to growl is barely stifled; his instincts too awake with the desire to express his displeasure. He runs his tongue through his upper teeth, dedicates himself to playing a little more with the canines, pricking himself lightly with them.</p><p>He smiles sullenly, "If it wasn't your intention to answer any of my questions and concerns, then you would have warned me instead of sending a letter to meet us, Jamie"</p><p>James looks up, rubs one of his hands across the bridge of his nose. Sirius notices the dark bags under his eyes.</p><p>"It's not that, Padfoot," he explains, slamming down onto the couch, regardless of whether he was crushing various documents. "It's just that I'm concerned; I have no idea where it may be and the longer it is away, the more difficult it will be to find it. "</p><p>James looks at Sirius wearily. He feels exhausted, it's been over a week since Lily disappeared from the room in Diagon Alley and any information he could gather about her is insufficient for his search.</p><p>Sirius looks at him thoughtfully, "Didn't she have a sister who was here in London?" He asks, trying to contribute something.</p><p>"Yes, yes, Petunia," Sirius nods, "Actually, it was the first time I went, you know, but he didn't answer any of my questions. He argued that he had not spoken to Lily since the death of his parents and was then <em>lovingly</em> invited to never step on his home again. ” James makes an annoyed snort.</p><p>"So that means he is not with his sister. This complicates things further, doesn't it? It will be too complicated for you if she goes out on Muggle roads, if so we lost track of her a long time ago, ”declares Sirius honestly.</p><p>"I do not think so. I have tried to locate it with a ritual, but this failed, which means that it is in some magic community or else it would have shown me its location, ”he explains. You are not ashamed to take all kinds of actions to get what you are looking for. He stares at Sirius for any sign of criticism, but none of it shows up on him. A wave of affection appears for the loyalty it shows.</p><p>“Well, at least that makes things easier. Does Lily have close friends that I can turn to for help? ”James frowns at the thought of close people whom his proud and fierce Lily would go to for help; all he could think of was Snape, but impossible. They had long since ended their friendship and the pain his wife felt for her former friend was still present for what she remembered.</p><p>"No, she doesn't have anyone else she's close to," she runs her fingernails over the sofa material. "Also," he adds looking at his friend, "the past few months he hasn't been working to focus on various investigations, you know, to help Moony with his problem." James gestures with his hand; on the other hand, Sirius puts a hand to his chin thoughtfully.</p><p>"So I think everything is easier, right?" Sirius smiles to give James hope. She approaches him and drops her hand heavily on his shoulder, a comforting gesture. "That means that he has hardly left the country without having the necessary resources, and if Arnold has done it magically with his help, he will clarify the path for us."</p><p>James looks at him and sighs, "Yes, I suppose. I just want to find her, Padfoot, ”he mutters, hunched over himself.</p><p>Sirius presses both hands on his shoulder and brings his face closer to James'; he murmurs low and intimate smiling. "We will, Jamie. Don't worry, but take a break for now. You need it ”, he emphasizes in his last sentence.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

      </p><p> </p><p>The music resonates loudly, people parade in exquisite and bright costumes. There are dances and processions; a representation of how the Inca and the Colla, the rulers of that empire, once were in their domain.</p><p>He is rowdy, but he has an order that barely saves him from falling into chaos.</p><p>The Inti Raymi festival is something very spectacular for any public, held in the middle of the winter solstice. The ceremony is performed in Sacsayhuaman and the sun is awarded as the main protagonist; Lily, who had been there for about a week, could tell why.</p><p>The heat was hellish.</p><p>She was staying in one of the many cabins near a mountain. The cost, while not excessive like other places he stayed, was well worth his sight.</p><p>With great difficulty she got up from the window sill; her pregnancy already in its last stage would not take long until her son was born. A trip like this was dangerous for many factors, but she was stubborn and knew how necessary this celebration was.</p><p>Lily sighed, casting a refreshing spell on her again.</p><p>He had investigated the importance of magic in pregnancies. Usually, during the conception of the baby, it was suggested that it be performed during an important festival or ceremony, in which magic is more present and can endow the child with future notable features.</p><p>The same was said to occur during pregnancies; Thoroughbreds still held the idea of how vital it is for a child to grow up with both parents and in a magical home so that he is born strong and healthy. Conservative ideas that were too limiting on both sides if they wanted a divorce. Those theories had been debunked with the appearance of many Muggle-born wizards with enough magical strength to refute their points, but despite this, the idea continued from generation to generation.</p><p>Yet despite all the incongruities that conservatives fiercely said, manifested, or even asserted; Lily could see what was the point in if they wanted to communicate and the reason for encouraging this tradition, although she still did not agree on her way of acting.</p><p>Finding books that spoke of purist blood culture in magical Britain was inherently difficult; thoroughbreds were too jealous to share that knowledge. If finding that was complicated; Trying to learn about traditions, festivities and rituals were even more so with the increasingly restrictive measures by the Ministry. Traveling abroad and getting that kind of information was much more affordable than anywhere in Europe; Lily could confirm it by all the journey she had made.</p><p>Her son, for now, did not have a father who could be close to him permanently, because Lily would not allow herself to live with James again. Therefore, the chances that he would grow up surrounded by the magic of both parents were reduced to zero, unless he got a new partner to fill that role, which he would never do, not even for his son. Therefore, a great alternative that many magical researchers recommend in attending various festivals, communities and magical rituals in order to grant the rest of magic that cannot be obtained.</p><p>Lily grimaces; James would never have allowed her to leave Britain if she told him of her plans, she is sure that she would have put in various obstacles not to allow it with the excuse of her protection and health.</p><p>It is due to all this that, by her own decision, she traveled to various countries pursuing ceremonies and rituals. Immersing herself in activities with ancient and ancient magic was a completely different world for her, a girl born to Muggles and barely experienced in magic, who had only known what Hogwarts was and the other place that James had taken her.</p><p>Meeting new deities apart from magic itself, which even other magical communities preached was a very radical contrast to what I was used to.</p><p>He passed through India and its ceremonies in the desert; parties full of old-fashioned activities at night. He traveled to Italy where they commemorated blood magic, which was not something he had previously experienced.</p><p>The Alps and their great dances before the constellations and glaciers. The vibrant shows of Brazil, where nature and life were celebrated. The blessings received in China for her pregnancy and the encounters with magical creatures in the middle of Morocco and East Africa. The fantastic islands, deserted by all public and the knowledge of the sleeping volcanoes.</p><p>Throughout his journey he met so many people and unforeseen developments. The life and joviality conveyed to you by knowing something new was indescribable, a vulgar insult to express it with words. So many languages impossible to repeat, the intrinsic magic that would never be repeated and experiences so magnificent that they gave the value to his life that he had never expected to find. I never hope to discover that all those years that she lived would not really symbolize anything, that there was more to dream about and imagine and that she was able to free herself from her cage and remove the blindfold and say: there is more, there is much more . Lily discovered something that would haunt her to her death and that was</p><p>… That he wanted more and more, much more than the world could give him.</p><p>She now understood why magic was so important, what its great value was, and why it should be so highly praised. He found devout faith in her and could just proudly say that she was a witch.</p><p>Perhaps one did not feel ready to be a mother; but at last she had healed of her wounds and left everything that slowed her down.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>

      </p><p>Pain is like a beast trying to escape its body, desperate and furious for its freedom. It feels like needles puncturing the contours of your ribs and embedding itself inside your bones. It is similar to feeling an expulsion, but only that it is inside the stomach.</p><p>Lily could create thousands of similarities to compare what labor pain was like, and still fall short of how she really felt.</p><p>"You must keep pushing, the boy is in the wrong position, but he will come out. Come on, come on, push, ”encourages the witch who is playing the midwife. His Spanish has a strange accent to understand even with the language charm.</p><p>She growls, throwing her head back and doing as she is asked. Lily screamed as the pain settled over her hips, he mumbled and angrily insulted her at her directions. The matron looks at him unconcerned, not paying attention to the insults.</p><p>The two women behind her whisper something in their native dialect, the only one they spoke. Beyond is an old woman dressed in classic clothes from the Cuzco community, herbs in one hand and a glass in the other; He muttered nonstop without stopping doing a peculiar dance.</p><p>Damn crazy people, Lily thought in pain.</p><p>"You have to keep pushing or your son won't come out," remarks the midwife. Lily growls at him irritably.</p><p>"What do you think I'm doing?", He answers sullenly. Start breathing as you should to improve air circulation, inhale and exhale non-stop, or do so until a contraction takes your breath away.</p><p>Lily cries bitterly, too sore. Eight hours had passed since the labor contractions started and they were still there. I look with wet eyes at the women in her cabin, each of them starring in a role in this state.</p><p>His teeth chatter and his hands tremble. He makes a noise looking at his bulging stomach, there are too many doubts and coiled fear to calm down. What if it is not born well? If you are born sick or some complication? If he was even born dead? She cries loudly, it is too much, too much for herself; too much fear, loneliness and panic for me to resist. She wanted someone else to be with her, whoever, even the presence of James would reassure her.</p><p>The midwife began to yell at the pair of girls; they rushed to collect certain things. The old woman began to howl in coarse sounds and high-pitched whistles. Lily looks desperate.</p><p>"What's up ?! What's up ?! What's happening, tell me!" He yells at her, but no one hears him. The midwife seems thoughtful, but then shouts orders. One of the girls approaches Lily and holds her tightly by the arms, there is an apology on her face. She opens her eyes and begins to fight; he howls and screams for help.</p><p>The old woman approaches her and her voice is getting louder; Lily screams in horror, kicks and stirs, possessed of despair and fear.</p><p>She screams, "James, James" and other names like "Severus" are also repeated. She lets out a sob and says at the end: "Mom, Mom, please," she begs.</p><p>The matron grabs her face abruptly, her gaze is hard; looks fierce.</p><p>Listen to me, if we don't do this your son will die, Lily opens her eyes, her mouth and screams in anger. The woman clenches her teeth and slaps him furiously. "Calm down!" He yells at her.</p><p>"No!" Roars Lily, hurt by the news.</p><p>The midwife presses her hands on her belly looks at her, determined. "Right now you will feel a lot of pain and you must bear it, do you hear me? This child cannot be left without his mother," he orders, half screaming. Lily stares at her, gasping loudly.</p><p>One of the girls sticks a rag in her mouth to bite; she chews it. She looks tearfully at the midwife, but nods. The crying makes her whole body tremble and she can't breathe, but Lily puts all that aside and allows them to continue.</p><p>"Good," he says; she positions herself between his legs. The other girl has put her hands on her belly. Lily does not know what they will do, but she sees the assent that both give. "Bid," he says, his expression wild.</p><p>Lily pushes, but she feels the pressure of her hands pressing with all her weight on her belly. Let out a scream, the pain is excruciating, too. He wants to shout at them: "You are killing me!", But he cannot because of the rag in his mouth</p><p>And the woman continues, continues to press. Lily convulses still pushing hard until she can't take it anymore. But she cries biting the rag thinking: “It is not enough, it is not enough. Even more, a little more ”, we try to give encouragement.</p><p>The matron yells things at her that she does not understand, she seems more like an animal in battle than a midwife in childbirth.</p><p>Lily insults her; He hates her at the moment as if he were to blame for her suffering. The girl who grabs her arms yells at her with her youthful voice, seems to cheer her up and incite her more.</p><p>Lily makes an ugly sound in her throat and challenges him to follow the midwife. She looks at her with impressive temperance before ordering something and the pain starts again.</p><p>This continues two more times.</p><p>For the third Lily, she is drenched in sweat, saliva spilling from her mouth, hair sticking to her entire face. She doesn't know how fierce she looks at the moment, as strong and powerful as a lioness at the forefront of battle.</p><p>The midwife yells at her, she feels the baby coming out little by little. The time is running out more and more, it is already dawn. The sun shines through the window.</p><p>And Lily screams, screams and pushes leaving her life on it. Offering all his strength so that his son is born and roars with his last breath.</p><p>Her head falls hard on the bed and she is yelled at in a strange dialect, but there is nothing more she can do she thinks crying. It is insufficient.</p><p>Lily passes out before she can hear her newborn baby cry loudly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>Lily wakes up in low murmurs and the ruthless cold that makes her body shudder. He wakes up suddenly and immediately without giving time to think about the pain in his body before he feels rushed; regrets later, of course.</p><p>Look desperate everywhere. The two girls from before are surprised, Lily shows her teeth.</p><p>"Where is he?" He growls at them. Even if her son is dead, she has the right to be able to see him. None of them speak, they are stagnant in their places.</p><p>Lily contracts herself, furious, if magic on fire; beating in sync with his pulse. She will retaliate her pain and sorrow, how sad it is that they were the victims.</p><p>As if you know their intentions, they both start screaming. Narrow his eyes, the aggressive gesture does not go unnoticed and is greeted with more screams.</p><p>"What's going on here?" A woman roars as she enters the room. She is the matron, you loved girls, they come quickly hiding behind her; one of them has even started to cry. He looks annoyed at the witch with hair like fire, but she doesn't pay attention to him, because she is all in the blanket covered bundle in her arms.</p><p>The midwife understands the situation as both girls leave, which they do immediately.</p><p>"You said I would die," Lily's voice quivers, her eyes filling with tears. Her lips tremble and whatever strength she has felt has been lost.</p><p>The midwife approaches. "I never said that, I said that I might not live if I wasn't born soon," he explains. "He's a boy," she reports in a soft voice, sitting down on the side of the bed.</p><p>"A boy," Lily cries, covering her mouth. She hunches in on herself sobbing. A child thinks again and he is alive, he is alive, he remembers himself. She runs her hands over her face, wiping away the tears and opens her arms to receive her son.</p><p>"Give it to me," he asks. The baby is so covered that he cannot see even his face, the midwife shows no complaints before his rude request and hands him over to the small load.</p><p>He is small and all pink. A tiny little thing that fits in both hands, barely heavy. Lily cries again. He has unruly black hair; and she feels needles in her heart because he is alive and is so real as to inherit James' hair. She presses her very light nose with his forehead; at no time does he wake up to all the sound she makes. Such a sleepy and patient boy, Lily thinks with a sob.</p><p>"He was born healthy and he screamed loudly, he didn't scare everyone," says the matron with some amusement.</p><p>Lily does not take her eyes off him, there is adoration and devotion in her gaze. And she looks at her son feeling so much and everything that overflows her heart; there is a feeling that consumes it and does not know how to express it.</p><p>But with all this also come fears and insecurities that he believed he had forgotten and destroyed.</p><p>It is there that Lily cries again, but not out of excitement and glory, but out of grief and rage, all of this tightly held by her insecurity.</p><p>He touches the plump cheek of the little thing with his finger and thinks there is nothing, nothing to give her, she cries. There is no inheritance, lineage or glory of a family that serves as a shield for this child for the future. There are no secrets or weapons that you can use, there is no waiting home for you to come to or a family waiting to meet. There is nothing.</p><p>Lily moans crying louder. "Sorry Sorry. Forgive me, forgive me, please. Forgive me. ”, He pleads with the little boy just hours old. The child has not been awake for a day, but he sleeps as if he had always been.</p><p>He only has one mother, Lily thinks, a simple woman to protect him. She snuggles her little fist into her hand; He has no last name to protect him from teasing at school or huge rooms full of information that he uses to excel. There is nothing and Lily hates herself, hates herself more than her life has ever done.</p><p>"To what world have I brought you, to what world? Forgive me, ”he pleads, again.</p><p>He presses his face against the sheets drowning in his tears. The matron looks furious at the scene.</p><p>"What are you apologizing for?", She asks furiously. Lily lets out an empty laugh, her face soaked with tears.</p><p>"You couldn't understand it," he says, shaking his head. Grief holding her like a mother.</p><p>"No, I can't," she says getting up, she's upset. "I can't understand why you cry asking for forgiveness, no, I don't understand you"</p><p>Lily glares at her, anger and grief exploding. “Look at me!” He yells at her, “This is the only thing he has. I am the only thing left to him, he has no surname or inheritance, no home or connections to protect him. He only has a Muggle-born mother who was cheated on by his wife and is criticized by a damn society left in the past ”, he lowers his head looking at his hands. Her vision is overshadowed by all tears.</p><p>"I'm the only thing he has and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for what he touched you," he says to the baby, his shoulders shaking. Lily looks at her little son, the sleeping pink thing weighing only four kilos. Too tiny, too fragile for the outside world. How could she protect him? How would you teach him to protect himself? Should her son suffer all that she had to live through?</p><p>The matron looks at her, dispassionate from all the crying. See the baby strongly protected by his mother. He sees this woman from the farthest places that had come to his home and had endured twelve hours of labor; screaming and howling like the fiercest cats. That he had roared in her face because her son survived and had given the last of her because he was born.</p><p>She sees this woman, strong and furious who had shown more courage than any of her bravest warriors. She sees, she really sees this mother scared and vulnerable by what could happen to her son and understands her, because she is also a mother and has felt that.</p><p>She lifts the witch's chin with fiery hair and says: "Perhaps you are not enough as you have said, not strong enough, not with tools to give her when she grows up," he pauses, looking at her with great intensity, "but if you can raise him to be someone strong and courageous like a tree that is born from a seed. If you water it, take care of it and nurture it, ”she caresses one of the baby's cheeks,“ then when you least realize it, it will be robust enough to withstand any blow. ”</p><p>The matron turns away from the bed, “If you give him love and shelter, if you teach him to love himself more than he should love someone else. Believe me, it will be the strongest you will meet ”, Lily looks at him surprised and then nods, there are tears rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>She smiles, “but all that remains with you, <em>achichin nina</em> , and you have an impressive job ahead of you; And if I were that child, "she says," I would be more than grateful for having been touched by a mother like you. " Lily opens her eyes wide and for the first time since it all started, she smiles.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>

Harry.</p><p>Harry, expected son of Lily and James, both close friends of him.</p><p>He sees this small, slender woman with an iron column sitting comfortably in a small room.</p><p> No, sorry, sitting in your living room.</p><p>Remus blinks with a muted surprise staring at her. Lily smiles at him, comfortable as a cat in the sun; satisfied to have it in your home.</p><p>He also realizes that he can no longer stop linking Lily to the term lady and not because she is married or something similar, but because she is the <em>lady</em> of his house, the support of his home and the mother of a small child, And he faces it with an enviable impetus and spirit that Remus admires and envies in equal parts.</p><p>She is seen with a certainty that she has never noticed and radiant not in the casual way that one would say how charming she is for her beauty. But radiant as if he were climbing mountains every night and strong enough to wake up early the next morning. That type of shine that is not common and you will never notice, because you will not associate with that word.</p><p>He is a shine that you find in burned silver after polishing it so much, nothing majestic, but admirable for all the effort that is made to find it.</p><p>Remus smiles, something soft and gentle.</p><p>Smell the smells of a stew in the kitchen, the breeze brings the smell of grass from a backyard and if you focus a little more you can smell a very light, curled, but hardly noticeable smell. The one that smells like milk and indescribable things, soft blankets and lullabies; forced mornings and tired smiles.</p><p>He smells his <em>puppy</em> on her.</p><p>The letter Lily sends him takes him so by surprise that he feels no shame in saying that he dropped it the first time he held it in his hands in excitement. Nearly a year after his disappearance and no sign of life, he had left Remus chewing on his nails every night, scared of what might happen to him. James' desperation to find her only served to further distress him.</p><p>How many nights had he been awake in his little room drinking a cup of hot chocolate thinking, searching his mind where Lily might have gone? What was the destination you chose? Would it be alright, the puppy too?</p><p>Nothing had helped them find his whereabouts. Not James' desperate attempts to track her down or Sirius's underhand handling.</p><p>Disappeared, many said in a mocking voice when the news spread. Kidnapped was the rumor that others took to play. Escaping was something that filled most conservative people with fury. How brazen would women with their noses held high, boasting robes lined with some animal skin, go off with Lord Potter's son, how dare <em>that</em> , they would hiss as a personal offense</p><p>How do you dare? Remus would also wonder many times; Staring at them, secretly listening to them down Diagon Alley. He sees them curled up like a group of cobras fighting over food and he reasons that none of them has ever encountered Lily, fierce and rascal with steel skin, they have never seen her in her fury and discontent, she thinks with cunning eyes observing the interactions with acted grace by the group of witches.</p><p>Like even Cordelia Lewis, “ <em>Call me, Cordelia, please, I know you're a great friend to James,”</em> with her sharp eyes and overly provocative smile, who had only met her a handful of times, had enough information that her body tensed at the sound of his name. It was obvious why.</p><p>The threat that Evans symbolized.</p><p> Which was not a surprise in itself; not when, even, Narcissa Black, now, Malfoy, had looked over her shoulder at Lily in the school years, not only with contempt and condescension like the others, but also with accumulated anger and frustration. A dirty blood, in the crudest way, was more than her, stronger, smarter, more charming. A girl with no previous inheritance or prestige, being better than many heirs, how much more severe blow had she represented in the thoroughbred society, that little bump that they could never eliminate.</p><p> The envy that Lily could believe in people was not new.</p><p>But wasn't that what had most attracted James and Cordelia's greatest weakness?</p><p>That indescribable force that Lily demonstrated and destroyed all the previously drawn graphics that they represented in life. That fury and fierce intelligence that shut the mouth of many.</p><p>Remus denied, laughing privately at the paranoia of life from all of this. He looks at Lily amused, an unspoken affection softens his features into something more moving, and thinks it's really paradoxical to have given that power to someone who has everything else against him.</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>"And what do you plan to do now?" Remus asks, focusing on not cutting himself when cutting the tomatoes.</p><p>The two have spent the whole morning talking about what happened in the month. He becomes the first to hear the version of events on his part and to listen to all the places he has gone to, as well as the only one to know little Harry, who now sleeps peacefully in his room.</p><p>Lily, further away from him, is washing a handful of lettuces. "I don't know for sure," he replies.</p><p>He makes a thoughtful noise, setting aside the vegetables. He wipes his hands with a cloth he finds nearby and turns to look at her.</p><p>"Aren't you going to talk to James? You know this secrecy will not last long." Lily stops for a moment and glances at him.</p><p>"I suppose so, but I will wait to see how much time is allowed. Sure, unless you decide to tell him, ”she faces, smiling. Remus raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"I am neutral, Lily. Neither one nor the other, if this were with other people, of course I would choose. But now ?, frankly, I prefer not to be in the middle of the problem, ”he explains, leaning on one of the kitchen countertops.</p><p>"Sirius wouldn't be thrilled with that answer," she hums quietly. Remus's body tenses.</p><p>"Probably not," he answers honestly; watch as she stops cleaning more vegetables to watch him. "Perhaps with many things of mine if I told you, however, that will never be known, right? Also, I won't leave you in this situation alone. ”</p><p>Lily's face hardens for a moment, but the expression disappears and is replaced by a smile with a sweetness that would melt anyone's teeth.</p><p>"I don't need anyone's protection, Remus," he declares. She sees him behind heavy eyelids and thick lashes, "or, in the worst case, someone's grief."</p><p>The werewolf looks at her curiously, "Do you think I do this out of pity?"</p><p>“No, really, no, but I do believe in that will that you have to protect what you think is vulnerable. You know, like Peter once was, ”he mutters quietly, returning to his duties.</p><p>Remus hums an old song from his childhood. "That is a very separate case, you can hardly compare the situations," he says.</p><p>Lily looks at him for a very long moment, he pretends not to feel her burning gaze. When the minutes pass and she does not stop, she decides to speak before showing her discomfort.</p><p>"Do I have something on my face?" He asks playfully. See how the red-haired witch seems lost in her torpor; she approaches until she is face to face with him.</p><p>Evans looks at him and there are vulnerability and deep feelings that are hard to tell; she salivates loudly and then smiles. A shaky and kind little thing.</p><p>"I missed you," he confesses in a whisper, a raw and tender truth.</p><p> Remus opens his eyes, surprised; his posture relaxes at those words. He takes their hands with affection and protection.</p><p>"I also missed you a lot, I was very worried about you all these months", there is no reprimand or scolding in his voice. Seldom is there with her, she is so smart that sometimes one tries to do it and ends up being scolded. Furthermore, in some way he understands the reason for his decisions.</p><p>"Okay, Lily, wanting to have someone to listen and support you," she notes as her eyelashes flutter; it is the only symbol of fragility that he shows before his words. Remus smiles at him. "Everything will be fine".</p><p>Of course, she doesn't believe that last; neither did he.</p><p>Lily scoffs with some elegance; his composure seems to have returned. She looks at him with that feline intelligence she knows so well from her school years. Sometimes she is surprised how well she knows her friend's expressions.</p><p>"You know," he says to get her attention. "I was thinking that since I don't have any close friends, it would be best if Harry had two godparents"</p><p>Remus stands still, stunned by what Lily is revealing.</p><p>"You mean ...", he sees her with bright eyes. She snorts, she is abrupt.</p><p>"Of course I am, who else do you think I would choose?" He teases, despite the fact that his eyes are soft and his magic cozy.</p><p>He still looks at her in surprise, but accepts with the utmost seriousness the responsibility that has been assigned to him.</p><p>Maybe if he's very selfish, he thinks, having this kind of friendship with Lily that only James seems to have with Sirius. Wanting to know that undisputed support and loyalty.</p><p>He may be the biggest traitor in the group by giving Lily a higher priority than the others, but could they blame him? Could James when he would do the same?</p><p>Remus thinks so, because he knows them too well and if they will find out about this forbidden friendship with secret voices, it is likely that little by little they took him away.</p><p>And that is why he is selfish, because he does not want to lose one or the other and therefore he prefers to remain silent and not defend any..</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div class="afterword preface group">
<p></p><div class="series module"><h3 class="heading">Some contextualization things:</h3><h3 class="heading">
<br/>
First off, this is a TMR / HP story, however their relationship will not deepen until much later.<br/>
I am not respecting any timeline, just, maybe, that of the Black family tree, which will be better understood later. As well as most of the marauders' line, but personally, I'm modifying everything in my favor.</h3><h3 class="heading">Second, the present context of the wizarding world is situated in one where Voldemort does not exist, but a young Tom Riddle who will assist with Harry in his school years.</h3><h3 class="heading">Remember, this is important, since Grindelwall is still alive, Dumbledore has not yet become the great Sorcerer, nor does he have all the prizes and privileges that he obtained as he was in the canon, an example of this is the Order of Merlin. Where do I want to go with this? Well, all this is summed up in that magical Britain will not become a mostly "light" country as we have seen; since, not having a great prominent figure as Dumbledore was, this would remain at best in a neutral political aspect.</h3><h3 class="heading">I will try to explain in more detail as the story progresses.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the story is completely different from the canon, but I will try to make certain things remain the same as the personalities of the original characters. Ancient plot and ideals that each side fought for as is the Order of the Phoenix and the dark families.</h3><h3 class="heading">I also apologize in advance if the story seems too long or for the misspellings, but I want to expand on various situations so that they understand the image that each character has of another, as well as little by little they can understand each one independently.</h3><h3 class="heading">I know there will be a lot of characters that will take them by surprise, but I want to use as a wild card the fact that they are not described as much in the books.</h3><h3 class="heading">The story will be divided into parts, there will be a total of five. The synopsis that is public is the general of the story, but in the following is the synopsis of the first part.</h3><p>By the way, English is not my original language so I regret the many faults that will be. I honestly don't know what I'm doing LOL</p></div></div>
