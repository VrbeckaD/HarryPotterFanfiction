    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Death came suddenly to Harriet Jane Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was sitting at her desk well after everyone else in the auror department had gone home, flipping through the latest case files when a black cloaked figure materialized behind her. Empty eye sockets bore into her back as she occasionally scratched notes in her files. A skeletal hand reached out from under the dark cloth and lightly tapped her shoulder. "Master." A deep voice sounded as the skeleton dropped to its knees, right hand over where its heart would have been. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Bloody hell!" The files in her hands flew as she jumped back a few paces. "Bullocks!" She cursed, looking at her once meticulously organized desk. "Dammit Zane, we've talked about this. It's creepy when you show up behind me like that." Her frown deepened as she crossed her arms, trying to regain some semblance of composure. "Least you could do is cough a little or something." She muttered bitterly as she glanced at the mess on the floor again. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"My apologies." The figure pushed back it's hood to reveal a young man in his early thirties, concern etched across his features. "Master, someone is challenging the hold your hallows have over me. It is my understanding he wishes to begin the apocalypse." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet's eyes widened with shock. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Master, he is attempting to summon me now. He is quite powerful. What would you have me do?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Can't the world just stay safe for once?" She huffed, shock replaced with annoyance. After the Wizarding War, Harriet was not idle. There were several nut jobs who thought they had what it took to be the next Dark Lord. Quite frankly it was more of a nuisance than anything else, the paper work alone was enough to fill libraries even Hermione would be astonished at. "Alright, go to him. I want to know what he's up to." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Zane looked at her doubtfully, "Is that... an order, Harry?" He narrowed his eyes, barely avoiding asking 'is that wise?' Sensing his reluctance to follow through, she straightened her back and put her hands on her hips in a sorry attempt at looking intimidating. Even crouched before her, it was still clear how tiny she was next to Zane. Harriet had a seekers body after all, small and built for speed. "Yes Thanatos. Leave immediately." Her voice dripping with authority and impatience. Zane lowered his eyes. He had forgotten his place and dared to question his master's judgement. With a tight nod Zane replaced his hood, becoming Thanatos once again as magic cloaked his face to show only a skull. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It had been unnerving at first, not only to realize she was the literal Master of Death, but that Thanatos looked so much like a Deatheater. She had wondered on more than one occasion if Voldemort had every met him personally.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet's body disappeared, leaving only her head floating as she threw on her dad's old cloak. "Don't be scared, I'm coming with you." Harriet winked, a mischievous smile planted firmly on her lips. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thanatos coughed, attempting to hid his smile before realizing it wasn't necessary while showing his dreadful skull. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ready?" She asked, green eyes twinkling with a spark of excitement. Maybe this time she would face a real challenge. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thanatos' slight nod was all she needed. Mortis was already waiting for them in the corridor. Thanatos held out his hand and helped Harriet on to the back of his magnificent pale steed before she put up the hood and become completely invisible. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They appeared shrouded in darkness at a small farm just outside an even smaller American town. Regardless of the remote location, it was far from empty. A pit had been dug out, filled with the bodies of the women and children of the town. Surrounding the mass grave stood every surviving member, "Judging by the stench, I reckon they've all been possessed." Harriet whispered to her companion. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Demons." Thanatos grunted. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What will happen to their souls?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thanatos' silence was answer enough. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">White hot rage blinded her for a moment. '</span> <span class="s2">There're </span> <span class="s1">hundreds</span> <span class="s2">of innocent people being sacrificed by some lunatic for a ritual that won't even work.</span> <span class="s1">' Harriet thought, erasing a key point in the pentagon. She bared her teeth, hissing a few choice curses in parseltongue. </span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eyes filled with venom searched the crowd to find the man responsible. It was easy. The blonde man was standing in front of the assembled demons, his back to the pair. He wouldn't be alone for long however. Two young men were making their way towards the blonde, they seemed to be the only humans for miles. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Muggles." Harriet snorted when she realized the one sneaking up behind the blonde was armed with a gun. She pointed out the useless piece of metal to Thanatos. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"They don't stand a chance." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet was unsurprised when the man stood up after being shot in the head at point blank range. There was no way someone powerful enough to get her attention would be killed that easily. She was unimpressed yet again by the show of force when he flung the man with the gun across the field, knocking him out. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After some back and forth with the remaining muggle, he turned to the crowd and asked them to repeat after him. Thanatos urged his steed forward, but Harry stopped him. "Not yet. I want him to believe the ritual succeeded. It's the only way we'll truly find out what he wants." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"We offer up our lives, blood, souls, to complete this tribute." The chant could be heard from each demon before they died. It was eerie watching the demons sacrifice themselves without hesitation. Her mind was working overtime trying to figure out what kind of a being would be able to command demons to willingly kill themselves. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Realizing this was probably the part when the ritual was supposed to be completed Harry figured a bit of flashy magic was in order. She flicked her wand from under the invisibility cloak and the earth began to rumble. Zane rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath, "An earthquake? Really? Could you be more dramatic?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Your turn." She chuckled darkly. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of the corner of her eye, Harriet watched as a third man apparated the two muggles away from the farm. '</span> <span class="s2">A wizard is involved? This is definitely my jurisdiction.'</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thanatos made his presence known as he approached the lunatic.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hellllo Death." The man smiled. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was something off about him. She could feel the power radiating from him. He clearly wasn't human and didn't have the stench of a demon. There were not many creatures with that kind of power. She couldn't put her finger on it. Something unpleasant tingled up her spine when a memory of facing Voldemort washed over her. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She hopped off Mortis's side and crouched into an offensive stance. Once her wand began moving it didn't stop until the meaningless exchange between Thanatos and the blond man was over. She cast a wide array of detection charms and a few curses trying to figure out just what the bloody hell this man was. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">'</span> <span class="s2">Bollocks.'</span> <span class="s1">Whatever he was, Harriet had never encountered or even read about before. </span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man vanished with a rustling noise. Too quiet for apparition. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The field was silent for a moment. Thanatos' dreadful skull seemed to frown. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I hope you got the information you were looking for." Zane huffed, pulling his hood back to once again reveal the young man behind the enchantment. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Mmhmm." She made a distracted sort of noise, trying to sort through the last 20 minutes for any clues. "Fascinating." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'm glad you find the destruction of our world 'fascinating'." Zane rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, he's fascinating. Demons respect him, but he is not one of them. Human muggles want him dead, a wizard is helping them. He has enough power to summon you. I haven't the foggiest what he is." Harriet thought out loud. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Zane snorted. "You weren't listening, were you?" </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet suddenly found her fingernails very interesting. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"He introduced himself." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet blushed, refusing to make eye contact. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Lucifer. The devil wants to end the world." </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harriet burst out laughing. "No way! The devil doesn't exist!" She said between giggles. “People are plenty evil enough on their own.” Her smile faded, it was time to </span> <span class="s2">work</span> <span class="s1">. “Here’s what we’ll do. I’ll find the muggles to find out what they know, and you can go back to work. You’ve been here too long and your part is over with anyways.” At the first signs of protest from Zane, Harriet shot him a withering look. “Don’t argue, just go. You’ve got more important things to worry about. I’ll send a patronus if I need you.” </span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes master.” He bowed. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh don’t give me that look. Besides, the last place I want you is anywhere near that lunatic when he figures out the ritual didn’t work. I have a feeling he won’t take too kindly.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Zane flipped the hood back up and mounted his pale steed. With one last nod, he left to go work on the backlog of souls that had built up in his absence. After all, souls wouldn’t guide themselves to the afterlife. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harriet gave one last disgusted look to the mass grave, feeling the familiar curl of rage build in her belly. Whomever that man truly was, he certainly would not be getting off easy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One tracking spell and a short apparition later found Harriet in what appeared to be a vehicle graveyard. Sure, the sign said it was a garage but nothing seemed to be in working order. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harriet gripped the invisibility cloak tightly around her shoulders as she observed her marks through dirty windows. Experience and instinct wouldn’t allow her to trust her eyes alone. “</span> <span class="s2">Humano revelio.”</span> <span class="s1">She murmured. </span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Satisfied with only the presence of three humans in the rundown old house, she drew in closer to study them. Walking into trouble blind may have been her usual approach as a teenager, but older and wiser she knew dearly the value of intel. It appeared the wizard left the muggles there with a wheelchair bound muggle at least twice the other two’s age. She pushed herself into a standing position and removed her cloak. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The house was quite as she advanced, but erupted in brief chaos when she knocked. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Pass me that shotgun boy!” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Get the salt, Sammy.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She stood patiently on the stoop as the men on the other side of the door prepared to fight for their lives. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The door creaked opened and she unleashed her most startling, star studded smile normally reserved for the press. “Evening gentlemen, I believe you may be of some assistance.” </span>
