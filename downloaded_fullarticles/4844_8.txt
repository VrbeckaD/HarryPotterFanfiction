  <strong>PRELUDE</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">Her fingers are restless with anxiety, knuckles bleached white by the force of her grip. Rounded nails bite into her husband’s wrist as she uses him as an anchor to the present world, despite the looming despair and acidic taste of truth. The words only minutes before spoken swing like a gallows noose, waiting to be wrapped around the necks of Lily Potter and her family. Her slender fingers brush over her protruding abdomen, lips trembling with a turmoil of emotions she could barely subdue. “Could you,” she begins to say, voice small and tight, “could you repeat that again?”</p><p align="justify">Desperately, she wishes to have misheard. <em>Please</em>, she thinks as her eyes pinch shut and a lone tear spills forward, descending her cheek. <em>Please, let it be wrong. Please. </em>Her pleas go unanswered, her prayers discarded. Her husband’s hand is a boulder on her shoulders, crushing away the denial because Lily knew she had not heard wrong. “I have reason to believe that Voldemort will attack your children .”</p><p align="justify">“No,” she whispers just as her husband, James Potter, asked, “Why?”</p><p align="justify">Albus Dumbledore does not speak for too long, and it would be the first time that Lily and James would ever see him appear so aged, so fatigued. The elderly wizard examines them from the top of half-moon spectacles, brilliant blues irises dimmed of merriment and sparkle. “For reasons, I cannot disclose,” he says gravely, a thick underlying of regret and anguish. “I can only trust that you will take my words to heart, and advise that you and your children go into hiding for the time being.”</p><p align="justify">“Albus, please,” Lily said, moisture rimming the whites of her eyes. “Please, you have to tell me why-why my children? What could they possibly ever do to Voldemort that would warrant their death?”</p><p align="justify">“That, I cannot say for sure,” Dumbledore admits in a quiet voice, weathered hands clasping together as he levels the couple with a heavy look of forlorn. “They are but children – not yet even born, and already burdened with a fate no child should have . . . “</p><p align="justify">Lily falls silent, unable to speak as her words are replaced with barely smothered sobs of depression. James keeps his hold on her shoulder, providing what comfort he could in his own time of troubles. He simply could not wrap his mind around the notion that his children, his unborn sons, could ever be conceived as threat necessary of eliminating. Grounding his teeth together in anger, he heaves great breath and nods slowly, painfully. “We’ll do it. We’ll go into hiding.”</p><p align="justify">“At your earliest convenience, I will perform the Fidelius Charm. You only need to find yourself a Secret Keeper,” informed Dumbledore. “For now, I suggest you both go home.”</p><p align="justify"><em>And spend what time you still have, together, </em>remains unsaid, but clear. James nods stiffly once more, assisting Lily back onto her feet. He murmurs a farewell to the Headmaster of Hogwarts before they both grab a handful of Floo powder and step through the emerald flames. Left to his own accord, Albus Dumbledore allows his body to slouch over with age and a world of problems. Lord Voldemort was at the height of power, and cause reigns supreme. No longer was there blind innocence or safety – every night civilians (Muggleborn, Muggles, and Halfbloods) are snatched from their beds only to return dead and mutilated come morning. No one dared to leave their homes or enter Diagon Alley in fear of the Death Eaters who patrol the cobbled streets in search of prey. A coup d'état was no longer an option, and Albus truly feared that Voldemort would achieve the unthinkable. Absolute power.</p><p align="justify">The only silver lining to this cloud of oppression that clutched the magical community of Britain was a prophecy. Courtesy of Sybil Trelawney, Dumbledore recalls with astounding clarity the night he had heard those words:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">To think when he’d invited her to discuss her termination as Hogwarts Divination professor, he would also hear the very words that would determine the fate of their world. Like he’d informed the Potter’s of the impending danger, Dumbledore had also spoken to Alice and Frank Longbottom about the impending dangers their own child faced. Each has defied Voldemort, openly, thrice and each were expecting sons. In the months to come a child will be herald the hope of the wizarding world – the light in these dark times. Yet, Dumbledore stills worries for while this news lifted some burden from his heart, he was not the only one to be graced with the words of the fate that night.</p><p align="justify">For now, he can only wait to see the outcomes of individual decisions before making any plans of his own.</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In the months to come, Lily and James would have already settled themselves into a routine as new parents. At four months old, their eldest, Fleamont, already showed himself to be a high maintenance child. He would cry at any offense, be it not being feed in time or wearing a soiled nappy for a minute too long. He loathed being bathed and would cry himself red in the face and beat at anything his little, balled fist could reach. Their youngest, Harry, was not partial to crying three-quarters of the day. If anything, he slept a bit more than Lily would have liked, and only cried when hunger struck or he couldn’t sleep. In all, parenthood had proven itself to be a full-time position for the twenty-year-old couple.</p><p align="justify">They managed, however, and as their children grew and the seasons came and went, Lily and James begun to feel a bit more at ease. In the backs of their minds, there still remained a nagging presence of worry and anxious anticipation that at any moment, they would be attacked and their world would dissolve into ash. Dumbledore’s words are a shadow in their lives, but still, they live on.</p><p align="justify">Currently, they are in the midst of a small birthday celebration with their friends. It was being hosted in the renovated garden of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and as Lily watched James entertained their boys with sparks of magic from his wand, a surge of bitterness blossoms in her chest. Voldemort, if he would have things go his way, would take this all from her. Her husband, her life, her children – everything. Taking a drink of her Butterbeer, Lily is jolted from her thoughts by a heavy-handed pat on the shoulder. She turns to face the grinning, handsome face of Sirius Black and offers him a smile in turn.</p><p align="justify">“Sirius, enjoying the party, I hope,” she says, returning to her focus to her family.</p><p align="justify">“Course I am,” he responds, “your little buggers are a year old and this is about as happiest as I’ve been in ages.”</p><p align="justify">“We haven’t had much to be happy about before,” Lily mutters lowly, taking another swing of her drink before shaking her head. “Anyhow, Sirius – there’s been something James and I have been meaning to talk to you about. Can we speak somewhere private?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius nods and escorts her back into the parlor. Casting a silencing charm behind him, Sirius waits for Lily to speak. The vermillion-haired woman doesn’t say a word for some time, her focus on the snoozing portrait of Orion Black II before she releases a heavy sigh and turns to face the Black Lord. “James and I think it would be best if we change Secret Keeper’s.”</p><p align="justify">“Lily – “ Sirius started to say, startled by the announcement.</p><p align="justify">“It isn’t because we don’t trust you, Sirius,” Lily interjected quickly, “we do. We trust you with not only our lives but the lives of our children.”</p><p align="justify">“Why, then?”</p><p align="justify">“Because Voldemort knows. He knows and he’s coming after us – he’s already orphaned Neville Longbottom – and the boy himself had barely survived Bellatrix’s attack. We’re next, and he’ll be coming after you because you are the logical option, Sirius. He knows that we would trust you with our location.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius, lips thin in thought, threads his fingers through his hair. He’d been aware of the dangers that came with being their (the Potter’s) Secret Keeper from the moment he’d agreed to it. He had been ready to die. “Lily, I know – I know and I’m ready. I’m willing.”</p><p align="justify">“But we aren’t,” Lily countered. “We won’t allow you to die if there is an alternative option.”</p><p align="justify">“And who would that be?”</p><p align="justify">“Peter Pettigrew.”</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>“No one would ever suspect you.” </em>
</p><p align="justify">Peter Pettigrew is an unassuming man. His mousy disposition and rodent appearance aside, he did not have the bravery or charm that his group of friends embodied. He was short and plain, hair receding and teeth large and crooked. So it had both hurt him and surprised him when James and Sirius had invited him over for a pint of drink. When they had requested that he be the new Secret Keeper for James and his family, Peter had been giddy – happy that finally, his friends were seeing him as a valuable member of their group. As someone, they could trust.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“No one would ever suspect you.” </em>
</p><p align="justify">Peter knew what phrase meant, the implications behind it. No one would suspect weak, talentless Peter Pettigrew of being the keeper of such an important duty. No, no one would ever even consider him as a possibility. So he had agreed, begrudgingly, and for the days to come, Peter would also contemplate what to do with such vital information. Just as no one would ever believe that the Potter’s would appoint them their Secret Keeper, they would also never dare to believe that Peter would be a Death Eater. But such information if given to the wrong hands, would be the end of the only friends he’d ever known. James never treated him as badly as Sirius had, and Lily – Lily had always been kind to him. And those children, they were innocent. . . could he really do such a thing to them?</p><p align="justify">He was at a standstill. Between his duty to his lord, and his loyalty to their cause, could he truly sacrifice the lives of innocent children for his own sake?</p><p align="justify">At the burning of his mark, Peter shakes away the thought and prepares himself for the meeting. It occurred every fortnight, and during those few hours, information pertaining to the movement, whether they be successes or failures, are exchanged. Peter shudders in pity for anyone foolish enough to present his lord with the ill-favored news.</p><p align="justify">Despite his attempts to fortitude his mind and keep his focus on what was ahead, Peter found his thoughts retreating to the Potter’s and his own status as their Secret Keeper. Upon his arrival to the stronghold of Lord Voldemort, Peter situates himself to the very end of the long table, slouched over in his chair and watching through hooded eyes as the meeting commenced. Bellatrix was the first to begin, preening like a peacock when their lord praised her for her achievements. Peter didn’t think it was so grand, she only killed a few Muggles, took out the Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic – nothing worth such high words.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, Wormtail, any news to share?” came the low, hissing voice of his lord and Wormtail jerked his head up in terror. Serpentine orbs fix onto his colorless face, thin lips stretched into a smile that brought shivers down Peter’s back.</p><p align="justify">“My – my lord,” stuttered Peter as he rose on shaken legs. “My lord – I have – I have. . . “He trails off to swallow the lump in his throat, stubby fingers twisting the fabric of his worn robes. Lily and the kids – Lily and the kids. . . .</p><p align="justify">“Go on, Wormtail, we haven’t all night to waste,” said Voldemort, voice soft, patronizing.</p><p align="justify">It reminded Peter of Sirius.</p><p align="justify">“My lord I know where the Potter’s are hiding!”</p><p align="justify">A hushed silence and more than a dozen pairs of eyes snapping onto Peter. The most notable are black and pitless, obsidian and simmering with wrath. Voldemort leans forward in his throne-like chair, long, spidery fingers caressing the head of the large serpent splayed across his chest. “And how did you come upon such information?”</p><p align="justify">“They made me their Secret Keeper, my lord,” Peter revealed in one breath. “They knew that you would come for Black and decided that I would be better because – because no one would assume they would choose me.”</p><p align="justify">“Fortunate does not favor the foolish,” his lord murmurs to himself before his eyes harden and minuscule smile melts away. “Their location, Wormtail.”</p><p align="justify">“My lord,” Peter begins to say, burying at the swell of guilt in his heart. “The Potter’s can be found in Godric’s Hollow.”</p><p align="justify">“You have done well, Wormtail. It would seem even spineless rodents have their uses,” says Voldemort and Peter flushes when a chorus of snickers fill the cavernous room. “You shall be rewarded, of course.”</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, my lord,” Peter whispers as he sits back down, heart in his stomach.</p><p align="justify">He had a made a terrible mistake.</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was nothing to suggest that on that Hallows Eve night of nineteen eighty-one that lives two children would forever be altered. He appeared like a wraith, death itself on the streets of Godric’s Hollow. The night was cold and windy, moist from the rain hours before. The street have emptied of Muggle children who had been out-and-about celebrating Halloween in costumes and bags filled to the brim with candy. A disquieting silence would follow where he treads, a darkness so profound that the night sky is consumed by the velvet entity. Stars flicker out of sight and street lambs fade into nothingness as he passes. He fingered the handle of his wand, a thrum of power and purpose exuding from him as he glided up the street, destination only feet away</p><p align="justify">As he neared, he felt the wards surrounding the small cottage flicker and waver, cracking beneath the proximity of his power. He drew his wand from beneath his cloak, giving only the barest of movement to remove the Fidelius Charm that had been placed over the home. Through the living room window, he could see James Potter entertaining his children with conjured bubbles, and only seconds later would Lily Potter step into the room with two steaming cups. The small gate made not a sound when he pushes it open, and with a flick of the wrist, the door to the home is blown off its hinges. James Potter came rushing out, wand in hand and crying out, “Lily! It’s him! Take the boys and run!”</p><p align="justify">Had his focus been not on warning his wife – who foolishly darted up the stairs – perhaps he would have had the chance to properly protect himself. But, alas, Fate was a cruel Mistress. With an insouciant wave of his wand, Voldemort watches as James was flung backward. The man collides against the wall in a thundering blow, skull knocking against the kitchen doorframe before he slumps over on the floor, blood protruding from his head wound and mouth. Pathetic, really.</p><p align="justify">He is no rush when he makes his way upstairs. The foolish girl had left her wand in the living room, her fear palpable. She would not run – no, she would try to bargain away her own life for the lives of her children. Voldemort would have taken pleasure in slaughtering her like the filth she was, had he not promised to spare the chit. Lord Voldemort, after all, always kept his promises. He finds Lily in the nursery, standing between him and the children he sought after.</p><p align="justify">“Stand aside, silly girl,” Voldemort says. “You don’t need to die for them.”</p><p align="justify">“Please! Have mercy!”</p><p align="justify">“Stand aside. Now.”</p><p align="justify">Lily Potter stood her ground. “Not my children!” she cried out. “I won’t give them to you! Take me! Take me instead!”</p><p align="justify">His patience with the woman runs its course, and with a snarl, Voldemort hisses out, “<em>Stupefy</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Lily does not dodge the spell in time, and as quickly as her husband has succumbed, she fell to the ground unconscious. With their shield gone, Voldemort steps over the woman and scrutinize the children who were prophesied to be his condemners. Only one would be equal to him in power, only one would truly destroy him. The children were crying, the loudest hazel eyed and black-haired. His teeth grind together. He had always loathed the whining of children in the orphanage. Setting his wand point to the smooth, unblemished forward of the youngest whose watery green eyes stare at him in uncertainty and fear, Voldemort utters the words that would seal their fates.</p><p align="justify">“<em>Avada Kedavra</em>.”</p><p align="justify">The green light bathed the nursery in its sickly embrace, illuminating the cribs and the occupants of the room. His triumph is short-lived for he broke not even seconds later. Torn from flesh and bone, broken so deeply that he knew not what comfort of death was – he only knew of pain for that was all he had become; pain and terror. He screamed in agony, a shriek so horrid that it reacted to his destructive magic, and as he broke further so did his surroundings. Magic most ominous clutched onto the wailing children, and as he flees from the destruction he had created, he leaves with the youngest a portion of his tattered being. It burrows into the boys’ chest, close to his heart and leaves a curiously shaped mark, almost like lightning.</p><p align="justify">The cries of the children eventually became the siren that awoke Lily from her forced slumber. Crawling toward the crib, shaken and disorientated, she breathes a sigh of relief when she sees that they are both alive and well. Back on her feet, she takes them both into her arms, and upon examining them for injuries, found Fleamont bearing an angry scar across the forehead that bleed profusely. Harry looked to be virtually unharmed, so she places him back into the crib to wipe the blood from Fleamont’s face. The scar continues to bleed, leading her to believe that Voldemort had, in fact, attempted to use a dark curse on her son. Wrapping a torn piece of cloth around his forehead to keep the blood from his eyes, Lily picks Harry back up and hurries downstairs to check on her husband.</p><p align="justify">“James!” she cries out when she sees him sprawled out on the floor and bleeding. “Oh my God! James – James are you – “</p><p align="justify">“Lily.”</p><p align="justify">Spinning around, Lily quite nearly broke out in tears at the sight of Albus Dumbledore. The ancient wizard is quick assess the situation, and even swifter in providing a comforting hand on the shoulder. “Albus,” the red-haired woman sobbed, “Albus he came for us – he came for us – Peter – Peter told him!”</p><p align="justify">“Peter Pettigrew was your Secret Keeper?’ inquired Dumbledore as he moved to examine James, healing the bleeding cut at the base of his skull and turning him over. James gives a groan but remains unconscious. “I was under the impression that Sirius – “</p><p align="justify">“We switched them,” Lily explained through her tears, “because Voldemort – Voldemort would know he was our first choice. We thought Peter – we thought we could trust him!”</p><p align="justify">“I see,” murmurs Dumbledore as he stands. Lily kneels before her husband, arms trembling under the weight of her children. Dumbledore, upon seeing the makeshift bandage around Fleamont’s forehead, asked, “Is that where –?”</p><p align="justify">Lily nods and kisses away the tears from the eyes of her boy’s. “It won’t stop bleeding. I think Voldemort – I think Voldemort might have left a mark on him.”</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” responded Lily, adamantly.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore, after digesting the provided information, rests his hand on the young mother’s shoulder. “We have much to discuss, Lily. For now, it’ll be best if you and the boy’s head off the Hogwarts. Madam Pomfrey will see to you.”</p><p align="justify">“What about James?”</p><p align="justify">“I will bring him along.”</p><p align="justify">Lily thanks, Dumbledore in a breathless voice before she retreats into the living room. It was only after the sound of Floo operating had reached his ears did Dumbledore grab James Potter by the shoulders and Apparated himself and the unconscious man to Hogwarts. After depositing the man in the infirmary, Dumbledore sits in his office as the family is looked over by Poppy. To think that it would be Fleamont who would be chosen and that the boy himself would carry such a grotesque scar. . . Dumbledore shakes his head. This was not the outcome he had expected but embraced nonetheless.</p><p align="justify">Conjuring himself a goblet from the kitchens, Dumbledore watches as it fills with golden liquid. He holds the silver cup in the air, whispering a quiet, “To Fleamont Potter – the Boy-Who-Lived.”</p><p align="justify"> </p>
