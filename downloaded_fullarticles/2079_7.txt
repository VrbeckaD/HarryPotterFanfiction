    <p>The first step</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...." </em> Harry whispers, clutching his holly wand tightly in his left hand, the Elder wand in his right. " <em> Either must die at the hand of the other..."</em></p>
<p>Who knew<em> that </em>meant Harry could only die at Voldemort's hands? After he became the Master of Death, no matter how hard he chucked away the Resurrection Stone or snapped the Elder wand to avoid the burden, Harry could never evade it. He stopped ageing altogether. He didn't know if it was because he was the Master of Death or because of the prophecy's double meaning.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Death had wanted Harry and no one else to be its' master. Each and every time Harry had tried to get rid of the two Hallows, they both seem to end back into Harry's pockets as if it had always been there.</p>
<p>It had left him completely and utterly frustrated.</p>
<p>As years passed, and Harry watched his friends grow old and grey, hurting him like no crucio or curse could ever. Harry couldn't bear to settle down or start a family, or even watch his friends have families. He watched as his best friends withered and wrinkled into the ghosts of the people he once knew and knew he couldn't do anything to stop it, or even <em> help. </em></p>
<p>For far too long he heard the echoes of their voices ringing at the back of his head.</p>
<p>
  <em> 'It's okay, Harry, you saved the world. I could never ask you of anything more.' He lost Ron and Hermione the next week. </em>
</p>
<p><em> 'I understand, but I'll always love you with all my heart until I die, even though I will probably only be a sliver of a memory.' Ginny was his </em> <b> <em>first love.</em> </b></p>
<p>
  <em> 'It's alright Potter. I can take care of myself.' Even Draco Malfoy's death had hurt. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> "I'll be waiting cub, but don't you dare come even a second before you're supposed to.' Remus had left Harry sobbing for weeks. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> 'Please, Harry. Don't let our deaths hurt too much, the nargles will come back.' Luna had never stopped believing in him even old and grey. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> 'Just know... that I'm sorry, for everything, and that I can't be helped, death is inevitable.' Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini were good people. </em>
</p>
<p>But he <em> wanted </em> to help.</p>
<p>He wanted to help <em> so badly. </em>Guilt ripped through his chest, and tears streamed down his face. He didn't want to be here. He didn't want to be in Britain, or the UK or even the world; he just wanted to be with his friends.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Time heals all wounds. Or so they say.</p>
<p>Several centuries of living in the shadows of the British wizarding community had made Harry only miss his friends even more, and the story of the boy-who-lived had become a legend; the most pigmented story in history even if it had faded behind Harry’s own eyes.</p>
<p>He was a martyr. A golden hero in the midst of the darkest ages of bias and evil. Harry was hailed as one of the most powerful wizards in history and he needed to escape. He didn't want money or fame, he wanted a life where he didn’t have to run.</p>
<p>Harry moved around often, never staying long in a city or a town for them to get familiar with him. His wild black hair, lightning bolt scar and vivid green eyes that resembled the killing curse had left his imprint on several magical towns and whispers flew like leaves in a hurricane. By the nightfall of the fortnight he had stayed in one place, Harry was already getting ready to go.</p>
<p>Harry tried living in muggle towns too, but it was just so <em>unbearable </em> . He couldn't use the simplest of spells and charms because of the <em> bloody muggle technology. </em>Every time he tried to use a simple warming charm or shrinking charms or even a light charm, the finicky light bulbs and telly would blackout, forcing Harry had to repair it. Without magic.</p>
<p>Harry had been working on spells that didn't mess up muggle tech. He had a small repertoire of spells that worked with his holly wand, but it was mostly wandless magic that worked. The Elder wand worked too, but what did Harry expect from the one thing that seems to defy all odds?</p>
<p>The day the world had turned "2000" years old was the day Harry considered moving out of Britain and into the colonies. He never really considered Britain his home, not even after he met Hermione, Ron and all of the Weasleys. Harry wasn't sure if he was just happy enough to stay in the Uk, or just uncontent enough to want to move out. He wasn't sure, bordering the lines and keeping his eyes open for things to keep him occupied.</p>
<p>He wasn’t surprised that the Avengers had caught his eye once they made their debut into the crime fighting world, and he wasn’t surprised when he felt the urge to find out more about them. He had tracked everyone down, reading their reports, their history and all of the enemies. Harry knew every detail of their lives as much as they did.</p>
<p>But he wasn't stalking them okay? At least, that’s what Harry told himself.</p>
<p>He scanned over the pictures he’d seen, already figuring out the dynamics of the group. Stark was a leader but often clashed heads with Rogers, Banner was the brains and the reluctant brawns, and the Romanoff - Barton friendship was a tag team sort of thing. Thor was an anomaly with little to no data on him.</p>
<p>Harry could feel the faint warmth of excitement growing in his soul. It was like someone lit one candle in the midst of thousands, and one by one, all of the candles were set in a monstrous fire. He reached for his bag and started shrinking every piece of clothing he owned, and shoving it in carelessly, along with his other things he wanted to bring along with him.</p>
<p>Casting a final look over the apartment he had stayed in for the past 3 weeks, Harry smiled to himself and put the key flat on the table with a note holding the rent money he owed.</p>
<p>He grabbed his wand holsters, one on his calf, and the other on his wrist, and place the Elder wand in the calf holster. With his holly wand held firmly in his right hand and a wolfish grin spread across his face, Harry apparated into America.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was foolish of them to think a mere cell would hold him for long.</p>
<p>He was the God of Mischief and Deceit after all, not like that <em> brute </em>called the God of Thunder. Loki was not only offended that the Asgardians thought so little of him, but downright pissed that so many had underestimated him.</p>
<p>He walked briskly to the secret passage to Midgard and pulled his green cape on; it flowing dramatically behind him in the wind (because what was the point of having a cape if not for the dramatism?) Loki flipped his knife between his nimble fingers and stood infront of the passage opening. His sharp eyes trailed the rugged stones lining the cave that only seemed to be narrowing and his lips pulled into a smirk. Loki said, “Fools. All of them are fools,” and stepped through the trembling passage.</p>
<p>Loki landed roughly on his knees. His palms scraped into the dark gravel as he steadied his breathing and willed his pounding head to stop. He looked up, trailing along the long legs and the lean torso that followed, all the way up to a chiselled face with green eyes matching his own. The man had a scowl drawn into his face that Loki all but scoffed at.</p>
<p>Standing up, Loki glared back at the man. With disgust and chilly hatred laced into his voice, Loki sneered sarcastically, "Can I help you?"</p>
<p>It was very clear the Loki did not want to help.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On Harry’s first weekend after he came to America, he certainly didn't expect America’s most wanted god to appear in front of his house, stumbling on his hands and knees.</p>
<p>Loki stood up, with more grace than Harry could ever have mustered in all of his years and crisply flicked off all the dirt from his outfit. Once he was done, Loki looked at Harry and talked so sarcastically, it rivalled Ginny, “Can I help you?”</p>
<p>He stood there, eyes the size of saucers and unblinking. His heartbeat stuttered in his chest and heat rose to his pale cheeks. The stunning eyes that lingered over his body for a second too long had the exact shade of killing curse green that he had seen too often in his lifetime.</p>
<p>The same unique shade that had matched his eyes only.</p>
<p>Harry, smiling back with a blinding smile. He had an advantage, knowing all about the god and the god knowing nothing of him.</p>
<p>“No, I’m alright, but the real question is, do you need help?” Harry said, teasingly shooting a smile toward Loki.</p>
<p>Loki’s eyes glared, piercing into his own. He gripped his knife a little tighter from under his cloak. Harry had pushed the buttons he had been meaning to. </p>
<p>“Why should I, a <em> God </em>, take help from a mere mortal?”</p>
<p>Harry scoffed and switched Loki’s knife in his hand with a fistful of grass with a wave of his hand. “Because I'm not a mortal. I thought you would be able to tell a wizard from man.”</p>
<p>Loki hummed, appearing behind Harry as the illusion faded in front of him. The arrogant lilt in Loki's voice made Harry smirk. “Well played, magician, but I thought a wizard should be able to tell an illusion from reality.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but is this not an illusion?”</p>
<p>The background was suddenly flooded with bustling students in crowded hallways, green, yellow, red, and blue emblems shone dimly in the light of torches, paintings singing and chattering animatedly, the brick staircases moving from one side to another and classrooms being filled with little British children in black robes. Loki peered at the image, taking in all the detail before coming to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“Not an illusion, but not reality either, so it must be a memory.” Loki waved a hand that caused ripples in the background and the chatter to fade into silence. “Care to tell me where I am?”</p>
<p>Harry would be lying if he wasn't impressed. In Loki's file, he had been mentioned as nothing more than a menace, a bother, an evil and vile person. All mentions of Loki's rasper wit and intelligence had been written out. And, with Harry's first impression of the god, Harry thought of Loki as nothing other than a wandless Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Only if you tell me how you got through all of my wards,” Harry replied.</p>
<p>It was a pain, setting up them all with nothing but Hermione’s edition of Complex House Ward Security Set-Ups in hand. It would’ve been hard for someone to be able to pass through them without being ejected out. And seeing how Loki had just appeared with no seeming damage that the wards should've ensured was both irritating and impressive. </p>
<p>“Well, it was rather hard. The most difficult challenge I've had in a while, quite fun actually. I assume ancient wards mixed with original spell work?”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged, knowing that it was original spell work, but not his. “A friends.”</p>
<p>“But, I <em> am </em> the God of Mischief and Deceit, and to think wards would just stop me? An ignorant move.” The maniacal tone of his voice shone and his eyes flashed with unmeasured hate. “My foolish brother thought I was <em> petty and weak. </em> Like an insect, just so easy to crush under your boot.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Harry knew he was treading the waters, but his curiosity got the best of him. “Your brother. Who's your brother?”</p>
<p>Loki's head snapped back and his eyes turned to slits. “I don't have a brother. Now tell me where I am, wizard.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed and thought <em> Honestly, whatever. If Loki kills me in my sleep, I’d thank him</em>. He was getting tired of bipolar self-righteous assholes anyways. Harry waved his hands, causing the ripples in the muted background to slowly pull away, like clouds clearing in the sky. “You’re outside my home. Now get in and explain yourself before I hand you over to SHIELD.”</p>
<p>Loki blinked as his eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight. He stood in a busy street, busking with people, but there was a large lot, much larger than the norm for a house in New York. The large house was hidden under dozens of wards and charms that amazed him. Loki admired the many herbs and flowers growing, obviously grown for potion brewing and the house looked much like the houses in the storybooks his mother used to read to him as a child. There was at least a couple hundreds of metres on every side, covered in green grass and plants.</p>
<p>He stepped into the house and was met with the light scent of lilies and oranges. The sunlight shone through all of the windows, leaving the house fully lit. Loki nodded slightly in approval.</p>
<p>The golden glow left Loki's pale skin warm and light bronze, Harry noticed but didn’t dare comment. So, Harry pulled two chairs out and started preparing tea. “Now tell me how you ended up on the outside my house.”</p>
<p>Loki sat down in the chair and ran his long fingers through his long hair. “Well, it rather is a complicated story. It might take a long time if that's alright to you.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded and placed the finished pot of tea on the coaster that sat on the table. “Tea?” - Loki nodded. - “Cream and sugar?” - Loki nodded again and replied, “Just a splash of cream, and two teaspoons of sugar please.”</p>
<p>They sat in silence, drinking their tea.</p>
<p>“You never mentioned your name, magician,” Loki said, holding his cold hands against the warmth of the cup of tea.</p>
<p>“My name is Harry, Harry Potter.” Harry placed his cup back on the table and folded his napkins his lap. “Can you tell me how you got here now?”</p>
<p>Loki sighed. He enjoyed the moments of silence and peace. He enjoyed how the world stood still with Harry. “If I must.”</p>
<p>“I needed a safe place to stay. My mother was always lenient on me so when I was imprisoned, she let me fiddle around with magic, but she limited it of course. So with what I could do, I sent a scanner out to Midgard, searching for the safest place to hide.”</p>
<p>“And that was here?” Harry asked, taking another sip of his tea.</p>
<p>“Yes, and I’m sure that it has to do with all those finicky wards you’ve set up.”</p>
<p>“It better be.”</p>
<p>“Now, continuing, after I sent a scanner and received a location, I broke out. That part was quite hard and kind of bloody so I’ll spare the details, but I left a letter for my mother, thanking her for all she had done for me. It never was much, but she helped. In more ways that she would ever know.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled down into his own cup. “You know, you aren’t quite as bad as you seem. All in all, you seem like you’ve been through some terrible experiences.”</p>
<p>“Well, depends on what you define terrible.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha.”</p>
<p>When the two had finished their tea and made friends with each other, nightfall came. It fell upon them so swiftly and Harry had offered Loki a room to stay in. Loki reminded Harry so much of the sassy, witty Draco Malfoy he had grown up with and couldn’t turn him away without regretting it.</p>
<p>But, when the days passed one by one, life at Harry’s house had gotten oddly domestic. Harry would always be up early, rearranging his stuff into the places he wanted them and making breakfast before calling Loki down. They would converse about anything, potion making, spells, weird and obscure wizarding or Asgardian history and even their age.</p>
<p>“So, you’re like 17 human years right?”</p>
<p>Loki shrugged, biting into his apple again. “I suppose I am, but one thousand seventy years to have lived is still a lot.”</p>
<p>“But the life expectancy for you Asgardians is like,” Harry paused, counting numbers with his fingers, “5000 human years.”</p>
<p>“And are you not old?” Loki scoffed, putting down the core on his plate.</p>
<p>“Technically yes,” Harry grinned, “Legally, unsure.”</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>“Well due to some double-edged game that a massive psychopath played, I technically can’t die. Trust me, I’ve tried.” A wet laugh escaped Harry and caught the other man by surprise.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Loki said, placing his hand on Harry’s knee before giving it a small squeeze. “You don’t have to tell me.”</p>
<p>With a nod, their breakfast continued and days seemed to pass with a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The hours of the days bleed into the days into weeks slowly, and Harry had just been so content learning about Loki that he had forgotten his motive. Harry fell into a schedule, foreign but not unpleasant, with Loki and it had erased the burning pit in his stomach to find something captivating to occupy his time.</p>
<p>On a lazy Sunday evening, music playing from an old cassette tape Harry had brought with him and a book on his lap, Loki walked into the library with a familiar looking file folder and a face flushed with anger.</p>
<p>“Why did you move from Britain?” Loki asked, dropping the folder onto the small coffee table that separated the two. When Harry didn’t answer, Loki spoke again. “Tell me, Harry. I deserve to know if it’s concerning the people who put me in a cell.”</p>
<p>“It was to see the Avengers,” Harry croaked. He picked up the folder and opened it to see his excited scrawl covering the edges of the pages from almost three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Loki felt a small flame of betrayal lighting in the pit of his stomach. He hated how Harry, his friend, only came to America for the people who helped imprison him but he didn’t know why. Why did he feel tears threaten to sting his eyes and the pit of his stomach to drop.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said flatly, looking away. “I see.”</p>
<p>Harry reached out for Loki's hand. “Hey, don't be like that.” He said softly.</p>
<p>They had been more comfortable with physical contact lately but Harry guessed now wasn’t the right time.</p>
<p>Loki pulled away instead of leaning into Harry's touch. The light from the fire glowed on and warmed Loki's skin with a flushed tone. “I’m not doing anything!” He snapped, frustrated. “It's you who wanted to bloody meet the people who helped imprison me!”</p>
<p>“Loki-” Harry was cut off as Loki stood up, and stride to his room, and closed the door halfway and said - “I'm done, Harry. I hate the idea of them. What if they take you because they think you’re a threat because you use magic like me?” - and slammed the door.</p>
<p>Harry sighed and closed his book. <em> What am I going to do? </em> he thought, putting his glasses on top of his book and ruffled his hair. He walked to Loki's room and opened it only to be met with Loki throwing his hand knives at the wall violently. “Loki-” Harry started.</p>
<p>“Good night, Harry.” Loki walked to the wall, and pulled out all of the blades harshly, and started throwing again. He didn't even look at Harry. “I don't want to talk.”</p>
<p>“But you can listen.” Harry placed his hand on Loki's shoulder to stop him. He murmured softly, “I realize that I never told you my past, in all the time we’ve spent together.”</p>
<p>Loki paused and rolled Harry's hand off with a nonchalant shrug. “So talk.”</p>
<p>Harry began, words billowing from his mouth like smoke spilling from a factory, and he told the truth. How he grew up in a cupboard, how he was abused, how magic lit his world up, how people he loved died. He told Loki every truth he knew, about him, and the world he grew up in. He told the lies he was told, the fights he’d been in, all the times he laid down and was ready to die only to turn up alive and kicking. He told his story of pain, love, distrust, and war.</p>
<p>Much alike to Loki’s. Loki couldn’t help but glance at Harry only to be met with a nostalgic smile, and his eyes softened.</p>
<p>“You still shouldn't meet them, Harry,” Loki said softly, softer than he had ever spoken before. “I don’t want them to hurt you like they did to me.”</p>
<p>“I have to,” Harry spoke back softly. They had been closer than they had been before, fingers lingering and breaths being held a little longer around each other.</p>
<p>“But, what if you tell them about us, about <em> me?” </em>Loki's voice broke and Harry placed his hand on his wrist and gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p>
<p>Harry realized that Loki was a lot more damaged than he cared to admit. “I won't. I promise.”</p>
<p>Loki looked at Harry and saw the truth. “Then I’ll trust in you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>Rocky steps up</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry appeared in the middle of the night, at the time of crisis. He apparated in the middle of screaming, of gunshots and chaos. He raised his hand and time fell still, pausing life in a simple hand motion. He studied the Avengers, Thor mid-air with Mjolnir in hand, Tony Stark flying with beams of energy shooting from his palms, Clint Barton stringing an arrow from the roofs, Natasha Romanoff pinning a man by his throat, but Bruce Banner nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>He let his hand fall, causing the world to swing violently back into motion. Harry ignored the chaos and walked past the blaring colours of red, blue, and orange. He sat down, in the middle of battle, and watched them fight. They tried to make him leave “for his safety” because they thought he was normal. That he would die as easily as them.</p>
<p>He sat still. Waiting. For what, he didn’t know but when the wails of police cars fell silent and the fight started to simmer down, Harry walked away.</p>
<p>The next day, Harry was followed. He knew it was Natasha. The old Auror instincts fell back into habit and wanted to be out of sight but he decided to let her trail him, let her see some of his magic.</p>
<p>He didn't know why he was being followed though. Maybe because he apparated in the middle of a battle and came from nowhere? Or maybe because every time a large piece of debris was hurtling his way, his shield always saved him? Harry shook his head and sighed. He had errands to run.</p>
<p>Harry needed to buy groceries for Loki and him, he needed to buy new books (because the library Harry had was read through dozens of times) and he needed new soil for his garden. He went on with his chores but only after casting a supersensory charm on him. Harry reached the supermarket and heard Natasha whispering into her earpiece - “He’s not doing anything, just shopping. I don't see how me trailing him will help SHIELD.”</p>
<p>He heard Fury’s voice, undisguised and clear snap back - “He appeared in the middle of a battle zone, Natasha! Who does that? And he walked away <em> unharmed </em> after at least an hour of fighting. We need to find out his motive and his powers before it gets out of hand. So <em> keep following him </em> and report back. <em> Do you understand, Natasha?” </em></p>
<p>“Yes sir, I understand sir.” She replied and kept walking, albeit obviously not wanting to.</p>
<p>Harry picked up an apple and tossed it back and forth between his hands. Loki was a fruit eater and Harry didn't know if it suited him perfectly or not. Too bad Loki was too much of a picky eater to appreciate real food and not just eggs in four hundred different ways and green apples.</p>
<p>Natasha peered into his basket from the row beside Harry. She sighed and shook her head slightly. What was a peculiar person like Harry doing buying two cartons of eggs and a basket of apples?</p>
<p>Harry was doing the most domestic errands; buying groceries, books, and soil and it annoyed Natasha to no end. She was gritting her teeth at how <em> domestically boring </em> this boy was. How could this boy not a day over 17 be this troublesome to SHIELD and them turn out so, so normal?</p>
<p>“He’s buying food for another person, or other people, Director,” Natasha said, noticing how much food he was buying. He turned around, eyes glinting, and spoke to her, ”May I help you?”</p>
<p>Harry blinked and smiled his lopsided grin, dimples and all. Natasha smiled and bluffed, “I was just wondering which apples are sweeter, and I noticed you had both green and red apples in your basket.”</p>
<p>Natasha thought she was a pretty good liar and she was. Harry just had years, several long years of training that required him to be able to find the truth from several lying mouths. “I mean, you were obviously following me since the bookstore and talking into your earpiece frequently, so I’ll ask you again. May I help you?”</p>
<p>His tone was icy cold, but with that musical tone in his voice, he was able to sound intimidating and harmless. Harry’s green eyes pierced Natasha’s emerald ones and showed her that he wasn’t one to be pushed around. Natasha steeled her resolve and spoke, ”My name is-”</p>
<p>“Natasha Romanoff, agent of Shield, Avenger, right?” Harry cut her off, walking up to the cash register to pay for his food. “Did I get it all?”</p>
<p>“No, actually, but I am curious about how you got that information. Care to tell me?” Natasha said, crossing her arms and narrowed her eyes. The only thing he missed was <em> an assassin. </em></p>
<p>“Nope.” He replied, popping the ‘p’. Harry bundled his groceries and put it into his rucksack, which was a) too small to hold all of the groceries, b) already holding his books, soil and many other things that Natasha knew would be a load.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?” Natasha was starting to understand why Director Fury wanted this boy.</p>
<p>“Do what?” Harry responded, heaving the rucksack onto his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Fit everything you bought today in that small bag.” She said pointedly, nodding her head at his sack.</p>
<p>“Well you’re going to at least buy me dinner before I tell you my secrets,” he winked saucily and smiled. “Well, see you later, Natasha.”</p>
<p>And Harry disappeared after walking out of the double doors of the grocery store.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Steve was having a terrible day. He sat on a lonely bench at the park, trying to admire the stars and constellations. No one could blame him, really, it was just because he missed his best friend. He missed the feeling of belonging, the feeling of being loved no matter what he does or how he acted. Yes, the Avengers were his family, yes his home was with them, but no one could ever fill the gaping, large hole that James Buchanan Barnes left in him.</p>
<p>He was clinging to the little string of fragile hope that who he saw couple days ago was Bucky. He <em> looked </em> like Bucky, sounded like him, had the same blue eyes, but he didn’t recognize Steve, like <em> at all. </em></p>
<p>The next day, where the city had been flooded with Hydra agents, a teen had come and watched them fight. He appeared out of thin air, and had the air of a curious panther. His striking green eyes, wild onyx black hair, and charming features had stuck in Steve's mind like duct tape. The teen had stayed and watched them fight, not being touched by anyone or anything. He wouldn’t even move when Tony had come down from the sky, in all of his glory, and yelled for him to get away.</p>
<p>When the fight had died down, the boy jumped off the car top, and walked away, like nothing happened.</p>
<p>And he was in front of Steve. Right in front of him. Like his hair was up Steve’s nose.</p>
<p>The boy jumped back, startled and he chuckled, “Ah, my bad. Sorry mate.”</p>
<p>His British accent was melodic and twinkling, rolling off his tongue. Steve found himself smiling back at the boy, and sticking out his hand to shake their hand. “It’s alright. My name is Steve Rogers, but you would probably know me better as Captain America.”</p>
<p>“Well, everyone knows Captain America,” the boy said tilting his head back and laughed softly. “I’m Harry, by the way.”</p>
<p>Harry reached out and shook Steve’s hand. “Weren’t you at the fight yesterday? Why didn’t you leave?” Steve asked.</p>
<p>“Well you’ve got to make it on your own, right? I didn’t want to spend the night alone, so I decided watching people fight in person was much better than watching from my apartment window.” Harry walked around the park and lied down on the grass. “I personally thought the fight was rather boring.”</p>
<p>Steve laughed, and rolled his eyes. “Ah, these kids nowadays, always looking for some great fight with houses exploding and stuff.”</p>
<p>Harry sat up, and propped himself with his elbows before glaring at Steve, “I’m not that young, <em> mister-frozen-in-ice-for-70-years. </em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure. You look like you’re 17, Harry. Don’t try and trick me. Are you even legal?” Steve snorted, and layed down onto the grass beside Harry.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m legal. How dare you even ask me that question, Steve! I’m scandalized, Steve, <em> scandalized. </em> ” Harry gasped exaggeratedly, and slapped at Steve’s <em> very defined chest. </em></p>
<p>Steve had gotten along merrily with Harry, even letting him coax out a side of him that hadn’t appeared in a long time.</p>
<p>Harry was laughing so hard by the end of the night, feelin like he had drunk two bottles of firewhiskey. He had tears coming from his eyes and his stomach hurt, but he knew he had to get back to Loki or else Loki would go out and find him. “Ah, it’s getting late Steve. I better be getting back to home, or else L -uh - my roommate will start to get worried.”</p>
<p>Steve smile dropped a bit, but he nodded and let out an airy laugh. ‘Alright, I’ll walk you home then Harry.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no need. I can just apparate back.” Harry grinned and waved Steve off. “Wait, you Americans call it <em> teleporting </em>.”</p>
<p>Harry stood up, and brushed the grass off of him. “It was nice meeting you, Steve. I hope we could meet again soon.” Harry checked his wand holsters for his wands, and grabbed his holly wand discreetly.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s quite likely we’ll get to see each other again.”</p>
<p>Steve was up on his feet in record time. “Wait, you can teleport?” -but Harry was already gone with a crack that left Steve’s ears tingling. “I didn’t even get his last name.”</p>
<p>Steve sat back down on the bench. He realized that Harry had left his bag on the grass, and stood up to get it. Steve hauled the surprisingly heavy bag beside him on the bench, and opened it. He didn’t mean to snoop or find out that seemingly normal Harry could fit an entire library and refrigerators and garden soil into this small bag that could be bunched up and held in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>This is when Steve decided that Fury needed to know about this boy. This boy who could make things bigger on the inside, this boy who could watch the Avengers fight for hours and not have a single scratch on him, this boy who could teleport from one place to another. This boy who isn’t a day over 17 and can make everyone think he is innocent, but can do all of these things that couldn’t be explained by modern day science.</p>
<p>Steve held Harry’s rucksack in his hand. But one moment it was there, and another is was a hand full of sand and grass, and a note that read <em> I guess you shouldn’t go through someone’s bag. </em></p>
<p>He didn’t mean to, it was completely unintentional. Well, not really. He looking for a name tag or an address where Steve could drop off the bag. He didn’t mean to violate Harry’s personal space or <em> anything like that. </em></p>
<p>One thing Steve knew was that he had to go to Fury, and explain. Explain that he met the boy who had appeared and disappeared in the fight. He had to come clean, and tell everyone that Harry wasn’t a threat, but he could be.</p>

<p>“James Buchanan Barnes is my name. Friends and family call me Bucky. I am 25 years old. My best friend is Steve Rogers. I am the oldest of my brothers. Their names are-” James’s mumbling was cut off but a harsh slap to his face.</p>
<p>“No. You are not James Buchanan Barnes. You are the Winter Soldier, and you are my <em> asset. </em>”</p>
<p>James’s arms were strapped to a metal chair, and his head was held down by a thick leather cord. His ankles were tied to the chair legs and he was mumbling facts about his life, facts he had read about himself in the museum. James looked up, blue eyes suddenly stormy and grey. “I. Am not. Your. ASSET.”</p>
<p>James had started thrashing in his chair, pulling his left arm up, straining hard, making the straps fray and break. He grabbed the straps on his right arm and ripped them off with his metal fingers, and repeated the same thing with his ankles. Men clamoured, and spoke into their ear pieces, whispering and shouting all at once. “MY NAME IS JAMES BUCHANAN BARNES, AND I AM NOT YOUR ASSET.”</p>
