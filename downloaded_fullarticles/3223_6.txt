<hr/><p>It's been four days since he slept with the dark lord.</p><p>A few short days ago his life changed drastically in the matter of moments due to some red wine and no filter, and yet life goes on as if he hadn't betrayed everyone he knows by fucking the dark lord. When he closes his eyes he can still see it, Voldemort's serpentine face contorted in pleasure, he can still feel it happening in his mind. The strong insistent way Voldemort fucked him, holding him so close. He can still taste his lips if he thinks back. The love marks have faded, for the most part, all but the teeth marks on his neck, and the darkest of the bruises. The bruises on his hips, from where Voldemort's fingers clasped so tightly, are yellow and purple in equal measure, nearly healing. In a few days he'll have no marks to show that he'd slept with his enemy, maybe a scar where his teeth bit deeply as Harry had come, screaming with pleasure. In the corner of the room he's rented at the Leaky Cauldron for break, lay the crumpled stolen robes, unwashed, still smelling of sex, Harry's cum staining the black silk from where it had landed as Voldemort fucked him. He shivers looking at them. The ghost of that day clings to his skin like a physical thing, a reminder in everything from the falling snow to the right shade of red.</p><p>Harry stands, shaking out of his stupor. Ginny is coming to get him any minute, he thinks she made sure she could go alone so they could hook up before he arrives, and the thought makes him feel even more horrible for cheating on her. Ginny is the perfect girlfriend, beautiful and kind and wonderful. If anyone would be understanding of his infidelity it would be her, but he doesn't deserve her kindness or understanding. He sighs, running a hand down his face.</p><p>A knock at the door makes Harry wince. Now or never. He opens the door and his girlfriend throws herself at him, kissing him. Harry stands stiff and still in her arms, unresponsive, until she pulls back. "What's..." She trails off, eyes widening when she sees the marks. She doesn't look hurt, which is a good sign. He thinks. "Who gave you those?"</p><p>Mortified, Harry squeezes his eyes shut. "Voldemort."</p><p>When he peeks his eyes open Ginny is staring at him with an incredulous expression, so shocked she looks a bit like an owl. Apparently she sees something in her face, because her face gets even more shocked, but also amused. "Oh my god." She gasps, a hysterical chuckle. "Fuck Harry, you're serious?"</p><p>He nods. "You know how I followed Draco Malfoy to that party?"</p><p>"Yes." Ginny smiles. "I thought you'd hook up with him, not the bloody dark lord. Geez Harry."</p><p>Harry blinks at his girlfriend. "I'm sorry." He gasps. "What?"</p><p>Ginny laughs at his expression. "Oh love, you thought I'd care you cheated?" He nods, because why the hell wouldn't she. "You remember when we first got together, when I said I loved you but that I didn't really like sex with guys all the time?" Harry nods once again. "When you gave me permission to sleep with other girls as long as I shared details, I figured it was obvious that you had the same permission, but with guys. You have my permission to cheat as long as it's not with another girl, love. That category does include the dark lord, though I never in my life thought I'd need to include him on the list of people you might screw."</p><p>Harry blinks, once twice, then laughs, long and hard and slightly hysterical. "Ginny, love of my life, have I ever told you that your're the literal best girlfriend ever."</p><p>She grins, warm and sweet, brown eyes glittering. "Once or twice." Then she grabs his hands and drags him to the bed so they can sit. "Now, tell me everything."</p><p>No longer afraid of Ginny's wrath, Harry tells her all about his little fling with the dark lord. He tells her about the robes, which she demands to see, the mask, which he has to reluctantly tell her he left behind, and the party. He tells her about the dancing and the wine and how he left to go home before he did something stupid, only to end up in the wrong side of the house alone with Voldemort. When he gets to the part about Voldemort telling him to kneel, she laughs.</p><p>"You did what?" Her face is so amused.</p><p>Harry turns crimson. "I got to my knees thinking he wanted me to suck him off." He repeats, cheeks stained red with embarrassment. Ginny rolls of the bed she laughs so hard. Harry scowls. "Laugh it up girl." he smirks, then he removes his shirt so she can see the full extent of his nearly healed marks.</p><p>Her eyes darken. "Damn." she sounds breathy. Her fingers trace the trail of marks, a low whistle. "He really did a number on you."</p><p>He smirks again, then continues to tell her what the dark lord said. He tells her about the sex, how he sucked the dark lord off in his office, and how it led to the most absolutely mind blowing sex of his life, and Ginny grins the more he tells her, her eyes darkening with desire. He tells her how he could have sworn some one walked in on him as the dark lord was fucking him on the desk, quite possibly Draco Malfoy, and that the dark lord had noticed too.</p><p>"He said those exact words?" Ginny interrupts. "<em>Put a show on for our guest.</em> Those exact words?"</p><p>Harry nods, already aroused by the memories. "In parseltongue." He clarifies. "So either he didn't realize he was understood, or he hadn't realized he wasn't speaking English."</p><p>Ginny smiles, languid and lusty. "Damn that's hot."</p><p>Harry chuckles, then continues his story, letting her know all about how he'd moaned louder and made sure to do exactly as asked, putting on a show for some stranger who might or might not have been the younger Malfoy. He tells her how they left after Harry and Voldemort came, quick enough the tapping of their shoes echoed down the hall. He tells her how after a few minutes the dark lord pulled him down into his lap on a chair, and how shortly after the older Malfoy walked in.</p><p>"Wait you were seen naked by both the Malfoys?" Ginny laughs.</p><p>"Pretty sure I was, yeah." he chuckles.</p><p>"And then what?" Ginny's eyes sparkle.</p><p>"I left. I couldn't be found out, so I took a shower and left." He shrugs. "Flooed here."</p><p>Ginny giggles. "Well, are you going to sleep with him again?"</p><p>Harry shakes his head. "I don't know if that's possible." He says, honest.</p><p>His girlfriend hums. "Well, let me know if he finds out your identity and becomes your boyfriend. That way five years from now, when we are married, I can introduce us at parties in a really convoluted way." She mines waving to a group of people. "Hi there. I'm Ginny Potter, and this is my girlfriend Luna, and my husband Harry, and Harry's boyfriend Tom, also known as the Dark Lord.."</p><p>Harry stutters out a laugh. "Girl, if he finds out who I am I'll die, but if that happens you will be the first to know. I just can't imagine how I'd tell anyone else."</p><p>"Bring him to dinner." She suggests. Harry throws a pillow at her.</p><p>--</p><p>When they get to the Burrow, Ron immediately falls upon them to ask what took them so long, only to see the marks all over Harry's neck. He launches himself at Harry with a roar, and Harry has to dodge until Arthur arrives to hold him back. "Ron!" He yells. "What is the meaning of this?"</p><p>Ron snarls in the hold. "He slept with my sister!"</p><p>Arthur's eyes widen at the sight of the marks, but before anything can escalate Ginny breaks them up by yelling, "Oi! Don't jump to conclusions. Those are from Harry's boyfriend." Everyone in the house freezes where they are, including Ginny and Harry, who both look to one another with wide eyes and red faces. "Oh my gosh Harry, I'm sorry." She says, obviously thinking on her feet even as she apologizes. "I forgot to ask if you wanted to keep that aspect of our relationship a secret."</p><p>Harry shrugs. "Little late now love." Then he turns to the gathered Weasleys and Hermione as if he hadn't been given permission officially only an hour earlier. As if this was old news to the two of them, not discussed literally ten minutes before their arrival. "Sorry for this." He says, then he turns to look exclusively at Ron. "Mate, Ginny and I have an agreement, okay? We are allowed to be intimate with people of the same gender. We took so long because we were swapping stories and we didn't expect you'd want to be around."</p><p>Ron doesn't move, shocked boneless in Arthur's arms. "You mean you guys have some sort of weird super kinky relationship where your allowed to walk out on each other and have partners as long as they are the same gender as you, and you didn't tell me or Hermione?" he asks.</p><p>Harry and Ginny look at each other and burst out laughing in unison. Ginny recovers. "Dude, you reacted like this when you'd though we had sex like a normal couple. We expected you to explode if we ever told you. And Harry's boyfriend is new, and not very serious right now, where as Luna and I have been dating longer than me and Harry have been."</p><p>Luna?" Hermione asks. "Luna Lovegood?"</p><p>Ginny grins, wide and sweet, romantic. "That's right." She beams.</p><p>Luckily the rest of the Weasleys deem Harry's not serious <em>boyfriend </em>less important than Ginny's very serious girlfriend, and the conversation is dropped in favor of Ginny talking about Luna. All things considered, everyone takes it fairly well. They all accept his and Ginny's story, and that is all there is too it. No more is speaks more about it, not even as everyone is sent for bed. Only, Ron remains distant until the presents are opened in the morning and all is seemingly forgiven.</p><p>--</p><p>Christmas passes without anything happening, and December draws to an end. Harry is asked to stay at the Weasleys for the rest of the summer and he agrees, but tells them he needs to make sure to get his things. It's not a lie, but in truth he just wants a little more time to pretend he isn't Harry Potter. Five minutes of peace where he can just pretend him sleeping with the dark lord wasn't the worst betrayal he could have done. Ginny goes with him, but leaves so she can visit Luna. Since she admitted to dating the girl, Molly hasn't been letting her go spend the night anymore. Ron and Hermione come too, like it's meant to be a double date, but they go find a dark corner to shag in like hypocrites, and Harry is left to be blissfully alone. He's just left the leaky cauldron when he runs into someone.</p><p>Harry's eyes widen as he looks at Voldemort, or Tom Riddle more accurately. He looks like sixteen year old Tom Riddle, but older. Handsome, pale, and dark haired. Same high cheekbones and piercing eyes. Grey streaks the sides of his neatly styled hair, but otherwise he just looks like he could be in his twenties. His eyes are still red, but a dark maroon that could almost pass as brown. Harry can't help but wonder how much the universe must hate him, for him to run into Voldemort of all people, here, looking human and still just as sinfully gorgeous as he could be in his more serpentine form.</p><p>"Harry Potter." Voldemort hisses, and he clambers to his feet, brushing the dirt from his suit and robes. "I'm not here to fight with you. I'm minding my own business and I'm really not in the mood."</p><p>Harry climbs to his own feet, brushing himself off, and he tries not to let his face redden as he remembers exactly how he'd seen the dark lord last, only ten days earlier. He's still ranting, but Harry can't help but notice the ways the light glints off his ebony hair, how his skin looks in the winter sunlight. He thinks on Ginny's words and realizes with startling clarity that he does want Voldemort to become a regular part of his life, not in trying to kill him, but in destroying him in a much more pleasurable way.</p><p>"...so if you could just..." He trails off, having finally actually looked at Harry, flushed, lips parted, eyes darkened. Harry can see the moment he's found out, and he shivers as the dark lord runs a sharp nailed finger across his bottom lip. "I know this mouth." He says.</p><p>"Huh?" Harry tries, suddenly a little wary. He doesn't even know how the dark lord will react to such information.</p><p>"Hard to forget when these lips have been wrapped so sinfully around my cock." Harry feels his legs quiver at those words, spoken deeper and filled with equal measures of lust and confusion.</p><p>From the pocket of his robes he pulls out a mask, Harry's mask from the party, red and gold glinting in a stunning way in the dappled winter light. Harry's mouth widens in shock at the sight of it, he'd expected it to be thrown away, and like the prince putting Cinderella's shoe upon her foot to reveal her to be the maiden he danced with at the ball, Voldemort removes his glasses and ties the mask around his face to prove he's exactly who he thinks he is. He steps back, sucks in a sharp glass, then grabs Harry and pulls him to a nearby dark corner, pushing him back against the wall.</p><p>The dark lord kisses Harry, and he wasn't expecting that, but he melts into it anyways, his hands grasping at the dark lord's robes with need. Their lips move and tongues battle with ardor, Harry moaning into his mouth, ready to receive anything the dark lord could ask him to. He pulls back, and there is an anger in his eyes that mixes with the passion. "What is the meaning of this, Harry Potter?"</p><p>Harry doesn't know what to say. "What would you like me to tell you, my lord?" He whispers the last words lowly, the same as he had when he'd been naked in the dark lord's lap, pleased to see him shiver.</p><p>"The truth." Voldemort demands, no less menacing with his human face.</p><p>Harry sighs. "I wasn't trying to seduce you." He answers, licking his lips to chase the taste of him. "I went to the party to get away, to pretend to be someone else. I got drunk, drunk enough that I had no inhibitions or reservations, and I knew I'd need to leave before I did something absolutely stupid. I went into the wrong wing, and you were there. I thought I'd been asked to kneel because you wanted me to pleasure you, and I figured maybe you asked that of your followers often, and the idea wasn't absolutely disgusting. In fact I thought it sounded like a really good idea. I didn't lie about finding you attractive, I do, and I knew it was a once in a lifetime chance to act out on that desire. I'm sorry I lied, I am, but I'm not sorry for what happened, even if you kill me. Though, I'm kind of hoping you will decide that I'm not lying about trying to seduce you to the light side, and you'll take me to bed again, but you could pretend this never happened and we can go back to killing each other next time if you'd prefer."</p><p>Voldemort looks very stunned by his words. He chuckles. "You think I sleep with all of my followers, darling?" The last word is a hissed noise almost like a growl. His finger traces Harry's lips again.</p><p>Harry shivers. "I don't know what you do." He admits.</p><p>"I don't sleep with me followers." He purrs, crowding Harry tighter against the wall. "In all my years as a dark lord I'd never taken a follower, especially not a recruit."</p><p>Harry flushes. "Then why did you chose me?"</p><p>He looks at Harry with hooded eyes. "You were by far the most bold to ever come onto me." His voice is warm and sultry. "I've been propositioned by many of my followers, none quite as enticing. You've no idea how you looked, kneeling below me, glancing shyly up at me from behind that mask, obvious and intrepid in the face of your desires. You're a beautiful boy, Harry Potter, and that night I saw you in the darkness and I'd been unable to place your familiarity, but I did find you desirable."</p><p>Harry shivers at the implication, but asks anyways, so he can be sure. "Do you normally find me to be attractive, or just when I'm masked and begging?"</p><p>Voldemort shivers. "What shall you do with that information, Harry Potter?"</p><p>Harry licks his lips. "What shall you do with yours?" He returns.</p><p>His hand snakes into Harry's hair, and his lips claim Harry's own fiercely. When he pulls away he looks at Harry with undisguised lust. "Come with me."</p><p>It's a bad idea, worse than the first time, but Harry nods shakily at the offer. He does want this, while Voldemort isn't planning on killing him for it. The dark lord apparates them both, and his feet hit the familiar entry way floor of the Malfoy Manor. He stumbles a bit, trying to regain his center of balance, and the dark lord chuckles at him, and scoops him up into his arms like a blushing bride. He walks into a room with a group of death eaters, all looking very shocked when the dark lord comes into the room with another person in his arm, including Lucius Malfoy, who seems to recognize him from the last time he wore this mask, and Severus Snape, who no doubt recognizes him as himself judging by his face, having seen him recently without the mask. The other's luckily don't seem to recognize Harry as himself, which he's grateful for, and the six people in the room are clearly aware of who Voldemort is despite his human appearance.</p><p>"I'm going to be indisposed for a while." He says. "If anyone disturbs us I will murder you, favored or not."</p><p>The door slams behind him, but before they are too far gone he can hear someone laugh in a relaxed way. "I'm so fucking high right now I saw the dark lord come in with Harry Potter."</p>
