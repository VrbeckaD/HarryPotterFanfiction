    <p>Remus Lupin kisses much the way he does everything else: precisely and politely and with an amused air of detachment at some private joke. It’s the little things that give him away, thinks Tonks. The sound he makes in his throat which is as much pleasure as it is surprise, the way his left hand comes up to skim her cheek and ear before settling decorously on her shoulder.</p>
<p>She opens her eyes mid-way, and decides that if it all gets too awkward, she’ll blame Arthur Weasley’s eggnog. Eggnog and Christmas cheer and the fact that 12 Grimmauld Place has <em>vicious</em> mistletoe. Sirius spent a full four minutes that afternoon clobbering one fanged sprig into paste with a mop after it tried to intimidate him into snogging Kreacher. The garland hanging above them has a particularly nasty looking specimen, and she’s about to take Remus’ shoulder and settle into a better position for the long haul, but then the mistletoe scuttles off into a corner,  and they are awkwardly pulling apart.</p>
<p>“Well,” he says after a minute, “That was certainly, uh...unexpected.” His voice stutters slightly, and she can see a pulse thudding at the base of his throat and in his temple.</p>
<p>“Well,” she says, aping his professorial register, “It <em>is</em> Christmas, Lupin. The whole point is to eat too much, drink too much, and finish off the evening in a darkened corner somewhere, impersonating the Giant Squid.”</p>
<p>He laughs. “Whatever happened to larger goals like ‘peace on earth, good will to men’?”</p>
<p>“Urgh, whoever thought up good will to men never worked with Dawlish.”  She lets herself flop sideways, pinning him against the doorjamb in a friendly fashion. “I’ve got early shift tomorrow. Who schedules a 4:30 to 8:00 shift on Boxing Day anyways? I might as well just stay up all night.”</p>
<p>“Mmm.”</p>
<p>She can feel the vibrations from his voice burring and humming against her ear, and has to suppress the urge to rub her face against his wooly jumper. Remus is nice and warm, if more than a little bony, and so she stays leaning against him, listening to his heart beat and letting her hands dangle at her sides, feeling boneless and slow.</p>
<p>“Tonks?” he says quietly.</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm?”                          </p>
<p>“Perhaps you could stand somewhere that isn’t on my foot?” His voice is warm and good-humored, but there’s a discernable tension.  Although she thinks that could be because he’s craning his neck upwards, and leaning awkwardly to the side, clearly looking to see where the mistletoe has skulked off to.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she says hastily. She catches an earring on his jumper when she lifts her head from his chest.  “Sorry,” she says again, struggling with tiny metal clasps. “Oh Merlin’s pants, I’m stuck. Should come with a warning, really, shouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>Remus laughs. “What, don’t operate while inebriated?”</p>
<p>He has beautiful hands, she thinks. Gracious, aristocratic wrist bones arching out into a cellist’s hand span. His middle and index fingers on each hand are, she realizes with a spurt of amusement, the same length. The Muggle folklorists would have a field day.  Those long balletic fingers move her own hand out of the way, and detangle her ear from his chest and, feeling more than slightly giddy, she tries to move hastily away from him, and stomps on his other foot extricating herself.</p>
<p>“I,” she announces, “have definitely had too much eggnog. I think Arthur spiked it with Ogden’s.”</p>
<p>“I’m beginning to think he spiked it with a sleeping draught,” says Remus. He gives her a quick, apologetic smile. “I may have to desert you shortly; I’m sinking fast.”</p>
<p>What he doesn’t say, because they both know it, is that the full moon was only two days ago, and, she thinks, she hasn’t actually seen him eat or drink much of anything apart from water all day.</p>
<p>She draws herself up and, in the most withering voice she can summon, thinking of her mother at her most dismissive, says, ”Go, Lupin, go. The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black permits you to go drink hot cocoa and nurse your squashed feet. Ooops. Balls.” Her extravagantly imperious wave towards the door has sent two gold-rimmed dishes of the Most Noble House of Black spinning to their demise on the flagstone floor.</p>
<p>Remus would normally be the first person to grin and cast a <em>reparo</em> charm, but instead, he’s utterly silent, and when she looks away from the plate fragments, he’s frozen against the door jamb, whey-faced and staring at her with what looks almost like horror.</p>
<p>“Remus?” she says uncertainly. “Mate? You alright?”</p>
<p>For an awful moment, she thinks that he might be about to collapse, and she reaches towards him, wondering if she has enough arm strength to break what looks like an inevitable fall, and about to bellow for Sirius. But then the colour comes flooding back into his face and he takes in a long deep breath, a drowning man restored to the surface, and manages a grimace of a smile and shifts back slightly, just out of her reach.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” he says. “Fine. It’s just…” he trails off and clears his throat. “Just a bit of a turn,” he said finally, but she can see one of those beautiful hands white-knuckling the doorjamb.</p>
<p>“You need to sit down,” she says, bluntly. “Here.” She hauls out a chair from the table, kicking plate fragments into the corner, and puts her hand under his elbow. He flinches, but Tonks decides that the time for niceties is past, and she frog-marches him the few feet to the chair and unceremoniously dumps him into it.</p>
<p>She riffles through the plethora of Christmas dinner leftovers on the counter, wondering where a good Muggle box of Quality Street is when you need it, and shovels two mince pies, a cup of tea with three sugars, and a handful of brightly wrapped candies down in front of him.</p>
<p>Remus, looking squeamish, pokes gingerly at one of the candies. “I think I’ll forgo these. I have my suspicions as to their origins, and a Nougat Nosebleed isn’t something that I want to receive for Christmas.”  He manages a smile. “Thank you for the tea though.”</p>
<p>“You sure you’re all right?” she says suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you.” But there’s clearly something he isn’t saying.</p>
<p>A little known fact about Nymphadora Tonks is, she thinks, that she can, on occasion, with good reason, be patient. And if there’s one thing that her favourite local werewolf dislikes almost more than anything else, it’s a deeply awkward silence.</p>
<p>There is a deeply awkward silence. It continues. It continues until Sirius comes barging through the door carrying a stack of dirty plates, an orange paper crown hanging off of one ear.</p>
<p>“Why’re you both in here, the party’s out – hell’s bells!” he says, staring at Tonks and only just managing to retain his grip on the wavering crockery stack. “Why’d you morph into Bellatrix? Give us all heart attacks, little cousin.”</p>
<p>“I – what?” she says, bewildered. She looks at Remus. He gives a faint smile.</p>
<p>“It nearly gave me one,” he said. “I almost thought it was Polyjuice wearing off until I realized that Bellatrix wouldn’t be caught dead in jeans. And that – “ he stops abruptly, and flushes  scarlet from throat to forehead and buries his face in his teacup. Sirius is watching them both with a raised eyebrow and a far too knowing eye, but all he says, kindly, is, “Maybe you should lay off the eggnog, Tonksie. The last time I saw you morphing without realizing it, you were in diapers.”</p>
<p>She gapes like a dimmock at the pair of them, and starts to speak but can’t think of anything to say. She puts her hand up to her cheek and feels the planes of a face, her own, natural face, that she hasn’t voluntarily worn since her mother vanished her aunts from all of the Tonks family photos when she was four. She thinks that she should say something, but all that comes out is a strangled, ragged sound. She panics and tries to morph back, back to a face that heart-shaped rather than feline, eyes that are blue like her father’s rather than grey and heavy lidded, bright pink short hair rather than the dull,straight, mousy blonde that now spills past her collarbone. The morph starts and stops and starts again and jerks to a halt and she feels like her lungs are too big for her chest, her ribs clamping down on them, and then she is panicking, really panicking because now her hands are morphing into claws and her ears are ratcheting through a wild variety of shapes and sizes and she can’t stop it any of it and –</p>
<p>“Here.” Her cousin’s hands grab the back of her head, and jam her face into a hastily conjured paper bag. She gives an indignant squawk.</p>
<p>“Breathe into the bag,” says Sirius firmly. “Remember, Moony?  That was rule one of babysitting.”</p>
<p>She is puffing heavily into the bag, but can feel the claws retracting, can feel her hands resuming a normal shape, can feel the tingle in her ears beginning to lessen and her ribs expand again. “Babysitting?” she finally manages to say.</p>
<p>“We were trusted with you exactly once,” says Remus drily. “You were maybe two and a half. It wasn’t a successful afternoon for anyone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t remember,” she says, wheezing.</p>
<p>“You morphed your legs into an emu’s within the first half hour, and then screamed hysterically for the next four hours until Andromeda got home.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t figure out how to get you to morph back,” says Sirius. “Andromeda said that you could usually be forced to change back by breathing into a paper bag like the Muggles do, but it didn’t work. We thought you’d scream yourself sick; Moony ended up carrying you up and down the living room for ages, trying to get you to calm down, but you just kept crying and kicking him in the shins with your pointy emu feet.”</p>
<p>By the time Sirius pulls the bag away from her face, she’s recovered enough to be able to ape her normal self and raises her arms towards Remus across the table. “Come on then Lupin,“ she says, “Relive those moments.”</p>
<p>“As heart-warming as that would be, I don’t think my shins could take it,” says Remus. His smile is teasing, affectionate, but it fades quickly into a more anxious gaze. She doesn’t need a mirror to know that her face is still as nature and the Black family tree have made it.</p>
<p>“Well,” says Sirius. “The bag trick seems to have worked this time anyways. The claws have gone, although I did rather like them.” He gently jostles Tonks’ shoulder. “Look, come have a butterbeer and a game of Exploding Snap before everyone calls it a night.”</p>
<p>“I – “ she clears her throat. She doesn’t know how to say that she would sooner die than she would go into a room with Order members and Weasleys and Harry Potter looking like a mirror image of Bellatrix Lestrange. She wonders wildly if she could just put the paper bag over her head instead, and go around like that until everything goes back to normal.</p>
<p>“I think perhaps Tonks might just want a bit of quiet for a bit,” says Remus blandly, and where normally she’d want to tell someone off for talking on her behalf, she instead feels inordinately grateful and a bit teary.  Merlin, but she is thoroughly drunk, she realizes, standing up.</p>
<p>“I’m just going to…” she gestures towards the door and mumbles, “…powder nose” and stumbles her way out. It’s a minor miracle that she doesn’t trip over anyone’s boots in the hall, and she struggles her way up the stairs and into the refuge of the second floor bathroom where she can curl up in a ball and cry if she wants to and no one will be able to hear her.</p>
<p>She doesn’t cry after all, but the face in the mirror makes her feel panicky and sick, and she can’t face going back downstairs when she does bring herself to leave the bathroom.</p>
<p>The guest bedroom down the hall is hers for the night – she’ll be sharing with Ginny Weasley, but Ginny is still downstairs, and with any luck, this will just be an aberration caused by eggnog, and her morphing will be back to normal come the morning.</p>
<p>She shuffles her way along the hall, waits for a break in the noise from below, bellows “Goodnighthappychristmas” down the stairs, and crawls into bed and pulls the covers up over her head. The dark engulfs her, and comes as a relief.</p>
