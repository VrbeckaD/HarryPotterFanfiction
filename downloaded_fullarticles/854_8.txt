    <p>The raging winter wind howled against the windows of the Gryffindor Common Room. This was the third storm the school had seen that year, and definitely the most intense. The sky seemed to have an endless amount of snow to dump onto the castle, and the wind was clearly determined to worm its way through as many cracks as possible. Even with the fireplace still going, the biting draft could still be felt by the lone student still awake in the tower.</p>
<p>Seto sat on the plush sofa near the fireplace with his laptop on his lap. He had barely stayed in the dormitory for more than five minutes before coming to the conclusion that the wind and snow beating on their tower windows was going to keep him up all night.  With that in mind, he didn’t bother changing into his pajamas, pulled on a thick Kaiba Corp sweater over his clothes, and retreated back downstairs.</p>
<p>How Yugi and Bakura managed to sleep through this weather was beyond him.</p>
<p>He stopped paying attention to what time it was after reading through three chapters of <em>Defensive Magical Theory</em>. If even that poor excuse for a textbook wasn’t enough to tire him out, than nothing would. So he moved on to checking in at work, because if he was going to be stuck awake for the time being, at least <em>that</em> kept his interest.</p>
<p>Sometime after clearing out a chain of emails that had <em>nothing </em>to do with him, the sound of a door opening and closing was heard from somewhere up the girls’ staircase. Hermione emerged a few moments later with her a rather large book tucked under her arm.</p>
<p>“Let me guess,” said Seto, glancing up, “You can’t sleep.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, hugging the book to her chest. “Not really.”</p>
<p>Hermione then looked towards the common room windows. “It doesn’t help that the storm is trying to blow the tower off the side of the castle.”</p>
<p>Seto nodded his head towards the spot next to him. “You going to try and use Umbridge’s book to knock yourself back out? I already tried that – it doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>“No…this is light reading,” said Hermione, taking the offered seat and drawing her knees up against her chest. “But I don’t think I’d be able to go back to bed if I tried.” She reached for a discarded <em>Daily Prophet</em>. “I saw that more Death Eaters made it out of Azkaban this morning, and I guess it was on my mind when I went to sleep.”</p>
<p>Seto peered over at the headlines and skimmed the first bit of the article. “Antonin Dolohov seems to be the only one they mention in detail …I take it you have a history.”</p>
<p>“He was there at the Department of Mysteries last spring…he almost killed both me and Neville, and if it weren’t for Harry being, well, <em>Harry</em>, he might have been killed too. He is <em>brutal</em> when it came to his spells, and seems to favor this one I’ve never heard of before. He cast it silently, so I have no idea what the incantation was to research it – if there even is one – but…” She trailed off, wincing at the memory, and she could have sworn her ribs gave a bit of a throb too. “…Recovery from it took a <em>very </em>long time.”</p>
<p>After a minute, Hermione tossed the newspaper back onto the table. “I guess, like most people, I felt a lot better when he was still stuck in prison.”</p>
<p>It was clear she didn’t want to go into it more than that so he let the subject drop.</p>
<p>Hermione shifted to lean up against him, and rested her head on his shoulder. “So what’s keeping <em>you</em> up?”</p>
<p>Seto waved a hand. “My brain doesn’t turn off. There are always too many thoughts running through it.” He shook his head. He didn’t really want to get into the resurfacing nightmares of his past, and she already knew about the rather savage visits by the mysterious Shadow. “It is very rare that I will actually sleep the entire night through.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed. “How do you ever manage to stay awake during the day?”</p>
<p>“Coffee.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, I should have guessed.” She snuggled in a little closer. “Do you mind if I sit here with you and just…read for a while?”</p>
<p>Seto raised an eyebrow and looked down at her. “That’s the sort of question you ask <em>before </em>you get comfortable, not after.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Hermione muttered, “It’s late and I’m not thinking straight. Not <em>all </em>of us can be night-owls like you.”</p>
<p>Seto repositioned himself slightly against the new weight pressed up against his side, and watched her open her book. “That’s not one of your textbooks.”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head. “After that day where Yugi helped explain about the Millennium Items, I tried to find out as much as I could of Egyptian magic and mythology. I thought something in here might be able to help the Pharaoh’s spirit find his memories.”</p>
<p>Seto raised an eyebrow. “Somehow I don’t think you’re going to solve the Pharaoh’s problems in that book. It’s…a bit more complicated than that.”</p>
<p>“Well, the subject is at least interesting, even if it can’t help.” Hermione said. “Maybe there’s something in here that will help with <em>your </em>problem.”</p>
<p>Seto snorted and turned back to his laptop. “I doubt there is any information on mysterious Shadows in any book – especially ones that rely on magic resonating from cursed artifacts.”</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,” she sighed, and stretched into a more comfortable position. “But I still plan on reading through this anyway. Even if it can’t do anything for the Millennium Items or shadow monsters, the subject matter is still interesting.”</p>
<p>Seto waved the arm that wasn’t pinned into his side. “Well, don’t let me stop you.”</p>
<p>They sat in silence, the tapping of fingers against the keys or the rustle of turning pages the only indication that the other was still awake.</p>
<p>While it didn’t seem possible, the wind outside managed to pick up even harder, and after a while, Seto’s typing had slowed down once he noticed that his left hand started shaking against the keyboard. It took a moment to realize that there was nothing wrong with his hand, or by extension, his arm – <em>he </em>wasn’t even the one shaking.</p>
<p>“If you were cold, you should have said something.”</p>
<p>Hermione lifted her head off his shoulder. “It’s fine – it’s just the draft from the windows. It’ll be fine once the wind dies down.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Seto sardonically, “Because it’s done such a good job at it thus far.”</p>
<p>Hermione huffed. “I’ll be alright…”</p>
<p>“You’re shivering hard enough that it’s making <em>me </em>shake.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed, put her head back down, and curled in a little closer. “You’re <em>warm</em> though,” she said. “I could stay like this for a while.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the way this is going – you’re likely to push me off the couch every time you do that.” He shrugged his left shoulder to gently push her upwards. “Sit up.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t realize how much she was pressing into him until she needed to grab onto the back of the sofa to straighten up. Her eyes widened as he leaned forward, pulled off the Kaiba Corp sweater he was wearing over his uniform shirt and sweater vest and handed it to her. “W-what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“You’re freezing. Put it on.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked down at the navy sweater deposited in her arms. “But won’t you be cold?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Hermione was skeptical. “You’re certain?”</p>
<p>Seto raised an eyebrow. “You <em>clearly </em>need it more than I do.”</p>
<p>Hermione slipped the sweater over her head. It fit, though it was a bit large on her, but most importantly, it felt <em>cozy</em>.</p>
<p>Seto settled back down again. “Better?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, much better.” She glanced up. “Are you sure you’ll be fine?”</p>
<p>“With you practically squashing me? I think I’ll manage.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it,” she said, and went back to huddling up against him, though without as much of the weight as before.  “You’re comfortable.”</p>
<p>“If you sit like that for too long, you’re going to regret it in your neck or your back come morning.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Hermione muttered softly, “I’ll deal with that in the morning then because I don’t feel like moving.”</p>
<p>“I gathered as much.”</p>
<p>Hermione paused in the middle of turning the page. “You…you’re sure you’re alright with me being here? I’m not distracting you or anything?”</p>
<p>“If I didn’t want you sitting here with me, I wouldn’t have offered it in the first place. And if you’re truly worried about… <em>this</em>,” he gestured to her cuddling position, “Don’t. Mokuba does this all the time.”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, rested her head back down and returned to reading her book, Seto went back to his emails, and they continued again in silence.</p>
<p>Seto lost track of how much time had actually passed, but after a while realized that the pages in her book stopped turning, and there was an increased weight against his left side.</p>
<p>Hermione’s hand lay across the book, keeping it open against the couch, but she had fallen asleep with her head nestled against his shoulder.</p>
<p>Seto shifted slightly to alleviate the numbness that was beginning to seep through his left arm from lack of use, but she didn’t stir.</p>
<p>He took a moment to watch the calm rise and fall of her chest as she peacefully slept, and resigned himself to the fact that he was going to be stuck for a while.</p>
<p>That was fine. It wasn’t as if he was tired anyway. And at least she didn’t seem cold anymore.</p>
<p>He settled a bit heavier against the back of the couch to get more comfortable, and returned to reviewing the lines of code scrolling down his screen.</p>
