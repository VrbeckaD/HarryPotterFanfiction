</p><p>Waiting by the window<br/>
Amber eyes search horizons<br/>
Wanting him home</p><p>Waiting in the Floo<br/>
Emerald eyes search the dark<br/>
Wanting her warmth</p><p>Standing by the stairs<br/>
Trembling fingers touch frames<br/>
Fearing his fate</p><p>Standing in the storm<br/>
Trembling wand touches skin<br/>
Fearing her wrath</p><p>Walking to the bed<br/>
Shivering body curls under covers<br/>
Aching for his touch</p><p>Walking to the door<br/>
Shivering hand curls around brass<br/>
Aching for her warmth</p><p>Waking in terror<br/>
Amber eyes search the room<br/>
Wanting him home</p><p>Waking from sleepwalking<br/>
Emerald eyes search the room<br/>
Wanting her warmth</p><p>Standing by the bed<br/>
Trembling fingers touch his face<br/>
Fearing their fate</p><p>Standing in silence<br/>
Trembling wand touches her hair<br/>
Fearing her regret</p><p>Walking into his arms<br/>
Shivering body curls into his strength<br/>
Aching for normal</p><p>Walking into her fear<br/>
Shivering hands curl in her hair<br/>
Aching for forgiveness</p><p>Waking from her nightmare<br/>
Amber eyes drop crystal tears<br/>
Wanting his promise</p><p>Waking from his fears<br/>
Emerald eyes drop deep regret<br/>
Wanting her strength</p><p>Laying on the pillow<br/>
Auburn locks settle<br/>
Tangling with his</p><p>Laying on the pillow<br/>
Jet strands rest<br/>
Tangling with hers</p><p>Falling into sleep<br/>
Quiet whispers fill the space<br/>
Healing his soul</p><p>Falling into peace<br/>
Quiet promises fill the space<br/>
Healing her heart</p></div>
