    <p>His mother's hand, stroking his temple.</p>
<p>"The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamt I held you in my arms. When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken... and I hung my head and cried."</p>
<p>His mother's voice, gently crooning.</p>
<p>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are grey, you'll never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away..."</p>
<p>"Can you sing it all, Mommy?" he asked, mostly wanting to put off going to sleep.</p>
<p>"That's the important part, the rest doesn't matter," she said, her fingers brushing against his cheek. "Goodnight, baby. No arguing, now."</p>
<p>"Okay..." he sighed, pulling his stuffed dog up to his neck. "Night night, Mommy."</p>
<p>She bent in and kissed his forehead, then his cheek, the same spots her fingers had been. Then she made sure he was tucked in tight before leaving the room, keeping the door slightly ajar. There was a softly glowing orb hovering above the rocking chair in the corner of his room, giving off a purple light for him to sleep to. There was also the light of the full moon coming in from the window.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Remus Lupin yawned loudly and rolled over, settling in for sleep, still hearing his mother singing to him in his head. He was almost asleep when he heard raised voices from downstairs. They were really loud, upsetting him. He shifted around in his bed then wriggled out from under the blanket, walking over to the door and crouching down.</p>
<p>"...orts of him being nearby, that doesn't scare you?" his mother said, rather loud, very frightened.</p>
<p>Remus stuck his fingers in his mouth, feeling afraid at hearing his mother so afraid.</p>
<p>"We'll be fine," his father snapped back, causing Remus to flinch at how angry he sounded. "It's not like it understands anything this time of the month anyway."</p>
<p>"You said he's different, what if he wants revenge for--"</p>
<p>"It, not he!" Remus stepped back at the tone in his father's voice, sucking on his fingers even harder. "If it wanted revenge, it could have done so last month." He heard a soft noise behind him and turned around, staring around the room but not seeing anything. "We'll be fine." He turned back to the door, wanting to hear more about what his parents were fighting about. "Besides, what can it do? If it tries to attack the house, I'll kill it."</p>
<p>"Lyall..."</p>
<p>Another sound. Remus turned and felt even more afraid. He thought he'd feel better with his blankie so he began going back to his bed when a cool breeze stopped him. His window hadn't been open before. He tugged his blankie off his bed and went over to the window, climbing up onto the seat and looking out at the bright moonlight filtering through the trees. His eyes traveled downward then his small body stiffened when he saw something on the ground, in the yard. There was a big shape moving back and forth, and it frightened him.</p>
<p>He scrambled down off the windowseat to go tell his mama but when he turned there was a man in his room, standing so close that all Remus could really see were legs. He craned his neck back. Up, up, up, into the pale face of a stranger whose sharp teeth gleamed as he grinned. His arms darted out, blurring. Remus opened his mouth to scream but a cold hand was pressed hard against his mouth. He began thrashing in the arms of the stranger as the stranger picked him easily up off the floor with one hand, the other still holding back Remus's screams. The stranger's body and arms felt different, harder, colder. Almost like a statue than a person.</p>
<p><em>MAMA! PAPA!</em> Remus struggled as the stranger jumped onto the windowsill then jumped down. They were on the second floor and Remus thought they were going to hit the ground and splatter like the plum he once threw out his window. But the stranger landed in a crouch, still holding Remus who felt nothing more than a jolt.</p>
<p>"Got'm," the stranger hissed out, straightening up.</p>
<p>Remus wet himself as a huge monster stepped out of the shadow of a tree.</p>
<p>It was a wolf. A huge, hulking wolf with bared fangs, raised hackles, the moonlight showing every inch of its muscled body. It was <em>so</em> big, the fur ragged, the tail swishing back and forth. Almost wagging. Remus suddenly didn't care a stranger was holding him, he twisted around, trying to climb up onto the stranger but the stranger held him stiffly. He couldn't move except to kick his dangling legs, his pajamas damp with urine. He kicked the stranger hard in the belly though it seemed to have no effect.</p>
<p>"Want me to drop'm?" the stranger asked.</p>
<p>The wolf padded out to the middle of the yard The stranger followed, carrying Remus who began kicking harder, tears streaming down his face. Where was Mama and Papa? Why weren't they doing something?</p>
<p>The giant monster paused, looking right into Remus's eyes. He tried to scream again but the stranger kept his voice muffled.</p>
<p>The wolf looked up at the house then at the stranger, nodding. The stranger laughed as he threw Remus down onto the ground. He began sobbing loudly as pain filled his small body, having never experienced anything like this before. The wolf stepped closer. It was so big, its eyes were glowing, saliva dripping down as the lips curled back to show the long fangs. It growled, stinky hot breath washing across Remus's face as he sucked in some air then screamed as loudly as he could, his tiny voice filling the air. He was hurting too much to move though tried as the wolf was on top of him now. One paw came down on his leg, holding him even more still as he thrashed about, trying to get away. The weight against his thigh hurt so bad.</p>
<p>"Remus?! REMUS?!"</p>
<p>"DAAADDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Remus shrieked. He was vaguely aware of his father appearing at his bedroom window.</p>
<p>The wolf moved its mouth in a strange manner that almost looked like it was grinning in glee, teeth an inch from Remus's face now,</p>
<p>"That's right, Lupin! Watch!" the stranger laughed.</p>
<p>Then even worse pain filled Remus's body. His scream tore through the air as those long fangs sank into his arm. His body jerked, head smacking against the ground, back arching as the wolf tugged at his arm. His arm burned as everything started going grey and dim. The wolf lifted its head, picking Remus clear off the ground.</p>
<p>"NOOOO!" Lyall screamed, seeing his son dangling out of the wolf's mouth. He blasted a spell which the stranger deflected, then Lyall jumped out the window, using a spell to soften his landing. Hope was at the window, screaming, sobbing. Then she disappeared.</p>
<p>The wolf shook its head, and let go, Remus flying out, hitting the ground, a haze of pain blinding him. He lay on the ground, the world spinning around him, trying to figure out <em>what was happening</em>. The wolf bent its head in and Remus thought it would eat him but instead it gave the bleeding bite mark on his arm a great big slobbering lick, blood and drool splattering across his body. Remus gave out hoarse, shaky sobs. He didn't understand. He didn't understand why this was happening. The pain. The wolf. His child mind tried to find an answer but it just slipped away.</p>
<p>The stranger was laughing and then a bright light filled the yard as Lyall shot a spell once he landed.</p>
<p>"Enjoy your soulless son now, Lupin! Does he deserve death too?" There was a loud cracking sound, and the stranger Disapparated while the wolf took off towards the forest. Lyall ran after it, shooting spells, screaming obscenities.</p>
<p>Remus just stared at the sky, sobbing at the pain he was in, wondering why his parents hadn't stopped it yet. Then arms went around him. He tried to scream, thinking it was the stranger again, but it was his father.</p>
<p>He was crying, tears landing on Remus's face as he was carried inside. "Shit, shit, shit, shit." Remus wanted to tell his daddy to stop because mommy didn't like those sorts of words but all that came out when he opened his mouth was a wail.</p>
<p>Remus faded in and out as he was set on the dining room table. Lyall was sobbing, just clutching at him. His mother was crying, the sound of jars clinking as she brought healing potions in.</p>
<p>"Won't work, it won't work."</p>
<p>"He's bleeding to <em>death</em>! We have to do something waiting for the Ministry to come!"</p>
<p>"Ministry?! We can't call the Ministry! Hope, he's been BITTEN! They'll just KILL HIM!"</p>
<p>"Then I'll take care of it!"</p>
<p>"It bit him, it <em>bit</em> him!"</p>
<p>"Lyall, <em>move</em>!"</p>
<p>"He's going to become one of them..."</p>
<p>Cold goo slathered onto the bite. Remus began crying again as the world sharpened into focus then faded again.</p>
<p>"Shh, baby, it's okay," his mother whispered.</p>
<p>"He's gonna turn. He's gonna become one..."</p>
<p>"You're scaring him."</p>
<p>Bandages pressed down to try and stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>"Hope, you <em>don't understand</em>! HE WAS BIT!"</p>
<p>"I KNOW HE WAS BIT I CAN SEE HE WAS BIT NOW SHUT UP, LYALL!"</p>
<p>Remus began bawling as she screamed. She began hushing him again, then singing in a shaky voice to try and keep him calm as she worked.</p>
<p>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are grey..."</p>
<p>His mother's hand, stroking his temple.</p>
<p>"You'll never know, dear, how much I love you..."</p>
<p>Her voice broke as she sobbed the last few words, fingers sliding in her son's blood as his eyes fluttered shut.</p>
<p>"...please don't take my sunshine away..."</p>
