<p>“What do you mean I’m not brave in bed?” Harry demanded.</p>
<p>“I mean exactly what I said.” Draco leaned forward, admiring his reflection in the mirror. </p>
<p>“I’m a Gryffindor! I’m brave.” </p>
<p>“Maybe you are when fighting a battle,” Draco said, fluffing hid hair, “but you wouldn’t even let me tie you up for our anniversary. Doesn’t sound too brave to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m brave!” protested Harry. “What about the room of Requirement? I saved you!”</p>
<p>“Well, true.” Draco finally turned away from the mirror. “But that was only because you couldn’t bear the idea of losing me.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t love you then! I didn't even like you then.” </p>
<p>“Oh please. You have always loved me.” </p>
<p>“You are delusional.” </p>
<p>“Delusional, am I?” Draco smirked. “Then why did you see me when you looked in the mirror of Erised?”</p>
<p>“I knew I should never have told you that,” Harry said. </p>
<p>“Well,” Draco said, climbing up onto the bed. “You did, and that’s what’s important.” </p>
<p>“Do you dream about me? Harry asked, reaching for Draco’s face. “They say what what you see in the mittoe of eisued*, is what your heat desires.” </p>
<p>Draco smiled. “i saw myseld licing the lue** I wanted.”</p>
<p>“What, as the new Dark Lord?” Harry teased.</p>
<p>Draco froze. How had he guessed?</p>
<p>But Harry was laughing, and with that, Seaoc*** relaxed. “Don’t be silly.” He kissed Harry, moaning as their tongues entangled. “What good is it being a dark lord without you?”</p>
<p>“Together forever,” said Harry, banishing their clothes. And a they made love, Draco gave thanks that he found Harry.</p>
