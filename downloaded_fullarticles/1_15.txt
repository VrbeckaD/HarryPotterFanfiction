    <p>Remus lupin cries out on pain as his bones break one by one. He can feel every single one as they break and rebuild inside of him. There is no sound coming from his mouth though. No way for anyone to hear how much pain he is in. His fathers spells had worked yet again. Another wave of pain hits him and he crawls into a ball on the floor as he spasmically reaches for the metal rod that attaches to the wall and chains him in place. He needs something to hold on to. The rod is ice cold against his feverish skin. </p><p>"Reeeeeemuuuus". A voice cries out from the windowsill, where the moonlight flows through the cracks of the iron bars that cover the window. He claws his way to the darkest part of the basement, trying to hide in the shadows from his inevitable fate. He tries to shut her out by putting his hands over his ears, but her voice is soft as butter and glides through his fingers. <br/>"Reeeeeemuuuuuus, come out and play!" The moonlight stretches towards him and fills the room up entirely. <br/>"Mum!" He cries, but nothing comes out yet again. The shadow of a girl is shown in front of the gitter. </p><p>"It's time, Remus", the little girl snarls. And his hand starts to grow claws and hair. He's losing control of himself. The shadow transforms with him. And a paw reaches out through the gitter. As he fully transforms, his scream becomes a howl and the spell is broken. <br/>"Come with me, Remus!" The girl yells. He tugs on the chains and then rips the rod from the wall. It falls to the ground and his ears fill with sound. He's stunned for a moment, but the girl calls him again. He wants to leave with her, more than anything in the entire world, but he knows he shouldn't. There is a fight inside of him, between Remus and the werewolf. They are two separate minds sharing one body. But Remus is not in control of his body, he can only watch as he breaks his chains and then destroys the window. He hears the door unlock from the outside of his prison and his father shouting his name, but he is uncapable of responding. He can only run. </p><p>His legs take him far away from the house. The moon shines brightly from above, leaving him almost blinded. He uses his nose and ears for navigation as he sprints into the dark forest that surrounds their house. At first he is all alone, but then a white wolf runs up next to him. It looks like it is glowing in the light from the moonlight. </p><p>"You made it out! I'm so proud of you, my son!" It is the same voice from before. She sounds happy now. And Remus thinks he could get used to this freedom. <br/>"Now i need you to hunt". Her glee becomes a growl and she shows off a perfect row of pearl white teeth. Remus feels his stomach turning. Like he's grinding stone against stone. He was starving. And in his hunger, he slipped further into madness, into a beast. His senses heightened and he could hear the thunder of a heart beating rapidly and blood flowing through a body. Warm, tasty, delicious blood... no, he had to stop. He couldn't kill anything. He shouldn't kill anything.</p><p>"Find it, feast on fresh, warm meat". Her whispers were like mermaid song in his ears. He couldn't resist it. So again he leapt forward, trying to find this innocent creature so he could stop feeling so empty. And just as he entered a clearing, he saw it. A rabbit, figting to get out of a trap. His mouth is watering as he slowly circles his pray, making the circle smaller and smaller.<br/>"Stupefy!" Someone yells and he is trapped for a second. Enough time for them to tie him up with chains, this time his whole body is covered so he won't get out. He snarls and fights as he falls to the ground. The white wolf quickly disappears into the shadows of the night.</p>
