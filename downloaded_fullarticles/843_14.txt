<p>He couldn’t remember who had suggested the game of hide and seek, but the eighth years had jumped on it with glee. He did remember the look on Draco’s face when he was chosen to be the finder though and it made him smile. </p>
<p>The next second, he found himself being tackled to the ground. He gave a muffled cry of surprise, then found himself looking up into Draco’s grey eyes. </p>
<p>“Found you,” Draco replied with a smirk. </p>
<p>“Did you have to sit on me?” Harry asked, though he wasn’t really bothered. </p>

<p>“Stay still for what?”</p>
