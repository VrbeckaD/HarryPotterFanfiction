          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Oh come now, Minerva," Rolanda taunts quietly, leaning in closer to the other woman's back. "I thought you were a <i>Gryffindor</i>."</p><p>Minerva huffs out a breath and glares over her shoulder before taking the broomstick firmly in her hand. "Don't be ridiculous, Rolanda. You can't goad me into this."</p><p>Slinging her own leg over the school broom and wrapping one arm around Minerva's waist, Hooch grins. "You sure about that?"</p><p>With another dark grumble, Minerva kicks off from the ground. Her knuckles are white and her breath is short.</p><p>Leaning into her, Rolanda worms her free hand into Minerva's robes, laughing softly as the tension in the other woman's body increases - this time for a far better reason.</p><p>"I didn't think that was appropriate for flying--" Minerva breaks off in a loud moan and Rolanda tightens her own legs around the broom, keeping them level and steady even as the woman in her arms loses her grip on reality.</p><p>Afterwards, flying in lazy arcs over the Forbidden Forest, Minerva suggests they swap places.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the wrong moment, they bank. Adrenaline is a nice spice to orgasm, Rolanda discovers.</p><p>They avoid crashing, but only due to luck rather than skill.</p></div>
