    <p>Chapter 1: They're at it Again!</p><p> </p><p>Draco opens the shades on their dorm window quite dramatically, for the soul purpose of waking up a very sleepy Gryffindor. He had turned from his old-school days of being way up in the mornings in their summer months to sleeping in again, ever since they came back to Winsdale on Saturday. Harry opened his eyes belatedly from his position on his bed and rubbed under his eye before sitting up on his arse. "Do you <em>mind?" </em>Harry exclaimed, letting the covers slide down to reveal Draco's robe still rolled around him. It was quite chilly yesterday night, and this morning was a big contrast. Harry hated warm weather, but Draco loved the 70 degrees it currently was in late August.</p><p>"Not really." Draco responded, muttering an summoning spell on his robe. The robe quickly unfurled itself and flew into Draco's waiting hand. Harry blinked from the sudden loss but wasn't that surprised. He was a Auror now, after all. "We have to go to class." Harry had entirely new courses this year. He was taking a part-time internship with a DADA teacher from France, so he'd be there instead of Auror training. Everyone else had already graduated. Draco, however, was in the same classes as always, just another year ahead. He was taking money management classes so he could deal with the rest of the money still in the Malfoy Bank.</p><p>When he wasn't doing their cruddy homework, he was now in apprenticeship at the same job he was interning for before. He was going to be making little money, and a lot of business partners, so he couldn't complain. At least his ideas would be put to actual work now. Harry was mulling over his socks when Draco snapped out of his trance from the window. Their favorite field was the view, where Harry often spent his off days playing Quidditch with his Potter troupe. He turned away completely to do a ironing spell on his poor robe, then neatly hanged it inside his dresser. Harry had managed to get his whole outfit on without complaint, and they were finally ready when Draco had finished showering and dressing.</p><p>"I need a coffee." Harry moaned, pulling at his hair that had managed to get knotted after showering at night instead of the morning. Draco unknotted it for him with a drag of his wand and tugged on Harry's arm. "Okay, but hurry up. We're going to be late." Harry mumbled after him, but Draco managed to shut him with a black coffee while Draco got himself a nice tea. "Want a biscuit?" Harry asked, putting a lot of sugar cubes into the coffee that wasn't necessary. Draco scowled at the sad display of biscuits and muffins that were left over by morning rush. Draco really wished he had woke Harry up earlier. "Sure." He answered anyways, and grabbed two for him and Harry.</p><p>Harry took it from him when he secured the mug and munched on it with his mouth wide. Draco cringed and ate a bit out of it, purposely being as polite as possible to get a response out of Harry. Harry glared at him and sadly pulled it out of his mouth before he could finish eating it like a Weasley. "Yeah yeah. I'm tired, okay?" Harry whined. Draco rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around Harry, grateful for the hallways being mostly empty. "You shouldn't have spent the night reading and eating George's new fire-crisps, then." George's shop had tripled in business ever since the Universal Championships, and many renovations saw that it was booming in popularity. George's sanity, however, remained to be seen.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~.~.~.~.~.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">After watching over Professor Arpin's demonstrations as class time, Harry had to say he was pretty exhausted. Draco was meeting him in the dorm's kitchen, so at least he could get another coffee before he collapsed. He still had to do homework, which meant either a trip to the library or the study room, because Draco refused for Harry to fall asleep while he was supposed to be working in their dorm. Finally reaching the kitchen, Harry looked on in shock as Draco stood talking to Ron, looking as comfortable as ever, not like they spent all their childhood hating each other. Harry wasn't sure whether to laugh or to keep his mouth hanging open. Draco amazed him sometimes.</p><p align="left">"Harry!" Draco spotted him by the door and waved to him. Ron winked as he trampled over, trying not to look suspicious. Draco thankfully was preoccupied by getting his tea the way he liked it, taking a counter space that could've been used by the grouchy-looking people behind them. Ron, however, knew Harry better, and snickered as Harry came up. "How was first day of class, mate?" Ron asked. Ron had been in Auror training with Harry as well, and it was sad that these upcoming years would be spent in different classes than each other. Ron was studying to be in business like George, and Harry wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in some of the same classes as Draco.</p><p align="left">"It was alright. The professor's a right twist in the crotch, but that's just because he doesn't recognize me." Harry joked, and Ron laughed as Harry took a mug from the stack before the duo behind them could yell at them to hurry up. "Oh, poor Harry, how dare that teacher not know the great Harry Potter." Draco mocked, smirking as he sipped out of his cuppa. Harry couldn't help but smile at Draco's ragged face. He already had a five o'clock shadow, and Harry hesitated to tell him. Draco never let a beard ever grow, probably because Lucius was now growing one in prison. "And you're smiling. Merlin, Potter, you have a big ego." Draco groaned. Ron yelled out "Oi!" as they slowly moved away from the kitchen counter.</p><p align="left">"I'm just smiling at my pretty boyfriend. What's so egotistical about that?" Harry snipped back, taking his own drink out of his coffee. Ron made a face at the obvious flirt and moved to stand between Harry and Draco, least they start kissing in front of him. Harry snorted. Ron was <em>so</em> obvious. Draco hid his blush with his cuppa. "Nothing, I guess." Draco answered, fiddling with his mug in order to distract himself. Harry grinned and decided to give him a break. He turned to Ron, who looked like he wanted to throw up. "Ron, how's George?" He asked. George had been going in and out of rational thought throughout the years since Fred had died.</p><p align="left">"He's actually really good." At Harry's shocked face, Ron elaborated. "I mean, you know how Snape and a bunch of others got portraits at Hogwarts, right?" Ron asked. Draco looked up from his mug, faintly interested. "Yeah. Wait. You mean..." Harry asked, bemused. "Fred got one painted. He's there, Harry. And Fred has been visiting him." This complicated Harry's emotions. On one thing, it was great that George was getting closure. But it was another that if the visits kept happening, he could go as bat-crazy as someone looking into the Mirror. Draco, thinking the same thing as Harry, gulped. "So, studying in the library or in the common room?" Draco asked.</p><p align="left"> </p><p> </p>
