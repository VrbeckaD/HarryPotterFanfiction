          <div class="userstuff"><p>“What the hell happened to you?” Ron asked when Harry showed up for their weekend Quidditch game.</p>
<p>Harry grimaced and walked right past him towards Ginny and George’s team. Ron stared after him, at the odd circular marks on his arms and any other skin showing.</p>
<p>Draco arrived not long after, whistling and sipping from a travel mug.</p>
<p>“You’re in a good mood,” Ron said, mind still on Harry, wondering if he was okay.</p>
<p>“Fantastic!” Draco said cheerily. “Learned a new spell last night!”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Ron asked distractedly. He supposed he was stuck with Draco as seeker on his team then if Harry was in a mood.</p>
<p>Draco hummed. “How to summon and control tentacles. Brilliant piece of spellwork.”</p>
<p>“Why would you want to…” Ron looked over at the circles on Harry’s skin and then grimaced. “I hate you.You absolute wanker! Why would you tell me that?”</p>
<p>Draco winked at him. “Better watch out, your wife got her research face on when I told her.”</p>
<p>“She WHAT?”</p></div>
