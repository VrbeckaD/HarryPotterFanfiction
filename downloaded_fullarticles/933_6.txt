    <p>Tom maintained an air of attentiveness, never once showing boredom or annoyance as Abraxas droned on about this or that while being supported by Yaxley and Carrow.</p><p>His mask was perfectly in place along with his ever present disarming smile as he chatted back to his classmates/followers. And even with Dumbledore's eyes drilling a hole into his head, he remained composed and aloof.</p><p>Try as he might, Dumbledore will never live to see the day that Tom lost his composure. If he did then Tom wasn't as good as he thought he was and if it was one thing he always strived for, it was perfection.</p><p>So with that thought in mind, he ignored Dumbledore's piercing gaze to continue chatting to his followers, knowing that his mask might flatter if he looked at the Transfiguration Professor.</p><p>There was no need for Dumbledore to see the absolute loathing he had for him on his face even if the old man knew it already.</p><p>It was vastly different to know something rather than see it.</p><p>And unfortunately, his mask was almost shattered when the doors to the Great Hall opened to receive two unexpected guests.</p><p>Immediately, whispers filled the hall as everyone turned as one to stare at the two people looking at them with visible frowns on their faces.</p><p>It was quite obvious that they didn't belong to the current population at Hogwarts which was why as Dippet stood up to no doubt inquire about their presence, he was interrupted by an excited shout of "Daddy!" as the child standing next to the unknown man took off into a run towards the Slytherin table where Tom had to abruptly stand up knowing his son's penchant for jumping.</p><p>And as expected, the child barreled over the table filled to the brim with food and into Tom's awaiting arms, luckily not face-planting into said food.</p><p>Tom sighed as the whispers heightened, knowing that his mask was now well and truly down as his son yammered on about the past few months that he had spent with his mother while pressing kisses all over his face between each sentence.</p><p><em>'Harry coddles him too damn much,'</em> he couldn't help but think in annoyance.</p><p>Instead of being raised as a Pureblood's Heir, Theoren was obviously being handled with a loving and carefree hand instead of strict and firm.</p><p>He and Harry would have some words later, but in the meantime, his eyes stayed locked on his Husband who was fast approaching the Slytherin table with eager steps, a look of unhidden love and delight in his eyes as he stared back at Tom with a wide grin on his face.</p><p>Theoren pulled back and turned to look at his mother with a matching grin on his face. "Mommy, Daddy is taller now!"</p><p>Harry snorted as he walked around the table and up to Tom, ignoring the looks of shock and disbelief being sent his way as he embraced his husband with Theoren between them; he then leaned forward and pressed his lips against Tom, sighing softly in relief at the familiar pressure.</p><p>It had been months since he had last been touched so feeling Tom again, even if it was just kissing was amazing.</p><p>The kiss lasted for a good minute before they pulled back only for Harry to hug him as tightly as he could while Theoren giggled.</p><p>Tom couldn't even muster the energy to be angry at Harry for the PDA even if his reputation of being unattached and aloof was now in shambles.</p><p>"Missed you so much, Love," Harry muttered against his neck. "So, so much."</p><p>Tom sighed and returned the hug with one arm. "I missed you too, Harrison."</p><p>And even knowing that he was going to severely regret it, Tom chanced a look up at the Head Table and couldn't help gritting his teeth when he saw the broad grin on Dumbledore's face which grew even more as he saw Tom's look of annoyance.</p><p>"Who the hell are you?!" screeched a very familiar voice.</p><p>Tom groaned as Harry immediately pulled back, knowing better than to intervene as Harry thrived on humiliating others, especially when it comes to him.</p><p>"I should be asking you instead seeing as you're the one being rude," was his calm retort as he raised an eyebrow at the girl stomping towards him.</p><p>Said girl snarled and brandished her Wand at him. "My name is Bellatrix Black! Now who are you and why are you touching Tom?!"</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes at her, not even bothering to pull out his own Wand. "Not that it's any of your business, but I believe that I deserve the right to hug my own Husband, wouldn't you say so?"</p><p>At his admissions, gasps of shock and disbelief rang out and he delighted in the looks of jealousy being sent his way.</p><p>"Also, my name is Harrison Peverell-Riddle, pleasure to meet you cousin." He grinned as the girl abruptly stopped in her tracks to stare at him wide-eyed.</p><p>"W-What?"</p><p>Great. Just great. It seemed like Harry's arrival was destroying everybody's masks, but then again, Bellatrix was known to be a head case, so no one would really care about her mask as they did Tom's.</p><p>"You head me. Although we had never been introduced, we are third cousins I believe."</p><p>Bellatrix frowned. "You're a Peverell? How?"</p><p>Oh, so that was what she was focused on. Tom honestly couldn't fault her because the Peverell line was said to be dead and It had been the same thing he had thought when he first met Harry.</p><p>"That is correct. By blood, of course." He shrugged noncommittally then turned to look back at Tom. "Anyway, come honey. Let's go spend some time together since it's the weekend and all. I already sent a letter to the Headmaster so Theoren and I will be staying for two days."</p><p>Tom grunted and allowed his Husband to lead him out of the Great Hall with Theoren in his arms amidst fierce whispers from the population including the Professors.</p><p>His mask of indifference was blown to shit already, so he might as well spend time with his family while fucking Harry once Theoren went to bed.</p><p>He hadn't cum in months seeing as he was beneath touching himself, so Harry would feel the full brunt of Tom's pent up desires until it was time to leave.</p><p>It was his fault that Tom lost composure so his arse was gonna take a good pounding today if he had anything to say about it.</p><p>"But, Mommy!" Theoren whined. "I want chicken, mash po'ato, las'na, juice, maca-"</p><p>Tom groaned.</p><p>This is what he got for lusting after the only Peverell Heir.</p>
