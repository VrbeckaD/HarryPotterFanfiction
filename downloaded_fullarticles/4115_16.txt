    <p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">It starts as a bout of horniness, easily satiated by masturbation. Hermione does not question why the lust comes on, blaming the hormonal changes of her menstrual cycle. Her fingers, some candlelight, and a couple of romance novels do the trick.</p><p class="p1">There is nothing to worry about.</p><p class="p1">But then, suddenly there is. There <em>is </em>something to worry about. </p><p class="p1">Because it grows, this lust, from an itch she must scratch to something wild and frightening. </p><p class="p1">She's sitting at her desk at the Ministry of Magic when it hits her: making her heart hammer, her clit pulse. She sweats profusely and grips the armrests of her chair, overcome with the sudden impulse to fuck any and every man sitting within a ten foot radius of her. They all look like viable sexual partners, which is insane, 'cuz Wellheart is a married man with little hair and a beer belly and Collins is a grandfather in his eighties. Griffin Abbott she’s maybe considered once or twice, but gods damn it, <em>no</em>, she cannot just <em>proposition somebody she works with—</em></p><p class="p1">The heat does not fade over the next day, so she sees a couple of healers about it. They aren’t half as alarmed by the condition as she is; they prescribe calming draughts, which are expensive to both buy and to brew, and various tonics intended to keep her level-headed. The tonics don’t do a thing, and though the calming draughts do take the edge off, the underlying need to fuck remains, present and alive, consuming her every waking thought, distressing her, making her cry…</p><p class="p1">She takes three days off work to hide from the world. (To masturbate.) To consult Muggle sex therapists and texts on sexual desire and addiction. (To masturbate.)</p><p class="p1">But neither therapists nor books offer any answers. Masturbation barely even helps, because her lust runs beyond the simple need to achieve orgasm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She needs penetration, a nice and thick cock to just <em>destroy</em> her, ropes of cum to coat her cunt…</p><p class="p1">Pity she and Ron had broken up a couple of months ago. After almost two years of dating, they had split, and for good reason (ie., jealousy and all its baggage). But, at the least, if he were here he could fill this <em>need</em>.</p><p class="p1">But he’s “on sabbatical” with Harry somewhere in the Alps, seeking closure and inner peace, so Hermione must consider the other men in her life. She’s well aware that very few would object to her invitation (to fuck the shit out of me, right now, I need it, <em>please), b</em>ut she’s also aware that booty calls have repercussions, and she’s never really been into one-night-stands anyway.</p><p class="p1">Day five of her heat inspires another visit to a healer. This time she seeks a second opinion not at St. Mungo’s but somewhere a little less reputable, a little more open-minded.</p><p class="p1">Hermione turns down a musty, narrow lane of Knockturn Alley, the hood of her cloak drawn close to her head. She approaches The Spiny Serpent, a drab gray-colored building with an inconspicuous storefront. With her gaze trained on the Speakeasy-style door viewer, she knocks.</p><p class="p1">The door viewer slides open. Purple eyes glare down at her.</p><p class="p1">“Password?”</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s2"><em>Aesculapius</em></span> <em>vivat</em>,” she mutters.</p><p class="p2">The wooden door creaks open slowly. Hermione pushes through and steps into probably the shadiest clinic that’s ever existed. Only one gas lamp hangs from the ceiling, and the walls are lined entirely with shelves that feature old books, jars of animal hearts, and rusted metal instruments, the purposes of which Hermione doesn’t dare imagine.</p><p class="p2">“Miss Granger,” a silky voice whispers from behind a black velvet curtain at the back of the store. “Back so soon?”</p><p class="p2">Hermione gnaws on her lower lip, shame flushing her face red. She had been in the Spiny Serpent not too long ago, seeking the embalmed liver of a <em>very</em> rare creature. The potion that had called for such an ingredient had not proved to be successful; however, in her interactions with the proprietor of The Spiny Serpent, she had learned that he was a master of mystic diseases and afflictions.</p><p class="p2">“Did the Wrath of Echinacea not work out?” the proprietor asks.</p><p class="p2">“Actually, I’ve come for a more personal consult.” She sweeps the velvet curtain aside. “If you please.”</p><p class="p2">The proprietor is a bald old man with a hunched back. His face is lined with wrinkles and age spots, but his hands are eerily white and smooth. His purple eyes flash when they meet hers. “Certainly. Come, come.” He gestures for her to sit down on an old, squeaky gurney.</p><p class="p2">She does.</p><p class="p2">He asks her for what reason she needs his help today.</p><p class="p2">She tells him.</p><p class="p2">He laughs, a wheezing sort of noise. “Oh dear, oh dear. That sounds awful.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione scowls. “You have no idea.”</p><p class="p2">“I have an inkling as to what this may be, but first I’ll need to do a bit of inspecting.” He summons a magnifying glass to his hand.</p><p class="p2">Hermione raises her eyebrows. “Fine. But I’m not removing any more clothing than clinically and medically necessary.”</p><p class="p2">“You need not worry, dear.” The old man grins, his teeth yellow and sharp. “I simply need to look upon your lower back.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione shudders to raise her shirt for this creepy old man, but she does it all the same. She would do anything to cure herself of this great and terrible lust. She can’t live this way forever...she just <em>can’t</em>.</p><p class="p2">“Hm. Just as I thought.” The old man touches a spot at the base of her spine. “You have been marked for a very rare condition. A very rare condition indeed.”</p><p class="p2">Her heart races. “What is it?”</p><p class="p2">“You, Miss Granger, have been marked to be an Alpha.”</p><p class="p2">“An Alpha?” Her mind buzzes at the familiarity of the concept. “You mean…like somebody who leads a werewolf pack?”</p><p class="p2">“No. It’s far more mystical than that.” The old man steps back and pulls Hermione to her feet. He guides her to a standing mirror at the front of the store.</p><p class="p2">“See for yourself.” He hands her the magnifying glass.</p><p class="p2">Hermione lifts the back of her shirt and twists until she can see the mark. Indeed, there’s a small, white patch of discoloration right at the base of her spine, where the muscles of her bottom begin. She passes the magnifying glass over the mark, and it becomes apparent that the mark is shaped like the Greek letter for Alpha.</p><p class="p2">“I still don’t understand,” she whispers. “What does it mean?”</p><p class="p2">“It means that you are in heat and will always be in heat, until you find your other half. The only person who can satisfy you. Your Omega.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione stills and drops her shirt. “Are you telling me that there’s no end to this lust?”</p><p class="p2">“Not until you are well and truly satisfied by your Omega.”</p><p class="p2">She closes her eyes, the healer’s words sinking in. “I—don’t—believe you,” she sputters. “This kind of stuff is myth, is <em>fiction!</em> There’s never been proof that this happens in reality—“</p><p class="p2">The healer sweeps over to a bookshelf, begins to pull out dusty, ancient-looking tomes. “There are texts for you to examine yourself, if you wish.” He drops the books onto a small writing desk. “Firsthand accounts from history, records of the devastation of this lust.” He grins. “Or have you forgotten Caligula? Genghis Khan? The likes of Marquis de Sade and Elizabeth Bathory? The lust of powerful Alphas have wreaked havoc upon humanity from the beginning of time.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione stumbles toward the books. The calming draught she had taken right before she’d Floo’d into Knockturn Alley has done little to soothe the pulsing of her clitoris. It aches now, sweetly.</p><p class="p2">“One could argue they were just psychopaths. What other proof do you have?” she asks through gritted teeth, flipping open the first book she sees. Its pages are stiff, the words handwritten in old English. The first line she can comprehend states that “<em>This lust is magnitudinous. With every breath, I am becoming less myself and more a monster.</em>”</p><p class="p2">“The proof is in the fact that you have that mark, Miss Granger. By the looks of it, it is new, your condition likely triggered by some major change in your life.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione swallows, thinking about her break-up with Ron. “Well, what else do I need to know then? Tell me.”</p><p class="p2">The healer shrugs. “You will simply have to find your Omega. Sexual intercourse with your mate is the only known cure for this lust.” He disappears behind the velvet curtain again. “Just be glad you yourself are not an Omega, Miss Granger. For as terrible as this lust is for you, it’s doubly worse for your mate.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione follows him back behind the curtain. “How so?”</p><p class="p2">“Omegas never fulfilled by their Alphas become frightened, vulnerable little things. Their fears consume them, spiral them into depression. Or madness. They become obsessed with the idea that they are alone. That they don’t deserve happiness. That they must find other ways to satisfy the hunger within them…”</p><p class="p2">Hermione clenches her fists. It’s strange that she feels physical pain hearing those things about some—no, <em>her</em> unknown Omega, out there in the world, miserable and alone. <em>Come for me</em>, flits across her brain in a voice she doesn’t recognize. <em>Please.</em></p><p class="p2">“How do I find my Omega?” she begs the healer. “Surely you can tell me that much.”</p><p class="p2">He shakes his head. “I honestly don’t know. What is meant to be will be.”</p><p class="p2">Hermione wipes at the sweat beading on her brow, at the tears building on the corner of her eyes. “Well, can you at least tell me how to manage this lust?”</p><p class="p2">He gives her a list of ingredients for an extra-powerful calming drought, selling her some of the required materials at a discount. His face is remorseful. “This is not a prognosis I like to give. And I’ve only given it once before.”</p><p class="p2">“To whom?” Hermione asks.</p><p class="p2">“Patient-provider privacy laws and all that Miss Granger.” He smiles. “I can’t tell you.”</p><p class="p2">She groans, frustrated. “Can I at least borrow some of your books about this Alpha and Omega nonsense?”</p><p class="p2">“Certainly. Take as many as you like.” He gathers an armful of the texts he had pulled from the shelves and shoves them into her arms.</p><p class="p2">Hermione staggers under their weight. “Thank you,” she says. “Maybe…maybe I can glean something from them.”</p><p class="p2">The healer’s voice is grave when he says, “Here’s hoping that you do, Miss Granger.”</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">And she does. Kind of. She learns that the relationship between an Alpha and an Omega is akin to that of soulmates, but where soulmates may have platonic relationships, Alphas and Omegas are destined for sexual reciprocity.</p><p class="p2">And also for breeding.</p><p class="p2">Indeed, the old English diary, which belonged to a male Alpha living in the 1500s, goes into great detail about the breeding instinct. About the satisfaction of fucking his Omega on the daily, of drenching her womb with his seed.</p><p class="p2">He goes into something called “knotting,” as well: the process of inseminating his mate for minutes and minutes on end, his genitalia physically unable to separate from hers until he unloads his come entirely.</p><p class="p2">Hermione shivers reading this. His accounts are filthy, and they only stoke her hunger. She must find her Omega, she vows, although it’s unclear to what ends of the Earth she will have to travel to achieve this.</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">As fate would have it, however, Hermione doesn’t have to travel far, or much at all.</p><p class="p2">Two weeks after her heat starts, on the brink of her twenty-first birthday, she is brought to her Omega. Quite randomly, at that, and not by her own doing.</p><p class="p2">One second she’s walking down a corridor at the Ministry of Magic, and in the next second she’s falling and landing face first onto an open book.</p><p class="p2">On a bed. One with a deep green duvet and stark white sheets. On the bedframe hangs a deep green curtain; a quick glance at the space confirms that this is the room of a Slytherin student. A Head student, to be specific, given that there are no other beds in the dorm and that there’s a door to a private bathroom.</p><p class="p2">Hermione steps carefully off the bed and grabs the book, which is leather bound and probably a diary of some kind. The pages, however, offer up no information. They are conspicuously blank.</p><p class="p2">She sets it back onto the bed and breathes, attempting to think, Hermione, <em>think</em>. <em>You’re back at Hogwarts. You’re in a Slytherin’s bedroom. Someone must have summoned you. </em></p><p class="p2">And likely by mistake. A spell gone wrong; that happens a lot at Hogwarts.</p><p class="p2">Still, it’d be strange for her to emerge all of a sudden from the bedroom of a student. And additional snooping around confirms that this is the bedroom of a <em>male</em> student.</p><p class="p2">McGonagall would have stern words about the appropriateness of all this.</p><p class="p2">So Hermione casts a Disillusionment charm on herself before exiting the room. She steps quietly down the white marble staircase into the Slytherin common room. To her relief, there are no students milling about. A glance at the stately grandfather clock on the far side of the room tells her it’s dinner time.</p><p class="p2">She leaves the common room and slips into the corridor outside. A few students pass and stare curiously at the common room door opening and closing seemingly by itself.</p><p class="p2">Hermione casts a quick <em>muffliato</em> to disguise the clicking of her high heels. <em>Gods damn the Ministry’s sexist dress code. </em></p><p class="p2">She powers through the dungeons, into the main castle. Her first instinct is simply to leave, but if a student is practicing a rather dangerous summoning charm, McGonagall ought to know.</p><p class="p2">It is only standing outside the Headmaster’s office, however, that Hermione notices something off about Hogwarts.</p><p class="p2">The tower's limestone walls, for one, look old. Worn. Very much unlike the new stones that had been installed following the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p class="p2">Hermione stares at the gargoyle guarding the steps. It too looks very much <em>old</em>. Like it had never been replaced after being blown apart during the fight.</p><p class="p2">Had she…had she been thrown back into time? It’s the only explanation for why the building is the way it is.</p><p class="p2">Hermione rushes down the second-floor staircase and into an empty classroom on the first-floor. She lifts the Disillusionment charm and transfigures her work robes into a generic, house-less Hogwart’s uniform, her high heels into a pair of Oxfords. She pulls a hair tie from the beaded bag she still carries out of habit and attempts to wrangle her hair into a bun.</p><p class="p2">It’s a futile effort given the sheer volume of hair she must contend with; she settles for a messy ponytail that’s more bird’s nest than hairstyle.</p><p class="p2">She contemplates magically altering her features to disguise her face, but ultimately decides against it. For all she knows, she could be further back in time than when she herself had attended Hogwarts.</p><p class="p2">But what if she isn’t? Words of warning flash across her mind: <em>awful things happen to those who meddle with time.</em> And if her past-self were to accidentally encounter her present-self, she would go <em>mad.</em></p><p class="p2">She has to know when she is, she <em>needs to know</em>—she darts out of the classroom and ambushes an unsuspecting first-year Slytherin boy, whose chubby cheeks flush red at her sudden appearance.</p><p class="p2">“Excuse me,” she asks, her voice falsely cheerful. “Can you tell me what day it is?”</p><p class="p2">“Um…September 2<span class="s4"><sup>nd</sup></span>…?”</p><p class="p2">“Yes, but what year?”</p><p class="p2">The boy blinks, confused. “Nineteen forty-four, of course.”</p><p class="p2">Panic rises in Hermione. A hysterical laugh escapes her. “Oh. Great. Thank you!” she squawks.</p><p class="p2">The boy scurries away, and Hermione slumps against the wall, her legs refusing to work.</p><p class="p2">“1944…” Bullocks. <em>Bullocks.</em> Her mind races with attempts to recall this year in history, but she’s too overcome to remember much. Grindelwald alive…Dippet headmaster of the school…Dumbledore—</p><p class="p2">“Dumbledore!”</p><p class="p2">He’s here. He has to be here, she thinks, forcing herself to stand on wobbly legs. <em>He’ll have answers, a solution, a way out…</em></p><p class="p2">But her legs <em>really</em> don’t want to work. Hermione slumps back against the wall, slides onto the floor. There is relief in knowing that she can’t run into herself, but it’s not enough to make up for the fact that she’s <em>trapped in the past</em>.</p><p class="p2">And hadn’t—hadn’t Lord Voldemort gone to Hogwarts at this time?</p><p class="p2">Another hysterical laugh bubbles in her throat. Hermione squeezes her eyes shut and decides that she must be logical, given that cooler heads prevail and all that. She’ll simply assimilate until she’s thrown back into the future...or until she <em>finds</em> a way back. Yes, yes…surely there will be books with such wisdom in the library. She will pretend to be a student here; she’ll comb through the texts until she finds an answer.</p><p class="p2">Her reverie is broken suddenly by her lust rearing its head again. <em>Fuck.</em> The calming draught prescribed by the healer at The Spiny Serpent had reduced it to a manageable, low simmer over the past couple of weeks.</p><p class="p2">But the lust returns now with a vengeance.</p><p class="p2">Her head spins, her heart thumps. Her throat is dry as she groans; her clit aches so sweetly, and she’s dying to touch herself, n<em>ow. </em></p><p class="p2">It’s hardly helping that a very delicious scent is wafting down the corridor. It’s heady and full-bodied, like the scent of earth after rain, the pages of a book fresh off the press, and bedsheets after sex—</p><p class="p2">“Excuse me, miss.”</p><p class="p2">She turns her head toward the sound of a smooth, masculine voice echoing down the corridor. “Might I ask your name?” he says.</p><p class="p2">Hermione struggles to her feet again. It’s as if every cell in her body is vibrating. Singing. “Hermione Gran—Grainville,” she says lamely. Her hands ball into fists as she squints down the corridor at a tall, dark-haired student standing there. Not approaching her.</p><p class="p2">“Are you lost, Miss Grainville?”</p><p class="p2">“No.” She plasters a smile onto her face, her left eye starting to twitch. “I mean yes. I am. Lost. On the way to—“ She inhales sharply, forcing her thighs together to alleviate the <em>itch,</em> the <em>need</em>. “T-To Dumbledore’s o-office. If you could. Point me there.”</p><p class="p2">A few beats of silence. “Are you not well?” the student asks.</p><p class="p2">Hermione inches toward him shakily. “I’m okay.” She lets out a groan as that <em>scent</em> hits her anew. “O-On second thought—could you point me to the—ladies’ room—“</p><p class="p2">“I certainly could,” he drawls. “But first tell me why you need to see Professor Dumbledore.”</p><p class="p2">“It’s kind of an emergency,” she exhales. “So if you could just—just—“</p><p class="p2">It happens then, on September 2, 1944.</p><p class="p2">The full consumption of Hermione Granger.</p><p class="p2">That’s what it’s called anyway, when an Alpha meets her Omega for the first time.</p><p class="p2">When an Alpha is gripped so furiously by the need to <em>mate</em> that she loses herself, her thoughts, her fears, her mind.</p><p class="p2">When all she can concentrate on is the fact that he’s standing right there, and he has everything she needs to be whole.</p><p class="p2">She stalks toward this unknown student: tall, dark, and handsome to the point of being beautiful, the weakness in her legs gone, her stride full of purpose.</p><p class="p2">As she draws closer to him, his gray eyes dilate to black; his mouth falls open. “Do I know you?” he asks.</p><p class="p2">Hermione doesn’t bother answering. It’s a silly question, given that oh, he will know her. He will know her very well.</p><p class="p2">She stands on tiptoe and rakes her hands through his luscious, black hair. He tenses immediately at her touch, and then just as quickly, he relaxes. He goes docile in her grip, allowing her to draw his head down, to bring his neck closer to her lips.</p><p class="p2">She breathes him in. He smells like clean laundry, an entire forest. She nuzzles and nips at the soft, pale skin of his neck.</p><p class="p2">He whines.</p><p class="p2">“What—are you doing to me?” he gasps.</p><p class="p2">“Mine,” Hermione moans. She presses him down onto his knees, sinking to her own. “You’re mine,” she hisses, yanking at the clasps of his robes, reaching underneath his sweater, his shirt to palm at the taut skin of his abdomen.</p><p class="p2">He whimpers at her touch. “Who are you?” he breathes.</p><p class="p2">“Somebody very, <em>very</em> important to you.” She presses kisses along his jaw. And she can sense him fighting it—his lust—and thereby fighting <em>her</em>—his <em>master—</em></p><p class="p2">“Don’t fight it.” She kisses the outer shell of his ear, tongues the soft flesh of his earlobe. “You’re <em>mine.”</em></p><p class="p2">“You—keep saying that.” His whole body tenses. “But I don’t belong to anyone. Much less—to a common <em>whore—</em>”</p><p class="p2">She shoves him onto his back, straddling him. “I’m not a whore.” She ruts against the growing bulge at the front of his trousers. <em>Gods, </em>that feels <em>soooooo</em> good.</p><p class="p2">“I’m your mate.” She rolls her already wet, panty-clad cunt against him again. “<em>Fuck, </em>you feel amazing, baby.” She leans in to lick his plush bottom lip. "I can't wait for you to fuck me <em>raw</em>."</p><p class="p2">He sighs desperately, bucking upward to meet her rutting, but then as though catching himself halfway, he stops and growls, low in his throat. “For whatever you’ve hexed me with, you bitch, I will have you <em>thrown</em> into <em>Azkaban</em>—“</p><p class="p2">She smiles against his cheek. "You wouldn't." </p><p class="p2">"I <em>would—"</em></p><p class="p2">“Get <em>off</em> him, slut!” a shrill voice screams distantly. Hermione looks up just in time to see a jet of red light speed toward her.</p><p class="p2">It hits her right in the chest and blasts her down the corridor, straight into a wall. The back of her head smacks against the stone; as she struggles to remain conscious, she spies a dark haired girl bend over <em>her Omega</em>, and right before she passes out, Hermione’s last thoughts are of rage.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p>
