          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1"><b></b>Eventually the Hogwarts Express pulls <span class="s1">to</span> its final stop<span class="s1">.</span> <span class="s1">T</span>he students gather their belongings and familiars before disembarking in a disorganised fashion into the brisk Scottish evening.</p><p class="p2">Luna offers Harry some help carrying a second owl cage off the train. They carry their things <span class="s1">along</span> the platform, and Luna follows him as best she can through the crowd to the carriages. <span class="s1">Everything s</span>mell<span class="s1">s</span> of damp pine needles<span class="s1">, and the hot steam from the train</span>. September is cool in this part of the world, especially at night.</p><p class="p2">She keeps relatively close to Harry in the crowd of students since she is carrying his friend’s owl, but she can’t hear what he whispers to Ginny or what he is saying. He looks out for Ron and Hermione, but they have gone slightly ahead.</p><p class="p2">They walk off the platform of Hogsmeade station and onto the wet <span class="s1">muddy path</span> where the thestral-drawn carriages await the students. Luna can’t help the smile that settles on her face. They’ve always filled her with a sense of calm, the thestrals. Well, almost always. She approaches the carriages that Harry Potter and his friends have approached, and notices something extraordinary.</p><p class="p2">Harry Potter is looking <em>at</em> a thestral.</p><p class="p2">Luna has never met another student who can see them, though she is sure that there must be a few.</p><p class="p2">“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron <span class="s1">calls out</span> hoarsely, his back turned to her. Luna wonders if the owl that she is holding is called “Pig”.</p><p class="p2">Luna makes a cooing noise at <span class="s1">the little owl in the cage she holds up to her face</span>. The owl chirps cacophonously in response. “You’re quite charming, aren’t you?” Luna whispers, before <span class="s1">getting</span> closer to Harry and his waiting friend.</p><p class="p2">“What <em>are</em> those things, d’you reckon?” Harry asks <span class="s1">Ron, still</span> staring at the thestrals. <span class="s1">Her heart skips a beat. </span></p><p class="p2">“What things?” Ron answers.</p><p class="p2">“Those horses—“</p><p class="p2">“Here you are,” <span class="s1">Luna</span> <span class="s1">interrupts</span> serenely, holding up the owl cage, “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he?”</p><p class="p2">“Er, yeah, he’s all right.” Ron does not seem pleased to see her, or even his owl,<span class="s1"> again</span>. “Well, come on, then, let’s get in… What were you saying, Harry?”</p><p class="p2">“I was saying, what are these horse things?” Harry asks. Ron takes the cage from Luna, but stares with concern at his friend.</p><p class="p2">“What horse things?” Ron asks<span class="s1">, glancing up at</span> the carriage that Ginny and Hermione are waiting in. Luna <span class="s1">waits</span>, curious to hear what <span class="s1">he</span> will say.</p><p class="p2">“The horse things pulling the carriages!” <span class="s1">snaps</span> Harry<span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p2">Ron protests that he doesn’t see anything, no matter how <span class="s1">much </span>close<span class="s1">r</span> Harry drags Ron to the carriage harness. Luna places her trunk onto the back of the carriage, but instead of <span class="s1">getting</span> in she <span class="s1">approaches</span> Harry<span class="s1"> instead.</span> <span class="s1">Ron has already stepped into the carriage, but Harry is</span> staring at the thestrals with a frustrated look on his face.</p><p class="p3">She can hear the thestral breathing, quite horselike, a warm rush of air expelled from its<span class="s2"> nose. </span>Luna<span class="s2"> reaches out her hand and, very delicately, touches the creature’s shoulder, before looking at Harry, </span>who looks particularly distraught<span class="s2">. </span></p><p class="p2">“It’s all right,” she wants to sound as reassuring as possible,<span class="s1"> for the creature’s sake as well</span>. <span class="s1">Harry</span> whirls around at the sound of her voice, and she can see into <span class="s1">those famed</span> green eyes <span class="s1">of his, </span>reflecting the yellow light of the lanterns perched on top of the carriages. “You’re not going mad or anything,” she s<span class="s1">oothes</span>, “I can see them, too<span class="s1">, you know</span>.”</p><p class="p2">“Can you?” he looks at her like he did back on the train, when he asked to look at her copy of The Quibbler. Like she matters.</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She thinks that he</span> has lovely eyes.</p><p class="p2">“Oh yes,” she tells him conversationally,<span class="s1"> smiling,</span> “I’ve been able to see them since my very first day here. They’ve always pulled the carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just as sane as I am.”</p><p class="p2">He frowns <span class="s1">at that</span>, but says nothing. She smil<span class="s1">es</span> once more for him<span class="s1"> before s</span>he turns and <span class="s1">walks to </span>the carriage, noticing that tight feeling in her chest which has returned, leaving her a little breathless.</p><p class="p3">It does reassure her a little when <span class="s2">Harry follows her into the carriage</span>.<span class="s2"> She tries not to let it bother her that Harry looks so perturbed and uncomfortable as he sits down next to her. Hermione </span>shoots him a look of<span class="s2"> concern</span>.<span class="s2"> Ginny is also looking at Harry, a fact which does not pass unnoticed by Luna.</span> And though Harry can scarcely tear his gaze from the thestrals as they pull the carriage away from the station and towards the castle, she does notice that he occasionally sends furtive glances her way, which she pretends not to notice. She made him uncomfortable enough on the train.</p><p class="p3">She knows how the thestrals must feel, to be invisible for so long, until suddenly it all changes.</p></div>
