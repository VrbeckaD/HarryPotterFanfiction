End of discussion.”</p><p>“Come on Draco, it will be fun!” Harry made an overdramatic pout face. “Please?”</p><p>Draco sighed, putting his face in his hands. “Fine.” Harrys face lit up in his excitement but Draco stopped him before he could get too crazy. “But! I am <em>not </em>going into <em>any</em> haunted houses. Understand?”</p><p>“Okay, okay, fine! I’m just so glad you’re coming! I’ll call Hermione and Ron.”</p><p>Harry walked off to go get his cell and tell his friends the good news.</p><p>“Fuck. Why did I listen to him? Why did I agree to go?” Draco muttered under his breath.</p><p>“What?” Harry called from the other room.</p><p>“Nothing love.”</p><p>“Okay, so we’re picking up ‘mione and Pansy first, then Ron and Blaise. After that, we’ll go to haunt. Sound good?” Harry was talking to Draco in their car, confirming the plan. Draco nodded and swallowed thickly. he was regretting this more and more every minute. </p><p>When they arrived at Hermione and Pansy’s house, the girls eagerly jumped in the car, urging Harry to ‘drive faster so they could get to haunt already!’ Hermione had certainly changed from her old super strict, always follow the rules self after she started seeing Pansy. They drove to go pick up Ron and Blaise, who were shouted at by the girls to ‘hurry up and get in the car already!’ Draco’s mouth was dry as the parked the car and started walking to the entrance.</p><p>“Harry,” he whispered. The taller man couldn’t hear him over the sounds of rollercoasters and music. He tugged on Harry’s sleeve and whispered again, more harshly. “Harry!”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“I don’t want to do this anymore.” Draco’s knuckles were turning white from his death grip on Harry’s sleeve.</p><p>“Come on love, it’s not that bad. Relax, you’ll have fun. I promise.” Draco tried to protest more when he was roughly shoved inside by the growing crowd. He quickly regained his grip on Harry, and their group, despite his growing efforts to drag Harry nack outside, moved forward.</p><p>After around 5 minutes of forcing the group to stay near the entrance so he could calm down, Draco had relaxed. A bit.</p><p>“I guess this isn’t <em>that</em> ba-” Draco stopped abruptly and let out a loud high pitched scream, dropping to the ground and yelling out “FUCK!” when a man who appeared to be looking at a map suddenly dropped the map and jumped at Draco, revealing that half of his face was covered in makeup that looked like blood and maggots.</p><p>A few younger kids and their mothers turned to look (and scowl) at him. The performer walked away and Harry lowered down to try and ease Draco back up. </p><p>“Hey, love, it’s okay. It was just makeup.”  Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, trying to calm his shaking. He gently stood back up, holding on to Harry even tighter. </p><p>“I am <em>not</em> having fun.” Draco sniffed, taking a deep breath. Harry bit back at a laugh, Draco’s reaction had been quite amusing and walked on with the rest of the group. </p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>“Pans, come on!” Hermione grabbed her girlfriends hand and pulled her along to the next scare area. Draco and Harry were going slower with Draco freaking out at the slightest thing. Ron and Blaise were going on a few rides then they would all meet at a haunted house. </p><p>The next area had performers hiding behind various barrels and coffins, and empty coffins you could sit and take pictures in. Hermione climbed in with Pansy and took a few pictures. They laughed when a performer jumped up behind them. Eventually, they slowed down and just walked together.</p><p>“You know what? I love you.” Hermione smiled and kissed her girlfriend gently. </p><p>“I love you too, Pans. I’m glad I finally found someone who will go to haunt with me and not be scared out of their pants.”</p><p>“Oh, <em>wow.</em> So I’m only here because Draco is too scared and Harry has to stay with him? Thanks,” Pansy laughed, trying to look disappointed. Hermoine snorted and ran forward. </p><p>“If we hurry, we can make it for the scare box at the corn maze!” Pansy smiled and ran after the other girl.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>“Blaise, my feet hurt. We’ve been in this line forever!” Ron groaned, resting on the railing. They were in line for Yukon Striker, the steepest ride there. None of the rest of their group had wanted to go. </p><p>“D’you want me to carry you, darling?” Ron flushed at the nickname. Blaise could always make him turn red. </p><p>“Sure,” Blaise crouched down and Ron hopped on his back. They walked forward in the line, and when they eventually reached the top Ron got off of Blaise. They put their bags in the box and buckled in.</p><p>“I haven’t been on this yet. Is it that bad?” Ron looked a bit worried.</p><p>“It’s fun. <em>Amore,</em> you barely even notice how steep it is.” The tips of Ron’s ears turned red at Blaise calling him a nickname in Italian. </p><p>“Okay…” Ron bit his lip as the ride started moving upwards.</p><p>Once they reached the top and were peering downwards, the ride stopped. </p><p>“Fucking hell! Not that steep my ass! Blaise, we better not be stuck up here,” Ron shouted, grabbing Blaise’s hand.</p><p>“No, Ron, it’s not stu-” Ron couldn’t hear the rest of what Blaise said, but his mind was elsewhere as the ride shot downwards.</p><p>“FUCKING HELL!” Ron screamed, eyes wide and mouth gaping as the picture was taken. Blaise laughed at him,  but the noise was drowned out by the wind.</p><p>As they exited the ride to go see their photos, Ron’s phone rang.</p><p>“Hey, Ron? It’s Harry. Me, Draco, Pansy and ‘mione are waiting by the corn maze. Where are you and Blaise?”</p><p>“We’re just getting out photos, we’ll be there in a minute.”</p><p>“Alright, bye.”</p><p>“See ya.” Ron hung up the phone and went to catch up with Blaise who had already bought the photos of Ron looking shocked out of his mind. They started making their way towards the corn maze.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>“Alright, are we ready to go in?” Pansy asked, looking over everyone in their group.</p><p>“No,” Draco muttered, but he was ignored by the rest of the group. Everyone nodded their heads. They all walked in and were immediately greeted by a woman dressed as a clown with fake cuts all over her face. </p><p>“Hello!” She welcomed them with a shrill, hoarse voice.</p><p>“Jesus!” Draco yelled out, startled. Everyone else remained unfazed. Hermione was even talking with the clown, asking about the directions. They kept walking, but Draco had buried his face in Harry’s shoulder, unable to see anything.</p><p>“You know, when you look scared we want to scare you more!” Said a clown who had leaned closer to Draco. </p><p>“Well, that’s a dick thing to do!” He shouted, re-situating his face so he couldn’t see anything.</p><p>Pansy and Hermione were having a great time. They had run ahead and were already in the corn maze section, while the boys were still in the clown house area. Blaise and Ron were walking together, with Ron yelling out the first absurd thing that came to mind when he got scared. When he had yelled out  “I’m gay that's homophobic!” At a scarecrow-person, they had to stop scaring people for a second because they were laughing too hard. When he had yelled, “WELL,  <em>FUCK</em> ME!” After rounding a corner and seeing a decapitated person with hay stuffed in the “wound”, Blaise had leaned down and whispered “You know that’s my job <em>mi amore,” w</em>hich had caused Ron to turn scarlet. When the boys finally made it through the maze and reunited with the girls who had made it through before them, they started making their way to the exit. </p><p>“You know I’m not sleeping for the next month,” Draco said to Harry, resting his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder. </p><p>“We could do things other than sleeping.” Harry smiled and kissed Draco’s hair, which was messy and in his face.</p><p>“Nope. You aren’t getting anything. You made me go to this. No sex. You are banned.” Harry laughed and unlocked the car. Everyone climbed in and Harry started the drive to their homes.</p><p>“Did everyone have fun?” Blaise asked. A chorus of ‘yeahs’ and a ‘nope’ from Draco came from the front and back seats.</p><p>“Come on Draco, not even a little bit of fun?” Blaise asked, poking the blond’s shoulder.</p><p>“None,” Draco said firmly, but he was biting back a smile.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________Amore=Love<br/>Mi amore= My love</p></div>
