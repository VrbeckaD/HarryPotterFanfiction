    <p>
  <span>Harry is talking with Fred and George in the Gryffindor commons—or rather, Harry is listening animatedly as the pair trip over each others words trying to describe every bit of planning that's gone into the joke shop since he loaned them his winnings. They insist it's a loan but honestly, Harry has no idea what he'd do with that kind of money even if it didn't stink of death to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since you've done us the honor of being our first-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And best-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And only donor, we decided you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should know exactly what magnificent schemes we've been up to-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If and when we get up to them.” Fred finishes for them, with a surprisingly sheepish grin. Harry nods at them, and goes to open his mouth to respond. And stops. He tastes copper; at first, he thinks with a sigh that he's somehow bleeding again, but he doesn't feel any blood in his mouth, just the metallic taste filling his mouth and the smell filling his nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doing alright?” George asks, before abandoning the shared sentences in favor of some genuine concern, “We didn't overwhelm you with our brilliance, did we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This gets a scoff out of Harry, but his face is confused and his speech slow, “No… Do you… smell that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The twins look to each other in alarm at their friend's behavior, then look back at Harry just in time to see him drop to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blimey! Harry what's happened, are you alright?” Fred yells as he and his twin rush forward to him, but Harry isn't responding. George goes to get McGonagall while Fred shakes Harry, trying to get him to wake. He's running through all the curses and poisons that could cause this when Harry starts jerking. It starts at his arm and evolves until it looks like his whole body is reacting to cruciatus. Something about this seems familiar: a muggle show his father watched, a ‘medical drama’ he'd called it, and one of the muggles had looked awfully similarly, but what was it…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seizure!” he shouts, just as his Head of House storms in with his twin right behind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should think so, Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall agrees upon seeing Harry twitching violently on the ground, before wordlessly levitating him, “I'm bringing him to Madame Pomfrey at once. You two should see about packing for break,” the twins both look indignant at this, clearly intent on following, and McGonagall sighs, “You'll be no help to Harry now, and Pomfrey will need her space to work. I will give you an update once he is stable.” She promises, her voice going softer at the end. With that, she leaves, walking Harry’s still shaking body in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well George?” Fred asks as soon as she's out of earshot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Fred,” His brother responds, already pulling an Extendable Ear out of his pocket, “we would do well to listen to our Head of House.” He wiggles the ear for emphasis and they both grin determinedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wakes, not for the first or even the tenth time, in the hospital wing. He half-heartedly thinks that he really should stop making a habit of this, but that's all he has time to think before the vague form he assumes is Pomfrey notices he's awake and is on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After about two minutes of poking, prodding and wand-waving she harrumphs, “Really, Mister Potter, you must stop ending up here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well ‘s not like I've had much choice in it,” he grumbles back, his mouth and throat painfully dry. He feels regret for his attitude when Pomfrey flushes but honestly, it’s not like he </span>
  <em>
    <span>wants</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be here. “So, what's the damage this time?” He's expecting something didn't quite go right with the healing of his leg, or that the scar decided once again to be a ginormous prick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Madame Pomfrey looks serious, however, and not in her normal you-should-have-listened-to-me kind of way. “You had a seizure. A Grand-Mal to be precise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the deck of cards that is his slowly rebuilding hope for normalcy crumbles. Harry takes a moment to feel around for his glasses and slips them on, hoping that being able to see what's in front of him will provide some form of clarity. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The damage from the killing curse apparently went deeper than the scarring on your forehead,” his fingers trace the scar without thinking, “it also damaged your brain; we weren't able to detect the injury when you were an infant due to a combination of our diagnostic spells not including information on the killing curse for fairly obvious reasons, and because your young magic had already made good work of healing it.” Pomfrey seems ashamed that the damage wasn't detected. Harry is even more confused as to what happened after hearing the explanation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if it healed,” he starts slowly, picking out the words, “then how could it cause a seizure?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the bustling anger he is used to from the healer comes back into her voice, “I, too, had that question, before I was informed that you had suffered the cruciatus curse at the end of the Tournament,” here he is torn between feeling sheepish that he didn't tell her and angry that he is seemingly being blamed for neglecting to recite each gory detail of that horrible night </span>
  <em>
    <span>again</span>
  </em>
  <span>, “and I believe that may have been the trigger for this epileptic event. While it is true that the damage to your brain was long-healed, it left scarring in your frontal lobe; the cruciatus curse no doubt disrupted the scarring and caused damage of its own. But,” she puts up a hand, accurately sensing that he's preparing quite a few more questions, “we will get into the details at a later time. Right now you have quite a few anxious visitors, and with your permission I will let some through before you go back to resting.” Harry lets out a frustrated huff at being kept in the dark, but waves his assent for his friends to be let in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pomfrey knows that Potter is angry with the seeming lack of information, but she also knows from her experience as a healer that he'll need more time to process what happened without being swamped with potion schedules, success rates and medical jargon. So she lifts the warding on the hospital wing to allow those with a genuine interest in Harry's well-being from its placement at ‘medical emergencies only’, and watches in amusement at the identical redheads that fall through the previously locked double doors, with another pair of short and long haired redheads and a head of bushy brown hair following in much the same fashion. As Hermione and the Weasley siblings picked themselves up from their heap on the floor to go and visit Harry, a particularly mangey black dog steps around them and pads over to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Black,” the dog inclines its head, “is there a reason you have come to me instead of following the hoard of children to Mr. Potter’s sickbed?” The dog huffs and shakes itself, and suddenly Sirius Black is standing before her, looking just as haggard as his animal counterpart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His voice is grave when he speaks, “I want to know what happened to my godson, Poppy. He was given a clear bill of health not two weeks ago!” Pomfrey resists the urge to snap at his rudeness as she would have when he was a student; though some may doubt it, she was trained to handle the volatile emotions of patients’ families with grace and ease.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mr. Potter was admitted after a Grand Mal seizure. I was unaware as to what could have triggered it, as relevant parties neglected to inform me he had been subjected to the cruciatus curse,” Sirius bares his teeth, and Pomfrey is unsure whether it is due to being accused of misconduct or simply the reminder of the pain his godson had endured, “I believe the stimulation to the parietal lobe disrupted the scar tissue remaining from his encounter with the killing curse, causing the subsequent seizure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’s face is pale and his breaths come shallowly, “But he’s alright now, Poppy? You’ve healed him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighs and gestures for him to take a conjured seat, looking briefly to the bed of the boy in question and making sure his attention is sufficiently held by his young friends. “I had hoped to discuss this once Harry has had time to process what his body has been through. To answer your question: no, I have not healed him,” Pomfrey has to raise her hand immediately to stop Sirius’s cry of outrage, “not for lack of trying. The brain is a complex thing, Sirius, the magical brain even more so. You have to understand that </span>
  <em>
    <span>no one </span>
  </em>
  <span>has ever survived the killing cures. The long-term effects on the brain are completely unknown, and I was unable to observe how he progressed until he arrived at Hogwarts. Harry has, in essence, suffered what muggle doctors call a traumatic brain injury. While this is an area that muggles are infinitely more studied in, even they cannot predict the exact effects such an injury will have on the development and function of the brain. His suffering from the cruciatus curse alone would be cause for much concern, as it has been known to cause chronic issues in even full-grown wizards. Adding that to his previous damage, well…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, Poppy!” SIrius snaps, only just remembering to keep his voice low before casting a  silencing charm around them, “What is wrong with him? Is it,” the heat drops from his voice, and a haunted look comes to his eyes, “is it like the Longbottoms?” In this moment, Pomfrey is hit not for the first time by how </span>
  <em>
    <span>young</span>
  </em>
  <span> this man is. How young, barely over thirty, to have seen the deaths and permanent injuries of nearly everyone he called a friend, and to have been isolated and blamed for over a decade alone with his grief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a second thought, she stands and pulls him into a short yet fierce hug. When she lets go, she schools her face into a poor mask of professional detachment. “He has full access to his mental and physical faculties,” she pushes past the bone-shaking sigh of relief from the man before her, “and he will live a relatively unimpaired life.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Relatively?” his voice cracks. Sirius has his hands clasped in front of him, his legs bouncing not unlike he’s  a rather bad case of fleas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This seizure will almost definitely not be an isolated occurrence. The scarring covers much of his frontal and parietal lobes, the areas responsible for complex thought, movement, and interpretation of sensory input; parietal lobe damage is not unheard of after untreated use of the Cruciatus curse, as the area controls the sensation of pain. The nature of his seizures may change—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius interrupts, “Hold on, nature of the seizures? Isn’t a fit just when someone drops and their limbs go all haywire?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would be a Grand Mal seizure, the type of fit Harry had this afternoon. According to the most recent muggle literature I could find, there are many different types of seizures, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Harry has suffered some of the less noticeable types, such as one that simply ceases conscious thought, during his youth. In any case, the main types of seizures to be expected from the locations of his scarring are these same Grand Mals, seizures that originate in only one part of his brain and may present minimal symptoms of movement in one part of the body called complex partial seizures, and somatosensory seizures, which cause the sensation of something, commonly a feeling of electricity or pain.” Pomfrey can tell Sirius has processed little of her speech, but she takes no offense; she was saying it as much for her own benefit, to sort the information, as it was for him to hear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He runs shaking hands over his face, “Is there nothing we can do? Can you not just remove the scarring?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gives him a sympathetic smile and shakes her head, “I’m afraid not. Most spells and potions for healing scars offer merely cosmetic changes, and none are intended for internal use; it’s more than likely that any attempt would only worsen the damage.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we give up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her face hardens, “We will do </span>
  <em>
    <span>no</span>
  </em>
  <span> such thing. I have already been working with Professor Snape and my contacts in muggle hospitals to develop potions assisting with the severity, frequency, and after-effects of his seizures. Hear this, Sirius,” she grabs one of his hands firmly within both of her own and stares into his wide eyes, “I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> giving up on Mr. Potter, and I never plan to. Do you understand?” She shakes his hands in emphasis, and after a moment, as if the question has just passed to his brain, he clears his throat and nods. “Good. Now go see your boy.”</span>
