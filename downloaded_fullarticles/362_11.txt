    <p>I : If They'd Been Here To See This</p><p> </p><p>June 2004 | The Burrow </p><p> </p><p>The was no better way to describe the all-encompassing, immensely positive atmosphere of The Burrow that day than filled with love. Mrs Weasley had filled the garden with all sorts of twinkling lights and candles, as well as chains upon chains of beautiful vibrant flowers. When Harry gazed around himself at his friends and family, his Hogwarts house mates, the Wealeys, the remaining members of the Order, he felt unbelievably safe. The immense feeling of love and support just showed how going through what they had six years ago had brought them all so much closer, just as fighting the troll in first year had brought Harry, Hermione and Ron together as friends. </p><p> </p><p>And it was apparent to Harry that Ron and Hermione had been brought closer together than he had to either of them, in a way. Yet in a way, he and Ron were closer that either of them could ever be  to anyone else, they were true best friends.</p><p>Hermione's hair was meticulously straightened and styled, tied up into an intricate braid around the back of her hair, adorned with various flowers. Her dress was a magnificent white, and seemed to be woven with a material shimmering under the moonlight. </p><p> </p><p>After the incident at the Yule Ball, Ron had opted for the muggle approach to his wedding-wear, and had avoided dress robes like the plague. Instead Ron wore and ebony black suit, fitted perfect to him, it seemed that his wedding was the one time he was able to wear something other than second-hand. Although Harry had no doubt that if Mrs Weasley had had her own way, Ron would be wearing something reminiscent of his Yule Ball dress robes.</p><p>The two danced across the garden, each other's gazes so full of love Harry doubted that either saw anybody else but each other in that moment.</p><p>Harry felt nothing but joy for his two closest friends in this moment, yet couldn't help but allow his mind to drift to what might have been, had his fourth year at Hogwarts gone different. Cedric Diggory was two years above Harry at Hogwarts and was of the correct age when his name was called out of the goblet of first to be Hogwarts' champion. Cedric was attractive and kind, and one of the most amazing and most genuine people Harry had ever met. He was even partly the reason for Harry realising his bisexuality.</p><p>Following Christmas of his fourth year at Hogwarts, Harry and Cedric had grown closer, they were both Hogwarts champions, they were both seekers of the Quidditch teams for their respective houses, and they were both bisexual. </p><p> </p><p>Harry and Cedric started dating following the second task of the Triwizard tournament and it quickly became serious, Harry had never been happier to be with another human in his life, and wanted so much to be with Cedric for years to come. </p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up at the bride and groom dancing in the Burrow, and pictured himself and Cedric there instead. He pictured a world where his friends and family knew about his bisexuality, where Cedric had lived and they had stayed together, and eventually come out. He pictured a world where he could be living the rest of his life hand in hand with his first love. His only love.</p><p>But he can't.</p><p>All that was taken away from him.</p><p>He didn't even get to tell Cedric that he loved him.</p><p> </p><p>And it was Cedric's death which played some part in what Harry had become, in driving him to do right by Cedric, and driving him to protect all others from the dark arts, from anybody having to face the same fate as Cedric, to save anyone else from having to face the same fate as Harry had done. </p><p> </p><p>Harry must have zoned out for a little while, as before he knew it, the garden was full of people dancing together, and Ron and Hermione had sat beside him, still hand in hand. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright Harry?" spoke Ron, his best friend, of whom he'd just been his best man.</p><p>Harry looked towards Ron, touching his hand against his eye, wiping away the beginning of a tear that was forming.</p><p>"I'm fine, just thinking about people who couldn't be here," </p><p> </p><p>The three of them frowned slightly, before Hermione commented, "I'm sure they're here with us, in one way or another." she assured Harry, smiling.</p><p>Ron laughed, "Yeah, well I'm glad it's not as ghosts, or Fred would be wreaking absolute  chaos,"</p><p> </p><p>The three of them laughed as Ron got up to talk to some of his other guests, walking towards Mr Weasley who gave him what appeared to be a congratulatory hug.</p><p>"Great turn out, eh?" Harry spoke, looking over to Hagrid, in one of his woven brown suits dancing with McGonagall and Mr Granger, who seemed vaguely intimidated by the two of them, but was glad to finally meet the half-giant who'd been looking out for his daughter whilst she was at school.</p><p>Hermione chuckled softly, "Everyone we love is here, or well almost everyone," She paused, "I would've asked Tonks to be my maid of honour, had she still been around. Her Teddy makes one hell of an adorable ring bearer though, doesn't he?"</p><p>"I was thinking about Cedric earlier," Harry spoke, looking over to Hermione, who had had look of concern in her eyes, "It was nine years last week."</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out. Harry had been wanting to tell someone about their relationship for so long, nobody really understood how badly Cedric's death had affected him. Harry looked at her so happy, and not even knowing what came over him, he had decided to tell her. </p><p> </p><p>"Look, Hermione, I want to tell you something," Harry breathed, "about Cedric,"</p><p>Before harry could continue, she cut him off, "I know." She simply stated, and the way she looked directly into Harry's eyes told him that she did, in fact know.</p><p>"The way it affected you, she continued, that was more than just a friendship, Harry." she looked at him, "I know love Harry," she glanced at Ron, "and you and him - you had it."</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to speak, but was once again cut off by Hermione, "Look Harry, I don't care you know. I don't care that you're gay. And no, I won't tell anyone. That's your secret to tell."</p><p>Harry leaned over and pulled Hermione into a tight hug, allowing a tear or two to escape, as his mind once again drifted to Cedric.</p><p>"Thank you," Harry spoke in a strained whisper, head still firmly planted on Hermione's shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>he looked at her as he pulled away, "You're wrong though."</p><p>Hermione looked at him in surprise, "I'm not gay. I'm Bisexual."</p><p>She rolled her eyes in response and walked towards where Mr Weasley was no-doubt interrogating Mrs Granger on some kind of muggle tradition (such as the countless muggle traditions they had incorporated into the wedding.</p><p>Hermione and Ron's wedding was everything you'd have expected it to be, all of their family was there and everyone that they loved, even a few Hogwarts professors had taken the trip down to the Burrow for the weekend, Harry looked over at everyone attending, trying not to think about Cedric, Fred, Remus or Tonks. Charlie Weasley caught his eye first, Harry wasn't sure whom he was talking to, but whomever it was was getting an lengthy introduction to Charlie's new Romanian boyfriend.</p><p>Just as Harry was about to get up and join the wedding reception (Hagrid looked like he and Professor McGonagall were having a hilariously amazing time), he noticed a dark brown barn owl swoop into the garden, and drop a letter onto harry's lap. The letter was unmistakably one from the Ministry, where Harry worked as an Auror, the envelope had a ministry stamp, as well as a 'Per Bubonem' and a 'Confidential' stamp.</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened the letter hesitantly, knowing he was likely being summoned to work, and if he was being summoned to work the something had happened, and he'd have to leave the wedding. Scanning it's contents, Harry realised that his concerns had been true. Something had happened. Two wizards both with identical symptoms had been found in Diagon Alley and had been taken to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Harry, as an Auror, had been called in to investigate, specifically to speak to the victims and to the Healer looking after them.</p><p>Harry stuffed the letter into his robes and walked towards the main group of people dancing to the weird sisters record that was now filling the space. Harry quickly found Ron and Hermione, to tell them of his letter. </p><p> </p><p>"I have to go," Harry stated bluntly.</p><p>The look, in that moment, on Ron's face was one that Harry never wanted to forget. It was a look of pure confusion, upset and a desire to slap Harry. Yet Ron did not, he simply stated, "What is it this time?"</p><p>Hermione elbowed her husband in the side, "Don't be rude!" she turned to Harry, "Well what is it this time?"</p><p>Harry had to stifle a giggle at the second look on Ron's face that he'd never want to forget in response to Hermione's question. </p><p> </p><p>"Two identical casualties in Diagon Alley, I've to go to St. Mungo's and speak to the victims,"</p><p>Harry hugged the two of them, not wanting to go, before mouthing a 'sorry' to the two of them and heading off to find Mr or Mrs Weasley. </p><p> </p><p>It was Mrs Weasley who Harry found first, she was sat nearer the house, talking with Bill and Fleur, the two of them looking out onto the scene of the wedding, smiling. Harry interrupted the three of them, asking Mrs Weasley if he could use their chimney to get to St Mungo's for work. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course my dear!" Mrs Weasley exclaimed, "You know where it is, would you like a slice of cake for the journey darling?"</p><p> </p><p>Laughing, Harry declined and made his way inside the house to enter the Floo Network via The Burrow fireplace. Reaching into the pot of Floo Powder on top of the fireplace, Harry stood inside and threw the Floo powder down, yelling 'St. Mungo's Hospital!'</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>Harry arrived in the St. Mungo's reception fireplace with a crash and a sputter, never having liked this mode of travel. Dusting himself off, Harry walked up towards the reception desk, which was  reminiscent of a regular muggle hospital; white walls, spotlessly clean floor tiles and a large round reception desk in the centre of the room, in front of various corridors with signs leading do all sorts of wards.</p><p>"Hi there," Harry spoke to the witch sat behind the desk, "I'm Harry Potter, an Auror with the Ministry, I'm here to speak to Mr May and Mr Deacon, I believe they were brought here from Diagon Alley earlier?"</p><p>The look on the witch's face was one with which Harry was familiar, she stuttered a little, clearly shocked to be face to face with the Wizard responsible for the final downfall of the Dark Lord, Voldemort.</p><p>"Er... yes, Mr May and Mr Deacon, they're in ward fifteen, that's unknown curses, hexes and poisons, if you just follow the signs down the corridor to the right here, you'll find it easy. Their healer should be in there too, if you need to speak to him also."</p><p>The witch's speech became clearer as she went on, regaining her composure. Harry nodded and thanked her, heading right down the corridor, following signs that indeed said 'Ward Fifteen: Unknown Curses, Hexes and Poisons'.</p><p>Harry entered the ward, slowly pushing the door open and scanning the space for the ward's Healer, it shouldn't have been difficult; Healers wear bright green uniform robes. Yet Harry couldn't see one. Harry continued onto the ward, stopping at the beds with Mr May and Mr Deacon written onto the chart hooked onto the end of the bed. </p><p>Neither May or Deacon were awake so harry sat on one of the chairs between the beds and waited for the ward healer to return. Harry looked around at the ward, it had about fourteen beds, seven on either side of the room, each with a curtain the pull around the bed, as well as chairs and various potion ingredients and cauldrons.</p><p>Around half and hour had passed before anybody else entered the ward, and Harry was just about ready to leave, when a wizard waked into the ward, wearing the bright green uniform robes of a Healer. The wizard was tall, a little taller than Harry, and had a generally thin stature, although he wasn't skinny or bony. He had shoulder length while blonde hair, which had a slight wave and was pulled up into a loose ponytail to keep it out of his face. His eyes were a shimmering sliver/grey colour and something about him seemed vaguely familiar to Harry.</p><p>That's when it dawned on him. </p><p>This healer was none other than Draco Malfoy, the very wizard who had spent all seven of his years at Hogwarts tormenting Harry and his friends, being a bully and even siding with the Death Eaters during the Second Wizarding war. Although Harry did have some sympathy for Draco, his father had spent the better part of his life treating him terribly and conditioning Draco to believe and agree with The Malfoy's ideals about muggle-born witches and wizards. Harry was fairly certain that Draco had since renounced these beliefs, though he wasn't one-hundred percent sure.</p><p>It was apparent to Harry that this realisation had also dawned on Draco, by the look on his face. It was almost as if Draco wasn't entirely sure what to feel, his expression was almost unreadable, it showed confusion and pain, almost as if seeing Harry sat there had triggered a painful memory in Draco.</p><p>An agonisingly slow thirty seconds passed before either of the spoke.</p><p>"Potter." Draco spoke in an almost questioning tone, as if he could hardly believe that it was actually Harry that stood before him, and if he didn't known any better, Harry would've said that he sensed almost the tiniest amount of warmness to his tone, as if seeing Harry for the first time in three years wasn't necessarily a bad thing. </p><p>"Malfoy." Harry retorted, his response almost confirming Draco's comment. As if Harry's acknowledgement of Draco answered the almost-question that Draco had begun the conversation with.</p><p>"I hear you're with the ministry now Potter," Malfoy spoke, his initial shock overcome, he was doing a far better job at concealing his emotion and opinion toward Harry in his tone.</p><p>"And you're a Healer,"</p><p>"I am,"</p><p>"So, what can you tell me about these two then?" </p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>Harry's mind was racing as he made his way out of the hospital, not quite sure how to feel about the whole situation. He knew that Draco was 'on their side' after the Second Wizarding War, yet he couldn't help but be weary of him. Draco had spent all of their time at Hogwarts bullying him and his friends, but Harry felt, that after all this time, after everything they've all been through, now wasn't the time to be holding grudges, after all Harry did go back into the fire in the room of requirement to get Draco. Harry had saved Draco's life back in 1998, and Draco had done the same for him when he'd pretended to not recognise Harry. Harry did want to forgive Draco, and certainly did, but he wasn't sure if his friends and family would be willing to  do  the same. But his past experiences with Draco wasn't the only thing plaguing Harry's mind, so was Draco now. While there was definite tension between the two as a result of their childhood together, the two of them had grown up, they'd moved past their grudges and petty feuds and moved on with life. Draco had made a life for himself, he was a Healer at St Mungo's- that's a great job, and not to mention how different Draco seemed.  Harry didn't remember Draco being this attractive before. Harry had never noticed Draco's defined jaw and cheek bones, or the way they perfectly shaped his face. Harry had never really noticed Draco's lean figure, and muscular arms. But no- no Harry wasn't attracted to Draco, Harry didn't want anything like that from Draco. Yet it was incredibly easy to picture the two of them together, Harry could practically feel Draco's arms around, holding him in a warm embrace. </p><p>But no. Draco would never want that. </p><p>And that's a good thing; Harry didn't either. </p><p>No way.He may have been bisexual, but that did not mean that he was in any way attracted to Draco. No. Not at all.</p><p>Yet some part of him couldn't help but be excited to return the following day for a follow up on Mr May and Mr Deacon.</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>Merlin's beard that was Harry fucking Potter. The boy who lived. Or more accurately, the boy who wouldn't fucking die. That was the same person who Draco had pined for during his last two years at Hogwarts, the same person who made him realise that he was gay, the person who made him realise that what he'd grown up believing in his family was wrong. And he was just here. So casual. Harry sat there and spoke to Draco about two of his patients so candidly, so normally as if it had just been another job. As if Draco hadn't spent years lusting after him, as if he and Draco hadn't saved each other's lives in '98. And he's just as perfect as he always was, Draco thought. </p><p>Images of Harry drifted into his mind, he thought about Harry as the Quidditch Griffyndor team captain, flying around the pitch on his Firebolt, being so agile and athletic and perfect. And he thought of Harry in the Great hall sat amongst his friends, laughing and joking eating his breakfast. And he thought about how he wasn't a part of that. He thought about how he was never friends with Harry Potter, he thought about how he was never sat there, next to him, laughing and joking. </p><p>Draco thought about all those sleepless nights, when everything was all just too much, when he couldn't handle his family and he couldn't handle being considered a Death Eater, when he'd scratch and scratch at his dark mark just trying to get it to go away, and he thought about how much he needed Harry in those moments. he thought about how it'd have all been better if he had Harry there to hold him and tell him that he was going to be okay, if he had Harry there to look after him, to take him out of the darkness, to take him away from his wretched life and allow him to be a part of the family that Harry had found.</p><p>And Draco thought about Harry now. He thought about how happy and successful he must be, working with the ministry. About how perfect his life must be. About how much better it must be than Draco's. Draco's life had improved dramatically, but he was still so lonely. He had nobody to go to, he didn't have friends or godparents or Molly Weasley to play mum for him. Draco thought about how much happier Harry looked, about how attractive Harry still was, about how much Draco was still hopelessly attracted to Harry, about how much Draco yearned to be with him still. </p><p>These emotions from six years ago which Draco, until now, had to bury deep were starting to claw their way to the surface, and Draco knew it'd be a painful recovery this time. He knew he'd have to actually get over his feelings, rather than just force them deep inside him.</p><p>Draco unconsciously ran his hand over the long-healed scars on his arms, and pictured an alternative world where he had Harry, even if it was just to be his friend. Draco would take that, over having nobody, even if he had to continue to hide his romantic feelings for Harry. Draco allowed himself for one short moment to picture the warm tawny tone of Harry's fingertips running along Draco's arm, rather than his own, and picture Harry raising his other hand to Draco's face and pressing their foreheads together. And Draco knew that in that moment, even if it had been imagined, he'd been loved. Someone had genuinely cared about him, if only for a split second.</p><p>But he could never have that.</p><p>Even if Harry forgave him, they could never been friends, let alone more than that.</p><p>He could never have Harry.</p><p>Harry would never want  to have him.</p>
