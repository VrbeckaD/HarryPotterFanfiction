    <p>This story begins with an author beginning to learn how to be one.</p><p>When someone learns writing it is much like learning to play an instrument. They have to learn their craft. They make mistakes, ignoring all grammar rules, shattering their pacing, and forcing characters along without proper development. A great sin, or charm, of beginning writers is also their penchant for drama. Or at least hers had been. Her characters all had extravagant traumatic backstories combined with wealth and status. She had enjoyed giving them such things and living vicariously through the adventure of being able to <em>buy things you wanted</em>.</p><p>She could admit some of her early stories were riddled with cliches, lacked depth, and were underdeveloped.</p><p>One night she was going through boxes under her bed, preparing to move out finally, when she found an old flash drive. Amused she'd gone through it laughing and smiling as she discovered old stories she hadn't thought of in years. Silly ones. Serious ones. Long ones. Short ones. Hundreds of documents accounting for the early 2000s. The latest one had been freshman year of high school.</p><p>She had been delighted when she found <em>Slytherin's Princess</em>. She hadn't thought of the story in <em>years</em>. Previously it had been the longest thing she had ever written. Her attempt at tackling a cliche and making it interesting. It was close to her heart, but looking over the bits she had a hot mess.</p><p>The story had been her baby though and had gotten her writing. Years and hundreds of thousands of words and an English degree and published theses on fanfiction later she didn't regret it. She'd grown since then and Kira Maxwell, for all the melodrama of her story had been an important part of it.</p><p>She'd found herself reading late into the night. All her old notes and plans. Little thirteen year old her, had certainly been ambitious, she had reflected.</p><p>Finally, she'd set everything aside, slightly regretful about two in the morning reminding herself of her morning shift.</p><p>She went to sleep entertaining the idea of perhaps doing something incredibly self-indulgent. Like rewriting it with her current skills to see what happened.</p><p>It would be a change of pace. After all, she had started to work mainly on OC-inserts and Modern Characters in Thedas fics lately. Going back to her roots could be a good experiment.</p><p>This author went to sleep fully suspecting to wake up in the same bed she went to sleep in.</p><p>This unsuspecting author is the main character of this story.</p><p>This unsuspecting <em>victim of an author</em> is her.</p><p>When she opened her eyes the next day and realized what happened she was two things.</p><p>Pissed and confused.</p><p>Well, three, she knew from the outline she'd been reading she was also very, <em>very </em>fucked.</p>
