<p>Business at the Back of the Room</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Mind if I sit here?” </p>
<p>“Sit where you like, just be quiet about it. Some of us aren’t attention seekers.” </p>
<p>“Hilarious, Malfoy. Wait, what’s in that flask?” </p>
<p>“Officially? Coffee. But really, it’s brandy.” </p>
<p>“You drink <i>alcohol</i> during morning meetings? You’re a psychopath.” </p>
<p>“I prefer…creative.”</p>
<p>“Right—” </p>
<p>“Sod off, Potter. You’re just upset you didn’t think of it first.” </p>
<p>“Fuck. You could be right. Hand over that flask.” </p>
<p>“Well, well. So you <i>are</i> human.” </p>
<p>“Shut it. Mmm, that’s good. If we get caught, though—”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s good, it’s mine. And we won’t get caught because we’re way back here. Plus, even if we do, it’ll be on me. Good thing it won’t ruin my reputation, such as it is.”</p>
<p>“Hush. You’ve made quite the name for yourself in the department.”</p>
<p>“What have you heard? Whatever it is, it’s not true.”</p>
<p>“Relax, Malfoy, it’s all good.” </p>
<p>“Is that why you’re back here instead of up front?” </p>
<p>“I’m back here because I wanted to talk to you.” </p>
<p>“Is it about us becoming Auror partners? I hear Weasley’s leaving.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. But that wasn’t—” </p>
<p>“You’ll want me to write all the reports, won’t you?” </p>
<p>“Tempting, but no.” </p>
<p>“Then why are you asking me to partner with you?</p>
<p>“I’m not!” </p>
<p>“You don’t have to be insulting, Potter.” </p>
<p>“Will you let me finish? Bloody hell, you’re difficult to talk to.” </p>
<p>“Whatever.” </p>
<p>“I’d planned to ask you out!” </p>
<p>“<i>Planned</i> to? So you’ve changed your mind?”</p>
<p>“Argh! You’re so frustrating!”</p>
<p>“Is that a yes or no?”</p>
<p>“Merlin help me, but yes I’m still asking.”</p>
<p>“It’s because you’ve heard I’m kinky, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I…no. Although I have no objections to that.” </p>
<p>“I’m sure you don’t. Fine, come by my place tonight; here are my Floo coordinates. I’ll take you for a test ride and we’ll see how it goes.”</p>
<p>“Test ride? As in—?”</p>
<p>“Sex, Potter.” </p>
<p>“Um, shouldn’t we have dinner first?”</p>
<p>“Why? If the sex is awful, it’ll never work.” </p>
<p>“And if the sex is good?” </p>
<p>“You can buy me dinner. Agreed?” </p>
<p>“Yeah. Hey, can I have more of that brandy? That was stressful.”</p>
<p>“Should I worry about your drinking habits?” </p>
<p>“Asks the man who brings brandy to morning meetings?” </p>
<p>“Fair point.” </p>
