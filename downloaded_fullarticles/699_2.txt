    <p>Chapter One</p>
<p>Viktor Krum watched as Harry tried to deal with the aftermath of the Triwizard Tournament. Transported to a graveyard with Cedric, Harry had witnessed his friend be killed before being forced to take part in a ritual that would lead to You Know Who’s resurrection. Fortunately for Krum and everyone else something had gone wrong in the ritual and Voldemort had been destroyed, once and for all if you believe all the hype. His pathetic headmaster had run when he had felt his mark start to burn, Krum knew that he would no longer be welcomed back as headmaster of Durmstrang. Not that anyone would be disappointed by that fact.</p>
<p>Now Krum watched as Hogwarts celebrated, no one seemed to notice that Harry wasn’t interested in celebrating. Harry tried to keep to himself but was constantly pulled into conversation, had food or drink shoved into hands, dragged onto the dance floor where he awkwardly stood while people danced around him, or was pulled into tight hugs that Harry tried his best to manoeuvre out of. Krum clenched his fists in anger as he saw Harry flinch away from peoples touch, though no one else seemed to get the message that Harry wanted to be left alone. Even his best friends didn’t seem to notice what was going on, more wrapped up in each other than looking after their friend.</p>
<p>Krum grabbed a drink and walked closer to where the 14-year-old stood, surrounded by admirers and well-wishers. A look of sadness on his face that made something in Krum’s heart clench. Krum had admired Harry from the moment they had met. Placed in a tournament against his will and ridiculed by almost everyone Harry had held his head high and stayed strong. Krum didn’t know many adults who could have bore up so well under such pressure.</p>
<p>Fudge was blathering on loudly to anyone who would listen, “Harry my boy, you will make a fine Auror one day, join the academy straight out of Hogwarts and you will be off fighting more dark wizards before you know it.”</p>
<p>Harry looked sick at the mere thought and stuttered out, “honestly sir, I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>But his response fell on deaf ears. “Nonsense Harry, you defeated the most evil dark wizard we have ever known. Keep this up and you will be head Auror before you know it” Fudge exclaimed loudly.</p>
<p>Harry just dropped his head to the ground, not bothering to respond as everyone around him nodded at Fudge’s enthusiastic words.</p>
<p>Krum decided it was time to intervene. He walked forward tapping Harry on the shoulder, “may I have a vord with you Harry?” </p>
<p>Harry looked around at Krum clearly surprised, but he nodded, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Krum put his hand gently on Harry’s back extricating him from the swarm of sycophants and steering him out into the cool night air, Harry subconsciously moving closer into his side as they walked.</p>
<p>When they got outside Krum turned to Harry, his arm still resting loosely around his waist. He waved his wand casting a privacy spell around them so no one could hear their conversation, Harry raised an eyebrow at that but said nothing.</p>
<p>“How are you Harry?” Viktor asked.</p>
<p>Harry looked up green eyes meeting black, surprise clearly evident.</p>
<p>“No one’s asked me that yet,” Harry replied softly.</p>
<p>“Vell… I’m asking now.”</p>
<p>Harry studied Krums face, seeing the sincerity there he answered.</p>
<p>“Everyone expects me to be their hero, to keep being their hero for the rest of my life. I’m so very tired of it all, I just want a chance to be myself to live the life I want to live.”</p>
<p>“You’re tired of fighting, tired of being the protector, tired of living your life by other peoples expectations,” Krum queried watching the play of emotions run across Harry’s face as he spoke.</p>
<p>Harry looked down, his bright greens darting away in embarrassment before he slowly nodded.</p>
<p>Krum laid a finger under Harry’s chin, raising his face until their eyes met again.</p>
<p>“That is nothing to be embarrassed about Harry, you have been through so much, it is only natural that you would want a quieter life.”</p>
<p>“Come back to Bulgaria with me Harry, you vould be velcome to stay vith my family and I. The school year is over, you could spend the summer with us then start your fifth year at Durmstrang. It vould be a new beginning for you Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry gasped eyes going wide at the offer. His initial reaction was to say no, how could he leave everyone behind? But then he remembered how everyone had been treating him lately, dictating his life, making assumptions about what he wanted. Gosh, Mr and Mrs Weasley had even started making jokes about him marrying Ginny, argh as if he ever would, Harry thought frustrated. Even Sirius and Remus had been acting differently since Sirius’s name had been cleared, taking every chance to bask in the spotlight. Harry was happy for them, but just not interested in doing that himself.</p>
<p>Krum stayed quiet, shifting restlessly while he waited, allowing Harry time to think.</p>
<p>Eventually Harry realised there was only one answer he wanted to give.</p>
<p>“Yes… yes I will leave with you.” </p>
<p>Krum’s face broke into a small grin, the likes of which Harry hadn’t seen on the stern man before.</p>
<p>“Vonderful Harry, the Durmstrang ship leaves in 2 days, get your things together and we can move you onto the ship tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, feeling the beginnings of excitement starting to stir in his chest, replacing the numbness that had taken hold over the last week.</p>
<p>“What about Dumbledore and everyone, they aren’t going to be happy to see me go,” Harry asked taking a step back from Krum and running his hands through his dark hair in agitation.</p>
<p>“I have an idea, if you vould be opened to it” started Krum. “I could blood adopt you, I am of legal age so it vouldn’t be a problem and it vould make me your closest living relative so your custody and velfare fall to me.”</p>
<p>“So, you would be like my dad?” Harry asked, green eyes going wide as he stared up at Krum thinking about what it would mean to have a family.</p>
<p>Krum let out a small chuckle, “In a sense yes, but I vas thinking something more like a big brother, if you vould like that?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded vigorously, “I would like that,” Harry answered, entranced at the idea of having a brother. “But what about your parents, won’t they mind?”</p>
<p>“Harry, I have already spoken to my parents and they are in complete agreement with me. I have contacted Gringotts and they will assist us vith the ritual as well as the transfer of all your assets. You gather your things and be ready to move aboard the ship tomorrow night. Do not mention this to anyone until the blood adoption is completed and we are safely away.”</p>
<p>With a nod Harry walked back into the party excitement coursing through his body, he felt more alive than he had since he had been transported to the graveyard.</p>
<p>Krum turned and walked back towards Durmstrangs ship, he had much to do to prepare for Harry’s departure, but first he had to write to his parents and tell them to expect a new family member to be arriving with him.</p>
