  <strong>Merry Christmas, Here's the brief introduction for Christmas, expect more (eventually). This story will be a slower one, with shorter chapters, but never any with filler. All facts are important, so please correct me if I get anything different from canon.</strong>

<hr/><p>Intro Song: Resonance by T.M. Revolution [OP 1 of Soul Eater]</p><p>
  <em>Two become one our soul's have been connected</em><br/>
<em>A bond that's stronger than words</em><br/>
<em>And now in sync we scream our fates will come together</em><br/>
<em>And it will not go unheard</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Locking eyes becoming intertwined</em><br/>
<em>You'll be sharing your fate with mine</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Side by side we'll battle through the night</em><br/>
<em>And soon enough we'll find our way</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When the sun has set, we'll battle through nightmares</em><br/>
<em>We won't give up</em><br/>
<em>I will stay by your side as we slip into madness</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Two become one our soul's have been connected</em><br/>
<em>A bond that's stronger than words</em><br/>
<em>And now in sync we scream our fates will come together</em><br/>
<em>And it will not go unheard</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I-I-I could care less where it is you came from</em><br/>
<em>because we see what's waiting ahead</em>
</p><p>

<em>I'll be with you till the end</em>

<hr/><p><strong>(Narrator: Ozpin's Voice for this Chapter, much like 'The World of Remnant: The Maidens' Episode on Youtube)</strong><br/>
Once upon a time, in the deep forests of another world, known as Remnant, beside a great and mighty river, stood the small fragile home of a cold frail man-</p><p>A Lone Wizard. Hidden from the dangers and distractions of the world, the Wizard seldom had visitors. But one day as he peered out his window, his gaze fell upon a young maiden. His meeting of this maiden, as well as three others, led to a tale of grand adventures. It even led to him bestowing most of his magic upon the maidens so that they may spread joy and helpfulness among all of humanity. But before I can tell you that story, I must tell you this one...</p><p>Later, much later in his life, the Wizard was cursed by a witch. This witch was known as Salem, and had gained dominion over the creatures of darkness. The Grimm.</p><p>This was brought about by a fierce battle, one that waged for days, that brought both the powers of light, and the powers of darkness, both to a balance. In these moments, the Wizard sacrificed himself in a desperate attempt to end Salem.</p><p>He died, and his last sight was Salem casting a spell over him. He stabbed her, using his soul itself in a final blow. But it was not to be, and he passed into darkness.</p><p>
  <strong>{-_-_-_-_-_RWBY_-_-_-_-_-}</strong>
</p><p>Then he awoke. It was strange, the light was much too bright, and his clothes unfamiliar. He tried to move, but found he could not. His body was not his own, yet it was. He was trapped in the body of a young man, with similar eyes and hair to his own, but he had no control. Later on, he found that he was trapped within the mind of the boy, but could not speak or control the body at all. He followed the boy, unable to make contact, until one day, he found he could speak.</p><p>'<em>Hello?</em>' He asked, cautiously so as to not scare the young man.</p><p>"Hello? Who's there?" The young man asked, surprised to see no one there.</p><p>They introduced themselves, the boy being dubious in his belief at first, but warming up to the idea of a friend who would be with him through every hardship, no matter what. As their friendship increased, the Wizard found he had a semblance of control over the body, but only for periods of time when the host allowed it. Living through the boy's life, the Wizard was at peace. However, it is Fate's duty to make sure such peace cannot last forever.</p><p>It was later in the man's life that the Grimm arrived. Lead by a minion of Salem, they attacked the village where the man had been born. The wizard, still retaining his memories of combat, assisted the man in holding back the Grimm, yet again dying in the final fight.</p><p>
  <strong>{-_-_-_-_-_RWBY_-_-_-_-_-}</strong>
</p><p>Then he awoke. Yet again, he lived through another life, this time a boy from a very rich political family, and he lived many years. He learned good posture, manners, and business practices with the boy, all the while having to deal with assassination attempts from the opposing political parties. The Grimm were still around, and were a constant issue with the colonies. To bolster the weapons and resources of humanity, they eventually moved on to found a company for mining Dust, the Schnee company. Yet it was still not to be. One night they were slain by a Faunus, a minion of Salem, in a raid on one of the Dust warehouses. A stray shot hit a loose crate, ending the lives of everyone nearby. The Wizard barely survived, and lived long enough to see what would soon be the beginning of a discriminatory, racist movement against all Faunus.</p><p>
  <strong>{-_-_-_-_-_RWBY_-_-_-_-_-}</strong>
</p><p>Then he awoke again. By this point, his fate was secured. Now the Wizard was a farm girl, a boy who dreamed of being a soldier, a Faunus and many more. Over and over again, he was born, living with someone, two souls in one body, in one instant to another, each time making a blow against Salem's forces. The people he was always born into had the same mindset as him, always ending up facing Salem, time and time again. Salem never caught on that it was he who was opposing her, but rather many people, all working together. Finally, the Wizard had an idea. In his life, the one our story truly starts from, the Wizard was born in the body of a young boy named Ozpin in the city of Vale.</p>

  <strong>NN: By the way, check out the REMAKE of the 'Green Eyed Demon of Nazarick', which is now published separately from the original one! It has improved plot, romance (I hope), and makes more sense instead of me forcing the plot along like before. All other stories will be updated in due time over the next week, then another chapter of the remake.</strong>
