    <p>Chapter 1: </p><p> </p><p>Leaving the venue in panic was not unique to Black Widow, but she and Tony were here for a romantic trip and New Year's Eve in London. With her credit card in his wallet, she could kill the man with scattered black hair and hazel eyes in 17 different ways. But on this holiday she came for peace, she could not make a move that could get the Avengers group into trouble. They were already causing a few wreckage and confused media in every city they went to for duty.</p><p> </p><p>When she felt good - after a large serving of lunch and two glasses of wine - she told Tony about her chase yesterday and the strange bar she saw, then why suddenly she felt insecure at that bar because it was unusual. But she had instinctively escaped. Even though putting it into words makes it even more pointless – but that was the advantage of talking to Tony - Tony never made anyone feel stupid, he was well observing the woman in front of him with whiskey glasses (hard to believe, but the first glass) and brown eyes looking thru her soul.</p><p> </p><p>"My love, I had an idea. I wanted to show you the national museum, or the "Sherlock Holmes" museum. You choose, but I feel adventurous, why don't we go to that strange old bar today too? There is no match or party during the daytime. Have a nice beer, and we'll come back. "</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't a harmful idea, so they went out. When they got off the subway, the two little boys recognized Tony, and Tony took a photo with them.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you being this kindhearted."</p><p> </p><p>"You love my everything."</p><p> </p><p>"No, you are very wrong." Natasha was pointing the way and walking ahead, but now an ice cream counter was caught in her eye.</p><p> </p><p>"Sometimes you're too stubborn but I can tolerate it." she explained. </p><p> </p><p>"Our relationship continues thanks to my stubbornness."</p><p> </p><p>"Our relationship continues because there is mutual trust, love, and respect. What kind of ice cream do you eat?"</p><p>"Chocolate, vanilla, and almond. Stop, no, chocolate and almond. I don't want vanilla."</p><p> </p><p>Natasha took strawberry and chocolate too.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, our relationship is based on respect and trust. But do you love me?"</p><p> </p><p>"I hate you, Tony"</p><p> </p><p>"You're kidding. No, it's sarcasm. Haha, you're so in love with me."</p><p> </p><p>"Let's add that you ask questions you know the answer to."</p><p> </p><p>"Because I like to hear from you."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I love you. And I'm in love with you. Come on, let me declare this to all of London by shouting, like those crazy teens who are in love for the first time."</p><p> </p><p>"No, I believe you—"</p><p> </p><p>"I am in love with Tony!" cried Natasha, only three turned their heads.</p><p> </p><p>"Our identity will be exposed" Tony fake gasped. </p><p> </p><p>"You thought I couldn't say that?"</p><p> </p><p>"I never doubted. And I'm in love with you."</p><p> </p><p>While walking on the road, they continued to talk a little more, sometimes stopping and taking photos and selfies. They took each other like photo models in front of the doors of beautiful buildings. they ate each other's ice cream, they kissed a lot.</p><p> </p><p>- unaware of the two people watching them. -</p><p> </p><p>Although Natasha looked around because she had twice told Tony, "I think someone is watching us, let's continue to behave normally." no one was visible, the street was not crowded. If Natasha and Tony caught someone, it was impossible to get lost.</p><p> </p><p>They came up to the street where the bar was, and this time because it was not night and less crowded street, Natasha immediately saw it. The Leaky Cauldron. what a strange name.</p><p> </p><p>"The leaking Cauldron. Wow. I don't eat a plate of any products until the health ministry checks here," said Tony. He turned to his lover. "beer only"</p><p> </p><p>Natasha giggled. "Come on, let's go.”</p><p> </p><p>// \\</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean, the girl is back?” </p><p> </p><p>James couldn't believe what he had heard, right at the moment Percy was talking in his cape, holding the two-way mirror in his hand. To be honest, he was hissing like a serpent.</p><p> </p><p>"Tony fucking Stark. Man - James - we're screwed. We're over! Shit! Damn!" he was shaking visibly. Tonks was with him, trying to calm him down. James had to find a solution quickly.</p><p> </p><p>"Calm down, Percy. They'll hear you."</p><p> </p><p>"I can't stay calm. I am saying you 'Avengers', you old goat. Should I talk about Stark's armors or Captain's frisbee? And this girl - god, we're all fucked - this girl is Black Widow. Russian agent. We're ruined - "</p><p> </p><p>"Percy-"</p><p> </p><p>"You were going to erase the memory of that girl, man. She was standing next to you - this girl was a killing machine, and she was standing, you didn't need—"</p><p> </p><p>"Percy listen to me—"</p><p> </p><p>"You'd handle it with two words from your mouth. Shame on you, Potter."</p><p> </p><p>James thoughtfully took his head in his hands, Percy was watching him in the mirror, and Percy looked hopeless. Anxious Tonks stood beside Percy. The two friends had taken the invisibility cloak, and if the red-haired woman came back, they would deal with it.</p><p> </p><p>"If you do something? Make the girl forget it." still between his hands.</p><p> </p><p>"We can't get too close, James. She's the Black widow." Tonks answered.</p><p> </p><p>This had become very dangerous. James looked up and rubbed his eyes (he was without glasses)</p><p> </p><p>"Tonks, I will approach the girl and ask for the direction, and you do the memory spell." Percy expressed.  James had heard such a stupid idea before. It was not worth scolding Percy.</p><p> </p><p>"There's an Iron man with him. He was also her boyfriend." Tonks was partly excited to find some gossip. "It is inevitable for him  to attack us with different freaky powers to protect the girl"</p><p> </p><p>"Let's turn him to stone" Percy was in mode again.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, guys. I found the wat out. Nobody will turn into stone. Get away from there."</p><p> </p><p>"James-"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm on it, trust me."</p><p> </p><p>James broke the spell on mirrors, the meeting was over. What he was about to do required calmness and caution. It would be useful if he did not drink alcohol today. He reached over to his cell phone and dialed a number.</p><p> </p><p>"Good afternoon, Tom. I'm James Potter. Look, there are two people coming to your door - yeah yesterday -" he stopped, listening to the man on the phone.</p><p> </p><p>"Listen to me dickhead, do you want the Ministry to step in? Look at this serious and - never mind how I know - of course, I'm getting help."</p><p> </p><p>He sighed bored.</p><p> </p><p>"Look, just do what I'm going to say to you. Please. In return, I want you - okay, I'll let you take me to the cinema. Yeah, cartoons. You're a good guy. Okay. Now like this—"</p><p> </p><p>// \\</p><p> </p><p>Natasha and Tony were in front of the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>it was a really old building, even in ruins. When Natasha pushed the door, it did not open, she pulled it towards herself again, it did not open again.</p><p> </p><p>"If we open the door, it may fall on us. Jarvis, calculate the probability of building collapsing."</p><p> </p><p>"67.94232 percent, of course, I will have to access the image of the inside to get a clearer result, sir." Tony grinned and turned to Natasha.</p><p> </p><p>"Jarvis said 80 percent, my love. Come on Let's go to ‘Sherlock Holmes’."</p><p> </p><p>Natasha had knocked at the door in the meantime. "I hear footsteps, somebody will open."</p><p> </p><p>Indeed, the old door opened, there was an old man, and it looked as if it was dark inside and there was no light.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello, did you look at someone?"</p><p> </p><p>"Good afternoon, sir. My wife left her scarf here, last night. Normally I don't care, I'm a rich man, I would buy her a new one, but because she loves it - can we go in?" Tony smiled at the man opposite him. The man opened the door a little more, and in the darkness, it indeed looked like a bar.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, please enter. Cleaning is being done but now. The place is slippery, please be careful."</p><p> </p><p>There were two other employees inside, the chairs were upside down on the tables. They greeted their heads. Tony was watching around.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe the ministry of health joke was unnecessary. Look." he sniffed  "It smells of bleach."</p><p> </p><p>Natasha agreed, looking around. "I wish we had waited for the night to come"</p><p> </p><p>"It is the bar open, can we have two bottles of beer? Heineken please."</p><p> </p><p>The bar owner (or operator) nodded in the negative sense.</p><p> </p><p>"We have been renovating for weeks. We will be reopening after February. There are no products." He showed around. "Our preparations still continue for weeks."</p><p> </p><p>"Weeks? But -There were people here yesterday?"</p><p> </p><p>"Ma'am, we've been closed since October." the man was smiled. "In the meantime, architects come by and stop here. I thought you were one of them."</p><p> </p><p>Natasha was surprised. So Tony.</p><p> </p><p>"But how? There was a party here yesterday, I'm pretty sure." She still could not believe.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe it wasn't here and the night is dark, you know" Tony whispered to her.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not blind, darling. It was here. This bar." Natasha was so sure, but she couldn't explain. Even though this place is open yesterday, the party could not be held here like this, honestly. What was going on?</p><p> </p><p>"There are a lot of bars on this street." The old man was obviously trying to help, his tone was kind.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, we understand. Thank you very much. Good work - and your architect may also look at reinforcing the exterior." Tony tried to explain and resonate. </p><p> </p><p>"If we make a profit next year, that's my first plan." the old man said with a sincere smile.</p><p> </p><p>The couple, confused, stepped out of the same old door and stepped into the street.</p><p> </p><p>"what was that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Jetlag darling?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't make fun of me. I'm sure, I'm sure. But it doesn't make sense."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay. I'm telling my thought?" Tony turned Natasha, came face to face, and grabbed her elbows. Natasha also put her arms on the man's shoulder. Tony then hugged her waist.</p><p> </p><p>"Some mysteries remain a mystery. Should remain. If we tamper, sometimes - indeed - we get the answer. But such situations -" he pointed to the previous building with his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"- It can be. This is life. I know you want to get answers. You don't even understand why you're confused. But time is passing, our lives continue. Tomorrow this city - and even the world - will be fun celebrations. And Bucky is a fool. Forget it. Forget this bar. Focus on me. I love you so much. "</p><p> </p><p>"I love you too," said Natasha unknown the reason, she became emotional.</p><p> </p><p>They kissed. They looked at each other for two seconds and kissed again. They kept standing and kissing in the middle of the street, regardless of the cold weather.</p><p> </p><p>"I needed this a lot." Natasha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"Kiss? Always."</p><p> </p><p>"No, I mean that too" she chuckled. "- I needed to hear these words. You know me very well. You're always with me."</p><p> </p><p>"We are very good at fighting as a team, but we can sometimes lose individually in our own battles." Tony whispered confessed. Because it was the most changing among them. </p><p> </p><p>"If I have a person with me, it's not that bad, because I know there's someone who supports me. I want to be that person for you."</p><p> </p><p>"You are already."</p><p> </p><p>"And I always want to see you with me in my life. I will always support you and love you." This time Tony said a little louder. Oh - damn - he really hadn't planned that way. It should have been dinner and champagne. But there was no better time than that.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha was puzzled, right. Tony stopped hugging. He pulled out the ring box from his coat pocket. He would really do it - here - in this secluded, street.</p><p> </p><p>"Tony - this one"</p><p> </p><p>Tony was kneeling.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I know I've been rejected before, but—" oh otherwise, he shouldn't have said that. "I was that he was a little bit dreamy, I wasn't thinking properly. My thoughts at that time did not suit you. I also developed my perspective."</p><p> </p><p>"Tony, I don't know, you're a family guy."</p><p> </p><p>"No problem. We adopt children, adopt dogs and cats. Or none of them. Our lives are very similar. We understand each other's thoughts. We love each other, we make love very good. Also, we love to travel, and we expect the same from life. My heart already belongs to you -”</p><p> </p><p>"I know, I know, my love."</p><p> </p><p>"Will you marry me?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. yes, i will."</p><p> </p><p>Tony stood up, Natasha hugged him tightly. "I would never believe I'd say that, but I'll marry you."</p><p> </p><p>Tony could cry with happiness. "I am extra proud that you said that to me."</p><p> </p><p>Natasha grinned.</p><p> </p><p>While the two lovers were standing on the cheek, this time, moreover, they did not know about a man watching them without a cape.</p><p> </p><p>James Potter was observing that 'happy couple'. He understood that he was done there, took a cigarette box out of his pocket, burned one. As the nicotine reached his lungs, the tall red-haired man came up to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Tonks went home. Remus of course doesn't know." Percy explained.</p><p> </p><p>"It's better for him not to know." James agreed.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't understand. How does a witch girl not receive a letter? The Ministry of Magic never makes a mistake about it."</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me what you learned."</p><p> </p><p>"Natalia Alianovna " Natasha " Romanova. Born in 1982. One of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. Originally a KGB operative and dangerous assassin -"</p><p> </p><p>"I understand, it's enough."</p><p> </p><p>"You don't understand. I don't understand either. If she sees the Leaky Cauldron, she's either a witch or—"</p><p> </p><p>"Or what?"</p><p> </p><p>"Squibs can also see. If she was born in the wizard family."</p><p> </p><p>"It's a certain thing that was born in the family," said James. </p><p> </p><p>"Please do not report to the ministry of magic, James. Black widow's like that -" Percy swallowed "- things will get very messy."</p><p> </p><p>"I know, Percy. We'll look and research together, and we'll get the result."</p><p> </p><p>"I hope we can handle it without any damage," added Percy. The results of his research were not pleasant. This girl was already a killing machine. And with a wand, she would be damn invincible.</p>
