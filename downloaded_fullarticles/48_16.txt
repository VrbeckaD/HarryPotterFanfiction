  <strong>&amp;&amp;&amp; So, editing this... I'm taking matters in my own hands, kinda (?) Anyway, things are still on the air but I've decided to do it differently, just because I'm that nice. But if I don't receive at least ONE good response about this story, I will just take it out and the end. I mean, I'm going to write it anyway, but it will be just for me LOL (that sounds almost depressing uwu). </strong>
</p><p><strong>So, as I've mentioned,</strong> <strong>I have been doing for the past weeks in my Drive a story of Miraculous Ladybug using Hogwarts castle of Harry Potter as the place where they would end. In other words, they (MLB characters) won’t be wizards or anything like it and in most cases, I won't use too many Hogwarts characters unless I need them. In case you're wondering, my</strong> <strong>story goes from the last episode of the season 3 (so S3 E2). As you may know already (or not, who knows), I started a poll in fanfiction.net (you can find it in my bio) like around some days ago and I would love to know if you would want to read this story or not. If you have a fanfiction account, I would really appreciate of you to vote the poll, but in any case, if you don't have an account I can accept comments on what you think about this. I'll keep the poll for the whole month of February and, depending how well people has receive the idea, I'll either post or delete the story on 1st of March. That's all. Thank you all for your attention ^^ &amp;&amp;&amp;</strong></p>

  <b>「CHAPTER 1」</b>
</p><p>To say that the high school of Françoise Dupont was excited about this trip was an understatement.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, the school had gotten in touch with a school of London for an interchange program which consisted on passing half of the year there, while the other half the English students would have the opportunity to pass it in their school. It was completely incredible and everyone wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
Marinette would have loved to go but didn't sign it at first since Hawkmoth could attack Paris while they were gone and the people needed her here. And this had been her decision for a long peaceful week, with no signs of akumas or Hawkmoth, where she actually was half happy that at least she would have Adrien as company since for the moment it seemed that his schedule wouldn't let him go anywhere. However, two days before the list would be already accepted, Master Fu asked to have a meeting with her, as something had come up. It seemed that Hawkmoth had traveled all the way to the United Kingdom for some reason and this past week he had been terrorizing at least two cities.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sorry I didn't realize sooner he wasn't in Paris anymore, international news are not that easy to follow" he was apologizing "I will need in the end for you to go there and try to lure him back in Paris so he won't hurt more or other people."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, master, I understand" Marinette nodded "But I will have to talk to my parents. I've been telling them all this time that I didn't want to go so..."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sure you will figure something out. Be careful, Marinette" he smiled gently "Oh, and there might be a few surprises since I'm in no shape to be traveling so... You'll know when you see"<br/>
<br/>
That night, Marinette spoke long with her parents, trying to make some little excuses and, in the end, his parents ended agreeing with letting her go.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, she went to the board where the list to the exchanging was and put her name. When turning around, she squeaked when she saw that Adrien was behind her. He apologized profusely for scaring her and asked for the pen, saying that plans had been changed at last hour and that he could go. She obviously agreed and when having her pen back, she almost sighed in content.<br/>
<br/>
All the class was going, apparently, which was good. This was going to be a year to remember.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later, the day came and after flying for two hours in a plane that the mayor and the school provided, they arrived a few hours later at 10:30 at King's Cross, where they were supposed to meet with a representative of the other school. Madame Bustier, who had volunteered to go with them, tried to calm them down and, after a moment, everyone was silent with their suitcases in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay, I know we are all excited for this but please, put on the best behavior. We want to make a good impression, all right?" she said with a knowing look. After a few nods, she sighed "Okay, I'm going to do a few rounds on the station and see if I can find either the representative or if I will have to call him and see if they're going to run late. If the person or persons find you, Marinette you please call me to my number and I'll be here as soon as possible. Behave, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
She left them there and everyone started talking at the same time, though no one in the station really paid attention to the group of students.<br/>
<br/>
Marinette was paying half attention to his best friend and half not because she couldn't take her eyes out of the necklace (which she was hiding inside her shirt) that seemed to be hanging from her best friend's neck. She tried to focus on what Alya was talking, but her eyes drifted to Nino and saw the bracelet on his right hand covered by the rest of his wristbands and one looked at Chloé told her that she also had her hair comb, though she had been careful on covering it with her own sunglasses.<br/>
<br/>
'I guess this is the few surprises that Master Fu was talking about...' she thought 'I wonder if he also sent Chat Noir and if he's going to find us later...'<br/>
<br/>
Just at that moment, they saw a big man followed by a tall woman approaching them and noticing that they were going to them, they started to fell in silent. Marinette, biting her lip for a second, stepped up and decided to speak.<br/>
<br/>
"Uhm... Hello, we are the French students" she said it half-doubtful with her bad English accent but hoped she had made the sentence well, since Madame Bustier wasn't there in the moment and all of them had more or less the same level of English, even Adrien (though his was just a little better).<br/>
<br/>
"Nice meeting you all, but where is your headmistress? I thought she would accompany you" the old woman nodded patiently to her.<br/>
<br/>
"Head... headmistress?" Marinette asked, doubtful. Did they got confused and thought that the headmaster was now a woman? Or maybe they had forgotten? Well, it was the same "A-actually, a teacher decided to best accompany us since there is a lot of work in the school. I should probably call her, to tell her that they already have found us."<br/>
<br/>
She was going to reach for her bag at her hip, but the old woman just shook her head "No, don't worry. I'm sure Hagrid can find your teacher in no time and take her to the school via flu. We have to catch a train and we don't want you to be late." she said quite calm "Hagrid, do you think you will be able to find her?"<br/>
<br/>
'Flu? What the hell was that? Was that an acronym that English people had for another type of transport? Or another way to call in a colloquial way to some transport?'<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, sur' thing, professor" he replied.<br/>
<br/>
"Uhm..." Marinette took from her purse a photo she had taken from her own room of when they had taken a photo of all the class "She's this one" she pointed to her "she's called Madame Bustier"<br/>
<br/>
"Well, it shouldn't be to 'ard" he smiled gently "I guess yur a muggleborn, huh? Don't worry about it, yu will do great at Hogwarts too. I'll be back in no time, professor"<br/>
<br/>
'Mugg... what now? And Hogwarts? I'm sure the school was called another way...' she thought, arching an eyebrow.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, Hagrid. Now, please, all of you, follow me. We only have until 11 before the train leaves the station, so hurry up".<br/>
<br/>
Most of the class looked at Marinette, but she shrugged not knowing what to say and started to follow the professor, the rest of the class following them too. They finally reached towards the numbers nine and ten when the professor stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"The entrance is just this way. You have to cross through this wall, okay? Come on, after me, all of you will repeat the same, clear?"<br/>
<br/>
'Has she said crossed through or have I mistranslated that?' Marinette thought.<br/>
<br/>
But no, the professor actually answered by crossing the wall like it was air and all the class dropped their jaws to the ground. It must have taken a longer time that they thought because she was back and telling them to already pass through.<br/>
<br/>
When she disappeared again, all students kind of gathered for a few seconds but they knew that it would raise too many questions if they were already late again, so they decided to take turns and to pass through, Max saying that it was probably a prank of the school and that it was a simple trick of vision.<br/>
<br/>
No one wanted to say that there was no way it was what he had said, but decided to roll with it. Marinette was the first to pass through, trying to not think that she would maybe would hit the wall, but she walked through the wall like it had been air. Maybe Max was right.<br/>
<br/>
Before she could think even more, the rest of the students managed to pass through, Adrien practically carrying Chloé, but that was to be expected.<br/>
<br/>
The professor was already waving at them and telling them to step up in the train, so they went on inside without too many questions.<br/>
<br/>
Both Alya and Marinette went together into a wagon, the first one taking Nino and Adrien with her, which meant that both Chloé and Sabrina would be sitting all together.<br/>
<br/>
For Marinette, this scene was too weird since she knew that she was sharing a wagon with three other people that owned a miraculous. It was rare already that she was sharing a wagon with Chloé of all people.<br/>
<br/>
The professor of this school appeared at some point when they had been already half an hour riding in the train, telling them that the journey to the school would take four hours and a half, so they would reach at dinner time and that they could eat whatever they brought or take something.<br/>
<br/>
"The bathrooms are in the betweens and you should change to your blue robes before we stop" and she closed the door before Marinette could even form a word.<br/>
<br/>
There was a thick silence that passed through the six of them.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay," Alya said "I already thought it was weird to pass through a wall like nothing, but let's say Max was right. This doesn't explain how we are riding a train from, what? the Victorian age? And let's not add the thing that it takes a lot of time to reach to this school when I'm sure that it should be as much two hours, right? And what's that about blue robes?"<br/>
<br/>
"I have no idea, Alya" Marinette honestly said "But, maybe there is a good explanation for everything? Maybe the train was a thoughtful idea on having a better experience?" she shrugged sheepishly "And... the time maybe it's because this train would go slower than a normal one, right? And the robes... Maybe their school is more strict on clothes and you know blue is a very versatile color"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know, girl" she raised an eyebrow "This seems off, but... I hope you're right"<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, that's the spirit" she smiled "Anyway, I will go through the wagons to try to calm the rest and explain my theory and to split some treats that my parents made me take. I guess we should be thankful for that since we only have euros and Madame Bustier was in charge of changing our money so... That settles it." she took out from one of her bags a big box and divided the pie into pieces, giving one to Nino, Adrien, Alya, Sabrina... and gave one to Chloé, hesitant. She huffed, but took the piece anyway which was as good as it could be, she guessed "I'll be back in no time."<br/>
<br/>
She got out of the compartment and went wagon after wagon explaining her theory and sharing pieces with everyone, not counting Lila, who seemed to already have something for herself and "claimed" that she would have shared hers since she was that nice, but realized that it was maybe too small and she hadn't had her breakfast or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
'Seriously, this girl never stops or what?' she shook her head and decided, in the end, to go back into her wagon.<br/>
<br/>
She loved the idea of being in an old Victorian train, but she missed having TVs or something and she wanted to save battery for her phone to call her parents that night.<br/>
<br/>
After an hour and a half of talking of various topics from what type of school was this one to how the classes would be and what type of accommodations, they fell once again in a silent while they finished eating. Good thing, Nino decided to end it ten minutes later with some cards he had taken from home, just in case. So, they passed another hour playing various games of cards, sometimes betting money when playing Poker and Blackjack, but decided to stop after some point when Chloé groaned.<br/>
<br/>
"This is ridiculous! I hope Madame Bustier will be there tomorrow so I can complain about this travel arrangements!"<br/>
<br/>
Marinette hated to think this, but she had to give Chloé a point on this. This seemed too long for a journey, even in a really old train.<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe we should change to some blue robes, now that we have time" Marinette suggested, "We girls can do it first since we're more, and you boys change later?"<br/>
<br/>
"Sure thing, dudes!" Nino grinned "This man and myself will take some detour in the train and be back in half an hour?"<br/>
<br/>
Marinette nodded and all of the girls waited until they were gone to take out their bags and selected some blue clothing. They were more or less able to do it and in some cases, Marinette advised to use black. When they had finished, the guys had already knocked on the door and the girls went out, Marinette stating that she would give the same advice to the rest of the students.<br/>
<br/>
A few hours later, they were taken out by the English professor, presenting herself as McGonagall, and she hurried them to some carriages that were closed since it had started raining. They went inside in the same groups they had already made and fifteen minutes later, they were in front of an enormous castle. Before they could even begin to stare it, McGonagall told them to hurry before they catch something and they went inside the castle and followed her through the main stairs towards a big great door. She made three knocks on it before she opened both doors with her hands and carried the students inside, ignoring that the students behind her were looking towards the ceiling, the candles, the ghosts... wait, ghosts?<br/>
<br/>
Marinette glanced to Mylène who had gotten even closer to his boyfriend, saw Chloé grabbing Adrien's arm as if it was protection and some of the students made some noises of disbelief. Marinette grasped her both hands, trying to keep her nervous self in check.<br/>
<br/>
This was not normal school. She knew. But, how the hell they could get out of here without getting themselves maybe dead or something? She gulped, noticing the stern look of who seemed to be the headmaster. Oh goodness. They knew and they were going to die.<br/>
<br/>
But then he smiled "To our finest school in France, welcome to Hogwarts. As you may already know, I'm Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of this place" there was an erupt of cheers from the four tables which, Marinette noticed, had different color robes. She had been right on saying the clothing was more strict here "As part of your stay, and since it will be better for all of us, we have assigned that each of you will go to one of the four houses. Since we would prefer not to use the Sorting Hat, as you will be just here a few days, we have prepared something easier, which is an easy writing test. On the back you will also find the optatives you attend in your school; as you know, you have to take two as a minimum. Of course, write your full name in the top at the right. Everything understood?"<br/>
<br/>
Even though all of them were still processing the place they had gotten into, Marinette cleared her throat and decided to respond with a short 'yes, sir'.<br/>
<br/>
McGonagall gave the papers to everyone and said that now they could sit wherever they wanted to answer it and said that they had ten minutes. All of them realized that the first part looked like a personality test and the other side of the paper had subjects that no one had heard of, but in any way, they had decided to do it really fast and to choose two subjects that kind of called half their attention. When finishing, they got up and gave the papers back.<br/>
<br/>
The English teachers took like fifteen minutes in revising all and declared that they had already the results.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay," Dumbledore declared "I'll go from Hufflepuff towards Gryffindor. In Hufflepuff, you will have Mister Bruel, Ivan; Miss Haprèle, Mylène; Mister Lahiffe, Nino; and Miss Lavillant, Rose" the table at the farthest right started applauding and the ones called, shrugging, went to sit to that table "In Slytherin you'll have Misses Bourgeois, Chloé; Kubdel, Alix; and Rossi, Lila" the table next to Hufflepuff also applauded and the ones called made their way to that table, though not without huffing "In Ravenclaw, you'll have Miss Césaire, Alya; Mister Kanté, Max; Mister Kurtzberg, Nathaniel; and Miss Raincomprix, Sabrina" the second table at the left erupted in cheers. Alya squeezed tightly Marinette's hand before going with the other three towards that table. Marinette gulped noticing who she was going to be "And last, but not less important, in Gryffindors house you will have Mister Agreste, Adrien; Miss Couffaine, Juleka; Miss Dupain-Cheng, Marinette; and Mister Lê Chi ế n, Kim."<br/>
<br/>
The farthest table at the left erupted in cheers and they went to sit towards there. After the initial shock and all of what they had seen and were already seeing, they tried to listen towards what the headmaster was saying catching a few words like 'forbidding forest' and 'not enter' and 'no magic between classes and in halls'... All of the French students tried to appear as calm as possible but it was starting to be difficult and they had too many questions. They also heard Dumbledore saying to them that their accommodations will be in each of the houses they had been selected. In the end, they heard a 'let's eat' and food then appeared in front of everyone's dishes.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they could say without a doubt that they were not in France anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Though after taking dinner, all of the French would have liked to talk between themselves about this craziness, they had to follow different houses or groups, as most of them were thinking of them. Marinette glanced to Alya briefly and made some signs pointing to the schedule they had given to her and pointed towards the word 'Tuesday', signaling like that to talk tomorrow. Alya nodded to her and Marinette kept following the wave of students with red ties.<br/>
<br/>
The so-called prefects (all of them imagined it was another word for class representative or something like that) guided them towards their rooms, Juleka, and Marinette sleeping on the same one, seeing that their bags had been left there.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to go to bed yet and knowing that the past time was twelve, she left the room eagerly and after asking a few students, she went towards the girls' bathroom, checking first that there was no one (not even ghosts).<br/>
<br/>
"Oh my god. Oh my god. Tikki, please, tell me I'm dreaming" she freaked out.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm afraid you aren't, Marinette" she frowned.<br/>
<br/>
"Tikki, this school... Is magical. With wands and all that stuff. How the hell does this exist?"<br/>
<br/>
"Magic has always existed, Marinette," she said calmly "I kind of noticed a bit of magic on the wall we passed through and all of your classmates could go through because of us kwamis. I didn't want to tell you yet because, you see, the magic was too little and I thought I had imagined it. But well... After seeing this school... It's been a while since I have seen a magic school, though"<br/>
<br/>
"Tikki, we have to tell these people that they have taken the wrong people! What about Madame Bustier? Or the people that they were truly expecting?" Marinette looked pale.<br/>
<br/>
"Calm down, Marinette. Everything is going to be fine" she smiled "You're right, but we don't know yet which type of wizards are these ones. They could be a dark magic school and maybe they could hurt you if they figure out that you're not the ones they were expecting. Magic is a really dangerous subject and back in the days a lot of people used it to cause harm"<br/>
<br/>
"I guess you're right in that, but we have to find a solution while we investigate them. What if these people receive a message from the real students? And what about the magic? We don't perform any type of magic, not counting the ones that we have a miraculous"<br/>
<br/>
"I'll reunite with the other kwamis this night and discussed this, okay?" she reassured "We will figure something out"<br/>
<br/>
Marinette nodded to that and took a deep breath.<br/>
<br/>
"Thanks, Tikki."<br/>
<br/>
Tikki smiled at her and went again to her bag.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong>&amp;&amp;&amp; A little note on some things: Just in case you start saying things about where I put them... I actually made a test for like most of them so I could put them in a house. To be honest, I actually made three types of tests for 8 or 9 of them, mostly because some of them we don't see of them that much and it's difficult to guess them into a house. Why three? Just in case and because some of them I believe there were not good enough (we all know Pottermore is the best, but I wasn't going to make like who knows how many accounts).<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Anyway, what I was trying to say is that it was the tests in putting some people in some houses (especially our heroes -it was harder on Adrien because two of them he had a draw between houses and there was only one saying Gryffindor so... yeah-) and another some of them (like Alix -I'm sorry, honey-) which I put them there myself so it would be a fifty-fifty of classmates per house, just for writing purposes and it's easier for me in that way. Sorry they are not in what you would have put, I'll admit myself that I don't agree with them exactly (personally, Marinette either belongs in Hufflepuff or Slytherin for me), but it's what I'm working on. It's not like it will matter in the story because it's not centered on this. You will see if you want to still keep reading it. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Things are going to go down. Really down. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Thanks for reading and lots of kudos to all of you &lt;3 &amp;&amp;&amp;</strong>
