    <p>
  <span>“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!” Lily begged, tears rising in her eyes in frustration and fear. Her wand was downstairs, left behind in a flurry of panic, as she had rushed upstairs to grab Harry and apparate out of the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But she couldn’t apparate. Someone had set up an Anti-Apparition ward, which suggested that they had known their location for a while. So Peter was probably a traitor, James was probably dead, and she had no way to save her son.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stand aside.” Voldemort stood before her, wand held loosely in hand, ready to strike at any moment. His red eyes bore into her own, his face emotionless and all the more terrifying for it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Enough. Stand aside. There is no need for you to be hurt.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Stand aside? How could she leave her son? How could she watch as he </span>
  <em>
    <span>murdered her child.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not Harry! Please… have mercy… have mercy…” Lily started sobbing, choking out pleas, knowing it was useless, but needing to try. What else could she do?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She heard a sigh, and then knew nothing.</span>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom looked down at the unconscious form of Lily Potter, feeling a slight pang of respect. Even in the face of her demise, she chose to protect her son.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Walking over to the cradle in the room, Tom smiled as bright green eyes looked up at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, love.” The infant Harry gave him a gummy smile, and then with a swirl of magic, he was an adult again. Tom shifted into his own true form to match him, and with a laugh, embraced his husband.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He felt brush of lips against his ear, and heard a soft, whispered “Thank you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well I could hardly kill your mother,” Tom pulled back slightly so he could see Harry’s face, and reached up to brush his thumb across a freckled cheekbone. Harry smiled at him, and leans in to give him a kiss.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? You’re kissing </span>
  <em>
    <span>now?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> A flat tone interrupts the moment, and the two immortals look over to see Death leaning against the wall on the other side of the room. They’re dressed casually, in a short black sundress, with bare feet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry just rolls his eyes at them, and because he’s an instigating little shit, leans up to very obviously peck Tom on the cheek. Now it’s Death’s turn to roll their eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, are you ready to do this?” Harry asks Death, who straightens up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you’ve already sent out all the Grims?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you’ve collected the souls from the horcruxes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Master.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry pauses in his rambling and grins sheepishly at an amused Death. “I am ready.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, you are. I just, I want to make sure that you enjoy this. You only live your first life once, you know?” Harry says, which Tom has to smile and roll his eyes at, because he’s grown unspeakably fond of Harry’s nonsense in the eternity they’ve spent together.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Death smiled, small and joyful, coming over to them to hug Harry tightly. Tom stepped back slightly, but reached over and rested a hand on Death’s back. They looked over at him, and gave him a nod which he returned with a dip of his head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Harry, Tom.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No thanks are needed. We’re glad to help you, Thanatos.” Harry’s smile grew softer, and he stepped back and reached for Tom’s hand. Their fingers twined together automatically, and Tom began to channel his magic into their joined hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry lifts a hand, fingertips green with life and death magic, and places his hand on Death’s forehead.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I, Harry, give You, Thanatos, a mortal Life, to live as You so choose.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Death gives a happy sigh, dark eyes flashing, and then is gone; a baby with green eyes in his place. Lighting crests on his forehead, and Harry strokes it once with his hand, then lifts up Death and places him in the cradle. Tom uses the arm not around Harry’s waist to pat Death’s head, meeting the same green eyes that Harry has, but slightly darker.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know how to call us if you need our help.” Tom says, then lets go of Harry, moving back and fading from view, as downstairs, a faint cry of “James!” is heard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry stays next to the cradle a moment longer, one of Death’s small, chubby hands reaching up to grab Harry’s pinky finger. Smiling gently, the way Tom loves, Harry leans down to press a kiss against the new scar on Death’s forehead, and then fades from view himself. Even without vision, he finds his way to Tom unerringly, and they watch on as Sirius stumbles into the room, an unsteady James leaning on him. He cries out when he sees his wife laying on the ground, rushing to her and starting to cry when he realizes she’s still breathing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Death is just sitting there, staring at his new parents unblinkingly, and Tom wishes he could go over there and smack him because</span>
  <em>
    <span> that’s not how you act like a baby, Death.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry!” Lily is the first one to remember there’s a child in the room, and turns towards the cradle in panic, only to stop as she notices that somehow, someway, her child didn’t die. Heaving herself up, she runs frantic hands over Death, searching for injuries, and pausing as she finds the scar. She trades a look with James, who immediately tries to go off and call Dumbledore, only for Sirius to plop him down next to his wife with a mutter of “Oh hell no you aren’t, Prongs," and head off himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily and James share a moment of being desperately happy to be alive, and it’s around this time that they finally realize that their one year-old is staring at them with the emotionless face of an axe-murderer. Still not blinking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took them long enough.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They start talking to Death, trying to make him react to them, but he just…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Stares.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry is giggling next to Tom, having muffled their voices to outsiders, and being absolutely no help. Tom rolls his eyes and pinches his husband, making him yelp.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow, Tom. No need to get frisky now, we’ve got plenty of time later.” Harry waggles his eyebrows at Tom, with a completely ridiculous look on his face that definitely doesn’t make Tom’s chest feel warm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rolling his eyes, Tom reaches for the balance of Light and Dark magic inside him, bringing the Dark forward and pulling the shadows around him and Harry. When the shadows disperse, they’re in a place they both know well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Atlantis?” Harry says in disbelief. “I know you were gonna rebuild it this time around, but couldn’t that have waited till tomorrow? We could be in the Caribbean right now, having sex in the ocean!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom rolls his eyes, tuning out Harry as he started on a tirade about various places that they could have been at, and starts to appraise this time period’s Atlantis.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both him and Harry had lived various lives during Atlantis’s prime, but that was thousands of years ago. The once great citadel had crumbled into rubble, a skeleton of metal and stone that only barely resembled the gleaming city that had once been their home. It would take years, and no small amount of labor and magic to get it back into something that Tom would feel satisfied with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But first…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Grabbing Harry’s wrists in his hand, his arm sweeping around his waist, Tom turns them around and presses his husband into one of the flat pieces of rubble that were scattered around.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How about, instead of going somewhere else and making love to one another, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> you into the remains of these stone walls until you can’t remember your own name, </span>
  <em>
    <span>my beloved.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Being this close to Harry, Tom can see his eyes widen and his pupils dilate; can see the tongue that darts out to wet his lips, and the way his Adam’s apple bobs as he swallows.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Smirking, Tom leans in, as if he’s going to kiss Harry, whose eyes close and lips part. And then backs off completely; letting go of Harry and walking away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course if you’d rather go to the Caribbean, then I suppose I can hardly stop you--” Tom goes down laughing as Harry tackles him to the ground.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They don’t end up going anywhere for the rest of the night.</span>
