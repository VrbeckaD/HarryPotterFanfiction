Two in London, one in Ilkley. When Hermione took over the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, equal rights were guaranteed to all the belonging species, including lawful protection, and it <em> is </em> a marvelous thing… Except for when Harry is forced to decipher his own writing from when he probably was too in a rush to muster something more legible.<br/><br/>Harry’s living room is quiet, just until it is not.</p><p>"Are you talking to yourself again? Have you finally gone crazy?"</p><p>He sighs and folds the file.<br/><br/>"If I tell you for the ninety-seventh time that I'm reading out loud, will you stop asking me the same question at least once a week?" he responds and takes his glasses off.<br/>He presses two fingers to the sides of his nose where the glasses always leave two dark, oval marks, and then glances up.<br/>"And I don't think I like the slight tinge of hope in your voice when you accuse me of being crazy," he says, but his irritation is a mere act.<br/><br/>Harry is calmer now, compared to his on-edge, seventeen-year-old self. He has long overcome the prejudices that were fundamental to his juvenile perception of morality. Maybe it had something to do with the fact he took the <em> Avada Kedavra </em> for them all to live. Or maybe it was all those times he hated himself for living, because they died instead.</p><p>"I've always known it was inevitable. And I like being right," Draco responds, shrugging. He has two cups of tea in his hands. He holds one of them out and places it in front of Harry.</p><p>Harry never asks Draco to make him tea, but Draco always does.</p><p>He puts his glasses back on and gives Draco a little smile, but the blond man doesn't see it, because he's busying himself with finding the right position in that old, hideous armchair that's in front of the fireplace in Harry's living room.<br/><br/>Harry cannot understand why Draco likes it the most. He brought it from Grimmauld Place when Sirius' loss stopped being a gaping hole that took every piece of Harry's chest, bit by bit, until it had taken his heart too.<br/>Now there is just an ugly, misshaped scar, and it’s not like the one cleanly cut Harry has on his forehead. Sometimes, it makes Harry think of Bill’s face.</p><p>"How was work?" Harry asks, regarding Draco from his own armchair as he picks up the mug, but he forgets to cast an <em> Impervius </em> on his glasses again; they immediately cloud over with steam.<br/><br/>The man in front of him sighs and briefly flicks his wand. The spell is quick enough; it allows Harry to catch the patronizing look on Draco's face just in time.<br/>Harry likes that look. It's the closest to fondness that Draco ever shows in every-day situations. He knows that because he's spent the last seven years discreetly cataloguing all the small muscle movements that make up Draco's features. He likes it most when Draco smiles, though. It doesn't occur often, not anymore, but it's worth the wait. And then Draco smiles only to a handful of people, and Harry is amongst them.<br/><br/>There is a scar inside his chest, but Harry’s heart has come back. Otherwise, Harry couldn't have surrendered it to Draco, because he owns nothing else worth giving after the War. Not that his friend knows that, obviously. Some things are better left unspoken.</p><p>“Utterly and disappointingly uneventful for the past week," Draco responds, leaning back and closing his eyes. He's grown into a fine man, by every standard － his slender silhouette is currently stretched in the armchair with his right leg crossed over the left, and the mug with that aromatic tea Draco keeps in a tin in one of Harry’s cupboards is perched on his knee.<br/><br/>Harry glances at the graceful hand that wraps the cup as if it’s not scorching hot. </p><p>He once asked Draco which spell he used to thermally isolate the porcelain of his mug.<br/>Draco responded that there was no need for such a spell; that his left hand long lost its ability to feel the heat.<br/>Harry never asked when. He knows it was since Draco was sixteen.</p><p>"Snape's going too easy on you," he responds teasingly.</p><p>"He is still furious about the fact that I decided to finally scrape that musty, old paint from his frame. I don't understand how he cannot see that the one I've chosen clearly suits him better," Draco says with exasperation. He doesn’t bother opening his eyelids, underlined by deep, shadowy circles as they are. That's for the better; Harry can openly look at him without being met by his questioning eyes.<br/>It has only happened once, but it was one time too many. Harry's not going to risk it.</p><p>"I think he's angry because he had to spend one week in his other portrait," Harry responds and leans forward.<br/>"You know, the one in Minerva's office beside Headmistress Dylis and her unusually thick wand." He lets a small smile stretch his lips.<br/>He heard that Dumbledore asked Minerva to change the position of the painting when Harry wrote her about the renovations of the other portrait. The old man is still a menace.</p><p>He ignores the clench of nostalgia while Draco opens one eye and looks at Harry lazily.</p><p>"Nothing goes amiss by the Gryffindor extraordinaire, hm? You've always been McGonagall's favorite," he says as he closes his eyes again, but there's no jealousy in his voice. "You weren't even that good at Transfiguration. Your narrowness of mind has always prevented you from seeing the depths of transmutation."<br/>He takes one sip of his tea, then. Always one at a time, never more. Not even when the tea loses its mouth-burning heat and is at the perfect temperature to be enjoyed fully. Harry guesses that some Pureblood habits die hard.</p><p>He lightly kicks one of Draco's long shins.</p><p>"Says the one who’s got a deceased Potion Master as a collaborator," he says, smiling when Draco looks at him indignantly and dusts off a non-existent patch of dirt from his black, tailored trousers. "Really, I still can't wrap my little, narrow mind around the fact that you've convinced him to work with you," Harry adds, shaking his head a bit. Draco's dark grey eyes are both fixed on Harry's green ones. The blonde arches his left, sharp brow in a gesture so familiar that Harry's chest feels tight for a moment. "Snape's affinity for teaching and collaborating is comparable to how he felt about shampooing during school days," Harry concludes and a smug smile lightens his face as he avoids Draco's pointy shoe.</p><p>"I will not have you disrespect our greatest Professor," Draco says haughtily, but it's Harry's turn to look at him with an arched brow. The corner of Draco’s mouth quirks up, "I guess he could've washed his hair more often".</p><p>Harry lets out a full smile.</p><p>The flickering light from the remains of wood in the fireplace tint Draco's platinum hair an ember color. He brushes away a strand of hair that has escaped his ponytail with long fingers.</p><p>Some people think Draco looks like Lucius. To Harry, he looks breathtakingly, just like Narcissa.</p><p>Harry casts a non-verbal <em> Wingardium Leviosa </em> with a twitch of his wand and another log makes its way to the fireplace.<br/>Sometimes, the flames remind him of the Fiendfyre and about Crabbe's terror-filled eyes. But when they shine on Draco, they remind him of Christmas at the Burrow.<br/>They remind him of home.</p><p>Harry unfolds the file again. The involved Aurors consider the cases of smuggling as two separate ones, as it is common for the black market to be powered by inimitable handiwork, but to Harry, some details make them look connected. He, however, does not get to read even a line; he gasps as the file is snatched from his hands and watches as it lands graciously on Draco's outstretched palm.</p><p>"No working at home, Potter, we've been through this," he says briefly, his voice bearing no argument.</p><p>As if Harry could deny him anything.</p><p>He stands up.</p><p>"Have you eaten dinner?" he asks, daring a glance at Draco's frame. He's always been thin, but never skinny. However, Harry knows that the circles under his eyes mean that he's forgotten to eat again.</p><p>"Why would I, when I know that you've prepared a portion too big for yourself yet again?" he asks with nonchalance, but he is already leaning forward with anticipation. "Honestly, Potter, one would think you'd have managed to grasp the limits of your almost bottomless stomach by now."</p><p>Harry faces the kitchen and smiles to himself. He's been preparing two portions since the one evening when Draco stepped out of his fireplace, his hazy grey eyes looking around for him.</p><p>Harry still remembers the relief he saw in them when Draco found him in the living room. The blond man nodded at him and then simply let himself fall. Harry barely managed to summon some cushions under him before he hit the floor. He had been working on yet another Ministry assignment and hadn’t eaten nor slept in two days.<br/><br/>The Ministry has never stopped trying to make him pay for the crimes he committed.<br/><br/>Harry despises them.</p><p>"I hope that mashed potatoes are good enough for your refined palate," is the only thing he says as he casts a quick, weak <em> Incendio </em> to awake the flame under the pot.</p><p>"With ham?" Draco asks with cool voice, but Harry hears the hope lingering in his tone.</p><p>Of course he’s added ham.</p><p>"And that goat cheese with a strange, French name you brought over when you found out that I only have Cheddar," he says, glancing behind his shoulder. His breath gets caught in his lungs as Draco looks at him with a full smile on his lips.</p><p>"I cannot be seen with somebody who willingly chooses to eat such gruesome dairy product."<br/><br/>The smile even reaches his eyes.</p><p>-</p><p>When Draco leaves, Harry dreams about that night in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>__________________•___________________</p><p> </p><p>"Merlin, Potter, you look like that time I tried to sell you out to Snakeface. Stop moping or you'll ruin my image, since we must be seen in the same limited space for prolonged amounts of time.”</p><p>Harry sighs and lifts his eyes to look at Pansy Parkinson, who is tapping at his desk with her perfectly manicured, black nails in her perfectly tailored, black suit.</p><p>He and Pansy have been working together for almost four years now.<br/>There had been an open position for a consulting expert in Dark Artifacts; it was a part of Harry's division, so they let him pick one of the applicants.<br/>He chose Pansy simply because she had been at the top of the list, even after Ron looked at him with his big, surprised, blue eyes and Hermione told him she would stop dropping by his office so often. She still comes twice a week, though.</p><p>During the last four years, Harry and Pansy's mutual dislike has changed into something resembling respect and then into something resembling friendship, if one's idea of friendship is made of weak insults, long evenings at the Bureau and a shared distaste for any kind of beverage served in their quarters.</p><p>Pansy is sharp, rational, and tired of everyone's bullshit. Others still look at her like she's inferior, but she doesn't care. If she does, she hides it well, and that is a quality Harry can relate to.<br/>Maybe that's why they get along so well, but he's never given it much thought. Pansy doesn't know about Draco.</p><p>"If this is your way of saying <em> hi</em>, Parkinson, then I guess shyness and trust issues are not the real reasons why you're single," he responds, but he doesn't put much effort into sounding mean.</p><p>Pansy doesn't even bat an eye. She just stares at him some more. She does that when she's being purposeful.</p><p>"Ehm," Harry clears his throat pointedly, at a loss for anything to say.</p><p>Pansy snorts.<br/>"So eloquent. I've always wondered how you've managed to be everyone's favorite with such a restricted vocabulary, but I guess it was just your martyr complex."</p><p>She proceeds to look at herself critically in an old, wooden mirror on the opposite side of Harry's desk, touching her short, meticulously cut black hair.</p><p>"Do you realize that the mirror isn't here for your vanity?" Harry sighs. "That is a very rare piece of Auror equipment. It shows those who wish you ill and therefore are your enemies."<br/><br/>He had gotten that mirror from Kingsley. It had been the fifth anniversary of Alastor's death.</p><p>"You're no fun. I don't even know why I spend time with you," she says, turning towards him. Before Harry can come up with a proper response, she adds, "and if you say something you think is funny, but it really isn’t, like <em> 'we work together,' </em> then I guess you'll be hearing the scoop from the cleaning staff.”</p><p>Harry sighs once more. He still has hours of work to do and he'll have to skip lunch if he wants to get home in time to cook dinner for Draco.<br/>He gathers his thoughts.<br/><br/>The sooner he listens to what Pansy has to say, the sooner he'll be able to come back to the Pile of Doom that lays menacingly in the corner of his desk.</p><p>He tries to muster a curious expression.</p><p>"You look like something's hurting you. Beside your existence, of course,” Pansy says and sits on his desk. The Slytherins truly like the dramatics.</p><p>"I've heard from a very reliable and legal source..." she starts, but Harry looks at her with disbelief. "It was Blaise," she rolls her eyes, "and stop interrupting me".<br/>Harry's eyes try to express an '<em>I didn't even speak,</em>' but Pansy chooses to ignore him in in favor of revealing the gossip. "Old Fairburn's almost burnt down half of the Department of Mysteries".</p><p>Harry tilts his head.</p><p>"They say he breathed too much Draught of Madness and convinced himself he was a Salamander. He tried to summon his birth fire to fully become one," she says with a sharp grin.</p><p>Harry laughs, taking his glasses off and casting a quick <em> Scourgify</em>. This is a nice one.</p><p>"So that's what they've been doing down there. I wondered why Luna reeked of aconite the last time I saw her."</p><p>Aconite flowers are the main ingredients of the Wolfsbane Potion. At some point, people discovered that the leaves, a previously discarded part of the plant, heavily affected human behavior if properly prepared. The Draught of Madness has been the Aurors' nightmare for quite some time. Some call it the ‘Liquid Imperius.’</p><p>There's no accurate method to verify whether people's insanity is artificial or not when they commit a crime. Veritaserum is pointless when it comes to memories twisted by madness.<br/>Crazy people believe they speak the truth, because there's nothing else but their own thoughts to believe in. Those people are usually sent to Saint Mungo's. Harry can't understand why. Azkaban makes you go crazy anyway.</p><p>"They could just shove a bezoar down their throats," he murmurs to himself.</p><p>Pansy's expression shifts to an undignified one as she speaks with superiority.<br/>"Just because you saved Weasel that way, oh Big Saviour of the Ginger and Oppressed, it doesn't mean you can use that goat stone on everything."</p><p>“That's right, Harry. I don't know how can't you remember that a bezoar is a common antidote for common potions. The Draught of Madness surely doesn't belong to that category."</p><p>Harry and Pansy turn as Hermione enters the office, carrying two steaming cups.</p><p>She eyes Harry's desk with exasperation and puts the cups on the only piece of surface not covered by parchments.</p><p>Harry smells Fortescue's coffee.<br/>He always drinks coffee, except for when Draco brews him tea.</p><p>"Where's my coffee?" Pansy says, offended.</p><p>"You don't even drink caffeine, and I won't bring you something with high percentage of alcohol during work hours," Hermione replies, tugging a strand of her curly hair behind her ear. Pansy rolls her eyes and says something that sounds like <em> 'that red dress' </em> and <em> 'over my dead body' </em> under her breath.</p><p>Hermione ignores her.</p><p>She takes another look at Harry's desk, sighs and flicks her wand. All the parchments align and start to flow one over another in a strange pattern.</p><p>"They're organizing themselves chronologically," she explains, summoning a comfortable looking chair as she starts sipping on her coffee.</p><p>"I don't deserve you, Hermione," Harry says, giving her a grateful smile. He's lost count of the times she's saved his life, figuratively and literally.</p><p>Hermione gives him an amused look and opens her purse, retrieving an envelope.</p><p>"You can start deserving me by agreeing to show your pretty face at this event," she says as she slides the envelope in his direction.<br/>She knows Harry hates to attend public events, yet it seems that she's evaluated this particular one as important.</p><p>He glances hesitantly at the wax seal. It bears the Bones' family crest.</p><p>"It's the annual Amelia Bones Charity Dinner," Hermione says, but she must've seen the flick of recognition in Harry's eyes. Ah, the Wizarding World and its always-present acronyms.</p><p>Harry nurtures a deep respect for Mrs. Bones. She helped him at his trial, when all the others had turned their backs, and she has continued to fight until the very end. She was a brave woman.<br/>There are not enough people like her, not after fifteen years, when the grief has been numbed and the unity that was pushed so hard is beginning to strain again.</p><p>Harry already knows that he will go.</p><p>"There have been a lot of sponsors this year, since it's so close to Christmas," she says, her clever, brown eyes sparkling as she looks at Harry. Harry breaks the seal and retrieves the invitation. Under all the usual formalities, a long list of names extends to the end of the parchment. <em> 'Malfoy' </em> figures as the first one. Harry arches an eyebrow as he meets her eyes. Hermione smiles smugly in response. "You know I play dirty, Harry," she murmurs only for the two of them to hear. She's always been too perceptive for Harry's own good.</p><p>"I'll be there too, obviously, so you'll be able to bask in my marvelous presence," Pansy adds as if it closes the case.</p><p>Harry smiles a bit. She reminds him of Draco.</p><p>__________________•___________________</p><p> </p><p>Harry is unpacking the groceries. There are some tasks he likes to perform manually, without magic. He likes to fill the shelves with food by hand. Somehow, it fills the void that was formed inside him when he was kept at Privet Drive, his stomach always empty and his heart always in his throat.</p><p>The door to his apartment opens.<br/>The wards are designed to let in only a small number of people, but he still isn't expecting anyone at this hour.</p><p>Harry glances behind his shoulder, because he's able to see the door from the kitchen. Actually, he's able to see the whole apartment, since he's insisted on a completely open space.</p><p>Draco stands in the doorway, looking at him, but not taking off his cloak. Except, he always takes it off. Harry's stomach drops. Maybe Draco has finally seen that Harry's not worth his time, that he'll never be, because he's lost too much too soon.</p><p>"The snow has fallen in Saltwick Bay," the blond says, looking at Harry expectantly.</p><p>Harry hides his face in the cabinets before it reveals his relief.<br/>"Just give me a second, I'm almost done," he responds. He closes his eyes and breaths out. Draco is not going to leave him.</p><p>It's incredible, really, that for a man who doesn't like the cold, Draco waits for the snow to fall with unspoken anticipation every year.</p><p>"Let me firecall Ron and Hermione and we can go," Harry says, exiting the kitchen and going for the fireplace. "Have you told Pansy and Greg?" he asks, reaching for the dark powder. It's been their tradition for eight years, now. Or maybe seven...<br/>Yes, definitely seven, Harry scolds himself. Seven years ago, on the Night of the First Snow, he realized he loved Draco Malfoy. It's not a thing to forget.</p><p>"No," Draco responds. Harry turns around and looks at him, surprised.</p><p>"We'll tell them tomorrow," he says, dismissively. "Now move, or it will melt before we get there."</p><p>Draco is not a patient person when it comes to things unrelated to his work.</p><p>"Can I at least put my jacket on? Or do you want me to get bronchitis?" Harry asks, rolling his eyes to mask his perplexity.</p><p>"I don't know what a bronchitis is, but I'm sure I've got a potion for it somewhere, so stop being difficult and come," Draco responds, tapping his foot impatiently.</p><p>Harry looks at him sternly. He is <em> not </em> the difficult one.</p><p>Draco is able to understand his expressive eye language, but there isn't an ounce of self-consciousness on his face, so Harry just puts his jacket on and steps out of his apartment.</p><p>Draco closes the door and takes something out of his breast-pocket.<br/>"Heads or tails?"</p><p>Harry sighs. He always loses.<br/>"Tails."</p><p>Draco throws the galleon and when it touches his gloved hand, he swiftly covers it with the other.<br/>His grey eyes meet Harry's. In the dark of the corridor, they look like the sky during a thunderstorm. He uncovers the coin and glances down.</p><p>"It's tails indeed, Potter," he says with amusement, and Harry's eyes widen.</p><p>Harry thinks it's going to be an unusual evening, as he takes Draco by his forearm and spins.</p><p>-</p><p>He <em> apparates </em>them right beside the shipwreck.</p><p>A thin layer of snow is covering the rocks under their boots and the remains of the ship, crackling under their weight.<br/>It's late November and it's evening, so it’s just the two of them, and the rocks and the sea.</p><p>Harry shivers, but he doesn't want to cast a warming charm. It numbs the feeling of the snowflakes melting on his skin.<br/>He breaths in the cold air, even if it makes his throat burn.<br/>The place is the same as it was the first time they set foot on these rocks.</p><p>Harry lets himself remember.</p><p>That evening, they had had dinner at his place.<br/>He remembers the heat of the burners, his kitchen full of scents of a dish he can't quite recall. He remembers Draco, Pansy and Greg by the fireplace, gossiping about yet another Pureblood marriage. He remembers the hugs during the dessert, when Hermione announced her pregnancy, Ron proud by her side.</p><p>God, Harry had been so drunk.</p><p>At some point, he firmly decided that he wanted to see, but when the others have asked him '<em>to see what? </em>' he hadn't been sure. He said that he wanted to finally look at something different than London, different than Hogsmeade, and different than that god-damned Ministry.<br/>And maybe Ron and Pansy had been drunk too, because Pansy summoned a map of England and Ron poked it blindly with his wand, leaving a small, burnt circle where Saltwick Bay was.</p><p>That evening, Draco forced Harry to let him <em> apparate </em>them by betting on a coin.<br/>Harry lost. Or maybe he hadn't, now that he thinks of it, but his mind is too hazy.<br/>It doesn't matter, though, because when they landed, Harry reached out to Draco’s arm for support. What he found had been Draco's face instead, wonder reflected in its every line.<br/>His cheeks were pink from the cold and gold from the ray of the lighthouse.<br/>It must've been windy, because Draco's hair escaped the ribbon and got tangled in his long, dark lashes. And then snowflakes hit his face and Draco's smiled.</p><p>His grey eyes looked out for something, or perhaps nothing at the same time.</p><p>And Harry loved him.</p><p>"It's beautiful," Draco says, his breath escaping his lips in a white puff.</p><p>'<em>You're beautiful,</em>' Harry thinks, but he doesn't voice it. It's not important in the greater scheme of things.<br/>"As always," he responds to Draco and to himself, letting his eyes assess the breathtaking surroundings. He looks for a horizon that's not there, because it melted with the edge of the sea when the sun set.</p><p>What Harry likes the most, though, is the contrast between the white in the air and the black in the water. The snowflakes spin in the air, carried by the breeze, and their crystalline structures reflect the ray of the lighthouse, making them sparkle.</p><p>Harry can't look enough.</p><p>Then, a snowball hits him right on the nose.</p><p>"You sucker! What was that for?" he shouts, trying to get the snow off of his glasses.</p><p>"That concentrated look on your face was unsettling. I'm not used to seeing you think," Draco says and makes a vague gesture with his hands, but Harry can see that he's holding another snowball.</p><p>"Very funny, Malfoy," Harry responds as a mischievous smile stretches his lips. Draco doesn't stand a chance against him and training he received from the Weasley twins. "It's a war," he says, ducking to the left before the second snowball hits him.</p><p>"You'll always be my greatest opponent," Draco says, looking him in the eyes. There's something in this statement Harry can't quite put his finger on, but before he can give it more thought, his snowball hits Draco on the back of his head.</p><p>"Using magic?" Draco's voice is low with anticipation as he makes the snow vanish before it gets under his coat.</p><p>"You're such a Slytherin," he shakes his head a bit and smirks.</p><p>Harry stands still, waiting for the blonde's next move.<br/>"Well, the Sorting Hat did want to put me there," he says, and when Draco's lips part in disbelief, he seizes the opportunity to summon another snowball. With a Malfoy there is no playing by the rules.</p><p>He might've underestimated Draco, because as soon as the blonde sees the snowball with the corner of his eye, he smirks again and spins.</p><p>Harry's got less than a second to react, because Draco is behind him, his wand out and a block of snow as big as a car over Harry's head.<br/>The moment the snow falls, Draco <em> disapparates </em>again and so does Harry.</p><p>They reappear at the two opposite sides of the shipwreck.</p><p>"You never told me," Draco says, his tone as patronizing as always. Translated from Malfoy to English, it probably means ‘<em>I would've liked it if you told me.’ </em></p><p>"You never asked," Harry responds, smiling, because he loves Draco with every fiber of his body and because a quick, non-verbal <em> Ventus </em> makes the snow from the shipwreck hit Draco in the face.</p><p>His victory is short-lived because Draco is suddenly beside him with a loud crack a second later and Harry avoids being tackled by pure luck and his Seeker's reflexes.</p><p>Harry is instinctive where Draco is calculating, so the blond man guesses his next apparition positions almost every time, not giving Harry a moment to break.<br/>Their fight is a spiral of bodies that vanish only to reappear, flashes of light when the spells are used and snow everywhere, laying, rising, and falling.<br/><br/>Before Harry knows it, his cheeks are flushed, his head is spinning and his chest is full of joy.<br/>Draco misses him with a <em> Levicorpus </em> by millimeters and Harry scoots left, putting up his wand and shouting,<br/>"<em>Tarantal </em> -" But he never gets to finish, because the foot he lands on stomps on ice and not on rock. '<em>That bastard's managed to cast a </em>Glacius,' Harry thinks as he goes down hard.</p><p>He doesn't get the chance to stand up, because after a blink Draco is kneeling beside him with a hand on Harry's chest and the wand at his throat.</p><p>"Guess I've won," he says, smiling fully, and his eyes sparkle.<br/>His cheeks and his nose are pink and his hair falls gently on his face, the ponytail long unbounded.<br/>He's breathing hard, but he lets a small chuckle escape his lips as he tries to shake the hair from his eyes in vain.</p><p>Harry realizes that Draco's face is close. He can see the variation of grey in his eyes.<br/>Draco's hand is pressing strongly at the center of his chest and Harry has to move before Draco feels his heart hammering in his chest or before he does something very stupid, like saying <em>'I</em><em> love you.</em>'</p><p>Putting his feelings in a far corner of his mind with practiced skill, he grips Draco's wrists and spins, using the momentum to make Draco lose his balance. The blond man falls on his side with a quiet thump.</p><p>"Constant vigilance, Malfoy," Harry says and smiles, looking at Draco's indignant expression. "Guess it's a draw, after all."</p><p>"You wish, four eyes! I'll get you when you'll least expect it," Draco spats, but he can't fight the smile that lightens his face again. He turns to lay on his back and glances at the sky.</p><p>There's snow on the ground, in Draco's hair and in his eyelashes, and it paints everything white.<br/>Harry allows himself to drink the view just for a moment.<br/>Like this, Draco makes him think about the white mist at King's Cross that embraced him when the green curse hit his heart.<br/>Harry felt at peace then and he feels at peace now, because there are no scraps of Voldemort under the bench.<br/>No, there is just Draco now, right beside him.<br/>Harry doesn't have to decide. He won't take the train to move on, but he doesn't want to go back either.<br/>He is content to sit in the middle, where he can love Draco from the quietness of his mind.</p><p>"Tea?" Draco asks and turns his head to look at Harry.</p><p>Harry nods and, just like that, they go back home.</p><p>__________________•___________________</p><p> </p><p>That night, Harry dreams.</p><p>He dreams that he's laying down on his stomach, his cheek on a pillow.<br/>There's a hand entangled in his hair; it presses his head down.<br/>His own hands are held in a strong grip behind his back and his legs are held down by the weight of another body kneeling on top of him, calves pressing on each side of Harry's thighs.</p><p>He's feverish with anticipation. He knows what is going to come.</p><p>He shivers as the body leans forward and long hair tickle the base of his neck.</p><p>He feels a breath ghost across his skin and he pants when a mouth meets his neck, hot and open, pressing a long, wet kiss right below his hairline. A quiet moan escapes his lips.<br/>He wants to turn around, to capture that sweet mouth with his own lips, but the hand tugs at his hair and prevents Harry's head from turning.<br/>The pull is even more arousing.</p><p>One strong calf aligns with his own as the body half-lays down and Harry can't stop his lower back from arching. He wants to feel naked skin on his own.<br/>His ass is met by a long, hot hardness. Harry presses back against it harder, moaning again.<br/>A name escapes his lips as platinum strands fall on his face.</p><p>"Draco."</p><p>Draco's mouth moves from the pulse below Harry's ear; it caresses his earlobe as the blonde murmurs, "Shh." They're not to be heard.</p><p>Then, Draco starts moving.</p><p>With every thrust, his erection rubs against Harry's crack and its tip touches his immobilized hands. It's already wet.<br/>Harry bites his lip to stay quiet, but his body moves with Draco's and his own erection slides on the covers.</p><p>Draco is panting.<br/>His forehead meets Harry's temple as his hand loosens its grip on Harry's hair. Draco places it by Harry's face to support his body as his thrusts deepen.</p><p>The desire to look at Draco and to touch him is so strong Harry's chest hurts.</p><p>His thighs tremble when Draco lifts himself, placing his knees on Harry's sides and interrupting the physical contact.</p><p>"Kneel for me," he says quietly, his voice deep with want as he releases Harry's wrists. Harry obeys, because how could he not when Draco asks like this. He lifts himself weekly and bends his legs, making them slide under Draco's. He thinks about turning around to taste Draco's mouth, but the other man commands,</p><p>"Hands on your thighs."</p><p>Harry suppresses a groan but does as he’s told.</p><p>"Spread your legs," Draco murmurs in his ear and his voice is pure sex. He's close enough for Harry to feel the heat of his body, yet not close enough to touch.</p><p>As soon as Harry is done, Draco sits on his heels and two muscular thighs make their way between Harry's open legs. Draco grips him by the hips and kisses his shoulder-blade.</p><p>"Now, lean on me."</p><p>Harry leans. His back is met by Draco's hot chest and his spread bum slides on the length of Draco's hardness. There's lubricant on it.<br/>Harry falls forwards at the sensation, throwing both his hands on the mattress in support.<br/>His own erection is pulsing and Harry's afraid he might come even if he's not been touched yet.</p><p>Draco's grip on his hips tightens.<br/>He rocks his own hips, making his cock slide in the middle of Harry's cheeks again. And again, and again.<br/>Harry can’t suppress a cry.<br/>His body is shivering.</p><p>"You're so good for me," Draco says, his breath ragged.</p><p>Harry wants to respond, to say something, but he's unable to form a coherent phrase.<br/>Then, one of Draco's hands makes its way down and a finger presses at Harry's entrance.</p><p>Harry has dreamt about this moment many times in the past years and he's ready. He's been ready for a long time.<br/>"God, <em> finally,</em>" he chokes out and he lowers himself on Draco's finger. He wants to beg for another one, but the Dream Draco knows that.</p><p>"So good," he breathes out and pushes the second finger in.</p><p>Harry has to wrap a hand around the base of his erection to prevent himself from coming. Not yet. Not when he still has so much to give.</p><p>"So hard, only for me," Draco murmurs, forcing Harry's hips down on his hand.</p><p>"Only you," he manages to choke out, because it's important, because there is only Draco, always.<br/>"Draco," he pants, "<em>please.</em>"</p><p>And Draco fucks him. He fucks him, wrapping a hand around Harry's chest and pulling him up, so they can meet halfway.<br/>He fucks him as the same hand travels to Harry's throat to keep his neck still, so Draco can kiss it from behind.</p><p>Harry spreads his legs wider and takes everything Draco can give him, not bothering to keep quiet anymore.</p><p>Draco takes his wrists and places his hands on the wall in front of them, caressing the curve of Harry's back as he fucks him harder.</p><p>Harry tries to bite down the shame that eventually comes. It always does.</p><p>Because no matter how hard he tries to delude himself, no matter how realistic his dreams are, he still can't hide the fact that it's all pathetic. Even in his dreams he's not allowed to look and to touch; they're there to remind him that Draco will never be his.</p><p>And as Harry slides down every time Draco thrusts in, the sweat on his face mixes with tears that he desperately tries to stop from falling.</p><p>He cries out when Draco bites his shoulder, grounding him harder.</p><p>His own cry awakens him and the walls of his bedroom shake.<br/>His chest is flushed, and his erection is painfully hard, and Harry knows where the wetness on his cheeks comes from.<br/>He squeezes his eyes shut, groaning in frustration as more tears escape his eyelids.</p><p>He has let himself believe, again. He's such a fool.</p><p>He knows the anxiety that's clawing at his throat too well, so he disentangles himself from the sheets that are wrapped around his torso and lifts himself, trying to calm his breathing.<br/>When his senses sharpen again, Harry ignores the disgust that makes its way into his mind like a plague and takes himself into his hand.<br/>He makes himself come in the solitude of his dark room, Draco's name on his lips, while his tears leave dark, circular spots on his grey sheets.</p><p>
