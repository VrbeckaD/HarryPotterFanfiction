    <p>Edward sat at his piano playing a soft melody that filled his home. It had been a long time since he had been this relaxed. The past year had been ruff on him and his family but they had all made it through unharmed. And most importantly so had Isabella Swan. If blood flowed through his veins he know his checks would have reddened at the thought of Bella. He love he felt for her was more than anything he had felt for anything in a long time. She was perfect in every way that mattered to Edward. She was smart having figured out that they were vampires with little information to go on. She was private a trait that Edward liked, knowing that she wouldn't go around talking about his family to other students at school. And he couldn't hear her thoughts. That's one of the things that Edward loved the most about her. The fact that he had to work to get to know what she was thinking about. That he didn't learn her inner most thoughts unless she wanted him to. He was glad to have found her when he did. The loneliness of immortality was starting to sink into him. Sure he had his family but that was different. He wanted someone to share his life with. He wanted to be intimate in a way that wouldn't be possible with his family. Now he had that and he was thankful every day that he did. Little did he know that the happiness he had with Bella was about to come to an end. But just maybe it would lead to far more love and happiness that he didn't even know he was missing out on.</p><p>As Edward continued to play he was pulled away from his own thoughts and into Alice's as she had a very unusual vision. But this vision was vastly different from any other vision Edward had seen her have before. One major difference was that while Edward could clearly see himself sitting on side of the lake that's out in the forest cuddled up with someone beside him he couldn't make out who the person was. He was very confused with what he was seeing. All he could make out was that on the top of their head was thick black hair and they had on an emerald green dress. He didn't know who this person could be. Bella was a brunette but maybe she was thinking about dying her hair Edward thought to himself. But that didn't explain away that green dress. Bella wasn't one to ware many dress unless it was a special occasion. Not to mention that the lake isn't where he and Bella would spend their time together they always went to the clearing with the flowers. So who was this mystery person and how did Edward know them. The other thing was that this vision only lasted a second. Nothing happened in it other than Edward sitting next to someone on the couch. It was all very confusing so he got up to go speak to Alice about it. He entered the living room to find Jasper asking Alice about the vision she had.</p><p>"Alice what's wrong? What did you see?" Jasper questioned looking worriedly at his wife. He had noticed her go still and then she became very worried about something.</p><p>"What's going on?" asked Carlisle as he and Esme came into the room followed shortly Emmett and Rosalie. The four of them had just gotten back from hunting.</p><p>"I don't know Alice had a vision and she became very worried about whatever it is she saw." Jasper told his coven leader and father.</p><p>"Alice what did you see that has you so worried?" Carlisle asked.</p><p>"It's not what I saw that has me worried it's what I didn't see that does," Alice said.</p><p>"What do you mean," Rosalie asked?</p><p>"In the vision I saw Edward sitting on the bank of that lake that's out in the woods a few miles from here. He was sitting with someone that had black hair and a long green dress. They were cuddling," Alice said. Edward nodded along with what she was saying letting his family know that he had seen it too.</p><p>"I don't see what the problem is," Emmett said.</p><p>"The problem," Edward said speaking for the first time since entering the room "is that we couldn't see who it was. They were all blurred out. We only got the vague picture of them. I have no idea who it is."</p><p>"What if it was just Bella," Esme asked? "Maybe she's considering dying her hair."</p><p>"I thought that too," Edward said "but that doesn't explain why Alice and I couldn't see her. Alice has had visions of Bella before and we could see her just fine in them."</p><p>"Well Alice has this ever happened before?" Carlisle asked. "Has there ever been anyone that you couldn't see in your visions?"</p><p>"Well the wolves are the only people that I have come across that I can't see. But even that's different. I don't see them at all. They are just a blank spot in the visions and usually block out whatever else is in the vision keeping me form seeing people that are close to them. Like what happened last year with Bella. She had been with them and then I couldn't see her anymore. But whatever this is something that I've never encountered before," Alice said. And that's what worried her the most. She's always seen when someone was coming after her family. Always know who it was and what they wanted. But know she felt helpless. It didn't look like whoever it had been was up to anything bad but she was still worried.</p><p>"It doesn't sound like whoever she is was doing anything wrong in your vision so we will just have to keep an eye out for her," Carlisle said. "For now try not to worry too much about it. I believe that you all have school in a few hours so why don't you go and get ready. And we can talk about this more once we learn more about what is happening."</p><p>They all headed off to their rooms to get ready for school. All still wondering about what it could mean that Alice couldn't see this mystery girl. It wasn't long after that that they found themselves standing outside of the school waiting for the bell to signal that they had to go to class. Bella meet them at school as she and Edward weren't allowed to see each other outside of school. After she left for Italy without talking to her father to go and see him she was grounded. He made his family promise not to tell Bella about the vision that Alice had until they figured out what it meant. As they stood in the parking lot talking to each other a strange smell slowly began to creep into their noses.</p><p>"Do you smell that?" Emmett asked sniffing at the air.</p><p>"Yeah it smells like sea water," Alice said.</p><p>"But we are miles from the beach, I've never smelt it here before," Edward said "and it seems to be getting stronger." They all stood looking around for the source of the smell when a car pulled up to the school. Once it stopped by the front entrance the back passenger door opened and they suddenly knew exactly where the smell was coming from. They watched as a young black haired boy got out. He stopped to talk to his parents who were still in the car. Thanks to their vampire hearing they could hear every word.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to start school today? We don't want to rush you into this. We just got here the two days ago. Why don't you take the week off and start later?" Asked the women in the passenger seat.</p><p>"Mom I'll be fine," the boy said. "The teachers will help me if I get stuck and Angela already offered to help me study for my classes."</p><p>"Don't listen to your mother Harry," said a male voice from the driver's seat "she's just worried about you that's all. It's been a long time since you had to be away from us and we didn't personally know the people that would be around you. She will be fine and so will you. Have a good day and we will see you after school."</p><p>"Thanks dad I will. I'll see you at home. Love you guys," Harry said as he turned and walked in to the school. His parents waved and drove off. As the car got further and further away the smell died down a great deal but they could still smell it because Harry was inside the school.</p><p>"Does that family do nothing but swim in the ocean" Rosalie asked irritated by the smell? Edward didn't understand why she was so upset it wasn't that bad and it's not like it smell disgusting it was just a little strong with all three of them there. Eventually they would get used to it like they did with all of the other students scents at school. Soon after that the bell rang and it was time for their first classes. Edward and Bella walked into the school together but soon parted ways as Edward headed to his math class and Bella went to English. Edward made his way to his seat at the back of the classroom and sat down waiting for the class to begin. Soon after he sat down that smell of the ocean from outside began to fill his nose again. Not a moment later the boy form earlier came into the class room followed closely by Angela Weber one of Bella's friends. They were talking to each other as Angela led him over to where she sits.</p><p>"Harry I'm so glad that you're finally here" Angela said as she sat down. "It's been so long since I could talk to someone my age about this. I mean my parents tried to talk about it with me but I didn't work. I get that they were my age before but that was like a 300 years ago. They don't remember what it's like to feel this out of control of their bodies." And suddenly Edward found he didn't want to know any more about this conversation so he tuned them out the best he could not knowing that he was missing out on clues that could help him figure out just what secrets Harry and Angela's families had to hide.</p><p>"Well at least you didn't have to move because of some possible gift that no one even knows whether it's real or not," Harry said.</p><p>"Harry James Potter you were making waves before you could even swim properly. If anyone is powerful enough to possibly gain a fabled ability it would be you. You had to move because it wouldn't mix well with water and you know that. And even if it's just a story and it doesn't happen to you at least you got to come and spend some time with me," Angela said patting Harry on the back. Before she could say more the teacher walked in and class began.</p>
