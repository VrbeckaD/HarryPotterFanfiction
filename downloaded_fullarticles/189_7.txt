    <p>"My life isn't a book for you too plot!" My brother Merlin shouted to my mother. He ran from our sitting room and up the stairs of our moderate sized home. My parents, Reuel and Doris, followed him.</p>
<p>"Take that back and apologize to your mother!" My father shouted. I ducked into my bedroom from where I had been watching at the top of the spiraling staircase.</p>
<p>'What a way to start the night before your eleventh birthday,' I thought as I fell backwards onto my silver bedspread. My fingers caught a loose thread and I began twisting it around, hearing my parents rush up the stairs and try talking to my brother through the door of his bedroom.</p>
<p>They were arguing about what electives Merlin would take in his third year of Hogwarts. He had insisted at the end of his last year that he wanted to transfer to Durmstrang, but mum had insisted he should stay at Hogwarts and dad didn't want him attending a school that taught the dark arts. </p>
<p>"You should have picked your electives when you were supposed to," Mum said.</p>
<p>"I told you," Merlin's muffled voice sounded from behind his door, "I am going to Durmstrang, I know what electives I'll take there."</p>
<p>"If you say one more thing about that school," My father growled, "I'll take you out of Hogwarts and send you to Ilvermorny."</p>
<p>"Fine!" Merlin shouted, "I don't want to go to Hogwarts, anyway."</p>
<p>I stood up and walked over to my dark wooden door and slammed it shut. I had enough of their stupid argument. I looked out onto our tiny backyard. Unlike most pure blood families, we did not live on a giant estate, instead we owned a house in London that was huge compared to most houses around our area.</p>
<p>I opened the window and called for our family owl. Immediately, Alivia flew to me and landed on my sill.<br/>"Any letters?" I asked Alivia. As if to say no, she shook her head. I sighed. "I guess it won't be here early."</p>
<p>I walked to my door. I could still hear my parents trying to reason with my brother. "Can't you just listen to them?" I whispered, as if my brother could hear me. I thought  I could sneak down to the basement and watch the Edward Scissorhands movie my aunt had bought my mum. I walked past Merlin's bedroom and noticed that mum and dad had finally gained access to his room. </p>
<p>I placed my foot on the top step of the ebony coloured staircase and it creak. My mum looked at me from where she sat on Merlin's bed. My brother was fiddling with his ivory wand.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, Lucy?" Mum asked.</p>
<p>"Getting a snack," I muttered.</p>
<p>"Okay, but eat quickly. You're going to bed soon," She said.</p>
<p>I groaned inwardly but did not say anything. 'Pick your fights,' Carol Savauge, Merlin's friend's sister, had told me once. I decided to get a snack just in case mum was watching. I skipped down the curved staircase and ran into the kitchen, my wool socks causing me to slide on the hardwood floor. Opening the junk cupboard, I saw an unopened box of Berty Botts Every Flavour Beans. I shook it before realizing it was Merlin's. Our parents did not permit us to have sweets in our room, and my brothers followed that rule. I did, on occasion, but my friend Angela from down the street had given me muggle candy called Twizzlers and if my parents found out I had muggle candy, they would most likely throw it out.</p>
<p>I took the beans and opened the fridge. My dad drank canned butterbeer and had twelve cans in our fridge, but I thought it was disgusting to drink it from a can, so I took a can of coke. My parents claimed that coke was perhaps the best thing that had come from muggles, besides my dad's Lamborghini.<br/>I grabbed a bag of potato chips and headed through the door by the fridge. It led to the basement where my mum had her potions studio and where we had a huge theatre. My mum made potions for Wizarding families who lived in London but had no time to make their own. Molly Weasley came to get potions often, but mum was no friend of hers. The Weasleys were pureblood but I had heard mum remark to dad once that their sympathy for muggles and mudbloods had bereft them of real pureblood dignity.</p>
<p>Our basement theatre was my sanctuary of solitude from a busy life. Mum had homeschooled my brothers and I since we were of learning age. She said that because muggles knew nothing of the Wizarding world, if she sent us to public school, the teachers would unknowingly brainwash us.<br/>I turned on the TV screen before hitting the button for the receiver with my foot. We were lucky to have a VHS machine with a remote, otherwise I would have to get up to stop and rewind. Our receiver also had a remote, but a dog we owned years ago had chewed the remote so we couldn't use the on off button.</p>
<p>Flitting my eyes along the rows of VHS tapes in the shelf, I looked for Edward Scissorhands. I couldn't wait to see Johnny Depp in one of his newest films. He was a muggle and he was years older than me, but he was my celebrity crush.</p>
<p>My eyes landed on a few movies including Star Wars and Labyrinth. Our family was one of the top pureblood families but what most people didn't know was that we owned a huge collection of movies.</p>
<p>I finally spotted Edward Scissorhands and pulled it from from the shelf and pulled the tape from the cardboard case. My heart sunk when I saw I had to rewind it.</p>
<p>I stuck it in the machine and hit rewind. The monotonous whirring came from the machine. I was so used to the sound from all the movies I had watched. <br/>I heard a pop behind me and turned around to see that my mum had apparated to our basement.</p>
<p>"You don't have time to watch a movie, Lucy," Mum said. I kicked the cardboard VHS case under the couch so that she couldn't see what I was planning to watch. Just then, the rewinding was done.</p>
<p>"What are you watching?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Labyrinth." I lied. </p>
<p>"I thought you were only aloud to watch that with an adult," she said. "Remember what happened last time you watched it alone." I sighed, not wanting to remember that I had cried out of fear during the part when the goblins come into Sarah's house near the beginning.</p>
<p>My mum flicked her wand, causing the case for Edward Scissorhands to fly from under the couch and into her hand. "Edward Scissorhands?" She frowned. "Lucy, if you can't obey the rules we set for you at home, how can we expect you to follow rules at Hogwarts?"</p>
<p>"Sorry," I said. </p>
<p>"I forgive you," She smiled. She eyed my coke and every flavour beans. "Now go upstairs and drink your coke but put your brother's sweets back in the cupboard."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>With another flick of her wand, the tv screen, receiver and VHS machine turned off.</p>
<p>By the time I had brushed my teeth and put in my pajamas, my parents and brother had resolved their problem, but I didn't know what agreement they had come to.<br/>~<br/>August twenty-first dawned beautifully. I was awake before dawn. I thought that maybe my letter would arrive early in the morning and I could be the first to see it. By eight, I had left my window seat and had been reading Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility for almost two hours. I was reading when there was a knock on the door.  My younger brother Viggo rushed in. He was grinning. </p>
<p>"Is it here yet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What?" He stood in the middle of my room yawning.</p>
<p>"My letter."</p>
<p>"Oh. No, your birthday present is, though," He pulled me from my perch on the window seat and towards the door. "C'mon, mum says you can open them during breakfast."</p>
<p>I followed my brother downstairs. He was still dressed in his pink and blue pajamas from Korea. He had always called them the little boy heads because the background was blue and there were pink circles that looked like little heads.</p>
<p>Mum was using charms to set the kitchen table when I got downstairs. Dad was at the stove making French Toast, it smelled amazing. Merlin was waiting for me at his spot on the short walnut table. In front of him was a small square box. I eyed it carefully. It was wrapped in silver tissue paper and a gauzy purple ribbon.</p>
<p>"Happy birthday, Lucy," Mum said, coming over to me. She hugged me and I breathed in, the familiar scent of lavender filled my nose. Dad came up to me and kissed my forehead before handing me a cream coloured envelope from behind his back.</p>
<p>I gasped, "My letter!"</p>
<p>The envelope read, 'Miss Lucy Hazelton, 14 Mortensen Avenue, London.'</p>
<p>I tore the envelope open, disregarding how my grandmother had taught me to properly open envelopes.</p>
<p>'Dear Miss Hazelton,<br/>We are pleased to inform you that you have been excepted into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Students will be required to report to the chamber of reception upon arrival. Please find an enclosed list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins 1st September, 1991. We await your owl by no later than 31st August. To avoid detection by muggles, please use the entrance located at King's Cross Station, Downtown London on platform 9 3/4. We look forward to having you at our school.<br/>Your sincerely,<br/>Minerva McGonagall'</p>
<p>I ran over to Viggo and held the letter in front of his face.</p>
<p>"I'm going to Hogwarts!" I shouted.</p>
<p>He smiled and said, "I wish I could go."</p>
<p>"You have to wait two years," I giggled.</p>
<p>Fawning over my letter, I sat down next to Merlin at the table and placed the letter beside my plate. "When can I get my wand?" I asked my mum.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow we are going to Diagon Alley to buy you and your brother books and robes, and then we'll buy your wand there, too," Mum smiled. "Sound good?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" I cheered.</p>
<p>My eleventh birthday passed quickly. From my parents, I received the new Nimbus 2000. Merlin told me first years weren't aloud to have their own brooms at Hogwarts, but dad told me that he would pay Dumbledore to allow me to keep it. Merlin's gift was a little silver bird figurine and Viggo bought me a box of Berty Bott's Every Flavour Beans.</p>
<p>As I lay in my large bed that night, I drifted off thinking of our trip to Diagon Alley the next day and the other first years I might meet there. Then the thought struck me. What house would I get sorted into? My dad was sorted in Ravenclaw like many of his pure blood ancestors. Our family tree was not marred by any Gryffindors or Hufflepuffs, only years of Ravenclaws and Slytherins. My mum had been sorted into Slytherin and Merlin was a Ravenclaw.<br/>As I drifted off, I thought about what house I would get sorted into. Mum always said I would be Slytherin and I thought I was a perfect cross between Slytherin and Ravenclaw. If only they had hybrid houses.</p>
