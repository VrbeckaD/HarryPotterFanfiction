    <p class="p1">There is a light on in the kitchen and it makes Sirius hesitate in the entryway of his flat. He’s pretty sure he turned it off when he left. Also, the smell of cigarette smoke doesn’t just linger, it’s a haze drifting across his living room. Things look intact but he pulls out his wand anyway before quietly stepping across the room. One can never be too careful these days.</p>
<p class="p1">He finds Remus at his pathetic excuse for a dinner table smoking. Chain smoking by the looks of it. There’s nearly a whole pack of butts in the ash tray in front of him, another nearly down to his fingers.</p>
<p class="p1">Which are shaking so bad Sirius is surprised Remus doesn’t dropped it.</p>
<p class="p1">“Remus,” he breathes. “Where the hell have you been? We’ve barely seen you since the last moon.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus doesn’t say anything, just puts the smoke to his lips and inhales on it with trembling fingers. It’s a moment before he looks up at Sirius, but when he does Sirius sees he’s trying to hide his anguish.</p>
<p class="p1">“Moony,” he says, sitting across from him at the table, thoughts of opening a window forgotten at the look on Remus’ face. “What the hell happened?”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looks evasive for a moment longer, rubbing his chin and the stubble there upon, then sighs and digs in his pocket. He tosses its contents on the table between them like the worn parchment sparked him at the touch.</p>
<p class="p1">“That came for me.” His voice is rough and worn, but his tone is worse. When Sirius just stares at him, Remus nods his head at the battered envelope and turns away, smoking once more. Sirius watches him nervously dragging on the bent cigarette, before turning back to the letter in front of him.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius picks it up delicately. It hasn’t been folded so much as crumpled, but enough times that it has permanent wear. He tries to flatten it out, running his fingers over Remus’ name neatly printed on the front, his thumb over the return address…</p>
<p class="p1">The Ministry?</p>
<p class="p1">“No,” he says softly, mostly to himself, and rips the letter from the envelope. He reads it once, too fast. He’s half way through the second read, slower and with rage building in his chest when Remus slams his hand down on the table and swears.</p>
<p class="p1">“Damn it!”</p>
<p class="p1">The ashtray shatters in a sudden burst of magic, and a piece of it shoots past Sirius and bounces off the wall. He looks up apprehensively from the parchment in his hands.</p>
<p class="p1">But Remus’ outburst has already subsided. He’s bent forward against the table, palms pressed into his eye sockets. This is always how it has been with Remus. Sudden rages that went as quickly as they came. As if the werewolf in him was trying to claw its way out and Remus had to keep stuffing it back in.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius admits that it scares the shit out of him sometimes.</p>
<p class="p1">Now though, now he’s just scared <em>for</em> Remus. Scared and angry.</p>
<p class="p1">He places the parchment aside not so delicately, vile thing that it is. He should say something, he knows, but he doesn’t know what.</p>
<p class="p1">“Moony,…”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m okay, Pads,” Remus says, though the crack in his voice and his still shaking hands reaching for another cigarette are evidence to the contrary. “I’m okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">He looks up at Sirius, finally meets his gaze. He’s putting on a calm demeanor, but Sirius can see the storm raging in his eyes and suddenly he’s just a little bit scared of Remus again.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s absolute rubbish, but I’m okay.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s more than absolute rubbish. It’s complete and utter shite.</p>
<p class="p1">“I thought they weren’t voting on them for months.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, well,” Remus says, inhaling sharply on the smoke in his fingers. “Some things are moving quicker, with the war.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius wants to take the cigarettes from him, rub some calm back into his friend’s hands. But he let’s Remus smoke. Lets him have what he can.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll have to quit my job. Maybe try to get a muggle one, though even that will have to be under the table. They’re about ready to sack me anyway. Like my work but not my attendance record.” Remus huffs. “Yes, I’ll quit. Before the Ministry sends them a politely worded letter about what they have on the payroll. Don’t know what I’ll do about rent, but I’ll manage.” He looks up at Sirius, and tries to smiles. “I’ll manage.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You could move in with me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No.” Remus says with a little too much edge. Then softer, “No. I won’t be treated as charity.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Fuck, Remus, it’s not charity. It’s about whether or not my best friend is living on the street or not. Or some hole in a crack house. I’d rather use my inheritance helping you than letting it just sit in that cold vault in Gringotts.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Sirius—“</p>
<p class="p1">“Just think about it okay? I’ve got a spare room and everything. I’d be happy to have you.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus just frowns, fingers worrying at his lips. Sirius sighs. It’s not like they haven’t had this argument before.</p>
<p class="p1">A cold and brittle silence descends upon the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re going to give me a tattoo.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s in this that Remus’ voice finally breaks. Suddenly he’s barely holding it together.</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re going to fucking brand me, Sirius. Numbered and tagged, like an some rampant stray. I’m on a fucking register!”</p>
<p class="p1">He gasps, gulping down air and Sirius sees he’s trying not to cry. It’s been a long time since he’s seen this from Remus. It reminds him of when they told him they knew about him being a werewolf and Remus thought he was going to get kicked out of school. He didn’t want them to know how upset he was, but Sirius recognized it, that face. It’s a something he saw a lot growing up, in Regulus, in himself.</p>
<p class="p1">“Remus, mate…” Sirius wants to tell him it’s okay to cry, to be upset. But he just watches as Remus pushes it down, locks it away.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s an ugly noise the chair makes as it scrapes backwards on the floor when Remus gets up suddenly.</p>
<p class="p1">“I need to go,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius catches his wrist before he can bolt out of the flat, and Remus looks at him so startled, that he lets go immediately. Remus pauses though.</p>
<p class="p1">“See you in a couple of days for the moon, yeah?” he says softly.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Sirius says.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p3">*</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Remus appears on his doorstep two weeks after the full moon, looking haggard and holding a potted plant.</p>
<p class="p1">“I lost the flat,” is all he says.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius helps him carry in his trunk and shows him to the spare room.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus makes no comment about Sirius having acquired a spare bed and extra linens, just dutifully unpacks his things while Sirius orders takeaway.</p>
<p class="p1">They eat dinner on the couch and Sirius does his best to pull a smile out of Remus. He almost succeeds.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p3">*</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">It’s not that Sirius blames him for being so unhappy. It’s that Sirius feels so utterly useless because there’s nothing he can do to help.</p>
<p class="p1">Living with Remus is not how he envisioned. He knew it wouldn’t be the same as sharing the dorm at school, but this is like living with a ghost. Remus cleans and cooks (to the best of his ability) and makes himself useful, as if to feel like he’s earning his right to be there. But otherwise Remus makes himself small and scarce and it irks Sirius to his core. Remus acts likes he’s trespassing and Sirius doesn’t know how to make him understand that he’s wanted here. That Sirius wants him here, and wants him to be <em>happy</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s all Sirius has wanted for ages.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus has always drawn Sirius in, with his quiet brilliance and unexpected sarcasm and talent for making trouble. And somewhere in seventh year, probably in the realization that very soon they would not be spending every day together, it hit Sirius that he was very likely in love with Remus Lupin.</p>
<p class="p1">When the feelings did not abate at graduation, he concluded this was very much the case and settled into a life knowing that he loved Remus and he didn’t quite know how to go about telling him. Or if he should. So he took to daydreaming about getting Moony to live with him and the two of them shacking up together and being incandescently happy instead.</p>
<p class="p1">He’s got one out of the three now, but he’s willing to give up the second entirely if it means catching a glimpse of the third.</p>
<p class="p1">He almost told James once. They were out drinking and he almost just said it straight. <em>I’m in love with Remus. I’m in love with Remus and I don’t know what to do about it.</em> </p>
<p class="p1">It’s not that he believes James will hate him for it. James can be a prude, but Sirius knows when it comes to his friends, James would do anything.</p>
<p class="p1">But Sirius realized that James would probably say nothing that Sirius hasn’t already thought of and be just as lost as what to do. Or suggest something completely outrageous. James has never been particularly brilliant when it comes to relationships. Look at Lily, for example.</p>
<p class="p1">(Sirius likes Lily, even if it’s why they rarely see James these days. She’s level headed and can be completely scathing when she wants to be. But he still thinks she’s a bit of a nutter to end up with James after everything.)</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius wonders if he should talk to Lily about it. She’d be better than James.</p>
<p class="p1">“Toast?”</p>
<p class="p1">He’s pulled out of his thoughts by Remus waving a piece of jam covered toast under his nose. Remus’ mouth quirks into an almost smile as Sirius blinks at him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry,” he says, taking the toast and discovering that Remus has also made him tea. “Haven’t woken up yet, I guess.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You never were a morning person.”</p>
<p class="p1">There is silence in the kitchen as Remus picks at his toast and Sirius tries to think of something to say. He can’t think of anything that doesn’t sound trite or superficial and it leaves him with a hollow ache in his chest. It’s too early in the morning for this kind of depression, he thinks.</p>
<p class="p1">He wonders briefly if it’s contagious, this kind of sadness.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus pushes away his barely eaten toast. “I need to go out for a bit today,” he says, staring at his plate.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” Sirius says, puzzled by the statement. This is strikingly formal and slightly worrying. “I’ll be here when you get back.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s the only thing Sirius can think to say that might be reassuring, because Remus seems particularly nervous. Remus gives him a small smile in return, before heading out of the flat.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s well into the afternoon when Sirius, on the couch and studying for his Auror practicals, swears vehemently.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course. How could he have been so stupid? Today is the day that… well, Sirius doesn’t want to think about it, but Remus is the one who is currently experiencing it so Sirius tries to not cower from it. No wonder Remus was weird this morning. He was going into the Ministry to get his fucking tattoo.</p>
<p class="p1">He allows himself to be upset about it for half an hour, and then gets up and puts on the kettle.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus’ return is signaled by the clatter of the door and a loud thump as his bag hits the floor. Remus usually so careful of his things.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius pokes his head out of the kitchen as Remus comes into the living room looking utterly defeated. They stare at each other for a moment.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tea?” Sirius says at last.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus just nods.</p>
<p class="p1">Once they are both settled at the table, a mug of tea each, Sirius open his mouth to say something but Remus cuts him off with a broken look.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to talk about it. Not yet.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius tries to protest, but Remus shakes his head.</p>
<p class="p1">“I will, I promise. But not right now. Okay?”</p>
<p class="p1">They drink their tea in silence.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p3">*</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">It’s nearly a week before they do talk about it.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus isn’t quite as distant as he has been, but Sirius suspects that’s only because he’s trying to be happy for Sirius sake. Sirius doesn’t like this either but considers it might be better than nothing.</p>
<p class="p1">They are sitting on the couch reading. Remus, some classic muggle fiction. Sirius is at his Auror textbooks again. He’s beginning to rethink this whole Auror thing. He’s not sure how he feels about working for the Ministry these days. Even if they need people on the inside with the war.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius’ battered turntable is playing softly in the corner. He could afford better one, one that doesn’t skip so bad, but he thinks it’s more punk rock this way. It starts to skip now, and Sirius gets up to fix it. When he returns, he finds Remus has put his book aside and has pulled up the cuff of his sleeve.</p>
<p class="p1">He’s staring down at his arm with such loathing. Sirius can’t see the tattoo because Remus keeps running his hand over it, but it still makes him a bit sick. Gingerly he sits back on the couch beside him.</p>
<p class="p1">“They said it would fade,” Remus says shakily. He turns his arm so Sirius can see. “It can be brought back up by magic, but they said it’d fade.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not terribly large, just a series of letters and numbers on the inside of Remus’ forearm, much like the call numbers on the books at the library. But Sirius feels like he’s been kicked in the chest that this has been allowed. That some thought this was a good idea. And that it had to happen to Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“I mean, I guess it won’t really matter if does, I’ll always know it’s there. But they said it would fade.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s probably still healing,” Sirius says without assurance. “I’m sure it will fade soon…”</p>
<p class="p1">All week he’s been prepping himself for this, to be supportive of Remus when they finally got down to it and suddenly he finds he doesn’t know what to say.</p>
<p class="p1">But it seems Remus is finally ready to talk.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s just… we got out of school and I thought I could handle it.” Remus turns his head up the ceiling, resting it on the back of the couch, pressing his palms to his eyes. “Thought it’d be okay. Thought <em>I’d</em> be okay. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but I thought I’d manage. And I think I was, for a while there. I was paying rent, I was feeding myself, mostly. And even with all this talk of war, I thought it was going to be okay. That I could finally live with myself, live with the wolf.</p>
<p class="p1">“That stupid fucking letter,” he says with venom. “The fucking Ministry.”</p>
<p class="p1">Then Remus laughs, and it’s hollow and ugly. “I must be a fool. Dreaming for some sort of peace from it. It’s a fucking wolf. It’s always been vicious. I don’t know why I expected anything less.”</p>
<p class="p1">He falls forward on himself, face pressed into his hands, shoulders shaking.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius hesitates, but lays a hand on Remus’ back and rubs it a little when Remus doesn’t seem too mind.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s okay,” Sirius says, though his voice fails him. Remus snorts a little through his tears and Sirius sigh. “No, you’re right, it’s shite. Complete and utter shite. I just mean, I don’t blame you for being upset about it. I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to go trash the Ministry for what they’ve done. Actually…That’s not a bad idea…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Sirius,” Remus says a bit despairingly.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, sorry, not the time….”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus sits up a little and gives him a weak smile. “I was thinking more that it will fuck up your chances with the Auror academy…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh. Well, working for the Ministry is starting to loose its appeal… I’m pretty pissed at them at the moment.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus frowns, and sniffs. Then he starts crying again.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry,” he says. “Merlin. I was trying so hard to not let this affect me, now look at me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Fuck, Remus, look what they’ve done to you. You’ve got all the right to cry.”</p>
<p class="p1">“That doesn’t mean I don’t hate myself any less,” Remus says.</p>
<p class="p1">“I know,” Sirius says, and he does, he finally does. He finally understands why things have been so terrible lately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m just saying, I’m don’t blame you for falling apart a little.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I think you mean ‘a lot’,” Remus says with a sniff and something vaguely resembling a laugh. He shoves his hand under his nose. “Merlin, I’m a mess.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Considering current circumstances, I’d be the same.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus sighs heavily, falling forward, burying his head in his arms for a moment. When he looks up again, his eyes have cleared a little.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m sorry I’ve been such a drag lately.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius shakes his head.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s okay. You don’t have to be happy for me. I’m honestly just glad you finally moved in.”</p>
<p class="p1">This apparently is not the thing to say. Remus gets a sort of distant look in his eyes.</p>
<p class="p1">“This isn’t how I thought it’d be,” he says. “Us living together.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius shrugs, because he doesn’t want to lie to Remus, but doesn’t think right now is the time to say he agrees. “Most things don’t turn out like we think they will.” He says. “Sometimes things get better.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah…” Remus says. He looks tired and turns to stare at the wall absently.</p>
<p class="p1">“Remus…” Sirius starts, thinking he might as well say it.</p>
<p class="p1">“I think I’m going to go to bed,” Remus says, though, interrupting him.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah…” Sirius says, a bit deflated. “Yeah, go get some sleep.” He gives Remus a smile.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus hesitates. Then he put his hand on Sirius’ knee and pats it a bit awkwardly before getting up.</p>
<p class="p1">“You know,” he says, picking up his book. “I’m glad I moved in, too. I don’t know that I could have done this without you here.”</p>
<p class="p1">He gives Sirius a sad and heavy laden smile then heads to his room. The door clicks before Sirius lets out the breath he didn’t know he was holding. Then he flops down face first on the couch with a sigh.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p3">*</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Sirius gets up the next morning with intention.</p>
<p class="p1">He spent a long time sitting in the living room deliberating after Remus went to bed, so he didn’t get much sleep, but his mind is set.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not like it’s a new idea. He was going to get it after graduation, but time slipped by him somehow, and he realized if he doesn’t get it now, he maybe never will.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus seems a bit more up beat, though still looking very tired, when Sirius comes into the kitchen. He smiles.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re up early.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ve got some errands to run.” Sirius says.</p>
<p class="p1">“Want some company?”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius shakes his head. “It’s okay. Just need to pick up some stuff.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looks a little crestfallen, hiding behind his cup of tea. But things don’t seem so tense this morning and Remus smiles just a little when Sirius gets up to go.</p>
<p class="p1">The tattoo parlor is a bit on the seedy side, but the guy there was recommended to Sirius by a fellow Auror-in-training. One of the few places in muggle London that will do magical tattoos, if you know how to ask.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius watches with fascination as the guy puts together his equipment. He must be fidgeting because the guy looks up and chuckles slightly.</p>
<p class="p1">“First time?” he asks.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah.” But that’s not why he’s restless. He can deal with pain, had to growing up. It’s that he’s excited to finally be doing this.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a little part of him that’s worried that Remus will think he’s gone round the bend when he sees it. But he shoves that down and focuses on the peculiar sensation of a needle pushing ink into his skin.</p>
<p class="p1">He’s in a state of euphoria by the time he gets back to the flat, adrenaline running through his veins. He could get addicted to this, he thinks, staring at the bandage over his arm. It sets off another wave of warmth through him, but he pulls down his sleeve to cover it before stumbling back into the flat.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus is at the kitchen table, flipping through a muggle paper. It takes Sirius a moment to realize he’s job hunting.</p>
<p class="p1">“Anything of interest?” he asks, flopping into the chair across from him, being careful of his arm.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looks up at him. “There’s a bookshop in Soho looking for help. They want a curator at the British Museum, too, but that’s a bit far fetched for me. Did you get what you needed?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Sirius says trying to keep the guilt from his voice. He was going to pick up some food to use as pretext, but forgot everything as soon as he got out of the tattoo place.</p>
<p class="p1">He’s not sure why he’s lying to Remus either. He’s going to have to show him sooner or later. He’s going to have to tell him what it means.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, he thinks with mild dread, is a really bad time to get cold feet.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus just hums at him and turns back to the paper. </p>
<p class="p1">Sirius feels like he’s the one trespassing that afternoon, fear building in his gut. Because what if Remus hates him when he tells him? What if he wants to move out? Sirius begins to feel this was a rash decision, and soon retreats to his room trying to push down his panic.</p>
<p class="p1">He curls up in bed, feeling childish and a fool for being so transient. In the dim light he pulls back the bandage to stare at the marks underneath and frowns. He doesn’t regret it. Well, if Remus doesn’t want to see him again, he might. But despite all the fear that Remus will loath him, down at his core Sirius is still glad he got it.</p>
<p class="p1">He ends up falling asleep, and when Remus knocks on his door to see if he wants dinner, it’s dark outside.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius stumbles out and into the kitchen, yawning. His arm itches something fierce and absentmindedly he pushes up his sleeve to scratch it.</p>
<p class="p1">He freezes.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus swears at the sight of the bandage on his arm and takes Sirius’ wrist. “Merlin, Sirius, what kind of trouble did you get up to this morning? I know you were trying to be secretive about whatever it was but, you should of let me heal this…”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius starts to snatch his arm back, but regrets it and tries to undo his mistake. Remus drops his hand anyway, and steps back, looking hurt.</p>
<p class="p1">“Remus,” Sirius says. “It’s not… Oh fuck it, look.”</p>
<p class="p1">He pulls the bandage off, wincing a little from the tape, revealing the inside of his arm to Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“You got a tattoo,” Remus says, dead pan. Sirius tries to gauge some reaction from him, but his face is blank. “That’s where you went this morning? To get this?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Sirius said.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus just stares at it.</p>
<p class="p1">Running down the inside of Sirius forearm is the phases of the moon.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s magic, so it changes color with moon cycle—”</p>
<p class="p1">“Why would you get this?” Remus says and Sirius thinks he’s a little angry.</p>
<p class="p1"><em> He doesn’t get it,</em> Sirius realizes, panicking. He had rather hoped the action would speak for itself. Now he’s going to have to try and explain and he knows he’s going to fumble it.</p>
<p class="p1">“Isn’t it obvious?” he says, and swears dramatically in head. Yeah, fumbled it right there.</p>
<p class="p1">“Obvious?!” Remus says, and there is definite fury in his eyes now. “How is it obvious?! Unless this is somehow to make a mockery of me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“What?” Sirius sputters. “I’m not mocking you Remus, why would you…”</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you think this is funny, Sirius,” Remus yells, tugging up his sleeve to show the mark there. It hasn’t faded yet, and the sight of it still turns Sirius stomach, but so does the tone of Remus’ voice. “Look how fun it is, getting a permanent reminder of the kind of monster I am. Remus’ is so cool, let’s go get one of our own. Is that what you thought? Well, fuck you.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s because I love you, you fucking idiot!”</p>
<p class="p1">For a moment his words echo loudly through the otherwise silent kitchen. Remus stares at him, wide eyed.</p>
<p class="p1">“You what?!” He sputters, still angry, but it falters in his confusion. “Is that supposed to make it better?”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius swears, torn between anger at Remus for not letting him explain, for assuming such things, and at himself for not realizing how much this would upset Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Remus, just listen to me for a moment. I got it because… Because you changed my life. You and James and Peter, too even. But mostly you. You taught me so much. I learned astronomy from you. And about muggle technology. You taught me that friends can be a better family than blood. And I would have never have gotten the patronus charm with out your instruction. Or the perfect technique for throwing dungbombs for that matter,” Sirius adds with a frown. “And it was because of you that I learned to stop being arrogant, selfish pureblood trash. You helped me be better.</p>
<p class="p1">“I got it because I love you. Every bit of you. I love your stupid sweaters and your tendency to dress like a musty librarian. I love how you take heaps of sugar in your tea to the point that I wonder if there’s any tea left. I love how you’re patient with everyone when you’re teaching something. And love your scars. Everyone of them. I love how utterly stubborn you are all of the time, too. And I even love your wolf. Because as fucked up as it is, things wouldn’t be the same without it. Because maybe I wouldn’t have met you and maybe we wouldn’t have been friends. And that’s the worst thing I can imagine.</p>
<p class="p1">“I love you, and even if you don’t love yourself right now, let me be proud of how I feel about you until you do. And after that too…” Sirius adds as an afterthought, his dramatics trailing off. “I kind of hope you’ll let me love you forever…”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius clamps his mouth shut, aware that he’s just babbling now. Then he sighs heavily. “I love you, Moony, and I’m not ashamed of it. I just… I wanted to get something to show that.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus stares at him, mouth slightly agape, for what feels like an eternity.</p>
<p class="p1">“Say something,” Sirius says. “<em>Please.</em>”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus’ eyebrow furrow slightly, and he looks away.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Fuck, </em>thinks Sirius. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Remus looks back at him, and he’s crying. He’s also smiling a little.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fuck you, Sirius Black, making me cry. Twice in two days.” He gives a bit a strangled laugh and Sirius is so very confused.</p>
<p class="p1">Until suddenly Remus’ hands slide around to the back of his neck and he presses his lips against Sirius’ own. Sirius wonders if the whole world doesn’t make a little sense at that.</p>
<p class="p1">After a moment Remus pulls away but Sirius wraps his arms around Remus’ waist and pulls him back.</p>
<p class="p1">“You can explain in a moment,” he says. “Just kiss me again first.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus laughs slightly before pressing himself against Sirius again, his breath ghosting over Sirius’ lips.</p>
<p class="p1">When they do let go of each other the first thing Remus says is, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius blinks at him, his memory blank from the kiss as to why Remus might need to apologize.</p>
<p class="p1">“For yelling at you,” Remus says. “For, well, assuming what I did.”</p>
<p class="p1">Shaking his head, Sirius says,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I could have had better timing.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus considers this for a moment, then take Sirius wrist and turns it so he could see the tattoo there.</p>
<p class="p1">When he looks back at Sirius he looks tired and sad again. “You mean it, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="p1">“That I love you? Fuck yes, I mean it. I meant everything I said.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus nods. His mouth quirks into a small smile. “That was quite the speech,” he says and then chuckles when Sirius gets embarrassed. He leans up to kiss him again.</p>
<p class="p1">“<em>This</em> is how I’d hoped living with you would be.” Remus says, pressing his nose into Sirius cheek.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius laughs. “Me too.” He leans in to kiss Remus again, only to pull away at the last second, a look of confusion his face. “Wait, then why did you did you fight so hard not to move in? We’ve been arguing about it since just after graduation!”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus blinks at him, like it’s obvious. “Because I figured it would never happen, the two of us, and I couldn’t fathom living with you and it not being like that. That’s be like school all over again.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh. <em>Oh,</em>” Sirius says, realizing what Remus just implied. “You liked me during school too?”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus laughs. “Yes. Very much so.” He smiles, and Sirius thinks it’s the first real smile he’s seen from Remus in months. The first one that hasn’t been pulled down at the edges with sadness or despair. It fill Sirius with such warmth to see it and he pulls Remus close again to kiss him.</p>
<p class="p1">“I love you,” he says again. “I love you, Remus Lupin, and I’m going to keep telling you that until you can say it to yourself, okay?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” Remus whispers as he wraps his arms around Sirius neck. “Okay.”</p>
