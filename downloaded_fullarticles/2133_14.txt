  <em>1 November 1981</em>
</p><p>Sirius was sitting in Dumbledore’s office for the first time in over three years. It hadn’t changed much— but Sirius thought there were quite a few more dark wizard detection devices scattered about the room. Although, that was probably less a comment on Dumbledore’s housekeeping, given the state of the wizarding world at the moment. </p><p>Sirius was sat in a large squashy armchair. It was very comfortable, but unfortunately clad in ugly paisley upholstery. He was exerting a great deal of effort to avoid noticing the equally ugly plaid armchair to his left, as well as the person sitting in it.</p><p>He absent-mindedly realized he was holding a cup of steaming tea, though he couldn’t remember being served. He stared at it for a moment, watching the delicate wisps of steam spiral endlessly into the air.</p><p>Sirius jumped when Dumbledore cleared his throat. He looked up from his cup, and saw the Headmaster studying him carefully.</p><p>“Thank you both for coming.”</p><p>Sirius scoffed. Dumbledore made it sound like he was a gracious host, welcoming guests to a casual garden party. In reality, Sirius had been tracked down in Diagon Alley and forcibly apparated into the castle. The grumpy looking house elf who had collected him hadn’t so much as offered a courtesy “mind the gap”.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled, looking guilty. “I apologize for the…er…manner in which you were brought here Sirius. Given the circumstances, it was of critical importance that you both speak with me immediately.”</p><p>“How did you find me?” Sirius demanded angrily. “I was hidden pretty fucking well where I was, there were wards up that no one should have been able to break—“</p><p>Dumbledore held up a hand. “Though the Trace is typically lifted once a wizard comes of age, there are ways to circumvent the conventional age limit.”</p><p>“You mean the law,” Sirius snapped.</p><p>“Yes,” Dumbledore replied simply. “As I said, it—“</p><p>“Right, right, was of the utmost importance. You always have a reason. But what I don’t understand is how this is any fucking different from what he does.” Sirius leaned forward, anger rising like bile in his throat. Dumbledore and his master plans and his secrets. Sirius was sick of it. He waited, eyes locked stubbornly with the Headmaster's, daring him to deny it.</p><p>“It’s not any different,” Dumbledore said.</p><p>“What?" </p><p>“I agree. What I did is not any different from what Voldemort does to his followers.”</p><p>Sirius’ mouth was hanging open like a broken Nutcracker. He had expected Dumbledore to argue with him, or at least passively deny his accusation. “What?”</p><p>“Mr. Black, if I am to understand things correctly, you were posed and ready to attack Mr. Pettigrew the moment he left the Leaky Cauldron. Is that true?”</p><p>“Yes, but—“</p><p>“And you would have not, shall we say, come quietly? Had I approached you and asked you to abandon your post?”</p><p>“Fucking obviously.”</p><p>“But it is, as I am about to explain to you, of significant importance that we speak now. And I do not mean significant importance to me, or you, or even the Order. It is of significant importance to your godson,” Dumbledore paused.</p><p>Sirius felt a dull blush creep up his neck. How dare Dumbledore talk about Harry like Sirius wouldn’t do anything for him, without hesitation or question.</p><p>Dumbledore looked at the other armchair before continuing. “Forgive me for making the assumption that you would want to do what is best for Mr. Potter, even if the ends did not necessarily justify the means.”</p><p>“Fine, whatever. You had to get us—me – here. I’m here. What do you want?”</p><p>Sirius tried to ignore his momentary lapse. <em>There wasn’t any us anymore,</em> he reminded himself harshly. <em>There isn’t anything anymore. James and Lily are dead. Peter betrayed them. Harry is all I have. Rem--</em></p><p>He didn’t allow his thoughts to go any further than that.</p><p>“It is about what has to happen next,” Dumbledore said slowly.</p><p>“What has to happen next?”</p><p>“Well,” Dumbledore hesitated. “It’s a bit complicated.”</p><p>“How is it complicated? He’ll live with me.”</p><p>Sirius thought this entire ordeal Dumbledore was putting them-- <em>him</em>-- through was unnecessary bullshit. Although he would never admit it, Dumbledore had prevented him from making a grave mistake. Peter was alive, and everyone knew he had been the one to betray Lily and James. There wasn’t anything to prevent him from caring for Harry—so why was Dumbledore acting like there was?</p><p>“I’m afraid it’s not that simple,” Dumbledore repeated. “Mr. Black, you are Harry’s godfather.”</p><p>“Thanks, but I was actually aware of that already.”</p><p>“I’m sure you were,” Dumbledore replied evenly. “As I am sure you were aware you are not Harry’s sole godparent.”</p><p><em>No</em>. “No.”</p><p>“No?” Dumbledore looked politely puzzled. Sirius wanted to slap him. “I was under the impression that Mr. Potter and Ms. Evans had you named in the same ceremony.”</p><p>Sirius felt like he had been frozen, veins screaming in pain as they were filled with ice. “You know they did,” he said. “You were there.”</p><p>Dumbledore inclined he head slightly. “Yes.”</p><p>“He can’t have him.” The words tumbled out of Sirius’ mouth before he could stop them. He ignored the crack in his voice. </p><p>“Well, I’m afraid then neither can you,” Dumbledore replied.</p><p>“What? Why not? It's not like..." he trailed off. <em>It's not like werewolves are allowed custody.</em></p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw the figure in the plaid armchair shift forward slightly. He doubled his efforts to deliberately ignore it, but felt his cheeks heat up at the unspoken statement. Dumbledore’s face remained as impassive as ever.</p><p>“As I have said, he has two godparents—” Dumbledore held up a hand when Sirius opened his mouth to interrupt again. “Mr. Black, I must ask you to keep quiet until I have finished. This is old magic, ancient magic that I don’t fully understand myself—“</p><p>“Shocking,” Sirius scoffed.</p><p>Dumbledore continued, as if he had not heard him at all. “The Kinder Charm is very similar to the Fidelius and Patronus Charms. In fact, one might even call them triplicates in many ways.”</p><p>“For example, all three charms must be housed inside a living human soul. They are also powerful protections against dark magic, and in many ways, infallible.”</p><p>Dumbledore paused, looking contemplative. Sirius thought he knew what he was getting at, but refused to believe what Dumbledore was saying could be true.</p><p>“When Mr. Potter named you godfather, the Kinder Charm bonded you to Harry and imbibed you both with an unbreakable magical vow. The oath you took that day not only meant you were agreeing to act as guardian, should anything happen to Mr. Potter or Ms. Evans.”</p><p>There was a sharp intake of breathe from the plaid armchair. Sirius was frozen in his chair, terrified of the implication Dumbledore was making. </p><p>“The oath also created a magical force meant to protect Harry. This force lives inside of you, Mr. Black, much in the same way a Patronus lives inside the witch or wizard who casts it.”</p><p>“James chose me,” Sirius said quietly. “James chose me to protect Harry.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “In a manner of speaking.”</p><p>“I still don’t see the problem. A wizard can only choose one person for the Kinder charm. It’s why James and Lily had to cast them separately, so that Re—“ he trailed off.<br/> There was an awkward pause. He cleared his throat, still not looking at the plaid armchair. “So that there could be two godparents.”</p><p>“Exactly. Two godparents,” Dumbledore smiled at him. “By casting the charm separately, they imbibed two souls with the magical force meant to protect Harry. It is unusual—many witches and wizards feel that two godparents weakens the charm.”</p><p>Sirius felt a hard lump form in this throat. “James thought the opposite,” he said thickly. “Lily too.”</p><p>“They were not wrong,” Dumbledore replied gently. “At the very least, the Kinder Charm still works the same way with two souls as it does with one. I believe that Mr. Potter and Ms. Evans identified a factor in the charm that many witches and wizards ignore.”</p><p>“What factor?” Please don’t let it be love.</p><p>“Choice,” Dumbledore smiled at him. “You can tell a great deal about a wizard based on the choices he makes. If two wizards were to choose to come together to protect a child, I do believe it would make the charm stronger.”</p><p>Sirius felt the wave of realization. “Oh.”</p><p>“Yes,” Dumbledore agreed sagely. “Oh.”</p><p>“So that means…we…”</p><p>“You’ve hit the nail on the head Mr. Black, or so they say. In the event that two godparents are chosen, both must come together for the charm to work. Under different circumstances, such troublesome magical nuance wouldn’t matter. However, Harry is in a unique and extraordinarily dangerous position.”</p><p>Sirius glanced at the plaid armchair. “What would it mean? For the godparents to come together?”</p><p>Dumbledore leaned back in his chair, fingers tented under his chin thoughtfully. “I think it would mean they would have to raise the child together. Be a family. Love and care for the child, and to a certain degree, each other.”</p><p>There was another awkward pause. Dumbledore gave a funny little cough before finishing. “Though I don’t think there are any…er…specific romantic obligations.”</p><p>Sirius felt his ears pink, and the plaid armchair gave a loud squeak. “Er,” he mumbled. “Right…well. What if the godparents can’t? Do that?”</p><p>“I need to know that you are both unwilling to do this.” Dumbledore turned to the plaid armchair. When he had the confirmation he needed, he turned back to Sirius.</p><p>Sirius hesitated. “I want to know what the alternative is first.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. “There is an alternative that would offer similar protective charms.”</p><p>Sirius frowned. “And what would that be?”</p><p>“A similar magical bond is formed between blood relatives. It is like the Kinder Charm, but exists unintentionally—not in a person’s soul, but in their blood. Harry would have to live with someone who is directly related to him. There is only one surviving blood relative, I’m afraid. Ms. Evans sister, Petunia.“</p><p>Sirius was shaking his head before Dumbledore finished his sentence. “That awful woman? No. No way. Absolutely not.”</p><p>Dumbledore looked between Sirius and the plaid armchair. “I’m afraid this has to be a mutual agreement between the two of you. I’m also afraid you need to decide now. Hagrid is already escorting young Mr. Potter to his aunts house as we speak.”</p><p>Sirius tilted his head slightly to the left. The figure in the armchair was staring at him, but Sirius still couldn’t bring himself to look back properly. He saw the figure extend an arm towards him. And after a moment’s hesitation, there was a warm hand gently brushing his forearm. Sirius closed his eyes.</p><p>Clean laundry drying in the sun. Freshly dug dirt. Warm milk. Baby powder. Harry laughing for the first time.</p><p>At long last, Sirius looked back at the plaid armchair. Grey eyes locked with hazel for the first time in too many months. He gave a tiny nod and Remus let go of his arm.</p><p>“Mr. Lupin? Mr. Black? I’m afraid time is of the essence.”</p><p>After a beat, Remus finally spoke for the first time.</p><p>“How fast can we get to Surrey?”</p>
