    <p>There came a knock on the front door of the house at 4 Privet Drive.  It was a very normal house, inhabited by rather unremarkable family.  </p>
<p>Petunia Dursley opened the door, taking a short break from trying to coax her one year old son to eat breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outside stood two police officers, looking quite grim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One, thin and blonde with a wide, flat face; the other shorter, wider, with graying red hair and dark circles beneath his eyes.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" Petunia asked, "Is my husband okay?"  Her greatest fear was that something terrible would happen to her husband Vernon while he driving to and from work, she saw all these horrible auto accidents in the news every day and knew that Vernon liked to drive as quickly as he could get away with.</p>
<p>"Are you Petunia Dursley,"  the blond officer asked in a slow, even tone, "sister of Lily Evans?” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Petunia had not heard that name in quite a long time.  She'd tried very hard not to think about her sister over the years, and until that day, Petunia had even managed to near succeed in that regard.</p>
<p>"Yes."  Petunia said in a dull voice, "What's she done now?"  The blond officer and the red-haired officer exchange a glance.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Dursley, we are sorry to inform you that your sister died last night.  She appears to have been living in a vacant building, and there was an explosion.  The investigation is ongoing, but your sister has been identified among the deceased."  the blond officer explained, the red-haired officer nodded along.</p>
<p>"Oh."  Petunia had nothing to say, she'd cut Lily out of her life years ago, after their father's funeral.  "You said there were others who died?"  Petunia had met a few of her sister's friends, they were all a strange, and completely untrustworthy lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Petunia would never trust the likes of those freaks her sister was always spending her time with, they were a bunch of criminals no doubt.</p>
<p>"We've found five bodies so far."  The red-haired officer said, picking up where the blonde officer left off, "The investigation is ongoing.”</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?"  Petunia asked, not quite sure why the police officers had come.  They could have called, or simply sent a notice.  "Is there paperwork I need to sign?" Another unreadable glance flew between the officers.</p>
<p>"Well, Mrs. Dursley, there is the matter of your nephew."  The red-haired officer said.  Petunia blinked.</p>
<p>"My what?"  Petunia hadn't heard anything about Lily having children, "Are you sure he's Lily’s?"</p>
<p>"We were able to locate the birth certificate."  the blond officer assured her, "Harry Evans, born July 31, 1980.  He survived the explosion.  It’s almost miraculous, he was right in the epicenter, but he survived."  he said, holding up his hands as though to placate her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Petunia’s face took on a pinched expression, the boy’s welfare was the least of her concerns at the moment.</p>
<p>"Usually, in cases like these, the closest relatives are the ones to take the child in."  The red-haired officer gave Petunia an assessing look.  "It is not required of course, but the child's mother is dead, and there is no father listed on the birth certificate.  He can either live with family, or be placed in the care of the state.”</p>
<p>Petunia wanted nothing to do with Lily's child.  She'd never met the boy, and she hardly wanted such criminal influences anywhere near her own son.  But the red-haired officer had said that it would be normal for her to take in her nephew, and Petunia could scarcely imagine the scandal that would occur if her neighbors learned that she'd left her orphaned nephew to the care of the government.  They would wonder if she and Vernon were unable to support a second child, or if they'd been deemed unfit.</p>
<p>No, Petunia couldn't allow that.  Surely a second child couldn't be that difficult to manage.  Food, water, a place to sleep, it wasn't that much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The blonde officer was already giving her a strange look, Petunia forced her expression into some semblance of concern for the boy.</p>
<p>"What do I need to do?"  Petunia asked.  The officers looked immensely relieved.</p>
<p>When Harry Evans was released from the hospital some days later, the small cut on his forehead properly cared for, and the various scrapes and bruises that resulted from the explosion disinfected and bandaged, his aunt and uncle were waiting for him in the hospital lobby with strained smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>The nurse who carried Harry out to his relatives was cooing over the boy, he’d become quite well liked by the nurses in the children’s ward, being a cheerful baby, prone to fits of giggles whenever any of the nurses made a funny face in his direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nurse said her goodbyes, wishing Petunia and Vernon the best, and assuring them that Harry was going to be a lovely addition to their family.</p>
<p>Harry began to cry as soon as he was placed in his aunt's arms, and the cries turned into shrieking screams when Petunia tried to quiet the boy.  The nurse only smiled ruefully, “You know how children are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Petunia held the boy rigidly in her arms, with the paperwork signed and stamped, she and Vernon quickly retreated to the car, Harry screaming all the while.</p>
<p>That first meeting set the tone for ten years to come.</p>
