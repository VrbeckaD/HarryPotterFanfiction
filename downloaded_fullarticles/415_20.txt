<hr/><p> </p><p align="center">Chapter 1: The return</p><p> </p><p align="justify">   He was laying there on the snow, feeling so alone, why would his mother bring him here? she said their lives would be better, he would have many friends and would have someone to be his forever, he didn't quite understand what that meant but he knew it was something nice, and this wasn´t nice, mother had lied, she took him to a horrible place and away from father.</p><p align="justify">   Severus shook the bad memories and took on the sight before him, not snow but the weather of a warm spring before him. He hardly remembered the town but there was something undeniably familiar about the place, about how everything together made the town, how the people moved, the smell floating in the air, the noise...he noticed how quickly him standing there was gathering attention. In the previews days of the journey here he had revisited his memories of this place, he knew the community was a very closed one even if the population wasn't so small, a new face was something to talk about and he wanted to avoid that as much as possible, who knew and maybe he would be out of their hair before any question arises.</p><p align="justify">   Knowing what was ahead as a stranger in a closed community he braced himself for a long walk, even when he would have preferred to stop to eat something at the local tavern first.</p><p align="justify">   The little house was where it was supposed to and in obvious state of neglect, but it was there, and it was a roof, as far as he could see there wasn’t much damage and he could very well, with a few arrangements, live there.</p><p align="justify">   It would be fine, he told himself.</p><p align="justify">   As an adult he had come to terms with his childhood and understood that what he remembered as horrible times were not. His Mother had been ill long before coming here and would have passed away probably sooner had she stayed with father... he didn't know that back then.</p><p align="justify">   He sighed and made his way towards the door, he could make this work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   James entered the place in the same manner he entered everywhere, invading, leaving his things all along the way and occupying as much space as possible. Sirius put his book aside and prepared.</p><p align="justify">– so...</p><p align="justify">– so...?</p><p align="justify">– you know the new talk of the town? – he started as he let himself fall on the couch.</p><p align="justify">– enlighten me – he said dramatically.</p><p align="justify">– there is a new guy.</p><p align="justify">– what you mean? – he asked patiently.</p><p align="justify">– A strange guy just walked in two weeks ago, he stayed– James continued as if he had said something interesting. Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p align="justify">– o James, the greatest, would you stop the cockiness and tell me the full story already.</p><p align="justify">– Fine– he snorted but sat determined–. So, two weeks ago this guy walks in, doesn't stop at any of the shops, does not ask anyone for directions, does not interact with anyone at all, just walk right by the town and into the road.</p><p align="justify">– why didn't anyone stop him? – Most people who visited the town came because they were aware of its magical nature, most people here were magical users or related to one, there were magical communities in other places, but this was the largest settlement.</p><p align="justify">The town was so far away from any other that hardly anyone ever visited just as a passerby.</p><p align="justify">– Some people noticed him, but he seemed so sure of where he was or where he was going... I asked Madame Rosmerta– the owner of the tavern–. And she said that he had this way about him, like he had a purpose, so she figured he might be a friend of ours, mine o maybe Remus´s, since we travel a lot. The thing is they didn't want to question a friend of the lords.</p><p align="justify">– Then …is he a friend of someone?</p><p align="justify">– I'm getting to it, so he walks by and then that's the last thing they know about him, word goes around and people started to get worried, nobody comes forward with information and yet none of the lords went to introduce him either, no one had seen him.</p><p align="justify">– what... – Sirius was now frowning–. How long has this been going on? does anyone know where this guy is?</p><p align="justify">– He walked into town again yesterday to buy supplies, apparently, he is fixing a house– James answered dismissing his concern.</p><p align="justify">– In who's land? – James seemed to think about it.</p><p align="justify">– You know, that is actually a good question – Sirius stood up.</p><p align="justify">– Grab your things, were going.</p><p align="justify">– What? where?</p><p align="justify">– To find out where this guy is.</p><p align="justify">– O come on, there is no need to be like that– he laughed a little.</p><p align="justify">– A stranger comes into town, doesn't talk to anybody and goes into hiding, next week he will come and kill everybody in their sleep – James stood up following.</p><p align="justify">– You are totally exaggerating and I'm only going to control your mess.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   Severus was walking the carpenter through the house, explaining the arrangements he was planning to make when they heard horses. They went out to receive the visitors.</p><p align="justify">He waited until they stopped in front of his garden. He heard Tom, the carpenter, greet them.</p><p align="justify">– Is there a problem? – The two guys looked around his age and had that air around them that wealthy people have.</p><p align="justify">– No necessarily, we are just here to ensure everything is fine, you have made the people in town quite uneasy– and Severus understood why, but he had hope for a few more days of quietness.</p><p align="justify">– I had not such intentions, I’m just looking to spend here a few seasons, not to cause any trouble.</p><p align="justify">– We are from the Potter and Black House, our families own the neighbor lands – Severus looked at them with more attention, after so many years he could not recognize them, but he thought he had a pretty good guess of who exactly they were.</p><ul>
<li>Snape – He introduce himself living his first name out.</li>
</ul><p align="justify">– Snape…this land belongs to a friend of ours, so you can imagine our surprise at finding you here – Severus hesitated a little at hearing that. These lands were his by right, or at least that was the case when he left. He had a contract with the Black family and wasn’t sure if that meant they could take possession of the land if they thought him death.</p><p align="justify">– I have papers– he quickly went inside to get them. As he looked over the documents he had to pause a little. These pieces of fragile paper had been subject of many internal conflicts for him. Over the years, when things got difficult the thought of selling had come often, as he was rich in title and land but poor on his pockets, only the thought of his mother had stopped him.</p><p align="justify">   James saw him getting into the house and turned to Sirius.</p><p align="justify">–    What do you think?</p><ul>
<li>There is no way he could have any papers on this land– he said somber. Out of all places he hadn’t expected to find the man here.</li>
<li>He may have inherited it– was suggested in a soft voice, Sirius turned abruptly at the implication.</li>
<li>That’s not possible, I would know – James straightened surprised and Sirius could tell he wanted to ask, but this was not the place–. What did he say his name was? – he changed the subject.</li>
</ul><p align="justify">– Snape – James answered distracted.</p><p align="justify">– His first name is Severus– Tom interrupted, Sirius and James paused.</p><p align="justify">– He told you that? – Tom nodded.</p><p align="justify">– No wonder he looked familiar, is Severus, and of course he would come here, this are his lands– he said turning to look at Sirius–. This is so ridiculous– and then he started laughing.</p><p align="justify">– Is everything alright? – Severus came out carrying the papers.</p><p align="justify">– o yes, I'm sorry this is just some terrible misunderstanding– he got off the horse–. You are Severus Prince, are you not?</p><p align="justify">– Prince was my mother's name, I go by my father's name now.</p><p align="justify">– Of course – he gave a huge smiled and seemed genuinely happy–. So, you came back at last. Tom you can tell everyone in the town that they can sleep tight tonight, the stranger it's not after all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">   Everyone was gossiping at the three broomsticks and honestly, he could understand the frenzy.</p><p align="justify">– So, he is a Lord then– Rosmerta said.</p><p align="justify">– I understand that his father was a common man and a muggle, but his mother was of high birth and magical, so he is half, and of course he inherited the land– said Tom who was present at the encounter and had memorized all the details for later explanation–. So yes, he would be one of the Lords.</p><p align="justify">– And what is he going to do with the land? if he wasn't interested before why now? is he planning on selling? He must know that not just anyone is welcome here.</p><p align="justify">– I don't think he is selling, he had an interesting set up, he is harvesting plants.</p><p align="justify">–Then isn't he planning in building a house?</p><p align="justify">– He has a house.</p><p align="justify">– What? the little chateau? – she said as if the sole idea was offensive–. Isn't that a little too small? I thought it was like a camping house for hunting.</p><p align="justify">– Well he called me because he is fixing it, so i don't think he will move out anytime soon.</p><p align="justify">– mmmh– madam Rosmerta kept on working behind the bar drying cups obsessively and obviously not convinced about the good nature of their new Lord–. And what is he harvesting? something interesting? it would be nice if he had brought some spices.</p><p align="justify">–About that –Tom smiled, he had been very pleased when he heard of this –. He is planting herbs, for his potions, he is a potionist – Sirius heard the excitement of those who were listening. They were a pretty self-functional community but there was some aspects on which they were lacking. James had proved to be a valuable asset, his traveling not only brought tales of adventures, but useful supplies to the people in town, but because of the delicate nature of them he could not carry potions in grand quantities and the traders who visited the town sell them at outrageous prices</p><p align="justify">– what kind?</p><p align="justify">– all kinds, he is a master potionist, he has studies on the subject – they kept on talking but he disconnected from the conversation and James who was sitting with him at a table in the corner turned to look at him.</p><p align="justify">– Quite the development ah? – Sirius just nodded and there was a small silence between them–. You know...I never brought him up because in some part of my mind i thought he might be dead, I guess it never occurred to me that you would know about that– Sirius hurried his drink –. So how is it ?...that you know…- he continued when Sirius didn’t answer –. Come on, you can tell me, is it like a magical feeling…?</p><p align="justify">– Don’t be dense, the contract is intact – he gave him a bored look.</p><p align="justify">– You still have that?</p><p align="justify">–Mother kept it, she thinks I don’t know about it – a few months after Severus disappeared he had found it by accident. Being Severus a half blood, Eileen Prince, his mother, had wanted to magically bind him to the house of Black and the land to secure his position as the heir and so that his father could never take possession on his behalf. Magical contracts like that burned away if one of the parts died.</p><p align="justify">–Well I guess it makes sense, I thought it was something more interesting– Sirius shrugged–. What are you going to do?</p><p align="justify">–About what?</p><p align="justify">–He is going to be here for a while…</p><p align="justify">–I’m sure we can coexist without bothering each other.</p><p align="justify">–He can, he was never the problem to begin with, you on the other hand – he looks at him seriously –. And anyway, that’s not what i meant.</p><p align="justify">– And what did you mean? – James just looked at him in a way that unnerved him.</p><p align="justify">– How are things going with Nymphadora? –Sirius breathed deeply before putting some money on the table and standing up–. You’re leaving?</p><p align="justify">– I had quite the day. I’m going to head upstairs– James let him go without much protest knowing the subject had gotten too sensitive.</p><p align="justify">   He rented a room, not because he was too tired to go home, but to hide in and postpone confronting his mother, he didn’t want to talk of the subject when he didn’t even know how to handle it himself.         </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
