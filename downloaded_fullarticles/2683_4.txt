It was chilling," Ron said coming out of the bathroom, making his way to the bed.</p><p>"Let's hope it was really the last time this time," Hermione replied.</p><p>"Now as for what I mentioned before we had to help save the world once again. Our remarriage..."</p><p>"When should we plan for?" Hermione asked, smiling down at her husband who was already lounging in bed with a heated grin, watching her change into her simple sleeping wear of shorts and a thin cotton top that clung to her curves.</p><p>"Anytime. I'd do it tomorrow if you wanted."</p><p>"I'd love to have Rose and Hugo there though. Perhaps over the holiday? We can have a small get-together too."</p><p>Ron nodded thoughtfully and then his smile grew. "You know I'm horribly impatient, but I think you've got a point. Let's wait for the kids."</p><p>Hermione smiled brightly at her husband and kissed him as she got into bed. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer. "Besides, Mum would kill me if she wasn't invited and had the chance to help you plan another party."</p><p>Hermione laughed. "Are you seriously thinking of your mother while snogging me, Ronald Weasley?"</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. "Can't help it. I'm excited."</p><p>Hermione placed her hand lovingly against the side of his face. "Me too. I love you."</p><p>He smiled roguishly then and pushed her firmly into the mattress, smothering her with a passionate kiss. His large hand trailed up her stomach, tickling her slightly, causing her to wriggle against him. "Not too tired?" he asked, hopeful.</p><p>"Not at all," she replied, and pulled him down for another kiss.</p>
<hr/><p>Later, she rolled over and burrowed into the blankets on her side of the bed. A contented smile grew over her face as she let her eyes close on the precipice of sleep.</p><p>Almost immediately she was met with the vision of Malfoy's smiling face in her mind's eye, and just as rapidly, she opened her eyes with a startling jump.</p><p>"You okay over there?" Ron mumbled.</p><p>"Yes. Sleepy twitch."</p><p>"Hmmm," Ron responded. Then his body fully relaxed and she knew he was out.</p><p>But sleep didn't come for her. She remained on her side, clutching the blankets as though they could protect her from her thoughts as she stared vacantly at the wall across the room. She feared that the moment her eyes closed she'd see his face again. The only option was to refuse to shut them. Yet even that didn't set her mind at ease for the same, strange twinge in her stomach was there. Just like it had been earlier that day.</p><p>
        <em>"Hermione Granger, I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger."</em>
      </p><p>At first she thought he was being rude as usual. On the verge of being contrary because he couldn't possibly bear to do what she demanded. She turned, ready to tell him off, but was caught off guard by the most charming of smiles she'd ever seen. Draco Malfoy was smiling at her. <em>"And I'm mildly enjoying it."</em></p><p>And in that moment, as her ears registered the flirtatious tone and she read the playfulness in his eyes, time and space froze. Her stomach flipped and filled with the most unwanted butterflies. She knew her cheeks flushed and she'd thanked the dim light for cover.</p><p>But it was only a moment, and before she could even fathom a response, for once at a complete loss for words, his son had cut in, probably embarrassed: <em>"Dad..."</em></p><p>She turned away just as rapidly as he did then, and took her position, willing herself to focus on the task at hand.</p><p>Now, here she was, thinking of that moment again in bed. It hadn't surfaced all day. Not with all of the commotion and the emotional toll of seeing Voldemort again. Then being with Harry for awhile back at his place along with Ron and Ginny, to support him after witnessing his parents' murder.</p><p>Her thoughts circled on him for what felt like ages. Everything he'd ever said in their childhood. Everything he'd said in the past few months. Somehow, he'd become someone else in her mind. Not the one dimensional bully she grew up with, but a man with fear and the apparent capacity for love. It jarred her. And the night crept slowly, silently by, providing no solace or distraction from her tormented thoughts.</p></div></div></div>
