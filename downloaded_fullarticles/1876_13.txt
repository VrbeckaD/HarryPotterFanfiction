    <p>Severus Snape had been nursing a deep love for his best friend for a very, very, long time. It was a love so intense and burning that sometimes he felt as though it gave him acidity that no amount of antacid could help. So, one day after a serious joust with the toilet bowl, Severus decided to hitch up his britches and be a man about it. He would tell Lily about how he felt. </p><p>Severus found Lily in the library, studying for her OWLs with the kind of academic mania usually associated with Ravenclaws. “Lily, come for a walk with me,” he whispered. Lily replied by bugging out her eyes and making garbled hissing sounds, gesticulating wildly to her textbook. Severus helpfully packed her things away and carried his flailing friend outside. It was lucky she was so small. </p><p>Having placed her on the ground near the lake, Severus advised her, “Take a walk. You haven’t been outside in ages. Relax for a bit, and you can get back to studying later.”</p><p>Lily sighed and realized the wisdom of her friend’s words and took his hand. “I suppose you’re right,” she said, and began to meander about the lake. “So, how’re your studies going?” She asked Severus. </p><p>“Fine,” Severus said, grimacing when he felt his tummy rumble. </p><p>Lily looked down. “Again, Sev? You should get your stomach checked out, I’m worried about you.”</p><p>“It’s nothing. It’ll go away.” As soon as I confess my feelings for you, Severus hoped. “Lily.”</p><p>“Yeah, Sev?”</p><p>Severus took a deep breath. “I love you.”</p><p>“Aw, I love you too, Sev,” Lily said, and pinched his cheek.</p><p>Severus goggled at the stupidity of womankind. “No, you mad goose, I love you. Lily,” he said, stopping and bracing his hands on her shoulders, “I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Lily looked gobsmacked. “S-Sev!”</p><p>“I’ve loved you for ages, since we were just children. It’s been eating me alive and giving me acidity so bad that I’ve had to shift my bed closer to the washroom. I’d do anything for you, Lily, anything in the world.”</p><p>Lily put a hand to her chest. “Sev, I had no idea!” She looked down, and tears began to pool in her eyes. </p><p>Severus panicked. “Lily, why are you crying-“</p><p>“Because I don’t!” She cried. “I love you so much, but not like that! I love you more than anyone in the world, but like...like...my brother!”</p><p>Gross. </p><p>“Gross,” Severus said, reminded horribly of the Black brothers. </p><p>“Sev, I’m sorry!” </p><p>“Me too,” he grimaced. “Er, there, there,” he said, patting her on the head as she continued to cry. </p><p>“I can’t believe that this is happening!” Lily continued to sob, “I dont want to lose you, Sev!”</p><p>“You won’t,” Severus sighed. Because no matter how Lily felt about him, he would never dream of leaving her. “My love isn’t so shallow or selfish as that.”</p><p>“Oh Sev!” Lily cried gratefully, and hugged him. Upstairs in Gryffindor tower, James Potter watched the exchange with narrowed eyes, completely misunderstood the situation when he saw Lily Evans embrace Snape, and flung himself upon Sirius’ bed and began to cry about how Evans had forsaken him, hold me Sirius and make the pain go away.</p><p>“We’re friends, right, Sev?” Lily asked. “Best friends?”</p><p>“Oh, rather,” Severus agreed, noticing that his stomach had stopped rumbling. “There’s really no one else I would give that position to.”</p><p>“Severus and Lily, best mates for life,” Lily grinned. </p><p>“Mates,” Severus scoffed. “Really, Lily, how plebeian of you.”</p><p>Lily giggled. That was the grouchy Sev with a heart of gold that she knew and loved. </p><p>“At any rate,” Severus said, “I was hoping to take you as my partner to the Yule Ball,” he said. “Would you like to go with me, as friends? Or is there someone else?” When Lily looked guilty, Severus gasped. “It’s not Potter, is it? Oh god, Lily, why would you do something so foolish-“</p><p>“Don’t be so silly,” Lily snorted, and Severus breathed a sigh of relief. “It’s just that I was planning to ask Remus. Poor thing wasn’t going to go this year, and I wanted to make sure that he did.”</p><p>Snape hummed in thought. “So it’s a pity date.”</p><p>“Don’t say that-“</p><p>“If I find someone else to take Lupin,” Severus said, regretting his magnanimous nature, “will you go with me?”</p><p>Lily startled. “Really? You’d find Remus a date?”</p><p>“If it means rescuing you from a very plain and beige date, then yes.”</p><p>“Remus isn’t plain, or beige-“ Lily started to defend her friend, but was cut short by Severus.</p><p>“The man is the walking definition of neutral,” he said. “Once, I was in the library, and I was leaning against a shelf, when it was actually Lupin in a brown sweater,” Severus said. “He just stood there for ten minutes, and then he goes, ‘Alright, Severus?’ Damn near have me a heart attack!”</p><p>Lily burst into peals of laughter. “You- you stood against him for ten whole minutes?”</p><p>“He could have said something, anything!” Severus seethed. </p><p>“He was being nice,” Lily said, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes. “Are you really serious about helping find him a real date?”</p><p>“Yes,” Severus said grudgingly. “It’s Yule, Lily, and I don’t want you to be stuck with Mr. I Masquerade As A Bookshelf just because of your kind heart.”</p><p>Lily burst out laughing again, and Severus felt that for once, maybe things would be alright. </p><p>……………………………………</p><p>“Lily, you don’t have to do this,” Remus said for the umpteenth time, as the red headed menace dragged him to the great hall.</p><p>“I feel terrible for letting you down, Remus, so setting you up is the least I can do,” Lily stressed. </p><p>“And you entrusted Severus to find me a date?” Remus asked, quirking an eyebrow up. “There really is a limit to fruitless optimism.”</p><p>Lily found Snape and dragged Remus over. “Here he is, Sev. Where’s your person?”</p><p>From behind Snape stepped out a tiny, surly, Regulus Black. He eyed Remus up and down before nodding. “He’ll do.”</p><p>Severus beamed. “Problem solved,” he said, patting himself on the back, while Regulus went over to stand next to a bemused Lupin.</p><p>“Hello, Regulus,” Remus said evenly. “Although I’m not opposed to taking you to the ball, I have to ask why you want me to take you.”</p><p>Regulus fixed his cold, grey, eyes - so much like his brother’s - on Remus. “Well, I’m a fourth year, so I need an upper year to take me. Also, I was originally going to go with Sev to piss Sirius off, but you’re so much better,” he enthused. </p><p>“I’m glad,” Remus said blandly. </p><p>“Well, now that that is set, we shall need to discuss our outfits. I will buy you robes, so that we may match. However, I expect a corsage, Lupin, and chocolates. Come, we have much to plan,” he said, dragging Remus off to parts unknown. </p><p>Lily looked unsurely after Remus, who was allowing Regulus to yammer away about fabrics, and colour schemes, and ‘I like daisies, make sure that there are daisies in the corsage,’ while Remus looked mildly amused. </p><p>“They’ll be alright, won’t they?” She asked.</p><p>Severus, who couldn’t possibly care less, nodded. “It’ll be fine.”</p><p>………………………………………</p><p>The night of the Yule Ball, the Marauders met in the Gryffindor common room. Sirius had his arm through his date Marlene McKinnon’s, while James was pouting next to Peter, whom he was going stag with. They were waiting on Remus, who was actually putting an effort into his appearance. </p><p>And by golly did that effort pay off. </p><p>Remus walked down the staircase in dark blue robes with a black trim, which contrasted beautifully with his pale, champagne colored eyes. They fit wonderfully on his lithe figure, accentuating, well... everything. </p><p>Jaws dropped and dates were abandoned as people flocked to Remus. Sirius, true to form, gravitated towards the box of chocolates in Remus’ hand. “Double chocolate truffles, my favorite!” He grinned toothily.</p><p>Remus beat his hand aside gently and held the box out of reach. “Shoo. They’re for my date.”</p><p>James let out a mewl of sadness. “Date? I thought you were going stag with Wormy and me, Moony!”</p><p>“Lily helped set me up,” Remus said mildly. “I’m meeting her and my date in the great hall. Shall we go?”</p><p>James moped the entire way, even with Peter promising to dance with him for at least one song. At the entrance hall, James felt his heart fall through his stomach and down his intestines as he saw Lily, looking radiant on Snape’s arm. He buried his face in Peter’s shoulder and sobbed. </p><p>Remus’ eyes searched the great hall for his date, and was not disappointed when Regulus came sweeping over in his fine dress robes and stopped in front of him. Remus smiled and held out the chocolates. </p><p>“Double chocolate truffles!” Regulus enthused, “My favorite! Ooh, and you got me a corsage! Black daisies!”</p><p>Remus slipped in on Regulus’ wrist, even as Sirius fell into a dead faint in Marlene’s arms. “It’s handmade. I charmed the daisies to match your robes.”</p><p>This was apparently the correct thing to say, as Regulus beamed a mile wide. “That’s thoughtful,” he remarked. “The ball’s starting, lets go in. Did you practice your dancing?”</p><p>“I did,” Remus said, taking Regulus’ arm. Lily swept over to join him with Snape, who looked...not displeasing. </p><p>Dumbledore waltzed over at that moment with Professor Kettleburn on his arm, and beamed at the foursome. “What a wonderful show of inter-house unity! Take ten points each to Gryffindor and Slytherin, and an extra five to Slytherin for young Mr. Black’s wonderful fashion sense,” he said, ruffling Regulus’ hair. </p><p>Regulus beamed and dragged Remus away to dance, showing off his corsage at every turn, while Remus smiled serenely. Lily giggled as she watched the pair. “Sev, we may have just set up the next great love story.”</p><p>“My joy is unparalleled,” Snape deadpanned. “I tire of looking at the beige-man and his date. Let’s dance,” he said, and whisked Lily off. </p><p>The rest of the night was spent with Regulus and Remus eating chocolate truffles, Lily and Severus cutting a platonic rug, James hugging Peter and pretending that he was Lily, Peter being very disturbed, and Sirius glaring at his brother with red eyes.</p><p>It was a very merry Yule indeed.</p>
