    <p>The only sign of tension in Daphne was the way she had crumpled the piece of parchment in her palm. It was an odd invitation, but she had seen Granger write it before passing it to her. The muggle born was not generally one for conspiracy or pranking, but the Slytherin in her couldn't help but be suspicious as she stepped into the abandoned classroom.</p><p>"Daphne?" The voice that called out to her from the shadows was husky and hesitant.</p><p>"Hello. You wanted to see me privately?" She walked deeper into the dusty and obviously abandoned room.</p><p>"Thank you for coming." Hermione stepped into the light that seemed to come from no where. "I wasn't sure that you would."</p><p>"How could I resist such an intriguing invitation?" She let a coy smile play about her lips and hoped that her humor would not be used against her.</p><p>When the curly haired brunette stopped in front of one of the filthy desks, she noticed that a slim book rested atop the dust. Her brow crinkled at the oddness of this moment. <em>Why bring me here to show me a book? Doesn't she have enough study friends for such things?</em></p><p>"I found that book on the floor outside the Great Hall two days ago." Daphne arched one brow. A lost item outside of the Great Hall was hardly cause for comment. The other girl smiled in apparent acknowledgment of the point. "I might have only returned it to the library, but I started reading it."</p><p>At that, Daphne frowned at her in censure and concern. "You found an abandoned book and opened it? Did you at least make an effort to ensure that there wasn't some compulsion on it or take any precautions?"</p><p>Hermione's face flushed in answer. "I guess if you're so good at preventing such things, you don't really need my warning." She let out a fast breath. "But I thought you should know that I found your timetable, obviously copied, in a book of love and compulsion potions."</p><p>The idea of someone actually targeting her hit like a punch to the gut. "Bloody hellâ€¦" Daphne sank into a dusty desk chair. "You really mean it?"</p><p>The other girl's voice softened with sympathy. "I'm sorry to have brought you such a shock." She settled a gentle hand on her shoulder in support. Silence fell between them for a long moment.</p><p>As the moment drew on, the pureblood heiress drew a steadying breath and settled her hand on top of the other girl's. "I've always known that a time would come that others would target me this way." As she met the warm brown eyes of her peer, she found herself trusting in a way she feared she might lose the ability to do. Oddly, she wanted to confide in the earnest and well meaning girl.</p><p>"The House Greengrass follows strict primogeniture. I am the heir of one of the oldest and wealthiest houses in Magical Briton. As the oldest Greengrass, I have always known that I would eventually be an attractive prospect for grasping younger sons of poorer houses, but there are so few of us anymore that I thought I had a few years before I had to worry about it. I guess I'm too trusting. After all, it's one thing to consider in the hypothetical. It's an entirely different matter to try and decide which of our classmates wants to drug me into compliance."</p><p>"Oh Daphne! It's a dreadful thing to think of! I don't understand how you can be so calm at the idea of someone trying to force you into a relationship!" Hermione was obviously distressed on her behalf. In some odd way, it was reassuring to hear such outrage at the idea.</p><p>"You're very kind to be so appalled that someone would conspire to take my hand by compulsion. It's odd to think, but the fact that you find it so horrifying is, somehow, a comfort. As though it shouldn't be as normal as I've been taught to expect." She felt a cynical smile cross her lips.</p><p>"Of course it's not normal! What are you expected to do to protect yourself? Cast a revealing spell on everything before you touch it? Paint your nails with detection potions so that they change colors if there's contaminants? Why are you responsible for keeping someone else from stealing your will?" The girl's righteous indignation was so sincere that it drew Daphne in.</p><p>"You have a strong sense of justice, Hermione. It's refreshing." Her smile turned genuine. "I do have a responsibility to protect myself, but I don't believe that absolves whoever this is from their crimes." She waved a hand at the book and timetable. "Not everyone in our world would agree with me on that point."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "I wish that I could say the Muggle world was better about it, but victim blaming is still a common defense. Instead of 'She should have been more diligent.' It tends to be 'She shouldn't have been at that place.' Either way, it's still disgusting."</p><p>She hummed in agreement. <em>I wouldn't have thought that I would like you... Maybe there's more to you than I thought.</em> "There are a few things I could teach you to protect yourself. Would you be interested in learning them?"</p><p>"Yes! Absolutely!" Hermione gave a bright and relieved smile.</p><p>"Good." Daphne pointed her wand at the book. "You start by bringing your wand tip in a half circle, lefthandwise. As you reach the zenith point, you slash down and to the right. The incantation is revelium." The book lit up in a watery blue glow. "That means that there have been threatening spells associated with it in the past, but they are no longer effective. You'll find that on nearly any library book, I'm afraid."</p><p>"What if there was an active threat?" The other girl was obviously pleased by a new spell but also seemed disturbed by the idea of someone cursing books that everyone was expected to use.</p><p>"The colour will indicate the threat level and capacity for harm. Black is for mortally perilous. Red is for injurious. Purple is for compulsory. White is completely clear, and grey is inconclusive." She smiled at the sound of her voice mimicking her mother's lecture mode.</p><p>"Why would it be inconclusive?" She sounded concerned by the idea.</p><p>"Every spell has limitations. In this case, inconclusive could mean a poorly cast spell with bad intent. It could also mean that effort was made to conceal the spells that were cast or even that they were directed at a specific person but you aren't that target." She met Hermione's animated gaze. Her curiosity almost made her beautiful instead of simply pretty. "This is a family spell so most concealing spells won't fully obfuscate their presence. It isn't perfect, but most people won't have a way to defend against it fully."</p><p>When the other girl nodded, she continued. "Now, I want you to try it. Cast it on the book first since you know what the result should be."</p><p>It took a few tries, but soon the book was once again glowing a watery blue. Both girls grinned proudly at each other. "Very good! Do it a few more times to make sure you have it. Then we'll work on how to cast it so that only you see the results."</p>
