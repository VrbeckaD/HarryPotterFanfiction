    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Ten years on from the day that Voldemort died, the weekend of the second of May, 2008, there is a memorial.  It takes place on Sunday, the fourth, in the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the ceremony is to be simple: a series of speeches and readings outside on the lawn, followed by a reception in the great hall.</p><p>Among others, this memorial brings Professor Harry Potter to the village of Hogsmeade – to play the hero, just as he’s played since first stepping foot here.  He’s not usually to be seen in Hogsmeade at the weekend, but he’s a familiar sight as he lives and teaches at the school during the week.</p><p>It’s difficult to say where one can find Hogsmeade, because it refuses to be put on a map.  The village is in Scotland, nearly all would agree, and most would say that the scenery commits it to the Highlands, to the West, where the land begins to break and the sun sets in the promise of the ocean.</p><p>Beyond that, things get tricky.  The village is near Fort William, maybe.  Lochaber.  Perhaps Inverness, though that would likely take longer from London by train.</p><p>If Harry ever wants to know for certain, he’s aware, and he’s never told anyone that it’s a dream of his, he’ll have to find out for himself, by doing something boring like flying with a compass and a map and a stopwatch, fingerless gloves and a flask of hot tea.  He’s not sure he’s that sort of person – at least not at the age of twenty-seven, give it time – so he prefers to imagine where Hogsmeade might be from the clues.</p><p>The morning of the Hogwarts memorial, Professor Harry Potter arrives early in Hogsmeade, surely uncertain of exactly where he is.  He’s not wearing fingerless gloves.  It’s been just over a week since he took a walk through the Forest of Dean and he slept poorly this morning, but he’s clothed and he’s shaved and he’s had a shower, which counts him ready to face this excursion.  Emerging from the fire at the Three Broomsticks, he nods and grins awkwardly through the usual exchange with Rosmerta, who’s cleaning the beer taps to get them ready for the afternoon.</p><p>“Morning, Rosmerta.”</p><p>“<em>Mor</em>ning, Harry.”</p><p>Outside the pub, the sun here in Scotland (maybe) is high.  The air is fresh, and Harry walks with his hands in the pockets of his robes, which are purple and green, to be traditional.  He makes his way down the cobbled road through the centre of the village and then on to Hogwarts Castle, its terminus.  He passes through the tall iron gates, which open for him as he arrives.</p><p>The elves are already setting up.  There’s a group of them, maybe seven, on the lawn in front of Dumbledore’s white tomb, the fissured stone long fused with gold, its square structure a sentry on the bank of the lake.  Gathered on the lawn, the elves are retreating from each other, spreading out into a great, wide ring, snapping out magic with their small raised hands.</p><p>Between them, chairs appear, slotting into rows facing forwards but arranged to form a circle, cut with an aisle like a stone with a wand, and there’s another shape that’s missing.  There are hundreds of chairs, solid and smart, sheathed from head to toe in white velvet with a ribbon of black around their feet against the grass.  There’s an emblem in black on the back of each, and Harry recognises this as the Hogwarts crest.</p><p>Walking with his hands in his pockets, Harry takes the path to the castle’s main doors, freeing one hand to wave at Hagrid on the way.  He’s a distant figure, Hagrid, making his rounds of the paddocks and enclosures which soften the outer edge of the forest, not of Dean.  He waves at Harry when he sees him, his arm rising like a flag.</p><p>On the steps of Hogwarts Castle, Harry meets the other old Gryffindors on staff, Professors McGonagall and Longbottom, Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.  They’re caught in conversation on the castle’s threshold.  Both are wearing heavy robes in respect of the occasion, and Neville’s are in red and gold.  McGonagall’s hat is pinned with a thistle, her robes black wool with black embroidery.</p><p>“Morning,” says Neville, his face shadowed by the castle doors.  He looks relaxed in advance of this adventure, as usual.</p><p>“I trust that you’ve been practising your speech, Professor Potter,” greets McGonagall, steely.  She’s joking, Harry thinks.</p><p>“Still need to write it,” he tries, not meaning to let himself grin.</p><p>The headmistress makes a sound which isn’t quite a snort.  “Something coherent,” she recalls, sounding like she belongs here in Scotland, if this is where they are.  “Perhaps one or two tasteful jokes.  That’s all I asked.  That’s all I asked of you <em>both</em>,” she corrects, turning her gaze on the Hogwarts Professor of Herbology.</p><p>“Mine’s set to go,” Neville insists, looking betrayed.</p><p>“We are ambassadors for the school and this century’s bright future,” McGonagall goes on, somehow both sarcastic and earnest at the same time.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I’m going to go and read mine again,” Harry says, indicating past them, into the dark.  “Before we start.”</p><p>McGonagall doesn’t quite let him leave.  “Madam Granger and Mr Weasley will be arriving ahead?” she double-checks.</p><p>“They’ll be here,” Harry says.  They aren’t giving speeches, but they’ll be sitting at the front.  Unspeakable Hermione Granger and Auror Ronald Weasley, the invitations said, but McGonagall is rarely that formal.</p><p>“Is Malfoy coming?” Neville asks, and Harry nearly trips over his shoe.</p><p>Why?  Well, many things can happen in a week.  Professor Harry Potter is capable of achieving more of them than most.  He could likely locate Hogsmeade, if he bothered to put in the effort.  Unfortunately, losing all inhibition about the romantic entanglement he is currently pursuing with one Unspeakable Draco Malfoy is an entirely different beast from this, middle-aged ramble through the Forest of Dean or none.</p><p>“How should I know?” Harry demands from Neville on the threshold of Hogwarts, biting down on his back teeth.  They’ve been friends for a long time, which is why Harry knows that he can get away with this.</p><p>Neville looks confused, and Harry expects that this is because he intended the question to be innocuous.  Reading this and feeling daft, Harry realises that Neville must have already forgiven Malfoy for going off at him in Grimmo’s back garden, which he did only a few weeks ago.  Neville has a habit of doing this (“His bark’s worse than his bite, these days,” he always says in the end.).</p><p>“Doesn’t he live in your house?” Neville asks now, confused, in an accent which Harry never hears otherwise.</p><p>McGonagall is saying nothing, but her eyebrows have risen slightly, when Harry looks at her.  She was at the garden party too, if only briefly, to see Harry’s returned parents, Lily and James, and surely Remus Lupin.  It’s not clear that she realised Malfoy was there, and if she did she doesn’t seem to have joined any dots.</p><p>She’ll have an opinion, Harry thinks, and he’ll care about it, unlike most people’s.  He feels rather hot, even in the fresh morning air on the castle’s threshold.  He looks back to Neville, rubbing a thumb through one of his eyebrows.  “Yeah, er.  Yeah, he does,” he manages feebly, shoving his glasses up his face to mask whatever his expression is doing.  “But I didn’t ask.  He’s always said that he’ll never step foot back in Hogwarts.  Hogwarts or – well.”</p><p>Harry shuts up at this point, because he’s on the brink of revealing too much.  He’s sure that he doesn’t like the feeling.</p><p>“Every student in your year was sent an invitation,” says McGonagall neutrally, and this is the first word that Harry’s heard about it.  He has a feeling that <em>sent</em> rather than <em>received</em> is a clue.</p>
<hr/><p>They didn’t give up the flat, Harry and Draco, when they returned to number 12, Grimmauld Place from the Forest of Dean.  Instead, Harry moved in.</p><p>Regulus’s room has never felt like Harry’s, so to leave it was more like checking out of the Broomsticks than giving up a place he called home.  The room was redecorated along with the rest of house during the Great Renovation of 1999, only to end up an insipid yellow-pink colour which Harry’s never liked.  From the paint card alone he failed to recognise that the colour was the colour of Dudley Dursley’s second bedroom, almost exactly.  It turned out differently on the walls from the way that it looked in the tin, and it felt like poetic justice, the first night that Harry lay in bed on his own in the light.</p><p>Grimmo’s renovation began with Hermione’s realisation after NEWTs that (“Oh <em>Harry</em>,”) he had no intention of redecorating even after a year of living in the house.  It was a long time coming, this realisation, and Harry had been starting to think that he’d got away with doing nothing.  Hermione insisted that she wouldn’t take charge, but relented when Ron said that the only thing <em>he</em> cared about was the spiders (“You can’t <em>possibly</em> leave it like this!”).  Harry told Ron that he could manage that (“No!”); Kreacher kept quiet about the fact that Master Harry liked to watch the spiders sometimes, on the longer and darker, wetter afternoons.</p><p>The Great Renovation went on until 2001, by which time Harry had worn down Hermione into making all the decisions, thank Merlin.  The result was more homely than anything Harry could have conceived, he’s sure of it even now.</p><p>Luna painted new flowers in the parlour every time she came to visit, because she didn’t think much of Hermione’s powder blue (“<em>Well.</em>”).  Neville went through the garden and told them what was there (“So you’re saying that <em>all</em> of it’s weeds?”).  Harry ended up hating Regulus’s repainted room, missing the tangled undergrowth and anxious that Luna would grow tired of visiting long before she had a chance to finish her mural – but he set Grimmo’s wards because they mattered to him, and he succeeded in never letting on about the magnolia.  Eight years later, moving out, he calls that a job well done.</p><p>The afternoon when Harry and Draco came home from the Forest of Dean, after a stiff and formal lunch with the rest of the household, who were tiptoeing around things for no reason, Harry bundled his muggle clothes and his shoes into his school trunk, threw the few sets of robes he keeps at Grimmo over one arm and his backpack over his other shoulder.  He made ready for his journey and he departed.  He levitated the trunk downstairs, where someone had taken the flat’s front door off its hinges and away, leaving only the arch into the hall.</p><p>Draco’s sarky mirror remained just inside, cracked and bitter.  “Someone looks pleased with himself,” it said as Harry passed it, as though Harry was reaching above his station.</p><p>Draco’s flat will forever be Draco’s flat, Harry’s sure of it.  Honestly, the flat feels like it was Draco’s flat even before Draco moved in.</p><p>The rooms are ostentatiously large, more empty than full, painted a snowy shade of white which was supposed to be stone (“I thought that it would be a nice neutral, but it’s rather pale, isn’t it?”).  The furniture belongs to this snowscape, its wood pale ash, and Draco says that he hates it, but Harry doesn’t at all.</p><p>The kitchen table is Danish and designer, supposedly: it sits on spindly legs with its spindly chairs in the middle of the dark wooden floor, waiting, poised, alert as though it’s about to skitter away.  The sofa is much the same.  Draco’s bed has always been an oversized flood of North Sea, battleship grey, and it sits on a Persian rug which is incongruously huge and worn out, mostly dashes of straw-coloured warp threads.  The colours blend in with the bedroom floor; they make the boards appear warmer, like a retreat in the Zagros mountains, a place that Harry’s seen on a map.  He imagines that it’s worth several hundred thousands of galleons.</p><p>What Harry can’t imagine is the place of any of these things in Malfoy Manor, though the rug is sure to have been there on its travels, if only for a century or two.  He can imagine them in his own home even less.  The first thought is comforting.</p><p>“A trunk and a backpack,” Draco established as Harry entered the bedroom, watching and poised, his expression unreadable.  “Is this everything you own?” he asked derisively.</p><p>Back in Grimmo, they were both pretending that the crying had happened to some other couple, somewhere else.  That was healthy, Harry told himself at the time.  Or at least for the best.</p><p>For the moment, a week ago, Harry shrugged, moving to hang his robes in the half-empty run of wardrobes, dumping his bag inside with them.  There were empty drawers inside the wardrobes which Harry would fill eventually, he told himself; the flat had always been intended for two.  He let down his trunk by the armchair in the corner, where there sat a stuffed bear once transfigured from a hand towel.  The trunk went in snug under the window, and it looked less out of place than it might have done.</p><p>“The rest’s up at Hogwarts,” he told Draco over his shoulder.  Another wardrobe of robes and his books, anyway. “My toothbrush and stuff’s in the bathroom downstairs.”  He shut the wardrobe door.  “I’ll get it later.”</p><p>He watched Harry do all this, Draco, sharp eyes glinting while his mouth didn’t move.  He remained leaned against the wall by his side of the bed, a black spot set against a great square of grey, against white.  Always so casual, with one leg cocked; always so posed, his arms crossed behind his back.  He looked to Harry like part of an abstract painting, a circle or a line.</p><p>Draco’s eyes are pale grey, Harry’s known for a long time.  An even stormier grey than the bed, he’s likes to think these days – faceted like marble or flint.  He’s lovely in a fragile way, Harry happened to think at this moment, like the sharp glance of light on a cloud.  It was sad, how much he always tried to hide it.</p><p>“You could have moved in years ago,” Draco remarked without clear intonation, dangerous like ice.</p><p>“We both know I practically did,” Harry told him for the joke of it, drawn.</p><p>Predatory, Draco revealed his teeth at this moment and they fell back into bed, Harry moving to meet him up against the wall and shutting the door with the flick of his wand.</p><p>In his Hogwarts office, which once belonged to Professor Lupin, among others, Harry is met by a dragon of a different kind: bright purple and eager and winsome, squeaking at him with what feels like familiarity and pelting him with soft rainbow-coloured balls of fluff.</p><p>“I know, I know, you weren’t expecting me,” Harry tells Puff, shutting the door behind him with a flick of his wand.  It makes the wards slot into place; they’re more gentle reminders than threats, here in the castle.  As for Puff’s assault, Harry lets the pompoms fall where they will, because they’ll all soon vanish into nothing.</p><p>Puff the stuffed dragon wings eagerly around his head, ending up on the bookcase where he tends to perch like a gargoyle.  He isn’t sentient, Harry doesn’t believe, and George seems terrified by the idea whenever Harry brings it up (“No, Harry, I have <em>not</em> created life; I’d better not hear you telling Mysteries otherwise.”).  Yet it feels as though the dragon is real, a lot of the time.  Puff has his moods: he’s cheery nearly always, but he’s grumpy if he hasn’t been fed and he’s strangely shy, on occasion.  He eats sugar cubes to sustain the charms which form his existence, once or twice or a few times a day, which is mad but horrendously endearing.</p><p>The castle elves find Puff nothing but a bother, they say, but they’ve allotted him his own special sugar bowl, silver engraved with a joke Latin motto on the side.  It’s based on the school’s.  Harry doesn’t know what it means, but he lets them chortle among themselves.</p><p>He’s spoiled, really, Puff, which is why he never controls himself with the pompoms.  But it’s difficult to believe that this matters: there’s a flutter of good feeling in Harry’s chest, brought on by his grin at Puff’s greeting.</p><p>The feeling fades quickly as Harry puts down his wand on the desk, not lifting his hand, and as he contemplates the fireplace.  His speech is sitting waiting for him, rolled up and ready.  It’ll be fine, Harry’s certain.  He wrote it nearly a month ago and it only needs to read.  The wizarding world made their bed with him years back.  He could say whatever he liked.</p><p>There’s Hermione’s voice in his head, telling him to check it over (“There’s no need to <em>force</em> yourself into winging it, Harry,”), but the fireplace seems more pressing.  It’s an important day, and Harry…</p><p>Torn, Harry eventually takes up his wand, moves to the hearth and pinches some powder from the small copper pot on top of the mantelpiece.  He casts a fire and turns it green, kneeling down on the cool, hard flagstones.  “<em>Malfoy’s flat,</em>” he says clearly.  “<em>Third floor, number 12, Grimmauld Place.</em>”  He takes hold of the grate, its sharp sooty points, and thrusts his head into the flames.</p><p>The room is familiar, but empty.  Quiet.  From his angle in the fire, Harry can see the blue sofa across from him, the white-stone-snow walls.  The bookcase which houses everything that Malfoy doesn’t use at work, oddly adolescent in its contents.</p><p>Flames that don’t burn flick around Harry’s ears, but even so, he doesn’t think that there’s anything to make out.</p><p>“Kreacher,” Harry tries, wondering where everyone is.</p><p>With a <em>crack</em>, in an instant, Kreacher is there.  “Master Harry’s head called for Kreacher,” he croaks, because he thinks that he’s funny.</p><p>His eyes are as insolent as Malfoy’s typically are, and more difficult for Harry to read, these days.  They’re large and opal-translucent in colour, looking down on Harry, for once, at this angle, and that seems about right.  His little hands are clasped in front of his black pillowcase toga, his locket secure around his neck.</p><p>“Is Mr Malfoy here, Kreacher?” Harry asks, trying not to imagine another time and this very fireplace, the way that he always does.</p><p>“He has left shortly after Master Harry, Master Harry,” Kreacher tells him, congenial.  It seems inevitable that one day Kreacher will lie to him again, and he could be lying now.</p><p>Harry makes sure to hear Hermione’s words in his head (“He’s only the product of his influences, Harry.”).  But even so, he feels a lick of frustration.  Mr Malfoy’s supposed to be <em>dozing</em>.</p><p>“D’you know where he’s gone?” he asks Kreacher shortly.  Please, he thinks, let it not be the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>“Mr Malfoy did not inform Kreacher of his business,” Kreacher croaks, sounding sincerely disappointed and familiar.</p><p>“Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry tells him, waiting for the elf’s nod before he draws his head back into the office.  “Thanks for nothing,” he mutters when he’s alone, because it’s a burn in his chest, his own lack of trust.</p><p>There’s another option, Harry supposes, but he knows that the floo won’t be able to help him with it.  Mr Ollivander and Luna are coming today, and they won’t be taking seats at the front.  They won’t be flooing up, and they certainly won’t be apparating, because Ollivander can’t risk anything like that, not even a portkey, not for years now.  The Cruciatus won’t let him suffer it.</p><p>The school paid to run the Express yesterday for everyone in a similar position, so Ollivander and likely Luna with him will already be up here in Hogsmeade – but there are a number of places to stay, in and around town.  They’re all open for the season.  They’re all unplottable too.</p><p>Harry contemplates the wand in his hand, holly with a phoenix-feather core, eleven inches.</p><p>The spell he wants to use has betrayed him.  He hasn’t used it in two months because of that.  He hasn’t used it in <em>years</em> because of that.  He doesn’t want to use it now.</p><p>And yet – there are so many things to think of.  He can feel the words on his tongue and the motion in his hand and he knows that to cast the charm will be easy.  There’s a moment in the forest, when he was told that he was loved (“Darling, I adore –”).  There’s a man lying wide-eyed in a hospital bed, loud and effusive; a woman hugging him close and correcting him with sharp-tongued kindness; another man taking his hands –</p><p>But there’s also the harbinger of these things, something stilted and ridiculous (“You must be…  You must be <em>Harry</em>.”).  An arrogant cockerel of a man, lurching at him, his eyes wide and guileless, everything he’s ever lived surely clean and simple and easy.</p><p>This spell always belonged to that man.</p><p>It doesn’t anymore.</p><p>Thinking of a handshake, Harry steps back and flicks his wand.  He expects his office in two seconds to be full of a shining magic-white stag, ducking its antlers away from the ceiling and making Puff squeak, rear up and, yes, very likely breathe out another stream of pompoms.</p><p>At some point or other, in the last ten years, the stag has left Harry to fend for himself.  He’s grown up, maybe; he’s moved on.</p><p>The stag’s replacement is a wolf.</p><p>A <em>wolf</em>, Harry sees, disappointed.</p><p>Thick-coated and solid, sober in its expression, wild and predatory: the white wolf has escaped Harry’s wand to land on the flagstones with menace, and it makes Puff whip clumsily away to his perch.</p><p>Harry shuts his eyes and breathes.  Looking at the wolf causes him a sharp stab of panic, he knows from long experience.  It doesn’t make sense; it never has done.  He’s not in love with Lupin, he’s sure of it, and he certainly didn’t fall in love with him while he was dead and Harry was doing his best to help raise his son.</p><p>It’s not Malfoy.  Harry can’t believe it, not from the way that the patronus makes him feel.  It’s certainly not Ginny.  Harry doesn’t want it to be himself, so he tries not to let himself think it.  Lupin’s at least a friendly face, which takes him back to the beginning again.</p><p>Harry thought that the wolf could be Teddy, the first time this happened, but that’s never made sense either.  The wolf is fully grown and Teddy is a child, lupine undoubtedly but also a Tonks, maybe even a touch of a Potter, a Malfoy.  The name which connects all of these things.</p><p>Stalking by Harry’s desk and circling, the wolf is keeping low to the office’s flagstones, never holding its head high.  It would be willing to send a message, Harry thinks – to check with Luna that Malfoy’s with her and Ollivander and that he’ll be safe, here in this castle.  Protected.  At least on this day.</p><p>But Harry can’t bear to let the wolf speak with his voice.  Not this <em>thing</em>.  It’s not ugly by any means; it’s just not –</p><p>Breathing firmly, Harry ignores the predator prowling with an eye to the door, sitting down at his desk and pulling his speech towards him, forcing himself to untie the ribbon.  He concentrates on the fibres of the parchment, the shade of the ink and the shape of the letters, ignoring the wolf until it goes away.</p>
<hr/><p>It didn’t feel odd to sleep with Draco, the night after the Forest of Dean.  Not after another stiff meal and a few stiffer drinks – a confab with Ron and Hermione.  Draco deigned to sit on the arm of the Chesterfield sofa, the humming, urgent nerves of him not far from Harry’s shoulder, and it was a question to which Harry had the answer.</p><p>The next morning, Harry woke up to a sharp set of knocks on the door, and this felt very odd indeed.</p><p>Beside him, Draco shot immediately upright, alert, his back straight and his eyes wide with unseeing fear.</p><p>“It’s all right,” Harry told him instinctively, taking hold of his wrist.  He felt certain that the bones would break, still half asleep, so he moved to take hold of Draco’s thumb instead.</p><p>Beside him, Draco let out a shuddering breath, and Harry was sure that it would pull him apart.</p><p>“Who’s that?” Harry shouted at the door, tightening his grip.</p><p><em>“Take a guess,”</em> came Sirius’s voice dryly, and Harry blinked to remember that he wasn’t dreaming and the man wasn’t dead, or something like that.  He’d been found somewhere and in time.</p><p>Right then, he was knocking on the door.  Again.  <em>Sirius.</em></p><p><em>“Bloody hell; it’s me,”</em> he was insisting, impatient, absurd.  <em>“Get up; we’re going out.  Honeymoon’s over.”</em></p><p>This made Harry flush.</p><p><em>Honeymoon?</em> Draco mouthed, making a face.  His eyes were wild and wide, for a few moments more.</p><p>Shrugging, not commenting on this, Harry turned back to face the door, his grip returning to Draco’s fragile wrist.  “Hardly a honeymoon if we’re home, is it?” he told his godfather, not intending to make this his argument.  “We’re asleep,” he tried to cover, quickly, though he rather liked the idea…  “Go away,” he finally located.</p><p><em>“You’re taking me to breakfast,”</em> said Sirius.</p><p>Draco looked at Harry as if to say that this was his fault, no question.  He, Draco Malfoy Esquire, would be taking <em>no one</em> to breakfast, and if <em>anyone</em> came through the bedroom door there would be all hell to pay, from Harry’s flesh.</p><p>He was almost looking like himself again, woken up, though Harry imagined that he would feel like cold sweat if he clambered on top of him, for fun.</p><p>“You’re the one who brought him back,” Harry pointed out instead, to wind him up.</p><p>“He brought himself back,” Draco snapped, the flash of his eyes sharp and dark.</p><p>It made Harry grin.</p><p>The room was a soft and sleepy grey around them, the light outside almost entirely cut by the curtains.  Harry had no idea what time it was, but snapping plainly settled Draco into his skin, which made it the morning.  He revealed himself to be nothing but exhausted and grumpy, out of focus in his rumpled black t-shirt and his fluffy, streaky hair, his skin clean and pale with sleep.  To Harry, he looked like nothing but pure chaos.  Feeling.  Energy, instinct, light.  Fear and the night made him hide it all away; it made him freeze; it made him say horrible things.  It was nice, this fearless version of him.</p><p>Another knock.  Ruddy hell, Harry thought.</p><p>“Yeah; all right!” he found himself yelling, because he’d been enjoying the romance of his thoughts.  “Merlin,” he added, loud enough to be heard.</p><p>With the sound of something like a snort, finally, there was Sirius stomping away in his boots.  <em>“Half an hour!”</em> he shouted as goodbye.</p><p>Harry snorted because it was ridiculous.</p><p>"He is a fucking dog,” Draco swore, looking like something ethereal.</p><p>“Whereas <em>you</em>,” Harry told him, bouncing on the mattress to swing over Draco’s knees – because, well, it takes Harry ten minutes to get ready at most, and he doesn’t much care about sweat.  “What are you?” he asked, looking into the facets of Draco’s eyes.</p><p>They were speculative and cold.  “What would you like me to be?” Draco asked, sounding like a dream.</p><p>It made Harry grin, and he snogged him sniggering for twenty-three minutes exactly, he guessed, one hand taking a tight grip on the headboard, the other Draco’s spine and his neck and his feathery hair.</p>
<hr/><p>At half past nine in the morning, on Sunday the fourth of May, an hour before the memorial service is to begin, Harry’s thoughts are interrupted by a leaping silver hare, pouncing to his desk.</p><p><em> “Hello Harry,”</em> says the hare in Luna’s voice.  It twitches its nose.  <em>“Draco would like you to know that he’s attending the memorial today.  He doesn’t know where his invitation went, so he’s coming as Mr Ollivander’s guest.  We might not see you,”</em>  Luna carries on easily, warning him.  <em>“I imagine that this is going to be an important day for many people, because they’ll have a chance to shake your hand.”</em></p><p>Message delivered, the hare leaps away.</p><p>Once upon a time, Luna helped Harry disappear.  They’ve both grown up long since, or something like that.</p><p>He can still see Luna’s face when he caught her and Liz in the kitchen at one of Ginny’s parties.  It must have been in the early days of their relationship – 2000, 2001, 2002.  Startled, like a rabbit looking at a wolf, Luna was sitting on the sideboard, flushed like a sexual being, out of character, her hair full of volume, her lips muddied pink.</p><p>Liz laughed and offered him a beer.  They’d been talking earlier in the evening, likely because she’s always been Harry’s type, if it can be said that he has one: sporty and pretty and outspoken.  Not at all interested in him, which made her rare and exciting after the war.</p><p>In the Harpy House’s kitchen, whenever it was, Harry took the beer and left with what he hopes to have been a jaunty wave.  It’s the longest exchange he and Luna have ever had about his sexuality.</p><p>In Harry’s office, now, his speech is lying under his hands, unrolled on the desk, and none of the words are going in.  It’s ten minutes long, by Harry’s estimation, and there’s half an hour before he’s due to head outside.  That’s more than enough time to practise once through and reflect.</p><p>He spends fifteen minutes idly contemplating what he and Neville might do with the duelling club, for the two final sessions before end-of-year exams.  And then he heads outside early, the rolled up scroll in his hand.</p><p>“Wish me luck,” he tells Puff, who wheezes at him, his eyes round glass.</p>
<hr/><p>In the hour or so that has passed since Harry’s arrival, a crowd has gathered on the lawn in front of the lake.  There are representatives from the press, whom Harry avoids.  There’s Flitwick, still going strong, and Sprout, now retired, chatting away with the odd, quiet man who teaches Potions, Peleus Thompson, who isn’t head of Slytherin because once upon a time he was in Hufflepuff.  He looks after the badgers instead, and under his watch the dungeons forever smell like misty autumn mornings, bonfire smoke and damp leaves.</p><p>There’s Neville too, again, over by the platform which the elves have constructed, black and white to match the chairs, feature and field reversed.  He’s chatting easily with Ron and Hermione and Ginny, her fiancé Matías, Harry guesses, who doesn’t look at all out of place.  Matías is surely going to be more than nice enough, though this is the first time Harry’s met him.  He has dark features, and Harry supposes that it could even be flattering, that this is what Ginny likes.  He’s handsome: taller than Harry by a couple of inches and broader, his face nonetheless more precise-looking, the shadow of a beard around his jaw.  He’s laughing at something Ginny’s saying, like they all are.  His laugh is a loud and easy sound, uncompromised, much more like that of a stag than a wolf.</p><p>The five of them make a group which Harry’s clearly supposed to join, so he does.</p><p>“Harry!” they all say, in various tones of voice.</p><p>“Oh, hey there,” says Matías, holding out his hand.  “Great to meet you.”  His expression says that this isn’t a lie.  To Harry his accent is slick and American.  “Matías Núñez; I’ve heard so much about you.”</p><p>“Likewise,” Harry agrees, shaking his hand.  He doesn’t bother to offer his own name, because everyone’s just said it and to repeat it would sound egotistical.  “Congratulations on the league,” he adds, sounding awkward and British.  The Falmouth Falcons won this year, he’s heard somewhere, and Ginny’s fiancé plays for the team.</p><p>“Ugh,” says Ginny nonetheless, making a face and sticking out her tongue, because Puds U were robbed, everyone’s said.  She’s buzzing with energy, here under the bright blue sky; her expressions always make Harry grin.  “No quidditch chat,” she insists.</p><p>“You’d be saying that if things were reversed, eh, Gin?” Ron jokes.  Hermione nudges him in the side, not saying anything.</p><p>“Mm,” replies Ginny, refusing to swallow the bait.  She turns to Harry, her ponytail swinging behind her.  The morning sun makes her red hair gleam gold, a match for Neville’s robes.  Her own are yellow and magenta-acid pink, as though Godric’s off to a rave.  “I’ve been saying that we should all ditch for George’s.  Nev agrees –”</p><p>“That’s not <em>quite</em> what I said…”</p><p>“This is going to be boring as <em>fark</em>,” Ginny finishes, drawing out the sound like a wizard from the Wizengamot.  “Have you two even come up with anything good?”</p><p>Harry can feel the fat roll of parchment in his hand.  He taps it against his leg, to remember where he is.  Ginny’s nervous, he thinks; he can see it in the way that she moves.  She’s never worked in an office; she’s never taught schoolkids; she’s never had to learn to contain it.</p><p>“What’s George’s?” Harry asks, looking to Ron.</p><p>“He didn’t feel like all this,” Ron says straightforwardly.</p><p>He’s holding Hermione’s hand, Harry notices, the gesture half hidden between them.  Hermione looks rather drawn and serious, to Harry’s eyes, as though she doesn’t want to speak until the whole thing’s over, no matter that she has no official speaking to do at all.  Her brown eyes meet Harry’s, and they’re very loud.</p><p>An awkward smile crosses Ron’s face like an apology, and Harry knows that he’s seen him see.  “He thought that it’d be, you know, too serious.  Nothing but optics,” Ron says about George, using a word that Harry doesn’t know.  He can guess what it means.  “He knew that <em>we’d</em> have to be here,” he continues, gesturing to the group of them, sort of including Matías as well, “but he and Angelina thought that they’d put on a bash at the shop.  Your mum and dad have gone,” he adds, making Harry startle and blink, parchment rough in his hand.</p><p>“Harry’s mum and dad have come back from the dead,” Ginny tells Matías, pressing an arm and a hand to his chest, looking up.  “It’s a secret for now.  Don’t tell anyone.”  She wags a finger at him, joking.  “I want to meet them,” she tells Harry, while Matías glowers with mock-solemnity, surely used to keeping his private life private.  “George says they’re fun.”</p><p>Neville speaks before Harry can pick up on this, his voice deep and good-humoured and not in fact taking the piss.  “They’re both just like Harry,” he says.  “His dad’s a right laugh.”</p><p>Harry stares at him.  “You what?” he manages now.</p><p>There’s the sound of Ron’s cackle, out of place where they are.  “You’ve put your foot in it there, mate,” he says.</p><p>“Oh,” reflects Neville, not looking repentant.  Cheeky git.  “Sorry, Haz.”</p><p>“Don’t call me <em>Haz</em>,” Harry tells him, and Ginny practically screams with laughter, because they’ve both been running this gag for years.  The name’s something that two Hufflepuffs once called him.  There’s a gleam in Neville’s eyes, because he always lights up around Ginny.  He’s never said anything about it and Harry’s never asked; the others don’t often see him without her.</p><p>“<em>It’s Hazza Jazza Potter, king of the club,</em>” Ginny recites, thankfully under her breath.  Her brown eyes meet his, daring.</p><p>“Really?” Harry asks her, containing himself.  “Do we have to?”</p><p>“<em>He’ll either break your face, or he’ll give you a snog,</em>” the rhyme goes on.  Ginny’s bopping a little to the beat, her tone lilting into the tune.  “<em>Which one? This one – that’s who he is.</em>”  There are gestures, which make Matías titter, in a manly way.  “<em>Best hope he leads with his mouth, or else he’ll lead with his –</em>”</p><p>“Give it a rest,” Ron interrupts, suddenly looking annoyed.  Harry isn’t sure what his own face is doing.  It feels as though it’s burning bright red.  “That thing wasn’t funny ten years ago, and it’s not funny now.”</p><p>“On the contrary, my dear brother,” says Ginny, crossing her arms and making her fiery hair swing in an arc.  “It’s always been funny, because it was once very true.”</p><p>“I think it’s a good tune,” says Neville, perfectly affable.</p><p>“<em>Harry</em> knows I’m joking,” Ginny tells Ron, and she smacks an absent kiss to her fingers to blow at Harry’s face.</p><p>“Did you find out if Malfoy’s coming?” Neville asks Harry, as though to change the subject.</p><p>Harry opens his mouth to –</p><p>“Malfoy’s this loser who lives in their house,” Ginny tells Matías, and it’s all nerves.  She’s nervous.  She has a habit of being loud when she’s nervous, likely because she was once very shy.  And yet – “You’ll meet him at some point.  He was on the other side; these days he’s like a bad omen.  Miserable.”</p><p>Harry has the urge to snap.  He doesn’t know what he’s more annoyed about: the way that Ginny’s talking about Malfoy or the daft way that she’s narrating their conversation for her fiancé, who’s surely capable of picking up these things on his own.  That stupid bloody song that won’t die.</p><p>He bites down on his teeth, and they’re all of them silent.</p><p>“That’s unfair, Ginny,” Hermione comes out with, her voice weak, but startling.  “Malfoy’s our friend.”  She elbows Harry in the side.</p><p>Elbowed, Harry’s not sure what Hermione expects of him.  “What?”</p><p>She meets his eyes, and her own are louder than before, pointedly widened.</p><p>Ginny’s looking at Harry too.  Her eyes are sharp.  “Sorry, Hermione,” she’s saying dangerously.  “But he’s no friend of mine.”</p><p>“He helps out Auntie Dromeda with Teddy,” Harry tells her, because this is how he’s been explaining Malfoy’s presence for years.  It’s the sort of thing he thinks might persuade her.  In the least, it’s something that she can’t have an answer to.  “Teddy thinks that he’s amazing.”</p><p>Hermione sighs.  Harry doesn’t look at her.</p><p>“It’s true, Gin,” Neville points out.  “I’ve heard it now from the horse’s mouth.”</p><p>He’s glancing at Harry, Neville, nervousness in his expression.  Harry imagines that he’s thinking about the time when Harry shoved him backwards over a wall – years ago – for reasons that Harry doesn’t remember.  Neville was telling him to do something like calm down.  The wall was only two feet high and he landed on soft grass; he’s taller and larger than Harry and only fell because they’d been out all night drinking – but still.</p><p>Just like that night, as though she never intends to forget it, Ginny doesn’t give Harry a warning.  She asks Neville sweetly, “Was this before or after Malfoy threw a table at you?”</p><p>“It was only a chair,” Neville allows, looking towards Dumbledore’s white tomb, “and he didn’t really throw it…  I was being insensitive.”</p><p>He was being too insightful, and that’s always been Neville’s problem.</p><p>“What were you being insensitive about?” Ginny asks, with a strong streak of chivalry.  She already knows, Harry’s certain, and it fills him with dread.</p><p>It’s not that he doesn’t <em>want</em> to come out about Malfoy, whatever that would mean.  This just – isn’t the right moment.  It’s an important day.</p><p>Neville’s looking at Ginny until he isn’t, when he’s looking at Harry. He looks torn between them.  He looks like he belongs here, wearing red and gold under the bright blue sky, no matter the expression on his face.</p><p>“This must be painfully boring for you,” Ron interrupts laconically, leaning towards Matías.  The man laughs as if to say <em>yes</em>, or else that he has no idea what’s going on.</p><p>And then they’re all laughing – a bit – because <em>ha ha</em>, this is funny.</p><p>“You’ll have to make up your own mind on Malfoy,” Ron explains when they’ve calmed down, even as Harry finds himself rolling his eyes.  “He can be difficult, yeah?  But us three all like him.  Have done for years now.”</p><p>Neville chips in, “I don’t mind him, most of the time.”</p><p>“We’re all different people, aren’t we?” Ron agrees.</p><p>Harry thinks about the wolf.</p><p>Then he realises abruptly that he hasn’t said <em>anything</em> about his own thoughts on Malfoy, and Ginny’s fiancé might think –  “Yeah,” he just about manages, when Matías glances at him, feeling panicked.  “He’s – different.”  He’s not different at all.  “He’s all right.”  He’s the best thing Harry’s ever encountered, and it took fifteen years to take it in.  “He’s coming with Luna,” Harry remembers to tell Neville, who nods, clearly chastened.</p><p>Ginny makes a noise of frustration.</p><p>In a second which Harry hopes that no one will notice, he glances at Ron.  Ron looks concerned – unimpressed.  He clearly promises to watch out for any negative attention from elsewhere, later, given that Harry will likely be occupied.</p><p>Bouncing on her toes, here on the Hogwarts lawn, Ginny looks like she wants to climb out of her skin.  “What are we having at this reception?” she finds another avenue of attack.  “Is it sandwiches?” she demands from Harry, as though it’ll be his fault if it is.</p><p>She can be gentle, Ginny, Harry knows, and she can be abrasive, the way she’s being now.  He has the urge to tell her to wind her neck in.  He finds it charming, knowing where he stands.  He has the urge –</p><p>“I dunno,” he promises instead, forcing himself to let it go.</p>
<hr/><p>“What’s this about?” Harry asked, when he and Sirius found themselves in one of the local muggle coffee shops, a week before the second of May.  It was a busy Friday morning in central London, the colours of the place an un-homely corporate blue and the feel of it all printed type.</p><p>There are coffee shops like this – <em>exactly</em> like this – up and down the country.  They’re muggle; we know what they look like, whether blue or green or red or brown.  Harry’s been to plenty of them, every one of them anonymous.  They’re a necessary evil, he thinks, for the life that he lives.  But he knows that he doesn’t belong, and it always puts him off.</p><p>Sirius seemed in his element, that day.  He’d a cappuccino and an espresso in front of him, a muffin and a freshly toasted panini (“<em>Panino,</em>” Harry has heard Draco say, and Hermione agree, though he can never remember why; he’s not sure what’s correct.).  There were meatballs inside of this sandwich, and Sirius bit into the thing with glee, cheese stringing into the stubble he hadn’t shaved before he ate it up, not really like a dog.</p><p>“Is that all you’re having?” he asked, not answering Harry’s question, looking down at the expensive cup of tea which Harry had ordered for something familiar.  “You should try one of these,” he encouraged, nodding his head towards his tiny espresso cup and then shooting it in one swallow.</p><p>“I know what an espresso is,” Harry pointed out.  “I don’t like the taste of coffee.”</p><p>Sirius made a face, his dark grey eyes alight as he grinned around his eyeteeth.  “Hark at you,” he said, sounding exactly like Harry’s mother.  “In my day it was cool to drink stuff like this.”  He was taking up his cappuccino by this point.  “Mm,” he said appreciatively, his nostrils flared as he breathed in the smell of the froth.</p><p>“I’m not very cool,” Harry pointed out.  He never has been; he never will be.  “And what are you talking about?” he asked.  “Everyone was going to coffee shops in the nineties.”</p><p>“I must have missed that,” said Sirius darkly.  To be fair, Harry was only going by what he’d heard.  “I’m talking about 1979,” Sirius clarified.</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said.</p><p>For some reason, this made Sirius laugh.  Harry wasn’t sure that he remembered it, whatever manic energy had caught hold of his godfather this morning.  It caused him a spike of anxiety.  The man tipped back on his chair legs, because he could, Harry imagined, and Harry thought that it was a good thing he looked thirty, because he certainly wasn’t acting fifty years old.</p><p>Taking another bite of his sandwich, Sirius returned the chair to solid ground, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t know where to start,” he admitted, munching.</p><p>“Start on what?” Harry asked, drinking a mouthful of tea, which had been served a touch too cold.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes.  “Did we or did we not only yesterday have a big, blow-up row?”  He pointed this out as though it was something to acknowledge.  “About –”  He wasn’t able to say it.</p><p>Harry shrugged, watching Sirius’s gaze fall to the right.  He’d had ten years to come to terms with the fact of his death.  “So what?  We had a row; the row ended; it’s done.”</p><p>“You are worse than your father,” Sirius said under his breath, which put Harry’s back up because he wasn't his father, he was a wolf.</p><p>“How’s that?” he asked shortly.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Sirius didn’t reply.  He moved on quickly.  “I’m not sitting through a single meal more where we do nothing but smile at each other and request the decanter.”  He seemed to think that he was clearing the air.  “If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine.  There’s no need to freeze us out.”  And then he came out with something from nowhere.  “Did you really accuse Remus once upon a time of trying to <em>step into my shoes</em> by acting like he cared about you?”</p><p>“What?” Harry asked him, off-balance.  He didn’t remember saying anything like this.</p><p>Peering at him, Sirius frowned, unreadable.  Then he looked away.   “Doesn’t matter,” he lied airily.  “I’ve been catching up,” he went on, glancing at the table next to theirs before looking down at their own and deciding on another bite of his sandwich.  “Can’t say that I expected you to start appreciating the, ah, rougher of the sexes,” he found his next point, awfully, munching as though he hadn’t eaten properly in weeks.  “Not bad, is it, the male form?”  He offered this with a wicked quirk of his eyebrows, half swallowing his words.</p><p>At the look on Harry’s face, he hooted, covering his mouth with his fist.</p><p>“Our secrets are no more, Harry,” he said after swallowing, mock-earnestly.  “We’re going to have to embrace it.”</p><p>Yeah, Harry thought.  And some of them would be embracing Harry’s former Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (“Does it bother you?”).</p><p>Despite himself, and despite the fact that this was <em>Sirius</em>, back from the dead, Harry felt anger bubble up in his chest.  “Why don’t you mind your own business?” he suggested before he could help himself.  They’d been putting him back into bad habits, these so-called parents.</p><p>It didn’t help that Harry’s tone seemed to be water off a duck’s back.  “You’ve been with that Malfoy for, what, five years now?” Sirius accused.  “Don’t you think that it’s about time –”</p><p>“Where the hell d’you get five years from?” Harry demanded, because he didn’t count it as anything like that at all.</p><p>Even being shouted at, Sirius looked pleased with himself.  “I have my ways,” he said with an irritating aura of mystery.</p><p>“Well, <em>no</em>,” Harry told him, putting down his cup and wiping his hand on his jeans because he’d successfully spilled his tea.  His eyes followed the waiter, passing by their table with two more white plates bearing cheesy sandwiches, waiting until he’d moved away.  He thought about calm things, forests and streams.  Exercise.  “It was <em>four</em> years ago that I saw him again –”</p><p>This got a laugh.  A proper one this time, a bark which came with a grin.</p><p>“We were never together,” Harry said bluntly, staring Sirius down.  “Except for a week, when I snogged someone else.  You can fill in the blanks, I’m sure.”  He said this snidely, daring Sirius to judge him.  He didn’t know why he was being so honest.  “I don’t do relationships.”  This is how he’s always put it.</p><p>“What’s the move downstairs, then?” Sirius asked lightly, as though he was confused, not put off at all, which was bizarre.</p><p>“It’s…”  Harry shrugged, thinking of walking barely clothed by a stream and pointing out a frog, like a loser.  He didn’t feel calm; it wasn’t working.  “It’s a change in circumstance,” he came up with.</p><p>Watching Harry carefully, Sirius appeared to make a decision, there in the coffee shop.  He sighed, not reacting at all the way that he should have done.  “You poor child,” he said, his gaze piercing.  He picked up his muffin and set it down by Harry’s cup of tea.  “Eat this and stop worrying so much,” he commanded, as though Harry was breaking his heart.  His eyes were full of sympathy.  “It’s going to be fine.”</p><p>Ants crawled in Harry’s stomach.  They multiplied, into two and into four and into eight.  It had always been the same with Sirius: this feeling of something that Harry had never had; this feeling of something parental.  It was nothing that he’d ever felt with Lupin, he was sure of it, and his dad…  His mum never called him by his name.</p><p>A sting that was sharp cut into Harry’s eyes, there with Sirius, and there were things that he found himself wanting to say.  He fought them back, but he wasn’t sure why, in that moment.</p><p>“We’ll talk about something else.”  This statement was solid and warm, and Sirius’s eyes were dark grey.  “What is it you’re doing for fun in the two-thousands?”</p><p>“Nothing, really,” Harry said, looking at the muffin on the table, reaching to press his fingers to the paper.  Shagging Malfoy was most of the answer, though there’d been a fourteen-month lull on that until yesterday.</p><p>“<em>Harry,</em>” said Sirius wearily, seizing hold of his wrist.</p><p>It took Harry by surprise.  He looked up and there was a flash from somewhere, maybe outside the shop, a warning signal, maybe something else.</p><p>At Hogwarts, as Harry steps up to the platform in front of Dumbledore’s tomb, there are several more bright flashes of light, and Harry knows exactly what they are.  There are more than there were for Neville, maybe, though this is likely only Harry’s perspective, the feeling of being under scrutiny.  Knowing what they all want to see.</p><p>He doesn’t know why McGonagall insisted on him going at the end.  His won’t be the last words of the morning, because those will be the headmistress’s, thanking everyone for coming and inviting them into the castle – but it’s made him feel separate from everyone’s grief, sitting and waiting.  He’s not been able to empathise or really remember, because the fact is that he never fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.  He was busy flying Malfoy out of the fire, all the rest of it.</p><p>Neville went at the start, before Dennis Creevey and the other siblings shared their few words (“This memorial will be for the young,” McGonagall said, in a planning meeting months ago.  “Hogwarts is a school.”).  Ginny’s spoken for Fred, and Harry knows he should have realised that this is the reason she’s here, instead of on tour or skipping the day to be with George.  Percy and Audrey and Molly and Arthur are somewhere in the crowd, to listen.</p><p>She cried, Ginny, the tears streaking down her face.  Her voice broke at the end of the poem she was reading, and she sobbed harshly into her hand.  On Monday there’ll be pictures of her sorrow, Harry imagines, across quidditch sections and tabloids throughout Europe, at least, and maybe throughout the whole world.</p><p>Behind the lectern on the wooden boards of the wooden stage, valanced black, Harry points his holly wand at his throat and says the spell.  “<em>Sonorus</em>.”  He clears his throat, which now itches.  “Today we find ourselves in front of the tomb of Albus Dumbledore,” he begins, his eyes dry as he looks down at his own handwriting.  “I like to think that he’ll be watching over us, even now.  He must be one of Hogwarts’ most lauded headmasters.”  Harry reads on, moving into eulogy, “Sorted into Gryffindor in 1892, he took up the position of Professor of Transfiguration after cutting his teeth on Defence against the Dark Arts, my own subject…”</p><p>This takes a few minutes.  There’s plenty to cover, so Harry moves briskly without too many dates.  This is also because he didn’t bother to check any of the details.  Glancing up and ad-libbing some of the sentences, cameras flash at him.  They flash and they flash and they flash.  Harry reads.</p><p>“But there is another Hogwarts headmaster about whom I would like to speak today.”  Harry pauses, and faces look at him over their cameras.  “His name was Severus Snape.”  A few murmurs.  “He was born in Cokeworth, near Birmingham, to a man named Tobias and his mother, born Eileen Prince, in the year of 1960.  In 1971, he came to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin…”</p><p>This goes on for a little while too, though Harry raises his head more often, as though to dare an interruption.  Everyone listens politely.  The silence is quiet enough that Harry can hear the scratching of journalists working their quills – he can see them working, there at the side.  They weren’t as bothered for Dumbledore, who’s old news.</p><p>“Our relationship was defined by all the times I answered back…”</p><p>He gets the timing right.  Everyone laughs with a soft little chortle.  Harry looks up, forcing a grin, and there are flashes of light to catch him being insincere.</p><p>Eventually Harry rounds to a conclusion: “These two headmasters of Hogwarts taught me that bravery comes in many forms, and it is not the exclusive purview of Gryffindor House.  The war was always intended to divide us, not least into Gryffindor on one side and Slytherin on the other, Ravenclaw in the middle and Hufflepuff burying the dead – these houses telling us our duties, rather than acting as homes.  But our allegiances are not fixed at the age of eleven.  The roles we play as children do not define us, in the same way that war never will.</p><p>“Let us look to the next ten years with hope and with unity,” he finishes, sounding like the Sorting Hat, by intention, another old scion of Gryffindor who’s neutral these days.  “These things are the essence of peace.  They arise in times of peace and they create it; let them be ours.”</p><p>And here he stops talking.  He breaks the spell on his throat and steps down from the platform, its black-and-white velvet covering.  Applause trickles and swells to thunder in his ears and instinct brings him back to his seat, where Hermione springs up and pulls him into a hug.  He pulls her close and hides in her hair while Ron pats him roughly on the back.</p><p>“Oh Harry,” Hermione chides as McGonagall takes to the platform.  She’s crying, Hermione; her eyes are red.  One of her hands is resting on Ron’s arm.  “I’ve never heard such a load of old cobblers.”</p><p>“Since when are you a fan of Snape?” Ron asks him from the corner of his mouth.  He wasn’t there, a month ago, when Harry kicked off about this.</p><p>Harry laughs, and the force of it makes his eyes sting.  “Don’t you think that he’s a hero?” he asks Ron back.  “I think that he’s a hero.  All that stuff makes him a hero.  We should’ve realised it, back in the day.”</p><p>Frowning, Ron’s expression seems to suggest that Harry’s position is obviously different from this.  “You hate it when people keep secrets,” he says.</p><p>“That’s not true,” Harry points out.  Or – “I like it when things are revealed.”</p><p>He’s thinking of Draco, in honesty.  Draco’s the exception to many, many rules.</p><p>“We can talk about this later,” Hermione interrupts, shushing them and dragging on their arms to make them sit down.  “But you do hate secrets, Harry,” she whispers as McGonagall rounds things up, to get the last word.  “You hate being played for a fool.  And I notice that you didn’t mention the weird thing he made you do with your eyes.”</p><p>Harry shrugs, even so.  McGonagall doesn’t take long, and then people are moving in their seats to stand up, making noise but not chatting.  Cameras flash and everyone is in their best robes.  “Something coherent with a couple of jokes,” he reports to Hermione, as they stand up too.  “That’s what I was asked for.  I think I did a good Harry Potter, don’t you?”</p>
