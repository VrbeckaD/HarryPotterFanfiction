          <div class="userstuff"><p>The Department of Mysteries had lost its wonder halfway through Harry’s first visit. By the end of said visit, suffice to say he never wanted to go back there <b> <em>ever</em> </b> again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, he was just angry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And potentially asphyxiating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Somehow, he’d accidentally wandered into a room where everything seemed to be two-dimensional. It was as though he’d been flattened by walls and smushed into a flat-Harry instead of, you know, his normal self.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Why is this here? Who the hell thought this would be a good idea? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No battle had to be waged here any more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, at least, not like <em> then. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He just needed to find Hermione, forgot exactly which office she worked in, proceeded to get lost, almost got cornered by Romilda Vane in the elevator (what she was doing working at the Ministry, Harry didn’t know and didn’t want to know), and wound up in the Department of Mysteries. To add insult to injury, he got it into his foolish skull that there had to be more than one obvious exit (and that he could handle the Department of Mysteries after all of these years)… which led to the current predicament.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Why was it always the damn Department of Mysteries? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he had to stop with the self-pity, because the room was shifting. Walls shook before beginning to smoothly crumble, flat lines throbbed as they began to shrink, and the exit seemed to be getting smaller by the second.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plane was rapidly losing height. Harry knew he had only one chance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(He also knew that if he got out of here alive, Ron and Hermione would never let him live this down. But, he also knew they would be the type of people to resurrect him and then kill him for being foolish enough to die<em> here </em> of all places).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, it was with his usual Gryffindor strength -- or, his usual sheer dumb luck, as Minerva would say -- that he hurled himself out of the flat plane and into the hallway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Never again,” Harry rasped, feeling as though he could actually breathe again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>_._</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione, in the midst of research for some new legal campaigns, felt a twinge in her gut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, she had many gut feelings (“Ron’s being a prat”, “Don’t touch that -- George has done something to it”, etc.) and many reactions (a groan in regards to Ron, a few steps taken back for George, so on and so forth) but this particular gut feeling was probably the worse:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry’s being an absolute idiot right now, isn’t he?”</p></div>
