    <p>She had never seen Lucius like this before.<br/>
That he was dismissive? Naturally!<br/>
Lucius Malfoy was a cold man who did not even reveal himself to his wife. In all their years of marriage, she has barely been able to glimpse quickly behind his mask of pride of nobility. It was not until the Dark Lord had returned that the façade crumbled until she feared the whole man behind it would break.<br/>
Now after the war, the dust had finally settled and at first sight, Narcissa had her husband back. He had recovered – back to his old self. She was still amazed after so many years, how he always managed to feather his own nest. But he had succeeded and after many exhausting months finally, peace had returned to the manor. They all recovered piece by piece and a question now occupied Narcissa daily. What happened now?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was an arranged marriage, but she grew to love this highly reserved, pride wizard, nonetheless. He had become a faithful companion to her, and she did not want to give him up despite all his mistakes. But what if that was not her decision? If he had already decided long ago? This fear became more and more manifest with each passing day.<br/>
Lucius avoided her whenever he could. Even at the dinner table he never met her gaze. And every time she tried to touch him, he flinched as if she were poisonous. She could have responded with understanding, patience and forbearance. But at the same time, he had pulled up his walls so high as she had never seen it before. 

Even at the beginning of her shaky, fragile and above all, loveless marriage, he had felt closer than he did now. Back then she at least has had the feeling that he was trying. Something. He had always given himself respectful to her and had never pushed her to anything. She knew that it could have been different and so she gave him great credit for his behaviour up to this day. But now he had finally slipped away from her, she knew that. He had spent several months in Azkaban and since then he has been infinitely far away.<br/>
She did not even know where he was right now. Was he out or still in the manor? If so, she certainly would not run into him accidentally. He had a sixth sense for it and averted her precisely like a bat in the night. She had to decide what will come next.<br/>
In any case, she would not keep on living like this, and even if this was a novelty, today she would address at dinner, what put a strain on her. If he really wanted to get rid of her, he should do that like a gentleman. Say it to her face so she could escape this graveyard.<br/>
There was still an enchanting country estate in France in their possession, which always brought her a lot of joy. Even if it pained her to leave England and Lucius. But she couldn’t live with this shadow anymore, who did not even speak to her properly. She understood that the last months, no, years had taken a toll on him, but why didn’t he talk to her about it?<br/>
She was still his wife and after all, they went through together… They went to hell and back and that should be all that’s left of them?<br/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When they sat – as always – silently at the oversized dining table, Lucius surprised her.<br/>
She almost dropped her fork, but she pulled herself together. The sound of his voice had almost become unfamiliar.<br/>
“I was thinking about our current situation,” he said, breaking the bad news. That they were bad news, Narcissa did not doubt. He sounded so formal and stiff as if he had to make a plea in court.<br/>
For the first time in a long time, he looked her in the eye, but she could have done without it. He looked at her as if she was a stranger. And there was nothing left of this once so witty and charming man. Back in the days, all he needed to get her into bed was one look and his devilish smile.<br/>
Today they even slept in different wings of the house.<br/>
“I think you agree with me when I say that this situation is no longer acceptable”<br/>
Narcissa nodded slowly. Feared his conclusion.<br/>
“I set you free, Narcissa.”<br/>
He had spoken those words softly, but they were ringing in her ears. She had feared it.<br/>
“So, you simply decide the end of our marriage, without even discussing it with me? Not every one of your words is the law!”<br/>
The last sentence might have been a little thoughtless, but it was enough for her.<br/>
“What is happening here, Lucius? We are not talking anymore. You are avoiding me and even having dinner together is hell! What have I done to you?”, it suddenly burst out of her uncontrollably.<br/>
Lucius blinked a few times in surprise, seeming to have to deal with that.<br/>
“Narcissa, I don’t know, what…”<br/>
“Of course you know!”<br/>
Her voice cracked and the wineglass got smashed against the wall.<br/>
“Don’t you dare to act so unsuspecting!”<br/>
The plate followed the glass.<br/>
“You know exactly what I am talking about!”<br/>

</p><p> </p>
<p>An expensive salad bowl she did not care about was thrown to the floor. All these years she had made the perfect wife. Has always been faithful to his side and damned, she had suffered, too.<br/>Had to endure torments and fears that had surpassed everything she had ever known before. And now he sat here, wanted to send her away and not even now he was ready for a real conversation. She almost wanted to strangle him.<br/>Lucius had already jerked up at the clink of the wineglass and watched her now silently. This cursed silence.<br/>That silence drove her closer to the edge of madness that her sister ever had.<br/>Narcissa expected everything possible. But most of all, she expected him to leave the dining room without a word. But that did not happen. Instead, he sank back into his chair and buried the face in his hands.<br/>Narcissa immediately stopped in her rage and looked at him in surprise. It was as if all the rigidity fell off of him and he collapsed.<br/>“I am sorry, Narcissa.”<br/>It had only been a whisper and she had trouble hearing it. But most of all, it took all the wind out of her sails. Slowly she put down another plate and walked around the table towards Lucius.<br/>“Talk to me! What’s the matter with you?”, she almost begged now.<br/>Again just silence.<br/>“Damn it, Lucius! We’ve been through two wars together. Together we went through hell and somehow managed that neither we nor our son perish. TOGETHER! We survived all this, and we could always rely on each other. So, what have I done so horribly that you punish me with silence?”<br/>The last sentence did its work. Immediately Lucius tore his head up and finally looked her in the eye again. The expression in his eyes, however, were hard to bear. So much pain was reflected in them, but it disappeared after seconds. What remained was the cold, almost dead expression he had perfected over the last months. Probably his whole life. By Merlin, what was wrong with him?<br/>“Lucius?”<br/>“You did not do anything wrong. On the contrary. You did everything right. You have mastered your duties with flying colours and now I let you go. You are no longer bound to me. This is a present, not a punishment.”<br/>“Do you hate our marriage so much that you can not even stand me in the house?”, she managed to say just before she had to turn away. She was a Malfoy. No, technically she was probably a Black again, but either way, such a burst of emotions and even tears were not acceptable.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A hand on her shoulder made her spin around again.<br/>Lucius had risen silently and was now as close to her as they weren’t in a long time.<br/>“On the contrary, Narcissa. I will be eternally grateful to you, but for that very reason, I can not keep you imprisoned. You have a right to a fresh start.”<br/>Shortly, Narcissa did not know what to say. Did he really mean that?<br/>“There is no reason not to make a fresh start together. Why do you really want to get rid of me?”<br/>Again he averted his eyes and for a second she believed to recognize shame flickering across his face.<br/>“The question is, why would you want to stay with me? Because that’s the way it was always done? Tradition? Or a sense of duty? You have fulfilled your duties more than enough and forget about these antiquated traditions!”<br/>Narcissa no longer recognized her own husband. The Lucius Malfoy, whom she had married, would defend these so-called antiquated traditions with claws and teeth.<br/>“Stop talking such nonsense and be so kind and tell me directly in the face if you want to get rid of me!”<br/>Only when Lucius flinched back, seemingly startled she realized how loud she had become. The longer this conversation went, the more unstable the two of them became – that was clear to Narcissa. She screamed and Lucius took silently cover. Now he had even taken a few steps back. If she did not know better…<br/>“What are you afraid of, Lucius?”, she asked softly.<br/>Another step back.<br/>“What do you mean?”<br/>The piqued and seemingly amazed undertone did not deceive her that she had hit a nerve.<br/>“Lucius Malfoy, we are grown up and married for over 20 years. We should be able to talk to each other. Even about problems. I am still your wife. And none of this will ever leave this room!”<br/>Lucius froze and raised now the rest of his walls. He gave her a curt nod and then stalked out of the dining room without further comment.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exhausted, Narcissa sank into a chair, poured herself a glass of wine and emptied it all at once. That probably couldn’t have gone worse. But she just could not take it anymore. She had never felt so lonely.  At most, perhaps, when Lucius had been in Azkaban. But even then, she had known he was by her side. No matter what.<br/>But that was finally over. He was not perfect. He was far from that. But she missed her husband.<br/>She refrained from another glass of wine and decided to go to bed with a book for comfort and distraction.</p>
