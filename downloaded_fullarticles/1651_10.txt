<hr/>Fate x KHR x Saint Seiya. (Shirō!Kensuke from AVALON!Relative-Heavens hit by malfunctioned 10 Year Bazooka and landed in the world of Saints. Pissed off Shirō!Kensuke= walking disaster. This spelled chaos, one kind which Reborn’d love.)<hr/>

  <u>CHAOSBREWER</u>
</p><p>It was the calm before the storm.</p><p>Lots of things could be handled by Mochida Kensuke. His patience unlike Tsuna but compared to Vongola’s inner circle –Guardians and other upper echelons-, he fell under the ‘more patient’ ones.</p><p>Just…not for today.</p><p>His source of ire?</p><p>A grandeur Greek temple adorned in Greco-pillars. The moon’s cold light fell from the entrance. People in <em>armors</em> locked their eyes straight at him.</p><p>Wherever Kensuke might be, he doubted he was in the <em>future</em>.</p><p>(Tampering a time travel bazooka was one thing. But this?)</p><p>(A word for Spanner and Shōichi, after Tsuna has hers.)</p><p>A golden warrior with lavender hair was stuck on the pillar, unable to move (Telekinesis? Gravity manipulation? Mistic Code?). There was the younger one clad in white armor and had this dumbfounded gaze at Kensuke. Understandable, Kensuke did abruptly show up in pink smoke.</p><p>“The f*** are you!? Are you a Saint!?” The big guy in dark and ugly armor growled.</p><p>Others dark armored men either sneered or flouted.</p><p>“Look at him, he’s trying to be a hero.”</p><p>“Pathetic mortal.”</p><p>“The punk thinks he can defeat us?”</p><p>Another suffering sigh escaped from the magus’ nostril. Another typical good guy versus bad guy and not a normal one either. His D-Rank Luck persistently followed him despite the reincarnation.</p><p>Oh well.</p><p>Firing the trigger inside his mind, Magic Circuits flared up. Held within his grasp was none other than Hercules’ axe-sword. A bit overkill, you say? It would be, in any normal condition. You see, Kensuke was having his scarce peaceful time with Tsuna. Came back from a date and escorted her to her home, Tsuna was about to give him a see you kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Then the bazooka got him, putting him in current situation.</p><p>Unacceptable.</p><p>So when the opportunity offered for free? Nothing too destructive, just a little of ‘bite to the death’, lending Hibari’s quote. Just a tiny, <em>tiny</em> bit of ‘biting’ and <em>little</em> vent of stress.</p><p>(Hibari will be pleased. Tonight, a bloodbath will be shed. The herbivores will be slaughtered.)</p><p>Lifting the axe-sword, Kensuke hurled toward the terrified dark warriors.</p><p>“Nine Lives Works.”</p><p>(Nobody messed an angry spellcaster, notably the one in love above it.)</p><p align="center">-o-</p><p>A challenging fight it has been but relatively easy to handle. Aside from these men, he encountered this demonic slime in the deeper part of the temple. It seemed the slime thing was the one responsible for the golden warrior’s telekinesis imprisonment.</p><p>(Few numbers of traced Gae Dearg had done the job in eradicated it. It should’ve enough.)</p><p>(The golden and white warriors’ shared look had Kensuke wondered if he should’ve done more.)</p><p>Once the enemies were dealt, the golden warrior freed from his imprisonment. The white warrior cried out of relief, hurriedly by the older warrior’s side. After checked out for more enemies, Kensuke dismissed the Gae Dearg on his possession.</p><p>“I hope no one is injured. Mochida Kensuke, a spellcaster.”</p><p>“Spell…?” The white one trailed off in question.</p><p>“A magic wielder. Unlike witches or wizards, we use magic no different as tool.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s cool! I’m Pegasus Seiya. Thanks for the help, those guys are pretty tough.”</p><p>“My name is Aries Mu, Gold Saint of Aries.” The Aries Saint’s gaze sharpened. “While we appreciated your assistance, you yet explain how did you enter 12 Temples when the barrier activated?”</p><p>Barrier? As in Bounded Field? Now that he mentioned it, Kensuke picked up a strong scent of earth and fresh from every direction. Mu himself reeks of dew and iron ore while Seiya…</p><p>A deep frown marred Kensuke’s eyebrows. Strange, his scent nearly resembled Tsuna’s. Of fresh and vast blue sky, but something else mixed in. A déjà vu from the first time he smelled Kawahira’s scent. Intriguing, he would watch for this one. As for why he was here…?</p><p>Resigned, Kensuke prepared for a not so believable explanation. “It’s a long story.”</p><p align="center">-o-</p><p>After briefly exchanged their situation, it turned out Kensuke was in fact flung into a parallel world. A world where instead of mafia, the Gods still rule and walked across the world. Aries Mu and Pegasus Seiya were warriors under Athena’s order, the War and Knowledge Goddess of Greek.</p><p>They were in war versus Hades the God of Underworld. Specters, his direct underlings, invaded Athena’s Sanctuary. They only have 12 hours to reach Main Temple before Specters kill Athena first. Stuck in the middle of it was none other than Kensuke.</p><p>He felt unsure whether to continuously hitting his head to the wall or curse to heaven. After a deep ponder, he finally chose the third opinion…</p><p>“You said these Specters maimed your…Goddess.”</p><p>In careful cautiousness, Mu gave his affirmative nod. Seiya waited in eager yet without coercion.</p><p>It has been settled then.</p><p>“If you do not mind, may I offer help until I find my way back?”</p><p align="center">-o-</p><p> The world will never prepare for the dawning havoc. One induced none other by a teen male. Possessed magus’ memory and capability perhaps enough to destroy a country.</p><p>Oh the horror.</p><p>(Those poor Saints and Specters, they had no idea what they’ve gotten themselves into.)</p><p align="center">-o-</p><p>Years later, a legend was retold among Sanctuary’s denizens and trainers. A legend famous as the legend of Pegasus the God Slayer. A legend about a stranger from far world.</p><p>Of how he demolished Specters with a monstrous rock sword.</p><p>(A justify considering Kensuke was forcefully taken from his girlfriend’s side.)</p><p>Of how a whole shrine pulverized by gigantic, heavenly light sword.</p><p>(Really, <em>two</em> Athena Exclamations at the same time? Better stop those Gold Saints, both the revived and alive ones, with Ig Alima or else.)</p><p>Of how Athena earned a smack from the stranger’s stripped shinai.</p><p>(Pushing away the Bronze Saints wasn’t the same as protecting them.)</p><p>Of how he damned Specters as he helped Bronze Saints stormed Underworld.</p><p>(All Specters seek his and Bronze Saints’ worst possible deaths. Not his fault if he fought back.)</p><p>Of how he annihilated Gods using an attack that can create distorted reality.</p><p>(<em>Not</em> true. Seiya and his friends were the ones directly fought the twin Gods and later Hades.)</p><p>(He <em>did</em> however use Enkidu and invoked Reality Marble for the final blow in both battles.)</p><p>No one knew his true origin or identity. By the end of war, his lover and friends picked him up and went back to wherever he came from. In the end, everyone agreed at anything but one thing. Beware for the ordinary looking one.</p><p>You’ll never know what kind of disaster locked and hiding beneath that façade.</p><p> </p>
