    <p>Hermione sat next to the hospital bed, head in her hands. </p>
<p>She’d fought, they’d all fought, and though they had won, they’d all lost something or someone, but she knew that this would be one loss too far. </p>
<p>She’d stayed right next to Fred Weasley’s bed ever since he was transported to St Mungos. Her only respite was when George came, when she felt ok about slipping away for an hour to shower and eat and change her clothes.</p>
<p>Mrs Weasley didn’t understand, Ginny and Harry certainly didn’t understand, it seemed the only people who did were George, Bill and Fleur. </p>
<p>After a week of this exhausting routine, Fleur had come and kept her company on one of the days that George wasn’t well enough to make it. Hermione considered making excuses to leave, but she found that the time that she had spent with the older witch to be the most relaxing and easy time since the battle.</p>
<p>“I reemember when my Bill was in ze ‘ospital wing at ‘ogwarts. ‘E was unconscious. I didn’t know what to do wiz myself.” She paused, “‘Ermione, I know we ‘ave never been what you would call friends, but I know ‘ow you must be feeling now, non?”</p>
<p>“You must have been terrified.” Hermione croaked. She realised what Fleur was insinuating, but decided not to confirm it or comment, just in case she was reading into it wrong.</p>
<p>“‘E somehow looked peaceful, as Fred looks now, ‘is beautiful face was a mess and ‘e was in a bad way and Molly was <i>so</i> sure zat I would leave him.” Fleur sighed, “Eet <i>never</i> even crossed my mind to leave ‘im. 'E could 'ave been an actual werewolf and I would 'ave stuck by his side. Mon loulou.” She blinked away tears, shook her head, then looked down at Hermione’s arm. “‘Ow is your arm? It healed ok?”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled up her sleeve to show Fleur the silvery scarring spelling out ‘Mudblood’. She’d found that if she used her left hand to do magic, the scars stung as if they were fresh wounds. After debating for a few moments, she told Fleur this.</p>
<p>“Ah oui, magic scars can do zat, I'm afraid.” She frowned. “I ‘ad hoped with ze ointment it would fade more, but i suppose eet is still new. Give eet time.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Fleur, for everything. You helped us so much.” Hermione found that she was on the verge of tears. </p>
<p>“‘Ermione, ma petite étoile, you are family to Ron and to ‘arry, so you are family to me. Zat’s what family is for.” Fleur gracefully pulled Hermione into a hug.</p>
<p>“What if he doesn’t wake up?” Hermione sniffed.</p>
<p>“You zink zere is a chance that Fred of all the people, won’t wake up. ‘E is so stubborn, and while zere’s unfinished business, ‘e is going nowhere.” Hermione looked at her, confused. “‘Ermione, you and Fred kissed in ze kitchen at my wedding. I presume zat it was not just a drunken shenanigan, as you say.”</p>
<p>“You know?!” Hermione yelped. “I- we- I mean- Yes, we did and I suppose that it is unfinished business. It felt like it was a long time coming, you know? Like it was something I should have been doing forever.”</p>
<p>“I know what zat feels like, yes. Who else knows?”</p>
<p>“Just Ron, as far as I know. Fred probably told George too, I suppose.” Hermione shook her head, “You and Bill too, now.”</p>
<p>“Bill ‘ad ‘idden a bottle of firewhiskey under ze sink and came to get it but found you and Fred instead.” She laughed softly. “I zink you will be very good together, ‘Ermione. ‘E needs someone to reign him in a bit, and you need someone to make sure you live life fully. You complement one another.”</p>
<p>“We wrote to one another while Harry, Ron and I were on the run, it started off just letting the other know that we were safe and alright, and then it progressed and I guess there was a bit of an undercurrent of flirtation. Ron read one of them once and pretended to vomit, like he could talk, bloody Won-Won.”</p>
<p>“‘Ow did ‘e react? I must admit, I always suspected zat it would be you and Ron together.” Fleur arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“He said that Fred was the last one of his siblings he would have thought I would be with, but as long as we both made each other happy, then it was fine by him. It was shortly after he came back from staying with you, and I think he’d had a bit of a revelation about his relationships with Harry and I.” Hermione smiled.</p>
<p>“‘E is a good man. Zey all are.” Fleur smiled, “Fred will pull through, ‘Ermione. L'amour prévaudra.” She patted Hermione’s arm and stood up to leave.</p>
<p>“Fleur, I… I wasn’t very nice to you before you married Bill. I’m sorry if I ever upset you, I wish that we’d talked sooner.” Hermione looked up at her.</p>
<p>“You were young. I was different.” Fleur smiled, “We’ll talk more.”</p>
<p>“I’d like that.” Hermione waved to Fleur as she left, then slumped back in her chair.</p>
<p>The next time she’d seen Fred in person, after the wedding, he was unmoving and pale, he’d been placed in a magically induced coma on the floor of The Great Hall with his family surrounding him. The look that Ron gave her over Charlie and Bill’s heads made her feel as if her heart were breaking.</p>
<p>She and George spent a lot of time together over the following two weeks, if she didn’t already know all of the idiosyncrasies that made both George and Fred unique, she could have kidded herself that she was spending time with Fred. He told her a lot of stories about their childhood, some of the pranks they’d pulled at Hogwarts, then finally asked her when she realised.</p>
<p>“When I realised what?” She looked over at George.</p>
<p>“That you’re in love with Freddie.” His face was neutral, there was no sign of him joking around or teasing her.</p>
<p>“George, I-” She started.</p>
<p>“I figured that’s why you’ve been here all the time. He’s had feelings for you for a while, so I just wondered where you’re at, because he’s going to wake up.” George paused. “When he does, you’re going to be there, and I’d hate for him to get the wrong idea.”</p>
<p>“How long is a while?” Hermione frowned, she had no idea that she hadn’t been alone in her feelings.</p>
<p>“I’d say probably the summer before seventh year, when we stayed with Sirius.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense.” Hermione nodded slowly, “He used to apparate into rooms where I was reading just to make me jump, and he’d stay and talk to me about what I was reading. I was positively perplexed at the time. I thought it was part of an elaborate prank at first but you didn’t seem to be in on it, it was always Fred, and he always stayed to talk.”</p>
<p>“So, when was it for you?” George probed again.</p>
<p>“Around the same time, I guess, it was so refreshing to have someone to talk to about books and life in general. He didn’t have an agenda and he’s so easy to talk to. Then I thought he was just being nice, but I didn’t know why. I was still writing to Viktor when I got to Grimmauld Place, he wanted me to visit him, but the more time I spent with Fred, I realised that while Viktor was a nice person, and obviously a famous quidditch star, we had absolutely nothing in common. When I saw him at Bill’s wedding that confirmed it, he kept talking about his house elves.” George snorted, “Exactly! Then he wanted to dance, but Fred cut in and told him I was needed in the kitchen, and the rest is history.” She shrugged, “I never thought that Fred’d reciprocate my feelings though, so I never told anybody, not even Harry or Ginny.”</p>
<p>“Which is why they don’t understand why you’re here all the time.” He nodded, “That makes more sense. They think you feel some kind of survivors guilt.”</p>
<p>“I presume he told you about Bill’s wedding.” </p>
<p>“Of course he did. He wouldn’t shut up about it. For weeks all I hear was ‘She kissed me back, Georgie, it was phenomenal, her hair was so soft, her lips tasted like chocolate, should I owl her?’” George smiled at her. “Then when you replied to that first owl, you’d think he’d been presented with an Order of Merlin or something.”</p>
<p>“Harry and Ron couldn’t understand why Fred, of all people, was writing to me. At first I told them it was so we knew everyone your end was ok, and vice versa.” She sighed, “Ron figured it out eventually, he actually said he would have put me with Percy or Ginny before he put me with Fred, but he’s ok with it. Part of me worried that because people had this expectation for Ron and I, that he would be angry or upset. He’s a very good friend. He didn’t even tell Harry, and Harry, being Harry, didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>“For someone who defeated a dark lord, he’s so oblivious.” George laughed. “I have to admit that when Fred first told me, I couldn’t see it ever working out, but he seemed to be happy with the time that he spent with you, so I wasn’t about to piss on his cornflakes.”</p>
<p>“When we got back to school though, everything went back to the way it was before. Ron, Harry and I, and you two and Lee. The only times I saw Fred were DA meetings and when I had to stop you testing on first years, I swear.” She shook her head, laughing.</p>
<p>“He bet ten galleons for you to beat Ron at duelling in the third DA meeting.” George yawned, “I know he missed spending time with you, but he didn’t know if you’d want that, now that you were back at school.”</p>
<p>“I wish he’d told me.” </p>
<p>“I wish I had too.” A voice behind them made them both jump. Fred was awake and grinning. “So you can go back to talking about how much ‘Mione loves me whenever.”</p>
<p>“How much did you hear?” George’s grin matched his brother’s.</p>
<p>“Enough.” The grin became a smirk.</p>
<p>“Right now, I don’t know whether I want to kiss you or push you off a bloody bridge!” Hermione rose to her feet, her body aching from the plastic hospital chair that no cushioning charm could help.</p>
<p>“Can I choose?” Fred winked at her.</p>
