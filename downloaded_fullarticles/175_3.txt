    <p>Two men sit within their respective homes. One sits with his head buried in his hands, mourning every wrong choice he ever made. The other stands at his kitchen sink, looking out the foggy window above it into the cold night, mourning every life he could not save. Ironically, both men found themselves thinking of the other, both wishing to right the wrongs of the past, both feeling as if there was no hope for the future. Unbeknownst to the men, fate would soon intervene. For it believed that the two men, despite all that happened between them, were the only ones who could help the other heal.<br/> So that night, as Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were falling asleep, fate sneaks in and plants a seed, a plan, an idea if you will. That maybe reconciliation isn’t so far fetched, that maybe there is a chance to mend the broken pieces of the past into a whole and fruitful future. Smiling, fate retreats, deciding that it was now up to the two men to heal, and one day, to find each other.</p><p>
  <em>5 years later</em>
</p><p>Harry Potter was well and truly fucked. Grabbing his coat, wand, and the bouquet of tulips he picked up earlier, he ran out of his flat, barely managing to say the locking spell before he closes his eyes and disapparates away with a pop. Harry lands in a hidden alley about 400 meters from his date’s house. Honestly, Harry could not believe he was late. This was the one night he had really wanted to be on time, and he still managed to cock it up.</p><p><br/> “Oh, well,” Harry thinks, sprinting to the yellow house at the end of the street, “It’s not like I can do anything about it now.”</p><p>Coming to a stop in front of the dark oak door, Harry takes a moment to straighten himself out before taking a deep breath and knocking on the door.</p><p><br/> Harry smiles as the door opens, holding out the bouquet of tulips, “You look beautiful, baby.”</p><p><br/> Ginny smiles broadly, taking the bouquet, “Thank you, Harry.” She says, stepping onto her porch, locking the door behind her.</p><p><br/> Harry slips his hand into Ginny’s, interlacing their fingers, “Ready?”</p><p><br/> Ginny nods, “Ready.”</p><p><br/> And with their destination clear in mind, Harry disapparates them.</p><p>Arriving at the burrow has never lost its magic for Harry. Every time he appears in front of the large, lopsided building, he’s left breathless. The windows are always lit warmly, the pink willow trees Molly planted sway softly in the breeze, laughter can be heard pouring from inside the house, and Harry feels like he’s home. Ginny squeezes his hand, and he looks at her. The moonlight washes her face in an ethereal glow, reflecting beautifully in her eyes and hair. Looking at Ginny, something twinges in his chest. Ginny is his home, she is what connects him to his home. Without her, Harry doesn’t know what he would do.<br/> They walk, hand in hand, into the burrow. The Weasley clan shout their greetings as Molly pulls him into a tight hug. Harry allows himself to be coddled, smiling and nodding as Molly asks her usual questions.</p><p>
  <em>Are you eating enough, dear? How are the kids doing? When are you two going to get married?</em>
</p><p><br/> The last question makes Harry and Ginny share a secret smile. Harry stays talking to Molly for a few more moments before Ginny swoops in. Harry smiles at her before wandering off to go find Ron and Hermione.</p><p>He spots the pair sitting in the front room. They had pushed two armchairs together, forming a makeshift loveseat in front of the fire. Hermione’s head leans against Ron’s shoulder, her closed eyes and even breathing signaling she is asleep. Ron sees me and smiles tiredly, gesturing with his free hand to sit in front of him.</p><p>“Hey, mate,” Harry whispers, trying to avoid waking the pregnant Hermione, “where’s Rosie?”</p><p><br/> “Upstairs taking a nap,” Ron says, “She was a right wanker to put down tonight. Kept saying she wanted to wait for her Uncle Harry before her nap.”</p><p><br/> Harry smiles, “I love that kid.”</p><p><br/> Ron chuckles, and they settle into a comfortable silence, listening to the crackling fire and Hermione’s soft breathing.</p><p><br/> “Are you going to do it today?”</p><p><br/> Harry doesn’t look at Ron, just stares ahead at the fire and nods. Ron sighs and Harry hears shuffling behind him before Ron plops himself on the floor beside Harry and puts an arm around his shoulders.</p><p><br/> “I know marriage is a big deal to you, mate, but Ginny will say yes.”</p><p><br/> “I know.” Harry says, still not looking away from the fire.</p><p><br/> He knows, Harry knows Ginny will say yes. If he closes his eyes, Harry can picture a dozen Christmases and birthdays. He can see holidays at the Burrow, Ron and Hermione at his wedding, the irreversible tying of him to the Weasleys. He can feel the comfort of truly belonging.</p><p><br/> “You know,” Ron says, a goofy smile spreading across his lips, “for years now I’ve called you my brother, but now you’ll actually be in the family.”</p><p><br/> And Harry knows Ron means no harm by saying that. He knows. However, every time Ron says something about Harry <em>really</em> being in the family, it makes him feel like maybe he was never in the family in the first place.</p><p>In the end, Harry has been planning this proposal for a month now, and Harry is determined to see it through. So, after dinner, right as Molly is serving dessert, Harry drops to one knee. Hermione and Rose scream, Arthur nods approvingly, Ron is taking pictures, Molly drops her pie, and Ginny looks like she is going to start crying as she drops to her knees and kisses him right after whispering “yes!”</p><p><br/> As various friends and family members come up to him to give their congratulations, Harry couldn’t help but notice the nagging feeling in the back of his mind telling him something isn’t right. But looking at Ginny, smiling and talking with Hermione and Molly, and Ron giving him a thumbs up, Harry can’t help but shove the feeling away.</p><p><br/> “This is where I’m meant to be.”</p><p>“Well,” Ginny says, turning to face Harry, “I guess we better find a wedding planner.”</p>
