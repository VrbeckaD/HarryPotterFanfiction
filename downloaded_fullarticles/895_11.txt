    <p>I – Wake Me Up</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy’s eyes fluttered as they cracked open, no footsteps running through the hall, no cats meowing to wake up Astoria and him early in the am. </p>
<p>Well, just him now. </p>
<p>Astoria would never be next to him again. </p>
<p>She was buried in their family graveyard. Taken way too young due to a blood curse found in the Greengrass’ bloodline due to inbreeding. </p>
<p>It seemed he couldn’t win. Couldn’t pick the winning side of the war, couldn’t live with his wife for more than 20 years. She was so full of life and unrepentant Pro-Muggle life that made his parents look down on her – his father especially seeing as his mother died not long after Astoria and Draco married. He offered to put Astoria out of her misery and that was the only time Draco punched his father in the face and threw him out of his small house that he shared with Astoria and Scorpius and their two cats.</p>
<p>Draco put his back to the door and sank to the ground, smacking his head on the door as tears fell down his face. He knew his wife, his beloved Astoria, wouldn’t be alive much longer. He begged her not to get pregnant, as he knew it would lower her lifespan so significantly but she wanted to give him a son, wanted Draco to have someone after she died. </p>
<p>Astoria knew she would not have the long life that everyone else would have. She would die young but she would go out fighting. She would pour all her love and all her guidance into her husband and her son while she had the chance. She introduced Draco to the Muggle world, they would walk hand in hand as no one recognized Draco as a famous Death Eater, just as a beautiful, young couple walking around London. She taught Draco how to drive, helped him pick out a silver Audi, which he adored, introduced him to designer clothing which he took to like a duck to water. She made a difference. If a pureblood like Draco could see the appeal of the Muggle world, then maybe he could pass along that knowledge to their son and they could change the Wizarding World. </p>
<p>Draco wiped his tears as he got to his feet, walking past his cats, to his wife. Astoria was still asleep, her brown hair strewn across the white pillow, Draco gently caressed the brown locks as his wife slept on. She was incredibly weak and spent little time awake at this point in her disease. Her parents just left, they had known this day was coming but it came all too soon, they had just gotten a grandchild, something they thought they wouldn’t get. Draco sighed as he clutched his wife’s hand, rubbing his thumb along the slightly warm hand. The healers said they couldn’t do anymore to help her and that just to make her as comfortable as possible for the rest of the time she was among the living. </p>
<p>Astoria’s eyes flickered open, as she turned her head slowly to her husband, the man she was proud to know and she was so proud to be his wife. For the short time she had him, he treated her like a queen. She smiled gently at her husband, she could see that he was crying recently. </p>
<p>Draco tried to stop the tears from continuing to appear, to appear strong for his wife. </p>
<p>“Draco.” Astoria’s soft voice, weakened by the disease and disuse. </p>
<p>“Darling, save your strength.” Draco gently admonished, bringing her hand up to his lips and kissed her hand. </p>
<p>“It is pointless; I’ll be gone soon enough.” Astoria remarked. </p>
<p>“Tori.” Draco pleaded. </p>
<p>“I can’t hold on much longer, Draco. I love you and I love our life. I have treasured these moments more than you can ever know.” Astoria smiled at him. </p>
<p>“I love you, Astoria.” Draco rose up and kissed her forehead. Astoria smiled gently, all of her strength dwindling. </p>
<p>“Tell Scorp.” Astoria pleaded. </p>
<p>“I will.” Draco promised. </p>
<p>Astoria nodded and then closed her eyes for the last time. Draco sat down and started weeping, placing his head on her stomach, his head not moving with her breathing. </p>
<p>Astoria Malfoy nee Greengrass was dead. </p>
<p>Draco spent some time, weeping over his deceased wife before rising to firecall his in-laws and telling them the news.  </p>
<p>Scorpius was inconsolable. </p>
<p>Draco held his head in his hands as he tried not to let the whispers get to him at the funeral. </p>
<p>“Poor Astoria, must be that she married into the Malfoy family. Bad family.” One funeral goers whispered to the other. </p>
<p>Eventually, after Scorpius returned to his room with his best friend Albus, Potter’s son. Some days he couldn’t believe the irony that he wanted Potter’s friendship and his son got it almost effortlessly. </p>
<p>He sat down at the desk in his office and rubbed his face tiredly. He could do without all the passive aggressive whispers and condolences to his face. </p>
<p>Draco looked up as he heard his door open, he saw his father. </p>
<p>This is the last thing I need, Draco thought to himself. </p>
<p>“Draconius.” Lucius intoned his blonde hair regally. Draco withheld a snort. </p>
<p>“You know as well as I do that my name is Draco, it isn’t short for Draconius.” Draco raised a pale eyebrow. </p>
<p>“Yes, your mother did win that battle.” Lucius sniffed, stroking the head of his cane. </p>
<p>“What do you want? I really should check on Scorpius.” Draco started to rise. </p>
<p>“I wanted to give you this.” He took out an object of his robes, wrapped in cloth. “It is a true Time Turner, you lost your wife so early, you could go back and see her.” He said nothing more, giving a nod and leaving to allow his son to mourn his young wife. </p>
<p>He looked at the Time Turner, sorely tempted. But it was too much of risk even if he desperately wanted to see Astoria well and not succumbing to the bone curse that eventually caused her death. </p>
<p>A wave of rage came over him, Lucius could have used the Time Turner for a multitude of reasons. To see Narcissa, but it was clear that Lucius did not particularly care for his late wife. But mostly, Draco was glad he didn’t go back and make sure the Dark won the war. </p>
<p>Draco’s eyes clenched shut as an ever present wave of grief swept over him for his mother, even after all these years. It was almost too much to handle with Astoria just passing away and him thinking upon his mother’s unnecessary death. He could feel the grief building and building until it coalesced into pure, unfiltered rage. </p>
<p>He grasped the Time Turner and threw it as hard as he possibly could at the stone wall, watching in satisfaction as the glass shattered. </p>
<p>He grew alarmed as the dust came around him and formed a tornado around him, he fought it, trying to get free, to get to his son.</p>
<p>“Scorpius!” </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>
  <em>Scorpius was laid in his arms by a mid-wife. He looked over at his exhausted but smiling wife, Astoria. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“His name is Scorpius.” She smiled tiredly. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The babe reached up and grabbed onto Draco’s finger as he traced his cheek, grey eyes opened and he grinned at his father, his heart already stolen by this child. </em>
</p>
<p>The tornado coalesced. </p>
<p>
  <em>“What do you mean, bone curse?” Draco demanded to his father in law. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Astoria won’t live much longer than I am now, that is if she doesn’t have a child. Please consider persuading her to not have children, it acerbates the curse in our bloodline. Astoria has the full curse. Thankfully I have had only daughters so it cannot pass any further, but I wish I could heal Astoria, nothing will work. We’ve had many healers and experts around the world look at it.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco looked down. He was summoned to his father-in-law to have a “private meeting.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I don’t care if I’m the last Malfoy. I love Astoria and I will treasure every day I have with her.” He stared Lord Greengrass down, unbeknowest gaining his respect for his new son-in-law. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Memories drifted through his mind, both his and others. </em>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“Draco, I regret to inform you that your mother has died.” Lucius informed him when Draco questioned why he was seen with a young witch in France. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Lucius then turned and left, Draco being left glaring a hole in his father’s back and silently vowing to avenge his mother somehow.</em>

  <em>Molly turned and saw her son on the ground, a smile curved around his face, tears running down her face at her Freddie on the ground and George still fighting Death Eaters in the Great Hall.</em>

  <em>“Is Draco alive? Is he safe?” Narcissa whispered, pretending to make sure that Harry Potter was dead on the request of the Dark Lord. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Yes.” He answered without moving his lips. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“My lord, he is dead.” She rose and Harry felt a wave of respect for Narcissa Malfoy, being brave enough to lie straight to Voldemort and his Death Eaters. </em>

  <em>She slithered to the main area where she emerged from. The sorting hat landing in front of Potter. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“This is what Dumbledore sends his champion?” Tom Riddle crowed. “A songbird and an old hat?” He cackled, grin fading as he saw Potter pull out the sword. “The Sword of Gryffindor.” He groused. </em>

  <em>Twelve-year-old Harry Potter climbed the statue of Salazar Slytherin and the basilisk reared up and Harry shoved the sword through the roof of the huge snake’s mouth with all his might, killing it, but one of the razor sharp teeth stuck in his arms as he got to the floor. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“It is only a matter of time before you die, all alone, in this chamber, in Lord Voldemort’s name.” He smirked. “Basilisk venom is one of the only substances to kill ever so quickly.” </em>

  <em>Harry took the tooth from his mouth and crawled over to the diary with the last of his strength. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“What are you doing? Dying faster?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry looked at Riddle, with his eyebrows raised, before taking the tooth and slamming it into the diary. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“No!” He cried as he clutched at his chest, Harry realizing that Riddle and the diary were seamlessly connected. He kept stabbing it until Riddle disintegrated. </em>

  <em>He laid back, waiting for the world to go dark when Fawkes appeared next to him. </em>

  <em>Ginny gasped as she sat upright, looking around and saw Harry and gulped. </em>

  <em>“What happened?” She whispered. Harry got up and held out a hand and helped her to her feet. </em>

  <em>“The boy…” A voice whispered from the back of Quirrell’s head as Harry sat on the floor where he was pushed. </em>

<p>
  <em>“What, Master?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Check the boy.” He groaned out from the turban, Harry’s brow raising more and more. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Potter, what did you see?” Harry didn’t answer, realizing something was wrong with his defense professor. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Let me see him.” He groaned. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Master, you’re not strong enough…” Quirrell simpered. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Do it.” Quirrell unbound his turban, revealing a face on the back of his professor’s head, Harry gagged in disgust. “You see what I’ve been forced to submit to… Potter. A one-year-old did this to me. Disgusting.” </em>

  <em>Voldemort hissed in pain as the protection came through, causing him immense pain. Harry saw this and vindictively put his hands more firmly on his skin, eventually causing him to disintegrate and for Quirrell to die, the Dark Magic overcoming him without the Dark Lord to temper it. </em>

<p>Draco cried out in agony as the memories battered him, one after the other as quick as a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>His mindscape was battered and bruised. </p>
<p>His housemates noticed and called for Professor Snape immediately. </p>
<p>Severus stepped through and immediately went to the young blonde’s side. He placed his hand on his forehead and tried to get into his mind to find out what was wrong but ran into a stronghold that Draco definitely didn’t have this summer when he was teaching him Occlumency over the summer. </p>
<p>He lifted his godson out of his bed, walking him over to the fireplace and flooing to his personal quarters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco slept for a whole day, Severus couldn’t find anything wrong with his godson, just waiting for him to wake up. </p>
<p>Finally, almost twenty-four hours after he awoke screaming in pain, his eyes fluttered. </p>
<p>Draco was alone when he awoken, trying to figure out where he was. He remembered the funeral and then all these memories which seemed like an out of body experience. </p>
<p>He sat up, his head hurt a bit but otherwise, he felt fine. </p>
<p>His eyes caught the calendar across the room. </p>
<p>October 1994. </p>
<p>He stared at that calendar for a few seconds and looked down as his body and realized he was fifteen again. He was a fourth year again. </p>
<p>He pushed up his sleeve, and ran a finger over the unblemished skin, he hadn’t gotten the Dark Mark yet. And if things went his way, he never would. </p>
<p>Something changed within him, perhaps it was Astoria’s influence, perhaps it was the father’s instinct to create a safer world for his son who hasn’t been born and perhaps wouldn’t be born. </p>
<p>Things needed to change. </p>
<p>He realized, through the war, that his family’s pride and arrogance was perhaps unfounded. Just because they’d could trace their family back to when they arrived in England, doesn’t mean that they are better than a witch born to a muggle family, as evidenced in Hermione Granger. </p>
<p>Granger was a bit of a swot while she was in school but she had matured and, if the tales she shared with him were to be believed, was the driving force in defeating Voldemort. Of course, Potter did the final deed but he couldn’t have done it without his best friend, Granger. </p>
<p>But Hermione Granger bested him in every class, all the magic coming to her naturally where Draco had some talent and he had been around magic his whole life. It was maddening. But looking back and realizing some facts, from hours of conversation with Hermione, after she had become Minister of Magic, he realized that the new blood was beneficial to the Pureblood lines. </p>
<p>Just look at Potter, he had a Pureblood father and a Muggleborn mother and was undoubtedly the strongest wizard Draco had ever met. He overcame being Muggle raised (Who knew? Draco was certainly flabbergasted when he discovered that fact) and took down one of the most powerful wizards in a generation. </p>
<p>Looking at the Sacred Twenty-Eight, most of the offspring from those lines, were barely above a squib and not the most intelligent. Crabbe and Goyle weren’t stupid but they acted it, they acted like goons, everyone treated them like they were dumb as a box of rocks. Pansy Parkinson looked like a pug with her face squished. He knew of countless squibs that had either been abandoned in the muggle world or murdered, all from the families in the Sacred Twenty-Eight, depending on the family, of course. </p>
<p>Things had not changed all that much, despite Granger’s best attempts at equality, the Purebloods still clung to their ideals and ideation that they were so much better than the half bloods and muggleborns. </p>
<p>Astoria did not want Scorpius to be raised like that. She went into the Muggle world and explored it and brought Draco and eventually, Scorpius. His father disagreed with how she and Draco were choosing to raise Scorpius but Draco did not care. He stood up to his father time and time again, defending his choice in Astoria, defending her decisions in their parenting, time and time again. Astoria confided in her son that it was the bravest thing she had ever seen. She did not forget who Lucius Malfoy was, that he was a dedicated Death Eater, willingly committed heinous crimes and slithered out of the punishments by lining pockets with money and holding blackmail over almost the whole of the Ministry of Magic. Astoria was disgusted by Lucius but knew that Draco had idolized his father and it took the war to remove the rose tinted glasses when it came to his father. Eventually, he started standing up to his father, who was a powerful and ruthless wizard in his own right, held no qualms about destroying Draco and Astoria and taking Scorpius to raise as his own perfect little Pureblood soldier. </p>
<p>It meant a lot to her to have him stand up to his father. It did not go unnoticed. </p>
<p>He remembered picking out a house as newlyweds with Astoria, her beautiful hair curling perfectly around her face as she happily toured house after house, hand in hand with him. Eventually, they found the right one. </p>
<p>Remembered his beloved Audi sport’s car – of Astoria teaching him how to drive the machine – of the roaring motor flying through the England roads. </p>
<p>Remembered his love of Muggle wine, of Muggle cognac, of Italian designers. </p>
<p>Astoria changed his life. Changed his outlook in life. </p>
<p>Changed him. </p>
<p>And he was ever so grateful for it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>Draco fell back asleep and when he awoke a couple hours later, Severus was there, checking on him. </p>
<p>“Draco.” He came closer and put his hand on his shoulder. “I was about to firecall your father.” </p>
<p>Unbidden, his lip curled in a snarl that looked out of place on such a young boy. </p>
<p>“I’d rather you speak with Mother than him.” Draco schooled his facial expression into a neutral one. </p>
<p>“What happened, Draco? Your dormmates said you woke up screaming.” Severus asked. </p>
<p>Draco knew he had to play this smart. He knew his godfather was a spy but he always thought he was on the Dark side, ultimately. But he knew that his godfather was instrumental in protecting Potter, despite his faults. </p>
<p>Severus was an invaluable asset. </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I woke up being assaulted by memories that are mine but some not.” He looked down at his hands. </p>
<p>“What happened before that?”</p>
<p>“I threw a Time Turner at the wall.” Draco admitted, feeling a bit foolish that he did something so immature, no matter how good it felt. </p>
<p>“Where did you get a Time Turner?” He demanded. </p>
<p>“Father had one.” Draco answered. Snape sighed, of course Lucius would have one. He would have thought he would have locked that up. </p>
<p>“Well, are you hungry?” Draco nodded. </p>
<p>“Uncle Sev, I came from 2019.” He admitted. Severus jerked as he realized that a lot more happened during that time than just having a bad dream. Severus looked at Draco and saw how sad he was. </p>
<p>“That is twenty-five years from now.” Severus stated dumbly. Draco nodded. </p>
<p>“It is. I just had the funeral for my wife.” He stated, smoothing the sheet down. </p>
<p>“Did the Dark win the war?” Severus asked, slyly making Draco think that he was on the Dark Side. </p>
<p>It didn’t work. </p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p>“Let us cut through the Slytherin inability to say something straight forward, shall we?” Draco asked, smirking at the dumbfounded look on his godfather’s face. “We both know that you’re not on the Dark Lord’s side but not completely on Dumbledore’s side. The Dark Lord was defeated by Potter eventually, after many needless deaths and he gained a lot of power, mostly due to my father and his high-ranking Death Eaters.” </p>
<p>Severus looked down. </p>
<p>“Power in the Ministry?” He queried. </p>
<p>“He took over the Ministry, so I would say yes.” He folded back the blanket, placing his feet on the cold floor, feeling a sense of comfort that Hogwarts was unblemished from the Final Battle of 1997.</p>
<p>“We can’t let anyone know that you know these things, they’ll torture it out of you.” Severus warned. </p>
<p>“I know. But I trust you. You actually care about me, unlike my Father.” </p>
<p>Severus swallowed the burst of pride and affection he felt for his godson. He looked at him carefully. Blonde hair adorned his head, matching eyebrows and grey eyes, hard as silver, unusual for someone his age. His body was lithe from the Quidditch training and he held himself as a Pureblood Heir should, measured tone, and with the Black bluntness they were infamous for. </p>
<p>“We need a plan.” Severus was brought of his thoughts from Draco’s remark. </p>
<p>“A plan?” Severus raised a brow. “What for?”</p>
<p>A smirk stole across his face as he looked at his godfather. </p>
<p>“To win the war, of course.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, it was not that easy to convince his godfather that he was telling the truth, Draco didn’t want to tell too many secrets. </p>
<p>He told Severus a few little facts, which seemed to make him believe Draco at the very least. </p>
<p>“Draco, you have been brought to this time for a reason. You need to think about what happened this year in your timeline that changed things.” Severus cautioned. </p>
<p>Draco furrowed his brow. </p>
<p>“It must be something to do with the Goblet.”</p>
