    <p>Imagine a time where Alice didn’t follow the rabbit down the rabbits hole. Or a time where the rabbit wasn’t running around like a headless chicken. Or a time where the Cheshire cat was bored. Completely and utterly bored. So bored that it took the frase: „Bored to death“ to a whole new level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cheshire cat was normaly a really active creature.<br/>
Fading in into the throne room giving the queen nearly a heart attack. Fading out when she nearly decapitates him.<br/>
Fading in near the castle guards and giving them a really big scare when they see the ilusion of his head Rolling around and his body “looking“ for it. This always send them into a screaming frenzy and a fainting deck of cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But today was a really boring day. He was sitting on a branch of a tree that sprouted near the table with the mad hatter, the mad rabbit and the sleepy mouse in the teepot. Normally it was funny watching them and their antics. Sometimes he joined them in their madness and other times he was only a silent (read laughing his ass off) bystander.</p>
<p>Today though…</p>
<p>Today they were either sleeping or looking at the tee in a strange manner that said: „ I’m looking at my tee either to remeber my past that is so tragic that I want to commit suicide or to look for the meaning of life." Neither was funny nor entertainig.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The same atmosphere hung all over Wonderland making the beautiful, lively and mad kingdom look like one of those dark and haunting places that are said to be frequented by vampires and dark creatures.<br/>
Only the cheshire cat was the only ray of sunshine in that dreary place, fading in and out looking for any hint of that old madness. But it never found it.</p>
<p>„Now what to do?“, it thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The depressing aura was just too heavy and it couldn’t lift it by itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soooo….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>as a logical conclusion the cat decided:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will look for a stronger soul and exchange myself with it so it can be born here!“</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now looking for a soul wasn’t that hard for the Cheshire cat. Being a madness personified and able to fade in whereever it wants had its perks. I mean have you ever tried to stop madness?</p>
<p><br/>
So it kept looking…</p>
<p><br/>
and looking…</p>
<p><br/>
and looking…</p>
<p>Till! It found a powerful little soul about to be born in a world full of magic and insanity.<br/>
Running like never before it rapidly took the souls memory of the time in the mothers womb and copied its memories of Wonderland into the soul. Then it pushed that soul in the direction of the Wonderland-Reality and lunged into the blinding light, to be born as our favorite green eyed wizard.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The first thing he ( because „he“ wasn’t a cat anymore) became aware of was screaming. Loud and infernal screaming.</p>
<p>Was it normal to scream at birth?</p>
<p><br/>
Unable to open his eyes, the baby could only lay there screaming and try to hear whatever it he could. Slowly he started hearing a familiar song:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"><strong> <em>Little bread and butterflies kiss the tulips</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> and the sun is like a toy balloon</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> There are get-up-in-the-morning glories</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> In the golden afternoon</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> String of violets are all in tune</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> Tiger lillies love the dandelions</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> In the golden afternoon</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> There are dog and caterpillars</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> and copper centipede</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> Where the lazy daisies</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> love the very peaceful life they lead</em> </strong><br/>
<strong> <em> You can learn a Lot of things from the flowers…</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>The body of the baby slowly calmed down. His screaming ceased. Eventhough the Cheshire cat was wide awake. How can a being from another dimension know the song the flowers loved to sing?<br/>
The baby slowly started falling asleep. But before their senses went on standby, the Cheshire cat heard:“Welcome little Harry“.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I won’t explain everything that happened till his Hogwarts letter came, but everyone could see Harrys strangeness, the madness in his poison green eyes. Sometimes when a big bout of insanity hit him, his eyes seamed to big multicolored spirals in them. The smile that he always had, seamed to get wider and little „scars“ could be seen in the bottom half of his face, from one ear to another, like a halfmoon of a real round moon or a giant mocking smile that deformed his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From time to time he disappeared and came back with the creepy smile of his. Neither his parents nor his „guardians“ knew where he went and how he managed to disappear. His parents thought it was due to his magic. With his aunt, uncle and cousin magic was freakishness, so it was due to his freakishness. His parents couldn’t see or didn’t want to see his smile, while his relatives didn’t want to have ANYTHING to do with the freak.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was THAT day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The day where his Hogwarts letter should come.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the question is now:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why did he, Harry Potter alias the Freak also known as the Cheshire cat in another world, know about magic?</p>
