    <p>Bellatrix growled, “Where is my baby.” The other woman didn’t say anything.</p><p>Bellatrix gave an insane giggle “Where is <em>your</em> baby, but is it really yours,” she hissed.</p><p>Alice Longbottom tried to fire a curse when she felt the crucio. How could she have been that stupid. Bellatrix was an incredible dueler.“You will never get Neville, he is not the chosen one, your master is dead,” Alice forced out.</p><p>Bellatrix giggled again, “I don’t care about the Dark Lord right now, Where. Is. My. Baby!” She finished with a sneer. Alice laughed, “ Your baby is dead you-!” Alice didn’t finish because she was in pain again. Rabastan Lestrange came into view with his wand held high pointing at Alice. He turned to Bellatrix, “Rodolphus is finishing with the other Longbottom, no sign of Neville,” he said.</p><p>Bellatrix paused staring at a victorious Alice before snarling, “You are going to regret<strong> that</strong>, Where is the boy. Where is my nephew!" Alice didn't say anything just fired an nonverbal reducto to Rabastan. He dodged and Alice could hear screams of pain that could have only come from her husband, Frank.</p><p>Bellatrix seemed to hear it too as she relaxed, "You may be a very good Auror but I have years on you and your Husband. You both have just come out of the academy, when you were just a wee little first year I was in the big bad world throwing crucio's and killing curses. You have no chance so goodbye,"</p><p>Another crucio found her and Alice screamed in agony and fell to the ground. The only comfort she had was that This bitch would never, <em>ever</em> get Neville.</p><p>When the curse finally finished, <em>that time, </em>Alice could barely speak but she found it in herself to croak, "You won't find Neville or your daughter because..."  the rest was never heard as another and another crucio was fired. Bellatrix was angry.</p><p>Alice slowly slinked into oblivion. </p><p>Later, really hours later. Aurors came and arrested the Lestranges who were found torturing the now insane and unreachable Longbottoms. They had been preparing for Harry Potter to come stay with them so they had dropped Neville off to stay with his grandmother.</p><p>With the Longbottoms gone Albus Dumbledore had no other option but to drop little Harry on the doorstep of the Dursleys on November 2nd as two different women cried for the loss of the child they could never hold again.</p><p>  </p>
