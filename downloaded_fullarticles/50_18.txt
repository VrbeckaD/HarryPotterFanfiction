    <hr/><p> </p><p>Heather had only one wish as she died: <b>I</b><b>f there is a</b><b> next life, I will take care of my husband. I will </b><b>learn to </b><b>love him and stay by his side.</b></p><p>It was not a sudden thought but a feeling that had been accumulating for the past few days she spent in misery because she never understood herself. How she regretted having let her fleeting whims and foolish tantrums carry her away, away from the only person who truly took care of her, who willingly listened to her even if she only had complaints towards him, who set her free in the name of love believing she would be happier without him. How wrong they both were.</p><p>Upon her divorce, her family disappeared, those who she considered her friends only used her for her name. And he, he only laughed at her childishness, at her naivete while casting her aside. Bitterness and rage filled her and she hated him; but more than anything, she hated herself for believing him. But she also had to thank him for making her see as to whom her heart truly belonged; she was just too stupid to not see it. Too indulged in assuming that what she was doing was right, when it actually wasn’t. Because in their society, freedom could never be forcefully given, and it was never for those who didn’t want it.</p><p>She discovered that too late.</p><p>She discovered all too late that her freedom was with him.</p><p>That her marriage was not a cage.</p><p>That his arms were not shackles.</p><p>That his feelings were not meant to tie her up.</p><p>A tear fell down and her eyes subconsciously turned towards the direction his residence was. The residence where she spent such a brief time but knew like the palm of her hand. She had traversed that house day and night in an attempt to run away from him. Her body would always look for the furthest place to sleep in, yet she would always wake up in the big and comfortable bed in their room. She used to hate him for that but deep inside, she enjoyed the attention; she always looked forward to their little game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>There had been a moment she was content with her life but she ruined it all when those poisonous words ensnared her mind and coiled around her fragile and easy to manipulate heart. So she hastily threw away her sweet future to bask in a short-lived and hurtful present.</p><p>But she couldn’t blame anyone. It was all her fault. She did hate those who turned their backs on her yet it was all done by herself.</p><p>If she hadn’t sought for them.</p><p>If she hadn’t believed in them.</p><p>If she hadn’t fallen in their schemes.</p><p>But what’s done is done. She would die alone. The result of a forced martyrdom. The result of wanting a scapegoat for their own goals.</p><p>It was all her fault.</p><p>Her fault.</p><p>

</p><p>She opened her eyes, startled, when she felt something cold rubbing her face. Her hand shot out and clutched at whatever was touching her only to feel warmth running through her cold palm. Her eyes locked onto the big and pale hand with slender fingers and well-trimmed nails that held a wet handkerchief. Her gaze traveled to the long and nicely muscled arm which was attached to a strong torso. She couldn’t see beyond the person’s waist but the haphazardly tied robe allowed her to look at the alluring collarbone and neck.</p><p>A curtain of black, long, silky hair disappeared behind the person’s shoulders yet a few errant locks framed the face with a sharp jaw, thin lips, straight nose, narrow and expressive eyes fanned by a fine layer of lashes and under two thick and shapely brows. Heather laid dazed for a few seconds and then closed her eyes thinking it was a dream. Or the afterlife. Was she to be punished by looking after him for all eternity to learn how to be good to him? What was the point of this? She had promised herself that she would be good to her next life’s Husband.</p><p>Or was Death mocking her by sending her her previous Husband?</p><p>“I’m sorry, I woke you up.” His rich and magnetic voice resounded in her whole body and soul, and she opened her eyes only to find his smiling face.</p><p>She choked up and felt how her eyes moistened with tears. She was unaware how much she had yearned this smile of his. It was small, almost imperceptible but it was all for her. He never smiled before others, not even his own family; but for her, he went to the great length of exercising his facial muscles and smile. Before, she had thought it was a mocking smile making fun of her for having fallen in his hands after her family readily sold her to him; yet, she now noticed the smile contained all his love, his gentleness, his willingness to give her everything and more.</p><p>His smile vanished as soon as he saw her on the verge of tears. He flustered and had no idea what to do. He had done so much, begged so much and even almost emptied his vaults just to marry her. He had promised her family he would take care of her, pamper her and let her live like a queen -although her family was more interested in the money he was offering than her well-being. So, seeing her crying made him feel as if he had committed a great sin. They had just married and he was already making her cry; how could he not be flustered?</p><p>He had never heard of a Husband making their Wife cry on the day they married.</p><p>“Are you feeling unwell? Do you want me to call a Healer?” He hurriedly asked looking at her but not daring to touch her to know if she was hurt somewhere, no matter how much he wanted to do it.</p><p>“No,” she croaked. She winced at how horrible her voice sounded but then a glass of water appeared in front of her and she thankfully glanced at the worried man in front of her. Her own hand pressed on his as she led the glass towards her mouth.</p><p>By then she had already realized that it wasn’t a dream. What was happening in front of her was too vivid for it to be a dream, so it had to be true. But, how could that be possible? Her Charms teacher had emphasized that using Time-Turners could only harm more than fix. So, the thought of travelling back to the past was crossed off; there was also the fact she was actually killed. So, then, what could she call her current situation? Rebirth? Reincarnation? Her Soul had travelled across time and space to end up in a reality similar to the one she had lived before?</p><p>Either way, the wish she had made came true. She was back to the day she had gotten married to her Husband. The ceremony had not been big as her family didn’t mind if the wedding was big or not, washing their hands off the matter, and let her decide. She herself wished for the thing to be small and her Husband had respected that. Of course, at that time, she didn’t want to celebrate the fact she was marrying to him so the simpler the thing was, the better for her.</p><p>In fact, they had married in such hurry and secrecy that not even The Prophet wrote about it, when it was normal for the newspaper to gossip about such a high caliber wedding.</p><p>After the quaint ceremony, the two families had had dinner together in which she had gotten drunk to avoid him that she ended up being taken to their room by the House-elves, she hadn’t even cared if her Husband’s family talked bad about her. And just like last time, she had been woken up by her Husband taking care of her drunk self but back then, she had yelled at him for his audacity and practically threw him out of the room. But not this time, this time, she would do things correctly. She had promised that the moment of her death.</p><p>“I… I just had a nightmare.” She whispered, her voice still a little hoarse. She stopped grabbing the hand that held the glass but she didn’t let go of the wrist from his other hand. Even though she had made her mind that everything was real, the fear that it wasn’t still lingered in her mind.</p><p>Her words let his panicked heart settle down and he sighed relieved. He didn’t know what he would do if she got sick. With his worries gone, he finally took a good look at his Wife. She was a dainty and petite woman with a lean body but with all the needed curves. Her pale skin contrasted beautifully with her lush black, curly hair. Her small oval face held a small forehead, two thin eyebrows, thick lashes adorning her emerald eyes, and a button-like nose sat above plump, pink lips that his eyes stared for long seconds. His mouth suddenly dried and his breathing turned heavy.</p><p>“This… bath… I prepared the bath.” He stuttered while trying to control his impulses. The House-elves had been very generous by taking off the voluminous wedding dress and leaving her only with flimsy robes. So, nobody could blame him if he had taken more than one indiscreet look at her body.</p><p>Heather marveled at the sight of her shy Husband. Before, she had been too busy avoiding him and looking at him as if he was her enemy that she had missed these little details about him. In fact, she had never seen this side of him that she wondered if the man in front of her was still her Husband. She could only lament inwardly at her stupidity for separating from such an amazing man but was grateful for the second chance she had been given to make things right.</p><p>She knew he had already taken his bath and was only waiting for her. It had been like that last time. Yet last time, she hadn’t even looked at him before he was already out of the room. Not tonight. Tonight she would consummate their marriage. She decided in her heart.</p><p>“Thanks,” she smiled. And getting out of bed, she slowly moved towards the bathroom, her hips even seductively sashayed for him. Her small act of courage crumbled as soon as she closed the door, though.</p><p>She had forgotten she had never allowed her Husband to touch her and with that other person, she never went beyond a few hugs and kisses so she was still a virgin. Her heart beat like crazy and her face turned red and hot. She spent her whole bath time calming herself down and washing away the pungent smell of alcohol in her body. She successfully managed to do the latter but she was still panicking. However, it would not be good to remain in the room for so long and make him worried or suspicious. After all, she hadn’t been the most enthusiastic person during their wedding and she was sure he had noticed.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she shakily grabbed the robe she had been wearing yet her hand didn’t move further. She knew that if she put it on, then she wouldn’t take it off again with how afraid she was. So, she forced herself to calm down and with a straight back, she made her way out of the bathroom naked. What she didn’t expect was to find him right in front of the door with a hand raised, clearly about to knock. The two froze and looked at each other with wide eyes. His eyes, though, took the chance to rove over her body.</p><p>It seemed the sight was too stimulating for him that his control decided to abandon him as his arms suddenly encircled her body to carry her towards the bed. She squeaked when he pressed her on the mattress and his lips hungrily took hers.</p><p>Their mouths still held the taste of alcohol, making the experience of their first kiss sweet and spicy. He uncontrollably opened and closed his mouth, sucking and licking those plump lips, not even missing the chance to insert his tongue when the opportunity presented. His hand left a hot trail when it slid from her waist up to her round breasts and squeezed them.</p><p>“Mm...” His mind exploded hearing her sweet moan.</p><p>Her squinting, misty eyes looked at him with all kind of emotions, her face was red and her lips were even more so from his recent action. Her breath was labored, alluringly making her breasts jump in a delightful way, making them his next target. As his hand fondled and pinched one of them, his mouth latched onto the other; his tongue drew circles around her nipple to then nip it from time to time.</p><p>“Ah!… Nn...” Heather wanted to tell him to slow down a bit but her mind was too preoccupied with the new sensations her body was experiencing.</p><p>She was taken by surprise by his actions, and she couldn’t keep up with what was going on when her mouth was first being devoured by him. The friction between the two bodies enlightened her as to what was to come; more so, when something hard poked her leg. Anticipation and desire instantly pooled in her lower abdomen.</p><p>She could even feel her lower part throbbing and getting hot already. For a moment, she felt a bit ashamed of her body’s reactions but she had no time to mull on it as her breasts were being squeezed making moans loudly come out from her mouth.</p><p>The string of moans never stopped and even accompanied the noises of sucking and wet kisses he made. He spent a good few minutes licking, sucking and kissing that both her nipples were as hard as pebbles, and her voice had spanned all kind of sounds as her hands were restlessly grabbing the sheets. His mouth stopped playing with her nipples and made its way towards her neck.</p><p>She seriously had no idea her body was so sensitive that even a little bite on her neck elicited a short, breathless scream.</p><p>He darkly chuckled at her reactions and only then she realized her Husband was actually a pervert when he was already in the mood. All traces of his usual taciturnity, small smiles and shyness were gone, he was like a hungry beast ready to attack his prey.</p><p>“You make such beautiful noises.” He purred in her ear. “Let me hear how you will sing if I touch here.”</p><p>Heather was confused for a split second before letting out a startled yelp when she felt his long fingers slide in between her private folds. “This… Haa… I… Ahn!”</p><p>“I just kissed you and touched you a bit and you are this wet already.” He lowly exclaimed showing her the sticky liquid in his fingers after lightly rubbing her.</p><p>“Don’t… Aah!” She wanted to scold him for saying and doing such embarrassing things, but it seemed he was intent on not letting her talk and continued with his teasing. His fingers not only rubbed her but one even went inside her, easily sliding in thanks to her natural lubrication.</p><p>Shlorp! Shlorp!</p><p>“Such lewd noises that come out from there.” He breathed in her ear. “Should I look for that special spot that will let me hear your sweetest voice?” His finger turned and hooked inside.</p><p>“Aah!… There!” She suddenly cried out.</p><p>“You are more honest than I thought, Heather.” He said with gritted teeth. His lone finger was subjected to her tightening and he could already imagine how it would feel when he… “Uhn...” He grunted.</p><p>His other hand gripped his already hard cock to stop himself from tragically spilling on his robe. He wryly chuckled inwardly; from the first time he had seen her and fallen in love with her, she has had this effect on him. He couldn’t last long even when he masturbated thinking of her. The effect only increased as he had her under him, pleasuring her, hearing her melt in moans just from his fingers.</p><p>Her mind blanked but her body moved on its own to the rhythm of his fingers madly fucking her, sometimes his palm even slapped against her clit creating a whole new level of pleasure that continuously built up as her whole body felt hot and taut, leaving her breathless until she snapped.</p><p>“Ah...aahnn...” She let out a long, drawn out moan as her back curved, her toes curled up, and her hands tightly grasped the sheets.</p><p>His fingers slowly came out and he watched with hungry eyes at all the liquid coming out from her and the convulsing entrance. “Well done, my love. Look at how much you came.” He said rising the completely wet hand.</p><p>Heather was panting heavily, her body still twitching and blissed out by the experience that she barely registered his words. She did stare as he slowly took off his robe showing his lean and toned body as well as his leaking cock.</p><p>She couldn’t help her gaze locking onto that particularly ugly yet fascinating part of him. It was big and twitching, the red head was glistening with its own liquid. It was her first time seeing a cock but her empty mind shamelessly came up with one sole thought: she wanted it inside her. The thought frightened her but her body was already agreeing to it.</p><p>“Do you like it?” He asked intently looking at her, at her reaction, and at that quivering part that looked as if it was overflowing in anticipation. He smirked. “Do you want it?” His voice was laced with lust and teasing. His hand, wet from her juices, slowly stroke himself and spread all that wetness on it.</p><p>She shivered seeing such a scene. Was it ok for her to say it? Wouldn’t that be too desperate? “I...”</p><p>“Do you want to know how hot and hard it is? Do you want it filling you? Thrusting in and out of your wet pussy, making you scream and beg for more?” His hand didn’t stop its movements, milking even more liquid out of the hard cock and spreading it all over. He even moved closer and closer to her gaping hole nudging the tip on her clit and teasing it.</p><p>“Nnh… yes...” His words were like sweet honey, enrapturing her and making her agree with whatever he was saying. “Yes… I want it...”</p><p>“Well, then, I will give it to you.” He carefully positioned himself in between her spread legs, nudging and grinding her folds, letting her anticipate it even more until he went in in one swoop.</p><p>Shwap!</p><p>“AH! It hurts!” She cried out almost ripping the bed sheets from how hard she tugged at them.</p><p>She never thought it would hurt this much. She had hoped for some sweet and pleasurable moment yet reality was another that she started to consider pushing him away to make the pain stop. Those thoughts had just formed when she felt fleeting kisses being peppered on her face; her forehead, her closed eyes, her temples, her cheeks, her nose, her chin, her lips.</p><p>“What are you doing?” She feebly asked, still enduring the pain that felt as if she was split in two.</p><p>“Taking the pain away.” He simply replied, not stopping his ministrations. He even massaged her hips and legs but being careful not to move around. The extremely close distance between their bodies allowed him to feel her stiffened self from the pain and he inwardly apologized for it.</p><p>Her expression suddenly turned complicated as it wasn’t the first time he had said that. In her previous life, she had not only tried her best to hide from him but also ran away whenever he was close. Once, she suddenly bumped into him when she was distracted and fell to the ground. She had twisted her wrist that time, and he had nervously helped her up. He had no idea what to do and only took her hand to his lips to relieve the ache. She had felt revolted by his action and quickly retrieved her hand from his clutches. She had run away from him after that.</p><p>But now she could just feel sweetness filling her heart. She had been so blind before, that all acts of love and gentleness from him were mocking and disgusting to her. Now, she only felt disgusted by her hurtful actions towards him.</p><p>Her arms circled his neck, halting his efforts. “Move.” What was a bit of pain compared to how miserable she made him in her previous life? If he wanted to hurt her, then it would be what she deserved for being a horrible person. This pain, she would bear it.</p><p>Yet what she expected never came. There was soreness as he started to move his hips with care, as if hesitating. Yet his slow and probing movements allowed her to feel his hot cock sliding in and out, rubbing everything inside. Soon the soreness disappeared to be replaced by the pleasure she had been waiting for and with it, her voice also descended into alluring mewls as her body trembled. Until...</p><p>“Mnn… Yes! Right there!”</p><p>She gasped tightly grasping his hair and shoulders as she subconsciously rubbed herself against him to feel that pleasure again. He devilishly smirked hearing her wanton voice right by his ear. His hips, having remembered the exact angle, continued hitting that spot.</p><p>Slap! Shwap! Slap! Creak!</p><p>“Uhn… you feel so good inside. So hot.” He incoherently spoke, his pace picking up as she moaned and yelled her pleasure. His hips made loud noises when they bumped against her ass, and the bed groaned and moved to the rhythm of their actions. “Does it feel good? Do you feel good, Heather?” He panted by her ear, his mouth nipping and biting her neck, tasting and enjoying the salty sweat in it.</p><p>“Haa… yeah, it’s good… ah! So good...” She cried out, her body already giving her the signs of her second orgasm. She subconsciously tightened up her hold on him, her legs wrapping around his waist making him slide even deeper. “I’m… I… Aaah!” She tightened and screamed, her nails embedding themselves on his shoulders.</p><p>“Oh, fuck, that’s too tight.” He growled, his hips erratically moved as he enjoyed that grip her pussy had on his cock. His hand loosened one of her legs from its hold on his waist and lifted it to give him more space. “You’re so good, so good, uhn!” He grunted and finally slowed down his thrusts to spurt all his seed inside her, still riding the end of her own orgasm to milk down even the last drop in him.</p><p>“Nn...” Heather was coming down from her high delirium when something hot filled her down there. She could clearly feel how it spread all around and she had to admit it was sexy as hell. She never had any kink as it was her first time but she knew she wanted to experience it time and time again together with him.</p><p>Both were happily panting and indulging in the afterglow of their first time, still tightly holding each other. He was extremely delighted to know the little woman he had loved for so long was now completely his. She not only was his Wife but he also owned her body, she was already marked by him. He wasn’t naive to believe he had her heart as she had never interacted with him before their wedding. But it didn’t matter. He had time to make her fall in love with him; slowly and deep. Just like how he loves her.</p><p>“I will one day make you love me, Heather, my Wife, my everything, you are mine now.” He told her with a voice full of all his love. What he felt for her was so much that it was a nightmare not having her before getting married. He had to wait for so long, until she finished her studies, so he could propose marriage. But the wait was worth it. </p><p>Unfortunately, the woman in his arms had already gone to dreamland and couldn’t reply. He wasn’t discouraged, though. Their first time had been short yet electrifying, much more for her since she was a virgin. He confirmed it when he cleaned her and saw the traces of blood coming out together with her juices and his cum; not that he cared if she wasn’t pure anymore. Although it would have disappointed him greatly, it wouldn’t have spoiled the fact she was his from now on, and only he would have the right to pleasure her, tear screams from her while she orgasmed, and hear her ask for more.</p><p>His cock once again rose to the imaginary stimulus but he behaved and just hugged her, his nose filled with her smell and his hands indulgently caressed her supple skin. His mind revolved around one thought that had been plaguing him the whole day: <em>Finally, I finally have her.</em></p><p>Heather Potter was finally his, Rabastan Lestrange’s, Wife.</p><p> </p>
