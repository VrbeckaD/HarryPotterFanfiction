    <p>Alex Crest had never been a lucky girl. She had a lovely family, with the usual annoying siblings. Her family wasn’t the problem.</p><p>No, her problem was that she’d just... always had a hard time finding happiness.</p><p>She had good grades and was smart, but it had led her to be disliked by her fellow classmates, which had left her lacking friends. She had actually had a friend once when she was 12 years old, but two years later they were separated as they went to different high-schools.<br/> She wasn't pretty, or especially interesting, hence her lack of boyfriend.</p><p>As such, books and family had been the only thing to help her keep going, and she grew up to be a responsible young woman. At 23, she was studying science with the goal to become a renown researcher. She didn't have a boyfriend, and had given up on her dream of having any children a long time ago. She was okay with being alone;it would be less of a hindrance to her life and work.</p><p>And now, she was at the table of a random café, waiting for the crepes she had ordered.</p><p>The waitress arrived after close to ten minutes of waiting, with her crepes and a coffee she hadn’t ordered.</p><p>"On the house,” she said as she put the cup of coffee on the table, her eyes twinkling. “It's magic."</p><p>Intrigued by the waitress' last sentence, she inspected her coffee, not sure what was in there. But well, it was free, so with a great deal of courage, she drank the whole cup in one try, glad that there was enough sugar and milk.</p><p>She was less glad that there was something else in it. It had a faint taste of lemon, but it was definitely more than that; As soon as she had finished her cup, she began to feel dizzy, the world spinning around her.</p><p>...</p><p>I woke up with a groan, feeling like someone was hitting my head with a hammer. <em>Hard</em>. </p><p>I slowly got up, massaging my temples, and when I opened my eyes, couldn't quite believe where I was.</p><p>I seemed to be in some sort of office. An original one though. Everywhere there were books, on shelves, but also on the desk, on chairs, and even on the ground. Pieces of parchment were scattered too, and there was even a huge exotic bird quietly sitting on an armchair. What was even more spectacular though, were the paper animals flying everywhere, the drops of water floating in <em>air</em>, the hourglasses that had sand actually going <em>up</em> rather than down, and the multiples jar labeled "sparkles" or "lemon drop". Actually, that last one wasn't that weird given the fact that, being a lemon lover myself, I had several identical jar in my room.</p><p><em>What the hell? </em>I thought weakly.</p><p>I tried to retrace my step from the last few hours, and was distressed to realise that the last thing I could recall was drinking the free coffee. </p><p>
  <em>Damn, what was in that coffee?</em>
</p><p>I started to panic, wondering why I was here, and began imagining all the worst-case scenario I could think of.</p><p>Had I been drugged and brought to this place? But why? And why such a weird office?! Maybe I was actually looking too much into it, and had just fainted in the coffee shop and was brought here? But why not a hospital?!</p><p><em>That's it!</em> I thought as I finally realized what had happened to me. Well, really, no need to go imagine that I had been kidnapped by aliens. It was simple, really. I obviously ended up here by my own volition, and had somehow hurt my head and had a loss of memory, probably temporary amnesia as I didn't seem hurt too badly.</p><p>I tentatively touched my head, looking for an injury, and was glad I couldn't find anything. That meant I wasn't hurt too bad.</p><p>I stood up to call for someone -whom didn't matter- and tell them I was alright, no need to call for an ambulance, when I suddenly realized something.</p><p>Everything seemed too <em>big. </em>Like, a lot, as if I was in a room inhabited by giants.</p><p><em>Maybe I've been abducted by aliens after all, </em>I thought as I gulped with a bit of effort.</p><p>But the worst realization hadn't come yet. I looked down at my own body and discovered that I wasn't 23 anymore. Instead, before my very eyes was the body of an approximately 10 years old child, wearing some weird robes and school uniform.</p><p>At that, my head got suddenly very dizzy, and I had to lean on the closest chair's armrest not to fall down as my legs suddenly seemed intent to do.</p><p>I took deep, slow breath, remembering what I had been taught to do during panic attacks, and did so until blood had stopped rushing to my ears and I had regained some of my vision.</p><p>Once I had regained my balance, I sat down on the chair and let out a trembling sigh.</p><p><em>It's a nightmare. It all is. There's, like, no other rational solution. One does </em>not<em> go back to ten in the space of an hour. That's not possible.</em></p><p>I jumped in surprise as I heard the door behind me open, and tried not to panic again. Two panic attacks in a row was dangerous, and I wouldn't let my emotions get the better of me twice.</p><p>I turned in the chair, not trusting my(?) body to support me, and let my eyes fall on an old man with a long, white beard, wearing half-moon glasses and what could only be qualified as robes. These were colored in various shades of greens and browns, as was the hat on his head.</p><p>At his side was a middle-aged woman with a strict bun that was tucked into a pointier black hat, and wore less impressive dark-brown robes. She had quite a severe air, though when her eyes rested on me, she seemed to soften a little.</p><p>"Ah, Miss Crest, I'm glad that you woke up. You are still a bit white though." She said as her lips slightly tightened, as if in disapproval of my health. "I hope you feel better than you look."</p><p>
  <em>How does she know my name?</em>
</p><p>"I'm-I'm fine, thank you." I said, seeing an opportunity to gain some explanations. "I, uh... Do you know what happened to me? Where I am maybe? I mean, I'm pretty sure that I shouldn't be here, I don't recall..."</p><p>"Ah, don't worry, Miss Crest, I shall explain the situation," said the old man. "I'm Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts’s headmaster, and you're in my office. You fainted earlier and you were quite close to my room, which is why I  brought you here. I had planned to call for Miss Pomfrey, the nurse, but then I sensed that you had awoken. So, if you feel up to it, maybe we can go to the entrance ceremony?" He asked with twinkling eyes, and a delighted air. "I quite like to see the repartition, it is most entertaining. And well, you have to get sorted too, don't you?"</p><p>To that, I had to sit back down. </p><p>I... had seemingly been abducted not by aliens, but by a band of mad people. </p><p>
  <em>How do you explain the sudden youth then?</em>
</p><p>I closed my eyes, fighting of the scream that was rising in my throat, obviously wanting to echo the one that seemed to dominate my thoughts.</p><p>I stayed like that for a few seconds, and when I looked back to my uniform, it did have a blank blazon on it, as if it wasn't completed yet.</p><p>Well, if they were crazy, I only had to play along with it until I could find a way out, and I would hopefully find a way to deal with the whole "I'm back to being ten years old business" along the way.</p><p>"Yeah, sure, I can't wait to be sorted already," I said in an overly cheerful voice to ‘Dumbledore’ and the one whom I had understood to be, ahem, ‘McGonagall’.</p><p>"Perfect, let's hurry then, we mustn't be late. Really, it's a good thing you didn't follow Hagrid as you were ordered earlier. He would probably have let you drown if you had fainted while in the boats, saying that the giant squid is completely harmless,” said 'McGonagall' as she walked out of the room. I couldn't decide if her tone was more reproachful when saying I hadn't obeyed -never mind that I have absolutely no recollection of it- or when denouncing Hagrid's carelessness.</p><p>I swiftly followed after her and the "headmaster" (more like leader of the crazy sect) and couldn't quite hold back a gasp as I saw the hallways.</p><p>The office was impressive, but it was nothing when gazing into a <em>moving stairway.</em></p><p>Everywhere were talking portraits that seemed to interact with Dumbledore and McGonagall, and me, and I had absolutely no idea how on earth they did that; the stairways kept on moving here and there, always rotating, never ending in their movement; and the ornamentations were just- just- so wonderful and amazing that they became indescribable. They were so delicate with their small spirales, sometimes harsh turn, smooth landforms whose eyes seemed to follow you, sometimes even smile, and extremely small changes in the colors' shades, so small that you could barely notice them, and that yet were so amazing in all their nuances...</p><p>
  <em>Maybe there is something to gain from their craziness after all?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Or maybe whatever they drugged me with has strange side effects. That seems more plausible.</em>
</p><p>I was startled out of my musings when I almost collided with McGonagall's back. We had arrived to the Great Hall, and Dumbledore was nowhere in sight. I had been so focused upon the decorations that I didn't notice him leaving.</p><p>I mentally chided myself for my lack of focus and paled a little as I saw all the children in front of the Great Hall.</p><p>Were they all like me, normal people who had somehow been torn from their normal lives to play a role in these mad people's fantasy? Obviously not, as they were all jumping with enthusiasm, talking about the coming year and wondering about how the Great Hall would be, hardly holding in the little screech of joy.</p><p>I... wasn't quite waiting for that. Nor was I at ease with it. I had been alone for the past 5 years, and was not used to be around children.Were these kids children of other mad people who had raised them to be as mad as them? </p><p>Hopefully, maybe there would be one person like me with whom I could forge an alliance to get out of this.</p><p>The small crowd suddenly quieted, and the huge doors slowly opened.</p><p>And I was back to gawking.</p><p>
  <em>I had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles which were floating in mid-air over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the Hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. I looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the room didn't simply open on to the heaven.</em>
</p><p>I couldn't stop looking, and barely heard my name when I was called out, which unfortunately happened quite fats as I was one of the first names on the list.</p><p>I slowly started to walk toward the stool where awaited an old patched hat that had a mouth which it had just used to sing, and I felt apprehension rising in my throat.</p><p>
  <em>This is not real. They're just all crazy, all this is fake.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They are only so many things you can call fake before you realize they're real.</em>
</p><p>As I reached the stool, I slowly sat down, not finding it in me to smile, and -reluctantly- put the hat on.</p><p>
  <b>So... Alex. You seem like a mature child, aren't you?</b>
</p><p>I couldn't quite hold back a shiver as I resisted the strong urge to throw the hat and run away, yelling, and took long, slow breath.</p><p>
  <b>Now, now, no need to be scared child, I don't bite.</b>
</p><p><em>Just, just a sec. Please. I uh... Need to bring my brain back. </em>I replied awkwardly, trying really hard not to throw the damn thing off of my head and on McGonagall.</p><p>
  <b>Hmm... I'll try not to take offence at being called a 'damn thing' and go back to your sorting instead. Well now, you're quite hard to place... Yes indeed, very hard. You don't really have any spectacular qualities, at least none that overpowers the others.</b>
</p><p><em>Thanks for reminding me of how ordinary I am,</em> I shot bitterly. Hey, I was getting better at this. Guess you could get used to weirdness.</p><p>
  <b>You shouldn't really be offended by being ordinary. You're only eleven after all, you still have time to develop.</b>
</p><p>I suppressed a cringe as I thought that even if I was 23 I still had a character as developed as an 11 year old child. This was pretty embarrassing.</p><p>
  <b>What do you mean 23?! You-... How, how is that possible?! I- In all my centuries of service, this is the first time I... No, not the first time, but still, how is that possible? I was told that he would be the only one... And you don't even seem to be aware!</b>
</p><p><em>What do you mean aware?! </em>I startled.<em> Do you know anything of what happened to me? I- All this, is it real? </em></p><p>
  <b>I, I don't think I can tell you, I am sincerely sorry, but it might cause trouble if I do. This... would not be wise. I'm sorry, I </b>
  <em>
    <strong>cannot</strong>
  </em>
  <b> tell you!</b>
</p><p>
  <em>But, you can't leave me in the dark, you can't-</em>
</p><p>"GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>
  <em>No! No, you can't, you must answer me! Just tell me, please!</em>
</p><p>I never received a replied. McGonagall took the hat off my head before I could get it. </p><p>Less than a minute ago, I would have given anything to get the hat off my head.</p><p>Now I would have done anything to get it back on.</p><p>I numbly joined the Gryffindor's tables, not hearing the applause, not seeing the smiles, not feeling the rush the other students felt.</p><p>I just... tried not to yell. From the pain, from the anger, from the <em>frustration</em>.</p><p>I sat down at a free seat at the end of the table and distantly followed the sorting. </p><p>I kept thinking about the huge load of trouble I was in. I shot a quick glance around the room and saw that a bushy brown haired girl was sitting not too far from me, and two red-haired twins were a few seats farther. I recognized Hermione Granger and the Weasley twins, though I couldn't spot Ron or Harry anywhere.</p><p>A quick look among the first years that hadn't been sorted yet revealed a red-haired girl that pointedly didn't look at the twins. That must be Ginny.</p><p>
  <em>Well, that places me in the second year then. Is it 1982 in the book? Wait, no, most probably 1992. Yeah, I think that's it. 1992. I'm in 1992.</em>
</p><p>I had jumped 25 years backward. 25 years.</p><p>I wasn't even born yet.</p><p>I tried to hold back my tears as I suddenly realized everything I had left behind me, my life, my family, my friends, and quickly diverted myself from this dangerous line of thoughts.</p><p>If I remembered correctly, then the whole deal with Voldemort coming back to life and creating havoc everywhere in his path wouldn't happen before at least two years.</p><p>This should give me enough time to leave this place, right? </p><p>
  <em>And abandon all these people to a horrible death?</em>
</p><p>No. Yes. Maybe. It wasn't my world! It wasn't my life! They- they were all fictional characters! Why should I worry about them?!</p><p>
  <em>Because they might be real.</em>
</p><p>I held back a whimper as I saw that I had no easy way out of this, and was thankfully startled out of my thoughts as I heard applause rising from everywhere. Obviously, Dumbledore had finished his welcoming speech.</p><p>I considered for a few moments eating something, but I felt a churning in my gut as I did, so I instead went to an upper year to ask to leave.</p><p>They directed me toward a prefect who grudgingly took me to the common room, and as soon as that was done rushed back to the Great Hall to enjoy the festivities.</p><p>At last, I was alone. Finally. I went to the first year dorm I had been shown, and found myself not knowing which of the beds was mine. None of these trunks reminded me of anything.</p><p>This time, I did let out a cry of frustration as I understood I would have to crouch to check the name on each of those trunks to see which was mine. And I better have one I would kill someone and steal their things.</p><p>I began with the first on my left –still slightly grumbling –  and was pleased to see I wouldn't have to rummage through those luggage as the name "Nathalie Frusher" could be read. Probably the best news of the day. I inspected the three trunks one after the other, and arriving at the bed close to the wall, I saw that a name was written on the trunk's handle, and thank the heavens, it was mine.</p><p>I opened it, and saw a few of my childhood's stuff, such as my stuffed bunny or even a dress I had never worn, not finding the occasion to do so. I also found some stuff I had been given long after my eleventh anniversary, but I dismissed it all as I saw the little note attached to the handle:</p><p>
  <em>Alex.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I think you ought to know why you're here. Still, I cannot tell you what it is as you have to make your own way in this world, and never should you receive my help or hear about me again. You have to accept that if you are here, it is because you have been given a second chance, and if you succeed you will be able to rejoin us. But I've already said too much. So, I will wish you good luck Alex. I hope you will succeed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>- A friend.</em>
</p><p>To say that I was confused was a huge understatement. But I was tired, and if there was one thing I didn't want to do it was thinking too hard. And even if I had, I probably wouldn't have been able to do it.</p><p>So, I changed, not bothering to unpack my things yet, held my bunny tight to my chest, and finally let go of the tears that had been threatening to spill out since the start of the evening.</p><p>I had lost everything.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
