    <p dir="ltr">Remus Lupin was not rich. Neither was his family. That was why he had to do this, he reminded himself, raising his hand to knock on the door.</p><p>He had been in a car accident, once, when he had been really young, and he knew that took quite the toll on his parents. He had seen the photos of before. His father, already with wrinkles, but this time most of them were from smiling. His mother, her hair loose, and so, so very carefree. Himself, but not a self he recognized, a self without scars and with young eyes. All so happy</p><p>And of course they hadn't been very rich then either, but they had had more than enough, hadn't they? His parents hadn't yet spend all their money and happiness on some stupid sick boy.</p><p>The photos of before weren't the only ones he'd seen. He'd seen the pictures of during too, although they were few and far between, something he understood. (Hospitals don't make the best backgrounds)</p><p>Remus was pretty sure one photo had captured the exact moment Hope Lupin got her ever-present "Are you okay, Remus?" look. (They had just heard his wounds had gotten infected) He had spent quite some time looking at that photo. Whenever he felt bad and closed his eyes it was on the back of his eyelids, so that he could feel even worse.</p><p>He sometimes wondered why someone would take a picture of something like that. Why would anyone want to remember the way his parents had sat next to his bed, both holding on to one of his hands like <em>they </em>were the ones that needed to be saved? Why would anyone want to remember that you couldn't even see their faces in that moment, because they were looking down with grief? Why would anyone want to remember that somehow, not being able to see their faces hurt worse?</p><p>He'd asked his parents, once. They had answered, in a way that was happy and sad and not at all lighthearted, although not for lack of trying, "We realized we didn't have enough pictures of you."</p><p>He loved his parents, he really, really did. So this summer, now that he was back from Hogwarts, he'd work and help out a little. And, seeing as the bookstore he usually helped out in the summer wouldn't have him, he knocked on the door.</p><p>He didn't knock with too much force though, it didn't look very sturdy. The paint was starting to come off, and there was an old, faded flyer on it.</p><p>The flyer had probably once been full of bright colours, but now it seemed as dull as everything else there, with only the words "<em>Mad-Eye Moody, THE clown to get you in a better mood</em>!" setting it apart.</p><p>It was only when Remus heard weird-sounding footsteps coming his way that he realized he was standing in a shady neighbourhood, standing before a shady door, in reply to a very shady ad. (Was it too late too turn around?)</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Remus hesitated for a moment. The face that had emerged wasn't what he'd expected. It was full of scars, and was that a <em>fak</em><em>e eye?</em></p><p>His dad had once told him that his scars weren't ugly, and that it was all about what lay beneath, but Remus didn't think it was possible to see what skin lay beneath when someone had this much scars. (Although his dad had probably been talking about some more metaphorical "beneath")</p><p>James and Sirius would probably be fascinated by them, and ask Moody all about them (that was what they'd done with Remus' scars, at least). Remus himself... realized he'd been staring without answering the question.</p><p>"My name is Remus Lupin, sir. I'm here because of the ad you posted."</p><p>Miraculously he managed to not make the last part sound like a question, lest it became apparent that he sincerely doubted that this man was a clown.</p><p>"Come in", Moody said brusquely, and turned around, not even waiting for something like an answer. Remus followed him. (He had this habit of following questionable people, as proved by his choice of friends)</p><p>Remus finally figured out why the footsteps had sounded unusual when a wooden leg cought his eye. The leg stopped walking through the hallway, and Moody got out his keys to open the lock of a door that seemed to lead to a living room.</p><p>There was a sofa in the room, and a big chair, both covered in books, pens, mugs and flards of paper. He caught sight of one paper with the headline, in bolt letters:<strong> B. CROUCH STILL ON THE RUN. HOW COULD IT EVER COME THIS FAR?</strong>. The floor was just as messy, but Moody walked in confidently, narrowly avoiding a lego block that really had no reason to be there.</p><p>And Remus, still baffled by the fact that someone would put a lock on their <em>living room, </em>relocated some of the mess, and sat down.</p><p>"So", Remus said, "You need an assistant?"</p><p>Those were the wrong words entirely, because Moody's eyes flickered to his lighning fast, old scars catching the light in new ways, and said: "I don't <em>need </em>anything."</p><p>And Remus, as opposed to this guy, <em>did</em> need something. A job. So he used the voice that he usually reserved for when James and Sirius were fighting, to say: "Of course not. But it might be nice to have someone to..." (and Remus remembered the locks on all the doors, the thorough glare that had been thrown at him and the baseball bat that was strategically placed next to the door) "watch your back, no?"</p><p>Moody threw his head back and laughed, one Ha! as sharp and sudden as this whole encounter had been. "Another back to watch, more like. I don't trust you, kid. Don't take it personal, I don't trust anyone. You should too."</p><p>Remus had to bite his tongue to hold back the : "Then I shouldn't trust this advice either". Instead he said: "If you say so."</p><p>"I do. But I could use an assistant. You'd just have to plan my appointments, maybe clean stuff up a bit, and help if I need it."</p><p>"So I won't ever have to be a clown myself?" Remus tone was probably a bit too relieved to use in front of someone who was, in fact, a clown, but Moody didn't seem to mind.</p><p>Another one of those sudden laughs. "Of course not, that would be ridiculous!"</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em>This is ridiculous,</em> Remus thinks, applying the make-up on himself for a change.</p><p align="left">Mad-Eye watches him like it's his first time putting it on (and, of course, technically speaken it's the first time he puts it on <em>himself</em>, but still). Unlike the first time Moody says, in a low and strangely unguarded manner for such a guarded man: "Good stuff huh? Hides the, the scars."</p><p align="left">(Remus thinks it's impossible to see all Mad-Eye's scars without seeing some things he definitely doesn't want to see, but somehow he feels like he has seen some more of them, now)</p><p align="left">"CONSTANT VIGILANCE", Moody shouted then, as if even that tiny bit of vulnerability had been too much, but Remus had gotten so used to that habit over the weeks that he didn't even waver.</p><p align="left">"Kid."</p><p align="left">"Yeah?"</p><p align="left">"You're applying <em>my</em> make-up."</p><p align="left">"No I'm not. I didn't know <em>both</em> of your eyes were fake."</p><p align="left">"Spare me he sass boy, you know what I mean."</p><p align="left">A silence fell.</p><p align="left">"I do not, actually."</p><p align="left">Mad-Eye sighed. "You are applying it in the same way you do mine. And unless you have a fake eye, and need to draw attention to that as a part of your act, I would do it differently."</p><p align="left">"How then?"</p><p align="left">Mad-Eye shrugged. "How should I know? I just used a nickname."</p><p align="left">A nickname. Remus had one of those, but wouldn't a moon be a little too obvious? Although, he wasn't planning on ever letting his friends see him as a clown.</p><p align="left">He started drawing a moon on one of his cheeks, and then, deciding to indulge himself, drew a few stars on the other one</p><p> </p>
