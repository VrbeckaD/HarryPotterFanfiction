I did break into Snape’s mind even if it was the one time. He probably puts all the order meetings and all the stuff they don’t want me to know in that pensieve in in case I manage to break into his mind again.<br/>I don’t trust  Dumbledore, I don’t trust anyone. But maybe if I have an idea what’s going on I’ll at least know who I can trust.’<br/>   Mind made up Harry strode across the room and deliberately entered the pensive.<br/>He had no way to know what he would see would completely change his life.<br/>Both for the worse and for the better.</p>
