    <p>Harry made his escape, with Luna's help after everything had ended. He threw his cloak over his shoulders, and started off towards the Gryffindor Common Room, since the tower looked to be in relatively good shape. </p><p>The cloak was good for covering Harry. He was so short, he had never outgrown it. It was actually just a bit too big, dragging the ground by a few inches. Ron on the other hand, was way too tall for the cloak. He had to slouch, as his ankles would show otherwise. Hermione, though,was just perfect, hitting between the two height-wise. </p><p>Hermione wouldn't have had to slouch wearing it, but more importantly, Hermione wouldn't have been walking around Hogwarts, which on it's best days was tricky to navigate, trailing several inches of invisible fabric. Today was no where near Hogwarts best days. </p><p>Harry had to make his way around large bits of stone from errant bombardas and climb over fallen statues who lay collapsed from their defense of the school. He had to dodge people frantically looking for missing loved ones or trying to move the fallen bits around, to make accessible pathways to the stairs, and there were still rouge plants and animals around the school that needed to be corralled. </p><p>And Harry Potter was trying to navigate all this, invisible, while trailing several inches of fabric no one else could see. </p><p>It came to no surprise to Harry that he was knocked into by something. What did surprise him though, was when he was free falling through the air. No one came to save him with a well placed arresto momentum or a cushioning charm. No one tried to catch him on a broom. No one did anything, because no one could see him. </p><p>Harry fell off the stairs he had been climbing, through the damaged railing, into the air, and down two and three-fourths flights of stairs. He landed in a heap on the floor, still covered by his invisibility cloak, and was never found.</p>
