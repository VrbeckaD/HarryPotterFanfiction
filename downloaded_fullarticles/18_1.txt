  <p>Harry knows Draco loves all things pretty and shiny, that posh little git. But he didn't think it would ever come to this.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Honestly, Harry didn't expect many things to happen in his already very eventful life—one of them is befriending the one and only Draco fucking Malfoy. And here he is, sharing a flat with his ex nemesis because <em>oh, we're both aurors now it's just convenient, don't you think?</em></p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry refuses to take the blame, though, because they got along surprisingly well after recovering from the fact that both were only victims of an evil war none of them ever asked. Draco is still a snarky, sarcastic wanker, but an extremely interesting one at that. He's genuinely funny, intelligent, and always curious about things he doesn't know.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>And with him being raised in a traditional pureblood family, he does have a whole lot of muggle world to discover.</p>
  <p> </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>It started when Draco came home from his work trip to the US on an international wizarding case.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Harry, do you know what a beauty guru is?" Draco asked him out of nowhere.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry frowned at him from where he sat on the couch. "Isn't that a muggle term for experts in makeup? Why you asked?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Well," Draco gingerly sat down to join him. "I went undercover as a muggle when I was in the US. A girl said my hair reminds her of Jeffree Star. When I asked her who that was, she only said he's a beauty guru." Draco explained with a shrug. "She gave me an impression that I should've known him, though. Is he famous?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry stared at his hair for a moment. His shoulder length, white blonde hair which fell so naturally around his pointy face. He once asked Draco why he grew his hair so long and <em>wouldn't it be too noticable for an auror?</em> That twit only rebuked with <em>let's have a discussion when your own hair isn't attracting birds from all around England, mop head</em>.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Logically, you couldn't have known him," Harry said eventually. "I might have heard of the name, but I'm not sure."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Can we look up his name? On that ghoul internet thing?" Draco looked up at him expectantly.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"It's goo-gle, Draco, and yes, I guess we can," Harry said and left to find his laptop because Draco would not shut up until his unending curiosity is satisfied.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>And that's why Harry and Draco sat shoulder to shoulder on the couch watching a YouTube video that evening. Draco seemed to be very fascinated, asking Harry about all foreign icons on the website (<em>what do you mean we don't get owls if we subscribed to this?</em>). When the video started, he became even more unbearably annoying, pausing every ten seconds to ask questions Harry couldn't answer.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What is a concealer, Harry? What will it conceal?" Draco asked after pausing the video for the 14th time—and they're only two minutes in.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry gave a long suffering sigh. "I don't know, Draco, do I look like someone who wears makeup?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Draco shrugged unapologetically but decided to remain silent for the rest of the video. When it finally ended, he looked at Harry with a thoughtful expression.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"You know what?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry arced his eyebrow. "What?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I think my hair is better than his," Draco replied solemnly.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry had to laugh at that. "That you are right."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Draco gave him a satisfied smirk, but an unreadable glint of his eyes told Harry that something else was afoot.</p>
  <p> </p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>A couple of weeks later, Harry has been thinking that there's something different from Draco. Subtle, but Harry notices nonetheless. And that's <em>definitely</em> not because he pays too much attention to the man. Definitely not.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>He comes to a realization today. They are sitting across each other in a cafe for their lunch break when Harry finally realizes.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Draco is <em>shining</em>.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p><em>More than usual</em>, his thought offered helpfully.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry stares hard at the blond's face and his gaze inevitably focuses on his thin, shiny lips. No, it's not shiny, it's <em>glossy</em>. Draco applied lipgloss on his lips. Of course he did.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"What?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>From the tone, Harry assumes Draco is lifting a single eyebrow in question, like he always does in a very captivating way. But Harry can't tell because his eyes are locked to the movement of those pretty, glossy lips.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Those lips are moving again, likely to scoff Harry in annoyance for not answering, but then a waiter comes to their table and places their order. Draco looks away to face the waiter and say his polite thank you, and then suddenly another shine catches Harry's attention.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>The way Draco angles his face slightly makes the afternoon sunlight from the glass wall fall softly on his cheek. And his high, well-defined cheekbone is fucking <em>shining</em>. The glow is not blinding or anything, but it's certainly unmistakable. Especially now when Draco grins at the small banter he's having with the waiter. His cheekbone is raised with all its shining glory.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>When the waiter leaves and Draco looks back at Harry, still dumbfounded, he frowns. "Seriously, Harry, what's wrong?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry is losing it. "You're shining," he whispers.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Draco tilts his head in confusion. And the light catches both his cheekbone and lips, making them shining as if challenging Harry. "Huh?"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"I said," Harry said while his fingers reach out to touch that shiny cheekbone. He definitely lost it. "You're fucking <em>shining</em>, Draco."</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Draco's frown deepens for a second before he breaks into a brilliant smirk in understanding. Brightening his already glowing little pointy face. "Oh, you mean—"</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Harry doesn't let him finish as he captures those glossy lips with his own. <em>They're softer than they look</em>, Harry thinks absently. <em>And, Merlin's beard, they're so fucking sweet. Like candies and chocolates and a hint of fruits</em>. Maybe that's the lipgloss. Or maybe that's just Draco.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>Maybe that's just the shiny Draco Malfoy.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>They let go of the magical moment and Draco bursts into a loud, bubbly laugh. Harry can only stare with an awestruck expression.</p>
</div><div class="">
  <p>"Salazar, Harry," he says, eyes glinting fiercely with mirth, slight surprise, and pure delight. "If I knew that a bit of highlighter and lipgloss is all it takes to seduce you, I'd have put them on much sooner."</p>
