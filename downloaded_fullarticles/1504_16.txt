          <div class="userstuff"><p>The anonymous Hogwarts Instant Messaging site has been up for the past week. No one knows who is monitoring it and no one knows who each other is since every communication is made in codename. People can act out of their stature with this, and no one will be the wiser. Houses can befriend one another more fluently with this application. It has helped to bring the students of Hogwarts closer together.</p><p>

</p><p>Three-and-a-half hours later, the students climb down from their cubbies to the Great Hall. It is time to endure supper. Before the meal begins, Dumbledore stands and calls on four students from each house. <em>Hufflepuff</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Diggory. How are you liking our messaging boards?"</p><p> </p><p>"They're great, Sir. It really helps to know the anonymous vote."</p><p> </p><p>"Very good." <em>Ravenclaw</em>. "Miss Lovegood. How is social media for you?"</p><p> </p><p>"I love talking with all these people even though I don't know who they are. If we knew each other face to face, it's possible we could come to a duel."</p><p> </p><p>"I see. Excellent point." <em>Gryffindor</em>. "Mr. Potter. How have you come around this?"</p><p> </p><p>"I like learning about people where they don't treat me differently because of my status, if we're being honest here, Sir."</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes. Status makes things very different." <em>Slytherin</em>. "Mr. Malfoy. How have things been on your end?"</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I suppose, Sir. I don't have a lot to say to people I don't know, and people mostly talk about muggle moving pictures or whatever. But it's alright, I suppose."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for your honesty." His eye twinkles. "Now, let's feast!"</p></div>
