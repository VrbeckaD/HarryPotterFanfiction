  <em>And the quill of acceptance rises out of the inkpot and attempts to inscribe said name into the book of admittance. However, should the book not sense a significant enough magical occurrence it will snap shut.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">The voice of Professor Binns droned on and the students fought to keep their eyes open. Slytherins and Hufflepuffs alike drooped lower and lower. All except Mary, she sat straight up, quill poised above the paper, with a look of intense concentration on her face. Suddenly, her hand shot straight up in the air.</p>
<p align="left">No one noticed</p>
<p align="left">The students didn’t because they were in a near stupor. Professor Binns didn’t because never in his 84 years of teaching had any student EVER raised their hand. “Professor Binns” she said in a loud crisp voice. He stopped mid-sentence and scowled over his glasses. “Professor Binns” she repeated “The quill of acceptance, you said that it detects all flares of magic? But the book of admittance only notes down students who are of sufficient magical ability to go to Hogwarts?”</p>
<p align="left">“Yes” he answered shortly “Now, as I was saying”</p>
<p align="left">“Professor Binns” she cut in again, “What about muggle children? Does the quill distinguish between wizarding and muggle children&gt; Are there procedures in place for identifying muggle children who exhibit magic and coordinating with a wizard representative?”</p>
<p align="left">“Hmph” a low voice spoke from the back of the room “You want to identify all the muggles, Slytherin? Why’s that so you can keep watch on them and make sure they don’t come near any pureblood institutions”</p>
<p align="left">Mary turned around sharply “I would think that it would be in the best interest of the child if a member of the wizarding community was aware of their abilities. To prevent unnecessary damage or a mislabeling of mental instability or intentional mischief making. But go ahead, keep making your biased assumptions about my house.”</p>
<p align="left">Now everyone was wide awake. Their eyes flicked between Mary and Professor Binns as she calmly kept eye contact and waited for his answer. “Ms. Poppins” he said in a somewhat exasperated tone “The quill of acceptance is a magical instrument, enchanted to provide a specific service to the school. It senses magic, it attempts to write the name. The book of admittance distinguishes the level of magic exhibited and allows to be written down those names that meet the criteria set forth by our past headmasters. These names are then used to inform students when they are of age to begin their schooling. That is all. NOW, where was I?”</p>
<p align="left">He picked up his place in the text and continued his lecture, the students once again sliding into a stupor. “I’ll take that as a no” Mary said icily to herself, jotting a few things down with her quill and ignoring the professor at the front of the room.</p>
