    <p>Lily Luna Potter was your average eleven year old witch. She had bright red hair, hazel eyes, a multitude of freckles, and a plump figure. Lily enjoyed playing outside until her pale skin turned red, eating her father’s chocolate chip cookies, and pranking her two older brothers.</p>
<p>James Sirius Potter, the oldest, was like Lily. They both enjoyed pranks, they were stubborn, and could go from punching and kicking each other to laughing together in seconds. Albus, on the other hand, was quiet. Lily would sit with Al and read books, or play checkers (Lily <em> hated </em> chess, to the point she didn’t even bother learning the rules). When the three of them got together, Lily had to play mediator between the two boys. James would take a joke too far, Al would get angry, and Lily would have to calm them both down. No matter what, however, at the end of the day, they’d be fast friends.</p>
<p>Lily looked just like her mother, except for the fact she wasn’t athletic in the slightest. Lily was convinced that Ginny Potter was the best person in the world. She was kind and caring, but stern when she needed to be. She would sit with Lily when she was upset, listen to her rant and rave, and then offer advice. Lily loved her mum more than anything.</p>
<p>Lily loved her dad too, but she wasn’t as close to him as Albus was. Her dad was slightly overworked, but Lily <em> knew </em> he cared. Whenever he had time, he’d call Lily into the kitchen and ask her to help him bake. It was a little ritual they had, and Lily cherished it, because it was something she could <em> do. </em> Mum had tried to teach Lily how to ride a broom, but she was dreadful. It was embarrassing, not only because her mother had been captain of the Hollyhead Harpies, but James had witnessed the entire thing and teased her for weeks (Lily had enough one day and punched him however, and that was that).</p>
<p>“Lily! Lily, it’s time to wake up, love!”</p>
<p>Lily sat up, rubbed her eyes, and exhaled shakily. It was September 1st, 2019. Her first day at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“I’m up mum, be down in a minute!” She called.</p>
<p>The truth was, Lily had been up since four in the morning, worrying. She knew that her parents wouldn’t care what house she ended up in (after all, Al was a Slytherin), but she still was unsure. Where <em> would </em> she end up? Probably not Slytherin, considering she wasn’t cunning in the slightest. Ravenclaw was also a no, because Lily wasn’t one to stick to something for long. The redhead wasn’t sure if she wanted to go to Gryffindor, considering she wasn’t all that keen on her brother’s teasing. The other problem with Gryffindors was the fact they were just…a bit <em> much. </em> Loud, brash, obnoxious…Lily wasn’t sure that was her. Sure, she was loud, and could jump into things without thinking, but that wasn’t because she was super <em> brave </em> or anything.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, Lily put on her favorite dress, grabbed her converse and her trunk, and made her way downstairs.</p>
<p>When she got there, her family was already at the table. Smiling at her mother, Lily took her usual seat as a plate of chocolate chip pancakes was placed in front of her. Her smile became much more genuine at that. They had made her favorite breakfast. A wave of gratitude washed over Lily, and she realized that she wouldn’t be seeing her parents for months at a time now. Her mum seemed to read her thoughts, and smoothed her hair back.</p>
<p>“Just focus on breakfast, Lils.” She said, and Lily nodded jerkily.</p>
<p>“Aw, is Silly Little Lily going to cry?” James taunted, and before their mother could reprimand him, Lily picked up the syrup and squirted it at him. It landed on his shirt, and he cried out in indignation.</p>
<p>“Serves you right, you jerk!” Lily smirked, and their mum sighed, but she was trying to hide her smile.</p>
<p>“Go and change your shirt Jamie, and stop teasing your sister.” Ginny said. James grumbled at the nickname but complied, standing up and shooting Lily a murderous glare. Lily smiled at him angelically. Al watched the entire exchange in amusement, and high fived Lily when James left.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’ve got fifteen minutes until we need to leave.” Lily’s dad announced, and then turned to Lily with a crooked smile, “excited, Lils?”</p>
<p>“Yep! Nervous, but excited!” Lily announced, smiling back. Harry nodded in approval.</p>
<p>After James returned, the Potter family made their way to the car. It was old, but worked, and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>“Can we fly?” James asked excitedly, giving his parents the puppy dog eyes. Before Harry could even blink, Ginny had said, “not after last year, James Sirius Potter.”</p>
<p>In short, the car ride was full of a pouting James, a quiet Al, and an extremely nervous Lily.</p><hr/>
<p> As Lily ran through the barrier, she couldn’t help but grin. Platform 9¾ was as amazing as she remembered.</p>
<p>As soon as Lily’s luggage was on the train, she turned to her parents.</p>
<p>“Alright, love, this is it.” Her mum said, smiling at her widely. Lily could feel her eyes water, and she threw her arms around her parents.</p>
<p>“I’m going to miss you both.” She muttered, and she felt two pairs of arms around her.</p>
<p>“We’ll miss you too. Don’t worry, you’ve got your brothers, and we’ll write as often as you want.” Her dad replied, and Lily made a sound that was a mix of a laugh and a sob.</p>
<p>“‘You’ve got your brothers’ isn’t very reassuring, dad.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ginny laughed, squeezing her tightly as the warning whistle sounded.</p>
<p>“That’s your cue.” Ginny said, kissing her forehead, “knock ‘em dead.”</p>
<p>Lily boarded the train with Al and James, who were kind enough to not make fun of her for her emotional display. The three siblings ran into a compartment, and waved at their parents through the open window. As the train began to take off, Lily shouted, “see you at Christmas!”</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds, they were gone.</p>
<p>Lily turned to James and Al.</p>
<p>“So, what now?” She asked, and James rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“So <em> I’m </em> going to sit with my friends. Have fun.” He said, and before Lily could protest, he was gone.</p>
<p>“And then there were two.” The eleven year old sighed, and turned to Al, who looked at her apologetically.</p>
<p>“I was…actually planning on sitting with my friends too. You can come with if you’d like, but…” Lily shook her head, slightly put out.</p>
<p>“Go on. You probably don’t want your little sister annoying you.” She said, an edge to her voice. Albus looked ready to argue, but Lily shoved him out of the compartment.</p>
<p>“And now there’s one.” Lily muttered, flopping onto a seat. So much for having her brothers.</p>
