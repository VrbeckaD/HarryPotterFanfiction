  <span>"Granger? Are you ready yet?" Draco eyed himself in the mirror and smirked. Black really was his color. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard the door swing open and Hermione walked through excitedly. With a twirl, she asked, "How do I look?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crestfallen, he muttered, "I thought you were going to dress like Slave Leia."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes at the asinine comment. "Well, I thought you were going to go as Han Solo." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffed at the suggestion he would possibly want to be something as lowly as a pilot and smuggler. "No way. Kylo is my guy. Dark Side, powerful, fair skin, looks great in black, utter disappointment to his parents..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, Darth Tantrum. I get that," she teased and stood proudly. "Well, I wanted to be Rey because of the whole badass female heroine not knowing she has powers and 'saving the universe' thrust upon her deal." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thrust you say?" He walked toward her and toyed with the strips of fabric lazily draped around her body. Draco gave her a little shrug of the eyebrows that always made her heart race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uh, uh. Not now," she bit her lip and pushed him away, albeit a tad unwillingly. "We have a portkey appointment to keep. Why is it we are going to Los Angeles to watch The Last Jedi?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Excitedly he rambled, "I told you. They'll have a full orchestra playing the score along with the film, Stormtroopers acting as ushers, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>AdamDriverwillbethere</span>
  </em>
  <span>." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione snorted at the way he rushed the last part. "Merlin. You're such a fanboy! Do you think you're going to meet Adam Driver?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco dropped his voice attempting is best James Earl Jones impression, "I find your lack of faith disturbing." Under his breath, he muttered a spell and a beam of red light emitted from his wand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you modify lumos to turn your wand into a lightsaber?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Force is strong with this one,” he said smugly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione twirled her wand and concentrated. "Let me try."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes narrowed as he said with conviction, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Do. Or do not. There is no try.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"What no Yoda voice?" she said with a half smile. Tapping into her inner Jedi, she allowed her senses to connect with The Force. Hermione whispered, </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Lumos,"</span>
  </em>
  <span> and a beam of blue rose from her vinewood wand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked disappointed as she examined her 'lightsaber.'</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's wrong?" Draco asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It doesn't hum." She began twirling it around and making the humming noises with her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco held out his hand, </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Join me, and together we'll rule the galaxy!"</span>
  </em>
  <span> For added effect, he also began humming like a lightsaber.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Never!"</span>
  </em>
  <span> She screamed in defiance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two dueled across the room laughing hysterically when one of them would use magic to imitate Jedi powers. Suddenly an alarm went off in Draco's pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Time to go, Princess," he leaned in and kissed her, appreciative of them sharing this little piece of the muggle world that still managed to be magical. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Breaking the kiss, she joked, "Seduced by the Dark Side."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I love you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smirked,</span>
  <em>
    <span> "I know."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oof. I totally walked into that one, didn't I?"</span>
