    <p>He vividly remembered the night of his fifth birthday party and the starched robes and collars he used to wear. His hair had been gelled enough to resemble something neat and classy, even though a few ebony hairs would find their way out. His baby sister wore a dress made to the nines by wizard tailors that had fought tooth and nail to fit the little girl. He remembered how he had been trained to stand next to his father, matching coats and ties, greeting guests as they entered the manor. He was his charming little self, a smile on his face. </p><p> </p><p>They were a wealthy family, not so much as the Coopers, Blossoms, and Lodges, but they were quite well off. Even so, they had more than the Mantles, the founders of Maple Racing Broom Incorporated, and the Claytons (the young patriarch played for England in the recent Quidditch World Cup), and those two families were purebloods! </p><p> </p><p>The Jones family had a mixed bloodline. They married whoever they could to pass on the Jones name. That five year-old boy was a half-blood and so was his little sister, but nobody cared because they were the inheritors to the Jones fortune. </p><p> </p><p>Oh <em> Merlin, </em> how that all went to shit in the blink of an eye. </p><p> </p><p>Aurors had crashed his birthday party that night, sending pureblood guests scurrying for the hills and Disapparating like madmen. Their manor was ransacked as he, his mother, and his baby sister were huddled up in his father’s study. He was waiting for his father, the man that most resembled him, to come back and say that everything was fine, that it had all been a prank, that he could finally cut his birthday cake. </p><p> </p><p>How laughable that would have been. </p><p> </p><p>The aurors raided the Jones Manor, looking for anything incriminating. To the Jones’ chagrin, they did find what they wanted: a detailed journal from a man, long dead, and with the five year old boy’s same name. It had been Forsythe Pendleton Jones Senior. </p><p> </p><p>As later revealed in news clippings from <em> The Daily Prophet, </em> Forsythe Jones I had been a Death Eater when the Second Wizarding War came around. Sure, he had been one of the older followers of Voldemort, but nevertheless, he was there. It was discovered that most of the luxuries that the Jones family could afford came from illegal transactions with Death Eaters in the Second Wizarding War. They were shocked at the illegal transactions, not the Death Eater part. </p><p> </p><p>The Jones family was a Slytherin-prominent family. Many members of the once noble bloodline turned to Voldemort during the First and Second Wizarding Wars (these were people that everyone knew had sided with the Dark Lord, but there hadn’t been any sort of physical proof to back it up), just like the Blossoms. The Blossoms had sided with Voldemort during both wars as well, but they never got caught for anything: they had too large a foothold in the Ministry of Magic (which reminded many of the Malfoys) for anyone to even think about saying anything. </p><p> </p><p>The Blossoms’ cousins, the Coopers, had once been part of the same bloodline. When the Blossoms sided with Voldemort, the Coopers split off and took their portion of the Blossom fortune with them, continuing the pureblood line but without supporting the Dark Lord. The Coopers were eventually able to reconcile with the Blossoms, and there had been no bad blood about the situation. They were family, after all. </p><p> </p><p>With the Lodges’ recent move to France, the main wealthy Slytherin bloodlines were held in the names of Cooper, Blossom, and Jones. But when the aurors crashed the party at their manor, the Joneses fell from their shiny pedestal.</p><p> </p><p>The Jones fortune was taken along with all that they inherited from Forsythe Jones I, which was approximately 90% of their wealth. The family of four was left without much and their name had become disgraced in the wizarding world. They had been well off before then, but they were now almost dirt poor. They were left without a house, many of their valuable baubles, their memberships… All of their possessions, besides the clothes and a few other items they could take with them, had been confiscated by the Ministry of Magic. </p><p> </p><p>The original Forsythe hadn’t been quite truthful about his holdings in the past, and it was now biting his descendents in the ass. The Joneses, now homeless, went to live in a small wizard trailer park in the Scottish Highlands, Sunnyside Trailer Park. FP Jones had found help in some mixed blood, Slytherin-prominent families that lived there: the Fogartys, DeSantoses, Topazes, and the Peabodys. </p><p> </p><p>FP couldn’t hold a job. He was a drunk after the aurors had their way with their possessions, consuming firewhiskey, mead, Muggle beer, whatever he could get his hands on. Gladys was forced to get a job as a healer at a local wizarding hospital. She wasn’t paid much, but it was enough to feed her daughter and son. </p><p> </p><p>That five year-old boy had decided, after his father had become a drunk, that he and his baby sister, Forsythia, shouldn’t have to share the family name. He only referred to himself as Jughead, and his little sister became Jellybean. When his mom was at work, Jughead was teaching himself how to read, write, and do basic math. </p><p> </p><p>He was a very bright child, and he took care of his sister when his mother wasn’t home. He taught Jellybean how to read and write when she was old enough. </p><p> </p><p>On the morning of his eleventh birthday, Jughead woke up to an owl tapping against his window, begging to be let in. He was angry when he realized what day it was: he hated his birthday more than anything else in the world. It was the one day where his mother would try to pretend that everything was normal, specifically acting as if his dad weren’t a drunk, and his father acted the same as he always did. His birthday hadn’t ever been anything to smile about since he had turned five and aurors took everything he’d ever known. October 2nd sucked, if you asked Jughead Jones. </p><p> </p><p>Still frustrated that the owl had woken him, Jughead got up, rubbing his eyes as he walked to the window and opened it. The barn owl swooped in and perched on Jughead’s dresser, extending the parchment envelope towards the boy. Jughead walked over, taking the letter. As soon as the parchment was gone from the bird’s beak, it swooped out the window again. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead rolled his eyes and pushed back his messy, unruly hair as he shut the window again. </p><p> </p><p>“Owls,” he muttered to himself, picking at the purple wax seal with a coat of arms and a large H. When he realized what the letter could actually be, he flipped it over and saw it addressed in emerald green: <em> Mr. F.P. Jones III.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Jughead rolled his eyes again at that. He didn’t like being called his father’s name, especially not his father’s nickname. <em> Forsythe </em> was bad enough, but to be called <em> FP… </em> that was asking for a black eye. </p><p> </p><p><em> Who would be writing to me?… Especially with that address? </em> Jughead asked himself. He flipped the letter over once more, breaking the seal and pulling the folded piece of parchment out. He read the entire thing once, twice, three times before he barged out of his room, with the parchment still in his hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Mom!” he yelled, feeling excited on his birthday for the first time in six years, waving the parchment in the air. “Mom, look what I’ve--” </p><p> </p><p>“Keep it down, boy,” his father interrupted over his breakfast. “What could be so important?” And just like that, Jughead’s mood was subdued. The light in his blue eyes faded quickly as he turned towards his mother. </p><p> </p><p>Gladys looked up from the stove, where she was making eggs and toast. </p><p> </p><p>“Happy birthday, Jughead!” she said with a smile. Jughead didn’t acknowledge his mother’s sentiment. He hated his birthday. “What do you have there?” </p><p> </p><p>“I got a letter,” he told her, almost monotone after his father’s outburst. “From Hogwarts.” Jughead handed the parchment to his mom, who then read the letter over a few times. He noticed how his father seemed to perk up at that while Jughead sat himself in a chair at the kitchen table. </p><p> </p><p>“Hogwarts, eh?” FP asked, taking a sip of coffee, no doubt spiked with scotch. “You better be a Slytherin.” </p><p> </p><p>“FP, no need to pressure him,” Gladys said nicely. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s a Jones. He’s gotta be a Slytherin or he’s not a Jones,” his father grumbled, waving his fork around. Gladys ignored him, looking at her son again. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m very proud of you, Jug,” she said. “We’ll go shopping in Diagon Alley next weekend for all of these school supplies you’ll need.” Gladys set a plate of food in front of him: eggs, toast, and...</p><p> </p><p>“Bacon?” Jughead asked, looking up at his mom. Gladys nodded with a smile. “For me?” </p><p> </p><p>“Just for you,” she replied, ruffling the inky hair on his head that he hadn’t yet covered with his hat. “Happy birthday, Jug.” She kissed his cheek before returning to the pan of eggs on the stove, making Jellybean’s breakfast. </p><p> </p><p>“Psst. Boy,” FP said, grabbing his son’s attention. Jughead looked over at his father. “You’re our one chance to get on the straight and narrow, boy,” he told Jughead. “Get into Slytherin, get on the quidditch team, and do something with whatever talent you have.” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead had always liked quidditch. He’d been playing club quidditch with some of the richer kids in Great Britain before everything had gone to ruins. With their new lifestyle, Jughead hadn’t really had the chance to get back on a broom. He’d been a pretty good chaser when he was four, if he could say so himself, but that was years ago. He <em> would </em> be playing with the other kids in the trailer park if he didn’t already know that Sweet Pea, Fangs, and Joaquin liked to play by their own rules. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead was thrown back into reality when Jellybean, her dirty blonde hair in little pigtails, came and gave him a tight hug. </p><p> </p><p>“Happy birthday, Juggie!” she said. Jughead simply smiled down at his little sister, hugging her back. </p><p> </p><p>“Never change, Jelly,” he whispered, looking into her big, blue eyes. “Never change.” </p><p> </p><p>When he checked his pocket later, he found a chocolate frog, even though it contained a card he already had. It was one of the better birthdays he had over the years. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Because of their low family income, Gladys had to put off Jughead’s shopping trip to the first weekend in August, just about ten months later and only a month before he was to board the Hogwarts Express. They were barely able to afford everything he needed, but Jughead pitched in a bit of money that he’d saved over the years too. </p><p> </p><p>Out of everything, the wand was what Jughead was most excited about getting. With his current home situation, Jughead often wasn’t too excitable except by his favorite Muggle burgers from the diner down the street. With the mother-son shopping trip, Jughead finally had something to be happy about as he walked through the door of Ollivander and Andrews: Makers of Fine Wands. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Ollivander had passed a few years after the Second Wizarding War was over, but he’d found a partner in Fred Andrews, the man that was the current owner of the shop. The Andrews family wasn’t one of the major pureblood families, but they were respectable, courteous, and kind. They’d made their way into exclusive pureblood circles because of their reputation for being good people. Jughead found that Mr. Andrews’ kind smile was infectious. </p><p> </p><p>“Gladys?” he asked from behind his desk. “Gladys Jones?” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, if it isn’t ol’ Freddy Andrews,” Gladys replied as they let the door shut behind them. “How’s business?” </p><p> </p><p>“Fine, especially these days,” he said. “Here for a wand for your son?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, in fact. This is Jughead, I’m sure you remember him from when he was smaller.” </p><p> </p><p>Fred looked over to the slim eleven year-old with onyx hair and a grey beanie, smiling. </p><p> </p><p>“You look just like your dad did when he was your age,” Fred said, holding out his hand for Jughead to shake. “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you, but you’ve shot up, by Merlin.” </p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet you,” Jughead replied, shaking the man’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>“The pleasure’s all mine. Now let’s get you set up with a wand.” </p><p> </p><p>While Mr. Andrews found potential wands for him to try, he explained that his own son would be attending Hogwarts beginning next September as well. Archie, Jughead thought he called his son, had gotten his wand only a week ago. </p><p> </p><p>After introductions, Mr. Andrews began pulling out wands for him to try. Jughead tried wand after wand after wand until he came upon a special one… </p><p> </p><p>“Ebony wood, dragon heartstring… 11 ¼ inches,” Fred began. “And rigid.” He placed the wand in Jughead’s hand and a few golden and red sparks shot out of the tip, lighting up the dark shop. </p><p> </p><p>“Woah,” Jughead muttered, feeling the weight of the wand in his hand. </p><p> </p><p>“That one likes you,” Fred replied. “A perfect match.” </p><p> </p><p>Later, after getting all of his mandatory supplies, Jughead had enough money left over to get a small owl from Eeylops Owl Emporium. As he and his mom were in line to buy the small snowy owl, Jughead peered ahead and saw two blonde girls and a blonde boy with their parents. The boy was the tallest, almost reaching the height of his father. One of the two girls was taller and looked tired of being there, a headband keeping her hair out of her face. The shorter girl was barely tall enough to push herself on her toes and see what was on the counter, a pink ribbon holding her blonde hair up in a ponytail. Her parents were in the process of paying for a younger, tan tabby cat. </p><p> </p><p>“Have you thought of a name for the cat, miss?” the cashier asked as he ran the transaction. The little girl looked pensive for a moment, then answered in a cheery voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Caramel!” she replied happily. Her parents didn’t seem to like that, but they went with it. Before Jughead could get another glimpse at the girl, her parents had taken her by the hand and ushered her, her brother, and her sister out of the store. </p><p> </p><p>When he got to the counter with his mom to buy his owl and the cashier asked what he was going to name him, Jughead had already thought about it. </p><p> </p><p>“Hot Dog.” His mom looked at him curiously. Jughead added: “He looks like he likes hot dogs.” (And he did like to eat hot dogs, as Jughead and the Joneses found out). </p><p> </p><p>Jughead did more reading than he would have liked to admit in the days leading up to September 1st. He scoured through his gently used textbooks, reading about whatever was in them. Often times, Jellybean would want to listen in, so he read to her too. He read about potions, wizarding history, Hogwarts, quidditch, wand lore… Jughead read almost too much about wand lore. </p><p> </p><p>He was very interested in all of the different combinations there were: the possibilities were infinite. He read about all of the woods they could be made of, the cores that powered them from the inside, and the history of wand-making. He read to Jellybean about it and she seemed intrigued for only being six years old, but nevertheless. He didn’t think his textbooks would be interesting, but they absolutely were. He couldn’t wait to get started at Hogwarts. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead woke the day before he was supposed to leave for Hogwarts, startled awake by yelling. Sincerely hoping his parents weren’t arguing again, Jughead got out of bed and put on his knit grey beanie, cut to look like a crown (it had been meant for a Halloween costume when he was eight, but it stuck with him). He cracked open his door, peering out. He heard a chittering and the gravelly voice of his father, angry at something. When Jughead opened his bedroom door all the way, he saw his father yelling at… </p><p> </p><p>“Hot Dog?” Jughead whispered to himself. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut the bloody hell up, you son of a banshee!” FP shouted at the small snowy owl as he cowered in his cage. “Good Merlin, you’re annoying!” Jughead noted the obvious bottle of cheap Muggle beer in his father’s grasp, and put two and two together. He bolted out of his room and towards his dad and owl. </p><p> </p><p>“Leave him alone, dad!” Jughead said. “He just wants food!” He tried to shove his father away from Hot Dog, but FP shoved back. Jughead hit the floor face first and scrambled back a little when he got his bearings again. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen here, boy,” FP almost slurred, his spit hitting Jughead in the face. “You get that dumb bird to shut up or <em> I’ll </em> make it shut up, got it?” </p><p> </p><p>“But, dad--” </p><p> </p><p><em> “Do you understand, </em> boy?!” FP yelled, pointing a finger at his son on the floor. Jughead nodded quickly. “Good. Now get the bloody thing away from me before I make a pie out of it.” FP blew them off with a wave of his hand and Jughead took that as an excuse to get the hell away with Hot Dog. He grabbed the cage and scurried back into his room with it. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead placed Hot Dog’s cage on his dresser and opened the cage’s door. </p><p> </p><p>“Here you go, bud,” he whispered. “You probably need to stretch your wings.” Hot Dog hooted softly and pecked at Jughead’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Ouch,” he muttered. “Yeah, I’ve got some food too.” Jughead pulled out a few owl treats he’d splurged on when he was at Diagon Alley a few weeks back. Hot Dog took them gratefully as Jughead smoothed out the white feathers on his head. When he was done, Hot Dog hooted again. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I can’t wait to get the hell out of here, either,” he mumbled, speaking to himself. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>---</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The next day, Gladys and Jellybean took Jughead to the London train station, helping him push his trolley (well… Jellybean had gotten tired of helping push early and was instead sitting on the front, making sure her mom and brother wouldn’t hit anything). They looked quite the spectacle with Hot Dog’s cage on top of the Hogwarts trunk and everything. Gladys steered them to the right barrier to get onto platform 9 ¾, just between Muggle platforms 9 and 10. </p><p> </p><p>As they walked, Jughead remembered the conversation his father had with him, informing him about the major wizarding families, including Slytherin-heavy Cooper, Lodge, and Blossom lines, as well as minor Clayton, Peabody, Topaz, Fogarty, and DeSantos (the last four were notably mixed blood). An Andrews or a Mantle were likely to be Gryffindors, Doiley a Ravenclaw, and Keller a Hufflepuff. Jughead wasn’t truly listening to his father rant over his cereal, but he had to listen to it nevertheless. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, Jug,” Gladys began quietly, snapping her son out of his headspace. “When I say so, we’re going to go towards that barrier.” </p><p> </p><p>“But it’s solid brick!” he whispered back, seeing the divider. </p><p> </p><p>“Trust me, Jughead. We’ll need to do it at a bit of a run, too,” she replied. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead thought his mother was out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“D’you need to go to Mungo’s?” he asked seriously. </p><p> </p><p>“Just trust me, kid,” she said, looking around. When nobody seemed to be watching, she told him: “Now.” </p><p> </p><p>They started pushing the trolley at a light run, speeding towards the brick in the middle. </p><p> </p><p><em> We’re gonna crash, we’re gonna crash, we’re gonna crash… </em> Jughead thought as he ran, shutting his eyes forcefully… but the impact never came. When they stopped, he opened his eyes. His mouth was suddenly agape as he saw the scarlet train engine: <b>HOGWARTS EXPRESS</b>, the train read in bold, golden letters. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin,” he said, unable to find the right words. </p><p> </p><p>“Here we are,” Gladys said. “Let’s get you settled, huh?” Jughead was only able to nod as they pushed the trolley towards an open door on the train. He watched as his mom enchanted his luggage, flying his things over to be loaded with everyone else’s. After that, Jughead slid his backpack on (that held whatever he needed for the trip up to Hogwarts). </p><p> </p><p>“Well I guess that’s it,” he sighed. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you, Jug,” his mom said, bringing her eldest in for a hug. Jughead hugged back. </p><p> </p><p>“Love you too, mom,” he muttered. They pulled back and looked at each other for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>“I know your dad says you should get into Slytherin tonight but… whatever House you’re placed in tonight is where you’re supposed to be,” Gladys explained. “Hell, if you end up in Hufflepuff by some chance, I’ll still be happy for you, okay?” Jughead smiled. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he replied. It was then that Jellybean grabbed onto him. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t go, Juggie!” she pleaded, hugging him tightly. Jughead comforted her for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be back, Jelly,” he replied. “It’s not for too long and I’ll be back for Christmas.” </p><p> </p><p>“Promise?” she asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Promise.” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” The little girl then stepped back and held her mom’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Bye,” he said with a small wave. </p><p> </p><p>“See you later, kid,” Gladys replied, motioning for him to get on the train. </p><p> </p><p>“Byeee Juggieeee!” his little sister squealed. He got a few weird looks for that, but he luckily hadn’t been noticed by too many. </p><p> </p><p>Right after he hopped on, the doors closed. </p><p> </p><p><em> Eleven o’clock sharp, </em> Jughead thought. As the train began to move, Jughead waved to his sister and mom until they were just specks in the distance and the train had picked up speed. </p><p> </p><p>It occurred to him then, when he turned to face the inside of the train’s cabin… that he didn’t know a soul on this train besides Sweet Pea, Fangs Fogarty, and Joaquin DeSantos (and they were on the bottom of the list of people he would willingly associate with because they could be jerks). Sighing and keeping his beanie-clad head down, Jughead made his way through the train cabins, trying to find an empty compartment to brood in. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead had never really gotten along with many people his age. He was okay with adults, like when he met Fred Andrews a few weeks back, but for some reason, he had never been able to really connect with anyone his age. He didn’t have any childhood friends that he remembered from his old life, and he knew he didn’t have any from the trailer park. Unless there was another broody kid in the trailer park, Jughead didn’t think he’d really get along with any kid that lived there besides Jellybean. </p><p> </p><p>When his shoulder bumped against someone else’s, Jughead was thrown back into reality again. There were older kids everywhere, but what else should he expect in his position at the bottom of the Hogwarts food chain? He passed teenagers talking about quidditch, about classes, professors, gossiping about petty drama… they were basically doing whatever they wanted. There seemed little to no supervision besides the one prefect he passed (and he only knew the kid was a prefect because he was talking about how he was a prefect and how he’d shined his badge ten too many times for Jughead’s taste). </p><p> </p><p>Summoning a bit of social courage, he chanced a look up and saw taller kids parting ahead of him. </p><p> </p><p><em> Merlin’s beard… it’s a stampede, </em> he thought to himself, ready to run in the opposite direction. </p><p> </p><p>Bursting through the crowd were three girls no older than himself, linking arms and taking up space in the narrow walkway. The girl in the middle with bright red hair spoke for all three of them. </p><p> </p><p>“Out of the way!” she demanded. “Future Slytherins, coming through!” On either side of the ginger were two more girls, one with dark hair like his own, and another with a blonde ponytail tied up with a pink ribbon. They were smiling and giggling as they made their way through the train. </p><p> </p><p>Before Jughead could process the storm before him, he’d been tripped by one of them (he didn’t know which, he only saw a blur of black, red, and blonde hair) and he faceplanted on the floor of the train. </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh,” he groaned, trying to pick himself up after a moment. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait a minute, I’ll be right back,” he heard a small voice announce from behind him, running steps resounding lightly. When Jughead looked up, he saw a small pair of feet in light pink converse before him. The girl attached to them knelt down to look him in the eye. It was the blonde girl. </p><p> </p><p>Up close, she had doll-like, emerald green eyes and a curious, but attractive, look on her face as she gazed at him. Her soft, pink lips moved, but no sound came out. This was easily the prettiest girl he’d ever seen, even if he was only eleven. </p><p> </p><p><em> She’s talking to me, </em> Jughead thought to himself. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” he asked, shaking the haze from his mind. </p><p> </p><p>“I asked if you need help getting up,” she replied with a giggle. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh…” he mumbled. “Yes, that’s very nice of you. Thank you.” He was flustered and he could hear it in his own voice, wincing. She must have noticed it too because she giggled again. It was a delightful sound, he internalized as she extended her hands for him to take. Her hands were soft and delicate and warm as she helped him to his feet. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead brushed himself off, realizing he was about half a head taller than the girl (he was slender and tall, alright). </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” he said. </p><p> </p><p>“No problem,” she replied, showing off her bright gigawatt smile to him. He noticed then that the sweater she wore matched her shoes and the ribbon in her hair. Her jeans were a light wash and--</p><p> </p><p>“B! Come on!” her friends exclaimed from behind Jughead, snapping him away from his apparent daydreaming. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said. “I’ve gotta go. See you around!” And just like that, she skipped away, her blonde ponytail swaying from side to side as she met up with her other two friends. They continued their way down the hall, making older students stumble out of the way in front of them. The older kids seemed to know who they were, but Jughead was left clueless, shrugging his shoulders and moving on. </p><p> </p><p>Looking back at the ginger’s quite assumptious statement, Jughead could imagine her and the raven-haired girl getting into Slytherin… but the blonde? There was no way she was a Slytherin, Jughead thought. <em> Maybe a Hufflepuff. </em> </p><p> </p><p>After a while of walking through train cabins, Jughead finally found an empty compartment. He stepped inside, sliding the door closed behind him and sitting in the corner. He shrugged his backpack off and let it sit next to him, laying on his leg. He watched the English countryside pass by as he sat in the corner of the graciously quiet compartment. Jughead was about to pull out his used copy of <em> Quidditch Through the Ages </em> that his mother secretly bought him (read: without his father’s knowledge) as a late birthday present when someone rapped on the window of his compartment door. </p><p> </p><p>He looked up, seeing a witch with a trolley. She opened the door, peering inside. </p><p> </p><p>“Anything from the trolley, dear boy?” she asked sweetly, smiling. Jughead glanced over and saw through the windows that she had loads and loads of candy and food. He licked his lips subtly, but remembered that he didn’t have too much extra money. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh… no thank you,” he replied, lying right through his teeth. He was starving. </p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me? Two chocolate cauldron cakes and two bottles of pumpkin juice please,” another boy’s voice rang through the air. Jughead looked at the boy in question and saw his fiery red hair and eerily familiar kind smile. He dropped the coins into the witch’s hand and she handed him the drinks and cakes. “Thank you.” </p><p> </p><p>“My pleasure, dear,” the witch replied, moving on to the next compartment. After she left, Jughead watched as the most ridiculous thing happened: the red-headed boy knocked on his compartment door. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey…” he greeted as Jughead looked shocked. “You look like you could use some company. I’m Archie. Archie Andrews. Can I sit?” </p><p> </p><p><em> It’s Fred Andrews’ son, </em> Jughead thought to himself. <em> That’s why his smile was familiar. </em> </p><p> </p><p>“Uh… Uh, yeah,” Jughead stumbled through his words, motioning to the bench across from him. “I’m Jughead… Jones.” </p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet you,” the boy across from him said, offering a hand for Jughead to shake. “I bought these for you, y’know? I could tell you were hungry. I’ve got plenty of food where I came from. I just wanted a pumpkin juice.” Archie handed Jughead the two cakes and a bottle of juice. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” he replied shyly, taking the items. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t mind. I just wanted to introduce myself, see if we could be friends.” </p><p> </p><p>“I appreciate that,” Jughead replied, starting to dig into one of the cakes. “Merlin, these are good,” he added, a mouthful of cake as he spoke. Archie laughed. </p><p> </p><p>“So, where are you from, Jughead?” Archie asked, and just like that, a great friendship was born. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead and Archie laughed and talked about whatever came to their minds, but mostly quidditch. He learned that Archie’s favorite team was Puddlemere United because their home pitch was near where he lived in the outskirts of London, but Jughead’s favorite was the Montrose Magpies because they were the only good team on his side of the Scottish Highlands. They high fived each other when they learned that they were both chasers when they played club quidditch. They just laughed and talked about whatever came to their minds while Jughead savored his cauldron cakes and bottle of pumpkin juice. </p><p> </p><p>When Jughead had finally explained the difference between blagging and blatching fouls to Archie (and more importantly, how to <em> remember </em> the difference), they realized an hour had passed since they’d met… but the only reason they realized was because--</p><p> </p><p>“Yo, Andrews,” someone called out, headed towards the compartment Archie and Jughead were in. The boy, about the same age as them, let himself into the compartment with a bigger boy and a smaller girl behind him. “There you are. Moose here thought you learned to Disapparate or something, the buffoon, but I thought you just got lost. And-- wait, who’s that?” </p><p> </p><p>“I just ran into Jughead over here,” Archie replied. “Reggie, Moose, Chuck, this is Jughead Jones.” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead suddenly felt the temperature drop in the room. Whatever was about to happen wouldn’t be good. Archie, oblivious, turned back to Jughead. </p><p> </p><p>“And I was hoping we’d run into--” </p><p> </p><p>“Jones?” Reggie interjected. Archie stopped and stood. “As in the <em> Forsythe </em> kind?” Jughead gulped. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe, but what does that matter--” </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin’s saggy balls!” Reggie exclaimed, looking towards Jughead. “Lookie what we’ve got here! The grandson of a Death Eater!” </p><p> </p><p>“Reg, stop--” Archie tried to butt in. </p><p> </p><p>“Why would I stop? We’ve got an actual descendant of <em> dragon shit </em> in this compartment!” </p><p> </p><p>“Back off, Reggie,” Archie said sternly, pushing at the boy’s chest. “Let’s go back to our compartment, alright? No need to cause too much trouble this early.” Archie shoved Reggie out and down the hall as Jughead watched from his seat. Archie turned around before he left. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry about him. He can be a little much,” he apologized. Jughead nodded, his head down. “I don’t care who your family is, for the record,” he added. Jughead looked up, smiling a little. “I’ll see you around, dude. And I hope you make a House quidditch team at some point.” </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks. You too,” Jughead replied. Archie nodded then went on his way, sliding the compartment door closed. He was left to the weight of the eerie silence again. The only friend he had was friends with people that shamed him for the family he came from. Jughead suddenly thought that going to Hogwarts was going to be a bad thing, that people would judge him based on his family, and not on who he really was. </p><p> </p><p>But then he decided that he didn’t care. He <em> wasn’t </em> his father and he <em> wasn’t </em>his grandfather and Jughead knew that he definitely wasn’t a Death Eater, so who gave a bloody damn if Reggie thought he knew everything. He apparently didn’t know anything, just what his parents had told him. Nothing more. If being an outcast was what it took to prove to people that he wasn’t his family before him, then that’s exactly what he would do. </p><p> </p><p><em>And there’s no way that kid Reggie’s anything but a Slytherin.</em> <em>Or just a really rude, incompetent Gryffindor, </em>Jughead thought. <em>What I’d give to shove a broomstick up his--</em> </p><p> </p><p><em> Knock knock, </em> someone tapped lightly on his compartment door, drawing Jughead out of his thoughts. He didn’t know how much time had passed, but it was enough time for him to get hungry again. The door slid open, revealing the blonde girl that had helped him up earlier, carrying a pink tin lunchbox. </p><p> </p><p>Leaning against the door’s frame was a taller, similar-looking blonde girl, hissing warnings to who he assumed was her little sister. She was already dressed in her school robes, obviously a Slytherin by the emerald green on her robes. She even hissed like a snake. </p><p> </p><p>“I swear to Merlin, if Charles finds us he’s gonna tell mom and then we’re toast forever--” </p><p> </p><p>“Hush, Pol, it’s fine. He’s just a boy,” the girl whispered back, her ponytail swaying with her head. “I’ll be quick.” </p><p> </p><p>“You better be,” the older girl hissed, keeping watch as her younger sister stepped inside the compartment and towards Jughead. </p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” she greeted. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” he replied, a little downtrodden. </p><p> </p><p>“I heard Reggie was giving you a hard time,” she said, looking down at the lunchbox in her hands shyly. “And I’m sorry about my friends knocking you over earlier… so here you go.” She handed the lunchbox to Jughead and he found it surprisingly heavy. “Just some extra food I collected for you. A redheaded boy I passed said you had quite the appetite.” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead opened the lunchbox, seeing there were a few more chocolate cauldron cakes, some assorted sandwiches, a bottle of ice cold pumpkin juice, and a chocolate frog. He smiled wider than he had at any point in time that day. </p><p> </p><p>“Wow. Thank you… I didn’t get your--” Jughead looked up and realized that the girl and her sister were gone, the compartment door shut once more. “--name…” he finished, speaking to himself. </p><p> </p><p>Unwrapping one of the sandwiches, Jughead smiled again, thinking to himself that this girl was definitely a Hufflepuff… and she could have been the nicest person in all of Hogwarts at this rate. She could easily be rivaled by Archie but she would crush him if it were a competition. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>---</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>A few hours later, Jughead had finished all of the food the mysterious blonde had brought him and he’d added a chocolate frog card to his small collection (he was ecstatic at the Hermione Granger card he found). He had also read all the way through <em> Quidditch Through the Ages </em> for the… he didn’t know how many times he’d read the book, but <em> a lot of times </em> was a good estimate. After that, he shut the curtains in his compartment, locked the door, and changed into his Hogwarts robes. He’d briefly forgotten how to tie his tie, but he eventually remembered and was able to get it under the white collar of the shirt he was wearing. For the remainder of the train ride, Jughead sat in his compartment anxiously, nervous for what was going to happen next. He spent a good amount of time fiddling with his wand, looking at it in different angles and feeling the smooth wood in the palms of his hands. He wished he at least had Hot Dog to keep him company, but the small snowy owl was with the rest of the students’ pets. He’d hopefully be able to see the bird later tonight. </p><p> </p><p>“WE WILL BE REACHING HOGWARTS IN FIVE MINUTES’ TIME,” a voice resounded through the train. “PLEASE LEAVE YOUR LUGGAGE ON THE TRAIN. IT WILL BE TAKEN TO HOGWARTS SEPARATELY.”</p><p> </p><p>The train skidded to a stop five minutes later, almost knocking Jughead out of his seat as he put his backpack in one of the overhead racks. When he caught his balance, he opened his compartment door, pulling his beanie further over his head and joining the flow of students trying to get off the train. He found his wand still in his hand as they were disembarking. He stuck it up his sleeve discreetly, trying to hide it from view in case he wasn’t supposed to have it with him. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead stepped off onto a dark platform, shivering in the cool night air before looking around and trying to figure out where he was going. Around him, students were bustling back and forth. He didn’t know which direction he should be going until--</p><p> </p><p>“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!” Jughead looked up and saw a very large man with more facial hair than he’d ever seen on someone before. He held a lantern up near his face and Jughead saw that the man was older than he put out, his face weathered from all of the years he must have endured. “Firs’ years, follow me!” he called out again. Jughead made a beeline for the large man, eventually coming side to side with him. </p><p> </p><p>“H’llo there,” he greeted Jughead, one of his large palms on Jughead’s back, ushering him towards the lake. “The name’s Rubeus Hagrid.” Jughead looked up at the man and smiled. “And-- gallopin’ gorgons, are yeh by chance… FP Jones Junior’s boy?” </p><p> </p><p>“Uh… yeah. That’s me…” Jughead sighed. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeh look jus’ like ‘im,” Hagrid said. “Don’ tell me yer th’ third.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’d be lying, sir.” He paused for a moment. “But I call myself Jughead.” </p><p> </p><p>“Migh’ be better n’ the alternative.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, sir.” </p><p> </p><p>“Nice t’ meet yeh, Jughead. Go on now, ter the boats.” Hagrid gave him a little shove and Jughead made his way to the bank of the lake. </p><p> </p><p>Once all of the sixty or so first years had made it to the shore, Hagrid instructed them to get in the small rowboats, each with a lantern hanging off the front of it. Jughead ended up in a boat with three other kids that he didn’t recognize. Two of them looked like twins and the other introduced himself briefly as Kevin. </p><p> </p><p>The boat ride across the lake was quiet besides the whispers among the students. The view of Hogwarts itself was astounding. From his spot in the boat, Jughead determined that Hogwarts looked like a fortress and a castle at the same time. There was a yellow glow coming from many of the thousands of windows and one large wing looked entirely lit by candles. Jughead presumed that’s where everyone was headed. He was hungry again, cursed with too big a stomach for society’s standards and portion sizes. He hoped the food would be good here for the sake of his sanity. </p><p> </p><p>The small rowboats soon pulled into a cavern, which Jughead found to be an ornate underground harbor. They all clambered out onto the gravel and pebbles while Jughead tried to orient himself. He figured they must be under the castle. Hagrid led them up some stairs until his fist was pounding on a pair of large oak doors. They opened immediately, presenting a small man with a greying moustache. </p><p> </p><p>“The firs’ years for yeh, Professor Flitwick,” he announced. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Professor Hagrid,” the small man said. “I can take it from here.” he swung the door wide, allowing all of the first years to come inside. They followed behind the short man, taking a good look around. The entrance hall was huge. Jughead thought he could fit at least three of the trailers he lived in inside it. To the doorway on his right, Jughead could hear the droning of hundreds of voices. He figured the rest of the school was already there, waiting on them - but Professor Flitwick led them into an empty chamber off the hall. </p><p> </p><p>The small professor welcomed them to Hogwarts, explaining what the Houses were all about, their names, and a little information on what he called the House Cup and House points. </p><p> </p><p>“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school,” he concluded. “Please wait quietly until we are ready for you.” </p><p> </p><p>When Professor Flitwick left, small chatter broke out between the students. A few were nervous, a few confident, a few queasy… but Jughead was silent. Nothing Hogwarts could have to offer could possibly be worse than being at home with his dad for the next seven years. Except maybe… </p><p> </p><p>“Yo, there’s a Jones in here,” Jughead heard Reggie say. “Where’d the loser go?” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead tried to stay as small as possible, his gaze set on the floor. Maybe this would be worse than he thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Knock it off, Mantle,” he heard someone say in his defense. “Stop being a goblin crotch.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, <em> who said that?” </em> Reggie asked defensively in response. Jughead chuckled to himself as he looked around a little. He saw the blonde girl huddled next to the red and raven-haired girls she was with earlier, so he looked away again. </p><p> </p><p>Before Reggie could get an answer to his question, about twenty ghosts flew through the walls, making a lot of the students (mostly the boys, though most would never admit it) scream together. The House ghosts introduced themselves to the students once they all got their bearings. They were all pearly-white and somewhat transparent, gliding around the room to talk to students. The Fat Friar was from Hufflepuff, Nearly Headless Nick from Gryffindor, Helena Ravenclaw from Ravenclaw House, and the Bloody Baron from Slytherin. </p><p> </p><p>Just as they were about to warn them of Peeves (Jughead didn’t know what a Peeves was but he sure would figure out later), Professor Flitwick told the ghosts to move along and the students to make a line. </p><p> </p><p>Single file, all of the first years entered the Great Hall, marveling at the wonders inside. It was lit by thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables that the rest of the students were sitting at. All the way in the front was the head table, lined with adults in their robes, looking happy to see all of the first years. Jughead, trying to avoid people’s gaze, looked up and saw the night sky dotted with stars. When he looked down again, he noticed a four-legged stool in front of the head table, a pointed brown wizard’s hat on top of it. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually the first years came to a stop, the sixty of them grouping up near the front. When everyone was settled, the brown hat started to <em> sing. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Jughead didn’t grasp much of what the hat sang because he was so shocked.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Oh you may not think I'm pretty, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> But don't judge on what you see, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'll eat myself if you can find </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A smarter hat than me. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You can keep your bowlers black, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Your top hats sleek and tall, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And I can cap them all. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> There's nothing hidden in your head </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Sorting Hat can't see, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> So try me on and I will tell you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Where you ought to be. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You might belong in Gryffindor, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Where dwell the brave at heart, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Their daring, nerve, and chivalry </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Set Gryffindors apart; </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You might belong in Hufflepuff, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Where they are just and loyal, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Those patient Hufflepuffs are true </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And unafraid of toil; </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> if you've a ready mind, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Where those of wit and learning, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Will always find their kind; </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Or perhaps in Slytherin </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You'll make your real friends, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Those cunning folks use any means </em>
</p><p>
  <em> To achieve their ends. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> So put me on! Don't be afraid! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And don't get in a flap! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You're in safe hands (though I have none) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For I'm a Thinking Cap!" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>After the song, everyone began clapping, so Jughead joined in, still shaken up by the singing hat on a stool. Even knowing the differences between the Houses, he didn’t really know which he’d fit into best… but he knew his father would be disappointed with anything but Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p><em> You’re a Jones. Get into Slytherin, boy. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Before he had another second to think, Professor Flitwick had unrolled a piece of parchment. </p><p> </p><p>“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” he told them, standing on his own tall stool. “Andrews, Archibald!” </p><p> </p><p>Archie climbed up the steps and sat on the stool as Professor Flitwick put the Sorting Hat on his head. It lowered over the boy’s eyes. Archie sat there for a moment as Jughead tried to predict what House he would be in. </p><p> </p><p><em> Andrews… a Gryffindor? Is that was dad said? </em> </p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” The hat yelled. All of the students that were in that House stood and cheered as Archie got down, running to greet his new House mates. Gryffindor’s table was in the center on his left from the Great Hall’s entrance. </p><p> </p><p>The Sorting proceeded on that way. </p><p> </p><p>“Blossom, Cheryl!” </p><p> </p><p>It was the red-headed girl that might have tripped him on the train. </p><p> </p><p><em> Blossom… Definitely Slytherin. </em> </p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” </p><p> </p><p>The table all the way to the left cheered loudly as Cheryl went to sit with them. </p><p> </p><p>“Brown, Trevor!” He was one of the twins in the boat with him and Kevin. He didn’t recognize the last name though. </p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” The Hufflepuff table was to the far right. </p><p> </p><p>“Brown, Valerie!” That was his twin sister. </p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p> </p><p>“Button, Benjamin!” Jughead didn’t recognize him, either. He was small, blonde, and shy by the looks of it. </p><p> </p><p>“RAVENCLAW!” That table was in the middle and to the right. </p><p> </p><p>“Clayton, Charles!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Clayton… Slytherin, </em> Jughead thought. </p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” </p><p> </p><p>“Cooper, Elizabeth!” </p><p> </p><p>The blonde girl made her way up to the stool… but Jughead recognized the pink ribbon in her hair and the name that came with her.  </p><p> </p><p><em> Coopers are Slytherins, </em> Jughead thought. <em> But she couldn’t possibly be… </em> </p><p> </p><p>She sat on the stool and the hat was placed on her head, sinking over her eyes. Her hands were in fists as she sat there, bearing her knuckles on the stool. Most everyone before Elizabeth hadn’t taken long for the Sorting Hat to come to a verdict… but she was taking much longer for the hat to decide. </p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes passed, people began mumbling amongst each other. Kevin leaned over to him. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s a hatstall, mate,” he whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s a hatstall?” Jughead asked, noting that Elizabeth was starting to look strained and anxious, a color he hadn’t seen on the girl in the few hours he’d known of her. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s when the hat takes more than five minutes to decide what House you’re supposed to be in.” </p><p> </p><p><em> Merlin’s wrinkled pants, </em> Jughead thought. <em> She must be giving that hat a run for its money. </em> </p><p> </p><p>“She’s a Cooper,” one of the students in front of him whispered. “She’s bound to go to--” </p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted, silencing the murmurs and causing the entire Gryffindor table to jump up, cheering. Jughead noticed that after the hat was removed, she looked frazzled, just like anyone else that knew Coopers were Slytherins. Jughead looked over at the Slytherin table and saw Cheryl Blossom, who he now recognized as Elizabeth’s cousin. She was obviously confused, as was the rest of the Slytherin table. The girl that Jughead recognized as her older sister looked away, along with a taller blonde boy (maybe he was their older brother?). They almost looked ashamed. </p><p> </p><p>Glancing towards the Gryffindor table, he spotted Elizabeth and how she looked a little out of place at first, but Archie had started talking to her. </p><p> </p><p><em> She’s gonna be just fine with Archie as her friend, </em> Jughead thought to himself, facing the front again. The sorting continued as if a huge bombshell hadn’t just been dropped on Hogwarts: a Cooper was a Gryffindor where the rest of her family were Slytherins. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead continued trying to predict students’ Houses based on their names, even though Elizabeth’s had been quite unexpected. </p><p> </p><p>“DeSantos, Joaquin!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Slytherin.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” </p><p> </p><p>“Doiley, Dilton!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Ravenclaw.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“RAVENCLAW!” </p><p> </p><p>“Fogarty, Edward!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Slytherin.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” </p><p> </p><p>“Jones, Forsythe the Third!” There were a few murmurs when Jughead stepped up to the stool and sat down, but he ignored them, snatching his beanie off his head before the hat could sit there. It lowered over his eyes. And then it spoke to his mind. </p><p> </p><p><em> This is the third, eh? </em> The hat said to him. <em> I’ve dealt with two of you before, but what makes </em> you <em> different? </em></p><p> </p><p><em> I’m completely different, </em> Jughead thought. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Not your father, eh? I can see that. It’s all in your head, dear boy. I can see you prefer to be called Jughead.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s better than Forsythe Pendleton.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’ll have to agree with you on that one, kid… There’s a lot here. I can see what you mean. You are truly different from your senior.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But if I don’t get into Slytherin-- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You don’t truly fear your father, Jughead. You’ll survive without his approval, without anyone’s approval. But you’ve also got a need to prove yourself different, too. Your father was much like that and--  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’m serious. I’m different.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> You’re smart, you’re original, you’re different. As much as you may want to please your father, it’ll have to be-- </em> RAVENCLAW!” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not my father,” he whispered to himself with a smile. He could see a few shocked faces in the crowd (mostly from Slytherin House; they had now been starved of two legacy students) as he pulled his beanie over his hair again. They were obviously surprised that a Jones wasn’t put into Slytherin. He was proud of himself as he made it to the Ravenclaw table between the Slytherin and Gryffindor ones. Elizabeth Cooper still looked a little downtrodden across the way, but better than before. </p><p> </p><p>“Keller, Kevin!” Professor Flitwick continued. Kevin marched up to the hat and sat on the stool. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hufflepuff. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” </p><p> </p><p>“Klump, Midge!” </p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” </p><p> </p><p>“Lodge, Veronica!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Another Slytherin-heavy family… </em> </p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” </p><p> </p><p>It was then that Elizabeth Cooper seriously didn’t seem happy to be sorted into Gryffindor. The Lodges weren’t related to the Coopers, but very good friends. Veronica and Elizabeth must be best friends with Cheryl. Jughead didn’t really know too much about what was going on between the three of them, but he knew they seemed close. </p><p> </p><p>“Mantle, Reginald!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Ugh, </em> Jughead thought. <em> Anything but Ravenclaw. He’s supposed to be a Gryffindor anyways.  </em></p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” Jughead rolled his eyes. He didn’t think Reggie should be anywhere but Slytherin, but he preferred the dragon shitter anywhere away from Ravenclaw. </p><p> </p><p>“Mason, Marmaduke!” </p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!”</p><p> </p><p>“McCoy, Josephine!” Jughead recognized her name. Her mother must have been Auror Sierra McCoy. </p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” </p><p> </p><p>“Muggs, Ethel!” </p><p> </p><p>“RAVENCLAW!” </p><p> </p><p>“Peabody, Jeremy!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Slytherin.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p><p> </p><p>“Topaz, Antoinette!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Her family lives in the trailer park too. Slytherin.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“RAVENCLAW!” Jughead was kind of shocked by that one, but he didn’t know her well. </p><p> </p><p>“Valentine, Melody!” </p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” the Sorting Hat shouted, finishing with the last student. Beyond the names that Jughead remembered from the Sorting, there were the rest of the sixty first years. </p><p> </p><p>After singing the school song (that Jughead didn’t know the words to in the slightest), Headmistress McGonagall said a few words and food appeared on the plates in front of them. Jughead’s jaw dropped when he realized he could name food forever and still not name everything in front of him. Chicken, pork, beef, turkey, many different kinds of vegetables in all shapes and forms, pumpkin juice, water, tea, and so much more. Jughead thought he was caught drooling in heaven. </p><p> </p><p>“Earth to Jones,” Antoinette said beside him, breaking his concentration. </p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” he asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Mashed potatoes?” </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” he replied, taking the bowl and shoveling some onto his plate. “I’m Jughead, by the way.” </p><p> </p><p>“Toni,” she said curtly. “And, fair warning, if you use the name that Flitwick did, I’ll cut you a new one.” </p><p> </p><p>“I sympathize,” he replied, passing the potatoes down and reaching for the plate of turkey. “If someone called me my dad’s name, I’d flip.” </p><p> </p><p>“But <em> Jughead </em> though…?” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s better,” Jughead assured. “It’s so much better.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take your word on it then.” They both laughed heartily, beginning to eat the food that was piled on their golden plates. </p><p> </p><p>“So how’d you get your hair pink?” Jughead asked through a mouthful of potatoes he tried to conceal behind his hand. </p><p> </p><p>“An older cousin was playing around with his mom’s wand when it shot at me and made my hair turn pink. Haven’t been able to turn it back but I don’t want to, so it all worked out.” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead was able to choke back his laughter a little, but he and Toni both smiled. </p><p> </p><p>They became friends quickly, as they had similar origins. They both lived in Sunnyside Trailer Park in the Scottish Highlands under conditions that thankfully weren’t worse than they were. Toni was living with her uncle, that didn’t quite support her bisexuality, but knew he couldn’t throw Toni out on her own (he didn’t need to after she got her letter). Jughead told her about how his father had gone very far downhill after the Jones Manor was raided all those years ago. </p><p> </p><p>They talked about wanting to try out for quidditch at some point, and Jughead agreed with Toni when she said she thought she’d make a good seeker. She was petite and light; the perfect build for the position. They had the same favorite quidditch team, Jughead discovered, when dessert appeared on the table (and he took a steady helping of that, too): the Montrose Magpies. He also discovered that Toni, too, hadn’t played much quidditch with the boys in the trailer park because of their rules. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead was <em> almost </em> full when Headmistress McGonagall had the tables cleared and the room hushed. She made her announcements, mainly that nobody was allowed in the Forbidden Forest, and then sent the students off to bed. Toni, Jughead, and the ten other first years in Ravenclaw were ushered towards the two prefects, a girl and a boy, from their House. Before they could leave, they watched the Gryffindor students go in front of them. Jughead’s eyes locked on Elizabeth Cooper immediately. </p><p> </p><p>She still didn’t look too happy where she was, but she no longer looked on the verge of tears. She was walking next to Archie, and it was obvious that he was trying to cheer her up, talking about Puddlemere United (Jughead could read his lips). Quidditch talk seemed to lighten her mood a little more, picking her eyes up off the floor. Her bright green eyes looked into Jughead’s for a moment before she was gone up a stairwell with Archie, Reggie, Moose, Midge, and the other Gryffindor first years. </p><p> </p><p>While the Ravenclaw prefects gave the first years a shortened tour of Hogwarts, they spewed facts about the architecture and the founders as they climbed staircases. Many of Jughead’s fellow students were exhausted from eating so much and then having to climb stairs, but Jughead felt good after finally filling his never-ending stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, though, the group came upon a door with a bronze eagle knocker that asked them a riddle. </p><p> </p><p>“A riddle?” Jughead asked. “And we have to answer the riddle to get inside?” </p><p> </p><p>“Precisely,” the prefect replied. “It recognizes Ravenclaws, too, so it’s mostly fool proof.”</p><p> </p><p>“What gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?” the knocker asked. </p><p> </p><p>“A towel,” Jughead said before either of the prefects could think. When the two looked back at him, he rolled his eyes in annoyance. He didn’t like being underestimated. </p><p> </p><p>“Very well.” The door swung open for them and they entered the Ravenclaw common room. The room was a wide, open, circular space with a domed roof painted blue, small white stars dotting the painted sky. There were bookshelves up the walls, chairs and tables and lamps around the room serving the purpose of study areas. There was a marble statue of who Jughead presumed to be Rowena Ravenclaw standing in the middle of the room. The male prefect snapped Jughead out of his thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>“Your dormitories are up the stairs. Boys to your left, girls to your right,” he said. “Any questions?” There didn’t seem to be any. “Welcome to Ravenclaw Tower.” </p><p> </p><p>It was then that the prefects went towards their own rooms and the first years followed the stairs up to theirs. Toni and Jughead waved goodbye to each other, parting at the stairwell. He found the right door, labelled <b>First Years</b>. Jughead was followed into the room by Ben, Dilton, and two other boys. They saw the blue curtains and quilts on four-post beds in the circular room. </p><p> </p><p>Their things had been brought up, placed to the right of their assigned beds. Jughead got the bed closest to the bathroom the five boys were to share. Almost too tired to function, all of them changed out of their robes and into sleepwear, climbing into bed, and falling asleep as soon as their heads hit their pillows. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The next morning wasn’t as great as Jughead thought it was going to be. He got up and got dressed then went down to the Great Hall for breakfast. He sat between Toni and Ben Button, nicely conversing with them as well as Dilton and Ethel. Being placed in Ravenclaw was probably the best thing to happen to Jughead. He was pushing the boundaries and it felt good. </p><p> </p><p>That was until the owl post came. Hot Dog swooped in from overhead to Jughead’s surprise, coming down to perch on his shoulder. He took the letter from the owl’s beak but Hot Dog stayed there for a minute. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Jughead said to him somewhat bluntly, trying to get him to go with the rest of the owls back to the owlery. Hot Dog nipped at Jughead’s cheek. “Hey!” He threw a piece of toast at the owl and he caught it in his beak, flying away with a hoot. </p><p> </p><p>“Feisty bird you’ve got there, Jones,” Toni teased. Jughead shook his head as he looked up and put his letter to the side, taking a bite of bacon instead. He watched a majestic eagle owl land on Elizabeth Cooper’s shoulder, politely handing her a red envelope. After getting the owl to go away, she stood and ran out of the Great Hall as if she had an explosive in her hand or something. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin to Jughead,” Dilton said to him, making Jughead jump. He raised his eyebrows in an unspoken question. “You should probably open that envelope before it opens you, y’know.” He pushed his thick-rimmed glasses up the bridge of his nose. It was only then that Jughead noticed the letter on the table. </p><p> </p><p>It was an envelope of bright red parchment. It looked exactly the same as the one that Cooper had gotten from the Gryffindor table. </p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Jughead asked, picking it up. The letter was beginning to smoke at the corners. Dilton ducked under the table, putting his fingers into his ears while Ethel and Ben followed his lead. Jughead and Toni shrugged at each other before he opened it. </p><p> </p><p>Dust shook from the ceiling. Jughead thought Reggie had pranked him for a moment… that it had exploded. How wrong he was. </p><p> </p><p><b> <em>“JUGHEAD JONES, YOU’RE LUCKY I HAVEN’T MARCHED UP TO HOGWARTS AND PULLED YOU AWAY YET! WE GOT A LETTER FROM MCGONAGALL LAST NIGHT! HOW DARE YOU SHAME YOUR FAMILY BY BEING PLACED IN RAVENCLAW! YOU’RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO YOUR NAME--”</em> </b> </p><p> </p><p>Jughead wanted to yell back that his <em> father </em> was the one embarrassing their name by sending… <em> whatever this was </em> at a time like this and for a reason like this, but nobody would have heard it. The letter was so deafening that the rest of the Great Hall had gone silent, watching the red envelope berate him. </p><p> </p><p><b> <em>“--AND YOU’VE DISGRACED ME AND YOUR MOTHER BY BEING SORTED THIS WAY. DON’T EXPECT ANY FAVORS, BOY. YOU’RE JUST DIGGING AN EVEN BIGGER HOLE FOR THE REST OF US!”</em> </b> </p><p> </p><p>Jughead watched as the red parchment ripped itself up and left a few pieces charred on the table in front of him. He could see some of the words written in black ink, in his father’s handwriting. He bit the inside of his cheek when everything remained silent in the Great Hall. </p><p> </p><p>“Just my Jones luck,” he sighed. </p><p> </p><p>“That was a Howler,” Ben mumbled as he, Dilton, and Ethel came back up to their seats, along with another first year Ravenclaw.</p><p> </p><p>“He was probably drunk, like he always is,” Jughead muttered to Toni while she sat there in awe. He brushed the pieces of paper off of his plate while casual conversation resumed quietly. “It doesn’t matter anyway,” he muttered, looking down at his lap, solemn. “My dad’s ruined breakfast.” He sat there, picking pieces of the ripped parchment off of his robes. “I wasn’t hungry anyways.” </p><p> </p><p>Toni, still shocked by it all, tried to pull Jughead back by the wrist, but he slipped from her grip as he rose, collected his backpack with his books and materials, and walked out of the Great Hall, his eyes glued to the floor. He was pretty sure that Reggie Mantle tried to make fun of him for it, but Jughead didn’t even care. </p><p> </p><p>The rest of the day wasn’t the easiest. Toni caught up with Jughead later, copying the Ravenclaw first years’ schedule for him (Professor Flitwick handed them out after he’d left). The Ravenclaws had every class together, but they also had classes with other Houses. They had Charms, Potions, and History of Magic with the Gryffindors, Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, and Defense Against the Dark Arts with the Slytherins for the day. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead didn’t say much besides whisperings to Toni. He was more focused on all of the new material they were about to learn. Jughead quickly found out that any class with Hufflepuffs was peaceful and productive. Slytherins could get a little chaotic, too, but not so much as the Gryffindors. The three classes with Gryffindors sucked for Jughead because of Reggie Mantle and Moose Mason (even though Jughead knew Moose was just tagging along and that he was a Muggleborn), along with another Gryffindor or two.  </p><p> </p><p>Reggie teased Jughead any chance he got. Moose and two other boys laughed at all of Reggie’s jokes. Jughead ignored them as best as he could but had to hold Toni back once or twice from ripping Mantle a new one. He didn’t care about what Reggie or Moose thought about his home life, Jughead already knew it was shitty. </p><p> </p><p>Archie, Elizabeth, and a few others seemed to be rolling their eyes at Reggie too, but that didn’t stop him from poking at Jughead in all of the classes they had together. In fact, Archie still seemed to be trying to cheer Elizabeth Cooper up. She didn’t seem to give anyone the light of day unless it was Archie or a professor. </p><p> </p><p>After every class that Jughead had a class with Gryffindors, the only part he could focus on was trying to go thank Elizabeth properly for everything she’d done for him the day before. Every time he tried to approach her, she scurried off to her next class, Archie right behind her. </p><p> </p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was dinner time. Jughead hadn’t eaten much that day, not feeling too in the mood, as the Howler had spoiled his day. Toni was still sitting next to him, evidently worried about her new friend. </p><p> </p><p>“Jug, I know you don’t want to talk and maybe you want to be alone, so let me offer you some advice,” she whispered to him as he picked at the chicken and vegetables on his plate. That seemed to have piqued his interest, as he was now looking at her. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s up, Toni?” he asked, interested but obviously disappointed at how shitty of a day he was having. </p><p> </p><p>“I went asking around older students and there’s rumors of a room that’ll change into anything you want it to,” she replied. Jughead blinked twice, the intrigue rising to the surface. “It’s called the Room of Requirement. It’s a hidden room on the seventh floor, in the west corridor. You have to think of what you want the room to hold. You can make it almost whatever you want,” Toni explained. “You have to walk past it three times, thinking of what you want the room to function as. Be specific.” </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Toni,” Jughead said finally. “I might use it later.” </p><p> </p><p>“Just be careful, okay? We’re already in the lead for House points and if you’re found out of bed--” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be okay, Toni,” he replied. “And I’ll be careful.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>---</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>That night, Jughead pretended to do homework until all of the Ravenclaw boys had fallen asleep. Clad in his flannel pants and a t-shirt, Jughead was about to venture into Hogwarts when he realized how cold it was. He grabbed the House sweatshirt every student was gifted with after being sorted. It was grey, had RAVENCLAW lettered across the chest, and the Ravenclaw crest was on the side of one of the sleeves. Jughead then took his wand and creeped out of his room as quiet as possible. </p><p> </p><p>It was late, he knew that. It was almost 11PM. He crept down the stairs and through the middle of the vacant common room, stopping at the door. He took a deep breath and opened the door quietly, trying not to wake the knocker. When he shut the door behind him, Jughead realized he was successful. </p><p> </p><p>He made his way through the moonlit castle, only losing his way once before he found himself on the seventh floor corridor. Just as he rounded the corner to be in the west wing, Jughead saw none other than Elizabeth Cooper, pacing in front of a blank expanse of concrete brick in the area that Toni had described, a tan tabby cat watching curiously and mewling softly. </p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t tell from where he was, but it looked like she was crying, her blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail by the thin, pink ribbon. She was wearing light blue shorts, her grey Gryffindor sweatshirt with scarlet and gold lettering, and the same pink converse as they day before on her feet. She was sniffling and hiccoughing quietly as tears rolled down her face. Evident in her hands was a small, charred piece of red paper. She eventually stopped walking, close to almost breaking down completely. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead took a careful step forward. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello?” he asked quietly. She looked up without another word, along with what he assumed was her cat. He noticed the way that her beautiful green eyes were glossed over, even from a distance and even in the dark, moonlit hall. She didn’t flinch when she noticed his presence, so he allowed himself to pad forward carefully. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you here for the Room of Requirement too?” Jughead asked, approaching the girl. She nodded with a sniffle when he finally stood next to her. “Let me help you. One of my friends taught me how to do this.” Elizabeth nodded and stepped away a little to give him space. </p><p> </p><p>He remembered what Toni had told him about opening the room, walking by the wall three times and thinking specifically of what he wanted in the room. Eventually, he was able to get the door to appear. Elizabeth gasped a little and he ushered her and her cat inside, shutting the door behind them. She looked at him in awe and picked up her cat while he took in his creation. </p><p> </p><p>He’d made the room a very comforting place. Books lined the walls, a fireplace on the far wall. Large windows let calming moonlight flood the room. There was a pot of warm chamomile tea, one filled with coffee, and one with hot chocolate. There were two soft armchairs with a small table separating them, several thick and fluffy blankets, soft pillows, and a shag carpet in front of the fireplace. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think we’ve been properly introduced,” he said at last, breaking the silence and getting her to turn towards him. “I’m Jughead.” </p><p> </p><p>“Betty,” she replied softly, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her sweatshirt. “And this is Caramel,” she added, holding the cat up for a moment for emphasis. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, come on, Betty,” he said. “I hope I can help you feel better than you do right now.” </p><p> </p><p>She smiled at him, a single tear slipping out of her eye when she tried to laugh. Her cat purred and settled in her hold. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered to him, linking a single arm with his and leaning into him. “Is this okay?” she asked. </p><p> </p><p>“So long as you’re comfortable, Betty.” He began walking them towards the armchairs, seating Betty in one of them. “Chamomile?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, please,” she said softly and with a sniffle, setting Caramel down. Jughead noticed that the cat looked eager to explore the room at first, but then decided it was better off with Betty. She’d crossed her legs in the armchair, allowing Caramel to jump into her lap, curling up in the space she’d created with her legs. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll bring some tissues, too.” Jughead could feel her smile searing through his back as he took out a teacup. He poured the tea, placing a saucer under it and taking it back to her along with a box of tissues. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, taking the cup and saucer, letting the tissues sit on the table separating the two chairs while she took a sip of her tea. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to get some coffee and I’ll be right back.” A moment later, Jughead returned, holding a cup of black coffee with a saucer under it. He seated himself in the armchair beside her, feeling the warmth of the fire. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to be distracted from your situation, or would you rather talk?” Jughead asked softly, trying to take the right approach. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’d rather talk,” she replied, Caramel sniffing up at the cup of tea curiously then putting her head back down when she realized what it was. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” he said after a moment, holding onto his cup and saucer. “What brings you out here at this time of night?”</p><p> </p><p>“I could ask you the same thing,” she replied, smiling a little. “But seriously… my parents sent me a Howler in the mail this morning. I knew exactly what it was going to say, so I ran to the girls’ bathroom and opened it there.” She paused for a moment, Jughead noting that she was probably remembering what her parents had said. “I’m sorry… you’re not here to hear my sob story.” She set her teacup and saucer next to the box of tissues, stroking Caramel’s head gently. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” he said quickly. “But we have similar situations, apparently… please…” he added. “What did they say?” She sighed before she continued. </p><p> </p><p>“They went out of their way to inform me that I was the first member of my family in five generations to not be sorted into Slytherin,” she muttered. “They said that I shamed them, that there must have been a mistake… and then they said that I was a mistake, that I was bringing them nothing but disappointment… </p><p> </p><p>“On top of that, Charles and Polly won’t talk to me--” </p><p> </p><p>“Who?” Jughead asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Charles is my brother. He’s a fifth year and a Slytherin prefect. Polly is my sister, a third year. They won’t speak to me because I’m in a rival House or something, or because my parents told them not to.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry, Betty,” Jughead whispered. “That’s seriously terrible.” </p><p> </p><p>“And besides that, two of my best friends ended up in Slytherin last night. I’ve been best friends with them ever since we were little, and we’ve been waiting to get into Slytherin together since we were five but now…” </p><p> </p><p>“That dream’s gone for you guys,” Jughead finished. Betty nodded, taking another sip of her tea. </p><p> </p><p>“But at least I still have Caramel,” she joked quickly before their conversation got back on track. </p><p> </p><p>“You know you were a hatstall last night?” he asked, trying to change the subject and (hopefully) lighten her mood. Betty nodded again. </p><p> </p><p>“I could feel that I was holding it all up,” she admitted. “It was a three-way stall.” </p><p> </p><p>“What Houses?” Jughead asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw.” </p><p> </p><p>“So… Slytherin wasn’t even in the question for you, was it?” </p><p> </p><p>“Not really… I kept trying to tell the Sorting Hat that I needed to be in Slytherin, but it kept telling me that I was better off literally anywhere else. I tried for so long, but it eventually said I needed to let it go. It assured me that I was nothing like the rest of my cunning family, so Slytherin wasn’t an option.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’d hope he would say that to you,” Jughead said out of the blue. Betty looked confused for a moment. “What I mean is that no matter how much you love your family, it seems that you’re better than them. The Sorting Hat didn’t seem to want you to have to associate with your family like that.” </p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” she scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“All I mean is that your parents sent a Howler, mad about what <em> Hogwarts House </em> you got into of all things. They could have sent a letter that asked you how you were doing after being separated from your friends,” he said. “Your siblings are either petty or listening to those same parents that caused you to run to the girls’ bathroom this morning to open your Howler from them,” Jughead explained. “Maybe you’re just… a better person than them, y’know?” </p><p> </p><p>“I guess…” Betty replied. “On top of that, I really don’t feel like a Gryffindor.” </p><p> </p><p>“They say the hat’s never wrong.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not brave, Jughead,” she said. “I don’t take risks, I’m not daring--” </p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re braver than you know, Betty,” he replied. “You reached out to me yesterday - twice - after I was down, literally and figuratively.” She blushed and laughed a little. “I’m not surprised your friends are Slytherins and you aren’t, Betty. Out of all three of you, you were the only one to come and help me up afterwards. You brought me a lunchbox full of food after Reggie was out of place…” Jughead noticed that Betty was watching him now, her bright green eyes gazing into his blue ones. “And you’ve survived that family of yours for eleven years. I think that takes enough bravery, Betty. Maybe there’s more of that in there than you know.” She smiled at him. “Plus, you risked House points to find this place. Sounds like a Gryffindor to me.” She giggled. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey! You did too!” she interjected, laughing a little. </p><p> </p><p>“Well… touché, Cooper.” They both smiled for a few seconds, relishing in the small dose of happiness. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Jug,” she said softly. “That means a lot.” </p><p> </p><p>“I also think that if you can get past this awful Howler your folks sent you… that you’d be a bit feisty, back to your happy-go-lucky self.” </p><p> </p><p>Betty looked curiously at him and Jughead suddenly felt the urge to backtrack. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh… what I mean is--” </p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s okay,” she said, giggling with a hint of blush on her face as Caramel stretched in her lap a little and purred. “Please, indulge me. You think I’m feisty?” </p><p> </p><p>“I think you could be the type, yes,” Jughead clarified. Betty flushed a little more, the rosiness flooding her cheeks. They both smiled and chuckled a little. Jughead changed the subject. “Well… was there anything else in that letter worth talking about?” </p><p> </p><p>“My parents said that if I wasn’t going to be in Slytherin, then I should at least get on quidditch so I’m doing something that <em> glorifies their name,” </em> Betty explained, nearly spitting out the last few words. “The thing is, I wanted to get onto a quidditch team in the first place. Now they’re just spoiling it.” </p><p> </p><p>“You play quidditch?” Jughead asked hopefully. </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> love </em> quidditch, much like everyone else in this school,” Betty replied. “And it’s a ginormous thing in my family. The lot of us are quidditch players, my brother and sister included, a beater and a keeper respectively on the Slytherin team.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s awesome!” Jughead cheered. “What position are you?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m a seeker,” she said, smiling again. “Best in my club league five years running.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve always wanted to be a seeker,” Jughead admitted. “But everyone seems to think I’m a little too tall for that.” Even when he was a kid, he had long, lanky legs. He was a stick, almost, but he was tall too. “I’m a chaser.” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s definitely not easy being a seeker, if you really wanted to know,” Betty replied. “Bludgers are always flying at you, especially if the other team knows you’re good… But the quidditch pitch is the only place I could really escape my family back home,” she said, a hint of sadness in her voice. “I can concentrate easier with my head almost literally in the clouds, even with all of the bludgers. I was kinda pushed into it at first, but I ended up loving it. Besides, when you’re up so high above the pitch, you can’t hear your parents criticizing your broom grip.” </p><p> </p><p>They both laughed, allowing smiles to slip onto their faces. </p><p> </p><p><em> This is going to be a good end to a bad day, </em> Jughead thought to himself, offering to refill Betty’s teacup. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>---</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Conversation flowed quite easily that night with all of the similarities Jughead found between them. They were both quidditch lovers (Betty preferred the Appleby Arrows and the Holyhead Harpies), their parents kinda sucked towards them besides Jughead’s mom, and their parents didn’t seem to approve of where they’d been placed House-wise. They both had animal friends (Jughead told Betty about Hot Dog, his smaller snowy owl, and then Betty told Jughead about how prissy Caramel could be and how she only liked specific foods). </p><p> </p><p>When Betty was smiling and laughing more than on the verge of tears, Jughead told Betty how he’d gotten a Howler too, but he hadn’t known what a Howler was… so he ended up opening it in the Great Hall that morning. Betty thought that was funny, and for once Jughead saw the humor in the situation, but it was comforting that she definitely understood what he was going through. He hadn’t heard from his mom yet, but he didn’t think that she would share the same sentiments as his father did. </p><p> </p><p>“I still think I’m better off where I ended up,” Jughead said after a while. “I never really wanted to be in Slytherin. That’s just what my dad wanted. I was kind of nervous about it at first, but I met Toni Topaz, who’s another Ravenclaw, and I met Archie. You’ve met him, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“Archie’s been really nice to me,” Betty replied, sipping a cup of hot chocolate now. “I don’t think there’s anyone else that’s been as nice as he has until you came along tonight… My cousin, Cheryl, told me about this place.” </p><p> </p><p>“She’s the red-headed one, right?” Jughead asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. We’ve known each other since we were in diapers,” Betty said. “My other best friend coming in is Veronica. She’s got darker hair, but she’s absolutely awesome… and they <em> both </em> ended up in Slytherin…” </p><p> </p><p>“So now you feel a little lonely?” Jughead asked. She nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“But Archie’s really nice. So’s Midge,” Betty added. “But Reggie…” </p><p> </p><p>“He’s a bit of a blockhead,” Jughead said. Betty nodded again. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s putting it nicely,” she replied. “He didn’t seem to like that a Cooper was a Gryffindor, even though my family isn’t the one that was connected to the Death Eaters. That’s the <em> Blossoms. </em> We split from them because we didn’t want to work with… <em> you know who </em> during the second war,” Betty explained, stroking Caramel’s head. “Somehow I’ll get him to shut up.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you will,” Jughead said with a grin. Betty smiled back at him for a moment. Jughead was suddenly flustered with Betty smiling at him like that. “Uh… you know how to play wizard’s chess?” he asked, spotting a board. “We can play if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d love to,” she replied. They both sat on the shag carpet as Jughead moved the board between them. Betty chose to cover her crossed legs with a fluffy blanket before they started to play, letting Caramel sit next to her. They kept talking the entire time while Caramel looked as if she wanted to get on the board and swipe all of the pieces off. </p><p> </p><p>“Looking forward to any classes?” Jughead asked, eager to learn anything he could about the mysterious Betty Cooper. “I want to get to third year already so I can take Care of Magical Creatures.” </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m most interested in Charms and Defense, mostly,” Betty said, eyeing Caramel to make sure she was behaving herself. “I want to learn spells, I think that’s pretty cool. Potions seems good too with Slughorn… I think I’ll get into any class once I start.” </p><p> </p><p>“Same here,” Jughead replied. “Flying class should be good too.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, definitely,” Betty said. “I want to get back on a broom. It calms my nerves.” </p><p> </p><p>“You think we’d play quidditch in flying class by chance?” Jughead asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe once Madam Hooch thinks we’re capable of handling the basics,” she replied. “Checkmate.” She grinned, sitting back. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin, I thought I had that one.” Caramel padded over to Jughead, rubbing herself against Jughead’s arm. </p><p> </p><p>“I think she likes you,” Betty giggled, smiling at her cat interacting with the boy. Jughead let her sniff his hand before he rubbed her head. </p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re right,” he replied as Caramel got bored and went back to Betty, curling in her lap once again. </p><p> </p><p>“Go again?” Betty asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Why not.” </p><p> </p><p>Betty and Jughead traded winning back and forth pretty easily, laughing and smiling into the night (even though Caramel’s paw sneakily jabbed at all of Betty’s pieces, throwing them off the board; they had a good laugh at that, deciding to start over). At one point they stopped because the chess pieces seemed to need a break from getting smashed against each other, so they resorted to simply talking again, Caramel sitting between them. </p><p> </p><p>When the subject of wands came up out of the blue, Jughead began talking about wand lore. For once, someone found it interesting <em> with </em> him. Betty was fascinated with all of the information he knew of wand woods and cores. He asked to see her wand for a moment, if she had it on her, and she handed it over for him to look at. They sat before the toasty fireplace, warming their bodies as they sat closer to look at Betty’s wand a little better. Caramel then decided that they pair was boring, deciding instead to take a look around the room.</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s alder wood, but it’s definitely a phoenix feather core,” Betty whispered to him while Jughead inspected it. “Thirteen inches and… what was it? Pliable? I think that’s how Mr. Andrews described it. Pliable.” </p><p> </p><p>“That’s definitely an interesting combination,” Jughead commented, admiring the detailing in the wood. “But I think it suits you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“The wood definitely tells you more about a witch or wizard than it lets on,” he said, handing Betty her wand back. She put it back where it came from. “Mr. Ollivander wrote a book on wand lore before he passed. You should check it out. They might offer it in the library.” </p><p> </p><p>“What’s your wand made of?” she asked curiously. Jughead pulled it from his sleeve, handing it to the blonde. </p><p> </p><p>“Ebony and dragon heartstring, 11 ¼ inches, and rigid,” he listed off the qualities while she noticed the small swirls on the handle. </p><p> </p><p>“This is a gorgeous wand,” she said. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” he replied when she handed it back, pushing it back up his sleeve. “I can’t really take credit though, can I? The wand chooses the wizard.” He reclined against his armchair slightly. </p><p> </p><p>“True,” she replied, sitting back next to him. </p><p> </p><p>Betty was right next to him now, their legs almost touching each other. They were covered by the same blanket, admiring the same crackling fireplace, even though Caramel had climbed back into Betty’s lap again. Jughead was almost so comfortable with Betty that he could have wrapped an arm around her shoulders if he wanted to, but he didn’t want to push his luck all in one night. </p><p> </p><p>When he looked over at Betty, he realized that she was still fiddling with that one slip of red paper. He realized it was charred around the edges, like it had been set on fire. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s that?” Jughead asked, pointing to the piece of paper. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s uh…” she hesitated. Jughead wanted to backtrack his words again, sorry he’d asked, but he waited for Betty’s answer. “It’s one of the pieces from the Howler my parents sent me… after it blew up, of course,” she said, turning it over in her fingers a little quicker before she showed him the single phrase written on the scrap of parchment. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You’re a disappointment, Elizabeth Cooper.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jughead was suddenly enraged at the Coopers. His blood was boiling at a single written phrase on a piece of red parchment meant to degrade Betty for things that were out of her control. So what if she was a Gryffindor? That just meant she tried to be a good person and tried to take the better way through her problems, not the shortcuts when they were convenient. </p><p> </p><p>“I think you should scrap it,” Jughead whispered, surprisingly calm for how angry he was at her parents. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” she asked, her green eyes looking up into his blue ones for the thousandth time that night. </p><p> </p><p>“Betty, your parents aren’t nice people. I know they’re still your parents, but here… at Hogwarts they can’t touch you. You’re from England, right?” Betty nodded just after Caramel went exploring again. “They can’t Apparate up here. You’re safe from them here.” Jughead took her hand without entwining their fingers. “To hell with what they say. You can be your best self here. You can do what you want here. They’ll just have to deal with their feisty, brave, no- dragon-shit-taking daughter for once, hopefully in the right way.” </p><p> </p><p>Betty was smiling at him now because of his words. Jughead was proud of himself in that moment. He’d managed to make her entire mood do a 180 degree turn with a few sentences. </p><p> </p><p>“Go on,” Jughead said then, removing his hand from Betty’s with a gentle squeeze and motioning forward. “Throw that piece of paper in the fire.” Betty giggled and smiled a little as she got up. Jughead watched from his spot on the floor as she walked across the stone floor. Her shoes were long forgotten somewhere in the room, revealing her socks: baby blue with small golden snitches dotted on them. She stopped in front of the large fireplace and Jughead locked his eyes on the small piece of red parchment. It fluttered towards the orange flames in front of her, eventually landing on a burning log and crumpling itself into ash. </p><p> </p><p>They both watched it burn completely before Betty went to sit by Jughead again. They sat in silence for a moment before Betty spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>“That was extremely cathartic,” she whispered, looking up at him. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” he muttered. “It was.” </p><p> </p><p>They watched the logs burn in front of them while they sat in silence, Betty drinking tea again and Jughead with a cup of black coffee. They sat and drank, a fluffy blanket covering their legs, their shoulders touching. It was all so comforting after the day Jughead had, and he hoped it was the same for Betty after all she’d been through. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Jughead said after a while. It was getting close to 1AM. Betty looked curiously at him again, Caramel sitting by her side. “I wanted to say thanks for the lunchbox on the train,” he whispered. “And for helping me up after I stumbled all over myself.” </p><p> </p><p>“It was no problem, really,” she replied. </p><p> </p><p>“No, but seriously, do you want that lunchbox back or-- <em> Merlin, that’s hot!” </em> </p><p> </p><p>Jughead jumped up, setting his coffee cup to the side. He realized he’d spilled some of the scalding liquid on his torso and was now trying to find a napkin or something to absorb the rest of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin’s beard, Jug, d’you need help with that?” Betty asked after a beat, standing up and putting her teacup down. She was approaching him when he said something else. </p><p> </p><p>“No, I think I’ve got it now,” he said, wiping his front and blotting the coffee as best he could. “It’s just my Jones luck. I’ll put all this in the laundry later but--” </p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Betty said, stopping him. “What did you just say?” </p><p> </p><p>“This sweatshirt’s gotta go to the laundry?” </p><p> </p><p>“No, the thing before that,” Betty said, looking as if she could flip if Jughead said something wrong. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s just my… Jones luck?” Jughead said it as a question, unsure as to how it was important. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh no,” Betty sighed, backing away. “You’re a Jones?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah… Any other kid in this school named Forsythe?” Jughead muttered. “Why?” </p><p> </p><p>“Son of a banshee, what have I done?” Betty asked, looking around the room. She found her pink converse and sat in the armchair to put them on immediately. He and Caramel watched Betty curiously. “I’m so sorry, Jughead.” </p><p> </p><p>“Betty, what--” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m already on the edge with my parents, I… I can’t be here with you--” She slipped both of the shoes on quickly, then got up and started towards the door, scooping up Caramel in the process. </p><p> </p><p>“Betty, please--” </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t go making friends with a Jones,” she said over her shoulder, a hint of remorse in her voice as Jughead followed behind her. She stopped abruptly, Jughead almost crashing into her, before she added: “I’m so sorry. I really wish I could be your friend, but I value my life--” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead noted that she was almost on the verge of tears again. After the two hours they’d spent together, he imagined Betty would be some sort of upset if they had to part like this. </p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t we just talk about not caring what our parents say?” Jughead asked. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t understand!” she exclaimed, her voice thick and watery with emotions. Her brilliant green eyes turned glassy as she put Caramel down again. “You don’t know what they’ll do, Juggie,” she sobbed, shaking her head. “They’ll kill me. They will actually kill me.” </p><p> </p><p>“But you’re safe here,” Jughead whispered, stepping forward to take both of her hands in his. “We can be friends…” </p><p> </p><p>“We really can’t,” she whimpered. “I’m so sorry.” Jughead nodded, keeping his tongue in his cheek as Betty slipped her hands out of his and turned, making for the doorway. Caramel following her while he stood there, watching her go… and then she stopped. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Jughead?” she called to him with a sniffle. He was confused as to why she hadn’t left yet. Caramel was even sitting next to the door. “I really am sorry.” He nodded. “And… I hope you get on your House team at some point,” she said to him. “I know how hard it is in the first year.” Jughead nodded again, hanging onto her every word. “I wish it didn’t have to be this way, really.” </p><p> </p><p>At her last sentence, Jughead sighed, feeling every ounce of hope for a new friendship vanish. </p><p> </p><p>“Good luck,” he said anyways. “With everything.” </p><p> </p><p>Betty let out another (louder, this time) whimper, running to him. She met him in a bone breaking hug, her arms wrapped tightly around his torso. Jughead hugged her back, absorbing as much as he could of her warmth and noticing that she smelled of lavender. It was his new favorite smell in the entire world. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered, letting out another sob. “For helping me tonight.” </p><p> </p><p>Jughead didn’t respond. He only closed his eyes, relishing in the feel of Betty hugging him. </p><p> </p><p>“Just promise me one thing,” he said weakly. </p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” She whispered back. </p><p> </p><p>“If there’s a spot on the Gryffindor team for a seeker… promise you’ll try out.” </p><p> </p><p>“Jughead—“</p><p> </p><p>“Please, Betty. I want you to be happy. Quidditch makes you happy.” </p><p> </p><p>“I promise,” she said. “And Jug?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” </p><p> </p><p>“Promise you’ll watch me play if I get on?” </p><p> </p><p>“Promise.” He held her a little tighter. “If you ever need me, you know where to find me, Betts.” </p><p> </p><p>He felt her sigh, trying to hold back her tears, though she failed to do so. She didn’t respond as her body shook with silent sobs and she continued to hold onto him. Eventually she calmed down enough to breathe evenly, but she still didn’t say anything. </p><p> </p><p>At one point, he felt her pull away, the utter warmth leaving with her. She clicked to Caramel and heard as she picked her up. </p><p> </p><p>When Jughead finally looked up, Betty was gone. He was left standing in the Room of Requirement alone, cursing his last name, his father, and his grandfather. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <b>---</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Somehow, Jughead made it back into Ravenclaw Tower that night. He didn’t remember climbing back into bed, but he was woken by Ben the next morning because he’d ignored his alarm. The first year Ravenclaws went down to breakfast together that morning, Toni by Jughead’s side. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you go out and find the room I told you about?” she asked as they entered the Great Hall and navigated themselves over to their House table. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” he replied sleepily. </p><p> </p><p>“Anything good you’d like to report?” </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t wanna talk about it,” he said. “Maybe later.” </p><p> </p><p>“Suit yourself,” she shrugged, sitting down on the bench next to him. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead felt a little better after getting some breakfast in his system, loading up on bacon, toast, eggs, juice, whatever he could get his hands on. While he was nearly shoving food and coffee down his throat, Toni tried to engage herself in whatever Ethel was talking to Dilton about. </p><p> </p><p>After Jughead poured himself a third cup of coffee, the owl post flew into the Great Hall. Jughead rolled his eyes just before Hot Dog landed gently on his shoulder, remembering yesterday’s terrible occurrence. He groaned. </p><p> </p><p>“You have got to be kidding me,” he grumbled. “What in Merlin’s name did I do this time?” he asked, taking the letter from the snowy owl and tossing a piece of toast towards him. Hot Dog caught it in his beak and took off for the owlery again. Jughead wanted to slam his head on the table… maybe flip it if he was feeling chaotic. When he turned the envelope over, he saw that it was from his mom and he calmed instantly. The parchment wasn’t red so he sighed in relief and opened it. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Jughead,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’m sorry I couldn’t stop your father from sending that Howler yesterday. I can only imagine the outburst it caused at breakfast. I want you to know that your father doesn’t speak for Jelly and I in that Howler he sent.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Jelly is very happy for you, and she believes you’ll be right where you’re supposed to be in Ravenclaw (she shared this after I explained the difference between the Houses, but nevertheless). She really misses you reading to her, but I let her borrow some books from your room to keep her company.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I am also very excited for you, Jug, as I always thought that you wouldn’t be sorted into Slytherin. I think it’s a very good opportunity for you to change what people see when they hear the name Jones. I have no doubt that you’ll be great and that you’ll do great no matter where you end up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Love, Mom.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> P.S. If Ravenclaw is ever lucky enough to have you as a chaser, Jelly and I won’t be missing a single match!  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>When he finished reading the letter, Jughead folded up the parchment, tucking it into a pocket under his robes. For the first time in 24 hours, he was able to smile while he sat at the Ravenclaw table, feeling lucky for not following in his dad’s footsteps. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead took a look around the Great Hall, seeing students of all Houses enjoying themselves as they talked to their friends. Some of them were friends with people in other House. He looked across the room to see Betty, still with her head down. Just when he thought about maybe going to talk to her, Jughead watched as Veronica Lodge and Cheryl Blossom got up from their place at the Slytherin table, making a beeline for Betty. They tapped her on the shoulder and she turned her head to see her best friends. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead watched as she jumped up to hug them both, finally seeing a bright smile on her face as she introduced them to Archie. While Veronica started a conversation with the ginger boy, Betty glanced across the way, locking eyes with Jughead momentarily. </p><p> </p><p>He could feel time stop as she chanced a small wave and smile. He grinned in return, waving back to him. </p><p> </p><p><em> I think she’ll be just fine, </em> Jughead thought. <em> Maybe we can still be friends or something. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Little did Jughead know that the coming month would change all of that. </p><p> </p><p>Nearly two weeks after Hogwarts’ fall term had begun, it was announced that Elizabeth Cooper was to be the new Gryffindor seeker, the youngest student to make a quidditch team since Harry Potter himself. </p><p> </p><p>Jughead was left in the dust, watching from afar as Betty rose in popularity… And after a short time, it seemed as though Betty was far from his reach. </p><p> </p><p>He became the Ravenclaw loner of their year while Betty became the popular Gryffindor, their only tie being that Betty had the best marks in their year, Jughead right behind her. Neither told anyone about their encounter on their second night at Hogwarts, and neither forgot about it. </p><p> </p><p>Betty had kept her promise to him, so he was going to keep his promise to her, even if he was nonexistent in her life now. He was prepared to attend every Gryffindor quidditch match, even if he would rather brood in the library or his common room instead. </p><p> </p><p>Even though he planned on supporting the dreamy blonde, Jughead was very pessimistic that he and Betty would be friends again. After all, she was from a rich, aristocratic, pureblood family  that didn’t want anything to do with him. He lived in a trailer in the Scottish Highlands with his deadbeat dad. They were separated by two completely different worlds, unlikely to collide again. </p><p> </p><p>That was, until their sixth year…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
