    <p>Newt was four when the compass first flickered to life on his wrist. He’d been sat in the Hippogriff stables with his mother, watching her take care of the creatures in the gentle manner she always did. It had started off as a soft tingling which gradually grew into a sharp throbbing between his veins.</p><p>“Mum?” He said quietly.</p><p>“Give me a minute darling,” His mother, Theodora, smiled at her son as she brushed one of the Hippogriff’s hair.</p><p>Newt tried to wait patiently for her to be finished but the pain in his wrist was growing. It had turned from a slight throb to a full on burning sensation.</p><p>“Mum?” He tried again.</p><p>“Just a moment!”</p><p>Newt squeezed his eyes shut tightly, pressing his trembling lips together to stop himself from crying out in agony. His wrist was pulsing. Heat blistered in his bones, burning its way into his vein, his skin. His tooth sank into his bottom lip, blood welling instantly from the cut and a guttural sound came from his throat. Merlin’s beard it hurt! It hurt more than anything Newt had ever felt before.</p><p>“Mum!”</p><p>Theodora Scamander was over in a heartbeat, hands immediately reaching for her youngest son. A mother always knows when something is wrong with their child and Theodora knew from her son’s cry that something truly wasn’t right.</p><p>“Newt what is it? What’s wrong, sweetheart?”</p><p>“My wrist…” Newt whispered. “It’s burning,”</p><p>His mother moved to inspect his wrist. Newt winced as she brushed her thumb over the tender skin of his inner wrist. It was flushed scarlet and hot to the touch, Theodora’s eyes widened as she assessed the area.</p><p>“Newt, sweetheart – ”</p><p>“W… What’s wrong with me?” He shivered as the burning continued.</p><p>“Oh, darling, nothing! Nothing is wrong with you,”</p><p>“Why is my wrist hurting so much then? I stayed away from the griffs like you asked me to - ”</p><p>“It’s not an injury darling, you’re perfectly fine,”</p><p>Fine? Newt frowned and looked down at his wrist again. It was still hurting but the burning had reduced to a sting now. He stared at the stark redness lining his pale freckled skin, his eyes catching on a raised line in the centre of his wrist. An arrow.</p><p>“Mum, what – ”</p><p>“It’s a soul mark darling,” Theodora said as she held her son’s delicate little wrist in her hand. “It means your soulmate has just been born,”</p><p>“My soulmate?” Newt murmured as stared down fervently at the little arrow as it began to spin. “I… I don’t understand,”</p><p>Theodora pursed her lips as she tried to hold back her smile. For all her little boy’s cleverness there were still so many things new to him, and this was certainly one of them.</p><p>“A soulmate, Newt, is a person’s perfect other half. Your souls speak to each other in a way that others simply can’t,”</p><p>His soul? Newt stared at the arrow in wonderment, his eyes eagerly watching it spin.</p><p>“Why is it an arrow?”</p><p>“The mark is an arrow because it’s pointing the way to your soulmate, it will lead you to them one day,” Theodora smiled at him.</p><p>The arrow had slowed and stopped spinning on his wrist now, settling into a diagonal position downwards.</p><p>“South West,” His mother said as her thumb stroked over the mark.</p><p>“Are they very far away?” Newt questioned quietly, eyes fixated on his wrist.</p><p>“Only time will tell darling, the closer you get to them the more of a… pull you’ll feel towards them. Can you feel anything right now?”</p><p>He could. There was a soft yet muddled tug in his gut. A pull towards an unknown person in an unknown place. A part of him thought he should feel scared, frightened even of the idea of half of his soul belonging to another person, but all Newt could feel was warmth. Indescribable warmth. His little fingers instinctively curled towards his wrist, wanting to stroke the mark.</p><p>“How will I know its them Mum?” He breathed. “What if I miss them by accident?”</p><p>“When the time comes for that you’ll know, my dear. When you meet your soulmate your mark will glow a beautiful gold and remain that colour from then on. You’d never miss them darling,”</p><p>Newt nodded in understanding though the worry didn’t completely leave him. A soulmate… <em>His</em> soulmate. There was another tug in his tummy, an answer. He smiled gently at first and then his smile grew into a full on wobbly grin, his eyes dancing over his mark. Theodora beamed down at her little boy, squeezing him tightly in her arms. She suddenly jumped up and swung him up into the air. Newt shrieked with delight, giggles erupting from him.</p><p>“Come on my cherub,” Theodora grinned as she carried her son further into the stable. “We’ve still got a few more griffs to feed before dinner!”</p><p>“Yes mum!” His mother settled him onto the ground and went to feed the rest of the hippogriffs. Newt glanced at his wrist once more. His soulmate. Then with a wide smile he followed his mother further into the stables.</p><p>~</p><p>Across the Atlantic Ocean in a small wizarding hospital on the outskirts of New York city, Florence Goldstein held her new born baby girl in her arms.</p><p>“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?” She murmured to her husband, James, who was sat in a hospital chair beside her bed, head resting on folded arms at the side of the bed as he stared up at his wife and child.</p><p>“An absolute jewel,” He smiled at them both.</p><p>“Are we still agreed on the name?”</p><p>“Yeah, I think it suits her perfectly,”</p><p>Florence beamed at her husband and then turned her face down to look at her daughter.</p><p>“Hello there… little Porpentina,” She whispered in awe as her daughter wriggled in her arms. “Welcome to the world,”</p><p>The three of them sat in pure bliss. Florence and James stared unabashedly at the tiny bundle, both of them too enraptured to notice the small arrow etched onto the baby’s wrist. And when they did eventually notice, they’d see that the arrow was pointing North East.</p>
