    <p>She was starting to get truly annoyed with the man – if you could call him that, with his uncouth behaviour – sitting next to her. He wasn’t drunk. If he had been, at least then she could have understood some of his behaviour. Now, he was merely…vile.</p><p>As the inbred swine tried to put his hand on her leg for the umpteenth time, she could feel her anger about to boil over. She wasn’t averse to taking a man to her bed – or a woman, for that matter – but this one <em>wasn’t</em> a candidate.</p><p>Like a good, Pureblood witch, she had married Rodolphus Lestrange right after Hogwarts. He seemed nice enough in the beginning. There were sweet dinners, presents, murmured compliments; but after some time, restrictions had been added to that list. About two years into their marriage, he had made the mistake of hitting her.</p><p>Obviously, she was now a happy widow.</p><p>At least her fate had been solvable. Unlike her sister, who had encountered a rather large secret within the Malfoy family after she had married their son. It had been quite the shock, but she suited her husband and their lifestyle. Bellatrix had never stopped wishing them all the best.</p><p>She clenched her teeth as the man moved closer and reached out to touch her face; presumably to brush away a curl of her nigh untameable hair. She swore to Merlin and Morgana both that if he continued this path, she would—</p><p>“Fancy meeting you here!”</p><p>Bellatrix tensed as a girl pressed herself between the barstools – nearly toppling the one the man was sitting on – and exuberantly threw her arms around Bellatrix’s neck.</p><p>“Uhm, hello?” she answered.</p><p>“Sorry,” the girl whispered in her ear. “I heard your heart... You looked like you would kill him and since you look quite capable of doing so, I thought I’d intervene? I’m Hermione.”</p><p>Frowning, Bellatrix awkwardly answered the girl’s hug. ‘<em>I heard your heart’?</em></p><p>“Hermione! It’s been a while. Come, sit next to me. I’m sure this gentleman won’t mind finding himself another seat.”</p><p>She gave the man a <em>look</em> and he glared in response. He did get the hint, however, and sulked off, probably in search of another woman to paw at. Meanwhile, this Hermione girl had sat on the now free barstool.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” she said. “I thought I’d save the guy, even though whether or not he’s worthy of that is debatable. I’ll just sit here long enough to be convincing and then I’ll be off again.”</p><p>Bellatrix studied her. The girl’s clothes were a size too big but she had the curves of a woman. She looked gaunt, as if she hadn’t eaten properly in ages, but both her clothesand her body were clean. The brown, curly hair, which was undoubtedly normally as wild as Bellatrix’s, hung limp and dull around her shoulders.</p><p>“At least let me buy you a drink,” Bellatrix offered.</p><p>“Oh, no need, thank you.”</p><p>Something about the way she moved seemed awfully familiar.</p><p>“Have we met before?”</p><p>Hermione gave her a small smile. “Not that I know of,” she answered. Bellatrix saw her eyes stray slightly while she licked her lips. It was quickly cut short by a tiny shake of her head and a clenching of the hands in her lap. “I would have remembered.” Hermione continued, resolutely not looking at Bellatrix anymore.</p><p><em>‘I could hear your heart.’</em> Bellatrix narrowed her eyes as the pieces of the puzzle clicked together.</p><p>“How long has it been?” she asked.</p><p>A confused glance. “Since what?”</p><p>“Since you drank?”</p><p>Hermione glanced at her again, suspicion now visible in her eyes. “What does it matter when I last drank water?” she answered. “Or are you referring to alcohol? Either way, I don’t see the point of asking such a question.”</p><p>“You know that’s not what I asked,” Bellatrix answered, leaning closer. She smiled as Hermione twitched, just a tad bit too fast for a mere human.</p><p>“I think this has been long enough to convince your would-be suitor.  I’ll be going now.”</p><p>Grabbing her arm as soon as Hermione jumped from the barstool, Bellatrix refused to let her go. “You look starved,” she said. “Well, parched really, if we’re being technically correct.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Please let me go.”</p><p>Bellatrix stood and moved closer, leaving only a hair’s width between their bodies, knowing full well how her scent would envelop Hermione.</p><p>“Don’t you want a taste?” she whispered in the girl’s ear.</p><p>Hermione shivered and Bellatrix used the opportunity to put a hand on Hermione’s hip.</p><p>“I don’t know what you are talking about.” Hermione repeated through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Don’t you?” She moved closer, pressing her chest against Hermione’s back. “You can hear my heart and I’m sure, when standing this close, you can <em>feel</em> it beating, feel the blood rushing through my veins. I know what you are, Hermione.”</p><p>“I’m not a monster.”</p><p>Bellatrix startled at the sudden vehemence in Hermione’s voice. She had grown stiff, almost unmoving, and was barely breathing. In fact, Bellatrix wasn’t entirely sure the girl <em>was</em> breathing and not merely rising and falling her chest to keep up pretences.</p><p>“Of course not,” Bellatrix answered.</p><p>“Then let me go!” Hermione turned around, danger flashing in her eyes. “I will not succumb to this, this <em>evil</em> inside me!”</p><p>Bellatrix pulled back a little. “Evil?” she said, reaching up to cup Hermione’s face. “My dear, dear girl. Who told you it’s evil?”</p><p>“Nobody needed to tell me.”</p><p>With a smirk, Bellatrix moved closer again, placing her lips against Hermione’s ear. She could feel the woman freeze into the perfect replica of a statue.</p><p>“I get off on it, you know,” she whispered in Hermione’s ear. “That feeling of fangs sinking into my flesh, being at someone’s mercy while offering them what they need to survive.”</p><p>Hermione finally tore away from her, taking a step back, her movement causing a slight blur that had a couple of heads turning. A wand had appeared in her hand.</p><p>“Stop mocking me!” Hermione hissed. “I will survive differently; I’ll find a way!”</p><p>Again, Bellatrix was taken aback.</p><p>“Girl, how did you get through Hogwarts with this attitude? Or did you go to Durmstrang?”</p><p>Hermione tossed her hair. “I got through Hogwarts just fine, thank you very much. I got twelve N.E.W.Ts, not that they’ll do me much good now. This is a… recent development.”</p><p>“Recent?” Bellatrix echoed. “Then where is your sire?”</p><p>“What sire?”</p><p>“You were left behind?” For a second time that evening, Bellatrix could feel her anger rising. Her lips twitched as she saw Hermione grip her wand tighter in response. “Let me pay my tab,” she said after a couple of breaths, “you’re coming with me.”</p><p>“And why would I do that? I told you I won’t—“</p><p>“Not for <em>that</em>. We’re going to get this fixed.”</p><p>“You- You can fix me?” Hermione asked, her voice small, hopeful, and on the verge of breaking.</p><p>Bellatrix bit her lip, cursing herself for her choice of words. “Just the <em>situation</em>, girl. There’s no turning you back into a human, I’m afraid,” she carefully said.</p><p>“Oh… Well, in that case, I don’t need your help! I’ll be fine on my own.”</p><p>“No, you won’t. If you go on like this, you’ll end up going on a rampage. You’ll kill more people than you can count.”</p><p>“What do you know?” Hermione sneered.</p><p>“More than you think, missy.” She dropped some gold on the counter, not bothering to check if she was overpaying or not. “Now come with me. I want you to meet some people, though I use that term loosely.”</p><p>She grabbed Hermione by the arm and was surprised by the lack of struggle as she guided her out onto the street. Part of her expected an attempted escape once they were outside, but it seemed all fight had left her</p><p>Stepping into a side alley, Bellatrix firmed her grip on Hermione’s arm and Disapparated to her manor. Once there, she grabbed the floo powder and stepped into the fireplace, still tugging Hermione along. “Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>As soon as they stepped out of the fireplace in Malfoy Manor’s receiving room, the sounds of people moaning assaulted their ears. Bellatrix rolled her eyes while Hermione’s grew a size larger.</p><p>“Where—“ Hermione started to say, but she was interrupted as the door to the room opened.</p><p>“Bella! Oh, I see you’ve brought a guest.”</p><p> The room was quickly made soundproof.</p><p>“How many times have I told you to permanently soundproof this room, Cissy?” Bellatrix asked by way of greeting.</p><p>“The wards come down as soon as the Floo recognises you, my dear,” Narcissa answered, smiling sweetly. “We wouldn’t want you to miss out on the fun, now would we?”</p><p>“That was a lot of fun, judging from the sounds,” Bellatrix answered dryly. “You missed a spot, by the way.”</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>Narcissa quickly conjured a mirror to check her appearance, brushing away the speck of blood she had missed on her chin. After, she turned towards Hermione, who was wildly staring at her.</p><p>“Who did you bring with you, Bella?” Narcissa tilted her head and narrowed her eyes. “She’s young.”</p><p>“She was abandoned.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Bellatrix threw her hands up as Narcissa’s eyes flashed dangerously, her nails grew out into claws, and her fangs extended to press into her lower lip. “It’s why I brought her here. She’s got this notion that she’s evil. Won’t drink.”</p><p>They both turned to see how Hermione was taking this, only to see the girl had closed her eyes and was shivering. The muscles in her arms and legs were clenching and unclenching while her nostrils flared.</p><p>“Hermione?” Bellatrix enquired.</p><p>Upon hearing her name, she stumbled backwards, towards the Floo. “I need to- I need to leave.”</p><p>“She’s starved,” Narcissa commented.</p><p>“I told you, she won’t drink.”</p><p>Narcissa regarded her sister. “And you didn’t offer?”</p><p>“I did; she still refuses.”</p><p>“Please, please let me leave,” Hermione said brokenly from beside the fireplace. “This is too much- too much-“ Her nostrils flared again.</p><p>“I can’t let you go like this. Hermione, was it?”</p><p>When the girl didn’t respond, Narcissa looked at Bellatrix for confirmation. After a nod from the latter, Narcissa moved to crouch in front of the distressed girl.</p><p>“You need to drink, Hermione,” she said.</p><p>“No!” Hermione vehemently responded. Her eyes had turned almost completely black, a sure sign she could smell the blood flowing only two doors down the hall.</p><p>“You’ll go into a frenzy if you don’t drink. You’ll kill many if you let it get that far.”</p><p>“I won’t be a monster! I’m not evil!”</p><p>Narcissa raised an eyebrow. “You’re saying I’m evil?”</p><p>“She doesn’t know any better, Cissy,” Bellatrix intervened, knowing the meaning of that look.</p><p>“Who are your parents, girl?” Narcissa demanded.</p><p>“You wouldn’t know them.”</p><p>“You would be surprised,” Narcissa answered, “of how many in the wizarding world I know.”</p><p>Hermione bared her teeth, fangs showing, causing Narcissa to narrow her eyes. “I’m Muggleborn.”</p><p>“Oh, Circe’s tits!” Bellatrix exclaimed.</p><p>Narcissa snorted. “Eloquent as ever, dear sister.”</p><p>“Thanks, Cissy,” Bellatrix responded dryly. “But you do know what that means, right? She’ll know even less than the average witch.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes flashed towards Bellatrix. “I know enough! I’ve consulted books.”</p><p>Narcissa laughed, the tinkling sound almost jarring in the tense atmosphere. “Which books, little witch? ‘<em>Vampires and their History</em>’ by Amanda Trueheart? ‘<em>The Meaning of Fang</em>s’ by Edward Callen? You know nothing, girl.”</p><p>“Cissy!” Bellatrix admonished. “We need her to cooperate. Stop insulting her…even if you are right.”</p><p>“I’m not deaf, you know!”</p><p>Bellatrix looked at Hermione and repeated what she just said in her head. <em>Yeah, probably shouldn’t have added that last part</em>.</p><p>“Let go of whatever you think you know about vampires, girl,” Narcissa continued, ignoring the exchange. “It’ll do you no good. And you need to <em>feed</em>.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Perhaps you should get Lucius in here,” Bellatrix offered. “He could compel her?”</p><p>Narcissa looked over her shoulder at her sister. “That would only increase her resistance afterwards.” She returned to Hermione. “Stop being so stubborn,” she reprimanded her. “You can hardly keep control now; can’t you imagine what will happen once you lose it?”</p><p>For the first time, there was fear in Hermione’s eyes. “I don’t want to kill anybody.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you when to stop, dear,” Narcissa answered. “I believe my sister here will be a willing recipient.”</p><p>Bellatrix started unbuttoning her blouse. Blood was so difficult to wash out and with Hermione being newly turned, it was sure to get messy. Yet, there was something to be said about the enthusiasm that was sure to follow the initial bite.</p><p>“And pull me off when I don’t listen?” Hermione squeaked.</p><p>“I’ll pull you off if need be.”</p><p>Hermione turned to watch Bellatrix, her eyes riveted on the vain pulsing in her neck. Bellatrix tilted her head in invitation; still, the girl remained frozen. Sighing, Narcissa stood and walked over to her sister to stand behind her right shoulder.</p><p>“She’ll be uncontrolled, Bella,” Narcissa whispered in her ear. Bellatrix shivered and could easily envision Narcissa’s knowing smile. “Let’s get this started then, shall we?” Bellatrix trembled again as Narcissa placed a hand on Bellatrix’s abdomen and pulled her close. A gasp escaped her as one of Cissy’s claws punctured the side of her neck and drew a fiery line.</p><p>Faster than the blink of an eye, Hermione was pressed against her. Bellatrix hissed as Hermione’s fangs sunk wildly into her neck. Both moaned when the blood started flowing and Hermione started sucking.</p><p>Bellatrix wrapped her arms around the vampire’s trembling body, wishing they could do more, wishing they were both naked. Hermione’s claws were scratching her side and shoulder, but Bellatrix didn’t care; it all added up to the exquisite overload of sensory input that was part of being bitten.</p><p>It felt so incredibly <em>good</em>.</p><p>“You’re enjoying this too much, dear sister,” Narcissa whispered into her ear.</p><p>Bellatrix paid her no mind. She knew both women could smell her arousal. Hermione, however, was too engrossed in her first taste of blood to truly notice, and Bellatrix had joined more than enough revels at the Malfoy estate for Narcissa to care.</p><p>It was more probable that Cissy wanted a taste herself, having been interrupted in her own amusement. She wouldn’t do it though. Vampires did not drink from their still-human relatives. Even among vampires, incest was frowned upon.</p><p>“That’s enough, Hermione,” Narcissa finally said firmly.</p><p>Both Hermione and Bellatrix moaned in dismay.</p><p>Narcissa rolled her eyes. “You’re going to let yourself be bled out one day, Bella dear. Now, let go Hermione; you’ve had your fill. Lick the wound so it won’t scar.”</p><p>Bellatrix shivered again as Hermione’s tongue delicately slid over the lacerations she had caused. It made her skin tingle in a most delightful way. Almost like aftershocks of orgasm. Bellatrix sagged against her sister, breathing hard, and watched Hermione take a step back.</p><p>The girl’s eyes were quickly turning back into their natural colour – a honey-tinted brown. She seemed to return to her senses as intelligence returned to her gaze. Her eyes widened in shock, her hands flew to her mouth.</p><p>“No!” she whispered, stepping further back. “No! NO! What did I do! What did I—”</p><p>She was interrupted as the door opened. “Cissy, darling, what’s taking you so long?” Lucius Malfoy, tall and ridiculously handsome, strode into the room. His eyes turned towards Hermione. “Well, hello. Who might you be?”</p><p>Bellatrix could see Narcissa roll her eyes as her sister handed her back her shirt.</p><p>“Lucius, be a dear and put the girl to sleep before she breaks down completely. Not sure she’ll cooperate though.”</p><p>He gave his wife a questioning glance before returning his attention to the still mumbling Hermione.</p><p>“As you wish, Cissy.”</p><p>Hermione squealed as Lucius suddenly appeared in front of her. Bellatrix was long used to his speed, surpassing that of even Narcissa, courtesy of being a born vampire.</p><p>“Was my sister-in-law tasty, youngling?” he asked, cupping Hermione’s chin so she was forced to look at him.</p><p>Hermione started sobbing. “I’m evil! I’m <em>evil.</em>”</p><p>“Evil?” Lucius echoed, confused.</p><p>“Darling, if you’d please stop postponing?” Narcissa calmly requested.</p><p>Although she had seen this happen a couple of times before, Bellatrix still found it creepy to see Lucius’s gaze intensify – there was no better way of explaining it – and Hermione slump. He delicately picked her up in his arms.</p><p>“Shall I put her in one of the guest bedrooms and return?”</p><p>“If you would, please, Lucius.”</p><p>As he disappeared, Narcissa called for a house-elf to serve tea and biscuits. Bellatrix gratefully accepted the blood replenishing potion that she was offered. . It didn’t take long for Lucius to return and take a seat opposite them.</p><p>“The guests, Lucius?” Narcissa asked.</p><p>“Are either entertaining themselves or being entertained by Draco.”</p><p>The liberties within a vampire family still baffled Bellatrix, but she’d gotten used to it. At least enough not to be freaked out about it anymore.</p><p>“Our Bella is frowning again,” Lucius smirked.</p><p>“I’m only <em>human</em>, aren’t I,” she sniped back.</p><p>Narcissa shook her head and poured them all a cup of tea. One of those massively wrong ‘facts’ about vampires was the idea that they couldn’t eat or enjoy human food. They simply needed well, <em>more</em>, in order to sustain themselves. They also weren’t perpetually pale, even though the Malfoy’s fair skin proved nothing to the contrary.</p><p>“Where did you find her, Bella?” Narcissa asked. “And yes, you can eat those,” she continued as she saw Bellatrix eying the biscuits.</p><p>“In a pub in Knockturn Alley. And <em>she </em>found <em>me</em>, actually.” She took a bite of the biscuit. Chocolate chip. “A man was rather insistent in chatting me up. Hermione wedged herself between us and pretended to know me. Said she could hear my heart and then tried to cover it up by saying I looked willing and capable of killing the guy – which was true, by the way.”</p><p>“She told you she’s a vampire?” Narcissa asked, frowning at her husband who seemed to enjoy the idea of Bella murdering a man.</p><p>“No, I deduced it myself. I spend enough time around you to know how you move. And you saw her, Cissy, completely starved. She refused a drink but kept licking her lips and her eyes kept straying to my neck.”</p><p>“I bet you didn’t mind that,” Lucius commented.</p><p>Bellatrix grinned. “Not at all, until I confronted her about it and she freaked.”</p><p>“‘Freaked’?” Lucius questioned. “Is that what she meant with her earlier insistence of being evil?”</p><p>“She exclaimed she wasn’t a monster,” Bellatrix continued with a nod to Lucius. “That she wasn’t evil and refused to drink. When I asked her how she had managed to survive Hogwarts like that, she said being a vampire was a recent development.”</p><p>“Then where is her sire?” Lucius asked.</p><p>Bellatrix glanced at Narcissa, counting on her to keep Lucius’s anger in check. “No idea. From what I gathered, she’s never seen them. She was abandoned.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?!”</p><p>The teacups rattled on their saucers, as did the glass in the windowpanes and the bottles in the cabinet in the corner. In fact, the entire house shook at Lucius’s outburst. Narcissa was immediately beside him, placing a calming hand on his chest.</p><p>The door opened and Draco stuck in his head. “Father?”</p><p>“Go entertain our guests, Draco,” Narcissa said, her eyes not leaving those of her enraged husband. “It is nothing to worry about, we’ll explain later.”</p><p>The boy merely shrugged and closed the door.</p><p>“Lucius, dear, calm down,” Narcissa urged. “Bella brought her to us; we can help her.”</p><p>It was one of the most absolute, significant rules among vampires;  never, <em>ever</em>, leave behind those you sire. If you sire someone, you do so with a reason. They are forever your responsibility. As Narcissa had explained, it was impossible to sire by accident; it was always a choice. Other than being killed or captured right after siring, there was no acceptable reason at all to abandon a newly made vampire.</p><p>“I can’t drink my tea with the cups rattling, brother-in-law,” Bellatrix casually commented. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up at the power Lucius was emanating. Twice-damned <em>born</em> vampire. Was he forgetting she was human and therefore extremely susceptible to his rage? She was anything but a weak woman, but the urge to run and hide was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Lucius glared at her, then burst out laughing. “Only you could say such a thing at such a time, Bella.”</p><p>She didn’t answer, forcing her tensed up body to relax again as his angry energy dissipated around them.</p><p>Narcissa once more seated herself next to Bellatrix. “Now look at what you’ve done,” she accused Lucius. “You’ve completely tensed up Bella after she had such a good time with Hermione earlier.”</p><p>Bellatrix felt compelled to lean against her sister. “Cissy,” she ground out, resisting the urge, “turn off the Charm.”</p><p>Both Narcissa and Lucius laughed at her expense, but Bellatrix had to admit it had helped.</p><p>“Wait,” Lucius suddenly said, “you said she refused to drink. Did I misinterpret what I saw earlier?”</p><p>“No, we coaxed her into it,” Bellatrix answered.</p><p>“Her resistance was remarkable, certainly given how famished she was,” Narcissa supplied. “And given how she responded after, it won’t be easy to get the idea out of her head that she’s evil.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence where each was lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>“Did we tell you she’s Muggleborn?” It was Narcissa who broke their silence.</p><p>“<em>Muggleborn</em>?” Lucius exclaimed. “As if things weren’t complicated enough.”</p><p>“I’d say,” Bellatrix agreed.</p><p>Lucius turned towards her. “Do you know where she lives?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Than you better take her home with you. We can’t allow her to wander around.”</p><p>“You want me to babysit a vampire? You do realise humans live during the day, don’t you?”</p><p>“Come off it, Bella,” Narcissa said. “You’ve always been a night owl. Look at the time now.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“She can’t stay here,” Lucius added. “She would be too exposed to too much of our society right away. Which would be a problem if she’s so averse to it. It’s better to gradually introduce her.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“You live alone, sister. Wouldn’t you like to have some company? I’m quite certain the girl is pretty, once she wears some decent clothing.”</p><p>“I don’t have a choice, do I?”</p><p>“No,” both Malfoys confirmed.</p><p>“Bloody hell.”</p><p>Lucius grinned, then turned serious again. “I’ll ask around in the covens, see if someone’s missing.”</p><p>“Lucius…”</p><p>“I won’t mention her yet, Narcissa,” he said. “I’ll be careful.”</p><p>He stood and Narcissa quickly followed. Bellatrix was often envious of the ease and grace both possessed.</p><p>“We should re-join our guests,” Lucius said. “Would you care to join us, Bella?” he continued with a wink.</p><p>Narcissa swatted his arm. They were a liberal couple, like all vampires, but Narcissa drew a line where her sister was concerned. Bellatrix was conflicted about it. Part of her was attracted to Lucius (as all human women were) but he was also her sister’s husband and therefore off limits</p><p>“Lucius, behave!” she playfully admonished him.</p><p>“I wouldn’t know what you are talking about, dear.”</p><p>His wife shook her head and turned back to Bellatrix. “You are, of course, free to join. They’re all human, but given that Hermione already took her fill, it wouldn’t be wise to be bitten again tonight anyway. I don’t doubt some of the men would be more than pleased to pleasure you.” A salacious wink followed.</p><p>“No, thank you,” Bellatrix declined. “Enough has happened already today. I think I’ll be heading home.”</p><p>“Then I’ll come along and help you get the girl settled in.” Narcissa patted Lucius’s chest. “Go ahead, dear, I’ll be there shortly.”</p><p>He bent down to press a kiss to her lips. “I’m counting on it,” he murmured before disappearing through the door.</p><p>“Let’s Apparate, shall we,” Narcissa said. “You know how I dislike the Floo.”</p><p>Bellatrix nodded her assent. Narcissa had once told her she found it highly unsettling to use the one thing they were most vulnerable too as a means of travel.</p><p>“Why don’t you head for the gates? I’ll be right there with Hermione.”</p><p>With a harrumph, Bellatrix agreed again. Not long after, they found themselves walking up the drive to the Lestrange Manor.</p><p>“I used to be stronger than you,” Bellatrix growled at her sister, who was easily carrying Hermione in her arms.</p><p>“So you keep reminding me.” Narcissa glanced at her. “You know the offer still stands.”</p><p>“I’d rather be the one bitten than the one doing the biting, thank you.”</p><p>She opened the door and, after ushering Narcissa in, ordered the house elves to prepare one of the guest rooms. They immediately went about their business and Narcissa and she followed them upstairs in a more leisurely pace.</p><p>“How long will she be asleep?” Bellatrix asked as they entered the guest room. The elves had already changed the bedding and were now dusting and polishing every surface they could find. “This will do for now,” Bellatrix ordered, “you can finish your cleaning some other time.”</p><p>“I’d guess until tomorrow night,” Narcissa replied to Bellatrix’s earlier question. She placed Hermione on the bed.</p><p>“She looks dead,” Bellatrix observed.</p><p>“We all look dead when we sleep.”</p><p>“People move while sleeping, Cissy.”</p><p>“She isn’t exactly <em>people</em>.”</p><p>“Right…it’s just...she looks innocent though.”</p><p>“She probably is.” There was a small moment of silence as both watched the sleeping Hermione. “Well,” Narcissa finally said, “I’ll be heading back. There was this one, very sculpted, black-haired stud who smelled really nice.” She licked her lips. “I hope Lucius didn’t steal him away from me.”</p><p>“Ugh! Too much information Cissy!”</p><p>“Don’t be such a prude, Bella. You certainly aren’t when you join us.”</p><p>“Get out of my house, Cissy.”</p><p>“Are you rescinding my invitation?” Narcissa asked coyly.</p><p>“I’m starting to feel really tempted.”</p><p>Narcissa laughed. “I’ll be out of your hair then. Be sure to bring the girl for tea tomorrow night.”</p><p>She all but disappeared from Bellatrix’s side. The latter shook her head, still watching Hermione. What was she to do now? With a sigh, she started removing the girl’s shoes and socks. After some debate, she also struggled to remove the awful sweater before tucking her under the sheets. Thank Merlin the Malfoy elves had already cleaned the girl of blood.</p><p> </p>
