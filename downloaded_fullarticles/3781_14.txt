    <p class="western" align="LEFT">When Lupin, Potter, and Pettigrew walked into the classroom, Sirius raised his eyebrows. They looked like hell. Potter was visibly limping and sporting a shiny black eye. Pettigrew's shirt was buttoned incorrectly, and he was wearing odd shoes. Lupin had dark shadows under his eyes, like he hadn't slept in years, and a new pink scratch had joined the white scars already on his face. All of them seemed exhausted, but oddly, they were all smiling. Maybe they'd fought a hippogriff and won.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius wasn't the only one staring at the latecomers. Whispers spread through the full classroom as they walked in, but died down quickly when Professor Kovac cleared his throat. Next to Sirius, Snape scribbled down today's date. He underlined it three times, and drew a question mark next to it.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Abruptly, he looked up at Sirius and his face held that eerily determined look he usually reserved for potion making. Snape's obsession – and it was an obsession no matter what he said – with Potter and his mates had grown considerably in the past year. Sirius had noticed him recording their every move in a special journal and mumbling to himself late at night. It was unsettling. Snape had always been a creepy person, but this was a new level.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“He'll be out tonight,” Snape whispered, as Professor Kovac stood up to address the class.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius barely held off his sigh as he turned to face the front. He had been dragged into Snape's obsession. He wasn't the least bit interested in those tossers from Gryffindor, if he was honest. The only one who held his interest for longer than a moment was that pretty-boy Lupin, and Sirius never let himself dwell on his existence for too long.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape had recruited Sirius to follow them. He'd been following them around the grounds for three weeks now, and he'd found absolutely nothing. Yeah, they pulled pranks, and yeah, they stole from the kitchens, but what fifth year didn't do that? Plus, anytime he followed them, they always managed to disappear down some corner or into some random classroom and he lost track of them. He was convinced they knew he was following them. They weren't exactly stupid.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Professor Kovac was stood next to a blackboard with the words <em>Shield Spell </em>written on it.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He clapped his hands together once to get their attention, and said, “Today, we're practising the shield spell.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">There was an audible groan through the classroom. Kovac held up his hands with a smile, “I know, I know, it's not the most interesting spell. But it's really important, and I've seen you guys duel outside, you all need this spell.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">He waved his wand at the chalkboard and the words <em>Protego Duo </em>began to appear, “<em>Protego Duo </em>is much more powerful than the simple incantation <em>Protego. </em>It can be used in a lot of situations, but typically, it's used to defend oneself and other people. Everyone into partners.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius stood up and moved to the back of the room with Snape. Kovac used his wand to move the tables and chairs out of the way, clearing the floor for their duels.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape leant towards Sirius, “You have to follow them tonight.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Follow them where?” Sirius whispered, looking at Lupin, Potter, and Pettigrew who were leaning on a bookshelf, yawning.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Lupin whispered something and his mates laughed. Potter peeled back his sleeve to show a fresh, angry looking scratch on his arm and Lupin shook his head with a roll of his eyes.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Just trust me. You'll get a chance,” Snape said, scratching the tip of his long nose.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius shrugged at those helpful words, and watched Snape narrow his eyes at Potter. Across the classroom, Potter had gotten the attention of Lily Evans, who was very obviously into his flirting but pretending so hard not to be. Snape curled his lip furiously, and Sirius scoffed.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Pathetic,” Sirius muttered, and Snape turned his glare towards him instead.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Just do as I say,” Snape said, petulantly.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius ran a hand through his hair, wondering just how much trouble Snape's plan would cause. After years of knowing Snape, Sirius had learnt not to trust him. They weren't friends, they were allies in a war that nobody else seemed to be involved in. That didn't mean Snape wouldn't stab him in the back at the first chance, it just meant that for now, Sirius was safe with the Slytherins.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">If only they knew what went through his head, maybe that would be a different story.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius pulled out his wand and, on Kovac's instruction, stood opposite Snape. Glancing around, he saw Potter and Pettigrew were a pair, and Lupin and Evans were a pair. Both Potter and Snape were eyeing Lupin with barely concealed jealousy, Sirius resisted the urge to roll his eyes.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">For someone who claimed pure-bloods and Slytherins were better than everyone else, Snape sure had a thing for Lily Evans. Gryffindor and a mudblood, she was everything Snape shouldn't want.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Will you relax?” Sirius hissed to Snape, “You know Lupin's bent, he spent all of last year with Davidson's cock in his mouth.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Like you're one to talk,” Snape whispered with a smug grin.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Piss off, at least Potter's brave enough to talk to her.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Now, class,” Kovac said, probably interrupting the string of curses Snape was about to launch in Sirius's direction. Nothing riled him up more than pointing out how much better Potter was at everything.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Kovac climbed onto one of the desks to address them all, “After bowing, I want one person to attempt to disarm the other, while the other uses <em>Protego Duo. </em>Disarm only. If I hear one curse, I will string you up by your thumbs, understood?”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Murmurs of acknowledgement went through the class. Sirius and Snape bowed to each other. Sirius mirrored Snape's stance, and aimed his wand, “I'll shield.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape nodded once and took a step back. Various yells of <em>Protego Duo </em>and <em>Expelliarmus </em>sounded around the classroom. Red and blue spells bounced against the walls, and exploded on the ceiling. In a smooth motion, Snape swished his wand and cast a disarming spell. Sirius flicked his wands, said the spell, and created a ghostly, blue screen in front of him. The spell hit the barrier and ricocheted across the room.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“So, what's the plan?” Sirius asked, as his shield disappeared. He ducked quickly to avoid a rogue disarming charm.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape flicked his wand rapidly, but Sirius was ready. He lazily swished his own wand, said the words, and grinned when the shield appeared. Looking through the blue haze in front of him, Sirius saw Snape narrow his eyes. Sirius dropped his grin, knowing it would flare up Snape's short temper and, consequently, his vengeful streak.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">It wasn't Sirius's fault Snape was so easy to predict. He always took a step back before casting a spell in a duel, he'd never beat Sirius. It would be when Sirius's back was turned that Snape would finally win. Sirius better stop acting so cocky, or he'd wake up covered in burns potion.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Excellent, Sirius,” Kovac said as he walked past.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape frowned at Kovac, watching him inspect Lupin and Evans. Sirius glanced over just in time to see Lupin cast a perfect shield. Unlike Potions, or Care of Magical Creatures, Lupin was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Too distracted by Lupin, Sirius didn't hear Snape. Pain hit his shoulder as his wand was ripped from his hand. It arced into the air, spinning, and landed straight into Snape's waiting hand.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius glared at him, “What the fuck?”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“I needed your wand,” Snape said, grinning with triumph.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius rubbed his bruising shoulder, mentally cursing himself for beating Snape twice in a row. He was such a sore loser.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape rolled Sirius's wand between his fingers, inspecting it. Sirius held his hand out for his wand, but Snape didn't hand it over. Instead, he aimed it and whispered, “Stupefy.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius snapped his head to follow the red spell. His wand was shoved back into his waiting hand, just as the spell hit its target. Potter hit the ground with a thud, audible enough to make everyone turn to look. Snape snickered.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Pettigrew was looking around with panic, and both Lupin and Evans ran to Potter's side.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Mr. Pettigrew, did you use the stunning spell?” Kovac asked, walking towards Potter.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“N-no, Sir, I swear. I was doing the p-p-pro- the shield spell,” Peter stammered.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">When Lily knelt by Potter's head, Snape stopped snickering. Sirius stepped forward to get a better view. He was aware that he was holding the weapon that had knocked Potter out, but as long as Kovac didn't suspect anything, he'd never be able to guess. He couldn't check everybody's wands and all their previous spells.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Rennervate,” Kovac said. James began to stir instantly, blinking his eyes rapidly. He groaned as he sat up, and Lily stood up quickly to pretend she hadn't been interested.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Lupin grinned at Potter, and he punched his calf, weakly, “Don't laugh, you tosser.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Kovac faced the class, “Who did this? I need a name.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius remained silent, tucking his wand behind his ear to act nonchalant. Next to him, he saw a hand raise. Snape was smirking, holding his hand up high. Sirius shook his head quickly, but Snape ignored him.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Yes, Mr. Snape?” Kovac asked.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius almost elbowed Snape in his ribs. This was his brilliant plan? To get Sirius in detention? How did that solve anything? He couldn't follow Potter and his gang if he was in detention. This was just revenge for being better at DADA than Snape was.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“It was Sirius, Sir,” Snape said, looking at Sirius like he was an earthworm in an apple. “He said something about filthy Gryffindors, I don't really know.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“What! No, I-”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Mr. Black,” Kovac was no longer his happy self, he looked furious, “Was it you?”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius cast a side-long look at Snape, who was pulling that stupid determined face again. Sirius sighed. If confessing to this stupid spell would get Snape off his back, it was worth it. Sirius glanced at Potter and his mates, who were now glaring at him so hard, he was sure they were trying to mentally make his head explode.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius still had no idea what Snape's plan was, but he shrugged, “Yeah, it was me.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Why?” Kovac asked.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Again, Sirius glanced at Snape, “I... I hate Gryffindors, Sir.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Lupin shook his head with disgust, Potter stood up and glared at Sirius, Evans looked murderous. Kovac just seemed disappointed.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Class dismissed,” he said, “Mr. Black, my office, this evening. It's time you learnt there's more to this school than it's houses.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Yes, uh, Sir,” Sirius said, swinging his bag over his shoulder.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Snape had already left the classroom. He was grinning when Sirius found him in the corridor. They walked down the corridor, dodging a group of third year girls who giggled when Sirius looked at them. Snape elbowed a first year boy out of his way, still beaming about his plan.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“What the hell was that?” Sirius snapped.</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">“Just go to detention, you'll see what I mean.”</p><p class="western" align="LEFT">Sirius kept following Snape, quietly seething to himself. They rounded the corner, and after Snape hexed a few first years out of their way, entered the Great Hall. Sirius didn't speak to Snape for the rest of the meal, choosing instead to pretend he didn't exist. Snape wasn't bothered, after all, his plan was going to work out just fine.</p><p> </p>
