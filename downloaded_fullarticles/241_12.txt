    <em>“You’re a monster! I should have killed you when I had the chance!” I hear the shouting as I feel a sharp pain shoot through my arm. “I’m sorry! I‘m sorry!” I sob as my father inscribes the words ‘DEATH EATER’ into my forearm. I can’t remember how I set him off. I can’t remember what I did to make him hate me so much. But I must deserve it. I see how he is with the others he adores them, so I must have done something to make him hate me.</em>

    <em>The world begins to blur as crimson soaks my arm, the words being written into my skin becoming an unreadable mess as the seconds tick by. “GET OFF HER! LEAVE HER ALONE!” I see mum charge into the room trying to pry my father off me as the scene in front of me darkens. “PLEASE! LEAVE HER ALONE” I hear her pleading, trying her hardest to get him off me. I can’t see but I can still hear her Yorkshire accent muttering in my ear “Stay with me. Come on, wake up. Come on! Wake up my little dragon. Stay with me.”</em>

</p><p>
  <span>I awake to the sound of my screaming. “Lucy, it’s okay. It was just a dream. He’s not here. He can’t hurt you.” I open my eyes to see a pair of silver-grey eyes, identical to my own, looking down at me, their owner whispering frantically trying to soothe my wracking sobs. “You're safe now. Calm down, you're safe.” I grip the body of my saving grace as tears stain his nightshirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After about 20 minutes my tears stop falling and I regain the ability to speak. “Sorry, I’m sorry, did I wake you again?” I ask, my nerves clear in the wavering tone of my voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.” Says the blonde as I detach myself from him. “What happened? Was it that Nightmare again?” He asks, looking me up and down making sure I hadn’t injured myself in my sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop doing that. I’m fine, okay.” I say as he grabs my arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I'm a Hufflepuff.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should speak to someone about what happened” These words come from another voice I realise as I look away from my blonde saviour to see my cousin walk through the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not you too Albus, I’ve told you both already I’m fine. I don’t need to speak to anyone, I have you two.” I try to sound cheerier than before, but I'm met with the same look from them both. The same look that they have both been giving me for the past two years, one of worry, doubt and pity. I hate that they pity me. I don’t need nor want their pity. It makes me feel weak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I look at the Slytherin sitting across from me to find him staring at my arm. I follow his gaze and roll down my sleeve, hiding the letters forever scared on my skin. Forever marking me a monster. “Are you sure you’re okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I look up and see that he has been joined by the red-headed Potter that often accompanies Scorpius on his journeys to comfort me at the dead of night. “I’m sure.” I say now finding myself comforting him “Now go back to bed. I’m not going to sleep anytime soon but there’s no need for me to deprive you two of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reluctantly, both boys dismount my bed and walk out. Scorpius stops at the door and turns to face me “Are you sure you’re going to be okay over the holiday?” the look of concern quickly turns into his well-known Malfoy smirk  “I mean, I wouldn’t want to think of how hopeless you will be without me. We all know just how much you need me dear twinnie” he says his voice dripping with sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you to stop calling me that, besides mum and I always stay here for Christmas. Now go away Malfoy” I laugh at him while throwing the pillow from the deserted bed next to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay. Okay. I’m going, I’m going. I’ll see you before I leave Granger” he states as he vacates my dorm room, figuring it’s for his own safety.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watch him leave before laying back on my now tear-soaked pillow and stare at the ceiling. This is going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~~~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As I descend the stairs to the common room I find that neither Scorpius or Albus are awake yet. ‘Peace and Quiet’ I think as I sit next to the fire. But the silence is too good to be true as I soon hear a stampede of footsteps coming from the direction of the boy’s dorms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“GIVE IT BACK!” I hear as the red-headed Slytherin runs past me, trying to get to cover.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not until you apologise for what you said!” he shouts while staring down the blond who is standing on the opposite side of the common room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see why you are so bothered by it. I was only joking,” he said impatiently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if you were only joking, you would mind if I told our darling Lucette here what you called her, will you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you dare, I’m only just out of the infirmary.” Scorpius tries to lunge for the object in Albus’ hand. It only takes me a matter of seconds to figure out that it’s his wand he's trying to get back. Just as he thinks victory is within his grasp I take the wand from Albus’ hand and point it in the direction of Scorpius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me what you said or,” I say realising that maybe coming up with a threat on the spot was not one of my brightest ideas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or what Granger?” he says, a doubtful look in his eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or... I’ll throw your wand into the fire. Imagine how annoyed daddy dearest would be if he found out you managed to lose your wand, </span>
  <em>
    <span>again.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” I can see the fear begin to cloud his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hesitantly, he looks me in the eye as he gives in, “Fine!” he says exasperated “I called you an idiot half-blood with a weasel for a father.” This knowledge earns Scorpius a dry laugh and another trip to the infirmary at Albus’ demand that the nurse needs to see if I have given him any broken bones. Again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~#~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius wakes up and sees me sitting on the bed opposite him. Regret is starting to set in “How many times have I told you not to refer to him as my father Malfoy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clearly not enough as I still seem to end up back here at least once a week.” He smirks back at me. He tries to sit up only to be met with a wave of nausea and dizziness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The nurse told me to give you this,” I say holding out the potion I was given, “she’s gone to see McGonagall but said that this should help with the concussion and pain in general. Although, rather unfortunately, you have no broken bones, you will be sore for about three days, you're pretty bruised.” He takes the potion with gratitude but then he looks at me with a look of annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where is it?” He asks through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t the faintest idea what you could be referring to,” I say as  I try to hide the large grin on my face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where have you put my wand Granger?” he asks again, getting more irritated. I decide to revel in his misfortune and give him the riddle to find his wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that old thing. I’ve hidden it.” I say grinning even wider.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know that you idiot. Where have you hidden it?” his eyes trying to burn holes into my skull.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I always run, but never walk</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I often murmur, but never talk</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I have a bed, but do not sleep</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I have a mouth, but do not eat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just tell me where it is!” the blonde threatens me but I can’t help but smirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re in no place to be making threats Malfoy. Solve the riddle and find your wand. It's easy today, it might not be tomorrow.” I start down towards the door on my way back to my dorm, “Good luck.” I sing as I leave the infirmary.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~~~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As I walk into the common room I hear noises coming from the boy’s room. ‘<em>Must be Albus packing for the holidays</em>’ I think to myself as I walk in hoping to mess with Scorpius’ belongings before he leaves. Give him something to remind him of his dear ‘twinnie’ over the Christmas holidays. As I stumble into the boy’s dorm I see Scorpius’ bags packed and start towards them as I hear someone breath catch in their throat. Figuring it’s not Albus I turn to see a grown man staring at me in shock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> “Hello?” I say as I get out my wand and point it at the intruder, “What are you doing in here?”</span>
