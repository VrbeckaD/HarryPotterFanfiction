    <p>Through the scraping of benches on the stone floor rang Hagrid’s voice: “Seventh Years! Seventh Years to the staff table!” And as the rest of the school exited the Great Hall, chattering excitedly about the summer holidays or frantically about last-minute packing, the seventh year students lined up at the front of the room, silently, the air around them fraught with anticipation.</p><p>Remus’ stomach twisted into knots. This was the moment. His eyes scanned the Great Hall, trying desperately to take in every detail, to trace the cracks in the stone and count the clouds in the ceiling. Who knew when he’d see those banners, those benches, the flames in those torches again? Who knew if he’d ever be within these walls again, his sanctuary, his home for the last seven years? He lined up with his house, surveying the faces of the fifty students who stood with him. Tomorrow, he knew, some of those faces would cease to be his fellows…</p><p>Beside him, Sirius’ eyes were grave. Though yesterday he’d expressed only excitement at the prospect of moving on in the world, that excitement had faded when Dumbledore had pulled him aside that morning along with twelve other students and offered them each a slip of parchment with an address on it, to be used in exactly one month.</p><p>He’d silently beckoned them to him as they descended the staircase; they’d ringed him in the entrance hall, stiff-postured and stone-faced. His eyes were darker, his face more lined, but set; he knew what he was asking of them, though it pained him to do it. They’d heard of the Order, of course, for it was hard to miss the obituaries that took up a full page of the Daily Prophet every morning. A flustered Mary Macdonald had immediately refused the slip of parchment; she’d be joining St. Mungo’s as a trainee healer soon. The other eleven of them had agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Sirius clenched that parchment in his right hand now, having spent most of the feast thinking of it crumpled against his palm, and stared out the window, lost in contemplation of the world outside it.</p><p>Lily, on Remus’ other side, had one hand intertwined with James’ as the other’s fingers tapped feverishly at her side. She bunched her robes in her fist, glancing down the line at the young man hidden behind a curtain of dark hair. He did not return her glance, he never returned her glances, but instead stared fixedly at a point on the wall. She had severed all ties with him two years ago with no regrets, but now that the moment was actually here, the moment when they’d take up arms on the opposite sides of the battlefield, every time she looked at him Lily felt a pang of grief, swiftly stifled by a surge of disgust.</p><p>James, noticing where Lily’s gaze was directed, gave her hand what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze. She returned it, grateful, perhaps, for his presence, but could not tear her eyes away from Snape. He knew enough about her past with Severus and what he used to mean to her to see how upset she was, even if she tried to hide it. He said nothing, though, knowing any attempt at consolation would sound insincere coming from a man who was itching to join the war against her former friend…</p><p>Each House stood lined up before its banners on the wall. Now that all fifty students had made their way to the front, the Heads of House descended from their table and stood before their students. Hogwarts had no real graduation ceremony, Lily recalled, but traditionally the Heads of House, then the Headmaster, would exchange parting words with their students. In each professor’s face was a mixture of pride and concern; after seven long years of raising them, today their students would be released into a world of turmoil.</p><p>Professor Sprout was hugging each of her students in turn, tears already spilling from her eyes. Professor Flitwick was chatting animatedly with his Ravenclaws, while Professor Slughorn surveyed imperiously his fine collection of Slytherins. There was a droop to his normally proud mutsache, James observed; perhaps he knew already that five of his twelve beloved students – and Merlin knows how many more – were sure to carry their exceptional talents to the Dark Lord’s side? Beside Snape, Dorcas Meadowes drew Slughorn’s attention, and it was to her that he directed most of his speech. James remembered the proud fire in her eyes as she took the slip of parchment from Dumbledore, the only member of her house who had even been offered it. His attention snapped back to Professor McGonagall as she cleared her throat.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall remained silent for a few moments, hands behind her back, lips pursed, surveying her students. Her face relaxed into a smile, and her sharp eyes rounded, filling with sudden emotion. Her charges’ hearts dropped a mile, as they realized exactly who they were saying goodbye to.</p><p>“It shouldn’t have to be said that I am immensely proud of every one of you,” she began, her business-like tone failing to hide the gleam in her eyes. “Each of you has grown into a fine person.” A deep breath, and a note of concern in her next words; “You all know very well what you will face in the world outside these doors. The wizarding community is in distress, torn apart by war, a war you…” here she wavered. “A war you… young men and women are about to enter. As Gryffindors,” and here, a note of pride steadied her voice, “as models of courage, loyalty, honor, and pure nerve, we must never shrink from our duty to our fellows, to this school, to the wizarding community and the world at large.” As if on cue, every student straightened his or her posture at these words, carrying themselves now with pride rather than apprehension. Even Peter Pettigrew, she was pleased to see, was standing with no visible signs of nervousness or fear, though she of course could not know how his heart was racing, palms sweating, stomach boiling under his determined expression.</p><p>“Good.” She nodded approvingly, surveying her students. “Of course I will be seeing most of you very soon,” catching a glimpse of Mary MacDonald’s abashed expression, she continued, “but each one of you, regardless of where you are, will contribute something valuable to our efforts. Each of you will have a role to play in these coming years…” she paused, a mist creeping over her eyes. Blinking it away, she shook her head, at a loss for how to continue. For ten years now she’d been sending students off into an increasingly explosive war. Once again, she had to send these children, far too young to know this danger, straight into its waiting arms.</p><p>“…and I am confident that you are more than capable of rising to whatever challenge.” She continued, clearing her throat, and a proud fire kindled in her eyes. “But first and foremost… take care of yourselves. Be kind to yourselves. Fight… I know you must. But take care of yourselves, all of you.” Her gaze lingered longest on Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, wishing to drill those words into their minds, those two troubled boys who needed it the most. James and Lily, her favorite students though she’d never admit it, Peter and Marlene, talented but always unsure of themselves…</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat, and McGonagall gave them all a faint smile as she stepped back and raised her wand over her students. Her parting words lingered in the air as Dumbledore began to speak.</p><p>“Graduates of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” Dumbledore began, “You now leave these halls, armed with ample, even formidable, magical talent.” James later swore Dumbledore’s gaze had alighted on his group at those words, but the moment passed and he continued, “You enter a world at war with itself. On one side, the allies of strength, community, tolerance, and love. On the other, the allies of greed, power, pride, and hatred. When you leave these halls, choose carefully to whom you lend your allegiances.”</p><p>Peter whistled under his breath. Dumbledore definitely was not mincing words. And, what’s more, his gaze was definitely firmly fixed on that group of students who stood apart from the rest of Slytherin house, of whom only Mulciber stared defiantly back, while the rest avoided his eyes or studied the pores in the stone floor. Beside them, Dorcas Meadowes too met Dumbledore’s eyes, an affronted expression in hers.</p><p>But Dumbledore was speaking again; “It has been a privilege to know you all over the last seven years. Thank you all for being exemplary students, for showing dedication to this school, to your education, and most importantly, to each other.” That proud fire was back in his eyes, and at his words the Heads of House too surveyed their students with admiration. “Now, I formally release you.”</p><p>On the word ‘release’, the Heads of House swept their wands over the heads of their students. Their robes flushed with color, deep red, blue, gold, or green. The House Crests sewn onto their robes turned into full Hogwarts Crests, as the Great Hall erupted with the cheers of the students and applause of their professors. This part of the ceremony, Lily recalled from Hogwarts, A History, was only added about 50 years ago, a favorite idea of previous Headmaster Armando Dippet, apparently appropriated from the practices of much more ceremonial American schools. The colored robes were supposed to be tokens representing the completion of their magical education, and donning their House colors signified the development of their character. It was a shame, she thought, that the beautiful crimson of her robes clashed horribly with her hair.</p><p>“Now go forth!” Dumbledore bellowed over the tumult, “and represent the good name of Hogwarts School in all you do!” With those words the whole class flooded, still cheering, into the Entrance Hall.</p><p>Their trunks had been carried down to the train, Lily remembered with a sigh, rolling her eyes at Alice’s sympathetic chuckle at her appearance. Hagrid’s towering form emerged from the Great Hall and strode through the vibrant students milling about his waist, his eyes already swimming with tears. “Alright, to the boats with ye lot. Go on!” He gave a great sniff. “No more ‘n four to a boat! Yer all so much bigger now…”</p><p>Sirius caught Hagrid’s eye and gave him a wink. “No tears, Hagrid! We’ll see you soon!”</p><p>“I oughta separate you two,” Hagrid chuckled, nodding at James and Sirius, “Or we’ll all capsize this time!”</p><p>“We won’t do it this time Hagrid! Honest!”</p><p>Hagrid just raised an eyebrow at them as they flooded through the doors and spilled onto the grounds. The seventh years ran whooping and cheering across the grass, under a brilliant blue sky, the wind seemingly lifting them off their feet. Lily pulled James along behind her, Remus grabbed Sirius’ hand and stumbled to keep up, while Snape lagged behind, tripping towards the fleet of boats that awaited them on the Black Lake.</p><p>Lily pulled James into a boat at the back of the fleet, which rocked in greeting. James laughed, “I think it remembers me! Sirius, come on!” Sirius and Remus clambered in behind them, making the boat rock once again. Remus chuckled and patted its side.</p><p>“Sorry, Pete!” Lily called to an out-of-breath Peter, who could only gasp and shake his head in response as he fell into a boat behind Alice and Marlene. Lily glanced behind her and saw Severus hunched alone in a boat, chin on his knees, staring at the castle. She wrenched her gaze away, determined not to look at him again, instead focusing her gaze on the distant image of Gryffindor tower.</p><p>Hagrid climbed into the largest boat, called “forward!” and the boats sped of their own accord across the lake. As they glided away from the shore, the chatter fell silent for a few moments, as every head turned to watch the receding castle, gleaming in the sunlight, winking goodbye. The thought behind each pair of eyes was the same; they were watching their past fade away as they were swallowed by their future…</p><p>Lily leaned into James’ chest as she watched the grand castle perched on the mountain grow smaller in the distance. She could remember her elation seven years ago, when their class emerged from that copse of trees on the path and the glowing castle revealed itself against the night sky. She could hear the awed whispers of her eager classmates as they milled around her, Hagrid guiding them to the shores of the vast lake, his boots crunching on the gravel. Every sound, every smell, every sight from that day was ingrained forever in her mind, the day she entered an entirely new world, and made the decision never to leave it behind. And now, not at all the same person as she was then, she was preparing to fight for that world…</p><p>She settled further into James’ chest with a sigh, and he wrapped his arms around her, tucking his chin to press his lips to her forehead. Sirius threw an arm around Remus, who resignedly leaned against him. She chuckled at her friends as a wistful contentment stole over her, her eyes fixed again on the castle in the distance. “D’you think we’ll ever see it again?” She asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius chimed in, “’course we will! When the war’s over, and Remus here becomes the greatest Defense professor Hogwarts has ever known…”</p><p>Remus arched an eyebrow at that comment, wanting to protest but steamrolled by Sirius’ imagination.</p><p>“… but he’ll have broken the jinx by then, of course, and we’ll all be famous Aurors of course, so we’ll come visit, give guest lectures about our greatness…”</p><p>Remus just laughed and shook his head. “Who said I’m gonna be a professor? And even if I was, why the hell would I invite you to lecture my class?”</p><p>“Well you’ll need some outlet for your natural talent, Moony, since you flat-out refused to join the Aurors…”</p><p>Remus’ smile faded, and everyone else’s followed suit as they lapsed into silent contemplation again. In a month, a few of their classmates, Alice and Dorcas among them, would report to the Ministry, some for Auror training, some for Department jobs, all eager to join the resistance. Despite the protests of his friends, Remus knew it would be difficult for him to find a place within this resistance, too difficult to join the Aurors or even keep a day job at the Ministry. If it weren’t for Dumbledore’s insistence, or the prospect of never seeing his friends again, he’d never even have joined the Order…</p><p>James wanted desperately to convey to his friend that he’d be alright, knowing too well the expression on Remus’ face, but couldn’t bring himself to break the reverent silence as the boats bumped gently against the shore. Clambering out of the boats, the new graduates stood for one last look on the majestic castle on the hill in the distance, till the distant whistle of the train cleaved through the silence and they turned and filed along the narrow stone path choked with trees…</p><p>As the train raced away from Hogwarts, Sirius challenged the entire compartment to a massive game of Exploding Snap, which upset Nigel so much that he clawed everyone’s legs before Peter had the sense to let him into the next compartment. They passed their last train ride together laughing uproariously, and on the platform Lily kissed James goodbye, then at an offended look from Sirius, laughed again and kissed him, then Remus, then Peter on the cheek before Disapparating home. Tonight they’d each spend time with their families, Sirius and James at the Potter residence, Peter with his parents, and Remus with his. They would spend the month apart before fishing those crumpled slips of parchment from their nightstands and setting off to find Dumbledore...</p><p>With assurances that they’d see each other soon enough, the Marauders departed King’s Cross for the world beyond.</p>
