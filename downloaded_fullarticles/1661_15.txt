    <p>As a child, Theseus Scamander would neither actively seek out people to befriend, nor crave for it and purposely bring attention to himself.</p>
<p>Perhaps it might have been because he was accustomed to solitude (being an only child), or he was used to having less-than-healthy levels of human contact.</p>
<p>Both his parents were working. His father with the Ministry, and his mother was one of the few Hippogriff Breeders in England, leading a programme that saw her spending some time conducting field research. The only other person Theseus had any form of verbal communication, was with the house elf-doubling-up-as-a-nanny. Even she was too busy with the upkeep of the house to pay him extra attention, outside of the necessary fussing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theseus would often read the newspaper that came in via owl every day the moment he was old enough to recognize words. He was highly intrigued by the moving pictures that accompanied the headlines for the day. Little Theseus once thought that a sad-looking witch was stuck in the picture, and tried his very best to save her.</p>
<p>His mother, home at that time, could not help but laugh at her son's attempts at jabbing the paper, telling the witch (who had hidden at the corner of the frame by then) in the picture "Take finger, save you!"</p>
<p>Of course, where there were funny moments, there were also the serious ones.</p>
<p>Theseus was more interested in knowing why some pictures had people looking at him, scowling. Once, he had asked Jinky, the family's house-elf, why these people looked so angry. Jinky had hurriedly explained that it was a picture of bad people using dark magic and doing bad things, and that he should ask his father instead of her, before scuttling away to fetch the laundry.</p>
<p>Bad people.</p>
<p>His father worked at the Ministry, catching bad people too. Maybe he would grow up and protect people from dark magic!</p>
<p>Inspired, Theseus, with all the time he had to himself, would spend hours imagining himself older and stronger, pretending to wave his wand to apprehend these bad people, thus protecting his family and everyone else. Jinky had witnessed Theseus's imaginary play, and felt proud that her young master was going to grow up to be a person who protects, just like Master Scamander.</p>
<p>Excited, Jinky decided that the young master had no need for her attention, and happily kept out of Theseus's way, convinced that she was allowing him the space to grow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----Some years later, in France-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leta Lestrange had grown to dislike attention.</p>
<p>She did not have many memories of her father and stepmother, but Leta remembered that her father, Corvus, had hardly ever spoken to her kindly. In fact, she could not recall if her father had ever actually had a proper conversation with her. He had preferred to let his hands do the talking.</p>
<p>Leta's mother had died, and Leta yearned to know if her biological mother would have even liked her one bit.</p>
<p>Her stepmother never spoke to her, always looking at her with disdain, as if Leta was lesser. A blemish. If there was a need to, her stepmother would speak to her attendant, and the attendant would repeat the words to Leta, despite them being in the same vicinity. At least her father was better because he acknowledged her existence through his beatings. Either way, Leta hated being in the same room with either parent, because it meant attention on her, and not the positive kind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were younger children who came by the Lestrange mansion, accompanying the adults who were there to meet with Corvus. These guests too, preferred to look past Leta, than at her. There was one incident, where four-year-old Leta was tripped by one of the guests' son. She had fallen and scraped her chin, palms and knees. Out of anger, Leta had retaliated by shoving the boy who was busy laughing at her, and ran off to her room.</p>
<p>Shortly after, her father appeared with another man and the same boy (now sporting red eyes, flushed cheeks, smirk in place) in tow, and had proceeded to physically punish her in front of the two other males. In spite of her screams of protests and pleas for him to stop so that she can explain, Corvus never did until Irma the housekeeper appeared and threw herself between Leta and her master's hand, taking the blow that was meant for the girl.</p>
<p>Horrified that his pure flawless hand had contacted with a lesser being, Corvus left the room. Held by Irma, Leta had never felt so angry (and later on when she learnt more words), humiliated, and guilty all at once. Friendless and lonely, the only other companion Leta had was the same person who was obligated to care for her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A half-elf housekeeper, Irma Dugard, was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring Leta's basic needs were met from when the latter was a baby. Irma never spoke more than necessary, and did enough worrying over Leta to ensure the girl's survival. Despite the bruises and tears, Irma was never once approached by Leta for help. It was the housekeeper who had to find Leta when she heard the Master's shouts, comforting the girl and applying what little elf magic she had to sooth the redness on the skin.</p>
<p>Through years of receiving a fair amount of care, Leta grew to like Irma. Sometimes she would help the housekeeper with tasks that a five year-old could do, lips tugging at the sides when Leta knew she did something right, all on her own. Likewise, the half-elf gradually grew to geuinely care for Leta's well-being.</p>
<p>When Corvus Jr was born and basked in his father's pride and love, Irma wondered if there was any way to heal Leta's emotional hurt, as she spied from her corner a young Leta with such sorrow in her eyes as the girl witnessed her own father showering love on the new baby boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Affection that she had never had.</p>
