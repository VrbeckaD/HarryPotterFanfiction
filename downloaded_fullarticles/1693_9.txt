    <p>Draco does not just <em>loathe</em> running, he <em>abhors</em> it. So the Ministry better be thankful for his Hit Wizard level of finesse in capturing this dark magic fiend. For not only is running simply <em>awful,</em> it makes him sweat. How is he supposed to be the best dressed in his department when he has to roll up and squeeze his traveling cloak to eliminate all that extra perspiration?</p><p>You must understand, Draco Malfoy is by no means vain, <em>oh</em>, perish the thought!  He just wants to retain a little <em>class</em>, seeing how every Gryffindor and their scarlet and gold banner waving grandmother has dominated the traditional, humdrum thank-you-very-much crowd that once owned the floors of the Ministry. The Dark Lord fell because of one undeserving, stupid <em>Harry Potter</em>, and then every other <em>daring, chivalrous, </em>and <em>courageous</em> lout thought they could hit the field and replicate the magic.</p><p>Ha! Potter's not even that talented of a Hit Wizard. After all he's been adrift for <em>weeks</em> now. Completely off the map, they're all saying he's dead, but Draco knows better. Harry's too stupid for that. He's likely still at home trying to figure out how to work the damned Portkey again.</p><p>Psch. That's why Draco's here. In Ireland. He's going to find and arrest this heinous Dark Wizard that Potter had to make a big deal about pursuing. He's going to prove that Potter is in fact not dead, and show the world that he can be a hero too.</p><p>No, no. Draco doesn't care about being a hero, he just cares about other people's acknowledgements. Considering that fact that <em>Blaise Zabini</em> of all people has been patting himself on the damn back every day for eight years because he did the Slytherin class good by not directly aligning himself with You-Know-Who, there's obviously a lot of work to do in regards to readjusting people's grandiose visions of what true heroism is.</p><p>The only other Hogwarts kids that seem to be on the same page as him are Gregory and Pansy. Gregory because he's daft, and Pansy because they've agreed that they're both terrible. It's like — their whole thing.</p><p>Perhaps Draco doesn't care about heroism. Perhaps when he stared down at the Dark Lord's pale body splayed across the beam of light blasting into the center of the Great Hall, he wasn't quite affected like he should have been. Perhaps Draco doesn't feel much at all anymore. Perhaps that's why he's a Legilimens. Because it allows for unfiltered visions of what emotions look like.</p><p>Hmph.</p><p>Or perhaps Draco just wants the Gryffindor class of '98 to stop gallivanting around the halls as if it's the locker room to a bloody Quidditch game.</p><p>So yes. Draco is running. Now before you make the suggestion, yes, Draco remembers he's a wizard and yes of course if he could Apparate here, he would. He would in a heartbeat. But because of the bloody Statute of Secrecy —</p><p>…. ah, a little background is required then. The perp in question is a loser. Likely a renegade Death Eater, digging his nose into muck, grubby hands bunching up the dark robes brushing his forehead. Desperate for success, but too pitiful to fully implement change. So they pursue Muggles. Yes. A wizard has integrated into the Muggles and is offing them like crazy. It's not Draco's case, of course, it's Potter's, but he's still done some thinking on it. The culprit must be a from the bottom rung of ascension to Lord Voldemort's embrace. (And Draco is someone to know about embraces from Lord Voldemort.)</p><p>Draco cannot help but picture the perpetrator being Peter Pettigrew. But no, that's unlikely, seeing how the bloated rapscallion strangled himself to death or whatever.</p><p>Point being: This is a wizard so weak he resorts to killing defenseless Muggles, but smart enough to know how the Statute of Secrecy restricts the Aurors…</p><p>Draco's hands are tied. So he dashes, frightened that his long legs might tear the seams in his nice traveling cloak.</p><p>It's funny; Draco wouldn't have even noticed the scoundrel without their own interference. He was merely window shopping at a quaint Muggle shop. Fascinating to see how these people do their Potions work. He finds himself particularly entranced by this device called a <em>cast iron skillet</em>. It's heavy in his grip. He likes it.</p><p>Draco swishes it through the air, laughing to himself. <em>Incendio!</em> he whisper-shouts under his breath. That's when there's a crash. Draco sees the shadow of a man stumbling out the door, decked in 1920s noir pinstripes, totally out of place from the humdrum Muggles standing about. Surely, this <em>thug</em> caught sight of Draco's extravagant robes and decided to high tail it.</p><p>Draco doesn't even need to think about throwing the cast iron skillet, he just does it. It spins and <em>crack!</em> The man goes <em>Ow!</em> It really is quite satisfying. But the man still runs. Doesn't turn to make a scene so it must be his man. Hero time it is then, Draco's sure that's how Potter felt after he yanked the Elder Wand from his clammy, pale hands back in the day.</p><p>Yes, he <em>yanked</em> it. Not even a wandless Expelliarmus. But that is classic Potter, hm? The brute strength and gumption?</p><p>It's ironic really. Shacklebolt asked Draco far before Unforgivables were cast, if he may take on this special case due to his professional knowledge of the Dark Arts. But Draco said no because it's a little too close to home for him. Then this Dark Wizard killed someone. So the case raised to a profile higher than Draco's pay grade anyways. It fell to the Hit Wizards, and naturally Potter snatched the case off of someone else's desk and charged right in — and presumably died.</p><p>But Draco has faith. Hasn't Harry already died before or something? Oh! Excuse him. <em>Potter</em>. Since he's apparently in death's cold embrace right now, it's easier to slip and say <em>Harry.</em> But no-no. Let's not be civil here. It's <em>Potter</em>.</p><p>Potter doesn't allow himself to take on partners, not even bloody Weasley. So when Potter's been absent long enough to warrant a search team and it goes poorly, Shacklebolt once again confronts Draco. Please Draco. Put a spin on this. You know Dark Arts. You still kind of sort of probably hate Muggles. So help us figure out what happened! You have <em>experience</em>. Draco almost rolls up his sleeves to get through the paperwork, but then he'd be showing off his Dark Mark and you don't want to be giving anyone any ideas around here. Not when the ministry's been taken over by a bloody <em>fraternity</em>.</p><p>Keep your head down, Draco. Do the work. Be the one good Slytherin. So he pitches his theory — the low tier Death Eater run amok. Interrogations begin and Narcissa owls Draco. <em>Draco darling, why are the Crabbes receiving inquiries from the Aurors? Now that he's on board with the Wizengamot it really is quick embarrassing, but Shacklebolt has never cared for our side of things, has he? Did something happen?</em></p><p>Then Narcissa receives a personal house visit from The Investigator Department, and Draco gets a Howler. Very embarrassing, though Weasley overhears it and actually punches Draco in the forearm. Flashes a grin. It's — nice.</p><p>But whoever this Death Eater is, they are very unfashionable. None of those ranked high enough to sit at the Dark Lord's long table would ever stoop to dressing like a Muggle. No. Their blood is too<em> pure</em> for that. This is someone who was never a true Death Eater to begin with, they were just power hungry. Like — ahem — himself.</p><p>This is someone remarkably untalented and embarrassingly stupid. Potter probably laughs at him, toys with him, and isn't ready when this uncomplicated person scrounges up the necessary hatred for an Unforgivable. That's the only way Draco can pen a narrative on this hoopla that runs true to the clues. But he still doesn't believe it. Potter can't really be dead. It doesn't just happen like that. Not for lucky bastards like him.</p><p>When Shacklebolt reads the report, he lifts it up to his upturned nose and frowns. Reads the text very slowly, occasionally twitching in response to some of Draco's verbiage. Draco braces himself, worried that perhaps he went too far. <em>Draco, you must remove yourself for at least one second if you are to plan something</em>, Severus would tell him, perhaps with a thwap to the head from a rolled up scroll.</p><p>But Shacklebolt merely smiles, a twinkle in his eyes. "<em>Everything appears to be in order,</em>" he says.</p><p>That whimsical vacancy reminds Draco of an old man he was once ordered to kill. Draco doesn't like that very much and decides to stuff it away, along with all the other thoughts Pansy tells him he ought to bring up in <em>therapy</em>.</p><p>Blech.</p><p>At long last, no more interruptions. Draco is running. It's abhorrent, as mentioned previously. He's been running for some time and finally catches up on this poorly concealed wizard. Draco <em>really</em> does not want to rip his cloak so he slows down a step which proves to be a mistake. Because this Death Eater's packing.</p><p>Draco's heard of these before — revolviwhatsits — but never quite encountered them. He learns what they do quickly though; the Death Eater extends his arm into the air and fires off several bullets rapidly.</p><p>"<em>Protego</em>!" Draco screams and the air before him pushes forward like rolling waves and knocks the bullets clean out of the air. Draco returns to his sprint but does take a moment to marvel at what a bad shot this man is — none of the five bullets are even close to striking him, they all dangle yards above his head before tumbling down to the wet street.</p><p>There's a loud <em>clang!</em> and <em>bang!</em> and Draco has to jump so that he doesn't trip against the fallen trash can. His freshly polished shoes crunch against the ridges of steel and he nearly loses his balance, but no! He may be posh but he's not <em>that</em> posh! So he kicks off and lands hard, running again. But when he smacks the pavement, brown waters lift from the puddles and lick the hem of his cloak.</p><p>Bloody hell, his mother made him that cloak and he really —</p><p>Red sparks blast from his shoulder, riding down his arm, picking up speed as they pass his elbow, skim the Death Mark, and hit the wand. Smoke lifts off the wood and Draco jabs the instrument like a conductor finishing off a particularly intense piece, and shouts, "<em>Expelliarmus!"</em></p><p>The scoundrel almost makes it scot free, they almost turn around a corner and forever disappear. The case is left open and Draco never finds out what became of Harry James Potter. But no, Draco <em>would </em>hit this wanker at the exact moment that he'd be better off missing.</p><p>The spell nails the running man in the small of the back. His entire frame flinches and contorts itself with the sudden power branching through his nervous system and right to the tips of his fingers where the red sparks rush out and knock the revolver high, high into the air.</p><p>Draco smiles because it feels <em>good</em> when the revolver falls into his pale hand and he holds it up like a prize. But his face falls just as fast because he wanted the man's wand not his bloody, barbaric gun.</p><p>But very quickly, the gun peels apart. The barrel, the hinge, the trigger, the cartridge, the bullets, all of it falls away like the worst balsa bridge at the science fair. The slats hit the ground leaving Draco with a wand. An actual bona fide wand and for a second, Draco decides he wants to become a Hit Wizard.</p><p>Bu then he looks closer at the wand and reconsiders that.</p><p>Eleven inches.</p><p>Limber and springy.</p><p>Holly.</p><p>Draco's breath catches in his throat before it eventually plumes out into a light fog. He doesn't need to look this man in the eye to know who he really is, but he takes the time to do so anyways because it briefly suspends a rather awkward conversation. Draco's wide eyes travel up the man's backside and his spine jitters at the sight of that dirty, brown neck he'll never quite get over. The man's shoulders rock up and down with racks of harsh breathing, but finally fall still. The unruly, jet black hair bounces one last time before falling in place besides the man's round cheeks.</p><p>Draco's whole body quakes with the shudder of his voice.</p><p>"Potter?"</p><p>Harry James Potter turns around slowly, lip curled into an ugly snarl. So adult, so worn looking. So — alive? But Draco forgets about the eight years that have passed when Harry's still boyish baritone cracks Malfoy's pink ears. "We don't have much time before the Ministry catches onto this. Find any Muggle that could have possibly witnessed anything and Obliviate. Got it?"</p><p>Draco does not. "What?"</p><p>Potter rolls his eyes, and Draco feels like a fool. "Statute of Secrecy. We're both <em>Aurors</em>, Malfoy."</p><p>Malfoy puffs out his chest and fully takes Potter in. "Ah."</p><p>Potter waits. Looks from left to right. Arches his brows and looks at Malfoy expectantly. "My wand?"</p><p>"Oh. Oh. Yes."</p><p>Draco lobs the wand into the air and it spins a few times before unceremoniously thunking against a trash can and rolling into a puddle. Harry growls and shuts his eyes, raising his fingers into the air and,<em>"Expelliarmus!"</em></p><p>
  <em>Bang!</em>
</p><p>Draco's wand arcs through the air and lands into Potter's waiting hands — for the second time in their lives. Potter laughs and flashes his irresistibly pearly whites. "I'll give it back I promise."</p><p>"Mhm," Draco moans, plucking Harry's wand out of the muck and waving off the remaining residue.</p><p>Clearly Harry is livid and there will likely be a row following this — and Draco really ought to check the perimeter to make sure that if they did violate Magical Law that no one finds out. But he doesn't do it. He waits. He watches Potter saunter off as if this is not a big deal. Watches that brown neck bob up and down with the bounce of Harry's gait. Remembers how in sixth year he scanned every peripheral to make sure Potter wasn't breathing down <em>his</em> neck.</p><p>Remembers how he was somewhat sad that Harry hadn't caught on to his master plan, how he had to <em>explain it</em> to Dumbledore so that at least one person could appreciate his genius.</p><p>He looks at Harry's neck one last time before setting to work. It's strange. As abhorrent as he finds it, Draco feels a sudden compulsion to run.</p>
