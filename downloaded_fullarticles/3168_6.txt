    <p>For seven years, the Marauders wore group costumes. Through their years a Hogwarts they went at The Beatles, The Fantastic Four, Various members of The Office, The Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Hot Dog + Condiments, and Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Following Hogwarts, James decided to leave Sirius, Remus, and Peter to go as a couple costume with Lily (since having Harry four years ago, they have done a family costume). In turn, Peter joined whoever it was he was dating at the time to do the same (Now it was his fiancé Mary). Remus and Sirius decided to go as a couple since their mates deserted them.</p><p>They two men were now going on year seven of Remus and Sirius going to their yearly Halloween bash together in their couple costume. Since instating a contest their first year Post-Hogwarts, Remus and Sirius had won it four of out seven times. Sirius had ideas for their costume this year already. Since it was the first weekend of October, they needed to get started. Sirius loved to DIY it and that’s part of the reason they did so well. The judges were always impressed with his skills. Moony tended to contribute nothing but looking pretty and the occasional sarcastic comment.</p><p>“Moony!” Sirius barged into the other man’s flat that he shared with Marlene and Dorcas. Sirius had tried to get him to live with him but Remus complained the rent was too high — even though Sirius offered to pay for most of it. Remus was terrible at taking any type of help. He wanted to make it on his own, which was so daft when he could be comfortable with a little help from his very rich mates. But Sirius didn’t press him too much on it and let him be after about six months of asking.</p><p>There was a moment of silence as Sirius stood in the living room. He was sure he heard something from inside the flat. “Oi! I know you’re in the flat. You sent me that Snapchat like an hour ago.”</p><p>“Sirius, I’m — fuck— I’m busy.” Remus sounded out of breath.</p><p>Sirius frowned. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Sirius, go the fuck away!” Remus’ voice sounded strained. Sirius was concerned the man was hurt as he made his way down the hallway.</p><p>“Are you dying?”</p><p>“He’s shagging. Now, fuck off, Black!” Benjy Fenwick yelled back.</p><p>“Sorry!” Sirius felt himself go red and hurried out of the flat before anyone could say another word. Not that it was the first time Sirius caught one of his mates in the act. Not that he saw anything.</p><p>Remus had been dating Benjy for five months now. Everyone liked Benjy. Everyone being the Marauders and Co. And Effie and Monty and Hope and Lyall. Hell, even Andi and Ted liked the bloke… Just not Sirius. There was something about Benjy that rubbed Sirius the wrong way. He couldn’t quite place his finger on it but he was going to be able to figure it out one day. It was something about the way that he carried himself and sort of flaunted his relationship with Moony.</p><p>Any person should be damn lucky to be dating Moony. It should humble them because this wonderful creature with a heart of gold and the sharpest tongue on the planet let them in. But Benjy didn’t seem to get that. Yeah, he flaunted his relationship but it was in a weird way. Not in a way that gave Remus his due. Sirius couldn’t explain it properly. He hadn’t tried to since attempting a conversation about it with James after Remus’ birthday dinner in March. James ended up giving him this weird look that Sirius didn’t understand. Lily also laughed for a solid ten minutes. So, he gave up.</p><p>Instead, he stewed in annoyance over Benjy silently. Like now, he was angrily getting a pint down the way all by himself while he waited for Remus to text him. He knew Remus would text him because Remus always got back to him, no matter what. The man could have been on his deathbed and he would be getting back to Sirius.</p><p>As he was staring at the screen talking about some tennis match, his phone buzzed on the bar top.</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Sorry :(</p><p align="right"><strong>SB</strong>: No worries.</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Text me when you need me.</p><p align="right"><strong>SB</strong>: Thought you were free.<br/>
SB: The Snap and all.</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: What did you want?</p><p align="right"><strong>SB</strong>: Chat. About Halloween</p><p>Sirius stared at his phone and about four times the “…” popped up on the screen and disappeared. He couldn’t understand what the big deal was. Maybe Benjy was trying to shag him again or something. It wasn’t something someone needed much thought for.</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: What are you doing now?</p><p align="right"><strong>SB</strong>: Pub. Hogshead.</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Be there in a half hour.<br/>
<strong>RL</strong>: If that works for you Pads.</p><p align="right"><strong>SB</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p><p>There was a point in his life that Sirius feared he’d lose his mates when they all got significant others. Hell, when James was trying to get with Lily, he was outright jealous. It wasn’t until months after they left Hogwarts that he was sure James wasn’t about to abandon him. He felt the same way about Peter and Remus’ first big relationships too. But he got over it. He blamed those feelings on his shitty upbringing. That was all basically confirmed by his therapist too.</p><p>About forty minutes later, Remus Lupin walked into the bar wearing a very well-worn green and blue checkered flannel over a black shirt and jeans that seemed to be particularly tight. They must have been new, Sirius didn’t notice them. His tawny curls were still a little damp from what Sirius assumed was a shower. At the base of his neck was an obscene hickey. They were 25, nearly 26 — were hickeys still a thing? Benjy was probably just marking his territory or something daft.</p><p>“‘Lo, Pads.” Remus took the seat next to Sirius at the corner of the bar by the wall.</p><p>“Moony, you know you didn’t need to come out,” Sirius said but he was glad that Remus was there.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. Ben had to get back to the hospital.” Remus shook his head.</p><p>“Shagging you on his break.”</p><p>“I’m the one doing the shagging, thank you very much.” Remus scoffed, taking Sirius pint and having a sip. “What is that? It tastes that water. Why do you have such shite taste?”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes and the bartender came over. Remus leaned against the bar and ordered a whiskey. He also flirted with the bartender, which he never did on purpose. It just happened. People always thought Sirius was the massive flirt but Remus had this strange natural charm to him that he didn’t even notice.</p><p>“Okay, so, Halloween.” Remus took a deep breath.</p><p>“Why does it feel like you’re breaking up with me?” Sirius folded his arms, feeling a bit defensive.</p><p>“Padfoot, have you ever been broken up with?”</p><p>“Fourth year, when I still thought I was straight. Emmy broke up with me before the Yule Ball.” There was a lot more to that story but Remus only needed to know the break-up part for the moment. He didn’t need to know the rest — ever.</p><p>Remus laughed, “So, you’re clearly experienced in breaking up.”</p><p>“I’ve broken up with people. I know the tone.” Sirius glared as the bartender set down the tumbler in front of Remus. “What’s going on? Are you not going to the party? Does Benjy want to go elsewhere? Is there some fancy doctor thing going on?”</p><p>“No, of course, we’re going. But I was going to do a costume with Ben.” Remus shook his head then took a drink. “I know it’s been our thing for seven years—”</p><p>“Excuse you, fourteen years, Moonpie. Then we made a pact after Wormy and Prongs fucked off to their hetero loves. We said no matter what we’d always go as a pair.” Sirius didn’t like the feelings that he was having at the moment. He was never a fan of being jealous but he was sure that was what he was feeling at the moment. That was stupid. It was just a dumb costume party.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Pads,” Remus said, resting a hand on his forearm.</p><p>“This is like getting broken up with! I feel like I caught you cheating and now you’re going off with him.” Sirius pouted like a child. Again, he knew that he was being stupid. He wasn’t sure why he was acting like this. “Then I’m going to have to watch you flaunt your costumes in front of my face at the party.”</p><p>“Look, we both knew this would happen at some point. It’s a miracle neither of us have been in a long-term relationship around Halloween before.” Remus drummed his fingers on the counter and looked deep in thought for a moment. “Maybe we can make it a threeway costume.”</p><p>“No! I will not join you in a threeway!” Sirius said a bit too loud. He was sure some of the other patrons were looking over at them. Remus' eyes flitted behind Sirius and he’s freckled cheeks went pink.</p><p>“Padfoot,” The other man hissed. “It’s a bloody costume.”</p><p>“It is a statement of a committed friendship.”</p><p>“You didn’t act like this with Peter.”</p><p>“Peter is the mate I would lose touch with if it weren’t for everyone.”</p><p>“Sirius!”</p><p>“I’m joking,” He rolled his eyes. “I did it with James not long before Pete abandoned us. I wasn’t interested in fighting. Plus, you offered me a great costume idea that year.”</p><p>“Pikachu and Ash, yeah.” Remus chuckled. “Look, I’m sorry. Maybe you can find someone else to partner up with.”</p><p>“I wanted to go as a merman and a sailor,” Sirius said and Remus’ face did something strange. Sirius wasn’t sure what the expression was but he wasn’t going to dwell on it because it probably had something to do with his costume idea with Benjy.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask one of the Prewetts? Fab is perpetually single. Gid’s girlfriend just left for a month long holiday so she won’t be round. Ask them both or one of them.”</p><p>“No.” Sirius decided he was going to play up the perpetual child that he was and stomp his feet around a little more.</p><p>“You’re just being ridiculous now,” Remus complained. “I’m sorry I found a boyfriend that I want to do a couples costume with.”</p><p>“I thought you offered a threeway.”</p><p>“To placate you because you’re in a strop.” Remus huffed a breath.</p><p>“Really, that’s the only reason why you offered a threeway?”</p><p>“You can stop saying the sodding word threeway.” The other man again looked behind Sirius a bit nervously. “I’m not saying sorry again because that’s ridiculous. This whole thing is ridiculous. It’s a bloody costume.”</p><p>“The foundation of our friendship is ridiculous?”</p><p>“You're a fucking drama queen.” Remus shook his head. “I’m not doing this with you. Can we have a drink like two normal humans and not get all up in arms over a bloody costume?”</p><p>“I feel betrayed.” Sirius declared.</p><p>“God, you’re not guilting me into doing a costume you with you, Padfoot. No matter what you say, it’s not happening. I’m going with Benjy and that’s that.”</p><p>Sirius hated that he disliked not getting his way so much. It was some sort of spoilt rich and good looking kid tendency he had still kicking around inside of him. Remus tended to be the one not to give him his way too. It was something with Moony. He was the one that needed to withhold things from him. Sirius should have been used to it but it still made him want to whine about it to someone.</p><p>So, after he finished his drink with Remus, he went to see James, Lily, and Harry. To his surprise, Lily was the only one at the flat. James had taken the kid to see some new movie. That was fine. James was generally bad at giving advice. Lily was much better at that sort of thing. “What’s going on with you?”</p><p>“Ugh, nothing.” He threw himself on to the sofa with his legs hanging over one side.</p><p>“That’s what you always say when you’re about to go off on some monologue about your horrible life.” Lily sat next to his head.</p><p>“My life is horrible. Moony is leaving me for Benjy.”</p><p>“Huh, never knew you two were an item. Also, it’s been nearly half a year since they started dating.”</p><p>“Lily, he’s going with him for Halloween. For the costume.”</p><p>“Oh, you didn’t see that coming?” Lily furrowed her brow. “Thought that was a given.”</p><p>“Should I have?”</p><p>“Sirius, you’re in your mid-twenties. Remus is getting ready to settle in for the long haul with this bloke. Of course your costume was at risk.” She laughed at him.</p><p>“I hate you Evans.”</p><p>“You do not.” She flicked his nose. “Do you still fancy him?”</p><p>Sirius cracked an eye open to look up her, feeling as if he was having the same Gay Panic he had when he happened to tell this information to her. “That was Fourth Year.” He said in a matter of fact tone. “I got over it. It was just me realizing I fancied blokes. That’s all. Also, we swore never to speak of that again.”</p><p>“It’s just… are you sure? You and Moony act so much like a couple sometimes it makes me laugh a little.” Lily rested a hand on his shoulder. “You might want to tell him sooner rather than later if you still do feel that way.”</p><p>Sirius glared at her now. They were never supposed to talk about this again after his first panic. She found him in the library looking like a mess. He had seen Remus in the showers and felt THINGS that one should not feel for their best mates. He confessed to Lily because he needed to tell someone. He didn’t realize that person would be there for the rest of his freaking life. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“No, love, that’s you.” She snickered. “Are you sure you moved on? Or did you just manage it in some way? Like pretending you were dating but not pretending.”</p><p>“I have no idea what the hell that means.” Sirius’ eyebrow went up.</p><p>“It’s just — you and Moony have always been practically dating up until the last few months. Like right up until Ben and Remus went on holiday together the other month. Whenever we do things in pairs, it’s always the couples and you two. It’s all changing now and you’re losing your chance to be with Moony.”</p><p>“We only did those couple things because we didn’t want to miss out with what the rest of you were doing.” He complained even though Lily did have a point. They basically were a couple and Sirius did enjoy it. But it wasn’t as if it were real and Sirius knew that. He was well past that Gay Panic of his youth. It was just something that was comforting. “It’s just the principle of it all.”</p><p>“Sirius, people grow up, have boyfriends, get married, and have babies. Not that you have to but I think we both know Remus wants that and Benjy probably does too.” Lily sighed and started to braid a part of Sirius’ hair.</p><p>“How did we jump from costumes to marriage and babies? That’s not what I’m talking about.”</p><p>“Mmmhmm, sure, Pads.” Lily nodded. “Tell me, when was the last time you went on a date?”</p><p>Sirius closed his eyes again in thought. He couldn’t remember. Anytime he went out somewhere alone that was nice it happened to be with Remus. That didn’t mean anything. It couldn’t. Remus was his best mate. All those feelings had died a long time ago…. Right?</p>
