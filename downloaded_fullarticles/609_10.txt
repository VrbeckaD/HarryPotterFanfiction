    <p>Hermione Granger was sipping on her traveling mug as she walked the barren halls of the Ministry of Magic. Her heels clicked against the floor in such a way that it was menacing as it echoed off the walls. The parchment in her arms was bundled in a haphazard fashion as she twisted in impatience.</p><p>The smell. It was the forsaken creature of time. Stale on the air like a decaying corpse of the life she once knew. Had it really been this long? It certainly felt like it had been only yesterday that the 'great purge,' the paper so viciously coined it, had happened.</p><p>It was a massive line to walk for those you love. Even if they feel you've abandoned them.</p><p>"He's expecting you," Percy's voice announced from the cherry desk as she approached the large doors.</p><p>"Thank you," Hermione sighed as she reached for the knob.</p><p>She caught his expression of pity. Both knew she had no news to report on. It was too big. Too sudden. All of it happened in such a way that nothing was left to research. It was just… gone.</p><p>Hermione opened the door to see Kingsley Shacklebolt digging through pages. The bags had grown under his eyes substantially since the last meeting. Things were not improving by any measure. His eyes darted to her form as she shut the door.</p><p>"Hermione," his voice was breathy and full of relief.</p><p>"Hello, Minister," she announced before sitting across from him. "I brought you my findings, but I must warn you, no useful input came from my trip to Germany."</p><p>Kingsley reached for the offered pages and scowled at the writing. Hermione watched her superior grow worn and discouraged as he read. All she could do was sip her tea and wait for his response.</p><p>"We wrote six months ago that we were working on an answer," he breathed before setting the pages down.</p><p>"I know," Hermione sighed.</p><p>He reached for his wand and flicked it at the parchment stack- straightening the mess and directing his attention to the witch. "What do we do?" He questioned.</p><p>"All we can do is keep trying. What else is there left?" Hermione responded.</p><p>"And your research?" He asked.</p><p>Hermione squirmed and twitched her nose. "Well, those that have been exposed to the affected for prolonged periods lose their magic, but temporarily."</p><p>Kingsley rocked his head before lounging in his chair. "What else?"</p><p>"I've also noted that children born from a previously affected coupling show no signs of magical influence," Hermione answered.</p><p>"I wonder how else we might go digging. We've looked for prophecies, curses, infection… what could possibly have been the cause? Would that cure the affected? People are losing hope. Wizards are going into hiding because they're scared to lose it. Unspeakables..."</p><p>Hermione tilted her head and shrugged her shoulders. "The Unspeakables left?"</p><p>Kingsley sneered momentarily before exhaling. "Some are concerned it came from unexplainable magic. They don't want to risk such a task."</p><p>"I will see what they left behind once I leave your office," Hermione announced.</p><p>"We're at the year marker, Miss Granger. What else can we do? Short of hoping for answers in the dark, what more is there?" The minister grumbled as he scrubbed his face.</p><p>"Ask for a miracle," Hermione suggested.</p><p>Kingsley chuckled and gazed up at the ceiling. "She doesn't believe in a higher power, but she believes in miracles?"</p><p>Hermione smirked, despite the circumstance. "Miracles are unexplained events; gods have nothing to do with this."</p><p>"Well, you best start praying. Nothing else seems to come to mind," Kingsley huffed as he braided his fingers together.</p><p>"If I just had a few more people," Hermione grumbled.</p><p>"I could ask, but it would go unanswered. Every country in the world is scared for its own longevity. If magic disappears, we are finished," the minister voiced.</p><p>Hermione set her cup down and scowled. "It won't disappear. Whatever affected them, it cannot be replicated. So, in conclusion, of that thought, we are the only ones who can reverse it."</p><p>Kingsley's eyes met hers, and she could see the culmination of defeat. "I don't know what much else we can give, Hermione."</p><p>Her form straightened as she stood from her seat. "Then we must receive help elsewhere, Minister Shacklebolt. I will check the Hall of Mysteries tomorrow and clear my schedule on the chance I find something. Today I'll be on my way to see how McGonagall is holding up for this year."</p><p>"Just," Kingsley started with a massive groan. "Don't do anything rash. We need you."</p><p>Hermione nodded before taking her mug from the desk. "I will be safe. See you tomorrow, Kingsley."</p><hr/><p>The trip to Hogwarts was painful. It was barren and quiet as she walked the halls toward the Headmistress's office. Hogwarts was a shell of its former glory. The only benefit to being the liaison for international and child welfare was seeing Teddy between his Potions and Charms class. He was still fine. The world still had love and magic in it- it just was hard to find.</p><p>Her detour after work was planned. They all were registered and monitored now. A list that was slim and delicate as the year had progressed. Her adventure took her from the rotted boot in the field to a lovely farmhouse. It was a beautiful home, by anyone's standards, and Hermione had told them so several times.</p><p>Ginny was out in the garden, watering her flowers when Hermione approached. "Another tough week?" She questioned while continuing her task.</p><p>Hermione hummed before shifting on the path to the front door. "When hasn't it been difficult? A whole year has gone by. I get back from Germany just in time for the anniversary. I have no answers to give."</p><p>"Harry and I don't envy you," Ginny mumbled.</p><p>"Can you still do magic when he is working?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Ginny set down her watering can and arched an eyebrow at the witch. "Is the ministry asking or my friend?"</p><p>The smile that breached Hermione's lips was warm. "Your friend."</p><p>"Yes, but it's lessened. We stopped worrying about a cure a couple of months back. Harry is happy, and our children are healthy. We don't need much else," Ginny responded while walking up to Hermione. "We miss you," she sighed.</p><p>Hermione embraced the redhead and shuddered. "I miss you both so much."</p><p>"How's Grimmauld?" Ginny asked when pulling away.</p><p>"Lonely," Hermione mumbled. "I research until my eyes see double and go to work. There's not much else I can do."</p><p>"I wish we could help," Ginny said before pursing her lips.</p><p>"Ask for a magical intervention?" Hermione puffed with a twisted smile.</p><p>Ginny laughed while rocking her head. "That's not much to ask for, now is it?"</p><p>"Have you heard from Ron? He stopped writing to me two months ago."</p><p>"No," Ginny mumbled and tossed a hand. "Let's go have some tea. I'm sure the children would love to see you."</p><p>"I can't risk it, Gin. I have to go to the Hall of Mysteries again tomorrow. The Unspeakables left without explanation today. If it weren't for the tasks already in my schedule, I would have done it today," Hermione declared with a pinched frown.</p><p>Ginny exhaled with a nod. "You do what you have to do, Hermione. Merlin knows if anyone could find answers, it's you."</p><p>"It bears repeating- I could use some help," Hermione groaned.</p><p>"Well, we'll ask for it for you. That's all we can do from here," Ginny grimaced.</p><p>Hermione bobbed her head. "Thank you. I love you all."</p><p>"We love you too."</p><p>Hermione was walking down the pathway toward the gate.</p><p>"Hermione," Ginny called, causing her to look back.</p><p>Ginny's face was distorted with a mixture of agony and pity. "Do try to find someone who would stand by you in the face of the inconceivable, alright?"</p><p>"I will," Hermione responded.</p><p>She left her best friend's farmhouse with a heavy heart. Nothing in the world felt more alone than being one of only a thousand magical people left in Britain. She hoped this was the only year for that. Hermione Granger prayed for a miracle.</p><hr/>
