</p><p> </p><p>This story originated from a "pic fic", featured above. It was only meant to be a glimpse, but this one had more to say. Image credit to Warner Bros., JK Rowling, and my_eternal_prince_severus_Snape/tumblr<br/>*******</p><hr/><p> *Just for clarity, Harry is 17 in this story.</p><p>!!THIS STORY CONTAINS SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ MASTERPIECE-SEVERUS (It's not necessary to read that story to follow this one)!!</p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Yes, this is highly irregular, but this is a highly irregular situation. We've not seen this kind of magic in thousands of years. Modern laws and principles will not do for this situation. They will not keep us safe. The boy is very powerful and very dangerous."</p><p>"But Albus, there must be someone else."</p><p>"Severus, you're the only one I trust with teaching him to channel is magic through his body, and away from his anger."</p><p>"Albus, you are cruel. You know my relationship with him."</p><p>"A relationship that you pretend does not exist. What's another night of pretense?"</p><p>"He's... he's my son." It was barely a whisper, and filled with revulsion for having to admit it. Albus had promised he'd never have to speak of it.</p><p>"There are cultures where it is quite appropriate for a parent to provide valuable, personal instruction to their offspring, Severus. This is no different."</p><p>"You expect me to touch him. I will not."</p><p>"He never has to know, Severus. Don't you want to arm him with as much protection as possible? For one night, forget who he is and teach him what he needs to know. It will save his life."</p><p>"If I do this, I'll have to resign. It's hard enough teaching around him. This would make it unbearable. Is there no limit to what you would ask me to do, to prove my loyalty?"</p><p>"Is there no limit to what you would do to keep hims safe?"</p><p>Snape lowered his head. They both knew there was no limit to what he would do.</p><p>"I'm afraid I'm giving you no choice in this matter. You are the most qualified and unless you help, Harry will continue to be a danger to himself and others. We must leave the secular world, and its morals, behind in this matter. I'm ordering you to take him to the dungeons and to be a proper teacher to him. Neither of you will be allowed to leave until the act is accomplished."</p><p>With that, Albus turned and left Snape standing alone in his empty classroom. Forever alone, and on the wrong side of everything.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Top stories by this writer:</p><p>
