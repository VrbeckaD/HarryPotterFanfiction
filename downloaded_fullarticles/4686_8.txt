          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">Harriet paced in her dormitory, thankful she was alone for the moment. She was contemplating how she could be a Hogwarts Champion and the-girl-who-lived and still not have a date for the Yule Ball. Was she just that disliked? It couldn't be that she intimidated people, like Hermione. Even Hermione had been asked. She'd kept it a secret until Ron messed up and asked her after he'd tried a few other options like she was his last resort.</p>
<p align="justify">Neither of them had asked her if she had a date. Apparently, they just assumed she did. Even Professor McGonagall had told her that she and her date would be required to open the floor to dancing by dancing first with the other three Champions. Harriet had wanted to sink through the floor like a ghost. She hadn't had the mind to tell McGonagall that she didn't have a date and now there was less than a week to the event.</p>

The shop clerk had suggested dark green to go with her eyes and since she'd never had formal clothes before she went with the suggestion.

It was too dark to be Slytherin House colours but it was still green and...</p>
<p align="justify">She sighed. No one was going to see them; she didn't have a date. She would rather miss the entire thing than show up alone and be berated by McGonagall. Being scolded for not being popular enough for a date would be the ultimate humiliation.</p>
<p align="justify">She wished Ron would have just asked her.</p></div>
