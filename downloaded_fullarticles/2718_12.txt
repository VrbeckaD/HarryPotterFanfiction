Hermione cried.</p><p>Crookshanks was purring loudly, rubbing his head under Hermiones chin, his Curly haired Human was back, he had missed her.</p><p>Hermione was crying with happiness at having her familiar back, the war was finally over, they had survived, things would be different for all of them, but this was some sort of normality Hermione needed.</p><p>" Bill...thank you for bringing him to me, I was so afraid I would never see him again...He is all I have now...apart from your family and Harry...my parents memory charm can't be reversed...you know the story of why I did it."</p><p>Bill just smiled at the young witch, he was very fond of Hermione, she was extremely brave with all that had happened during the last year.</p><p>She and Luna Lovegood were staying with him at Shell Cottage until the chaos at the Ministry had been sorted, when she and Harry with Ron would have to give evidence in the upcoming war trials.</p><p>His Marriage to Fleur hadn't survived the war, she had left after the battle of Hogwarts, going back home to France, In hindsight they should never have married, he realised now that they were not right for each other, they had agreed to divorce, but it would take time and then they would both get on with their lives.</p><p> "It's nice to see you smile again...I think he's happy to be back with you...we looked after him the best we could while you were away, but its not the same as being with the ones that love you." Bill replied.</p><p>"That is true...I'm glad to have my familiar back...so I'm feline fine!" Hermione grinned at Bill.</p><p>" Clever one!...bit early in the day for corny jokes Miss Granger!" Laughed Bill.</p><p>Hermione just giggled softly, she went to sit in the armchair by the fire place, still cuddling the purring Crookshanks to her.</p><p>Bill made them both some tea, it seemed natural for all of them to be sitting together in the lounge, it was something they both could get used to.</p><p>In time it became familiar for them to all sit together on a sofa, but in a new home called Hollyhock Cottage, after Bill's divorce was finalised he and Hermione started dating, she had decided to finish her final year at Hogwarts, after which she had taken up writing, she had several books published.</p><p>They had bought Hollyhock Cottage, got married and then had their son little Arthur, whom Crookshanks adored as much as his curly haired human.</p><p>Fin~</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
