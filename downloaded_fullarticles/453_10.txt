  <em>July 19, 1980</em>
</p>
<p>Severus Snape awoke to the sound of frantic but light knocking on the door.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, immediately closed them again, and let out a groan of pain at the morning rays that had stabbed him during that brief exposure.</p>
<p><em>Where in Merlin’s name am I</em>, he thought to himself, <em>and exactly how much did I drink last night</em>?</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and attempted to take stock of himself. His head was pounding, and he had the sour taste of vomit lingering in his mouth. He pushed himself partly upright, before surrendering once again to his spinning head, and returning to his temporary home on the floor.</p>
<p><em>Merlin’s beard,</em> he thought, <em>I’m still drunk.</em></p>
<p>After a moment to gather his reserves, Snape opened his eyes again, very carefully, and looked up at the ceiling. Wood beams. An ancient porcelain toilet was just visible on his right, and a sink could just be made out on his left. He felt the floor around him. Stone tile, rather grimy. Outside, the sound of quiet conversation and the faint clinking of stoneware mugs.</p>
<p>The Hog’s Head. Specifically, the floor of the pub’s bathroom.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the knocking on the door started up again, and a woman’s tremulous voice spoke out. “Hello? Is someone in there? Please, I need to get in to the bathroom — I’m feeling rather unwell, decidedly odd…”</p>
<p>“A moment,” Snape gasped out, as he righted himself. He made his way to the sink, and splashed some water on his face. He looked up at himself in the mirror, red-rimmed eyes little more than holes in a gaunt face. He then dried himself on the hem of his stained robes, cast a quick Scourgify to clean up the mess he had left on the floor, and lurched over to the door.</p>
<p>He pulled the door open, where he was greeted by the largest pair of glasses he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He caught only the briefest glimpse of them, however, as the shawl-clad woman who wore said glasses quickly pushed by him, and slammed and latched the bathroom door.</p>
<p>Snape leaned against the wall for a moment, breathing deeply and trying to reconstruct the events of the previous night. He recalled a drinking contest with Mundungus Fletcher — the man was scum, barely counted as a wizard at all, but he had connections, and cultivating that contact could be useful to him and his associates.</p>
<p>He drew his wand again, quietly cast a few cleaning charms on himself, and was about to leave to report in, when he heard the sound of retching from the bathroom — as if the woman who had pushed by him were trying to cough up something larger than herself. Snape hesitated, and looked back. The retching was continuing, and actually gaining in volume.</p>
<p>Snape gingerly walked back over to the door, and put his eye to the keyhole — something of interest was happening here, that was clear, and it would undoubtedly be to his benefit to find out what it was. But how to gain entry, Snape wondered.</p>
<p>Nothing was visible through the keyhole. Snape drew his wand to cast an Enhanced Senses charm, when in an instant, the world around him disappeared.</p>
<p>A harsh voice spoke within the bathroom, and Snape found himself utterly and completely captivated by it — unable to see, think, move, feel, smell, or hear anything else. All his world had narrowed to that voice, and the words it spoke.</p>
<p>It said, “THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES…BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM, BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES…”</p>
<p>These words slammed in to Snape like the fist of a God, imprinting themselves and their meaning indelibly upon his mind. He could barely think through the force of them, but he knew, dimly, that what he was hearing was a prophecy — and that the prophecy was meant for <em>him</em> to hear. Meanwhile, the voice continued:</p>
<p>“AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL, BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT… AND EITHER SHALL MEET THEIR END AT THE HANDS OF THE OTHER, FOR NEITHER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES…”</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, like a man rising to the surface from underwater, Snape’s world and awareness returned to him.</p>
<p>Shaking slightly, his hands moved to his head to rub his eyes, and he found his feet bringing him over to the bar again. He motioned vaguely to the barman, who seemed to understand what he wanted without even a word, and he brought over a small glass of firewhiskey.</p>
<p>Snape downed the glass in one shot, and motioned for another.</p>
<p><em>That voice</em>, he thought to himself, as the barman poured him another glass. <em>I’ve never heard anything like that before. That was — it must have been — a prophecy</em>.</p>
<p>Snape downed his second glass, and felt his pounding head from earlier begin to lessen. He sat at the bar for a moment, clutching his glass and pondering, when a rich, pleasant voice spoke up behind him. “Starting rather early in the day, aren’t we, Severus?”</p>
<p>Snape turned around, and found himself looking into the smiling face and twinkling eyes of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Heh - Headmaster Dumbledore! What a surprise to see you here,” Snape stammered out, and plastered a surprised but friendly smile on his face, as a part of him shrieked internally and slammed up Occlumency barriers as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>Dumbledore chuckled, and said, “Though I am quite partial to Rosemerta’s mulled mead, when I find myself longing for a quieter atmosphere in which to drink, I come here. I’m rather fond of this place, you see,” he said, nodding and smiling slightly at the barman, who nodded back.</p>
<p>“Ah, I didn’t realize that, but will have to keep an eye out for you the next time I’m here,” said the outward Snape pleasantly, giving no sign of his internal panic, as the inward Snape looked desperately for a way out of the situation.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling, and continued, “It is always a pleasure to run into a former student. I trust you’ve been doing well since your graduation, last summer? And staying out of trouble, as well, I hope?”</p>
<p>Snape outwardly smiled, and said, “Thank you, Headmaster; you’re very kind. And yes, I’ve been doing, ah, quite well, and I certainly do my best to, ah, stay out of any dangerous situations,” as he inwardly screamed and ran around in circles, and ever so briefly considered cutting off his left arm at the shoulder and incinerating it, to more effectively hide the tattoo that burned there.</p>
<p>“As well as any of us can in these troubled times, eh, Severus?” said Dumbledore. “By the by,” he continued thoughtfully, “you didn’t happen to see a woman down here, did you?”</p>
<p>Snape looked around at the near-deserted barroom, in which no women were in evidence, and said, “Are you looking for any woman in particular, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she was rather short, with a shawl and a large pair of glasses,” said Dumbledore, looking around himself and frowning. “I don’t see her, though — perhaps she stepped out?”</p>
<p>Snape started, and the outward Snape — the Snape who had nothing whatsoever to hide — smiled, and said, “Ah, Headmaster, I believe she just stepped into the bathroom a few moments ago. I’m sure she’ll be right out,” as he inwardly started swearing repeatedly and made ready to apparate upon the instant.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you, Severus," Dumbledore beamed, and made his way over to the bathroom. “I <em>am</em> sorry to leave you so suddenly, but I have several other interviews scheduled for the day — but I’m sure I shall see you again, quite soon,” said Dumbledore, smiling as he went.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Headmaster, and a very good day to you as well,” said Snape with enforced calm, placing a few Sickles on the bar. As he walked out the door, he glanced over his shoulder — the prophetess had left the bathroom, and she and Dumbledore were talking quietly.</p>
<p>Snape kept his breathing calm and his stride regular as he walked out the door, and around the corner. He glanced around to ensure the streets were empty, then plastered his hand against the wall for support, and leaned there for a moment, breathing heavily. The world spun around him.</p>
<p><em>What did I just hear?</em> Snape wondered to himself. <em>And what will the Dark Lord make of it when I tell him?</em></p>
<p>With an inward sigh, Snape girded himself, and made ready to apparate back to his master.</p>

<p>DARK MARK SIGHTED OVER GODRIC’S HOLLOW</p>
<p>NOBLE HOUSE EXTINCT; “DEATH EATER” TERRORISTS TO BLAME</p>
<p>DMLE Head Crouch: “We will find you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By Andy Smudgley, Martin Amerinus, and Kikis Trecus</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>LIVE:</em> <em>This space will update with additional reporting via Protean Charm!</em></p>
<p>Residents of the sleepy village of Godric’s Hollow awoke today to a scene of utter horror. The terrorist group calling themselves the “Death Eaters” has struck again — this time at the heart of one of the oldest wizarding communities in Britain.</p>
<p>Their distinctive green skull-and-snake logo was first sighted by Bathilda Bagshot, a longtime resident and notable historian, shortly after she awoke at 5:15 AM. She immediately notified the Ministry, and Department of Magical Law Enforcement Hit Wizards and Auror triads were quickly summoned, and the town was placed under lockdown.</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation by Ministry authorities revealed that the “Death Eater” attack had been highly localized, as has been typical of the group in the past. The initial Ministry investigation has discovered five people killed, and one wounded. The attack appears to have occurred at the home of Frank and Alice Longbottom, located at 10 Lion Street; both were found dead inside, clear victims of the Killing Curse, along with their infant son, Neville. Also found were the bodies of Julius and Augusta Longbottom, Frank’s parents, who according to witnesses were visiting for the weekend.</p>
<p>Additionally, Charlus Potter, of the neighboring Potter family, was struck by an unknown Dark curse during the night. This was not discovered until Aurors arrived at the house at 5:37 AM to ensure the safety of the inhabitants. Thankfully, the curse was not immediately fatal, and he survived long enough to be stabilized on the scene by a trained DMLE medi-wizard, and was promptly Flooed to St. Mungo’s along with his wife, Dorotea.</p>
<p>As of press time, no other casualties or injuries have been reported, but the village remains under lockdown until Ministry officials can verify that the threat has dissipated.</p>
<p>As the more socially aware of our readers will already know, the demise of the Longbottom family in the night represents the ending of that Noble House — the Sacred Twenty-Eight have now been reduced to Twenty-Seven. Additionally, the attack upon the Longbottom family represents an alarming change for the “Death Eaters” and their leader, the wizard who styles himself “Lord Voldemort”. Previously, their attacks have been largely directed against Muggle communities, and have occurred, at most, once or twice a year. This, however, represents the second attack on a wizarding community by the group within the last six months, and the fifth so far this year.</p>
<p>Department of Magical Law Enforcement Head Bartemius Crouch was also on the scene, and took the opportunity to say, “Whoever has done this — Death Eaters, or whatever you call yourselves — I say this to you now: You will not get away with this. We will find you.”</p>
<p>According to Ministry press officials, a statement by Minister for Magic Millicent Bagnold will be forthcoming later today. Please watch this space for further updates.</p>
