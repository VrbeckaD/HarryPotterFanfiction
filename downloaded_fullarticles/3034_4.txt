        <strong>Chapter One</strong>
      </p><p>Hermione's hands trembled. She couldn't believe that the battle was over. Voldemort had finally been defeated, but at what cost? The death of so many?</p><p>As she looked around the ruins of Hogwarts, her heart ached painfully. The price of winning had been far too high. She took a few steps forward, wandering aimlessly. She knew that she should be inside, with Harry and the Weasleys, mourning the loss of Fred. She should be mourning the loss of Tonks and Remus. Lavender. Colin.</p><p>She took in a shaky breath. Glancing at the wand in her hand, Hermione felt completely lost. Was magic worth all the pain that she felt? Did she make the right choices? What if she had left with her parents?</p><p>Not knowing what else to do or where to go, Hermione drifted her way down to the Great Lake. She took a seat, gazing at the lake. She could see the Giant Squid move beneath the dark surface of the lake.</p><p>Now that she was completely alone, Hermione allowed herself to cry. The tears fell quickly, running down her cheeks. She couldn't catch her breath, sniffing loudly. It wasn't fair. None of it was fair.</p><p>"Are you all right?"</p><p>Startled, Hermione turned, wand raised. She relaxed slightly when she saw Theo Nott standing there. He held his hands up to show her that he meant no harm. Hermione lowered her wand.</p><p>"Are you all right?" he asked once more.</p><p>"No," she whispered, hating how broken she sounded. Her hands clenched into fists in her lap. "No, I am not all right." She reached up, wiping the tears from her face. While she only knew Theo from their short time studying together during Ancient Runes, she knew that he wouldn't hurt her.</p><p>"Me either," Theo announced, taking a seat next to her. "I had to get away from the smell…"</p><p>Hermione nodded numbly. She knew what he meant. The scent of smoke and death surrounded Hogwarts. It was enough to turn anyone's stomach. She could still smell the iron from the dried blood on her own body.</p><p>She began to cry once more, unable to stop. Theo took her into his arms, holding her tightly as she cried. He stroked her hair, holding her. From the way his own body shook, Hermione knew that Theo was crying too.</p>
<hr/><p>She didn't see Theo again after their meeting by the lake. It had been a strange encounter, but she hadn't given it much thought. Every so often, however, her thoughts would drift to Theo. She wondered where he was and how he was doing.</p><p>"Hermione."</p><p>She shook her head, glancing up at Harry. "Sorry," she apologised, knowing that she often got distracted when others were talking.</p><p>"I really think you should see someone," Harry said firmly. He looked at her sympathetically. "You don't sleep anymore, you barely eat… I'm worried for you. Ron is too."</p><p>"You told him?" Hermione snapped angrily. The only way Ron would know was if Harry had told him, as Ron had moved to Romania to live with Charlie shortly after the battle had ended.</p><p>"How could I not?" Harry retorted. "Look at yourself. You have circles beneath your eyes that I'm sure are permanent. You never gained the weight you lost while we were on the run, in fact, you look like you've lost even more. It's not healthy, Hermione."</p><p>"Don't you think I know that?" Hermione hissed. "I don't need you babying me, Harry."</p><p>He looked hurt at her words. "You know I'm only doing it because I care, Hermione. Please, let me take you to St. Mungo's."</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Harry… I…" She shook her head a second time. "I'm fine," she lied. "Totally fine."</p><p>"I don't believe you."</p><p>"Doesn't matter," Hermione retorted, standing. "I love you, Harry, but just stop, okay? I'm an adult. I can handle this." Leaving a Galleon on the table to cover the price of her coffee, Hermione stormed from the café angrily.</p><p>Once she was in Diagon Alley, Hermione Disapparated to the small flat she owned on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. Once inside, she headed towards her bedroom, grabbing one of the phials of Dreamless Sleep. She drank it, falling onto her bed in exhaustion. Hopefully, she'd be able to actually sleep.</p>
<hr/><p>Groggily, Hermione opened her eyes when she heard a knocking on her front door. Slipping on her bathrobe, Hermione made her way down the stairs. She gripped her wand tightly, the paranoia consuming her. It was five in the morning… Who would be disturbing her at this time?</p><p>She opened her front door, wand at the ready in case it was someone who meant her harm. A small gasp of shock escaped her lips as she stared at the sight before her. Theo was holding up a bloodied Draco Malfoy. Theo himself was sporting a bruised eye.</p><p>"Theo?" she asked incredulously.</p><p>"Granger, please, help us."</p></div></div></div><div class="maxwidth">
