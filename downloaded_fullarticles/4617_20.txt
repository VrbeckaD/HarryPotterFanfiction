  <i>O never give the heart outright,</i><br/>

<i>And who could play it well enough</i><br/>
<i>If deaf and dumb and blind with love?</i><br/>

<p>It's unsettling how rain always brings back memories, especially the 
unwelcomed ones that should be buried in the deepest corners of his mind 
and never brought to light. He could not help it, however, that the 
slightly eerie view of neatly cut trees and rosebushes in the Manor's 
gardens separated from him only by the glass of his study's window, now 
bleary because of the many raindrops, reminded him of another deep green 
behind the glass.</p>
<p>For the name of Merlin, why think about him now? He was glad not to
spare him a thought, apart from that influenced by articles in the Daily
Prophet, for the past nineteen years, so why start now? Now when he
finally had a seemingly perfect life of his own. Life with only
occasional letter from his parents hidden safely in their unplottable
manor in Bordeaux, his beautiful pureblood wife, his perfect son and his
fortune which, although slightly depleted by the Ministry as atonement
for the family's wrongdoings during the war, was still indecently huge.
One look at the desk where a letter from his son lay gave him the
answer. Scorpius was sorted into Slytherin, just like every Malfoy in
recorded history, and seemed to immensely enjoy Hogwarts. Everything was
going to be exactly as he expected it to be. Everything except for one
detail, or should he say <i>person</i>. His son's new housemate and friend
Albus Severus <i>Potter</i>. He had a nagging feeling that this boy will
shatter the fragile tranquillity of his life just as his father did
twenty six years ago. Malfoys and Potters were supposed to be
archenemies or school rivals at the very least and not best friends.
Adversaries is what they are and always will be, this is the only way it
could ever be, the only way it was for him. And yet he tried so hard to
give Scorpius a perfect childhood that he had never had. But could he do
it? Wasn't it asking too much? What right did he have to take something
from his son simply because it had been taken from him many years ago.</p>
<p>He had a life to live, a reputation to uphold and, most pressingly, a
party to host and he would be damned if he let himself ruin it by
thinking about those bewitching green eyes behind old glasses. He
stepped out of his study and into the hall roaring with music and
laughter, the emptiness in his heart buried deep and ignored. Until the
next rainy day.</p></div>
