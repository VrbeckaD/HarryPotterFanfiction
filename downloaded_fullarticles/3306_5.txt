    <p>It was a quiet Thursday afternoon. Draco had been planning to spend it reading in the drawing room. The book was a particularly rare one he had found in a second-hand shop at the far end of Diagon Alley. But then a certain Theodore Nott arrived with news from blabbermouth Weaslette.</p><p>‘You are not seriously thinking about it are you?’ Theo demanded, barging through the doors. He was hoping against hopes that his best friend would prove him wrong.</p><p>‘What are you talking about, Theo?’ Draco asked, making no effort to hide his irritation. He hoped if he refused to move from his seat by the window then his melodramatic friend would leave him in peace.</p><p>‘Eloping?’ Nott clarified as he began pacing in a frantic manner before the fireplace. ‘Running away with Granger and skipping off into the sunset, forever disinherited? Do you even know what that means, Draco? You would not only lose the Manor but the whole estate! That includes the Gringotts vaults AND your father’s investments. You lose your father’s seat on the Wizengmot. Your position, your influence, your name. All of it. Gone. Poof. Your entire way of life flushed down the drain for a girl. You are the last heir!’</p><p>‘So?’ Draco asked without looking up from his page.</p><p>‘So!’ Theo scoffed. Beads of perspiration were beginning to make their way down his strained forehead. In his haste Theo had neglected to remove his cloak. ‘When your father dies the whole lot of it would fold because there is no one else to inherit it. It will all get sold off to the highest bidder and most likely ripped up. The art collection alone would be flung across the globe. The library! It makes me cringe just thinking about it!’</p><p>‘About what?’ He drawled. Draco was well acquainted with Theo’s love of books. He always nagged him about turning down page corners. Apparently, it hurts the book’s feelings.</p><p>‘It would be slit up; one of the oldest, and largest, private collections in Britain!’ Theo moaned. 'Everything your ancestors have striven to create for centuries! All dashed because you fell in love with a mudblood!’</p><p>‘Don’t call her that!’ Draco snapped indignantly, whipping round to glare at his friend. Neither him or Theo had called anyone <em>that</em> since the end of the war.</p><p>‘Fine,’ Theo sighed almost mockingly, ‘Muggleborn. You know your life will never be the same.’</p><p>‘I know.’</p><p>‘You would have to get a job and work for <em>money</em> so you could <em>live.</em>’</p><p>‘I know.’</p><p>‘Your children wouldn’t see a penny of this.’</p><p>
  <em>‘I know.’</em>
</p><p>‘Do you? Do you really?’ Theo inquired, glaring at Draco as if he were trying to see into his soul. Draco could feel the scepticism radiating off his friend in waves. ‘You are completely changing your children’s futures, not just your own.’</p><p>‘They don’t have to disinherit me!’ Draco pointed out, swivelling round in his seat to get a better look at Theo. He needed to get that boy off his soap box.</p><p>‘Yes, they do, Draco,’ Theo said firmly, ‘You know that they do.’</p><p>‘Why? What’s so bad about mixing blood? It’s all bullshit anyway- you know that it is!’</p><p>‘Yes, I do, Draco,’ Theo signed, exasperated, ‘but that’s not the point and you know it!’</p><p>‘This isn’t happening,’ Draco insisted, thrusting himself out of his chair in frustration. ‘This can’t be happening.'</p><p>‘Well, it is Draco,’ said a calm voice from the doorway.</p><p>‘Mother!’ Draco snapped, greeting her with an obviously fake smile before turning back to the window in frustration. He knew from her expression she had overheard far too much of their conversation.</p><p>‘Mrs. Malfoy,’ Theo sang, striding over to greet her. His counterpart continued his pretence of surveying the grounds.</p><p>‘Nice to see you again, Theodore.’ Narcissa had never made any effort to hide her approval of him, and now was no different. Theo had been one of the boys Narcissa herself had picked out to be a playmate of Draco’s when he was young. She was glad he had proved to be a loyal and worthy friend to Draco over the years. Especially as Lucius’s choices (two of his friend's sons) had failed in that department.</p><p>‘And you Mrs. Malfoy.’</p><p>‘We haven’t seen you here in a while. How are things over at Nott Manor?’ Narcissa asked with genuine concern. The boys may be adults but in her mind's eye they were still messing about in the garden, pestering the house elves.</p><p>‘Challenging,’ Theo confessed. ‘What with Father being in Azkaban. But I have the best lawyers helping me smooth everything out.’</p><p>‘Well, that’s good hear, isn’t it Draco?’</p><p>‘Spiffing,’ he replied through gritted teeth. He knew what was coming but also that there was no avoiding it this time.</p><p>‘Would you please let me have word with my son, Theo? I don’t mean to be rude-'</p><p>‘There is nothing to apologise for, Mrs. Malfoy,’ Theo said graciously. ‘I understand completely. I should be going anyway.’</p><p>‘I hope we will see you soon,’ Narcissa smiled kindly. She thought it must be lonely in that big house.</p><p>‘The feeling is mutual, I assure you. Goodbye, Mrs. Malfoy. Draco,’ Theo trailed off. He threw a worried glance towards his statuesque friend before ducking out.</p><p>‘That was rude Draco,’ his mother reprimanded, ‘and uncalled for. He is your friend!’</p><p>‘Really? I’m not so sure…’ Draco replied still making a show of staring out the window.</p><p>‘He is trying to help you!’ she cried, she would not have her son push people away after he had already lost so much.</p><p>‘He is against me!’ Draco shouted, turning to face his mother at last. It always struck him how pale she was, even after all these years. The war had changed her, he knew that, and he hated it.</p><p>‘I thought you were different, Draco,’ Narcissa sighed wearily. She sunk into a seat near the fire. ‘I didn’t think you wanted to surround yourself with 'Yes Men' like your father.’</p><p>‘I don’t,’ Draco replied angrily as he strode over to the mantel.</p><p>‘You want people around you who will tell you the truth,’ she continued as if he hadn’t spoken. ‘Even if you don’t want to hear it. You need people like that.’</p><p>‘Yes,’ Draco acknowledged more calmly. He began to fiddle with the cuff of his jacket. He could see his frail mother in the corner of his eye.</p><p>‘Well,’ Narcissa remarked, ‘that is what you have in Theodore. It isn’t a common trait, don’t push him away because of this.’</p><p>‘Theo said you would have to disinherit me,’ Draco's voice was soft, all the energy draining out of him. He perched on the chair opposite his mother, ‘I don’t know what he meant by that.’</p><p>‘Yes, you do Draco,’ Narcissa said, closing her watery eyes, ‘the curse is still in play.’</p><p>‘That’s real?’ Draco asked, astonished. He looked over at her, searching for reassurance, but for the first time, she wasn't looking at him.</p><p>‘Yes,’ Narcissa almost laughed at her son’s ignorance. ‘Did you think we had made it up?’</p><p>‘I thought Father had made it up,’ he confessed, feeling rather foolish. ‘To scare me out of marrying anyone not of pureblood.’</p><p>‘No,’ she confirmed sombrely, as she opened her eyes again. The severity of the situation seemed to be sinking into the optimistic heart of her young son. ‘It’s real.’</p><p>‘So what you are saying is that if I married her, I would be condemning her to death?’</p><p>‘You know the story,’ Narcissa answered in the way of an acknowledgement.</p><p>‘Yes. In the 17th century, fearing the pollution of the Malfoy blood, Atticus Malfoy wrote in his will that all who marry those of impure blood, and were not disinherited, would suffer his curse. The year after, his youngest grandson married a muggleborn witch. As he was not due to inherit, his parents saw no reason to fear the curse. The night of their wedding his new wife died horrifically as her insides burned. A few generations later a son decided to take a half-blood as a wife. She was from a well-respected family, equal in society to any of pureblood. They married peacefully and the next morning she was still alive. But the curse came on her when she was carrying their first child. It caused her to give birth prematurely and she died in the process. The child itself was horribly disfigured and died also. The son then went mad with grief and took his own life. It’s true?’</p><p>‘Their graves are in the family cemetery. I am so sorry, Draco.’</p><p>‘There must be a way to break to curse,’ Draco said with a determination that hurt Narcissa more than she would say.</p><p>‘Would you believe me if I told you I had already looked?’ Narcissa confessed, begging for her son to believe her. ‘That your father and I spent hours searching for just that. We hired dozens of professionals, including Bill Weasley.’</p><p>‘Did you really?’ Draco asked in awed.</p><p><br/>
‘Of course,’ Narcissa nodded, 'everything had changed since the war. Even Lucius could see that.</p><p>‘When?’</p><p>‘Right after you brought her to meet us for the first time. We knew, this time, things were different. I am truly sorry, Draco, but there is nothing to be done.’</p><p>‘I- I love her.’</p><p>‘I know,’ Narcissa reassured him as her heart broke for her son.</p><p>‘So, you are telling me that I have to choose. I have to choose between her and this.’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘The curse is really real?’ Draco asked again. Maybe he had misunderstood her at some point, or this was some elaborate practical joke.</p><p>‘Yes, the curse is real,’ Narcissa reiterated as she rose from her chair. ‘There are many curses on this family, Draco, but none as cruel as this.’</p><p>‘I think I need to be alone for a while,’ Draco concluded, rising to stand before his mother. For some reason he couldn’t meet her eye. He understood now, maybe in a way he never had before, what his father meant when he used to talk about duty. Now Draco had to decide where his duty lay.</p><p>‘Take as long as you need,’ she whispered. She stroked his unkempt hair, taking this time to look at him. Today she could lose her son or he could lose himself. Gathering her courage, she left, just as Theo had. This time, Draco was alone.</p><p>He had thought silence and solitude would help him clear his head. Instead, the weight of it was all he needed to tip things over the edge. Enraged, Draco marched over to where he had been sitting before Theo had barged into the room. He picked up the book he had been reading and threw it across the room. He thought it would help, it wasn’t enough. Now he ripped shelves of precious books out of their cases. He tipped over chairs and pulled screaming paintings from the walls. In a rage he grabbed a statue off the window sill and began thwacking it repeatedly against the stone family crest above the fire place. Ornaments and tapestries crashed to the ground but he paid them no heed. He hated this. He hated his ignorant ancestors and his loving parents. He hated this impossible choice he had to make. Draco almost wished his mother had not been so kind. Maybe then it would be easier to leave.</p><p>For three hours Draco sat despondently surrounded by the chaos he had created. Finally, he knew what he had to do. He had to talk to her.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'Draco,’ Hermione sang as she opened the door for him, ‘what are you doing here?’</p><p>‘Can we talk?’ Draco asked, shuffling his feet in the doorway.</p><p>‘Sure, come in,’ Hermione called. She continued to smile as she led the way into her warm apartment. She was putting on a pair of earrings whilst shuffling into a pair of royal blue pumps which matched her dress. ‘What is it?’</p><p>‘Are you going somewhere?’ Draco inquired. He followed her into the bathroom where she had been doing her makeup. This wasn’t the kind of conversation you could have in a rush.</p><p>‘Only Harry and Ginny’s engagement party,’ Hermione laughed. It was one of the most anticipated events of the year. This was mostly because only a few people were going and the press had no idea what was actually happening. They kept making up all sorts of rubbish. ‘You are coming too, remember?’</p><p>‘Oh yeah, about t-that,’ Draco stuttered. Shit, he had completely lost track of time. ‘I can’t make it.’</p><p>‘Is that what this is about?’ Hermione coaxed. She appeared rather calm but Draco could tell she was deliberately not looking at him. He had seen her get ready in the time it took him to tie his shoes. She was stalling.</p><p>‘A bit,’ Draco speculated, ‘Not really.’</p><p>‘Well, spill it then.’ Hermione almost ordered as her patience began to run thin. The tension was almost audible.</p><p>‘Ok, fine.’ Draco asserted trying to remember how his mouth made words.</p><p>‘Breathe, Draco,’ Hermione reassured him, ‘then talk.’</p><p>‘Ok,’ Draco repeated, she was right, breathe, and then talk. Hermione is an intelligent woman, she’ll know what to do. ‘Right- you know how we were thinking about getting married?’</p><p>‘Yes?’ Hermione was grinning now, her annoyance from before seeming to evaporate. ‘My father loved that you asked his permission. He thought it very proper.’</p><p>‘Well, um, I talked to my parents.’ He informed her, trying to sound casual as he scratched the back of his head.</p><p>‘Please tell me you are doing the thing where you pretend it was terrible when in fact it went really well.' Hermione relaxed, believing her own lie.</p><p>‘Not exactly,’ Draco confessed.</p><p>‘What do you mean ‘not exactly’?’ she demanded. He could see she was trying to remain calm as she added the finishing touches to her make up.</p><p>‘I can’t marry you.’ Draco blurted out, causing Hermione to nearly poke herself in the eye with her mascara wand.</p><p>‘What!?’ Hermione yelled with venom in her voice as she whipped her head around so fast it appeared to be a blown blur.</p><p>‘We aren’t going to get married,’ Draco reiterated. He began to walk backwards away from the advancing Hermione.</p><p>‘…..why?’ She asked tentatively, still following him.</p><p>‘Please, just let me explain-’ Draco replied. He decided to hold his ground now he was in the more open space of the living room.</p><p>‘It’s because of my blood. Isn't it?’ Hermione spat, shaking her head. ‘I thought your parents had moved past that, I thought they liked me!’</p><p>‘They do-‘</p><p>‘Well, obviously not!’ Hermione remarked, taking another step forward. ‘If they don’t want me to marry you.’</p><p>‘Hermione, it’s not that simple,’ Draco tried to explain, running his hands frantically through his hair. This was not how this was supposed to go.</p><p>‘Oh, of course,’ Hermione sneered. ‘No, it never is, it’s ridiculous and you know it! They are nothing but a pair of spiteful Death Eaters who can’t see past the ends of their prejudiced noses!’</p><p>‘Hey, that’s uncalled for,’ Draco was shouting now too.</p><p>‘No, it’s not,’ Hermione exclaimed, ‘Draco- it’s the truth!’</p><p>‘Will you just listen-?’ Draco snapped.</p><p>‘No!’ Hermione cried, ‘I don’t want to hear what they have to say, I don’t want to know why they are dis-‘</p><p>After so much yelling the silence when Hermione cut herself off was almost as loud.</p><p>‘Hermione?’ Draco asked softly. Concerned, he took a step towards her but she took a step back like they were doing a strange dance, ‘Hermione, what is it?’</p><p>‘If you married me you would be disinherited,’ Hermione articulated. ‘That’s what they said, isn’t it?’</p><p>‘Yeah, so? You know that. That’s what this conversation is about!’</p><p>‘No, that is not what this conversation is about!’ Hermione almost shrieked. Tears now flowed freely down her face. ‘This conversation is about us not getting married! They made you choose between your inheritance and me and you chose the money! You said you would give up anything for me, that you couldn’t put a price on what we have. Was that just words to you?</p><p>‘Hermione, please, if you would just-‘ Draco begged, reaching out for her. If he could just get her to listen-</p><p>‘No!’ she groaned, batting his hand away as she recoiled from him. ‘I am not going to listen to you! Get out! Get out of my house and never come back!’</p>
