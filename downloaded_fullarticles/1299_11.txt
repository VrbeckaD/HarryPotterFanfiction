    <p>A year had passed since that war. Things were starting to slowly get rebuilt, houses, relationships, people. Everyone felt as though the scars might be too deep, it might never go back to the way it was. And those people were right, things did not revert back to their previous state, because difficult times reshape those affected. Even though life changed, some were still determined to not let it be a change for the worse. </p><p>Ginny Weasley was nothing if not goal oriented and striving forward. It was the summer before what would be her 7th year at hogwarts. She had been thoroughly shaken, exhausted and nearly broken from the strain of the previous year. As much as everyone supported her she felt weighted by the expectations of the people around her. So she decided to take a break from everything, leaving the cautious looks and too careful words at home. It was Ron that gave her the idea when inquiring about Charlie at dinner one night, making a remark on how long it would be before their mother would force him home to visit them again. The same night Ginny had sent a letter to her older brother, asking if there was any way she could come to him in Romania.</p><p>This was how, less than a month later, Ginny found herself on her way to Romania to go help raise dragons. Or whatever it was that her brother does, the details were not the part most important to her. What was important was that it was far away, in a place unmarked by the deaths of friends and family. The danger was something Molly Weasley had lamented multiple times, yet Ginny was not deterred. She had seen things she thought impossible to overcome, and she was still alive and breathing. If dragons were to be the death of her then so be it, time seemed more like loaned currency nowadays anyway. </p><p>She thought back to the night when she had made up her mind. It was a cold april night following a cold april day. The rain had started to fall in concurrence with the sun setting. Ginny stood outside, leaning out under the metal roof of a balcony, the occasional rain drop hitting her arms. A noisy smattering from the rain hitting the roof drowned out the noise coming from inside. A soft breeze swept in over the landscape and Ginny felt the chill brush past her. It was strangely comforting, keeping her mind focused on the noises and sensations around her. It kept her mind away from more sinister places.</p><p>A wave of noise came from the Burrow as a door was opened behind Ginny, before being cut off yet again with its closing.</p><p>"You really know how to get mom worked up." Percy said, handing her a blanket which she gratefully took and wrapped around her shoulders.</p><p>Ginny hummed in reply. And for the next few minutes they simply stood in silence, listening to the rain falling on the metal above. Percy stood with arms crossed, Ginny leaning out over the railing of the balcony, both gazing out into the night, not looking at anything in particular.</p><p>It was Ginny who broke the silence.</p><p>"Do you think I'm making a mistake?" She said, eyes not leaving the treeline in the distance. Her fingers every now and again tapping on the railing. </p><p>Percy took a moment to consider before replying. "No. I wouldn't consider it a mistake. Perhaps a bit reckless and impulsive. Not a mistake though. Even if you will consider it as such later you'll have at least learned something." He looked up at his sister, seeing her faraway look and slumped posture. "I think.. I think it could be good for you, getting away for a bit. Spending time and getting some distance from it all." He turned fully towards Ginny. "How long did you plan to be away?</p><p>"Until the start of the term." She briefly looked at Percy before returning to watching the swaying of the trees. The rain had started to fall heavier now, almost completely drowning out their voices.</p><p>"Alright. Just don't be a stranger, at least write to mum once in a while." The sound of the rain lay settled over them once more, filling the silence with its increasing spattering. </p><p>"You make it sound as if I'm going to disappear entirely, not for just a few months." Ginny said, having to fight down a yawn. She suddenly felt very tired. Pulling the blanket tighter around her she turned towards Percy.</p><p>"I'm not going to leave you, I'm not going to just go off and.." And die. The words hung heavy in the silence between them, Percy took off and wiped his glasses. Ginny turned back to the side, resting her head on her arms as they lay on the wood of the railing. Her eyes had started to droop, the rain softly relaxing her and her consciousness started to steadily fade. </p><p>"I'll owl Charlie as well, it might put mum at ease knowing more about the arrangements." Percy said, turning around and starting to head back inside. He stopped in the doorway, turning back once more.</p><p>“You can only run so far before your legs will start to give out, don’t go so far that we won't be able to reach you when you fall.” With that he took a last look at his sister, and went back inside.</p><p>Ginny nodded absentmindedly, too tired to really take in what was said. She felt herself drifting off into a slumber. Soothed by the fall of the rain she felt her eyes close and she let out a sigh. Her position was not ideal for sleeping, certainly not since she was standing up. But she was just so tired, so tired of having to be awake, of having to talk about the past, of having to be okay. Sleep overtook her and for a few minutes everything was calm, quiet and serene.</p><p>A loud 'CRACK' sounded and Ginny bolted upright. Breathing heavily and feeling a cold sweat run down her back. She was in her bedroom, sat in her bed and grasping her bedsheets so firmly her fingers ached. The room was suddenly bathed in light, shortly followed by another 'CRACK'. A bolt of lightning visible through the window. Ginny relaxed her fingers and feel back with a thud onto the bed. The rest of her sleep was fitful, her body tossing and turning all throughout the night. </p><p>Standing out in the middle of an open field doubt started to creep in to Ginny's mind. As she stood waiting to get picked up by one of Charlie’s.. Friends, colleagues, associates? She didn’t quite know the specifics, truth be told she started to feel as if she wasn’t nearly as well equipped for this as she had let on. What if she got there and they immediately sent her back because she was just a teenager, a teenager who hadn’t done any research on what she was getting into. Before her thoughts spiraled further a sound of heavy wing flaps broke the stillness of the open field. A few meters ahead of her a large green dragon beat its’ wings, making the grass bend over backwards in the strong breeze. It landed with more grace than thought possible for such a large creature. Huffing slightly the dragon looked around for a moment, before promptly starting to eat the grass. Atop it’s back sat a figure clad in what looked to be very durable leathers, with goggles on their head along with.. a pink bicycle helmet? The rider took of the goggles and cracked their neck back and forth before spotting Ginny.</p><p>“Sup? You Charlie’s sister?” The rider said, Ginny had to forcibly drag her attention away from the very. Big. Dragon. When she looked at the person they were quite short, shorter than Ginny and only further illustrating the massive stature of the dragon. </p><p>“Yeah, yeah that would be me.” Ginny felt herself starting to fiddle with the strap to her bag, not know what to do with herself in such a situation.</p><p>“Alrighty then, if you’ll just hop on up I’ll get us out of here and up and running in no time.” The person patted the dragon between its wings, causing it to look up momentarily before resuming its eating. “The name’s Lilith and this here is Lawn mower, pleasure meeting you.” Lilith did a two finger wave and hopped off of Lawn mower. Grabbing Ginny's bag and hoisting it up on the side of the dragon, fastening it to a hook in the saddle. She then turned to Ginny and offered her her hand.</p><p>“First time riding on one of these?” Lilith said, turning to better assist in getting Ginny up. Ginny nodded, her inner monologue trying to convince her that surely this couldn’t be too different from flying on a broom.</p><p>“Well then, my advice to you is to hold on tight and lean forwards. I doubt Charlie will appreciate you falling off on the way.” Seeing the expression on Ginny’s face Lilith started to back pedal. “Though not to say this isn’t a safe way to travel, even if you do fall we’ll catch you. So don’t go worrying too hard.” She pushed one final time and Ginny found herself on top of Lawn mower, adjusting herself to the two person saddle and looking for anything she could grab hold of. </p><p>“You not one much for talking?” Lilith said, climbing up into her seat in front of Ginny.</p><p>Ginny cleared her throat. “No I do, just not quite used to.. this.” She gestured down towards the dragon. She could her more than see the smile in Liliths voice.</p><p>“Well, you’re gonna get plenty of time to get used to it.” And with that the urged on Lawn mower and they took of from the ground. </p><p>After the lift off Ginny felt as if the flying wasn’t too bad, after a while the rhythm of the movements started to become almost calming. Maybe this wouldn’t be that hard after all. That was her last thought before Lawn mower spotted something and went into a straight nose dive. Ginny closed her eyes and hoped that her mother wouldn’t have to read in the news about her dying due to gravity. </p><p>Holding on so tightly her knuckles turned white Ginny squeezed her eyes shut to keep them from tearing up due to the strong wind rushing past them. Only after she felt them even out and heard a ‘Whoop!’ from Lilith did she open them again. She saw that they were now flying quite low, over a large lake, the surface glittering in the morning sun. Ginny felt herself smile and as the rush of adrenaline and fear for her life settled, she found it quite nice. The rest of the ride did not pass smoothly but eventually it did pass. They arrived after night had already fallen, shapes of the terrain hard to make out in the darkness. Ginny felt her legs wobble under her as her feet hit solid ground and her thighs ached from pressing tightly into the dragon. But she had made it and now she was here. Very far away from home and in a completely foreign landscape with a multitude of very dangerous creatures. She collapsed into the tent that had been arranged for her and immediately fell asleep, too tired to spend energy on worrisome thoughts.</p>
