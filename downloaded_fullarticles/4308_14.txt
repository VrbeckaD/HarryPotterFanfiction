    <p>Newt had just returned to New York with his new book: Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them. He really wanted to hand Tina her copy who had waited 4 tough months for his return. All these months she couldn’t get him out of her head even though she hadn’t known him for more than a few days.</p><p>Before his return, they had held in contact through lots and lots of letters. Tina had among other told Newt about Jacob and his memory which had slowly come back and Queenie who had kept visiting him at his new and prosperous bakery. Newt really wanted to find out how his memory had come back but had not yet received an answer. Oddly the rest of the No-Majs still didn’t seem to remember anything involving magic and wizardry.</p><p>In return, Newt had told her about some of his few travels and the finishing touches for his book. He had also found quite a lot of beasts he wanted so learn about so he’d decided to bring them with him in his case. But because he couldn’t let them stay alone in London he’d secured his locks of the case a smidge so they wouldn’t escape once again. Else he would have Madam Picquery sending another team of Aurors running around the city after him and his beasts.</p><p> </p><p>That day in the early spring Newt arrived at the docks. To make it a surprise Newt had not told anyone he would be coming. Though he wished he could tell them. Especially Tina. He was becoming very fond of her and was beginning to miss her very much before his unexpected appearance.</p><p>He turned sharply at the corner and looked up to see the familiar brownstone apartment. Then a thought hit him. How was he supposed to get up the stairs without Mrs. Esposito noticing? She was old, yes, but her hearing could be as good as it always had been. <em>Could I maybe apparate in there? No, that would be improper of me. Just walk silently up the stairs… You’ll be fine…</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Newt stood a little longer in front of the outside stairs. Then he took a deep breath, opened the door and slowly walked up the stairs inside the building. In the hallway, he could hear different sounds from each different apartment. He stopped and turned to see small silver letters on the door forming the name: Goldstein. Newt once again took a deep breath and raised his hand to knock on the door. He could hear some noises probably coming from the kitchen.</p><p>He glanced frantically around thinking of what to say or maybe even apparate. Before he could do so Queenie opened the door. She wore a fancy golden dress and looked a bit stressed but her eyes suddenly widened as she saw who had come by for a visit.</p><p>“Mr Scamander? What a surprise!” she exclaimed happily and stepped aside gesturing him to enter their apartment.</p><p>“I’m so happy to see you! And I’m sure Tina and Jacob will be too,” she continued once he’d entered.</p><p>Newt held out his right hand, she accepted it with a smile and shook it.</p><p>“You too,” he answered smiling sheepishly and let go of her hand.</p><p>“So Jacob… Is he alright?” Newt asked carefully</p><p>“I would really love to tell you all about it but I actually have a date with him in ten minutes so I really have to leave now before he gets concerned,” she stated and gave him a chaste smile before she turned to grab her jacket and walk out the door.</p><p>“Oh, Tina is in her bedroom if you want to go greet her,” Only Queenie’s head was visible in the doorway now. Newt felt his face blush bright red at her statement and fastly turned his gaze to the floor. She seemed to notice and looked down at him.</p><p>“So sorry Newt I didn’t mean it in that way. Last I checked on her she was only doing some paperwork at her desk,” she smiled apologetically. He felt very relieved and put his suitcase on the floor with still shaking hands.</p><p>“It’s… It’s alright. I’ll go say hello,” he said with a quiet voice and gave her a quick smile.</p><p>“Wonderful! I’ll arrange sometime you can meet Jacob but for now, I’ll have to leave. See you later Newt!” she closed the door and hurried down the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>Newt didn’t take any steps but instead spun around himself to have a look at the apartment. He remembered the first time he’d come here, forced by Tina to help Jakob with his injury. Or was it really forced? He remembered the awkward dinner where he and Tina had exchanged a few glances and listened to Jakob and Queenie’s flirty conversation. Actually, he envied their skills to show their fondness for each other. He didn’t know how to put his feelings for Tina into words. He had only been just brave enough to tuck some hair behind her ear at the docks.</p><p>In the time following his arrival at London after his farewell with Tina, he couldn’t stop thinking about her and being concerned about her loving him back. But why would she? Why would anyone like him at all? He might as well give up right away. But every second he was away from Tina, it was beginning to become too depressing and unbearable to handle… His thoughts were becoming more focused on Tina and soon he didn’t think about anything else. Different thoughts were flying around in his mind and some becoming too indecent in his own opinion. He was slowly beginning to long for relief from his thoughts. Sometimes the other kind of relief. In periods he’d done things with himself as a distraction but always felt terrible about himself afterwards. At these times he felt very indecent even though it was quite natural for human beings to do. At other times he had gone so mad at himself he had thrown away whatever he was holding to dump down on his bed and cover his face with his hands.</p><p>Newt awoke from his thoughts and found himself outside Tina’s bedroom. He must’ve walked there while he was caught in his deep thoughts. He thought about knocking on the door for a bit and lifted his shaking hand to do so. Before he could the doorknob turned and when the door opened he saw Tina standing only in her undergarment.<br/>
A light screech escaped her mouth and Newt’s face grew bright red at the sight and quickly moved his gaze elsewhere. She hastily wrapped herself in a towel and turned to look at him with a startled expression on her face.</p><p>“Newt, what are you doing here!?” she asked surprised with a shaking voice.<br/>
“I...Uhm...I...I just...Came to New York for a visit… Your sister said I could find you here… She said you were working…” he answered, too with a startled and cracking voice.</p><p>“I was working but I decided to relax for a bit and take a bath. Glad I didn’t completely undress,” she joked and laughed a bit nervously. Tina had now moved her gaze to the floor and Newt turned his to her. His eyes had gone rather wide and felt his stomach blossom with heat.</p><p>He too laughed a bit nervously, “No, that… That would’ve been…” He couldn’t seem to find the right word and looked away once again.</p><p>“Well… If you don’t find it too improper I’ll go take a quick bath then?” she asked and crossed her arms. Her left hand ran nervously across the other.</p><p>Newt had gone to connect his hands in a weird way in front of him. Tina noticed he was covering something and grew a little frantic.</p><p>“N-no… I don’t mind… I can just come back later if you don’t mind,” he stuttered and quickly stepped aside. Tina walked out of her room and felt very devoid.</p><p>“Maybe you can be back at dinner time then?” Tina asked tensely.</p><p>“Well… I don’t wanna cause you any trouble…” he answered quietly.</p><p>“Of course you won’t... We would be glad to let you dine with us. By the way, I think everyone would be happy to hear about your adventures and your new book,” she assured him and gave him a little smile.</p><p>“How can I say no then,” he said and returned a quick smile. He tried very hard not to stare as Tina made her way to the bathroom but suddenly she stopped and turned to face his direction.</p><p>“By the way… It’s great to see you again Newt,” she smiled and turned back around to enter the bathroom.</p><p>“It’s great to see you too Tina,” he muttered as she closed the door.</p>
