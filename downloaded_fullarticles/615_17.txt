    <p>Fleur Delacour was not sure that she really <em>needed</em> English lessons. Even if she did, she wasn’t sure that the best tutor would have been Harry Potter’s handsome Cursebreaker… brother? Foster brother? She wasn’t totally clear on what the relationship was there. At any rate, he didn’t know French, and as far as she knew, he’d never really taught anyone anything before.</p><p>At the same time, he was exceedingly handsome, and he’d made her laugh the first time they’d bumped into each other at Gringotts. So in that way, he was the perfect tutor.</p><p>Bill Weasley’s office door swung open as soon as she knocked. His red hair was pulled back behind his face, and the blue short sleeve shirt he was wearing accentuated both the muscles in his arms and his lively blue eyes. “Hey,” he said, stepping back to let her in. “I’m sorry again about canceling yesterday. I had -”</p><p>“ - some family stuff,” she said with him.</p><p>Her smile seemed to reassure him. “Yeah,” he said, grinning back. “I really am sorry. I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to find another tutor.”</p><p>His repeated cancellations for last minute “family stuff” did not, in fact, make her want to find a new tutor. Harry Potter had insisted that You-Know-Who was back, and she was inclined to believe him; she’d repeatedly felt like she was being sabotaged in the tournament, Cedric Diggory was dead, and besides, Harry had had no reason to lie.</p><p>And if You-Know-Who was back, she suspected that Bill’s last minute “family stuff” was probably more heroic than mundane, and if there was one thing that Fleur had always loved more than a handsome face, it was heroics.</p><p>“No,” she said, sitting down on one of his chairs. “I love my family. It is good that you love yours, too.”</p><p>Bill’s office was big - bigger than she’d have expected for someone who was still in his twenties. From what she’d gathered, he’d been one of their most successful Cursebreakers until he’d abruptly decided to take a desk job earlier that summer, and he commanded a corresponding amount of respect. It seemed like he was planning to stay awhile, too - he’d made vague comments about looking forward to his “first Christmas at home in awhile, at least,” and the office was already very identifiably his. The entire color scheme was clearly modeled after Gryffindor colors (which made her roll her eyes a little - the English could be so ridiculous about their Hogwarts houses), the bookshelf was filled with his books and trinkets, and there were a few framed pictures of his family and friends on his desk and on the sidetable next to the couch.</p><p>“If I’m going to be stuck at a desk job, I’m going to have somewhere comfortable to read the mountains of reports about shit I wish I could still be doing,” he’d said when she’d asked whether he actually used the couch. He had not expanded on why he was ‘stuck’ at a desk job, and she hadn’t asked; she assumed that, like many things, it had to do with his family.</p><p>He’d always sat on one of his desk chairs when they had ther lessons, but today, he flopped down onto his dark red couch along the far wall. “Hurt myself yesterday,” he said by way of explanation. “It’s not serious, it’s just been a long day and this is more comfortable.”</p><p>From the way he was arching his back and rolling his head from one side to the other, she didn’t think it was a ploy to get them to move to the couch - though she wouldn’t have complained if it was. “Should I come over there too, then?”</p><p>“If you like,” he said after a moment of hesitation. “Sure.”</p><p>She smoothed her green skirt down before sitting next to him. “How did you hurt yourself?”</p><p>He made a face. “My family’s clearing out some old furniture, and the relatives who bought it - centuries ago, mind - decided to hex it so it couldn’t be moved by magic. Every time you try, it gets heavier, and it took us a little while to realize what was going on. Petty bastards.”</p><p>She winced.</p><p>“You can ask me about them if you like, you know,” he said, arching his back again. “My family, I mean. I noticed that you don’t, even though you’ve said a couple things about Harry.”</p><p>“I do not want you to think that I am spying on you.”</p><p>His eyebrows went up a little. “Come again?”</p><p>She glanced toward the closed door and lowered her voice. It was soft enough that he had to lean in closer to hear her. “Harry Potter is your - your foster brother, yes?”</p><p>He considered that. “Sort of. Sure.”</p><p>“Then your family must be working against You-Know-Who.”  When he opened his mouth, she added, “No one told me this. But if you trust him and you are not a coward, then you must be, and I do not want you to think I am spying on you.”</p><p>Bill studied her for a moment. “So you never ask me about my family because you’re afraid I’ll think you’re just trying to use me for information about them?”</p><p>She nodded and braced herself. It was an awkward thing to have said, and she wasn’t sure how he’d react.</p><p>His smiled looked genuine. “Thanks,” he said. “I don’t think that, but I suppose if someone was trying to get my guard down, they’d send someone beautiful, wouldn’t they?” She felt her face start to get hot, but she was saved from having to come up with a response when he rubbed the back of his neck. “Fuck, I shouldn’t have sat at my desk all day.”</p><p>She considered him for a minute. “Do you want me to - what is the word?”</p><p>He shook his head. “I don’t know. Give me a little more to work with.”</p><p>“Ah - touching, to make it feel better when it hurts.”</p><p>His expression cleared. “Are you offering to massage my neck?”</p><p>“Yes! That is the word.”</p><p>He looked a little taken aback. “I - sure.” He turned away from her and pulled his hair over his shoulders. Her heart started to hammer as she edged a little closer, and butterflies exploded in her stomach when she touched his shoulders. “That feels good,” he sighed.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>He laughed. “So <em>are</em> you curious about my family? It’s fine if you’re not.”</p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure she believed that it would truly be fine if she wasn’t - she would not have particularly liked anyone who was actively disinterested in her family - but as it happened, she <em>was</em> very curious.</p><p>“Yes,” she admitted. “How many siblings do you have?”</p><p>“Six,” he said. “Five brothers, one sister. I’m the oldest. You probably saw a few of the younger ones at Hogwarts, at least in passing - they’re close to Harry - and my brother Percy filled in for his boss once or twice.”</p><p>“Mr. Crouch?” she asked. “Yes, I remember that. That was a very - very odd thing to happen. Viktor told me about Mr. Crouch attacking him in the forest.”</p><p>She felt Bill’s shoulders tense, just a little. “Viktor Krum? You - saw a lot of him, did you?”</p><p>Bill didn’t strike her as a particularly jealous person, but she supposed an international Quidditch star was probably enough to make anyone a little jealous at first. She considered clarifying immediately, and then thought the better of it; she was curious to see what Bill was like when he was jealous. “Of course,” she said instead. “He was another champion, you know, and we were both - both visitors at your Hogwarts. It was very odd, and difficult to find our way around at first. So we spoke often, especially of home. He missed it.”</p><p>To her surprise, Bill moved off Krum, though the tension in his shoulders said that he was probably still thinking about the other man. “Did you miss home?”</p><p>She considered that. “Sometimes,” she said slowly. “I think I like it here more than he did, but you English can be strange sometimes, and I miss my sister.”</p><p>“You’ve said that, yeah. Tell me about her.”</p><p>She focused on the feel of his broad, muscular shoulders beneath her hands for a moment while she gathered her thoughts. “My sister Gabrielle is - we are very close. She is younger than me, and when we were children, we liked to pretend we were - fairies is not quite the right word, but I do not know what is - in the woods behind our house. I used to sneak my wand outside after I started at Beauxbatons so I could make her - not fly. What is the word? When you are just in the sky, but you do not move?”</p><p>“Float? Hover?”</p><p>“Yes. I would make her float in the sky.” Fleur smiled at the memory. Those had been happier, more innocent times. Now, she was just glad that Gabrielle was still safely in France. “Now she wants to be a - a fairy - who rides on a dragon. Is that right?”</p><p>“Sure. You can say dragonrider, too. It doesn’t really work for most animals, but it does for dragons.”</p><p>“Dragonrider. Yes. She wants to be a fairy dragonrider. She was very jealous of me for the first task, and she was also angry that I did not try to ride the dragon.”</p><p>That made him laugh. “That sounds like something my sister might say.” He was silent for a minute. Then he said, “You know, my brother Charlie helped bring those dragons in for the first task - he works with them in Romania. If you wanted, I could talk to him about - I dunno, something where she could see them closer up. He works with French researchers sometimes. Not something dangerous,” he added quickly. “But - just closer.”</p><p>That took her aback. “I - that would be very nice, if it is not too much trouble. I think she would like that very much.”</p><p>“I’ll owl him, then.” He rolled his shoulders back and forth. “That feels a lot better, thanks. You can stop, if you want.”</p><p>“I do not mind.” She put a little more pressure on his right shoulder, and he let out a contented sigh. After a moment, she said, “I - Viktor and I - we are friends, but that is all.”</p><p>He didn’t respond, but she felt him relax a little, and she was glad she’d said it.</p><p>“Thanks for the massage,” Bill said on their way out.</p><p>She felt her face get a little hot. “Thanks for the English lesson.”</p><p>His fingers brushed across her bare arm, and she felt a spark pass between them. “You don’t need to thank me - you’re easy to talk to.”</p><p>She realized that she was smiling. “When are you free?” she asked.</p><p>“Well…” He drew out the word. “Next week - you probably don’t want to do it again this week -”</p><p>“This week is good,” she said quickly.</p><p>“Then I’m free tomorrow.” He shook his head when she agreed. “You’re going to get sick of me soon,” he warned as they parted ways. “I’m really not that interesting.”</p><p>Based on their encounters over the past five weeks, she doubted that she would get sick of him.</p><p>The next day, he found her in a nearby cafe during her lunch break. “I’m really sorry,” he panted. “But some family stuff came up, so I’ve got to leave at 5. It freed me up tomorrow, though, if you don’t have other plans.”</p><p>“I can do tomorrow,” she said cheerfully. If she’d known, she probably would have put a little less time into her hair and makeup that morning, though the way he was looking at her made her feel like he was still appreciating the effort.</p><p>“I’m really sorry,” he said again. “Believe me, I’d much rather -”</p><p>She rose up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek. “It is fine, Bill. Stop worrying.”</p><p>He flushed; by the time he managed to reply, his face was red as his hair. “Thanks. Tomorrow, then.”</p><p>It occured to her that whatever the circumstances, the constant scheduling and re-scheduling of plans probably would have annoyed her coming from most people. She wasn’t sure why it didn’t annoy her with him.</p><p>To her relief, nothing family-related came up the next day, and she ducked into the bathroom after finishing her day to reapply her makeup and change into a white sundress. When she arrived at Bill’s office shortly after 6 and knocked on his open door, his eyebrows shot up. “You look - nice,” he managed to get out. “Do you have plans tonight?”</p><p>“Yes.” His face fell a little, so she added, “I have an English lesson.”</p><p>He didn’t usually lose his capacity to speak, but he was clearly speechless now. After a long pause, he cleared his throat. “So you got dressed up for this?” She shrugged. “I’m - you look nice.”</p><p>“You said that already, but thank you.” She closed the door behind her and joined him on the couch. When she looked at him more closely, she noticed that he had dark circles under his eyes. “Are you - are you okay?”</p><p>He nodded. He was still staring at her. “Yeah. Just a little tired - I didn’t sleep well.”</p><p>“Mm.” She put her hand on his arm. He jumped a little, but didn’t pull it away. “Do you want another - another massage?”</p><p>Now his face did light up in a grin. “Nah,” he said. “Looking at you is much more relaxing than looking at a wall.” Lines like that had never worked on her, but she could feel the heat rising in her cheeks now. Before she could figure out how to respond, he said, “So how was your day?”</p><p>He had a habit of saying things like that and then changing the subject before she could respond. She wasn’t sure how she felt about it, though it definitely caught her off-guard.</p><p>The conversation came to a lull, and she was considering edging closer to him when he cleared his throat. “So - I think it is, but I just want to double check - it’s okay if I kiss you, right?”</p><p>As soon as she said yes, his mouth was on hers. She brushed her tongue against his and grabbed his shirt to pull him closer. They fell back against the arm of the couch, and he tore his mouth away from hers. “Hold on,” he said, reaching over to grab his wand off the table. “If someone walked in on this, I could get -” He waved it in the general direction of the door, and she heard the click of a lock followed by a faint humming noise. Her lips met his again, and his wand clattered back on the table as he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>“Bill,” she breathed as his soft lips touched her neck. “Yes, please, <em>yes.”</em></p><p>“Fuck, I should not be doing this in my office,” he said. His hand continued to creep up her leg, and he didn’t take his lips away from her neck.</p><p>“You started it,” she pointed out. “You kissed <em>me.”</em></p><p>“I was just trying to get up the nerve to ask you out, and then <em>you</em> showed up looking like you were going on a date with the luckiest person in the world. Didn’t you <em>want</em> me to kiss you?”</p><p>“Well, yes.” She nudged him. “Sit up.” When he did, she swung one leg over so she could straddle him. “Do you want to stop, then?” she whispered in his ear as she rocked against him.</p><p>He shuddered. “Absolutely not.” Before she could respond, he kissed her again. When she started to play with the buttons on his shirt, she felt his hand settle on her ass. As soon as the buttons were undone and her lips were on his chest, he said, “You know, I wouldn’t mind reciprocating.”</p><p>The tone of his voice and the way his hands felt on her body made a shiver run up her spine, and she slipped out of the straps of her dress. It fell to her waist, and he immediately reached around to undo the hooks on her bra. “I have been wanting this for <em>weeks,”</em> she said. When he pulled on her hips, she rose to her knees, and he immediately started to swirl his tongue around her nipple.</p><p>“So have I,” he said before taking it in his mouth.</p><p>She dug her fingernails into his shoulders and began to move her hips against the air. After a moment, she felt his fingers on the inside of her thigh. He made a questioning noise. <em>“Yes,”</em> she gasped. He pushed her underwear aside, and she cried out.</p><p>He looked up at her. “Of course you’re loud.” His tone was playful, and she didn’t even bother to hold back her giggle. “Fleur, I put a silencing spell on the door, but please try to keep it down - the room isn’t soundproof.” Then his mouth was on her other breast, and his fingers had started to hit a rhythm. She clapped a hand over her mouth to muffle her moan. “Fuck,” he said under his breath, moving his fingers in time with her hips. “Fleur -”</p><p>It vaguely occurred to her that her attempts to muffle her moans probably weren’t very effective, but she didn’t think she could have held them back even if she’d tried. The pressure was building inside of her, and it was almost impossible to think of anything else.</p><p>She shuddered as the ripples pulsed through her. He caught her as she collapsed and ran his dry hand through her hair while she whimpered against his chest.</p><p>His eyes drifted downward when she straightened up, and his breath caught in his throat as she began to kiss his neck. “What do <em>you</em> want?” she asked softly.</p><p>When she pulled back to look at him, his eyes were unfocused. “I want to be inside you,” he managed to get out. “But that’s <em>definitely</em> not something we should be doing here.”</p><p>She rocked against him, and he buried his face in her neck. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“That we shouldn’t be having sex in my office?” His tone was dry. “Yes. I’m very sure.” She rose up on her knees again, and despite his words, his mouth immediately went back to her breast.</p><p>“I will not tell, and I do not think anyone else is here. It is Friday.”</p><p>She saw him glance toward the door. “Oh, fuck it,” he said, reaching down to unbutton his trousers. “There’s a condom in the top drawer of my desk,” he told her. “Hand it to me?”</p><p>She reached over to grab it. “Your <em>top</em> drawer?” she teased as he tore the package open.</p><p>He grinned at her. “I told you I’ve been wanting to do this for weeks. I didn’t want to have to go looking for it, just in case.” She let her dress and underwear fall to the floor. “This is such a bad idea,” he said without any real conviction. His clothing joined hers. “We shouldn’t be doing this in my office.”</p><p>“You could always just put your clothing back on,” she pointed out, pushing her silvery blond hair behind her and laying back on the couch.</p><p>He tossed the wrapper aside and positioned his body over hers. “Bull <em>shit</em> I can.”</p><p>He groaned as he slid into her, and she immediately put her hand up to cover his mouth. “Your office isn’t soundproof.”</p><p>She could see the laughter in his eyes as he started to thrust. After a moment, his fingers drifted down to touch her again. She bit down on her lip.</p><p>“Bill,” she breathed. “Oh - oh, <em>yes.”</em> When he buried himself deep inside of her, she muffled her moans in his neck. She heard him grunt as she tightened around him, and she slid her hand around to the back of his head to pull him down for a kiss.</p><p>When they broke apart, she felt his voice tickle her ear. “Can I get behind you?”</p><p>Her stomach flipped over. <em>“Yes,”</em> she murmured.</p><p>She couldn’t hold back her whimper when he pulled out of her. “I know,” he hissed. “Hurry up. <em>Fuck,</em> Fleur, <em>please,</em> I need to be in you.” She rolled over and braced herself on the arm of the chair. She buried her face in the crook of her elbow just in time to muffle her shriek as he entered her again. She felt his grip on her hips tighten every time she moaned into her arm. <em>“Fuck,”</em> he said softly as she pushed herself back against him. “Next time, we need to do this where you can be as loud as you want. I love it.” He pushed himself deep into her, and she bit down on her arm to soften her scream.</p><p>“Now you’re just trying to make me - be loud,” she gasped, raising her head a little.</p><p>His reached around to touch her again, and she let out a loud moan before she could bury her face in her arm again. “Of course I am.”</p><p>It was a battle that she was not remotely embarrassed to admit that he easily won.</p><p>After another minute, he stopped and pulled out of her again. “I’m getting close,” he said when she twisted around in protest. “I want to look at your face while I come. How do you want me?”</p><p>“Lay down,” she said. He immediately flopped onto the couch, kicking one of the back cushions to the floor to make room for her legs. His eyes rolled back in his head as she sank onto him, and she covered his mouth with her hands just in time to smother his groan.</p><p>When she moved her hands to his shoulders, he was smiling again. He stared at her as they moved in time together, and after a moment, she felt his fingers back on her clit. She bit back a whimper, and he muttered <em>“Fuck”</em> under his breath again. Both his thrusts and his fingers were starting to speed up, and he put a hand over her mouth when he felt her starting to tighten around him. When the ripples had started to slow down, he moved his hand to her hips. He kept his eyes fixed on her face, and it only took a few more thrusts to finish him off.</p><p>They lay there for a moment. Then he sighed. “I really hate to say this, but can you get off of me so we can put our clothes back on?” She made a disgruntled noise. “Yeah, I know. But this is my office, not my bedroom.”</p><p>“Maybe next time, we should be in your bedroom, then.”</p><p>“Oh, next time we should <em>definitely</em> be in my bedroom.”</p><p>She’d definitely picked the right English tutor.</p>
