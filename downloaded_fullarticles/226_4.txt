<h3>1 SEPTEMBER, 1998</h3><p>Severus woke with a jolt, unsure of what had roused him from a sound sleep until a too-powerful hand smacked him across the face.</p><p>“Fuck, Harry!” Severus sat, pinching his bleeding nose until the stars cleared from his vision and he could breathe through the pain. Dear gods, that <em>hurt</em>. A quick wandless <em>Episkey </em>fixed the worst of the damage, and Severus caught Harry’s flailing arm before he could hit him again.</p><p>“Merlin,” he muttered in a pained voice. “We <em>must </em>do something about these visions of yours.”</p><p>He pulled Harry into his lap and hugged his arms against his chest. With Harry struggling like this, he thought it unwise to attempt entering his soul-bond’s mind. It would have to wait until Harry quieted, or perhaps they would get lucky and this would be one of the times Severus could reach him through their bond.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry! Wake up, love!”</em>
</p><p>Harry groaned and shuddered in Severus’ arms, his struggles coming to an abrupt halt. Thank <em>Merlin</em>. Severus sighed and held Harry tighter.</p><p>“Are you well, Harry?”</p><p>Harry whimpered and buried his face in Severus’ throat. “B-been better.”</p><p>Severus gave a wry laugh. “Yes. I know the feeling.”</p><p>Harry looked up and gasped. “Sev! You’re bleeding. D-did I…?”</p><p>“Just caught me across the face while you were struggling. It’s all right. Nothing a spell and a potion won’t fix.”</p><p>Harry winced. “Merlin, Severus. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“It is not your fault. You were unconscious.”</p><p>“Still, I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>Severus stroked Harry’s hair and tugged him against his chest. “I am more concerned about you at the moment. Was it bad, love?”</p><p>Harry shivered. “It… wasn’t fun, for certain. Riddle was trying to find out who’s been undermining him at the Ministry and the Prophet. He tortured people when they didn’t have an answer.”</p><p>Severus nodded. “Have we been compromised?”</p><p>“Not yet. King’s covering his tracks well.”</p><p>“Good to know.” Severus Summoned an anti-<em>Cruciatus</em> draught. “Drink.”</p><p>Harry downed the potion and shuddered. “Merlin, would it kill you to flavour them?”</p><p>“Yes, actually, it might.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Liar.” He laid a gentle hand against Severus’ face and healing green light flowed into his skin. “Better?”</p><p>Severus rubbed his nose and nodded. “Perfect. Did you witness anything else of use?”</p><p>“He mentioned wanting more Slytherins to mark this year, but no—mostly he just threw a tantrum. An extremely painful one.”</p><p>Severus shuddered. “I am sorry, beloved. I thought surely Occlumency would help. I do not understand why it is not keeping the visions out.”</p><p>“You said it yourself weeks ago—I’m a Seer, Sev. This just goes with the territory.”</p><p>Severus nodded grimly, keeping his fears about Harry’s scar to himself. Harry, however, knew him too well by now.</p><p>“Severus, if my scar <em>is </em>a horcrux, we’ll just work out how to destroy it without killing me. It’ll be okay.”</p><p>Severus sighed against Harry’s hair. “I cannot lose you.”</p><p>“You won’t. We’ll figure it out.” Harry yawned and stretched. “Merlin. I feel like I’ve been run over by a lorry. What time is it?”</p><p>“You are perfectly capable of a <em>Tempus </em>spell, Harry. Or, failing that, you might put on your glasses and look at the clock a metre above your head.”</p><p>Harry gave a sheepish chuckle. “It’s what comes of living like a Muggle for years.” He flicked his wrist and frowned at the clock that appeared before him. “Six in the morning. Ugh. I suppose I might as well get up then. Between getting our Slytherins on the Hogwarts Express in one piece and interrogating that painter, it’s going to be a busy day.”</p><p>Severus groaned. “And we must test the students’ Occlumency.”</p><p>Harry winced. “Merlin. That in and of itself will take all day.” He shook his head. “I’m going to floo Remus. We’ll need help. And we could use an update on his progress with the pack.”</p><p>“Best to do it soon, then. It is later in Germany than it is in Scotland. He will be up and about his business shortly.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry yawned once more and Summoned a dressing gown. “I’m going to check on the boys and floo Remus, and then we’d best get ready to go. It’s going to be a long day.”</p><p>“Merlin. I’m going back to sleep for a few moments then.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Okay, love. I’ll wake you when I’m done.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Severus beckoned Harry close and gave him a quick kiss, then snuggled back into his warm bed. A tingle of magic washed over his face and chest and the sheets as soon as he lay down, surprising him.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>“Er… sorry, Verus. You were all bloody.”</p><p>“Oh. I’d forgotten.” Severus shook his head and pulled the cover over his shoulders. “Wake me when you finish your routine.”</p><p>“All right.” Harry kissed Severus’ forehead and smoothed the cover over him. His bare feet padded away, and soon Severus fell back into dreams.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry went to Seth’s room first, peeking inside to check on the boys. Seth was curled up in his frame, fast asleep. Zephie, the boys’ personal house elf, snored in her tiny camp bed too, but Keiran looked up when Harry came in, his eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>Harry picked up the photo and held it near his heart, closing the door behind him before he dared whisper, “Did you have a nightmare, little one?”</p><p>Keiran winced and nodded.</p><p>“The same one, huh?”</p><p>Keiran sighed and hugged his chest. <em>“Always the same</em>,” he said through a combination of modified sign language and mouthed words.</p><p>Harry brushed his fingertip down the photo-boy’s hair to comfort him—it felt as soft as it would on a human, thanks to Harry’s spell to give Keiran and Seth the sense of touch and the ability to touch back. If only he could work out how to give Keiran speech, he would be content. At least until Dean finished his painting.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dean still had two weeks’ worth of work to go, and until they could bring Seamus and Neville into the Dawn, he couldn’t work on it at school. Hogsmeade weekends were the only opportunity he had.</p><p>Harry made a note to talk to Seamus and Neville at the station. He had to be there for Draco and the other Slytherins anyway.</p><p>“You can hang out with me for a bit, love,” Harry murmured to the photo. “I have to floo Remus and work on my routine. Would you like to stay for that? Or I can charm a book for you until Seth wakes up.”</p><p>Keiran smiled, though it was weary and sad. <em>“I’ll stay with you.”</em></p><p>Harry rubbed Keiran’s hair. “I’m sorry, Keiran. I don’t know why you keep having that awful dream. You never had them before, did you?”</p><p>Keiran shrugged and signed, <em>“Sometimes. Not like this.”</em></p><p>“Have you and Seth been talking about it a lot?”</p><p>Keiran paled. <em>“I can’t.”</em></p><p>“As I thought.” Harry frowned as he entered the living room. “I’ll ask Lu about it if we have time, love. She’s pretty knowledgeable about dreams. Maybe she’ll know what’s going on.”</p><p>Keiran nodded and leaned against Harry’s hand. <em>“I feel better now.”</em></p><p>“Hmm. I’ll always try to help, Keiran. Now, are you okay to sit tight with me while I talk to Remus?”</p><p>Keiran nodded and closed his eyes. <em>“Maybe I can sleep if I hear your voice.”</em></p><p>Harry swallowed a pang of grief for the boy. Merlin, he’d been alone so long, and that after watching his entire family die, all but Severus. His need for human contact and comfort ran even deeper than Seth’s, who had lived as loveless and painful a life as Keiran.</p><p>Still, at least they were making progress with the boys. Severus and Harry had learned some sign language from Seth, and both boys had begun to open up to their family more. Seth and Keiran, especially, had a strong relationship. Any time Harry and Severus left them alone, Seth would float his painting to sit with Keiran and jabber away in their personal language. Harry and Severus enjoyed watching them talk immensely, even if they couldn’t always follow the conversation. It was good to see them healing each other.</p><p>Harry knelt before the hearth and, cradling Keiran against his heart with one hand, tossed a pinch of floo powder into the flames with the other. “Lumos Lodge, Number 34, Berlin.” The flames turned green and Harry stuck his head inside, taking care to shield Keiran from the fire. “Remus! Are you there?”</p><p>The werewolf came around the corner dressed in his pyjamas and carrying a cup of tea. “Harry? What are you doing up so early, cub?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “Another vision. This time I accidentally punched Severus in the nose before he could wake me up.”</p><p>Remus snorted tea down his front. “I shouldn’t laugh. I really shouldn’t, but….”</p><p>Harry glowered. “It’s not funny. I really hurt him.”</p><p>Remus chuckled. “Okay, okay. He’s all right now, isn’t he?”</p><p>“Of course. I healed him and cleared up the mess, but Merlin. I feel like a sod.”</p><p>“Is that why you called me at….” Remus looked at his watch. “Seven in the morning?”</p><p>“Not quite. I wanted to check in about how things are going with the Berlin pack. That, and we’ll need help testing everyone’s Occlumency today if you can make it.”</p><p>Remus nodded. “I can help for a time. I’ve a meeting with Herr Fuchs in the afternoon, though.”</p><p>“We have to be at the train station by then anyway. So things are going well, then?”</p><p>Remus laid his tea aside and rubbed his forehead. “Not as well as I’d hoped. I think they want to see proof of my leadership, Harry. They’re listening, but without some kind of evidence that I’m speaking the truth….”</p><p>Harry sighed. “Right. Well, I’ll ask Gemma to move our uniforms to the front of her workload. Once she’s finished and we look like a cohesive unit rather than a ragtag bunch of misfits, Severus and I will meet Herr Fuchs along with you, and we’ll bring some of the Dawn along too.”</p><p>Remus grinned. “That would surely help my position. Even just my uniform might help. My clothes, well… I don’t much <em>look </em>like a leader.”</p><p>“Merlin, Remus. I give you a salary, don’t I? <em>Use</em> it. Even I’ve put my castoffs aside and started dressing for my size.” Harry flushed and muttered, “Even if it means I don’t always find things in the adult section.”</p><p>Remus gave Harry a wry smile. “I… yes, I suppose I should follow your example then.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “You’re not used to having money, are you?”</p><p>Remus rubbed the back of his neck. “That, and the fact that my cub is paying me—well, it’s all a bit awkward.” At Harry’s glare, he held his hands up in a gesture of surrender. “But I’ll use it! I’ll get some decent clothing after the meeting today if I have time.”</p><p>“Good boy.”</p><p>Remus narrowed his eyes. “Not funny.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Merlin, I didn’t mean it like that. I only meant that it’s about time you started listening to me.”</p><p>“Well, it’s the first time in a long time you’ve said something that makes sense.”</p><p>“Oi!” Harry winced at the volume of his outburst and checked Keiran. The boy had fallen fast asleep against Harry’s chest. “Gods, poor little man.”</p><p>Remus’ expression softened. “Is Keiran all right?”</p><p>“He hasn’t been sleeping well. Keeps having nightmares about… about <em>that</em>. When his family….”</p><p>Remus cringed. “Gods. Yes, that would make it difficult for anyone to sleep.”</p><p>Harry shook his head sadly. “I’m not sure if I should try to get him to talk about it or if that might make it worse. He doesn’t want to, but then, I didn’t want to talk about my life before either, and after I did… I felt better.”</p><p>“I would encourage him to talk, but don’t push too hard. If he can’t face it yet, don’t force him to.”</p><p>Harry nodded and watched the boy sleep for a moment. “He’s so beautiful, Remus. I don’t understand why Dad and Sirius had such issues with him.”</p><p>Remus chuckled. “Well, you’re hardly unbiased at this point, cub, but to tell you the truth, I think it all came down to Lily. James wanted Lily to himself and was jealous of her relationship with Severus. And Sirius—well, Severus was a convenient scapegoat for him. I don’t think it had much to do with Severus as a person at all.”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes around a surge of anger and pain. “That… doesn’t help much.”</p><p>“Sorry, cub. I don’t have all the answers.”</p><p>“I know. I just… I wish they’d been better people.”</p><p>“Well, for you, they were.”</p><p>“But not for my soul-bond.”</p><p>Remus gave him a sad smile. “Lily would have accepted him.”</p><p>“Would she? She abandoned him to it, Remus. And then she let him suffer alone for years when all he wanted was her forgiveness. She’s no better than they are.”</p><p>“Severus wasn’t entirely innocent either, Harry. Lily distanced herself because he was getting too close to the dark.”</p><p>“Which he might never have fallen into if Mum had been a little more understanding.”</p><p>Remus shook his head. “You don’t know that, Harry. And either way, you’re not taking into account that you’re talking about teenagers. The world was black and white to us back then. We didn’t understand shades of grey yet. Nor the power of love and forgiveness, sadly.”</p><p>Harry winced at Remus’ unintentional reiteration of Severus’ beliefs—concerning Lily, at least. “I suppose you have a point.” He shook his head. “No, you don’t either. Before all this started, I hated Malfoy just as much as Da and Sirius hated Severus, if not more. And I <em>never </em>would have left him in that situation.”</p><p>“And you didn’t cast <em>Sectumsempra </em>on him in the loo?”</p><p>“Damn it, Remus—that’s underhanded and you know it. I didn’t know what that spell did—and yes, I’ve already gotten the lecture, so you can leave that out. Had I known it would cut him to ribbons, I’d have never <em>touched </em>it.”</p><p>“My point was, Harry,” Remus said, his voice sad, “was that Severus <em>did </em>have a dark side.”</p><p>“So did Malfoy, and I wouldn’t have left him to that. Hell, I wouldn’t have left <em>Lucius </em>Malfoy to be sexually assaulted, and that piece of shite <em>deserves</em> it.”</p><p>Remus leaned back on his heels and sighed. “Harry, I’m not saying we were justified. I’m only trying to say we were human. Kids. We made a terrible mistake, and I, for one, am sorry for it. As for the rest of them, well, there’s no point in torturing yourself over it, Harry. I believe your father and godfather were mostly good people with a few… blind spots, but whether you believe that or not, their identity doesn’t shape yours.”</p><p>Harry’s chest ached, some tight knot of shame loosening. Remus was right, in the latter point at least. Whatever one could say about Harry’s family, the truth was that he had hardly known them. Many children with better relationships with their family went against the grain. Like them, he was his own person.</p><p>“Let your guilt go, Harry,” Remus said, his voice soft. “What we did or did not do, how we chose to live our lives, the mistakes we made—none of it has anything to do with you.”</p><p>Harry sighed. Guilt. Merlin, Severus had been working with him to heal their guilt complexes all summer, but at times like this, Harry wondered if they had even made a dent.</p><p>He shook himself out of his musing with a frown. “Merlin, I didn’t mean to get into this. All I wanted… I want Keiran and Severus to heal and I’m not sure how to help them.”</p><p>“You’re doing a fine job with both if you ask me.” Remus reached through the fire and patted Harry’s shoulder. “Just love them, cub. That’s what they need more than anything.”</p><p>Harry looked at Keiran, fast asleep in his hand, and nodded. “I’ll do my best.”</p><p>“That’s all anyone can ask. Now, should I go ahead and come through?”</p><p>Harry chuckled. “Severus might string you up. It’s barely six in the morning here and I’ve yet to do my routine or eat breakfast. Can you pop by at… about eight-thirty your time?”</p><p>“Sounds good. I’m assuming we’ll be meeting at the safehouse, then?”</p><p>“Yeah. You have your key?”</p><p>Remus nodded. “And the password.”</p><p>“Good. I’ll see you in a bit then.”</p><p>Remus waved, and Harry pulled out of the fire, ending the call. With a little shake, he stood and made his way to the training area outside of the house. A flick of his hand shifted his dressing gown into training gear and set up a light warming charm around him. A tap against his chest added a warded pocket to his shirt so Keiran could sleep. The owls came over to sit on Freya’s former paddock and watched as Harry performed some stretches.</p><p>As he woke up his sleepy muscles, he gave the empty paddock a sad smile and hoped Freya was well. Severus and Harry still missed their thestral friend from time to time, but she was happier with her herd in the Forbidden Forest. Luna had mentioned she thought the mare was with foal or would be soon. Maybe one day he and Severus could see her baby when it was safe to go to Hogwarts again.</p><p>Hedwig hooted happily as Harry finished his warm-up.</p><p>“Right you are, girl. Let’s have some fun.”</p><p>The owl dove at Harry, and he dodged her with a laugh. “Come on, lazybones! You can do better than that!”</p><p>Hedwig ruffled up her feathers and zoomed in at full speed. Soon, the other two owls joined in, and Harry’s laughter rang through the freshly-cleared lawns of Bàn Leon.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Severus met Minerva at the station, the latter having identified him by the golden sun pendant lying against his chest. Thanks to Harry's impenetrable glamours, Severus looked nothing like himself, but his pendant announced him as a member of the Court of the Dawn on sight. Most of their members had one by then, and it served as more than decoration and for identification purposes. Besides protecting their wearer from all but the most deadly of curses—including core leeches—it housed an emergency portkey, one that would respond to the wearer’s name or activate automatically if they fell unconscious from injuries. Severus anticipated the pendants would save many lives over the coming weeks as the Slytherins made it clear they had no intentions of playing by Albus’ rules and the war raged all around them.</p><p>Minerva gave Severus a little nod as she stepped into place beside him. “Everything all right at home?”</p><p>Severus nodded back. “As well as can be expected. All of our double agents are well able to protect themselves, though your red-haired lion may need a bit more guidance.”</p><p>“Hmm. I’ll see to it that he completes his training.”</p><p>Severus frowned at the shocked look on Harry’s face. He had brought Longbottom and Finnigan over to discuss meeting him about the Dawn at a later time, but as he watched, Harry shook his head to himself and changed the subject. Merlin, what had startled him so?</p><p>Severus shook off his fears and focused on his discussion with Minerva. There was no use worrying about it now. Harry would tell him how it went later, and they had bigger problems at the moment.</p><p>“Was there any word on the light lord’s plans at the meeting last night?”</p><p>Minerva shook her head. “He only said he hopes to make Hogwarts a safer place for all this year.”</p><p>Severus tugged at his beard—a strange novelty to be sure. “Well, that is as infuriatingly vague as usual, though I imagine it means no good for those wearing green.”</p><p>Minerva scowled. “Most likely. Where is your young paramour?”</p><p>Severus inclined his head towards the platform. “It appears he is making friends with the Slytherins.”</p><p>They watched in silence as Harry patted Draco on the back and gave him a brief hug, repeating his actions with Theo, Blaise, and Millicent, whom they had rescued recently. The girl had been instrumental in getting the winery and potions garden cleaned up. Thanks to Millicent, Blaise, and Draco's hard work, assuming the Dawn Slytherins stayed at Hogwarts that long, the fields behind the safehouse would be ready for planting by the Easter hols. Hopefully, Severus could find people to help with the planting and maintenance until the Dawn group graduated. Perhaps the weres would assist once they arrived.</p><p>“Hmm,” Minerva said, her lips pursed. “Albus won’t be best pleased about that.”</p><p>Severus watched as Draco purposefully rolled up his sleeves and tucked his hands behind his head, smirking as he revealed his Mark-free arms. The Slytherins on both sides of the fence boggled, but the way the dark-sided Slytherins banded together with their fellows from the other houses and slipped away towards the end of the platform set Severus’ teeth on edge.</p><p>“Minerva.”</p><p>She gave a curt nod and drew her wand. “I saw it too.” She tapped her pendant with her wand and murmured, “Be on guard. The dark-aligned students appear to be planning something.”</p><p>Severus watched Harry tense and grimace. The young man rubbed a hand across his scar, and Severus’ stomach lurched.</p><p>“He’s here,” Severus hissed. “It’s an attack!”</p><p>“Sweet merciful Merlin,” Minerva breathed. “How?”</p><p>“No time! Advise the Dawn to take position and get the students on the train—<em>now</em>!” Severus tapped his pendant with his wand. “Kingsley, get the rest of the Order and Dawn to the Hogwarts Express. We’re under attack!”</p><p>Minerva scurried off, skirts held in one hand and her wand in the other. “All students, board the train immediately! We have confirmed rumours of—”</p><p>“Riddle!” Harry shouted, cutting her off. “The bastard is here and he’s brought friends! Everyone, get on the train this <em>instant</em>!”</p><p>The students shrieked and rushed for the cabins, and the few professors in attendance struggled to get them in some semblance of order.</p><p>Severus dashed to his soul-bond’s side and took up a position at his back. “What did you see?”</p><p>“Riddle and thirty approaching from the western end of the platform.” Harry snarled. “Rabastan Lestrange is leading them.”</p><p>Remus settled into position on Harry’s left. “Lestrange? Not Riddle?”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Riddle is a bloody coward. He won’t come in until the battle is almost over, if he shows his ugly mug at all.”</p><p>Draco took up position with his fellow Dawn Slytherins on the right. “Harry’s right. The bastard always sends in the cannon fodder first. <em>Then </em>the fight gets ugly.” He shuddered.</p><p>Severus gave him what he hoped was an encouraging look. The boy would rather be healing the survivors than standing with them in the thick of battle, but they had little choice in this situation. Caught between sides as he was, Draco would have been a sitting duck on his own.</p><p>Ron led the other Dawn students into place beside Remus. “So that means, whether Lestrange knows it or not, he’s been downgraded to cannon fodder.”</p><p>“He must have been gravely injured at Nott Manor,” said Severus with a shudder. “Too much so for him to recover completely.”</p><p>Harry winced. “I….”</p><p>Theo shook his head. “It was them or us, Harry. You did the right thing.”</p><p>Harry sighed. “Damn guilt complex.”</p><p>“We will defeat it eventually,” said Severus. “Do you see anything yet?”</p><p>“I get the feeling they had planned on apparating in on top of the students. We’ve stolen the element of surprise, so now I have no idea what they’ll do.”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Well, either way, they’ll find a bit more than they bargained for, yeah?”</p><p>“Don’t get overconfident,” Harry said, his voice sombre. “Remember what it almost cost me at the Ministry.”</p><p>“Right,” said Draco. “These idiots might not be his best, but they’re not easy either.”</p><p>“Harry,” said Severus, “do you <em>see </em>anything yet? If they are invisible….”</p><p>Harry gulped. “Shite.” He closed his eyes briefly, and they flashed silver when he opened them again. “Oh hell! Verus, duck!”</p><p>Severus dropped and kicked out. An invisible body fell at his feet, a wicked-looking dagger losing its glamour as it clattered away. Severus’ heart stilled. Merlin help him, that had been too close. A silent <em>Stupefy </em>and <em>Incarcerous </em>ensured the bastard wouldn’t move, for a while anyway.</p><p>Remus cried, “Shields up!”</p><p>Silvery-pink light shimmered around every Dawn member, then gained a golden tone as their pendants added their protections.</p><p>Ron shouted a warning to the non-Dawn fighters on the platform. “Take cover and shield yourselves or get out of it! They’re invisible!”</p><p>Shields went up all over the place, and several students made a rush for the train.</p><p>Harry said, voice low, “Verus, Remus, cover me!”</p><p>“Only use necessary force, Harry,” Severus whispered. “Remember our plan.”</p><p>Harry nodded and started a complicated chant—Severus translated enough to recognise it as a spell to destroy the Death Eaters’ invisibility. With a nod to his soul-bond, he took position with Remus on either side of Harry, guarding him with their lives. Draco and Blaise guarded him from the front and back as well, and the rest of the Dawn formed ranks around them. Severus sensed and heard people moving about the periphery unseen, but no one dared come too close now that the spy was on guard.</p><p>At least no one Severus heard.</p><p>An eerie hush settled on the platform. Even the students on the train had fallen silent. Dread grew heavy and oppressive in the air, thick and choking as both sides waited to see who would make the first move.</p><p>Magic soon began to roll off Harry in waves as he built up a powerful spell between his palms, but with any luck, the Death Eaters would think they had combined forces to create such magic. Their minds would surely not jump straight to magehood when the world considered it a fanciful legend. Severus hoped so anyway.</p><p>“Hurry, pet,” he whispered.</p><p>Harry nodded and chanted on.</p><p>“Severus,” Remus muttered, “your shadow skill. We could disable them before they even know what’s happening.”</p><p>Severus winced. “Merlin. I am unsure I can do it again, but I will try.” Focusing his magic on intent as he had at the Ministry a few weeks before, he poured power into his core.</p><p>It was too much. The Death Eaters had finally caught on that the ‘Light’ side wasn’t simply <em>waiting </em>to be attacked this time as Dumbledore encouraged them to do. No, Harry and Severus trained their fighters to be proactive.</p><p>Someone near them muttered a curse and acid green light headed straight for Ron. Fuck! Terror cold in his veins, Severus shot a wandless tripping spell at Ron, knocking the boy out of the way of the spell. The killing curse crashed harmlessly into the platform walls, leaving a smoking crater in its wake.</p><p>“Ron!” Hermione darted to her boyfriend’s side, wild hair flying.</p><p>Ashen-faced, Ron scrambled to his feet and backed into Remus’ side. “Bloody hell!”</p><p>As another curse shot towards Harry and bounced off his shields, the Weasleys came running, Ginny at the head, her face screwed up in terror.</p><p>“Ron! Ron, are you okay!”</p><p>Ron grimaced. “Fine, but you won’t be if Mum finds yo—”</p><p>Severus tried once more to shift, but another curse sailed at Theo, and he was just in time to block it. “Merlin, I can’t manage to sh—”</p><p>Molly’s screech cut Severus off, “I told you to <em>get on that train</em>, Ginevra We—” A curse shot at her head cut her rant short too. Molly dodged and parried, but if her return spell hit, no one knew. “Ginevra, get on the—”</p><p>“Too late,” Remus said. “They could be between us and the train for all we know.”</p><p>“They probably are,” Ron muttered. “It’s what I would do. Cut off our escape.”</p><p>“Shite. What do we—” Blaise ducked another curse and shot blindly into the air ahead. “H-how are we to fight an enemy we can’t see?”</p><p>“We are working on that,” Severus replied.</p><p>Remus added, “Just dodge!”</p><p>Almost before he had finished speaking, blue-violet light rushed out from the centre of the group and revealed the skulking Death Eaters, some dangerously close to their allies. To Severus’ dismay, the spell also removed his glamours—including the ones covering his age and healed scars.</p><p>He cursed under his breath and yanked up his hood, hoping no one had seen. There was no time to worry about it now either way. Their plans ruined, the Death Eaters had abandoned all hope of stealth and launched into a free-for-all. Severus had to focus on survival and protecting his allies. If his secret got out, he would worry about it then.</p><p>Curses and spellfire flew like mad. The metallic scent of ozone and blood filled Severus’ nostrils. Someone screamed on his left—there was no time to see who—and another dropped on his right. He glanced to make sure it wasn’t Harry, then turned back to find a disfigured face leering into his own.</p><p>“Hello, Snape.”</p><p>
  <em>‘Fuck!’ </em>
</p><p>Rabastan Lestrange had seen him, and by the mad look in his eyes, the bastard knew where he had seen him last, too. Burn scars had rendered the man’s face almost unrecognizable. If not for the voice, a thatch of dirty blond hair, and the one remaining ice-blue eye, Severus never would have guessed the identity of the damaged wretch before him.</p><p>Lestrange parried a cutting curse and gave a rasping laugh. “I look a sight, don’t I? Well, at least I am not the only one, hmm?”</p><p>So he hadn’t seen Severus’ lack of scars at least. Thank Merlin for small mercies.</p><p>“<em>Incendio</em>!”</p><p>Draco’s fire curse bounced off Lestrange’s shield and sizzled out on the stone floor.</p><p>“Back off, you traitorous little shite, if you know what’s go—”</p><p>Severus’ wandless, nonverbal Conjunctivitis curse brought the man’s babbling to an abrupt halt. Lestrange dodged and cackled, apparently gone as mad as his sister-in-law. His sinister grin pulled the burned skin on the left side of his face, rendering him a hideous sight.</p><p>“Going for the eye, Severus? I should have known not to let my gu—”</p><p>“<em>Crucio</em>!”</p><p>The bastard grimaced and twitched under the pain curse.</p><p>Bellatrix’s mad cackle preceded a sharp cry of, “<em>Expulso</em>!”</p><p>Sick, creeping phantom pain clawed at Severus’ face, but he had no time to acknowledge his flashbacks. White-blue light was shooting straight for his head.</p><p>“<em>Down</em>!”</p><p>Everything happened in an instant. Severus dragged Harry down with him, covering his lover with his larger form. Bodies dropped to the platform floor beside them, hands already over their heads and crowding close to Severus and Harry. Only one Dawn member hadn’t heeded the warning: Draco. The boy had frozen in terror, face ashen and eyes fixed on the curse tearing straight for him. Rabastan, too, stood laughing maniacally above them, as if he believed himself immune to being blasted into tiny pieces.</p><p>“DOWN!” Severus shouted again and grabbed for Draco, but too late. The curse hit before he could finish his second cry—only to rebound from an invisible shield and crash into the ceiling above Bellatrix’s head.</p><p>The bitch shrieked and leapt out of the way. Rabastan went flying, but not before the wind from the rebound knocked the hood off Severus’ face. He jerked it back up, praying he had been fast enough.</p><p>Harry scrambled to his feet, dragging Severus and Ron with him. “What the hell is <em>she </em>doing here? You said <em>cannon fodder</em>, Draco!”</p><p>Draco was still frozen.</p><p>“The mad bitch won’t miss a fight,” Theo said, his expression grim.</p><p>Severus scowled. No indeed. The smell of blood drew her like a wild animal.</p><p>He shouted, “Draco! Snap out of it or get out!”</p><p>Draco shuddered and shook himself. “Fuck, but I hate that bitch!”</p><p>“The feeling is mu—” A Death Eater Severus hadn’t met jumped into place before him and attempted to club him. Severus’ katana made short work of him and, with a shudder of revulsion and guilt, he kicked both halves of his corpse aside. “—Mutual. Now wake up!”</p><p>“O-oka—”</p><p>Purple flame shot from somewhere and barely missed Draco’s head. Dolohov. So the fucker wasn’t dead yet.</p><p>“Shite!” Draco dropped and leaned against Blaise. “C-can’t.”</p><p>Blaise grimaced and stepped in front of Draco just in time to repel a cutting curse aimed for the panicking boy. “Draco, get <em>up</em>!”</p><p>The boy whimpered, but staggered to his feet and pulled himself together. “<em>Reducto</em>!” His hex blasted apart a sign in front of one of the Death Eaters who had attacked him. A young one. Too young to die from the bit of shrapnel that sliced open his throat, but there was nothing to be done. Draco cringed but kept fighting.</p><p>“Poor widdle baby Potter,” Bellatrix taunted from the shadows. Severus jerked his head around, searching for her, but he couldn’t locate the bitch among the smoke and rubble.</p><p>“Can’t fight alone,” Bellatrix jeered in her sing-song tones, “the poor widdle hero has to drag his widdle friends into his messes. How many will die for you today?”</p><p>Severus’ heart lurched. Oh gods. If Harry didn’t have a grip on his guilt, her words would cripple him. “Harry! It’s not true. <em>Baubilius</em>!” A jet of yellow lightning shot from Severus’ wand and either stunned or killed the man he had been fighting. He did not know which and did not want to know. With a grimace, he kicked the body away and blasted another opponent back.</p><p>“I k-know.” Though shaken, Harry settled against Severus’ back, his shoulders firm and his stance strong. “<em>Maurigladius</em>!”</p><p>Harry’s curse conjured a wall of swords and shot them forwards. Bellatrix spun out of the way and vanished. The swords slammed into a hapless Death Eater standing behind her, and he crumpled to the floor with a gasp and a whimper. Harry cringed and turned away, but did not stop fighting.</p><p>“Be strong,” Severus called. “Fight!”</p><p>With a flash of black and a mad cackle, Bellatrix reappeared in front of Ron, a blade digging into his throat. Ron cried out as her dagger drew red droplets against his neck.</p><p>“Oh, Potty’s little Weasel is in tro—”</p><p>“Not my <em>son</em>, you mad bitch!”</p><p>Molly charged her, and the dagger transformed into a scorpion and crawled up Bellatrix’s arm. Severus altered it again into a hacked-off adder, and the woman had no choice but to back away. Molly engaged her, leaving the others free to thin the herd.</p><p>Harry hissed to the snake even as he battled on. Severus fought too, blasting Death Eaters left and right until the smell of smoke and blood came so thick it choked him. In between spells, he fought with physical blows, taking out as many as he could non-lethally. He stepped forward, leaning into an elbow strike to Crabbe Senior’s eye socket, and slipped in someone’s blood. Stomach lurching and back twinging, he finished the stroke with a grunt. Fucker deserved it. Severus hadn’t forgotten what the bastard had done to him in Voldemort’s torture chambers.</p><p>With a shudder, he Vanished the gore nearby lest a fall prove their undoing.</p><p>“Thanks for that,” Remus muttered. “<em>Bombarda</em>!” A trio of Death Eaters encroaching on the werewolf flew backwards and crashed into the train with a deafening clang. The students inside screamed and jerked back from the windows, their faces white.</p><p>Harry cried, “How many are there? Gods, they keep coming!”</p><p>“I do not know.” Severus ducked under a fire curse but failed to dodge a cutting curse in time. He cried out as it struck his arm, sending a shock of pain from his elbow to his shoulder. Fuck! Their shields were beginning to fail. A quick examination of his bicep reassured him the curse hadn’t cut too deep, but they were running out of time.</p><p>“Verus! Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yes, yes. Don’t stop!”</p><p>Harry snarled and threw two more Death Eaters back into the platform wall with a blast of raw magic. A hideous crack sounded, and the elder of the two landed in a crumpled heap, his neck at an unnatural angle. Harry made a sound of anguish but did not stop moving.</p><p>Gods, they weren’t ready for this. The students had never been in a fight this lethal. They had trained for it all summer, and Harry and Severus had made it clear that in a fight to the death, they weren’t to pull their punches, but no amount of training could prepare someone for the rawness, the gore of real battle. No one could prepare for the horror of ending a life with one’s own hands, even the life of a criminal and a murderer.</p><p>None of them would leave this battle unchanged, and Severus knew all too well how much the grief, the aftermath of war would hurt. Merlin, how he wished he could hold his Harry and ease his pain.</p><p>“Harry, I—”</p><p>Pops sounded all around. Severus’ heart leapt into his throat. Dear gods, had Riddle sent in <em>another</em> wave already? This one had proven almost too difficult to manage, as long as they planned to keep Harry’s powers a secret as much as possible.</p><p>A deep voice boomed, “Sorry we’re late! Got held up at the office.”</p><p>Kingsley. Severus’ knees wobbled with relief. Thank the gods, the cavalry had arrived.</p><p>In an instant, auror red mixed with the sea of black robes and dark blood, but the fight was already over. A wave of dark magic rushed over the platform, sending a ghostly twinge along Severus’ arm. The mark. His body remembered the magic even if he didn’t bear its stain any longer.</p><p>Voldemort was calling the remainder of his troops home.</p><p>Bellatrix called, “Ta-ta,” as if she had been attending a bloody tea party and vanished with a pop. The remaining Death Eaters disappeared immediately after, some grabbing hold of fallen comrades who weren’t quite dead yet. In an instant, the Dawn, the non-Dawn members of the DA, and the Order were the only living people on Platform 9 ¾. Well, and the children inside the train, of course. Thank Merlin they had managed to save them.</p><p>Kingsley let out a huff. “Well, damn. No fun for us, I suppose.”</p><p>Draco’s voice held an edge of hysteria. “You call this <em>fun</em>?”</p><p>“Better than writing reports,” Tonks said with a shrug and arrested the unconscious bloke still lying at Severus’ feet.</p><p>“You are fortunate I stunned you early on, bastard,” Severus muttered.</p><p>“<em>Severus</em>!”</p><p>Molly’s voice, tremulous and shrill, brought Severus’ head whipping around. The woman knelt beside a slight figure with red hair. <em>Ginny</em>! Molly wept and pleaded with her daughter to hold on even as she leaned onto the girl’s chest with all her weight. Crimson flowed under her hands, spreading in an ever-growing pool around the girl, and Severus’ stomach gave a painful jolt.</p><p><em>Sectumsempra</em>. Merlin, how he wished he had never invented that godsawful curse.</p><p>“Ginny!” Harry’s shriek cut Severus to the quick.</p><p>
  <em>‘Gods above, please let it not be too late!’</em>
</p><p>Harry bolted to Molly’s side, torn cloak flapping behind him. Severus dashed after him, struggling not to slip in puddles of pooling blood and other bits he did not want to identify. Ron raced at his side.</p><p>“Ginny! Oh gods, no!”</p><p>Eyes wide and crimson marring the freckled white of his throat, Ron somehow managed to make it to his family’s side before Harry. Harry skidded to a halt beside him two seconds later, the counterchant already on his lips. Severus slid into place beside him and called on his magic.</p><p>
  <em>“Please, please give me the strength to aid her!”</em>
</p><p>The power welled within him, and Severus let it flow from his lips, his low voice joining in counterpoint with Harry’s. With the growth of their relationship, their magic had intertwined so that their chants—unique to each caster—blended in an eerie harmony. Draco, looking worse for the wear but whole, staggered into place beside Severus and started a chant of his own, but his melody clashed with the haunting duet Severus and Harry wove over the girl. Blaise joined in too, and his song created a cacophony with two melodies in harmony and two out of it.</p><p>If ever Severus had needed proof of his growing soul-bond with Harry, he had just found it.</p><p>He sang on despite the distraction of Blaise’s and Draco’s discordant chants. After taking a <em>Sectumsempra </em>to the heart, Ginny needed all the help she could get.</p><p>Hermione sank to her knees beside Molly and leaned over the girl’s face, ear to her mouth, her expression focused despite her grief.</p><p>“Oh my god, s-she’s not breathing!”</p><p>Horror sinking in, Severus watched as the girl pinched Ginny’s nose, tipped her chin up, and covered the unconscious girl’s mouth with her own.</p><p>“O-oi,” said a stricken, shocked Ron. “What are you <em>doing</em>?”</p><p>“Breathing for her,” Dean explained, his eyes rimmed in red and wide with terror. “Oh gods, Gin. You can’t die on me! You promised me we’d be a f-family one day and….”</p><p>Severus tucked the sobbing boy into his arms, holding Dean’s face to his chest. If nothing else, perhaps his voice could soothe the distraught young man.</p><p>But gods, he hoped it wasn’t too late for her. Through Harry, Ginny was family. Her loss would cut him almost as deeply as the Weasleys and their adoptive son.</p><p>Hermione jerked up with a gasp.</p><p>Ron cried, “What? What is it? Is she—?”</p><p>Ginny interrupted him with a cough, sending a trail of crimson dripping down her face, but Merlin, at least she was breathing!</p><p>“Ginny!” Dean extricated himself from Severus’ embrace and edged between Hermione and his girlfriend’s mother. “Come on, baby. Come on. Open those pretty brown eyes. <em>Please</em>. Please don’t leave me.”</p><p>Ginny whispered, “D-Dean?”</p><p>Dean gave a half-laugh, half-sob of relief and pressed a kiss to her forehead. “Yes, love. I’m here.”</p><p>“Oh, my baby,” Molly breathed. “Oh, are you…?” Carefully, she eased the pressure on Ginny’s chest and wept when a gush of blood did not follow her hands. “Oh thank <em>Merlin</em>!”</p><p>Severus had half-expected the woman to lecture her daughter on the dangers of battle, but relief outweighed her righteous wrath instead. Molly knelt by Dean and laid her head on her daughter’s belly, sobs wracking her entire frame. Arthur dropped to his knees beside her and laid a hand on his wife’s back, soothing her even as he gave his daughter a stern look, though the tears on his face softened it.</p><p>“Don’t you <em>ever </em>terrify us like that again, Ginevra Molly Weasley! You could have <em>died</em>! By Merlin, you almost <em>did</em>!”</p><p>Ginny moaned and turned her head into Dean’s hand, which had been stroking her cheek. “Dad, please. I did all right until the very end. When the others started apparating out, I let my guard down, but the<em> rat</em>—” She snarled the word with utmost disgust. “—Had stayed behind in his Animagus form. He c-cursed me before he apparated out. He said something—had that awful name for Severus in it—and I don’t remember anything else except….” She grimaced. “Gods, that hurt.”</p><p>Kingsley had come that point, a field medical kit already open. “Does it still hurt?” He levitated a Blood Replenisher to Hermione.</p><p>“Not as bad,” Ginny muttered. “I’m just… dizzy.”</p><p>“Drink this,” Hermione said. “It’ll help. You lost a lot of blood.”</p><p>Ginny choked on the awful taste but swallowed the potion.</p><p>“Two more Blood Replenishers, Kingsley,” Severus said, ending his chant. “That was at least a third of her blood volume. You are lucky to be alive, Ginny. Harry and Hermione saved you.”</p><p>“You too, Severus,” Harry murmured, slipping his hand into his soul-bond’s. “You s-saved her too.”</p><p>With Ginny safe, Severus realised their adrenaline-induced numbness was wearing off, and any moment, Harry would have to face the guilt and grief of ending at least two lives that morning. Severus had killed at least three himself. They had no choice—in war, it was kill or be killed, and they certainly couldn’t afford to die, not with evil ruling both sides of the fight—but that knowledge did not make killing people any less terrible. Severus’ own turbulent emotions had begun to surface. He clung to Harry’s hand and let that bear him through the grief.</p><p>Harry turned into Severus’ chest and sniffled. “Verus, I think we’re going to have to meet that painter tomorrow instead.”</p><p>Severus could only nod and hold his lover tight.</p>
