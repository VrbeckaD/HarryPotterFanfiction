    <p dir="ltr">It’s Ginny’s fifth campus tour this spring, and quite frankly, they’re all the same at this point. Tree-lined quads, stately buildings, cheerful student guides showing the groups of parents and teenagers all the little quirks that make their uni particularly special: the lucky statue that students all make sure to touch before exams and the special cathedral that was apparently built during the tenth century, or something - that’s usually the part where Ginny tends to zone out and wonder when it’s all going to end. By the time it’s over, her purse ends up stuffed with brochures depicting groups of students laughing on grassy knolls or peering into microscopes. She usually chucks them into the bin once she gets home; she figures this weekend, she’ll just chuck them into Ron’s bin. Save herself the lecture from her mum about how gap years can’t go on forever. Save herself the breath of explaining that it hadn’t actually been a gap year in the traditional sense at all.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you so much for joining us,” chirps their tour guide with a massive smile pasted on her face once they’ve arrived back at the student union. “We hope to see you all next autumn.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>That’s likely</em>, Ginny thinks bitterly to herself, though she forms her mouth into a smile and takes a brochure as they’re passed around. She’s not sure what makes this university different from any of the others, aside from the fact that three of her brothers currently attend. </p><p dir="ltr">If she’s honest, that’s actually a point against it. </p><p dir="ltr">As their tour group disperses, Ginny slides her phone out of her back pocket to check the time. It’s nearly five in the afternoon; Ron’s last class of the day should be letting out any moment now. Just outside a generic-looking coffee stand is a little cluster of tables and chairs, and Ginny deposits herself into one of them to scroll through Instagram while she waits for him. </p><p>There’s a sudden flood of students through the lobby as they travel through between classes, and as Ginny’s scanning the crowd from her seat - Ron isn’t difficult to spot, as he usually stands a head above everyone else - her chair tips suddenly onto its back legs, and she lets out a startled yelp.</p><p dir="ltr">And then laughter. Familiar, <em>obnoxious</em> laughter. </p><p dir="ltr">She stands, whirls around, and smacks her brother on the chest. </p><p dir="ltr">“You prick!” she exclaims, glaring at him. “You scared the shit out of me.”</p><p dir="ltr">He holds his arms out wide to her, like he’s actually expecting a hug after nearly killing her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, right,” she snaps, hauling her duffel bag onto her shoulder. “Let’s go back to yours already, I need to change.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ron agrees and starts toward the door, and they weave their way through the throngs of students before stepping out into the crisp spring air. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows over the ancient buildings that line the streets.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know that I don’t mind at all,” says Ron as they walk, “but why’d you come up to visit on a Thursday? I’ve got classes tomorrow.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t come just to see <em>you</em>,” she chides, knocking her shoulder into his. “I came to see-“ She gestures grandly to their surroundings- “all of this.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Right,” chuckles Ron. “Sure you have.” </p><p dir="ltr">“Besides, Mum is driving me mad,” continues Ginny. “She asks me every day when I’m going to decide ‘what I’m doing with my life’.” She makes little quote marks in the air with her fingers. “I can’t even go to the loo without an interrogation, I just need a break from her.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ron nods sympathetically; he, too, has been on the receiving end of similar speeches from their mother. “Can’t blame you for that.”</p><p dir="ltr">His flat, which resides above a chippy, is only a few blocks’ walk from campus, and soon they’re climbing up a flight of stairs covered in dingy carpet, the scent of grease and vinegar sharp in their noses. Ron fiddles with the lock - his key, he explains, is slightly bent from the time he tried to use it to prise open a bottle of wine - and then they step inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny has six older brothers. She’s not unaccustomed to mess. But this… this is a new level, even for a Weasley. Plates are stacked high in the sink; empty pizza boxes and beer bottles cover the worktop; the sofa is missing its cushions altogether. The main positive is that the unctuous scent of the chippy is almost undetectable with the door closed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thanks for cleaning up for me,” Ginny grins, gravitating immediately to the refrigerator and opening it up. It contains mostly condiments and various types of alcohol, and she takes a beer from the middle shelf. “Can I have this?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, chuck us one too.” </p><p>She lobs a bottle at him and he grabs it deftly out of the air. </p><p>“So,” says Ron, twisting off the cap, “are you still going out with that - that artist bloke?”</p><p dir="ltr">“‘That artist bloke’,” Ginny scoffs. “His name is Dean. And no, we split up.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Really? Why?”</p><p dir="ltr">With a shrug, Ginny drinks from her own beer. “He’s a good guy and everything, but he… I don’t know. He treated me like this delicate little flower all the time, it was annoying.”</p><p>“Yeah, how dare he treat you well,” says Ron, voice dripping with sarcasm. “What an arse.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But it was like he didn’t know me at all, or he’d know I actually hate stuff like that.” She drinks again, deeply. “Where’s Harry?”</p><p dir="ltr">“He’s at some meeting for the football club. Here, let me give you the tour.”</p><p dir="ltr">It doesn’t take long to be shown around the flat. The loo appears to be in need of a good scouring and the closed door to Harry’s room is entirely uninteresting. Ron’s bedroom floor is covered in discarded clothes.</p><p dir="ltr">“So,” says Ginny, leaning against the door jamb as Ron tosses his rucksack onto his desk chair, “I really do appreciate you letting me stay for a few days, but, erm - where am I supposed to sleep? Did your sofa ever have cushions?”</p><p>“Oh, right,” says Ron, clearly having not considered this. “It did, but then the twins spilled some beer on the cushions so we put them on the fire escape to dry, only... then they got rained on…” He rubs at the back of his neck. “Erm, you can sleep in here, I guess, and I’ll just stay at Hermione’s.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny’s eyes widen in delight. “Hermione’s, huh? That’s still going, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s been almost a year now,” replied Ron sharply, cheeks going red, “and yes, it’s still going.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Is it serious?”</p><p dir="ltr">He’s almost beetroot now. “You could say that.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny feels herself light up from the inside out at the way his embarrassment mixes with obvious delight. “<em>Ron</em>-“</p><p>“So anyway,” he interrupts, eyes darting around, “you can stay in here, is that all right?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it’s fine, but-“ A stomach-turning thought occurs to her. “But have you washed your sheets, like, anytime recently?”</p><p dir="ltr">If it’s possible, his face blushes even further. “It’s just kind of expensive to use the washing machines and - and I’d rather wash my clothes-“</p><p>“Oh, <em>ewww</em>!” Ginny nearly bends double. “Ron, that is disgusting, there’s probably like - like <em>stains</em> on your sheets, you really expect me to sleep where you and your girlfriend - <em>eww</em>-“</p><p dir="ltr">“All right, all right,” Ron interrupts impatiently, “we’ll do a wash, but you had better have coins for the machine.”</p><p dir="ltr">She punches him on the arm.</p><p dir="ltr">But it doesn’t take any further urging for him to strip the bed and cram it all - including the duvet - into a laundry bag, and after grabbing more beer from the fridge, they troop down to the cellar, which houses exactly one washer and one dryer. As the bedclothes tumble about in the machine, which lets out near-constant metallic clangs, they lounge on folding chairs and work steadily through a six-pack.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fred and George are having a party tonight,” says Ron as he sets an empty bottle down on the floor. “If you want to go.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course I want to go,” she replies. “Is Harry going? Is <em>Hermione</em> going?” She waggles her eyebrows with the last question.</p><p dir="ltr">Ron quirks a brow at her. “Yes, they’re both going - why’ve you got to be that way about her, by the way, like it’s something scandalous? She’s my girlfriend, it’s all above board - ahh, hold on.” </p><p dir="ltr">He fishes his vibrating mobile phone out of his pocket and aims at the screen at Ginny: it shows the image of a smiling young woman with a mane of curly brown hair. </p><p dir="ltr">“Hey,” he answers, tone going gentler than Ginny has ever heard it. God, she thinks, he really is smitten. “Yeah, she just got here a little while ago... we’re actually doing laundry - yeah, it’s a long story-“</p><p>“It’s not that long a story!” Ginny yells, even as Ron flaps a hand in irritation at her and spins on his chair so he’s facing away.</p><p>“No, nothing… yeah, we’ll be here for a while, but I can come pick you up - oh, all right… yeah, probably just pizza or something - oh! Hold on.” He pivots again on his chair and directs his attention back to Ginny. “Did you bring a white t-shirt with you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Me?” </p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, did you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Er - no, I don’t think so-“</p><p dir="ltr">Ron puts the phone back to his ear. “Can Ginny borrow a white shirt from you?... all right… all right, yeah, just come down to the cellar… love you too. Bye.”</p><p>He hangs up, but continues to look at his phone, thumbs tapping rapidly against the screen. It takes a full minute for him to sense Ginny’s eyes on him. “What?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You said ‘I love you’ to her,” she marvels. “Are you really in love with her?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Would you stop acting like this is the eighth wonder of the world?” he snaps, reaching for another beer. “Yes. I love her. It’s why I’ve got all these stains to wash out, all right?”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny gasps. “So you admit there were stains!”</p><p dir="ltr">The door clicks open about ten minutes later, and a petite young woman in a white t-shirt and dark jeans descends the stairs. Ron’s eyes light up at the sight of her, and instantly Ginny feels a wave of guilt over her teasing. Hermione really does make him happy.</p><p dir="ltr">And besides, Ginny likes Hermione. They met last summer, when Hermione - who lives in London, a three-hour drive from the Weasley home in rural Devon - came to see Ron over the summer, and it was quite clear, from the second she arrived, how perfect they are for each other. They’re both stubborn and argumentative, but not in ways that clash; they complement each other. And Ron, more than anyone else Ginny knows, deserves happiness. </p><p dir="ltr">Ron stands, greets his girlfriend with a kiss, then offers her his chair. </p><p>“So gallant, isn’t he?” jokes Ginny as Ron rolls his eyes from his new seat atop the dryer. </p><p dir="ltr">“Quite,” Hermione says, though she shoots Ron a smile before extracting a white shirt from her purse and tossing it onto Ginny’s lap. “Here you go, by the way.” </p><p dir="ltr">“What do I need a white shirt for?”</p><p dir="ltr">Ron rolls his eyes again. “Because it’s a highlighter party tonight.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Which is?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Which is,” Hermione begins, disdain creeping into her voice like it so often does, “when everyone’s meant to wear a white shirt and write all over each other with fluorescent markers, so that it glows under the blacklights that your brothers have put up in their cellar.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Does that even work?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not really,” Ron admits. “It’s mostly just an excuse to get drunk and write insults on each other.”</p><p>Ginny considers this. “That could be fun too.”</p><p>The washing machine emits a painfully loud buzzing sound just then, and Ron jumps up to move the bedding into the dryer.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re washing your sheets?” asks Hermione excitedly. “Finally, after months of-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t get so excited,” Ginny interjects. “He’s only doing it because I told him to, because-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Oi!” comes Ron’s indignant yell. “It doesn’t matter why, but, erm, now we’re on the subject…” He flashes what he apparently believes is a winning smile at Hermione. “We’re staying at yours this weekend.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s fine - good, actually,” says Hermione brightly. “Hannah’s going home for the weekend to see her dad, so we’ll have more…” Her voice trails off as her eyes settle on Ginny and a flush rises up her neck. “Space.”</p><p>“So anyway,” says Ron loudly, “what kind of pizza should we get?”</p><p dir="ltr">Two hours later, Ron’s mattress is dressed in fresh-scented sheets for the first time in recent history, and they’ve all stuffed themselves to the brim with pizza. As it’s barely eight, and Ginny feels grimy from a train ride and her campus tour, she decides to shower and change into her apparently-mandatory white shirt. When she emerges after drying her hair - not an easy task, since her hair dryer kept shorting out the fuse - she finds her brother and his girlfriend squished into an armchair. A box of wine sits on the coffee table in front of them, plastic cups of burgundy liquid in their hands. On the telly, Sky Sports is playing highlights from the latest Manchester City match.</p><p>“We probably won’t leave for another hour or so,” says Ron, “so have some wine in the meantime.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny glares briefly at the empty frame of the sofa - she has never been more resentful of an inanimate object in her life - and then seats herself on the floor to fill up her own cup. </p><p dir="ltr">The wine is cheap and sweet and positively delicious, and the first serving of it goes down so easily that she feels she has no choice but to help herself to another. She half-listens to Ron and Hermione bicker as she scrolls through the notifications on her phone. Some Instagram likes on her latest picture - one of them from Dean, which makes her roll her eyes - and Yelp inviting her to review a nearby sandwich shop that she’s never been to, and a few new messages in the WhatsApp group chat comprised of her old football teammates. Nothing pressing, or even slightly important. </p><p dir="ltr">It’s nice, escaping for a few days. She’s already gotten the obligatory task of the weekend out of the way, and if there’s one thing she knows about her older brothers, it’s that they are sure to show her a good time. </p><p>“Oh,” says Ron, looking down at his phone as Hermione’s leaning over him to grab the remote control, “Harry says he’s gonna meet us there. He’s still in his meeting.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Let’s just go now, then,” says Hermione. “Fred and George won’t care if we’re early.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ron pauses, then lifts a shoulder in a halfhearted shrug. “Yeah, all right. This way we’ll get the good beer before it’s gone.”</p><p dir="ltr">The twins, who are mere months away from the ends of their university careers, live in a house on the complete opposite end of campus. As night has officially fallen in earnest, it’s a long and chilly walk to the party. Halfway through, Ron sheds his jacket and gives it to Hermione to wear over hers.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s interesting, watching them. They’re both completely comfortable with each other, clearly past the point of putting on airs and trying to impress the other, and yet also completely enamored with each other. The soppy look they keep giving each other is remarkable in just how genuine and earnest it is. Ron doesn’t give her his jacket because it’s what’s expected of him or because it would be impolite not to. He really just doesn’t want her to be cold. </p><p dir="ltr">The thought sends an odd pang through Ginny. It isn’t as sharp or visceral as envy. It’s more of a quiet understanding, at nine at night as she walks to a party, that someday, she too might like to find what they already have.</p><p>With a sigh, she shoves her hands in her pockets and jogs to catch up with Ron and Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr">Fred and George are identical, right down to the very last freckles on their smirking faces, and they open the back door to their house with a dramatic flourish.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, well, well,” says Fred, ushering them all inside. “Look what the cat drug in, it’s our baby sister-“</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, bugger off,” Ginny snarls, ducking around them to step inside the house.</p><p dir="ltr">“Been since Christmas, hasn’t it?” muses George, “and now she’s all grown up-“</p><p>“I am, actually,” she said quickly, “and I was under the impression that we’re early enough for the good beer?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Even better.” Fred loops an arm over Ginny’s shoulders and steers her into the kitchen, and if she thought Ron lived in squalor, it’s nothing compared to the twins. Vaguely, she wonders if they even own soap. “We’ve actually got you a little welcome gift.”</p><p dir="ltr">He yanks open the door to the refrigerator and extracts a six-pack of bottled cider. </p><p dir="ltr">“Bulmers!” Immediately Ginny takes one from the cardboard pack. “I knew you were my favorite brother.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oi!” says Ron indignantly. “I did <em>laundry</em> for you-“</p><p dir="ltr">“So then you admit it,” says Hermione, poking him on the chest. “It wasn’t for me at all, was it?”</p><p>Ron groans and squeezes his eyes shut, leaning his head back against a cabinet. “I can’t win.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You could win, and just wash your sheets on a regular basis...”</p><p dir="ltr">As they fall into their usual back-and-forth sparring, Ginny surveys the scene around her. Scattered among the detritus littering the dingy worktops are fluorescent markers of different sizes and colors, and Ginny swipes a thick green one and tucks it into her back pocket. </p><p dir="ltr">“So anyway,” she interrupts Ron and Hermione as Fred thunders down a nearby staircase, presumably to the cellar, “where’s this mysterious flatmate of yours?”</p><p dir="ltr">She doesn’t even know what he looks like. Ron is crap at social media, and his Instagram contains exactly four photos and he’s only got about fifty followers. Hermione doesn’t have a profile simply on principle (“it’s awful for your mental and emotional health” was the thesis of a long-winded diatribe she had issued one day last summer), so it’s not like she could find out anything about him, aside from what she’s learned in bits and pieces from Ron. </p><p dir="ltr">She knows his name is Harry Potter. She knows that he plays football. She knows that his parents died when he was a toddler, so he lives with his godfather (which Ginny had truly thought was the sort of thing that only happened in films). And she knows that he is the best friend Ron has ever had.</p><p dir="ltr">“He’ll be along,” replies Ron, scrolling through his phone with one hand, the other wrapped around a tall can of Carlsberg. “Though honestly, I can’t blame him for not rushing right here-“</p><p dir="ltr">George gives a dramatic gasp. “You take that back! I won’t hear a <em>word</em> against this party, it’s the pinnacle of class - old Liz only <em>wishes</em>-“</p><p dir="ltr">As Ron breaks down laughing, Ginny uses the edge of the worktop to pry open her bottle of cider. “Well,” she says, tossing the cap into a paper takeaway bag on the counter (because in the surprise of the century, there isn’t a bin in sight). “Since none of you feel like showing me around, I’m going to give myself a tour.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dramatically, she flips her long hair over one shoulder and sweeps out of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">As far as houses for uni students go, there’s nothing special about the place at all. It has almost no decor, unless one considers a large beer stain in the sitting room as such, and the furniture is old and mismatched. Ginny takes it upon herself to head up to the first floor, where she locates an unkempt bathroom and a long hallway with three doors. The ceilings of the second floor are slanted, and it appears to house one additional bedroom. </p><p>It’s nothing remarkable. She didn’t need a tour of the house at all, not even a self-guided one. And as much as she loves her brothers - she would die for them in a heartbeat, with no questions asked - they make her feel like she’s back home in Devon. For most people this would be a good thing, but home just reminds her of where she <em>isn’t</em> anymore, and she’d prefer not to think about that. </p><p>She gulps down the rest of her cider as she walks back down the stairs, but as she returns to the kitchen, she finds she’s now the only Weasley there. And she also finds that she’s now staring at the back of a tall young man whose unkempt black hair sticks out at all angles. He’s mixing up a cocktail in a plastic cup and, for just a second, she watches the muscles flex under his white shirt as he combines whiskey with fizzy drink. </p><p>Ginny grabs another cider from the refrigerator, and then tries to use the edge of the worktop to open it like she did last time, but all she succeeds in doing is startling the bloke with dark hair. He spins around at the noise, and she almost feels struck: behind round, wire-rimmed glasses, he has the brightest green eyes she has ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sorry!” she yelps, biting back a smile at the look on his face. “I was just trying to - sorry.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not a twist-off, then?” he asks, a dark eyebrow sliding up his forehead.</p><p dir="ltr">“It worked last time.” The full effect of beer, wine, and cider must be hitting her all at once, because she feels a bit unsteady on her feet.</p><p dir="ltr">“Here.” He crosses the kitchen to stand in front of her. He’s tall, but not in the way that it’s the first thing anyone notices about him. Just enough that it gives him a presence. “I’ve got it.”</p><p dir="ltr">He digs into the pocket of his jeans and pulls out a key ring, attached to which is a little metal bottle opener. Ginny passes him the bottle, and their fingers brush. </p><p dir="ltr">Despite the rap music pulsing from the cellar below them, everything seems to have gone quiet. There’s even a little hiss of carbonation as the bottle cap pops off. </p><p dir="ltr">“Thanks,” Ginny manages. “I probably would have ended up breaking the bottle or something.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No problem,” he replies, then tilts his head. “Wait, are you - Ron’s sister? Ginny?”</p><p dir="ltr">And that’s when it hits her; this has to be Harry. Her brother’s flatmate. Her brother’s best friend in the entire world. And he is <em>gorgeous</em>.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“Did the hair give it away?” she grins.</p><p dir="ltr">“Maybe a little bit.” His lips twist in a semblance of a smile, and oh, this is bad. This is really, really bad. Because she’s still sober enough to know this is a bad idea, but legless enough not to care. “I’m Harry.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny shakes the hand he holds out to her, and he smiles in earnest now.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s nice to meet you, Harry. So tell me…” She smirks. “Haven’t you got anywhere better to be on a Thursday night than here?”</p><p dir="ltr">Laughter bubbles up out of him. <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck</em>. “Could say the same to you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, but sadly, I don’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ahh, it’s not so bad,” says Harry. “C’mon, let’s go downstairs, I can show you just how much this premise doesn’t work.”</p><p dir="ltr">He drinks from his cup, and Ginny watches, mesmerized as he licks a stray bead of moisture from his bottom lip. </p><p dir="ltr">“Sure,” she nods. He probably could have invited her to play on the train tracks, and she would have happily joined him. Harry jerks his head in the direction of the stairs, and they start to walk. “It’s always nice when I can prove that my brothers are idiots.”</p><p dir="ltr">He flashes her a smile over his shoulder as he walks, and her stomach flips. </p><p dir="ltr">“Where is Ron, anyway?” asks Harry as they step down the stairs, raising his voice to be heard over the thumping bass issuing from the speakers. </p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t know,” Ginny half-shouts back. “I left for five minutes and he vanished.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Snuck off with Hermione somewhere?”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny mimes vomiting into her hands. “Don’t remind me.”</p><p dir="ltr">They’re in a little corner of the cellar, opposite one of the speakers, and the blacklights are in full force. Everyone’s shirts are glowing in the near-absolute darkness, but she can barely make out Harry’s face. There are a few almost-microscopic bits of lint clinging to the fabric of his trousers, and she can’t believe it, but she finds it endearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Not that her eyes have drifted in that general direction or anything. Not at all. That would be ludicrous.</p><p dir="ltr">She drinks down a bit more cider; throngs of drunken partygoers have made the cellar suffocatingly humid, and the alcohol is cool and crisp in her throat. “They must drive you nuts,” she says, leaning against the wall. “They’re so obsessed with each other.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I might just be used to it at this point,” he shrugs. “But nah, they’re all right. They’re my best friends, anyway.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You could do worse,” she says. </p><p>He scrubs a hand through his hair, making it stick up straight. “That’s what I reckon too.”</p><p>This feels raw and vulnerable in a way that Ginny never would have expected with someone whom she met all of five minutes ago. Quickly, she changes tacks. “So you play football?”</p><p dir="ltr">He nods. “Striker. You too, right?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Left-wing.”</p><p>She’s probably imagining it - she’s several drinks in and can barely see her own hand in front of her face - but for a second, she’s almost positive that his eyes slide appraisingly up and down her figure. </p><p dir="ltr">“Nice, so who do you support?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Er-“ Ginny takes another long swallow of her cider. “Well, I haven’t watched much of the Premier League this season - oh, don’t worry,” she adds. “It’s not because all my favorite teams get relegated, I’m not Ron.”</p><p dir="ltr">Even Harry’s teeth glow in the darkness as he chuckles. “He was crushed over Sunderland.”</p><p>“He really was.”</p><p dir="ltr">She’s never experienced anything like this. Words fly fast and easy between them, and her cheeks hurt from laughing. The conversation turns easily from taking the piss out of Ron to discussion of Harry’s football team and Ginny’s annoyingly enthusiastic tour guide from earlier that day, and as the music and the people around them grow deafening, he’s practically speaking directly into her ear. His warm breath on her skin sends tingles up her spine. </p><p dir="ltr">This wasn’t meant to happen. Her brother’s flatmate wasn’t meant to have this effect on her. But Harry… he’s magnetic. Ginny can’t help but want to be near him, to want to know everything about him. </p><p dir="ltr">“You want another drink?” asks Harry, pointing at the empty bottle in her hand. </p><p dir="ltr">“Definitely.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Another one of those?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I’ll go with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">And once again, she’s not sure - it could be the burly rugby player dancing drunkenly behind her - but she thinks Harry’s hand might just graze across her lower back as he guides her to the stairs. </p><p dir="ltr">Blinking against the harsh light of the ground floor, they step into the kitchen to find Hermione sitting on the worktop, Ron standing between her legs. His shirt is covered in various curse words and insults; Hermione’s is still pristine. </p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, good!” Ron exclaims. “You two’ve met, then. Couldn’t find either of you for the longest time.”</p><p dir="ltr">“We were just downstairs,” says Ginny, feeling oddly defensive, as Harry pulls open the refrigerator and peers inside.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bad news,” he announces. “Your cider’s gone.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What?!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Someone prob’ly stole ‘em,” says Ron with a liquor-induced drawl in his voice. “Or Fred and George just took ‘em back for themselves.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Sons of bitches,” mutters Ginny angrily, and Harry nearly snorts with laughter. “Just a beer, then, I guess.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, don’t,” says Ron. “We’ve got to go, soon.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And since when are you my keeper?”</p><p dir="ltr">He waves a dramatically dismissive hand, and behind him, Hermione suppresses a giggle.</p><p dir="ltr">“We’ve both got classes tomorrow,” he continues, still gesticulating madly, “and so I’m gonna walk you home, and make sure you’re all right, and then I’m gonna walk home with Hermione - and then I’m gonna <em>stay</em> there and you’re gonna stay at mine. Yeah?”</p><p dir="ltr">“But it’s still so early - and I don’t <em>need</em> anyone to walk me, I’m perfectly capable-“</p><p dir="ltr">“D’y’know how disappointed Mum’ll be if you get murdered?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m not going to get <em>murdered</em>,” snaps Ginny as Harry presses a can of beer into her hand. “Plus, it’s fine. Harry’ll make sure I get back in one piece.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah,” Harry chimes in. “We’re going to the same place anyway.”</p><p>“Oh, right!” Ron nods, eyelids heavy. “Then we’re gonna go.” He approaches Ginny and places his hands on her shoulders, fixing her with a serious expression. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll try my best.”</p><p>He and Hermione depart hand-in-hand, and despite the partygoers milling in and out of the kitchen, Ginny feels like she and Harry are entirely alone.</p><p>And she likes it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Back downstairs?” suggests Harry. “Your shirt is entirely too - er - un-written-on.” He lets out a little bark of a laugh at his own awkwardness. “You know what I mean, come on.”</p><p dir="ltr">The cellar, in the short time they’ve been absent, has taken on a life of its own. The music blares around them, the bass beat so intense that it thrums in Ginny’s chest. She can barely distinguish the outline of Harry’s form as he leads her through the crowd, and she has no idea where they’re going. They reach the back of the room and Harry turns to the right, then glances back to make sure she’s still following him.</p><p>They've found a tiny little back room, which is lit by a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. An old, stained wooden bar stands opposite them, and behind that, the twins are pouring whiskey into plastic shot glasses.</p><p>“Oh good,” says Fred, pushing two filled cups toward them. “You’ve got to help us finish the bottle.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Do we?” says Harry warily, though he accepts one all the same.</p><p>“Can’t let it go to waste,” adds George brightly. “Whiskey goes bad once you open the bottle, you know - here you go, Gin, drink up now.” </p><p dir="ltr">She’s lost count of how many drinks she’s had, but she also doesn’t want the night to end.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thanks,” she says, and picks up the little cup to study the amber liquid inside.</p><p>George points a finger at Harry. “Where’s your sidekick?”</p><p dir="ltr">“They left.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Already? It’s not even midnight yet.” George shakes his head in mock disdain. “I thought we raised him better than that.”</p><p>Harry turns to Ginny and raises his shot. “Ready?”</p><p dir="ltr">She holds hers up as well. “Ready.”</p><p dir="ltr">It burns down her throat and settles into her stomach, then floods warm through her veins. </p><p dir="ltr">“Another?” offers Fred hopefully, but she shakes her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Maybe in a bit.” She turns her head towards Harry, who’s still grimacing from the sting of the alcohol, and for a second he blurs before her. “You’re a lightweight, aren’t you?” </p><p dir="ltr">“No,” says Harry, feigning indignance, “how dare you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ve had like, twice as much to drink as you and we’re equally as drunk as each other.” The words feel clumsy and heavy in her mouth, and to form them takes more concentration than she’s proud of. “Okay, not equal. But close.”</p><p dir="ltr">“That first drink I made was pretty strong.”</p><p>“I’ve had like - like <em>eight</em> ciders-“</p><p dir="ltr">“All right,” interrupts Fred loudly, stepping out from behind the bar. “Go flirt somewhere else, don’t make me watch his.”</p><p dir="ltr">Unceremoniously, he places a hand on each of their backs and shoves them out into the melee of the party. Ginny stumbles, trips over her own feet, and nearly collides with a group of girls drinking tinned gin-and-tonics.</p><p dir="ltr">“You all right?” asks Harry. </p><p dir="ltr">“I’m fine,” she shouts back. “My brother’s just an arsehole.”</p><p dir="ltr">He folds his arms across his chest and regards her. It’s still so dark that she can barely see him, but she can feel his eyes piercing through her.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what to write on you,” he finally says with an embarrassed little laugh. “It’s not like I can really draw anything either.”</p><p>M</p><p dir="ltr">“Good,” she says fervently. “My ex-boyfriend - we broke up, like - like months ago - he was an artist.”</p><p dir="ltr">Quickly, Harry nods. “I definitely can’t draw.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I have an idea for you, though.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah?” He brushes off the front of his shirt and holds it taut. “Have at it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, no, not the front. Turn around.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Y’know, the last time a girl asked me to do that, it didn’t end well-“ </p><p dir="ltr">“Shut <em>up</em>.” </p><p dir="ltr">Ginny grabs him by the shoulders and steps around behind him. It is the most amazing excuse to touch him, smoothing the fabric over his solid muscles, one hand holding the shirt in place so it doesn’t move with the motion of her marker. </p><p dir="ltr">She’s not sure what compels her to write what she does. Maybe it’s because of the whiskey currently coursing through her, gradually lowering her inhibitions and her ability to second-guess herself. Maybe it’s because her entire life has been unceremoniously tossed into the air and she has no idea where the pieces will land, and she doesn’t want this new, intriguing little bit of it - him - to land too far away. She wants to keep him close, to stay connected. And she wants him to know that she’s more than just Ron’s little sister.</p><p dir="ltr">So she writes. Green ink bleeds into white cotton (and maybe it does glow, a little bit, but certainly not enough to warrant an entire party) and the marker snags on the cloth and it’s hard to form legible figures, but she does it.</p><p dir="ltr">

</p><p>“There.” She pats his shoulder. “All set.”</p><p>He twists, trying to see what she’s written. “What’d you do? What insult have you chosen?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not an insult,” she says quickly. “Definitely not.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So what is it, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’ll have to wait and see.” Briefly, she imagines him peeling off his shirt. “Let’s go get another drink.”</p><p dir="ltr">Locking a hand around his wrist, she drags him in the direction of the stairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The refrigerator is mostly depleted, not that it contained much of worth anyway, but Ginny does find a bottle of vodka hidden away in the back of the freezer.</p><p>“So why’d you split up?” asks Harry as Ginny seeks out a clean glass, which is no easy feat in the disaster zone that is the kitchen.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You and the artist.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He was barely an artist,” she says. “I mean, he was decent at drawing, but it wasn’t like, his career or anything.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I see.”</p><p dir="ltr">“He wasn’t a bad guy or anything.” She finds a stack of cups atop the microwave and fumbles with them to select one from the middle (where she suspects they’re the cleanest). “He just… he somehow managed to smother me from six hundred miles away.” She twists the cap off the vodka. “Not like, actually smother me in a murder-y way or anything-“</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t think so.” He rakes his fingers through his hair, and for the second time that night, Ginny is mesmerized by the simple movement of his arm. “What’re you planning to mix that with?”</p><p>Ginny sniffs the rim of the bottle, and its potency makes her stomach turn. “On second thought,” she cringes, “I might be done. Here.”</p><p>She holds out the bottle to him, and he takes it from her - only to replace the cap, and cram it back into the freezer.</p><p dir="ltr">“We can get going,” says Harry. “Got a bit of a walk ahead of us.”</p><p>Ginny nods; the party has long lost whatever luster it may have had. Her stomach has become uncomfortably full, like it’s angry with her for how much liquid she’s forced it to hold, and the room is starting to slowly spin around her. She just wants her bed and a big bottle of Lucozade.</p><p dir="ltr">“My mum always says not to go home with strangers,” she mumbles as they head down the drive.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m not a stranger, am I?”</p><p>“No,” she realizes with a shake of her head, which almost makes her lose her balance. “No, you’re really not.” </p><p>The walk home seems so much longer than the walk here, likely because Ginny has to concentrate on putting one foot directly in front of the other. Harry keeps talking to her, probably just to make sure she’s still coherent, but she doesn’t mind. She likes the sound of his voice, warm and low and already familiar.</p><p>Finally, they arrive in front of the chippy. Even though it’s closed, the stairwell still smells like oil and malt vinegar.</p><p dir="ltr">With a metallic clunk, Harry turns the deadbolt lock on the door, and then they step into a flat so silent that it’s somehow deafening. There is so much that Ginny wants. She wants to cross the dirty sitting room, plunge her fingers into his messy hair, and kiss him until she can’t even breathe. She wants to follow him into his bedroom. She wants to tell him that one party with him has made her feel more alive than she has all year. </p><p dir="ltr">But as it is, she’s practically swaying on unsteady legs, and when she blinks, she sees three of him. </p><p>“You’re sleeping in Ron’s room, right?”</p><p dir="ltr">Ginny bursts out into uncontrollable peals of laughter. “He had to do <em>laundry</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I heard. Well…” The tip of his tongue sneaks out over his upper lip. “Goodnight, then.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight.”</p>
