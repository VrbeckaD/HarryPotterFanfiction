<p>“Harry!  Harry!” Ron began yelling as soon as he appeared in the Floo.</p>
<p>“Ronald!” Hermione yelled as she followed him.</p>
<p>	Harry stood in the doorway watching as Ron ducked away from his wife.</p>
<p>	“Sorry Harry, I know how you hate people just Flooing in on you,” Hermione apologized.</p>
<p>	“But mate you have to see this,” Ron interjected.</p>
<p>	Hermione turned, “Don’t make me hex you!”</p>
<p>	He ducked his head, “Sorry,” he mumbled, “but we have to tell him.”</p>
<p>	“Immediately?” she asked.</p>
<p>	Ron looked like he wanted to answer with something smart arsed but thought better of it and kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>	Harry shook his head, “Some things never change.  Well you’re here, whatever it is you may as well tell me.  What is it are you pregnant again Hermione?”</p>
<p>	Hermione turned a shade of red to match her husband’s hair, “Um.”</p>
<p>	Harry laughed, “You are aren’t you?”</p>
<p>	Ron bit his lip and muttered to Harry, “She’s threatening to send me to a Muggle doctor for some procedure.”</p>
<p>	Harry snorted, “Well you’ve managed to have five kids in the past five years you’re lucky she’s waited this long.”</p>
<p>	“How was I supposed to know we’d end up with two sets of twins?”</p>
<p>	“If this is another set you may never get to share a bed again,” Harry chortled.</p>
<p>	“Harry,” Hermione warned.</p>
<p>	Harry shook his head, “Well it’s the truth isn’t it,” he replied while reaching for his wand just in case.</p>
<p>	“Ha-rry!” </p>
<p>	“Mate,” Ron started, “we’d better stop now. You know how she is when she’s pregnant,” he finished in a whisper only Harry could hear.</p>
<p>	Harry walked to Hermione and pulled her into a hug, “Congratulations!  You know I love having more nieces and nephews to spoil.”</p>
<p>	Hermione hugged him back, while shooting Ron a death glare over Harry’s shoulder. “We haven’t told anyone else.  That wasn’t even why we came over tonight, so just keep it to yourself for a while longer will you?”</p>
<p>	“Absolutely.  So if you didn’t come to tell me about the newest Weasley why are you here?  What had Ron in such a dither?”</p>
<p>	Hermione looked a bit uncomfortable as she reached into her handbag and pulled out a shopping bag.</p>
<p>Harry groaned, “Mione you didn't take Ron to the Muggle bookshop again did you?”</p>
<p>Before she could answer the fire flared green again and out stepped a well dressed blonde. </p>
<p>“Sorry Potter, didn't know you had company.” </p>
<p>“S’ok Malfoy, they just popped in.”</p>
<p>“We can pick up our chess game next week,” Draco said as he turned back to the fire, racing for the Floo powder. </p>
<p>“No, Draco stay we won't be here long.  We came to tell Harry something. Well Ron did, I was trying to stop him.”</p>
<p>“And I see you succeeded.”</p>
<p>“Funny Malfoy. Come on Mione, let's go. We can talk to Harry later.”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head,  “No we're here now.  Besides there's no reason Draco shouldn't know.”</p>
<p>“Know what?” Draco asked. </p>
<p>“Don’t know but it should be interesting.  Hermione took Ron Muggle shopping again.  He’s nearly as fascinated with Muggle things as his dad,” Harry replied.</p>
<p>“Ah so there will be a story.  Perhaps we should sit then,” Draco suggested.</p>
<p>“Right,” Harry agreed summoning chairs for the quartet, “Kreacher.”</p>
<p>Kreacher popped in next to Harry’s chair, “Yes Master Harry?”</p>
<p>“Would you please bring us some tea?  Oh and be sure Hermione’s cup is<br/>decaffeinated.” </p>
<p>“Yes Master Harry.  I’ll be right back with tea and biscuits.”</p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow and looked towards Hermione, “Decaffeinated? I suppose<br/>I should say congratulations?”</p>
<p>Again Hermione blushed, “As long as you say nothing to anyone else then yes and thank<br/>you Draco.”</p>
<p>	“Ok Ron so tell what it is that had you in such a lather you had to come tell me about.<br/>What did you find now?”</p>
<p>Ron glanced over at Draco before beginning, “We were shopping for Mione’s parents for Christmas.”</p>
<p>“And Ron wandered away because he was bored at what you were looking at?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Oi!” Ron complained.</p>
<p>“Really Ron am I wrong?  I’ve been with you in Muggle shops, you can’t stand still you wander around looking at everything.”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, “That’s exactly what he did, next thing I know he comes running over, grabs me by the arm and drags me to the children’s section.”</p>
<p>“There was this display of books and games and pictures and they were all of you.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Well you but not you,” Ron replied, “All kinds of books and games about Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>“In a Muggle bookshop?” Draco questioned again with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>Kreacher returned and began passing out cups of tea and plates of biscuits.</p>
<p>“Yes! That’s why I dragged Hermione to see it, I was sure I was seeing things or some witch or wizard had bespelled a section of the store.”</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione began, “I think the witch you finally let write your biography went and sold it to a Muggle production company as a children’s fiction series.  Actually I’m sure of it.”  She pulled a boxed set of books out of the shopping bag and handed it over to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry turned the box over in his hands looking at the titles.  Draco came and stood to peer over his shoulder. “Who’s this Half Blood Prince?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>Harry looked up at him, “I take it you didn’t read the biography?”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head, “I lived so much of it along with you and I really didn’t want to relive it thank you.  It’s not like I come off well in it I’m sure.  I was rather a-”</p>
<p>“Prat,” cut in Ron.</p>
<p>“Git,” Harry supplied.</p>
<p>“Bloody bugger,” Hermione added with a large grin.</p>
<p>“Ok you can stop taking the piss now,” Draco rolled his eyes, “Yes all of those things and worse. Who wants to read about themselves that way?”</p>
<p>“Honestly I know what you mean,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>“Yeah I was a right prat myself to Harry fourth year, and I took off on the two of them in the midst of the hunt for the horcruxes.”</p>
<p>“Not to mention all of the times you snogged Lavender right in from of Mione,” Harry put in.<br/>Ron flinched and looked up, “Mate do you have to? She still knows that bloody bird charm?”</p>
<p>Harry laughed then turned back to Draco, “Snape was the Half Blood Prince.  Wait if you don’t know that how much do you know about Snape and the Order?”</p>
<p>“You mean that he was a double agent?  I got all that from the Prophet and the Quibbler, I figured if it was in both it had to be the truth.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah I guess it was in there.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, the books Harry,” Hermione said, “They’re written like they’re made up stories.  I haven’t done more than skim through the first one but I had to buy them to read and see if they changed anything at all.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll need this back,” Harry held out the box.</p>
<p>“No that one’s just for you.  I bought one for myself.”</p>
<p>“And one for Mum and Dad, and one for Bill and Fleur, and one for Percy, and one for-”</p>
<p>“We get the idea Ron, thanks.”</p>
<p>Draco looked at Hermione questioningly, “You don’t happen to have an extra do you?  I’ll pay you for it. Or could you tell me which shop I could go to, to buy a set.”</p>
<p>Hermione reached in her handbag and pulled out another boxed set, “You can have this one.”</p>
<p>“How much do I owe you?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, “Oh don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“No really.  I can get Muggle money to give you or just tell me how many galleons.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea how much it is in wizard money but it was £40.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go to Gringotts tomorrow and make the exchange.  I can owl it to you or just have them deposit it in your account there.”</p>
<p>“Really Draco it’s ok.  Just take the books.”</p>
<p>“No I should pay.  Besides you’re probably going to be needing to buy more baby things, and from what I hear children are expensive.”</p>
<p>“Too bloody right,” Ron muttered then ducked his head as his wife sent him a glare.</p>
<p>“We need to go, we left Molly with the kids and she’s bound to be needing her bed about now.”</p>
<p>“Or a stiff drink,” Draco whispered so that only Harry could hear.</p>
<p>Harry stood. “Thanks for bringing the books.  I’ll give them a look over.”</p>
<p>“As will everyone else.”</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione grabbed a handful of Floo powder each and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Draco, “You’re really going to read these?”</p>
<p>Draco nodded, “I think it’s more than time for me to face my past. Maybe if I read it in small parts like these books it won’t be so bad.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, “We could start reading them now while we drink our tea.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we could.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t want to read them with anyone else around do you?”</p>
<p>“No, I… oh hell.  I’ll read it.  It’s not like you weren’t there and you’re speaking to me now so why not.”</p>
<p>Harry stifled a chuckle and gestured to the chair, “Make yourself comfortable.”</p>
<p>They sat and read in silence for a while.</p>
<p>“I thought you didn’t know you could speak Parseltongue?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“But you talked to the snake at the zoo.”</p>
<p>“But I didn’t know I wasn’t speaking in English.”</p>
<p>“You really lived in a cupboard?” This was simply unfathomable to Draco who had grown up at the Manor.<br/>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head.</p>
<p>“You’re family are right aresholes.”</p>
<p>“And yours is so wonderful?”</p>
<p>	“Oi!”</p>
<p>	“Ok your Mum is ok but your Dad was awful even to you.”</p>
<p>	Harry was answered by just a small nod.</p>
<p>	“Hagrid used magic on a Muggle?”</p>
<p>	“You gonna report him now?”</p>
<p>	“No.  I think I’d actually like to go shake his hand.”</p>
<p>	With this Harry jumped up and crossed to Draco’s chair putting his hand on Malfoy’s forehead.</p>
<p>	“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>	“Well you clearly aren’t feeling well if you want to shake Hagrid’s hand.”</p>
<p>	“Get off!”</p>
<p>	Harry laughed and returned to his chair.</p>
<p>	“I really must have been beastly to remind you of your cousin.”</p>
<p>	“Well it’s not like you were nice.”</p>
<p>	“I know.”</p>
<p>	“It gets worse doesn’t it.”</p>
<p>	“Well yes, but remember we were just kids.  And you were a spoiled rich pureblood, so you know.” Harry grinned.</p>
<p>	Draco grimaced.</p>
<p>	“Malfoy that was a joke.”</p>
<p>	“But it was the truth.”</p>
<p>	“Maybe I should skip ahead some.”</p>
<p>	“If you want.”</p>
<p>	“Ok fine, I won’t bottle it.  I’ll keep reading but I think I am going to go home.”</p>
<p>	“Fine, we can pick up chess again next week.”</p>
