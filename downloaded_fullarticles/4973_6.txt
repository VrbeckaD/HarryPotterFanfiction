          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus snuggled into his pillow happily, a few mornings after the full moon and he was feeling quite rested. Nothing could disturb this calm quiet and stillness.</p><p>"MOONY!"</p><p>However, he was very wrong.</p><p>"MOONY! MOONYYYYY!" Sirius shouted, leaping onto his bed excitedly.</p><p>Remus groaned, pulled his blanket up as far as he could. "Moony, Remus, I just saw the most unbelievable thing!" Sirius exclaimed bouncing on the bed shaking Remus.</p><p>Remus groaned again, pulling the blanket tighter over him, trying to stop Sirius shaking him. "Moony, come on, this is big, really big!"</p><p>Remus went still and quiet. Sirius whined.</p><p>"Fine." Remus said pulling the blanket down and looking at Sirius, "What?"</p><p>Sirius grinned, "I caught James, our James, and the one and only Lily Evans, snogging, a lot."</p><p>"What. Are you serious?"</p><p>Nodding ecstatically, Sirius grinned proudly. "In more ways than than one." He winked.</p><p>Remus was pleasantly stunned, then he started laughing. "I bloody knew it. I bloody knew it! Those little shits. Bloody Merlin, I swear."</p><p>They both lose their shit laughing, Sirius falls onto the bed next to Remus.</p><p>Suddenly the door bursts open and in comes James Potter, unable to remain still, staring at his best friends.</p><p>He opens his mouth to say something but nothing comes out except a strange whining sound.</p><p>"I, I need help, like, now, please."</p><p>Remus and Sirius calm down and sit up. "What's up?"</p><p>"I just snogged Lily, Lily Evans. What do I do?"</p><p>"Did you ask her out?" Remus asked.</p><p>James nodded, "I did."</p><p>"And she said?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then what's the problem?" Sirius asked very confused, and yet, very amused.</p><p>James paused and looked around, ran a hand through his hair, "I, I don't know..." He turned to his bed and fell onto in with a sigh. "She said yes."</p><p>Sirius laughed, "James, mate, what are you doing?"</p><p>"I don't know..." He whined.</p><p>Remus gets up and walks over to James, "Mate, go see her, she's probably wanting to see you." Remus waited for a response, "Jam-"</p><p>Leaping off his bed, James shouted, "I'VE GOT TO GO." And he walks right out the door.</p><p>Sirius and Remus watched him go, "Well that was something."</p><p>Sirius snorted, "He's such a prat."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Obviously. Can't be that hard to shag someone."</p><p>Remus laughed, "Have you?"</p><p>"Have I what?"</p><p>"Shagged someone?"</p><p>Sirius bit his lip, "No."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Don't feel like it." Sirius shrugged.</p><p>Remus moved back over to his bed, "You don't want to shag anyone?"</p><p>Sirius shrugged again.</p><p>"Sirius?"</p><p>Sirius shuffled uncomfortably.</p><p>Remus moved over and sat on the bed in front of Sirius, bothI had their legs crossed.</p><p>"Moony, can, can I..." Sisius hesitated. Remus waited patiently.</p><p>"Can I k-kiss you?" He squeaked out, wide eyed, clutching tightly onto his pants.</p><p>Remus froze. "What?"</p><p>"N-nothing! It's nothing!" Sirius said getting up quickly, laughing nervously.</p><p>Remus grabbed Sirius's arm, "Why? Why me?"</p><p>Sirius stopped and looked down at his feet, "'Cause it's you," He mumbled, "don't want anyone else."</p><p>Remus swung his legs onto the floor and pulled Sirius between them. "Do you like me, Padfoot?"</p><p>Small timid nodding came from the shorter man, "Yeah..."</p><p>Remus smiled, "Good."</p><p>Sirius looked up, "What?"</p><p>"Good." Remus said grinning, a mischievous glint to his eyes, "I like you too, Padfoot."</p><p>"Thank Merlin." Sirius breathed out, slumping against Remus. "That was terrifying. I hope you plan to kiss me soon, I do deserve it."</p><p>Remus chuckled, "Mm probably."</p><p>Sirius raised his hands and rested them on Remus's cheeks, cupping them gently with a slight tremble.</p><p>Remus pulled Sirius even closer by his hips, his breath ghosting over the other man's lips. He leaned in slowly and lips touched softly, beautifully.</p><p>They part as Remus practically yanked Sirius onto his lap and goes to town on his mouth, Sirius moaned happily, reciprocated very willingly.</p><p>"MOONY! PADFOOT! LILY HAS AGR-" James cut himself of with a shriek as his two best friends made out.</p><p>James stared for a bit, adjusting, "Uhhhh.." Sirius moved back from Remus, Remus latching himself onto Sirius's neck, ignoring James.<br/> "Moony-" Sirius moaned, "Remus, love, I c-cant-" He moaned again.</p><p>"I'M SCARRED FOR LIFE!" James screamed, laughing, running around the room, "HAVE FUUUUUUUUN KIDS~" And he pranced out the door, gleefully.</p><p>Sirius and Remus completely absorbed in each other, didn't even notice James enter and exit. They don't feel guilty at all.</p><p>The end.</p></div>
