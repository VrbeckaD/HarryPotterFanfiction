    <p>It was nighttime, there was a neighborhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flew off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stopped at the start of the street and took out a mechanical device and zapped all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meowed The man, called Albus Dumbledore, looked down at the tabby cat which sat on a brick ledge.</p><p>He looked at the cat. "I should have known that you would be here... Professor McGonagall." he says to the cat.</p><p>The cat sniffled and showed a woman for her to appear with a strange shadow performance. "Good evening, Professor Dumbledore," the woman replied to the man. "Are the rumors true, Albus?"</p><p>"I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad..." Dumbledore tells her, his voice soft but obvious power underneath it.</p><p>"And the children?" McGonagall questioned.</p><p>As they walked up the road a little, towards one house in particular, Dumbledore looked at her. "Hagrid is bringing them." he tells her.</p><p>"Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?" McGonagall then asked as they walked.</p><p>"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life." Dumbledore tells her.</p><p>A motorcycle was heard and it came flying down, skidding on the streer before it stopped. A large figure took off his goggles, revealing a gruff but kind looking giant man; Hagrid.</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall." He greets.</p><p>Dumbledore looked at him. "No problems, I trust, Hagrid?" He asks the man.</p><p>Hagrid smiled. "No, sir. Little tykes fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake them... There you go." he says, handing the baby to Dumbledore and the three-year old toddler to Professor McGonagall.</p><p>McGongall observed the children. "Albus," she spoke to Dumbledore. "Do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are-"</p><p>"The only family they have." Dumbledore finishes gently. He stopped outside a house.</p><p>The toddler was fast asleep, but looked unhappy. McGongall made it to the door with them as she checked on the children. The baby shifted slightly, but didn't once wail or scream.</p><p>"The children will be famous, especially the boy," McGongall spoke. "There wont be a child in our world who don't know their names."</p><p>"Exactly, they're better off growing up away from all that... Until they are ready." Dumbledore says softly. He put the boy down on the porch and took the girl placing her beside the baby.</p><p>Hagrid coughed and sniffled, crying. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Dumbledore looked over to him gently. "There, there, Hagrid it's not really good-bye, after all." He says gently.</p><p>Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the toddler's arm both now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. "Good luck...Harry Potter, Lily-Anne Potter." Dumbledore says.</p><p>The toddler was hugging the baby boy in her sleep. McGongall and Dumbledore went with Hagrid to have the children alone and the muggle family in the home would have two new members of their family.</p><p>About ten years later, but not fully, the home had taken in Harry and Lily-Anne, the baby and toddler, and raised them as their own children, but every once in a while, there would be difficulty with raising them, but no matter what would happen, the biological siblings bonded well as any other siblings would that were close and almost like friends. There was banging heard on the door from the other side as the two were currently sleeping in twin beds. Lily-Anne woke up slowly. She blinked as she heard their aunt shouting for them to get up. She looked at Harry. She may have been two years older than him but she was just as small as he was. And like him she actually didn't know about magic, though things happened like with Harry.</p><p>Dudley came running down the stairs. He stopped halfway then went up a bit again and jumped up and down. "Wake up, Potters! We're going to the zoo!" He shouts. He then ran back down again, laughing.</p><p>"Get up now!" Dudley's mother Petunia snapped to the children she raised. She seemed happier to see Dudley. "Aw, here comes the birthday boy~"</p><p>Harry grunted, he didn't like this life very much, but at least he had Lily-Anne. Dudley pushed both back in and kicked the door. He looked both happy and annoyed.</p><p>"Happy Birthday, son." Vernon says.</p><p>Lily-Anne helped Harry out, both wearing Dudley's old clothes. Her hair was tied up in pigtails. Petunia giggled with Dudley, they made the kid's birthday seem like the most important thing in the world to them. Dudley grinned.</p><p>Harry felt like a slave in this house, they couldn't even wear their own clothes. "Morning, Lily..." he greeted his sister once they got out of bed before meeting the family.</p><p>Lily-Anne hugged her brother, quickly going into the kitchen to do her morning chore.</p><p>"Try not to burn anything!" Petunia sharply told the two as they went to make breakfast.</p><p>"Yes, Aunt Petunia..." Harry forced himself to say.</p><p>Dudley smirked at the siblings.</p><p>"Yes, Aunt." Lily-Anne says softly.</p><p>"I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day!" Petunia smiled once Harry and Lily-Anne set to work.</p><p>"Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!" Vernon orders Harry.</p><p>"Yes, Uncle Vernon." Harry agreed, but he really didn't want to.</p><p>Dudley stood by his mother still. Lily-Anne served up the Dursley's breakfast, getting the only thing they were allowed to eat unless Petunia said different. She got them some bread and cheese. Petunia took Dudley into the family room to show the many presents that were for him.</p><p>Dudley stared at the pile of presents. "How many are there?" He asks.</p><p>Vernon grinned. "Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself." He says.</p><p>Dudley whirled around angrily. "Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!"</p><p>Vernon looked kind of unsure. "Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!" He tries to mollify.</p><p>Dudley was still shouting. "I don't care how big they are!" He shouts.</p><p>Lily-Anne gave Harry the bigger half of the bread and cheese. Petunia chuckled, seeming indifferent, she then told of the plans of going out to buy two new present to make up for the 'small amount of presents' there were now.</p><p>Harry sighed, he then smiled to Lily-Anne. "Oh, you didn't have to..."</p><p>Dudley came to sit and eat his big breakfast before he would open the presents. Vernon glanced at the Potter siblings.</p><p>Lily-Anne smiled softly. "You need it more." She smiles softly.</p><p>Harry smiled fondly to his sister as they continued to work for the family they lived with. Petunia smiled at Dudley, but she seemed to glare more to Lily-Anne and Harry, very harshly. They seemed to be treated worse, if not just like, Cinderella.</p><p>After everyone had eaten and got ready, they went out to the car. Dudley climbed into the back.</p><p>Vernon however shut the door on the Potter siblings. "I'm warning you now, children. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in." He tells them.</p><p>Lily-Anne nodded and got into the middle, looking down. She sat between the boys to stop them fighting.</p><p>"It will be a lovely day at the Zoo." Petunia giggled, doting on the boy she favored.</p><p>Harry didn't want to fight with Dudley, plus if he did, he would get in trouble, but he was very annoyed with the boy. He agreed to what his 'uncle' told him though. Vernon got into the car and drove off once everyone was in, and so he couldn't get into trouble, buckled in. Lily-Anne looked down at her lap, not going to meet the adults' eyes. Petunia hated her looking as she looked like her mother, and Vernon just followed his wife's example.</p><p>"I heard of a reptile house at the zoo these days," Petunia spoke up, hoping it would interest her son. "Would you like to see snakes up close, Dudley, dear?"</p><p>"Yes, if they move." Dudley smiled, smarmily.</p><p>"I'm sure they will, dear, they wouldn't be in the zoo if they didn't." Petunia chuckled.</p><p>Dudley smiled at his mother. Lily-Anne absently touched her shoulder. She had a snake mark there.</p><p>Harry looked up to Lily-Anne. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Lily-Anne looked at Harry. "Yeah." she says softly. She leaned against him gently.</p><p>Harry scooted back to his sister. He had to admit, even if things were bad with Vernon and Petunia, at least they had each other.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the zoo and headed to the reptile house. They looked into the enclosure that held a large Boa Constrictor.</p><p>"Make it move..." Dudley tells his father.</p><p>Vernon rapped on the glass. "Move." he tells it.</p><p>Dudley then repeated it harder. "Move!" He yells.</p><p>Lily-Anne looked at their cousin.</p><p>"He's asleep." Harry suggested, so they would stop bothering it, he and Lily-Anne knew better than to do such a thing.</p><p>"He's boring..." Dudley huffs. He then went off to see another enclosure.</p><p>Vernon went with his wife.</p><p>Lily-Anne gently put a hand on the glass, though quietly. "Sorry about him..." She apologizes to the snake. She loved animals and seeing them caged made her upset. She could only just handle zoos because the animals were looked after. She often talked to the animals, even if they didn't talk back, and they always seemed to listen and understand and she understood them.</p><p>"Yes..." Harry talked with the life-threatening snake as well, he felt the very same way, especially if the Potter siblings would be separated from each other in some cases. "He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you."</p><p>The snake then looked back and gave a nod to the two.</p><p>Harry looked a little surprised at that. "C-Can you hear us...?"</p><p>The snake seemed to nod at them.</p><p>"It's just... We've never talked to a snake before. Do you... I mean... Do you talk to people often?" Lily-Anne asks the snake softly.</p><p>The snake shook its head.</p><p>"You're from Burma, aren't you?" Harry asked, not caring if anyone was staring at them if they were talking to the snake. "Was it nice there? Do you miss your family?"</p><p>The snake turned its head to a sign for them to read, since it obviously couldn't talk right back like in normal conversation.</p><p>"I see, That's us as well. We never knew our parents, either." Lily-Anne says softly, putting an arm around Harry. However, she let out a yelp a few seconds later.</p><p>Dudley saw the snake moving and ran over, knocking the siblings down, and putting his hands up on the glass. "Mummy, Dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!" He shouts, looking , the glass disappeared as both Potters glared at Dudley, wanting revenge on the boy.</p><p>Dudley fell forwards. "Whoa! Ahh! Ahhh!" He yells as he fell into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water.</p><p>Lily-Anne looked at the snake her eyes wide, but not in fear. She was awed by the magnificent creature. She gently touched its head. The snake was coming out of the cage, looking rather menacing.</p><p>The snake came closer to the Potter siblings, it even actually spoke to them. "Thankssssss." it hissed.</p><p>Harry was a little surprised at the snake talking, but didn't be rude. "Anytime."</p><p>The snake gently nuzzled with Lily-Anne to calm her down and cease her fears of it.</p><p>"You're welcome," she smiles to the snake softly. She pet its head. "Go and escape before they catch you." she then says.</p><p>The snake agreed with her and slithered off, even if it freaked out a lot of the other zoo patrons.</p><p>Harry smiled as he then stood up. "Do you think we did a good thing, Lily?" he asked his sister once the snake went out to freedom.</p><p>"Yes." Lily-Anne smiled gently. She hugged him and looked at the enclosure.</p><p>Dudley got up and tried to get out. However, the glass was back. "Mum, Mummy!" He cries out in fear, pounding on the glass.</p><p>Petunia came by and wailed in alarm for her poor son. How on Earth did that happen? Harry put a hand over his mouth, he didn't want to laugh for Dudley's situation, even if it was hilarious to both of them, it might get them into trouble.</p><p>"Mum, help! Help me!" Dudley yelled.</p><p>Lily-Anne couldn't help but grin and giggle. It was just too funny at the moment. Vernon looked worried, looking for help, then noticed the siblings, his eyes narrowing. Harry followed his sister, unable to hold it in once she started.</p><p>"My darling boy, how did you get in there?" Petunia sounded devastated. She continued to scream until someone would come help him to end her endless worries of being an endangered mother.</p><p>Once Vernon looked over Lily-Anne's face paled and her grin faded. Vernon glared at the two marching them straight back to the car, then returning to help his wife and son. Petunia kept screaming, very worried and alarmed. Harry bowed his head, following Lily-Anne.</p><p>Once the two were in the car, Lily-Anne hugged him. "I'm sorry, Harry." she says softly. She stroked his scruffy brunette hair.</p><p>Vernon locked them in the car then went to help his wife and child. A zoo worker helped get Dudley out, giving them a blanket to warm the boy.</p><p>"It's okay..." Harry said softly, he was just glad he was with her, he would probably be a lot more miserable with this family if he didn't have her with him.</p><p>Lily-Anne held him close still. "If he tries to hurt you; I'll bite him." she quietly, but half-jokes.</p><p>Harry snorted, hugging Lily-Anne. Petunia was soothing her 'baby boy' and assuring him it was all right. Vernon escorted his wife and son back to the car. Dudley was whimpering and shivering.</p><p>"It'll be all right," Petunia told Dudley. "It'll be all right."</p><p>The ride home was tense and Vernon was visibly seething. Dudley entered the house first with his mother. Lily-Anne held Harry gently as they went in.</p><p>Vernon slammed the door and pushed both against the wall, grabbing their hair. Harry by the top of his hair and Lily-Anne's ponytail. "What happened?!" He growls at them.</p><p>"Ow, I don't know!" Harry grunted from the force. "One minute the glass was there and then it wasn't, it was like magic! We didn't do anything!"</p><p>"It was!" Lily-Anne cried out, in pain.</p><p>Vernon growled and shoved them both in the cuboard under the stairs, moving them by their hair. He shut the door and locked it. "There's no such thing as magic!" He tells them angrily and then shut the small vent there.</p><p>Harry flinched, then sighed once they were shut out. "I hate him... I hate them all..." he growled under his breath.</p><p>Lily-Anne hugged Harry, stroking his hair. "I don't like them either... But they're family" she says softly. She knew they'd have another bruise each.</p><p>"If they were really family, they wouldn't treat us like we were dirt..." Harry said sharply, but not angry with her, just with Vernon and Petunia's 'care' for them, treating Dudley like a prince.</p><p>"They just don't like us." Lily-Anne says softly. She let him get his anger out though, it wasn't healthy to keep it bottled up.</p><p>"I just wish there was some way to get us out of this place for good... Why don't we just run away, Lily? Just you and me..." Harry urged his older sister.</p><p>Lily-Anne actually thought it through. It would be good to get away. "We'll see Harry, we'll have to plan it carefully." she says softly.</p><p>"I understand..." Harry said softly to his sister, he only willingly did as she said and not their guardians.</p><p>Lily-Anne kissed his forehead. She sat down on one of their beds and hugged him. Harry sighed, he sat across from her. He just hoped their wishes would be answered about leaving this place. They had to stay in the cupboard all night.</p><p>The next day, an owl dropped two letters through the letterbox. Lily-Anne was toiling in the garden, forced to be by Petunia. Harry was called to fetch the mail, and in which he did. The happy Dursley family was joining together and having more fun than their niece and nephew as they didn't have a care in the world. Harry caught the mail and saw there was a letter addressed to him much to his shock. There was a letter for Lily too. Vernon was reading his paper. Dudley was ready for school. The family kept going about their business as Harry came with the mail, but he mostly focused on the one for him and Lily.</p><p>Vernon took the letters that Harry handed him then opened one. "Marge is ill... Ate a funny whelk." he says.</p><p>Lily-Anne came in, soil on her cheek and hands, and looking tired. Dudley looked at the Potters. Petuna hummed. Harry tried to avoid Dudley as he kept the secret letter close to himself. Lily-Anne was careful not to get dirt anywhere. She had to wait until Dudley went to school before she could go up and wash up. Vernon was reading his letter from his sister.</p><p>Dudley ran over to the Potters, grabbed the letters and ran back to Vernon. "Dad, look! Harry and Lily-Anne both have a letter!" He shouts.</p><p>"Give that back!" Harry snapped. "It's ours!"</p><p>Vernon laughed, hiding a bit of nervousness. "Yours? Who'd be writing to you two?" He asks, smirking though. He then looked at the letters and shared a look with his wife.</p><p>Dudley just looked confused. Lily-Anne didn't hold Harry as she was dirty and sweaty but stood as close to him as she could. The family gathered together as Harry glanced at the letter a little nervously. There appeared to be an owl with a letter flying by.</p><p>A little while later, while Dudley was at school, Lily-Anne came down from her bath, now wearing and old T-Shirt of Dudley's and pants that she had patched up many times. She looked at Vernon who rushed over and ripped the letters that had come for the two Potters. Vernon looked at her and pointed to the cupboard before going to fetch his drill and some wood to cover the letterbox. Petunia was getting ready for her husband to leave to the day, not really caring what Harry or Lily-Anne were up to. Harry found the best patched up clothes he could find that would fit them, he was very disgusted about living like this, but he had no choice. Vernon covered the letterbox.</p><p>Vernon was ready for work the next day and kissed his wife's cheek then noticed an owl on his car. "Shoo! Go on!" He orders, waving his arm to try and scare it away.</p><p>Lily-Anne was curled up under her covers. Harry finished his chores and went into his room with Lily-Anne, not even saying anything, but going onto the bed and burying himself in it. He didn't want to be rude to Lily, but he didn't feel like talking right now. Lily-Anne was in bed herself anyway. She felt a bit ill that day. There were more letters on the step. That evening, Uncle Vernon was sitting by the fire, burning the letters.</p><p>Harry tossed and turned slightly, he just wanted some way to get out of this awful place. Lily-Anne went into the living room, curious. Her eyes had slight bags under them, her skin clammy. She saw Uncle Vernon burning the letters. Vernon grinned evilly putting some more on. Petunia was on the telephone with a friend of hers, talking about how much 'trouble' Lily and Harry were, seeming to only be able say rude and hurtful things about them and praised Dudley.</p><p>Lily-Anne bit her lip and went back into the cupboard with Harry. "Are you alright?" She asks him so softly it was no more than a whisper.</p><p>Harry looked over to her. "I just really hate being here..." he mumbled, but he was audible to her.</p><p>"I know..." she whispers. She lay down next to him and held him gently, only in a family way though.</p><p>Harry sighed, he tried not to cry.</p><p>"We just have to be brave a little longer..." Lily-Anne whispers, her eyes closing.</p><p>A few more days passed and they were in the living room. Lily-Anne was cleaning the window pausing occasionally, hiding a tiny cough under the pretence of clearing her throat, but continuing quickly.</p><p>"Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?" Vernon asked, his appearance looking slightly frazzled from keeping the letters away from the two Potter children.</p><p>Dudley shrugged, eating a cookie.</p><p>While Lily-Anne was cleaning, Harry was carrying a tray of cookies for everyone else. "Because there's no post on Sunday?" he asked as he gave a cookie to his uncle.</p><p>Lily-Anne paused again looking surprised. She saw millions of owls outside.</p><p>"Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir." Vernon croons, for once being a little pleasant to Harry. "No sir, not one blasted, miserable-" he continued only to have a letter shoot out of the fireplace and zip across his face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.</p><p>Dudley was so scared he cried out. "AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!" He shouts and jumped on Petunia's lap.</p><p>Petunia and Vernon screamed together.</p><p>"Go away, ahh!" Vernon cried out, flapping the letters away.</p><p>Dudley was doing the same action. "What is it? Please tell me what's happening!" He shouts.</p><p>Lily-Anne grabbed a letter and took Harry's hand to take the boy to their cupboard. If he wanted to grab a letter too he could. Harry did in fact want a specific letter. Once it was grabbed, the two Potters went to their designated room. Hopefully they would get away with it without dire consequences from Vernon or Petunia.</p><p>Vernon jumped up as well. "Give me those! Give me those letters!" He shouts chasing them and grabbing them both.</p><p>Lily-Anne would've squealed but coughed instead.</p><p>Harry kept the letter close. "Run, Lily!" he called to her before going to their closet for their own safety.</p><p>Vernon had them both in his grip. He cried out as more letters attacked but didn't let them go. Lily-Anne kicked her legs a little, her mouth covered to cough. Dudley went to the kitchen doorway with his mother.</p><p>"They're our letters, let go of us!" Harry snarled.</p><p>Petunia held Dudley, a little frightened.</p><p>Finally angry enough to have snapped, Vernon announced what he planned to do. "That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!" He yells.</p><p>Lily-Anne managed to stop coughing. "No!" She gasps.</p><p>Dudley looked at his father in horror. "Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!" He asks his mother.</p><p>Harry nearly cried as he clutched the letter. Vernon got them all out, getting them into the car, packing things for them all. He made sure the two had no letters before he got into the car with his family and the siblings and drove off. Lily-Anne leaned against Harry a little. Dudley looked scared of his father a little. Harry leaned against Lily too, getting comfortable as they were just leaving. All because of some letters. This family was really insane, was it not?</p><p>Vernon drove them for miles and hours. He brought them food on the way, making sure the siblings didn't have chance to escape though. He took them to a place and after a short boat ride they were on a small rock island. The house there wasn't very warm and only had 1 bedroom. Dudley got to have the sofa. Lily-Anne had slept most of the way, and even on the dusty floor was dozing. She hugged to Harry, not fully asleep. After all, soon he would be 11 and she 13. Harry shivered a little, but he somehow managed to get himself to sleep, this was a lot more uncomfortable than the closet.</p><p>Lily-Anne glanced at Dudley's watch, carefully drawing a cake in the dust with their names on it. When the watched beeped midnight she gently woke Harry. "Happy birthday Harry... Let's make a wish." she whispers, showing him the 'cake'.</p><p>Harry snorted, his eyes were slightly squinty, but he rubbed them and put his glasses on. "Hm?" he looked at the cake and then smiled. He then took a deep breath and 'blew the candles out'. Suddenly, the door thumped, making him jump. "Lily, wh-what was that?"</p><p>"I-I don't know... Go hide." she whispers to Harry. She stood up with a sneeze.</p><p>The door was banged on again and Dudley stood up. Vernon came down holding a shotgun. Harry muttered out a 'gesundheit' to her before hiding. What was happening? The door fell to the floor with a bang and Lily-Anne looked wide-eyed at the figure in the doorway.</p>
