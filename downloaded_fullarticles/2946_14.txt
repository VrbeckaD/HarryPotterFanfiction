    <h2 align="center">Chapter One:  The Second Birthday Gift</h2><h3 align="center">Welcome to <i><u>The Harem Game</u></i>, Harry</h3><h4 align="center">Wednesday, July 31<sup>st</sup>, 1991.</h4><p><br/>
</p><p>Harry returned to his new room at Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, after his very first foray into the wizarding world since the Halloween after his first birthday.  He brought along a trunk full of school supplies with his new, female (Hagrid told him), snowy owl.  Thankfully, the trunk had a feather light charm cast upon it, courtesy of the trunk salesman.  The charm might only last a day, but that was sufficient.  He’d have never made it home with his supplies, otherwise.  He named his owl Hedwig from a name he saw in his textbook, <em>A History of Magic</em>, which he had skimmed during his train ride home.  And he was glad the Dursleys had not yet returned from the shack off the coast.  He figured it might take them a day or two, since Hagrid took the dingy the Dursleys had used to get to the lonely hut.</p><p>Harry left his trunk at the bottom of the stairs and took Hedwig’s cage into his new room.  He was surprised to see a barn owl, with a distinctive white tuft of feathers over the eyes, sitting on his desk.  Tied to the owl’s leg was a gaily wrapped package.  The owl hooted at Harry impatiently.  After a moment or three, Harry untied the package from the owl, who then leapt out the open window and disappeared into the evening.  He was sure that the window had been closed and latched by his uncle when they left the house in order to avoid his Hogwarts letters, so he wondered how the owl opened the window.  </p><p>Harry and Hedwig shared a look with each other, and both shrugged.  Harry finished setting up Hedwig’s cage, using the birdcage stand for the bird Dudley got on one of his birthdays, and then subsequently traded the bird away.  He went back downstairs to retrieve his trunk and then sat on his hand-me-down bed.  It was a bed that was too small for an oversized eleven year old (Dudley wanted a bed that could hold three of himself), but certainly sufficiently large enough for an undersized eleven year old wizard.  Harry was happy to have a bed that he didn’t have to curl up into a ball to fit upon, nor worry about hitting his head if he sat up too quickly.  And the lack of spiders was a plus, not that he minded spiders.  He picked up the package and was wondering what was in it, when realized what it was. It was a birthday gift.  He had seen Dudley get them year after year, but he had never had one before.  His first birthday gift was from Hagrid, and that was Hedwig.  However, Hedwig had not been given to him as a gift to unwrap.  He was doubly glad the Dursleys were not around, as he was unsure how they would react to him receiving a gift, as that event had never occurred before (other than the odd toothpick, broken hanger, or old moldy sock).  There on top was a small card that read ‘Happy Eleventh Birthday’.</p><p>Harry marveled at the concept that someone sent him a gift.  But who?  And why now, and not previously in his life?  Harry carefully unwrapped the present, and neatly folded the foil wrapping and placed it in the drawer of the slightly lopsided ‘too small for Dudley’ writing desk.  He examined his gift, which was a book covered in soft black leather about six inches tall and four inches wide, with a spine that was maybe three quarters of inch thick.  There was a thin emerald green ribbon to use as a book mark hanging from within the middle of the book.  On the cover in a fancy gold script was the title, <em>The Harem Game</em>.  Harry thought that was an unusual title and as he opened the cover of the book, a piece of parchment fell out.  Harry picked up and unfolded the parchment.</p>
<ul>
<ul>

<p>Happy Birthday, Mr. Potter!</p>

<p>We have never met, and though I wish we could, the rules of the game prevent that from happening.  You have some particularly strong magic warding you that prevented me (or anyone else I’d wager) from sending you mail.  I suspect the wards have an exception to permit letters from Hogwarts through, and that has allowed me to reach you, as I have had to disguise my gift as a piece of school mail.  Assuming, of course, that this package actually does reach you.</p>

<p>Your eleventh birthday is probably perfect time to receive this gift, as it is the age when the wizarding world no long considers you to be a child, but does not yet consider you to be an adult.  Those awkward years from age eleven to seventeen, where to you learn about your magic and how to control and use it.</p>

<p>I have searched for a long time to find someone worthy of being the successor to the book.  I believe you will do nicely.  Enjoy your gift, and your time in school.  May the times you live in be interesting ones.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>A hopeful friend.</p>
</ul>
</ul><p>“Hopeful friend?  Does that mean they are hopeful and a friend, or that they are hopeful that they will be a friend?” Harry mused to himself. “And isn’t that last bit considered a curse in some cultures?  Wait… There is magic preventing me from getting mail?  Do my aunt and uncle know about that?  Is that why they were so surprised that day I got the first letter?  Or was it that they just hoped my magic had been stamped out of me?”</p><p>Harry then folded the parchment back up, and returned his attention to the book.  He opened the cover to find only one available page, marked by the green bookmark, with a tidy and flowing script:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>

<p>Welcome to the Harem Game.</p>

<p>A game of innocence and intrigue, ardor and adventure, courting and conquests, libido and lust, and victory through variety!</p>
</ul>
      </ul><p>This was followed by a circle about the size of a two pence coin.  The script then continued:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>

<p>Prick the center of your right thumb with a sharp object and press your right thumb against the page in the circle above to learn more about the game of a lifetime!</p>
</ul>
      </ul><p>There was nothing else written on the page, whilst the book appeared to have multiple pages, all the pages seemed stuck together so that only the one page was available.  No matter what he tried, he could not get the book to open to any of the other pages.  Harry thought about that.  Was this normal for wizard books?  None of his textbooks seemed to require anything like this or behave in this manner.  After shrugging to himself, he found a needle in his school supplies, and pricked his right thumb, letting the blood well up a bit before he pressed the bloodied thumb against the page within the specified circle.  Harry waited.</p><p>And waited.  </p><p>Perhaps this was a joke.  He tried to pull his thumb away from the page, only to find he could not do so.  Just as he was beginning to panic, the book began to glow a lovely soothing blue color that really did nothing to sooth a nearly panicked eleven year old.  Then blue color turned golden, and the book fell from his thumb.  When Harry bent to retrieve the book from where it fell, he noted the title on the cover had changed from <em>The Harem Game</em> to <em>Harry’s Harem Game</em>.</p><p>After retrieving the book and cautiously opening it again, Harry noticed that the first page had changed as well (and that there were more than one page available now), and what was written was in the same tidy and flowing script.</p>

</ul>
      </ul><p>Harry had no idea if most of that information was correct or not.  He had heard of the planets and the zodiac constellations, other than that the data was meaningless to him.  Until today, he didn’t even know he had appellations (other than that last one), so he wasn’t even sure if any of those were correct either.  He didn’t even know that the scar on his head was runic, and only learned it was caused by a curse earlier that day, rather than a car crash.  He didn’t even know that Hedwig was his familiar.  Then he realized something.  He and Hedwig had the same birthday!  He looked up to Hedwig and said, “Happy Birthday, Hedwig.  I’ll have to get you a present next year.  This year you’ll have to make do with our familiar bond and the new home.”  Hedwig happily chirped back at Harry.</p><p>Harry looked back at the book.  Since all the rest of the data was true as far he knew, he tapped the green circle.</p><p>The page turned and Harry was given the rules of the game.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>

<p><u><em>Rules of Harry’s Harem Game</em></u></p>

<p>All games need rules, and Harry’s Harem Game is no exception.  So, with no further ado, here are the basic rules of your game!  </p>
<ul>

<p>1)	<u>Rule of Secrecy</u>:  You will not to discuss the details of the game with anyone.  The only exceptions are soul mates, or familiars, if any, and only when absolute privacy can be guaranteed. (See appendix ‘Bonds and Bondage’, for more information.)<br/>
Please Note:  This rule is contractually enforced. (See appendix ‘Blood Contracts and Magical Enforcements’.)<br/>
2)	<u>Rule of Active Participation</u>:  You must attempt a minimum of one quest a month.  Failure to attempt the minimum quests will result in penalties.  (See appendix ‘Game Penalties Caused by Failure to Play’ for further information.)  Failing an attempted quest is not the same as failing to attempt a quest.  The more quests you attempt, the more rewards you can reap!  Unless stated otherwise by the quest, there are no penalties for failing to complete a quest.<br/>
You must examine or access this book at least twice a week in order to keep up to date with progress within the game.  (See appendix ‘Game Penalties and The Price of Ignorance’, for further information.)<br/>
3)	<u>Rule of Fair Play</u>:  Cheating is prohibited.  (See appendix ‘Game Penalties for Cheaters, Deadbeats and Lowlife Scum’ for further information.)<br/>
Please Note: Fair play is contractually enforced (See appendix ‘Blood Contracts and Magical Enforcements’.)<br/>
4)	<u>Rule of Inventive Solutions</u>: Creative Interpretation of Rules and Goals is encouraged!  Just because some resolution was unforeseen when the game was created, doesn’t mean that the resolution breaks the rules! (See appendix ‘Interpretation of the Rules’, and appendix ‘Challenging the Rules’, for more information.)<br/>
5)	<u>Rule of Quest Compliance</u>:  Breaking the rules of a quest you have accepted will result in a penalty.  Each rule violation has a different penalty, and repeating violations will have increasingly harsher penalties.  (See appendix ‘Rules Violations and You’, for more information.)  The rules of the game are somewhat fluid, given that undertaking quests can apply temporary rules, and that with certain rewards, you may become exempt from other rules as play proceeds.</p>
</ul>

<p>As you play you will earn rewards and experience, as well as accumulate milestones.  As you progress, you will be able to choose some of your rewards, while other rewards are predetermined.  Some choices negate the ability to make other choices later, or will delay when a choice becomes available (or available again), so choose carefully! (See the chapter ‘Harry’s Tutorial’, for more information on how to make choices.)</p>

<p>If you understand these rules and are ready for the tutorial, tap the green circle at the bottom of the page with your right index finger.  Doing so will finish registering you as the next player of <em>Harry’s Harem Game</em> and enact a binding magical contract.</p>

<p>If you disagree with these rules and do not wish to play the game, tap the red circle at the bottom of the page with your left index finger.  Doing so will cancel your player application, and send the game along to the next eligible player.</p>
</ul>
</ul><p>“Wow,” whispered Harry, “Magical books can sure pack a lot of information into a small space.”  Harry mulled it over, and was about to tap the green circle when he remembered something his uncle was frequently telling his aunt when handymen were required around the house, “Always read the fine print on any contract before signing it.  That’s where the real costs are hidden.”  As much as he loathed his uncle, Harry remembered that Vernon had been a salesman, and a salesman’s livelihood came from getting contracts signed.  So Harry delved into trying to find the fine print, or at least the appendices that were mentioned.</p><p>The appendices were very numerous, and hugely disorganized. He searched through the pages for a while, but soon came to realize how impossible it would be to stumble across the information he needed when the book appeared to have thousands of pages.  Harry looked at the front of the table of contents.  Frustratingly, there wasn’t a table of contents.  Harry then went to the back of the book to look for an index.   </p><p>Well, Harry found an index.  However it was a book in and of itself.  The good news for Harry was that the first chapter of the index was titled ‘How to Navigate the Index’.  "Brilliant… this is really useful to know.  You’d think they would have made this easier to find."  After re-reading the navigation instructions, he grabbed the end of the emerald ribbon bookmark and recited “Show to me the index entry for the fine print related to the player application contract.”</p><p>The book pulled out of his hands (except for the end of the ribbon he was holding) and it flipped through several pages before coming back to rest in his hands, open to the index page he requested.</p><p>“There sure are a lot of entries under the heading fine print.  Um… There it is, Fine Print for the Initial Player Contract.”  Harry grasped the book mark and said, “Show me page seven-hundred eighty-three thousand, four hundred twenty-one.”  The book then turned itself the requested page.</p><p>A page that was completely blank aside from the page number. Harry borrowed his uncle’s magnifying glass and started looking at the contract page, when that revealed nothing.  Then he recalled the symbol of a moon next to the index entry, and that the instructions for the index indicated that some sections of the book required specific conditions be met in order to view the information.  He hoped that he didn’t need a full moon, as that was nearly a week ago.</p><p>He took the book into the back yard, and held it open under the moon light.  He could see some faint lines that he didn’t see before.  He took out the borrowed magnifying glass and peered at the page carefully.  That was it… the fine print!   The print was becoming stronger as the moon rose higher in the sky.  Harry was really wishing the moon was completely full, but equally glad that the sky that night was mostly clear.  He went back inside to go grab a scribbling pad and a biro, then came back to start writing down what he could read.  The words followed the edges of the page of the circling in tighter and tighter towards the center.</p>

  <ul>

<p>Initial Player Application Contract Stipulations:</p>

<p>By agreeing to participate in the <em>Harem Game</em>, or <em>Harry’s Harem Game</em> (a.k.a.: the Game), you (a.k.a.: the Player) agree to the following stipulations:<br/>
1.	The Player agrees to allow the Game to affect his/her life and potentially interfere with his/her fate/destiny, if any.<br/>
2.	The Player agrees that any mishaps, misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and mistakes that occur while playing the Game are all the Player’s responsibility to deal with, regardless of who is actually culpable.<br/>
3.	The Player agrees that when the Game ends, any backlash (magical, spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational or fate-related) from playing the Game are the Player’s responsibility.<br/>
4.	The Player agrees that any relationships resulting from the Game are the Player’s responsibility to maintain or correct when the Game is over.<br/>
5.	The Player agrees that it is possible for the Player to die while playing the Game, and accepts that as a possible consequence of playing game.<br/>
6.	The Player agrees to accept that the Game’s duration is measured in years, and that the Player might not be able to complete the Game before expiring of natural or unnatural causes.<br/>
7.	The Player agrees to accept the consequences for all actions and choices made by the Player while playing the Game.<br/>
8.	The Player agrees to not hold the creator (living or dead) of the Game responsible, accountable or in any way liable for any harm (physical, emotional, magical, psychological, spiritual, etc.), real or imagined, that might occur while playing the Game.<br/>
9.	The Player of the Game agrees to abide by the rules of the Game for the duration that the Game is played.<br/>
10.	The Player agrees to forfeit the life he would lead as a non-player by playing the Game.  (Refer to stipulation one.)  Once game play stops, there is no guarantee that the forfeited life can be recovered or will even remain in existence.<br/>
11.	The Player agrees that any disputes regarding the rules or penalties applied while playing the Game will be arbitrated the by Avatar of Justice, or their designee, as presented by the Game (see appendix ‘Invoking Arbitration’).<br/>
12.	By tapping the green circle, the Player agrees to a binding magical contract (using his/her blood that was submitted to start the player application to create the binding) between the Player and the Game (See appendix ‘Blood Contracts and Magical Enforcement’).  Breaking of the contract will result in the forfeiture of magic on the part of the party responsible for the violation of the contract.  The violator of the contract will be given an opportunity to atone for the violation before the contract’s violation clause is enforced.  Any mediation required for contract violation will be handled by the Avatar of Justice, or their designee.<br/>
13.	The Player agrees that all mediation performed by the Avatar of Justice, or their designee, will be binding within the terms of the magical contract and rules of the Game.<br/>
14.	By agreeing to play the Game, the Player is forfeiting a portion of their freedom of choice.  This is a consequence of choosing the play the Game and agreeing to participate in quests.<br/>
</p>
<ul>a.	As this is a voluntary forfeiture on the part of the Player, the Player must be age eleven or older in order to give their consent and their magic core must be stable enough to accept the contract.<br/>
b.	If those two conditions do not exist when the Player taps the Green circle, the Game will inform the player of the inability to form the contract.<br/>
c.	Should the Game inform the Player of a contract instability, the player will be given the option to be approached by the Game in one year to try and form a contract again, or given the option to pass on playing the game as if the Player had declined (tapped the red circle).</ul>
<br/>
15.	Should the Player decline to play the Game, knowledge of the Game will be removed from the Player’s memory, and the Game will be forwarded to the next eligible and available player (see appendix ‘Short Term Obliviations and You’, and appendix ‘Long Term Obliviations and Their Consequences’).<br/>
16.	Should the Player agree to play the game, all fore-knowledge of the game gained through investigation of the book will be removed from the player’s memory in order to enforce fair play.<br/>
17.	By agreeing to these stipulations, the player agrees to abide by the rules of the game as they are written.</ul>
      </ul><p>Harry was very glad he decided to write this out on a scribbling pad, as he really wanted some time to think about the stipulations.  He didn’t want to have to be dependent up on moonlight being available in order read this again, not to mention that the swirling pattern of the text in the book made it easy to misread something.  Harry double checked what he had written, revising it as he went to correct errors from his first reading.</p><p>Harry returned to the house and read some of the appendices well into the night.</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><h3> <strong>NOTES: </strong>
</h3><p><br/>
</p><p>This took me about two and half years to write, as a challenge to myself to actually write a story.  I followed the challenge rules loosely.</p><p>   <strong>Challenge Requirements:</strong></p><p>(Streamlined, not verbatim)</p><p>When Harry discovers that he is a wizard, someone sends him a strange book entitled "The Harem Game". Curious Harry opens the book and learns that now his life has become a game, that he is the main character and that one of his main goal is to have a harem of willing women. The book contains all the information and rules that Harry must know but they can be presumed as:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>-	Competences, skills and stats can be created and augmented by doing actions. Some actions allow deletion of some defaults.<br/>
-	Sometimes quests will appear, if these quests are completed, experience is gained.<br/>
-	With enough experience you level up with each level you gain some points that allow you to enhance your stats or to buy some perks (some perks have conditions).<br/>
-	The best way to win experience is to have lot of sex with lots of women. Sometimes this will result by the gain of a bonus in stats, competences, skills, perks or even more experience.  Examples of these moments are:<br/>
<ul><ul>o	first time with a girl;<br/>
o	a girl becomes a regular lover;<br/>
o	a girl becomes addicted to you;<br/>
o	a girl worships you and is willing to become your sex-slave/concubine/harem member;<br/>
o	or you have won an achievement (X virginities taken, have sex X times, have anal/oral sex X times ...).</ul></ul>
-	Harry doesn't know where this book came but he will profit from and will abuse this game.</ul>
</ul><p>Other details:<br/>
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>-	Harry gains an increase in libido, stamina, and sexual endurance with each new girl.<br/>
-	No girl younger than 5 years of Harry’s age or 15 years older than him. This rule is principally for his teen and young adult years.  If you manage to write a fic that goes into his adult years then, if a girl is at least 15 year old and willing, Harry can add her to his harem.<br/>
-	Harry must gain a perk that allow him, his linked familiars, and his bonded harem to take a animal form, a human form and a mix form.<br/>
-	Harry must gain a very good reputation with the muggle girls of his neighborhood but at maximum 2 muggle girls can be in his harem.<br/>
-	Gabrielle is 4 year younger that Harry.<br/>
-	You can use some girls from other fandoms but later in the story.<br/>
-	Harry must find a way to destroy his horcrux parasite without be killed.</ul>

Throughout this story I copied some text and paraphrased other text from the works of J. K. Rowling.  I cited these instances poorly (read not at all) so this is my citation.</p>
