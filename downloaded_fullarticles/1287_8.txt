    <p>        After a long battle to get his inheritance from his crazy family after his sadistic bitch of a mother’s death, Sirius was elated. With that money in addition to the money his sweet uncle Alphard left him, he could finally realize his dream of opening a shelter for homeless lgbtq youth in Manhattan. The only thing tripping him up was some legal red tape and some pushback from the neighborhood of the property he bought to house the shelter. Just because it had previously been a church, the neighbors seemed to think it was “indecent” and “inappropriate” to house children who had been cast off by their parents or run away to escape abuse. Sirius thought their distaste probably also had something to do with the fact that property values in the area were insanely high and his plan might knock the surrounding houses down a couple hundred thousand dollars on the market, but so what? That same church used to be used for conversion therapy and the people who lived in the area did nothing to stop it. Frankly, in his opinion, if everyone lost money they didn’t even need in order to serve the greater good, that was just their karma catching up with them.<br/>
        A great nonprofit law firm in the area had agreed to take up his case as well as helping him get into contact with several organizations that could keep the shelter running after he died. He had enough money to keep the place running for about the next sixty years on his own, maybe longer with some prudent investing, but he wanted to be as sure as possible that even after he died, no child in his city would have to spend the night on the street, cold, alone, and unprotected just because they had the misfortune of being born into a family like the one he’d been saddled with.<br/>
        “Ah, you must be Mr. Black!” said a handsome man with blinding teeth, reaching out to shake his hand “I’m Gilderoy. I believe you spoke with my secretary on the phone. I’m one of two lawyers working your case. Let’s get started, shall we?” he said with a wink<br/>
Sirius was overcome with the uneasy feeling he had seen this man before. Shaking his hand he said,”Sounds great! Will I be meeting the other lawyer on my case today? I’d like to get everything started as quickly as possible if you don’t mind Mr... I’m sorry, I don’t think I caught your last name.”<br/>
Gilderoy’s smile faltered<br/>
“Lockhart. Gilderoy Lockhart. I believe our families used to run in the same circles. I’m actually not sure if he’s in today, he may be out doing some work on another project I’m spearheading.”<br/>
<em>Ah, so that’s what it was</em>, he thought. Gilderoy Lockhart was from a family of new money social climbers his parents absolutely despised. Sirius had only ever seen him peripherally as he was sneaking out of stuffy galas his mother forced him to go to.<br/>
He lead Sirius into his office and pulled out a stack of papers thicker than his arm and set them down on the desk. “Naturally most of what we’ll be having you do is just signing things, waivers and things like that, we’ll handle the rest. If you’ll get started on this stack I’ll go and check up on my colleague who’s handling the easier parts of your case.” Gilderoy practically ran out of the room as Sirius settled in for a long read.<br/>
        It took all of ten minutes for him to realize he was signing papers for some sort of shelter corporation in the Bahamas rather than anything to do with the homeless shelter. He poked his head out the door to try to get some help and was immediately greeted by the loudest lime green pantsuit he had ever seen in his whole life. He was struck by the notion that if he lived in a post-apocalyptic hellscape where a zombie P. T. Barnum had come back and was advertising a freak show comprised mostly of loose organs that had mutated and become sentient and learned to jump through rings on their own, even he would never wear something so heinously tacky and loud. So loud, in fact, that it took Sirius a minute to realize that the person in the pantsuit was actually talking to him.<br/>
“...Mr. Black, are you alright?”<br/>
“Um... Yeah... where did Mr. Lockhart get to? I need his help with a couple of these forms.”<br/>
The young lady in the abomination against nature winced. “He actually just ran out for the day. Family emergency I think. I can help you with those though.” She walked into the office, took one glance at the stack of papers, picked them all up, and dropped them in the trash can. She then turned to the filing cabinets behind her, opened one, and pulled out a much slimmer stack. “Mr. Lockhart must have been... confused. This is all you actually need to sign for this project.” She said, very obviously exasperated and not trying very hard to hide it. “This just gives us power of attorney in this matter and allows us to advocate on your behalf with the city, the local homeowners association, and the licensing board.” “Thank you. So do you know if I’ll be meeting the other lawyer working my case today?”<br/>
        She sat down across from him and started typing away at Gilderoy’s computer. “It looks like he’s out of office for most of today at the embassy, but he has a meeting here in about...” she glanced down to her wrist ”... twenty minutes. You’re only scheduled to sign some things today so we can get the ball rolling on this stuff, but I bet if we pop in now you could meet him before his other clients get here.” She stood up and gestured for him to follow. Sirius was just starting to wonder what emergency Gilderoy had run out of the office to deal with when they reached the door. The girl rapped twice and opened the door a crack “Hey R-“<br/>
“Oh, Dora! Thank goodness, exactly who I needed! Could you possibly call Mrs. Stevenson and reschedule with her for tomorrow? I’m this close to reaching a deal with the ambassador for those visas but I have to get back down there in the next five minutes because he has an appointment at four and I only came back because I grabbed the wrong bag on my way out this morning.”<br/>
       Sirius felt his blood freeze in his veins. That voice. That voice he would know anywhere. He felt his hand shake as he reached for the door and pushed it open. A flurry of tawny and charcoal was fluttering around behind the desk, gathering loose papers from stacks so numerous and tall they seemed to create new walls around the room. Battlements of manila folders being shuffled around threatened to fall over and take the whole office down with them.<br/>
“Remus.”<br/>
Hazel eyes flashed around to meet his and the whirlwind froze.<br/>
“Sirius.”<br/>
The lime blur apparently called Dora stepped into the room. “Oh good, you’ve met! Remus, this is that new client who’s starting the shelter in the old cathedral.”<br/>
Remus’ face was expressionless. His posture was stiff and polite. He picked up one last folder, slid it into his attaché case, and turned to Dora.<br/>
“Lovely. Like I said, could you please reschedule that meeting for me? I really do have to get going. Mr. Black, I believe we have an official meeting on Wednesday? I’ll see you then.” His voice was even and his steps were leisurely as he stepped around Dora, past Sirius, and walked out the front door of the office without a glance back.<br/>
“Shit.” Sirius sank into the chair in front of the desk, thumped his head down on top of it, and waited to wake up from his own personal hell.<br/>
“What the hell just happened there?” Dora said from behind him.<br/>
“Signing those papers was all I had to do today right?”<br/>
“Yeah.”<br/>
“Cool. I’m going to get a drink.”<br/>
“...Can I come?”<br/>
“Don’t you have work?”<br/>
“Not after this phone call.”<br/>
“...Alright. Show me the best bar in this neighborhood and I’ll tell you about the night my life fell apart.”</p>
