Too rough, too intense, too angry.</p><p align="justify">Not that it’s not great now. It really is. But not enough.</p><p align="justify">It’s just passion and anger and andrenalin. That’s why it’s happening over and over. That’s why he keeps coming back.</p><p align="justify"><br/>
</p><p align="justify">I just wish he loved me. Like I love him. Or more.</p><p align="justify">I wish it was me he wanted. Not just the body.</p><p align="justify">I wish we talked about more than just sex.</p><p align="justify">I wish he stayed the nights. I wish I did.</p><p align="justify">I wish I was happy. I am not. I am angry, frustrated and unsatisfied with my life.</p><p align="justify">I wish I made him happy. I wish I was enough for him.</p><p align="justify">I wish we made love. Not just fuck.</p><p align="justify">I wish it was easy.</p><p align="justify">I wish I was someone else. Maybe then…</p><p align="justify">I wish he was someone else. Maybe then I would be happy.</p><p align="justify">I wish I let him go. Leave and don’t look back.</p><p align="justify">I wish I was strong.</p><p align="justify">I wish he was happy.</p><p align="justify">I wish…</p><p align="justify"><br/>
</p><p align="justify">He is lying next to me now, his breaths getting slower. His black hair is a mess against the pillows.</p><p align="justify">He looks content. He is looking at me. I probably look just as satisfied.</p><p align="justify">He kisses me and I kiss him back. Like I always do. I can’t imagine I wouldn’t.</p><p align="justify">I move to lay on top of him. I want him again. I want him to stay. Just for few more moments.</p><p align="justify">I feel him inside of me. We move together and it’s as close to heaven as it can get. I can feel his heart under my palm.</p><p align="justify">At times like these I pretend it’s love. The way he touches me, the way he sounds, the way he kisses me.</p><p align="justify">So I make him stay a little longer.</p><p align="justify">I wish he stayed forever.</p></div>
