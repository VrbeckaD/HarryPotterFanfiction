    <p>When Hermione Granger came home from her fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, her Mother, Cheryl, was conflicted. Hermione had come home scared. She had to tried to hide it from her parents, and she may have fooled her father, but Cheryl could see through her mask. When prodded, Hermione admitted that the evil man who had dominated the Wizarding World fifteen years ago was back. She wanted to contact Hermione's Uncle, Cheryl's little brother, John. She hadn't seen him in person since Hermione was three, though he had sporadically picked Hermione up from school to spend time with her before Hogwarts. And she knew they had met up a few times in Hogsmeade. Cheryl and John though, had not even spoken on the phone since little Astra's death, two years ago. John was a part of that World, though technically their entire Family was.</p><p>The Constantine clan was descended from what was originally a Magical Line going back thousands of years, though it had turned Squib a while back. John had been the first in their family to attend Hogwarts in two hundred years. He had graduated almost twenty years ago, and last Cheryl had heard, had become a High Warlock of Magic, which was the equivalent of having a PhD in Magic. She was going to call him, she decided, they needed to talk. </p><p>She took a deep breath and picked up the phone, dialing John's number.</p><p>" 'ello?" Said the voice on the phone, gruffly.</p><p>"Johnny. It's Cheryl."</p><p>"What's wrong? Is Mia okay?" He said quickly.</p><p>"Hermione's fine. She's upset though. Apparently a fellow student was murdered."</p><p>"Yeah, I heard. Awful business, that. She's okay, though?"</p><p>"She's a bit traumatized. I'm worried about her being alone in the Wizarding World. I was apprehensive about it before, but now..." </p><p>"You want me to take Custody of her in the Wizarding World as her Magical Guardian, don't you?" Asked John.</p><p>"If it's not too much to ask. You're part of that world and we're not. I know how the Wizarding World looks down on Squibs and Muggles. Which is what Hermione is a child of." Explained Cheryl. </p><p>"And I'm a High Warlock and Head of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Constantine."</p><p>"Yes." Sighed Cheryl, "John, please. You can protect her in that world better than we can. I know about You-Know-Who. She's your niece."</p><p>"Oh, stop with the begging, alright? As if I was ever going to say no." Scoffed John, "Like you said, she's family. And besides, I love the little devil. Of course I'll take care of her in the Wizarding World, if you trust me with her after Astra."</p><p>"Of course I trust you, John. I know Astra's death was an accident. And I know you'd do anything you could to fix it. You're the one who won't forgive yourself." Said Cheryl, gently.</p><p>"I'll never forgive myself. Ever. That girls soul is forever damned because of something I did and there's nothing I can do to fix it. I will never let that happen again, especially to Mia."</p><p>"Thank you, Johnny. There's something else. Hermione, she says that He's back. That he came back from the dead somehow." Said Cheryl.</p><p>"So. That's what I felt in June." Said John.</p><p>"You felt something?"</p><p>"I'm a Master of the Dark Arts as well as a Master of Defense Against the Dark Arts. I could feel the Magic. Dark Magic, that. Evil. Some of the Evilest I've ever felt. Didn't know what it was, though. They used her friend, didn't they? The Potter boy."</p><p>"How did you know that? Hermione said they used his blood to bring him back."</p><p>"There are only a few Rituals to bring someone back from the dead. Using the blood of an enemy is one of them."</p><p>Cheryl shivered. They used a fourteen year old boy to bring back the man who had murdered his parents. That poor child. She hoped he had someone to talk to about it. He was probably terribly traumatized. </p><p>"Did you know Harry's parents, Johnny?"</p><p>"Yeah. They were two years behind me at Hogwarts. But we all fought together during the War. I was, uh, close with James' best friend Sirius. James is Harry's father, Sirius was Harry's godfather." John explained.</p><p>"Close, John? You mean you dated him."</p><p>"I loved him, Cheryl." He said softly. "And then he supposedly betrayed Harry's parents to the Old Snake himself. He was arrested and sent to Azkaban." </p><p>"Supposedly?" Asked Cheryl.</p><p>"Personally, I never believed Sirius would do such a thing. He loved James and Lily, and he lived for Harry. After Harry was born and James and Lily had to go in to hiding, he fought the Death Eaters twice as hard as any other person, even old Mad-Eye himself."</p><p>"Hermione said something while writing a letter to Harry about a year ago. I don't think she realized she was muttering out loud. She was saying something about 'Sirius' and 'catching Pettigrew.'"</p><p>"Pettigrew. Of course, that fucking rat." Growled John. "I'll bet you anything that Pettigrew betrayed the Potters and set up Sirius for the crime. That man always rubbed me the wrong way but I could never find anything on him."</p><p>"Mother always used to tell me to trust my gut instincts because it's the Constantine Family Magic."</p><p>"Well I didn't know that now, did I?" Snapped John.</p><p>"Sorry, John. I spoke without thinking. I didn't mean to bring her up."</p><p>"It's okay, Cheryl. You're just lucky you got to know her. I thought Sirius was innocent, I should have said something. He's rotten in Azkaban for years because I felt fucking betrayed." </p><p>"It's not your fault she died, Johnny. No matter what Father said. And you can't blame yourself for Sirius. It was a War." </p><p>"Yeah well, it's just another weight on my conscience. You want me to come and stay 'till this is all over, don't you?"</p><p>"If it's not too much to ask, Johnny." She said nervously. "I need Hermione to live through this War. Even if Ethan and I don't. I can read the signs Johnny, I followed the First War. With Him back, there will be another war, whether we like it or not. And Hermione will want to fight. There will be no stopping her. You-Know-Who will target Harry just for living, and Hermione will fight for him." </p><p>"I have my Masteries in both Defense and the Dark Arts. I can train them both, Cheryl. I'll do my best to make sure they survive. Of course, I'll stay in England until this is all over. I can be there by tomorrow."</p><p>"Sounds good. Thank you, Johnny. This means everything to me." Cheryl let out a breath of relief.</p><p>"Of course. Anything for family. Say, does Mia know where Harry lives? I need to check up on him. It's the least I could do for James, Lily, and Sirius." Asked John.</p><p>"Yes, I believe she knows where he lives. You can ask her when you get here. I do love you, little brother."</p><p>"I love you too, sister. I'll see you tomorrow then."</p><p>"Tomorrow. Bye."</p><p>Cheryl hung up the phone and went to tell Hermione that she was spending the summer with her favorite uncle, who would be training her and Harry for War.</p><p>----</p><p>Captain Sara Lance of the Waverider was wandering the ship when she noticed a familiar British blonde sneaking onto the Jump Ship. She ran after him. Where on Earth could he be going?</p><p>"John." She drawled, leaning against the door of the jump ship. </p><p>He jumped.</p><p>"Sara, love." He exclaimed, putting his hand to his heart. "Don't do that."</p><p>"What are you doing?" She demanded.</p><p>"Uhhhh. I have some family things to deal with back in our time." He looked a bit sheepish. </p><p>"I didn't know you had any family."</p><p>"I have an older sister and a niece. They need my help. I'll probably be gone for a while." He explained.</p><p>"What's wrong? Is there anything we can do to help?" She asked.</p><p>"I doubt it, love."</p><p>"You're part of a team now, John. You don't have to do everything alone anymore. Let us help."</p><p>John sighed. "Have you ever come across the Wizarding World in your travels?"</p><p>"I've heard of it." Sara shrugged.</p><p>"Really. What do you know of the last War in Britain?"</p><p>"Some dude who thought of himself as the next Hitler tried to take over Britain. I know he tried to recruit the League of Assassins. Ra's Al Ghul sent his emissaries back in pieces. Then we got word about two years later that the War was over and New Hitler had been killed. That's about all I know." </p><p>"Huh. So that's what happened to Avery and Mulciber Seniors. We never could figure out who killed them. Al Ghul did us a favor." John  grinned. </p><p>"You fought in the War?" Asked Sara.</p><p>"Aye. Was a Commander of a Squadron under Grand Sorcerer Dumbledore. His name was Voldemort, by the way. 'M not a huge fan of ol' Dumbles, but it was either join him or join Voldie. And there was no way I was doin' that." John scoffed.</p><p>"So what's the family emergency and what's it got to do with the Wizarding World?" Asked Sara.</p><p>"My sister, she's a Squib." John saw Sara's look of confusion and explained, "A person of Wizard descent who's born unable to channel Magic. My niece though, she's got strong Magic. She goes to my Alma Mater, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."</p><p>Sara burst out laughing, "Hogwarts?! What kind of name is that?"</p><p>"Yeah, us Wizards are kinda nutty when it comes to naming things. And no one knows why they named it that. Anyway, if you're done." He glared at her.</p><p>"I'm done." She said, waving her hand for him to continue.</p><p>"I got a call from my sister today. Hermione, my niece, just came home from her fourth year. There was an incident at the school. A fellow student was murdered and another student, my niece's best friend no less, was used in a very Dark Ritual that brought old Voldemort back to life. Cheryl's asked for my help protecting Hermione." He explained.</p><p>"Well then. Why are we taking the jump ship? Let's go help your niece."</p><p>"You want to help? Why?" Asked John.</p><p>"You're a friend, John. And friends help each other. Besides aren't we supposed to be fighting magical creatures now?"</p><p>"Yeah, okay. Well. This will be a War again. And the last War was awful so everyone will need to be prepared for that." </p><p>"Sounds like fun, personally." Sara smirked. "Gideon plot a course for-"</p><p>"London, 25th June, 2018." John interjected.</p><p>"Plotting a course for London, England, 2018." Said the Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>"Thank you, Gideon. And please alert everyone to come to the bridge. We've got a Wizarding World to save." Said Sara.</p>
