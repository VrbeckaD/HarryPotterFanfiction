    <p> </p><p>The wind was nipping at the tips of Bucky Barnes' ears, and whipping his hair in his face under the dark green baseball cap. The streets of Little Whinging, Surrey, were much more dirty than the ones back in Moscow. A plastic bag rolled across Bucky's path like a grey tumbleweed. The wind blew again, harder than the last, and he pushed his hands deeper into his field mechanic jacket. The inside of his legs were frozen, and there were goosebumps on the back of his neck. The street was only a blur of his legs and the sidewalk, bathed in the pale grey moonlight. He walked faster, coming to what looked like the edge of the block. Bucky had no particular destination in mind, but at this point the Saharan Desert would have been a better option than the houses that went on and on, except for the outcropping of trees on his left side. He looked up to see how far he was from the curb, when he saw something that made him pause mid-step. There were people in some very strange clothing. A man and a woman, in what looked like super long, uncomfortable bath robes were holding a basket that was covered in blankets. They were walking perpendicular to him across the street so Bucky was behind them, but the thing that intrigued him the most was the fact that they appeared out of nowhere. Bucky analyzed his situation. There was only two of them, and they were both older. His odds were looking good for him, so he followed them, staying in the bushes and out of sight. There was no indication that they knew he was there, and he made it to the bushes of number 4 Privet Drive before the couple stopped and placed the basket on the front doorstep. Bucky buried himself in the bushed that were in good condition, but were in no way dethroned, so his flesh arm took the brunt of the impact. It wasn't enough to create holes in his jacket, but he could feel the individual spikes on each of the rose stems poking his arm like a needle. The elderly couple who left the basket turned and started to walk away, back the direction they came, so Bucky dropped flat to the ground, and pressed himself against the bushes and the cold ground, where a rock was pressing directly into his sternum. He didn't dare move. The old man stopped and Bucky held his breath. He was pretty confident the old man couldn't see him. It was dark, and Bucky was wearing clothes that blended in ground. He was fairly certain the man couldn't see him. But the man only hesitated for a second, and he was on his way again. And he was alone in the street again. The old man and woman were gone, just as they had appeared from thin air. Bucky's knees creaked as he pushed himself off the ground as slow as possible. His joints sore from days of walking, and he could swore his knee actually popped. He peered around the bushes, but there were no sign of either of them. He pushed the rest of himself up, the wind biting his cheekbones like a vicious dog. He walked purposefully over to the backset, and almost reeled back when he realized what was inside.<br/>
It was a baby. A real live tiny child. Bucky considered running. He seriously considered turning his back and leaving the child where he was. He had no reason nor means to take care of a child. But there was a pity that started as a seedling in his heart. The sleeping child visibly burrowed more into his ice white blanket, and that was the exact moment Bucky's resolve broke. He couldn't leave the child out in the cold. Tomorrow was Sunday, so who knows when the people at the house would be up. The child could get frostbite, Bucky reasoned, so he picked up the basket, looked around to make sure no one was there, and made his way back down Privet Drive. </p><p>-----</p><p>Surprisingly, Bucky didn't have a hard time getting into a motel with a moses-baby. He just tucked the blanket over the baby's head, which wasn't an issue because it was still sleeping, and it just looked like he was a really shady guy walking around with a basket of cookies. <br/>
Bucky flinched for the baby's sake when their room smelled like someone had smoked a cigarette that was now a couple days old. The key card didn't work at first, but once he switched the baby to his metal arm and swiped the key card with his regular arm, it clicked open and Bucky let out a long suffering sigh. There were only a few disadvantages to having an enhanced prosthetic arm. The room was not spacious by any means, holding a small bathroom, one bed, a desk, lamp, chair and clock. The room was a dull tan colour that gave Bucky the same feeling as walking into a shrink's office. He placed the basket on the bed and sat down next to it, pulling off the blanket to reveal the little child dressed in a light grey elephant onesie, soft as a feather, and a little hood with elephant ears on it. there was a note, an off-white creamy colour with the name Petunia written on it in neat cursive tucked behind the child's back. He looked at the child and wondered if it's name was Petunia. He hoped not. He slid out the letter from behind the child, and opened it. It smelled vaguely of lemons, which of  all scents to put on a letter was kind of strange. He was fairly sure the letter was not poisoned, as it was technically not meant for him, and it was nesting beside what appeared to be a normal and healthy baby. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Dear Petunia Dursley,<br/>
</em></p><p><em>We regret to inform you that your sister Lily Potter (Ne</em>é <em>Evans) has been killed after being tracked down and killed by Lord Voldemort, a maniacal killer who is currently presumed dead.</em><br/>
We ask that you take care of her son Harry James Potter, as your blood connection to  him will make it safer for him in the oncoming years. He's a year old at this point, he was born on July 31st. As you know, your sister was a witch, so it is possible that you will see signs of magic use. Do not be concerned as this is normal, but if you have any questions, feel free to contact the ministry and get in touch with me. I recommend an owl.<br/>
<br/>
<em>With regrets and best wishes,<br/>
Albus Dumbledore. </em></p><p>Bucky looked at the boy, Harry James Potter. He knew by all means he should return the baby back to the front steps of that house, but the house was at least a day's walk as Bucky had walked most of the night with the baby, stopping in at the wee hours of the morning. He wouldn't be surprised if the baby were to wake up soon.<br/>
What the fuck was he thinking? He was a grown-ass man who was on the run from an evil organization promoting world domination, and he had taken on a fucking child. He didn't have any baby supplies, little money, and no experience on how to take care of a child. He supposed he would figure it out when the baby woke up. </p><p>It was 8 in the morning, and Harry was gurgling happily in his basket as Bucky wandered around the baby isle of the grocery store. Harry stared up at Bucky with his huge jade eyes, and Bucky glanced down at him and then back up at the rows upon rows of baby formula. He picked up a bottle from the stack hanging off the shelf, then picked up at least 10 packs of whatever the cheapest brand was. He added it to the other things in his cart, which was also balancing Harry in the baby portion. Bucky raised his eyebrow at the small boy, who babbled happily back at him. <br/>
"почему я решил забрать тебя. (<em>Why did I decide to take you.)</em>" Harry reached for Bucky, who let him play with one of his metal fingers. Harry touched it and flinched back at the coldness, but it wasn't enough to deter him as he then happily moved the finger all around.<br/>
Soon enough, Bucky had gotten through the checkout line with only mild sympathetic glances from the other mothers in line. He hadn't spent as much money as he thought he would, which meant he and his small charge got to eat more. They hadn't gone back to the motel, Bucky brought his black tactical backpack with him to the grocery store so they could head out first thing in the morning. He took the individual baby things out of the packages which were much to bulky to carry considering he didn't have a car, and stuffed them in the remaining space in his backpack. The rest which didn't fit, he tucked in the basket by Harry's feet, and then lay the blanket over Harry and the items.<br/>
He turned the card in at the front desk, and lady nodded and wished him a good day, and the two were off. </p><p>----</p><p>Bucky had never heard of Severomorsk, so he figured that was a good thing. It was't hard to bribe the landowner of a small apartment building into letting him have a room on the 4th floor. The room wasn't in good condition, but it was cheap. it smelled of old gym socks and stale peanuts, but nothing concerning like rotten food or a gas smell. A can of air spray should do the trick. The couch was an ugly tan colour and moth eaten, but it wasn't falling apart. The kitchen was separated by a half wall to the right of the sitting room. It had a counter to the right and a small table and two chairs to the left. He opened the cupboards to find nothing but dust, which flew up in a flurry of stale air that made Bucky cough and fan his face, trying to clear away the particles. He placed Harry in the basket down on the table, who looked up wondrously at the empty kitchen. He had been fairly quiet the entire journey, Bucky wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not. He hoped Harry was just a quiet baby and not a sick baby, but there didn't look to be anything wrong with him. He wasn't overly warm or cold when Bucky placed a hand on Harry's forehead, and there didn't seem to be any physical ailments. </p><p>There was only a tiny chance of Hydra finding him and Harry here. It was a better place than he'd stayed in before, where'd they'd found him in a month. But that was back in England, and Harry was about a year and 6 months, when they finished their journey for now in Severomorsk. Bucky wanted to stay here without Hydra butting into his business. He wanted to give Harry all that he could from his life, he wanted to give Harry a better life than Bucky had gotten. With Hydra on their tale, however, that would prove to be difficult. </p><p>----</p><p>Minerva McGonagall wasn't sure whether she was upset or angry at Albus Dumbledore. She settled on frustrated. He had checked in with Harry through the wards at Privet drive 6 months after Harry was supposed to be settled well. He couldn't see him through the ward that let him view the house. He couldn't see any sign of Harry moving outside of the house, so he send Minerva to go to the house and check on him. She hustled down the sidewalk towards 4 Privet drive, which looked as bland and boring as the rest of the neighbourhood. She knocked on the door, which a rather large man answered. <br/>
"Can I help you, miss?"<br/>
"Yes, actually, you can. Are you Vernon Dursley?" Minerva inquired.<br/>
The man stood a little straighter, as if she was there on a business deal, "I am."<br/>
"Good. I'm here on a business inquiry about a mister Potter?" She didn't bother beating around the bush. She had things to do back at the school. <br/>
"There's no one here who goes by that name, missus."<br/>
Minerva gave a pleasant grin, but inside she was enraged, "Alright, I must have the wrong house then." She walked back up the sidewalk, and she heard the door close behind her.<br/>
Albus had some explaining to do. </p><p>When she got back to the castle, the first person she ran into was Severus Snape, which was exactly who she wanted to talk to. She didn't even say hello, she went for the jugular.<br/>
"The Potter child is missing."<br/>
Snape was considering just walking past the deputy headmistress, but when she said that he stopped dead in his tracks. <br/>
His tone was icy cold "what did you just say?"<br/>
"Albus, he put the child where he was supposed to go. I was there with him. That was 6 months ago. I came back from checking on him not 10 minutes ago, apparently there was no one who lived there who went by the name of Harry Potter." <br/>
Snape sighed, "absolutely wonderful." This would almost definitely be another screw-up that the old man claimed he could fix in no time. Severus highly doubted it, but there wasn't much he could do. The three of them had to find the Potter boy  and make sure he was placed back where he would be safe. </p>
