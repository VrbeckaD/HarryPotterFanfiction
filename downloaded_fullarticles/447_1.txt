  <p align="left">"Look at the greasy git," Snape hears James say with a smug smile. "Hanging off by his underwear. And --<em>oh, god</em> -- are those <em>heart</em> patterns on his boxers? What a joke, honestly," he laughs with his friends and Snape can feel himself shaking with fury. James is levitating him up into the air by the wand, and has already pulled his pants off. Severus' face is beet red. "Damn you, Potter!" He hisses, gritting his teeth, as his greasy black hair falls over his face. James just smiles, watching Snape get humiliated. "J - J - James, s - s - shouldn't we s - stop, now?" The fat mousy boy, <em>Peter</em>, he recalls, says in a small voice. "W - we could get in serious t - t - trouble."</p>
</blockquote><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">James laughs. "Oh, don't be such a wuss, I'd like to see them try. Unlike him, I'm rich, famous, and everyone practically loves me! If anything, that prickly prat is getting detention. Not me." Severus looks down, not bearing to look at anyone in the face. What would Lily do if she were here? Would she laugh at him, too?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">His eyes widen with newly formed tears. Lily, her red hair, her soft smiles, so full of life...</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">...<em>Would she even look at him, anymore?</em> Or would she just laugh with Potter and his prunes?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oi, Prongs," Sirius says, pointing to a familiar figure at the distance, and Snape squints through his humiliation. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"POTTER!" A voice so loud, so full of fury, Snape wonders if the whole castle can hear. Probably.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">James drops Severus immediately who hits the ground unceremoniously, and quickly shoves his wand into his pocket as if nothing had happened. Severus looks to see who it is and </p><p align="left">James smiles at the redhead, who has her hands on her hips.</p><p align="left">"What is it, Lily? Have you finally fallen for me after all this time?" He asks flirtaciously, acting like he didn't didn't . Snape stumbles, pulling up his pants as he does so and throwing Potter a death glare. He would never live this down. Not ever. And especially not now.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">What came next, Snape was completely unprepared for.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"><em>Lily Evans slapped Potter across the face.</em> So much force behind her punch, that it left a red handprint on one side of his face. Ouch. '<em>That's got to hurt</em>,' Snape thinks with a curled smile. '<em>He bloody well deserved it, though.</em>' Suddenly, he feels a rush of footsteps and Lily is by his side, looking him over carefully. "Are you OK, Sev? Are you hurt anywhere? Are you---"</p><p align="left">"---'m <em>fine</em>," he snarls, his narrowed eyes set on James. He shoves Lily off of him, and with a swish of his cloak, leaves the Castle Grounds without so much as a goodbye.</p>
