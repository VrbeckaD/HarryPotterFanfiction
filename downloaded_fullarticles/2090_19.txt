    <p>"Elphie? What's wrong?" Glinda was on the alert the moment her green-skinned friend touched down in their shared castle of the west, which they had been residing in together for about a year now. The cause for Glinda's alarm was because, as Elphaba flew in through the window that led to their "living room", she was clutching her chest tightly.</p><p>"Were you hurt?" Glinda demanded again as Elphaba carefully landed in the window sill and hopped off her broom and inside the castle.</p><p>"No, no, nothing like that," Elphaba promised with a gentle and reassuring smile. "My cloak just tore during one of my missions today and I was trying to keep the lining from falling out as I flew on back!" she showed off the torn cloak to reassure Glinda that she was fine. Just like she promised, Elphaba herself was totally unharmed, but her thick black cloak had a mouth-shaped hole torn down the side. Spilling out from that mouth was a thin, silvery lining.</p><p>"Well! I can fix it if you like!" Glinda said as she inspected the cloak. It really wouldn't be that hard to sew up at all!</p><p>"Thanks!" Elphaba gratefully took her up on the offer and while she sat down to rest, Glinda took the cloak over to a nearby sewing machine.</p><p>Sometime during their little moment of relaxation, however, something caught Elphaba's eye...</p><p>"Glinda! Your arm!" the green girl hopped up from the couch she had been reclining on and pointed in horror at Glinda's arm. Or lack thereof.</p><p>"What?" Glinda looked first at Elphaba, then down at her arm. Then she gave her own shout of surprise.</p><p>"Sweet Oz! Where is my arm?!" perhaps it was a comical-sounding phrase to speak, but for some reason, the first half of Glinda's right arm was entirely missing. She hopped up like a singed cat and, in doing so, felt something silky sliding across her arm. Suddenly, then, her arm was back. It only took her five seconds to realize what had happened.</p><p>"Sweet Oz!" she repeated, but this time, her voice was full of awe instead of shock...</p><p>"Yup. It's an invisibility cloak," Glinda confirmed a moment later as she wrapped the thin, silvery lining from Elphaba's cloak around her shoulders. A few seconds later, her body was gone and only a head remained.</p><p>"Wicked!" Elphaba breathed in reply.</p><p>"I've never seen one so powerful before!" Glinda agreed as she handed the cloak to Elphaba, who wasted no time in testing it out herself.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Elphaba replied as she vanished from Glinda's sight.</p><p>"I mean, most invisibility cloaks don't conceal you perfectly," Glinda replied. "All the ones I've seen before have had... imperfection," she paused for a moment, trying to think of a good way to explain this to Elphaba.</p><p>"For example," she said, "I've seen invisibility cloaks before that sometimes still leave a vague outline. Like, you are hidden, but the cloak is visible, if that makes sense. And other times the cloaks don't conceal shadows. Or sometimes, the fabric would just get old and the magic would wear off. I've never seen a cloak that worked so well before!" she shook her head in amazement as Elphaba came back into view.</p><p>A week later, Elphaba and Glinda were still just as floored by their lucky find as they were when they first discovered it.</p><p>"I've put it through an array of tests and it hasn't failed a single one!" Glinda decreed as she handed the invisibility cloak back to Elphaba. "I've tried using magical and nonmagical means in order to get it to fail, but it hasn't! Not even once, not even a little!"</p><p>"It's the stuff of legends, isn't it?" Elphaba replied as she took the cloak back, drawing it around her body once again.</p><p>"Yes it is!" Glinda agreed heartily, thinking back on how, just a couple hours ago, she'd tried to set the thing on fire with her wand. It didn't work. The fire just extinguished itself the second it touched the cloak. And no dagger or knife would cut the fabric, Glinda had tried that too.</p><p>"Yes, it really is the stuff of legends," Glinda repeated with a smile, but then her eyes shot wide open. "Wait just a clock tick!"</p><p>15 minutes later, Elphaba and Glinda were standing in Kiamo Ko's master library. Glinda was holding a little old book titled "The Deathly Hallows". Elphaba eyed the book with suspicion. Though she had never read the story herself, she had heard of it in her childhood. From what her father, and several of their neighbors, had said, it was little more than a fairytale. Or it was some sort of demonic tale of suggestion that would be best used as tinder. But either way, whether or not the neighbors considered the book a harmless bedtime story or a demonic influence, everyone was in unanimous agreement that it was all entirely fictitious. It was only a kiddie book! A fable! A bedtime story! The stuff of legends!</p><p>But Glinda was arguing otherwise, and quite passionately too.</p><p>"It is not just a story!" she cried as she opened the book up and shoved it at Elphaba. "The Deathly Hallows used to be real! Back in the time of the first Ozma! She used them to help harness her magic and create Oz as we know it! And it's not just a creation myth either!" she cried.</p><p>"But even if they <em>used </em>to exist it doesn't mean they'll still be around all these eons later!" Elphaba argued as she shoved the book back at Glinda.</p><p>"Are you really so sure about that?" Glinda replied, gesturing to their invisibility cloak, which they had brought along with them to the library. At first, Elphaba wanted to scoff. She wanted to laugh at the very idea of <em>their </em>cloak being the one of the legends, but Glinda looked so serious in her belief that, for once, Elphaba's own was shaken.</p><p>A month later, Glinda had won the argument. She managed to find proof that the Deathly Hallows were real.</p><p>"They were never fake at all!" she cried as she pulled up another ancient text from the heart of Kiamo Ko. It was a journal from a previous inhabitant of the castle, talking about how he had once possessed the Elder Wand before losing it in a humiliating and nearly-fatal battle.</p><p>"The Wizard only ever said that they were fake to squelch out the chance of anyone else trying to find them!" Glinda continued as she shoved the journal into Elphaba's face, and these words struck a chord with Elphaba such that she began to realize that Glinda was right. What a very "Wizard" thing to do: claim that a historical text was actually only fiction in order to eliminate competitors. It was just his style!</p><p>"I can't believe we've been duped by that old toad again!" Elphaba cursed angrily as she flipped violently through the little old journal.</p><p>"That doesn't matter now," Glinda interrupted Elphaba sharply. "All that matters is that we need to find those Hallows before he does!" and from that day forward, the race was on!</p>
