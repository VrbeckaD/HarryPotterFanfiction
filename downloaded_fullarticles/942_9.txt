    <p>Draco found it just lying there on the ground. There was only two people standing there, staring at it. Left to wander the grounds, 7th years were like ghosts, staring at the rubble that was their former home. Draco especially, seeing things he helped escalate. Things he should have never joined. There were plenty of things he wished he hadn’t done. There were things he wished he never thought of. If only he could go back and change it. Stop himself, stop potter, stop Voldemort. Change it all, make it better. That’s when he saw it. Then he saw her. </p><p>Tattered and torn robes, a shredded Hufflepuff scarf, dust and ash across her face. The bridge of her nose had a deep gash, blood-caked and dried. There were tears trailing her cheeks. What Draco saw clearer was the blood that dried over her hands. Hands she once held a dying classmate with. One was broken, he could tell by the bruising and purple skin, bones in odd places. She fought. With every fiber of her being, he could tell she fought. And she lost. Friends or family… </p><p>“It’s a time-turner.” She spoke first, her voice raw and scratchy. Obviously from crying. “You should take it.”</p><p>“What?” He blurted out, catching her eye. That’s when Draco realized what corpse of a person was staring back at him. One of her eyes was completely glazed over and it's iris transparent. There was a deep scar across her brow and stopped just short of her cheeks. Something her burnt bangs had covered up till now. “Iris… Iris Martin.”</p><p>“Draco, take it.” She spoke louder now, bending down to snatch it up. It was apart of the rubble but still completely intact. Everything about it screamed brand new. Yet everything around them screamed war. Death and war. Iris Martin took the brunt force of it, by the looks of it. Lost friends, lost her right eye, broke her hand, and even her heart. Because despite her eye being shot and ruined, Draco saw the heartbreak in them. Her emotions so clear on her sleeve. A sleeve that fell off her person as she outstretched her hand. </p><p>Iris Martin was a 7th year Hufflepuff. Her father was an Auror, Draco saw her often at Ministry parties with her parents. Once they stood by the wall, muttering about stiff wigged parties being no fun. The only memory he had of a classmate was of them playing wizard’s chess in the back of a ministry party. Her smile was so bright. </p><p>This war he had a part of destroyed that smile. Destroyed a pretty face and any chance she had at a normal life. What was normal after this, anyway?</p><p>“What would I do with it?”</p><p>“Go back, to the beginning… and stop it.” She swallowed hard.</p><p>“If you want it, do it.” Draco barked, stepping back.</p><p>“You’re the only one who can!” She cried out, stepping towards him. Draco’s heart raced as she shoved the time turner towards him again. </p><p>“Give it to Potter, the hero!”</p><p>“He wouldn’t kill him.” Draco’s heart sank into his feet as he realized what reputation preceded him here. Killing Dumbledore was on his shoulders. He had not been the one to kill Dumbledore, yet they all believed it. No one outside of that room knew Draco had not. Snape was dead, Dumbledore was dead, a lot of people were dead. And yet he held the label of a killer. </p><p>“What should I do?” Draco whispered, reaching out to take her hand with both of his. Her working hand shook tremendously. Her skin was on fire, obviously fighting off pain and shock. </p><p>“If you kill him, he can never hurt you.” Her voice trembled so much it made Draco shake. It wasn’t till tears fell down his face, that he even realized he was crying. His body shook hard, unable to meet her eye. She took back her hand, leaving the time turner in his hand. </p><p>Take out the darkest wizard in all creation? </p><p>If he was being honest with himself, it wasn’t that bad. Draco would live with the knowledge that he killed Voldemort before he ever became Voldemort. He could sleep at night knowing if he had to kill one person… it would be him. No more torture, no more dead friends and family, no more him. What would the world be like if Voldemort never happened?</p><p>And so he threw the golden chain around him and stepped back from Iris Martin. She stepped back, watching him with worry painted on her marred face. Draco began to twist it back, doing the math within his head. If it was wrong, he would merely keep it going till he got it right. Twenty…. Thirty… until he stopped counting and let it go. </p><p>The world rewound and it kept going. He watched people come back to life, he watched the castle reform, it all fixed itself. Then people came and went, death-eaters disappeared, the school began to change. Seasons overhead went in fast reverse. Before his mind could wrap around it, it was nighttime. Draco stepped out over the grass of the castle, wand out. His suit was still in tatters and his hair smudged with ash. He never gave thought to what would happen after this, until it was too late. </p><p>This was the only way.</p><p>Following his mind to the dungeons, skidding around the school. He could not be seen. Thankfully, a glance to the sky revealed it was close to three am. No soul should be awake, let alone walking around. Everything was so familiar yet so strange as he stepped up to the dungeon stairwell. He did not have a password, but there had been many nights he broke into the common room without one. Being prefect was nice, but often made one too tired and wiped of energy to remember. Draco stood against the portrait and ran his wand along the seam of it. The grooves of the frame reminded him of his first day here. Pride surged through him then, so young and naive of the horrors. How he felt so on top of the world. Godly almost. </p><p>Draco lingered over a table, looking to the paperwork of a slumbering Slytherin. The date on the parchment stood out in his mind. February 3rd, 1944. This would have been Tom Riddle’s sixth year. All he needed was to know where Tom slept. He could murder him in his sleep. That way he didn’t have to feel guilty. </p><p>“Malfoy, What are you doing out of bed?… who are you?” </p><p>That voice, it was familiar, but far away. A soft version of a voice that often haunted his dreams. In the blink of an eye, he found himself face to face with the demon at the back of his mind. The man, the monster, the wizard who started it all. The timing couldn't be more perfect. Draco had no time, he could not stop to stare at the student who moved at the table. His father. He had no time to stare at his father. If he did not act fast, this would never work. The spell was like hot acid in his stomach, it sat on his tongue. His teeth on edge, Draco whipped around. </p><p>“AVADA KEDAVRA!”</p><p>The world went dark. His ears popped so hard he believed he’d gone deaf. His throat ran dry and his stomach clenched down hard. Everything was pitch black, but for some reason, he felt at ease. Floating in an abyss, unable to see, but able to feel. Relaxed, comfortable, lulled to lie back longer. A deep sleep that evaded him for the last two years of his life. It felt so good to sleep.</p><p>The world was soft, and he was at ease. Like he was surrounded by soft cotton pillows and a cloud of a blanket.</p><p>Had it all been a dream? Had he died? </p><p>“Draco? Honey… Draco, sweetheart, wake up.” The delicate murmur of his mother’s voice broke through the abyss. A warm butter knife slicing through his abyss swiftly and calmly. Light trickled into his eyes. Blinking hard, Draco finally came out of the world. </p><p>Had it been a dream? As he was obviously alive. He looked to his hands, still feeling the vibrations of the spell against his skin. The dryness in his throat was real, but he did not feel dirty. The ash of the war had not stained his skin. In Fact, he looked freshly washed, as if he hopped into bed after a long shower. </p><p>Bed? Draco jumped a bit in his skin, looking over the sheets in surprise. His sheets! His bed! His room! Draco looked to his mother and his heart fluttered. She looked… the same as when she did before school. Before any of it. Beautiful and fresh-faced, and … “Draco? Are you alright?”</p><p>It worked… the spell changed everything. Because Draco was still 17 and… he was still home… and there was no stench of Voldemort anywhere. </p><p>“I am… fantastic.” Draco whispered, breathlessly, and he smiled. It felt so foreign to smile. </p><p>“Well hurry up and dress then Draco. Harry is due to be here any minute. You know how ridiculous he is at dressing for events like these. He will need all your help.”</p><p>Her chirp was warm like baked apples. A scent filled the air, a lavender scent like he were sat out in a field, fresh air on his face. His mother stopped wearing perfume around Voldemort as he snarled over it constantly. But she wore it now! She smelt like heaven.</p><p>“Events? … Potter?” Draco’s heart jumped beats, the information raising alarms in his head.</p><p>“Yes, Harry Potter. You’ve only been friends with him for six years, Draco. And don’t try and play it off. You and I both know it’s the ministry ball. Come on and get up, lazy bones. Unless you want Harry to find you in your knickers.” His mother teased, poking him in the shoulder. Draco blinked rapidly as it all began to come to light. </p><p>He killed Voldemort. He murdered the darkest wizard of all time. Had it really changed the world so much that he… and Harry Potter… had become friends? Close enough friends that his mother let him into their home? The ministry ball! It was the weekend before school starts! That meant… it was just before their 7th year. </p><p>The image of Iris Martin played in his mind, the desperate look in her eyes as he put on the time-turner. Had it been a dream? Had this been the real reality? The answer came in the image of the time turner. It was clutched in his hand, the chain tickling his wrist. </p><p>Draco Malfoy changed the whole world.</p><p>So why was he still haunted with an uneasy feeling in his stomach? It had to be the war, it had to be the life. Images he could remember, pieces of the horror that was his old life. And not that he had not gone back far enough… to stop Voldemort from ever coming back. It was definitely not that. </p><p>“MALFOY! Seriously, mate. Don’t you ever wear pants?”</p><p>“Potter! Don’t you ever knock, you barbarian!” Draco’s voice boomed, bouncing off the walls as he rushed to yank on a discarded pair of trousers. Harry Potter stood in his doorway, howling with laughter as he desperately clung to the frame.</p>
