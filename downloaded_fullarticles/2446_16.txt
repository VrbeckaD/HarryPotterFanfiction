    <p>He looked so different, so mature, so poised and attentive.</p>
<p>But he was still the same brat who pestered her all those years ago.</p>
<p>Even when he would sneer with those pearly whites and the slithering tone he would use to purr her name, it still had the same confusing and unsettling undertone like all those other years.</p>
<p>So why did this year feel different?</p>
<p>Oh, that's right.</p>
<p>
  <em>Things were different.</em>
</p>
<p>Just like a dove and a pigeon, or as the world went round and time flew by, everything was the same. Things just appeared so much more different.</p>
<p>And as she pondered all those little things, her childhood friend clad in his emerald and silver tie stared at her contemplating when was the right time to snap her away from her thoughts. Theodore Nott took in the sapphire and silver tie that hadn't been tied yet, the way she sat so relaxed whilst her mind was swimming with an ocean's worth of thoughts. He knew she liked to ponder into her thoughts for as long as she can. Its always been a habit of hers - to be so deep in her own thoughts she forgets about those around of hers. <em>A selfish habit</em>, he thought. But everyone has their habits and he grew to accept that this would be the one habit she'll always have. He took in the way her hair had gotten longer over the summer, now reaching her chest and her deep brown eyes that rested behind her glasses. The way they looked so warm and rich, like velvet pools of chocolate. If you stared straight into her eyes deeply, you'd see the small specks of honey in them. That is, if you looked deep enough. But not many did. Not like Theo. He waited for her to finally realise he was staring. He timed it; it only took 3 minutes.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I was-"</p>
<p>"Deep in your thoughts," He interrupted her. "I know. You don't have to say sorry every time."</p>
<p>"I know, its just-"</p>
<p>"A bad habit."</p>
<p>She frowned playfully, "Do you always have to interrupt me when i'm trying to give you a sincere apology, Theo?"</p>
<p>Theodore chuckled lowly, punching her shoulder lightly. "You make it sound like we only just met yesterday."</p>
<p>"It feels like the first day we met." Aurora hummed. "Do you remember? You were forced to offer me some chocolate truffles but I was so busy staring at Draco?"</p>
<p>"Of course I remember that. You wondered what it would be like to have platinum hair and whether you should dye it that colour. I wonder if you still want to, Aura."</p>
<p>"I've already tried it."</p>
<p>Ah, he should have known already she'd try such a glamour spell on herself.</p>
<p>"And I didn't really fancy it. It just didn't bode well in my liking."</p>
<p>Then his eyes turned sharp for the slightest second. A second that Aurora was able to catch.</p>
<p>"What about Malfoy, himself? Is he to your liking? - And no, I don't mean his hair colour. You know what I mean, Aura."</p>
<p>She contemplated the thought, loving how irked Theo looked. She always knew Theo didn't like the thought of her and Malfoy together. He's expressed that thought subtly for years now, and she took advantage of that to tease him, like best friends do. For if she knew what was behind closed doors, would he still stare at her with those sharp, brown eyes.</p>
<p>"There's certain aspects of him that are too my liking," is all she simply said.<br/>
She loved that tinge of distaste that appeared on Theo's face. It was the wrinkle of his nose like he had just smelled something awful that made her laugh all the time.<br/>
"Why do you dislike him so much?"</p>
<p>"Its not that I dislike him," he begun. "Its the thought of you two together, the possibility. The chance that someone as great as you would stoop for a guy like him. I've known him as long as I've known you Aura, he's not exactly an ideal mate for you. You don't know him. He didn't even visit us throughout the whole summer."</p>
<p>"Maybe he was busy? Besides, Its not like he'll be the same silly child who kept getting kelpies and kappas mixed up, besides the fact they both were water demons. He can grow up, he has potential." Aurora reasoned.</p>
<p>"He also has the potential to increase the size of his ego to the equivalent of his gringotts vault," Theo muttered. "Why are you defending him anyway? He's done nothing but annoy you and boast about the size of his vault since we were 10."</p>
<p>"I don't really know," She lied smoothly. "I just don't like the false accusation that he's some terrible lad. He's probably alright inside - Yes, I mean it when I say alright. Just because he doesn't bully me like he does everyone else, doesn't mean he's a good guy in my book. Besides, he's still trying to create himself."</p>
<p>"Create?" Theo asked as he stood up and began to rummage for his small bag of mints that he always kept with him. "You mean find himself?"</p>
<p>"See, that's the thing with life. People think we need to 'find' ourselves." She began explaining as she popped a mint into her mouth. "I've always seen it as we've already found ourselves, its just after we do find ourselves, we have to create ourselves. And that's what life is really about. Its to create who we want to be."</p>
<p>He nodded understandingly. "Bet you got that from a noble philosopher's scripture."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Nope, its from a muggle. Bernard Shaw."</p>
<p>He wrinkled his nose again. "A muggle," he grimaced.</p>
<p>"And this is why your dad does not like me and I do not like him," she laughed dryly. "That pro-pureblood madness has conflicted your mind once more."</p>
<p>"Hey, I don't protest about your spinster-like persona, don't protest about my pro-purebloodedness." He countered haughty.</p>
<p>"You just did now," she countered equally as disdained. "And I am not a going to be a spinster! Won't ever be!"</p>
<p>"Ha, we'll see about that. Times are changing Aurora, purebloods of our status don't want to mingle with mere muggles or even half bloods. We are better than that. Especially in this period. You need to remember your place in the wizarding world and how you are representing yourself as the heiress to the house of Videre. Your house may not be part of the sacred twenty eight, but you are pureblood. People are watching. You don't want to end up like her, do you?"</p>
<p>She thought about what he had just said, blanking out again as she turned her attention away to the window where she could faintly see the outline of Hogwarts hidden behind the foresty paths of Hogsmeade. She knew he was right in his twisted words. People were watching. Good and bad - which side she was more wary of, she didn't know. In her mind, both were equally as troubling. Then she thought about what it meant to be of the house of Videre.</p>
<p>The house of Videre were made up of purebloods and halfbloods alike; though the latter were never mentioned in the presence of other purebloods. They were shunned. It was just how her family were. It was something Aurora had grown to accept from a house like hers. There were pros and cons, benefits and consequences. Like her dear aunt whom had suffered the consequences.</p>
<p>Emmeline Videre Vance. Not much is known about her to outsiders and other purebloods but she knew. Her house had shunned her after she married a muggle and fought for them, protesting when she could for them. Her family had halted all contact with her, except for little Aurora and her mother - whom had found her protests quite interesting and opening up a whole new world for the two. She had married a muggle man whom fell ill and died. She lived the rest of her life widowed but content with her life. She fought against you-know-who in the first wizarding world. Unfortunately, she had died over the summer. Her mother and her both buried her in peace, along with her friends including her old professor Remus Lupin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"We weren't always pureblood from the start, you know?" She remembered her aunt telling her when she young. "Our pureblooded ancestor first married a non-magical man at first, a muggle, before he soon died. Then she re-married a pureblooded wizard. But of course, nobody dares to mention that for obvious bias reasons. But I felt you should know, little Aurora."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Does mother and father know this too?" She could hear her little voice ask in interest.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Of course they know, but will your father ever tell you this? I bet not. They'll teach you how to be prim and pompous. They'll find a character you can mould into as you grow."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Little Aurora frowned. "I don't want to be someone else."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her aunt beamed at her. "That's right! you grow into who you want to be. Always be tactical Aurora. You have a bright future ahead of you if you play your cards right. Whatever you do, I'll always be proud of you."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Even if I marry a muggle?" She asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Muggles are still human. Of course, I would be. Love has no boundaries, my darling." Her aunt cooed smoothing her hair down. "Just remember who you are and where you came from. You are a Videre. And you create who you want to be."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"And so are you!"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was one of the last conversations she had face to face with her aunt. Her untimely death and her conflict with the house meant she could only contact her via owl. She wasn't old enough to apparate by herself and with the ever increasing rumours of you-know-who, it was dangerous for a witch of her stature to leave anywhere unattended. Thankfully, Theo would always be there to accompany her despite his father's protest of their closeness.</p>
<p>"She lived a good life." She finally spoke.</p>
<p>"I guess so." Theo replied. "I just don't want you suffering the same fate."</p>
<p>"What makes you think I will?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know. But i'm not taking any chances. You're too precious to me, Aurora." He wrapped his arm around her shoulder and let her lean closer into him. "I'm just saying, be wary. I won't always be there now that I've got somebody."</p>
<p>"Lucky you," she muttered sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Listen here Miss 'my-date-with-Rickett-on-valentines-day-was-not-a-date', Go and find yourself a better lad. I could hook you up with Pucey, if you want? He's a good lad." He nudged reminding her of the rumours that spread during her fourth year with a certain Hufflepuff Beater.</p>
<p>"For the last time, he was teaching me piano at Dominic Maestro's! I helped him get together with Lisa, remember? You know they're still together." She huffed. "Besides, he helped me get a date with Jeremy."</p>
<p>"Jeremy? Jeremy Stretton? The ravenclaw chaser that just graduated?" He took his arm off her and faced her completely. "When did this happen? Where did it happen? and most of all - <em>Why</em> did it happen?"</p>
<p>"It just happened. We only dated for a few months in 4th year," She shrugged. "Oh come on, don't give me that crinkle of the nose!"</p>
<p>"I'd be happier if it were Malfoy or someone else you had dated." Theo muttered.</p>
<p>"You were just addressing your dislike for Draco and I."</p>
<p>"And now i'm addressing my dislike that you dated stringy Stretton. The guy was as tall and as thin as a bowtruckle. Besides, He makes kneazles look adorable." He simply said, helping her up. "Come on, I promised Pans i'd accompany her on the carriage. We're discussing your love life this weekend in the library."</p>
<p>"I'm not hopping into the same carriage as you two," She frowned, accepting his hand and hopping off the train. "And like i'd tell you what I've been up to."</p>
<p>He merely raised an eyebrow at her concluding statement.</p>
<p>She bid goodbye to Theo - whom whisked away to Parkinson waiting by the carriages- whilst she walked slowly towards the carriages, wanting to be one of the few who can grab a carriage by themselves. Knowing her closest friends, They would have been at the castle by now, securing their beds. She thought of how her fellow Ravenclaws, Sue Li, would fight over a particular bed with Lisa Turpin. The two insisted they had the 3rd bed on the left due to the draft from both the window and door. Being situated in the Ravenclaw tower had its benefits. The view was pretty amazing. However, the draft - especially during the wintry nights - were sometimes unbearable.</p>
<p>'<em>which is why we always insist to study in the library rather than the common room</em>,' She thought to herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As she ascended into the carriage, she didn't realise the figure that followed closely after her. And it wasn't until she turned around to close the carriage door that she realised a certain gray eyed Slytherin was waiting for her to notice him...</p>
<p>as usual.</p>
<p>"Oh, Malfoy," She greeted almost too happily. "I haven't seen you in quite a while. Usually I'd see you during the summer over at Theo's."</p>
<p>"Videre," Malfoy greeted as he climbed into the carriage and sat opposite her. "I thought you weren't allowed at the Nott residence."</p>
<p>"His father wasn't there," She shrugged.</p>
<p>"Naughty girl, I should tell Nott senior," He sneered.</p>
<p>"Tell him and i'll report how you were the one who broke their window when we were 12 and blamed it on their house elf."</p>
<p>"Well, well, looks like someone grew a backbone over the summer," He eyed her up and down staring directly at her tie. "For a Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>"Whats that suppose to mean?" Of course she knew what it meant. It was an offence to her house. But she wanted to hear it from him - to see if he's grown a backbone too, and if so, deduce what he may have been up to over the summer to cause the sudden growth of his backbone.</p>
<p>"It means that you little Ravenclaws are always hiding behind your books. I feel it'll be a more interesting year now. Maybe you'll stop hiding with Nott in the library and seek out something better than knowledge."</p>
<p>"Knowledge is the greatest treasure one can find, Malfoy," She huffed bracing herself for the rocky journey towards the castle. She hoped he hadn't caught the glint in her brown eyes. </p>
<p>"I believe you mean power," He hummed leaning back into his seat. "You seem to misunderstand our world."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You're smart. Figure it out, Videre."</p>
<p>The silence filled the compartment. A comfortable silence. It was something the two were both used to.</p>
<p>"I think we can drop the act. The carriage has started moving now. You still didn't answer my question. Usually i'd see you at Theo's."</p>
<p>He gulped before stating, "So you missed me?"</p>
<p>"No," She blinked fighting the urge to bite the insides of her gum.</p>
<p>"You're lying," He sneered once more. "I think I know you better than anyone else, even Theo. You missed me."</p>
<p>"No," She began, her tone lowering into a whisper. "I just - Alright. Let's just say that I did miss you, and that I was waiting for your owl, or for your to visit Theo, yet you never showed. - What would you say?"</p>
<p>Draco's sneer slowly disappeared into a solemn look. It was a look she had never seen before. It was a look of stoic resignation - almost robotic in a way like he had been practising this for some time now. It was as if his eyes were now just a gray void. A calm before the storm, perhaps?</p>
<p>"Aurora." He purred.</p>
<p>She remained staring into his eyes. Only this time, she took in his stiff posture and the lack of the Malfoy-esque demeanor she was used to. The lack of underlying playfulness and witty remark, she didn't like what was coming next.</p>
<p>"We can't keep doing this."</p>
<p>
  <em>Here it comes.</em>
</p>
<p>"Hiding away, fooling around like children."</p>
<p>She frowned. <em>They were children.</em></p>
<p>"You know how I feel for you. I'm an open book for you and only you. But-" He paused.</p>
<p>
  <em>But?</em>
</p>
<p>"-But things are different now. We need to act like adults now. You know that these times are hard for me. My family, my legacy, my loyalty towards them-"</p>
<p>
  <em>Them? His family?</em>
</p>
<p>"-Is what I live for. I must make them proud. I can't always meet you like we used to. I can't always be at your beck and call every time another letter has been sent by you. I've found my purpose. You need to find yours."</p>
<p>"I've found myself," She replied unsure.</p>
<p>"Don't be daft," He groaned leaning towards her, arms resting on his knees. "I'm being serious right now. Have you forgotten whats happened this year?"</p>
<p>"Who doesn't know whats happened this year?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>"Then what are you trying to tell me?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying to tell you that you need to grow up, Aurora." She noticed the vein in his forehead popping out. She took note of the way he now clenched his hands together and the small shake from holding on too tightly. "I'm trying to tell you that you need to find a place in the world. You're smart and beautiful. And yes there was something there, something that developed over these years, but," He paused to take a breather. "I don't want it to go to waste. I don't want you waiting. I know you Aurora, You'd wait an eternity, but I can't let you waste your life like this. You're better than this, you deserve better. And I want you. God knows how much I want you; but I can't have you."</p>
<p>"What do you mean you can't have me? You already do." She murmured.</p>
<p>"They won't let me." <em>They again. His family?</em> "They know of us. They don't want me to continue what we have. We're done for. I'll treasure the memories, but right here, right now, we have to say goodbye to the possibility of 'us'."</p>
<p>He knew his words hurt her. Her glossy brown eyes gave it away. They were filled with remorse and hurt. He was the cause. He hurt her. He knew all too well how it felt to hurt others but hurting her was the worst experience he felt. And he couldn't do anything about it. It was like an invisible rope held him down. An invisible rope that lead back to them.</p>
<p>"Listen, Aurora-" He tried once again.</p>
<p>"No," She interrupted. "No. I should have seen this coming. I knew this would one day."</p>
<p>"You knew?" He asked almost confused. Almost. Did she know?</p>
<p>"Of course I knew," She snapped, letting a tear slowly fall down her face. How he wished the restraints that bound him in position would loosen so he could wipe it away while they were alone together. "Don't you think I haven't seen the way Theo's circle of family and friends - Your circle - look at me? I didn't belong. I never did from the start. But I wanted to belong there, because I wanted to be with you. I really wanted to, Draco."</p>
<p>Merlin, he hadn't heard her say his name in such a long time. However, the way she had said it was far too grim for such a girl like her.</p>
<p>"Did you even fight for us?"</p>
<p><strike>Yes</strike>. "No."</p>
<p>"Did you consider how hurt i'd feel not hearing from you once since that day, waiting for your reply, only to hear this on the way back to Hogwarts?"</p>
<p><strike>Yes</strike>. However, he stayed silent, afraid his conscious would utter what he truly felt.</p>
<p>"Did anything that happened between us mean anything to you?"</p>
<p><strike>Yes</strike>.</p>
<p>"Were you ever loyal to me? Was there someone behind closed doors?"</p>
<p>"Believe me when I say there wasn't anyone else." Draco managed to choke out.</p>
<p>"Then speak up, Draco. All I hear right now is a thundering voice telling me I was a fool. That I shouldn't have started anything with you. That I shouldn't have kissed you that day and promised a day where we wouldn't have to live up to blind expectations. That I shouldn't have blindly put best foot forward only to stagger two steps back."</p>
<p>"I'd put my life on the line for you." He countered.</p>
<p>"You just told me your family did not approve of us."</p>
<p><em>His Famil</em>- "Aurora. Look, believe me when I say-"</p>
<p>"Should I believe you?"<br/>
She wiped away the tears that marred her face. Sniffling she leaned in until there was merely an inch between them. Why did it feel like they were miles apart?<br/>
"Look me in the eyes. And tell me you would throw all that you have for me."</p>
<p>He gulped. "Do you know me?"</p>
<p>"At this point," she leaned back. There was no time to think things through. She just spurted whatever was on her mind blindly accepting the consequences. "I question if I ever did know you. I had an idea of you; an idea that you were different, that you would accept me like Theo did. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I studied you for so long that I had forgotten what was real and what were just ideas of what you could be."</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" He asked, mouth agape.</p>
<p>"I thought we would last. That you'd keep your promise all those years ago. Maybe one day you'll grow up and realise you have to fight for something too."</p>
<p>He gulped again. Oh how he regretted not speaking up earlier.</p>
<p>"You're telling me to find myself, well maybe you need to find yourself first." She growled.</p>
<p>"I have found my place in this world." He retorted equally as aggressive. "I know who I am. A pureblood. A part of the sacred twenty eight. I'm the sole heir to the Malfoy fortune. I'm their only hope for a better future."</p>
<p>"And who do you want to be? Besides all that bullshit about pureblooded legacies. What are you trying to create in the future for yourself?"</p>
<p>"A life my father would be proud of," He whispered letting his mind linger to his father in Azkaban. "A lifetime of fame and fortune."</p>
<p>"That's quite childish," she mocked albeit saddened by the thought of his father in Azkaban. "You haven't thought about yourself. Who are you Draco?"</p>
<p>He felt his tolerance ticking by the second, his shell reattaching itself into something new, something harder and resistant albeit not fully restored.</p>
<p>"What happened to the Draco I knew?" She egged on.</p>
<p>"He died along with us." He said sternly. "I'm going to create myself right now, so listen well Videre," She gulped as he spat her surname in the same manner she would to everyone else. "I am Draco Malfoy, a pureblood and a part of something bigger than the galaxies above us. Heavens know what I'm doing is beneficial and greater than all the fortunes in the world. I'll be rich, powerful and known in the world as a benefactor to the future of the wizarding world. I'll be the man who'll make a difference in the world. Do you understand now, Videre? I can't do this no more. You, as the girl who knew me - really, really knew me - should know this is my ultimatum. Or did I fail to realise the true you? Did I waste my years because I was so entranced by you? Did you even know me?"</p>
<p>"You know what?" She spoke hollowed and disheartened, a point Draco made mentally as she began to exit the carraige. "Sorry that I thought you were different. Theo was right. I really don't know you. Talk to me when you're not being a git."</p>
<p>"Right about what?" He growled. He watched her leave, shouting her name. But she never turned back. She never looked back to see him punching the seat with all the pent up rage he had bottled through the summer.</p>
