          <div class="userstuff"><p>Newt &amp; Theseus Scamander 『The Ministry of Magic』</p><p>    In the Ministry of Magic.</p><p>    「You should really have obeyed your travel ban, brother.」Theseus said to Newt. 「You have no idea how many times I have begged to my colleagues to stop them from throwing you in the dungeon.」</p><p>    His words contains a little anger, and blame.</p><p>    「I know, and I'm sorry. But I had to.」Newt didn't look at his brother, but stared at the corridor.</p><p>    「Did Dumbledore send you?」Theseus walked in front of Newt and asked.</p><p>    「No, he didn't. I went to Paris because...because Tina was there.」Newt still kept his eyes elsewhere.</p><p>    「Fine. Come to my office. I think we should have a talk.」As he spoke, Theseus put his arm around Newt and led him towards another direction.</p><p>    ...</p><p>    Though having been to the Ministry of Magic many times, Newt hadn't quite often been invited to Theseus' office. His eyes kept wandering around after he entered the door.</p><p>    「Please be seated, my brother.」Theseus pushed a chair to Newt.</p><p>    Theseus' office was neatly organized, which perfectly fits his style, efficient and clean. Newt saw piles of papers, on which a magic pen is signing. He noticed the photo of Theseus and Leta, an engagement, with a shadow cast on.</p><p>    Newt sat on the chair, near his brother. He gazed at Theseus for a while and then moved his eyes away.</p><p>    「Look, Newt, you'll have to join the Ministry, to avoid the unbearable punishment about to be put on you. All you need to do is to pick a side, to be with us, against Grindelwald.」Theseus interlaced his fingers.</p><p>    「Yes, I will join the Ministry.」Newt's answer astonished Theseus. He thought Newt would hesitate, owing to his previous attitude.</p><p>    「That's good, then.」Theseus smiled, with delight.</p><p>    Newt stopped for a moment and continued, 「I know how hard it must have been for you to...lose Leta.」</p><p>    Silence sealed the air for a while. Theseus turned around, looking at Leta's photo on the desk.</p><p>    「Maybe my words will not comfort your grief but...I just want you to know, brother, that I'll always be there for you, for...a lifetime.」</p><p>    Newt came up to Theseus and gave him a hug.</p><p>    Something started blinking in Theseus' eyes, as he murmured these words, with sorrow but hope,</p><p>    「Thank you, brother.」</p><p>    ……</p></div>
