  <span class="s2">I’m afraid. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">You squint your eyes more and more as the evening grows darker. Or rather, the afternoon. It is more shadows than light at 4 pm already. And you hate it. </span>
</p><p class="p3">  </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">It makes it harder to paint. It makes it harder to draw clean lines on your canvas. And it makes it harder to see You. But it doesn’t matter. No matter how dark the night is or how long the darkness stays, you are never invisible. The darkness never surrounds you completely. It is as if you are a light - a candle - all on your own, which shines even in the most horrible of times. That’s why it was so hard when you weren’t close. When you were gone, the darkness that stayed behind was overwhelming. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s3"> <em>Promise me you’ll never disappear.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">You turn from your easel and smile sadly. Despite the dim light in the room, the specks of paint on your brown skin are bright and very much visible. You have a blue streak following your hairline on the left side of you face and and green and black spots splashed over your nose. How you always manage to end up like that is and always will be a mystery.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">You stand up and cross the floor. ‘Of course I’ll never disappear,’ you whisper, your voice turns the air into sparkling electricity. ‘A bad day requires special treatment.’ You walk out of the room. I follow.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">As you move around among the cabinets you call out an order. ‘Sit down,’ you say. No sound follows. You turn around and your eyes grow wide immediately. ‘Oh it’s that bad?’ You come back to me.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s3"> <em>No, it’s fine.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">You shake your head, the sadness in your eyes making e atmosphere thick and heavy. Knees buckle. Tears fall, unnoticed by one of two parts. You catch. You dry the tears away. ‘What’s going on?!’ You sound oh, so worried. A croak sounds through the room. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s3"> <em>Today is the day you left me</em> </span> <span class="s2">, it says.</span></p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">You understand. You start to cry. You say you’re sorry. You promise that you won’t disappear again. It’s impossible not to believe you. You realise that the entire day has gone by while you were just painting. You say you’re sorry. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s3"> <em>It’s okay, because you’re beautiful when you paint.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">‘You could’ve told me.’ You sound desperate. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s3"> <em>I’m sorry.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">‘No’, you kiss. And you kiss again. And again. The atmosphere isn’t heavy anymore. The darkness outside is forgotten. You - the light of my life - are next to me, shining bright again. </span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">I’m not afraid.</span>
