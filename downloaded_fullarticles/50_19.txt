    <p>It was the first night back at Hogwarts after the summer holidays and Harry Potter was already exasperated.<br/>
One moment he was minding his own business through the hallways, and the next he was in a classroom, alone, with Draco Malfoy.<br/>
“What?” Harry hissed. Apparently the slytherin was completely out of his mind, there was no other explanation for Harry.<br/>
“Did I stutter, Potter?” Draco rolled his eyes “I asked if you want to be my boyfriend”.<br/>
The dark haired boy was speechless for a moment, his eyes full of shock and surprise, and raised eyebrows. Then, just one question came up in his mind “why? Do you like me?”<br/>
Malfoy, who was sitting on the professor’s desk, has a neutral expression on his face “sit down, Merlin. You get on my nerves if you stand there like an idiot” the boy looked pretty annoyed.<br/>
Harry rolled his eyes, but eventually sat down in a chair in front of Malfoy, with the same expression and arms crossed over his chest. “Happy?”<br/>
“Yep” the boy smirked.<br/>
When he started talking again, his expression was serious “ now, you see, my housemates keep teasing me, because I don’t have a serious relationship” the gryffindor opened his mouth to say something, but the other was faster, and raised his hand to shut him up.<br/>
“Be quiet and let me finish, Potter” the boy closed his mouth immediately.<br/>
“Like I was saying, my parents expect me to be in a serious relationship” Draco sighed “since I couldn’t stand them anymore, I told everyone I am dating someone. No one believed me, could you believe it?” The boy pouted.<br/>
“Yeah I can” Potter said under his breath, but unfortunately, the room was silent and Draco heard it anyway. He raised his chin with a slight offended expression, narrowing his eyes at the boy.<br/>
“I don’t understand what I have to do with this” Harry said louder this time, lost in his thoughts.<br/>
“Merlin, you really are an idiot” the slytherin commented. Now was the gryffindor turn to be offended.<br/>
“ I can’t ask any of my housemates, ‘cause they would probably go tell the others. And I told them I was already in a relationship. While you are...”<br/>
Draco stopped talking, looking out the window and searching the appropriate word to use. When he seemed to have found it, he shrugged and once again he faced Harry “we are enemies, rivals or whatever you want to call our current relationship. In everyone’s eyes we hate each other, so if you are my boyfriend, no one could say it isn’t true. There wouldn’t be any doubt ‘cause we are not friends, so no one can say you are helping me humor the annoying people around me. You don’t have a reason to do so” a little breathless, Malfoy stayed quiet while Harry processed the informations. With a determined look on his face, he seemed to come to a conclusion.<br/>
“It makes sense” the slytherin smirked at the statement.<br/>
“Why, thank you Potter” a smirk still on his face, a hand on his heart and proud eyes.<br/>
“But you actually made a good point, why should I help you? We are not friends” Harry was sincerely curious now.<br/>
“I’m happy you finally asked” Draco stood up from his seat and approached him “let’s see, you will have a dashing boyfriend and the slytherins won’t bother you and your two friends anymore” he smiled sweetly.<br/>
“Deal” was the answer after a moment.<br/>
“Amazing” Draco looked like a kid on Christmas Day.<br/>
“But only if you add another condition” Harry had a determined expression.<br/>
“Shoot”<br/>
“You have to promise that you will be civil and tolerable” this was a good deal for Harry.<br/>
“I’ll let you know I am the perfect boyfriend” the other rolled his eyes.<br/>
“I didn’t know you were gay” stated Harry out of the blue, his cheeks turning red.<br/>
“I’m slightly offended that you assumed I was straight or gay without asking. First of all I’m bisexual and I don’t think you tell every single person you meet your sexuality, am I right?” Draco had a serious expression on his face, but amusement danced in his eyes.<br/>
“Of course not. Why should I do that?” Harry could understand his point of view now.<br/>
“Exactly”<br/>
“So, how do we do this? We can’t change our behavior toward each other, that would be suspicious. And I have the feeling you have a plan” the dark haired boy was sincerely curious now.<br/>
“As a matter of fact, I do” Draco leaned closer “but first we should write down a list of the things you are willing to do with me” he smirked mischievously.<br/>
<em>In what kind of mess he got himself into.</em></p>
