    <p>I was formally known as Harry Potter almost 800 years ago. The only thing that the mortals that live now remember me for is the defeat of the Dark Lord Voldemort. I have been given so many titles over my immortal lifetime they’re really starting to get annoying and redundant.</p><p> </p><p>The main titles I have are The Boy Who Lived, The Boy Who Died Twice, The Chosen One, Defeater of Voldemort and the Master of Death. The last came about thanks to me owning and reuniting the Deathly Hallows that belonged to my ancestors so long ago.</p><p> </p><p>I changed my last name to Evans in honor of my mother. I got my eyes fixed and am 6 foot 2, so I’m not short. Everyone I once knew is now dead, I even miss Draco’s snarkyness.</p><p> </p><p>My titles besides Potter are Lord Black, Gryffindor, Slytherin by conquest, Peverell by Blood and Emrys.</p><p> </p><p>I’m getting bored here in this part of the world. The mortals here are relying too much on me to solve their problems. Now I see how Nicolas Flamel felt before he and his wife Perenell moved on to the next great adventure. I spoke to him after Lord Voldemort was destroyed. He gave me the notes to create a Philosopher's Stone if I ever wished to do so. He was 696 years of age when he died with his wife by his side. After their deaths, I decided to destroy the original stone by blowing it up with the Elder Wand. This was done in a far off clearing of the Forbidden Forest. After I was sure that the stone was destroyed and couldn’t be found by anyone, I took the notes with me, put them in a trunk and went off to Gringots.</p><p> </p><p>I decided to put them in the Peverell vault since it had such high security on it. After their deaths, I lived my life with Ginny and our kids, though I was not completely happy. Yes I loved her, but I was not in love with her. She was my wife, but not my true soulmate. I’m bisexual so I swing both ways, but I prefer men. I have great great great grandchildren so I know my line won’t ever die. I watched my children grow up; I did the same for my grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc.</p><p> </p><p>My children and grandchildren know about dark magic, but they do not use it to harm innocent people for any reason. When my family members learned to use dark magic, I made sure that they always summoned me to be their primary tutor so that they don’t fall into its allure and lose their humanity to it. I’ve been lucky that I’ve not had to take any of my family’s lives because of it. The 3 times I was witness to it, the elders of that specific branch of the family took care of it for me. What they did I was aware and approved of. All I’ll say is that the offenders had their magic bound for a time until I could cleanse them of their darkness.</p><p> </p><p>I’ve been lucky that this country has not had any more dark lords or ladies come to power. I have been called to other parts of the world to help them deal with uprisings if Horcruxes or other forms of truly black magic were involved. The countries have their own aurors and other forces to deal with evil, but they do not have the knowledge I do thanks to my life experiences. There have been a few Horcruxes that were created while I’ve been alive, but no one’s crossed the line that Voldemort did. They lost some of their humanity, but they did not become snakelike creatures thanks to the rituals they used.</p><p> </p><p>Whenever a Horcrux was found, I’d be called to deal with it unless I was unavailable. This was perfectly fine for the first 200 years or so. When I was not needed, I was in the shadows making sure that my family and the rest of the mortals were fine. Yes, a few mortal upstarts tried to take my wand, but every one that tried died or was turned into a Muggle by my hand. Did I like it? No, but the less people knew about its existence, the better.</p><p> </p><p>For the next 200 years, I tried to stay in the shadows, but I was not always successful. The mortals were becoming lazier and lazier. They called for me to deal with some of theirs that were starting to go dark, but had not truly crossed that line yet. This was fine for the most part. I was lucky that none of those who I was asked to deal with were members of my family. Life was like this until now. Defeat the occasional dark witch or wizard, get the accolades and praises of the world a few more times. After the last mission that involved a dark lord in East China, I knew I needed to leave somewhere where my name and numerous titles meant nothing to anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Where it was, I was unsure of. Maybe somewhere in America. Maybe Chicago, New York or Los Angeles. The cities were more than big enough where I could easily get lost among the people who lived there. I’d go soon. I had all of my affairs taken care of</p><p> </p><p>It was 2 days later that I took an international portkey to the outskirts of Chicago. As soon as I got there, I noticed something was seriously wrong with the magic here. It is making me feel ill; I need to tone down my senses so I don’t throw up on any of the mortals that are here.</p><p> </p><p>The city’s nice. I’ve not been out of the UK all that often. It is different here. I need to get a new wardrobe so I don’t stand out. Should I dress straight or gay? I choose the second. I had my life so long ago with Ginny and other women after she died. Now it is time for me to get chased by guys.</p><p> </p><p>When I got to a nearby store, I got skinny jeans in muted colors that wouldn’t make me look gay unless you knew what you were looking for. The short and long sleeve shirts I picked out were in different colors. Some were in green to match my eyes. I went ahead and got new shoes, socks and the other stuff. Gringots of the UK had given me a credit card that was tied to all of my vaults.</p><p> </p><p>After I was done shopping, I went to a furniture store to buy a complete set for either an apartment or condo. I paid with the same card. The people would be over to my new place to set up the furniture as soon as I called for them. I went to a hidden alley and shrunk my clothes and shoes. Now it was time for me to find either an apartment or condo so I could call this place home.</p><p> </p><p>I walked through the city and found a nice apartment complex. I sensed different humanoid creatures in the complex, so this would be a perfect place for me to live. When I got there, the manager met me at the front door.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“Good morning, sir. Are you here to rent?”</p><p>“Do you have free apartments?”</p><p>“Yes. I have one that is on the second floor.”</p><p>“Does it have a working phone line?”</p><p>“No, sir. Why do you need one; if I may ask?”</p><p>“I ordered furniture to be delivered.”</p><p>“I shall call them from here. The apartment number will be 204. Do you have their number?”</p><p>“Yes I do, sir. Thank you.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>I handed him the card that had the number for the furniture store. He put it on speaker phone. I told them who I was, and that I had found an apartment to rent.</p><p> </p><p>The manager gave them the address and the number of the apartment where I’d be staying. They told us they’d be here in maybe 45 minutes. This would be more than enough time for me to get a tour of the complex and the apartment where I’d be living.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>As the manager and I walked on a tour of the complex, I extended my senses out. I thought I’d felt magical creatures that lived here. I felt a hybrid vampire thing, a few werewolves and some sort of unknown Fae or Fairy. The Fae was different than the Fairies I knew of, but it did have powers of its own.</p><p> </p><p>I decided to buy the building out, keep the manager on staff and put up wards of protection so the creatures that live here are safe, same for me, considering my position in the world. A few minutes later, I saw a magical user with an unknown dog. The man was acting overly gay and trying way too hard. Why this was, I wasn’t sure of. After the man was let into the apartment that he was in front of, the manager took me to the one across from that one and showed it to me.</p><p> </p><p>It was spacious with 2 bedrooms, bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room, and a huge living room. A few minutes after the tour of my apartment was over, I heard 3 knocks on the door. It was the people from the store who had my furniture. I let them in and watched as they put the furniture that I’d bought together in the separate rooms.</p><p> </p><p>After a few hours, they were done. The manager who’d given me the tour had left after I started moving my stuff in. I told him that I needed to talk to him after the people took off. He told me where his office was. After some time, I joined him there.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“Good afternoon, sir. Do you like the look of your new apartment?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you. I was hoping I could talk to the building manager.”</p><p>“Why? Is there something wrong with the complex?”</p><p>“Not at all. I like the look of it. I was hoping to buy it out to start investing in properties in this general area.”</p><p>“Am I out of a job, Mr., um...”</p><p>“I am Harry Evans. So Mr. Evans is fine.”</p><p>“Alright. Am I out of a job, Mr. Evans?”</p><p>“Not at all. I’ll let you keep doing what you are now; I’ll just own the building.”</p><p>“So keep your name out of any dealings I have with the other people who live here?”</p><p>“Unless it is really important, yes.”</p><p>“You got it, Mr. Evans. To buy out the building, it will be $455,000.”</p><p>“Not a problem.”</p><p>“what?”</p><p>“I said, I can give you a card that has the money, or I can get it in cash for you.”</p><p>“You have that kind of money just lying around?”</p><p>“Yes. That’s none of your business, though.”</p><p>“Of course not. I’ll take the card. I don’t need trucks coming here with mountains of cash and making this a more noticeable place than it already is.”</p><p>“Here’s my card.”</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>I handed him the card I’d gotten from Gringots. I also handed him my ID, though it was registered in the UK, not US. A few minutes later, the transaction was done.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“So nothing will change, Mr. Evans?”</p><p>“Nothing at all. I’ll just jointly own the building with; who is the building manager?”</p><p>“I am, Mr. Evans. Thank you for taking a load off of me financially.”</p><p>“Of course. If you don’t mind, I’m going to get some food. I’m starving.”</p><p>“May I recommend McAnally’s Pub? It has been in this general area for what seems like forever...”</p><p>“Do you have directions?”</p><p>“Give me a few seconds and I’ll have them for you.”</p><p>“Thanks."</p><p> </p><p>A few seconds later, he handed me a paper with the requested information. It gave me the name and address of the restaurant. It also told me how long it would take me to get there from here if I walked. I smiled at him and took off. When I got to a secluded area of the apartment complex, I apparated to the restaurant keeping the address in mind.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as I got there, I saw a sign out front. It listed the restaurant’s name which I already knew. It also said something about the place being Neutral Territory, whatever that meant. I went inside to sit at a table. A few seconds later, a man handed me a menu. I spent a few minutes going through it. I didn’t recognize anything on it, however. I went up to the bar where the man was and spoke quietly.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“Good afternoon, sir. I’ve never been to the US before today, so all of the food on the menu is completely new to me.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Give me something you think I’d like, if you don’t mind."</p><p> </p><p>He nodded at me and took the menu from my hand. I went to sit back down at the chair I was in before. We seemed to have the whole place to ourselves for now. A few minutes later, he came to my table with a steak sandwich, fries, and an ice cold coke. I smiled at him in thanks. He nodded back at me. As soon as the first bite of the steak and other seasonings touched my mouth, I nearly came in my trousers right then and there. He smirked at my reaction, then went back to the bar. Damn, this food was wonderful.</p><p> </p><p>This gives the Three Broomsticks or any other restaurant in Diagon Alley serious competition. This would be my go to spot for food if I didn’t want to cook for myself. After almost an hour, I was done. I handed him a $20 bill. I’d gotten some money out while I was buying my new wardrobe and furniture.</p><p> </p><p>I smiled at him to let him know that he could keep the change. He smiled at me. I took off back to my new home. Yes, I was the Master of Death, but even I couldn’t deal with such abrupt time zone changes. I rested for the rest of the day.</p>
