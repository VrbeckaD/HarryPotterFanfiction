<p>
  <span>A cat sitting next to his fence was nothing new for Dudley. Since Holly and Ivy had started to feed every stray cat they found it was a daily occurrence that at least three of them sat there. Somehow the cats always found them, even if the girls stopped feeding them near their house. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But something about this cat made Dudley frown. It didn't move, neither did the cat blink or even twitch as it watched him coming it's way to pick up the newspaper. It just stared at him, as if he had done something he shouldn't have done. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Whatever it is, I'm sorry. Just so you know.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had no idea why he had said that, especially to a cat. But her looks reminded him of the nun that taught at his old school and he shivered at that memory. When he turned around he could swear he heard a huff coming from the cat, but on second thought it was probably only a sneeze. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Closing the door behind him he decided to send the girls out if the cat was still there when they woke up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But first, he had to prepare breakfast while planning a birthday party. Holly's birthday was tomorrow and neither him nor Sarah had any idea what to do with a bunch of prepubescent girls for an entire day. </span>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley sat on the stairs in front of his house and watched as his girls tried to find out why the cat was sitting there. She hadn't moved one inch since he picked up the newspaper this morning. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>By now they knew it was a she, at least that's what Holly had told him, and usually she was right. She had always had a thing for animals of any kind and he had stopped wondering about it long ago. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>So far the cat was a mystery, she refused to eat what the girls had brought her, neither did she drink the stinky cat milk nor the water. She also wasn't a big fan of getting pet, looking positively suffering as the girls touched her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After some time it got boring for Ivy and she went to jump on their trampoline, using the few hours before it got too hot outside. Holly, on the other hand, just crossed her legs on the ground and seemingly started a staring competition with the cat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley chuckled as he stood up, deciding the cat wouldn't harm his girl, and went inside to sneak up on Sarah and maybe steal something of the cake frosting for him and the girls. </span>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So, what's it with the cat?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Dudley had taken over the cake decorating, giving Sarah the time to sit down at their kitchen table to lick the spoon clean without getting caught. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't know. She's not looking like trouble and Holly started a staring contest with her when I came inside.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She has a funny drawing on her face, don't you think? It looks a bit like she's wearing glasses,” Sarah chuckled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, she reminds me of that cranky nun in my old school…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, you told me ‘bout her. Spooky. I'm sure she'll get bored soon. It's not like we have anything to entertain her here and just so you know, we won't keep her!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know. If you'll excuse me now, there is some frosting left and I'm going to steal it and eat it with our girls.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Before Sarah could do as much as to drop her spoon, Dudley had ran off with the frosting bowl and a mad chuckle, calling for the kids as he reached their front door. </span>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The sun stood high in the sky, mercilessly burning down onto them, and staying outside wasn't an option anymore. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But what troubled him was that the cat still hadn't moved away, looking towards their house as if she waited for something interesting to happen. Dudley was worried she wouldn't survive the heat but he had no idea what to do. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why won't she move, dad? It's too hot for her out there, but she's not looking for a shadowy spot…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't know, Lolly.” Furrowing his brows he joined her at the window and once again looked at the cat. “Do you think I can borrow the small table from your room? We could place it over her, at least like that she'd be in the shadow.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Great idea, dad! I'll clear it, give me a second!” Holly ran off and seconds later he heard loud noises coming from the room upstairs. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When his daughter called for him he forced his eyes away from the cat and walked upstairs to fetch the small table, not entirely sure he wanted to see the demolished room. Holly surely just swept everything on it to the floor in her mission to save the cat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And that was exactly what he found in the room. After ordering her to clean up the mess she made, he picked up the table, nearly stumbling over a bunch of magazines, as he made his way out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The few steps from his door to where the cat sat had him already sweating and he examined her before stepping closer. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, so don't be scared, but I really don't want you to die here. I'll place this table over you because you seemingly have a very important mission and won't move. So please don't freak out, this is only for your safety.” Chiding himself for talking to a cat, he huffed and carefully placed the table over her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After his work was done he bent down to look at her, taking the risk she'd jump at his face. “You alright there buddy? Yes? Good kitty. Just stay as long as you please.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This was the first time the cat actually blinked at him, and Dudley swore he could hear another huff before—the stupid cat stood up and left. Without turning back once. </span>
