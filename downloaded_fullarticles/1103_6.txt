    <p>When Harry opened his eyes he was only to be met with darkness.</p><p> </p><p>Darkness wasn't an unusual thing to Harry, seeing that he was going blind for year or two. But even he could tell that this darkness was different than the usual darkness. The usual darkness was just that: darkness. This darkness was different, different in the way that it was heavy. The normal darkness wasn't heavy, it just filled with the foreboding feeling of blindness and never seeing light again. This darkness wasn't like that. If Harry could put a name to it, he would call protective? No, it wasn't protective but something more.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever it was Harry had to put in the back of his mind and focus on the now. And the now it said that he needs to get his sight back.</p><p> </p><p>He closed his eyes and prayed to whatever god was listening that he could see when he opens them up again.</p><p> </p><p>He took a deep breath and opened his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing he notes was the dimming sunlight, the second thing he noted was how quiet the house was, and the third thing he was not the fact his bedroom door was wide open.</p><p> </p><p>Harry tilted his head, much like Hedwig does, and took further note of the third thing. The door was open, wide open. It looked as though locks on the door were ripped off or ripped open. The hinges looked fine and so did the doorknob. So what happened?</p><p> </p><p>Harry took a step forward only for his legs to give out. Looking down at them he saw large bruises covering legs and large spots where the skin was rubbed raw. His ankles were a swollen and bright pink color. Dudley used his legs as a bounce house. It wouldn't be a surprise with they were broken in some way.</p><p> </p><p>He signed and looked back to the door. The outside of the door – the part of the door that faces the hallway – was covered in scratches, some deeper than others, but nonetheless, there were scratches all over his door.</p><p> </p><p>He turned quickly to Hedwig who was sleeping peacefully, unbothered by the attack on his door. Her head was tucked underneath her wing without care and Harry was happy with that. It meant whatever attacked his door was no danger to him. Hedwig would never sleep through if something was dangerous to her chick.</p><p> </p><p>The newly turned thirteen-year old took a deep breath and stepped through the threshold of his room and into the rest of the house.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing past the pain and toward the unusual scene.</p><p> </p><p>At first, nothing looked out of place.</p><p> </p><p>The hallway rug was fine and as straight as an arrow. All the bedroom doors were shut like normal. The curtains were closed like normal, and if weren't the missing snores of the male Dursleys, Harry would have thought everything was fine.</p><p> </p><p>But the snores were missing.</p><p> </p><p>It left the house in a weird moment.</p><p> </p><p>A pure quiet moment.</p><p> </p><p>So rare for Harry especially at Dursleys.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't dare breath. It was like he stepped into a twilight moment – from the Twilight Zone – at least he thought that's what the show was called that.</p><p> </p><p>He took a careful step forward suddenly thankful that Aunt Petunia hated squeaky floorboards.</p><p> </p><p>The upstairs looked fine, though he didn't look into any rooms, so he headed downstairs. Using the wall as a crutch. Just like the floorboards in the hallway, all the squeaky boards on the stairs were removed, and Harry moved down the stairs like a ghost. His breath barely more then a puff of air, his feet moved like they were gliding on ice, and his body tense like a tripwire. Just waiting for the sign to run up the stairs and grab Hedwig.</p><p> </p><p>The sign to run back upstairs was on the wall.</p><p> </p><p>It was a note.</p><p> </p><p>Pinned to the wall with a pretty dagger – Harry must say so himself – through the top of it was a note. The note its self was short and to the point, something Harry was quite happy about, but the fact the note was in the house meant something was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>A note pinned to a wall by a most likely magical dagger in a house filled with magic-hating muggles.</p><p> </p><p>Harry bit his lip as he read the note.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dear Harry,</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I am a friend of your parents and I have finally found you after years of searching.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I have found your placement with the magic-hating Petunia Dursley nee Evans, her husband and her spawn, unsatisfactory.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I have left this note with the hope you will contact me.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If you do not contact me – I will find no fault in that. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>But if you are ever in danger or in dire need of aid; do not be afraid to use the dagger on your enemies or be afraid to call for me.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If you ever need me or do decide to contact me; just say these words.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I, Harry James Potter, wish for the aid of the Labyrinth and that of its rightful Ruler.”</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Take Care, The Ruler of the Labyrinth.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Well, it wasn't as upfront as Harry would have wanted, but beggars can't be choosers and Harry was the beggar.</p><p> </p><p>He put thought to what the letter said.</p><p> </p><p>The Dursleys weren't ever nice to the black haired teen, but the last three years were starting to get dangerous. Very dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>His back still ached from when Uncle Vernon took his belt to it. His arm ached from when Dudley grabbed it and pulled him to ground before stepping on said arm. His head had pain ringing through it from two different reasons, one was from the frying pan that Aunt Petunia his it with and the other was from his scar. Said scar had been aching all summer but hit its peak on his birthday. Not to mention his legs.</p><p> </p><p>The beating fed his nightmares, more then Quirrell-Mort, Tom Riddle, and his attack snake, ever will.</p><p> </p><p>He should probably worry about where the letter came from. Harry didn't care though, the letter promised to get him out. He didn't know if another chance like this will come up again, so as the sunlight faded from the sky, Harry called for the unknown person.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
