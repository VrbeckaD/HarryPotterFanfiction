          <div class="userstuff"><p>It hurts. Why wont she do it with Dud? Why is it me who she has to take away?</p><p>Why can't it be someone else?</p><p>I am so tired of it.</p><p>So , very , tired.</p><p>And it hurts like hell. I just want it to stop. I want her to stop.</p><p>I should just run away. But where will I get food? Everyone hates me already. And where will i go? Can 10 year olds even get jobs?</p><p>Will sanyone let me do their gardening work?</p><p>No.</p><p>They will hate how skinny i am like uncle and aunt do.</p><p>And they will beat me too.</p><p>It could be worse than uncle Vernon's beatings. The wound i got the last time he beat me still hurts. I shouldn't have told him about it. I shouldn't tell anyone about it. What if they think I am lying too , and beat me , senseless?</p><p>They might beat me up and lock me , or worse, they might bring me back here and then both uncle and aunt will be very unhappy with me.</p><p>I shouldn't have told uncle Vernon. What if he tells aunt Petunia ?</p><p>She might beat me senseless and make me sit on the broom again. It still bleeds sometimes.</p><p>And it burns everytime I pee. It is better if i just stop thinking about it.</p><p>Think about something else Harry. Like... going to a school. Yes! That would be great right?</p><p>Getting to go to a school. But not in the same school as dud, because then aunt might still meet me and make me do things again.</p><p>Maybe somewhere far away. I might make new friends.</p><p>But what if they are the same as dud and play Harry hunting too?</p><p>And what about the teachers? They might want to do the same things as aunt they all cant be like her can they? But what if they are?</p><p>No. Think about something else , something different. Ummmmm...Mrs Figg's pussy cats? Yes , they are all so big. And they are so violent. I get scratches everytime she makes me feed them. Why can't they eat on their own? . Why do I have to? Didn't aunt Petunia say she was going to make me eat her pussy? Cats must taste bad , right? But we don't have any cats. Is she gonna bring one home today?</p><p>I really hope she does not bring a cat. Or make me feed it. Or make me eat any one of them. Or make me do things that she always wants to do. Why can't she just stop? I hate it. I am terrified of that stuff. She should just stop. She tortures me so much.</p><p>This is not normal right? Or , is it?</p><p>But she doesn't do any of the things she does with me, with Dud. Why does it have to be me? Its wrong. Uncle Vernon said as much , when I told him about it , the other day. He said those are very bad things and I shouldn't talk about it ever. Right?</p><p>But then why does she have to do it with me?</p><p>I want it to stop happening. But... Do I , really? Because I think I am starting to like it...</p></div>
