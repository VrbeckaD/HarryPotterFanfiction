    <p>Dear Mister Lupin</p>
<p>I’m writing to you because my friend Hagrid says you used to know my father.</p>
<p>
  <strike>I don’t know much </strike>
</p>
<p>
  <strike>The Dursleys never </strike>
</p>
<p>I was wondering if you might be able to tell me something about him? Or maybe you have some pictures I could borrow to have a look at if it's not too much trouble? I started Hogwarts this year and found out about the wizarding world and I would really like to know more about my parents. If you don’t want to write to me about my father, do you think you know anyone else he knew that I could write to?</p>
<p>With regards</p>
<p>Harry Potter</p>
