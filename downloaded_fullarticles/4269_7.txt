    <p>The werewolf looked as if he hadn’t bathed or shaved since Black had fallen through the veil. His hair was a matted mess which would have embarrassed even James Potter and puffy, bloodshot eyes peered out of a face covered with scruffy stubble. His expression was haunted. He was surrounded by empty firewhisky bottles, and the whole cottage stank of unwashed flesh.</p>
<p>He was also nearly naked. The only item of clothing he wore was a faded pair of checked boxer shorts. His skin was covered with scars – there were so many across his chest that the hair seemed to grow only in patches. But underneath the muscles were firm. His legs were long and his hips slighly bony. And he seemed entirely unselfconscious about his state of undress.<br/>

“Severus?” Lupin said hesitantly, as if two weeks in a drunken stupor had robbed him of the ability to recognise his colleagues. There was a slight slur to his voice, confirming Snape’s assessment that Lupin was still drunk.</p>
<p>“Lupin, you look and smell as if you’ve bathed in hippogriff urine.”</p>
<p>Lupin flinched, and Snape realised the reference to hippogriffs was probably interpreted as a dig at Black and his pet.</p>
<p>“Come to gloat then, Severus? I’m really not in the mood.”</p>
<p>He turned away and Snape definitely didn’t look at the scarred, muscled back and tight buttocks. Nor did Snape watch as Lupin leaned down to rummage in the back of a cupboard, or as he stood again, clutching a vial in one hand and unconsciously scratching his balls with the other.</p>
<p>“Knew I had some Sober-up potion somewhere.”</p>
<p>Lupin downed the contents of the vial then stood blinking at Snape. Eventually he sighed.</p>
<p>“Don’t suppose you have any hangover potion on you, do you Severus?”</p>
<p>“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Lupin, go and clean yourself up and put some clothes on.”</p>
<p>Lupin shuffled out the back door and began to splash water over his face from a basin in the makeshift bathroom beside the back step. He walked over to what appeared to be an old-fashioned privy, then reappeared a few minutes later. He retrieved his wand and cast a few cleaning charms over himself before running a comb through his hair.</p>
<p>He returned inside and turned his back to Snape, pulling clean underwear from a drawer. As if Snape wasn’t even in the room, he simply pulled off the old boxer shorts and replaced them with a clean, but equally faded, pair before pulling on trousers and a crumpled shirt. Snape turned his back, grateful that his robe hid the fact that he found the sight of Lupin’s bare arse more appealing than he should have.</p>
<p>Lupin made himself a cup of coffee, boiling the water by tapping his wand on the side of a mug and scooping in an excessive amount of cheap instant coffee.  He drank it unsweetended and black, making a face at the flavour. He drank about half the cup before turning his attention back to Snape.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason you are here, Severus? It seems an awfully long way to come just to insult me, even for you.”</p>
<p>Snape pulled a bottle from his robe and placed it on the bench.</p>
<p>“Albus asked me to make it for you. Well, told me. I wasn’t given a choice.”</p>
<p>Lupin looked dubiously at the bottle.</p>
<p>“Wolfsbane,” Snape added. “He was clearly worried you would do something stupid at the full moon in your… state.”</p>
<p>“He said that, did he?”</p>
<p>There was an undertone to Lupin’s voice, a unexpected hint of bitterness.</p>
<p>“He… his exact words, I believe, were “the poor boy is overwrought. I’m concerned. Having the Wolfsbane this month will help him to restore his equilibrium”.”</p>
<p>Lupin gave a slight snort.</p>
<p>“He didn’t happen to mention why he thought I was overwrought, did he? Or what he’s asked me to do?”</p>
<p>“No. I thought… well, Black.”</p>
<p>Lupin sighed and his shoulders sagged.</p>
<p>“And the rest of it,” he said.</p>
<p>“The rest of it?”</p>
<p>“Three days after Sirius has gone, and Albus tells me he’s got a mission for me. You know Fenrir Greyback? Or of him, at least. He’s aligned himself with Voldemort, and he’s been… recruiting. Albus wants me to go and join his pack, try and talk them around. I’m to leave after this full moon. Getting you to make the Wolfsbane is… I suppose it’s intended to be some sort of compensation.”</p>
<p>Lupin’s jaw was tense, his hands balled into fists.</p>
<p>“Are you scared to go, Lupin? Don’t like the company of your own kind?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly, Severus, no. Well, yes and no.”</p>
<p>“It’s a war, Lupin. We all have to do things we don’t want to do.”</p>
<p>“You think I don’t know that, Severus?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the werewolf was in Snape’s face, breath smelling of cheap coffee and his lip curled into a snarl.</p>
<p>“I’ve done everything he’s asked of me, I’ve put my life on the line more times than I care to remember, through two wars. I’ve done all the nasty little jobs that he won’t mention at the Order meetings because I know I’m lucky to even be at the table, but this… this is… Merlin’s arse, Fenrir fucking Greyback. I have to grovel at the feet of the bastard who turned me. I was four. Four years old, and he turned me into this monster. That’s who Albus wants me to cosy up to.”</p>
<p>Lupin was shaking now, closer to losing control than Snape had ever seen him. It was a frightening thought, seeing such a calm man pushed to the edge. But that’s what Dumbledore did. He would ask whatever he thought was necessary, without flinching, whatever it cost the person he asked it from. Snape knew that only too well.</p>
<p>“Pull yourself together, Lupin,” Snape said, but his voice was less harsh than he intended it to be. The close proximity of the man he’d wanted for years was having an uncomfortable effect on him. He wanted to be even closer, and he took a step forward without realising what he was doing. He lifted one hand to Lupin’s arm.</p>
<p>Lupin went very still and Snape could feel tense muscles under his fingers.<br/>
<br/>
“Lupin, I…”.</p>
<p>He tried, but he had no idea what to say.</p>
<p>“I know, Severus,” Lupin said softly. “You understand. You’re the only one who could. Going back to Voldemort, time and again.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say his name.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>Then Lupin leaned into him, and before Snape quite knew what was happening they were wrapped in eachothers arms. Lupin’s strong arms were tight around him and his soft lips were brushing against his neck. He tilted his head slightly and slid one hand down Lupin’s back, pressing the bony hips closer and rubbing his already firm erection against Lupin’s thigh. Then they were falling onto Lupin’s bed and Snape was pulling at Lupin’s clothes and thrusting his hips and whimpering with need. Lupin reached up and unbuttoned his shirt and then his trousers, sliding them down over his hips and then doing the same for Snape. He took Snape’s cock in his hand then leaned over to whisper in Snape’s ear.</p>
<p>“Do you want to fuck me, Severus?”</p>
<p>Snape made a sound which was intended to be “yes” but was more of an incoherent moan. Lupin twisted himself around and offered Snape his back and buttocks. Snape suddenly stilled, hesitating. After wanting Lupin for so long, he felt unsure of what to do with him.</p>
<p>After a long moment, Lupin grabbed his wand and murmured a few words. Snape felt his erection slick with lubricant and realised with relief that Lupin had prepared himself. And then Snape was urgently, desperately penetrating him, hands scrabbling at Lupin’s shirt, hips thrusting, breath panting. He had come before he really knew it was happening, giving an inarticulate cry and collapsing across Lupin’s back. He could feel Lupin taking care of himself, but couldn’t bring himself to reach forward and help him.</p>
<p>When Lupin came with a long shudder and a soft whimper, Snape stood up abruptly, suddenly feeling dirty and ashamed. He grabbed for his wand and cast a vicious scourgify over both of them. It felt like sandpaper on his genitals and evidently had the same effect on Lupin, who jumped and gave a startled squawk.</p>
<p>“Ow, Severus, what the hell?” he said, giving Snape a wounded look. “You don’t use that for… intimate situations.”</p>
<p>Snape looked away, embarrassed, and began to rebutton his disarrayed clothes.</p>
<p>“Severus, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Lupin,” Snape snarled back.</p>
<p>Concern showing on his face, Lupin rose from the bed and reached towards Snape.</p>
<p>“You haven’t done this much, have you Severus?” he asked gently.</p>
<p>Snape was suddenly defensive, folding his arms across his chest.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Lupin? I have plenty of experience.”</p>
<p>Lupin frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it like… to imply… I just, well, you didn’t seem very confident in what you were doing, that’s all. And now you seem upset. I realise that I made some assumptions…”</p>
<p>“Assumptions, Lupin?”</p>
<p>“Well, I assumed you would prefer to top, but I realise I don’t know that. I don’t even really know whether you usually go with men or women. I… I hope…”</p>
<p>Lupin lifted his hand to Snape’s face.</p>
<p>“I, however, have no such uncertainty, Lupin. You are clearly a bottom, you’re so passive and spineless you’d just lie there and take it from anyone.”</p>
<p>Lupin withdrew his hand and crossed his arms, his face closing down.</p>
<p>“Statements like that, Severus, simply reinforce the impression that you don’t know a lot about sex. You talk as if it’s something that one person does to another, rather than something that two people share. It’s a rather… adolescent view of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s how it was with you and Black, was it, Lupin? Rather than just you taking it up the arse. That’s what they used to say about you at school, you know. That you took it up the arse for Black and Potter. And Pettigrew.”</p>
<p>There was a flickering of emotion in Lupin’s eyes and Snape wondered if he had actually succeeded in angering the implacable werewolf twice in one day. But then Lupin sighed instead.</p>
<p>“Sirius and I weren’t… it wasn’t… there wasn’t ever anything sexual between us. Between any of us. Not that it’s any of your business, Severus.”</p>
<p>“So the fact you followed Black around like a whipped puppy? That was just because you enjoyed his company as a <em>friend</em>?”</p>
<p>Lupin gave another sigh. His face was suddenly sad.</p>
<p>“Does it make you happy, Severus? Hurting people?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You lash out at the least excuse – Harry, Sirius, me… I don’t understand you. Do you enjoy being hurtful? Do you get something from it?”</p>
<p>Snape stepped back, searching for his next barb. He remembered this from the year they had taught together, that when it came to verbal sparring the werewolf was cunning and inventive, taking the conversation through convoluted twists and turns which could easily throw him off balance.</p>
<p>“Or is it a case of hurting others before they hurt you? Is that it, Severus? You’re just trying to protect yourself?”</p>
<p>Snape straightened his posture and fixed Lupin with a glare.</p>
<p>“I merely state the truth, Lupin. Unlike you.”</p>
<p>Lupin had the grace to look slightly ashamed, and Snape went for the jugular.</p>
<p>“Did it every cross your mind, Lupin, that in your fear of stating the truth because it might hurt people, you have ended up hurting people more?”</p>
<p>Lupin dropped his head and gave a sigh.</p>
<p>“That irony had not escaped me, Severus. It’s been a painful realisation, but one that I am now aware of. It’s one reason that I’m trying to do things differently now.”</p>
<p>He gave another sigh, then looked up with a determined expression on his face. He straighened his shoulders slightly, and spoke again.</p>
<p>“So, in that spirit – did it ever cross your mind, Severus, that by hurting others in order to protect yourself from being hurt, you are actually causing yourself more suffering, not less? You may not think so, but there are people who care about you. You could have friends, Severus. But you just drive everyone away, don’t you. Never letting anyone in.”</p>
<p>That silenced Snape. The comment was brutally close to the truth and for a moment he could only gape in reply. When he saw the look of concern return to Lupin’s face, he knew he had to get out of there. He took a step backwards and gestured to the bottle where it sat on the bench.</p>
<p>“You should drink some of the potion. Since I went to the trouble...”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course, Severus. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Snape turned and fled.</p>
