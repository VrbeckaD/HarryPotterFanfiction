    <p>Since the first day Fleur Delacour entered Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament, she had felt a draw towards England and Scotland. Something, instinct maybe, was telling her that she needed to be there. Despite the weather and the turmoil of the tournament, Fleur had been unusually happy that school year. Being part Veela, Fleur trusted in her instincts, and with the approval of her grandmother soon found a job at Gringotts so she could stay in the country. Time passed, and she grew to be close friends with Bill Weasley.</p><p>Throughout her childhood Fleur had been entranced by the stories her grandmother told her about Veela love. How she would eventually find her mate, her one true love, and would know instinctively upon meeting him or her, once she was of age. How she would bond with them, complete the three stages of the ritual to bind their very souls together. Her grandmother told grand tales of how Fleur would be finally complete, how her heart would sing the most beautiful of melodies for her magic to dance to with its mate.</p><p>Fleur dreamed of this, and everyday her eyes would dance around Gringotts, searching and hoping that it was her day. That she would gaze upon someone, look into their eyes and feel the magic she had been imagining since childhood. Instinct told her that it would be soon, demanded that she stay in England.</p><p>As time passed, Fleur became more and more discouraged as her mate refused to surface. Her heart ached more than ever, it yearned for someone, but she did not know who. Bill’s attentions grew further from platonic and at first Fleur half-heartedly refused his advances. She wanted something more, she wanted her mate.</p><p>Bill was so dear to her as a friend, so she tried to feel something more for him. His kisses were soft and kind, lips slightly chapped but gentle. She felt safe with him, and told herself that it was enough. She told herself this so often she began to believe it. The war was advancing and Fleur did not have all the time in the world to wait for her mate. She needed to take whatever happiness she could now. With a sad smile and a sinking feeling in her heart, Fleur agreed to marry Bill Weasley.</p><p>She didn’t questioned her decision, especially after the few days that summer when she had stayed at the Burrow. Something about those few days, as boring and mundane as they were, made her happier and she felt more complete than she had in some time. Spending time with Bill, his parents and siblings, and of course Harry and Hermione, she felt complete.</p><p>The night Albus Dumbledore died, Fleur knew something was wrong. She paced nervously, her skin itching with excess energy. Something was happening, she felt it in her bones. She needed to be somewhere. She was gathering her things to leave, to go somewhere other than her home, when the silvery form of a Patronus reached her, telling her of Dumbledore’s fate and Bill’s injury.</p><p>She rushed to Bill’s side, anguish in her heart at the thought of him being hurt. She was relieved to hear he wouldn’t develop lycanthropy, but she would have loved him all the same if he had. They shared a tearful reunion and she brought him home to recover.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore’s funeral was a somber affair, as it should be. Fleur was dressed impeccably in inky black dress robes out of respect for the late headmaster. She supported Bill as they hobbled to the seats. The ceremony was beautiful, all types of magic paying tribute to the noble wizard. She burrowed her face in Bill’s shoulder, shielding herself from the reality and taking comfort in his embrace. Tears in her eyes, Fleur looked around, surveying the attendees. Madame Maxine was bawling in Hagrid’s arms, and Fleur made a note to comfort her former headmistress after the ceremony.</p><p>Her gaze swept over more familiar faces, all pinched in grief. Harry looked like he was on the verge of either killing himself or someone else. His rage and grief were much more evident on his face than his scar had even been. Ron’s usually pale complexion was as red as his hair, freckles blending in perfectly with his rosy cheeks, and small tear tracks gleamed in the sunlight. Hermione was….</p><p>Fleur’s heart stopped in her chest as her breath caught in her throat. She couldn’t breathe. All it once her heart started again, a rapid beat pounding through her ears as she gasped for breath. Hermione….It was as if Fleur had gotten glasses and was truly seeing for the first time. Everything was clear as crystal now, the colors and the world itself more vibrant than she had ever remembered, Hermione shining brighter than any of the stars in the sky.</p><p>Fleur was exhilarated, she had found her mate, her intended. A small voice in the back of her head questioned this and a thousand other things. Surely she would have known about Hermione before now. Why hadn’t she recognized their connection during the Triwizard Tournament, or during the summer at the Burrow? The Veela reassured her, all would be fine in the end. Now was not the time for such trivial worries, it was time for celebration. Her magic seemed to leap from her body, bounding towards the one girl whose magic would complete its own.</p><p>Hermione felt something strange and she gasped audibly as she felt her magic leave her body unbidden. Fleur thought that Hermione’s simple breath of air was more enchanting than the Siren song of her ancestors. Hermione looked up towards Fleur and as their gazes met, their magic did as well. Brown met blue and Fleur felt like the Gryffindor was staring into her soul. Hermione was transfixed by Fleur, the beauty before her somehow not apparent until that very moment. She was in awe. Both could do nothing but stare as a flash of golden light stretched between the two with a mighty crack!</p><p>The commotion drew the attention of the crowd towards the two women, who still stood, simply staring silently at one another. “Er uh… Mione? Are you okay?” Ron said, reaching out to nudge the shoulder of the unresponsive girl. Hermione jumped at the unexpected contact, but stilled again as an unearthly snarl left Fleur’s lips. One thought ran through her mind, no one touches <em>her mate. </em>Ron snatched back his hand and a look of shock crossed his face. He took one step back from Hermione, and then stopped, staring at the two women in utter confusion.</p><p>All the guests of the funeral were silent now, watching the proceedings in front of them. Bill, seeing Fleur in this state, knew exactly what was happening. She had told him about Veela mates, shared with him details about her heritage that he knew he was privileged to know. Bill sighed in resignation and turned away, begrudgingly accepting of the turn of events but unwilling to watch as his love found hers.</p><p>Like magnets, they gravitated towards each other. Both moved together until they met in the middle, as one. Fleur’s hand cupped Hermione’s cheek and she wrapped an arm around the shorter girl’s waist as Hermione’s knees threatened to buckle underneath her. “Fleur...” a single word left Hermione’s lips, and it occurred to Fleur that no one had ever spoken her name quite like Hermione did. The brunette lost consciousness, crumpling into Fleur’s strong arms.</p><p>“Mon amour…. Je t’aime,” Fleur murmured quietly into the brunette’s unruly curls. Fleur lifted the Gryffindor bridal style, kissing her forehead once before looking around. Most of the guests simply stared, mouths gaping like fish. Minerva McGonagal was one of the few who seemed to have an inkling of what was going on, and she was torn between being extraordinarily happy for the pair and feeling protective over her prized pupil.</p><p>Harry characteristically tried to interfere and started towards Fleur. “Hey, what’s happening?” He got a snarl as a response, clearly telling him to stand back and for good measure she let one more growl out, this time at the crowd in general – a clear warning to them all. With a loud crack Fleur apparated herself and her sleeping mate back to her flat.</p><p>The crack of Fleur’s apparition seemed to break the spell silencing the crowd. Low murmurs spread across the crowd like wildfire. Harry turned to Ron, wide eyed and Ron shrugged in return. Minerva McGonagall sensed that someone needed to interfere, and took it upon herself to control the situation. Turning to the matriarch of the Weasley family, she beckoned her over.</p><p>“Molly, will you gather up your husband and family, along with Mr. Potter, and come with me to my office please? I have a feeling I know what just transpired, and you must all have questions.” Molly nodded, seemingly lost for words. The tips of her ears turned pink as she began herding her children and family towards the castle.</p><p>“Come along, all you of. To the headmistress’ office, off you go. Ronald, hold your tongue and hurry up.” Molly knew her youngest son was about to explode, and though she felt similar about the whole situation she knew that this was not the place for such an outburst.</p><p>Minerva walked briskly down the corridors as she made her way to her new office. Footsteps echoed through the hall as the Weasleys and Harry followed, struggling to keep up with her long stride. Speaking the password, “Snickers” to the stone gargoyle, she felt a pang of grief. Shaking her head to dispel the feeling, she entered her office.</p><p>The rest of the group filed in slowly and a few sat but most chose to stand, feeling awkward and confused as to why they were there. Bill lingered in the back of the room, not looking forward to having aspects of his private life aired for his family to hear. He was upset about losing his fiancée and didn’t exactly feel like discussing it this soon.</p><p>Clearing her throat and subtly gaining the attention of the room, Minerva started her explanation with a question. “What do you all know about Veela?” Her gaze rested on Bill, who looked up to meet her gaze sadly. An understanding passed between the two and Minerva realized that though Bill understood what had transpired, he would not be offering up any information.</p><p>Harry and Ron were feeling the absence of Hermione, still half expecting to see her hand rise in the air as she launched into a verbatim explanation of Veela. Neither of them had payed much attention in any of their classes during school, and Hagrid had never covered Veela in Care of Magical Creatures as they didn’t exactly fall into that category.</p><p>Feeling as if he had to say something, Harry offered up a feeble explanation. “I remember them from the quidditch world cup. They’re gorgeous and can put people in a sort of trance. And they turn into bird like things when angry. That’s all I know Professor.”</p><p>Minerva nodded, Harry’s explanation had been exactly what she was expecting out of chosen one. “Very good Mr. Potter. That is understandably the extent of most people’s knowledge of Veela. They are a quite secretive race, and you must understand that what I am about to tell you must be kept in confidence. I was once good friends with a Veela, who shared many secrets with me. I must beg of you to respect their privacy and keep this knowledge to yourselves.”</p><p>Minerva looked around the room sternly, her glare leaving no room for discussion. Everyone nodded, and she looked once more at Ron before continuing.</p><p>“Everyone is born with a soulmate, somewhere in the world someone exists whose soul completes yours. Veela have the ability to recognize and seek out this connection, and they are known simply as mates. When a Veela becomes of age, they will instinctively know and be set onto the path to meeting their one. Once a Veela meets his or her mate, their magic connects and the bonding process begins. I was not told exactly what that process entails. All I know is that the connection is physical, mental and magical. Mates cannot spend extended periods of time apart, and the Veela is extremely possessive and protective over their mate.”</p><p>Everyone in the room seemed to be processing the information. Ginny hadn’t been paying attention, she didn’t have any interest in anything to do with Phelgem and was struggling to catch up. Ron, unable to hold his tongue, said what all the others were thinking. “Wait! You don’t mean that Mione and Fleur…. they both like blokes! Fleur’s bloody engaged! To Bill!”</p><p>His face turned increasing red as more information processed in his mind. Molly was livid, looking to the back of the room towards her eldest son, expecting a reaction out of him similar to Ron. “Bill!” He avoided eye contact with his mother, cringing at the turn of events.</p><p>Minerva went to explain when Bill spoke up, resignation in his tone. “She’s right. Hermione is Fleur’s mate. I knew from the beginning that there was a chance she would find her mate and leave me. I obviously hoped she wouldn’t and we would stay together, but I can’t be mad or try to deny her happiness. I love her, and I know that she can never truly feel the same towards anyone but Hermione.”</p><p>Molly turned to her son, tears in her eyes and embraced him. “I’m so sorry Bill.” The others murmured matching condolences and seemed settled, other than Ron. “So where is Mione? She can’t be going along with this whole ‘mate’ thing. We’ve got to go find her and talk to her. C’mon Harry.” Ron made to head towards the door, grabbing Harry’s arm to hurry him along. Harry seemed torn between following his friend and listening to rest of Professor McGonagall’s explanation.</p><p>“Mr. Weasely, finding Hermione right now is possibly the worst thing you could do. Remember Miss Delacour’s reaction to you laying a hand on Miss Granger? And to Harry even walking towards the two of them? Imagine what she would do if you burst in unannounced with the intention of taking Hermione with you. She’d likely grow some feathers and claw your eyes out.” Ron guffawed at this, before seeing the serious look on Professor McGonagall’s face.</p><p>“You’re not serious, are you? Bloody hell!” Molly smacked her son on the back of the head in reprimand for his foul language and Minerva sighed. “I suggest you all go home. I cannot say exactly when you will see Miss Granger and Miss Delacour, and I don’t suggest looking for them. However, there is no need to worry about Miss Granger or her safety. Finding one’s mate is a beautiful, wonderful thing for Veela, and the last thing Miss Delacour would ever do is hurt her.”</p><p>Molly thanked Minerva with a look of gratitude and ushered her brood out of the office. She would have her hands full containing Ron and Harry until Hermione’s return. Minerva sat down in her office, gazing up at the portrait of Albus Dumbledore who was currently smiling down at her, his eyes twinkling. “Dear Minerva, don’t worry. Your prized pupil won’t change, she’ll only acquire an extremely attractive blond shadow…” Albus chuckled at his own joke and the corners of Minerva’s mouth twitched. She schooled her expression back to her usual stern façade, but couldn’t help but feel better.</p><p> </p>
