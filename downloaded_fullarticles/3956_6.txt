    <p>"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything when he's older. I've written them a letter."<br/>
   "A letter?" repeated Professor Mcgonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -a legend- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -there will be books written about Harry - every child in our world will know his name!"</p><p>"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing away from all that until he's ready to take it?" (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone; Rowling J.K, Page 13)</p><p>Mcgonagall paused for a brief moment as she pondered Dumbledore's opinion. "Fine. I'll raise him instead." She firmly stated. Dumbledore had fallen silent the moment she spoke. "Professor Mcgonagall, you know as good as I that is unacceptable." Nonetheless, he gave Mcgonagall a thoughtful-considering, even- look "What would make you entertain this thought so confidently, might I ask?" He added. "Why not? Surely, you understand I am capable of raising the boy." Professor Mcgonagall gave Dumbledore a piercing stare, "As I said before, I personally don't believe this is an even half way decent environment for young Harry Potter. I have never seen such a plain and, to be blunt, conservative group of muggles my entire life. I will not allow it."<br/>
Dumbledore thought for a moment. "Ah, But wouldn't you raise him in our world? Surely, he would get a big head from the constant attention he will no doubt receive. After all, as an infant he managed to wipe out one of the darkest wizards of all time with no thought what-so-ever." He stated this matter of factly. However, he wore a smile that beamed consideration. "Albus, I would hope that one as wise as yourself would understand that I would not raise a child to become arrogant and selfish. I believe that knowing humility is just as important as having self confidence. I have a very bad feeling about letting these muggles raise him." She concluded with a piercing stare and a strict tone.</p><p>A moment of silence went by as Dumbledore thought. An excruciatingly quiet moment slowly ticked by as Dumbledore considered Mcgonagall's proposition. The street appeared to be frozen in time as neither of them moved. The air was crisp and cool. A pair of cloudy grey eyes had been staring into a sea of pale blue that had been hiding behind  a pair of half moon spectacles.</p><p>"Very well, Mcgonagall. You may raise young Harry Potter. I simply hope that you will raise him to be a respectful man. No doubt, you will do an amazing job. Just remember that this is not just a normal child. This is the boy who lived."</p>
