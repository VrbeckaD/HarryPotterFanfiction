    <p>There’s a fly in his room.</p><p>Every so often, it leaves its perch on the wall to make a circuit of the room, but it always lands again before long. The loud buzz of its wings is almost funny, in an absurd kind of way. Or maybe it’s the heat.</p><p>With great effort, Harry turns his head to look at the window of Dudley’s second bedroom. In spite of his uncle’s best efforts, it only took half a week to dig out all the nails holding the rails to the sill, so he can open it whenever he likes. Thankfully, the bars haven’t returned. The threat of his serial-killer godfather (a misconception he’s happy to leave in place) is very effective.</p><p>The Dursleys are out running errands, and they’d informed him that they’ll be returning sometime this afternoon. Which means Harry will need to close the window soon if he wants to keep his window-opening privileges a secret.</p><p>Just the thought of having to stand makes him want to groan, but groaning would take too much effort, so he just closes his eyes and imagines a nice breeze pooling through the room.</p><p>Unlike Dudley’s actual bedroom, Harry’s room has not been equipped with a fan.</p><p>Technically, he should be working on the list of chores that was left for him when the Dursleys left, but he thinks even Aunt Petunia might let his laziness slide in the face of today’s oppressive heat. In fact, he’d be surprised if she didn’t head straight upstairs to wash and fix her makeup upon returning, as he’s often heard her complain about the terrible effects of sweat on her appearance. He’d give himself an hour after they get back before she actually bothers to check whether he’s done as instructed.</p><p>In the distance he hears a shriek of laughter.</p><p>At least Dudley and his gang have grown out of Harry Hunting, he thinks absently. He’s gotten quite good at running for his life by now, but if he were chased in this kind of heat, he might just have to lie down and take it.</p><p>How depressing.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he pushes himself up to sit on the bed, wincing at the pull in his muscles. He spent most of the morning pushing heavy furniture around to vacuum, and his arms are going to be sore tomorrow.</p><p>He really should finish his chores.</p><p>While Aunt Petunia might be more lenient on account of the heat, Uncle Vernon tends toward spiteful, and he’d really like to eat today. He supposes he could steal something, but Dudley would surely notice, and he’d be more than happy to get Harry in trouble.</p><p>Which means he’s going to finish his chores.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>On his way over to close the window, he grabs his discarded shirt from the floor and pulls it back on. The shirt is over-large (even though he got it two years ago when he was even smaller) and threadbare, and he’s suddenly grateful that gardening isn’t on his list for today. He’d gotten used to being the ugly, unwanted misfit in ill-fitting hand-me-downs when he was younger, but it’s always hard to readjust after months of wearing robes that were made just for him.</p><p>With a huff of frustration, he pushes those unproductive thoughts away and sets his mind to finishing his work as quickly as possible.</p><p>While he’d usually be content to do as poor a job as possible without getting smacked for it, Uncle Vernon implied that if he behaved well enough this summer, he’d have access to his school books. Not only would this let him finish his summer assignments <em> before </em> getting on the train to go back to Hogwarts, which would spare him the usual smears of red ink and disapproving looks, it would also give him something to do when he inevitably gets locked up again.</p><p>Not that he trusts Uncle Vernon to keep his word, of course, but it’s worth a shot.</p><p>By the time he hears the car pull up the drive, he’s finished cleaning all the floors and windows, he’s dusted various surfaces around the house, and he’s reorganized the kitchen cabinets and cleaned out the oven.</p><p>He’s honestly pretty proud of himself.</p><p>Naturally, he receives no compliments on his work. But really, no acknowledgement is often better when it comes to the Dursleys.</p><p>As his uncle settles into his place on the couch and Dudley disappears into his room to play whatever new game for his SNES that his parents just bought for him, Harry accepts the piece of toast and glass of water that will count as his payment for today’s work and heads outside. Aunt Petunia won’t call him in to start dinner for a while now, which means he has at least an hour to kill, and it’s cooled off just enough that being outside is more comfortable than staying in a room with no airflow. Besides, this way he doesn’t have to listen to Dudley’s shouts of frustration accompanied by the ridiculous electronic noises that would undoubtedly pass through the thin walls.</p><p>He eats the toast in small bites. Unfortunately, it’s just dry enough to be unsatisfying, and all it really does is bring the hunger that had been gnawing at his stomach just a few hours earlier roaring back. Harry takes a moment to consider whether Aunt Petunia did this on purpose before deciding that she probably wouldn’t bother putting that much effort into making him uncomfortable. She does that well enough without even needing to try.</p><p>The water is similarly unsatisfying, and it leaves him feeling uncomfortably sloshy.</p><p>With a sigh, he leaves the glass by the door and wanders over to the tree near the hedge. Its leafy branches cast just enough of a shadow to fit him, so he happily flops himself down to lie in the grass.</p><p>As the sounds of children playing and nosey neighbors checking in on each other float across the hot summer air, he lets his eyes drift shut, relaxing into the clenching in his stomach. Like his clothes, the hunger always takes time to readjust to. Just a bit longer, however, and it will fade again.</p><p>It always does.</p><p>“BOY!”</p><p>His uncle’s voice is loud enough to be heard from outside, and Harry groans. Maybe, if he ignores the man, whatever's annoyed him this time will just go away and he’ll be left in peace.</p><p>The sound of the back door crashing open against the house is enough to get rid of <em> that </em> idea.</p><p>When he sits up, he sees his uncle standing in the doorway, his face going purple as he breathes heavily. It’s almost impressive.</p><p>“Inside.” His uncle isn’t shouting anymore, now that it’s possible for the neighbors to catch sight of the latest drama, but Harry hears him clearly. He hears the anger, too. “Now.”</p><p>Harry does as told, knowing that the sooner he complies, the sooner he'll be left alone again.</p><p>Once he’s in reach, his uncle grabs him by the neck and shoves him inside, hard enough to make him fall against the kitchen counter. He breaks his fall with his hands, and his wrists ache. At least it’s better than breaking the fall with his face.</p><p>“Explain yourself, boy!”</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes and turns to face the man, carefully edging out of grabbing range. He remembers being strangled last summer, and he isn’t eager for a repeat performance.</p><p>“Explain what?” he asks.</p><p>He sees Aunt Petunia watching from the hall, her face pinched up in disapproval, and she looks even more horse-like than usual. Dudley is hovering behind her, though he looks surprisingly unenthused to see Harry get in trouble.</p><p>“You-” His uncle steps closer. Harry glares, and the man actually hesitates. Then, anger takes over whatever semblance of reason he might possess and he crowds into Harry’s space once more, waving an unopened letter in his face. “I thought I told you that those freaks of yours were not to send letters during the day! You’re lucky that bird of theirs didn’t break anything, or I’d have-”</p><p>His annoyance building the longer he stands there being shouted at, Harry grabs the letter from his uncle’s hand. The man sputters in response, cutting off whatever (not entirely empty) threat was sure to follow, and Harry takes this opportunity to wander out of the kitchen.</p><p>His aunt flinches back as he passes, as if afraid to touch him without a frying pan in hand.</p><p>His uncle stomps along after him.</p><p>While Harry will admit to being a bit nervous at having the large man at his back, he also knows that all he needs is one bruise to justify using magic in self-defense, now that the public is back on his side after Voldemort’s reveal. His school trunk may have been locked away, but Harry managed to sneak his wand up into his room with him and has kept it on hand since, tucked into a holster that Moody had finally snapped and given him after catching him putting his wand in his pocket one time too many.</p><p>He opens the envelope carefully.</p><p>Vernon moves to snatch it back, but Harry dodges out of the way, drawing his wand and using it to smack the man’s hand away. Though some people would no doubt be disappointed in him to hear it, the way his uncle all but squeals in surprise and maybe even a little fear makes him smile.</p><p>Thankfully, the reminder of his magic is enough to keep the man away, so now the Dursley family is hovering in the threshold as Harry stands in the center of the living room.</p><p>After one last look to make sure the Dursleys haven’t moved, Harry unfolds the letter and starts to read.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Mr. Potter </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My name is Sulien Blackspire, and I am a representative for Lockman and Kodge, the leading agency for discreet assistance on matters relating to family and inheritance law in Magical Britain. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am contacting you because we have discovered information, pertaining to your mother’s use of our services roughly fifteen years ago, that requires your immediate attention. While I am loathe to interrupt your summer break, this is a most sensitive matter that I believe must be discussed in person. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please respond at your earliest convenience so that we might establish a time to meet and discuss your options. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Regards, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sulien Blackspire, Esq. </em>
</p><p>Once he’s finished reading, Harry closes his eyes and forces himself to relax his grip on the parchment. This is… unexpected. To be entirely honest, he wasn’t even aware that wizards <em> had </em> lawyers, not after his disastrous hearing where only Dumbledore’s timely intervention saved him from getting his wand snapped.</p><p>“Well?” Uncle Vernon demands. “What does the letter say, boy?</p><p>Harry hesitates, considering.</p><p>While he <em> could </em> hide the letter’s contents from the Dursleys, this doesn’t seem like something they’d be very interested in, so attempting to keep it from them might cause entirely avoidable trouble. On the other hand, he doesn’t trust them with anything that might be important, and if this letter is to be believed (which remains to be seen), then whatever it’s about is <em> exceptionally </em> important.</p><p>Honestly. It’d be really nice if people could just tell him things instead of only ever hinting at secrets that will undoubtedly mess up his life beyond repair. At least this man sounds like he wants to tell him everything as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally, once his uncle starts looking antsy, he decides to share. It’s not like they could keep him from going, after all.</p><p>“It’s a request to set up an appointment,” Harry tells them.</p><p>“An appointment?” His uncle says it as if the idea that wizards might do such normal things as set up appointments is unheard of. “Who’d want to set up an appointment with <em> you </em>?”</p><p>“Loads of people, actually.” Not all of them are well-meaning, but that’s beside the point. “Anyway, it’s some law firm in London. I’m to write them back as soon as possible.”</p><p>As he says this, he heads for the kitchen again. Perched just outside the window is a dull brown owl, bigger than Pig but smaller than Hedwig. Seeing as he can’t access his store of parchment at the moment, he grabs a pen and scrawls his response on the back of the letter, suggesting they meet later in the week.</p><p>As they watch the owl fly away, his aunt finally speaks up.</p><p>“Is it safe?”</p><p>Harry turns to look at her, too surprised at her expressing concern to hide it.</p><p>“Excuse me?” he asks, incredulous.</p><p>“This appointment.” Aunt Petunia gestures vaguely with one hand, looking uncomfortable. “Will it be safe, what with that awful man having returned?”</p><p>It’s almost funny.</p><p>She’s perfectly content to starve him, lock him in a cupboard, and hit him with blunt objects, but the thought of him being killed and thereby permanently taken off her hands is just too much for her.</p><p>Actually, no, it most definitely <em> is </em>funny.</p><p>It’s funny in the way that makes Ron and Hermione exchange those uncertain and entirely too serious glances before trying to make him talk about things. As if there’s anything to talk about.</p><p>“Should be,” is all he says after a pause that has even Dudley shifting anxiously. “If it’s not, Dudley can have my potions supplies.”</p><p>Dudley and Aunt Petunia turn white; Uncle Vernon is approaching purple again. Harry decides it’s probably time to leave the room.</p><p>They can sort out dinner for themselves. After that comment, he doubts they'd give him any if he asked.</p><p>And anyway, he was right, earlier.</p><p>The hunger has faded again.</p>
