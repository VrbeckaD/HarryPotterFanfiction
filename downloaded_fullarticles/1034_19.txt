  <p><strong>Tester: </strong>#394</p>
  <p><strong>Product name: </strong>Prototype #DD0174 “A Grow-er And A Show-er”</p>
  <p><strong>Colour:</strong> Opaque. Deep turquoise.</p>
  <p><strong>Length:</strong> 7.5” (excluding grip) increasing to maximum 8.5”</p>
  <p><strong>Girth:</strong> 4.8” increasing to maximum 5.3”</p>
  <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Slightly springy</p>
  <p><strong>Usage report:</strong> Inserted to minimal discomfort following manual preparation (full cleanse, lubrication, and digital stretching). Upon activation, continuous vibrations last approximately seven minutes before expansion and lengthening of dildo (time to maximum extension: three minutes). Maximum extension combined with maximum vibration for 90 seconds resulted in orgasm (duration approx. 60 seconds) and ejaculation (average: approx 1 tsp with distance of 55 - 60 cm (crotch to lower lip)).</p>

  </p>
  <p>My dearest Quality Assurance Manager, </p>
  <p>I absolutely must share news of my latest happenings, I had simply the most wonderful experience only yesterday morn. </p>
  <p>The clocks had not yet chimed ten, when this titillating tale begins. My silver orbs, which — as you know, are the colour of moonlight reflecting on the shore of a deserted Hellenic islet — couldn’t believe the extravagant delights that lay before me. Delivered by a majestic tawny owl to my boudoir window, the simple brown paper package tied up with string belied the sheer elegance of the gift that lay within. Nestled securely in a bed of cerise tissue paper lay the most elegant dildo, I ever did see. The royal purple of the long, smooth shaft was augmented and enhanced with the luxurious golden buttons; one for speed, one for intensity, both for me.</p>
  <p>Its beauty and presence stole my patience, I couldn’t wait but a moment longer, and so there and then — although it was only mid-morning and elevenses would simply have to be skipped for the day — I slowly unbuttoned my classically fashionable robes and let them pool on the floor, the charcoal and emerald pinstriped silk landing with the gentlest of whooshes. I allowed my fingers to tweak my dusky nipples into pert nubs and then ran my hands down my hairless chest to where, prepared as I am for every situation, I had no underpants to further delay my pleasure.</p>
  <p>My flushed member, as pink as cherry blossom, and just a little darker at the head, had been at half-mast since the owl had departed. Now, with the promise of an enjoyable morning ahead, I licked my lips, running the tip of my tongue along my Cupid’s bow and with my long elegant fingers around my most gentlemanly of appendages, I brought myself to full hardness.</p>
  <p>Moving now to my bed, I laid myself atop of my deep navy silk sheets; above me the  alabaster ceiling was a perfect match for my smooth unblemished skin. My sleek platinum blond hair fanned out like a halo on my tasseled throw pillow as I pulled my long, shapely legs up to my chest and let my knees fall to the bedspread exposing my tight but inviting rosebud. From my hand-carved mahogany bedside table I took my favourite bottle of oil, a bespoke blend of bergamot and cedar, and allowed a thin rivulet to pool in the palm of my hand. I tickled my coin purse slowly with my slickened hand before allowing my perfectly manicured finger to drift over my most sensitive of spots to my hidden entrance. </p>
  <p>I allowed my mind to drift, to think of the person, the man, who would give me such extravagances. He could only be my other half, the sun to my moon, the lithe to my lean, the John The Baptist to my Asmodeus. </p>
  <p>With my clean hand I lifted my prize from its wrapping, holding it this close I could see it was perfect. With the length of the most eligible bachelor and pleasingly girthsome, I could only salivate at such a veritable treat. With a liberal coating of the citrusy slick, there was only one thing for it. I allowed the tumescent head to push gently at my moistened entrance before, with one thrust, it filled me right up and with a flick of the switch it buzzed to life. It led me on quite the merry dance, until I was quickstepping across the pleasure/pain to a tune only I could hear. I felt myself bloom and moved onto the second course. </p>
  <p>Although hidden between my milk-white thighs I could feel second the golden button that, once flicked, would take me deeper into my own decadence. With a satisfying click it did just that, setting a gentle pulsing rhythm. The beats staccato-ed up and down the length, until, with a spark of magic missing from even the most sophisticated of muggle designs, it fell upon that precious spot deep inside and fixed itself there. Having found what it was looking for, without not one whit from me, the turgid rod intensified its ferocity until my denouement.</p>
  <p>Glowing, I laid back as I eased the delightful member from my tender garden; powerful stripes drying on my chest, evidence of a job well and truly done.  Although I was exhausted, it was not and would happily have carried me away for the remainder of the day, had I not had luncheon plans.</p>
  <p>There will always be tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Yours, and only yours, </p>
  <p>

<p></p><div class="comments"><p> You have to — and I cannot stress this enough — put all of the instructions on one page. I was halfway down Diagon running a couple of errands when it kicked in. I only found page two of the instructions after I’d cast <em>Initium</em>, stuck it up my arse, almost orgasmed right in the middle of Diagon <b>fucking</b> Alley, and had come like a horny teenager as soon as I'd apparated back into my flat. Didn't even get my trousers passed my knees. It's really quite important to know that I was supposed to be thinking about someone in particular when casting. You might want to lead with that instruction. </p><p>And yes, I was thinking of Someone, when I cast, but not in an I’d-like-him-to-shove-this-up-my-arse way, just in the low-level everyday thinking about someone way you get when his face is in The Prophet every week despite doing absolutely nothing remotely newsworthy in at least the last five years. </p><p>I'll concede the charm is genius and I can see a number of great uses for it, and, it certainly works. I have no doubt I was in the vicinity of Him when the heating charm activated, and I can assure you the temperature rose in more ways than one. Never have I been quite so flustered in front of <strike>Scarhead </strike>that particular individual, even if he didn’t see me.</p></div>

<p></p><div class="letterleft">
  <p>You wore it in public? Without knowing what it did‽ How Gryffindorian.</p>
  <p>If you weren’t thinking about the person intimately then the charm shouldn’t have worked. I’ll get the team to look at it again.</p>
  <p>-QAM</p>
  <p>P.S. Can I call you something other than Tester #394. It’s kinda impersonal for how, well, <em>personal </em>this is.</p>
</div><div class="letterright">
  <p>Dear Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes’ Quality Assurance Manager,</p>
  <p>I suppose that given the circumstances, I could permit the use of more friendly <em>noms de plume</em>. Did you have any in particular in mind, or should we select our own? I should think to prefer to select my own; you may call me Opaleye. You shan’t, however, call me,  or even insinuate the merest sliver of a hint of, “Gryffindorian” ever again, or this agreement will come to an abrupt end.</p>
  <p>As we are now oh so personal, may I point out that not everything has to go up my arse. While I enjoy a good rogering as much as the next man, there’s more to gay sex than repeated insertion. You may wish to consider a range of items which avoid the genitals altogether, or failing that, something more cock-focussed?</p>
  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <p>Opaleye</p>
  <p>P.S. You don’t need to bother the team about the butt plug; being perfectly truthful, it is not uncommon that I think about that particular Someone <strike>watching me shove my fingers up my arse</strike> so it is feasible that that particular thought crept in as I cast.</p>
</div><div class="letterleft">
  <p>Opaleye, like the dragon? Cool. I’ve seen a few dragons but never one of them, I’ve heard they’re beautiful.</p>
  <p>I guess that means I need a name as well. How about Evan?</p>
  <p>I know there’s more to gay sex than having things in your arse <strike>(I’m just a comfortable being the one putting things there)</strike> but I’ve taken on board your suggestion and so this one is for your cock. And because you didn’t read the instructions before, be warned this too has a mind of its own. It’s designed to loosen and tighten as the wearer needs it. Try not to think too hard about it as we did have an unfortunate tester have to get <em>diffendo-ed </em> out of an early prototype when they got too excited. </p>
  <p>Yours,</p>
  <p>Evan</p>

The ring seemed to work well and held my parts securely even as I tumbled over a particularly turbulent floo connection. It held up through several hours of my feigned politeness, keeping me just distracted enough to let my parents' thinly veiled barbs about my lack of a wife pass. <em>"Homosexuality is no excuse not to take a wife, a gentleman can always have a back alley dalliance if needs must." </em></p><p>Alas, it was not to last. </p><p>As I excused myself following a particularly nightmarish talk on the perils of mixed-blood marriages with from my father, I felt it slide loose. The only saving grace being my choice of sinfully tight ankle-grazers under my robes preventing it from landing squarely in the middle of the semi-formal drawing room. </p><p>Clearly the deranged bigoted rantings of a Death Eater can make me softer than even a WWW cockring can salvage. </p></div><div class="verified"><p><em><em>Magical signature verified by <i>Celare</i> under licence from PPP Charms Ltd.</em></em></p></div></div><em></em><br/><em></em><br/>

<p></p><div class="comments"><p> Peppermint is definitely an improvement on, what was that flavour of the first batch, Groundskeeper’s feet? But I have to ask, are the WWW coffers really so low that you’re cutting corners? You need to understand that despite what Witch Weekly would have you believe, not everyone wishes the scar-headed Saviour of the Wizarding World were their soulmate. If you are going to sell this as a soulmate potion then it needs to show your soulmate.</p><p>May it be easier to just brand this as The Boy Who Lived daydream potion? Even those of us with little tolerance for his allround do-gooderiness, his penchant for saving people, and his righteous indignation at whatever cause célèbre is political flavour of the week can admit that his appearance with an oversized golden snitch (and nothing else) for last year’s War Orphans' charity calendar would be welcome all year round. But don’t try to delude us into thinking that The Boy Who Lived could ever be our soulmate. That’s just not fair.</p></div>

  <p>Hi</p>
  <p>This one’s from the latest batch - version three. Same peppermint flavour, but hopefully the action is a bit more to your liking. I’ve tested it myself and can assure you that it very much isn’t a Potter special. </p>

<p></p><div class="comments"><p>I didn’t hold out much hope for this one. A book? Who’s your target market? Ravenclaws? Madam Pince? Hermione Granger‽ (Although I have to believe that, like Pince, the Granger-Weasleys lead a celibate life because that’s a image my delicate sensibilities simply cannot handle). </p><p>But it’s not just a book is it?</p><p>Very sneaky, I must admit, there must be a little Slytherin in you <strike>if not would you like one</strike>. I didn’t catch it at first, but it’s there, isn’t it? The lightest hint of a compulsion charm, just enough to push you to rub one out just as the handsome aristobrat gets his arse well and truly eaten by the dishevelled hero . Had I realised I possibly wouldn’t have sat out on my balcony overlooking the communal courtyard to read. <strike>Who am I kidding, I absolutely would have, and will likely do again. The twink across the way loves it.</strike></p></div>

  <p>Dear Opaleye,</p>
  <p>Compulsion charms are illegal, even very light ones. WWW’s stock is all completely and utterly above board. It’s just good writing. Even I like the story, and I’m hardly the library-est of people. There's just something about how the pair of them hate each other but they don’t, not really. You know? And the bratty heir who is actually a big softy underneath it all totally sounds like my cup of tea, if only he were real.</p>
  <p>We’ve got a dozen or so more stories almost ready if you or your twink are interested? There might be some spelling and grammar mistakes but the <strike>porn</strike> plot is all there. How about where they’re stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere and there’s only one bed? Or one where they are roommates? I read that one last night, they weren't even wizards! And then in one that came in this morning, they're enemies but have to pretend to date each other? Sounds amazing! I’ve not had a chance to read it yet, but if it’s like the rest, well, ‘nuff said.</p>
  <p>Yours, </p>
  <p>Evan</p>
  <p>P.S. And yes, for my own sanity I have to believe the Granger-Weasleys have done nothing more risqué than hold hands when my back is turned.</p>
</div><div class="letterright">
  <p>Evan,</p>
  <p>Yes. All of them. <u>Now</u>. Please.</p>
  <p>Have you thought about having the stories read aloud? Maybe get some minor celebrity to narrate. I’m sure I heard somewhere that Harry Potter still has something to do with your company? I could listen to him talk about rimming all night.</p>
  <p>-O</p>
  <p>P.S. And he’s not my twink (nor do I have any intention of making him so). <strike>I’ve come to realise there's someone else I’d rather have watch (or watch) as the mood takes</strike></p>
  <p>P.P.S. Hand holding? I shudder at the very thought.</p>
</div><div class="letterleft">
  <p>Dear Opaleye</p>
  <p>If rumours are to be believed then Harry Potter would do more than <em>talk</em> about rimming all night.</p>
  <p>So you’re still single? <strike>That’s good to hear.</strike></p>
  <p>Okay, this product is a little different, it too big to send by owl, and, well, it needs another tester… me to be exact. I need to test this product and it requires another participant to... well, it needs someone to enjoy themselves while being watched and, you like that, right? Being watched, I mean. You wouldn't see me and I couldn't tell anyone about it (well not unless you wanted me to), so would you think about it?</p>
  <p>If you’re interested I’ll owl you a floo address.</p>
  <p>Yours,</p>
  <p>Evan</p>
