    <p>
  <span>The sound of a ticking clock filled the echos of large, empty manor, nestled in a dark and thick woods in Northern England. The inhabitants of the paintings that littered the walls were fast asleep, occasionally emitting sputtering snores. A young woman, the house’s only occupant, was tucked away inside one of the manor’s spare bedrooms. Despite the master bedroom being vacant, she prefered the room she had occupied as a young child to the one typically reserved for the head of the household. Posters of the old Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team hung alongside other childhood memories.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathandra Rosier woke to her pitch black bedroom from a jolt of pain on her left arm. In memory of a habit she had long forgotten, she reached over with her right hand and rubbed the place where her Dark Mark had long since faded into a pinkish scar. With a flick of her fingers, the candles in the chandelier over her bed burst into light. An ornate clock, decorated with winged creatures which appeared to be consuming the face, showed the time to be nearly four in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Closing her eyes, she forced her breath to slow. “It was just a dream,” she muttered to herself. Rolling out of her bed, she plodded to the bathroom to wash the sweat off her face. Looking into the mirror, she saw the reflection of a young woman with long tight black curls cascading around her sharp cheekbones and bright blue eyes. As a child she had been frequently confused for her close mentor and cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. But standing topless in front of the mirror, the myriad of scars and tattoos that covered her body had slowly marked her as an individual.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ran her finger over the three deep scars that resembled blade cuts across her upper chest. They had long since healed but nonetheless stood out prominently on her physique. A long spiral mark ran from her forearm to her wrist on her right arm. She knew if she turned around it would reveal the pink welts from where she had been punished for letting the prisoners slip through her fingers the first time and her giant Auguery tattoo which covered her back. The marks on Nathandra’s slim and curvy frame told of a violent past. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she absentmindedly traced her markings, her heart began to race again once she saw that the mark on her arm was a blood red. She hadn’t see it that dark since the night of Halloween, 1981, the last time anyone had seen or heard from the Dark Lord. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Abandoning the pretense of sleep, she walked back into the bedroom, pulled a ribbed tank top over her head, and tossed her long dark curls out from under the fabric. Slipping her wand into the waistband of her boxer shorts, she wandered through the dimly lit hallways of her home until she reached the kitchen. She grabbed her teapot, used her wand to fill it with water, and then tapped against it to set it a boil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A soft ping echoed throughout the room as if it was originating from the walls themselves, a part of the wards that guarded her wooded estate against intruders. Designed to repel any unwelcome visitors, it was coded to only a few people for automatic entrance into the grounds. This visitor, however, had passed through the charms without a problem. Nathandra poured herself a cup of tea, while she waited for him or her to make their way up the long drive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She heard Doll, her house elf, welcome someone at the door with her squeaky high voice, and upon hearing the visitor's name she decided to retrieve her bottle of whiskey instead. She should have revoked this visitor’s entry privileges a long time ago. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want, Lucius?” she asked, not bothering to hide her impatience or turn to greet the infamously irritating Lucius Malfoy as his heeled boots clicked across the floor. Dragon’s hide, no doubt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come now,” he replied in an arrogant drawal, “Is that any way to greet family?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s four o’clock in the morning, what do you want?” She poured a bit of the whiskey into her tea and took a long pull straight from the bottle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it really that much of a burden to welcome my company?” he said mockingly, taking a seat at the small kitchen table. Despite the late hour, he looked as though he was dressed for a business meeting with perfectly pressed robes and his long blonde hair pulled into a low ponytail. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does my cousin know where you are so late at night?” She gave him a cold disapproving look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Narcissa is still fast asleep in the manor,” he admitted. “Why don’t you put on something more decent, so we can put away any whispers of infidelity?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t touch you with a seven-foot pole. Get out of my house Lucius,” snapped Nathandra. She had always loathed his condescending tone. He was only seven years older than her, but had always talked down to her like one does to a young child. And the idea of having an affair with her cousin’s pompous husband made her shudder with disgust. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, how I would love return to my warm bed. But it seems I have matters to discuss with you. Care to offer me a glass?” He gestured at the bottle sitting on the counter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” She sipped on her tea, trying to decide if it was worth it to remove her cousin-in-law by force from her kitchen table. The alcohol burned her empty stomach, but she pursed her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come now, Nate,” his voice was still playful as he used her nickname. “This doesn’t have to be abrasive.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And yet, you are still in my house. So I ask again. Why are you </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span> Lucius? And what were you going to do if I was asleep or not home?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am here for this,” he said rolling up his sleeves to reveal his Dark Mark also glowing red. “Which is the same way I knew I would find you awake and nursing your bottle,” a note of contempt on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathandra blinked at him as though he had pulled back a curtain in a great reveal to find nothing but a flobberworm lying in its own mucus.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Congratulations,” she said with biting sarcasm. “Turns out you weren’t Imperiused after all. You are Death Eater after all. I suppose one of us should alert the Wizengamot.” Lucius was one of the few Death Eaters who had avoided Azkaban by claiming he was under the Imperius curse. And donating healthy sums of money.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop being such a bitch,” he snapped back, a fleeting look of fear crossed his face. “He is supposed to be dead. What does this mean?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathandra let out a mirthless laugh, “Why don’t you ask your friends at the Ministry? Or Severus for that matter? Why come to my doorstep for answers?”   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Ministry has been five steps behind the Dark Lord since day one and you know that. Your line of work has access to information that…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathandra cut him off, “My </span>
  <em>
    <span>line</span>
  </em>
  <span> of work? Forgive me if I am wrong, but wasn’t it you who said my line of work was a disgrace to my blood. You seem less appalled by it when it suits your needs.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a disgrace,” yelled Lucius, losing his temper. “You whore yourself out to the highest bidder…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not </span>
  <em>
    <span>whore</span>
  </em>
  <span> myself out! I am not a prostitute!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You kill and sell secrets to anyone willing to pay. What would you call it!?” Lucius had stood up and slammed his fists on the table. “It is certainly not a job of a respectable Pureblood woman…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do not act like you are so pure and righteous! You once had blood on your hands too. Many would even claim that you enjoyed it,” sneered Nathandra picking up her wand from the counter and aiming it at Lucius. “Now get out of my house before I decide family loyalty isn’t enough to keep you alive.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of running out the door, he took a deep breath to calm his temper. “I will pay you for the information,” he said in a small voice dropping a velvet bag of coins, so heavy they could only be galleons, on the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want your money. I want you out of my house.” She shot a nonverbal curse at the ceiling above his head as a warning, “Now!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nathandra,” he pleaded, “I need to know. I need to know if my family is in danger.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathandra’s face was stony with indifference. “You should have thought about that before you publicly disavowed the Dark Lord. Now, I’m giving you one more chance to get the fuck out of my house.” Lucius stood with defeat and made to move towards the door. “Don’t send Narcissa here to plead your case in the morning. I won't be here, and it won't work regardless.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Lucius passed her on his way to the door, he said, “I may have denied my allegiance to save my skin, but at least I wasn’t cast out to die. If the Dark Lord will not welcome me back with open arms, what do you think he will do to you?” Looking her in the eyes, he sneered, “You are just as afraid as the rest of us, yet you were too stubborn to allow your family to help. I wish you the worst.” With that he turned and stormed out, leaving Nathandra to stared blankly off into the dark void of her empty home. She’d known the day would come when the Dark Lord would return to power. She rose from the table, taking her whiskey with her. It was time to plan. </span>
