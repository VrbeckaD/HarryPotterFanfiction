    <p align="left">"Tad, catch me!"</p><p align="left">Remus opened his arms automatically as a colorful blur launched towards him, scooping Teddy up with a laugh and a ruffle of bright blue hair. It was then he spotted Harry coming to a stop a few feet away, hardly looking ruffled from having to sprint to keep up with the energetic child. But then, he was barely twenty, and played sport. Remus, meanwhile, felt older by the minute, and constantly running after a five year old wore him out easily. "Were you good for Harry?" He quirked an eyebrow at Teddy, who giggled and nodded, then turned his questioning but amused gaze towards the man in question.</p><p align="left">Harry laughed, and Remus was glad to see him looking so at ease. Harry often looked like he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, but babysitting Teddy always seemed to ease that burden a bit. "He was fine. We finished homework early, so I let him play on my--"</p><p align="left">"Harry's got a 3DS and I played Animal Crossing and it made me pick boy or girl but Harry said the boys can wear girl clothes and the girls can wear boy clothes in it, and you can change your hair colors all the time, and you get to make a house and stuff!" Teddy burst in, prompting Remus to gently remind him not to interrupt other people. "Sorry Harry." He apologized promptly, sounding practiced at it. It was something they'd been working on for a bit.</p><p align="left">"That sounds very fun, Teddy." Remus smiled and set him down again. If Teddy really took to this game, it would make a good Christmas present. He'd have to see how much it cost, though, especially since they didn't have any game consoles save for Remus' ancient PlayStation that collected dust more than anything else. "Could you get your homework for me? I'd like to see how you did."</p><p align="left">Teddy nodded and ran off and Remus' gaze shifted to Harry again. "Not that I don't trust you, of course. I just prefer to keep up with what they're teaching him."</p><p align="left">Harry waved it off, chuckling. "Don't worry, I understand. Um, I don't mean to rush out on you or anything, but--" He trailed off, voice uncertain, and Remus could easily figure he had plans of some sort. He'd been hoping Harry might join them for dinner, but far be it from him to keep him from a social life anymore than he already has.</p><p align="left">"Of course, of course! Don't let us keep you. And thank you again. Bring your classwork over this Sunday and I'll be happy to help you with it." Remus smiled; he couldn't really afford to pay for a babysitter, but he didn't feel right having Harry do it for free, so Remus had offered him tutoring for his college courses in exchange. He was a bright young man, but like anyone, he had subjects he struggled in, and his research skills weren't the best. He'd spent too long depending on his friend Hermione to do the research for him, Remus reckoned.</p><p align="left">"I'll say bye to Teddy." Harry looked relieved that Remus wasn't trying to get him to stay. Very important plans, then.</p><p align="left">Remus' lips curled up mischievously. "Do tell Ginny that we'd be happy to have the both of you over for dinner again soon."</p><p align="left">Harry flustered, and Remus chuckled, knowing he'd hit the nail on the head. "I, uh, she'll be happy to hear that! I bet!"</p><p align="left">Teddy ran back in, waving his homework in the air, and Harry seemed relieved for the distraction. "I got it, Tad!"</p><p align="left">Remus took it from him, paging through it. "Thank you, Teddy. Harry's got to head out, love, so say goodbye."</p><p align="left">"Bye, Harry!" He chirped cheerfully, and gave Harry a hug.</p><p align="left">"What else do we say?" Remus prompted patiently.</p><p align="left">"Thank you for playing with me!" Teddy looked back at Remus for confirmation. Remus nodded, then sweeped his hand in a gesture of "keep going". "And..." Teddy's face scrunched in thought, then brightened again. "And helping me with homework!" At that, Remus gave a thumbs up.</p><p align="left">Harry returned Teddy's hug tightly. "You're welcome, Teddy. I'll keep bringing Animal Crossing, so you keep working hard on getting your homework done, okay? I'll see you on Sunday." As eager as he'd been to head out, he seemed reluctant to let go.</p><p align="left">"Have a good night." Remus got a hug from the young man as well before he started for the door.</p><p align="left">"You too."</p><p align="left">The night proceeded as usual; Remus made dinner, Teddy chattered on about what had happened at school, then played in front of the tv as Remus graded assignments on the couch. Then it was time to get Teddy ready for bed. He felt his phone buzz in his pocket as he ran the bath, but had to ignore it when Teddy took the distraction as an opportunity to streak through the house completely nude, wanting Remus to chase him.</p><p align="left">It took another ten minutes to get Teddy settled down enough to bathe, another five to get teeth brushed and pajamas on, and one glass of water later, he was finally tucked into bed and Remus could check it.</p><p align="right">`hey`</p><p align="left">Anticlimactic, and from an unknown number. Remus was tempted to just not answer it at all, but his curiosity got the better of him. What could it hurt?</p><p align="left">`Who is this?` </p><p align="left">The reply came quickly.</p><p align="right">`don't be like that. you're coming, right?`</p><p align="left">His eyebrows lofted. Whoever it is must have the wrong number, and Remus should really just tell them so more clearly, but-- well, it couldn't hurt to have some fun with it first.</p><p align="left">`Maybe I need a little convincing first.`</p><p align="left">The next reply took a little longer, and Remus started to wonder if the stranger had figured out they'd been talking to someone other than who they'd intended. Then, a picture popped up that nearly made Remus drop his phone in shock.</p><p align="left">The man in it was gorgeous; he seemed about Remus' age, his features aristocratic but with a rough edge that was immensely attractive. It was a selfie, an overhead shot, and angled artistically to display his torso. He was wearing a muscle shirt and work jeans, and how he managed to make such simple clothes look stunning was something Remus couldn't begin to understand. He had black smudges along his arms, his dark hair looked like it was tied back, and was leaning against a sleek-looking motorbike. But what had made Remus nearly drop his phone was that the man's hand was gripping his bulging erection, like he was a bloody calendar pin-up.</p><p align="left">This definitely wasn't meant for him. Remus wasn't the kind of person someone like <em> that </em> sent racy pictures to, and besides, he didn't <em> know </em> who it was.</p><p align="right">`got a present for u. that convincing enuff? ;)`</p><p align="left">Attractive as he was, his grammar was atrocious. Still, Remus suddenly felt horrible for having lied.</p><p align="left">`I'm really sorry, you must have the wrong number. I don't know who you are.`</p><p align="left">It was another few minutes before the next reply.</p><p align="right">`that's fine. enjoy the picture still?`</p><p align="left">Remus' heart was about to thud out of his chest. It had really been far too long since he'd-- well, since he'd had anything resembling a romantic overture made towards him. Not since Dora had passed. He knew she wouldn't have wanted him to live like a hermit, but it was easier said than done to ignore that tendency. Accepting propositions from strangers who'd texted him by mistake was a bit too far out of his comfort zone, though.</p><p align="left">`It's a very artistic angle?`</p><p align="right">`oh ur a picky one eh? i see, i see.`</p><p align="left">At least the man didn't seem offended that he'd sent a lewd picture to a stranger by mistake, but then, he didn't know Remus was also a man yet.</p><p align="left">`Sorry I didn't say right away. I didn't expect the conversation to take that sort of turn.`</p><p align="right">`no worries! can i get ur name tho?`</p><p align="left">He should just say no, just end the conversation. He could find a way to block the number.</p><p align="left">`Why?`</p><p align="right">`just curious. u seem interesting`</p><p align="left">Remus chuckled and shook his head.</p><p align="left">`You don't know anything about me.`</p><p align="right">`i kno u were gonna play me at first but then i sent the pic and u fessed up. so ur honest when it matters`</p><p align="left">As Remus considered his options, another text arrived.</p><p align="right">`besides uve seen what i look like. it's only fair u kno!`</p><p align="left">He huffed out a laugh and replied before he could think better of it.</p><p align="left">`My name is Remus.`</p><p align="right">`like the greek dude?`</p><p align="left">`Roman, actually.`</p><p align="right">`oh yeah. the twins right? raised by wolves? u got a twin?`</p><p align="left">`That's correct. No, I'm an only child.`</p><p align="right">`good i hate when people get too theme-y with their kids names`</p><p align="right">`you doing anything tonite remus?`</p><p align="left">How sad that this was the most engaging conversation he'd had with someone new in some time. He really needed to get out more.</p><p align="left">`Grading papers, mostly.`</p><p align="right">`ur a teacher? what do u teach?`</p><p align="left">Hadn't this man been trying to reach a-- a lover, presumably? Or, since he didn't seem to mind Remus' intercepting of his picture, it was probably just a sex thing. As if he'd be interested in a stodgy widower who mentally referred to a stranger's hook-up as their <em>lover.</em></p><p align="left">`Secondary level physics and literature.`</p><p align="right">`shoulda guessed the lit, ur all proper spelling and such. strange combo tho`</p><p align="left">`You're not the first to think so. I like the balance.`</p><p align="left">There was no reply for several minutes, and Remus went back to grading, assuming the stranger had gotten bored or finally gotten into contact with who he'd <em> meant </em> to talk to. It was a fun distraction while it lasted, anyway.</p><p align="left">He lost track of time in his grading, and only realized he'd dozed off on the couch when his phone buzzed once more.</p><p align="right">`nice talking to u remus. have a good one`</p><p align="left">It was such an innocuous message, but it made a lump sit heavy in his throat. It seemed so caring.</p><p align="left">It had really been far too long since he'd socialized with adults other than his co-workers, Harry, and a handful of other former students.</p><p align="left">"You're a mess, Lupin. He doesn't know you from Adam." He muttered to himself, groaning as he made to his feet off the couch. At least the text had woken him up so he could get to bed proper.</p>
