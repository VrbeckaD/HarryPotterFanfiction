              <p>After the war, Draco Malfoy found himself adrift. Pardoned by the ministry and hated by the wizarding public, Draco somehow found himself in a relationship of sorts with Harry Potter. Draco believes he doesn't deserve this, and it's only a matter of time before Harry figures that out. When Draco makes a big mistake and ruins his relationship, it’s up to him to put his life together and be the hero of his own story.</p>

    <p>The music was too loud, the liquor was overpriced and the company was miserable. He hated these outings; really outings of any kind. He was reminded every time he left the house that if he stubbornly insisted on existing that he should do it somewhere where his presence wouldn’t be a burden to his fellow wizards. A short trip to the shops resulted in cold stares, snide comments, and shopkeepers refusing to serve him. Occasionally people threw things. Once a woman walked right up to him in the street and slapped him.</p><p>It had been 5 years since he was acquitted and people were no less angry at him now than they were the day he walked out of the Ministry a free man. After his trial, he’d had to adjust the Manor’s wards to refuse all incoming owls to stop the howlers. For most people, this would be an inconvenience, but since there was really nobody left that would want to send he and his mother mail anyway, it didn’t much matter. Now for the most part he tried to avoid all wizarding communities. This wasn’t foolproof given the amount of wizarding youth living in muggle London, but it was something. </p><p>Luckily, even after almost 8 months nobody had yet caught wind that Draco was in a relationship of sorts with Harry Potter. They weren’t exactly hiding it per se, just being highly discreet. After 5 years, most of the Pottermania had died down,partly due to the fact that Harry rarely did anything interesting these days. But if they caught wind that Harry Potter was seeing Draco Malfoy, he wondered if the world would ever get over it. He suspected there’d be lynch mobs forming in the street. Imagine, their precious Chosen One degrading himself by choosing to be with the likes of him. </p><p>To be fair, most of the time Draco couldn’t believe it either. He felt in awe every day that beautiful man looked at <i>him</i> and saw something he wanted, that he had done so for nearly a year without growing tired of him. </p><p>Harry had gone to hell and back and somehow had come out the other end able to laugh. One afternoon they had been out flying together, there was a light drizzle, and when Harry attempted a Wronski Feint, he slid off his broom and into a mud puddle. Draco rushed over to help only to find Potter laughing. He had asked him then how he did it, how he could still laugh so easily. </p><p>Harry stopped, looked him in the eye and said, “Because in the end we won, we are surrounded by love and we live in the world we fought for. If I crumbled, I would dishonour the people that died to get us here.” </p><p>In that moment Draco could see again the man from those days after the battle, the leader, the hero. </p><p>And then Harry laughed and said, “Besides some things are just funny”. He flung some mud into Draco’s white blond hair and before he could even register his shock, Potter was back on his broom, flying towards the trees.</p><p>Alone with Harry were the only times he actually believed he was allowed to be happy. The rest of the world was certainly quick to remind him that the happiness won by the war didn’t belong to people like him. But they were right, weren’t they? And yet here he was, dragged along and sweating in the middle of a hot, overpacked muggle club with Harry’s friends. They of course knew and only the knowledge that they would never do anything to hurt Harry made him feel relatively safe when he was forced to accompany Harry on these outings.</p><p>He was sitting alone in a crowd of people and yet he still felt like all of their eyes were on him, the Death Eater, the coward, the criminal amongst them. They would never say anything to his face, but his presence made them uncomfortable. Harry insisted he needed to give it time,  that he needed to put in a better effort, but honestly, what was he meant to say? “Sorry I tried to have most of you tortured and killed, thanks for tolerating me on this little outing because your best friend said you had to be nice to me.” He supposed they tried as best they could, but the results were always cringeworthy at best on both sides.</p><p> “Oi Malfoy! You look hot! Why don’t you roll up your sleeves?” shouted Finnigan from across the table smiling. “Oh...that’s right. Nevermind!” and quickly turned back to Hannah.</p><p>He had to get out of here. He looked over at Harry, who was in the midst of what appeared to be a wildly entertaining conversation with Lee and Neville. Draco couldn’t take him away from all these people while he was so happy. </p><p>Fuck it. </p><p>Harry wouldn’t notice if he was gone anyway. He was going for a smoke. Draco stepped outside into the cool night air and took a deep breath. He leaned his head back against the wall and rolled up his sleeves, releasing his forearms from their sartorial prison. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette, desperate for the soothing buzz of nicotine. He fished out his lighter and flicked it. Again. And again. And again.</p><p>“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” he mumbled as he hunched over, cigarette between his lips, hands shaking and flicking the goddamn thing till he finally chucked it into the street. He collapsed back against the wall dejectedly. </p><p>“Need a hand there mate?” Draco looked up into playful grey-blue eyes. </p><p>“Yeah, thanks.” He lit Draco’s cigarette and then his own. </p><p>“No problem. It’s a fucking lot in there,” said the man as he leaned against the wall beside Draco. </p><p>“Tell me about it.” Draco exhaled, watching the white tendrils curl up toward the street lamp. He took another soothing lungful and closed his eyes. </p><p>“B.J.” </p><p>Draco coughed out a puff of smoke and turned. </p><p>“That’s my name. Benjamin Jackson. But my friends call me B.J.”</p><p> Draco snorted.</p><p>“Oh you think that’s bad do you? My middle name is Jackson, my last name is Allman. My parents named me B.J. All Man, and then they had the gall to be surprised when I told them I was gay,” he smiled.  </p><p>Draco laughed and held out his hand. “Draco Abraxas Malfoy”</p><p>“Oh you’re one to judge!” B.J. laughed, “ Draco huh? That’s a new one. Besides, your initials spell DAM.”</p><p>Draco chuckled and took another inhale. “Yeah, well I feel damned most of the time.” </p><p>This man must be a muggle then. How nice, he thought, blowing smoke into the crisp night air. Oh the irony that now, only among muggles, was he truly free.</p><p>“So you come here often?” B.J. grinned.</p><p>“That’s the best you’ve got?” Draco raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“I believe in the classics.”</p><p>Draco turned his head, “No, got dragged here. You?”</p><p>“Meh. Sometimes, frankly, I’m a little over the whole scene in there.”</p><p>“Me too.” Draco took a long, calming drag.</p><p>“Is that so?” B.J. raised an eyebrow. “Well to quote another classic, how ‘bout you and I get out of here? And by out of here I mean into that alley and see if we can keep each other entertained for a few?”</p><p>Draco’s mouth went dry. He stared at the man and exhaled. He was fit, tall, slender but well-muscled. He had a stubbled chin that gave the air of a man who was carefree and didn’t make plans. His eyes were bright and his mouth was curved in a mischievous smile. He looked at Draco and he didn’t see the liar, the arrogant racist child he had been, the attempted murderer, the prison sentence he had narrowly avoided. He saw a cute 20-something blond with a nice arse. Something he could never be to those people inside. </p><p>Inside...Harry...Stupid Harry who was too good for his own good. That beautiful man who thought that the world could change because he wanted it to. Who thought that he could wash Draco clean and that somehow he’d be worthy. He’d figure it out soon enough and then where would Draco be? Alone in his cold Manor. A prison of his entire life’s making. And when that day came, he wouldn’t even have the memory of this one person that wanted him like he was any other bloke standing outside a club. Who didn’t flinch at the name Malfoy. Besides, even if Harry knew, would he really even care? He might be a little upset, sure, but what was Draco in the end to him really, when he could pick anyone he wanted?</p><p>Still... </p><p>He dropped his cigarette, snuffed it out and smiled. “Maybe another time yeah?” </p><p>“I got a couple mates in from out of town for the next couple weeks. Should be here next week if you change your mind.” B.J. winked, took another drag and leaned back.</p><p> </p><p>------------</p><p> </p><p>Draco re-entered the club, rolling down his sleeves as he walked back towards the rest of the group. Harry was now occupied holding up what seemed to be a heavily intoxicated, rambling Parvati Patil and looking rather amused and sheepish. Great. Draco sank back down and stared at his drink. He tossed it back and wished just for a moment that he could belong here. Greg never went anywhere anymore, not since...he shook his head. Blaise was always flitting in and out of the country, not a care in the world. He still saw Pans regularly but two people in a club does not a party make. </p><p>Someone startled him out of his reverie by plopping down next to him and leaning back against the plush seat. “Oh hi,” said a highly relaxed Lovegood. </p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Whatcha doin’?” she sighed contentedly as she rolled her head over to look at him.</p><p>“Drinking my drink, what are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m enjoying an evening with my friends.” She smiled. “Harry looks like he could use a hand.” She chuckled.</p><p>“Yes, well, Harry saved the world. I think he can handle a drunk girl.”</p><p>“Hmm...maybe.” Her eyes began to close and she hummed to herself.</p><p>At that moment, Harry looked up and caught Draco’s eye. He smiled, turned to Lee and gestured for him to take his place. He walked over to Draco and said, “Hey, you ‘bout ready to go?”</p><p>Draco gave a barely convincing smile in return. “Whenever you are.” </p><p>“I think this lot have just about had it for the evening.” Harry turned and looked at Luna. “Is someone getting you home tonight?”</p><p>“Padma’s in charge of Parvati and I tonight. Night boys. Thanks for taking care of me. I’m lucky to have such wonderful friends.” </p><p>She squeezed Draco’s hand. Harry smiled and patted her head fondly. He put his arm around Draco’s waist and smiled that impossibly bright smile again. “Shall we?”</p><p>They walked outside and headed in the direction of Harry’s flat. Harry leaned in to kiss him and abruptly pulled away “Ugh...You know I hate it when you smoke!”</p><p>“Sorry, it was just a bit hot in there. I needed a break.” Draco grinned, ”But I’ll tell you what, if you hate the smell so much, when we get back to your flat, we can hop in the shower and you can scrub me clean.”</p><p>Harry laughed, “You’d better not be toying with me, Malfoy.” He whipped him down an alley, pulled him close and Apparated them home.</p><p> </p><p>------------</p><p> </p><p>The following week passed as every week before it had. Draco went to work in the lower levels of Gringotts, handling people’s boring accounts and finances but grateful to be out of the public eye. Harry went to work training auror cadets and came home with various bruises from sparring practice, entertaining tales of who fucked up on the practise course by failing to anticipate that the cat in the corner was an Animagus, and an endless stream of gossip about the sordid lives of various coworkers. Then they ordered take away and watched crap telly. </p><p>Draco had to hand it to the muggles. There was something deeply satisfying at the end of the day to just turn your brain off and watch other peoples’ lives fly past. He especially liked that blond man who shouted at people and called them morons for not being able to accomplish the basic task of chopping, measuring and heating ingredients to the proper temperature. </p><p>“It’s not that hard!” he’d shout at the bloody thing, and Potter would smirk and dig into his curry.<br/>
He liked this. Here in Potter’s flat he felt safe. It was more of a home than anywhere else had been in a long time. He didn’t know what he was going to do when the day inevitably came that he no longer had it to come home to. But for now, there was curry, and telly, and the scent of Potter’s stupid jumpers as he snuggled against him on the sofa.</p><p>“So the kids want to go round to the club again on Saturday. Guess Lee’s finally landed himself that WWN Quidditch-casting gig and they all want to celebrate.” Draco cringed internally. “And I was thinking it might be nice for us to go out and grab a bite together before we meet up with them. I thought I could take you someplace nice.” </p><p>Draco closed his eyes and fought back the panic at the idea of having to go out again this weekend. Not only that, but to go to a proper restaurant and risk some zealous reporter snapping a photo and plastering it all over <i>The Prophet</i> for people to judge. Was Potter mad? Why couldn’t he leave well enough alone. The more they went out, the sooner Potter would realise he couldn’t possibly keep Draco, and that would be the end of it. Draco sighed; there was no use fighting it. </p><p>“Sure,” he said, and smiled that little smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Whatever you’d like, Harry.” </p><p>Harry, the idiot, looked delighted. “Great! I’ll make us some reservations! I’m stuffed, do you want any more of this?”</p><p>Draco shook his head no, and Harry set the carton on the coffee table. He leaned back and gestured for Draco to rest his head in his lap. Draco complied, and Harry did that thing Draco loved where he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. Usually, it made him feel sleepy and relaxed, but tonight all it did was fill him with dread. Someday, he was going to lose this. He closed his eyes and pretended to sleep, trying desperately not to cry. </p><p> </p><p>------------</p><p>Draco arrived to meet Harry on Saturday in a pair of his best dark blue denims and a soft, thin, sapphire blue v-neck jumper. When Harry opened the door, he smiled, pulled him in, and kissed him. God, Draco thought he would never get tired of the taste of Harry’s mouth. It was tea and biscuits and those little mints he always liked to suck on. He was hungry for the little noises Harry made when he grabbed Draco’s waist to pull him closer. Draco could die here. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and began to devour him, pressing himself against Potter as tightly as he could, until he felt hands slide to the front of his hips and push him back gently.</p><p>“Hey there stranger,” Harry beamed at him. “God, you look gorgeous tonight,” he said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Draco’s ear and planting a gentle kiss on his lips. “We better get going; we don’t want to be late for our reservation.”</p><p>Draco nodded, taking a moment to look Harry over. Gone were the days of ratty, oversized hand-me-downs and general unkemptness. This Harry looked stunning in denims that fit like they were made for him and an emerald green button-down that made his eyes practically glow. It was unbuttoned a bit at the top, the sleeves rolled up, showing off his tanned muscular forearms. His hair was still a bit wild, but with a windswept roguish charm that practically begged Draco to pin him up against the nearest surface and run his fingers through it. </p><p>Harry swept them out of the flat and led them to a posh italian place not far away. He gave his name, and as they waited for their table he suddenly looked nervous. “I hope this is ok...er…I mean, I didn’t exactly ask what sort of place you felt like going to, and I read some good things about this one and...you know...it seemed nice and I thought…”</p><p>“Shhhhh,” Draco smiled, “You’re rambling like an idiot.” </p><p>Harry smiled back and took Draco’s hand. “Yeah, well, it’s just we never really do anything like this so I wanted it to be nice.”</p><p>Draco’s heart broke a little. God, how he wanted to keep this. He wanted to reach out and grab Potter and shout, “I’m keeping you! This is mine! This is the one thing I can have! I want it and I’m not letting go no matter what anyone says!” But he’d never do that. He’d never saddle Harry permanently to him and drag him down for the rest of his life. So he just smiled and said, “I love italian. Thank you.”</p><p>Harry’s face lit up and he was about to speak when they were interrupted.</p><p>“Potter! Table for two! Right this way please.” They were led to an intimate little table and handed their menus and a wine list. </p><p>Harry looked adorably helpless as he glanced over the wine selection, so Draco smiled and ordered wine and appetisers for them.</p><p>The wine came and Harry began to relax as they discussed the upcoming match between the Harpies and the Tornadoes and bickered amiably about the new recruits. When their appetiser arrived, a pan seared scallop with crispy pancetta and a green pea purée, Harry looked down and smiled, “Hey, these are those things your favorite chef guy is always yelling about cooking properly!”</p><p>“Look at you,” Draco winked. “It seems you aren’t a total heathen after all, and here I thought you weren’t paying attention.”</p><p>“I’m always paying attention to you…”</p><p>Draco blushed furiously, “Yes well, anyway. I thought you might like to try them.”</p><p>Their courses came and went and Draco became pleasantly lightheaded from the wine, especially when he felt Potter’s ankle brush his under the table. It was like he was living someone else’s life and he could pretend for right now that it could go on like this forever. </p><p>As they were finishing up their tiramisu, Harry grinned and excused himself to go to the men’s. When he stood, suddenly there was a shout from behind Draco. </p><p>“Harry! Is that you?”</p><p>Harry looked up abruptly, “Anthony?”</p><p>“It <i>is</i> you!” Anthony Goldstein said as he approached, pulling Harry in for a firm hug and smiling mischievously, “My...the years since the war have been good to you. I haven’t seen you in ages...Are you living in London?”</p><p>“Yeah, I live just a few blocks away actually,” Harry said, looking a little flustered by the sudden whirlwind of attention.</p><p>“Really? Me too…” He put hand on Harry’s arm and said, “I’m surprised I haven’t seen you around before. We should get together sometime. When are you free? We could do tomorrow for brunch if you like. I also know a really great Thai place, we could go out to dinner next Friday. Do you like Thai?” He began to brush his thumb back and forth on Harry’s bicep.</p><p>“Yeah I do.. It’s just that…”</p><p>“No excuses. It’s been far too long. I always wanted to get to know you better back in school but the timing wasn’t right, what with the war and having to train <i>ourselves</i> to fight that Death Eater scum, but you always looked so sexy when—”</p><p>“Anthony. You remember Draco,” Harry blurted out. </p><p>Anthony turned, having obviously not noticed or cared who Harry’s companion was and his expression soured. “Malfoy.” He nodded curtly. </p><p>“Goldstein.” Draco stood and held out his hand politely, but Goldstein didn’t move to take it. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” </p><p>“Er, <i>hem</i>,” Harry coughed behind him. “We’re on a date.” </p><p>“Oh...How nice.” Goldstein said with measured courtesy. He schooled his features into something akin to a charming smile, “Well, I suppose I’ll leave you gentlemen to your evening.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a card. “Here’s all my information, Harry. I’d love for you to get in touch some time soon when you’re—” he gave a little cough and a wink”—free.” </p><p>“Yes well, thank you for stopping by. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to use the men’s room and then Draco and I have plans.”</p><p> </p><p>“Certainly.” </p><p>Harry nodded and headed off to find the loo. No sooner was he out of earshot than Goldstein rounded on Draco, poking a finger in his chest hard enough to bruise. “Now you listen to me, you murderous piece of shit.” Draco blanched. “I don’t know what your game is, or what you’re after chasing a man who is obviously too good for you. We all know you don’t give a fuck about anyone but yourself. Do you think I forgot what it was like living in the Room of Requirement like a refugee while you and your cronies swanned around the castle helping your twisted master? Because I don’t. Potter may buy your brainwashed, terrified, abused child act, but frankly the rest of us don’t give a shit if it’s true or not. You belong in Azkaban. Or better yet an empty fucking shell. I hear that’s how your mummy got old Lucius back. Nothing more than a blank, lifeless zombie she has to feed twice a day. Heard it broke dear ol’ mum’s heart and she hasn’t been seen or heard outside since. Harry’ll figure out what you are soon enough, once he’s had his fill of that pretty arse of yours. Glad you’re good for <i>something</i>. But if he doesn’t, don’t worry, he has friends that care about him who will be more than happy to show him what you really are. You’re a criminal and you deserve to suffer for your sins.” Goldstein spat at Dracos feet, and with that he was gone. </p><p>Draco fell back in his chair as if he’d been slapped. He felt like he might be sick. He stared blankly at the spit on his shoe. The world was blurring down to that single viscous spot on brown leather...</p><p>“Hello! Draco...Hey!”</p><p>Draco’s head snapped up and looked straight into concerned emerald green eyes. </p><p>“Hey, are you ok? I waved at you from the door and called to tell you the check was paid, but I guess you didn’t hear me.”</p><p>Draco swallowed hard, “Oh, right, sorry, must be the wine going to my head.”</p><p>Harry smiled warmly and held out his hand. Draco reached a shaky hand out and took it. Potter’s grip tightened and pulled him up. “Well, a nice walk will do you some good.” </p><p>Harry’s smile was infectious, and Draco almost started to feel better as he was led out of the restaurant, till he turned and saw Goldstein’s narrowed eyes following them. He mustn’t forget. He was trash. He had no right to this. </p><p>They walked down the street into the brisk night air. Harry was swinging their arms back and forth like a kid. God, he was naive. Naive but wonderful. He knew they couldn’t live like this forever:happy normal people walking down the street, swinging their arms and skipping like one of them isn’t a cowardly, lying bastard. Fuck this. A few blocks from the club, Draco had had it. He may not deserve it, but he was a Slytherin goddamnit, and if in this one moment he can take what he wants and not be punished for it, then he was fucking going to.</p><p>He pushed Harry against a shop window and kissed him. He wasn’t timid or submissive like he usually was with Harry. He didn’t follow Harry’s lead. He simply took. He could feel Harry begin to melt beneath him, his knees growing weak, so he wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling their hips together and holding him up at the same time. He remembered earlier how badly he had wanted to run his fingers through that wild mop of luxurious hair, so he did, tousling the raven locks with his long pale fingers till they finally came to rest on the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s thumb caressed Harry’s cheek and he could feel Harry fall apart beneath him, gasping and moaning into the kiss as his prick frantically rubbed against Draco’s thigh. </p><p>Draco pulled back, dragging his hand to cup Harry’s cheek and putting his thumb into Harry’s eager mouth. Harry sucked it greedily as he moaned, wantonly rutting against Draco. Draco grabbed Harry’s ass and pushed his hungry dick firmly against his thigh. He wanted to feel in this moment how much Harry Potter wanted him. Slowly, he dragged his thumb out of Harry’s mouth and rested it on his lower lip as he stared into Harry’s lust-fogged emerald eyes. </p><p>Remember this.</p><p>Harry’s eyes sharpened and his wanting gaze pierced him. “Jesus, Draco…” he panted, eyes wide in amazement. Draco smirked, leaned in, and planted another firm kiss to Harry’s lips before stepping back. Harry nearly collapsed. He looked ravished and beautiful and like he’d won the fucking lottery. He smiled and launched himself at Draco, holding him firmly in a tight embrace, one arm around his waist the other tangled in his har. His face nuzzling into Draco’s neck. Then he backed up and offered Draco his hand. Draco took it and Harry kissed him sweetly on the lips.</p><p>What a beautiful fool. </p><p>They continued down the street, slowly beginning to hear the chatter and the rumble of the club ahead. As they made their way inside, Harry immediately began to scan the room for his friends. The second he spotted them, he took off like a shot, leaving Draco alone, presumably to go and fetch them some drinks like an errand boy, Draco thought bitterly. He watched as Potter rushed into the throng and was immediately leapt upon by Lee Jordan. Literally leapt upon. Lee jumped at him, wrapped his arms and legs around Harry and squealed in excitement. Harry laughed good naturedly and set him down.</p><p>The years had been kind to Lee. He was no longer the short, smirking, kid with a microphone, his face had refined itself till it was all sharp angles you could practically cut yourself on, not to mention he’d grown taller and broader. The bloke looked like a bloody supermodel. If he was honest with himself, he’d always liked Lee. Sure, he was a twat to the Slytherin team in his match commentary, but Draco had to admit he was always clever and quick on his feet, and he would have been bloody hilarious if the jokes weren’t at Draco’s expense. The things he could have done with him had he been in Slytherin. Harry could be happy with someone like Lee. </p><p>Draco continued to watch as Harry was swarmed and welcomed by the entire assembly, and noticed, not for the first time, that he didn’t even seem to miss Draco’s absence when he was among these people. Bloody tosser could have anyone he wanted. What the fuck did he need Draco for? In the end, he’d go back to his life and pick someone new to watch telly and eat takeaway with and the only person who would have paid for it would be Draco. Because Harry had given him a taste of something he was never entitled to. If he’d never known what those sweet moments of being held and cared for felt like, he’d never feel the aching, shattering withdrawal that would come from them being ripped away. </p><p>He walked to the bar, ordered a double scotch, and threw it back in one gulp. Then he ordered another and leaned back against the bar. Hell if he was going to go over there and feel like an outcast. He’d rather stay right here and just be an anonymous bloke at the bar. </p><p>That’s when he saw him, laughing with a man and two women at the other end of the bar, that impish grin and those puckish eyes were unmistakable.</p><p>B.J. didn’t know or care about his past, he just liked what he saw. Suddenly, blue eyes looked up and caught his and that smile was directed at him. Goldstein’s words echoed around and around in his head—</p><p><i>“You murderous piece of shit.”</i> </p><p><i>“You don’t give a fuck about anyone but yourself.”</i> </p><p><i>“Glad you’re good for something.”</i> </p><p>
  <i>“He’ll figure it out.”</i>
</p><p>Draco wanted to scream. He downed the rest of his drink and looked over at Potter and his friends. They were happy, carefree, and Harry, that bastard, didn’t even notice he was missing. Fuck it. If they thought he was a piece of shit who didn’t give a fuck about anybody, then he’d be one. At least he was good for something. Fuck Harry. So what if he might feel a little angry or upset if he found out. He could take any one of them home. Tonight, Draco was going to be a regular guy getting what he wanted from a handsome stranger.</p><p>He turned back to B.J. who had an eyebrow quirked at him. Draco smiled and gestured with his head toward the door. B.J.’s smile grew and he nodded. He turned to excuse himself from his friends and Draco set down his glass and walked out the front door. </p><p> </p><p>The night air hit Draco like a rush of freedom, his heart was pounding in his chest. He took a deep breath and suddenly arms captured him around the waist from behind and a wicked voice whispered in his ear, “Hey there, stranger.”</p><p>Something about those words made him shiver and feel uncertain, but he brushed that aside and turned around. “Your alley or mine?”</p><p>B.J. burst out into laughter. “I told you the classics always work.” And then he kissed him. B.J.’s kiss was sinful and decadent, but there was still a hint of laughter bubbling up between them. He tasted of whiskey and cigarettes and he smelled of cotton and leather. He felt himself being slowly guided backward till they were in the alley, and Draco was pushed up against a wall.</p><p>His arms were pinned above his head as B.J. began licking and sucking on the side of Draco’s neck. He heard himself moan as he heard B.J. murmur, “God I was hoping you’d be here tonight.” Teeth came up to nip his earlobe while one hand went down to cup at his crotch through his denims. “I’ve been thinking about you all week, you gorgeous bastard.”</p><p>“Fuck!” Draco gasped as a hand opened his flies, snaked its way into his trousers, and wrapped itself around his already hard cock.</p><p>“Mmmm, you want this bad, don’t you baby?” Draco closed his eyes and nodded, reveling in the sensations washing over him. “Say it.” B.J. swooped in and kissed him fiercely, claiming his mouth and taking what he wanted. He pulled back abruptly, and Draco, suddenly bereft of touch, moved to follow. “I need you to say it. I need you to tell me what you want to do here. I don’t want to push you too hard or take advantage of you, but I do want to make you feel good, and God, do I want to get off with you. I’m aching right now, but I need you to tell me what you want.”</p><p>Draco groaned, “Ahhh, I want you to make me come and I...hmmm…FUCK...I want you...want you to fuck me...make me feel good...make me forget…”</p><p>B.J. smiled lovingly as he stroked Draco gently. “Ahhh now love...I don’t know what you need to forget, and I can’t promise I can help with that.” Draco whimpered, and B.J. continued, “But I’m sorry you don’t feel good...I <i>can</i> help with that. For right now anyway.” And he kissed Draco gently, a promise of something good. </p><p>For right now. </p><p>“You ready love?” Draco nodded and B.J. turned him around lowering his pants and trousers and reaching into his pocket for lube. He prepped Draco carefully, almost tenderly. Draco braced himself with his arms against the wall and his cheek against the brick. B.J. slid on a condom and lined himself up. “Are you ok?” </p><p>Something good for right now. </p><p>Draco nodded and B.J. pushed himself in slowly with a low groan. He put his hands on Draco’s hips and stilled when he bottomed out, breathing heavily into his ear. </p><p>Draco’s heart was pounding and he nodded, “You can go now. C’mon B.J.. Do it. Please. Give me right now. Fuck everything else. I want one good thing just for right now.” </p><p>B.J. understood and kissed Draco’s cheek. He pulled out and began thrusting into him in earnest. </p><p>The heat of B.J. against his back, the feeling of his balls slapping against him, the fullness inside, the sensation of two men just taking pleasure from each other. No expectations, no history, no bullshit. Just this. This bliss. Just for now. He moaned. He was pushing back, impaling himself on B.J.’s thick, hard cock. </p><p>“Fuck, Draco. Christ, you’re so good, so tight, yeah fuck me back, that’s it baby, take it, take my cock…” Draco started to touch himself but B.J. slapped his hand away. He wrapped one arm around Draco’s chest, the other around his prick and whispered in his ear, “Uh-uh baby, that’s mine for now too, I’m afraid.” He began pumping Draco’s dick in time with each thrust into his hole. Draco keened at the exquisite feeling of being taken. And then he heard it.</p><p>A panicked voice. </p><p>Draco froze.</p><p>“No! Jesus Christ, Nev! Let me go! I have to find him!”</p><p>He heard frantic steps. Then green eyes and a shock of raven hair rounded the corner and froze. Harry looked like he’d been physically struck. He looked down to where B.J.’s cock disappeared inside Draco, and then trailed up to meet Draco’s eyes. For just a moment, Draco could see disbelief, horror, anger, betrayal, and anguish all warring in those green depths. Then Harry suddenly disappeared back around the corner. Draco could hear retching and Neville shouting, “Harry! Harry! Are you okay, mate?” </p><p>B.J.’s cock unceremoniously flopped out of him and he hastily tucked it away. Draco saw the edge of Harry’s shoulder as he collapsed back against the wall and slid down it.</p><p>“Harry! What the…” Then Neville rounded the corner. He quickly assessed the situation, and his eyes hardened, his face turning red. Draco no longer saw the easygoing, huggable botanist. Neville transformed before his eyes into the general that stood up to Voldemort in the final battle. </p><p>“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Neville said. His usually genial voice pitched low and deadly. “I told him. We all fucking told him to cut you loose. But he refused. Do you have any idea how worried he’s been looking for you? Practically tore the fucking place apart! He swore he needed to keep you safe. He was about to call the fucking Aurors, swore there was no way you’d leave without him voluntarily and that there were people out there that wanted to hurt you. Well I don’t know about then, but there are fucking now!”</p><p>Neville took three swift steps toward him and decked him. </p><p>Draco went down without a fight shaking quietly.</p><p>Neville crouched down next to him.</p><p>“He insisted that you were different. That you had changed. <i>He’s sweet</i> he said, so when he kept bringing you along we tried to be nice to you. But you just sat there. Stiff and cold as ice. Immovable, staring off into the distance. <i>He’s just scared</i> he said. We wanted to like you, Malfoy. We really did, because for a year we saw the smile Harry had slowly lost in the war come back to him. So we tried Malfoy. But you, are fucking DONE NOW.”</p><p>He grabbed Draco by the collar and slammed him against the wall, his skull smacking against it with a loud crack.</p><p>“Okay Okay, mate, that’s enough.” B.J. had stepped in and was trying to pull Neville off of Draco, but Neville held onto his throat like a terrier with a bone screaming, “We trusted him with you. He fucking <i>loved</i> you, you BASTARD!”</p><p>B.J. finally succeeded in pulling Neville free, just as Neville spat directly in his face.</p><p>That’s two in one night, Draco thought numbly. <i>I must be popular</i>. He began to laugh maniacally as he collapsed to the ground. He could hear Neville consoling Harry in the distance. Oh god...Harry was crying...He’d never heard Harry cry before...What had he done? </p><p>He was curled up in a ball as memories swam through his head; Harry petting his hair, Harry’s excitement when he had agreed to go on a real date, Harry looking sheepish and nervous at the restaurant, Harry saying “I always pay attention to you Draco”, the look of bliss on Harry’s face when Draco had kissed him against the shop window. </p><p>Oh god…He’d missed it. He’d been so busy listening to the hatred in his own head, he couldn’t see the love in front of him and now it was too late. He’d become everything they’d thought he was. He was a selfish bastard:he was a piece of shit, and Harry <i>was</i> too good for him. He deserved to rot in Azkaban for hurting a man as wonderful as Harry the way he had. Goldstein was right: he needed suffer for his sins. </p><p>Suddenly, gentle hands were on him, examining the cut on his face and Draco flinched.</p><p>“Shh...shh...shh, it’s just me. They’re gone.”</p><p>Draco curled away and began to sob in earnest, pulling himself into a tighter ball. He needed to stay down. Just stay here till everything went away.</p><p>“Hey...come on now…” He recognized B.J.’s voice and looked up.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“Sounds like you fucked up pretty bad there mate.” He could hear the gentle smile in B.J.’s voice.</p><p>“Why are you still here?” Draco said as B.J. slowly pulled him up into a sitting position.</p><p>“Hey, I may have just been on the pull, but I’m not such a bastard I’m gonna leave a crying, bleeding man alone in an alley with his cock out.” B.J. said “You might want to see to that by the way.”</p><p>Draco looked down embarrassed and tucked himself away. He couldn’t look up.</p><p>“Ok, well that’s one down.” B.J. said, “I had a bit of medical training in the Navy. I don’t think you have a serious head injury, although you’ll have a nasty lump and a powerful headache in the morning. Now let’s get you home.” </p><p>Draco looked around, he wasn’t sure where he should go. He spent most nights at Harry’s, only going to the Manor grab fresh clothes and say hello to Mother. </p><p>B.J. seemed to read what Draco was thinking because he smiled sadly and said, “Ahhh… you lived with him, did you? Well it looks like you made a right cock-up of things.”</p><p>Draco began to cry again and B.J. pulled him close. “Shh...it’s ok. We all do at some point in our lives.”</p><p>“Yeah, well I seem to be particularly gifted.” </p><p>“Ahh! A man after my own heart. Welcome to the club mate, we have t-shirts!” B.J. laughed. “Okay, well, first things first. Do you have a friend you can stay with?” </p><p>Draco couldn’t think. Everything was all a blur, but suddenly it came to him, “P...Pansy. She’s my best friend.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” B.J. said, standing up quickly and extending a hand to help Draco up.</p><p>Draco took it warily but allowed himself to be hoisted up. “Why are you doing this?” he asked,  eyeing B.J. suspiciously.</p><p>B.J. smiled again,”I have no nefarious intentions friend. You seem like an okay bloke. But lost, and if you don’t mind me saying, in need of a little bit of kindness and repair. Besides, what can I say? We fuck-ups gotta stick together. Now, let's get you to this Pansy.”</p>
