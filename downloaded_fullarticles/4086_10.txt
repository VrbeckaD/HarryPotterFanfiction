    <p>“Please.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Sirius, please, just…do this for me?”</p><p>“I’d love to, really, I would, but see I got this thing called Quidditch practice after those god forsaken classes are over, and I’m really no trying to fill my schedule by joining a sad group of misfits. You’re on your own, Remus.”</p><p>Spring. Long forgotten sunshine reflects from open castle windows and illuminates the sky with a new freshness, happiness even. Flowers start budding, finally awake from slumber, dyeing the plain grass fields in their various pretty colours. The temperature rises, but there still lingers a certain chill coming from the water. Students pile into courtyards, wander around the grounds, enjoy the weather until it’s inevitably ruined by rain again. Britain. Britain never changes. But alas, with a quickening step Remus Lupin follows after his best friend with an air of frustration, even if he doesn’t wish to voice it. Sirius had always been dismissive of his advances to get him to join…Well, now that he thinks of it, Sirius isn’t the type to sit around and listen to poetry in some hidden away corner of the castle. If it doesn’t involve mischief or pretty girls, Sirius generally isn’t interested…</p><p>On the other hand, there are a few pretty girls…Well, namely <em>one</em> pretty girl. Which Remus wants to impress. But he is hardly as head-strong or charming as his best mate, and wooing her alone would be futile. He needs help. At the very least moral support. Peter is no good with romance. James can hardly utter a coherent sentence to Lily. This leaves the one and only Sirius Black, which Remus knows is really no better than the rest of them, but does he really have a choice?</p><p>“I’ll pay you.” Remus pleads as a last resort. Sirius only laughs, glancing at him before his dark eyes trail back to the faraway Quidditch Pitch.</p><p>“Hell, Remus, never took you for the desperate type.  Why not just ask Peter? I’m sure he’ll be happy to tag along.” Sirius offers. Remus shakes his head. This is no use. He will have to think of something else. As he looks up he is met with a cloudless sky. Its vastness is dizzying. It occurs to him that he gets a similar feeling when he peers into her eyes.</p><p>Remus clears his throat, “Well…” He scratches the back of his head, “The meetings take place during the night, and—“ He has to hold in a smile when Sirius turns to him curiously, “It’s all girls, mostly. I thought that, since you’re my friend, you’d tag along. Even out the—“</p><p>“I’m in.”</p><p>--</p><p>The sky behind the window is inky black and irritated by stars like glass shards which are, in great care, stuck to it. Sirius sees the far away horizon, the eerie tree tops of the Forbidden Forrest swaying in the wind…And his own reflection, illuminated by a pale light coming from his wand. Remus stands nervously behind him, checking a book of some sort before he nudges his shoulder and orders to move down these cold empty corridors.</p><p>Whispers greet them as they pass. Their footsteps dull on the carpeting, cloaks swish like ghosts by their sides and portraits continue to mumble in their sleep. Before sneaking out the Common Room, Remus had informed him that the meeting place changes every time in case the teachers or those who want to have a laugh crash the party. Sirius asked why on earth aren’t they meeting in daylight. “Not like you have anything better to do” he then added. What surprised him is Remus’s response, the strange glint in his eyes, the smile that was both soft and weirdly passionate “You will find out”. While the answer did sound a bit ominous, it was more intriguing than anything.</p><p>It is easy to get confused whilst wandering these halls at night. Shadows cast a strange spell and everything appears different, and Sirius is sure that <em>yes</em>, he <em>knows</em> this place, and if only he could put a daytime filter on it he would recognise it right away. But now, in the dark, he is oblivious to his surroundings. Only when Remus tugs him to a lonely door by his left does he even realize it is there. And finally he feels his lungs fill with excitement. With a blooming grin on his face – an expression similar to childish mischief – he turns to the ever nervous Remus, who nods at him before shoving a piece of paper into his hand.</p><p>“Play nice.” Remus reminds him quietly before hooking his fingers into the handle and trying his best not to make a sound as he opens it.  The light goes out with a low ‘<em>Nox’</em>. He isn’t sure what to expect when he enters the room, but as the door closes behind him the darkness melts into warm yellow lights that brighten up the interior just enough for him not to trip and fall over his two feet.</p><p>The classroom is small and packed. A scent of old books and daisy perfume lingers in the air along with a tint of dust. The crowd grows quiet when they notice him. He sees many familiar faces, many girls that at first question why he’s here and only later smile and bat their lashes in the pretty way they do. He moves away from them after wishing the group a lovely evening, to which they cheerily respond. A few boys linger by the windows, greet him sleepily, ask him what the girls are too polite to wonder aloud: Why are you here?</p><p>“Remus worked his charm on me.” Sirius grins, “Couldn’t resist him. Not sure anyone can.”</p><p>“Yea, well, you’re just in time, then.” One of the boys says, “We about to start.”</p><p>As they take their seats in a semi-circle, Sirius asks, “And what do you…<em>do</em> here, exactly?” The one he questioned looks at him helplessly. Sirius shrugs, “I wasn’t informed…” He manages to catch the disapproving look Remus shoots him, “Or…maybe I wasn’t paying attention.”</p><p>“We read poetry. Sometimes essays. Some are created by us, but most are from dead poets.”</p><p>He suddenly remembers the shrivelled note still tightly grasped in his hand. With a newfound curiosity he unfolds it in great care, failing to see a girl take the stage and the unyielding attention Remus sends her way. His eyes scan the parchment; curiosity is replaced by confusion quicker than James can catch the Snitch.</p><p>                   </p><p> <em>                 </em><strong>[1]</strong><em> brIght</em></p><p>

</p><p>“Remus, what the hell is this?” Sirius questions the boy sitting beside him, unable to take his eyes away from the mess of words on the paper, “Is this even…English?”</p><p>Failing to receive a response he looks up, sees the unmissable adoration in his friend’s eye and turns his attention to the spectacle right in front of him. The air is warm. The lights twinkle lazily in warm yellow. The wind rattles the glass every once in a while as if to remind him that this moment is real life. She stands with an old torn book in her hands, focused and ready to be listened to, ready to speak to them, to <em>him</em>, in a way no girl has ever spoken to him before. He doesn’t know her, and the dull blue colours of her house make him realize why – she is a Ravenclaw, and he hasn’t had the best of luck with girls from her house. Most are too introverted, or just shy. But there is an air of confidence around her, slithering on her wrists and thighs like a spell casting its magic on everything she touches. <em>Passion</em>. Passion is another thing that stands out before she can even open the rosebuds of her lips. A passion for this small gathering he invaded with his, presumably unwanted, presence. It captivates him. It captivates everyone here.</p><p>The girl clears her throat, “<strong>[2]</strong><em>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately</em>,” Her voice rings loud and clear in the silent room, “- <em>to front only the essential facts of life</em>,” Her eyes scan the faces of her listeners, “-<em>and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die</em>,” Her (colour) eyes stop on Sirius, “…<em>discover that I had not lived</em>.” She shuts the book harshly and it jolts everyone awake, “Welcome to the 12<sup>th</sup> <em>Dead Poets Society</em> meeting. Who wants first say?” A lovely smile pulls on the corner of her lips as warmly she regards a girl whose hand shoots up so fast she nearly smacks someone in the face. “The floor is yours, Mary.”</p><p>His fellow housemate takes the stage and this is when Remus answers him, “It’s a poem, Sirius. Even you can figure that out.”</p><p>“If this is a poem, then I am a poet.” He mumbles cynically. Remus grins.</p><p>“Just you wait. We may make one of you yet.”</p><p>Mary is soft spoken and she picked a poem so sweet and tender that Sirius had to fight the urge to roll his eyes into the back of his head. A cliché. This is why he dislikes poetry, this is why he doesn’t understand the cult behind it. Because of cotton candy like words, cringe inducing verses and the whole aura of seriousness surrounding something so <em>simple</em>. On cue, he glances at the paper in his hand. <em>Well</em>, and absolutely mad.</p><p>Polite claps echo. Mary bows with a shy smile and blushed cheeks. She quickly takes her seat and he notices the same girl with the (color) eyes reassuring her. Absentminded he stares at her, tries to pick the details of her face, possibly match her with a name or a rumour he once heard. What surprises him is when a body passes his line of vision, leaving a seat next to him empty.</p><p>Remus Lupin grins at him before glancing down at the book he grasps loosely, but his smile twitches and Sirius, if he wasn’t so surprised, would gladly give him a thumbs up or at the very least a half-assed cheer of encouragement. Remus? The Remus Lupin taking stage? This phenomenon so great not even knucklehead James Potter will believe it. Remus clears his throat. His eyes shoot to the girl with the (colour) eyes before returning to the book, “<strong>[3] </strong><em>She walks in beauty, like the night / Of cloudless climes and starry skies;…”</em></p><p>And it suddenly clicks in him. His eyes grow wide and excitement spurs like a firework. <em>This</em>! This is what it’s for! The dazed smiles, soft spoken words, shy blushes whenever James or he teased him about one girl or another, Peter being oddly secretive about why Remus spends his time in the library from noon to dinner… <em>Her</em>! It’s all for her, <em>it’s all about her</em>! And Sirius is here <em>because</em>…Well, that part he fails to understand, but most likely for moral support. He grins to himself, already imagining spilling everything to James as they conjure a master plan to get these two together. Yes, Sirius vows to get Remus his dream girl by the end of the year…</p><p>A promise, unknown to him at the time, he would inevitably break.</p><p>When Remus sat back down Sirius wanted to pounce on him with questions and jokes and poke fun, but he couldn’t. The circle continued at a steady pace – no one asked Sirius to stand up and read, and he was grateful since he was unsure if he could decipher that scribble in his hand – and lastly it was <em>her</em> turn again.</p><p>“<strong>[4] </strong><em>You tell me /</em> ” A slight mock in her strong voice, eyes like jewels glistening in the light, “<em>I am not like most girls. / And learn to kiss me with your eyes closed /</em> “ Her face is composed but he notices it turn just a bit sour, “<em>Something about the phrase – something about / how I have to be unlike the other women /</em> “ A note of spitefulness, a tensed jaw and a silent promise that this poem – one she had learned and rehearsed – is intended for someone in this audience to hear, “<em>I call sisters / makes me want to spit your tongue out /</em> “ She hisses, “<em>like I am supposed to be proud you picked me / as if I should be relieved you think / I am better than them</em>.”</p><p>There is a pause before cheers erupt. The kind of silence one finds in the eye of the storm.</p><p>And in that moment, in that silence that lays heavy on his shoulders, Sirius realizes just why Remus likes her so much.</p>
