          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Merlin's balls, this is old," James said when he picked up a dusty diary from Six Year.</p><p>Draco sighed.  "I don't understand your sudden need to go through my old things."</p><p>James shrugged.  "You have an attic full of things."</p><p>"Not everything is mine.  This house has been standing for centuries."</p><p>"I know, but this little corner is yours and it's- I don't know.  You always say how my father knows you better than me."</p><p>"No, I said that he knows more about our past," Draco pointed out.</p><p>James smiled. "And this way, I get to know your past too."</p>
<hr/><p>"And what is this?"</p><p>Draco smiled. "My Nimbus 2001.  Father bought them for the entire team. Still not enough to beat your father."</p><p>"Don't know how good it was, but it's ancient. Is this why you don't play anymore? Dad?"</p><p>Draco shrugged.  "Partially.  It became another chore.  I had too many already."</p><p>James looked at the diary he'd been skimming.  "I can tell.  Legilimency, occlumency, dueling, vanishing cabinets.  You were busy."</p><p>Draco turned around and looked out of the tiny attic window. He closed his eyes when he felt arms around him. "Bad memories."</p><p>James kissed him gently. "Old history."</p>
<hr/><p>"Are you finally done?" Draco asked.</p><p>"For now." James wiped his hands on his jeans, but the denim was just as dusty.  "I'm not trying to bring up old history. I just want to get to know all of you, past and present."</p><p>Draco laughed. "You're upset because your father said that he knows me better than you.  He was upset.  Finding out about us was a bit of a shock for his middle class mind."</p><p>"I know, but there's some truth to what he said, and I'm going to fix it." James put his arms around Draco.  "Let's shower."</p>
<hr/><p>James got into the in-ground tub and settled between Draco's legs. Strong arms closed around him as he leaned back.  "This room-</p><p>"If you say old or ancient one more time, I'm drowning you."</p><p>James laughed. "You won't and I was going to say beautiful.  One of my favourite rooms here at the manor."  He turned his head and stared at Draco.  "What's wrong?"</p><p>Draco kissed James' shoulder.  "This little trip down memory lane makes me feel old."</p><p>James turned around and straddled Draco.  His fingers moved over Draco's cock, bringing him to hardness while they kissed. "Not old now."</p></div>
