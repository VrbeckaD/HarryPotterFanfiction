</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Odessa, any news on the whereabouts of your daughter?” Voldemort asked. All eyes were on Valeria’s mother now, save for Draco’s who made sure to continue keeping his gaze down at the mere mention of Valeria.</p><p>“None, my Lord. She has ceased writing to me,” Odessa said in a voice that attempted to mask the pain of saying those words. Draco had been avoiding Odessa since he returned home, but she had managed to corner him a few times and interrogated him with a barrage of questions asked in desperation, as any distraught parent might. Odessa asked him everything; Valeria grades, her well-being, her best subject, mention of her family, and on and on. Draco did his best to give her reassuring answers without revealing much of the truth, according to his mother’s instruction, who claimed that Odessa’s state of mind was far too fragile for anything more. He kept a great deal of secrets from everyone he could regarding Valeria as the Dark Lord could easily penetrate any mind in the room to gather information.</p><p>“My Lord, if I may, I believe it is safe to assume that the Greengrass report is correct and Valeria is likely currently with the Order, whether that be by choice is unclear,” Snape said. Draco did not look up to see Voldemort’s reaction.</p><p>“I’m inclined to agree, Severus,” Voldemort said. “A shame too, a witch of such noble birth in the hands of degenerates. The last of the house of Winters is surely an asset, it does not do to have her be in their possession.” He sounded as though he was musing aloud, but Draco gulped, cringing at the manner of which he spoke of her; an object of advantage. He meant to keep her out of all this and he prayed he would never hear her name come out of their mouths, but those seemed to have fallen on the ears of a deaf God.</p><p>“Draco, this time last year I was told that you care a great deal for Valeria Winters. Tell me, do these feelings remain?” Voldemort asked. He did not to remember last summer and how his aunt probed at his mind during Occlumency training, discovering his adolescent heartache for his friend. It was his own weakness that put her danger when Bellatrix dutifully reported Draco’s feelings to the Dark Lord. It was because of his him that the threat of death did not end with the Malfoy family. Draco’s stomach dropped and his mouth went dry and he could sense his parents’ tension next to him. He wracked his brian for the best answer, knowing that things would be much worse were he to lie. He could feel Odessa’s intense eyes on him out of the corner of his eye, and he could not bear to look at her. Valeria had inherited her mother’s eyes…</p><p>“She has been a good friend to me, sir. I do care for her well-being,” Draco answered.</p><p>“The girl is a traitor!” Bellatrix protested.</p><p>“Calm yourself, Bella,” Voldemort said.</p><p>“We cannot be entirely certain of that. To me it seems she has been kept largely in the dark, in ignorance, towards our cause and has been preyed upon by other influences. From my observations, her loyalties remain undetermined,” Snape said. Draco was grateful for Snape’s calm objection to his aunt’s raving.</p><p>“Then perhaps we should address that, starting with the one that raised her.” Bellatrix quipped, glaring with a sinister grin at Odessa.</p><p>“Silence,” Voldemort commanded. “I agree with Severus. The girl is not completely hopeless, though the threat of others poisoning her mind gives me pause, considering her actions the night of Draco’s failure. Is she a capable young witch, Severus?”</p><p>Snape nodded. “Yes, my Lord. She is gifted at Potions especially and has shown a keen interest in the deeper mysteries and questions of magic, much more so than any of her peers. I respectfully remind that you that she was rather cunning in assisting Draco last year, albeit unknowingly.”</p><p>“Not to mention an impeccable bloodline, which is invaluable in the increase of our numbers.”</p><p>“Most certainly, sir,” Snape agreed.</p><p>“I have had an interesting idea that I would like your opinion on, Draco,” Voldemort said. Draco looked up, clenching his jaw, feeling his palms start to sweat. “I believe we can retrieve the girl and bring her here. We’ll of course need to find out what she knows of the Order’s plans and that of Harry Potter’s, the extraction of which I will place in the hands of you, Bellatrix. Should she prove honest and loyal, I believe it would be advantageous to set a good example for young witches and wizards by returning to the old ways and uniting the houses of Malfoy and Winters in marriage.”</p><p>Draco felt faint. He thought he was in a dream. It could not be real. His heart leapt into his throat, feeling the stares of the entire table, most especially Odessa’s.</p><p>“My Lord, this is a most humbling offer, but they are so young. I am not sure if they are ready for—”</p><p>“Are they both not seventeen years of age, Lucius?” Voldemort said.</p><p>Lucius nodded. “Yes, but they have not even completed their educations. Perhaps a betrothal would be better, for them, until they are done with school.”</p><p>“This would not bar them from completing their educations. In fact, this will strengthen them while being a fine example to their peers,” Voldemort said with contempt to his former right-hand man. Draco knew that was the only defense he would get from his father and he glanced down to see his mother wringing her hands in her lap. “What say you, Odessa.”</p><p>She inhaled sharply before speaking. “If it be your will, my Lord.” Voldemort seemed most pleased with her answer, like the woman had a choice otherwise.</p><p>“And Draco, what is your opinion on the matter?”</p><p>All eyes turned to Draco, but his mind was spinning, heart racing, he could barely breathe. He had not seen this coming. The arranging of marriages amongst pureblood families, particularly young ones, had fallen out of fashion long, long ago. This was what he dreaded. This was the punishment for his failure and her lack of expressed loyalty to the dark cause.</p><p>“It would be an honor, my Lord. Thank you,” Draco managed to reply. The only thing he had to be thankful for was that his answer appeared to please the Dark Lord.</p><p>“It’s settled then. Draco and Valeria will wed. It is my hope that Draco will be a positive influence on her and the joining of your families will continue the proud history of pure bloodlines.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco went straight to his room at the other end of the Manor after the meeting concluded and he recovered, avoiding speaking to the others if he could help it. He loosened his collar and felt the panic rising; the hastened breath, the heart on the edge of explosion, the cold sweat, the urge to run away as far as he could. He locked his door and immediately went to his window and stuck his head outside for fresh air, but instead wretched, unable to erase the sight of the death of Professor Burbage.</p><p>Nearly panting, he cleaned himself up and sat, his body trembling. His eye caught the movement of a photograph on his desk. He was with his friends in the Slytherin common room, beginning of the fifth year. Pansy, Zabini, Daphne, even Crabbe and Goyle all standing smiling or with their arms around each other’s shoulders. He himself was pictured standing alongside Valeria, his arm snaked around her back and his hand resting gently on her waist. Her head ever so slightly leaned towards him as she smiled, on the verge of laughter it seemed. Not a hair out of place, her eyes full of excitement for the coming year. He had not seen it at the time, the flawless innocence that then graced her face. He had seen the photograph hundreds of times since, but saw now how happy he was, proud to have her on his arm, surrounded by friends in his favorite place in the castle.</p><p>The longer he looked, the angrier he became, most of all with himself. He slammed his fist on the table, ignoring the white-hot pain, and cursed loudly. Frustrated, trapped, he began to weep, softly but surely. He eventually made his way to one of the sofas in his room, unable to bear being around the photographs of her any longer, and sat holding his face with his hands, staring down at the floor with futility.</p><p>He did not know how long he had been sitting when he heard a knock at his door. He did his best to wipe any evidence of tears from his face and went to unlock it. His father stood there behind his mother, both with concerned looks, but both maintaining composure. His father sat on the sofa across from him while his mother joined him on the opposite one.</p><p>“We understand that this is quite a shock for you, Draco. It is for us, and Odessa, too,” Lucius began awkwardly. Draco didn’t respond, looking away from both of them. His mother placed a hand on his arm and reach the other one around his shoulders. “There is no way out of it, son. Once Valeria is captured, and it seems she will be, and cooperates with questioning, you will be married to her.”</p><p>A shiver shot down Draco’s spine, he had completely forgotten about the questioning Valeria would endure. Their only hope was that she would manage to avoid being discovered and he had no way to forewarn her.</p><p>“We know this is upsetting, but you must remain—”</p><p>“She hates me,” Draco said.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Narcissa asked.</p><p>Draco recounted his flight from Hogwarts. How she had jinxed Goyle to break out of Slytherin house and witnessed the death of Dumbledore. How she chased him down at the edge of the ground and screamed at him, begging him not to go. Dumbledore’s promise, that she could forgive him, seemed impossible now. He kept to himself the nightmares of her screaming at him, nearly stepping off the edge of the tower, and the torture she endured. His mother rubbed his shoulder gently as he recalled the story to her.</p><p>“That hardly matters now, Draco,” Narcissa said.</p><p>“Of course it matters! How can I marry someone who hates me? How can either of us do this?” He asked.</p><p>“Because you must,” Lucius insisted. “You must keep in mind the responsibility that will become yours once you are married. You must remember the Malfoy legacy.” His father leaned in, desperation in his exhausted face. “This is an opportunity, if you do well, to regain our status, especially if, after you both complete your studies, you should conceive a child—”</p><p>“Lucius!” Narcissa hissed, holding Draco, who nearly vomited again at the thought, tighter. “Not now!”</p><p>“He needs to understand the weight of this responsibility. He needs to know what is expected of him,” Lucius defended. Draco hadn’t even thought of children. While most of his peers weren’t giving a single thought to their romantic futures, there he was saddled with the sudden burden of marriage and eventual fatherhood. He felt nauseous. He should have gathered that it would be expected of them to produce a child eventually. This would kill her, at the very least her soul. There was no doubt in his mind that this would break her completely and forever, and he never felt worse by the second.</p><p>“We will cross that bridge when we get it,” Narcissa said through her teeth. She turned back to Draco, leaning close to him. “Listen to me. Your father is right that a large responsibility has fallen on you. You need to keep in mind that once you are married, she is your family and your first priority. Do you understand?” Draco nodded. “And I expect you to treat her with all the dignity and respect she deserves.” Draco nodded again.</p><p>“Your mother will handle the arrangements when the time arrives. We’ve also assured Odessa that her daughter will be in good hands.”</p><p>Draco gulped. “I will do my best,” he said, not believing his own words. It was all too surreal. He could not fathom it and his heart sank knowing his parents were powerless to stop this. Narcissa nodded and reached into a pocket and opened his hand, placing in a small silver colored ring with deep purple jewels adorning it.</p><p>“Give this to her when the time comes. Odessa will likely be sent away shortly after Valeria arrives, as it’s been decided to keep them separated. She asked that this begin to Valeria as it was her grandmother’s. Keep it somewhere safe until then.”</p><p>His parents eventually left him, Narcissa giving him a reassuring kiss on the head. He sat back and let his head hang back. If things were like they were just a few years ago, and if they were a little older, a marriage with Valeria would have elated both of their families. The union would have made them likely the most influential people in their corner of the wizarding world. He had never thought of marrying her, or anyone, not yet anyway. He had once desperately wanted to take her to Hogsmeade, or on a date, simply pass time with her in the common room, and of course, secretly, the other things that a young man his age desired.</p><p>Marriage, the mere thought of it was so far away, too far to even see. He felt heaviness in his chest knowing that he would have to tell her that she had no option but to marry him and eventually mother their children.</p><p>He was not so naïve as he was even a year ago. He knew this was not altruistic blessing bestowed upon them. A twofold strategic move; demonstrating the way of things under the fast-coming new order and a punishment for them and their families. He prayed one last time, at least it resembled a prayer in his mind, to being that would listen; That she stay hidden and far away. That was their only hope.</p>
