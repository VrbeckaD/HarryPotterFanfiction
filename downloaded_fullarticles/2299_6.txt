    <p>Hedwig hooted pitifully. Harry barely managed to scramble out of his seat and catch the wounded owl as she fell more than flew to her master. Harry's eyes flashed with rage as he slowly turned to look at Umbridge's smug face. Luna calmly approached from the Ravenclaw table and gently took Hedwig before starting to work on healing her. Harry paid attention only long enough to ensure that his owl would be alright in the hands of his friend before turning towards the teachers' table. A mask of rage and thunderous fury had his face snarling as he spat the summoning charm.</p>
<p>"<i>Accio Umbitch's Ankles</i>!" Harry snarled, intentionally dragging her by her ankles under the table and aiming for her to land roughly on the floor a few feet away. Her wand had been left behind on the table when she had been summoned away from her meal in the Headmaster's seat. Dead silence broken only by the furious screeches of his victim echoed around the room.</p>
<p>"How dare!" Umbridge began only to get silenced and bound by the spells sent by a pair of redheaded demons who had swiftly moved to stand with Harry.</p>
<p>"I'm going to introduce you to a few things that my relatives use on me," Harry told her with a calm that spoke of absolute fury. The Weasley twins exchanged worried looks, tipping Snape off to the fact that what was coming might not be something that could be classed as a harmless childhood punishment.</p>
<p>"Uh, Harry? You think we should send away anyone under fourth year first?" George asked quickly.</p>
<p>"And anyone who doesn't want to see you draw blood on the toad?" Fred added even more quickly. Both of them knew there was no way to actually <i>stop</i> Harry short of knocking him senseless now that he had finally reached his limit.</p>
<p>"Send away anyone who doesn't want to see Death Eater level torture," Harry ordered, his voice deadly calm as his cold eyes never left the form of his prey. Umbridge was slowly catching on to the fact that Harry was deadly serious about the matter.</p>
<p>"Potter," Severus warned, his voice threatening but with enough concern buried within the word to make Harry look up and meet the man's gaze. Severus swallowed hard. He didn't even have to go looking in the mind hidden by those emerald eyes to know that the threat of torture was more of a promise than anything else.</p>
<p>"She attacked my familiar," Harry said calmly. He may not know the laws surrounding familiars but he knew that they were valued among wizards and that the bitch had pushed too far.</p>
<p>"Minerva, get everyone out of here but don't try with Potter or Umbridge," Severus ordered after he swallowed dryly, his onyx gaze never dropping the link to the emerald orbs. Everyone moved towards the exit, avoiding passing between or near the two wizards and bound pink clad witch.</p>
<p>"I want to see what useless things Potty's relatives use on him," Draco Malfoy said evilly, smirking as if he had won something and oblivious to the threat hanging in the air.</p>
<p>"You will return to your common room, Mr. Malfoy, or face the loss of 50 points and a week of detentions," McGonagall shot back.</p>
<p>"Let him stay. Let anyone who wants to watch stay," Harry countered, gaze never leaving Severus' stare down.</p>
<p>"I can't let you kill her," Severus warned carefully. "Even if the law says you can retaliate for the attack."</p>
<p>"At this point professor I'm more interested in taking the payment for wrongs done out of her <i>hide</i> and asking Voldy if his offer from first year is still open. I'm not sure she's worth using as my first human kill beyond Quirrellmort. Self defense might have been a large part of fighting him off in first year but I didn't have to jump on him after he backed up when we both saw my skin burning him. Then again he was still actively trying to kill me even with the bad magical burns," Harry said flatly. His eyes were slowly going dead even as gasps arose from his fellow students at his words. People started to leave even more quickly than before.</p>
<p>"Perhaps another arrangement can be made? If only to avoid the mess she will make and the stains that the stones will acquire?" Severus offered carefully. He would address the Quirrellmort comment later and if possible get the brat's version of his so called yearly adventures directly from him and his memories. Severus was very clearly missing vital details.</p>
<p>"Does he condone hurting children?" Harry asked shortly. An idle curse silently left his wand to hit Umbridge with the loud crack of breaking bone. The sound had Draco Malfoy going pasty white as his smirk slowly slipped off his face with the dawning realization that his school yard rival hadn't been kidding. The next bone breaking hex landed on the other leg swiftly followed by some sort of crushing curse used on the woman's hands. By now it was clear to everyone who remained that if the twins hadn't silenced Umbridge her screams and shouts would be echoing down the corridors of the castle.</p>
<p>"No, your case is unique because of something Dumbledore insists on keeping from you and everyone else that I can not speak of... yet, due to a vow. I am more than willing to act as your go-between in this matter if you so desire," Severus informed him almost gently. He didn't like the woman but Harry was one of the people he especially tried to protect. He knew he would have to get a great many facts from the green-eyed imp before everything was said and done but for the moment keeping him from committing murder in front of the entire school was at the top of the list.</p>
<p>"Would you mind delivering her as an act of good faith? Or a peace offering if he will accept her as such? I'd offer my relatives but they aren't currently to hand," Harry said casually. He had switched to very carefully shredding the pink cardigan while not harming Umbridge beyond a few bloody nicks from the cutting spell warning her of how much <i>damage</i> he could do to her flesh. "If she happens to be one of his she's on my to-kill list next to Pettigrew but my renewed interest in his original offer stands... depending on his actual aims and plans."</p>
<p>"I shall see that he gets the message," Severus said, gracefully moving and silently stunning the bitch as eye contact was finally broken by unspoken mutual agreement. A few medical charms were used to prevent further damage during transport but nothing was done to lower the amount of pain she was experiencing.</p>
<p>"I'll start opening the defense club into a school wide weekend defense session then shall I?" Harry offered calmly.</p>
<p>"It would be much appreciated," Severus agreed, taking charge of the unconscious witch. "Should I arrange for helpers among the staff or are you wanting to keep it strictly students only?"</p>
<p>"You and anyone else you deem competent when it comes to defense and combat are welcome Master Snape," Harry said formally.</p>
<p>"Then expect myself, Flitwick, and McGonagall at your next meeting," Severus told Harry before sweeping out of the room and heading for the edge of the wards with the openly injured Umbridge floating along behind him. He had a message and goodwill present to deliver after all.</p>
<p>Harry calmly walked past the wary and suspicious student body, his rage still burning bright and high sending his magic into seething turmoil. They shied away from him as he approached a calm Luna holding an openly concerned Hedwig who was mostly healed by now.</p>
<p>"Keep her with you for a few days. She needs to be sure that her sacrifice and warning protected you. Did you know she sees you as not just her wizard but as her chick?" Luna instructed dreamily.</p>
<p>Harry very gently took Hedwig from Luna's arms and cuddled her close while being mindful of the mostly healed injuries.</p>
<p>"She was my very first friend ever and my first birthday present," Harry told the blond absently as his petting of a cooing Hedwig slowly calmed him. He wasn't even aware that he was speaking out loud and had eyes only for his familiar. "I had a hard time feeding her during the summers. The Dursleys only gave me a can of soup each day, if that, but she wouldn't ever let me give her all the food. She would smack me with her wing if she could until I ate at least half of the food. Sometimes, if I wasn't healing from something, I would try to give her some of my magic to try and make it better. She usually scolded me for it, because I'd often wind up hurt for longer or getting a bit sick afterwards. I doesn't happen when I do it here at Hogwarts but she does fuss a lot after."</p>
<p>The magic of the school had frozen almost everyone and locked them in place to silently witness Harry's confession to Hedwig more than to anyone else. It was clear to the staff that the school was furious over Harry's mistreatment and was demanding that something be done about it.</p>
<p>"Why would she fuss so? Was she chasing away wrackspurts? Or pennypounds? Or did she just know you were leaking too much red juice?" Luna asked in airy curiosity. Harry was too out of it to pick up on the dark undertone that made her seem like a vengeful Fae gathering information or attempting to trick those they spoke with.</p>
<p>"Hmm? Oh probably the red juice I suppose. Blood can be a bit difficult to clean up when you are still bleeding and it smells <i>terrible</i> when there is that yellow and white stuff in it that makes the injury hot and tender. My Aunt always made me throw out anything that it got on with the yellow and white stuff mixed in or she made me wash it in water that was still bubbling from the heat with a bar of soap that always burned my fingers when I touched it. It always made my skin red and hurt for hours after doing that wash," Harry said absently, still unaware that he was speaking aloud.</p>
<p>The horror of the surrounding staff and students being released from the magical freeze lock brought Harry back to reality. Harry sighed deeply, refusing to look at anyone but still gave Luna a nod of thank you before wandering off.</p>
<p>"Minerva, I don't bloody care if Albus demands Mr. Potter returns to those creatures. I'll adopt him myself if need be," Pomona Sprout said firmly once Harry was gone.</p>
<p>"I honestly feel the same but I haven't found a legal recourse or something that would protect him better than the blasted blood wards Albus claims are at his Aunt's place," McGonagall explained wearily. "I feel the same. I'd adopt him in a heart beat but Dumbledore sent Black to Azkaban specifically to keep Potter at his Aunt's. He knew the man was innocent as he was the one to cast the Fidilus charms for the Potters. Severus was magically bound by Albus to be especially nasty to him and the old fool thinks he's stolen or sealed all my memories of these things! I can't even report it properly with some of the release restrictions!"</p>
<p>"Then why can you speak of it now?" Pomona asked with a frown.</p>
<p>"Because I'm talking to a fellow staff member about his safety and the reasons why you can't simply adopt the lad. I am perfectly well convinced that anything but the full truth would only make you more determined to thwart Albus and adopt him any way. It's not my fault if I don't see anyone listening to us. I cast the privacy charm after all. I can only guess I'm overly tired from having to counter that <i>pink <u>bitch</u></i> on matters of student safety," Minerva shrugged carelessly, pointedly ignoring everyone but her fellow teacher.</p>
<p>It was clear to everyone that they needed to rethink what they knew about one Harry Potter. Classes were canceled with the stern warning to leave Harry alone and not touch his owl. Rumor had it that the teachers hadn't interfered because it was connected to some familiar based law that Snape had mentioned before he left with Umbridge. The other rumors centered around <i>Snape</i> keeping the teachers from stopping Harry. The news that McGonagall let slip in the middle of the crowded hall also made the rounds. The obviously open revolt against Dumbledore and the Professor's reasons for it had the students discussing it furiously with the purebloods actually teaching both half bloods and muggleborns why certain things must have happened and what laws were being used. To say that there was open dissatisfaction bordering on fury on behalf of Harry was an understatement.</p>
<p>Had Dumbledore returned that night the building storm of magic and emotion within the castle would have shocked him.</p>
