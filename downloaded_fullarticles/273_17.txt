          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dumbledore sat at the table, tapping is fingers on the wood angrily. He was <em>not</em> going to lose the war to a mere <em>boy.</em></p>
<p>     Suddenly, an owl flew in and a parchment landed right in front of him. He opened it up and found a letter from McGonagall.</p>
<p>   <em>  Dark Lord,</em></p>
<p>
  <em>   Harry Potter has returned to Hogwarts. Now is a good time to strike, my lord.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>     -Minerva</em>
</p>
<p>     Dumbledore smiled. How nice.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>     Dumbledore watched the battle go on before him, smiling when he realized he was most certainly going to win.</p>
<p>     He sent out a message to bring Harry Potter to him in the forbidden forest, knowing that someone would bring the boy, unless everyone wanted to die.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>     "Professor, where are we-" Harry Potter was cut off when he spotted Albus Dumbledore, the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>     "McGonagall, what-" Harry was too stunned to say more as Minerva pushed him down to the ground. </p>
<p>     Harry watched with wide eyes as Minerva went to Dumbledore's side.</p>
<p>     "Good job, Minerva. You always have been the best of the death eaters." Albus spoke, putting a hand on Minerva's shoulder.</p>
<p>     "Only for you, my lord." Minerva smiled and leaned into Dumbledore's touch.</p>
<p>     "Now for the boy." Albus turned and drew his wand. Harry was still. "Glad to see you've given up."</p>
<p>     "Avada Kadavra!" </p>
<p>     Harry Potter's body fell to the ground. Narcissa walked up to the boy and keeled down, checking for signs of life. After a small hesitation, she spoke.</p>
<p>     "Dead."</p>
<p>     "Congratulations, my lord." Minerva spoke.</p>
<p>     Dumbledore smiled at his most loyal servant. He grabbed her head and gave a quick kiss to her forehead.</p>
<p>     "Let's finish them off, shall we?"</p>
<p>     "Of course, my lord" Minerva smiled with a soft blush.</p>
<p>     The two then lead the pack of death eaters back to Hogwarts hand in hand.</p></div>
