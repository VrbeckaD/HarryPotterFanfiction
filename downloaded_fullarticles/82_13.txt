    <p>The date was September first and Albus Potter was standing on Platform 9 ¾ about to go off to his fifth term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. On an ordinary year this day was plagued by misery, anxiety, and homesickness. But this year was anything from ordinary. See, the previous term Albus and his best mate Scorpius Malfoy had gotten into a little spot of trouble involving time travel, alternate realities, and the rebirth of the dark lord. You know, average teenage shenanigans. That whole experience had taught Albus many things but mainly he learned to be grateful for what he had and make the most of his life. After spending the summer repairing his relationship with this father, Albus was ready to give Hogwarts another go. Still he was as terrified as he had been four years prior when he came to Platform 9 ¾ for the very first time, his little 11 year old body buzzing with adrenaline and sleep deprivation. Albus imagined he was a first year again, so young so naive, so unaware of the terrors his future held.</p>
<p>He picked his head up and scanned his surroundings. The scene reminded Albus of a carnival. Children old and young ran in every direction saying goodbye to their families and hello to their friends. Parents stood on the outskirts looking bored or tired. The steam from the Hogwarts Express created a thick white blanket over the entire platform, engulfing them all in a confusing fog. In front of him he spotted a young boy of about nine running with glee to his parents, a burly, rather tall man and a frail, short woman. Their eyes lit up when they saw the child approach. On their right was a slightly older boy of about eleven clutching his trunk so tightly his knuckles were white. Despite the cool September weather he was sweating profusely, his thick, black hair stuck to his forehead. He was most likely a first year suffering from a very severe case of freshman nerves. Albus considered going over there and assuring him everything would be fine but his own nerves prevented him. Was it weird to go up to him out of the blue? What would he say? How would he answer the kid's surly endless stream of questions? No, best to leave the troubled kids to a prefect or someone who wasn't just a ball of anxiety in a sweater vest.</p>
<p>Albus felt a hand on his shoulder and spun around. There grinning up at him was his father, Harry Potter. At first glance, Harry seemed like your average, greying, middle-aged man. He was slender, pale, and owned only two t-shirts. But on closer examination, you could see the faint outline of a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. It was this very scar that caused all wizards to gawk when they saw him and shower him in gifts with homemade cards attached. Because Harry James Potter had seen his own share of troubles. Albus had heard the stories of his father's heroic exploits countless times usually from an overenthusiastic, slightly tipsy Ron Weasley. </p>
<p>"I just want you to know," Harry said, his tone calm "that no matter what happens this year I still care about you." </p>
<p>  "What could possibly be worse than last year?" Albus asked.</p>
<p>Harry cringed "Don't jinx it." They stood in silence for a moment observing the scene of chaos unfolding in front of their very eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh wait!" Harry said suddenly. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver coin engraved with the letters D.A. <br/>"This is the coin I used back when I was a fifth year. All of the Dumbledore's Army members had one and it was how we kept in contact about meetings while under Umbridge's rule." Harry scowled as he said the name of his old headmistress. Albus had never been told exactly what Umbridge did to him but he knew it had something to do with the scar on the back of his hand.</p>
<p>"If the one with the master coin needed to send a message the rest of our coins would get warm. You can even change the date in case you get lost in time again. I know you promised you'd be careful and I believe you but I also know I never went looking for trouble either, it always found me. I know it's not much and I know it seems controlling but... just... here." He held out the coin. Albus took it and slipped it into his pocket, touched for the first time by a gift his father had given him.</p>
<p>"Hey, it's better than that old blanket." Albus said</p>
<p>Harry laughed "If I recall correctly that 'old blanket' saved the world."</p>
<p>They stood there in awkward silence until the Hogwarts Express blew its whistle.</p>
<p>"Five minutes," Harry announced. "You better get going or you'll miss the train and trust me that is not fun."<br/>Albus could tell you word for word what had happened when his father missed the train in his second year, tipsy Uncle Ron was very fond of that story probably because he played such a big part in it.</p>
<p>"I'll see you in the winter," Harry said. "And Al I love..."<br/>His words were cut short by Albus pulling his father into a bone-crushing hug. Harry wrapped his arms around his son, not wanting to let go, to see his son disappear so soon after they had just begun to make amends. He knew first hand that anything could happen at Hogwarts and he feared that the high stakes, stressful environment of fifth year would cause a rift to reopen in their newly healed relationship.</p>
<p>"I love you too dad," said Albus as he pulled away. He went to say goodbye to his mother and then help his little sister, Lily, carry her trunk. This was her very first year at Hogwarts and even though she kept denying it, Albus could tell she was uneasy. He was hoping to guide her and help her adjust the way he wished someone had done for him.</p>
<p>"Who will I sit with on the train?" She asked more to herself than to her brother. "Those people will probably end up being my best friends for life!" He could also tell she'd been speaking to Rose.</p>
<p>"Well you know..." Albus started attempting to share with her the story of how he and Scorpius first met.</p>
<p>"Or what if I'm put into Slytherin like you?" She cut him off "What will I do with myself?"</p>
<p>"Gee thanks." Said Albus sarcastically. He tried not to let himself get overly agitated though. He had also been terrified of being sorted into Slytherin on his first day. The only difference was, Lily had as much a chance of being sorted into Slytherin as he did of getting a date. In other words, there was no way in Hell Lily Luna Potter would end up in any house but Gryffindor.</p>
<p>While they made slow progress across the platform, Albus having to practically push his already homesick sister forward, they spotted their cousin, Rose, also walking towards the train a little ways away, her argent prefect badge gleaming proudly on her chest. Lily grabbed her trunk from Albus, forgetting all about how heavy she complained it was, and ran to join her favorite family member.</p>
<p>"So much for helping her adjust." Albus muttered as he watched Rose and Lily chat up a storm, he was too far away to hear what they were saying but he imagined they were discussing how best to avoid bad grades, trouble, and potential sons of the dark lord.<br/>Albus started his trek to the Hogwarts Express alone, hoping Scorpius would meet him in their usual compartment.</p>
<p>Then out of nowhere, Albus felt two hands cover his eyes and his whole world went black.</p>
