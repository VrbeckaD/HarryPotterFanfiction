    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Bellatrix Lestrange dropped to her knees in an execrable defeat, her ghosted wails painted on the air thick and mordant; her despair at his downfall suffocating and pitiful.</p>
<p>But other than that, no-one moved, no noise was sounded, or attempt made to rectify the fact; Lord Voldemort had fallen through the veil. Lord Voldemort was gone.</p>
<p>"My God," Fudge exclaimed, his jaw open despite the hordes of Death Eaters frozen in front of him; he didn't move. Reporters stood with their cameras lopsided and their hats skewed on their heads, their eyes dish plates. Quills floated above their notepads in the air and portrayed a humane emotion of shock and confusion, their feathers turning amongst themselves for someone to say something, something for them to record. The green light reflected off the shined walls of the Ministry room had dulled, and a boorish grey had taken its place, and in turn their faces to appear ashen and gaunt. Even Bellatrix's sobbing had ceased, pathetic sniffs of submission escaping her wettened face as she heaved into her cloak, the luscious brocaded fabric turned matted and grey with the salt from her tears.</p>
<p>"Harry," a voice whispered from behind him, but he didn't move. He only felt her hand slide into his, and a hand placed on the opposite shoulder as three teenagers stood in stunned silence, the implications of the events weighing on them impossibly and the reality sinking in like a branding mark. Like a scar.</p>
<p>Hermione's quiet tears trickled down her face, blank as it was, and her mahogany eyes blinked rapidly. Ron was less subtle, as usual, his mouth twitching and gaping like a fish gasping for air. His freckles mixed into his skin - unusually pale, with only a hint of red - giving the appearance of an embalmed corpse.</p>
<p>Harry was vaguely aware of a trickle of blood escaping down his chin, and the crack that ran across the smeared lenses of his glasses, but he didn't care.</p>
<p>It was finally over. Voldemort was gone. They'd won.</p>
<p>"Harry," Hermione repeated, her voice scarily level, but high and lofty. She sounded more like Luna than Hermione, but with Luna unconscious in the corner and Neville doting next to her, perhaps unaware of the current situation, he was certain that it was Hermione. Although, even he was nearly fooled.</p>
<p>"He's gone," she observed, and Harry looked around, following her gaze. Death Eaters were regaining their senses and apparating away, with stunned and clumsy Ministry men lumbering after them with their legs stiff and their faces slack. The Minister, useless as he was, stood still in the same place, ignoring the influx of questions spat at him from all angles by hungry and antic reporters.</p>
<p>Some were making their way towards Harry, held back only by the outstretched arms of Sirius Black, his face beaded with sweat and hair tangled with stress.</p>
<p>No-one was smiling, though. There was no big hurray, like Harry had always thought. However, he wasn't even sure that was the truth. The war was over, in essence, but far were they free of the battles that were to come. But Harry... Harry was free. His scar throbbed in memory, nostalgia almost, but he took solace and plenty of joy in knowing that it would never wake him again, never blind him in agony.</p>
<p>"Oh Harry!" Hermione sobbed, her arms wrapping around his shoulders as she buried her face in the crook of his neck, tears streaming down his collarbone and spreading like branches across his ripped and bloodied shirt. Her hair covered his eyes as it bushed out, but he could scarcely care.</p>
<p>Harry let a smile grow on his face as he felt Ron's arm awkwardly brush past Harry, making its way to Hermione's shoulder. Some things never changed.</p>
<p>"Hey Potter!" Ginny yelled excitedly, her voice mimicking every time she had beaten him in the summer quidditch sessions at the Burrow. The happy memory made him jolt, and he felt the tears roll down his face as he grappled his friends into his arms - not quite reaching though - and laughed with them, as children.</p>
<p>Harry didn't think he'd ever truly been a child before.</p>
<p>"Minister!" A gruff voice called from the veil, catching the attention of many reporters and many Order members, who rushed over to the outburst in a flurry.</p>
<p>"What the? -"</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his brow and let his friend’s arms drop from him as he made his way warily over to the crowd of people, held back by the looming figure of Albus Dumbledore, his face contorted into stern finality.</p>
<p>"It's a kid," Someone said, immediately followed by a wave of whispers and chips amongst the onlookers.</p>
<p>"Get back!" The deep and commanding of voice of Dumbledore sounded, the waves of sound rebounding off the walls and knocking them green again, pushing the reporters back as they scurried away in craven defeat.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Harry also moved back, the familiar sound of a raised voice causing childlike, lachrymose fear to resurface abruptly.</p>
<p>A swan of men in dark capes, eerily like that of the enemy, spun in, surrounding Dumbledore until only the tip of his effulgent cap was visible.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head slightly, swallowing his nerves and pushing them down, Gryffindor courage taking over.</p>
<p>“Hey!” He yelled, which may not have been the most articulate of sentences, but it certainly got some attention.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin turned away from the crowd, away from Dumbledore, and walked over to Harry with a calm distress present on his scarred face.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Harry demanded, vaguely aware of his friends regrouped at his sides.</p>
<p>Remus sighed, his eyes large and full of something, something that Harry couldn’t decipher; was it pity? Or fear?</p>
<p>He fiddled with the hem of his robes, ragged as they were, in a nervous state that Harry hadn’t seen him in since the night they found Sirius.</p>
<p>“Harry, it’s not my place to say,” Remus said, his hands finding his hair as he fiddled with it, his face partially covered by the mass of fabric that was his sleeve, “Dumbledore and the Ministry are conferring, I’m sure once they reach a decision you’ll be notified.”</p>
<p>“That’s stupid,” Neville huffed, a rather large outburst for him – and Harry appreciated it, although it hadn’t seemed to have made a dent in Lupin’s cloak.</p>
<p>“You kids have been through a lot today, best get home.”</p>
<p>Harry watched as Lupin brought his wand out and took off his shoe. He watched as he muttered incantations beneath his breath and listened as they melded with the hushed silences of the other wizards.</p>
<p>“Portkey,” Lupin smiled, “it will take you to Grimmauld Place. Sirius and I will join you shortly.”</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath as he prepared to argue, but that breath fizzled out and died as Hermione placed her hand gently on his shoulder, warding off any fulsome ideas that were afoot in his mind.</p>
<p>Harry, with a new scowl upon his face, reached out and snatched the lace of the boot.</p>
<p>He held it in front of his eyes, expectantly, and watched with disinterest as the focus shifted from the lace, to the men, to the lace, to the men. The lace, the men…</p>
<p>And then Ron held it, then Hermione, and Neville, Luna and Ginny. Harry hooded his eyes, turning back to his friends as a hurricane of white enveloped his vision, and they were lifted off the ground – away from the action, and back to Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>“After everything we’ve done, they can’t just shut us out like that,” Harry bellowed, kicking a chair as his friends watched in dismay.</p>
<p>“Harry -, “</p>
<p>“No, Hermione!” Harry breathed, his chest rising and falling with the tick of the clock.</p>
<p>“We beat Voldemort, and they won’t tell us about the new threat.”</p>
<p>Harry pulled up the chair, the splinters lodging themselves in his hand as he grappled with it, finally seating himself with his head in his hands and betrayal on his mind.</p>
<p>“They were trying to keep us safe, Harry,” Luna tried, her soft voice a kind alternative to the voices shouting bloody murder in Harry’s mind.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes against his palm.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Secrets, The Philosophers Stone, The Forbidden Forest, The Triwizard Tournament, even Umbridge.</p>
<p>When have they ever tried to keep him safe? In fact, it was Dumbledore himself who abandoned him to the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“That makes it a first,” Harry muttered, welcoming the headache as a sign that he was still alive. Although the tingle that passed through his scar, along the branches of the lightning bolt, caused him to shiver in remembrance, and instinctively clench his fists.</p>
<p>But Voldemort was gone.</p>
<p>Wasn’t he?</p>
<p>“Harry don’t say that,” Hermione scolded, “Dumbledore has always strived to protect you, even if the situations weren’t… the best. You have to trust his judgement, or it will drive you crazy.”</p>
<p>“No one knows what Dumbledore’s thinking, that’s like his trademark,” Ginny smirked, pulling up a chair and sitting down next to Harry, “don’t beat yourself up about it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, mate, you just beat frickin’ Voldemort!” Ron roared, puffing out his chest as he did so, which caused them all to laugh hysterically at him. Even Harry, whose mind was filled with the darkest thoughts, joined in, the breaths of joy a sweet distraction from everything else.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>Tom Riddle couldn’t see past the blinding white of St Mungo’s Hospital walls. The hastily applied screen around his bed didn’t help, and the outlines of figures arguing from behind it put such a damper on the situation, since he couldn’t see them. And he hated not knowing.</p>
<p>Tom blinked, once; twice, then raised his hand to his head, pushing curls up away from his eyes to try to see more. Alas, nothing. All that it did was cause his head to burn from the coldness of his fingers.</p>
<p>He shifted in his sheets, slightly, and was careful to make naught but a sound as he sat up in his bed, stretching his legs and working his stiffened ankles.</p>
<p>He yawned, rather rudely – although no one could see him, but reminded himself that quietness was key. He didn’t know these people.</p>
<p>He reached under the sheets, fumbling at his trouser leg for his wand, for some semblance of protection. Just in case.</p>
<p>It wasn’t there. Typical.</p>
<p>He turned his torso slightly, trying to spy something of use from behind those godforsaken blinds.</p>
<p>Again, nothing. He had to assume that they had been placed meticulously for this very reason, and that they had found out about everything.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why wouldn’t they trust him?</p>
<p>And why would he be in St Mungo’s, if not for falling to the hand of a much more experienced wizard?</p>
<p>Or perhaps, he hit his head on the way down to the chamber. That would explain the splitting headache, and why they had seemingly intended to hide him away. They must have known. It would also explain the copious amounts of dust on his robes, which were flying off in small particles as they padded around the airspace.</p>
<p>Tom shifted himself and waited for silence, listening intently to the conversation happening outside the curtains.</p>
<p>“He’s just a boy!”</p>
<p>“A boy that grows up to kill!”</p>
<p>“Obliviate him?” One suggested, and Tom felt himself stiffen even more. He had no means of protection, no means to stop them. He felt helpless.</p>
<p>“It seems that young Mr. Riddle does not have any memories to begin with,” someone said, and Tom recognized the voice.</p>
<p>It was soft, yet jocular, and it carried on.</p>
<p>“It seems, that according to his mind, he still believes himself 16. He still believes it to be 1943. If he was Lord Voldemort, I doubt any of us would still be standing.”</p>
<p>‘Still believes’? Tom’s head spun as he tried to factorize the implications of that phrase. Was it not 1943? And had he somehow aged himself?</p>
<p>He felt along the jaw of his face, and found no imperfections, per usual. In all senses, Tom seemed to be 16. Utterly, and humanly, a child.</p>
<p>Another question spun into his mind, along with gritted teeth and a determined spunk. If it wasn’t 1943, where was he?</p>
<p>“Anyhow, gentlemen, it seems that young Mister Riddle will not awaken for quite a while. Get yourselves some rest; I shall watch over him,” the voice said again, and was met with the grumblings of middle-aged men as they considered a nice meal and a healthy sleep.</p>
<p>As they door closed, Tom let his breath go slightly, but not fully. There was still one silhouette after all, standing – watching him, through the curtain.</p>
<p>“I must say, Tom, it has been a while,” the man spoke, and pulled back the curtains.</p>
<p>‘Dumbledore?’ Tom thought in disbelief, letting his wonder get the best of him. It seemed that it was his teacher, yet, much, much older. His beard had reached down to his torso and coloured itself white, the hair matching its length but starting further up, and ending shorter. He wore purple robes that painted all the stars of astronomy on them, glistening against the purest white of the hospital walls. His eyes twinkled with the same glinted cheek, and his wrinkled face was spread into a small smile.</p>
<p>Tom regained himself, pulling his posture upwards and neutralizing his face.</p>
<p>“Has it,” he observed, not fully able to hide the shake in his voice, “I seem to remember seeing you only yesterday.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore laughed jovially.</p>
<p>“As do I, Tom. Time is a fickle thing,” - trust Dumbledore to speak unabashed- “and I do not think that that goes unnoticed by you. How much did you hear of our… delightful conversation?”</p>
<p>Tom pursed his lips, and looked towards the spectacled eyes of Dumbledore, his eyebrows bushier but his eyes the same.</p>
<p>“Not as much as I would have liked,” Tom admitted – there was never any point in telling white lies to Dumbledore. Big lies, yes, but lies so minute that they meant nothing were best kept away from his prying eyes.</p>
<p>Dumbledore twinkled back at him. “It seems me and these Ministry Men have come at a crossroads, Tom, and I was hoping you could help.”</p>
<p>A trap, obviously. Dumbledore was the most unsubtle mystery man he had ever known, and he still often found himself spun in cobwebs trying to figure the meanings behind his words.</p>
<p>“I would be delighted to, Professor,” Tom smiled boyishly. He was a prefect, after all, and had an image to maintain – no matter how outdated that image may be.</p>
<p>“Very good. I see time has not made you any less careful with your words,” Dumbledore smiled knowingly, and the irony behind his statement did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Well, Tom, it seems we have come to a disagreement regarding you. We simply have differing views on what to do with you.”</p>
<p>Tom nodded along, his mind racing as he felt around for something besides him, anything, that could be used as a weapon.</p>
<p>“I will not lie to you, my boy,” Dumbledore sighed. True pity lined his wrinkles.</p>
<p>“You grow up to be a pernicious, noxious and nefarious wizard, and grow up to cause pain and suffering to everyone who comes into contact with you.”</p>
<p>Tom was taken aback. Shock was surly present on his face in some form, but much of his features remained as neutral as before. He wasn’t the most moral person, granted, but evil?</p>
<p>“How?” Was all he could say, all he could say to keep his cover from being unraveled.</p>
<p>“Horcruxes, Tom. Evil things, and things you should never have gotten involved with,” Dumbledore said gravely, his once lighthearted features stern and hard.</p>
<p>Tom was suddenly reminded of the orphanage, and of every disapproving adult he had ever had the misfortune of meeting. It caused a much more obvious look of pain and balefulness, which did not go unnoticed by Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, however, you now have the chance to change,” Dumbledore said, “and I was just suggesting to the Ministry Men how beneficial it would be for you to reform at Hogwarts, rather than in a cell at Azkaban.”</p>
<p>Tom blinked at the old man.</p>
<p>“I would much prefer Hogwarts,” he said, and Dumbledore smiled.</p>
<p>“I knew you would,” he chortled, “Of course, arrangements must be made. We would need to find a family willing to take you in, and then there’s the matter of settling you in amongst the students – many of them having had suffered from your hand, mind you – and we would most definitely have to move you away from the Slytherin common rooms. Too much corruption to happen there, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“If anyone can do it, you can Professor,” Tom connived; compliments always masked deceit. Regardless of the state of shock he was in, he could still twist Dumbledore to his means. He was a snake, after all.</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s eyes glittered. Perhaps he knew, but Tom didn’t care. He did not want to go to Azkaban.</p>
<p>“Right you are, Tom. Right you are.”</p>
