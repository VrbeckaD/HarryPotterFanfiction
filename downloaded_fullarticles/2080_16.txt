    <p>Draco watched her from the edge of the Great Hall. She pushed her food around on her plate again, not eating more than two bites of anything her fork touched. The specky git sat next to her and every now and then, he’d would look up at Draco. Potter’s green eyes would narrow and glare until Granger noticed and elbowed him to stop. Draco smirked and a warmth spread through him at the thought that she tried to keep Potty from bothering him. The red Weasel noticed none of this while shoveled food into his gob, spraying flecks around the table while he gibbered on about nonsense.</p>
<p>Draco popped off the wall by the door and with a final look towards the Gryffindor table, left the Great Hall without eating. He strode along the corridors, evading everyone. By now, he knew all the alcoves and closets he could duck into. The library would be open for another couple of hours, perhaps he’d get lucky and find something to help him. To help save him and his parents.</p>
<p>He scowled at the thought. Of course, his father would never admit he needed saving, but the Dark Lord had made the price of failure clear. Azkaban wouldn’t keep Lucious safe from the Dark Lord’s wrath.</p>
<p>Sighing and shaking his head, Draco browsed the shelves pulling Advanced Arithmancy for Magical Repairs and Runes for Household Maintenance. He didn’t think either would help, but they may point him in a direction he hadn’t thought of going.</p>
<p>“Honestly, Harry. You need to stop this. He’s just a boy.”</p>
<p>Draco stopped in his tracks. Granger was near, talking to Scarhead. He pressed against the bookcase, straining to hear more.</p>
<p>“He’s never been just a boy. He’s Malfoy. And I’m telling you, he’s up to something. He’s doing something for Voldemort.”</p>
<p>Draco shuddered at the realization they were speaking of him and at the casual invocation of the Dark Lord’s name. No one called him that, not at the Manor.</p>
<p>“Have you seen him? Even if he is doing something, it’s not something he wants to be doing. He looks dreadful,” Granger said. </p>
<p>Draco frowned. Did he, really? He barely ate or slept, but he thought he’d been hiding it okay.</p>
<p>“He’s probably just excited to be a Death Eater,” Potter argued. “The Mark was probably his favorite birthday present.”</p>
<p>Sneering, Draco stalked around the corner. “You know nothing, Scarhead.” Granger was looking at him, biting the inside of her lip from the looks of it. “Granger.” He nodded to her before leaving with his books, but not before throwing his shoulder into the nuisance.</p>
<p>He heard a low “ow” and grinned. At the giant double doors, Potter called out. </p>
<p>“I’m watching, Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Draco lifted one shoulder in a shrug without turning around and headed back to his room. He had some reading to do.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Days passed and it was almost time for Christmas holidays. Every day was the same for Draco and consisted of classes, obligatory trips to the Great Hall to pretend to eat, fruitless trips to the library and frustrating visits to the Room of Hidden Things. Why did he ever say he could fix the cabinet? If it had been able to be repaired, it wouldn’t have been tossed in this room. </p>
<p>His only other constant was watching Granger. He didn’t go out of his way, much, but it seemed he was always be positioned to watch her if they were in the same area together. And he only watched her because she was watching him. Potter stalked him, but Granger looked at him like he was a puzzle. </p>
<p>She was, by far, more concerning.</p>
<p>Tonight was Slughorn’s party. He’d been invited, but declined, not wanting to spend a whole evening with the blowhard Potions professor. He’d just learned Granger was going with McLaggen of all people and considered crashing the party. He could drop off the gift his mother had recommended. He knew it wouldn’t work, but it would placate the Dark Lord that he was trying.</p>
<p>Draco lingered after Transfiguration, wanting to leave after Granger. Less likely he’d be noticed. She left quickly though and Draco couldn’t catch up without running. He did end up behind McLaggen and another Gryffindor seventh year.</p>
<p>“You saw her at the Yule Ball. Underneath that frumpiness, she’s fit. Probably a little eager for attention too, if you know what I mean,” McLaggen was saying. “The plainer girls are so desperate for a boyfriend, they always play nicely.”</p>
<p>Draco saw the leer on his face when McLaggen turned to nudge the other student. He gripped his wand even while knowing he wouldn’t defend her.</p>
<p>The other boy rolled his eyes. “Yeah, right. No bloody way you’re getting anywhere near Granger’s knickers. You couldn’t find a bigger prude.”</p>
<p>McLaggen shook his finger and tutted. “Ah, that’s where you’re wrong. She asked me to be her date. And it’s always the quiet ones who want it the worst. You just watch. I’ll have her on her knees after pudding.” He arched an eyebrow and licked his lips. “In fact, why don’t you watch? Disillusion yourself at the alcove behind the unicorn herd portrait. There’s plenty of room for all of us.”</p>
<p>The two boys laughed and their comments got filthier and filthier before Draco couldn’t stand it any longer. At the entrance to the Great Hall, he ducked behind a corner. Two whispered spells later, McLaggen and the other Gryffinprat’s hands were clasped and stuck together. Another whispered word and they were propelled through the open doors of the Hall. </p>
<p>Draco hung back a moment, listening to the erupted laughter from the lunch crowd and the squawks from the Disgusting One. When he entered the Hall, McGonagall stood over McLaggen and his close friend. Draco snickered.</p>
<p>“Mr. McLaggen, Mr. Towler. Kindly resume eating. You may go to the Hospital Wing when you have finished your meal.” She peered down her nose past her glasses. “As I recall, the Unsticking Potion requires it be taken on a full stomach.” Before reaching the professor’s table, she turned back. “And perhaps re-evaluate what you were doing just prior to being stuck to Mr. Towler. It seems somebody took offense.”</p>
<p>Draco chuckled, but schooled his features into its typical blankness. As he took his seat, he noted Granger shooting looks at McLaggen, smothering a grin. Her face fell momentarily before settling into a mask that held just a bit too much irritation to be blank. He looked up to see Weaslebee pressed up against the Brown slag outside of the Hall. </p>
<p>He exhaled slowly and took a few apple slices from the fruit tray.</p>
<p>“Draco, are we going to Hogsmeade before hols?” Pansy asked, interrupting his musings. She wrapped her hand around his upper arm and rested her cheek on his shoulder.</p>
<p>He shook her off, removing himself from her grip. He sneered and stood up. “Find someone else, Pansy. I’m busy.” </p>
<p>She looked hurt as he left, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. She was suffocating with her clinginess and desperation. He knew his father was looking at her as a possible alliance, but Draco was going to voice his objection in the next letter he wrote home. They’d dated already and he’d discovered her disloyalty earlier this year. For someone who was ‘saving it for marriage,’ she didn’t have any qualms about blowing seventh years.</p>
<p>He had a free period before his next class, so he headed for the cabinet. He hadn’t hit on the right combination of spells yet, but he was getting closer. He’d decide about Slughorn’s party later.</p>
<p>He heard the tapping of feet running up behind him. He spun, wand at his side but pointed forward, to face the threat. </p>
<p>He looked into deep brown eyes. “Granger. What do you want? Don’t you know better than to run up on people?” He crossed his arms and stared down at her. </p>
<p>Her brow furrowed beneath her long bangs. “You’re right, sorry. I’m not here to hurt you though.”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed. “Obviously, Granger.”</p>
<p>That seemed to confuse her even more. “Right. I thought to tell you that… even though we don’t get on… if you ever need help, with anything… well, you could come to me.”</p>
<p>Draco kept his face smooth of expression, but internally his eyes were agog.</p>
<p>When he didn’t reply, she rushed to keep talking.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t tell anyone, if you didn’t want me to, I mean.” She gripped her hands in front of her. “I just…” She looked at her shoes before straightening her spine and continuing in a much stronger voice. “I sometimes wonder if no one in this bloody school has a choice.  Expectations and reputations, that’s about it. Well, if you want to make a different choice, you can find me.”</p>
<p>Granger’s color had risen. She spun away without waiting for his reply and very nearly was out of earshot before he recovered enough to call out to her.</p>
<p>“Granger,” Draco called. She didn’t turn around, she just stood there. Draco could practically hear her swallow her nervousness. “You forgot threats. Expectation, reputations and terrorization.”</p>
<p>He stood behind her now and Draco could hear her raspy breaths. She was scared of him, but offered her help anyway. He reached out to touch her puffy brown curls, but stopped before he could sample the softness.</p>
<p>“There may be choices, but perhaps someone ends up hurt no matter what.”</p>
<p>He stepped backward, turned and continued to his destination. The cabinet was the best worst choice, no matter what his wishes or the wishes of brave Gryffindor witches.</p>
