    <p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione had just boarded the train for their fourth year at Hogwarts. As usual, the train was packed. It took a while, but the trio was able to find any available compartment. There was only one other person in the compartment - a sleeping boy, most likely a first year, who had spread himself along one side of the seats. He had long, golden hair that he wore in a braid. His clothing was odd, for a wizard or a muggle. His long red coat had what looked like a snake intertwined on a cross on the back of his coat. He had black leather pants the bottoms of which were tucked into black boots that were trimmed with red. On his hands were only slightly dirty white gloves. This person at least looked less dangerous than the last person that the trio had shared a sleeping compartment with, but the trio still hoped that this ride would not end up like the last one.</p><p>“So Hermione,” whispered Ron as the three sat down opposite of the sleeping boy, “do you know who he is?”</p><p>“Why would I?” she asked back, just as quietly.</p><p>“Well you knew last time, didn’t you?”</p><p>“That was because Lupin had his name on his trunk. Do you see any trunks, besides ours, this time?”</p><p>“Hm, it is kind of weird that he doesn’t have any luggage.” Ron laughed, “I bet he was too short to get one up there even if he tried!” While Ron was laughing quietly about his joke, their companion’s eyes shot open at the word, ‘short.’</p><p>“WHO ARE YOU CALLING A BEAN SO TINY HE CAN’T LIFT A BUG BECAUSE IT’S BIGGER THAN HIM!?” their newly awakened companion yelled while making rude gestures. The trio was shocked into silence. Meanwhile, the door to the compartment was flung open to reveal a boy with slicked back blond hair.</p><p>“Well well, Potter, I didn’t know that you started making friends with midgets...” Draco started before the short boy punched him in the face. Draco fell into his two cronies while his nose started gushing blood. The golden haired boy slammed the door shut and sat down with a ‘huff.’</p><p>“Man that guy seems likes a prat!” The boy turned his strange golden eyes onto the trio. The unspoken, “Only a little less that you,” sat in the air. They sat absorbed by the large pools of liquid gold that were staring at them. The silence that filled the compartment was tinged by awe and a bit of fear at more of that anger being directed towards them. “So, who are you guys?” Harry was the first to speak.</p><p>“I’m Harry Potter and these are my friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. We’re fourth years. W-who are you?” He carefully measured each word so as to not upset the boy again.</p><p>“My name's Ed.” He leaned back and put his hands behind his head. His sleeve slid down a little on his arms, revealing a flash of something metal showing from under his right sleeve.</p><p>“What’s that?” asked Hermione, leaning forward as she did so. Ed shoved his hands into his lap, his sleeve falling forward again.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” Ed said so forcefully that the trio reflexively flinched away from him. Ed sighed and closed his eyes, leaning his head back until it hit the back of the seat.</p><p>“So, um, it’s your first year at Hogwarts?” asked Ron carefully. He still felt as if Ed was going to attack him if he said one wrong word.</p><p>“Yeah,” Edward replied, still not moving.</p><p>“So, are you excited?” Harry asked. Ed was quiet for a while as if analyzing the question for anything that could be considered offensive.</p><p>“Nope,” was his only response.</p><p>“Are you nervous?” asked Hermione. “I know that I was.” Ed shook his head in the negative again before shifting his gaze out the window. The trio exchanged curious glances. Harry considered dropping their questioning, but this new student was just so different from even the most eccentric wizards he had met.</p><p>“Well,” Hermione picked up, “Is there anything that you want you know about Hogwarts before we get there? We know a lot about the first year classes and such.”</p><p>He shrugged. “I’m not in the first year, so I don’t think that will be nessiacarry.”</p><p>The three students jerked with slight surprise. “So what year are you in?” asked Harry carefully. There was already a bit more tension in the strange boy’s posture. Probably from the implication that he looked young.</p><p>Ed pulled a bundle of papers out of his pocket. He picked through it until he found a letter that the three recognized as a Hogwarts acceptance letter. “Fourth,” he said after looking over of the letter. He put the bundle back into his pocket. The trio exchanged more glances, which did not go unnoticed by their companion. “What?” he asked, “Is there something wrong with that?”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione took the initiative to answer Ed’s question. “It’s just that I’ve never heard of anyone doing that before. Transfered into upper years, I mean.” A smirk grew on the blonde’s face.</p><p>“Well I am pretty good at doing what has never been done!” After a few seconds that the trio used to absorb the strange comment, Ron commented on his strange observation from earlier.</p><p>“Where’s your trunk?” Ed shifted uncomfortably while grumbling something about a stupid colonel and him not having time to pack anything. Obviously uncomfortable, he reached into his other pocket and brought out a small, worn, leather notebook. He flipped to a random page and started reading, obviously refusing any more interaction.</p><p>They sat in a, more or less, peaceful silence until the door to the compartment was slammed open for the second time. Malfoy stood in the opening looking pissed off and cetainly looking for revenge. He grabbed Ed’s book and said, “You’re reading?” His voice was more high pitched than the last time the group had heard him. Most likely due to the white bandage that was covering his nose. “We don’t need another stuck up Granger, but you probably have less brains than Crabb.” Malfoy’s expression turned to one of pure rage. “What do you think you’re trying to pull!” The angered teen threw the notebook onto the floor in desperation and anger. This action allowed those in the compartment a clear view of the strange circles and long lists that consisted of words, which made no sense to those looking at it, that the small book contained. Ed picked it up quickly and elbowed Malfoy in the gut in order to make him recede from the compartment.</p><p>“You really should be more careful with things that don’t belong to you.” The blonde’s voice was cold enough to petrify everyone within hearing distance. After shutting the door, Ed sat down with the petrifying anger slowly leaving his eyes. “Who was that git? He must have some of power to be that annoying.”</p><p>“Draco Malfoy,” replied Ron, Hermione, and Harry all at once. The tension in the room was lifted a little as the boy laughed.</p><p>“Who would actually name their kid that! I mean seriously, Draco? It can’t even be shortened into something even close to normal.” After his laughing subsided, he laid down on the seats so that he back in the position that the trio had found him in. “Wake me up when we get there.”</p><p>The boy was asleep almost instantly. After those left awake in the compartment made sure that the boy was asleep, the trio began whispering about some of the events that had happened over the summer.</p>
