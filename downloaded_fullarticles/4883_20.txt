  <em>“Potter?”</em>
</p><p>“Hmmm…”</p><p>
  <em>“I’m bored.”</em>
</p><p>“So?”</p><p>
  <em>“Entertain me.”</em>
</p><p>“Seriously? What am I? A performing monkey?”</p><p>“<em>No. But you’re my partner.”</em></p><p>“Yeah. And that means I have work with you. No one said anything about entertaining you. Why are you bored anyway?”</p><p>
  <em>“What do you mean why? We haven’t had a new case for a week.”</em>
</p><p>“Then do your paper-work.”</p><p>
  <em>“I hate paper-work.”</em>
</p><p>“Tell that to Kingsley.”</p><p>
  <em>“Humpf.”</em>
</p><p>“Quit huffing.”</p><p>
  <em>“What are you doing?”</em>
</p><p>“Working.”</p><p>
  <em>“On what?”</em>
</p><p>“My report on the Merryweather case.”</p><p>
  <em>“Ugh! That was barely a challenge. The man’s an idiot.”</em>
</p><p>“True. Made for an easy case though. It’s nice once in a while not to half kill ourselves to catch a suspect.”</p><p>
  <em>“…”</em>
</p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>
  <em>“Still bored.”</em>
</p><p>“Still not a monkey.”</p><p>
  <em>“Let’s talk then.”</em>
</p><p>“What about?”</p><p>
  <em>“Your love life.”</em>
</p><p>“I don’t have one.”</p><p>
  <em>“Why not?”</em>
</p><p>“No particular reason. I just happen to be single at the moment.”</p><p>
  <em>“You’ve been single for the last two years.”</em>
</p><p>“So have you.”</p><p>
  <em>“Hmmm…you noticed.”</em>
</p><p>“Of course I did. I wonder why though.”</p><p>
  <em>“The world is full of boring people. What’s your reason?”</em>
</p><p>“The world is full of fake people.”</p><p>“<em>I see. You think people are only interested in you because you’re the boy who lived.”</em></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>
  <em>“Idiots! So you lived. So you have a bloody scar. So what? You’re just another bloke. You’re brave and you have a good heart and you’re good looking. But you’re nothing exceptional.”</em>
</p><p>“You think I’m good looking?”</p><p>
  <em>“Do you have a mirror?”</em>
</p><p>“Last I heard, my hair was awful, my glasses were too large and my sense of fashion was pathetic…your words.”</p><p>
  <em>“All still true. But you’re attractive despite all that. You certainly turn my head.”</em>
</p><p>“Do you…um…do you fancy me Draco?”</p><p>
  <em>“Maybe.”</em>
</p><p>“Enough to go out with me?”</p><p>
  <em>“Maybe.”</em>
</p><p>“How about tonight?”</p><p>
  <em>“Okay.”</em>
</p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>
  <em>“Hmmm…”</em>
</p><p>“I fancy you too.”</p><p> </p>
