          <div class="userstuff"><p>"I can't believe him!" I shout to nothing in particular. </p><p>Ron and Hermione glance at each other, their eyebrows raised.</p><p>"Harry, you do know it's Malfoy's job to make you miserable, right?" Ron points out as if the normalcy of it should comfort me.</p><p>"I don't see why! We were getting along and then he tells me he loves me as some sick joke?" I throw my hands up in irritation. "I hate him!"</p><p>"Er... Well, how do you know it was a joke?" Hermione sighs and sits on a rock in the courtyard.</p><p>"Hermione, of course it was a joke. Malfoy isn't gay or anything." Ron shifts uncomfortably.</p><p>Hermione glares at Ron. "I mean, it would make sense. Draco flushes whenever he sees you and is always talking about you, Harry. Maybe it was genuine."</p><p>"It's more like he got wind that I fancy him and now is trying to humiliate me in front of the school," I rage, my hands balling into fists.</p><p>"Harry, just take a breath. I'm sure that as slimy as Draco is, he wouldn't do that." She brushes a lock of hair behind her ear.</p><p>"I'm not trying to be an arse," Draco says from behind us, "I do love you. It's just... I understand if you don't want to do anything about it. I really didn't mean to confess earlier. It just... Slipped out."</p><p>I blink, staring at the pale teenager. It's hard to focus with him so close. Draco gives a shrug and walks away. I watch him go until Hermione pushes me.</p><p>"Go tell him you like him too!" she hisses.</p><p>I think she might have spelled me because my legs start moving before my brain knows what I'm doing. </p></div>
