  <strong>PROLOGUE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>12 February 1979</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>There were times – admittedly many times – when King Ragnarok, the Ruler of the Goblin Realm, was not pleased with the job that had been ordained to him. Reading over the day’s workings as he sat behind his great wooden desk, he realized how this may be one of those times.</p><p>     Weary black eyes hovered over the words on the parchment in front of him; Universal Brooms Ltd. had evidently incurred countless heavy losses in the past few years that had now finally caught up with the once-popular company. Though they had attempted to push out several above-average brooms, the company was simply not good enough competition against the relatively new Nimbus Racing Broom Company.</p><p>     John Terkweed (Head Representative for Universal Brooms) had declared the company’s intent to file for bankruptcy a week ago, explaining that the debts owed to Gringotts were far too heavy and vast for there to be any chance of recovery. The owners had arrived today for their meeting to finalise the details of the bankruptcy, and tempers had run hot between the joint-partners – apparently one had begged the other to sell the company years ago, but the other had refused to listen because he believed that they still had a chance. Both men had finally parted Gringotts, and perhaps each other, about two hours later, covered in the bruises they had gifted one another.</p><p>     Now, Ragnarok was left to add the final signature on the Order of Restriction that would be placed upon both owners, giving Gringotts the rights to all assets belonging to them – so that they may be sold or auctioned – in order to begin the repayment of their debts. Lifting his quill, Ragnarok dipped it into his pot of ink. With a few practiced scratches on the neat line at the bottom of the parchment, the Order was fully authorised. Tomorrow, Gringotts Executives would be sent to all properties that had once belonged to Universal Brooms to collect and handle their possessions. It was as Ragnarok pored himself another glass of fine Elf-made wine that he wondered whether it was blind faith or plain arrogance that led to the end of Universal Broom Limited.</p><p>     He swung his head back and took a large swig of the blood-red liquid, allowing the sweet, summery taste to fill his mouth, and he closed his eyes, wishing with all his soul that the drink was something far stronger. But alas, King Ragnarok could not be seen inebriated – or indeed weakened in any way, shape or form – lest those who already believed he was too broken to rule have any evidence to prove their claims. </p><p>     While his eyes remained closed, Ragnarok noticed a soft glow to the left of his fastened eyelids. He ignored the light for a little bit, not finding anything about it to be alarming, but when it had begun to grow, brighter and brighter and brighter, hotter and hotter and hotter, he threw his eyes wide open. </p><p>     Ragnarok searched for the source of the brightness and found it was coming from the bottom drawer on the left side of his desk. His alarm increased at this – as this particular drawer had been sparsely used, even while his father had reigned the kingdom – and that may have been why he had rushed to pull the drawer open only to remember when it was too late that it had been his only shield from getting hit with the full extent of the light.</p><p>     Thankfully, Ragnarok had not been blinded by his foolishness. He had shielded his eyes with his hands and waited until a few notes later when the glow had softened. Although it was still uncomfortable, Ragnarok lowered his hands and unclenched his eyes, finally able to view the soft pulsating glow coming from within a thick old tome that laid on the polished wood. </p><p>     The last time Ragnarok had seen this particular tome, he had been twenty years younger, and – on a day as dull as any of his others – his curiosity had gotten the better of him. At the time, the book had been mere tatters, practically falling apart in his hands, and it had lost his interest very quickly. Now though . . . now its cover was coloured a rich dark chocolate, the golden title shimmering like a fresh Galleon straight out of the Gringotts furnaces.</p><p>     He read the Latin clearly in his mind: ‘Annales Regum et Reginarum Maleficus.’  And the lavish amount of lessons in the various languages of the world were not necessary as there was no Goblin who ever called himself King that did not know what this book was.</p><p>     Bending down, Ragnarok gripped the tome, wincing slightly at the heat it encased. Ignoring this, he lifted it, struggling due to its great weight, and placed it gently on the table – above the documents that now laid long forgotten – where it made a muffled thud against the wood. The king stared at the cover, taking deep breaths to calm himself. How many centuries has it been? Four? – Five? Ragnarok did not know, but what he did know was that the book’s activity only meant one thing . . . and the very thought of it overwhelmed him.</p><p>     He steadied himself, furrowing his thick, furry eyebrows. His hands clutched at the pages and he pulled open the thick tome to the end, where brand new parchment shone with a golden gleam that throbbed steadily, the sight filling the king with hope; as where the radiance reminded him very much of the bright star he always gazed at through the window in his bedchamber, the pulsating glow did not cease . . . two beats, and pause, two beats, and pause, two beats, and pause, and on and on it went – a beat that carried the song of new life.</p><p>     Neatly-scripted, shining golden ink appeared on the blank page, and Ragnarok hungrily read through it, as though he were afraid it would disappear as instantly as it materialised. </p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong> <em>12</em> </strong> <strong> <em> <sup>th</sup> </em> </strong> <strong> <em> February 1979</em> </strong></p><p align="center">

  <em>Anna Smith neè West has been delivered of a son.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ragnarok’s narrowed eyes flickered over the words again and again, his lips murmuring them over to himself. Was that it?</p><p><em>     </em>Before he could flip the pages back to see if similar announcements had been made in the past, the shimmering golden writing returned, scribing the proclamation that would change his life forevermore . . .</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Prince Nicholas of House Westerly, Heir Apparent for Avalon, is given all worldly rights to the throne through his blood and magic.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Just as the king had only begun comprehending what he was reading, a few more words faded into existence; this time, the ink as black as the darkest of ravens, with no shine accompaning them.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Anna Smith neè West has succumbed to infection and severe bleeding. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>May she rest in peace.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Your Majesty?”</p><p>     Ragnarok glanced up from the page to the new arrival within his office. Lord Rockstooth, the Royal Advisor and also the Head of Gringotts, stood just inside the double doors he had entered through, appearing out of breath. His black overcoat and sword belt had become disordered from his obvious run, but his slanted black eyes looked only relieved at the sight of the king. “Rockstooth,” Ragnarok acknowledged neutrally. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>     “The wards triggered, Your Grace,” said Rockstooth, waddling closer to the king, all the while glancing around searchingly, his hand firmly grasping the hilt of his sword. “They indicated a foreign object that could cause you harm.”</p><p>     “I assure you,” Ragnarok growled, “the only danger here is my incense at your unwavering belief that I cannot protect myself.”</p><p>     At one time, maybe a few decades ago, the glare he threw at Rockstooth would have made the smaller goblin quiver in his little polished shoes. At is was, Rockstooth had now served under him for far too long and had grown immune to his wrath. </p><p>     “With respect, Your Grace,” Rockstooth said strictly, “As I am sure you are aware, the procedures surrounding your security are compulsory and would be in place, regardless of your ability in combat.”</p><p>     He narrowed his eyes, responding with words as sharp as daggers, “With respect, Lord Rockstooth, these security measures did naught for the rest of my family.”</p><p>     “Maybe not,” Rockstooth supposed, without missing a beat, “but you are still obliged to live under them.”</p><p>     Ragnarok glared at his Advisor for a moment longer before he dropped his head, releasing a long-suffering sigh, and finally nodding in acceptance.</p><p>     A few moments of silence followed, and Rockstooth seized the opportunity to ask the king about the wards: “Do you know what may have caused the trigger, Your Grace?”</p><p>     Ragnarok considered if he should tell Rockstooth but eventually decided that if anyone should know, it should be the Royal Advisor. After all, both Ragnarok and Rockstooth were two of only three in the world who knew of the prophecy. "Seeing as the protections placed upon my chambers and office are renewed to newer and more advanced ones every month, the wards may not have been able to identify this," he pointedly stared at the opened book still on his desk in front of him, "as anything other than foreign, due to its age." </p><p>     Rockstooth looked at the book disbelievingly. “The wards triggered because of some old book?” He looked utterly offended at the very notion. “What is it?”</p><p>     “This is an ancient written archive of wizarding kings and queens of this country,” said Ragnarok. “And the wards triggered, not because of the book itself, but because of the charms placed upon it.”</p><p>     Disgust marred the younger goblin’s face as he ferociously snarled at the volume like it had insulted his ancestors. “Why do we have a book belonging to wizards in our possession?”</p><p>     “Because King Warnock had vowed to protect it with his life when the last Queen of Avalon – Queen Eleanora – had placed it in his care,” Ragnarok answered. “Her children were barren of magic, disabling them from having any legitimate claim to the throne, so, with her death, goblins were given charge to protect her descendants. You know about the pure-blood wizard opinions of non-magical children born to highborn magical families?”</p><p>     “It is abhorrent,” said Rockstooth, shaking his head disapprovingly.</p><p>     "Undeniably," Ragnarok agreed. "The royal prince and princesses had eventually married and all were unable to produce a magical heir – not one of the Queen's grandchildren had any kind of magical ability – and they were all forced to leave the wizarding community to live in the mundane world. When her council began to turn against her, Queen Eleanora feared for her children and grandchildren, so she asked for help from the only ally left to her – King Warnock. She knew the goblins were renowned for our capability in protecting treasure, and she considered her family to be greatest treasures of them all – an opinion we goblins also keep of our own young. Queen Eleanora was certain of our honour and she was sure that if the records were kept with us, handed down generations to generations of our kings, her family would be kept safe until a time came in which a magical heir would be born." </p><p>     “There has been no royal heir since King Warnock?” asked Rockstooth in shock. “That must be at least five hundred years, Your Grace!”</p><p>     “Five hundred years of disaster, I know you will agree,” said Ragnarok. “A civil war between nearly all highborn families who thought themselves noble enough to rule the kingdom directly after Queen Eleanora’s death which resulted in the formation of their Wizengamot. Three Goblin Wars were then fought due to their immense disrespect of our customs, something that would never have occurred with the presence of a figure – a royal – who would have been knowledgeable of our traditions. And now, a Dark Lord has risen. He embodies all of the ideals that belonged to the ancient families who dishonourably drove out Queen Eleanora’s children.”</p><p>     "Lord Voldemort," Rockstooth scoffed. "If only those senseless wizards in the Ministry of Magic know the hilarity of declaring opposition against him when he has already infiltrated their government, with his most-loyal followers being on the Wizengamot itself. I wonder why they do not question how the Dark Lord is getting all these other followers . . . surely they know that only gold speaks?"</p><p>     A vicious smile lifted at his lips. Nearly every goblin could name at least thirty Death Eaters from the top of their head, simply from the observations made on their accounts in the past few years. King Ragnarok had ordered them all to keep this information silent; if wizards were too arrogant to even consider the goblins as allies during this war, then they must reap what they sow on their own. "You are right, of course," said Ragnarok. "We follow the gold that which feeds us – it is the simplest nature of all beings in this world – and the people with the most gold, other than our own people, are those within the ancient families of the Wizengamot. The corruption is deep rooted in its system, but I know, with the presence of higher authority that outranks the Wizengamot – such as a monarch – the current war could have been deterred." </p><p>     Rockstooth studied Ragnarok carefully. “Is this why you are reading that record? I do not think you should dwell in the past and the what-could-have-been this intensively, Your Grace.”</p><p>     “I do not read this for the history, my friend,” Ragnarok said as he lifted his head to him. His voice was thick with hopefulness. “This record may very well be our future.”</p><p>     Rockstooth frowned confusedly. “Sire?”</p><p>     “Do you remember the prophecy about the Promised Ones?” asked Ragnarok. “The one made only a month ago.” He rotated the book and pushed it across the desk, towards Rockstooth who leaned down to read the short entry on the page.</p><p>     Rockstooth’s head snapped up almost instantly, and he whispered ever so softly, with faith that Ragnarok could just about taste in the air,</p><p>     “The Prince . . .”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Two Years Later</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p><strong> <em> <u>24</u> </em> </strong> <strong> <em> <u> <sup>th</sup> </u> </em> </strong> <strong> <em> <u> November 1981</u> </em> </strong><em> </em></p><p>The sun dipped low in the west and Ragnarok watched from the balcony of his castle as the town beneath him gradually quieted, settling down for the evening.</p><p>     Every time he found himself in this position, the king felt resentment rise up in his throat like bile after a bad meal. Each of the small houses that were stacked against each other in the village were simple and small, and they were as close to each other as architecturally possible so that all the scrapped space left to them by those damned Wizards was used.</p><p>     How much longer should we live like dogs? Ragnarok asked himself.</p><p>     The Goblin Nation had tried and tried to protest against their treatment, the greatest of all their protests being the Goblin Rebellion of 1877 where King Grenyx had risen up and made allies of the Werewolves. Two Ministers for Magic had resigned from their positions because of that Rebellion, and the Wizards had almost been brought to their knees. Unfortunately, it was not to be. The Wizengamot had bought off the Werewolves, and the Goblins had been betrayed, and they were all left with thousands dead for nothing but more restrictions placed upon their livelihood.</p><p>     In the distance, Ragnarok glimpsed the lake between the houses and trees. The sky was darkening, the hues of orange and red had begun to fade, and the colours reflected off the tranquil surface of the water, shimmering like a sheet of beaten copper. A peaceful ending to a tragic war, he serenely observed.</p><p>     Minister Bagnold had announced the death of Lord Voldemort over the Wizarding Wireless Network, and the previously-declining economy boomed; witches and wizards were emerging from their homes, spilling the gold from their accounts with no care in the world, and the Goblins overjoyed. At the height of the war, everyone had gone into hiding, taking their gold with them, and all work was sparse. Now that Lord Voldemort had been proclaimed dead, there was no more fear, businesses had started up again, and gold flowed freely between the happy populace. Many malicious Goblins – those who did not bother themselves with the vows of confidentiality they had made to the Wizards – would also mention that a number of members from the Wizengamot were also transferring large amounts of gold into Minister Bagnold’s accounts, most likely to buy themselves their acquittals due to involvement with the Dark Lord.</p><p>     Goblin hands were further full from the necessity to freeze accounts. Although they held great amounts of contempt for Wizardkind, the Goblins still viewed the events that occurred at and around Godric's Hollow as a great tragedy. An innocent child had been stolen of both his mother and father in one night, left as an orphan within only a few moments of destruction. As a result, the Potter accounts were locked – with the exception of the hefty trust fund the boy's parents had established for him in the event of their deaths – and they would remain that way until Harry Potter was of age to inherit. </p><p>     Ragnarok could not deny his admiration for James and Lily Potter who had acknowledged the worst possible outcome and prepared so thoroughly for it. Regrettably, that did not stop others from interfering in the last wishes they had stated clearly in their Last Will and Testament. Gringotts had received correspondence from the Ministry of Magic earlier this afternoon, documents declaring Albus Dumbledore as the main guardian of Harry Potter – even though the Potters had explicitly stated that Dumbledore was only the fourth possible guardian, and one Remus Lupin (the only one that was not either imprisoned, insane, or dead) was higher up on their list of guardians. </p><p>     Lawfully, Goblins had no right to intervene with this action; they were only responsible for the protection of such documents, like wills and leases, as well as finances. Above this, they did not usually feel passionate enough about the Wizards' constant misdemeanors or misconduct to do anything. </p><p>     One of the biggest, and richest, families on the Wizengamot – the Black family – had also taken a large hit in the war. Deaths and imprisonments had led to there not being any direct heirs to their properties. Laws surrounding these circumstances stated: A period of eighteen years must pass, without any present successors who have a legitimate claim to all assets, before they are then given to the Ministry of Magic, to be handled and distributed as seen fit. This was done so that any child may have enough time to give claim to those properties and also be old enough to inherit. In relation to the Blacks, Ragnarok was aware of three distant relatives who may attempt to claim the large fortune. </p><p>     Rockstooth had informed Ragnarok of the worth of the Galleon increasing by two percent in the space of nearly two months. This was the steepest incline the Goblins had seen in over thirty years – a cause for celebration for them as the more the worth increased, the more they would be receiving in commissions.</p><p>     The town below had been lively today. Ragnarok watched children sprint as fast as they could, waving their small wooden swords around joyously, away from their snarling mothers. The fathers usually stood sternly to the side, but when the children began fighting one another, they usually stepped forward to chide them for their incorrect footwork. “You must pivot when you deliver your stroke,” one father had told his daughter. “You are small, but if you pivot your weight will add to the blow.”</p><p>     Ragnarok was challenged to many duels over the week, and he was also asked to witness many of the others. He attended as many of these as he could, observing his duty without a complaint as he required no complaint. Seeing the joy of his people had made him the happiest he had been for some time.</p><p>     His positive mood did not last for long, however.</p><p>     Earlier on in the afternoon, the Annales Regum et Reginarum Maleficus had pulsated desperately with a blood red light. Ragnarok had dropped his quill in his alarm and swiftly summoned Rockstooth. Blood red could only mean one thing – a warning. The life of the heir was in mortal danger.</p><p>     Rockstooth had arrived within two minutes of his summoning, and Ragnarok wasted no time. He pressed his hand against the page which declared the birth of the prince, all the while gripping at Rockstooth with his other hand, and he muttered, “Mittenobis,” thus activating the enchantments placed around the book that would instantly transport him and Rockstooth to the Prince Nicholas’ present location.</p><p>     In less than a flash, they had both arrived and grew horrified and enraged at what they were seeing.</p><p>     Prince Nicholas – not even three years of age – was left on the floor of a small prison-like room. He was small, very small, and his eyes were clenched shut, his breaths coming out in long-pained wheezes; his black hair was matted across his forehead, and a sheet of cold sweat covered him like a blanket. Ragnarok's eyes raked over the boy's half-naked body which was covered in several large blue and yellowing bruises, shivering violently from the cold November air that drifted through the windows of the lifeless grey room. The prince's bones were visibly poking out of the thin layer of skin that barely protected him from whoever had mistreated him so. </p><p>     King Ragnarok growled furiously. Humans lacked honour. Humans lacked morals. He knew they were the most despicable creatures in this world. Their egotistical nature had made them believe that they were unbeaten in intelligence, that they had the right to restrain other creatures or keep them as slaves to do their bidding or for their entertainment. They had even gone as far as to fight statuses amongst themselves; the rich against the poor; the white-skinned against the coloured. Humans had the world at their feet, but they kept their views primitive, no different than when they had only been apes thousands of years ago.  </p><p>     Through all their faults, through all their stupidity, Ragnarok always thought there was a line – one not even the humans would cross – but the sight before him at this very moment taught the king that he was wrong to be so optimistic. He still had much to learn.</p><p>     How could this brutish civilisation be able to build machines and weapons that could reign the fires of hell upon whole cities before they have even created a world free from vile acts against innocent children? This . . . this blatant hatred against a mere child was the very epitome of everything that repulsed the Goblins.</p><p>     Ragnarok knelt beside the quivering child – the Prince of the Prophecy – and placed his hand against the boy’s damp forehead. His face burned with the flush of fever, and with the smaller gap between them, Ragnarok could more clearly hear the short, quick raspy gasps that painfully and rigidly swallowed the chilled air around him. The king felt the boy’s magic reaching out for his hand desperately, detecting that he did not wish to cause any harm, begging him to help. Ragnarok snarled, thoroughly disgusted by whoever had done this, and let a flow of his magic run down his arm and into the young prince.</p><p>     The effect was instant; Nicholas had stopped trembling and his scrunched face relaxed, softening into a peaceful sleep while several of his more pronounced bruises had begun to fade and his pasty skin gained a bit of colour.</p><p>     Ragnarok reached up to unhook the silver chain that fastened his thick black cloak around his neck. Placing the cloth down on the ground next to the skinny child, Ragnarok tucked one hand under the boy’s neck, and the other beneath his knees, lifting him up and gently placing him on the cloak, wrapping it around him and securing the silver chain around his chest. Ragnarok then lifted Nicholas up again, standing with the boy safely tucked in his arms.</p><p>     “Who could have done this?” Rockstooth snarled in disgust. “To a child – a prince.”</p><p>     Ragnarok shook his head. “I do not know.”</p><p>     “With your permission, Your Grace, I should like to investigate.”</p><p>     “I give you leave,” Ragnarok approved. “Find out who lives here. We already know that the boy’s mother passed after childbirth, so that leaves his father and extended family as suspects. Approach me when you have found all you can. And make sure you are disguised, Rockstooth. We do not want the Ministry catching wind of this.”</p><p>     “Yes, Your Grace,” said Rockstooth. “But the child . . .”</p><p>     “He will be returning with me,” Ragnarok stated. “Warnock promised security, and I will carry through with his vow. Prince Nicholas is a Ward of the Goblin Nation.” With that, Ragnarok gave his stunned Advisor a nod and then silently vanished, Prince Nicholas sleeping in his arms.</p><p>     Goblins did not have many hospitals. Injuries were symbols of pride and honour, and sickness was too much of rarity to bother with establishments dedicated to healing. Despite this, Ragnarok knew a group of Goblin Healers who were renowned for their absolute knowledge in their profession. They had not only taken it upon themselves to learn the traditional Goblin methods of treatment, but they also learned the Centaur, Elf, Wizard, and even mundane approaches to healing. This was why Ragnarok felt confident that bringing Prince Nicholas back to the Goblin Lands was the best possible decision he could make. Here, Nicholas would receive the best treatment. </p><p>     Ragnarok carried Nicholas through the halls of his castle home, all the way to the uninhabited room next to his own bedchambers. Laying him down on the king-sized bed, and covering him with the comforter, Ragnarok called upon the Goblin Healers. He urged them all to not leave their patients if their situation was dire, but still, they came within thirty minutes of being called. </p><p>     They were befuddled upon arrival, surprised it was not their king that required their services, but actually a human child. Ragnarok was thankful when they had chosen to stay silent (save for general questions such as Nicholas’ age as well as the circumstances in which he was found), getting to work on the boy without further interrogation.</p><p>     Hours passed as the Healers treated Nicholas. Once they were done, Healer Argok – an old friend of King Ragnarok’s – had approached him quietly. “The boy is stable,” he informed. “He was severely undernourished, dehydrated, and wounded internally.”</p><p>     “And now?”</p><p>     “All his injuries have been healed successfully, but there is only so much that can be done about the lack of food and water the boy has had in his life,” Argok said, shaking his head. “However much I wish there was a quicker way to bring him to good health, all I can do is prescribe potions to help him gain all the nutrients he needs to live healthily. I do believe they will help him . . .”</p><p>     “But?” Ragnarok prompted.</p><p>     Argok sighed tiredly. “There is significant cause to judge the boy must have lived like this since his birth. His lungs are significantly damaged from repeated infections, his stomach is almost the size of a Sickle, so – even though it is unlikely – there is a chance the potions will have the opposite effect on him. If he survives –”</p><p>     “<em>When</em> he survives,” Ragnarok swiftly corrected, not wishing to entertain any other possibility. “Argok, I know you for your prudence, but I felt his magic when I reached him. It was still fighting. He had no hope for rescue, yet still he fought. There is strength in him.”</p><p>     “I cannot deny his strength,” said Argok thoughtfully. “I felt his magic, too. It was steady as any healthy child’s magic, solid and unwavering . . . almost as if there was something anchoring him to this world. But – and I say this with all cold reasoning, Your Grace – we must be aware that even if he survives, the lasting damage to his immune system could hinder him in ways yet to be seen.”</p><p>     Ragnarok mulled over the Healer’s words intently. <em>Like something was anchoring him to this world</em> . . . Those words were too precise to be coincidental, and only seemed to reinforce what was foretold about the prince’s future.</p><p>     “It would be best for the boy to be monitored closely around-the-clock for the next three days at the very least,” Argok went on. “Perhaps one of the castle elves would be ideal? They would be able to contact me immediately should anything occur.”</p><p>     Ragnarok nodded absentmindedly. “It will be done. Thank you, Argok.”</p><p>     “My pleasure, Your Grace.” Argok promptly left Ragnarok to his musings, his entourage having already left. A healer’s work was never done, apparently.</p><p>     Hours later, Nicholas had yet to wake from his deep slumber, though Ragnarok undeniably preferred it that way. There was no telling how a human child who had lived in such horrific conditions, surrounded by cruel mundane people, would react to seeing a Goblin. Ragnarok could not even rely on the naïve imagination that normally plagued children his age; the grey room the prince was found in was void of books, void of toys, and void of anything else that could have suggested it contained a little boy. Ragnarok could only hope that Nicholas would trust his magical instincts and know that no harm would come to him here.</p><p>     Deciding to get some work done whilst waiting for either Nicholas to wake, or for Rockstooth to return, Ragnarok commanded some passing elves to fetch all the documents that needed his attention. They obliged, bringing him the whole stack that was generally piled atop his desk, and he conjured himself a desk facing Nicholas’ bed so he could both work and keep an eye on the boy.</p><p>     He read through the heap of parchments thoroughly, signing those he was sure about, and waiting for Rockstooth’s council for others. The pile gradually decreased in size until, eventually, there were none left.</p><p>     By then, Ragnarok turned his eyes to the balcony and noticed the sun beginning to set. He had unlocked the latch that kept the doors closed, and stepped outside. There he had stood, praying for his people to always be as happy as they are now, until the sun dipped below the horizon; the mauve sky darkened, and in moments, the brightest and biggest star had bowed, giving way to a thousand others.</p><p>     Hearing a quiet whimper and some rustling behind him, Ragnarok looked over his shoulder to see Nicholas tossing under the heavy sheets once again. He had been doing this constantly for the last fifteen minutes or so, causing Ragnarok to suspect that he was probably having a nightmare. The king briefly wondered whether he should wake him, but Argok had instructed him to give Nicholas as much rest as possible. This echoed in his mind as he let the boy be to fight his demons alone.</p><p>     Ten minutes had passed before Nicholas finally settled down.</p><p>     King Ragnarok frowned, moving back inside the room, closing the doors to the balcony behind him. He approached the edge of the bed, levitating the chair behind his desk towards him, and sat himself down. Narrowing his beady eyes in contemplation, Ragnarok found it astonishing how someone so small, so fragile, could have such a great destiny ahead of him.</p><p>     Years ago, a Goblin Seer had begged for an audience with King Ragnarok. Everyone knew that the woman was a creature of absolute lunacy (ironically only making sense when she spoke a prophecy) and he had wondered whether anyone would blame him for being the first Goblin King to turn someone away from the chance to speak, but he had been urged to not do so by Rockstooth – ever the voice of reason – who said that the Seer was claiming the matter was of great importance.</p><p>     The greatest importance, Ragnarok thought idly. The Seer – Rynle – entered the room in a rush, carrying a white orb with a swirling blue cloud inside. She handed it to him, and he had taken it with weary hands, and there his hope had begun.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>The Age of Albion is coming . . .” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ragnarok had intently listened to the prophecy several times, placing it in the back of his mind until he had first read the declaration of the Prince’s birth. He had realised only then that the prophecy had some true substance. Rynle’s Prophecy was further brought into relevance when Harry Potter – the Boy-Who-Lived – survived the Dark Lord’s Killing Curse with only a scar on his forehead as his mark. That meant two figures out of the three in the prophecy had been revealed, and Ragnarok could no longer overlook it.</p><p>     He focused his eyes back on the little and brittle Prince Nicholas. Serenity was plastered across his face as he slept, his chest rising and falling rhythmically in accordance with his slow, shallow breaths. One day, this boy would be King of Avalon.</p><p>     <em>Knock, knock. </em></p><p>     The door that led into the bedchamber creaked open slightly, and Rockstooth peeked his head in through the crack. “May I come in, Your Grace?”</p><p>     “Yes, of course,” said Ragnarok, leaning back in his chair. “Have you completed your investigation?”</p><p>     Rockstooth strolled into the room, gently shutting the door. “I have indeed,” he said gravely. He faced his king. “The boy’s father is the only other inhabitant in that house.”</p><p>     “<em>Svikari að blóði</em>,” the king cursed roughly, for a father to lay his hands on his own child would indisputably make him a<em> traitor to blood. </em>“His circumstances?”</p><p>     “Physically? Appalling,” Rockstooth recalled. “He was most definitely inebriated when he answered the door for me. And by the look and smell of him, he had not bathed in days. Upon kindly asking to come inside, he became very confrontational. I believe he thought me to be some government official due to the way I was disguised.”</p><p>     Ragnarok tilted his head inquisitively.</p><p>     “After subduing him and gaining access to the property, I found he was the recipient of financial childcare aid,” Rockstooth explained. “Bank account statements suggest it was his only income, so I imagine he felt threatened at what appeared to be a random inspection of his caring abilities.”</p><p>     “Which do not exist,” Ragnarok scoffed.</p><p>     “Undeniably,” his advisor agreed. “Examination of his mind whilst he was unconscious confirms he is not aware of his son’s absence. He has a malevolent hatred for the boy since the death of his wife. He believes the boy to be responsible.”</p><p>     “Responsible?” Ragnarok stormed. “Prince Nicholas is a child. He has no responsibility, except to <em>be</em>a child.”</p><p>     Rockstooth nodded solemnly. “Further probing in his memories exhibits the fault lying directly on his own shoulders. I witnessed evidence that the cruelty did not begin with the prince, but the prince’s mother, who he was . . . forceful towards. His aggression only increased after learning of Anna West’s plans to leave him, until finally she was too afraid to do so.” He took a moment to breathe. “He had never permitted her attending examinations for her pregnancy, so she was never aware of any complications. When she finally gave birth, she did so on her own.”</p><p>     Ragnarok shook his head and silently sent Anna West a prayer. <em>No truer warrior than a forsaken mother,</em>he thought,<em> ‘lo there in Valhalla shall you see your son once again. </em></p><p>     “His mother was the last of the royal line before him,” the king said out loud, lowly. “Who else may raise the prince?”</p><p>     “The father’s family is not capable, Your Grace,” Rockstooth reported. “Both grandparents are under government care, while the father himself has proven to be far from qualified.”</p><p>     Ragnarok considered this information, knitting his hands together, and staring contemplatively at the slumbering Nicholas. The boy had no one who could truly care for him in his immediate family. “You are certain there are no other relatives from his extended family who could take him?”</p><p>     “Aye.”</p><p>     “Then, I have another job for you.”</p><p>     Rockstooth stood a bit taller. “Anything, Your Grace.”</p><p>     “Go back to that house tomorrow morning,” he instructed. “Force the father to sign over guardianship rights to me by whatever means, bring me all documentation pertaining to him, and make sure that he or the grandparents or the government or anyone else who might have known about the prince do not remember anything about his existence. You may ask any number of the King’s Guard for assistance.”</p><p>     Rockstooth gaped. “Y-Your Grace.” He wavered. “Are you quite sure?”</p><p>    Well, Ragnarok thought, while keeping the prince here guarantees a very . . . uncertain future for him, it would still be better than handing the boy over to someone who may very well be just as terrible as his father. “What would you suggest I do, Rockstooth?”</p><p>     “Give him to the Ministry of Magic,” he answered instantly.</p><p>     “And feed him to the wolves?” Ragnarok snorted. “I think not. You and I both know he would be oppressed in the wizarding world.”</p><p>     “But surely keeping him here would be just as cruel?”</p><p>     “Keeping him here would ensure he is not locked away to rot in some high lord wizard’s dungeons –”</p><p>     “They would not –”</p><p>     Ragnarok raised his hand to halt Rockstooth’s words. “They would. You must understand what he means, Rockstooth. He will have the power to destroy everything they had ever built. And they will fear him for that. They will keep him shackled, in life or through death, to prevent it from ever happening. By keeping him here, however, I can ensure he receives a proper formal education, where he will not only be knowledgeable in the ways of Wizards, but also Goblins and Elves and Centaurs, and every other creature with the intelligence for speech. Here, Prince Nicholas will be raised to be a cultured wizard. He will not be ignorant of the ways of others. Above all else, he will be safe from those who would plot to harm him. The boy is what we have always needed, Rockstooth. He could be our way to freedom.”</p><p>     “Is this how we war now, Your Grace?” Rockstooth asked heatedly. “No Goblin will ever happily accept little scraps of freedom from the palm of a wizard, even if he is one of our own pawns. We will want to fight – to <em>truly</em> fight – for our rights.”</p><p>     “We <em>have</em> fought, you fool!” the king yelled, greatly infuriated by the smaller goblin’s insinuation – that he would manipulate an innocent child to achieve his people’s ends. “All the hours of my childhood spent in those foul history lessons still have not helped me memorise exactly how many times we had lost! I doubt anyone could. How many of our uprisings went up in flames, Rockstooth? Tell me!” He pounded his hand onto his desk, furious. The stinging pain from the force of the contact crept up his arm like grinding bones. “How many battles have we fought against the wizards, and from all those wars, how many victories have we had? How many of our people have bled, have died, in vain for a cause that was damned from the very beginning?”</p><p>     His advisor stayed silent.</p><p>     “Imagine we rose in rebellion at this very moment,” Ragnarok went on, all gritted teeth and clenched fists, “with the wizards only just starting to recover from their civil war, we still do not know if we could win. What we do know, though, is that Rynle’s Prophecy promised us a Prince. And now we have Prince Nicholas here. We also know she promised us another war. And that war . . . that war will either be our damnation, or the beginning of an era of whole unification and equality for all of us. This is the only fight that matters, do you not see?”</p><p>     “Do you not see that putting your faith in the promises of a prophecy is unwise?” Rockstooth returned tightly.</p><p>     “Perhaps it is,” he admitted, “but I will not turn my back on him. The Prince’s presence, the presence of a monarch in the wizarding world, has the possibility to create too large a difference to ignore. Look at him, Rockstooth.”</p><p>     They both turned their eyes to the boy and the steady rise and fall of his chest.</p><p>     “On my honour, I will not exploit him as a mere pawn in my own game of politics,” Ragnarok swore. “He will be raised to be of sound mind regarding all issues, taught by tutors who are not influenced by myself, and once he has been crowned, he will come to make his own decisions concerning those issues.”</p><p>     “And if he decides that those issues aren’t issues at all?”</p><p>     “Then I would have failed in educating him. We must try though, Rockstooth. We must try for every one of us that have died trying to gain our true freedom.”</p><p>     Rockstooth bared his piercing teeth in frustration. “Do you really believe yourself to be capable of raising a human child? Humans are fragile, Your Grace. Prince Nicholas may not be able to handle the ways of Goblins.”</p><p>     It was true enough, Ragnarok considered. Human children seemed to require a gentle approach in nurturing – not something they could receive from Goblins who were typically taught to duel from their fourth year of birth. </p><p>     “You may be right,” he finally admitted. “Perhaps Lord Commander Desmond would be willing to help us in our endeavor.”</p><p>     “Desmond?” asked Rockstooth. “From the Druid Union?”</p><p>     Ragnarok nodded.</p><p>     The Druid Union was renowned as an ancient and exclusive magical organisation whose members were seen as the mediators and law-enforcers of the magical world. Ragnarok admired the organisation as they were among the first to allow creatures other than humans, including Goblins, into their esteemed halls – to be treated as equals.</p><p>     Lord Commander Desmond – the elected leader of the Druid Union – was admired amongst the Goblins for being one of the few wizards in the world that acknowledged their strengths fully, and used those strengths to better their status in the world. Ragnarok had met with him many times over the years and knew him to be grounded and amiable.</p><p>     “Under the Druid Union,” Ragnarok considered out loud, “I am sure Prince Nicholas will be able to proceed and learn at a lesser pace than our kind.”</p><p>     “There is no guarantee that Lord Commander Desmond would accept to take on the prince,” Rockstooth reasoned out.</p><p>     “True enough,” he acknowledged. “It is still important, though, that the Druid Union is, at least, aware of the prince’s existence. They will be essential if the prince will hope for a smooth succession.”</p><p>     “And if the Lord Commander agrees? You must know that he will not be able to teach the boy everything he needs to learn to be king.”</p><p>     Ragnarok agreed with his Advisor, “The rest I will teach him under this very roof. I am a king, and I believe myself fully capable of educating another.”</p><p>     “Yes, Your Grace.” Rockstooth’s expression then softened ever so slightly. “But are you capable of having another child under your roof again, after so long and after all you lost?”</p><p>     His soft-spoken words struck Ragnarok. Ten years ago, almost to the day, the king had lost his lifemate and children. An accident within Gringotts had torn his companion and his dear daughters from him in a single, terrible, blazing moment of fire. Ragnarok had grieved for months, leaving the kingdom to be run by Rockstooth who had routinely tried to get him back to his feet, all the while the king believed that this hurt, this sorrow that throbbed with every beat of his heart in the absence of those he loved most in this world, would never end.</p><p>     Ragnarok took a deep breath, and let it blow out, leaning forward and placing a hand on the side of the boy’s face. Nicholas released a small sigh and unconsciously leaned into the touch. He allowed a small momentary smile to pass his face, finally knowing the answer to Rockstooth’s question.</p><p>     “I have mourned, and I still mourn, and I will never forget my beloveds,” he said gently. “I do not deny the thought of it filling me with fear, but I want to raise him. His father failed him. Humans failed him. I will not fail him.”</p><p>     Nicholas stirred, Ragnarok's gravelly voice disturbing him from his sleep. He whined in displeasure, yawning from his tiny mouth, blinking several times, and then drowsily opening his eyes to reveal bright silver orbs . . . </p><p>     Silver eyes that widened upon focusing on the two Goblins in the room. Ragnarok felt the two-year-old’s magic flare in fear just as Nicholas attempted to jerk away from the hand that was still clutching the side of his face. Ragnarok pulled his hand back slowly, lifting both in front of him to show him that he meant no harm, and subtly casting a warming charm so that he may be recognised.</p><p>     The gesture seemed to work; Nicholas' magic composed itself and retreated. Outwardly, Nicholas calmed from his silent fright and relaxed his rigid body. Widened eyes narrowed back to a normal stare, and he simply remained laying on the large bed and curiously staring at the creatures in the room with him, cocking his head to the side as if he was intrigued by the sight. </p><p>     For a few moments, they all remained silent. Ragnarok lowered his hands, sadly noticing how Nicholas warily watched the movement. The boy composed himself soon enough, however. He lifted one of his thumbs into his mouth, beginning to suck on it while raising his other arm, pointing at Ragnarok’s winged ears.</p><p>     “Big,” he giggled.</p><p>      Rockstooth snorted and Ragnarok was pleased. Nicholas did not seem to fear their appearance, rather he was amused by it, and this was all he could ask for.</p><p>      Both Goblins watched closely as the small boy peeled the covers from his body, wearing only a pair of medical white pants underneath, and advanced towards Ragnarok. The boy’s ribs stuck out, and his movements, though brave, exhibited how frail he really was. Slow and quivering slightly, it was a wonder he was moving at all. Ragnarok felt himself reach out and gently clutch Nicholas’ small hands just before he toed the edge of the bed, brushing off the boy’s attempts to then try and pinch his long, hooked nose.</p><p>     “Well met, Prince Nicholas,” Ragnarok greeted him as quietly as he could. “I was told you would be indisposed for a few more days at the least. Your strength, however, does not surprise me.”</p><p>     Nicholas’ eyebrows furrowed and he stilled between the king’s hands. He understandably did not seem to fathom what was said. “Wemmet,” he seemed to prod, his silver gaze remaining as piercing as the wind when they searched his face.</p><p>     For what, Ragnarok did not know.</p><p>     “<em>Wemmet</em>,” Nicholas urged, a hint of a whine in his voice. </p><p>     It took Ragnarok a few more moments to gather what Nicholas was meaning to say.</p><p>     “Yes.” His lips faintly curved up. “Well met.”</p><p>     As Prince Nicholas beamed at him and began babbling at him in the nonsensical way children do, Ragnarok silently made him an oath:</p><p>     <em>I will take care of you as your father never had, little prince. You will not enter your world without the proper knowledge and strength you need to rule it,</em></p><p align="right">

  <strong> <em> <u>Eight Years Later,</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>12 February 1990. </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>The sound of swords clanging against each other filled the air.</p><p>     “To your left!”</p><p>     An eleven-year-old Prince Nicholas faced his instructor, the Lord Commander Desmond, and blocked a blow that had been heading to the left of his abdomen. He groaned tightly as his sword – a small and nimble blade forged to be well balanced for his age – parried the sword of the older man.</p><p>     “Very good, Your Highness,” Edwin Desmond smirked.</p><p>     The Lord Commander was a man near forty years, tall and sturdily made. His features were sharp, brown eyes mirthful, with a newly clean-shaven face and short chestnut brown hair where some few strands of grey were beginning to lighten the colour. He normally styled it so it was slicked back, but it had become disheveled during the fight, falling into his eyes.</p><p>     Nicholas panted urgently from over-exertion, a layer of sweat coating his light skin, but through the exhaustion, he swelled with pride from the praise given to him by his mentor.</p><p>     Edwin paused for a few moments to give Nicholas a chance to catch his breath. He did not wait for long, though, as he rushed forward again. Nicholas snapped his attention to him and swiftly raised his weapon to meet the crashing of Edwin’s broad blade. From the block, Edwin quickly retreated slightly, only to return with several successive blows that Nicholas was forced to guard himself against.</p><p>     Years of being under Edwin Desmond’s tutelage taught Nicholas that the best way to learn any king of combat was through example and practice. And even though learning this way was tough, and Edwin was far from a gentle teacher, Nicholas had to admit that Edwin had a style to his training that was superior to all the other swordsmen who taught him.</p><p>     Nicholas dodged the upward swing of his mentor by twisting himself away from its blow as the sword barely missed him. He then turned back to the older wizard and decided to take the chance to begin his own assault.</p><p>     Long ago, Nicholas was told his strength lied in his agility, the nimbleness of his feet allowing him to move rapidly whilst avoiding any kind of attack which could harm him. He had worked out that his speed could also be used in an offensive manner if he had the right opening to attack.</p><p>     Darting at Edwin, Nicholas parried several more swipes of his sword. The ringing of steel against steel became louder as the blows increased in strength from the close-combat that the two were engaged in. Biding his time, Nicholas began to see a pattern in Edwin’s fighting.</p><p>     Upon observing Edwin’s sword heading towards the side of his arm, Nicholas finally saw his opening. Quick as a whip, Nicholas ducked under the swing of Edwin’s blade and took two steps to shift behind the older man. He then swiftly kicked the back of Edwin’s knee so he was forced to kneel. Once his mentor was downed, Nicholas pressed the point of his sword on the back of Edwin’s neck.</p><p>     “Yield,” Nicholas commanded.</p><p>     There was a grin in his voice as Edwin replied between a breath, “I yield – I yield.”</p><p>     Nicholas lowered his blade instantly, watching as Edwin stood and stashed his blade away in its sheath, found on the wide, silver-buckled belt around his hips, the metal making a sharp <em>hisssss</em> as it lowered into its casing. His armour was a steel plate of silver, inlaid at the chest with the sigil of the Druid Union – a sprawled phoenix with a sword rising from between its wings.</p><p>     “You have improved immensely, Nicholas,” Edwin praised happily.</p><p>     Nicholas smiled. “Thank you, Edwin.”</p><p>     He watched as Edwin went over to pick up their things to the side of the field they had chosen to battle in, all the while unhooking his armour and packing it away. “I was told the king wants to see you after this session was complete,” said Edwin. “Go on and clean up before presenting yourself.”</p><p>     Nicholas furrowed his dark brows, confused. He turned his head and eyed the clock tower in the village a few leagues away. “But there is still an hour left of this session.”</p><p>     “I’m glad that you’re so eager to learn, but it is your birthday today,” Edwin told him. “You need to seize it, Nicholas, you won’t always be eleven. Which reminds me –” He reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out a small box, wandlessly enlarging it. “My dear wife and I wanted you to have this.”</p><p>     Nicholas beamed excitedly, laying down his sword (as he was taught to do when not using it) before accepting the present. “May I open it?”</p><p>     “Of course!” Edwin laughed. “Else I’m sure Jane will commit regicide.”</p><p>     The prince ripped through the layers of wrapping paper until he had his hands on the actual thin box. He pulled the lid off and saw that he was given a book: the first volume of the World’s Most Renowned Piano Pieces. Nicholas gasped, widening his eyes, and sharply turning them to Edwin. “Will Jane teach me?” he asked hopefully.</p><p>     Ever since Nicholas first visited the Lord Commander’s home, when he was seven, and heard the beautiful melodies humming out from Jane Desmond’s piano and echoing throughout the house, he had asked and pleaded and begged her to teach him how to play. She had refused him, not because she was cruel, but simply because she did not think she was good enough to teach him. Meanwhile, Nicholas put his foot down and stubbornly refused to be taught by anyone other than her.</p><p>     “Yes,” Edwin answered, laughing again and fondly tousling Nicholas’ ebony hair. “King Ragnarok has permitted Jane to come here every Monday to teach you.”</p><p>     Nicholas whooped and embraced Edwin, delighted. “Thank you!” he gushed enthusiastically. “I promise I will learn to play just like her. She will never regret giving me lessons.”</p><p>     “You won’t learn anything if you’re late to see the king,” Edwin warned amusedly, bending to pick up the boy’s thin blade and handing it over to him, hilt first.</p><p>     Nicholas beamed, and took it from his mentor, balancing his new book in one of his hands whilst using the other to sheath his sword. “Will you be back tomorrow?”</p><p>     “I should think so,” said Edwin, smiling.</p><p>   With one last grin thrown at the older man, Nicholas rushed back to the palace. They normally sparred in the Palace Gardens just outside the main manor, so he did not have to sprint far, and he reached the home he shared with his guardian within two minutes.</p><p>     It had been eight years since King Ragnarok had adopted him and, while many of the details of that day had been kept from him, like who is father – his real father – was, Nicholas still held onto the hope of one day knowing the truth about it all. After all, Ragnarok himself had vowed to tell him once he thought he was old enough. His time with the Goblins had been fraught with hardships, as many Goblins did not seem to like him for reasons unknown to him, but he had managed . . . with the support of the king, of course.</p><p>     He ran past the many serving elves going about their daily routines around the palace, heading straight for his bedchamber on the first floor. Nicholas tore off his sweat-stained tunic and padded fencing pants just as he entered his room, throwing them into the laundry basket that Hodrey – Nicholas’ personal manservant – had angrily instructed him to place his dirty clothes, and darted straight into his bathroom to shower.</p><p>     King Ragnarok never like tardiness.</p><p>     When Nicholas stepped out of the shower, he dressed into one of the clean white tunics hung in his wardrobe as well as a pair of black breeches that he wore with his riding boots. He did not bother to dry his hair since Ragnarok did not care whether it was wet or dry so much as he did when it was dirty or clean, so Nicholas hurried out of his bedchamber and walked briskly over to Ragnarok’s study which, thankfully, was only down the hallway.</p><p>     Nicholas stood outside the doors for a moment, composing his breathing. Only once it had slowed did he push the large double oak doors to reveal Ragnarok along with, surprisingly, Edwin who stood in front of the king’s desk with his hands clutched behind him.</p><p>     Both occupants turned their attention to the newcomer.</p><p>     “Ah!” Edwin exclaimed. “There he is.”</p><p>     Nicholas stepped into the room and moved to stand beside Edwin, bowing his back in respect to King Ragnarok. “Well met, Your Grace,” he greeted respectfully.</p><p>     Ragnarok growled jovially, bowing his head in return. “Well met, Your Highness.”</p><p>     The greeting was typical of two royals meeting one another, traditional for the Goblins, and Ragnarok had drilled this greeting into Nicholas since the boy was old enough to form complete sentences.</p><p>     “With respect,” said Nicholas, turning to Edwin. “You were supposed to be making your way to Germany, were you not? I had thought there was some dispute from the western magicals.”</p><p>     “There are many issues regarding the reunification of the East and West, but most of the threat had been handled yesterday,” Edwin told him. “Knight Commander Mason had just informed me she was able to track down where most of the escapees had hidden after the raid we performed. The official reunification of Germany should be taking place later this year, as planned.”</p><p>     Ragnarok spoke curiously, “The escapees . . . are they Grindelwald sympathisers?”</p><p>     Nicholas, too, was interested in the people who were leading the Western Allies to believe it would be too dangerous to allow two sides of a country the chance of resolution.</p><p>     “Most likely, Your Grace,” Edwin replied. “We shall find out from the interrogations when they are found.”</p><p>     “Keep me posted, Lord Commander,” Ragnarok said, thinking. “There have not been any large fluctuations or familiar patterns in the daily finances of any members of the old magical families, therefore I do not believe these criminals have been conspiring like they had been in wars previous.”</p><p>     “This is promising news,” said Edwin, nodding. “Nevertheless, I will push for probing for co-conspirators. While these people may not be Death Eaters or Grindelwald’s lackeys, I must ensure that they are not acting in some other organisation.”</p><p>     "Very good," Ragnarok settled. "Now, Lord Commander, I called you here today on less urgent business. I want you to act as an advisor." He reached across his desk and picked up an envelope, holding it up towards Nicholas. "This is addressed to you, Nicholas. It came while you were training."</p><p>      Nicholas stood frozen at the sudden switch, then took a few steps forward, grabbing the letter in his guardian’s hand. He looked at the front of the envelope and saw that it was indeed addressed to him. He turned it over to the back where an ancient crest carrying the symbols of a lion, eagle, badger, and snake was presented in the wax seal – meaning it could only be one thing.</p><p>     “My Hogwarts letter,” he whispered. “It actually came.”</p><p>     “Open it, little prince,” Ragnarok urged.</p><p>     Nicholas did so with shaking hands. This was turning out to be one of the few events in his life that are normal, and he treasured it. He unfolded the parchment and began to read:</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Nicholas turned the page and found the aforementioned list of school supplies compulsory for a first-year. His stomach shifted uneasily in apprehension, yet the butterflies excitedly fluttering inside did not seem to be stopping anytime soon. He had been accepted into the school he had been fantasising about for as long as he had known about its existence.</p><p>     A sinking feeling took over when he recalled what Ragnarok said before.</p><p>     “Who is Edwin here to advise?” Nicholas asked anxiously, gripping onto the letter a little bit tighter.</p><p>     “You, Nicholas,” Ragnarok said cautiously. “I need you to consider everything before you make up your mind about attending Hogwarts.”</p><p>     Warily, Nicholas claimed, "Surely there is not a lot I don’t already know."  </p><p>     Ragnarok gazed at him, wearing the most expressive look he had ever seen on his face, filled with regret and sadness and pity, and Nicholas felt small.</p><p>     “What I am about to say cannot leave this room,” Ragnarok told them. “There is only one other who knows the whole truth, and that is Rockstooth. You will both understand the need for secrecy once I tell you everything.”</p><p>     Edwin’s face instantly hardened, and Nicholas could see this was not the first time the Lord Commander was asked to keep secrets.</p><p>     “Do you require an oath, Your Grace?”</p><p>     “I would prefer it,” Ragnarok responded, opening a drawer to the left of him and pulling out a single folded piece of parchment. “I had one written for you beforehand should you have offered.”</p><p>     Edwin accepted and read through the vow, nodding in acceptance of its wording. He then pulled out his wand – thirteen and a half inches of Cypress with a Phoenix Feather core – from the holster on his arm, starting his oath, "I, Lord Commander Edwin Charles Desmond, swear on my body, mind, and magic, to keep all secrets disclosed to me by King Ragnarok III, and only discuss them with those that are confirmed to have the knowledge imparted to me, or until such a time where he permits me otherwise."</p><p>     Nicholas watched as a soft blue glow encompassed Edwin before fading away.</p><p>     “Nicholas,” Ragnarok called for his attention. “You will not be required to make a vow, but I need to know if you understand how important it is to keep this secret from everyone that is not me, the Lord Commander, or Rockstooth.” </p><p>     He slowly gave a nod of understanding.</p><p>     Ragnarok visible exhaled a long breath in the silence that took over, and Nicholas fearfully questioned why he seemed so guilty when he looked into his eyes.</p><p>     Little did Nicholas know that Ragnarok was thinking about how those young boy’s silver eyes would never hold the same naivety – the same innocence – after he left his room.</p><p>     “There was a prophecy made,” Ragnarok told them, “before Nicholas was born . . .” He poured out all his knowledge and theories out onto the two humans in front of him and struggled to keep his emotions in check. It was not fair for the boy to know all of this, to know of the darkness in this world at such a young age. It was not fair that it had to be Ragnarok imparting this information to the boy, stripping him of his childhood with one fell swoop, just so he could understand why it would be best for him to be tutored privately. It was not fair that Nicholas should be snatched of his dreams just because the greater good demanded it.</p><p>     It was simply <em>not fair</em>.</p><p>     Edwin mulled over King Ragnarok’s words, sitting in the chair he had conjured for himself while the king still told his story. “There will be another Dark Lord?”</p><p>     Ragnarok shook his head. “It is not likely to be a new Dark Lord. Nicholas was established as the Prince of the Prophecy at the time when Lord Voldemort was still at large. Also, Harry Potter was recognised as Saviour when Voldemort reportedly marked him with a scar on the night of his parents’ deaths.”</p><p>     “What of the – uh – the Lioness, was it?” Edwin asked unsurely.</p><p>     “Yes, the Lioness,” Ragnarok confirmed.</p><p>     “Do you know who she is?”</p><p>     “No, I do not,” said Ragnarok. “She is the only figure that remains in the shadows.”</p><p>      Nicholas swallowed down the lump in his throat, blinking back his tears. He lifted his head up from where it had dropped to dejectedly face the ground. His voice was small as he asked, “What does it mean by our souls being bound by fate?”</p><p>      Ragnarok avoided the prince’s gaze. “I believe it describes what is called a soul-bond by wizards. This is something that occurs when two magical beings are recognised upon birth by the Earth’s Core Magic as being perfectly compatible for one another in mind, body, and magic. The deep magic running throughout the Earth then binds these individuals together so they are always led to each other, and incomplete without the other. From what I have read over the years, the process of discovering the other could take as little as a few months from the day of birth, to even decades. Nonetheless, I have faith we shall know who she is quite soon. A young girl that is a sovereign in magic is not easy to keep hidden.”</p><p>     Edwin furrowed his eyebrows, murmuring to himself, “Sovereign in magic. A powerful girl?”</p><p>     “You have suspicions, Lord Commander,” Ragnarok recognised interestedly.</p><p>     “A hunch, Your Grace,” Edwin said slowly. “I met a remarkable girl five years ago. She had a great burst of accidental magic – none like I had ever seen. Her anguish had begun to leak into her surrounding environment, swirling the strongest of winds around her that only seemed to get stronger as the minutes passed. It took a great deal to calm her.”</p><p>     Nicholas frowned, as his own accidental bouts of magic had never surpassed a silent and wandless knockback jinx, from a fit of rage a few years ago. “Why was she so sad?”</p><p>     “She was . . .” Edwin hesitated. “She was forsaken by someone who should have cared deeply for her.”</p><p>     “She was born in the mundane world,” Ragnarok guessed.</p><p>     Edwin nodded.</p><p>     “I had expected as much,” the king went on. “The old pure-blood families scarcely have magical ability past the bare minimum. Fresh blood has the most power.”</p><p>     The Lord Commander hummed in agreement. “I’ve been keeping watch over her at a distance. She is due to get her own Hogwarts letter in September if I recall correctly. Still, I’ll push for the Druid Union to send her our own offer on my own personal recommendation. I would feel better knowing that she’d be attending my Institute.”</p><p>     Nicholas measured their words despondently. “There is a chance she will be in Hogwarts with me?”</p><p>     Ragnarok sighed. “Apparently so, little prince. Yet –” He stepped off of his desk and walked over to Nicholas, coming to stand in front of him, “I think you have realised why you are likely not going to attend Hogwarts.”</p><p>     “I am the Prince who will be King from the Prophecy,” said Nicholas, nearly diplomatically, but the shine in his metallic eyes gave away more of his emotion than he had wanted. “And Hogwarts . . . Hogwarts cannot teach me to be King.”</p><p>     Ragnarok lowered his head, incapable of finding the words to comfort him.</p><p>     Edwin spoke at that moment, “There are many reasons why you should not go, Your Highness, but you’ve hit the nail on the head. Hogwarts is too plagued with texts and instructors with extreme bias not befitting the education of someone who will, one day, be the country’s impartial head of government. Hogwarts would simply be a waste of time that is already too sparse for you.”</p><p>     A tear rolled down Nicholas’ cheek. “So am I to just wait until the Dark Lord returns?”</p><p>     “Yes,” Ragnarok rumbled, sharing his grief and anger.</p><p>     The years that followed were the longest Nicholas had even known. He learned, and trained, and learned, and trained, over and over again, repeating the same routine day in and day out, until . . .</p><p align="right">Nicholas’ eyes finally chanced upon those of the Lioness, and the years fell away from his thoughts like leaves in autumn.</p><p align="right"> </p><p> </p>
