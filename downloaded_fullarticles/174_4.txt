          <div class="userstuff"><p>1997- <br/>The Death Eater stares at his surroundings. Wonders how he got to where he is now. He wonders how he got to be sitting outside the dark, dank cell, waiting for the order to drag the unfortunate person inside out to their death. <br/> He sits and contemplates whilst gazing upon the damp on the walls. His eyes follow a drop of murky water trickling down towards the puddle on the floor. It is so dark that his squinting makes the water look like blood. Rather apt for the cells, he thinks. Then scoffs. He’d never stoop so low as to draw blood from his prisoners. He prefers to torture their minds now- much cleaner. Less plebeian. Less before. Less Muggle. The water remains clean and untainted from something so vile.<br/>The Death Eater’s wand dangles loosely in his hand. He twirls it around and laughs as the prisoner’s eyes follow it nervously. Their body tenses in anticipation but he decides it’s too much effort to cast anything and closes his eyes.<br/>He falls asleep to the sound of soft sobs echoing around the room and still wondering why he ended up here.<br/>___<br/>1976- Before<br/>The boy was walking down the corridor when someone fell into step beside him. He turned and was met with soft brown eyes and a riot of blonde curls staring intensely at him.<br/>“Yes?” He said curtly. The brown eyes’ gaze faltered for a second. The boy felt a twinge of guilt so tried to twist his expression into a soft smile. It came across more as a grimace than anything, but the brown eyes were happy again and that’s all that mattered.<br/>___<br/>His parents were arguing. Their shouts ricocheted around their dining room, but the boy didn’t care. He carried on eating and thought wistfully about going back to school. He thought of the Slytherin dorms where he often laughed so hard that his stomach hurt. <br/>He was dragged out if his reverie by his mother’s shrill voice. She screeched at him to get his elbows off the table and that was all that was needed to set his father off. <br/>Later that night the boy lay there wondering if what his father said was true. Maybe he was to blame for the family’s troubles. If only he was more normal, smarter, more like his brother then he wouldn’t be such a disappointment to his family. He really was a waste of space.<br/>___<br/>A soft hand slid into his under the table of the sixth year Slytherins train compartment. It was snowing outside but the windows had fogged up. They were all crammed in together, jostling about as they regaled each other with raucous tales of their Christmas holidays. The brown eyed boy was practically in his lap at this point. He didn’t mind. <br/>It was times like these when the boy could forget about everything else. He was surrounded by laughing faces, could taste the butter beer on his tongue, could smell the mash up of everyone’s colognes, could hear the rhythmic clatter of the trains tracks and feel a clammy hand squeezing his own. Bliss.<br/>___<br/>The older years ranted in front of the fire. They riled the younger ones up as they shouted reverently about the Dark Lord and how he was going to save their world from the muggles and the mudbloods. They cherished the name that they spoke and worshiped his actions. The boy listened and drank in the words. The Dark Lord would make the world a better place. He was sure of it. The blonde-haired boy beside him tutted at their words and scoffed.<br/>___<br/>The ride home from the station was spent in stony silence. He sat next to his mother and tried to appear sympathetic at the sound of her sobs. <br/>He was putting his bags away for the summer when his mother called him down for afternoon tea. It was a custom that had been endured every summer since first year, despite his father’s attempts to deafen him with his incessant shouting. The empty place next to his mother was glaringly obvious, as well as the deafening silence. His mother’s fork clattered down onto the floor as she swung round to look at him with piercing blue eyes. <br/>“This is your fault,” she hissed, rage simmering and boiling within the deep blue sea. “If it weren’t for you, he’d still be here.” She meant to say- he wouldn’t be off galivanting with some young pretty thing without his wedding ring- but the boy thought that it wouldn’t be a good time to correct her.<br/>“I wish you were never born.” The boy flinched. Placed his fork on the table. Stood up. Walked to his room. <br/>___<br/>September couldn’t come quick enough. A sob escaped his lips as he caught sight of blonde curls. They stood in the toilet cubicle together, just leaning against each other for comfort. The boy’s worries drained away at the sound of the other’s steady heartbeat and vanished completely when their lips pressed together.<br/>___<br/>In hindsight, he should have known. He should have known that they couldn’t go this far without being caught- they were reckless, and they shouldn’t have been. This knowledge didn’t comfort him in any way. The Gryffindor’s voice still echoed through his mind. It had wrenched him from the safe security of blonde hair, brown eyes and warm lips.<br/>“Faggot.” She had called out. That one word had dragged him down to depths he hadn’t known were possible. She had wrenched his heart out of his chest. <br/>The boy paced a hole in the carpet and tried to wave away reason.<br/>The other tried to comfort him- “It doesn’t matter and why can’t people know about us and it’s nothing to be ashamed of and it really doesn’t ma-.”<br/>“It doesn’t matter,” the boy growled incredulously. He stared at the blonde boy and ran his hand through his hair in distress. Reaching out a sympathetic hand to him, the blonde boy smiled hesitantly.<br/>The boy recoiled and stormed out of the door.<br/>___<br/>He ran down the corridor and up the stairs and behind a portrait. He emerged next to the Gryffindor’s portrait hole. <br/>He stood in an alcove and prepared to wait.<br/> He murmured the spell to himself, double checking that he hadn’t forgotten what he’d read in his new dark art’s book. <br/>He heard footsteps and a familiar high voice- the same one that had ripped his life into pieces. As she came into view with a friend, he flung out a spell and watched as her bag split open, its contents spilling everywhere. She bent down to pick it up and waved her friend on through the to their common room. He took a breath and hissed his spell at her whilst she crouched on the floor. <br/>The boy watched with a morbid fascination as her tongue wrenched itself out of her mouth. He watched as she screamed but no sound came out. He watched as she writhed around on the floor, clawing at her mouth. He reached up and caught her tongue when it came flying through the air towards him. <br/>The boy turned around and went back to the dorms.<br/>___<br/>The blonde hair boy stared at him sadly. He pulled the still warm tongue from his hands and threw it to the floor, holding back a shudder. He took him into his arms, and they stood there. Pressed together so close they were almost one person.<br/>___<br/>“I know it was you,” one of his year mates said to him during breakfast.<br/>“What was?” he inquired. He had gone very still. <br/>“You know,” the boy continued, licking his lips nervously. “That girl whose tongue was ripped out. I saw you go into the dorms holding it.” <br/>“What’s it to you?” <br/>“It’s just, I- no we,” here he gestured to other boys and girls in their year,” know someone who was impressed by you. He wants to meet you- to help you. He will teach you to not leave any witnesses and to finish the job. You just have to help him in return.”<br/>The boy glanced over guiltily at the blonde boy bent over his breakfast and nodded. <br/>___<br/>They sat staring at each other on opposite sides of the bed.<br/>“Why would you do that?” the other to him quietly. He’d just got back from his meeting and could only see stars and hope.<br/>“He can help us. He truly wants to help. He’s just a man who wants to make our world a better place. Don’t you want that? He wants to get rid of the muggles and mudbloods who just interfere and ruin things. He wants to destroy prejudice and make all of us equal. He can help us be together and destroy anyone who has any objection to that. To us. Why do you such a big problem against the Dark Lord?” <br/>The other boy’s eyes shimmered with tears as he got up and ran out if the door. He turned back and there was such hatred and disgust in his brown eyes that the boy recoiled. He opened his mouth as if to say something but closed it again. He shut the door behind him.<br/>The boy stood there, unsure of what he had done wrong. He gripped his forearm and winced at the burn. He peeled back his sleeve and gazed at the mark. He was so sure that he’s done the right thing.<br/>___<br/>1997- After<br/>The Death Eater awoke with a start. He shakes his head.<br/>He stands up and strolls over to the occupied cell. His mark begins to burn so he wrenches the doors open and drags the prisoner up. He yanks him up the stairs and into the hall. After throwing the prisoner down in front of the Dark Lord he goes and takes his place in the lines of Death Eaters. All their faces are obscured by masks that flash green momentarily.  <br/>They are all faceless. Nameless. Their identities are lost. <br/>There is no point in remembering the past, the Death Eater thinks. Look where it has got him. </p></div>
