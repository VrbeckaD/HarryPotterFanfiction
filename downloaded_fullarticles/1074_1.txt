          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify"><span>Dakota</span> <span>stares down at his food in apparent disgust. He couldn’t help but push it away and allow the boy next to him to gobble up what he hadn’t eaten—it is safe to say he hadn’t eaten a thing. It isn’t as if his stomach isn’t used to the gnawing numbness, so it made no difference.</span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Ever since their memories had resurfaced. Dakota couldn’t help but feel terminally angry. At whom, he isn’t so sure of. His mind latched onto the easiest prey he could, and that so happened to be Willow. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   In the pit of his heart, he couldn’t help the guilt that pooled his chest when Willow glanced up with worry-filled eyes and he would scowl, sneer or glare at her—as if all of this was her fault and not Stylan’s. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>   (none of this is her fault, nor is it stylan’s)</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota knows he’s being petty, but he can’t help it. An urge to strike is from the bear within him, and him striking at Stylan will do nothing to her. Nor will it affect anyone else other than … well, Willow. Admittedly, he believed she was the only one who vaguely cared for him. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>   (funny though, huh? to be cared about?)</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>   </span>
  </em>
  <span>Dakota growled and curled his fingers into a small fist. He stood up from the table of green and made his way from the hall. It was nearly lesson time, and he had somewhere better to be. Such as the Astronomy Tower. Perhaps the Owlery? Some of the owls seemed to like his company, if only for him to stroke them and smother them with treats. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He felt someone following behind him, and it didn’t take a genius to know who it was. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Stopping abruptly and turning around made the she-hybrids face burn with something Dakota cannot quite place. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “What do you want?” he snarled at her. The guilt was there, and he pushed it down. The anger was more prominent. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow has nothing to say. Dakota didn’t think she would have. After all, this is partly her fault. If her elemental power was so almighty and godly, why did he have to go through the abuse he endured for too long over and over again? Will this be happening every time they search for the element? Or will he have to relive those memories whilst also knowing he could easily escape if he wanted to? </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “It’s not lesson time yet—”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “And your point is?” Dakota cut her off, crossing his shaking hands over his chest. He was cold and he would rather get to Charms class where it was nice and warm earlier rather than later. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Come eat something,” Willow says a little desperately. It wasn’t enough to have Dakota feel sorry for her attempt at making him eat. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “I’m not hungry.” Dakota was still glaring at her; how had he not scared her off yet?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow huffs. “It doesn’t matter. You can’t avoid food just because you feel like it. But … I’m not gonna force you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Well, fuck off, then.” Dakota didn’t wait for a reaction. If she wanted to run after him, then she is free to do so. But she never did. Dakota cannot decide whether or not he feels relieved or sad. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   More often than not, Dakota ends up in the Room of Requirement. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He discovered it before Harry Potter had. Back in his first year (which was only last year) he found it after some late hours in the library and Madam Pince had kicked him out for being in there so late. He wasn’t exactly doing any work, because that wasn’t his go-to. Rather, he was hanging around to pass the time as quickly as possible. He never did sleep, and the thought of staying wide-awake in his dorm rooms bored him to death. Not to mention that the bed he was made to sleep in was too comfortable and too wide for him. No matter how many pillows he tried placing around his body, it wasn’t enough—he needed living, body warmth pillowing him. At least in the library, he could entertain himself by using invisible ink in the library books. And if that wasn’t enough, he would sit there, watching as the flames flickered on and off with the flick of his wand. Sadly, this is all the entertainment he would get. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   However, his Room of Requirement may not be a whole bundle of joy for him (as Dakota isn’t sure </span>
  <em>
    <span>what </span>
  </em>
  <span>he enjoys) but it gives him a place to settle and release his tension. He thinks having to walk around with his head held high and shoulders squared placed pressure on his normally curled and tiny body. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He never did go home during the holidays, but he would never escape them in the summer. He feels as if he’s more used to the ghostly touches of his mother’s finger’s that have him flinching more than he is rather than the apparent comfort that Hogwarts can offer him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The thought had him frowning as he settled down on the carpeted floor that the Room of Requirement provided for him. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Its carpet was a soft beige colour, fluffy and soft between his dainty fingers. Sofas were provided, yet Dakota settles himself down on the floor every time if it means to avoid the softness of the plush sofas. The Room still made an effort, and he somewhat appreciated it. But it was too comfortable, so it wasn’t worth the bother. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The walls were light blue, but the white lights were dimmed so it gave warmth to it. A fireplace he has never lit stays cold and unused in the corner. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   That was one thing he liked about the Slytherin dungeons—they were cold and damp. It had its familiar homey feel to it. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota never bothered with anything in this room apart from the quiet it brought him. He wouldn’t say his home had a peace about it, but there was a lot of silence on his part. He would sometimes lie on the floor, watching his parents intently before they devoted their attention to him. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   It was in these rare moments that Dakota felt a little homesick. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He knows what his parents are and he knows what they are like. He knows for a fact that what they are doing is wrong. But it’s something he had grown up with, and it was once all he knew until he met Richie Davies. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Tears stung his eyes as he thought about the triplets and their parents. He was ignoring them as well. They sent him letters a couple of days ago during breakfast. He had made brief eye-contact with Richie, eyes filtering to Melanie and then to Eddie from the Hufflepuff table before he stuffed them in his pocket and threw them into the fire later that same evening. He hadn’t even looked at them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He sniffed miserably, wiping stubbornly at his eyes as he shivered from the bitter cold, pulling his sweater around his body more. It was one of triplets, one he had snuck from the Gryffindor tower from either Richie or Melanie. He wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted it back from him; he’s not exactly the cleanest of people to be handing something to rich and pristine. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He sniffed again, growling at himself. “Stop crying…” His body complied to the low threat. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Other things helped as well. Willow is a thing; </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>who cares. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The thought terrifies him. Because his mother says she cares.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The next day remains the same. Willow approaches him, he doesn’t say anything and runs off.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He skips all of his classes that day with no shame, spending his time by the Black Lake, drawing patterns into the dirt from where he continued to rip at the luscious grass. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He isn’t surprised when his Head of House, Professor Snape, calls him in. Dakota doesn’t go when Professor McGonagall gives him an earful about missing Transfiguration and to, “See Professor Snape as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The next day he runs into Willow again. He skips his first two lessons and goes to his third, fourth and fifth. He didn’t have dinner, nor did he sleep in his dorm s and stayed in the Room of Requirement, using Sharpies to vandalize the walls that no one else is going to see. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   When day four stretches around the corner, it was a normal Saturday. Despite not having dinner the night before, he pretends the gnawing in his stomach is an irritable bug in excuse to not eat breakfast. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He doesn’t see Willow that day. Nor the next.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   It is then, when Monday afternoon rolled around the corner and everyone was eating their lunch, he began to feel—dare he say—lonely. He felt lonely in the first year, but it was different. Because he didn’t have any friends in the first year until midterm when the triplets approached him. When </span>
  <em>
    <span>Willow</span>
  </em>
  <span> approached him. They may have been older, but they provided him with friendship. It made him feel a little less sad. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   No one was sitting next to him. Perhaps that was because he was digging his knife into the table and writing how much he hated school. Which wasn’t true. He did like Hogwarts. But it was no use in even vandalising the products because Dumbledore would have no trouble magicking it away. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Students were looking at him weirdly, and it isn’t as if he isn’t aware of what he’s doing. He’s just getting that sort of sick pleasure from ruining things so pure and </span>
  <em>
    <span>clean. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He wasn’t pure and clean, so why should everything else be?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Dakota.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   The boy jumps, the knife dropping from his hold. He already knew who it was; soft and gentle. A tone he’s only ever heard when she’s speaking with ones in need of help, or especially for him. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “What?” He picks up the knife again. Before he can wound the table further, the knife plucked from his calloused hands. He sighed and feigned a grin as he turned to Willow. “Can I have that back?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow frowned in disapproval. “Don’t vandalise the school.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota huffed, turning back around and lying his chin on his crossed arms over the table. “One of the professor’s can just magic it back. Why the fuck should I care.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He felt her move beside him, making sure to keep a fair distance. He shuffled sideways just to be on the safe side. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Can you at least eat something?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota shook his head. “‘M not hungry.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “That’s not good enough.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “It’s good enough for me,” Dakota growled low in his throat, fangs digging into his bottom lip. If he made them bleed he doesn’t notice. But Willow does.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “C’mon, bear, come here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota swallowed. He wanted to cry and scream at her to leave him alone. He had the right mind to do so, but he hasn’t the heart. It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Willow</span>
  </em>
  <span> after all. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Reluctantly, he sat up and Willow reached forward with a tissue to gently wipe at his bottom lip. He winced, but not at the pain. Perhaps he was expecting the pain to come. With Willow, it never did. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   When she pulled the tissue away, she glanced at Dakota with a thoughtful frown on her face. Dakota looked away with a flush. He hated it when people analysed him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Hey…”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Silence. It was like an elephant was sitting in between them. It was quiet and heavy. It settled like weights of 40kg on his shoulders; all he could do was hide his face in his arms. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Talk to me. Do you wanna go somewhere?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota shook his head. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “You’re gonna have to say something eventually. It’ll only get lonelier.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “And who said I was lonely?” came his muffled reply.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   There was a sigh. “It doesn’t matter, Dakota. I say we meet somewhere. Room of Requirement at 5? It’s the only privacy we get nowadays.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota hummed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Eat—</span>
  </em>
  <span>eat something that doesn’t involve a knife.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota laughed, taking his face from his arms as he watched the she-hybrid stand from the bench. “What? You scared I’m gonna slit my wrists?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Stop it, Dakota. That’s not funny.” Willow was glaring now.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “When I wished for a new mother, I didn’t mean one like you, for fucks sake.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   It was a low-blow, even he knows that. And he pretends not to see the hurt behind Willow’s eyes before she was walking calmly back to the Ravenclaw table. He watched as Hunter ushers her down, speaking to her in a hushed voice before lacing his fingers with her. Dakota looked away to his food. And decided he wasn’t going to eat it. Fuck what Willow thought—she’s not his mother. And she never will be.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   By the time five flashed in front of the Tempa charm Dakota cast in his room, he got up from his bed and made his way to his and Willow’s meeting place. She wasn’t there, but he could only guess she was already inside. He was late by ten minutes, Willow likes to be on time. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   As he entered the room, it seemed only a little bit different to the one he normally visualises for the room. It was painted with duck egg coloured walls (a colour Dakota finds hideous but Willow has a passion for so he guesses—without admitting so—that he tolerates it) with leather, cream sofas and cushions. It had a plain mattress on the ground where Willow was sitting with a soft look in her eyes; warm and inviting. When was the last time Dakota got to hug Willow? He hadn’t seen her for the better part of eleven years before he found her in his first year. But he hadn’t remembered her then. So it technically did not count. But it did, it had been well over eleven years. He doesn’t take kindly to physical affection after all.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Still don’t understand why you like this colour,” Dakota comments teasingly as he lets his fingers trail across the smooth painted walls.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow only rolls her eyes in response. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota doesn’t end up sitting on the mattress with her, preferring the plush, beige coloured carpet that was provided. He made sure to keep his distance. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “So…” said Dakota.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow nodded. The smile on her face was gentle. “A needle pulling thread.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Why did I guess you were about to say that?” The both of them giggled. He wasn’t in a bad mood like he had been this morning, so the thought of joking around with Willow all evening had him on the end of his happy line. He knew it wouldn’t continue for long, but he had to make the most of the situation. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> predictable.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “I mean, you kinda are.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Willow let her head hang for a second before she looked back up. “I’m not here to lecture you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota’s smile faltered. “I know…” He didn’t want to snap at her like he had been this whole time. In the past when he’s been so angry, Willow has allowed him to cool off before approaching him. She just did it at the wrong time on the first day they got their memories back. He hadn’t meant to—it’s Willow—but he couldn’t help but blame </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> for what happened. She should have been there and she should have dragged him out of that situation she’s again, as should the triplets. He can’t even begin to comprehend why he had blamed Willow in the first place. It wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> him who had his memories wiped. Not only that, but it was Richie who had taken him away. If anything, he should have blamed Richie. However, in the back of his mind, he knows why he blamed Willow. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Richie was kind because he had seen a boy—homeless—had picked up his pieces until he brought him home. It was almost out of force. Whereas Willow approached him in the first year, where he was clean, shy, and jerked at every movement anyone seemed to make at him. It seems as if once he becomes friendly with someone, he becomes this over-confident, loud-mouthed little brat. No wonder he couldn’t make any decent friends in his first year. If it hadn’t of been for Willow, he would have been more alone in the first and half of his second year. They only would have found him when their memories resurfaced. Cody was also kind, but he just couldn’t connect with her as much as he did with Willow and the triplets. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “I don’t know whether I should apologise for not … noticing sooner,” says Willow. Dakota felt guilt gnaw at his chest. He was too much of a coward to say anything. “Perhaps I should have. Even if my memories were not present, I can’t believe I let it go over my head.” </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota shrugged. “Yeah, well, shit happens.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “That’s not the point, Dakota.” Willow shook her head, eyes downcast and sad. “I’m sorry for not noticing before. I should have been there for you, and I wasn’t. However, I can’t help the fact that I lose my memories. None of us could; not even Sorah. Blaming it on me isn’t going to get you anywhere.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota swallowed, his cheeks burning in shame. Hearing it from Willow rather than his own thoughts brought out the guilt he should have been feeling a few days ago. Subconsciously, he never did blame Willow. It was just so easier to.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “You won’t be going back there,” Willow continues. “The triplets won’t let you go back there. And neither will their parents. You know they won’t.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota nodded his head, wiping at his eyes that were starting to tear up again. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Are you okay, now?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   He nodded again. He embarrassingly enough accidentally let out a whimper. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “Hey … I’m not gonna force you, but I’m open arms here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Dakota looked up to find Willow’s arms in a welcoming gesture. He couldn’t help but choke on a sob as he gradually crawls over, letting himself be enclosed by the warmth of the she-hybrids arms. He was half on her lap by the time he buried his face by her shoulder, sniffling miserably and hands shaking as he held them tightly against his chest. He couldn’t bring himself to hug her back but having her arms around was enough to ground him. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   Her touches were gentle but so different from his mothers’.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “You’re not my mother,” he mumbled. He closed his eyes. The tears never came, but he could allow himself to feel the protection Willow provided. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>   “I know,” says Willow, her hand running through his unruly hair. “And I’m fucking glad I’m not.”</span>
