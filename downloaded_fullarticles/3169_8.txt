  <strong>
    <u>2:26 am. Major Investigation Department, MACUSA. Approximately 1.5 hours after the escape of Gellert Grindelwald from ICW custody.</u>
  </strong>
</p><p>For some time, nobody spoke. The silence, heavy and brittle, was broken only by the muted clatter of typewriters, and the scratching of quills. With nothing else to do, Tina simply kept typing, more and more until her fingers were stiff and aching, filling sheet after sheet with every minute detail she could remember. Watching through rain and glass as the carriage departed; the bizarrely normal-feeling twenty minutes, before the air was shattered by the first distress call... Then, suddenly, the room erupting into a confused mess of shouting and alarms and the CRACK-CRACK-CRACK of disapparition as she waited desperately to be given something to do, anything. And then flying, hurtling through the whirlwind of rain and cold, chasing the cluster of screaming, and dark fingers, and blinding white light; pushing against the wind and yelling and- her broom? The others? Herself?- to go faster, faster, it wasn't too late, they could still reach it-</p><p>The adrenaline in her body slowly replaced by the sickening, creeping knowledge that they would not, in fact, reach it-</p><p>The single, last glimpse of him, just before he disapparated- with a smaller, dark figure everyone was saying was Abernathy- looking into the wild eyes she'd thought were Percival Graves', his sunken face full of triumph and laughter...</p><p>When, at long last, she was sure there was nothing else she could write, she let herself crumple, resting her pounding head on the cold, smooth wood of her desk. She wasn't sure what she'd rather do: fall asleep, here and now, or just curl up under the desk and cry. Nothing else- just cry. As if it could wash away this and everything else. Let it all out. Become empty.</p><p>Anything, though, was better than just sitting here. She felt like a solitary mourner, who'd somehow found herself attending a funeral for someone she'd barely even known. Well, she'd barely known Peters or Fontaine, and yet... the way Fontaine's body had looked, all twisted and crumpled... </p><p>Her desk was right in front of Tina's; there was a gilded photo frame on it, in pride of place. In it, she could see her baby daughter. She was sticking her tongue out, and laughing.</p><p> </p><p>At first, Tina didn't register the sound of the doors opening. She was too preoccupied, and sickened, by the thought of little Susanna Fontaine- happily frozen forever on a piece of card, not knowing that her mother was gone. She missed, too, the stillness that suddenly gripped Ranjit (who was closest to and had the best view of the doors). She only woke up when he hissed <em>"Guys- it's them"</em> and everyone- buoyed on by the glorious relief of finally doing something- filed into the spacious main office where President Picquery had just entered. Camila Marquez, former member of the Investigative Team and now Acting Director of Magical Security, followed quickly just behind her.</p><p>The President looked, from a distance, as regal and stately as always- but something of her usual icy composure had vanished. Her hands shook, ever so slightly, as she held them in front of her, and her breaths seemed shorter and less steady than before. Her voice, if ostensibly calm, was strangely hollow as she raised it to address the room.</p><p>"It seems inappropriate to say "Good evening", so I'll cut straight to it. Some of you will know already that a general warning has been circulated among the wizarding public, and that as soon as we adjourn I will be officially declaring a state of emergency within Manhattan." She paused, then went on: "As you will no doubt agree, the events of tonight have been both unexpected, and utterly devastating. For all of us." Her eyes swept the room and almost seemed to meet Tina's, but... no, she'd imagined it because she was exhausted, that was all.</p><p>"I am aware", Madame Picquery continued, "that most of us, myself included, are still... in the process of piecing together what-" she swallowed sharply. "What happened.</p><p>Rest assured, however, that you have all earned the gratitude of myself and our community, for what you have done- and continue to do- tonight. Every single person in this room, has surpassed expectations, and shown- incredible amounts of courage, discipline, and loyalty. And whatever happens next..." Her voice almost- almost- cracked, and Tina started a little; but the steely gaze did not waver. "Myself, and Ms Marquez, can give you no higher praise than that."</p><p>She nodded at Marquez, who stepped forward and spoke in her usual, brusque voice.</p><p>"Anyone here who was assigned night duty, your orders are to remain and finish your shift as per usual. Security systems are functioning normally, but please remain vigilant. The rest of you- go home. It's likely that all leave will be cancelled after tommorow, and your families will need reassuring. And get some rest.</p><p>As you will no doubt be aware, Aurors Hercules Peters and Eleanor Fontaine have been officially confirmed as deceased. Abrahams is currently in hospital, and reported to be in a stable condition. All employees will be notified of funeral arrangements, should anyone wish to pay their respects. That will be all. Dismissed."</p><p>The President's sharp eyes, full of a grim, cold determination, swept the room one last time. Again, for the length of a heartbeat, they seemed to focus on Tina. Then she turned, and swept from the room like a great horned serpent, gliding over troubled water.</p><p>It took a while for everyone to process their employers' words but, slowly but surely, the room emptied. The older, more experienced Aurors left the fastest, striding off with at least a semblance of purpose. The younger ones, especially the trainees, were more hesitant; they drifted towards the door slowly and aimlessly, like fall leaves that had tumbled into a pond. Tina was in the latter group. Not that she wanted to stay up in the Major Investigation Department, with its preponderance of desks and bad coffee, and disappointing lack of duvets, blankets and childhood cuddly toys.</p><p>But going home would mean returning to the silence. To the emptiness. It would mean looking up and seeing no warm, inviting light in the window; no combined smell of stew, cherry pie and periculid eu-de-parfume. No bubbling laughter. No smile of joy, and love, and welcome. No gentle, hum-like breathing to fill the silence as she huddled in the sleepy darkness of bed. Her sister had packed them in a suitcase, along with her clothes, makeup and money, and taken them- where, Tina had no idea. They'd had that argument- one of their worst ever- and the next day, she'd returned from work to find her sister gone. That was two weeks ago. In fact, Tina hadn't worried at first; Queenie often spent the night at Jacob's these days.</p><p>But when she'd gone to the Lower East Side, and found Kowalski's Quality Baked Goods all shut up- well, it didn't take a genius to work out what the two of them had done. Returning home, she'd found a note under her pillow, confirming every suspicion. She'd read it, memorised it, and thrown it in the fire. </p><p>Of course, it had said nothing about where Queenie and Jacob had gone. Tina was sure they'd left the country- perhaps to South America, or else to Europe. (Canada couldn't be ruled out, but intermarriage was still banned there and Queenie was nothing if not a romantic.) But they hadn't sent so much as a postcard and with security tighter than a No-Maj corset, she hadn't dared to send an owl.</p><p>"Hey- Goldstein. You goin' down?"</p><p>She jumped at the sound of Red's voice, and realised she'd walked right past the elevator.</p><p>"Oh... sorry."</p><p>She just about managed to squeeze in with a dozen-odd colleagues. The goblin tapped the ground floor button, and the glass box began rattling down. Two of the trainees were whispering frantically; another seemed to be holding back tears. Tina caught snatches of things like "Interrogate everybody... polyjuice... nah, he got promoted, like, last month... down in the basement, <em>uggh</em>... but how could anyone-"</p><p>The elevator stopped, and Tina darted to one side to let the others out. Nobody thanked her, but hurried off without a backwards glance. <em>Abernathy</em>... she ran every encounter over in her head, trying to find some kind of sign that he could... he'd seemed more purposeful lately, perhaps... but that was natural, that was a newbie settling in...</p><p>"Hey- Goldstein." Again, she jumped.</p><p>"Uh-huh?"</p><p>"You ok, kid?"</p><p>She looked down at Red, and was touched to see something like concern in his beetle-black eyes.</p><p>"Yeah." She forced her mouth into a smile. "Yeah, I'll be alright. Just need a little shut-eye, that's all."</p><p>"Huh..."</p><p>"Goodnight, Red."</p><p>"It's 4:00am."</p><p>"Yeah, whatever. See ya."</p><p>Lit only by watery moonlight, miles above her head, the atrium seemed more like a mausoleum. Her footsteps echoed horribly as she made for the entrance, starting at every movement in the eery-looking shadows, and resisting the urge to keep one hand on her wand as the guard ran a secrecy sensor up and down her coat.</p><p>The streets of New York weren't much help. The city that never sleeps was still deceptively drowsy at this point; every loud noise made her <em>almost </em>pull her wand out before she realised that <em>BANG </em>was just a car backfiring, and those shouts were just drunk men, telling her how much better that coat- and everything else- would look on the floor.</p><p>It was a sickening relief to finally reach the old brownstone. She crept in, careful not to bang the front door, and tiptoed up the stairs. The last thing she needed was an interrogation from Mrs E about what sort of time did she call this.</p><p>The apartment, like MACUSA, was pitch-dark and grave-silent. The lights clicked on to reveal everything as Queenie had left it: the sofa, the kitchenette, the books, the dining table, the mirror (a gift from Jacob) on the living-room wall. Without her sister, fluttering about cooking and singing and refusing to take tidying up seriously, it all looked... wrong. Artificial, like a forgotten dollhouse. Even the rag-tag patterned cushions and throws Ma had loved so much- it all looked dull and stale, though maybe it was just because she felt that way herself. Hell, without that smile even the stars seemed to shine less.</p><p>
  <em>Queenie...</em>
</p><p><em>Queenie, where are you?</em> </p>
