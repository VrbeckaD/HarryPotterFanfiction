  <em>Willow!!!!!!!!!!</em>
</p><p><em>OH MY GOSH MORGANA IS SO CUTE! I can’t believe your mom let you get her! I asked my mom like twenty thousand times if she’d get me an owl, but she said she and my dad already got me a broomstick “against her better judgment,” whatever that means, and they’re not spending more money ‘cause broomsticks are </em>really <em>expensive. I’m not allowed to fly on my broomstick in the backyard, ‘cause Mom says she doesn’t want to have to try and explain things to the neighbors, so I’m super duper looking forward to going back to school. Which is WEIRD, ‘cause usually summer is my favorite time ever! But mostly I just miss you guys.</em></p><p><em>You’re still able to come to my pool party on Saturday, right? I know your parents have been traveling a lot more than you expected, and I really want to see you before school starts up! Faith says she’s too busy, and Tara and Xander are both still at Hogwarts (plus Xander says his parents would totally flip if they found out he went over to my house, and obviously nobody wants that to happen), but Ron and Hermione both said they could come! AND Ron said he’s bringing some of his brothers and his little sister! So it’s going to be a really big party if you can make it, and probably </em>really <em>fun!!! Please come!!!! I miss you!!!!!!!!</em></p><p><em>Have you heard from Harry? I sent him like five letters and a lot of candy, but I haven’t gotten anything back. Ron says he’s tried to invite Harry over four or five times but </em>he <em>hasn’t gotten anything back either. Hopefully everything’s okay over there, ‘cause Ron’s been talking about using a flying car to bust Harry out. Don’t worry, though—OBVIOUSLY I made him promise that he’d swing by my house and take me with him if he did something like that. No way he’s the only one who gets to fly in a FLYING CAR.</em></p><p>
  <em>Write back soon!!! I wanna see Morgana again and give her more head scritches. And hear from you, obviously!</em>

  <em>Buffy</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>“DO A KICK-FLIP!” Fred yelled.</p><p>“DO A CANNONBALL!” George yelled.</p><p>“Don’t do <em>either </em>of those, it’s <em>dangerous!”</em> Percy chided, bobbing up and down in his inner tube.</p><p>“KICK-FLIP CANNONBALL BONANZA!!!” Buffy yelled, and flung herself off the diving board, trying to kick-flip and cannonball at the same time. She hit the water with a <em>splat.</em></p><p>“BELLY-FLOP!” chorused Fred and George, and proceeded to laugh hysterically.</p><p>“Ooooh,” said Hermione sympathetically when Buffy surfaced. “That looked like it <em>hurt. </em>Are you okay?”</p><p>“Buffy belly flops <em>all </em>the time,” said Dawn, who was sitting on the edge of the shallow end with her feet in the water. “She’s <em>used </em>to it.”</p><p>Buffy stuck her tongue out at Dawn. Dawn stuck her tongue out at Buffy. “I’m <em>fine,” </em>Buffy informed Hermione, raising her voice so that Dawn could hear her. “I could totally do a kick-flip cannonball bonanza <em>five more times </em>if I wanted to.”</p><p>“Please don’t,” said Hermione. Then, “Oh, look, Ron’s about to do the <em>high dive!”</em></p><p>“Ronald, <em>be careful!” </em>called Ron’s mom from the picnic tables, looking like she was already contemplating scaling the high dive and bringing him back down.</p><p>“Mum, I’m <em>twelve!” </em>Ron shot back. “I can handle this!”</p><p>“DO A BELLY FLOP!” yelled Fred and George.</p><p>“Well, <em>that’s </em>supportive,” said Hermione reprovingly.</p><p>Ron wavered, looking down at the pool below him. His eyes went from his siblings to Buffy to the gaggle of parents at the picnic tables—and locked, unexpectedly, on Hermione’s. With a weirdly shy smile, he gave her a little wave.</p><p>Hermione grinned back, waving up at him. “You can do it, Ron!” she called.</p><p>Without hesitation, Ron jumped, hitting the water feet-first. He came up a few seconds later, spluttering and laughing, and Hermione and Buffy swam over to check on him. <em>“Wicked!” </em>he informed them, beaming. “Buff, you’ve <em>gotta </em>try it!”</p><p>“I’m <em>so </em>gonna,” Buffy agreed.</p><p>“Please don’t belly-flop off the high dive,” said Hermione with some worry.</p><p>“I am gonna <em>kick-flip cannonball bonanza </em>off the high dive, Hermione,” Buffy informed her with dignity.</p><p>“…same difference, Buffy.”</p><p>“Hang on,” said Fred suddenly, swimming over to the edge of the pool to squint towards their parents. “Is that your friend Willow with her parents?”</p><p><em>“Willow?” </em>gasped Hermione and Buffy, delighted.</p><p>“I mean, yeah,” said George from next to them, “but they’ve got two other people with them. A man, and—”</p><p>“Holy <em>crabcakes!” </em>gasped Buffy, eyes widening as she saw the woman shaking hands with her mom. <em>“That’s Jenny Calendar!”</em></p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Dear Tara,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ve been writing a whole bunch of letters lately, thanks to my new owl Morgana! I hope you give her a few head scritches for her troubles, because she’s been working really, really hard. I give her twenty head scritches per letter because I want to make sure she knows her efforts are appreciated. She’s the best girl in the whole world!!</em>
</p><p><em>You asked about how I was doing—well, I’m doing pretty great! My parents and I have been traveling A LOT—we do it every summer, and sometimes it makes me a little sad that they go to a whole bunch of important Ministry events and leave me in the hotel, but lately they’ve been letting me come with them and meet all the important people that they do! I’ve gotten to talk to a whole bunch of government officials and Muggle-rights activists and stuff, and all of them are </em>so <em>surprised when they find out I’m in Slytherin? They always think I’m in Ravenclaw. Someday I’m going to be really important AND really nice and everyone will feel really bad for being so mean about Slytherins all the time.</em></p><p>
  <em>I heard from Buffy that you’re not going to be able to make it to her pool party on account of staying with Professor McGonagall. I hope you know that I’ll really miss you! I promise I’ll take a few pictures while I’m there, ‘cause I bet you miss everybody a whole bunch. I know I do. My parents and I are leaving on another business trip with some family friends, but when I told them about Buffy’s pool party, my parents thought it would be really cool to visit a Muggle house—and so did the family friends. So I hope it’s okay with Buffy that I’m bringing a lot of people? (I have a feeling Buffy and Hermione are going to know at least one of them—hint hint!!)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you so much for the flowers you sent me! I’m so glad that Professor Sprout gave you a whole patch in Greenhouse Two just to grow stuff over the summer. That’s super cool, and it sounds like you’re having so much fun staying at Hogwarts over the summer!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How’s the stuff with your dad going? When I asked Professor McGonagall about it, she said something about how you’re a ward of Hogwarts now. So does that mean you get to live there and never have to see him again? Sometimes I worry about you, you know. I think you deserve to live in a bright, sunny place and grow as many flowers as you want.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter isn’t too weird. I got a little blushy when I wrote that last part.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your friend,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Willow</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>“Joyce, right?” Jenny Calendar was shaking Buffy’s mom’s hand. “Thanks so much for having us. I’m sure this is a little weird—”</p><p>“Oh, no, not at all!” Buffy’s mom beamed. “Buffy has a scrapbook of your articles in her bedroom! It’s the first time I’ve seen her <em>this </em>excited about reading, actually—”</p><p><em>“MO-OM!” </em>Buffy objected, weaving her way through the parents to grab Willow’s hand. Willow beamed. “Don’t embarrass me!”</p><p>“So you <em>don’t </em>have a Jenny Calendar scrapbook?” teased Buffy’s mom.</p><p><em>“Ugh!” </em>said Buffy, who had gone pink.</p><p>“Bye, Jenny! Bye, Remus!” Willow gave Jenny and her husband a little wave and an apologetic smile as Buffy all but dragged her towards the pool. “Sorry I didn’t tell you she was coming, Buffy—”</p><p>“I can’t believe Jenny Calendar knows I have a <em>scrapbook!” </em>Buffy burst out, pulling Willow over to the deep end. Ron was floating on his back, but Hermione was pulling herself out of the pool, eyes on Jenny Calendar. “I hate my mom <em>so much! </em>She’s <em>so </em>embarrassing!”</p><p>“Oh, Buffy, it’s not that bad!” Hermione reassured Buffy, patting her on the shoulder. “I’m sure Jenny Calendar’s delighted to hear that someone cares about the things that she’s writing.”</p><p><em>“HHHGH,” </em>said Buffy, burying her face in Willow’s shoulder.</p><p>Hermione and Willow exchanged an amused look. “D’you want to try and dive off the board?” Hermione asked Willow. “Ron went off the <em>high dive </em>and he didn’t belly flop at <em>all!”</em></p><p>From the pool, Ron beamed, sticking his hand out of the water to give the girls a thumbs-up. “It’s just talent,” he informed them, right before Fred and George flipped him over into the water. <em>“OW! </em>Get <em>off, </em>Fred—”</p><p>“I <em>do </em>want to try the high dive,” said Willow hopefully, gently untangling herself from Buffy. “I bet I can do it headfirst! I was able to do it from the low dive at the pool by my parents’ house, but we don’t have a dive <em>this </em>high!”</p><p>“How come all of <em>you </em>get to try the high dive but Mom won’t let <em>me?” </em>objected an indignant Dawn, her head popping up from the water right by the low dive.</p><p>Buffy raised her head to roll her eyes at her little sister. “Dawnie,” she said, “you’re <em>still </em>holding the wall.”</p><p>“Am not!” said Dawn, let go of the wall, floundered, and grabbed it again.</p><p><em>“DAWN!” </em>called Buffy’s mom. “Stay out of the deep end!”</p><p>“I <em>hate </em>being the baby!” Dawn huffed, climbing back out of the pool.</p><p>Ginny Weasley then proceeded to climb up the ladder to the high dive, aim herself carefully at the water, jump off the board, and enter the water <em>just </em>close enough to splash Fred and George in the eyes. <em>“Ow!” </em>yelled George, letting go of Ron to chase after his sister. “Ginny, I <em>know </em>that was on purpose—”</p><p>Fred swam over to the edge, peering up at Buffy, Willow, and Hermione. “Why’s she upset?” he asked, nodding towards Buffy.</p><p>“Jenny Calendar knows that Buffy has a scrapbook all about her,” explained Willow.</p><p>Fred snorted. “That’s nothing compared to Mum’s Lockhart collage,” he said. “You’re fine, Buff.”</p><p>“Mum’s got a <em>Lockhart collage?” </em>said Ron, sounding viscerally horrified.</p><p>“A what?” said Buffy curiously.</p><p>“Oh, you don’t want to know,” said Willow, wrinkling her nose. She didn’t think very much of Gilderoy Lockhart, though she <em>was </em>pretty curious as to how he’d written <em>so </em>many books about how great he was. All of his facts were entirely correct, she’d <em>checked, </em>and yet—</p><p>“Remus, <em>no!” </em>came a laughing voice from the other side of the pool. Looking up, Willow saw that Remus had scooped Jenny up bridal-style, carrying her over towards the deep end of the pool. “You <em>can’t </em>do this every time I start talking about work over the summer!”</p><p>“Where there’s a pool, there’s a way, dear!” Remus countered.</p><p>Buffy froze.</p><p>“Aww, c’mon, Buffy!” Willow hugged her around the shoulders. “Jenny’s not that bad! She’s <em>really </em>nice!”</p><p><em>“I Know That,” </em>Buffy hissed through her teeth. “But she’s just so <em>cool! </em>What if she doesn’t like me?”</p><p>Remus staggered over and threw Jenny into the deep end. She resurfaced a few seconds later, still laughing as she bobbed in the water. “I am so sorry,” she wheezed, gripping the wall with one hand and pushing her hair out of her eyes with the other.</p><p>“Well, you made a <em>splash,” </em>Remus countered, leaning down to ruffle her hair. “Isn’t that what you’re always looking to do at social functions?”</p><p>Ginny and Hermione both started giggling.</p><p>“Hi, Jenny!” said Willow, trying not to laugh herself. She let go of Buffy, sitting down on the edge of the pool next to Jenny. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Thank god I had enough foresight to change into my swimsuit before we showed up,” Jenny answered, grinning up at Willow. “How are you doing, Willow? Do you wanna introduce me to your friends?”</p><p>“Yes!” Willow beamed. “This is Hermione, and that’s Buffy, and they both really love your writing! Buffy’s read the articles that came out this year, but Hermione—”</p><p>“I’ve read <em>everything </em>you’ve <em>ever </em>written!” Hermione burst out, lighting up like a Christmas tree as she knelt down next to Willow. “I really enjoyed that article you wrote in the late 1980s—that one about the injustices perpetrated against werewolves in the wizarding community?”</p><p>“Yeah, well, that one’s particularly important to me,” said Jenny, and gave Remus a little sideways smile. “And the rest of you are all Arthur Weasley’s kids, right?”</p><p>“You know our dad?” said a surprised Ron.</p><p>Jenny laughed somewhat ruefully. “Your dad,” she said, “is pretty much the only person at the Ministry who actually <em>likes </em>me. He talks a <em>lot </em>about his kids. It’s really sweet.”</p><p>“Jenny, you’re quite melodramatic,” said Remus, cracking a smile. “The Rosenbergs seem to enjoy your company well enough.”</p><p>“The Rosenbergs go without saying!” Jenny tugged at Remus’s leg. “Are you gonna come into the pool, or are you just throwing <em>me </em>into the deep end?”</p><p>“Ms. Cal—um—Jenny Cal—hhHHH,” said Buffy, and hid her face in her hands.</p><p>“Buffy really likes you,” Hermione added helpfully. “She’s just really shy because you mean a lot to her! She has your Chocolate Frog card—”</p><p>“GHH,” said Buffy.</p><p>Jenny tilted her head a little, then pulled herself out of the pool to lean down and gently tug Buffy’s hands away from her face. “Hi, Buffy!” she said, smiling reassuringly. “It really means a lot to <em>me </em>that you like what I write so much. You’re going into your second year at Hogwarts, right?”</p><p>Eyes wide and round, Buffy nodded.</p><p>“Why don’t we go get a snack and chat?” Jenny held her hand out to Buffy, who took it. “I’d love to get to know you a little better.”</p><p>A slow, shy smile spread across Buffy’s face, and she nodded again, letting Jenny lead her back towards the picnic tables.</p><p>“Remus Lupin?” said Hermione earnestly. “You’re Jenny’s husband, aren’t you? <em>And </em>you co-founded the Lycanthropy Support Organization with her?”</p><p>“The—yes,” said Remus, looking somewhat surprised. “You’re a bit young to know about <em>that.” </em>He smiled slightly at Willow. “Though I suppose it makes sense—you being <em>Willow’s </em>friend and all. Birds of a feather, and all that.”</p><p>Willow <em>glowed. </em>She always loved it when Remus and Jenny were around. They <em>always </em>paid attention to the things she had to say, and they had nice things to say about her, and it made her feel <em>really </em>special.</p><p>“I have <em>so many questions </em>about lycanthropy,” said Hermione enthusiastically. “You and your wife built the existing werewolf support system from the ground up, working <em>tirelessly </em>against centuries of ingrained prejudice! Can you speak a bit more on the subject?”</p><p>Behind Remus, Jenny had turned around to start laughing at him. “Yeah, Remus!” she called. “Can you talk more about your job, even though it’s summer?”</p><p>“Hermione, I would be honored,” said Remus, “only I am <em>deeply </em>afraid that my wife will push me into this swimming pool if I do.”</p><p>“It is a <em>pool </em>party, Mr. Lupin,” pointed out Fred. “You’ll have to get wet at <em>some </em>point.”</p><p>“Give me a sec, Buffy,” said Jenny, squeezing Buffy’s hand before letting it go and striding back towards Remus.</p><p>Remus gave Jenny a sort of affectionately resigned smile, then said to Hermione, “Well. The LSO was largely Jenny’s idea, which—”</p><p>Willow had to step back to avoid the splash.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Dear Harry,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Everyone’s been trying to send you letters but we haven’t gotten a single response back! I really, really hope you’re okay. I worry about you at the Dursleys’ and I don’t think you should have been sent back there. Everyone else just thinks it’s only a tiny bit bad there, but now that I’ve been staying with Professor McGonagall, I know a little bit more about the kinds of places that are safe to live in and the kinds of places that aren’t. Our places aren’t. I think you should be at Hogwarts with me and Xander.</em>
</p><p><em>Xander comes up from Hogsmeade a lot to spend time with me!! It’s very nice of him. Usually we spend a lot of time helping Hagrid with his magical creatures, or planting in my flower garden, or borrowing books from the library on behalf of Professor Giles. Professor McGonagall says she’s glad I have someone my age to spend time with, and she hopes that next summer, the Ministry will be able to sort out a wizarding family for me to live with. She filed a report of abuse with the Ministry, and my dad didn’t want things to go to trial, so he just signed the papers that agreed I should be a ward of Hogwarts. I haven’t told her anything about what’s going on with you, because I want to talk more with you about that before I do anything that might upset you—but you haven’t responded to any of my letters, so if I don’t hear from you at </em>all, <em>I might </em>have<em> to talk with Professor McGonagall. I really hope that that doesn’t upset you.</em></p><p>
  <em>I’ve sent you a lot of pressed flowers from my garden! I hope they make you smile, and I hope I see or hear from you soon. Everyone is really, really worried about you, like I said—so please, please write back if you can!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tara</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>“He’s probably fine,” Xander informed Tara through a mouthful of five of Professor McGonagall’s shortbread cookies. “I bet he’s just too busy to answer your letters or something.”</p><p>“Nobody <em>else </em>is,” Tara pointed out. “And would <em>you </em>put off writing letters to <em>everyone </em>if everyone thought something was wrong?”</p><p>Xander swallowed, then gave her a sheepish grin. “Probably.”</p><p>Tara rolled her eyes, smiling reluctantly. <em>“Well,” </em>she said. “I think Harry would write back if he knew everyone was worried.”</p><p>“Ron wrote me and said he was going to fly the car over, though—”</p><p>“That’s a very bad idea. I wrote him and told him not to do it.”</p><p>“Ron says <em>all </em>you girls are saying don’t fly the car,” said Xander, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Tara raised an eyebrow. “Even Buffy?”</p><p>“Buffy’s gonna be a Chaser next year <em>and </em>Ron says she did a kick-flip cannonball bonanza off the diving board at her pool party,” Xander informed Tara. “She’s <em>basically </em>an honorary boy.”</p><p>“And it’s such a bad thing to be a girl?”</p><p>Xander shook his head. “Girls are just smart!” he said earnestly. “Like Professor McGonagall and Jenny Calendar. Me and Ron and Buffy, we’re…” He trailed off. “You know what, I don’t think I want to finish that sentence.”</p><p>“I can see why.” Tara took a shortbread cookie, taking a small bite. “How’s Professor Giles doing?”</p><p>Xander beamed. “I <em>knew </em>there was something I forgot to tell you!” he said. “Giles’s cat had kittens!”</p><p>Tara’s jaw dropped. “kITTENS?” she shrieked.</p><p><em>“Whoa!” </em>Xander covered his ears. “I almost <em>miss </em>when you were stuttering all the time!”</p><p>Professor McGonagall chose this moment to enter the room with two mugs of hot chocolate. Setting one down in front of Tara, she handed the other one to Xander and said, <em>“Mr. </em>Harris, if you visit me every single day, kindly cut down your biscuit intake. I will be left with only crumbs by mid-June.”</p><p>“…kitties!!!” Tara all but sobbed.</p><p>“Tara, are you quite all right?” said Professor McGonagall with some concern.</p><p>“I, uh,” Xander winced, rubbing the back of his neck, “kinda told her about how Professor Giles’s cat had kittens.”</p><p>Professor McGonagall’s mouth quirked a little as she looked at Tara. “Well,” she said. “I may have to re-evaluate my plans for today; it seems of the <em>utmost </em>importance that I escort you and Tara to Hogsmeade post-haste.”</p><p>“…what?” said Xander.</p><p>“Who am I to keep Miss Maclay from kittens?” said Professor McGonagall, and actually <em>smiled </em>at Tara. If Tara wasn’t so busy thinking about little baby kittens and their little baby kitten paws, she might have smiled back.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Hi Faith,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know writing to you is a long shot, because you said the orphanage doesn’t usually let kids get letters, but I figured I could at least mail this one through Muggle post without the Dursleys noticing anything. I’ve tried writing to Buffy, and to Willow, seeing as they both gave me their addresses, but they haven’t written me anything back. I was just wondering—</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>Harry stared down at the letter, a lump in his throat. There was no way this letter would reach Faith, so he supposed he could be honest.</p>
<hr/><p><em>—do you know why no one’s written me anything? Ron said he was going to ask me to come and stay over the summer, and the girls all promised to write me lots of letters to keep me from having to think about Dudley, and Xander said he would send me some wizard comic books that he had doubles of. I know why </em>you’re <em>not writing me, at least—you said yourself that you probably won’t be able to write anyone. But I at least thought that the people who </em>said <em>they’d write me would do it.</em></p><p>
  <em>I miss Hogwarts so much. I bet you do too. An orphanage sounds about as fun as living with the Dursleys. Probably more fun, actually, ‘cause you’re not doing all the housework and no one tries to hit you with the frying pan.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Write me back if this reaches you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>“BOY!” came a yell from downstairs.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Harry folded the letter into precise thirds—then crumpled it up and tossed it into the wastebasket. What was the point, anyway?</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>hermione</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I AM SO SO SO SO SO BORED HERE. no one pays any attention to me except to make fun of me for going to a snooty boarding school and i cant even hex them or anything! so i just have to kick everybodys knees instead AND i have to do my homework in SECRET so no one sees me writing wierd witchy shit and the worst part is that i LIKE doing my homework now that im back here. do you know how much a place has to SUCK for me to like doing HOMEWORK? all the other girls make fun of me cause i dont hang out with them anymore and i dont hang out with them anymore cause i like homework and i miss my REAL friends!!!! im a NERD now</em>
</p><p>
  <em>i cant send you this letter but im writing it anyway cause im JUST THAT BORED UGH.</em>

</p>
<hr/><p>“Mr. Pinky,” Faith whispered, “do <em>you </em>know who the Minister of Magic was in 1877? ‘Cause I’m <em>stumped.”</em></p><p>Mr. Pinky just looked at Faith with his big button eyes.</p><p>“Well, what about you, Mrs. Blue Bunny?”</p><p>Mrs. Blue Bunny, who Faith had been using to help hold up her blanket fort, fell over.</p><p>“I miss studying with Hermione and Willow,” Faith muttered. “I didn’t have to do <em>any </em>work, <em>and </em>I didn’t talk to stuffed animals.” Picking up Mr. Pinky, she hugged him close, grinning a little into his soft pink head. Mr. Pinky was the first thing a <em>friend </em>had given her, she thought, and even if these next few months were going to be boring as shit, she was going to be seeing her friends again <em>really </em>soon.</p><p>After a moment of consideration, she pulled out her fake letter to Hermione, scribbling a postscript.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>PS who was the minister of magic in 1877 because i dont know that one on our history of magic homework</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>Maybe she could figure out a way to send Hermione a letter if she <em>really </em>thought hard about it. If she wrote HOGWARTS on it in big letters, a wizard would <em>probably </em>find it and figure out how to get it to Hermione, right?</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Hello, Xander!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you’re having a wonderful time with Professor Giles. Are you learning anything new? Has he told you anything about what he’ll be teaching us in second year? Have you asked him any of the questions I sent in my last letter? I hope you have. I sent a lot of questions directly to him, but then I thought of a lot of new ones while I was writing you, so don’t worry if he says he’s already answered all of my questions. He likely doesn’t know about the ones I sent via your letter.</em>
</p><p><em>I’m extremely busy with schoolwork, but I did take some time off today to visit Buffy and her family! Did you know that Willow’s parents are friends with Jenny Calendar, the Muggle rights activist Buffy and I made a scrapbook for? We talked to Jenny and her husband and they’re both really nice. Jenny even says she’ll happily answer any letters from me, Buffy, or any of our school friends, so if you want to write her for some extra credit…well, I’m sure at least one of our professors would appreciate the initiative. I suspect Professor Giles appreciates Jenny Calendar’s work to some degree at least; he quoted one of her articles in one of our last classes of the semester. No one noticed but me. (Buffy would have, I think, if she wasn’t busy trying to eat candy without Professor Giles noticing </em>that.)</p><p>
  <em>If you also haven’t heard from Harry, would you please try writing him a letter again? I’ve tried quite a few times, but I haven’t gotten any reply, and neither has anyone else. Perhaps he’d respond more easily to a letter from you or Ron. I don’t think that really sounds like him, but I’m trying to approach this problem from every angle.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Please please please send me pictures of the new kittens!!! They sound adorable!!!!!!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love from Hermione</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione tacked the picture from the pool party up on her wall as <em>soon </em>as Buffy sent her a copy, and made a pointed note on her packing-for-school to-do list regarding taking the photo down and bringing it with her to school. She wanted to see it for the remaining few months that she was staying with her parents, though, because it was <em>officially </em>one of her favorite photos <em>ever: </em>Jenny Calendar and Remus Lupin standing with Buffy, Ron, Willow, and Hermione, all six of them still soaking wet from the pool. Buffy still looked a little starstruck, her eyes on Jenny Calendar’s hand (which was resting on her shoulder). Ron was eating a hot dog and had mustard all over his face. Remus Lupin had a soft little half-smile. Hermione and Willow were grinning ear-to-ear at the camera, which made sense, because it had been such a <em>fun </em>day.</p><p>Hermione had <em>never </em>had friends like this in primary school, and now she <em>did—</em>and she felt positively certain that she’d have them for a long time coming.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <em>Hey Ron,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Did you know that the Chudley Cannons SUCK!?!?!?!? Ninth in the league AGAIN. You gotta find a new team, dude. The Sunnydale Warthogs are killing it over in California and they’ll probably make it to the World Cup in two years.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyway, now that we’ve got that out of the way, have you heard from Harry? We all keep trying to write him but we don’t get anything back. Tara’s pretty worried.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hope you’re having a cool summer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Xander</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>“Kittens-kittens-kittens-kittens-kittens!” Tara chanted, practically vibrating with anticipation as the three of them walked down the street towards Giles’s cottage. Professor McGonagall had a tight hold on the back of Tara’s sweater to keep her from getting lost, which Xander thought was a pretty good idea, because Tara seemed barely aware of where she was going.</p><p>“How many kittens are there, Mr. Harris?” asked Professor McGonagall, giving him a wry little smile that pretty clearly conveyed <em>we’re in this one together.</em></p><p>“Uh, five right now,” said Xander. “Giles is planning on keeping one, but he’s giving away the rest.”</p><p><em>“He’s giving them away?!” </em>Tara gasped.</p><p>“You know, Tara,” said Professor McGonagall conversationally, “if you wanted a cat—”</p><p>“!!!!!!!” said Tara, pressing her hands to her mouth. She looked like she was about to start crying at any second.</p><p>“Yeah, I really should have seen this coming,” said Xander. “She thought the three-headed-dog was a <em>good boy.”</em></p><p>“Good lord, I truly understand why this one’s in <em>my </em>House,” said Professor McGonagall with some exhaustion.</p><p>Giles was waiting at the door to his cottage. It was hard to think of the guy as “Professor Giles” when you and him ate breakfast together every morning, but they <em>definitely </em>weren’t on a first-name basis, so “Giles” was kind of the compromise that they’d settled on. Buffy had always called Professor Giles <em>Giles, </em>but Xander suspected that that was mostly because Buffy didn’t really pay attention to wizarding rules. “Hello, all,” said Giles warmly. “I’ve got tea on, Minerva, if you’d like to stay a bit?”</p><p>“Thank you, Rupert, yes,” said Professor McGonagall, looking a little startled. “How did you know—”</p><p>“Pomona owled me to mention that Tara was <em>quite </em>set on seeing the kittens,” said Giles, smiling in Tara’s direction. “Tara, if you’d like to—”</p><p>Taking advantage of Professor McGonagall’s slackened grip, Tara pulled herself free, pushing past Professor Giles in her hurry to get to the kittens. “Sorry!” she called over her shoulder, sounding genuinely repentant—and then there was a sobbing shriek of <em>“Babies!!!”</em></p><p>Giles winced, rubbing his side. “That girl is certainly coming into her own,” he said.</p><p>“I’m quite glad of it,” said Professor McGonagall.</p><p>Xander followed Tara inside a little more slowly; he’d seen the kittens before, after all. Giles’s calico cat was named Mimi, and she was <em>super </em>amazing; she would always come up and rub her head against his hand when he was working on his homework. Sitting down next to Tara, he scratched Mimi’s ears. “Giles said I could name them, you know,” he informed her, “but if you wanna name a few, go ahead. I only named two so far.”</p><p>“Which two have names?” Tara whispered. She was holding the smallest of the kittens—a black one with little white mittens—close to her chest.</p><p>“Uh,” Xander scooped up a calico kitten, “this one’s Spaghetti ‘cause she tried to eat my spaghetti last night, and <em>then </em>she yelled at me when I wouldn’t give her any spaghetti. And <em>that </em>one,” he gestured towards the grey kitten chewing on the hem of Tara’s skirt, “is Bitey, ‘cause he bites <em>everything.”</em></p><p>“I want to name this one—” Tara chewed on her lip, thinking, then said, “Miss Kitty Fantastico.”</p><p>“That’s an <em>excellent </em>name, Tara,” said Giles, sitting down on the floor between them to gently tug Bitey away from Tara’s skirt. “Would you like to take her home with you?”</p><p>Tucking Spaghetti more securely against his chest, Xander got up to check on Professor McGonagall. She was sitting in the kitchen with a cup of tea, which she set down upon seeing him. “Tea, Mr. Harris?” she inquired.</p><p>“Do you want to go see the kittens?” Xander asked. “I brought you the best one.” He winced. “Don’t tell the others I said that.”</p><p>Professor McGonagall looked somewhat amused. “I’ll keep that in mind,” she said. “May I hold her?”</p><p>“Sure,” said Xander, trying to untangle Spaghetti’s claws from his shirt. She dug in, looking up at him with an indignant expression. <em>“C’mon, </em>Spaghetti, you have to meet new people at <em>some </em>point—”</p><p>“Mrow!” said Spaghetti reprovingly.</p><p>Professor McGonagall chuckled. “I think she likes you.”</p><p>“Professor, can I keep this one?” Tara asked hopefully, coming into the kitchen with Miss Kitty Fantastico still cuddled in her arms. Giles followed close behind, grinning a little when he noticed Spaghetti stuck on Xander’s shirt. “I named her Miss Kitty Fantastico and she has <em>mittens—”</em></p><p>“Of course you can keep her, Tara,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding almost startled. She stood up to cross the room to Tara, placing a hand on Tara’s shoulder, and Tara beamed up at her. Xander didn’t see <em>how </em>anyone could say no to Tara about <em>anything.</em></p><p>“Xander,” said Giles quietly, giving him a small smile, “by any chance would you like to keep Spaghetti?”</p><p>Xander blinked. “Huh?”</p><p><em>“The best one, </em>you said.”</p><p>“Oh, man. <em>Don’t </em>tell the other kittens I said that, Giles—”</p><p>“Well, if Spaghetti’s <em>your </em>cat, I think it makes sense for you to think she’s the best one,” Giles pointed out.</p><p>Xander looked nervously down at Spaghetti. “I don’t know,” he said. “My parents—they aren’t the kind of people who are nice to animals.”</p><p>Giles’s face twisted a little in that way it always did whenever Xander brought up his parents. “I wouldn’t worry about that, Xander,” he said, his voice completely calm. “If you have to go back and stay with them at any point over the summer, I can always keep her safe for you.”</p><p>“…I’ll think about it,” said Xander, looking down at Spaghetti’s big, round eyes. He kind of knew what his answer was going to be, though. Spaghetti’s claws were stuck in <em>his </em>shirt, after all; <em>she’d</em> basically chosen <em>him. </em>How could he say no to that?</p>

  <em>Buffy,</em>

  <em>Mum says I need to write a thank-you letter for the pool party, which she hasn’t made me do in AGES. It’s rubbish, especially since I know you know I’m thankful and everything. That’s just part of being friends with someone, is being thankful. But anyway, thank you for the pool party. My favourite part was when Percy tried to push Fred into the pool and Fred knocked into George and they both went in like dominoes. My second favourite part was when all of us were eating ice cream together and you said that me and Willow and Hermione were some of the best friends you’d ever had. Normally that would be my favourite part, but the thing with Percy and Fred and George was really funny.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Let me know if you hear from Harry, okay? Everyone’s really worried. I even got a letter from Xander today asking about him, and Xander keeps forgetting to reply to people’s letters. Only I don’t think Harry’s forgetting.</em>
