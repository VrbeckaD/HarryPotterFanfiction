    <p>Helia roamed the edge of the black lake brewing in anger from the naive bastards who labeled her as an attention seeking liar.</p><p>This year she watched as someone she had grown to care for was murdered before her very eyes, by the two men who she hated with every fiber of her being. The madman who murdered her parents and was trying very hard to kill her too and the whining coward who betrayed her parents resulting in their deaths. She was forced to watch as the murderer was resurrected, when the monster was revived again he tortured and humiliated her. She had barely escaped with her life and the body of her deceased friend.</p><p>Only to be called a liar and attention seeking, clearly something was wrong with her they whispered behind her back for why would she try to come up with such a horrible tall tale. Her few friend believed her but she felt isolated from everyone she cared for, alone and vulnerable waiting for someone to take a shot at her.</p><p>She sighed in melancholy wishing that there was a way to show everyone that she was telling the truth.</p><p>When suddenly a bright silver light shined blinding her, as the light faded she opened her eyes not even realizing she closed them in the first place. Only to meet the silvered gaze of her “enemy” Draco in confusion, the pale haired boy was hovering over her supporting his weight with his hands.</p><p>“Where the bloody hell are we, Potter” he drawled, his body tense on guard.</p><p>Glaring at him “how should I bloody know, Malfoy” she spat pushing him lightly off herself, while she cared for him she knew she could never share those feels with anybody it was best to keep them to herself.</p><p>Looking around, she notice they were in a large room that was furnished with comfortable looking chairs, couches and bean bags. The fireplace was blaring with heat that gave the room a homey feeling, doors littered the walls leading to somewhere.</p><p>“Pup, are you alright” called the voice of her godfather, her criminally convicted godfather who was supposed to be in hiding.</p><p>“Sirius, what are you doing here?” Quickly rushing to him and being pulled into a loving embrace “you shouldn’t be here” she warns him not wanting him to be carted back to Azkaban.</p><p>“I didn’t have much choice Pup, none of us did.” He explained, which brought her attention to the others in the room.</p><p>Hermione, Luna, Susan, Padma, Lee, Zabini, Nott, the Greengrass sister Daphne and Astoria, Neville, the Weasley siblings and their parents, Remus, Snape, Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, Amelia Bones, Mad-eye, Kingsley, Tonks and of course Sirius, Draco and herself.</p><p>A scream suddenly broke the silence “Sirius Black, he’s going to kill us!” Screamed a freighted Astoria, as she was pulled behind her older sister who glared at Helia and Sirius like they planned this.</p><p>“Potter, what is that deranged lunatic doing here and why are you acting so familiar with him” Daphne gritted out slowly backing away from them.</p><p>“No need to be alarmed Miss Greengrass, he will not harm you or your sister for he is innocent.” The Headmaster said gently, earning a scoff from the blonde haired girl who obviously didn’t believe a word out of the old man's mouth.</p><p>“Calm yourself Miss Greengrass, for once the Headmaster is right.” Snape sighed. “And as much as it pains me to admit Black would not harm anyone here.” The potions professor sneered as if admitted that caused a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>“Aw, Snape I didn’t know you cared so much for me” he mocked the stoic professor getting a slap on the head from his lifetime friend Remus.</p><p>“Don’t try to start a fight, Padfoot” he scolded.</p><p>“That doesn’t explain why Helia knows him” questioned Zabini lazily already draped across a loveseat with his feet planted on Nott’s lap who looked as if he didn’t mind one bit. </p><p>“He’s my godfather” was her only reply to the boy who causally studied her with indifference, total opposites from the boy next to him who’s staring  pierced her trying to piece together the information he was getting.</p><p>“Interesting” was his reply. </p><p>A growl was aimed at the lazy boy “Blaise” barked Draco clearly unhappy with Zabini for some reason. </p><p>“Enough with this foolishness, Albus why are we here” snapped Professor McGonagall turning to the Headmaster wanting an answer </p><p>“I would like to know with too” a woman who clearly was a political person with how she held herself and most likely Susan’s Aunt that she had yet to meet with how she held her redhead friend behind herself a Dark skinned man was positioned slightly in front of both of them.</p><p>A paper floated down slowly in front of her, quickly snatching the paper out of the air with trained to perfection seeker reflexes drawing the attention of everyone.</p><p>“Well Potter what are you waiting for an invitation, read it” Barked the gruff retired Auror </p><p>

</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Sincerely </strong> </em><br/>
<em> <strong>H.MPB, Lu.MPB, Li.MPB and C.MPB the four founders of this event </strong> </em>
</p><p>“Well then, shall we begin then” the Headmaster announced clapping his hands. </p><p>Suddenly having a horrible thought and from the looks on Hermione and Ron’s face they were thinking on the same thought process as her.</p><p>Clearing her throat nervously “we won’t get in trouble or have points taken from us for past or future action will we?” Hermione asked wringing her hands shakily getting a suspicious look from Snape but was quickly reassured by Professor McGonagall.</p><p>“No course not Miss Granger” earning a sigh of relief from most of the children.</p><p>Another note floated down, she quickly snatched it again reading without being as to.</p><p>
  <strong>“I forgot to mention there will be two more guests, try not to faint.”</strong>
</p><p>Was all that was written on the slip of paper getting confusion from most people, but when she looked up from the note she noticed two people in front of her.<br/>
The women had long red hair that flowed down to her waist and bright green eyes while the man had messy black hair with glasses framing his hazel eyes that blazed with mischief. The people in front of her were her parent whom she had never seen outside pictures or her dreams, sharp gasps and shocked cries the others noticed too</p><p>“James, Lily” was all that Sirius could croak out in shock.</p><p>“Padfoot, where are we?” Ask a confused James Potter only to notice his best friend was older than the last time he saw him. Quickly looking around, he saw faces that were familiar but different and others that he didn’t know, but his eyes were drawn to the young girl standing next to his best friends looking shocked.</p><p>“Fawn?” Was his shocked question getting a weird look from his wife who knew their daughter was in fact a baby not knowing why he called the girl his nickname for their child. But when looking at her, she too saw what her husband notice for this girl with the messy black hair that barely touched her shoulders to her round spectaculars that framed her beautiful green eyes, ones she knew mirrored her own this girl was her daughter.</p><p>“Heli great Morgana, h-how could this be possible?” Lily gasped reaching for her daughter who stared at her as if she never seen her before.</p><p>Helia could only hear ringing in her ear that she usually associated with anger, but what she was feeling wasn’t anger it was fear. Her breath came out in short pants, her hands tingle wanting to have her wand in hand for comfort she could feel her legs giving out from underneath her. A pair of arms caught her slowly lowering her to the floor, when a face was suddenly in front of her their icy blue eyes catching her attention.</p><p>“Potter listen to me, your safe nothing here is going to hurt you” Nott spoke lowly </p><p>“Miss Potter I understand this must be a shock-“ Dumbledore began, but his voice just grated on her nerves making her want to lash out but a voice did it for her.</p><p>“Can’t you see you’re not helping old man” Zabini glared at the Headmaster with fierce expression looking nothing like his usual devil may care attitude, he was quickly backed up by Hermione and Ron.</p><p>“Can’t you tell she’s having a panic attack” hissed Hermione.</p><p>“She doesn’t need you yammering so back the bloody hell off!” Ron snapped his face red in his rage.</p><p>Trying to suck in much needed breaths of air “I c-can’t stop it, I’m sorry” she stammered only to get hushed by the quiet boy.</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay, just breathe, you have nothing to be sorry for” he comforted her brushing her hair out of her eyes.</p><p>As her breathing came easier she tried to pick herself up only for the arms holding her to help and steady her, her other helper was none other than Draco Malfoy who held her as she panicked. Turning a light pink she gave him a nod of thank hoping he wouldn’t notice the blush.</p><p>She was quickly pulled into familiar embrace that smelled of faded spicy cologne, motor oil and cigarettes making her relax into her godfather’s arms.</p><p>“Sirius?” She asked in a tremulous voice which broke slightly from her panic.</p><p>“It’s them, pup” he said in shocked grief trembling a bit.</p><p>While she dreamed of this moment, it was overwhelming and distressing to have them here with no warning in such a vulnerable position. But she would never forgive herself is she didn’t take the risk to get to know them, even if it was bad for her in the long run.</p><p>Pulling herself out of Sirius’s arms to face her greatest desire, her family, her biological parents that loved and sacrificed their lives for her.</p><p>“Fawn” her father said again, his voice sounding as if he yearned to have her in his arms but held back, but she didn’t as she ran to him and jumping into his arms he wrapped his arms around her and made a sound of relief.</p><p>“Dad” was all that came out of her mouth, but it was enough for her father to understand.</p><p>“It’s okay fawn, we’re here now” he said pulling his wife into the hug as she began to cry. </p><p>“Oh my darling Heli, you’ve grown so beautifully” Lily sobbed as she stroked her daughter’s hair holding her family close.</p><p>“I-I have so much to tell you, I don’t know where to start.” Helia stammered to her parent barley keeping from crying.</p><p>“Miss Potter, fret not for these books will help” said Dumbledore making Helia tense extracting herself from her parent as put her walls back up, making her friends who knew her well enough sigh at her paranoia.</p><p>“Then shall we begin” said Susan drawing the attention off Helia, she picked up the book the read <b><em>Heliantheae Potter </em><em>and</em><em> the Philosopher Stone </em></b>she opened the book that was supposed to be Helia’s life and secrets all wrapped up in a pretty bow from them to read. With a sigh, she braced herself turning to the rest in the room “so who goes first”. </p><p>“I will” Luna said whimsically as she took the book turning to the first chapter <em><strong>“The Girl Who Lived”.</strong></em></p>
