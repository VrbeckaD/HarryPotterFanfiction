    <p>“We need to protect ourselves.”</p><p>The statement was whispered by Lal Mirch, whose glowing pacifier lit an ethereal orange.</p><p>The rest of the Arcobaleno curse-bearers agreed in quiet voices.</p><p>Before Checkerface even thought to check and make sure the group was still there, inside the Giglio Nero mansion, they scattered to different parts of Italy.</p><p>Reborn – back to his job as a hitman, proving that even as a baby he was still a badass.</p><p>Lal – to a spying position in the Vongola; mostly so she could keep tabs on the others.</p><p>Colonello – back to COMSUBIN.</p><p>Fon – the triads. None would dare touch him there.</p><p>Viper – to the Vongola, changing her name in the process.</p><p>Verde – a lab in Florence.</p><p>And Skull?</p><p>He left the continent altogether, moving around with the circus before it changed. <em>He </em>happened to settle in a quiet town called Namimori.</p><p>Well… quiet before his lovely granddaughter found him.</p><p>~:~</p><p>Kagome wrinkled her nose. “Looking through all this crap isn’t helping much.”</p><p>“Be respectful! It’s your father’s belongings,” her grandfather chastised. Kagome pulled out an envelope.</p><p>“Yeah,” Kagome drawled, opening it. “My father’s belongings.”</p><p>A pin lay in it; Kagome took it out. The bell on the end of it rang.</p><p>She glanced at her grandfather, who was unboxing supposedly ancient items. Kagome took out the letter, expecting it to be a ‘dear love’ letter.</p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p>
  <em>Hikari,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I didn’t know until recently that you’d been born. I have one request: if your mother gave you the pin with the bell on it, please give your firstborn daughter this pin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If you don’t have a daughter, give it to their descendant. It’s important. They will be in danger if they don’t – even if you don’t believe me. Your firstborn will not be able to control her powers. This is a way to do so.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I regret that I have not been in your life. In truth it’s best that I stay away – if I come into your life, you will run the risk of dying in unspeakably horrible ways.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m not kidding. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your father Skull</em>
</p><p>Kagome arched an eyebrow.</p><p>~:~</p><p>Kagome spent three weeks finding her father’s family, then tracing her father’s father through his name. Not many people had the name <em>Skull </em>and matched the description of her estranged grandma’s baby daddy.</p><p>“Mama, is there a way I could go to Namimori?”</p><p>Mrs. Higurashi froze. “What?” She seemed genuinely shocked at Kagome’s request.</p><p>“I was helping Grandfather sort through some of Dad’s things,” Kagome said, glancing up at her mother’s surprised face. “I found a letter from our grandfather on Dad’s side. I wanted to meet him – luckily, he was easy to find.”</p><p>Mrs. Higurashi swallowed. “I’ll have to think on it,” she said hesitantly. “You do have finals to study for, and an entrance exam.”</p><p>“True,” Kagome replied. “I just…” Kagome set her fork down. “I can’t concentrate because I left Inuyasha and everyone else to die five hundred years in the past.”</p><p>Her words brought back the tension.</p><p>“If I can find something else, something to take my mind off of everything… I think I can take my finals and my entrance exam without worrying about them.”</p><p>There was a silence.</p><p>Kagome set her fork down and left the room.</p>
