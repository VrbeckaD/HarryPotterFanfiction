    <p>harry quickly cast an warming spell —bloody hell, it was a miserable cold night!. He sighed and tried to find hagrid. Since it night time everything was dark there. He was alone . he wouldn't be alone if Ron his only best friend was not jealous of him.he was sad that Ron didn't believe him.how could he. At least Ron have to know that he shared everything with him </p><p> There, he have to walked through  the trees and wet bushes, wondering what would be his first task be in the competition? He sit down on a tree brunch .</p><p>Harry stopped short in surprise.  What was ron doing here in the night.is he here to find where harry was. Harry sighed and stepped forward to make his presence known.Ron's normally shinny hair was wet and plastered to his head and looked much darker than usual -Harry thought. </p><p>"What are you doing here, Ron.did you finally believe that I was saying the truth all that time.which you didn't even believe after knowing me so well all those years ?" Harry asked and then mentally slapped himself for sounding so needy. </p><p> He waited for Ron to reply, but surprise at the response he received.</p><p>"I think." Ron's voice was quiet maybe from the cold. The proud shoulders were slumped and rad mark from the tips of his nose and ear from the cold. Something was obviously bothering the Ginger head.</p><p>Ron sighed ."can i sit down,harry I don't think hargrid will come anytime soon.because he is little busy with his girlfriend"Harry's gaze flicked to the small house visible in the valley below. </p><p>Harry patted the spot next to him and Ron   sat down next to Harry. The black hair teen was small,  forcing him to sit close to Ron to avoid falling off the tree edge. His hip and thigh rested against Ron's big thing and he felt the coldness from the other boys clothing seep through his clothes. Harry leaned back slightly so their shoulders were barely touching and braced his hand behind Ron's back. As an after thought, he pulled out his invisible cloth and cover them both.</p><p>"Thanks," Ron said not looking at Harry's face.</p><p>Long moments of silence ticked by, broken only by the sounds of the forest around them. Harry knew it would be a very long night.</p><p>"What's wrong?" he asked finally, even though he expected nothing because Ron has said nothing to him .at least not the reson why he was here in the night</p><p>but he was surprised when Ron spoke."I was looking for you. I thought you were alone so I look at the murdered map and saw you were here"Harry drew in a harsh breath and felt some wetness in his eyes

</p><p>"I'm sorry," Ron said sincerely. Rons shoulder moved against harrys and again harry feel the coldness .Harry reached into his robe and pulled out a silver flask. He unscrewed the cap and offered it to Ron. The blue eyes flked to his hand</p><p>"fred and gorge give it to me to celebrate my entry in the championship," Harry replied."Besides,You're cold—this will warm you. And anyway I wasn't going to eat it alone. Like I do anything without you"</p><p>"I'm not cold" ron said, but he took the flask and tipped it to his lips, taking a large swig of the brandy. He handed it back giving him a cheeky blush and Harry took a drink.</p><p> The alcohol burned its way down Harry's throat and settled into warm coals in his belly.They passed the container back and forth for a while until the liquid was gone. Harry felt very pleasantly tipsy.</p><p> When he put the flask away, his fingers brushed against a package. He pulled it out."Chocolate frog?" he offered but when Ron said nothing he unwrapped the frog.He broke it in half and handed ron his half.</p><p>They ate in silence and Harry commented, "You have something on your nose" It was a small dark spot.ron carelessly raised a hand and swiped at it. The spot disappeared, leaving a long streak of chocolate in its place. Harry stared at the smear and wondered if he should mention it. And He had the urge to reach out and wipe it away from the freckles skin</p><p>"Why are you looking at me, harry?"Okay, so he had not been quite surreptitious enough."Now you have chocolate on your cheek."ron rolled his eyes. "Remove it, if it bothers you.""You're giving me permission to touch you?"the other reason harry didn't gone to Ron or said anything to him was because he was gay he has told that to Ron a long time ago.and Ron took it in good way then harry thought he would</p><p>ron give him a nod and harry Without thinking it through, he leaned forward and ran his tongue over the chocolate stripe. He felt ron stiffen beside him and grinned."Mmmm, you taste good," he murmured, feeling strangely giddy and bizarrely turned on by his action.</p><p>Ron was astonished by the feel of harrys  tongue against his face. "Like chocolate, I suppose?" he said struggling for control. He felt harrys  tongue flick out twice more, sending a shiver down his spine</p><p>"No," harry whispered. "Better than chocolate."Ron  couldn't breathe. He turned his head to say—something, but Harry hadn't moved and rons lips brushed againsthis for a bare instant. Instinctively, he leaned forward and harry seemed to have the same idea, for suddenly their mouths were together and parting smoothly.</p><p>The tips of their tongues met and touched. Ron tasted Harry and knew he was right—it was better than chocolate.Harry tasted of brandy and chocolate and something uniquely different—the taste of Harry—that was hands above the others.And then Harry's arm was around Ron's back and his hand touched Ron's waist while the other dropped to his thigh and that was even better.</p><p>Ron found his own hands twisting in Harry's hair and it was so much softer than he thought. They devoured each other taste until the need to breathe forced them apart. </p><p>


Ron released Harry and felt harry hands slide away as they stared at each other for a shocked instant.ron looked away first, staring at the dark house . He swallowed hard.</p>
