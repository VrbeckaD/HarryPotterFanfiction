    <p>This was the last time, Remus told himself firmly as he marched up the entrance path to the shelter, the familiar stench of too many dogs hitting him suddenly as he stepped through the doors. This was the last time he was going to do this. Never again. He wasn't going to be made to go through this ordeal anymore.</p>
<p>"Mr Lupin, pleasure as always" greeted the woman behind the reception desk, wearing the same fur-covered fleece and thinly-veiled disapproving expression as she had on every one of Remus's previous unfortunate visits.</p>
<p>"Fifth time this month, isn't it, Jen? Does that make me a regular?" Remus figured he may as well attempt to add a little humour to the situation.</p>
<p>Judging by her unwavering frown, however, the kennel manager did not quite share his views.</p>
<p>"This is not a joking matter, Mr Lupin" she scolded in a tone that immediately took Remus back to the front of the oak desk in Professor McGonagall's office, being reminded once again that as a Prefect he ought to know better. "As you said yourself, this is the fifth time this month!"</p>
<p>Remus sighed and ran a hand through his hair awkwardly, trying to summon his pre-prepared excuses that had all sounded so much more acceptable at home a mere hour ago than they did now.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, it's just been so difficult recently, what with the works being done on the house... I told the builders to make sure the gate was shut... and that loose plank in the garden fence... I've been meaning to secure it for ages, I suppose it was only a matter of time before he-"</p>
<p>"Yes, well, whatever the circumstances, it simply needs to stop. This is a shelter, Mr Lupin, not a boarding facility"</p>
<p>"Well best we get this sorted out quickly then. I know the drill, just pass me the papers to sign, I'll pay up and we'll both be out of your hair"</p>
<p>Remus eyed the woman's fleece noticeably, raising one eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Or should I say fur?"</p>
<p>The woman's nostrils flared angrily for a second before she silently passed Remus the annoyingly-familiar reclaiming form, slamming a pen on top with an indignant sniff.</p>
<p>Remus breezed through the form quickly. He could fill the boxes out in his sleep by now, the only ever subtle change being the date box at the bottom beside his neat signature. Remus sighed as he filled in the final detail - 21/04/79 - precisely eleven days since his presence last graced this forsaken place.</p>
<p>"So that's just the usual thirty pounds reclaiming fee, please" said Jen briskly as she shuffled the completed papers in order.</p>
<p>Remus sighed and dug the money out of his pocket, handing it over through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Wait here, please"</p>
<p>Well he was hardly about to go off for a stroll around the gardens, Remus wanted to snap in reply.</p>
<p>He hated this place. The mingling smells of too many canines jumbled up together always made his wolf senses uneasy, not to mention the fact that the welcome he received from the manager was frostier each time.</p>
<p>He was just wondering to himself for the umpteenth time why in Merlin's name Padfoot seemed to enjoy spending time here when the mangy mutt in question suddenly bounded into view from behind a barred door across the waiting area, an enormous mass of silky black fur, his entire body seeming to wag with the force of his thick, feathery tail, the poor kennel worker accompanying him desperately trying to regain some control of her charge via the slip lead she was clinging to for dear life as she was dragged across the reception.</p>
<p>Unphased by the enormous dog charging towards him, Remus stood firm as Padfoot came practically jumped at him, tongue lolling excitedly, his bright grey eyes practically gleaming with joy. He looked for all the world as if he'd had the time of his life over the past five hours or so he had been at the shelter.</p>
<p>Remus wasn't joining in.</p>
<p>"No need to look so proud of yourself, old boy, you've caused enough trouble today as it is without adding this poor girl's injuries to the list"</p>
<p>He gestured to the struggling teenager at the end of the slip lead being wildly jerked about on the slippery tiled floor as the enormous dog attempted to run rings around Remus, shamelessly trying to goad him into giving him a much-desired scratch behind the ears.</p>
<p>"Not a chance" Remus said firmly as the dog shoved his head under his hand insistently. He jerked his hand away, hiding it safely inside his coat pocket.</p>
<p>With a low, disgruntled whine, Padfoot gave up on his lost cause and returned to the kennel girl, who, though clearly overwhelmed, giggled as Padfoot shamelessly leapt up to put his paws on her shoulders and began licking her face.</p>
<p>"He's always so friendly" she said between laughs.</p>
<p>"He picks his moments well" Remus interjected, noticing the large handful of treats bulging inside the girl's pocket.</p>
<p>As expected, the second the girl's hand reached for her pocket, the great mutt was back on all fours, sweetly nuzzling her curled-in fingers, the picture of innocence.</p>
<p>"I think he knows he's one of my favourites" the girl grinned fondly as Padfoot greedily snaffled the treats out of her hand.</p>
<p>"Oh he does" Remus replied shortly.</p>
<p>"Not that he should be here often enough for him to be a favourite" the ever steely-eyed manager added, throwing another side-glance at Remus, who resisted the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
<p>"So do you plan on coming home with me today or have you decided you'd rather stay here after all?" he called to the great black lump of a dog currently nuzzling the girl's treat pocket, ears laid back demurely, shamelessly begging for more.</p>
<p>His ears pricked up at Remus's suggestion, however. He turned on his heels, bounding back over to him, panting happily.</p>
<p>"Oh so you've decided I'm not so bad after all then?" Remus asked, looking down at him with one raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>Padfoot whined, rubbing his head against Remus's leg in reply.</p>
<p>"Oh he's so adorable" the kennel girl gushed as she gently slipped the rope slip off from over his head.</p>
<p>"I know" Remus replied, grasping Padfoot's collar tightly as the dog's entire body shook from the force of his wagging tail.</p>
<p>"And unfortunately, so does he"</p>
<p>"Do try to keep a better hold on him this time, Mr Lupin" said the kennel manager by way of a farewell. "As lovely as he may be, I'd rather we didn't see him again too soon"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, the feeling is very much mutual" Remus replied cheerfully as he clipped his own lead onto the dog's collar, hoping the generous helping of sarcasm came through in his tone.</p>
<p>Judging by the way the manager pursed her lips as they left, it had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm not doing it again, Sirius, I mean it this time!" Remus snapped as he shrugged off his coat as the front door closed behind them.</p>
<p>"Oh come on, it was worth it, did you see the look on that old cow's face as we left?" the newly-transformed Sirius laughed, stretching his arms above his head, a bit stiff after so many hours in dog form. "She looked like Snivellus chewing on a lemon!"</p>
<p>"Well I'm glad you find this so amusing because I don't. But then you're the one who gets the sweet end of the deal, sitting there being fawned over while I suffer through yet another lecture about not letting you get loose again. You realise I'm running out of excuses to explain how you keep ending up running wild?"</p>
<p>Sirius rolled his eyes in his usual typically dramatic fashion as he unbuckled Padfoot's collar from around his neck, hanging it up on the coat hook next to his leather motorbike jacket where it always hung when he was not transformed.</p>
<p>It was remarkable how a simple strip of black leather with a small brass tag could have once been the trigger of so much bickering between the two wizards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"It's the law, Sirius, all dogs have to wear one in public." Remus had said sternly as he held out the newly-purchased collar and tag bearing their address and phone number. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>After several threats to go out and purchase the offending item, threats which Sirius had brushed off as empty, he'd actually gone and done it. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I'd rather not pay a whacking great fine for having an unlicensed dog on top of paying the shelter reclaiming fee every other week" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What's the big deal? You know I always pay you back" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"And where will you be once you've blown your last galleon on paying Muggle fines? My work doesn't pay enough to keep us afloat alone, for all the hours it takes up. And besides, what if one day they take you somewhere I can't find you? Dogs are only held for seven days before being put up for rehoming, you know" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sirius shrugged. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"A few days being adored by a nice Muggle family before I run away and find my way back to you, sounds like a nice little holiday if you ask me" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Remus narrowed his eyes darkly at Sirius. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"You do understand what they do to dogs in shelters before rehoming them, don't you?" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The momentary look of confusion on Sirius's face as he met Remus's knowing look before he visibly paled with dread told him that he hadn't, but he certainly did now. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Alright, fine" he snapped impatiently, snatching the collar from Remus. "I'll wear the damn thing. Happy now?"</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Christ, Moony, what's the big deal? It's just a bit of fun" Sirius snapped, the humour now drained from his voice."It's not like I've got much better to do, anyway"</p>
<p>Remus sighed.</p>
<p>He knew Sirius was getting more and more frustrated with being out of action from the Order.</p>
<p>Just over a month and a half ago, the pair had been involved in an intelligence-gathering mission for Dumbledore that had gone less than desirably well. No casualties this time, thankfully, but thanks to a faulty batch of Polyjuice potion, it had resulted in the identities of them both almost being exposed to the Death Eaters they were impersonating. It should have been easy. There shouldn't have even been any Death Eaters in Knockturn Alley that day, let alone in Borgin and Burke's, if their spies were to be believed.</p>
<p>But there had been.</p>
<p>The pair had only just managed to escape to somewhere safe enough to Apparate with seconds to spare at most before being discovered.</p>
<p>Albus had frowned worriedly when they had relayed the evening's events to him back at headquarters.</p>
<p>"This is troubling, most troubling" he sighed thoughtfully, seeming to gaze off for a moment in thought. "I'm afraid I don't really see much choice in the matter... this will cause some inconvenience, but it is vital that neither of you are discovered to be members of the Order by the Death Eaters"</p>
<p>"You're not throwing us out are you?" Sirius demanded, immediately jumping to the worst possible conclusion as usual.</p>
<p>Albus chuckled a little at this.</p>
<p>"Heavens, no. But I will have to withdraw you from future Order missions for a while"</p>
<p>Sirius immediately opened his mouth to protest but was quickly silenced by both a nudge to his arm from Remus and a wave of the hand from Albus.</p>
<p>"It is vital to future plans that the identities of either of you are not discovered by either Voldemort or his followers. In hindsight it was foolish of me not to send you two out instead of some lower profile members, honestly. It certainly sounds as though it's unlikely you were seen, but I cannot take a risk here.</p>
<p>The wizard leaned forwards in his seat, his chin resting on his intertwined, spindly fingers.</p>
<p>"I need you both to lay low for a while"</p>
<p>"For how long?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"A month, maybe two to be safe"</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"You know I wouldn't ask it of you unless it were entirely necessary, Sirius"</p>
<p>Dumbledore's crystal blue eyes twinkled sternly behind his half-moon spectacles.</p>
<p>"The Death Eaters have been suspicious for a while that there is an organised movement working against them, led by me. Even if this information is confirmed to them, I want both of your identities left un-associated for as long as possible. Surely you of all people can understand the risks involved if certain Death Eaters were to discover your involvement with the Order?"</p>
<p>Sirius visibly stiffened.</p>
<p>It had been several years now since he had detached himself completely from his family, but the subject was still a sore one. His cousins Bellatrix and Narcissa were one thing; quite frankly he couldn't care less about what the vast majority of the House of Black thought of him or who he was working for.</p>
<p>However, he had taken the discovery that Regulus had joined the Death Eaters particularly hard, and had responded by uncharacteristically shutting down completely on the topic, flat-out refusing to discuss the matter with anyone, not even Remus, who automatically leaned in to squeeze Sirius's arm reassuringly.</p>
<p>"Alright" said the werewolf, speaking on behalf of them both. "We'll do it"</p>
<p>And so, Sirius had reluctantly backed down.</p>
<p>And so did they both from Order missions. Albus had advised the pair of them to greatly restrict the time they spent out and about in Wizarding London for the time being; the "out of sight, out of mind" approach, as he called it. Just in case.</p>
<p>He advised to cease all but absolutely essential visits to the Wizarding parts of the city until further notice.</p>
<p>"Until further notice", it soon became apparent, was far too long a length of time for Sirius to bear.</p>
