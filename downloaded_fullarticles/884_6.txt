    <p>Seventh Week of Seventh Year.</p><p>Despite the fact that it was at an ungodly time of one o'clock in the morning, Sirius and Harper were still awake. Their friends were long asleep; Remus had gone as far as to give them another verbal beating on the importance of organisational skills and especially so in seventh year before retiring to his dormitory barely past ten, and James and Peter had excused themselves for the presence of their beds at the early hour of eleven o'clock. Those cowards.</p><p>No, instead, the two friends were graced with the presence of stacks of books on books, scrolls of parchments littering the table in the Gryffindor common room. They were in fact up for Professor Slughorn's weekly test, as the both of them had neglected it for other commitments of greater importance – they thought the look on Haworth's face when he realised his hair was dyed a semi-permanent colour of hot pink was worth the effort of trying to sneak into the Ravenclaw common room (they only had to have 5 separate goes answering the riddles) for the past week, but here they were, nearly half past two, so who's to say it was worth it or not?</p><p>Though frantic they were in their minds, repeating lines from the offensively thick book about the uses of asphodel and the differences between its powdered and fresh usage and the reason why hemlock essence was added before tormentil tincture in doxycide, in the unlikely instance they were interrupted at this ungodly time, the intruder would be presented with a rather serene scene - the crackling of the dying fire, a few flickering candles and the occasional drip of its wax onto the common room floor, along with the rather annoying, though fortunately infrequent melody of Sirius' quill against the parchment. They would also see Harper's hunched figure over the large armchairs, her eyes only half opened, skimming over the miniscule text of the book, and they would see Sirius' hair rather unkempt – how appalling – after the hundredth time of him running his fingers through them out of frustration.</p><p>In such a lulling atmosphere, the air thick with the smokiness of the fireplace, it did not take much more for Harper's eyes to finally, blissfully, shut. Her head drooped over her cross-legged figure, and the musty book that she held escaped the grip of her slack hands, falling to the floor with a loud thud.</p><p>Sirius' tired eyes snapped in the direction of the offender of his peaceful silence, his eyes narrowing when he saw Harper's sleeping figure.</p><p>"Oh Godric," he only managed to mutter, hints of annoyance bubbling up in his stomach. Though really, it was for a good reason and for the best that he was still up studying, he would not have been if Harper had not insisted that she needed company. No, he would be in his bed, fast asleep. Now ironically, she was the one asleep.</p><p>"Harper."</p><p>He was met with only heavy breathing.</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, Sirius pushed his chair back, a sharp creak as the wooden leg of the chair rubbed against the floor, and he strode over to his sleeping friend. He kneeled, his face glancing up to her face, hidden dark over her hunched figure.</p><p>"Harper."</p><p>She remained irresponsive.</p><p>Growing more concerned than annoyed now, Sirius gently shook her shoulders, and to his relief, she stirred.</p><p>Harper's eyes were only just opened, and with what was the dim light from the candles reflecting off them, Sirius could see how exhausted she was. She blinked slowly, her eyes meeting his.</p><p>They were disorientated, heavy lidded, yet at the same time, staring at him strikingly and it made Sirius feel uncomfortable, a knot starting to grow in the pits of his stomach.</p><p>Diverting his gaze from her sharp gaze, his eyes left her heavy ones, tracing down her cheeks. Sirius was surprised to find that they were hues of pink – slightly reddish towards the corner of her cheekbone with a gradual transition towards a more muted peachy colour towards the centre of her cheeks. They were lighter than usual, and perhaps, Sirius thought, that it must have been the trick of the dim light. Intrigued, his eyes dropped lower, and yet again, he was pleasantly surprised. His eyes feasted on the interesting the curve of her upper lips, the colour - not too bright and glossy, but were just soft, pillowy, and inviting. He had not given much thought to them previously, and now, only barely inches from her face, he could make out the faint outline, and he could almost see the light outlines from the outer edges of her lips and how they draw him towards the light peeks of teeth.</p><p>Sirius liked them and thought they looked just right. He thought he could devour them.</p><p>It was then the feelings of disgust hit him. This was his Harper Adlicio he was talking about, the coolest and funniest person he knew, someone who was in contending with James for the position of his best friend. To regard her as one of those girls he would shag and then toss aside the next day (not that he would mind the shagging part, but he had to forcibly stop himself from thinking any further than this), it felt derogatory, wrong and insulting to their seven yearlong friendship.</p><p>But the why are her lips, currently the centre of Sirius' attention, leaning towards his? He could feel the growing hotness, heaviness of her breath on his lips and cheek, and in the spur of the moment, perhaps the fact that he was sleep deprived; Sirius did not push her away. Instead, his eyes involuntarily fluttered closed.</p><p>To say the least, he was definitely surprised to not meet Harper's warm lips. Instead, he was met with the unnaturally cold air, and to his right shoulder, the weight of Harper's head. His eyes snapped open and skirting to his right, he could see Harper's hair, curls of golden brown lying loosely on the head atop of his shoulder, her back heaving softly yet again.</p><p>That bastard was asleep again.</p><p>Was she even awake in the first place?</p><p>Sirius let her lay on his shoulder for a few moment as he processed the array of feelings running through his head at the exact moment. Lingering feelings of disappointment settled along with the tightening knot in his stomach tightening. Then came the confusion as he wondered why in Godric's sake he was even disappointed in the first place. Then came feelings of reassurance. In his defence, he was rather sleep deprived, and not just then, but also an accumulation of sleep deprivation from the past few weeks with James' incessant pestering to get up at 5 o'clock every morning for Quidditch practice.</p><p>"Come on," he murmured softly, pushing her upwards from his shoulder and leaning her against the armchair. The swift motion must have been suffice because Harper jerked awake suddenly, inhaling sharply and blinking several times, this time with a renewed sense of awareness.</p><p>"What time is it?"</p><p>"Far too late to be up," he replied smartly, helping her up from the armchair. "You should go to bed. Can you make it up the stairs by yourself?"</p><p>"I suppose," she murmured softly, "Night Sirius."</p><p>He watched her affectionately as she made her way, wobbling slightly, towards the entrance of the girls' dormitory, disappearing out of sight as she went up the spiralling stairs. The foreign feeling, whatever it was, was long forgotten, and now Sirius could only think to finish the mundane task of ordering the stacks and stacks of books, parchments and quills before he could finally retire to his warm bed.</p>
