    <p>“Do you want to play some chess?” Draco asked from Ron’s bed, lazily strumming his hand up and down his abdomen. His eyes were half –closed and his face was languid in the calm of the afternoon, head propped up on the headboard.</p><p>Ron grinned at the sight from his desk chair across the room. The two had been dating in secret for going on five months now. Nobody except for Harry and Hermione knew. Well, and Pansy and Blaise. But no one else. Although, if Ron was honest with himself, Ginny probably suspected that something was up with them. Besides his two best mates, she was the only of his siblings who even knew he was gay, although that was on accident. Nothing like walking in on your brother doing.. well, that, to a poster of Viktor Krum to make coming out obsolete. Ron had sworn her to secrecy and she’d been faithful in keeping it on the low.</p><p>Ron knew that he would have to tell the rest of his family at some point but he dreaded it. Telling them that he wasn’t dating Hermione anymore was hard enough, he couldn’t imagine how they would take him swearing off dating women all together, let alone that he was dating a Malfoy.</p><p>Even though Draco was now friends with the trio and relatively friendly with all the Weasley’s, echoes of the war still clung to his presence for some of the family. Especially George. Every time Draco would come round the Burrow to visit, George would get quiet and usually hole up in his room for the rest of the day. Ron’s chest would get tight watching him leave, knowing he was hurting and not being able to do much about it.</p><p>Beyond that, though, Ron was especially wary about coming out to George at all, Draco non-withstanding. Aside from his mum, George was the one he thought would take it the worst. His mum he could understand being upset. She always championed their big family, and there was sort of an unspoken pact she had made with all of her children that they would keep it growing larger and stronger. They may be a family of blood traitors, but they were still purebloods, and the obsession with the continuation of the Weasley name was always an undercurrent in their home. Ron’s being gay would seem to put a damper on that somewhat. Even if one day (far, far into the future) Draco and Ron were still together and decided to have a family, their kids wouldn’t just be Weasleys, they’d be Malfoy-Weasleys or Weasley-Malfoys, something Ron could see being somewhat of an issue for his mother.</p><p>But George didn’t care about the family lineage like that. It was more his incessant use of derogatory language and adolescent disgust that made Ron worried. One summer Ron was taking Harry up to his room to look at some Quidditch magazines to try and take his mind off of the whole Cedric ordeal when George called up from the bottom of the stairs ‘where you lot of poofs going?’ He was fifteen and still figuring things out, and all George ever did was call him ‘poof’ or ‘fairy,’ usually to make Fred laugh. Ron didn’t think that he knew anything, probably just teasing his baby brother, but it still made him feel ashamed. If he thought too hard about it, Ron could trace the last-stitch attempt to cling to heterosexuality that was dating Hermione for that month following the war back to the voice in his head which sounded like his brother calling him some jambled slur.</p><p>George would say some particularly colorful things about Draco especially, only when he thought no one who cared was listening.</p><p>Draco was the one who was actually <em>out</em>. Ron would have thought that with his parents being how they were that he wouldn’t come out for anything, but as Draco puts it, he went through so much during the war trying to be someone his parents would be proud of, now that its over he wasn’t going to keep on the same way. He told them he was gay fully prepared to be cut off and disowned, but was pleasantly surprised when his parents gave them their awkward, albeit sweet, declarations of support.</p><p>Ron envied him sometimes, but he never dwelled on it too long. Their days of rivalry were long past.</p><p>That started after the trials, when they went back to help with the repairs to Hogwarts. Draco, most likely feeling the need to pay Harry back for defending him and his family in the wizengamot, outstretched that same olive branch of friendship that he had all those years ago when they were eleven. It felt like a lifetime had past since Draco had first held out his hand to Harry, only this time Harry shook it, a small smile on his face. From then on he cornered Hermione and offered her his apologies for everything, the name calling, the prejudice, the violence. When she accepted it was finally Ron’s own turn to receive a Malfoy apology.</p><p>Ron was urged to accept from Hermione, and since he had felt guilty for recently ending things with her, he begrudgingly did as she asked. So it started with them all as friends, and then built up to Pansy and Blaise joining them at the table for lunch breaks too, and then Ginny and Luna would pop by, and Neville, Dean, and Seamus. Over the course of that Summer at Hogwarts, they were building more than just literal bridges.</p><p>Ron wouldn’t ever admit to it, but he did have a small crush on Draco before any of this happened. Something vague he could recall feeling fifth year that never got the chance to take shape, that Ron never fully acknowledged to himself. So it was almost inevitable that one night when everyone was sitting around the fire of the newly restored Gryffindor commons, laughing and talking, that things took a turn. The others had all gone to bed in the wee hours they occupied, but Draco and Ron had stuck around. One thing led to another, as it always does. Talking became whispering, sitting next to each other had become brushing knees. All of this lead to a head spinning kiss and two dopey expressions as the two boys said goodnight.</p><p>That had been five months ago.</p><p>They’d been dating ever since. It was strange how well they worked, how much they had in common. If Ron thought about it too hard, he might even say that he loved Draco. But lucky (or unlucky) for him, Ron tended not to think too hard about his feelings, he just acted on them.</p><p>“Ron!” Draco exclaimed again and the redheaded boy had to shake himself out of his thoughts.</p><p>“Hmm?” he tried to play it cool, and Draco gave an exasperated huff through the annoyed yet endeared expression on his face.</p><p>“Chess?” Draco asked again, quirking an eyebrow at his boyfriend. As he did so he continued the movements up and down his stomach. This caused a finger to catch at the hem of his shirt so that when his hand moved up again, it took the material with it, hiking up the garment to reveal the smooth plane of his hip and the soft tufts of golden hair at the edge of his trousers.</p><p>Ron blushed at the sight, and letting his feelings guide him without thinking, walked over and crawled on the bed with Draco, trapping the blond in between his legs.</p><p>“What are you doing?” the other boy asked, and Ron dipped his head down to show him, kissing Draco soundly.</p><p>“Chess can wait.” Ron laughed and kissed Draco once more, humming into his boyfriend’s mouth as he slipped a hand under his shirt, mimicking the earlier movements and gently caressing the warm skin.</p><p>They went at it for a good while, and were so deeply distracted by the other’s mouth that nether boy registered the sound of the door swinging open.</p><p>No, it wasn’t until they heard a gasped ‘oh’ that the two split apart to find Molly Weasley, eyes wide as saucers and mouth agape in the doorway, with Arthur Weasley silent behind her. Molly’s eyes darted between Ron’s blanching face and the blushing, sheepish expression on Draco’s.</p><p>“I-“ but before she could get a full other word out, Ron had disapparated, leaving behind a very awkward blond slowly moving to move a pillow from the left side of the bed into his lap.</p><p>Arthur put a hand on his wife’s shoulder, “I’ll go find him” he said in a voice attempting to be soothing before walking away.</p><p>Molly collected herself enough to look at Draco properly and ask, “Would you care to join me for some tea my boy?”</p><p>“Yes, please.” Draco replied gratefully.</p><p>Molly looked down to the pillow in his lap before meeting his eyes and smiling kindly, “I’ll give you a minute to collect yourself, you can meet me in the kitchen dear.”</p>
