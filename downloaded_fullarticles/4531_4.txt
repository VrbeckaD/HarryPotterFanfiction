  <p dir="ltr">here's a truth: mary will love lily for all of her days. she would rather die than change this.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily will never love mary like this, will never see her as more than a friend. this, too, is a truth.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary has long accepted this.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">(it still hurts; an ache that never leaves her bones.)</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily was not her first love; she did not even know lily until their fifth year. no, lily was not her first love. a girl by the name of viola clemens, tall and brunette, cruel and kind whenever it suited her, and who now left a bad taste in mary's mouth, took that place. she had been a slytherin, like mary, and mary had thought the world of her, until she had called mary a "lesbo freak". and that had been the end of that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">still, mary had been heartbroken for all that she was determined not to be. it had taken years, and practice, to not be. and lily. of course, lily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily. beautiful, reckless, kind, charming, lily. lily, with her dark red hair and her green eyes and her golden-brown skin.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">the recklessness, mary always told her, would get her killed one day; lily always laughed and wrinkled her nose, which made mary's heart stop.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"lucky i have you then."</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">(once, when mary had snuck up into the gryffindor girls' dorms, and they had been giggling under lily's covers, lily had told her a secret.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"i like you," lily had whispered, giggling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"you know, like <em>that</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary had blushed and changed the subject, and lily--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily had never mentioned it again. sometimes, mary wondered if she had imagined it. and then, lily had started dating james potter, who she had always despised and mary--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">well. she knew that was the end of it, when she saw the way lily looked at james. like he'd hung the stars in the sky. like she'd go to the ends of the earth for him. and mary understood. because she would do anything for lily, anything at all.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">it still hurt, though. a constant, never-ending burning.)</p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily's getting married. lily's getti--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>god.</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily's getting married, and mary cries every night and pastes on a smile every morning. she's the maid of honour, so she's very involved, and--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">she'd just hoped-- she'd hoped. after all those years of agonizing pining, she'd still had hope. it was ridiculous, and yet-- even now she hoped relentlessly. it hurt too much to give it up, even as it was killing her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">viola clemens. she hasn't seen her in-- god, years. yet here she is, in the bridal shop, looking smug as ever. and unfortunately beautiful.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"she's a lesbo freak, you know. a dyke." she jerks her chin in mary's direction, and mary, mary feels her face go hot.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">beside her, lily goes pale with anger.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"<em>don't </em>call her that," lily says fiercely, her eyes flashing. viola's mouth twists into an ugly sneer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"why not? it's just the <em>truth</em>. she was in love with me once-- she's probably in love with you, too, you know. it's sickening."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary's heart drops somewhere below her feet, and she gasps quietly. lily takes her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"mary is a lesbian," she says steadily, "but that doesn't make her a freak. people like you, on the other hand..." she trails off pointedly, and viola flushes blotchily. she doesn't look so pretty now.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily clucks her tongue pityingly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"you must be a very sad person, to be so cruel," she says coldly, and then she drags mary out of the shop.</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary breaks down on the day of the wedding.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily is so beautiful, her red, red hair is wild and free, and her muggle fairytale dress is so magical, and she's beaming, her eyes twinkling, her skin practically glowing in the summer sun.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">and she's so out of reach.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary has known this for years, but-- it's solidified now, harsh and painful. she feels like something's stuck in her throat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary's brushing on her mascara--lily had insisted on muggle makeup--when she begins to sob. it's quiet at first, and she doesn't notice until lily reaches up and brushes the tears from her eyes.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"it's going to be ok," lily says, but she seems sad, and mary shakes her head. she has to tell lily <em>now</em>. if she doesn't, she'll die.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"lily--" she sobs, "i love you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"i know," lily says, stroking her cheek. mary shakes her head again, capturing lily's hand and kissing it. the only tenderness she'll allow herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"no," she whispers, "i <em>love </em>you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily smiles at her sadly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"i know, mack," she says softly. she looks kind, loving, not disgusted or pitying. still, fear rips through mary, and she stumbles backward.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily stands, moving slowly forward, her hands up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"hey, hey," she says gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"mack, it's ok. it's gonna be ok."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary falls into her arms, convulsing with surpressed sobs, and lily strokes her hair tenderly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"it's gonna be ok," she whispers. she presses a dry kiss to her forehead. mary sobs all the harder.</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary smiles when lily walks up the aisle.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">(she catches herself dreaming that it's her that's waiting for lily at the end of the aisle, that it's her who will be bound to lily until death do they part.)</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">they look radiant together. they really do. james is grinning crookedly, nervously, down at her, his wife-to-be, and lily is beaming up at him. they're a picture.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">and if mary wipes away a tear, then, well.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">crying is quite natural at weddings, and no one is the wiser.</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily is dead. <em>lily is dead. </em><b>lily is dead.</b></p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <b>FUCK.</b>
  </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary doesn't cry. she feels empty, she feels numb. as she watches lily being lowered into the ground, james by her side, she feels as if she, too, is being buried.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">she might as well be. she might as well be dead. <em>she might as well be dead.</em></p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">it takes two weeks for the pain to set in and when it does--</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">everything crashes down. she howls, a ragged, animal sound, as she falls to her knees, tears at her skin, anything to <em>stop stop stop stop stop </em><b>stop</b> this pain that is ripping through her, burning burning <b>burning. </b></p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">she sobs and wails and screams until her voice is gone, and she weeps soundlessly until she passes out on the cold floor. in the morning, she cries some more, and then she gets up and goes about her day.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">lily would have wanted her to.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">she <em>has</em> to keep thinking that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>lily would want her to.</em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="center">
  <p dir="ltr">--</p>
  <p dir="ltr"> </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">mary will love lily for all of her days. she would rather die than change this.</p>
