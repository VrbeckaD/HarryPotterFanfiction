    <p>It was unusual for Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, to be forced to wait for others... For example, on dates young women would always come early. Everyone was ready to please The Boy Who Lived with their reliability and...well... devotion. </p><p>Apparently, his new Auror partner, Amelia  Lawrence, didn’t understand that the early bird gets the worm. He tapped his hand frustratedly on the wooden headboard at reception and turned, once again, towards the awestruck receptionist.</p><p>“Can you please confirm if she’s coming today? It’s been half an hour. That’s not very punctual,” Harry huffed.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, Amelia is coming all the way from France. It is possible that her portkey was delayed.”</p><p>Harry had run out of patience. He had been waiting for his replacement auror partner and roommate for over a month now. He was sick and tired of being cramped up in the office block to fill out mounds (upon mounds) of paperwork, forced to sift through legalese while his colleagues were out in the field. It was summer now, not too late to apply for the newly opened DADA teaching position. Maybe I should just give up and do that, he thought, miserably.</p><p>His previous partner, a couple years younger than him and fresh from graduation, had been too focused on studying the tactics of The Boy Who Lived to fight crime. The poor boy had ended up in St Mungo’s with awful injuries because he was too busy looking at the Saviour to defend himself. Harry still felt guilty. </p><p>At least Amelia didn’t seem to be devoted enough to Harry to turn up on time. Probably a plus.</p><p>He was distracted from his thoughts by a disturbing sound coming from the corridor as if the furniture was being ambushed. His mind, still plagued by horrors of the war five years later, associated the sound with a fight. Drawing out his wand he shuffled forwards, listening intently. A quiet moan of pain.  He knew he was probably overreacting. Perhaps someone walked into a table? But still, against logic, stupid savior instinct took over. In the pale blue room, Draco Malfoy was holding his hip in pain. However, based on the silent laughter of Cho Chang and Alex Riddle, who was a Ravenclaw in the year above at Hogwarts, Harry had suspicions that Malfoy hitting that table had nothing to do with clumsiness. </p><p>Cho Chang and Draco Malfoy were roomed together at the start of the year, something which, in Harry’s view, was evidently a mistake. Although Harry mused cynically, it was unlikely that any other aurors would have been nicer. Despite Malfoy being the victim, Harry’s guilt for unintentionally hurting his own partner turned to anger at Cho. He couldn’t imagine hurting his own auror partner intentionally, it seemed both irrational and disgusting, especially after his years of abuse with the Dursleys. </p><p>Harry stopped thinking straight. </p><p>He shot a stone cold look at Cho Chang and the Ravenclaw,  grabbed Malfoy by the wrist and pulled him out of the room.<br/>
In the corridor, Harry’s outrage broke loose.</p><p>“What was that about?” He demanded. </p><p>“Nothing. Leave me alone.” Malfoy was turning away and walking towards the men’s room. Not knowing what to do, Harry stayed still for a second before following him.</p><p>“Look, Malfoy, those two obviously jinxed you into falling into that table. I’m not stupid.” Harry’s voice held a genuine concern, which shocked Malfoy.</p><p>“Could have fooled me.” He sneered, despite his desire for comfort. </p><p>“Does this kind of behavior happen frequently?” Malfoy huffed. Honestly, did Potter not know when to stop? He turned on his heel and took Harry by the shoulders, looking into his eyes.</p><p>“Okay, sure, it happens. It’s perfectly fine though. I deserve it. Yes, I get hexed sometimes. Yes, Chang does it frequently. But what else should I expect? I regret being a death eater, of course, I do, but I’m responsible for so many bad things. If I had managed to be stronger, to fight my father’s politics then I would have saved everyone so much trouble. Think of the people who would still be alive. Cho has a right to be angry at me. My families allegiance cost her Cedric. She liked him so much and I wouldn’t blame her for hating me. Anyway, this particular instance it was actually Alex Riddle who hexed me. I’m fine though.” He stayed looking sadly at Harry, then turned around and walked away.</p>
