          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry woke up face down in a puddle of drool with a pounding headache.</p><p>"Happy new year," he muttered into the pillow.</p><p>He tried to keep his eyes open but they seemed to be glued shut. When he finally managed to get them to stay open, two things became apparent.</p><p>He was naked. In someone else's bed.</p><p>That's when he heard the singing. </p><p>He looked toward what was presumably the bathroom, cringing slightly when the singer finished her tune more than a little off key.</p><p>The water—and the singing, thank Merlin—stopped but before Harry had decided whether to pretend he was asleep or Disapparate, a naked woman walked back into the bedroom.</p><p>"Oh, you're awake."</p><p>Luna. </p><p>Something in him relaxed with the knowledge. It could have been far worse.</p><p>"Morning," he said, sleepily.</p><p>"I didn't want to wake you," she said drying her hair with a towel, breasts fully on display. They were lovely ones, too. </p><p>"I should probably head home." Harry started to get out of bed but Luna put a hand to his chest, stilling him.</p><p>"Don't be silly, Harry. You are home." She held up her left hand and he gaped. "Now that we're married."</p><p>He then looked down at his own hand and saw a matching band. </p><p>"I've always thought a husband and wife should start the day with a vigorous round of intercourse," Luna said as she dropped the towel and pulled the blankets back. "Do you think I should ride you? You did all the work last night."</p><p>Harry sucked in a breath as Luna straddled him, her hand around his cock bringing him to instant hardness. </p><p>"Oh, <i>fuck</i>."</p><p>He had no idea what had happened the night before, whether they were actually married or not, but he'd sort that out later.</p></div>
