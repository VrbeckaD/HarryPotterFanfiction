    <p>Tom knew this would happen. Dumbledore, the old coot, had been against him every step of the way, so why would this be different? For years he had kept his plan to interview as the Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, close to his heart. Only a few people knew. All of them were in his inner circle. <br/><br/>He had watched Armando Dippet, that love drunken fool of a headmaster, ignore Merrythought’s very obvious decline in mental health, without doing anything for over a year. So why would Dippet take action now?</p>
<p>Merrythought wasn’t doing any worse than she did at the end of winter break. Tom Riddle made sure of that. He had planned his spells meticulously. They had already sustained her for at least six months now and he had needed her to last at least a year more.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a new year, the Christmas holidays were just behind him, when his most important scheme was crushed, without as much as a warning. <br/><br/>Hogwarts had been his recluse from death and despair, from loathing and being loathed. From fear and from the horrors of the war. He felt safe here. He knew he could rule here. He already did.</p>
<p>He was halfway through with his sixth year of Hogwarts when the news reached him. They had employed a new Defense teacher. <br/><br/>He was supposedly very young and would start within the week, but he hadn’t been able to get any more information about him. In addition to that, his head of house had also announced that he’d be taking on an apprentice, who wanted to make his mastery in potions, which had already been bad news on its own. <br/><br/>Slughorn was easily influenced and charmed when alone, however, in front of people he wanted to impress, the man knew better. The old withering fool was a lot of things, but he wasn’t one to miss an opportunity to boast. So, asking him about his newest project, could turn out to be increasingly difficult with the added distraction to his professor.</p>
<p>Tom knew this shouldn’t bother him. Last year he had found out about his relation to Salazar Slytherin and found the chamber of secrets, now he had a plan that would grant him immortality. These little inconveniences were nothing to him. <br/><br/>Besides, if the new Defense Teacher was as young as everybody said, he’d be easily manipulated and if not, there were other ways to get rid of pesky teachers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Harry Potter just wanted to be fucking done with it. He’d reached the point of no return and he was ready to tell any- and everyone, who would listen, all about it.</p>
<p>So, you managed to kill an evil overlord and what happens? The ministry launches a fucking investigation against you.<br/><br/> All of that only happened, because of the ‘multiple accounts of breaking and entering’ (especially in regards to Gringotts), the unlawful use of Polyjuice and finally the claiming of an heirloom home, Sirius Black’s home, without proper proceedings. All in all it was concluded that the property damages were worth millions.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Ron had grown pale when he’d read through their accusatorial. Everyone was well aware that there was no way that you could put Harry Potter or any of his entourage in jail without causing a riot. However, the ministry was not above ruining their lives.<br/><br/> They buried them under forms and regulations, that were so harsh, they might as well go to Azkaban. However, not to fear there, was a helpful alternative to the life full of debt with an extensional criminal record!</p>
<p><br/> Harry and his friends were looking at right now.<br/><br/> They could employ with the ministry.<br/><br/> Of course, they would be expected to promote the good it was doing now; – “Where?” Harry had asked exasperated, the first time they had this conversation; and bury the bad it had caused over the years.<br/><br/> If they agreed, they'd get a life contract that would bind them to the ministry for as long as they were able to work but all charges would be dropped against them. They had a week to decide. <br/><br/>It was blackmail, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Harry thumbed his head against the wall of the small alleyway, he was leaning against. He’d had to run, because the moment they’d stepped outside the ministry they were swarmed by paparazzi. Ron, Hermione and he had a deal, when it came to paparazzi it was every man for himself.<br/><br/> They learned that one the hard way. <br/><br/>Going out together in public had become more or less impossible for them and none of them appreciated the attention.<br/> They were still healing. <br/><br/>They had been on the run damnit, they had been hunted down for almost a year, before the war had come to a head at Hogwarts. Sadly, now the constant feeling of being watched wasn’t just some weird symptom of their PTSD, it was their new reality.<br/><br/></p>
<p>It’s been two months since the end of the war and Harry could confidently say that he hated his life.</p>
<p>Hated it.</p>
<p>He couldn’t openly be with the person he loved. Hadn’t been able to at Hogwarts, and for sure wasn’t now. <br/><br/>He couldn’t help Draco. Had never been able to. Not really, not in a way that mattered.<br/><br/> Draco would give him shit for thinking like that, but Harry knew that this was true. Hogwarts had been their only solace from the world and even there they had to pretend to hate each other to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>Draco’s father would have killed him, if he had known. <br/><br/>No one besides Hermione, Ron and Ginny knew about them. <br/><br/>Hermione and Ron basically knew since the beginning and they tried to help him every step of the way.<br/><br/> Ron, who Harry would forever be thankful for, had made it his life mission to make sure the world thought that he hated Malfoy and that helped them a lot. Because try as they might they gravitated towards each other.<br/><br/> When Ginny had found out, by catching them in the midst of one hot and heavy make out session in one of the abandoned classrooms, she’d immediately agreed to support them and front as the girlfriend.</p>
<p>All in all, Harry logically knew that they had gone to insane lengths to keep their relationship a secret, however, he’d never guessed that they’d be so good at it. <br/><br/>It was as Ron would put it, incredibly ironic because at this point people were doing their work for them. If Harry looked at Malfoy too long, people thought Malfoy was about to get challenged to a wizard duel.</p>
<p>But Ron knew Harry was trying really hard not to check out Draco’s ass, so he smirked. <br/><br/>Now everyone saw a smirking Ron and a staring Harry and instead of the tease it was, all they saw was the imaginary mutual hate they both held for their eternal rival. Who’s demise they simply must be plotting right now. Merlin.</p>
<p>If he was being honest, he could have probably dealt with the attention or the ministry or his friends not being able to meet him in public anymore.<br/><br/> He could have dealt with all of it. He’d still be pissed as hell and going on about it, but he could have pulled that off, either way.</p>
<p>What he couldn’t handle was the fact that the world had put him in a closet again.</p>
<p>That he couldn’t openly be with the person he had been messily in love since their third year of school, which felt ages away.</p>
<p>That Draco could not simply live his life. His parents and every other former death eater hated him deeply for letting Harry get away and the public despised him for the deeds of his father and let’s not kid ourselves, some of his own.</p>
<p>It often boiled down to Draco these days. He lived with him, had since the night Voldemort died. Secretly of course and the worst part was that Draco wasn’t even bothered by it.</p>
<p>Harry was going nuts over the fact that Draco had not only been denied the chance to find any sort of employment, but was now also regularly harassed when he tried to go somewhere. Draco said it didn’t bother him. He was honest when he said that, too. He was just happy that he got out of his childhood home, out of his oppressive ‘friendships’, away from the darkness.</p>
<p><br/> -</p>
<p><br/>He’d burned the dark mark away that same night, he went to Harry to stay with him. <br/><br/>Silently crying in their bathroom. <br/><br/>“I did it for my mom.” He whispered brokenly.</p>
<p>“I know.” Harry had tried to sooth, but he could only look at the shiny, red welled flesh that had replaced the tattoo. <br/><br/>He’d burned it out with magic so dark it would take ages to heal, if it ever really healed at all. <br/><br/>“I hate that you are hurt. On you that mark only ever stood for your bravery.” He kissed the hand he was holding on to, before sliding down against the tiles so he could sit next to Draco. His side pressed against the other mans.<br/> “You did it to protect the people you love and to me that will always speak of your strength.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed deeply, before he buried his face in’s Harry neck. Harry didn’t comment on the tears and just stroked his boyfriend’s hair gently. <br/><br/>“I couldn’t bear it anymore.” Draco whispered brokenly.<br/><br/> And Harry nodded as he looked down on his hands, the left sported ‘I shall not tell lies.’ and the right matched it with ‘I will not break rules.’.<br/> Curtesy of Umbridge the crazy bitch. His gaze lingers on the bitemark from Nagini on his left forearm, the scars from the basilisk’s tooth on his right.</p>
<p>“Our bodies tell the stories of the battles we’ve won. These are marks left over by the shit we’ve overcome. They show our strengths, not our weaknesses.” He murmured into Draco’s hair. <br/><br/>“I’ve overcome this.” Draco agreed, breathing tiredly.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/></p>
<p>Thinking back to that night Harry shook his head and apparated home, to share the news.</p>
<p>By the time he was done, he had run his hand so many times through his hair that it stood on end, while Draco calmly sat on their couch, potions book in his left hand, watching Harry pace nervously, while drawing up one eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You could pay your way out of it?” <br/><br/>“My funds are being monitored because Gringotts reserves the right to take what they need from them for the repairs. They will be completely confiscated by the ministry, the moment I agree.”</p>
<p>“You could also use my money? I have three different cells that I can access freely.”<br/><br/> Harry looked at him for a moment before shaking his head. “They don’t want me to be able to pay my way out of it. It’s a conspiracy. It won’t matter how much money I have, because they’ll just ask for more. The goblins are obviously in on it. Probably trying to use the whole thing to their advantage… They’d know if you paid my debt and that would instantly blow our cover.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded. “Would that be so bad? To acknowledge this?”</p>
<p>Harry stared at him for a moment. Before he whispered, voice heavy with emotion. “I’d marry you in a heartbeat if it wouldn’t kill you. If people knew you were double crossing Voldemort, every death eater that is left over will come for you. They already hate you because you ‘accidently’ let me escape. If they knew… I’m not saying we’ll keep this a secret forever and I hate doing it now, but with the current climate you’d be dead within the week. They are desperate.” He shuddered to think about what could happen.</p>
<p>Draco had moved closer during his rant and pulled him into a kiss. Soft and slow while carding his hands through Harry’s hair.<br/> The kiss means everything. It means Draco is accepting his reasoning. It means that Draco isn’t agreeing with him, because he feels defeated, but rather because he makes sense. Harry leans into it and gives as good as he gets.</p>
<p>When they finally pull apart, they are breathing hard. There’s a moment just before Draco pulls Harry into their bedroom, where Harry isn’t sure if they shouldn’t talk this out.</p>
<p>He didn’t know if he needed to assure Draco, if he himself needed assurance, because he had basically just proposed, but then Draco grabbed his butt with a devilish smirk and the moment was broken. Harry’s smile spread slow and wide on his face, as he followed his love upstairs.</p>
<p>The rest of the night was spent in bed, with softly spoken I love yous, accompanied by pleasure, reassurance and reaffirmation that they are good. <br/><br/>That even if it all goes to shit, this part of them still works.</p>
<p>They looked at the pieces and rebuild each other, the way they'd always done. It was as good a prayer as any.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>___________________________________o.O.o___________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione visited them the next day. She carried a small package with her and a determined look on her face. The moment she was through the door she locked it behind her. But before he could ask, she slightly shock her head. After she’d cast every spell he’d ever known to deter listening in, she nodded and sat down at their dining room table, placing the small parcel carefully on top.</p>
<p>“I have found something that could give us peace.”<br/><br/> Draco snorted. “This sounds like a suicide pact waiting to happen.”<br/><br/> Hermione bumped their shoulders together and grinned conspiratorially. “I’m not sure it isn’t.”<br/><br/> “Sounds great.” Harry replied dryly as he eyed the parcel cautiously.</p>
<p>“I’ve been researching solutions to our dilemma. I mean it’s not like we’ll be able to live our life the way we want, right?”<br/><br/> “That much is obvious.” Draco agreed easily.<br/><br/> Hermione nodded as she opened the parcel and revealed a small golden pendant that was eerily reminiscent of the time turner, she’d had… <br/><br/>“Hermione, no! Bad things happen to wizards who mess with time.”<br/><br/> Hermione looked exasperated. “This isn’t just some modified time turner. It’s a returner.” <br/><br/>Draco’s grip tightened around his cup of tea as he stared at her in wonder. “How did you get this?”<br/><br/> “Nicholas Flamel requested a meeting a few days ago, concerning something Dumbledore had left for us. I didn’t really think anything of it, but after we met, I did my research, and everything checks out. This is a returner.”</p>
<p>“What does it do?”</p>
<p>Draco answered before Hermione could, his voice barely a whisper,</p>
<p>“It sends you to a point of no return. It’s a fixed place in time and it destroys everything you leave behind. If we use this, we give up on our reality completely. It banishes all that ties you to this future. The best part: because it’s not meant for travel and the sorcerer can’t pick the date themselves, it doesn’t register as a time travel device.”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded enthusiastically. “Not only that but it’s been widely regarded as blessed by fate, because only a few people are able to use it. So, if it lets you travel, it must be fate.”</p>
<p>Harry groaned. “Yeah, so I’m not risking that. I’d rather continue on the way things are, than lose everybody I’ve ever loved to another time without any way to reach him.” <br/><br/>Hermione shook her head again. “Look at the inscription.” <br/><br/>He nodded as he carefully took the little device in his hands.</p>
<p>The names ‘Draco Malfoy’ ‘Harry Potter’ ‘Hermione Granger’ and ‘Ronald Weasley’ were neatly engraved into the mysterious device.</p>
<p>He stared at it for a long time. “This would break Ron’s heart. He loves his family more than anything.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him in disbelief. “Yes, and that’s exactly why he wants to do it. He wants to give his family the chance to live. To survive.”</p>
<p>He stared at her, before he nodded.</p>
<p>Draco pinched the bridge of his nose before he asked, “Do we have any way of knowing where we’ll end up?”</p>
<p>Hermione turned grim at that. “We don’t. That’s how it works. We have to trust it to know what’s best.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head slowly. “Mark my words Hermione, this is just another mission. We just went through hell and now he wants us to what? Meet the young Dark Lord and help him find love?” </p>
<p>Hermione laughed. “Whatever happens, happens. I guess. I’m just over this. I want to start feeling like my own person again. I want to be able to go outside without people swarming me. I want to be able to choose for myself. I want more for all of us and I think this is a chance. Yes, it’s dangerous and it’s completely uncharted territory. But god is it worth it, if it just gives us the ghost of a chance to live like we want to. To be free.”</p>
<p>Draco slowly nodded. “We are going to need all the money we have and we’re going to get fake birth and school certificates. I know where we can get those without a time stamp, actually. If we’re really going to do this, we need to go into it as best prepared as we can.”</p>
<p>Hermione and Harry stared at him for a few seconds, as if estimating how serious he was, before Harry turned to Hermione with a tight smile. “Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>It ended in a group hug. When Ron came around later, they made dinner together and talked about wicked scenarios in which they’d end up in the time of the roman empire. They knew they were being silly, but it felt good to have that luxury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day they were all brimming with enthusiasm and energy. Draco was put in charge of getting the identification. He’d get them through his mother, who still had a lot of pull with certain ministry members.</p>
<p>Hermione was put in charge of getting their assets in order. She made a list of how much money each of them had and how they could go about getting access to it. Hermione and Ron didn’t have nothing, but it was of little importance if compared to what Harry had stowed away, who in turn, paled when he saw what Malfoy had at his disposal.</p>
<p>They’d claim medical emergency. The goblins had to open up the safes for that one. No way around it. In the meantime, Harry could use the tiny bag he had once bought from the goblins to gain unlimited access to his vault. They’d only need a hot minute to leave his vault empty. Malfoy would withdraw everything in person around the same time and he’d be escorted by Ron, who’d be in disguise, posing as an auror. If Gringotts believed the ministry would claim the assets of the Malfoy heir, they’d be all to happy to oblige. The ministry would owe them and that was worth a lot these days.</p>
<p>Ron’s focus was set on getting as many wizarding family trees as he could possibly find. They wouldn’t claim any connection to the obvious ones, but a missed cousin here and a runaway brother there, could make a lot of things easier.</p>
<p>They decided early on that they wouldn’t alter their appearances, no matter what. It only took one forgotten glamor to lose trust build over months, years even. They’d find a way to explain what needed explaining and hide what they could.</p>
<p>It took them the whole week to get everything sorted.<br/><br/> Under different circumstances they would have done most of their research in advance. This way however they just gathered what they could and tried to get a general idea. There was nothing more they could do, really.</p>
<p>Their personal deadline was significantly influenced by the time frame the ministry had given them to ‘make a choice’ regarding their ‘job offer’.</p>
<p>However, the moment they all stood in their respective spot, bags strapped to their backs, they knew that this was what they needed. If they couldn’t enjoy their life here, they’d just throw themselves at the next big adventure.</p>
<p>Draco laughed openly at the face Harry made, when he realized that he stood in an especially deep mud pile. <br/><br/>They’d apparated to a remote collection.<br/><br/><br/> They now stood on something akin to a field that had been left barren for the past few hundred years. It was as safe a bet as any.</p>
<p>Hermione looked positively giddy as she took out the returner out of her pocket. <br/><br/>The old magic felt tangible in the air. <br/><br/>Almost like fate.<br/><br/> Harry had never felt like this before. This belonging. <br/><br/>This feeling that he was untouchable. Ron must have felt it, too, if the face splitting grin was anything to go by.<br/><br/> Draco stood arms wide open, face turned towards the sky and let out a scream of elation. <br/><br/>They all smiled at that. <br/><br/>What a broken mess they were, didn’t matter where they were headed.<br/><br/> Heroes weren’t made they were broken in. </p>
<p>Before anyone could do anything else, the artefact started glowing and spinning, the air thickened around them, there was a sudden pressure that snapped away, just before it became truly uncomfortable, a final flash of light and then they were off.</p>
<p>The sensation was close to a portkey but ten times worth. When they landed on the plot of unused land, it didn’t look much different, then it had in their time, which was interesting. However, what did look different were the fighter jets they could see from afar.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped as she stood up on shaky legs, clutching at Ron, who looked like he was a second away from hurling. Draco took in the situation, nodded and said “Diagon Alley. Now.” They all agreed.<br/> Moments later they were there, judging by the clothes Harry sighed deeply. He knew this, had seen this before. In memories. “Let’s go to the leaking cauldron.” Everyone agreed.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they sat around a much better-looking table with an overenthusiastic and dynamic Tom serving them. Harry had secured the paper. Ron was giving their order. Draco leaned against Harry, still somewhat out of it after the returner. Who’d vanished upon arrival.</p>
<p>“We arrived in the midst of another war. This time it’s a muggle one.”</p>
<p>“Well shit, who’d have thought?” Draco supplied, sarcasm only slightly muffled against Harry’s shoulder. <br/><br/>“We arrived in November of the year 1943, people.” Hermione grunted.</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “So, exactly 3 months prior to Tom Riddle creating his first Horcrux. That’s not a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“What do you want us to do? Infiltrate Hogwarts and stop him?” Draco muffled against him. <br/><br/>There was shocked silence all around.</p>
<p>“I mean we would have to do an impeccable job at forging our documents, when we apply to work with children.” Ron said, clearly feeling torn.</p>
<p>Hermione just stared thoughtfully at the date. “We’d be able to prevent it all.”</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Gryffindors. Don’t need to infiltrate Hogwarts for that. Just go and kill him, before he becomes a problem. It’s not like you haven’t done it before, except this time it’s over in an afternoon. There, fixed it.” He was still snuggled against Harry’s side, so the words came out a little muffled.</p>
<p>“Harry, I don’t know if you knew this, but you have a bad case of homicidal cuddle bug.” Ron said, sounding mildly perturbed.</p>
<p>Harry snorted and replied, dryer then the desert. “Who knew?”<br/><br/> Draco was now silently laughing, when it hit him.<br/><br/> They could sit together as a group of friends and nobody disturbed them. They could be affectionate with each other in public.</p>
<p>Wizarding London had never outlawed gay marriage. They could get married tomorrow. His arm snaked around Draco and he forcibly pulled him in for a moment. Squeezing him and earning a slightly disgruntled yelp for that.</p>
<p>Hermione laughed at their open display of affection, while Ron just smiled warmly. His best friend didn’t have to hide anymore.</p>
<p>“Let’s try and prevent him from making his first Horcrux. If he does it, we’re killing him, before he gets a chance to do more.” Harry suggested.</p>
<p>“That’s actually not a bad idea. Especially with what you told me on how Dumbledore treated him as a kid.” Ron agreed. “But if we can’t get through to him, it’s safer to kill him, before he escalates.” He concluded and Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>Draco looked down at Harrys hands before saying, “If we do this, we need one of us in a teaching position at Hogwarts. We also need eyes in Hogsmeade and an official auror.”</p>
<p>“Going by the time period I think it’s safe to assume that I wouldn’t have the best of luck going in as an auror.” Hermione answered dejected.</p>
<p>Draco and Ron nodded guiltily as Harry contemplated how to go about this. “Horace is the one he confronts about Horcruxes. So, we’ll need someone, who can shadow him. Draco how’d you feel about doing your mastery in potions? So, you can later apply for a teaching position?”</p>
<p>Draco nodded before adding, “If you apply as a new Defense Against the Arts Teacher, I’m in.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled slowly and nodded. “Hermione in Hogsmeade, preferably working at the Three Broomsticks, keeping an ear open for gossip and Ron as the auror?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it. I have plenty of time to read and research that way and Ron can get onto cases and see how far the infiltration goes from inside the ministry. Even if I don’t think there’s much happening there yet. We’ll have to nip that in the bud, before it gets a chance to escalate.” Hermione concludes, before looking at Ron, waiting for his answer.</p>
<p>Ron musters everyone on the table. “We’ll invest two years in this. Seeing if we can save him, but after that, I want us to focus on our own lives. We have sacrificed enough already.”</p>
<p>They nodded at each other in silent promise. Then a thoughtful glance from Hermione, was followed up by the assertion. <br/><br/>“So, we are going to need to work on your occlumency Harry.” <br/><br/>A huge smile spread on Draco’s lips, before he started laughing. “We really, really don’t.” He snorted as Harry blushed, with his head ducked down.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it’s a little weird that Snape never knew that Harry and I were together?”</p>
<p>Hermione stared at Harry before she gasped. “No!”</p>
<p>Draco chortled. “Yes! After the ministry, I made him learn it. He hated me for weeks before we worked it out.”</p>
<p>“That… I just thought you two needed time together after what had happened.”</p>
<p>She looked a little lost, before her eyes focused on Harry and she started chiding him enunciating every word with a hit to his shoulder. “You. Had. Me. Worried. For. Weeks.”</p>
<p>Harry, who looked really sheepish, by now. “I’m sorry. I didn’t trust Snape not to break down my barriers, if he noticed I could do it, you know? I expected him to search for what I was trying to hide. So, I gave him everything else, instead. Launching it at him all at once made him remarkably angry, so everything I said about his lessons being horrendous was still true.”</p>
<p>She nodded amicably. “One problem less to worry about I guess.” Harry nodded.</p>
<p>The next hour was spent discussing their respective backgrounds. They had weeded through the history books and found a French city that had been completely eviscerated by Grindlewald. There had been a lot of old and new wizard families. They would claim relation to the ones that had been eradicated.</p>
<p>Harry would claim a lose relation to a distant branch of the Potters that had lived there. They went by Graves, which would make him Harry Graves, Master of Death.<br/> His decision was accompanied by manic laughter from Draco, the asshat.</p>
<p>The tables turned quickly, when it was decided that Draco should claim the Vane name, which Harry insistently kept mispronouncing as ‘vain’.</p>
<p>Ron looked at them in fascination, before concluding “You two idiots truly deserve each other.” <br/><br/>Since Hermione and Ron would pose as a married couple and the Davies had a branch of family in the city that they’d broken off contact with, a long time ago, Ron would claim their name and Hermione would in turn take on his.<br/><br/> No one would dare pressure a young woman into laying open her heritage when she had the scarring word Mudblood still pinkly ingrained into her forearm. They’d just look at it as another one of Grindlewald’s horrid crimes. Small mercies.</p>
<p>Relations established, and papers forged, their first order of business was Gringotts. <br/><br/>After making it clear, that they wanted to be handled as a family, they were given one of the bigger vaults Gringotts had to offer for their fortune. Each of them got a small money pouch that could access the vault, and that was that.<br/><br/> The goblins had accepted their papers without batting an eye. Truth be told they were official ministry papers, just filled out by themselves. So there, was truly no reason not to accept them. They were now official. Smiling they made their way to a seamstress. <br/><br/>Hermione especially, needed age appropriate clothing, people were looking, and attention was the last thing they needed.</p>
<p>Hermione looked adorable in her outfit and they all knew it, but heaven forbid one of them said a word, by the looks of it they’d be put into a coma the moment she got her hands on a book heavy enough.<br/><br/> Her attire was made up of four elegant pleated over the knee skirts (because you can’t run in the tight ones, Ron) and tight dress shirts with Peter Pan collars. She also got a few snugly fitting cardigans to wear over them and a long dark grey winter coat that covered her skirts completely.</p>
<p>Ron and Draco got themselves tightly tailored black dress pants. Ron added a few different colored finely knit sweatshirts and a few simple T-shirts, because he wouldn’t need to dress up much for his job.<br/><br/> Draco bought some light blue fitted dress shirts and a lot of light grey vests to put over. He could always come back, but he liked that style the best. The style put a nice emphasize on his lean trim figure.</p>
<p>Harry went a similar route. He bought tightly fitted, the wizarding world never really got the trend of lose clothing, well except for cloaks, dark jeans, skipped the sweaters completely and bought just a lot of dark grey dress shirts, instead.</p>
<p>Where Draco and Ron opted for sensible black dress shoes, Harry went for soft soled leather combat boots, that he could pull over his pants without a problem. <br/><br/>He had seen a few wizards wear combat boots already and could only guess that they’d need them when they tried to walk through the rubble in London.<br/><br/> The dress shirts were also well in style and the jeans could be explained away as a European quirk or something.</p>
<p>He just hated the feel of dress pants. Always had. They had been the bane of his existence as a Hogwarts student, because they were too soft and delicate. <br/><br/>With the way his life had gone he went through the pairs like other students went through their toothbrushes. Not being able to spend money on clothes he actually wanted to wear most of his life, but being forced to replace the nice but susceptible school uniform every other month, had been grating on him for so long, that he would have happily opted for leather pants, if he’d been given the option. <br/><br/>Simply because of the durability.</p>
<p>Done with the shopping Draco had dragged Hermione into a cosmetic shop, to help her pick out stuff to tame her hair into the accepted fashion. Although if Harry was being honest the vain idiot probably needed something for his hair, too.<br/><br/> Not even two minutes later Hermione and Draco left the shop looking downright disgusted. “You don’t want to know what stuff was put in make-up, before the regulations have been forced on the industry. I’m going to the potion store and I’ll buy ingredients for a few things. It’ll be my first attempt at making anything like make up, but at least your hair won’t be eternally greasy and your skin won’t deteriorate at thirty-five.” He said, looking at Hermione, who looked thankful.</p>
