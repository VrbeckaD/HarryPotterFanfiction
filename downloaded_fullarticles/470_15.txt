  <b>Chapter One. The Chosen Ones Birth</b>
</h1><hr/><p><strong>POV:</strong> Narrator</p><p>Every intelligent species is born with their soulmate’s name in Basic and their native language somewhere on their body alongside a matching soulmark. Additionally what is written or inflicted on the skin of one appears on the other. This allows soulmates to communicate by writing on their skin. Finding them is nevertheless not that easy. The galaxy is large and names and languages are rather common things. Additionally most keep their soulmarks hidden under clothing or under carefully placed jewelry. It’s scandalous in most cultures across the galaxy to allow someone other than your soulmate to see your soulmark.</p><p>Though rare, scars and soulmarks aren't the only thing soulmates share. Magicals share the ability to wield magic with their soulmate. Likewise a force user shares the ability to sense the force with their soulmate. Both magicals and force users have the ability to travel to their soulmates' side then back to their previous location, or an area near enough to it. With practice both magic users and force users can physically be in two places at once for weeks on end. </p><p>Though not unheard of it is rarer still for someone to have both a magical core and an innate connection to the force. When this occurs it is often the case the soulmate pair may live side by side in two places at once without rest for many years before anyone takes notice. Our story focuses on one such soulmate pair. Anakin Skywalker and Hari Potter. Two ‘Chosen Ones’ a galaxy apart with the strongest force connection and largest magical core yet recorded.</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> July 31, 1980 aka 41 BBY, <strong>-- </strong><strong>Location:</strong> Outer Rim, Arkanis sector, Tatoo star system, Planet of Tatooine, Port City of Mos Espa, Slave Quarters, Skywalker home<br/><strong>POV:</strong> Narrator</p><p>“Is it a boy or a girl?” Shmi asks as she hesitantly moves to sit up fully.</p><p>“A boy.” Aya chirps happily while carefully washing the child off in the little freshwater they were provided by their masters. </p><p>"It appears his father was of a human species." Benjamin says looking the child over carefully as Aya hands the new mother her son. “I’d say from Naboo or Corellia.” Benjamin declares as Shmi carefully cradles her newborn son. “Of course that's still not much to go on for identifying the blasted man who did this even if someone outside of us three cared.”</p><p>“What will you name him?” Aya asks Shmi changing the subject as Benjamin takes Aya into his arms and kisses her cheek.</p><p>“Anakin. Anakin Benjamin Skywalker.” Shmi responds. She smiles as the name inks itself onto her son's wrist in Galactic Basic and High Galactic next to his already forming soulmark. </p><p>Shmi frowns at the second family name that marks itself onto her son’s wrist. She had hoped fruitlessly that whoever the man was wouldn't lay claim on her son but it seems he did. After reading and memorizing the incriminating family name she hastily moves to cover it with her newborn son’s baby blanket. Like the Skywalker's, the Palpatine’s were once nobility on Naboo. She is now a slave and likely has no case against her son’s father. </p><p>Aya hands her the leather band they prepared and Shmi quickly covers Anakin’s full name and unfinished soulmark. She will check for his soulmate’s name later to add to their records. For now it is best he is kept covered. Showing once soulmark is akin to walking around without coverings to nearly every species of the galaxy. Some may find it acceptable but most take offence and one can easily find themselves in jail or worse for such things.</p><p>Shmi, Aya and Ben all blink in awe as Shmi’s newborn opens neon blue eyes and his once platinum blond hair begins to change color from blond to a natural red and then a chestnut brown that darkens until it turns black. "You are a beautiful one, my son." Shmi coos. She can't help but believe her little boy will be a heart-breaker once he's grown. Already Anakin's pale skin is gleaming in the moonlight. Anakin blinks before hissing curiously in a language similar to Huttnes. </p><p>"Did he just try to say; 'mom'?" Aya asks confused and visibly bewildered.</p><p>"Which is Mom?" The newborn Anakin asks again in a language similar enough to Huttnes that they can all understand him. Despite his inborn ability to speak the newborn Anakin is looking around confused and curious by his surroundings.</p><p>"It seems he did." Benjamin says in Galactic Basic with a laugh. "He will be smart if he's already showing signs of inborn intelligence."</p><p>Shmi blinks alarmed before calming down and cooing at her son in her best Huttnes "I am your mom little one. Do you know what species you are, my son?"</p><p>"I am human." Anakin states matter-of-fact before blinking and asking alarmed. "Are you not human?!"</p><p>"Yes, I am a human, my little treasure." Shmi explains, amused while still speaking her best Huttnes. "I am a human. Your father must have been a human too but I do not know him." In front of her bed Benjamin and Aya are clearly holding in laughter at her son's questions.</p><p>"But you are Mom!" Anakin insists outraged and alarmed on her behalf as his hair changes to an angry red, the color of fire or a setting desert sun.</p><p>"Yes, I am your mom, my little one. I am your mom and I am a human. Your father must have been a human too but I do not know him."</p><p>Anakin scrunches up his eyebrows confused and deep in thought before nodding. Before their eyes her son's beautiful pale fair skin and hair vanishes and delicate yet lightly tanned skin takes its place. Surprisingly he maintains his bright multicolored hair and neon blue eyes.</p><p>"Amazing." Benjamin says shocked. "I wonder if he can shift into any appearance he chooses or if it's limited to just his biology."</p><p>"Had we not been captured and raised as slaves this one would be a scientist." Aya says proudly elbowing her husband and soulmate, Benjamin, in the ribs.</p><p>"He would." Shmi agrees with a laugh before looking down at her sleepy newborn. “Aya, Ben,” Shmi says seriously, “we have been friends for many years now. You have both been there for me and stuck by my side even when everyone doubted the origins of my pregnancy.” Shmi says before taking a deep breath. “Should anything happen to me, I want you to take Anakin in.” </p><p>“Of course.” Benjamin says with a smile. “We will be sure to watch out for Anakin as if he were our own.”</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> July 31, 1980 aka 41 BBY,-- <strong>Location:</strong> Outer Rim, Uncharted Sector, Uncharted Star System, Planet Earth, Country of Great Britain, Continent of England, Village of Godric's Hollow, Potter Cottage<br/><strong>POV:</strong> Narrator</p><p>“Is it a boy or a girl?” Lady Lillian Potter, a human witch, asks out of breath and slowly releasing her wizard husband, Lord Jay Potter’s now broken hand.</p><p>“It’s a boy, and a little metamorphmagus from the look of things.” Lady Alice Longbottom, a human witch, responds with a smile still bathing Lily’s firstborn child and heir. The newborn's skin is a breathtaking honey tan. His hair is currently shifting between Lily’s natural red and Jay’s jet black. It's also already lengthening faster than a newborn child's will do naturally. Alice startles when the newborn instinctively apparates across the room  appearing in Lily’s arms.</p><p>Lord Sirius Black-Lupin barks a laugh. "Well at least we know he can apparate.” </p><p>"My Heir is going to be powerful. That's a skill full grown wizards have trouble with." Jay says before gulping down a skelgrow potion to repair the broken bones in his hand.</p><p>Lily’s still in shock from where she went into a surprise labor while their friends were over for dinner. Thankfully she made it into the living room before her water broke. Lily carefully cradles her son into her arms. A human baby boy with bright multicolored hair clutches at her fingers and Lily smiles and releases a pleased hum and hiss in response to seeing her baby alive and well. </p><p>~Welcome to the world, my son~ She hisses in parseltongue before instinctively cooing at her child causing curious little neon green eyes to open. ~Hello, little one.~ Lillian greets her child. The parseltongue is largely ignored since everyone in their friend group was sworn to secrecy back in first year.</p><p>~Mum?~ The baby asks worried but hopeful. The baby's words spark an immediate interest in the conversation despite only the father, mother, and child understanding the words. To everyone else the child simply hissed back.</p><p>~Yes, I am your Mum.~ She hisses humming low in her throat similar to a purr.</p><p>Her child releases a pleased growl and hiss that sounds distinctly male as females do not growl while hissing unless angry or threatened due to the difference in their vocal cords. Lillian smiles as her son yawns content and snuggles into her arms.</p><p>“Anakin Benjamin Skywalker-Palpatine.” Jay reads aloud while looking at and tracing their sons soulmates' name while still carefully avoiding the unfinished soulmark. “Huh. Sounds pureblood but I don't recognize the families.”</p><p>“Have you decided on your son’s name yet?” Lord Sirius Black-Lupin asks passing Lord Frank Longbottom’s newborn son, Heir Neville Frank Longbottom, back to him now that he’s settled down.</p><p>“Hari Regulus Potter-Black.” Lily responds smiling when the name writes itself onto her newborn son’s wrist in English, parseltongue and the odd language all soulmarks are written in. "‘Siri and Remmy named him the Black heir while my son was still in my womb.” Lily explains quickly wrapping her son’s soulmark with the band they prepared before anyone can see it, not that she thinks her closest friends would be so crude. “Are you four still up for being his Godparents?” she asks beginning to rock little Hari.</p><p>“Only if you're still sure.” Lord Remus Black-Lupin hesitantly says.</p><p>“Remmy if you seriously think I don't trust you with my son after all the times you kept me and Siri out of trouble you need to get your head checked.” Jay laughs.</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct 31, 1982 aka 43 BBY,<strong> -- Location:</strong> Outer Rim, Uncharted Sector, Uncharted Star System, Planet Earth, Country of Great Britain, Continent of England, Village of Godric's Hollow, Potter Cottage<br/><strong>POV:</strong> Narrator</p><p>"Lils run. I'll give you as much time as I can." Jay says as he gets up and moves to stand between his family and the front door.</p><p>"Give them hell, James," Lily says, taking a last look at her beloved husband. She then turns and immediately begins to chant a modified version of an ancient parseltongue spell as she runs up the stairs with her Hari tucked safely in her arms. For their back up plan to work she will need every second available to cast the spell. Knowing this, Jay immediately begins activating the latent traps and curses they layered about their cottage home. </p><p>Mere seconds after he completes his task a Bombarda Maxima blasts the wooden shards of the front door clear across the entryway hall. Lord Jay Potter takes a fortifying breath as he comes face to face with the nation's current Dark Lord. Despite knowing he will die tonight Jay fights back with every ounce of strength and magic in his body. He knows he alone can not defeat the mad wizard but he will stall as long as he can until reinforcements arrive. </p><p>Sweat pours out of him as he valiantly fights barely registering half the spells flying out of his wand. Eventually, Lord Voldemort gains the upper hand and he backs Lord Potter against the dining room table. Jay can no longer dodge or block, and he is thrown back into the wall with such force that his neck snaps upon impact. The last thoughts that flicker through his mind are of Lily and Hari hoping that he gave his beloved wife enough time to save their son and heir. </p><p>Now finished with Lord Potter, Voldemort begins to undo the traps that dare to stand in his way of the prophecy child. If his mind wasn't so set on eliminating the threat that holds the potential to undo all of his plans he would have noticed the glow of a magical signature that wasn't his own. However, he began on the stairs minutes after and therefore remained blissfully unaware of the parselmagic that had just been cast. His red eyes shine with madness when he sees the mud-blood woman remains defenseless despite the ample time offered to her to summon her wand. However Lillian doesn’t need her wand anymore, she never truly did. With that thought in mind Lillian moves to seal the protection she had just given her son and his soulmate.</p><p>"Not my Hari. Take me! Take me instead!" she continuously repeats with her hands held in front of her in a defensive manner thus completing the ritual. </p><p>She feels when the protective magic takes hold ripping her soul and magic from her body. It is an ancient magic, soul magic. It will protect her child and his soulmate from any evil that will ever come to stand against them. Lady Lillian Garnet Potter, nee Evans has given up her very soul and magic to protect her baby boy. In doing so she has signed the death warrant of her and Jay's souls and magical cores. There is always a price to be paid for using this form of magic. This is the last resort she and Jay had planned to ensure that their son will live past this night. As she takes her last breath Lady Lillian Potter can only smile as the neon green curse shoots from the mad man’s wand. Her body dies the second the curse makes contact.</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct 31, 1982 aka 43 BBY,<strong> -- Location:</strong> Outer Rim, Arkanis sector, Tatoo star system, Planet of Tatooine, Port City of Mos Espa, Slave Quarters, Skywalker home<br/>POV: Narrator</p><p>Shmi startles from her sleep hearing her son and another child screaming and sobbing in anguish. Grabbing her bedside dagger and emergency com, Shmi bolts out of her room into Anakin's nursery. Upon arriving she finds herself alone except for two toddlers whose faces have been carved in with a fine knife or low powered laser. The sick carvings look like a bolt of realistic lightning. The injuries practically cover one half of their faces and are bleeding profusely. Horrified Shmi picks up her son and the other toddler into her arms. Once she's secured them both she begins searching the house for the medical kit gripping her dagger and com in terror. </p><p>Running into the kitchen, Shmi grabs the emergency credits and the emergency medical kit. She doesn't know where the other boy came from but at the very least she can pay to have them both healed. She couldn't live with herself if both toddlers and their soulmates were left with permanent horrific scars. Their lives would be ruined before they even began. In the meantime Shmi barricades them in her bedroom after ensuring both toddlers are safely on her bed. Using her com Shmi shakily reports the break in to the local police and then to her master, Gardulla the Hutt. </p><p>It’s not until she's frantically bandaging both boys faces and sees matching bruising that she realizes the two are soulmates. Paranoid over the injuries and as to how the other boy arrived, Shmi makes a mental note to pay for an upgrade to their security. Even if she has to make a dent in her rations it will be worth it for her child to survive. After all, if one half of a soulmate pair dies the other will die soon after. </p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct 31, 1982 aka 43 BBY, <strong>-- Location: </strong>Outer Rim, Arkanis sector, Tatoo star system, Planet of Tatooine, Port City of Mos Espa, Slave Quarters, Skywalker home<br/><strong>POV:</strong> Shmi Skywalker<br/><strong>Gender:</strong> Female <strong>-- Age:</strong> 24,<strong> -- Hair:</strong> Brown <strong>-- Eyes:</strong> Brown <strong>-- Skin Colour:</strong> Fair Caucasian<br/><strong>Species:</strong> Human<strong> -- Magical Status:</strong> Muggle <strong>-- Birth Homeworld:</strong> Naboo <strong>-- Current Homeworld:</strong> Tatooine<br/><strong>Full Time Occupation:</strong> Slave for the Toydarian junk dealer Watto</p><p>“You claim you found the unknown human boy with this note?” The Toydarian police officer asks, holding the bizarre note that’s now resting inside an evidence bag. The police droid had taken it out of the blanket with tweezers. In fact, everything the poor little boy came with was counted as evidence. </p><p>“Yes, I didn’t even notice it until the police droid pulled it out.” Shmi explains looking down and wiping her eyes. “I was just so focused on stopping the bleeding. Nothing but the possible scarring and the fact that someone broke in really registered.”</p><p>“Right, well we have just a few more follow up questions before we can let you go.” The human police officer states with a sad smile. </p><p>“Of course.” Shmi easily agrees.</p><p>“The paper mentions a Lily Potter nee Evans and the woman's husband, a James Potter. Do you know anyone who went by those names?” The human police officer asks.</p><p>“Wait, did you say paper? As in real paper?” Shmi asks bewildered.</p><p>“Yes. It is certainly very odd.” The Toydarian police officer easily agrees, shooting his human partner a glare. “Now if you could answer the question.”</p><p>“Oh right, um. I've read the name Potter before.” Shmi says after some thought. “My son, Anakin’s soulmate's name is Hari Regulus Potter-Black.” Shmi explains “The boy I found shows evidence of being Anakin’s soulmate. Maybe it's a family name?” she says hesitantly “I just don't understand how they got inside or why they attacked the children before leaving.”</p><p>“Is this in your files?” The human police officer asks. “Ah, here it is. Hey, Qob look at this.”</p><p>“Right, I think this clears things up.” The Toydarian police officer says sharing <em> a look </em> with his human partner who nods. The Toydarian then turns to face Shmi. “We will bring both children back once they are done being healed. We suspect the boy’s parents to have had Magic. Basic magical immunizations have been found in his blood. Like Force users, Magicals are capable of teleportation.”</p><p>“It’s likely this was a one time thing,” The Toydarian police explains “we can’t detect enough magic for him to be able to use it himself. If this changes let us know. If they do have magic, both children will need to be trained in the skill and given magical immunizations yearly to prevent the spread of diseases. Magic is one of those abilities shared by soulmates.” </p><p>“Right.” the human police officer says before explaining further. “We already know his parents did not survive whatever happend to them. The child likely had to tap into his soulmate connection to survive being left wherever he was placed. The child ending up here is likely a flight or fight response.”</p><p>“Oh.” Shmi says horrified. “Um, thank you for explaining all this. Who will I need to take them to, should they end up with magic?” she asks, confused.</p><p>“They will be contacted by prospective schools on their fifth birthday by the galaxy's magicals if the ability arises. Unlike the Jedi and the Sith, the Magicals are capable of simply sending a letter to every prospective student across the galaxy. The letter explains the basics of each school and what each offers as well as a payment plan. Once you accept, you will be given a teleportation device that will take you and your family to the planet and the facility.” The Toydarian police officer explains before pausing. “Of course that's only if they do have magic.”</p><hr/><p><strong>Date:</strong> Nov 01, 1982 aka 43 BBY, <strong>-- </strong><strong>Location:</strong> Outer Rim, Uncharted Sector, Uncharted Star System, Planet Earth, Country of Great Britain, Continent of England, County of Surrey, Town of Little Whinging, Neighborhood of Privet Drive,<br/><strong>POV:</strong> Narrator</p><p>“Pet, what’s wrong?!” Vernon shouts from the kitchen worriedly upon hearing a shriek of outrage.</p><p>When no response came Vernon rushed (read waddled) into the living room to find Petunia collapsed into their couch, trembling. She is pale, completely despondent and staring off into space. Finally Vernon took notice of the two unknown toddlers on the couch and the letter trapped in Petunia's fist. </p><p>The letter is made of fine paper parchment and crumpled in her whitened knuckles. He gently pried it away and set it off to the side. He furrowed his brows confused as to why someone of <em> that world </em> would <em> leave two babies </em> on <em> their doorstep </em> . It's a well known fact among those in the know that the two worlds rarely mix and <em> never </em> willingly. Yet that is clearly what happend.</p><p>While his wife has her panic attack, Vernon sets to work checking over the abandoned freaks. Freezing and drowsy but seemingly alert enough. A deep cut on both foreheads still oozing blood and gunk but healing rapidly before his eyes. Not his problem then. Chubby rosy cheeks and clean hair. Well taken care of by their last guardians. A thin blanket in Red, Green, Silver and Gold as well as four plush toys. They were loved by whomever raised them until now. </p><p>High society and aristocratic features can already be made out in both children's eye and nose shape. The children are clearly from a good pedigree. The neon green and neon blue eyes and sharp fangs definitely point to magical children. All in all Vernon is at a loss on why two of the Freak’s children have been abandoned <em> and on their doorstep no less </em>.</p><p>“Vernon?” Petunia says faintly Vernon looks up from the equally confused baby freaks <em> sitting on his couch </em> to his traumatized wife. Petunia is seemingly just now noticing him.</p><p>“Yes, dear?”</p><p>"I don't know about the blond but the black haired one is my nephew, Hari. I told you about him.”</p><p>“Yes, I remember. Your freakish sister sent us pictures last year. He always looks different due to that curse of his. It’s not contagious is it?!” he asks panicking and quickly backing away from the Freak’s offspring.</p><p>“No. But my sister, Lily, she- she's dead, Vernon. Some nut-job broke into her house and killed her and her husband."</p><p>“I’m sorry?!” Vernon asks startled.</p><p>“Albus Dumbledore… he is the headmaster of that barmy boarding school I told you about…” Vernon nods his head worried about where this is going. “Well, he says that we have to raise the freak. Some sort of nonsense about blood protection. He claims my sister died tying her blood in Hari to mine. The second Freak isn't even mentioned in the letter! I can only assume we’re expected to raise him as well! How they can expect good upstanding people like us to-”</p><p>“Pet,” Vernon says, hesitantly stopping his wife’s shrill babbling. “Your sister was adopted. Even if such things as blood protection existed outside of barmy storybooks it wouldn't take.”</p><p>“I know that but- Well, what are we supposed to do with them?! We can't raise the freaks as our own but what would the neighbors say if we don't?!” Petunia shrieks. </p><p>Mr. Vernon Dursley pauses in thought before smiling and nodding to himself. “Fine. They can have Dudley's second bedroom but we won't keep them for free. Once they get big enough we'll move them to the attic and they can start helping out around the house.”</p>
