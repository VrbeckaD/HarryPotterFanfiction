</p><p align="justify">It was a sunny and warm spring day, the streets brimming with life. The buzz of conversation clinging in the air, filling it as much as the sweet fragrance of awakened nature did. Severus, however, didn't notice any of these things as he walked briskly, sending people in front of him scrambling to give him space. He moved purposefully, in long strides, forcing a few of his guards to jog behind him.</p><p align="justify">Today was a market day.</p><p align="justify">He wanted to be among first ones to look at the offers and snatch what he came for, if the intel he had was any good. There was always the possibility that the sorry excuse for a human in his custody had just tried to buy a few more days of life.</p><p align="justify">Suddenly, Severus halted his strides, his guards huffing with labour. He frowned, eyes directed to the other side of the small plaza. <em> What is he doing here? </em>He spotted a head of platinum blond hair, uncharacteristic for the area or Romans at general and longer than fashion or good sense allowed. Its owner was moving animatedly, talking with one of the merchants</p><p align="justify">
  <em> He has no need for more slaves. </em>
</p><p align="justify">Truth be told, neither did he, but if this auction truly had what he was told, then by the Mars he would have it. Lucius must have had the same information or he wouldn't be here in the first place. Well, best to keep his eye on him. With the decision made, he moved in the direction of his friend and rival. Raising his voice over the buzz of the plaza, he called.</p><p align="justify">“Lucius, fancy seeing you here.”</p><p align="justify">The blond head jerked up, surprise flashed in blue eyes, a less-than-warm smile tainted thin lips. “Severus, what unexpected surprise.”</p><p align="justify">“I should say the same.” he forced a smile on his lips. “Weren't you telling me just the other day that you have too many slaves for your needs? If you were looking to sell, I would be more than glad to relieve you of a few of them, at least.”</p><p align="justify">“I'm not looking to sell, but Narcissa is determined to turn the house upside down.The market is good as any place if one is looking for an excuse to escape.” Lucius smiled.</p><p align="justify">“Ah. And how are my dear cousin and my godson?” Severus gave his best to keep his face neutral and his voice casual--he didn't believe Lucius for a moment.</p><p align="justify">“They are fine. You should come to visit, I rarely see you lately. If there was no Senate I doubt I'd see you at all,” Lucius said.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I have to rectify that,” Severus nodded. <em> He knows--better not leave him out of my sight. </em>“Market is to open soon. Shall we?”</p><p align="justify">“Are you in need of slaves?” Lucius raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">“No, not slaves, a slave,” he replied with a smirk, testing Lucius’ reaction.</p><p align="justify">“Something specific?” Lucius' voice was just a tad higher pitched than it should be.</p><p align="justify">“Whichever girl catches my fancy. I'm looking for a new concubine,” he shrugged, smirk still on his face.</p><p align="justify">“Ah,” Lucius nodded again.</p><p align="justify">They continued their walk to Graecostadium, the market would open soon. Severus wasn't pleased with the fact that he knew. Lucius would try to outbid him, and with the resources Lucius had, he just might.</p><p align="justify">They had grown up together, served in the legions together, Lucius had married his distant cousin. Now, they both were esteemed members of the Senate, both having power and gold in abundance. They were friends, as much as anyone in their positions could be.   </p><p align="center">~ S ~ S ~ S~</p><p align="justify">The tradesman frowned as he hurried between the platform, the revolving rack and a few individual racks. He arranged a few slaves on the racks and came to the girl placed in the last one. He frowned. This slave was supposed to bring him a hefty sum of coins, but so far she had turned out to be only a headache.</p><p align="justify">Her curly hair was untamable, she never managed to retain the normal slaves posture, wealthy buyers avoided her in spite of her traits. She was well educated, a bit on a short side but with curves in all the right places, her olive skin had a sheen of gold from the sun. She was a prize snatched from the temple. Not a virgin, but still, a priestess. Her kind was a commodity, and usually sold fast and rich.</p><p align="justify">Not in this case.</p><p align="justify">He couldn't figure out for the life of him why he couldn't sell her. With a frown he tugged on her arm, pulling her up.</p><p align="justify">“And stay in this spot.. Don't slouch, do your best to be sold today or I'll whip you to within an inch of your life and sell you to cheapest whorehouse I can find,” he grumbled. “You are more hassle than you are worth.”</p><p align="justify">He placed the board next to her, displaying a long list of attributes. He frowned at the words “<em> Needs to be disciplined and trained”. </em> Pondering, he wondered, <em> Should I remove that? </em>  With a sigh, he decided against it. He won’t jeopardise his reputation for this piece of trouble. No, he would settle for fewer coins if that meant getting rid of her.</p><p align="justify">Shaking his head, he walked away. It wasn’t that this slave was causing trouble, but he had to keep her separated from other slaves, because solely her presence tended to make others rebellious. She would follow his instructions, but half-heartedly. He wasn’t untruthful when he threatened her. He wouldn’t damage her skin, but he would get rid of her, even if that meant gifting her to the whorehouse.</p><p align="justify">The sound of horns signified that the market was opening and he sped up his steps--there were coins to be earned.</p><p align="center">~ S ~ S ~ S ~</p><p align="justify">Severus frowned. Looking at the slim girl in front of him, he was sure that she wasn’t what he was looking for. Lucius would point at one slave girl or another, and they all were in accordance with what he usually preferred. Still, he was searching for one very specific slave this time.</p><p align="justify">He was unpleasantly reminded of what it looked like to visit the Market with his cousin. Her husband seemed to have adopted her shopping habits, much to his dismay.  Severus wondered if Lucius was doing this to distract him, but he was reluctant to part ways with him.</p><p align="justify">They did make an odd pair, and plenty of slave girls did their best to stay arranged as they were posed but still gave an extra allure. He wasn’t sure if they reacted that way because of Lucius’ long blond hair and soft features, or his more sharp and unmistakably Roman ones.  At the end of the day, it was irrelevant.</p><p align="justify">He searched for only one girl, after all. Not that he had much to go on. <em> You will feel her magic, you’ll know when you see her </em>, wasn’t much of an description. It wasn’t description at all.</p><p align="justify">That was one more reason he stayed with Lucius, just in case he had more information. It didn’t seem so, at least for now, but with Lucius, one couldn’t be too sure.</p><p align="justify">“Severus, look at this, she does have all the curves in all the right places.” Lucius pointed at one girl. “You know, maybe I’ll gift Narcissa another maid after all. One to keep her company, do her hair… you know all that nonsense she likes so much.”</p><p align="justify">“You gift her that one, and I’ll use your balls as a door knocker when I  visit,” he grinned.</p><p align="justify">“Perhaps…” Lucius nodded, still eyeing the girl.</p><p align="justify">Lucius launched into one of his stories, but he wasn’t listening anymore. His eyes were drawn to the far end of the room. Tacius usually had Greek slaves. Yes, he could go there and see what he’s offering. He headed in that direction and Lucius followed him, still chatting his ear off.</p><p align="justify">The auction was just starting. None of the offered slave girls caught his eye. Disappointed, he wandered off to the revolving rack. Still, not one girl gave him the impression that she poses an ounce of magic. A few girls were on the single racks and he headed there, reading the boards.</p><p align="justify">He almost passed her. Not almost, he did, passing by and not even glancing at her. Tingling on the back of his head forced him to turn around, and only then did he see her. She wasn’t noticeable at first glance, a bit on the shorter side in stature. Her curves weren’t as rich. Her hair reminded him of a lion’s mane, curly and wild. But her eyes…</p><p align="justify">Her eyes were the colour of a hazelnut, so expressive and live, whispered the promises. His body felt alive and alert. Well, certain parts of him were made more than a little alert by her gaze. He wasn’t sure if she was the one he was looking for, but she was the one he wanted to possess.</p><p align="justify">Reading the board, his lips twitched. <em> Well educated. Priestess. Raised at the temple. Needs to be disciplined and trained. </em> His cock welcomed these pieces of information. He circled her. Firm ass. Her tits were only a handful, but pert and proudly jutted. Her muscles were well toned. <em> Yes, she could go a few rounds with me without breaking a sweat. </em></p><p align="justify">He raised his hand ringing a bell. Tacius waved him to wait.</p><p align="justify">“Where did you disappear, Severus? I’ve been talking to myself,” Lucius complained.</p><p align="justify">“You always do, Lucius,” he replied, not even glancing at his friend.</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure? She doesn’t seem like your…” Lucius started, then stopped, his mouth working but no sound coming out for a few long moments. “Well hello there.”</p><p align="justify">Severus watched as Lucius eyed the girl, rubbing his chin.</p><p align="justify">“You know, I think I will take her. For Narcissa,” mumbled Lucius, missing the glare full of daggers that Severus sent him.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, my friend, but you will have to find some other girl, this one is mine.” He infused his voice with enough threat to draw Lucius’ attention.</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure? She’s not your usual type,” Lucius asked, pulling back a step.</p><p align="justify">“Quite sure. I want her. Besides, Narcissa won’t have much use for her,” he added with a smirk. “Looking at her, I doubt that she can make any type of hairstyle.”</p><p align="justify">“But still….” Lucius narrowed his eyes.</p><p align="justify">“You <em> are </em> buying a gift for Narcissa.” He gave Lucius one dangerous grin.</p><p align="justify">His body was still tingling, her proximity alone was enough. He would hate to cause problems and draw attention, but he would if it came to that. He simply had to have her. Maybe he did have luck and had found what he was looking for.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> He said I’ll know when I see her. </em>
</p><p align="justify">Tacius came over.</p><p align="justify">“What do you ask for this one?” Lucius asked first, not even waiting for a greeting.</p><p align="justify">“50 Denarius.” Tacius gave them a big smile.</p><p align="justify">“Why so cheap? Is she damaged?” Lucius frowned, bending to read the board at the slave’s feet.</p><p align="justify">“No, not that I know off.” Tacius shifted nervously. “Just not trained.”</p><p align="justify">“Still…” Lucius started then glanced at her. “The price is more than favourable, who am I to complain?”</p><p align="justify">“70 Denarius,” Severus offered.</p><p align="justify">Tacius twitched, glancing from him to Lucius. He could hear the sound of coins clinking in Tacius’ head. Tacius will owe him a big one, but Severus was determined to outbid Lucius at this moment.</p><p align="justify">“Ah my friend, you don’t want to play that game with me,” Lucius hissed at him, and then smirked, proclaiming, “10 Aureus.”</p><p align="justify">“I’ll double whatever he offers.” Severus smirked back at Lucius.</p><p align="justify">“Really, Severus?” Lucius sounded displeased.</p><p align="justify">“I told you, I want her.” He tilted his head. “So are we stopping here, or do you want to raise the price more?”</p><p align="justify">The crowd started to gather, it wasn’t common to bid about these type of slaves.  Severus smiled, not wanting to show his own worry. If Lucius continued to bid others might join, and even if he could afford it, he didn't want to pay the price of an estate for one slave.</p><p align="justify">Lucius glanced at the girl one more time and then shrugged. “If you want her that badly… I do hope that you will share.”</p><p align="justify">“Perhaps.” Severus gave him a polite nod.</p><p align="justify">“I prefer them tame anyway, and you will get bored of her soon. I know you. Then, why not let you do all the work and simply enjoy later? I do want to buy her out as soon as you are ready to sell.” Lucius shrugged.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t often that his friend admitted defeat--more often than not, he was the one to debate his way until he got what he wanted in the Senate. Whatever the reason was, Severus wouldn’t argue, but he would watch his back.</p><p align="justify">Counting the coins, he handed them to Tacius.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll deliver her…”</p><p align="justify">“No, I’ll take her with me, now.” he barked at the Tradesman.</p><p align="justify">Tacius simply nodded. Bending, he gave a dress, more like a sack with holes in it, to the slave girl. When she was covered, Tacius tied her hands and gave the rope to Severus. He tugged the girl, turning to Lucius.</p><p align="justify">“So, did you find something else to gift to Narcissa?”</p><p align="justify">“As a matter of fact I did, if you’ll wait for me for just one moment…” Lucius turned and left, summoning the trader.</p><p align="justify">Severus pivoted on his heel. Taking her chin in his hand, he turned her face left and right. She wasn’t a beauty that would start a war. In fact, she was rather plain looking. His skin still reacted to the touch, prickling.</p><p align="justify">He leaned over, towering above her. “For the coins you just cost me, you better have some skills,” he growled in her face.  </p><p align="justify">She didn’t flinch. Her eyes stayed on his, proud and determined.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Oh, it will be fun taming this one.  </em>
