    <p>“I love you.” Leta said calmly, but fear evident in her eyes, before she was engulfed in the fire.<br/>
“NOOOOO!!!” Theseus yelled, he deflected the flames coming towards him. Leta’s ashes fell onto the floor. He didn’t even have a body to bury. The flames engulfed the entire mausoleum and Theseus ran out with Newt. When they got outside an extremely old and brittle man stood outside.<br/>
“Form a circle and put your wands into the Earth.” he calmly ordered. Theseus and Newt paired up and ran to an area. The flames have now turned into a dragon and the brothers stuck their wands into the ground. A golden shield started to fight back against the dragon and eventually took over the dragon. An exhausted Theseus looked over at his brother who was also panting. He didn’t expect the hug coming. Newt was probably the most un-Hufflepuff Hufflepuff ever. Theseus hugged him back. He loved his brother.<br/>
“I’ve chosen my side.” Newt said.</p>
<p>Theseus went back to work the next day. He couldn’t be seen as weak, he was an auror, grief couldn’t overtake him. He got stares as he walked his path to his office. Everyone had heard what had happened in Paris and no one expect him to show up. He promised himself he wouldn’t cry. He couldn’t, he had to be strong, it’s was Leta would have wanted. He walked in and Torquil Travers, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, walked up to him.<br/>
“Scamander, I would have expected you to take today off,” he said.<br/>
“I would have too but I’m here, and I’m going to take Grindelwald down,” Theseus answered.<br/>
Travers smiled, “My dear boy, you should be grieving, maybe make an appointment at St. Mungo’s, just to make sure you aren’t wounded from your battle,”<br/>
Theseus avoided eye contact, “No sir, I’m fine.”<br/>
“Go home.” Torquil ordered. Theseus nodded his head. He wasn’t in a mood to argue. He left and went back to Newt’s apartment. He couldn’t ever step foot back into the small house he and Leta shared. Newt was still wanted by the Ministry even after he fought Grindelwald a second time. Newt was in his case, and the Americans were cleaning up the living room. The girl who was with Credence was sitting quietly in the corner, and the French man, Theseus believed, Yusuf used his magic to pack and repack his things, the boredom eating away at him. The Ministry had already come to Newt’s apartment but they hid him in his case turning on the “Muggle Worthy” mode. Theseus figured that he had to clear out Leta’s possessions, he wanted to have something of her. </p>
<p>He apparated to their small house in Dorset. He walked into their bedroom and opened her jewelry box on their dresser. He took out a necklace with a raven charm and the carvings “Leta Scamander”. He had given it to her as an engagement gift. He remembered first meeting her and noticing her gorgeous brown eyes. No brown eyes ever seemed as beautiful as hers. He looked farther in and saw her pearl earrings. Her pearl earrings had stood out the most out of all the jewelry she wore. They had meant so much to her because her father had given them to her for her eleventh birthday. She treasured them dearly because it had shown that he cared even the smallest bit for her. Theseus took them out and held them in his palm. When she told him her tragic story and why the earrings meant so much, that was when he fell in love with her. He finally let the tears escape. He had only intended for a few single tears to fall, but he couldn’t control himself as more and more escaped. Soon he was sobbing, getting his tears all over the earrings. That was when he excepted the thought that the woman he loved was dead.</p>
