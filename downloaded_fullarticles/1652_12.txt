    <p>Typically, these sorts of affairs would be handled by mail. You would place the letter in the correct chute at the filing office, there would be a blinding flash of light, and it would be dropped into the hands of the right people. Newt had no such luck. His papers had been irreversibly and completely lost. He fidgeted with his case, containing a reprinted copy of his forms, signed in quadruple, and waited. He sighed. Why had his papers disappeared on a day such as this? If it were any other February morning, he would be in the lobby of Britain's branch of the Council of Angels. The passport tucked behind a pocket watch he kept inside his case and the American flag dangling too close to the ground in the hallway indicated this wasn't a typical February morning. </p><p>Newt had been in this hallway, butt pressed uncomfortably into an oak wood bench for an hour at the very least. He didn't bother checking his pocket watch, it would only confirm how slow the Council was with their meetings. Newt couldn't help but wonder what had all branches of the Council here in the first place. He avoided asking questions to any one of the intimidating members of the security on his way in. It saved time and kept the guards’ staring to a minimum. Neither he nor them would have been delighted with a chat about the weather let alone confidential Council business. </p><p>The door to his right opened with a wide swing. A slender young man, who Newt did not recognize, stepped out from the room where the Council meeting was being held. Newt stood. The young man looked at him with round, brown eyes. </p><p>“Oh!” he exclaimed as if he had forgotten something.  “Mister, uh-” </p><p>“Scamander, Newt Scamander,” Newt said, once he realized what the young man's pause meant. </p><p>“Right,” said the young man. “Mister Scamander, the Council will see you momentarily.” The young man hurried back into the meeting room and shut the door behind him with an unceremonious slam. He returned after a moment and beckoned for Newt to come in. </p><p>Newt walked in staring at the floor. The plain blue carpet didn't make for much of an interesting sight so he looked up at the crowd above him. All one hundred members of the Council stared at him with judgement in the eyes. Newt cleared his throat. The man closest to him, a man Newt knew quite well began to speak. </p><p>“Mr. Scamander,” the man said in a loud, yet shrill voice. “Why are you wasting our time?” </p><p>“I received a summons,” Newt said, then added, “Mr. Burke, sir.” He lifted up a golden feather, then waved it. </p><p>In a voice matching the man in front of Newt, the feather said: </p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr. Newton Scamander,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your community service forms, proof of employment, and other important documents were not received for the previous year on December 1st, as is required. Since you have made no attempt to contact the Department of Community Affairs in the past 33 days, you are hereby summoned to appear before the council. We will be expecting you February 1st at exactly 11:11 sharp. </em>
</p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p><em>With all due respect, </em> </p><p>
  <em></em>
</p><p><em>Thomas Burke,</em><br/>
<em>Councillor for the Council of Angels, </em><br/>
<em>British Branch </em></p><p>With that, Newt placed the feather back into his case. He looked into the crowd of members of the Council, laid eyes upon his brother, and snapped his attention back to Mr. Burke. </p><p>“You appear before this Council on suspicion of an evasion of documents?” Mr. Burke asked. </p><p>“I think so." </p><p>“Why were your documents not submitted on December the first as required?” asked Mr. Burke. </p><p>“I submitted my documents months ago,” Newt said. </p><p>“If that's so, why weren't they received?” Mr. Burke asked with a hint of annoyance creeping into his tone. </p><p>"I don't know," he replied, honestly. How could he possibly know what happened to his letter after he sent it? Mr. Burke looked displeased with his answer nonetheless. "I suppose they got lost in the post." He raised his case up to eye level. "I brought another copy with me, just in case." </p><p>The young man from earlier circled around Newt and relieved him of his case. His gelled locks were a hair more sweaty than they had been earlier. After a loud cough from one of the council members, the young man opened the case. </p><p>"The papers are here, sir," he said in a small voice. He lifted them out of the case and into the air for good measure. </p><p>"Good," said Mr. Burke hastily. "Your papers will be thoroughly read for discrepancies. You will receive a letter by post either clearing you or summoning you to the British council office for detainment. That will be all, Mr. Scamander." </p><p>Newt stood in the center of the room completely aghast. That was much quicker than expected. He looked over to his case, which was being taken into another room by the young man with the round, brown eyes. </p><p>"My case-" Newt interrupted before the winged gavels banged against each council members' desk to adjourn the meeting. "What about my case? When will I get it back?" </p><p>Mr. Burke turned around from where he was getting up to leave and gave Newt an impartial glance. </p><p>"Your case will be returned to you when its contents are reviewed," he said dully. "Will that be all?" He didn't pause for Newt's reply before waving a hand. The winged gavels banged in unison. With a flash then a flap of their wings, the council members disappeared from the room. Even the young man who had greeted him at the door was nowhere to be found. Stifling a grumble, Newt exited the meeting room. He was completely unable to return home as planned. Hopefully he would be able to find some lodging for the night. </p><p>Newt walked into the hallway and past the waiting guards. If it weren't strictly forbidden, he would have considered flying home. He hurried through the packed lobby and out into the chilly February air. The American office of the Council of Angels faded away behind him. In its place was a plain brick wall. Newt around the cramped alley that served as a hiding place for Angel Affairs. It was dark, gloomy, and unappealing. He left as quickly as he could without drawing attention. Newt stared out into the busy streets of New York. Cars sped this way and that without much organization and workers hurried about the streets avoiding casual conversation with one another. If it weren't so crowded and didn't have such disagreeable laws, Newt could like it here. </p><p>He slipped into and blended in amongst the crowd. He looked around at the skyscraping apartments, banks, and small businesses. The distractions caused him to slam face first into another passerby. His face throbbed and turned red, partly due to pain, partly due to sheer embarrassment. He glanced up to see who he had run into. A woman around his age with short dark hair and a long coat looked down towards the sewer grate below them, where her hot dog was laying in muddy water. </p><p>"I'm terribly sorry," said Newt, hurriedly. "I was looking for somewhere to stay and I got distracted. I can get you a new one, if you'd like." </p><p>The woman waved him off with a shake of her head. "Don't worry about it." </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Newt spotted a small bakery. He was in need of a place to stay and a sweet couldn't hurt. </p><p>"That's a nice bakery," Newt said, pointing a finger to a small shop with golden lettering on the window. "I think I'd fancy something sweet right about now. Wouldn't you?" </p><p>The woman glanced in the direction Newt was pointing. She guessed a donut or two couldn't hurt, could it? She didn't have to be in the office for another hour and people didn't go around offering to buy her desserts. So when Newt looked both ways and scurried across the busy road way, she followed him. </p><p>Once Newt and his new companion crossed the road, the smell of baked goods filled the air. It was a heavenly smell and quite possibly the most enticing thing Newt had encountered since arriving in New York. The door opened with a soft chime. Newt stepped in, followed by the woman behind him. The bakery had a wide array of imaginative baked goods. Aromas of orange, vanilla, chocolate, mint, and smells Newt couldn't quite place nipped at their noses and stomachs. The desserts came in all sorts of shapes Newt had never seen before, creatures that didn't exist. The natural, unnatural, and supernatural lined the shelves as delectable pastries. </p><p>Newt's wandering eyes were interrupted by the arrival of a plump, dark haired man in an apron. He greeted Newt and the woman with a smile. </p><p>"Welcome to Kowalski's. Can I help you with anything?" asked the man in the apron. Newt took one last look at the shelves lining the bakery. </p><p>"Who came up with all of this?" asked the woman next to him, incredulously. </p><p>"I did," the man in the apron said. "Jacob Kowalski." He outstretches a hand to Newt and the woman next to him. The woman takes it and shakes it lightly. </p><p>"Tina Goldstein," she said, warmly. "Where did you get the idea for all this?" </p><p>Jacob shrugged and said with a laugh, "I don't know! It just came to me. Maybe it was some fairytale I heard or something." He pointed to a lovely looking circular pastry behind the glass of his counter. "I think you'd like these. My grandma's recipe. You can't get anything like it anywhere else." </p><p>Tina eyed the pastry Jacob pointed to. Newt watched as she nodded and told him that yes, she would like one. Newt fumbled in his pockets for money to pay for two pastries, one for him and one for her. He sighed as two slightly crumpled five pound notes slid into his hands. He'd never exchanged them for dollars. Newt wouldn't usually try his luck with money-related miracles. After all, the council of Angels watched every angel's every move. He couldn't risk being considered rogue. Weighing his options, he decided one conversion from pounds to dollars couldn't make him fall from grace. With an image in his mind, he placed his hands over the notes. Once the notes had shifted currency, he lifted his hand. When he looked up, both Tina and Jacob were watching him. Now that he hadn't accounted for. </p><p>He cleared his throat and placed the two five dollar bills on the counter. The exchange hadn't been exact and he lost money but Newt didn't complain. Jacob kept an eye on him as he placed two pastries and paper napkins on the counter. Tina thanked him and the pair left the bakery but not before Newt did something else. Jacob nearly slipped as Newt and Tina opened the door. With a wave of his hand, Newt caught Jacob before he hit the floor. He lifted him back into the upright position with another wave of his hand. </p><p>"Be a little bit more careful next time," Newt said as the door slammed shut behind him and Tina. Tina surveyed the area like a hawk before dragging Newt into an alley. With a clink, a sword appeared from behind her back. She stared at Newt with a mix of frustration and confusion. Newt lightly pushed away the edge of her blade. </p><p>"Who are you?" asked Tina in a huff. </p><p>"Newt Scamander," said Newt. "You aren't with the Council, are you?" </p><p>"Luckily for you, I'm not. What were you thinking? What if he had shouted for help? Or if he had a weapon?" </p><p>Newt rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't think a baker would keep anything like that in his shop." </p><p>Tina sighed. "Mr. Scamander, we can't make that mortal forget what he saw. It would make the us both rogues. Only the council can. I'm a police officer for mortals, not for angels but I can still take you and the mortal in as a concerned citizen." </p><p>"You don't have to do that," said Newt. "I'm a zoologist, nothing dangerous. I just need a place to stay and I'll be out of your hair." </p><p>"What about the mortal?" asked Tina, pointing  back to the bakery. After a few moments without a response, Tina sighed. "Alright. I know somewhere you can stay but we're bringing the mortal. His memory still has to be erased by the Council." </p><p>Newt and Tina tucked their pastries in the pockets of their coats and head back inside the bakery. Jacob had returned to his place in the kitchen. Tina put a finger to her lips and snuck behind the counter. Newt, unsure of what Tina's plan was, stood in front of the counter, waiting. There was a thud and Tina returned with a now disoriented Jacob. Newt's eyes widened. </p><p>"Don't worry," said Tina. "He'll be alright. He's in a kind of trance. I usually only use this on victims of gunshot wounds. It helps ease the pain. It's similar to laughing gas." </p><p>"And that won't make either of us rogue?" Newt asked carefully. </p><p>Tina shook her head. "Trust me, I've done this before." Tina gave Jacob a light shove and the trio headed for the door. Tina leader the way, pushing Jacob along and Newt followed behind. </p><p>The group arrived at a small apartment building. Newt stared at it as they approached. Tina swung out her arm to stop Newt in his tracks. </p><p>"I'm not really supposed to bring men here," Tina said cautiously. "You'll have to be quiet." </p><p>"I can find another place to stay," Newt offered. Tina shook her head and that was that. The three of them walked surreptitiously up the stairs, avoiding making a single stair creak. Towards the top, a floorboard cried with a loud squeak. The voice of Tina's landlady rang clear from the floor below, asking if she had any company. Tina lied, saying she was alone as usual. The landlady didn't seem suspicious. They headed up the final stair and into Tina's apartment. </p><p>The apartment was small yet inviting. Newt looked around at the comfortable furnishings and the clothes hanging out to dry. Then the sight of another angel being in the apartment caught his eye. Newt was certain she was an angel. Her elegant bluebird-like wings were on full display and a heavenly glow circled her. Besides that, the woman wore a simple lightly colored silk nightgown that was hard to look away from. Newt coughed. </p><p>"Put something on, Queenie," said Tina. Queenie pinned her wings to her back and shifted into her corporal form. She found a thin housecoat and wrapped it around her nightdress. Tina didn't seem entirely satisfied but she kept whatever she was thinking to herself. Jacob stood close to the door, stuck in an entirely new trance. </p><p>"Teenie, who did you bring home?" Queenie asked incredulously. "I can't remember the last time you brought men home. Are they mortals?" </p><p>"One is," said Tina, pointing at Jacob. "That's the baker from a few streets up  He's in a trance. I don't know how soon he'll wake. And this, is Newt Scamander, a fellow angel. He's why the mortal is here. He performed miracles in the bakery." </p><p>"Would you like something to eat?" Queenie asked Newt. </p><p>"No, thank you," replied Newt. Queenie walked over to Jacob, who was still disoriented. She made an attempt to wake him. He didn't budge. </p><p>"Oh well," she said. "I'll make something just in case he wakes up hungry." </p><p>With that, Queenie went to work. The smells of a myriad of ingredients filled the air. Newt breathed in cinnamon and cloves, ginger and grapefruit. He sat in pleasant silence while Queenie baked in a cheerful glow. Tina sat at the table, pondering something Newt couldn't decipher.</p><p>Jacob awoke from his trance.</p>
