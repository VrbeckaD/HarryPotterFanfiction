    <p>They say that even the best laid plans of mice and men can often go awry.</p><p>Not that theirs had been the <em> best </em> laid plan, but it was probably as solid as it could have been given all of the unreliable variables certain to be at play. All they had to do was infiltrate the ministry, find the locket, and get out without being detected. An easy plan, really.</p><p>And, in immediate hindsight, things probably would have turned out smoothly if Harry had just stuck to their simple plan and hadn’t blown their cover by attacking Umbridge in the middle of the hearing.</p><p>But then, Harry Potter seldomly does simple.</p><p>However, as Yaxley and Umbridge were laying as fodder for the dementors while they made their escape in borrowed skin, he really couldn't bring himself to regret the decision.</p><p>Harry was half supporting a very shocked Mrs. Cattermole to the stairs- Hermione still shielding their back with her patronus- when a sharp whistle of a yellow light crashed into the corner of the wall in front of them.</p><p>They dove into the stairwell just as another spell whizzed passed. Harry's knee scraped the edge of a stair hard, Hermione landing half on top of him, while Mrs. Cattermole stumbled a couple steps above. The two impersonators quickly moved so that their backs were flush against the cool wall, looking at each other in a panic.</p><p>“<em>Yaxley</em>?” Harry mouthed, but the girl shook her head.</p><p>“That's you, isn't it <em> Granger!?</em>” A sharp, familiar voice hissed, footsteps padding closer. Harry’s body was instantly coiled to attack, blood boiling at the very <em> sound </em> of the snake, but Hermione had a tight grip on his arm, pulling him up the stairs.</p><p>“Which means,” Draco drawled, slowly turning the corner. He sneered recognizing the contempt written on Harry’s face, “Hello, <em> Potter</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Stupefy!</em>” Hermione’s spell hit Draco square in the chest with a bright blue spark, sending him hurling into the wall with a loud <em> crack</em>. She pulled on Harry’s arm roughly. “Harry, <em> C’MON</em>!”</p><p>Against every instinct of bitter <em> loathing</em>, the young wizard let himself be led to the landing. Hermione held steady to him and the witch with them and turned on her heal. However, instead of the familiar feeling of being pulled out of space and time, the girl simply twisted herself directly into Harry’s chest.</p><p>“W-what’s going on?” Mrs. Cattermole began in a panic, tears welled in her wide eyes.</p><p>“There’s an anti-disapparation charm in effect!”</p><p>“A <em> what!?</em>” Harry asked, panicked. “How did they find out so <em> quickly!?</em>”</p><p>“They must have known we were here!”</p><p>“<em>Sshhite,</em>” he groaned, running the stranger's oversized hands through the roots of his slick hair. “Okay, <em>think</em>," Harry rubbed at his temple, "what if we use a portkey?" He opened his hands with a hopeful grin, "Dumbledore was able to make one to Hogwarts despite the anti-disapparation the Ministry put up to trap the Death Eaters when we went after the prophecy.”</p><p>“But what about Ron!?”</p><p>“We’ll go find him! The potion hasn’t worn off yet, so we need to slip upstairs before everyone knows <em> who </em> we’re wearing-”</p><p>Another lightning hex flashed by them, barely giving Harry time to throw himself and Mrs. Cattermole out of the way. Hermione flattened herself against the wall, listening to Draco’s feet starting on the stairs; she pointed her wand at the top step and muttered, “<em>Glisseo!</em>”</p><p>There was a loud grunt as the Death Eater’s legs were knocked out from under him. She cautiously peeked around and found the newly flattened slope of stairs empty. Then a blinding red jet was thrown from around the corner below, hitting the wall beside her face just as Harry pulled her back.</p><p>“<em>Deprimo!</em>” the raven haired teen shouted, aiming his wand at the center of the stairway around the corner. The floor shifted beneath the force of the spell blowing a hole between levels; Harry turned back to the witches. “Hermione, take Mrs. Cattermole and get out of here! Find Ron and I’ll-”</p><p>“<em>CONFRINGO!</em>” Draco’s voice boomed, sending a bright red spell into the corner above him, bursting the dark tile into rubble raining down upon him. Harry hardly had time to avoid the way of the larger chunks- still getting the brunt of scrapes from smaller shards as he rolled to the side.</p><p>“<em>Hermione go!</em>”</p><p>“<em>What!? </em> No, Harry, I am <em> not </em> leaving you to deal with this <em> alone</em>!”</p><p>“We don’t have <em> time </em> to argue about-” There was a shift in the air then, a shadow flickering as the weight of the lift pressed down upon them- filled, no doubt, with a small brigade to apprehend them. Harry leaned his head back on the cool tile, eyes closed as he took a heavy breath through his nose. “<em>Shite.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Ascendio</em>!” Draco yelled, the next moment landing with an ungraceful <em> thud </em>at the top of the stairs. Harry hopped back to his feet, wand at the ready as the blond propped himself by his elbow. The Death Eater wasted no time in sending a vibrant orange jinx their way.</p><p>“<em>Protago!</em>” Harry said flicking his wrist to produce a sliver wisp of a shield. Draco snarled, hopping to his feet just as Harry sent his own spell at him. While the two wizards continued to duel, Hermione pulled Mrs. Cattermole to a notch in the wall just beside the lift almost to their level.</p><p>“Mrs. Cattermole,” She started, grabbing the woman’s shaking hands for her attention, “We'll distract them so you can <em> run</em>, and as soon as you are able to slip away without being seen, <em> go find your husband</em>. He should be on his way to the atrium now.” She then pulled out the locket and wrapped it up in a handkerchief. “When you do, I need you to give this to him and tell him to meet us at Headquarters, can you do that?”</p><p>“H-headquarters?” The older witch stammered as she skeptically took the tiny bundle, “What is it?”</p><p>“Just find your husband, he’ll know what to do.” Hermione squeezed the witch's hands once more, looking at her seriously. “<em>Please, </em>Mrs. Cattermole, promise me you won't let <em> anything </em> happen to this until you get it to your husband.”</p><p>The woman took a bracing breath before giving the other a solid nod. Hermione smiled, tapping the tip of her wand to the top of Mrs. Cattermole’s head, muttering a disillusionment charm. She watched as what looked like paint from the wall itself poured over the woman until her figure could only be seen at the right angles.</p><p>Harry felt his heart sink at the sound of the halting lift. Had they just a <em> few more </em> seconds- had the blond Death Eater only <em>stayed</em> on the level below- they might have been able to get up the stairs to find Ron, make a portkey, and <em> go</em>. But that didn’t matter now. They were out of time, their escape blocked. The best they could hope for was to hide until there was an opening to slip away. Harry's faded green eyes focused on Hermione’s, nodding for the briefest of moments to the end of the corridor just as the melodic lift voice announced: <em> ‘Level 9: Department of Mysteries’</em>.</p><p>No sooner had the grates began to open did spells fly toward the pair. Harry threw up a shield as they began backwards. Hermione flicked a jinx at the first Death Eater out of the doors, hitting him square in the chest and giving them just enough time to turn and run to the end of the corridor. Hermione threw an opening charm at the great black door as Harry blocked more curses from their pursuers.</p><p>The two threw themselves through, and with another sharp flick of the witch’s wrist, the door slammed in the Death Eaters’ faces. The circular room of black doors immediately started spinning, making Harry dizzy as he straightened himself against Hermione’s back. One of the door exploded, splitters flying through the air as they came to a crashing halt.</p><p>“<em>Confringo!</em>” Harry shouted as he followed Hermione to their nearest room. But as the heavy door slammed behind them, an orange bolt snuck through, hitting Harry’s wand arm like an electric charged lash. The wizard cried out, arm spasming, fingers instinctually clenching tighter around his wand.</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione shouted, touching the tip of her wand to the crest of his elbow.</p><p>The wizard felt a comfortable cool spread through his arm. He sighed, moving it around to test. “Thanks.”</p><p>They could hear the room beyond their door grinding as it spun, but the noise was mostly drowned out by the loud <em> tick tick ticking </em> echoing off the diamond-like surfaces of the room. Harry turned with wide eyes, taking the strange space in- Hermione, he could see, was doing the same on the other side of the room. The walls were covered top to bottom with every kind of clock imaginable- each ticking in unison to the whistling of a sand on the glass in the center of the room. Harry and Hermione began circling the large glass bell jar curiously, watching a brightly colored hummingbird ride the breeze to the top then circle back to the bottom as an egg only to hatch and start the cycle again.</p><p>“It’s <em> time</em>...” Hermione murmured in awe, but before they could continue to admire the phenomenon, the far door was blasted open. Harry, grabbed the witch’s arm and ducked behind the stand of the bell jar.</p><p>“Hiding again Potter?” Draco’s tense voice chided as he slowly began circling the bell jar. “You seem to like doing that, <em> coward</em>.”</p><p>Harry stood, wand up and aimed for the other through the storm in the glass. “Where are your <em> friends</em>, Malfoy?” Harry spat. “You call <em> me </em>a coward, but I’m just surprised you actually came in without them.”</p><p>“They’re checking the other rooms,” Draco inclined his chin as the other snarled. “I see that <em> Granger </em> is with you, but where’s the oaf Weasley?” Hermione shot up at that, wand also  fixed on the Death Eater who smirked. “Sorry, did I strike a <em> nerve</em>?”</p><p>Hermione snarled, “<em>Stupefy!</em>”</p><p>Draco quickly produced a silver wisp of a shield, but was still knocked back a bit by the witch’s spell. Then he snapped his wand forward at the girl.</p><p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Harry yelled. The Death Eater’s wand shot into the air at the same moment the unfamiliar curse erupted from its tip. A bright blue bolt shot out, shattering the bell jar and hitting the colorful Hummingbird (just catching flight) square in its tiny chest.</p><p>Everything stopped in that moment- shards of glass hovered around the wizards, the ticking of each clock stopped mid tock, the bird itself was frozen in the stagnant sandstorm. The trio exchanged fearful glances when suddenly the tiny bird burst into blinding orange and red flames. Then everything started spinning, the glass disintegrated into a golden storm of sand whipping around them, the clocks began peeling from the walls, joining in the whirlwind that swept the young wizards off their feet.</p><p>They spun faster and faster, colors morphing through every hue outside of the whirlwind until there was nothing but black, the sound of ticking clocks and a high pitched whistle became deafening, but just when Harry started to believe the storm would last forever, it stopped and they all came crashing to the floor.</p><p>Harry groaned loudly as he sat up. Rubbing at his head, he felt the familiar slightly raised lightning skin of his scar, and the clothes he wore were sagging around his wiry frame as he dug his glasses from the breast pocket. They were cracked- <em> of course </em> they were- but the wizard didn’t have time to worry about that now. He pushed himself to his feet and looked at Hermione slowly sitting herself up, rubbing at her temple with a wince.</p><p>“You alright?” he asked on his way over.</p><p>“I think so,” she responded, grabbing onto the hand extended to her. Harry pulled the witch to her feet and they both looked around the room, surprised to find it <em> exactly </em> as they had when they’d first stepped in. The clocks were ticking happily away, the light bounded off every glass surface, and even the bell jar was intact- a swirling storm gently carrying a brightly colored bird in its breeze. Though, Harry noticed as he looked closer, the colors of the birds feathers seemed to be inverted from the one they’d seen before- the one Draco had <em> killed</em>.</p><p>As if on queue, another loud groan sounded from the other side of the bell jar. Harry gripped his wand tightly and stepped toward the Death Eater regaining consciousness, but there was a firm hand on his elbow.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione pleaded, “we need to <em> go </em> before he gets up or the others find us!”</p><p>“But Hermione-”</p><p>“Ron’s probably already waiting for us at Headquarters with the locket.”</p><p>“The locket?” Harry pinched his brow at the girl, “What are you talking about, I thought <em> you </em>had it.”</p><p>“I gave it to Mrs. Cattermole to give to Ron,” she explained with a worried glance at the blond, “<em> please,</em> Harry, I’ll explain later, but we need to go <em> now</em>!”</p><p>Harry clenched his teeth, looking between the witch and the boy slowly sitting up, and gave a curt nod. Hermione sighed in relief, leading the way back through the black door. They moved to the center of the round room, cautiously, but none of the doors opened, and all remained still. Harry counted one door less than he remembered, but he was too on the alert for it to completely register. Hermione also looked perplexed as she led them to what she presumed was the door out- the one with the vault-like knob in the center. They opened it back to back, wands at the ready for the Death Eaters sure to be waiting for them.</p><p>However, again, they were only met with emptiness. The long corridor looked strange, too, the more Harry looked at it, and not only for the lack of wizards trying to attack them. There was a thin black carpet lining the floor all the way down, the stones themselves took on more of a blue tint than the dark green he used to dream of for months on end. The pair moved down the hall slowly, anticipating an attack that never came.</p><p>When they got to the lift, Harry looked at Hermione. “Do you think this another room?”</p><p>The witch frowned, “I-I don’t-”</p><p>“<em>Diffindo!</em>” Draco’s voice boomed from the end of the corridor.</p><p>Harry threw himself at Hermione and into the gold gilded lift before the spell could hit; it immediately began moving up. They heard the Death Eater curse, running to catch up with them.</p><p><em> ‘Level 8: Atrium’ </em> the disembodied lift voice announced, though it wasn’t the same melodic woman’s voice Harry knew- instead, very clearly a man’s voice that was much more curt.</p><p>Harry looked at Hermione in bewilderment when a barn and tawny owl swooped in above them, each carrying sacks full of mail. He heard Hermione gasp beside him, but before the young wizard could comment, there was a firm tug on his arm, and suddenly Harry felt himself being pulled through a tube much too small.</p>
