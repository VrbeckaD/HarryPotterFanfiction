    <p>Stepping out of the shower, Hermione walked to the room at the back, careful that her towel did not fall. This room belonged to her parents and occasionally Hermione used it to get ready when she planned to go out. Tonight she would meet with her friends by the coast, so she indeed needed the full-length mirror her parents had. Her own room lacked that necessity simply because the room was too small. Their apartment here that they used during the summer holidays had two rooms, one kitchen and a living room. The best thing about the place was its spacious balcony, actually. They even shared one bathroom! Buildings in this street were more or less as big as theirs, except for the one mansion to their left. It belonged to some rich family whose son has been a pain in the arse throughout her childhood. World, simply, wasn't fair.</p>
<p>Hermione closed the door behind her and dismissed her thoughts. She was going to meet with Harry, Ron and the rest of the gang. They were gathering to celebrate Lavender's birthday. Since the blonde girl and Ron have been an item since last year, one would think the girl would stop being jealous of Hermione (her own crush to Ronald had ended before the dunderhead could view her as a female) but truth was that Hermione was sick of Lavender Brown. She constantly put down Hermione with a snide comment whenever their friend group was out in the public. If anyone could find a fault at Hermione being the president of the university congress, that would be dear Lavender.</p>
<p>So tonight, Hermione was going to wear a short leather skirt and put on her best makeup with matching red lips to her top. Oh, she would have fun making Lavender <em>jealous</em>! It wasn't academics that the girl accepted defeat, but rather she valued looks and having the spotlight of the night. Well, Hermione could very well challenge her at that. Enough to get on the girl's nerves was fine by Hermione.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Hermione first went to draw the curtains of the room. Making sure her towel wouldn't slide off, she quickly handled the curtains but the narrow crack that was left open, she thought wouldn't be a problem. Hardly anybody lived in the mansion across anyway.</p>
<p>Then, she got her moisturizer to apply them to her legs. It wasn't late in the evening, so the light coming from that crack of curtains to her left was adequate. Still, as she rose to correct her head towel, Hermione decided it would be better to do her makeup in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Getting sick of the towel that could hardly contain her mess of hair, Hermione shed it off. She grabbed her thong from the bed, bent over and wore the lacy garment. Honestly, the first hour of wearing those particular knickers always made Hermione hyper aware and it was a conflicting feeling of both sexiness and embarrassment, but Hermione was brave if nothing else.</p>
<p>Her knickers worn, Hermione opted to tie her hair back. At the act of twisting her curls at the back of her head, she realized she didn't have any hairbands.</p>
<p>Looking for something to tie her hair with, she caught a glimpse at her reflection from the mirror across. Like this, her arms stretched and bent at the elbows toward the back, her tits looked round and perky. The dip of her waist towards her flat stomach accentuated her womanly curves, and the seldom realization that she was a damn hot <em>woman</em> flashed in her mind. She rarely felt that way in jeans and sweaters, and not to mention the lack of a boyfriend did some damage to her female ego due to the scant compliments.</p>
<p>But looking at herself now only in her knickers made the heat to pool in her cheeks and her sex to tingle so very lightly but sweetly. Oh, sweet circe, she was getting wet! Not like she could attend to herself when she was running late to their meeting.</p>
<p>At that last alarming thought, something else caught Hermione's attention.</p>
<p>To her left, between the opening of the curtains, she noticed a shadow.</p>
<p>She realized there was a pair of shoes first. Then her gaze followed dark grey trousers, to see a man wearing a sharp suit with a red tie.</p>
<p>It was the third floor of the mansion across from here, which was set at a level slightly higher than their apartment. The bedroom at the back directly faced the one she was in right now, but till now Hermione had hardly ever seen anyone occupying it.</p>
<p>Caught at the leer of the man behind the vast window of the mansion, Hermione could only think: <em>but the lights were off!</em></p>
<p>And they indeed were. Hermione could hardly distinguish anything but his hard eyes and prominent jaw. Also his light blonde hair.</p>
<p>Shame combusted her veins the same moment she gasped and let go of her hair to cover her breasts.</p>
<p>She was aware her arms barely covered anything, so with a small shriek, Hermione leapt forward to close the curtains, or at least get behind it.</p>
<p>Oh, for the love of God, what had just happened?! The man had seen her naked! She was stupid, stupid, <em>stupid</em>. Shit, shit shit.</p>
<p>A mantra of curse words was halted with one thought banging her head: Who was he?</p>
<p>And how long had he been there?</p>
<p>Resting her hand at her sternum, she somewhat organized her breaths and finally, stepped away from the curtains. She made sure they were closed before wearing the rest of her clothes in haste. Even when she was done, she <em>felt</em> naked.</p>
<p>And horrifyingly it made her heartbeat accelerate, especially when she realized her knickers were thoroughly damp.</p>
<p>Oh, God, did she… like it?</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes and an image of her, the one she saw in the mirror but from a perspective that could only be seen through the opposite mansion, flashed in her mind. She just imagined how she looked in his eyes and she wondered what he thought. Did he think her sexy? Was he turned on? He had seen her naked! It must have affected him somehow.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head and whispered repeatedly, "Get over it, Hermione. Get. Over. It. It didn't happen."</p>
<p>She could act like this never happened. That, she would do. What else could she do? Freak out over who had seen her? Minding the owners of the mansion, Hermione could only guess it was Draco Malfoy's, what, father or something, but in the end, Hermione didn't know.</p>
<p>And she wouldn't know with how reserved the family was, regardless of a spoiled dick they had as a son.</p>
<p>Hermione checked her appearance from the full-length mirror and finally concluded herself to be calm enough to go back to do her make-up and tell her parents she was leaving.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, Hermione walked back to the window of the room. Her trembling hands hesitantly cracked open the curtains and she peeked through. Breath held, she intently gazed across the window but only found the darkness of the empty mansion.</p>
<p>He wasn't there, whoever he had been.</p>
<p>Hermione took a step back, but in a daring move, she opened the curtains full till the end. She didn't have anything to hide. <em>This</em>, whatever that had happened, didn't mean anything. What could it change, really?</p>
<p>Finally, at ease, if only a bit shook and tensed from the earlier exchange, Hermione made her way inside. Harry called just then, and she happily switched into the normalcy that was her life.</p>
