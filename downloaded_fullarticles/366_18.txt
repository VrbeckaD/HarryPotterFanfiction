    <p>Severus Snape belongs to the “lucky ones” whose life has always been completely in the gutter. Now, having surrounded himself with muggle books on psychology, he surmises that he has spent many pounds in vain - he already knows that his problems come from childhood.</p><p>People who had the misfortune of being acquainted with Tobias Snape could agree without a doubt that this man’s child was doomed. Joining the ranks of nazi-wizards, immersing himself in dark magic, contributing to the murder of the last person who was kind to him, spying and almost dying from the bite of a giant snake - Severus grunts unhappily, thinking that he has lived up to the expectations. </p><p>While Potter is whitewashing the name of his former professor - and the boy cannot be accused of lack of enthusiasm - he is hiding in the distant muggle area of London. Snape's life is a routine burden nowadays - he takes potions on Tuesdays and Fridays and rubs a salve into the scars on his neck. He brews only for himself: there is no strength left to take orders, and the magical exhaustion has not yet passed. He spends the galleons and pounds given by Albus on porridge, milk, required ingredients, owl mail services and these books on muggle psychology that turned out to be a waste of time, money and paper.</p><p>It’s not that Severus was counting on any revelations when he was heading to the bookshop nearby, but the elderly muggle from the flat across the hall - the half-deaf Mrs. Yates, who has a weakness for poking her nose in other people's affairs - is firmly convinced that he has depression, and suggests consulting a psychologist. After so many years, he feels attached to her gentle manners and South Welsh accent, but he never paid much attention to her concerns - he had returned to this flat only when the pressure of the Dark Lord and Dumbledore became unbearable. He reads what depression is - and Mrs. Yeats' worries now seem reasonable to him. Severus doubts that he looked healthy in May.</p><p>Mrs. Yates, who knocks on his door every night at eight, asks, “Samuel! Are you home?” and knocks again. At the very beginning, she misheard his name, and Severus was in no hurry to correct her - he did not care back then. He also doesn’t care now about what’s happening with his name in the magical community: Potter made up a tearful love story about him and Lily Evans, and the nonsense has grown into a giant pile of absolute rubbish ever since - Severus questions the sanity of the people who read and support this. He is subscribed to The Sunday Prophet to catch up with the most important news but habitually ignores the scandalous interviews from former classmates, colleagues, and students about him. He would have gladly canceled the subscription if it had not been for the deep-rooted paranoia that Potter would soon come to his senses, accuse him of all mortal sins, then Severus would have to flee to America - some time ago the American Potions Association had invited him to an exclusive Wolfsbane project, and the aurors would not dare to come across the ocean. In the worst case, he can get lost in Europe, he has a collection of hair and a stock of Polyjuice Potion enough for two years.</p><p>He buys food at the Tesco down the road, walks along a narrow street to the park, goes around a small theater, turns back, walks on the opposite side of the park, past a small bookshop, past a sex-shop, flashing its vulgar violet sign, and finally comes up to his flat. Severus is not bothered by the receipt - the sum is always more than acceptable - he does not like that park, he is not interested in muggle performance, the only books he bought turned out to be useless and the sex-shop bewildered him at first but now this feeling is gone too.</p><p>Salve, breakfast, a walk to Tesco, lunch, brewing, rest, dinner, a chat with Mrs. Yeats, sleep. Somewhere in there, within those simple routine things, Severus should be happy, but apparently, the Dark Lord wasn't the only problem. “The problem is in your childhood,” muggle books insist. Severus makes tea and adds milk, recalling poverty, insults, and beatings, constant distrust, and expectation of the worst... He is used to constant vigilance, and it is hard to abandon such a useful habit - as soon as Severus lets his guard down, he might get hit by Avada Kedavra. The war may be over for Potter, but the former spy has to live with a marked forearm for the rest of his life.</p><p>He reads the chapter on depression and sees nothing terrible in it. Self-loathing, irritability, decreased libido, change in appetite - dear Merlin, that’s nothing. Insomnia and unexplained pains seem unpleasant, but there are potions for these that Severus has been taking for more than a dozen years. He has no idea how muggles make do without special brews. Then he reads about post-traumatic stress disorder, puts down the book and pours his cold tea into the sink. He prefers not to use magic - it will take a long time to restore it.</p><p>An owl sits on the windowsill and taps on the glass with its beak. This is the only bird to bypass the anti-owl barrier of his flat, that has been protecting his London shelter so far. Minerva McGonagall knows about his whereabouts, and she is under Fidelius charm, so Severus uses the lightest of scanning spells, confirming the absence of dark magic curses and artifacts. His hand instantly grows numb, and he rubs his muscles, then opens the window to let the owl fly in. The owl hoots softly and sits on the table, extending a clawed foot with a letter. The bird takes its time and steals a half-eaten sandwich from the plate, while Severus is dealing with the envelope. Apparently, the owl was instructed to wait for an answer and disturb his peace with tenacity.</p><p>Hogwarts' stamped parchment is covered in the wide handwriting of the headmistress, and Severus automatically skips the greetings and two paragraphs of polite questions about life and health to stumble upon "the school needs you". It seems that reconstruction is in full swing, and, as it is extensively stated in another paragraph, there are enough workers, but they can’t do anything about the dungeons without the head of Slytherin house and Horace Slughorn is unavailable. The owl is scratching the table impatiently, and Severus ponders the reasons he is going to list after the words "forget about the dungeons". He was locked there for seven years of his youth, then another sixteen years of adulthood, protecting his students from the prejudices of other houses. He sincerely wants the dungeons to remain flooded.</p><p>Severus writes, “Dear Minerva, unfortunately, I am also unavailable. As for the dungeons, I am firmly convinced that living in damp, dark and cold rooms is harmful to children. If my opinion is important to you, consider relocating Slytherin dormitories to somewhere else”. He folds the parchment, ties it to the owl's paw, puts several knuts in the bag, and lets the bird out into the street.</p><p>The Slytherins needed him, the Order of the Phoenix needed him, the school needed him, the innumerable amount of people saying “you should” or “you must” still make Severus nauseous. He looks at the torn sandwich with an air of melancholy and throws it into a bucket, then sighs and decides to postpone the trip to Tesco for the evening. Or tomorrow, he has lost his appetite.</p><p>He lies on a small sofa and puts his legs on the armrest. Severus will soon be forty, he has survived two wars, become a killer, almost gotten killed, and all he has to show for it is a muggle den on the outskirts of London, next to a bookshop and sex-shop. According to The Sunday Prophet, he has been awarded the Second Class Order of Merlin. A half-empty, tiny flat and an Order of Merlin - sounds better somehow.</p><p>Severus contemplates muggle depression and books on psychology, but superficially, thinking thoughts like "Mrs. Yates is still worried" or "The shop assistant insisted on these books." His memories of childhood, the mistakes and betrayals seem to drive energy out and freeze him from the inside with a non-verbal Stupefy. That is why Severus prefers not to remember at all, focusing on potions and survival - and after the victory, only Tesco, a salve for his neck and two Restorative potions remained.</p><p>He skips lunch again, just looking at the ceiling, then a mechanical alarm clock shakes him out of a trance. It is in a small, polished-to-a-shine cauldron, and the ringing sounds throughout the flat so piercingly that Severus winces and lifts himself off the sofa with great effort. Brewing the salve for his throat is just as entertaining as looking at the ceiling; all movements are brought to senseless automatism, causing him to fall back into a state of indifference. Occasionally, Severus would be interrupted and filled with dread by the next Sunday Prophet or someone knocking on his door... or seeing a gray-haired old man with a white beard in the park's shadow or the Weasley twin in a red telephone box.</p><p>It often seems to him that they are close - those who did not survive the war. Nymphadora Tonks, being reflected in any teenage girl with brightly dyed hair, a cashier from Tesco who looks like the Creevey brother, even a black-haired postwoman with long curly hair and wide eyes, and he can’t look at her without shuddering. There is probably an explanation for this in some of the muggle books on psychology.</p><p>When Severus finally leaves the flat to buy groceries, he still does not feel hunger, although it is already eight o'clock in the evening and it’s gloomy on the streets. The bookshop is closed when he walks past, wrapping himself in a black coat. It is not crowded at the shop, Severus pays for the potatoes, deciding that it is worth diversifying his poor menu: swallowing solid food is still painful, but he can’t stand soup anymore.</p><p>The walk down the street to the park is gray, the park paths are gray among dirty green lawns, the theater is gray, everything is gray. The glass of the red telephone box is also gray. Otherwise, only the blue jacket that was being worn by a young man on the other side of the street and the purple sign of a 24-hour sex-shop have color. Snape turns his head abruptly, causing the scars on his neck to tighten, and peers over at the man, trying to get a closer look, then retreats immediately, slamming through the door of the nearest shop.</p><p>Severus gasps, trying to pull himself together, but the panic is paralyzing. His encounter with Nagini may have injured him, but, fortunately, his reflexes remain fast. Did Potter notice him? Is that even Potter? They should not be looking for a former spy, and if they are, then this is definitely not to present him with the Order of Merlin - Minerva would have contacted him instead. Plan B time? Has he accumulated enough magic to apparate home? They could be waiting for him there, his wards have not been renewed for a long time. Where to now? No one was going to forgive him for Dumbledore's death - it was a trap, and he, an old fool, lost vigilance, believed the articles in the Prophet. They distracted his attention, made him feel safe.</p><p>A polite cough is heard behind him, and Severus winces.</p><p>“Hello!” says a girl in a purple polo. “The shop is empty now so you don't have to worry about privacy. I can close the door if you want.”</p><p>He nods and says hoarsely, ”Yes, please.”</p><p>Potter won’t break the door open in a muggle area, although only Merlin knows what the boy can actually do.</p><p>The girl comes up, turns the key and says, “Our assortment appeals to customers with a wide variety of tastes! Are you interested in essentials like condoms and lubricants or toys and accessories? We also have videos, literature, and periodicals.”</p><p>Snape takes his eyes off the door and focuses on the word that makes the most sense to him.</p><p>”Literature.”</p><p>The girl turns left and he follows, making sure to stand behind a rack so that he is not visible from the door.</p><p>“Typically, our clients prefer erotic novels, but we also have literature on sexology and health. This book about men's health is very popular...”</p><p>Severus does not listen, just gives her the money.</p><p>“I’ll take it. Now I would like to look around on my own. Thank you for your help.”</p><p>When it is necessary to avoid attention, he knows how to behave, although it is difficult to keep his character in check — for Merlin’s sake, what novels was the girl blabbering about, the aurors are waiting for him in his flat with a one-way ticket to Azkaban! They have found him. They must have tracked the owl.</p><p>Severus feels it in the back of his head that the girl is watching him, he forces himself to walk past the racks, rustling a small plastic bag from Tesco and faking interest. It was then that he paid attention to the shelves and realized he was surrounded by artificial vaginas and that, oh Merlin, he managed to hide in the neighboring round-the-clock sex-shop.</p><p>He spends another five minutes full of discomfort near lady parts, then he moves to the other wall and is met with colorful, erect penises. Driving away thoughts of dark magic rituals that might require real human bits, he glances at the door and whispers a simple spell to see through the wall. The street is empty, and a prickly numbness rolls through his arm – he’d better forget  about apparition altogether.</p><p>“Anything else?” the girl asks, and Severus shakes his head and moves towards the door. “Don't forget your change and the book!”</p><p>The consultant sticks a dark, opaque bag into his hands with a couple of bills, unlocks the door, and Severus goes outside. The street is still empty, the entrance and the staircase are empty too. The wards are undisturbed, proving that he must be a mad, paranoid, old man. He barely unclenches the hand that is holding his wand, which he has been hiding behind the bags. He places the groceries on the table, looks at the new book which has a drawing of a cock on its cover and sighs wearily.</p>
