    <p>Harry sat stiffly on the bench in the small wooden boat as he was occasionally hit with spray from the sea. His <em>impervious</em> charm was holding, but that didn’t stop the chill from the Northern Sea from cutting right through his Auror robes. Ron sputtered from beside him when a particularly nasty swell caught him off guard. Harry renewed the repelling charm on his friend.</p>
<p>“Thanks, mate,” Ron said, drying off his face on the sleeve of his robes. “How much longer d’you reckon?”</p>
<p>“Probably another half hour to the island. I’m more worried about how long it will be until we can get into our beds. I’m knackered,” Harry said, yawning. He turned to look at the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol Officer who was steering the boat from the seat behind them; he looked bored as he held his wand over his shoulder, making small adjustments every few minutes to combat the waves and wind.</p>
<p>“Don’t let me forget to send an owl to Hermione tonight before we crash. She was pretty upset this morning when I left and I promised her I’d write her as soon as we got settled,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“At least we’ll have weekend leave once a month,” Harry said, trying to find a bright side in their first assignment.</p>
<p>They both successfully graduated from their two-year-long Auror training on Friday and spent much of their weekend at various pubs celebrating with friends. Unfortunately, there wasn’t time to relax and recover from their gruelling training, or their weekend activities, as they were both assigned rotation at Azkaban starting immediately.</p>
<p>One of Kingsley Shacklebolt’s first orders of business as Minister was to immediately remove all dementors from Azkaban. While most wizards and witches were glad to see them go, as they’d proven to not be trustworthy allies, there was still an outcry at the idea of the prison being less securely guarded. A compromise was to be found in a rotating guard of Aurors. There were permanent guards, as well, mostly pulled out of the ranks of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Patrol Division, but there were now always to be Aurors on site as well. Aurors were the best equipped to deal with any breakout attempts and attacks, but, more importantly, they made the public feel better about their own safety.</p>
<p>Since no established Aurors, particularly those with families at home, were going to volunteer to go live on a god-forsaken rock in the middle of the North Sea with some of the worst witches and wizards alive, a plan was put in place. All new Aurors would be assigned for one year Azkaban duty at some point within their first three years, after training was completed and they were officially Junior Aurors. After their year-long rotation was done, they would only be called back to rotation if absolutely necessary and for shorter increments. This would be the third year for this new plan and the first year with enough new Aurors that Senior Aurors didn’t have to rotate in to provide support.</p>
<p>This allowed the Auror force to keep their best and most experienced talent in the field and at the Ministry. Additionally, it kept the Senior Aurors happy, and as Robards also pointed out, it would do the new Aurors some good to understand where they were sending people. And “if nothing else,” Robards had said, “It’ll toughen you lot up.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron were part of a larger cohort of new Aurors than typical. They had lost more than a few Aurors through the duration of the war, and they’d received approval for a few additional positions as compensation for Aurors now being stationed at Azkaban.</p>
<p>Harry was beyond relieved when he found out he’d been assigned to this rotation with Ron —an assignment that he, like all the new recruits, was not looking forward to. He’d overheard one of the Senior Aurors say that both Ron and he were sent on rotation first because Robards wanted to get them in the field as soon as possible. Others from their training class would go on rotation at some point over the next three years, being stuck on the typical tasks for brand new Junior Aurors like administrative paperwork and low risk assignments in the meantime. Even though Harry was dreading this assignment, he was glad to get it over with. If they both just grit their teeth and got through the year, they wouldn’t have to deal with another rotation for a long time, if ever.</p>
<p>The fortress grew larger on the horizon as the rickety boat neared the island. Harry couldn’t quite shake the chill that was permeating his entire body. He knew the dementors were gone, but somehow even at this distance, he could feel a ghost of their presence. He felt a sense of dread join the chill as he thought about having to spend an entire year here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The centuries old architecture of the prison reminded Harry a little of Hogwarts, if Hogwarts had never seen joy or love or even a single smile. The fortress was made entirely of rough grey stone, causing the air inside to feel more damp and chilly than the North Sea air that whipped across the island.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron followed the MLE officer into the prison, carrying their shrunken trunks that held all their belongings for the year. Once through the large wooden doors, they walked through several winding dark hallways. The torches on the walls gave just enough light to find one’s way, but added no warmth or comfort.</p>
<p>The offices were on the main floor, just a little ways down from the main entrance. As they walked into the front office, they saw two Aurors sitting in stuffed chairs with bags and shrunken trunks in front of them in what appeared to be a make-shift waiting area. To their left, two MLE officers sat at their desks, hunched over paperwork, and looked up in acknowledgement as Harry and Ron walked in the door behind the officer from the boat.</p>
<p>“About time!” said Alicia Spinnet as she saw them come through the doors. She had been the only new Auror to complete training in the last few years due to the war, so she had been partnered with different Senior Aurors that came on a month-long rotation all year.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Harry said, shaking her hand in greeting. Ron gave her a short wave.</p>
<p>“Are you two ready to go?” the officer from the boat asked Alicia and Auror Savage, who had just stood up from his chair.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” replied Alicia.</p>
<p>“Aurors Potter and Weasley,” Auror Savage said in greeting. “We can call you that now, right? You both managed to pass your exams, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Harry said smiling.</p>
<p>“Well good, we’ll both be glad to get the hell out of here.” He clapped Ron on the shoulder as he moved towards the door.</p>
<p>“Anything we should know?” Ron asked Alicia as she grabbed her belongings.</p>
<p>“Other than this place has all the charm of a dementor’s playground? And the excitement of raising flobberworms?” She headed towards the door, following the MLE officer and Savage, relief clearly written on her face. “Have fun!” She called out behind her.</p>
<p>Another MLE officer walked into the office from what looked to be a connecting office. He was a larger, strongly built man with short brown hair that was greying slightly on the sides. He looked like a man you didn’t want to mess with.</p>
<p>“Aurors Potter and Weasley. Welcome,” he said. “I’m Officer Durum, and I’m a shift supervisor here. The prison has two shift supervisors, six permanent MLE guards, a Healer, and several officers as support staff members here. This here is Miller and Thame.” The two officers looked up and nodded at the two Aurors. Harry and Ron nodded back.</p>
<p>“This is the main office, we receive visitors here and run checks on them.” He nodded towards the two chairs that Alicia and Auror Savage had been sitting in. “Very few inmates receive visitors—only immediate family are allowed and few are interested in making the journey out here. But, we will occasionally have visitors here on business from the Ministry. Otherwise, the only people you’ll see in here are MLE patrol officers or Aurors. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Durum walked them over to a short hallway that came out of the other side of the main office. There were only a few doors down each side.</p>
<p>“Offices are down here. You’ll be sharing this office here,” he said, opening a door to a small cramped space that held two desks placed up against opposite walls, at each desk was an uncomfortable looking wooden chair. He closed the door and continued to walk down the hallway pointing out offices and who worked in each one.</p>
<p>They walked into a somewhat larger office at the end of the hall. It had several large cabinets lining three of the walls and a desk and chair pushed up against the wall to the right.</p>
<p>“This is the records room. The prisoner’s files are all kept here,” Officer Durum said, gesturing to a drawer in the cabinet next to the desk.</p>
<p>“In the next few days, read through them and familiarise yourself with the inmates. There are notes in there from other guards and previous Aurors on the prisoners—who to watch out for, past attempts at escape, assaults on guards, and so on. Some of the inmates are just better to keep clear from, they get too much joy from insulting the guards. It’s better to let them stew in their solitude. We rarely have fighting amongst prisoners as they are all kept in solitary confinement, but it’s been known to happen a time or two when moving prisoners between cells or for visitation, for those that are allowed visitors.</p>
<p>“Your primary job is to keep an eye on the prisoners, but you’ll also keep up daily logs for the facility and assist with prisoner transportation within the facility for new or released prisoners and for visitation. You’ll be on afternoons, with a rotating weekend schedule with one weekend off a month with shore leave.”</p>
<p>“If they are all stuck in their cells day and night, what exactly are we doing to keep an eye on them?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Just walk by their cells and make sure there aren’t any problems. We have an infirmary for sick prisoners. Of course, most of them try to fake it just to get out of their cells for awhile, so only bring them down there if they look close to death.” Durum laughed at his own joke. “And, make sure they aren’t trying to hurt themselves either—wouldn’t want them to get out of their sentence prematurely,” Durum said with a grin that turned Harry’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll give you the grand tour,” Durum said, walking back toward the main office and to the hallway that would lead back to the rest of the prison. Harry and Ron dutifully followed, sharing a look between them. This was going to be a long year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sat down with a pile of inmate files in the records room. He was feeling too nerved up to sleep even with the exhausted stated he’d arrived in. They’d followed Durum around the prison, through the three floors of cells, the kitchen where several house elves prepared food for both prisoners and staff, the infirmary, which was really just two rooms with beds and a nearby office for the Healer, the visitation rooms, and finally their rooms which were on the second floor just above the offices.</p>
<p>Ron and Harry each got a small suite of rooms. The sitting room had two worn stuffed chairs and a hearth. A small kitchenette was along the wall opposite the hearth, but Harry wasn’t sure it would be good for more than making tea. He assumed he’d take most meals in the staff dining room off the main kitchens. On the back wall of the sitting room were two doors. One led to a cramped bedroom with a small bed against one wall and a nightstand. The other went to a small bathroom with shower, toilet and sink. All basic necessities had been provided for and nothing more.</p>
<p>Harry had tried to settle down and get some sleep, but after the second hour of tossing and turning, he threw some clothes on and decided to get to work. Might as well make use of the time, since sleep was clearly not on order.</p>
<p>He flipped through the files, only half reading the notes, just getting a sense for the names and crimes. While he had walked through all the cell blocks on his tour, he didn’t get a good look at most of the prisoners. They all wore identical grey rags that had probably been robes at one time, and with the exception of a few that screamed at them as they walked by, most sat huddled in on themselves in a corner of the room or on their thin mattress that sat on the hard stone floor. The only thing Durun said about them was to never open their cells unless they were restrained, ideally both physically by chains and magically.</p>
<p>Harry knew that everyone in these walls had committed terrible crimes to end up there, but he still felt himself disturbed at the notion of anyone living in these conditions. And, the idea of Sirius living here, under even worse conditions with the dementor guards, permeated his thoughts more than once that first day.</p>
<p>The prisoner’s files seemed to be organised by prosecution date, so he didn’t recognise any of the names at the top of the pile. Many of the crimes turned his stomach sour.</p>
<p>As he got deeper into the stack, he started seeing more names that he recognised: Dolohov, Rookwood. His stomach suddenly dropped out when he opened the next file. Umbridge.</p>
<p>She was serving life in Azkaban for war crimes, including being responsible for the torture and imprisonment of many muggle-born wizards and witches, She was also convicted of being responsible for several of their deaths, some in the very walls of that prison. Harry shuddered. Even with all that he’d seen, there were very few people he hated more than her. He was suddenly filled with dread at the idea he’d ever have to speak to her again. He wondered if he should feel some vindication to see her there, locked up and suffering, but found that while he was relieved she was locked up, he still didn’t want to see her ever again.</p>
<p>Harry flipped to the next file: Lucius Malfoy. Another wizard that Harry was relieved to see behind bars for the rest of his life. But, he felt a little sick to his stomach knowing what was coming next. Narcissa Malfoy, and then… Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Harry had spoken at both of their trials, for what little good it had done. He supposed that they may have wound up with longer sentences had he not spoken on their behalf. Harry knew Malfoy had done some fairly terrible things during the war, even if he felt pressured and under threat of death for some of them. But, even if some punishment was deserved, it was still unnerving to think of a classmate in these walls. This was someone he had competed against in Quidditch and attended class with for years.</p>
<p>Even now that his feelings towards him had mellowed from the hatred he’d felt in his younger years, he couldn’t find himself liking Malfoy. But, he also he couldn’t help but feel a sense of connection to him. Maybe it was all the years of fighting in their youth, maybe it was the stalking and taunting, or maybe it was the last year of the war when Harry had understand how perilous Malfoy’s situation had been. Or maybe it was knowing that Dumbledore had wanted to give him a second chance and he’d been too afraid to take it, and that moment eventually led to Malfoy locked up here.</p>
<p>He felt a jolt at the realisation that he must have seen Malfoy earlier that day. He looked in every cell they had passed, which meant he hadn’t even recognised him.</p>
<p>Harry hadn’t forgotten that Malfoy was in there, exactly. But, he hadn’t really thought about it either, certainly not in the last week when he’d found out his assignment. He read this file a little more carefully. He was a little over half way through his prison sentence, having been giving four years in Azkaban with an additional two years probation once released. In the past two years, he’d had no demerits for bad behavior; there wasn’t much in his file at all. Just a couple notes that he rarely spoke and had no visitors. Harry made a mental note of the cell number for reasons he didn't quite understand and forced himself to move on.</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alicia wasn’t kidding,” Ron said around a mouthful of mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry said breaking out of his daze. They sat in the staff dining area alone, eating what was left from dinner. Since they were on the afternoon shift for the duration of their rotation, they had quickly adjusted to eating dinner around 8:30 most nights.</p>
<p>“About how boring this is. I thought, you know, these are the worst criminals in the whole country to wind up here, there’d be some… action or something.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, although I’m not sure that’s the kind of action I’m hoping for,” Harry replied, poking at his mystery meat.</p>
<p>“Oh, well, we can always try to find you someone to hook up with when we have weekend leave next week.”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry replayed their conversation in his head. “No! I mean not that I don’t want… but, that’s not what I meant! I just meant that I feel like I fought half these people for years, I’d rather not keep fighting the same people over and over. It’s kind of a depressing thought.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Yeah, I guess I’m just so bored. Makes me almost miss the days our lives were constantly in danger. We need a good solid puzzle to solve to save our lives right about now.” Ron took a frustrated bite out of a piece of buttered bread. “How are we going to do this for a year?”</p>
<p>“No idea. Do you want me to come by for chess later after I do my rounds?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Ron said without enthusiasm. They’d been playing chess nightly and Ron had been getting increasingly exasperated by Harry’s limited playing style. Ron insisted they played the exact same game at least twice already, but Harry couldn’t really tell the difference.</p>
<p>“Ok, might as well go get this over with, I’ll be by when I’m done.” Harry picked up his plate and silverware to put them in the dirty dish bin, where he could only assume it got transported to the kitchen sinks for cleaning.</p>
<p>Ron wasn’t exaggerating about the boredom. They were only three weeks in and Harry was ready to pull his hair out. Their job basically consisted of walking every hallway of the large fortress over and over again. They had to walk the outer areas, disused corridors and perimeter to look for anything “suspicious” and they had to walk the hallways with the cells and prisoners several times during their shift, as Durum had said, “keep an eye on them.”</p>
<p>The Aurors stationed at the prison also got later shifts and more of the boring paperwork. There seemed to be some tension between the MLE Patrol Officers and the Aurors. Harry got the sense from Officer Heigel, one of the permanent guards, that the MLE officers weren’t thrilled that Aurors needed to be there just so that people felt safe—suggesting that the officers were somehow incapable of keeping the prison safe on their own. So, they got even in their own little ways with assigning out the worst and most dull tasks to whichever Aurors were stationed there at the time. At the end of the day, it was still their ship.</p>
<p>While irritated to learn that his life was going to be just a little bit more frustrating and dull due to this animosity, he didn’t envy them their permanent positions and could kind of understand their position on the whole thing. They’d be here much much longer than him and Ron.</p>
<p>Harry finished walking the perimeter and headed back inside to start going through all the hallways. He always started with the exterior because the blast of chilly sea air was usually enough to wake him up enough to complete the rounds without his head in the clouds. He walked through hallway after hallway and doing a perfunctory check of all rooms that were on the required check. His last stop was the prisoners. Even though they could go in any order they wanted, he always started on the fourth floor and ended on the second so that he was closer to his rooms.</p>
<p>The fourth floor held some of the more volatile prisoners. Harry couldn’t tell if they’d done this on purpose, or it was just happenstance and they got each other more wound up, but it led to him starting off every round on the prisoner blocks with being cursed and occasionally spit at.</p>
<p>He cast a strong <em>impervious</em> and started down the hall.</p>
<p>“Bastard mudblood lover! Blood traitor piece of shite bastard - he’ll come back you know - he’ll come for you - you’ll get yours”</p>
<p>“Hey hey! I’ve got names to trade - just let me talk to someone - I’m telling the truth this time, please!”</p>
<p>Harry worked his way past the on-slaught of the first few cells, when he saw spit coming from the fourth cell straight at him. It landed on his charm and slid down. He glanced up at the man in the cell and received an ugly grin full of black and crooked and missing teeth. The man started laughing.</p>
<p>Harry looked ahead and kept working his way down the hall, looking in cells a little more closely when someone was sleeping to ensure everyone was still alive and well—at least as well as could be expected under these conditions. He was spit at a couple more times before he made it to the hall and called a few names he wasn’t even sure he knew the meaning of.</p>
<p>He drew in a deep breath as he closed the heavy door to the hallway behind him. He wasn’t sure he was ever going to get used to that.</p>
<p>The third floor was far less eventful. Some of the inmates paced their cells, others would often be found sleeping or curled up on their mattresses. The elder Malfoys were housed on this floor on the far ends of the hall from each other. So far, they’d stayed at the back of their cells, either sleeping or huddled in on themselves.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an inmate would be balled up in the corner of their cell, crying. Umbridge was generally found in the corner of her cell or pacing around muttering to herself. Harry had once found himself in front of her cell staring in morbid curiosity, but when she suddenly turned and locked eyes with him, he found himself rapidly moving away. Now, he always tried to move past her cell quickly.</p>
<p>He checked the last two cells on the third floor, he’d never seen either of these inmates awake. He wondered if some of the inmates were more active during the day, or if they were trying to sleep their sentences away.</p>
<p>When he got halfway down the second floor hallway, he paused and looked into one of the cells a little more carefully.</p>
<p>He could barely make out the light blonde hair on the head of the prisoner. The hair was grimy and dirty, taking on an almost light brown-grey tinge. The figure was lying on his side with his back to the rest of his cell, curled up on a thin and dirty grey mattress.</p>
<p>There was a hole in the floor near the corner of the room and a small stone half circle basin that stuck out of the wall about a foot away. Harry knew from watching other prisoners that they could get a small stream of water from a slit in the stone wall above the basin. Not enough to bathe or wash up, but if they were patient, enough to stay hydrated. If one of the other inmates was to be believed, all the water that came out tasted like dirt and lake water. Harry wondered if it was somehow sea water with the salt removed, as there didn’t seem to be any other water sources for the island. He’d been using <em>aguamenti</em> since arriving, but the prisoners, obviously, did not have access to their wands or magic.</p>
<p>Malfoy had been in this same position every time Harry walked by, to the point that at the end of his first week, Harry had momentarily panicked and wondered if he was dead and no one noticed. He quickly cast a spell to determine that he was, in fact, alive and just sleeping. He then had silently cast a basic health diagnostic spell that Aurors were all taught for field work. It wasn’t like running a full panel, but it could give the casting Auror a high level overview of an individual’s health. According to the spell, Malfoy had not been in danger, but was slightly malnourished and slightly dehydrated. Not enough to be at risk, but enough to weaken him and probably feel fairly terrible.</p>
<p>Running this charm had become a bit of a habit for Harry now every time he went by Malfoy’s cell. He always cast it silently after making sure no one was around or paying attention. It always came back the same.</p>
<p>A few days ago, he’d checked a few other inmates randomly and they all came back within a similar range of both malnourishment and dehydration. They were not at a dangerous level and, Harry thought bitterly, were probably close to what Harry’s range would have been at any point living with the Dursleys. Regardless of any of the crimes that had been committed that landed these inmates in here, starving people, even just a little, would never sit right with Harry. He wondered if he could find out about the type and quantity of rations they were given.</p>
<p>He cast his nightly diagnosis spells on Malfoy and saw that tonight was no difference. Harry exhaled and then continued his rounds.</p>
<p> </p>
