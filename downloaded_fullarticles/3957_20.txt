  <strong>Prologue </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Moonlight spilled in through the torn curtains. Casting light on the blood that covered the wooden floors. A silence laid close to the unmoving body of Severus Snape. The Death Eaters that had swept the floor, now gone. Leaving a heavy silence that coated the memories that still clung to the walls. Snape’s greasy black hair fell back onto dusty floor. The creases on his forehead had relaxed, giving him a younger appearance.</p>
<p>   His long black robes tore across his chest during Nagini’s tight embrace. Exposing his pale skin to the air. He couldn’t appear any more less like himself than he did then. Unmoving, weathered, and worn. The tips of Snape's fingers moved upward. His body ached immensely from the attack hours prior, where Snape almost dared to praise himself for breaking the capsule filled with Saltgrass, moments before Nagini had lunged towards him. He laid there listening to hollers of the war that was one. Had it been them that won? Voldemort was who his mind thought about.</p>
<p>   How he wondered if he should continue if living if that were the case. But, the loud explosions of red and gold caught his eye from the broken window. His heart beat slowed down, leaving a calm sensation to cover him. He focused to summon his wand, there was no need to stay on the ground any longer. If he could only get it, and it were only in his pocket. With the cheers of the crowd on the grounds of Hogwarts, it were only time before Harry had told someone of where he thought his professor were to be found dead. And with that, Snape flicked his wrist, sending his old wand shooting out from under his robes. He grasped the wooden frame in his hand, and vanished.</p>
