    <p>Wynstella and Lakshmi meet up with Nevra on platform 9 ¾, and Wynstella gets a glare from The Weasley, and an uneasy look from his parents.</p><p>(Nevra’s parents. <em>Ginny</em>’s parents, who still don’t know their daughter is dead.)</p><p>(She chases the thought out of her head.)</p><p>She doesn’t blame The Weasley for his hostility. He’s friendly with Lee, after all, it’s only right that he takes her side.</p><p>(She wishes there weren’t sides.)</p><p>---</p><p>“Good holidays, Nevra?”</p><p>Nevra’s hands are fists, so tight her knuckles are white.</p><p>“No. I mean, yes, mostly. But they ended on a bitter taste.<br/>-	The Death Eaters.”</p><p>Nevra flinches.</p><p>“Yes. The <em>Death Eaters</em>. <em>His little lackeys</em>.”</p><p>There’s venom in her voice, and a layer of self-loathing.</p><p>“He’s not you, Nevra. It’s not your fault.”</p><p>Nevra doesn’t relax.</p>
