    <p>
  <span>It was 3 years to the day that Vanessa died and it still hurt. But now, it was more like a stab wound to the abdomen from last week and less like he was gangbanged with multiple sandpaper dildos 5 mins ago. His missing Vanessa shaped jigsaw piece was starting to smooth around the edges and wasn’t so jagged. Still hurt, but nowhere near as much. Wade remembered when the hole in his soul felt like a weird tentacle monster with teeth, so here’s to progress and all that jazz. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the height of irony. Fate had to be feeling extra PMSy when she created Wade's and Vanessa's fates. Vanessa was too vibrant a soul to die of something like breast cancer. Watching her waste away slowly killed Wade a little more each day that she was suffering. How fucked up was it, that he had entered a secret government experiment to escape his disease only for Vanessa to die of the same thing he was trying to avoid. It was to be expected. She passed painlessly in the end doped to her ears in morphine, which is all Wade could ask for.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Still felt like shit.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>However, to add to the shitty feeling on this shitty day, the sky decided to shit weird alien creature monster things right on New York City. The damn things were ugly (and Wade was definitely an authority on all things ugly. Looking in the mirror still made him jump, dive, and aim a gun at his reflection if he didn’t do the necessary pep talk beforehand) and they just kept pouring out of a black hole in the sky like the universe’s form of diarrhea. Maybe the universe should take some Lomotil or get with the BRAT diet and clean that shit up ‘cause today was not the day honey...Sometimes the Blind Al in him came out when he was feeling particularly pissed off. Like now.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>These alien bitches had messed with his day of sorrow and celebrating the magical unicorn life that was Vanessa Wilson aka Mrs. Deadpool. So right now, the awesomely spandexed Deadpool was running and jumping on alien flight machines, chopping heads and generally fucking shit up when all he really wanted to do was listen to Wham! (although that Niall Horan song wasn’t too bad for the occasion) and eat his Sicilian Pistachio and his Salted Caramel Gelato (Talenti Gelato for the win motherfuckers!) until he passed out. It was a shit situation on a shit day and there’d be no surviving metal monster thingies by the time Deadpool was through. He applauded himself when he stabbed an alien in the face causing it to fire at one of the small piloted flying contraptions causing the piloted flying contraption to crash into another piloted flying contraption before they exploded into a shower of metal pieces. One of said pieces flew straight into the face of a flying whale thing which caused it to crash into another flying whale thing and crash to the ground, falling on at least 100 of it’s ugly alien friends.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Man, give props where props were due. Deadpool was damn good, Deadpool knew it and knew how to show it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“9 oclock!” Deadpool spun, dove to the ground and fired on instinct to his direct left nailing an alien right between its beady little eyes. Damn, military training was damn near impossible to escape.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The weapon the thing had been carrying misfired, barely missed his right ear as Deadpool rolled to the left. Holy Sweet Flying Buttered Biscuits that was close!!!! </span>It took Fucking Forever to grow back a head and that pulse weapon (Oooh Deadpool wants Deadpool will definitely take at least 3) would have obliterated one poor little Wade-noggin if he hadn’t thrown himself to the ground. <span>BTWs who yelled the warning? Was it the voice in his head? It </span><em><span>had </span></em><span>been showing up more lately. Props where props were do again, even if it was a disembodied voice. </span>Wait, no, there were sounds of someone walking over the rubble. Good, it was a real person. The talking voices hadn’t taken over yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Um thanks. That would not have been fun to come back from. Man these things are ugly. Those creatures look like Freddy Kreuger, The Mummy and a T-Rex decided making a baby together was the thing to do. And I thought I was hideous. Thanks a bun..whoa.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Before him appeared an absolutely gorgeous man in a black t-shirt and black pants with a half apron wrapped around his waist. He had the greenest eyes staring like Deadpool was a hippopotamus in a tutu. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Come back from... You would be dead, one, and seriously what the fuck?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Awwww a British accent. How cute. Oh. right. The immortal thing was still sorta secret from unknowns. Meh.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. Right. Let’s go with that then.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Green-eyes raised his eyebrow and continued to look like Deadpool had one too many concussions. That was true, but super healing worked wonders on big problems like stabs to the head so really, concussions were a non factor at this point.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Right then. I’ll file that under ‘American Superhero Weirdos in Red Tights’ and be on my way.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, the way to Wade Wilson’s heart is dry wit and sarcasm.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. You do that. Also, shoo. Go hide. Leave the saving to the heroes and go get your beautiful self to safety. Go on, go.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Brit snorted then smirked this little half crooked smile that made Wade want to coo and do the horizontal Argentine Tango and Rumba and Samba at the same time. Maybe get a couple chimichangas in bed afterwards.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I assure you I’ll be just fine.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Green-eyed Handsome then turned to the nearest large flying whale monster and stuck out an open palm. Deadpool watched as the thing crumpled in on itself as the hand closed into a fist. It then fell out of the sky and rolled to a stop right in front of Green Eyes like a building sized bowling ball. The other man nudged the metal ball with his foot before using two fingers to telekinetically (He </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be a telekinetic) send the ball careening into another flying whale. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was probably widely inappropriate to have a boner right now.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was also the only reaction that made sense in Wade Wilson’s head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow. I am so hard right now.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mister Sexy (probably should get a name by now) gaped and then burst into laughter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Still filed under American Superhero Weirdos, WTF.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Again sarcasm makes the world go round and does hardening things to Little (BIG) Deadpool.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can I be your favorite? I can be your Deadpool. Actually, can you just marry me?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The stranger just laughed again before turning back towards the chaos. There was an epic shift in the air that signified a major badass was about to throw shit down like nobody's business. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How about we get rid of the nasty flying aliens and we can talk about this later.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oooh Pinky swear!! It’s a date.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With that Deadpool flew into the battle with renewed vigor and his Vanessa shaped jigsaw piece smoothed out a little more.</span>
