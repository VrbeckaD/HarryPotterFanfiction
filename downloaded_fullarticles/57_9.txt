    <p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy, Lord of the Malfoy family after the passing of his mother and the imprisonment of his father, was having a bad day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was alright when he woke up, the first sight he saw was his husband’s sleeping face. They had got together during his eighth year at Hogwarts after he pulled his head out of his arse and got together when their mutual friends got tired of their oblivious pining for each other. Harry Potter was married to Draco Malfoy after their graduation from Hogwarts and they have been married for three years now and could not be happier about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spent a good portion of the morning just looking at the raven’s sleeping face before getting up to get to work. He’s been working in the Auror forces for two years now and he was honestly questioning why he was still in the line of work. After a year of Auror Academy with bias trainers and two years of jackarse superiors and equally intolerable coworkers, it’s a wonder that he had yet to quit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only reason he could think of was that he stayed was because he wanted to help catch criminals. He wanted to help prevent another Dark Lord by preventing any rising terrors and he felt like he had to atone for what he had done during the war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he walked into work, it looked to be a slow day because everyone was sitting at their desk and doing paperwork for their most recent case. One thing he looked forward to at work was days when he didn’t have to interact with the people that radiated hatred at him every time they looked his way. Since they each had their papers to do, they had no excuse to even look his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Around lunch, Harry joined him for lunch at the Ministry cafeteria which improved his mood. No matter how much paperwork prevented people from getting up from their work it seemed that didn’t stop superiors from giving lectures on non-existent mistakes. How was he supposed to prevent a support beam from falling on his co-worker when he was halfway down the street? In his assigned position. With half of his team. Waiting to capture the wizards the other half of his team was supposed to chase out. Where the f*ck was the rest of the people that were also there!?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It looked like everyone didn’t want to do overtime as everyone was focused on their work after lunch. Draco was the first one to leave since he finished most of his work before lunch and there were no meetings scheduled so he quickly signed out and headed home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was not home when he got there since Harry had a meeting with the Queen. It never stopped impressing him every time he realizes how powerful his husband was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he and Draco graduated, they had gone to Gringotts together to claim their lordships, but they got surprised when the Potter’s account goblin told them Harry had more than just the Potter and Black families to claim. Harry had gone through an inheritance test and the size of his test parchment was shockingly long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently, he was Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Peverell-Selwyn-Windsor. He was the grandson of the queen through his father and inherited three-fourths of Hogwarts through his mother who was apparently from a long line of squibs. The last one-fourth of Hogwarts was by conquest when he defeated Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the goblins saw the evidence of stealing from the Potter, Black, and Selwyn vaults they launched into a whole bunch of investigating that ended up with the once hero Albus Dumbledore losing any reverence he gained. The man would forever be known as the manipulative bastard who abused some, stole from many, destroyed the lives of even more, instead of the heroic leader he said he was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The goblins got back all that was stolen from Harry and contacted the queen. They had met her once in the past. It was during the award ceremony for all the contributors that helped in the war. Harry, Severus, and Neville were knighted by the queen when they received their Order of Merlin First Class for their contributions. They hadn’t known that Harry was related to the English Royal Family but now Harry has weekly tea with the queen, some of which he was also invited as the husband of a prince.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since Harry was at one of his weekly meetups Draco was not expecting anyone to be home so the open door to their house was a surprise. They did not live in one of the manors their families owned as they were only two people and a manor was too much, so they did not have the most secure wards. They did not have house-elves that week as Dobby and Winky were given time off to take care of their newborn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco had his wand at the ready when he went inside, in case this was a repeat of the assassination attempts from before. He expected someone to be waiting for him further in the house, so it took him by surprise when the trespasser slammed the front door, hitting him in the face when he was halfway through the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco was duelling the Death Eater fake as the person had the mask (he had seen enough of them to know that this one was a fake), when Harry came in through the door and joined the duel. When the unknown was back into a wall, he shot off a series of AK’s. One of which nicked Harry before Draco got them with a stunning spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he got to Harry, he sighed a breath of relief when he realized his husband was unconscious instead of dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After calling the Aurors to get the stunned man that turned out to be Asriel Dreemurr, one of the half-bloods from the war that nobody really knew, he immediately went to Gringotts with Harry. Three assassinations in the span of a year were fine, but when someone he loved gets hurt that was too far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Getting forged paperwork and a oneway trip to America was easy. Disappearing from the Britsh Wizarding World was hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He and his accountant goblin were arguing the best way for him to disappear without affecting Harry, as his high status in society would not allow him to die without a major power void to form, when Harry let out a groan and notifying them that he was waking up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love! How are you feeling?” Draco abandoned his conversation to turn to his husband on the hospital bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like a Centaur decided to tap dance on my head. Where are we? What happened?” Draco helped Harry sit up against the pillows before answering him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re at Gringotts. You got nicked with an AK and seeing as how you are fine after that, I thought you would not appreciate the attention you would get from St. Mungo’s, so I brought you to the goblins instead.” That got Harry’s attention as his husband proceeded to grab Draco and check him over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re alright, right? Did you get the guy? What was he after? I’m going to kill the bastard!” Harry was pulling the covers off when Draco grabbed his hands to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love, I’m fine. I’m alright. This might have been another attempt. On yours or mine, I do not know. I called the Aurors before I brought you here so the guy should be in custody by now. Just calm down and rest. The goblin healer may say that you were going to be alright, but I still worry.” This got Harry to settle back into his bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are we going to do? This was the third time. Should we plan to move into one of the warded manors?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shook his head and took the raven’s hands. “Even if we move into a protected home, we are still going to be checking over our shoulders when we are out, and I don’t want to live like that. I was planning to move to America, where they don’t know who we are. What do you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m willing to go anywhere where you are but you do realize that people are still going to know where we are with who I am. How are you going to go around this?” Harry never liked his status, but he can’t give it up to be a dead man one minute and show up in front of his grandmother alive the next. He was certain that at least some of the English nobility would catch a glimpse of him in the castle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what Ironspear and I were talking about before you woke up. I know that you can’t just vanish off the face of the Earth but I don’t want to tell everyone that I died or divorced you. I am a possessive person; I will not tolerate people throwing themselves at you just because you became a bachelor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled his husband into a hug. “Don’t worry, that’s not going to happen. We will be together for the rest of our lives, as we promised. I think I can help with something. Would you mind being forgotten by people?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think that is our goal here. I would not mind being forgotten if it means that people will leave us in peace. I just don’t want our friends to forget though. We’ve been through everything together.” Harry got a smirk on his face and Draco knew he had a plan forming in that beautiful mind of his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know that little title we found out I got at the end of the war three years ago?” Draco pulled away with a look of confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which one? You claimed a lot of titles that year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m talking about the little title called the Master of Death title”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only you would call being Death’s master a little title, but yeah. What about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can use that to control certain memories of people. But it only works on memories related to me. Seeing as how you are my husband; this applies to you too.” Draco was catching on but something still made him concerned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about our friends? We can’t just do this to everyone. There are keystone memories that can drastically affect the lives of others if you just erase them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not erasing memories; I’m influencing them at most. I can make them the Wizarding World forget about you and me by severing the bond of us to them and I can choose who this works on. This way, as long as we don’t come in contact with them, they would have no reason to think of us and rekindle the severed bond. It only works if they don’t see us in person though because if we appear in front of them too much, they can remember the memory again through the bond and it would not work anymore.” Harry explained and Draco was happy that he had a way out now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you even have this power?” Harry was the Master of Death. How does that even relate to memory manipulation?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think of it was the death of bonds between us and them. When the bond is severed, this causes the memories associated with the bond are buried. The memories don’t disappear though because the bond doesn’t disappear, it is just cut. The remnants are still there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This means that we can still have our out without giving everything up.” Draco realizes and before Harry can say anything Draco grabbed him into a passionate kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The awkward cough reminded them of the goblin that was in the room this whole time and caused them to pull apart. “Do you know how much I love you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every time you look at me.” Harry turned to the goblin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does this mean that you need two trips to America?” The couple nodded and the goblin wrote something down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco, what do you plan to do when we get over there? I know that we don’t have to work a day to live comfortably with how much our net worth is but do you want to find something to do?” Draco contemplated is options. He didn’t really know what he wanted to do. He wouldn’t mind working as an Auror in America but was he really willing to deal with the self-important idiots.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I may offer a suggestion, the American Ministry is looking for a liaison between the muggle and the magical departments of justice. They do similar work to Aurors but there are some tests that you have to pass. I can send in an application for you if you are interested.” The goblin gave over a package that appeared on his clipboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco and Harry looked over the package and interest were building in Draco’s eyes. “Can you give me time to think about it. I’ll send a letter with my reply tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well. Lord Potter is free to leave when he is ready. May your gold never cease.” The two reciprocated before goblin left and the couple went home to pack up their home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeing as Draco already showed interest in the job opening, it did not take much thinking or convincing from Harry to get him to say yes. The goblins came gave them a date for when they have everything ready for them to leave. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was two days later that the two came into Gringotts about to turn a new chapter to their lives. The had spent the two days telling everyone that they were leaving and that they were going to make it so that others would not remember them. This got many crying people hanging onto them, but they relented when the two told them their new address and that they could visit whenever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they entered the office, there were two people in the office with Ironspeak and Griphook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lords Potter, Lord Malfoy. May I introduce the Minister of the American Ministry, Ashleigh Wood and the head of the Magical Department of Defense, Aiden Makenzeigh. They are here to perform the Psyc evaluation on Lord Malfoy. If he passes, they will introduce him to his new team about a week after you arrive in America.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a pleasure to meet you, Lord Malfoy, Lord Potter. This should take roughly an hour. If you will follow us, to the side room the goblins set up.” Makenzeigh gestured to the side door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be out here when you are done, Love.” Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s forehead before they disappeared behind the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Potter, we have prepared what you need to commence the memory modifications.” Harry nodded to Griphook and followed them to the room set up down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>_ _ _ _</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco and Harry portkeyed into the American Ministry with Minister Wood, Mr. Makenzeigh. “We welcome you to America. Lord Malfoy, over the next week, we will send you the necessary information for your new position. You officially begin Monday morning.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They exchanged farewells before pulling out their second portkey, the one that was going to take them to their new house in Quantico where it was closer to Draco’s new workplace. Even with magic, it took some time to unpack and by the end of the day, they fell asleep in their new home dreaming of their future.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The following week was spent settling into their home, exploring the neighbourhood, stocking up on food, and locating the nearest magical community.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By Sunday evening, Draco was too nervous to sleep. Harry kept his mind off everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>_ _ _ _</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Monday morning, Draco was nervously adjusting his tie. He was trying to dress professionally for his first day, but he had worn a muggle suit before and his tie just. Won’t. STRAIGHTEN!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was standing in the doorway as he watched the blonde’s frustration set in. “Alright, hand it over.” Harry held out his hand and Draco threw the tie at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took the tie and stood behind Draco in front of the mirror and did it for him. He wrapped his arms around his husband, chin on the shoulder. “Don’t worry so much. They will love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco turned around to hug Harry, “But what if they were like the others in Britain. I don’t want to work like that again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You forget who you are married to. As long as you say the word, I can take care of them and you can work worry-free.” Draco can only sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I thought I was supposed to be the one that threw their weight around. Don’t go vanishing my coworkers, please?” Draco stared into Harry’s bright green eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As long as you tell me not to. Now come on, I have breakfast ready. I’ll drop you off on my way to work.” Harry walked hand in hand with Draco as they made their way to the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I still can’t believe you managed to get yourself a job on the Board of Education and as a consultant at the Ministry and landed yourself a job as an agent in the American government, all the while spending the week with me.” Draco’s eye roll brought a laugh to Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am a teacher and a soldier at heart, you know this my sweet. They basically gave me the job when I discovered and pointed out the corrupting in their workers. I had planned to go through the normal channels when I signed up to work as an agent, but they ran background checks, so they figured out who I was pretty quickly. Thank goodness that my royal status is locked up pretty tightly. Apparently, some of the muggles here kept up with the war coverup stories. When they found out I was one of the main fighters, you can guess people wanted to hire someone experienced to work for them.” Draco only hummed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they sat down for breakfast, Draco asked right when Harry was drinking his coffee, “I wonder what they would think if they found out they had one of the princes of England working for them?” This made Harry choke on his coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love, please don’t joke about that.” The plea only made Draco laugh which was contagious because Harry joined in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>_ _ _ _</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The light atmosphere from breakfast was slowly breaking away the closer they got to Draco’s office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they reached the building, he went through the gate, which confused Draco since he thought Harry was only dropping him off. “Harry, I thought you still had to go to work? Why are you parking the car?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am going to work. This is one of them.” Harry opened his car door and went around to open Draco’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Draco was so confused as Harry herded him into the building and through the security check. They went to get Draco’s and apparently, Harry’s badges before stepping into the elevator, heading up to Draco’s new boss’s office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” Draco stared at the badge that Harry helped him clipped to his waist before doing the same for his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I work in the next building over but since my introduction to my team is not for a little bit, I’m doing my job as a good husband and comforting my nervous husband on his first day at work.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are working for the FBI too?” Draco was baffled, his husband apparently got four new jobs and decided not to tell him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know we took a portkey out our first day here, but I didn’t think you didn’t know. Draco, the Ministry is in the basement of this base.” That just shocked the blond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You work here too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, dear. We can spend our days going to work, having lunch, and going home together. The only time I won’t be here is if I am down in Washington or if I have to go see Grandmother. You are going to see me so much that you are going to be sick of me.” That made Draco laugh and some of the tension left his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I won’t.” The elevator dinged, opening the door to the floor containing the office of the BAU Section Chief, Erin Strauss. The superior to Draco’s new team.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they reached the door, Draco took a deep breath to calm his nerves before knocking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco opened the door and walked in, Harry following him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Chief Strauss.” Draco and Strauss shook hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Agent Malfoy. This is?” She turned to face Harry</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook her hand and introduced himself, “I’m Agent Harry Potter, I am one of the new workers in the lower floors.” Strauss knew of the Ministry that worked under the buildings, so she said nothing about authorization.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you would follow me, Agent Malfoy. The BAU has been notified of a new team member but magic has yet to be revealed to them since the paperwork to do so just arrived on my desk today.” Harry and Draco followed Strauss down the hall to reveal a set of glass doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to come with us, Agent Potter?” Strauss asked before they stepped in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I will leave you here. I have to go introduce myself to my own superiors. I’ll see you later Draco. Call me if anything comes up?” Draco nodded and Harry made his way back to an elevator. Strauss and Draco watched as Harry took his security pass and passed it over the down button, which lit up rainbow before the elevator doors opened to reveal a wall less platform and many free-flying paper airplanes. He stepped in and waved as the doors closed before opening again to reveal the normal elevator again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You ready to meet your new coworkers?” Draco took a deep breath before nodding and followed Strauss through the doors</span>
</p><p>
