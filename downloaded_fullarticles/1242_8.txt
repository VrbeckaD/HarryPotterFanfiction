    <p>The figure looked as if the person hanging from the cross had been tortured and famished. The lines on his face were angular and showed his pained expression - the eyes shut and mouth forming a half smile. Why smiling when you're the one who’s dying? The destroyed tissue of his palms was too soft in her opinion - the impact could have been stronger. His bones should have been crushed and skin torn and angry red from oozing blood. She glanced at his legs and bit her bottom lip. The knees were supposed to be broken - they didn't look that way. The itching in her hands slowly crept up her forearms and absent mindedly she reached there only to stop herself from doing it. The rosary beads in her fingers slowly fell down on the marble floor. The sight of it so peculiar and odd that her brown irises widened. She furrowed her brows while touching the cold floor. </p>
<p>"Hermione, are you alright?" The faulty organ she used to call a heart, jumped in her chest as she turned in the direction of an elderly voice. Sister Minerva observed her haunted form with a pitying look. Gripping the rosary between her fingers, she stretched her spine before she cleared her sore throat. </p>
<p>"Yes, Ma'am. I've been praying," she wasn't necessarily lying, however, admitting to studying the sculpture of Jesus, might have been looked down upon. Taking her bible, she exited the pew she was sitting in. The older woman's features relaxed and a hand called Hermione to come closer. </p>
<p>"That's good, dear. You've been coming to the altar every day. You’re giving beautiful testimony to your sisters," the wrinkles on her forehead creased as she caught Hermione's elbow. Nodding at her monologue, the brunette gathered her skirts and followed her Mother Superior. The extraordinary ceiling of the Scottish church felt as if it was falling upon her with its majestic beauty and heaviness. She didn't like that feeling. It made her feel small and suffocated. The prickling cold air slapped her cheeks as the elder sister opened a huge, wooden door. It was winter and the barren landscape looked as if it was taken from a scene in a horror movie. </p>
<p>"Sister Minerva, I have a question," her courage woke from a slumber and with a slight force she stopped her sister. Minerva’s glossy eyes scanned the troubled girl with a motherly concern.</p>
<p>"Yes, child?" If she was trying to get her to speak faster, she masked it with a perfect image of patience. The wind was wailing above her head and if Hermione's hair hadn't been twisted into a sleek braid, they would have danced on the strong gusts. </p>
<p>"If I felt that I am not ready to practice the holy blessings, would you have me removed from the convent?" She looked at the graves scattered upon the nearby hill with something akin to a desperate need. When she gazed upon Jesus, she only saw a man - not a God. Could these feelings be present? Could they exist? She felt as if her mind had been feeding her lies. The words from the bible and psalms seemed to be bleak and vain. Could she be under the influence of a bad spirit? </p>
<p>"Of course not, dear. It's your decision. God is keeping you in his arms all the time," Minerva’s hand tapped her shoulders two times before vanishing inside the pockets of a black coat. "Let yourself be one with the Holy Spirit. It's your choice. I will always honour it." If there was malicious intent behind the old nun's words, Hermione didn't notice it. The snow under her leather boots squeaked - the sound of that phenomenon left her twitching. Snowflakes touched her perky nose as the silver haired woman made her way towards the nunnery. There was a pang inside Hermione’s  chest - her gaze softly focusing on tombs and bare trees surrounding the graveyard. The scenery was too striking and blinking she tried to escape the dryness of her eyes. The sky was grey and cloudy; it only added a more poignant atmosphere to the huge dome behind her. </p>
<p>"Are you coming, Hermione?" She snapped her attention to the figure in front of her and with a deathly grip on the bible she bit her inner cheeks. The desperate need of running away had built in her lower abdomen. However, it wasn't like her. She sighed between the rapid thoughts inside her skull. Hermione didn't know who she was at all. She could measure the emotions she felt but not the faith of her heart. </p>
<p>"I am going to the cemetery for a while, sister Minerva. I need solitude," she called between falling snow and gusts of wind, separating her from the elderly female. She spotted a curt nod and jumping in the opposite direction, her legs started to move faster and faster. Cold air burned her windpipe and later lungs - for the very first time in a long time she felt alive.  Her chestnut tresses fell from the strict braid with every bounce in her run. Each step made her aware of how much she had missed... this freedom. Her knees almost gave in as she stumbled upon a root of an enormous willow tree. Scratching her hand on the bark sparked an electric reaction running down her spine. </p>
<p>Exhale. Inhale. </p>
<p>Gripping her ribcage from both sides Hermione's eyes took the melancholic landscape in. Broken tombstones reminded her of the marble floor in the church. But there was not any grace attached to it. Only the  misery of death. Slumping forward the girl's trembling hand finally touched the icy engravings. Was Jesus supposed to die and leave all his people to despair in agony? Where was his love? What is love? Her fingertips dug into the puffy layer of white snow. Is love something material? How could God do so little while staying so indifferent? What was she supposed to believe? Heaven and hell seemed to have a thin line between them; her amber eyes closed when her digit traced an "a" shape. She couldn't be a saint. Nobody was without fault. Her head was empty. She didn't hear godly voices inside it. </p>
<p>"Help me," her whisper came with rapid heartbeats. If she didn’t have God, who remained with her? The name Jane Granger only deepened a gaping hole in her beating heart as she aimlessly dusted the grave. Here, between snow and death God seemed to be nonexistent. "Where is my faith?" She asked no one. The answer hidden behind the sounds of a raging snow storm. There was an intimate connection in her vulnerability and the oddness of dying. It wasn't something she was afraid of. Not the dying part, more like the living one. She felt someone's eyes upon her hunched form and with a quick move she turned around only to see an empty road. She frowned, her limbs paralysed with an irrational fear. The shaking of her hand had returned but before she glanced at it, a huge, dark shape came into the view of her peripheral vision. She almost laughed out loud when her irises spotted the thing. It was a cross. Moved by a constant storm, the figure of Jesus looked like a beggar. His features adorned with pain and bliss -not so different than the one at  the altar.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you enjoy watching the misery of others, Lord," she quickly put a hand over her treacherous mouth and closed her eyes. She was speaking nonsense and if her sisters heard her she would have been brought in for an exorcism. Kneeling on the wet ground she prayed. Prayed for a quick end if there was any. </p>
<p>                                            --------</p>
<p>The room was warm and crowded; the sisters came from every direction as Hermione studied another scripture from the new testament. Her inquisitive  eyes analysed every word and in fact, every impossibility. After returning from an unpleasant stroll she quickly drank hot tea and watched the stained glass windows of the church. She had her favourite one where angels laid upon the ground in ecstasy mixed with anguish on their faces. Her fingers scratched her right forearm and without a thought she put more pressure there. The book fell from her knees and hit the stone ground. An echo erupted in her eardrums and as she recalled the sound a pale hand appeared in her personal space. </p>
<p>“Before Sister Dolores sees this,” eyes as blue as a cool mountain stream smiled at her when the owner of them put the fallen object in her arms. Hermione's lips curled and shaking her head as a thank you, she quickly closed her fingers on the edge of the book. </p>
<p>“Are you going to the vigil?” her voice was hoarse as the walk in snow did not help her previous illness. The heart  shaped face of Luna, brightened at the mention of a future meeting. </p>
<p>“Yes, I am supposed to sign there. Are you perhaps unwell, Hermione? You look rather pale,”she touched her forehead with concern. Swatting her hand away softly, Hermione smiled and stood up. </p>
<p>“I am perfectly fine, Luna, just tired. It’s from a lack of proper sleep and endless prayers,” admitting to the truth was not an easy task, but in front of her one true friend she could do that much. At least Luna of all people, deserved her truthfulness. They had been in the nunnery since they were fifteen and without any living family members, they only had each other. Fate pushed the narrative of faith upon Hermione's shoulders even though her parents were religious people themselves. Maybe, just maybe, it was a punishment for her. If so, God was nothing but an imperfect human being. The door opened and a short, plump nun observed both of them with a toxicity beaming from her in waves. </p>
<p>“Both of you are needed at the altar. Mind your smalltalk and do something useful like prayers and psalms,” sister Dolores spat before suggesting they move from their spot. Gathering her skirts and rosary Hermione walked past the older female and obediently moved towards the church. She could hear Luna’s footsteps and loud exhales of air coming from one of their sisters. The staircase was dark and empty and as she passed it by, she could swear that someone was watching them - lurking in the shadows like an entity born out of them. She shrugged and tried to think about something more optimistic or theological. In fact the vigil was held in memory of a priest that served the village for many years. She remembered him well, long beard, eyeglasses and heartfelt laughter. When she was a child she always described him as a wizard. Silly thing, she mused, how such frivolous thoughts could find an alternative way of expressing itself in front of her parents. Creativity wasn't her forte. Playing on piano was one, however her biggest love was books. Her dad owned a small library where he would read her psychological essays that she still could remember. The smell of the interior also lingered in her memories, strong and present as if it had happened only yesterday. Stepping into the dome Hermione found her place in the right alcove between Ginevra and Lavender. The two of them shared funny looks and stared at their bibles. The candles were lit and her nose could detect the scent of incense - it invaded her senses lulling her into abstract feeling of belonging. The cross still remained the same, same features, same glory. Nothing different from the morning sight. Where was a true Jesus in all of this? In the way of tortured limbs? Between broken bones? She couldn't see him anywhere - not in himself nor in herself. There was that nothingness, a hazy emotion that crept upon her while she studied the sculpture. Maybe that was the point. Nothingness burned and left you breathless - was that everlasting love? </p>
<p>“My dear sisters, I am delighted to see how many of you decided to honour a fellow servant of God,” there was a silent agreement coming from the crowd as the old nun smiled at them. “Take a moment of silence in memory of the late Albus,” she bowed her head in respect and nodded at no one particular. “Before you start your excellent work, let me introduce you to the new priest that had been Albus’ apprentice back in town,” she motioned someone to move and from the red curtains and behind the altar came a man. A man that looked like a God. High cheekbones and full lips, dark hair swept into a neat hairstyle suggesting an image of perfection - but those eyes. Hermione dug her fingernails into the soft tissue of her inner palm. Those eyes could only assure her of the devil’s existence.</p>
