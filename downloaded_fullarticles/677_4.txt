    <p>A HUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE</p><p>   Harry stared at his watch and waited in anticipation for the numbers to change. It was his eleventh birthday, and once again, he was the only one around who cared. When the clock struck midnight he blew out the candles of the cake he drew in the dirt of the hut the Dursleys and him were staying in.<br/>
FWBAM<br/>
The door fell to the ground with a thudering boom that resounded through the entire hut. Every inche shook with the sheer power of the door falling, the foundation cracking and splinters flying. Every occupant was awake now, fear flying through their blood faster than pure sugar. Harry, the only one with any common sense, hid. Mr. Dursley, the stupidest of the bunch, and believe me, that’s an accomplishment in itself, prodded the gigantic intruder with a puny shoutgun. The barrell was barely the size of the giants thumb, and bent easily under the pure strength of the man.<br/>
“You must be Harry! You’ve gotten so big since I last seen ya.” Harry stifled a laugh as he watched the giant interact with his cousin.<br/>
“He is not that stupid boy. This is Dudley.” Mr. Dursley cried with idignation, “He’s over there in the corner, hiding like a coward.”<br/>
Well, a random man just barged in by breaking down the door and bending the barrell of a shotgun. I’d hardly call my actions cowardly. More like survival instincts. Harry thought as he emerged from the dark corner he had hidden in.<br/>
“Harry!!” The man ran toward him and b=picked him up in what could only be described as a bear hug.<br/>
“Put me down!” Harry cried, terrified out of his mind.<br/>
“Good point.” The man said, “I’m Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts. We’d best be off if you want a get any good shoppin done for the crowds get there.”<br/>
“He is not going anywhere with your sort.” Mr. Dursley cried out, shocking the two who had forgotten his prescence.<br/>
The two adult males argued for a bit, which Harry just tuned out. He probably should have been paying attention, but it was just a habit. More like a survival instinct. When adults started yelling, he shut down. It was the best way to avoid getting hurt.<br/>
“Harry. Harry. HARRY.” Hagrid finally got his attention, “Are you coming with me?”<br/>
Harry looked to his uncle who nodded, finally happy to get rid of him. Harry followed Hagrid into a boat. He pulled out a pink umbrella and suddenly the boat lurched forward with no rowing. “How did you do that?” Harry asked, astounded.<br/>
“With magic o course.” Hagrid laughed.<br/>
“Magic’s real?” Harry was dumbfounded.<br/>
“Where you not listening to me earlier?” At his lack of response Hagrid continued. “Yer a wizard, Harry. I am too. Hogearts is a school for magic, and we’re gonna go ta Diagon Alley to get ya some things for school.”<br/>
“What about my Aunt and Uncle, are they magic too?” Harry asked with wide eyes.<br/>
“Nah, they’re muggles. Your parents were magic though. And before you ask, no, Dudley ain’t magic either. Although at this point I doubt he’s anything but sugar and hate.” Harry laughed at this, then promptly fell asleep.<br/>
When Harry awoke they had reached the shore and the sun was shining high above them. They exited the boat and made their way to a small buisness area. Hagrid walked right into a seemingly falling apart pub named the Leaky Cauldron. Harry just followed behind him, quiet and obedient, just as he was taught. They passed through nearly uneventfully, apparently he was some sort of celebrity, but he would process that later. (MOOD).<br/>
Hagrid tapped some bricks with his umbrella and suddenly everything was bright and loud. Every street corner was filled with shouting vendors and there was absolutely no place that wasn’t stuffed with people. Harry shut down, following Hagrid and taking in absolutely nothing. They walked and walked until they came to a lopsided building called GRingotts. Inside was no better. Everything was too tall and too grand. Strange creatures sat at ever surface, each one doing some sort of job. Harry ran to catch up with Hagrid and found him at the very back of the long hallway.<br/>
After they left the bank, they headed over to Madam Malkins, where he noticed a peculiar mark on his left side. He asked Hagrid and Hagrid explained about soulmarks and soulmates and what the mark itself meant. When he finished a breathtaking blonde boy walked into the store and immediatly found his way over to Harry.<br/>
“I’m Draco Malfoy. This is my first year at Hogwarts. What house do you think you’ll get sorted into?” The blonde asked.<br/>
“I don’t know, what about you?” Harry asked.<br/>
“Slytherin for sure. My entire family on both sides has been in Slytherin. That’s not even a question. Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts then.” Draco said as Harry was shepparded out by the clerk.<br/>
The rest of the shopping trip passed fairly uneventfully. Harry learned a lot, and left a lot to process later. If he didn’t, he would for sure go insane. </p><p>EARLIER AT THE MANOR</p><p>   “Draco, we’re going to Diagon Alley to get your things for school. Be ready in five.” Lucius Malfoy called out.<br/>
Draco slicked back his hair and readied himself to floo there. He smiled the entire way, the joy of shopping for school creeping in. Just this once, even Lucius couldn’t be bothered to tell him to stop smiling like an idiot. It was a very important day after all. Draco ran off to get his books, and the Malfoys could barely keep up, zigging and zagging through the crowds. Not running of course, but speed waliking with grace. Of course.<br/>
After Draco had everything but new robes, Lucius excused himself to buy a treat for his peacocks. His prized possessions. No, not possessions. Family. Honestly, that explains a lot about him to be honest.<br/>
Back at Madam Malkin’s Draco made a new friend, only realizing he never got his name after it was too late. He tried to tell his parents about him, but they brushed it off and told him to go do something by himself. So Draco studied, determined to be the best, that way maybe his parents would pay more attention to their only child instead of only themselves. But he knew it was only a fantasy. Perks of being raised by Narcissists.</p>
