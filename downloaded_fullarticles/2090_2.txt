          <div class="userstuff"><p>“There was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o. B-I-N-G-O!” Hermione danced around the kitchen at Grimmauld place, three-year-old Teddy giggling madly at her antics. </p><p>“Bango was his namo.” </p><p>“B - I - N - G - O!” Harry chimed in, picking up Teddy and swinging him around in a circle. ““B - I - N - G - O! B - I - N - G - O! And bingo was his name-o.” </p><p>Clapping his hands, Teddy screeched. “Again! Again!” </p><p>Grinning, Harry caught Hermione’s eye before launching into the song again. “There was a farmer who had a dog, and -ingo was his name-o. --- I - N - G - O! --- I - N - G - O, --- I - N - G - O!”</p><p>“And angoo was his namo!” Teddy clapped his hands. </p><p>Hermione leant against the counter, watching her boyfriend and his godson. Teddy had changed his hair again, this time to a curly brown and his eyes the same piercing green as Harry’s. Smiling at the pair, she went back to fixing up the trio’s dinner. With a wave of her wand, she set the small dining table in the corner and brought the pork chops and potatoes over. </p><p>“Time to eat Mr Bingo!” She booped Teddy’s nose before Harry put him in his high-chair. “Potatoe time!” </p><p>“Tatoes! Tatoes! Mmmmm.” Teddy smacked his tiny fists on the table. “Hungy now!” </p><p> When they finished eating, the rest of the evening was spent washing the crusted potatoes out of Teddy’s hair and Harry trying to convince the toddler that they should sing a new song.</p></div>
