    <p>
  <span>It had been rather tense since the realisation that the Horcrux made them feel awful. At first they took to wearing it in shifts, for it was too precious to leave lying around in the tent, but Ron was still recovering from his splinch, and it was awful to have two out of three of them always feeling sensitive and raw. In desperation, Harry shoved it in the Moleskin pouch around his neck, and found it took a lot longer to affect them that way, and, of course, no one was getting into it except him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thing was, Harry had rather expected for things to pick up a lot once they got the locket. He thought that the first success would lead naturally onto the next one. It was beyond bizarre to be the one chasing after something rather than someone that things just happened to. He kept waiting for a dragon or something to pop up and force them into action.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few weeks into camping, they Apparated to a beach that Hermione had been to as a child. It was the first truly warm day they’d had, unseasonably warm in fact, and also the first time they had Apparated without Ron immediately throwing up. Harry sighed with relief and Hermione threw her arms around Ron’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I didn’t want to say anything, but I was so worried, the wound was basically healed and I had this awful feeling that you had just associated Apparition with being sick and that you’d be stuck with it and—’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry went to exchange an exasperated look with Ron, but Ron had an odd look on his face and Hermione still hadn’t let him go, so he started setting up the tent and their protective charms instead. When he was finished, they had stopped hugging but were talking together quietly, and he felt like he was intruding. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione saw him lingering and waved him over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I was thinking about the last time I was here. There was this diver from Australia, he found these creatures strapped to the cliffs and we ate them for dinner together with the whole campsite. He caught so many, got carried away, he said, so it can’t be too hard. And we could use a bubble head charm. And I know this other charm that helps with the pressure underwater, too.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I can stay at the tent,’ Ron said. ‘Someone should keep the locket and I don’t fancy being underwater with it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Oh, I hadn’t thought about that,’ said Hermione. ‘Do you know if the ring Dumbledore found was cursed or if that was just the Horcrux, Harry?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head, hating how little he knew. That would have been a useful thing for Dumbledore to tell him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll stay, though. I got to go to that market last time.’ And he felt like Ron and Hermione needed some space to figure themselves out, but he didn’t fancy saying that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They left after making sure Harry was sure and promising not to take too long. Harry found himself alone for the first time since they left Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tent felt oddly empty and despite the pouch around his neck, Harry felt more free than he had in weeks. The thing about this mission, was that he had been the only one in Dumbledore’s office last year, so he felt as though the others kept looking at him, expecting him to drop some piece of knowledge that would make everything make sense. Or worse, like Harry was keeping that knowledge on purpose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a relief not to have to think about what his facial expressions were doing. Harry flopped on the couch and considered his options. He could go back to trying to read the painfully complicated book about Horcruxes that Hermione had told him was the most accessible of the ones she had brought. He could look over their notes, or try to make new ones. He had been trying to just let his thoughts wander and write whatever came into his head in an attempt to put new information down. But he knew he wasn’t going to use his unexpected alone time to do something that he could and should be doing while his friends were there. He was going to have a long, relaxing wank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Living in a dormitory with four other boys meant that he had gotten used to getting one off quickly in the shower to relieve tension, and not expecting more. Even though he had resorted to silencing charms on his curtains as much as the next bloke, he always sensed when someone else was using one, so felt uncomfortable doing it. After all, he generally didn’t silence his bed, so doing so was a pretty easy indicator of </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> he was doing it, and that wasn’t a thought he wanted. So that was an emergency situation kind of wank, where he’d woken up hard and it wasn’t going away, or he just could not sleep no matter what, or a couple of times, when he’d already had a shower, but one wank hadn’t been enough to get rid of that specific kind of arousal that made him feel tense and unable to function. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There hadn’t been too many times in his life that he had felt free to take his time, and there were times that he felt like that was normal, like it was all something he should be ashamed of. Those times were generally when he should have been focussing on something more important, but recently he had decided not to get so wound up about it. He didn’t beat himself up about eating or showering or even playing chess when he could have been sitting around worrying about the latest threat on the wizarding world, so he wasn’t going to feel guilty about this anymore, either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Saying that, he wasn’t so bold as to just get down to it on the couch. He set a proximity alarm on the flap of the tent and went to his bed. He took all his clothes off, because he could, and got under the doona. He stroked down his chest, trying to tease himself in the way that Ginny had done with disturbing expertise, but despite the time he had and truly wanting to relax into it, he felt a bit ridiculous and also like he just wanted to touch himself properly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was already hard from just thinking about this, and allowed himself a small sigh as he started to stroke himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He remembered the last time he and Ginny had been together, the way she had skived off her Potions class and caught him in a free period and they had snuck into one of Harry’s secret passageways. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We were making euphoric potions,’ she had said as they had hurried to the statue that hid the entrance. Harry had the Invisibility Cloak, he always did then, was always ready to whip it on to stalk Malfoy, but there was something more thrilling about not using it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I told Slughorn I’d inhaled too deeply, got all giddy. I was hoping I’d be able to catch you.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry loved the way she didn’t hesitate to break the rules. He loved the way she had probably put on a performance to get out of class. He really loved that she had been thinking about him and just had to see him. Once in the passageway, Harry had grabbed her by the waist and pressed her against the wall. Her legs had naturally hooked around his hips and she had wriggled deliciously against him as they kissed frantically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of them said why they were so desperate. It was as if they knew it would be their last time. It wouldn’t surprise him if she’d known, even though he honestly hadn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny was a wild lover. She bit his lips and pulled his hair. She tore his clothes and scratched his back. Once she had drawn blood, but she hadn’t been the slightest remorseful and Harry honestly didn’t care in the heat of things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On that day, Harry had gripped her bum and slid his hands to touch her and found she wasn’t wearing panties, which drove him wild.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Don’t you dare put me down, Harry Potter,’ she whispered in his ear. ‘You’re plenty strong enough to fuck me standing up.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That memory was enough to push Harry over the edge, and he was abruptly brought back to the tent. He checked his watch and cleaned himself up. He had no idea what time Ron and Hermione would be back, so he decided to read that bloody book so that when they asked what he had done he would be able to say something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end, he took out the Marauder’s Map and stared at Ginny’s dot for a long time instead. He thought maybe the pain that he was feeling might not be worth the good feelings from before. Part of him hoped that she could sense that he was thinking about her. Another part hoped that she wasn’t torturing herself as much as he was.</span>
