  <strong>Prompt: 'Blue'</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p>There was a small fleck of blue in Draco Malfoy's right eye.</p><p>A small fleck of blue in a sea of silver.</p><p>A small fleck of flaw in his perfect composure.</p><p>"Are you finally going to hit me, Potter?"</p><p>Suddenly remembering himself, Harry snapped back to. He shook his head, taking a step back. Pulling out of Malfoy's gaze with a shuttered breath. "Uh…no. <em>No</em>." He took five more steps away, shaking out his fists. Shaking off the taunting.</p><p>Shaking off the little bit of blue inside the eyes of Draco Fucking Malfoy. Shaking off the way that made him feel.</p>
