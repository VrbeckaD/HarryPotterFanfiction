    <p>Prologue__   </p>
<p>There was a distinct chill in the air that bespoke of fall’s end as Lilith crossed the great hall of her family’s ancestral home. She could see that the ornate French doors were flung wide allowing the icy wind to come inside along with the colorful autumn leaves that had fallen from the trees.</p>
<p>In the opening was her grandmother, Hermione.  </p>
<p>“Nana, it’s far too cold for you to be sitting here, come inside,” Lilith said as she grasped the handles of the wheelchair and pulled her grandmother back inside. </p>
<p>With a flick of her wand the doors closed, and a fire crackled to life in the hearth as she situated the chair close to the warming flames. </p>
<p> “Why were you sitting there with the door open, you’ll catch your death!”  she chastised gently as she tucked a woolen blanket around her grandmother’s legs. </p>
<p>“Death has had plenty of chances to catch me and he hasn’t managed yet,” the older woman laughed. “What have you been up to today, Lilith?”</p>
<p>“I was digging through a box of old photographs,” Lilith said as she reached into the back pocket of her jeans and withdrew a small stack of weathered photos. “I found these.  Are they Uncle Draco?” she asked.</p>
<p>Lilith watched as delicate fingers, the joints slightly swollen with age and arthritis, lightly stroked the stoic face of the man in the photographs. </p>
<p>“Oh no, dear,” the woman said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.  “This is not Draco, this is your grandfather, Lucius, back when I first met him.”</p>
<p>“He was handsome,” Lilith said as she knelt beside her grandmother to look more closely at the man in the photo. </p>
<p>“And arrogant,” her grandmother chuckled softly. “I had forgotten how he looked back then, before…”  She went silent, a sad expression crossing her face.</p>
<p>“How did you meet?” Lilith asked.  “I never heard the story, Mama always said that you and granddad had a story too complicated to tell and not appropriate for young ears.”</p>
<p>“Complicated is one word for it,” the older woman laughed softly. “We should have never been...your grandfather and me.  What we had defied all odds. It defied all reason.  To this day I am still unsure of how we came to love one another so intensely...but love we did. As for young ears…well, it may be hard to believe but passionate affairs aren’t new.”  </p>
<p>“Nana...will you tell me the story?”  Lilith asked quietly as she made herself comfortable at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
<p>“I was twelve years old the first time I met your grandfather….I hated him on sight.  For seven years we fought, bickered...he even tried to kill me a time or two during the war,” Hermione began, shaking her head with a sad smile.  “I was thirty-four when we ‘met’ again, so much had changed…”</p>
