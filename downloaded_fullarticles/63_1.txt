    <p>Dark green eyes peered over red rectangular glasses, concentrating deeply on the notebook on the desk. A gloved petite hand shakily held a number 2 pencil, while their owner took notes for the history lecture, they were in—or pretending to. Dark clouds hovered in the graying skies outside the window near Mikaela Black’s desk. Mikaela glanced quickly outside the damp window, watching penny sized droplets streak down to merge with each other. Fog blanketed the landscape of Riverton High. If Mikaela didn’t know better, she would think that they were getting snow—Florida never got snow. </p><p>Mikaela’s consciousness picked up the soft drones of their British teacher, the ticking of the clock hanging on the wall, the subtle scratching of pencils against paper and the pounding of her heart. Mikaela dried cough into the tissue she held, a metallic taste reached her taste buds, she held back a groan. The teacher glanced towards her direction without her noticing. Mikaela’s normal fair skin paled more over the last couple days, turning a light grey color. </p><p>The fifteen-year-old returned to drawing the man haunting her dreams. Mikaela set aside the tissue and grabbed the neon green highlighter beside her notebook. With light strokes she colored in the man’s gentle eyes, not paying attention to anything else. Mikaela frowned, the highlighter shone brighter than his actual eye color, but it would have to do for now. Mikaela’s teacher would be suspicious if she got out her colored pencils from her bag, her hands would not allow her to be stealthy enough to pull it off.</p><p>Normally, Mikaela enjoyed Mr. Lupin’s tangent filled lectures, but lately she found herself unable to focus. Mikaela grasped the pink butterfly shaped locket hanging around her neck with her other hand, feeling soothing warmth spread through her chest easing her enough to bring her back to reality. Someone placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. Mikaela glanced up; hazel eyes studied her with concern.</p><p>“Are you alright, Ms. Black?” Lupin asked,“You look pinkish.”</p><p>Mikaela noticed students leaving the classroom at a slow pace, she blinked, glancing at the clock which read, 11:50 AM. The class ended without her noticing it. Mikaela forced a smile while closing her notebook, her cheeks flushing seeing her teacher gaze at her drawing.</p><p>“I’m fine, Professor Lupin,” Mikaela uttered before widening her eyes, “Sorry. I mean, I’m fine, Mr. Lupin.”</p><p><em>Get a hold of yourself. you just have to get through the next thirty minutes, and you will be fine.</em> Mikaela thought to herself with a sigh, rubbing her warm forehead with her hand, feeling her head pound. Mikaela smiled weakly; she didn’t want to worry him. Lupin frowned and tilted his head, studying his student. Remus heard her coughing several times in between noticing her staring out the window, during the lecture.</p><p>“Did I ever tell you that you sound like a former student of mine? He always said, ‘I’m fine’, every time I asked a similar question. So, I find it hard to believe you are fine, as you say.” Lupin said in a serious but calm tone, while bringing a chair beside her.</p><p>“You can tell me anything. I got plenty of time for one of my best students.” Lupin added. “Not to mention you just returned from hospital. I would be pleasantly surprised if your health returned to normal.”</p><p>Mikaela smiled weakly, “Don’t you have that conference thing overseas? I wouldn’t want to make you miss your flight.” Mikaela said.</p><p>Every few weeks, Lupin returns to his home country of London for a conference for teachers and health professionals. The conference was made up of the principal of his old boarding school, former school friends, and some of his old students from when he taught there for a year.</p><p>“I’m sure they won’t mind. It’s just a meeting with some of my old friends. I would rather make sure that my students are alright,” Lupin replied with a small smile. “Besides, Professor Prince will be there, so if you’re still sick I can tell him.”</p><p>Mikaela shook her head fighting back tears putting the notebook and highlighters back in her book bag before grabbing six items with shaky hands. Mikaela faked a smile again. Three letters, a small paperback book, a small pile of composition books wrapped in a rubber band and a medium-sized vanilla envelope lay on her desk. Lupin puzzledly glanced at her. </p><p>“I thought you might like to read this while on your plane. It’s one of my favorites next to the Harry Potter series of course.” Mikaela spoke, giving her teacher a fresh copy of, <u>The Call of the Wild</u> by Jack London.</p><p>A silver wolf displayed on the front along with the title. Mikaela swallowed before placing nudging the composition books towards him and placing the envelope nearby.</p><p>“I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but I wasn’t sure what to do. Mom won’t tell me what’s wrong with me and I feel similar to that day. These are my medical files…”</p><p>“Mikaela…I can’t, as your teacher read your files. America is pretty strict about that. I could….”</p><p>“I know! I hoped you could give it to Professor Prince. He’s a scientist so there would be a loophole. I looked it up. I wanted to be able to help. This is a rare disease. If someone is suffering from it then he could come up with a cure to help them and they won’t be sick like I am.”</p><p>“That is noble of you but---”</p><p>“My mother. I’m aware!” </p><p>Mikaela’s eyes misted over. “It’s too late for me. Mom won’t care that they’re missing. I swear sometimes she pretends to care. You were the only one that actually cared. You and Mr. Potter.” Mikaela sniffed, giving three letters to Lupin. saying, “One is for you, one is for Mr. Potter, and the last is…well, he isn’t real but…” Mikaela trailed off. “The notebooks are for Professor Prince. I tried to record everything I felt. Hopefully, he can read my handwriting.” </p><p>Mikaela shook her head and started turning on her electric wheelchair. <em>I need to get out of here.</em> Concern grew on Lupin’s face, eyes scanning one note. Mikaela bolted to the classroom doorway before saying in a small, tired, “Please, if he’s out there, tell him I love him. Thanks for everything, Moony.”</p><p>Mikaela slipped into the crowd of students, she heard two of her friends call after her as she went the opposite way of them. <em>How could I forget to write them one?</em> Mikaela asked herself with a sigh. <em>Probably for the best. They wouldn’t let me do what I need to do.</em> Mikaela noticed some students wearing Santa hats on their heads. Off-keyed renditions of Christmas songs screeched in her ears, increasing the potency of her migraine. Mikaela and her mom had already decorated the Yule tree out in the living room at their small home which distracted her momentary from the sadness she felt. They were not particularly religious, but they still celebrated Yule as part of the Wiccan tradition. That tree will be filled with presents underneath, but what she really wanted will never be there and her mom could never give her. </p><p>Mikaela pauses her movements, glancing up at the announcement cork board. Students posted various posters about their missing pets around the area of Hibiscus Grove. There were a few advertisements for Christmas recitals, future classes for next semester---Mikaela didn’t plan to come back to school, so she glanced over most of them until she spotted an advertisement for one class, </p><p align="center">
  <em>Back by popular demand. The bi-monthly self-defense seminar will continue to be taught by guest speaker, Harry Potter. If interested, please sign up ASAP as spots are filling up fast.</em>
</p><p>Mikaela gripped the locket tighter. <em>It’s not him. You know this!</em></p><p>Around the third month of her first year at Riverton High, a guest speaker came into their gymnasium during her P.E class. Mikaela remembered reading one of the Harry Potter books while periodically glancing up at her friends playing dodgeball. A rogue ball nearly collided with her but somehow it stopped and flew past her. A young man ran to her, for a moment she thought the person appeared from her book until their eyes met. Mikaela remembered her cheeks growing pink as he talked in an oddly familiar calm voice, and her eyes misted. Mikaela blamed the fear of the ball hitting her for causing the small sobs that erupted. The man wasn’t her Harry. Mr. Potter didn’t have glasses, a scar on his forehead, or even the dreamy emerald eyes---he had amber eyes. Harry Potter, the wizard, did not exist and he never would.</p><p>Mr. Potter and her eventually became friends, becoming a mentor to her. Mr. Potter and Lupin were easy to talk to. Mikaela could talk with them about almost everything. Everything except for her feelings for the Harry Potter character. </p><p>Mikaela’s eyes drifted to a missing persons poster. <em>Mr. Potter’s wife.</em> Mikaela frowned, tilting her head in confusion, shaking her head. Mikaela read it:</p><p align="center">
  <em>Mikaela Lynn Malfoy</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>DOB- March 29, 1980</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Eye color: Dark green</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hair color: Golden Blond</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Last seen getting off the train platform at King’s Cross Station…</em>
</p><p>There were more but she heard her friends shout for her. Mikaela went to move her hand to the joystick but paused, blinking as the words on the page moved on their own, shifting around and connecting. The cold metal of the locket grew warm. The fluorescent lights above her flickered with a low hum, she jumped hearing the horn on her wheelchair go off on its own, the sound lingering until she turned it off. People stared at her, but her attention turned elsewhere. The text changed to, </p><p align="center">
  <em>Mikaela Lynn Potter</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Kaela, stay where you are. I’m on my way. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>-Harry</em>
</p><p>Mikaela blinked again, the text returning to normal. Tears streamed down her face; she shook her head. <em>That was just a hallucination.</em></p><p>Mikaela slipped off without much notice except for Lupin trailing behind her. Remus cursed whoever muggle decided to make chairs move nearly as fast as a Nimbus 2000. The letter Mikaela Black wrote troubled the man who came to think of her as a daughter over the two years they knew each other. Remus spotted Mikaela’s two friends, Anna Richard and Gabriella Cortez, about to run after her.</p><p>“Mr. Lupin?” Anna asked. “Is Mikaela alright? We called out to her but just ignored us.”</p><p>“No, she’s not, Ms. Richard. I need you to go straight next door and tell the teacher to call the counselor. She might be in danger of herself.”</p><p>Anna’s eyes widened and she gave a slow nod before running off.</p><p>“I’ll call her mom. I have her phone on speed dial.” Gabriella said, while pulling out her flip phone.</p><p>“Don’t! Her mother would make things worse.” Remus replied.</p><p>“Mikaela!” Gabriella shouted, running after her friend.</p><p> Remus ran after Mikaela but made sure to keep a few paces from her, studying her movements, his hand keeping close to his invisible wand holster. </p><p align="center">*****************************************</p><p>Mikaela entered the bathroom, locking it behind her, and hurrying to the sink. Mikaela gazed into the mirror, taking off her glasses, deciding that she didn’t need them anymore. Sobs erupted from her, letting the tears fall undeterred down her powdered face staining the makeup she caked. Reddened eyes stared back at her. Mikaela reached up to nudge her pink headband to the edge of her head to make it fall off.  If it wasn’t for her mom, her long brunette hair would have been a frizzy moppy mess, and she could care less. </p><p>The hallucinations of Harry were getting worse, she saw him nearly every day while at school. There was always a fluttering in her chest when she saw him, those emerald eyes luring her. After a few months they started meeting under a secluded tree during lunch time after people started teasing her about talking to herself. Mikaela sent rebuttals to the classmates by describing him in detail, trying to hold his hand. Mikaela felt this strange electric vibration when near him, her heart would soar, and she felt comforted. When he wasn’t near, a wave of sadness and loneliness would consume her. When the waves hit, Harry appeared beside her, wrapping his arms around her like a ghostly blanket. Mikaela could never feel the warmth of his arms which would make tears fall from her eyes onto whatever homework she was working on at the time.</p><p> After a year she tried blocking the visions of Harry, telling herself that he wasn’t real, he was a book character, and nothing more of a fragment of her imagination. Mikaela tried for months, relying on meditation books to block it out, while wailing for Harry in the privacy of her bathroom. The attempt only resulted in debilitating headaches, violent nausea spells that often caused her sink to be filled with blood, and cold sweats that lasted days. Mikaela begged her mom once to take her to a hospital after she got the bright idea to look up possible reasons on why—a magnitude of different cancers, autoimmune diseases, a flare up in her TBI, and the least likely being demonic possession. Rissa refused and gave her more medicine. Mikaela even thought of talking to Lupin to see if they had the same mysterious disease.</p><p>Mikaela told her friends how sick she felt, including her attempts to block the hallucinations, while at home sick from a hard episode.  They then decided to tell Lupin on her behalf. Mikaela remembered how gruff Lupin’s voice got when she told him over the phone that her mom wouldn’t take her to the hospital. Mikaela heard her mom yelling at him while going in and out of consciousness. </p><p>There were sporadic blurry memories of being in a room with machines that beeps constantly, the place reeked of rubbing alcohol. Mikaela remembered people moving around her, seeing them through a heavy fog. Mikaela remembered Lupin sitting beside her alongside a woman with pink highlights in her hair. Mikaela also remembered the hallucinations growing worse, she saw Harry beside her bed, holding her hand and smiling down at her. When she gazed up at him, amber eyes turned vibrant green, a small scar appeared beneath the man’s bangs. The man talked with Lupin and the woman next to him as though they were in the same room. Mikaela didn’t remember anything more.</p><p>Lupin consulted with a skilled chemist friend of his back in London, named Professor Prince, after the hospital released her and she didn’t get better. Rissa didn’t tell her what the doctors said, and Lupin had no authority to be privy to information regarding her health. The consultation with his friend didn’t turn up anything since he couldn’t examine her. </p><p>Mikaela used to be confused by his change of demeanor, not understanding the issue. It felt nice to have people looking out for her, but nobody could make her better. Not without a clear diagnosis from someone other than her mother. The only thing that calmed the symptoms was the strange liquid in the small bottles contained in the pink Hello Kitty box she brought from home. Someone put the bottles in her locker one day with a small note that said, </p><p align="center">
  <em>This has helped me over the years. Hopefully, it will help your anxiety. Best to take it before bed. Take one vital.</em>
</p><p>There was no signature, but she was desperate for relief. Whatever it was worked, making her able to sleep better at night. Mikaela used to wake up in the dead of night crying Harry’s name until she fell back asleep again. No one there to comfort her since her mom worked nightly. By the time 5:30 AM hit, she would be exhausted, the only thing motivating her to get up before was Lupin’s hot cocoa with European new age herbal medicine. Lupin had to be the sweetest teacher she had, which is what made it harder for her to do this. Mikaela wanted the pain to go away and the strange sickness that consumed her.</p><p>Mikaela opened the box, carefully uncorking the ten small vitals, her consciousness semi aware of the knocking on the door. With haste she poured them into her mouth. By the third one, her eyes started to droop, and she felt herself become numb, her vision starting to blur. A small smile spread across her lips seeing Harry appear behind her, walking towards her. Mikaela felt the familiar calming sensation while continuing to drink. Mikaela had surmised earlier that they were sleeping medication and she read that too much of that kind of drug would knock a person into a fatal slumber. That’s what she wanted. Trembling hands took the last vital and drank it with a forced swallow, her throat becoming numb. The hand gripping the vital lost its grasp sending it crashing onto the counter, shattering in pieces.    </p><p>“Harry.” Mikaela said weakly, her voice only managing a whisper.</p><p>“Mikaela, it’s Mr. Lupin. I know you’re sick and you are not sure who to turn to. Please don’t do this. I’ll take you to whatever hospital you need, your mother be damned at this point.” Remus said, rapting the door.</p><p>Gabriella gaped at the normally peaceful teacher. </p><p>“What did her mom do?” Gabriella asked, while trying to open the door.</p><p>“Grrr! She locked the door!” </p><p>Remus’s eyes darted up and down the empty hallway, searching for the counselor that was supposed to come.</p><p>“I see that. It’s what her mother didn’t do.” Remus said with a slight growl.</p><p> Remus stood in front of the girl’s bathroom with Gabriella. They heard a crash from inside. A small voice uttered something. Remus took another look down the hallway while Gabriella pounded on the door.</p><p>“Shite!” Remus cursed, turning to Gabriella.</p><p>“I need you to not tell anyone what I’m about to do and to not ask any questions. Just listen. Can you do that?” Remus spoke sternly.</p><p>Gabriella nodded, “Yes.”</p><p>Remus felt for the wand holster, bringing out his wand and pointed it at the door. Gabriella gaped and stared at him with wide eyes. A light thud sounded within the room.</p><p>“Alohomora!” Remus casted.</p><p>The lights flickered as the door creaks, swinging open to reveal Mikaela lying on the tile floor on her side. The wheelchair sat vacant, turning off and on by itself.  Remus stormed into the room with Gabriella behind him. Remus kneeled beside the unconscious girl while Gabriella ran near the wheelchair, bending down to disengage it, letting out a relived sigh. </p><p>“It shouldn’t go anywhere now. W-w-was that reacting to magic?” Gabriella asked in a whisper, eyeing her teacher.</p><p>“Ms. Cortez,” Lupin warned, giving Gabriella a pointed look.</p><p>“Sorry! No questions. Got it.” Gabriella quipped.</p><p>“I suppose I should answer that. Yes, it was interfering with the chair. I wasn’t thinking of that beforehand.” Remus responded, placing a hand against Mikaela’s chest. </p><p>Gabriella walked over to the counter, she gasped observing the empty bottles scattered on it.</p><p>“Holy crap! She told us she wasn’t going to use these anymore.” Gabriella said, grabbing hold of one of the empty bottles. </p><p>Gabriella kneeled beside her friend. Remus glanced up from the pale girl, eyeing the potion vital in Gabriella’s hand. The girl’s eyes watered.</p><p>“I-I-I have no idea what it is. Someone gave it to her for anxiety. Something to help her sleep. We told her not to take any more.” Gabriella rambled as Remus took it with his other hand. </p><p>Gabriella stared at her friend’s still form watching her skin blanching even more. Mikaela’s breaths slowed; Remus couldn’t feel her heartbeat.</p><p>The two heard running footsteps that stopped close by followed by two others. The door to the building banged opened, and they heard another pair of footsteps. The clanking of high thigh boots sounded against the linoleum floor followed by smaller footsteps.</p><p>“Mikaela!” Rissa Riddle’s voice sounded.</p><p>Remus groaned. Gabriella stood up saying, “I’ll go get her.”</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>“I unhooked the wheelchair so magic shouldn’t interfere with it again. If it does just hit the green button on top.” Gabriella said before she exited the room.</p><p>A brunette woman sprinted down the hallway, boots clicking against the floor.</p><p>“Miss Riddle, Mikaela’s over here!” Gabriella called out.</p><p>Dark green eyes flicker over to her. Gabriella glanced over behind Mikaela’s mother seeing a dark-haired man fiddling with something on the announcement board. Gabriella sighed in relief thinking he could keep the peace between the mother and teacher. Gabriella approached him after telling Rissa where her daughter was.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, Mikaela is….” The man turns his head towards her, and Gabriella blinked, losing her train of thought.</p><p>The man in front of her had bright green eyes instead of amber, he wore black-rimmed glasses, and there was a lightning bolt scar peeking out beneath black bangs. The man held a wand in his right hand. Gabriella hardly heard Lupin’s voice above her raging thoughts.</p><p>
  <em>That’s not……I…how? I’m not getting whatever Mikaela got, am I? Either that or I’m going nuts with worry.</em>
</p><p>Gabriella heard the man ask something, but she stared gaping like a fish. <em>Did I accidently take that stuff and I’m hallucinating?</em></p><p>Lupin’s voice interrupted her musings, “Miss Riddle, she tried to harm herself, she needs to see someone. I can recommend someone that will come to the house.”</p><p>Rissa came out of the bathroom carrying a limp Mikaela. The man’s eyes widened, and he ran past Gabriella. Gabriella turned.</p><p>“Nonsense, she’s just tired. She’ll be….” Rissa trailed off; her eyes stared wide at the man before running off with Mikaela.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll help you to your car.” The man said in a familiar voice before following the two outside. Lupin followed as well.</p><p>They heard Lupin raise his voice, trailing behind Rissa as he went out the building. “Just tired?! Really? I suppose she is. She’s tired of being sick and thinking her mother doesn’t care. If you cared, you would have had her tested for what is wrong with her and share that information with her. I would have thought that after nearly losing her once, you would have plucked up some sense and done more. If Teddy was that sick, I would have done everything.”</p><p>Rissa glared at Lupin, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>“Why does her health matter to you? You have hundreds of students. Why does she matter?” Rissa spoke.</p><p>“I care for all my students. They all matter to me. Especially the ones that can’t defend themselves from abuse.” Lupin said, glaring back at the woman.</p><p>Anna came up behind Gabriella, finding her friend gawking at Mr. Potter, frozen to the spot.  Anna scoffed and smirked.</p><p>“This is hardly the time to gawk at Potter’s hot body, Brie.” Anna spoke.</p><p>“When did he get glasses, and those boots?”</p><p>Anna rambled on but Gabriella stared ahead.</p><p>“Did you see his eyes? They were green.” Gabriella remarked. </p><p>Anna giggled. “Calm down Brie. I think the heat got to you. They were still that chocolate brown color.”</p><p>Gabriella blinked a couple of times watching Lupin and Mr. Potter escort Rissa out of the building. “No. It didn’t. The light must have reflected weird off something. I dunno.” Gabriella shrugged.  </p><p>“What happened to Mikaela?” Anna asked. “Lupin looked weirded out. What did he mean by, ‘She might be in danger of herself’?” </p><p>Gabriella didn’t answer, instead she followed the four out with Anna trailing behind her. “Gabriella? Wait!” Anna shouted, catching up to her friend.</p><p>Anna slowed down, stopping beside Gabriella. Light sprinkles of cold rain drop rained on them. Anna shivered, sticking her hands into her coat pockets. Anna furrowed her eyebrows, hearing Rissa mumble something while getting into the driver’s seat of the silver mini van parked near the curb. Mikaela slouched in the back seat bundled in a lion print fleece blanket They noticed Mr. Potter, examining the locket around Mikaela’s neck, touching the butterfly.</p><p>“Kaela?” he whispered, gazing up at the pale unconscious girl, his eyes lingering on her face.</p><p>Lupin came beside Anna and Gabriella. “I’m going to head up to the office to figure out what is taking the counselor so long.” Lupin said.</p><p>The engine of the van sounded along with a car door shutting close.</p><p>“Is she alright?” Gabriella asked Lupin,</p><p>Lupin sighed, watching the van drive off.</p><p>“She’s far from it. If the counselor doesn’t help, I am going to contact a friend of mind. She works with children nearby and might be able to help. If that doesn’t work, I’ll take her to a doctor in London.” Lupin said.</p><p>“Her mom probably won’t let you do that.” Anna said.</p><p>“Probably not.” Lupin replied, “However, I am willing to help her in any way.”</p><p>Lupin walked towards the administration building after making sure the two girls were okay. Gabriella stared ahead, watching Mr. Potter, he muttered something that she couldn’t understand. He stepped off the curb and stood swaying slightly in the spot where the van sat moments before. His shoulders trembled, he brought his arms around his middle, walking straight ahead. Gabriella and Anna glanced at each other; Anna shrugged. </p><p>“Is he okay?” Anna mouthed to Gabriella.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Gabriella whispered, shaking her head.  </p><p>“Better make sure. He’s acting strange” Anna replied before following him at a slow pace. Gabriella followed.</p><p>Anna opened her mouth to say something to him when he pivoted on his heels, a loud crack sounded before the man disappeared from the spot. Anna let out a cry, tripping over herself and falling on her butt. Sharp alarms rang out. Behind them, the lights from the school flickered a few seconds before staying on. Gabriella gaped, standing still while Anna’s wide eyes darted around, looking for the guest teacher.</p><p>“D-d-did he just. I-I-I m-m-mean. How?!” Anna stammered.</p><p>Gabriella closed her mouth; she froze to the spot.</p><p>         </p><p>         </p><p> </p>
