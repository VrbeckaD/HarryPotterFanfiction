    <p>You wake up in an unfamiliar room.</p>
<p>Well, more accurately, you wake up in a room that looks like yours but isn’t, and you can tell that it isn’t from the windows and door. This is probably more terrifying than waking up in a room that is completely unfamiliar, because this means that someone has deliberately tried to <em>recreate</em> your room somewhere else and placed you in it. (How long must that have taken? It isn’t like there’s such a thing as <em>magic</em>.)</p>
<p>And then there’s the fact that you can’t seem to sit up.</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” says a quiet, hesitant voice, and you turn to see a pale man with freckles and brown hair, sitting so unobtrusively that you didn’t even notice him there at first. “You’re just ill. Here...”</p>
<p>He is holding a bowl of soup, and he offers you a spoonful. For some bizarre reason, you can’t seem to refuse; you open up to receive the soup. Warm. It’s warm. You can’t focus on any flavor, but you know that it is warm, and it makes your skin and chest feel warm. It's fine. It's nice. Everything is fine.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar man places a hand on your clammy cheek and slowly (affectionately?) runs his thumb back and forth in a little arc under your eye. You can’t seem to mind it; he’s so gentle, and you feel so peculiar, and his demeanor is nearly that of a doctor.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry at all,” the man says, even more quietly than before. “I will take such good care of you.”</p>
