    <p>Jon glanced at the clock in the hall with impatience. It was September 1<sup>st</sup>, and his siblings were all running late. Unlike Jon, they weren’t super thrilled to leave their home after a summer of nostalgic fun with the entire family. Sansa was seriously stalling, fussing over which clothes and books to bring. Robb was his calm and relaxed self, and he was quick to settle Sansa’s frantic complaining, which could be heard all through the house. Arya was very much running through the corridors, switching between jittery nerves and extreme excitement over her first year at Hogwarts. Catelyn was overseeing Rickon and Bran’s breakfast in the kitchen, and Jon preferred waiting in the grand hallway with his suitcase already packed where her cold stare could not follow.</p><p>Jon let his eyes wander around the, in his opinion, rather grand hallway. It had been in his father’s family for many years, and nearly every corner of the mansion was permeated with history. The walls of the entryway were a black slate, and the floor was a weathered but beautiful grey marble. Catelyn’s touch mainly showed in the soft green curtains and decorations, and the pictures of the Stark family on the walls lining the staircase.</p><p>Absentmindedly, Jon reached for his wand in his back pocket. He found the pliable cypress wood of his wand with his fingers and explored its familiar ridges for a long moment.</p><p>Arya raced past Jon, her newly obtained wand clutched tightly in her hand and her wolfdog Nymeria bouncing after her. She did an impressive turn on the hallway’s marble floor, and skidded back his way until she was right in front of him.</p><p>“Jon! Is it true that the Sorting Hat will judge and sort you based on your most private thoughts?” she said with an excited smile.</p><p>“I think it bases your House more on your characteristics and the choices you make,” Jon responded with a chuckle, gently ruffling up his little sister’s hair. <em>Well, half-sister…</em> He grimaced slightly at the intrusive thought, but quickly composed his face.</p><p>“Did you know the Sorting Hat used to belong to Godric Gryffindor himself?! Do think it’s biased because of it?” Arya asked eagerly.</p><p>“I don’t think the Hogwarts Four would allow it to be biased, Arya. They would have ensured it to be impartial, surely.”</p><p>“I hope I’m a Gryffindor like you,” Arya said wishfully. “Although I wouldn’t mind Hufflepuff either since Robb is one.”</p><p>“Whatever House you’re sorted in, you’ll belong,” Jon said with a grin. He watched as his own wolfdog, Ghost, came padding down the hallway, silently but swiftly. The canine gently pressed himself against his leg, and Jon quickly reassured him by gently scratching him behind one of his ears. Nymeria suddenly pounced on her brother, sprinted up the stairs and Ghost raced after her.</p><p>Jon sighed. He’d really miss his white companion. Sometimes, the wolfdog felt like his only ally in the Stark household, especially when Catelyn was on one of her lady-of-the-house streaks, where she would command him to do any chore within sight. If there weren’t any chores to be done, she would create them, although she would never admit it outright. His father, Ned, didn't see it or pretended not to see it, and Jon fervently hoped it wasn't the latter.</p><p>He and his father were on good terms. Ned had always treated him like a son, but Catelyn’s coldness towards him had made it clear to Jon from a young age that he was inherently different than the rest of his siblings. He wasn’t completely oblivious to her plight; he realized very well that he was a permanent reminder of his father’s affair and disloyalty to her. <em>Not like that warrants a lifetime of frigidity.</em></p><p>There was another reason why Jon was inherently different from his siblings. He did not join the Stark family until he was six years old and his mother died. His mother had been a Muggle, but a kind and brave woman who did not shrink away from her son when she discovered the existence of magic. Neither did she shrink away when her son started to show more inexplainable transformations.</p><p>Ned had told him that he first turned when he was about a year old, and that his mother had called him up in a frenzy, because instead of a bouncing baby boy, there was a <em>wolf pup </em>in the crib where her son had been moments ago. His father had rushed over to Wylla’s humble residence, saw the wolf pup for himself, and watched with wide eyes as the pup transformed back into his one-year old son, perfectly alright and laughing loudly at seeing Ned’s familiar face.</p><p>The transformations had been rather impulsive until he was about three years old, when he learned some semblance of self-control due to his mother and father’s diligence and the promise of rewards. The transformation itself seemed to age as he did, as the wolf pup grew older and larger as Jon also grew up. By the time that he was five, Jon knew that he must keep his other side hidden to all but his mother and father, though there were quite a few sightings around their house of what neighbours dubbed a rather shaggy-looking dog.</p><p>Just after he turned six years old, Jon had been picked up by his father, who announced rather solemnly that his mother had perished in a car crash. Jon didn’t truly understand it at the time, and for a while he kept asking for Wylla, but Catelyn’s response to her name taught him quickly that he mustn’t mention her in Catelyn’s presence.</p><p>Ned brought him to his study once, just after he had arrived at the Stark manor, and pleaded with Jon to keep his wolf side hidden from his siblings and step-mother. He mentioned at the time that it would only set Jon apart from his siblings even more, and because his gift was a rare one, it might invite unwanted attention. At the tender age of six Jon hadn’t understood that either, but he did understand the fear in his father’s face, so he kept from shifting anyway.</p><p>His secret had remained hidden to everyone in the Stark manor, except to little Arya. The urge to shift every once in a while grew with each full moon, and Ned allowed Jon to wander the gardens in his wolf form whenever the moon was bright and round in the inky sky, on the condition that he would change back out of the manor’s line of sight. He had forgotten once, and when he shifted back, Arya had been watching from her window. He’d been terribly afraid that she would think him a freak and betray his secret, but instead she had been fascinated and rather disappointed when she learned she did not have the same natural gift.</p><p>Jon let his eyes wander around the hallway and the many pictures that hung framed on the walls lining the grand staircase. Most were of his siblings in varying stages of childhood. Sansa was featured more often because of her photogenic nature, and Arya was featured less because she actively dodged any camera in her path. There were some pictures of him, mostly group shots where he was hidden somewhere in the back. It reflected the way things had always been; his siblings front and centre, and Jon concealed in the back. Not that he’d have it any other way. Any desire for the spotlight wasn’t in his character, and hadn’t been fostered due to Catelyn’s upbringing featuring him as the runt of the family.</p><p>Jon was roused from his brooding when Arya’s slim hand firmly grabbed his. He looked down and saw her frowning as she gazed at the pictures.</p><p>“They’re stupid, huh?”</p><p>“What’s stupid?” he asked.</p><p>“The pictures,” she said simply.</p><p>“They show the family, they’re not stupid,” Jon retorted.</p><p>“They do show the family, but they’re all wrong. Everyone is smiling. We don’t smile all the time. Father spends more time brooding and looking sour than smiling. Sansa pouts more than she smiles, and Bran and Rickon haven’t figured out yet that there’s more than just smiling and pooping and eating. Only Robb smiles as much as he does on the photos.”</p><p>Jon chuckled. “Bran is already nine, and Rickon is five. They’re not babies.”</p><p>Arya continued like he hadn’t said anything. “And there’s no pictures of us together. Just the two of us.”</p><p>Jon felt an ache in his heart at her words. Arya resembled him more than any of her siblings, and she had always gravitated towards him and he to her. He quickly composed his grimace. “Well, you know what,” he said and squeezed her slender hand. “We’ll make sure to take some pictures together at Hogwarts this year.”</p><p>“Mother won’t like it,” Arya said with a slightly wicked grin.</p><p>“And she doesn’t have to know.” Jon smirked and hugged his little sister tightly, swinging her around. He quickly released her before Catelyn would find them, and ushered her up the stairs. “Go see what’s holding up Sansa, okay? We can’t miss the train on your first day.”</p><p>He watched as Arya raced upstairs. Nymeria found her halfway up the landing and chased after her, while Ghost trotted down the stairs and pressed himself against his thigh again. Jon crouched down next to him and took the wolfdog’s maw in his hands, looking down deep into those red eyes.</p><p>“You be good while I’m gone, okay? You take care of your brothers and sisters, and I’ll do the same at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Ghost looked at him quietly, unmoving and unblinking, with those eerie red eyes. Jon felt the wolfdog heavily lean into his hands without as much as a whine, as if sensing their upcoming separation.</p><p>
  <em>You might just be wiser than they give you credit for, my friend.</em>
</p><p>Ghost would always join Jon on his nightly escapades to the garden when the moon stood high in the sky, and although their communication was rather rudimentary, Jon felt like no other creature understood as well as Ghost. </p><p>A loud honk came from outside and Jon tore his eyes from his snowy companion to glance through the window.</p><p>“The car is here!” he called loudly. Sansa came barrelling down the stairs, her trunk sliding gracefully behind her thanks to an enchantment she had put on it before the summer. Sansa’s wolfdog Lady followed her just as gracefully and sat down obediently beside Sansa’s feet when she came to a stop. She glanced at Jon, but otherwise did not respond to him. Robb followed down the stairs next, dragging both his own and Arya’s trunk. Robb grinned widely when he saw Jon, put the trunks down and clapped his brother cheerily on the back.</p><p>“Ready for another year of academic misery and fruitful education?” he asked.</p><p>“I’m just ready for a change of scenery,” Jon said quietly.</p><p>Robb nodded in understanding, grimacing slightly. “I can imagine.” His expression immediately lightened. “But it’s going to be a fantastic year. I can’t wait to see everyone again.”</p><p>“And by everyone you mean Margaery,” Jon said with a grin.</p><p>“Yeah, well, it’s been a while.”</p><p>“You saw her last week.”</p><p>“Only for the weekend,” Robb chuckled. “I just.. I can’t believe how lucky I am to have her as my girl.”</p><p>Jon gazed at his brother with slight amusement. Robb had been over the moon when he and Margaery had gotten together last year, and it seemed his mood extended even beyond the ‘honeymoon’ stage. He felt a mournful stab of envy which he suppressed as soon as it surfaced. Guilt washed over him. Robb was his brother, and although they had been competitive ever since they were little, there was absolutely no reason to be envious of him.</p><p><em>It’s not his fault the world seems to favour him</em>.</p><p>Robb’s lovestruck expression caused a memory featuring a red-headed girl to appear before his mind’s eye, which Jon immediately pushed to the back of his mind. He’d see her again this year at Hogwarts, and he wasn’t quite ready to face that inevitability yet. His relationship with Ygritte had been stormy and intense and it had been over before he knew what was truly happening. Jon was still thoroughly confused by the whole affair; on the one hand he was relieved that he was no longer scrutinized for every one of his characteristics, as Ygritte had loved to call him out on anything she didn’t agree with. On the other hand, he missed her companionship and the way she augmented seemingly everything with her fierce intensity.</p><p>Jon watched as Robb opened his trunk and checked one last time if he had packed everything. Robb’s luck in love wasn’t the only thing he had going for him. As his brother retrieved the silver pin with a small P engraved on it, Jon was reminded of Robb’s position of prefect at Hogwarts. He’d been so last year, and was doing quite a marvellous job at it, acting fairly towards peer and enemy alike.</p><p><em>Not that Robb has any enemies, </em>Jon mused. <em>Except maybe that Baratheon brat, but no surprise there. That boy would insult a tree stump for standing in his way.</em></p><p>Arya came running from the kitchen, followed by Catelyn, Bran and little Rickon. Catelyn’s gaze ran over her children, halting by each one with a smile, but she ignored Jon completely. He clenched his teeth and turned away, burying his hands into Ghost’s fur. Catelyn kissed Robb on both cheeks, hugged Sansa tightly and fussed over Arya’s wild hair. She skipped Jon, and he didn’t mind. Her ignoring him was just part of an old pattern established ages ago, and he managed as long as she stuck to it. He watched as she turned to Robb again, quietly encouraging him to do his best and stay out of trouble. Her voice was as gentle and kind as the words she spoke, and once more, Jon had to suppress a stab of envy.</p><p>A hand gently squeezed his shoulder, and he turned to face his father. Ned gently ushered him to the side for a private moment.</p><p>“Good luck at school this year, Jon,” he said quietly.</p><p>“Thank you, father,” Jon replied just as softly. He could practically feel Catelyn’s eyes boring into this back.</p><p>“I want you to do your best, okay? You’re going into your N.E.W.T.s now and things will be tough, but you have the brain and capabilities to deal with it.”</p><p>“I feel like you should be telling Robb this, father,” Jon said with a wry smile. “He’s the prefect and Quidditch captain of the family, after all.”</p><p>Ned’s expression remained stern. “If you think that I only put stock in ranks, I have raised you wrong, son.”</p><p>“I know you don’t,” Jon said quickly.</p><p>“Then don’t act like that is all that matters to me. You are smart and skilled, but most of all you are <em>good</em>. You –“ Ned cleared his throat and lowered his voice. “You remind me of your mother in that sense.”</p><p>Jon’s eyes widened. His father hardly ever mentioned his mother, least of all her qualities. Except for her name, Wylla Snow, he knew very little about her. The memories that he still had of her were faded and fragmented, and although he owned a picture of her that he kept upstairs stowed away in his belongings, it was an old picture.</p><p>“I’d regret it if you let the – the circumstances of your birth get in the way of what makes you so like her.”</p><p>“Father, you are <em>good</em> too,” Jon said softly. “I suppose I got it from you, too.”</p><p>Ned chuckled and pulled him into a hug. Jon waited a moment before tightly wrapping his arms around his father.</p><p>“She would have been proud of you, Jon. I’m proud of you,” Ned said softly as he broke the hug. He clapped Jon on the shoulder and for a long moment, Jon stared into his father’s dark grey eyes so like his own.</p><p>“Stay safe. Keep it hidden,” Ned murmured, and gazed at Jon until he nodded. He then moved away to say goodbye to the rest of his children, leaving Jon to stand to the side like he’d seen a ghost. </p><p>After everyone finished their goodbyes, Ned herded his children into the car, kissed Catelyn on the cheek and took the front seat. Jon watched as Catelyn waved almost mournfully as they sped away, little Rickon and Bran waving as well.</p><p>They arrived at King’s Cross Station with time to spare, and the closer they got to platform 9 ¾ , the more excited Arya became. Jon kept a close eye on her as she ran from the car, returned with a baggage trolley and singlehandedly tried to haul all of their trunks from the car.</p><p>The moment they ran through the rather solid looking wall to platform 9 ¾, Jon caught his breath as he saw the Hogwarts Express. It was the gateway to the castle that had felt more like home than the Stark manor ever would. His stomach was a nervous mess of jitters as they walked towards the carriages, recognizing fellow Gryffindors and other friendly faces the further they got.</p><p>Theon Greyjoy, a 7<sup>th</sup> year Hufflepuff, was quick to find them. He clapped Robb on the shoulder and punched Jon’s shoulder, then greeted Ned and the other Starks just as warmly. Theon would often spend the summer with the Stark household, because his own family situation was complicated to say the least.</p><p>The next familiar face was exceptionally pretty, Jon had to admit it. Margaery Tyrell nearly knocked Robb over as she flung her arms around his neck, her brown curls dancing as she kissed Robb with fervour. Arya made a puking noise, while Sansa quickly ran to meet her friend Jeyne Pool. Not wanting to continue watching the tongue-fest that was going on between his brother and Margaery, Jon observed the rest of the platform, and his eyes settled on a head of pale, silver-gold hair.</p><p>The nervous jitters in his stomach seemed to intensify a thousand fold and he quickly diverted his gaze. He let his eyes glide along the sleek exterior of the Hogwarts Express, observed the bustling crowd of students and their families, but his gaze was inevitably pulled back towards that pale head of hair once more. Jon reached for his wand in his back pocket, the smooth cypress would doing very little to settle his unease, but he drew as much comfort from it as he could.</p><p>“Who’s she?” Arya asked, startling Jon as she quietly moved beside him.</p><p>“No one,” Jon blurted too quickly, and Arya stared up at him with raised eyebrows.</p><p>“You’re a terrible liar.”</p><p>Jon sighed. <em>She is way too observant for her age.</em> “That is Daenerys Targaryen. She’s a sixth year Gryffindor as well.”</p><p>“Targaryen? Didn’t she transfer from Durmstrang Institute?” Arya asked.</p><p>“She did, yes. Fifth year was her first year here at Hogwarts,” Jon said quietly.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And she’s very talented,” Jon admitted.</p><p>Arya gazed up at him with slightly annoyed eyes. “You are a terrible gossip. Surely there’s some juicy details about her?”</p><p>“I don’t do gossip, little sis,” Jon said with a wry smile.</p><p>“I’ll find out about her from Sansa anyway,” Arya said cheerily.</p><p>“I’m sure you will.”</p><p>“Why don’t you go and say hi to her?”</p><p>Jon grimaced. “Me and Daenerys aren’t on terribly great terms. We’ve been at each other’s throat more times than I can count.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Jon shrugged while keeping his gaze on those pale curls in a sea of black uniforms. “I’m not exactly sure. Maybe she decided I’d make a good practice dummy for her wicked tongue,” he said, his voice slightly bitter.</p><p>“Maybe a fresh start is all you two need,” Arya said with a shrug. She moved away to get her trunk on the train and Jon was left to observe the back of Daenerys Targaryen’s head alone. Somewhere, deep down, Jon hoped that he and Daenerys could have a fresh start. At the same time, he feared any sort of closeness between them purely because he didn’t know what it would entail.</p><p>
  <em>At least when she is yelling at me, I know what to expect. Fire and blood, if she’d really set her mind to it. </em>
</p><p>Someone called his name and Jon turned to find Robb and Margaery trailing off with their suitcases to find a compartment of their own. Somewhere in the distance sounded a shrill whistle that indicated everyone should be getting on the train.</p><p>Jon turned to his father for one last goodbye.</p><p>“Take care of your sisters, Jon,” Ned said, a low rumble in his voice. “And remember what I said.”</p><p>“I will,” Jon said simply, shook his father’s hand and pulled his trunk towards the train without a second glance.</p>
