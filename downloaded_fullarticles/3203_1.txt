    <p dir="ltr">In the grande launch of how life is supposed to work, Remus was dealt the short end of the stick. Of course, it wasn't <em>technically</em> his fault; he was four years old, and his father decides to intervene the trial of a werewolf, going as far as to spout his harsh thoughts towards all werewolves out loud, enough for one of them to attack for them all.</p><p>The exact act of being turned was the purest feeling of pain he will ever remember. Nothing could ever compare to the burning, the snarling, the knowledge of what was happening, the fear he felt crawling through his body and his overwhelming need to get free and get to his mother. He heard yelling, and cursing, and a hex hit him slightly, but all at once the hanging figure above him was gone with the flick of his tongue over his teeth and Remus was safely in his mother's arms, sobbing of pain and fear and his father was looking defeated, back turned to his son.</p><p>"He's still alive, Ly" his mother choked out against her sobs. Quickly, Remus figured out what kind of a stain he would forever be to his family when he saw the look of shock on his father's face.</p><p>That was a few years ago, and now being a handful of full moons later, he gets a kiss from his mother on his head and a nervous smile from his father before he picks up his father's Hogwarts case ("it's on the older side, love.") and struggles his way onto the train. It's crowded, full of children of all different ages, with constant movement and noise and he just wants to sit down, but the lack of seats anywhere was proving difficult. His case is heavier with each step, and he questions if he should just turn back, live a normal muggle life and have nothing to do with the strange man who had come to his family home two weeks ago. The debate was quickly over in his head when he remembered his disease; no werewolf could be normal, and Dumbledore had insisted he would have a safe space and medical attention when he needed it if he went to school. That is probably the safest place he could ever be.</p><p>"Y'alright mate?" He got out of his head enough to notice a busy head of hair, and shocking eyes looking at him. It is clear this kid is on the richer end of the scale, proudly stood, smile wide and hand already outstretched towards Remus. He looks expectant, and the question sits quietly over their heads like a large cat waiting in a tree.</p><p>"Oh, euh - y-yeah, I'm good." The boy smiles, his face lighting up even more. Remus is suddenly very aware of the combined tones in his voice, his Welsh accent on display proudly.</p><p>The boy still held out his hand, and Remus shook as he quickly threw his hand out to meet him. "I'm James, I have a cabin a bit down the cart if you want to join. There's no one there right now so we might make a friend when we return but it's alright because I'm set on making a few friends the first week," he took a moment to breathe, his quick speaking making Remus feel winded. "and you are?" His tongue is stuck at the roof of his mouth, because he wants to be friends with this kid so much, never really having friends before, but his disease would stop him, and he needs to accept that he is just another face in the hallway. But he can pretend, for just this moment, because James has the patience and attention span for Remus to develop his thoughts and voice them before the topic changes, and that has never happened before.</p><p>"Remus."</p><p>"Nice to meet you," he turns around. "Follow me." They make their way down, pushing past students of different ages, before they get to an open door, where a short, squat boy is trying to put his case under the seat. James immediately rushes forwards with a breathy laugh, one that came from the chest, and helps position the other's things in a timely and helpful way, all the while introducing himself. The boy is quiet, but quick, and whimpers out who he is at an impressive rate even to James, based off the surprised look he is sporting. The boys then sit, and they both turn to Remus, who is stood still in the doorway to the cabin. James smiles, introduces Remus to who was apparently Peter and waits for them to acknowledge each other.</p><p>Peter stands, a few centimetres shorter than Remus, and darts his eyes quickly over his features before holding up a shaky wave for only a few seconds. There is no unnecessary contact, and they are both kind of awkward, so Remus figures perhaps Peter could be added to the small group of people he might talk to before the first full moon. James rattles off for a bit, explaining how excited he is, asking for what they think, went off on how he wishes to see Hogsmead and Hogwarts and Remus had only read about these things and heard brief stories from his father. He has never imagined he would be able to see any of it, so to hear James talk and Peter introduce new thoughts about sweet shops and joke shops and moving stairs, Remus is thrilled yet terrified.</p><p>Soon, the conversation shifts when Peter brings up which houses they think they will be in, James puffs his chest and proudly states it will probably be Gryffindor, not that it matters much to him. Peter thinks he might get Hufflepuff, because he believes himself reliable.</p><p>And Remus is stuck.</p><p>He hasn't had much time to actually think about which house he will be sorted into, but the thought of losing his only two friends based on personality traits made him dizzy. His dad said he would be a Ravenclaw because of his curiosity, and after it was explained to her, his mother thought him a Hufflepuff. He knows it would probably not be Slytherin, because he truly has no ambition, and also he is not dark and moody according to both his parents, and he will happily entertain the idea of being a brave Gryffindor, but that is likely not to happen either. No one could explain why; apparently orange is not the right shade for him.</p><p>Just as Remus gets out his thought, a knock at the door crowds the tiny cabin, and all three look up at a thin, willowy built figure, with his hair pushed back in a sweeping quiff and eyes so intense they hurt to look at. He is stood like a soldier, tall and steady, like he has no fears.</p><p>"Could I please sit in this cabin? There is limited space, and we're about to leave the station." It's the accent that got Remus. A twinge of French laced with the thick London accent makes everyone sit up straighter, whether they want to or not. James has a look on him that makes Remus question if he will see the side of him that should not be shown the first day, but he still wore a smile and laughs his breathy laugh of "go ahead" to the stranger.</p><p>So he does. Right across from Remus.</p><p>Which wasn't a big deal except for the fact the stranger crosses his left leg over his right, meaning his foot is now in Remus' leg room. The stranger holds a hand up to James to shake, then Remus, getting their names.</p><p>"And you are?" comes Peter, pushing across Remus slightly to hold the boy's hand.</p><p>"Black, Sirius."</p><p>"Black? Like pure blood Black? Orion?" questiones James, the previous look returning.</p><p>Sirius seems to have a moment of stalling before nodding and smoothing his coat. "That's my father."</p><p>"Cool." They all sit in the awkward silence after the train starts across the countryside, until the moment the trolly comes by, and James and Peter rush forwards towards the snacks, leaving Remus and Sirius still sitting.</p><p>"I like your bag." Sirius speaks, trailing his eyes over the stretched leather of Remus' trunk, before whipping them up to his face. Remus falters, the eye contact too much for even the slightest of moments, and he looks down at his trunk as quick as he can, knowing he needs to respond.</p><p>"Uh, thank you. It's been in the family a while." Sirius hums, and proceeds to look out the window, the dirty bits of London far behind and green fields sprouting up. He isn't sure why, but Remus does not want the quiet that is introduced to him for the first time since he was in the safety of his own home. He wants answers, and to talk to Sirius. He doesn't know why, there is truly no logical reason, but he wants it to happen.</p><p>He breathes for a moment, pushes his tongue around his mouth before blurting out, "what's a pureblood?" He can see his question floating thick between both of them, leaving everything bogged down, and his brain goes into hyper speed, knowing he messed up, knowing he probably caused a strange division in the group, if they stayed a group, and he wants suddenly to pretend like he doesn't exist at all.</p><p>Sirius takes his time to process what has just been asked of him, the gears moving quickly and it is a good fifteen seconds after the question was asked that he jerks his eyes towards Remus again, purses his lips, and tilts his head the slightest to the left. "What?" is sharp against the room, cutting quickly.</p><p>"You and James brought up Black being pureblood. I don't know what that means."</p><p>"Oh. It means I'm a full wizard. No muggle blood in my lineage. My whole family, all full wizard. The House of Black is a pureblood house." Remus lets out a soft 'oh' before looking down again. He is still bursting with questions, but Sirius is quiet, and he doesn't want to be a bother. But he looks up to see if he can pick apart the frustration, the annoyance or the anger on the boy's face, he is met with intense eye contact and an amused face.</p><p>So he goes for it.</p><p>"Will you answer more for me?"</p><p>Sirius lets his mouth crawl into a small smirk. "Yes." Remus lets out a sigh he doesn't truly know he was holding, suddenly able to unload a bit of curiosity onto this new kid.</p><p>"So if my mum was a non-magical person and dad was a wizard...?"</p><p>"Half blood."</p><p>"That's me, I guess. And if he was a pureblood like you?"</p><p>"Still a half blood."</p><p>"Ah. And two non-magical people who make a wizard?"</p><p>"Muggle born."</p><p>"And two wizards who make a non-magic is a swab?"</p><p>"Squib."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>The questions stop. The silence no longer feels heavy, and Remus can breathe again. Sirius lets his rich aristocrat ego slouch a bit, leaning back slightly and pulling out a red trimmed book about magical animals. Remus digs around in his trunk for a pen and his notebook, going to work on a few little sketches. The journey will be long, so he settles a bit and tries to relax.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>By the time they get to the Hogsmead station, James has broken Remus' pen in his excitement, Peter had given him a new one, and Sirius had two naps.</p><p>They are all changed into their new and used robes, leaving their luggage behind and trail after a tall man toward some boats that take them over the lake. It only takes a few moments for them to get out of the boats and trail like ducklings up the winding paths to the castle.</p><p>It is, by all means, a castle, his father had not lied about that. Ghosts, a poltergeist, professors, and students shuffle about, before they can walk into the Great Hall. He knows he is a part of it, but there is a collective gasp as they enter, going between the Hufflepuff table and the Ravenclaw table, the students watching them all enter.</p><p>And then they stand while they are sorted, and he kind of zones out, but notices Sirius go so pale he looks ill when he is Gryffindor, and there is another collective gasp. He doesn't know why, but Sirius does not sit at the table.</p><p>He runs out of the hall.</p><p>After debating with the hat for over seven minutes about which house he should be sorted into, that hat doublechecks what he notices before exclaiming that Remus will be a Gryffindor, the table welcoming him with cheers and whistles and he feels so light he doesn't even remember moving from the stool up front. James lights up when he too is Gryffindor, not that he's surprised, and skips over to sit between Remus and Peter, who is still shocked about the hat's choice. He keeps repeating "it has to be wrong" as a few older students laugh.</p><p>Sirius does not return, and he isn't seen among the students until the next morning in charms class. He sits slouched, closest to the door, the complete opposite of James, Peter and Remus, and he is the first to leave and the last one to arrive to every class the whole day.</p><p>And he doesn't know why, but Remus misses the foot invading his leg space.</p>
