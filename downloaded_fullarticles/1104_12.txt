          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco curled his fingers around the ring of keys he had managed to sneak from Filch’s office. He sped up his walking pace, swiftly making his way to the door he had found last night. It was nearly impossible to find, and the only reason he found it was because he felt the doorknob jam into his back when he leaned against the back wall. He didn’t like to be seen as cowardly, hiding was not something a Malfoy would do. But it wasn’t a fair fight. It was five who could use magic, versus one who if he so much as raised his wand in the wrong direction would be sent to Azkaban. So he hid. And found the door.</p><p>He cast an <em>aparecium</em> and revealed an old wooden door with a single keyhole. He tried casting <em>alohamora</em> but to no avail. So he stole the keys. Once he reached the door he realized his dilemma. There were at least a hundred keys on this keychain, and surely only one of them would open the door. Draco sighed, randomly chose a key, inserted it and turned. The door clicked and swung open. His jaw dropped as he was met with the inside of the Slytherin common rooms. Pansy, Blaise and a few other Slytherins were sitting playing some sort of wizards chess but for more than two players.</p><p>“Draco, why do you look so shocked? We’re just playing a game, you can join if you want.” Pansy gestured towards the board, where one of the pieces decapitated another. Draco sat down and joined the game but was only focused on why and how the door had lead to the Slytherin common room, which was on the opposite side of the castle as the door. He decided he would go back the next night to try it again, in case it was a fluke in the magic because he was a Slytherin. Or something.</p><p>                                      __</p><p>The next night, Draco ventured out of the common rooms to find the door again. He had managed to get there without interacting with anyone. People seemed to be much more confident hexing him now that Voldemort was dead and Lucius was in Azkaban. He took out the keys and carefully found the one he had used last night. He inserted it and opened the door. There were the Slytherin common rooms again. He closed the door and chose another key. He put it in the keyhole and turned, his jaw-dropping when the door unlocked. This time, he was faced with the kitchens and a crowd of house-elves asking what he needed. He stepped through and allowed them to make him a meal. He had missed dinner that night, perhaps that had contributed?</p><p>A few weeks went by with Draco going to the door every other night and trying out a new key. Sometimes it would lead him to the library, sometimes even Hogsmeade. Draco had figured out that this door was kind of like the room of requirement. It took you to where you wanted to go at that moment. He had also noticed that once you use a key to get somewhere, it leads to that location permanently, and every key lead somewhere different.</p><p>Once he had figured this out, he started using the door to get across the castle much faster. He had stopped trying new keys aswell. It was probably just made as a form of quicker transportation, and Draco didn’t think much of it. One night, he decided to try a new key. Carefully sneaking out of his room, he picked out a key at random and opened the door. He was met with the shocked faces of the golden trio.</p><p>“Malfoy? What the fuck are you doing here? And how did you get in?” Harry asked, sounding annoyed.</p><p>“Uh, I, I got the password from a first-year. I wanted to see if it worked. It did,” he stammered.</p><p>“<em>Yeah</em>, I can see that Malfoy.” Harry’s tone was harsh and dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Draco stepped out the door without another word. He didn’t use the door for nearly a month after that. He was mad at the door, even though it wasn’t the door that decided where it leads to. He certainly had not wanted to be int he Gryfindor common rooms. Maybe the magic in that key was faulty. Or something.</p><p>Finally, Draco decided to try the door again. He prudently chose another key, not the one that led to the Gryffindor common rooms, and unlocked the door. It swung open to reveal the great hall, empty except for one other person.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>The other boy jumped at the unexpected noise.</p><p>“Malfoy? What are you doing here? It’s way after hours.”</p><p>“I could ask you the same thing.” Draco took a few steps forward to where Harry was sitting.</p><p>“True. But you still didn’t answer the question,” Harry mumbled.</p><p>Draco took another step forward, now looking down on what Harry had in front of him. It was a simple plate of mashed potatoes with bacon and cheese. Draco could have made it easily when he was seven.</p><p>“You’re eating? Now?” Draco asked, gesturing to the plate.</p><p>“Uh, no. I, I was..” Harry trailed off, looking down. Draco sat beside Harry, still keeping space between them. “You know how I lived with my aunt and uncle, right?”</p><p>“Yes, why you are only the saviour of the wizarding world. Your entire life is broadcasted over every form of media we have. I’m quite sick of it, to be honest.”</p><p>Harry chuckled. “Well, not all of it. They made me cook and clean, and if I didn’t do a good enough job, they’d hurt me.”</p><p>“Oh. I’m sorry,” Draco softened his tone, now comforting instead of his usual snide. “I didn’t know.”</p><p>“You couldn’t have. I don’t tell anyone. Except for Hermione and Ron.”</p><p>“And me,” Draco added.</p><p>“And you,” Harry agreed. “Anyway, I’m trying to replace the bad memories with better ones. So I’m cooking again.” Draco nodded.</p><p>A few minutes passed of Harry playing with the plate of potatoes with his fork until Draco spoke.</p><p>“Ok, well, I’ve got to get back to the common rooms.” He said, walking towards the door.</p><p>“Ok. Bye, Draco.” Draco was surprised to head Harry refer to him by his first name.</p><p>“Bye Harry.”</p><p>                                                         __</p><p>A few nights passed before Draco tried a new key. It led him to Harry in the Prefects bathroom.</p><p>“Shit! Sorry! I didn’t know anyone was in here.” Draco looked away from the bath where Harry was sitting on the edge of the bath.</p><p>“It’s fine, I’m dressed. Just putting my feet in.” Draco looked up to see Harry smiling warmly at him. “Do you want to sit with me?”</p><p>“Uh,” Draco began walking forward towards Harry before he even thought of his answer. “Sure.” He removed his shoes and socks, closing the door behind him and sitting down. He dipped his feet in the warm water, leaned down and rolled his pants legs up. He scooched closer to Harry and removed his tie, taking a deep breath.</p><p>“I,” Draco began, his voice timid and quiet. “I wanted to thank you.”</p><p>“For what?” Harry said, leaning backwards.</p><p>“For speaking at my trials. The things you said, I would have never defended someone like me if they did all the awful things I did to you. I treated you horribly.”</p><p>“Draco,” Harry had kindness in his voice, calming Draco from some of his anxieties. “I forgive you. I knew you had no choice.”</p><p>“I did have a choice though. I, I could have switched sides, I could have been kinder, I, I was a terrible person.” He looked down.</p><p>“You aren’t a terrible person. You’re a good person who made bad decisions. It’s ok. You’ve changed. I know you have.” Draco gently rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry tensed at first but quickly relaxed and listened to Draco’s steady breathing.</p><p>Nearly an hour passed before Draco got up, and went back to his common rooms. So much was said in no words that they didn’t need to say anything more.</p><p>                                                          __</p><p>Every other night Draco used a new key and each time it led him to Harry. When he ran out of new keys, he started making plans with Harry and using the existing keys to get there.</p><p>After a month of hanging out with Harry and them helping each other cope with their pasts, they met up in the Prefects bathroom again. Draco got there first and turned on the bath, then dipping his feet in the warm water. He loosened his tie and Harry walked in.</p><p>Harry walked to the edge of the tub without a word, took his socks and shoes off and put his feet in the water. With still no greeting from Harry, Draco grew concerned.</p><p>“Are you okay, Harry?” He asked.</p><p>“Can, can I see them?” Harry inquired, his voice quiet and nervous.</p><p>“See what?” Draco cocked his head, confused by Harry’s request.</p><p>“The scars. That I did. In the bathroom.”</p><p>Draco tensed. Slowly, he unbuttoned his shirt and removed it, exposing his chest with crisscrossed scars all over it. Harry gasped and hand up to Draco’s chest, gingerly running a finger over one of the scars. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine from the strangely intimate touch.</p><p>“I’m so sorry.” A tear rolled down Harry’s cheek. He gently traced another one of the scars.</p><p>Draco tenderly removed Harry’s hand from his chest. He raised his hand to Harry’s chin and lifted it until his eyes were met with brilliant emerald green ones.</p><p>“It’s ok. I forgive you.” Another sob escaped Harry as Draco pressed their mouth together. The kiss was sloppy and wet and filled with hurt and want and <em>need</em> and complete and utter <em>desperation. </em>But it was perfect.</p><p>                                                       __</p><p>Draco used the key to the Gryfindor common rooms most often. They waited until no one was there and then they met up, whether to talk, cry, kiss, or just hold each other in their arms or all of that. They met each other after everyone had left the great hall so Harry could cook and they could have dinner together. Sometimes the cooked together, sometimes only Harry cooked while Draco wrapped his arms around the taller man’s waist.</p><p>Eventually, they started being riskier and meeting each other in the Slytherin common room while people were there and Harry was under his invisibility cloak, sneaking into Draco’s bedroom. They cast <em>muffliato</em> and <em>colloportus</em> to stop people from being able to hear them or enter the room. Sometimes they were too caught up in the moment to cast the spells, however.</p><p>Close to seven months went by with Harry and Draco’s relationship being secret. The boys were in Draco’s room, kissing each other breathless. Draco rolled his hips gently and was met with a muffled moan into his mouth. They continued like this, frotting against each other until a knock on the door startled them both.</p><p>“Draco? It’s Pansy. I need to see your potions homework, I didn’t finish mine. Why is the door locked? You better not be wanking, I’m coming in. <em>Alohamora!” </em>Draco and Harry jumped apart and scrambled to get the invisibility cloak but it was too late. Pansy walked in, bursting into laughter when she saw how dishevelled the boys were. When she say who the other boy was, there was no describing how hard she was laughing.</p><p>“I fucking knew it! I knew you liked blokes! And you like Potter?! Really?” She finally stopped laughing as Draco turned scarlet. “Guys! Draco’s shaggin’ Harry Potter!” All of the other Slytherins erupted in laughter as well.</p><p>Draco, impossibly red as he muttered, “I’m not shagging him.”</p><p>Draco and Harry had to deal with some hate and lies from the paper, and other people but other than that nobody had too much of a bad reaction. A few jinxes cast at Draco that Harry blocked. The odd whisper of ‘Death eater and the chosen one? He must have hexed him’ or something along those lines was all the backlash they really faced. Ron was positively shocked, and Hermione had sais she sort of knew that he was seeing someone after all that sneaking out. Pansy and Blaise mocked Draco but understood how he felt.</p><p>Draco and Harry started hanging out in public more often. They held hands between classes and exchanged little kisses at Hogsmeade. They decided that it felt much better to not have to keep their relationship a secret anymore.</p><p>                                                          __</p><p>Technically, Draco said “I love you” first.</p><p>Another 5 months had passed. Harry was lying down on the Gryfindor common rooms couch when Draco walked in and sat himself down beside Harry, closing his eyes and sighing.</p><p>“Love you.”</p><p>Draco smiled. “Uh, I love you too.” He felt himself blush down his neck, but he was sort of glad he didn’t have to say it first. The idea of that kinda freaked him out.</p><p>“Hey, Pads? I’m gonna have to call you back.”</p><p>Draco’s eyes shot open to see that Harry had that stupid phone in his hand.</p><p>“Fuck. Harry, I’m sorry, I thought you were talking to me, I didn’t realize-” Harry cut him off with a gentle hand cupping his face.</p><p>“Draco, I do love you.” He gently kissed him, short and sweet.</p><p>Draco flushed an even deeper red.</p><p>“I love you too. Again.” He chuckled softly and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, feeling happier than he’d ever felt before.</p></div>
