    <p>Scorpius Malfoy had a terrible habit of chewing on his quills. It had started when he was first introduced to the Sugar Quills at Hogsmeade; at least those actually tasted good. Now, he would just absently chew on the ends until he had gnawed on them for so long that they were absolutely disgusting and broken. It was happening more often this year. Like any bad habit, his tendency to behave unconsciously was worsened by stress. And as any Hogwarts student knows, past or present, fifth year can be one of the most stressful years of your life. Even if you’re not Harry Potter and had to deal with the government ignoring the apocalypse.</p><p>Which was, coincidentally, the topic of Scorpius’s History of Magic essay and the reason as to why Scorpius wouldn’t stop spitting out the bits of the end of his quill into a cup on his desk expressly there for the purpose of being a spitting cup. He had to admit, It was nasty. Scorpius felt only mildly embarrassed. There were worse habits. He picked up his quill and looked at the end of it, becoming aware of his surroundings and his actions. Stretching gently, Scorpius stood up from his desk and allowed the ink to dry. He had never forgotten the time in second year he had been scrawling at such a rapid and frenzied pace that he had smudged the ink of his essay completely and had to re-do it. There was no charm he knew to undo stupidity.</p><p>“Hiya, Scorpo,” came a voice. Scorpius sighed. He wished, suddenly, that such a charm existed. Barrelling through the dormitory doors came one gloriously idiotic Maxwell Thorne. How someone so utterly dense could have ended up in Ravenclaw was beyond Scorpius. And as his roommate!</p><p>“Hello, Thorne,” he grumbled. Maxwell sat on the edge of Scorpius’ desk, dangerously close to his still-drying essay. The other boy’s limbs were somewhat out of control. He was ridiculously tall and lanky; he had grown up and his body had not yet caught up on width. Scorpius tried not to show that the other Ravenclaw was ruffling his feathers by setting his jaw and staring straight ahead. Unfortunately, he had unknowingly picked up another quill and was madly chewing on it, a dead giveaway of his stress.</p><p>“Who put a stick up your ass today?” his roommate quipped cheerfully. “Oh, wait, that’s been there since you were born. Malfoy family tradition.” Scorpius spat a chunk of quill in the other boy’s direction. Maxwell deftly dodged, used to these types of attacks from Scorpius.</p><p>“Would you leave me alone to do some work? Maybe do some of your own so you actually look like a Ravenclaw for once in your life?” Scorpius muttered. Maxwell only chuckled, sticking out his tongue as he laughed.</p><p>“Since you asked nicely, fine. I was going to ask you if you wanted to come to the Quidditch match tomorrow.” Scorpius raised his eyebrows at the other boy, who was beginning to grin sheepishly. “You know...so you could look like a Ravenclaw for once in your life?</p><p>Scorpius did not have to admit that was an excellent usage of his own insult against him. He was too shocked that the other boy was acknowledging him, nevermind being friendly to him, for the first time since they were both Sorted into Ravenclaw. Regardless, his hatred of Quidditch was almost famous. Added to his outcast persona.</p><p>“Nope. Sorry.” He turned away from Maxwell to read the instructions for the essay again, making sure he was actually answering the question and not going on a tangent. How was the government’s refusal to acknowledge the return of Voldemort in 1995 representative of conservatism within the wizarding world? Cite at least three examples prior to 1991.</p><p>There was a grunt from the doorway. Scorpius looked up. Maxwell had his arms folded and was scowling dejectedly at Scorpius under his thick, black curls.</p><p>“What,” Scorpius groaned exasperatedly. “I’m not sure why you’re so desperate to go to Quidditch with me. We’re not exactly best mates, you feel? Plus, you know as well as everyone else that I despise Quidditch."</p><p>“Pretty please.” Maxwell even stuck out his bottom lip. Scorpius ran his fingers through his hair, knowing full well that the pale blond strands were probably sticking out in every direction now.</p><p>Knowing he had to eventually give in, Scorpius mumbled, “What’s in it for me?”</p><p>“Aha! I always knew you were meant to be in Slytherin.” Scorpius fixed Maxwell with a glare that turned the other boy even paler than normal. “Alright, fine, I’ll keep talking. So it all started with Emma, who really heard it from Rosie, who…”</p><p>Scorpius felt his eyes glazing over. His shoulders slumped. Man, he hadn’t slept well in a long, long time, had he? And Maxwell’s voice was just at the perfect pitch to send him into a mid-afternoon doze. In a desperate attempt to stay awake, he trained his eyes on a freckle on Maxwell’s cheek. He even despised that freckle.</p><p>“Anyway, all you have to do is stay there overnight, and I’ll give you a twenty pack of Sugar Quills.”</p><p>Scorpius tuned back in. "And?"</p><p>When Maxwell fixed the blond Ravenclaw with an apathetic glare, Scorpius held up his hands. “You can’t possibly expect me to do anything for Sugar Quills! Those hardly cost anything, and I can ask my father for them anytime. Come on, something better.”</p><p>“Like what, Malfoy? God, I’m getting tired of you. Maybe I should’ve asked Gabe. Gabe would’ve said yes unquestioningly,” Maxwell said bitterly.</p><p>“Gabe’s a bigger fool than you are and you know it.” The other Ravenclaw boy threw his hands up in the air.</p><p>“Fine! Fine! You know what Malfoy? Fine,” the other boy sneered. “I’ll buy you all of Honeydukes. Breakfast in bed for a month. I’ll hex someone you absolutely despise. If you just go to the game with me. Not even with me. Just go to the game and stand with the Ravenclaws. Maybe even wave your flag a little. Would it kill you?”</p><p>“No, probably not. It’s idiotic to suggest that.” Maxwell’s face was no longer pale, but more the color of pomegranate juice. Scorpius smirked. “You’ll just owe me one.”</p><p>Maxwell’s eyebrows scrunched together. “Owe you one...what?”</p><p>“Just a favor. Any favor. Whenever.” The blond Ravenclaw tapped his quill against his cheek thoughtfully. “Or no deal.”</p><p>Maxwell breathed in deeply and pinched his nose. He stood there for several seconds looking severely constipated. And then he grumbled, “Fine. This is absolutely not how I thought this would go. I can’t believe I expected niceties out of you. But fine. You’re going. This is perfect. See you later, Scorpo Twerpo.” With that, the other boy scuttled out of the room hastily.</p><p>Scorpius realized that he had no idea why Maxwell wanted him at the match in the first place. He shrugged. Worth it to be able to lord this mysterious favor over the other boy’s head. After dipping his quill in ink again, he began to attack his essay a little more feverishly.</p><p>
  <i> The wizarding world has been hesitant to change since the beginning of time; Hogwarts’ second motto should be “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.” As a result of this strict adherence to values from the past, dangerous conservative groups feel safe emerging even in the 21st century. Prior to 1991, however, there was the group of witches known as the Carrion Crows who were largely responsible for terrorizing Muggles in the 1600’s, leading to the mass witch hysteria documented in Salem, Massachusetts and beyond… </i>
</p><p>*</p><p>Scorpius found himself in the stands, as promised, bundled in a blue Ravenclaw scarf and holding a tiny flag with an eagle printed on it. Someone had charmed the flag so that the eagle would fly in a circle and caw when the flag was waved.</p><p>There was a motion attracting his attention. His lip curled instinctively. Maxwell Thorne was waving from the commentator’s box, grinning from ear to ear. Scorpius turned away, only barely acknowledging his roommate. He had to think of something good to force Thorne to do… maybe have him give a hapless fourth year a dosage of Amortentia and have her follow him around for a few days? He shook his head. Too cruel for the fourth year.</p><p>A mighty roar sounded from the crowd. The players were beginning to walk onto the field. Perhaps strut may have been a better word choice for some. On the other sides of the stand, the Gryffindor house had created a gigantic, rippling lion banner that roared loudly for the team members.</p><p>“There’s the Seeker, Maeve Rockhart of Gryffindor, in her seventh year playing Quidditch and second as team captain!” The lithe brunette girl mounted her broom, her face set into an expression of pure determination. Thank Merlin for the commentary, or else Scorpius would be completely lost. He paused for a second. Was he actually slightly grateful to Thorne for even half a second? A weird feeling.</p><p>“Those are the two Beaters, James and Albus Potter from Gryffindor! Not twins, mind you, though you could’ve fooled me.” James waved good-naturedly to the crowd, and then proceeded to mount his proom. Albus had his bat hoisted loftily and nonchalantly onto his shoulders, as if it weighed nothing. Scorpius scoffed as he blew a kiss to the crowd. Arrogant bastard, he thought to himself.</p><p>“The Gryffindor Chasers, Lucy Wang, Markus Smith, and Xavier Brown!” Three other robed figures walked onto the field and assumed position. Lucy was tapping her foot anxiously.</p><p>“And finally, from Gryffindor, the Keeper, Ally Beaumont!” She chose to position herself closer towards the goalposts. </p><p> “Now, for the moment you’ve all been waiting for,” Maxwell yelled into the microphone. “The Ravenclaw team!” Professor McGonagall’s voice quietly reverberated from the microphone saying that Mister Thorne really should remain neutral in his commentary. Scorpius thought he heard a muttered apology from Thorne. </p><p> “Ravenclaw Seeker Molly Dunneth!” She mounted her broom opposite of Maeve and stared her down before cracking a smile. </p><p> “Beaters Ellen Mackery and Sawyer Thompson!” They stood on either side of Molly, staring straight ahead in what appeared to be an intimidating manner. Scorpius wasn’t quite sure, but he waved his flag a little regardless. The eagle let out a caw and flapped its wings. In his opinion, the charm on the flag was far more fascinating than the game that was about to unfold. But a promise was a promise, even if he made it to Thorne. </p><p> “Chasers Rose Granger-Weasley, Carl Yu, and Patrick Dunsing!” Rose grinned wryly at her cousins from across the field, Albus and James, who were pretending to throw their bats at her. </p><p> “And finally, the captain of the Ravenclaw team and Keeper, Ryan Pickett!” Scorpius felt his jaw drop. Sure, he knew Ryan was small, but compared to everyone else on the field he looked absolutely miniature. How on Earth was he supposed to block all the goals with a body mass that miniscule? Quidditch didn’t make any sense. </p><p> Professor Queens blew her whistle, mounted her broom, and threw the Quaffle into the air. With that, all the players took to the skies. Scorpius found himself attempting to block out the bright sun with his hands. There was not a cloud in the sky; he picked a perfect day to abandon his recluse habits. </p><p> “Nice goal made by Granger-Weasley, that’s 10-0 to Ravenclaw. Brown has retrieved the Quaffle and is quickly passing back and forth with Wang and Smith, and they’re streaking up the field… will Pickett save it in time?” </p><p> “Obviously not,” Scorpius scoffed to himself. But to his surprise, the tiny Keeper swatted the Quaffle away and threw it back to his teammates. </p><p> “Albus Potter has smacked a Bludger cleanly at Yu, knocking the Quaffle away. Score is now 50-70, Gryffindor. Ravenclaw really needs to pick it up to put themselves in a better position for the Cup…” </p><p> Scorpius watched as a Bludger flew threw the air at remarkable speed. One of the Gryffindor Beaters -- the one who looked exactly like his father, Harry Potter, was his name Albus maybe? -- was gearing up to hit it straight at an opposing Chaser. There was a cracking sound. A tell-tale hiss that the Bludger was on its way to hit its mark. </p><p> Everyone started screaming. Scorpius was about to ask what for when he realized that he had fallen backwards. All he tasted was blood. His hand flew instinctively to his jaw. There was a terrible commotion from the stands; everyone he had been cheering with moments before was now standing still, immobilized by shock. The Bludger had hit him square in the mouth. Horrified, he swiped his tongue around; had he lost his teeth? Looking down at his robes, he noticed how absolutely soaked the front was with blood. He felt a dizzy rushing sensation in his ears. </p><p>  Within minutes, he was floating out on a stretcher. If he weren’t in so much pain, he could’ve snorted with how ridiculous the situation. He was right to not have wanted to go to this stupid match! Of course the one time he goes to see Quidditch something terrible happens to him! And Thorne owes him twice over at this point, the prick. </p><p>*</p><p>  “Hiya, Scorpy!” </p><p>  Scorpius awoke with a thunderous groan. He wasn’t in that much pain, but hearing that voice made him wish he could stay in the hospital wing for just one extra night. Rubbing his eyes irritably, he grumbled, “What the fuck could you want now, Thorne.” </p><p> “Just got your homework.” Scorpius’ eyes focused on the figure before him, and the impressive stack of books and parchment he had levitating before him. Maxwell waved his wand, and the neatly organized stack fell into disarray at the end of Scorpius’ bed. “Catch you on the flip side, Scorpy Worpy! Have fun!” </p><p> Rolling his eyes, Scorpius leaned over and looked at the first thing on his list. <i> Read pages 212-350 in Magical Drafts and Potions. Summarize the importance of moonstone in potion making on one piece of parchment paper. </i> He groaned and reluctantly pulled out his textbook. </p><p>*</p><p>	Madame Elkin was the next person to visit him. She administered a potion in silence, and he felt the pain in his jaw lessen. “What about my teeth?” he asked. </p><p> "Oh, yes, that’s an easy solution. You broke two and lost one completely. Just a little Skele-Gro and you’ll be out in… 12 hours maybe?” </p><p> “What time is it now?” As much as he’d love to sleep in for once, he really couldn’t afford to miss any classes. </p><p> “Oh, 7 in the evening,” Madame Elkin said nonchalantly. She bustled about the wing, grabbing a skeleton shaped bottle. Scorpius swore his eyes almost fell out of his head.          
“What?” He exclaimed. “I’ve been out the whole day?” </p><p> “I decided I’d just let you rest for now. You have a tough evening ahead of you.” She uncapped the potion and passed the bottle to him. </p><p> “Oh, wonderful,” he muttered sarcastically. Scorpius tipped the bottle back and almost gasped. There was a burning sensation in the back of his throat, and his jaw was aching. The potion tasted horrendous. Worse than rotten milk and broccoli put together. It felt almost as though someone had stuck pins into his gums and jawline. </p><p> He whimpered. “There, there. It’ll only be two hours like this. I’ll just monitor you this evening and see how you feel tomorrow. Though I bet you’ll feel right as rain in the morning.” </p><p> If he had enough energy to make a biting remark, he would’ve. However, his jaw currently felt like it was on fire while also getting pried open. Scorpius settled for a much simpler nod. “For now, so you actually get to sleep, drink a little of this,” Madame Elkin said gently to her charge. She held out a vial of a silverish liquid. Scorpius stared at it questioningly. “It’s only Sleeping Draught. Just so you’re not up half the night.” </p><p> Without further question, Scorpius practically inhaled the potion. He felt his eyes begin to drift shut and smiled with relief. </p><p> The next thing he knew, it was morning. “Mister Malfoy,” Madame Elkin said, jarring the blond Ravenclaw awake. “How are you feeling?” </p><p> “Just fine,” he mumbled. </p><p> “You have a visitor. He’s came around last night when you were sleeping, but I shooed him away. After all, you needed your rest so that you could get your teeth back!” Scorpius brought his hands to his mouth. Sure enough, all three of his teeth were back in working order. “Anyway, I’ll send him in.” </p><p> To his utmost surprise, Albus Potter waltzed in. He had a hand on his neck and his hair was ruffled up. “Uh. Hi,” he said. </p><p> “I suppose you’re the one who landed me in here, huh?” There was no malice in his words. Scorpius was so shocked that he could hardly respond. Why on Earth had Albus Potter come to visit him? </p><p> “Uh, yeah, I guess,” the Gryffindor mumbled, grinning shyly. Scorpius felt like he was in an alternate universe. A Potter boy lacking his trademark confidence? Apologizing? <i> Speaking to a Malfoy? </i> The world had gone truly mad, Scorpius decided. </p><p> “Well, thanks for stopping by. I’m leaving momentarily anyway. But I appreciate the thought.” </p><p> “Oh! Well I can… I can carry your books!” Albus chattered helpfully. Scorpius smiled. </p><p> “Potter, you broke my jaw, not my arms.” Albus looked incredibly sheepish. His cheeks were turning pink and he couldn’t look Scorpius in the eye. Scorpius found himself immensely enjoying the other boy’s awkwardness. </p><p> “Oh.” There was a resounding silence. Scorpius sat up in his bed. </p><p> “You can walk me to Charms,” he decided. </p><p> “Alright. Thanks. I just feel awful, you know,” Albus said. “I really didn’t mean it.” </p><p> “Well of course not! You weren’t aiming for me, were you?” The Ravenclaw boy responded. “How did the game go, anyway?” </p><p> “Gryffindor won. The Snitch was caught maybe thirty seconds after they carted you off the field. Sorry, mate,” Albus said. </p><p> Scorpius laughed. “I couldn’t give a damn about Quidditch. Congrats, I guess.” </p><p> “Wow, you’re maybe the first person I’d ever met who hates Quidditch!” Albus remarked. Madame Elkins pulled Scorpius aside to give him a once over. The Gryffindor stood off to the side, playing with his wand absently. When Scorpius had been declared free to go, Albus stuffed his wand back in his pocket and grabbed Scorpius’ books. </p><p> “Albus, I told you that you don’t need to do that.” </p><p> “What if I want to?” Scorpius felt his mouth go dry for a second, before deciding that it was probably some weird after-effect of the Skele-Gro potion. </p><p> “Well,” he said stiffly. “Thanks.” </p><p> The two boys walked in silence, but it was no longer uncomfortable. In fact, the atmosphere between them wasn’t nearly as awkward as Scorpius had thought it would be, given that their first interaction had been Albus smashing his jaw. They trudged up a staircase before arriving at Scorpius’ Charms class. </p><p> “Here we are, Albus,” the Ravenclaw said eventually. Neither boy made a move to enter the classroom. </p><p>“Al,” the other boy corrected automatically. Scorpius glanced at him. Albus seemed to realize how his tone sounded, and leaped to apologize. "I didn't mean it to sound like that, I just kinda hate my name and no one really ever calls me Albus," the other boy rambled. Scorpius smiled at him, and Albus promptly closed his mouth. </p><p> “Here we are, Al,” he amended. The brown haired Gryffindor looked grateful. “Thanks for… well, you know.” </p><p> “Not a problem.” The two boys continued to stand just outside the door. Class was due to start in a minute and a half, but Scorpius felt no inclination to learn about Cheering Charms at the moment.  </p><p> After a few moments, Scorpius inquired, “Don’t you have another class?” Al’s green eyes widened. </p><p> “Shit!” The other boy exclaimed. “Shit, shit, shit! I have Transfig all the way on the other side of the castle -- Merlin, I’m a total idiot -- I’ll see you around, Scorpo!” The other boy began to dash off. “Fuck, I mean, Scorpius!” Al called from afar. </p><p> Scorpius stood outside the Charms room for a moment longer, a grin making its way onto his face unbidden. Scorpo sounded much more endearing coming from Albus Potter’s mouth than his obnoxious roommate. And he said that he’d see him around? </p><p> For some reason, nothing made him happier than the idea of being friends with Albus Potter, as much as he appeared to be an arrogant bastard. </p><p> With that, Scorpius turned and strided into Charms. The assignment was to perfectly perform a Cheering Charm on yourself.  However, he didn’t feel any different to how he felt before walking into the classroom. Scorpius shrugged. Maybe he needed to say the incantation differently?</p>
