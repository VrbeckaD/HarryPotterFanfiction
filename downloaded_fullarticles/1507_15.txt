    <p>
  <span>The castle’s dungeon passages were well lit with enchanted ever-burning torches, but they never seemed to shake off a certain gloom, accentuated further by the freshly risen June sun outside that was turning the walls and towers far above to a sort of dull gold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But for Cassandra Alice of the pure and ancient house of Crawford, the old damp, stone walls held a familiar, reassuring solidness that she’d come to appreciate, especially this morning. Quite suddenly, she found that she was going to miss these damp passages she’d walked for seven years. They were so different from the place she’d been taught to call home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The historic Crawford manor house at St. Mary’s Loch had been renovated years ago to adhere to the pristine lines and perfect corners and spotless floors that her grandparents and great-grandparents demanded of every aspect of their lives. In contrast, the foundations and walls of Hogwarts were uneven, rambling, and rough like the roots and branches of a living tree. They seemed to almost breath with a sense of its own age and history. Secret passages seemed to grow up through the castle, and doors and stairs shifted and slid away. The people in the portraits talked and laughed and often cracked rude jokes. They were friendly or openly aggressive – as in the case with the funny little knight and his pony.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stopped at a door at the end of the passage and knocked. The voice that called for her to enter was sour, and she pushed open the door a bit hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew the office well, having spent so many hours out of class here, in private tutoring sessions. The walls were lined with potion ingredients and potions in perfect alphabetical order. If she didn’t already know what they were, she could have named most of them and their properties by sight, after her hours of study, in and out of class with her professor. He was sitting at his desk, a stack of exams before him. His black eyes glittered in the torchlight, and his mouth was pinched in a thin line of distase. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeing her, his expression relaxed somewhat, nodded toward a chair facing his desk, and set down the exam in his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need something, Miss Crawford?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slid into the chair. She’d meant to ask about the rumor she’d heard from a Ravenclaw prefect, but now, facing his inscrutable piercing gaze, she was suddenly questioning her choice to drop her toast and come down here straight away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes – sir.” She started, her voice poised and calm. The wild fear that had leaped up at the lurid story Matilda had whispered to her in passing was now safely locked and bolted deep inside, but a little voice at the back of her mind worried that if she asked Professor Snape about it, it just might break back out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering – have you been able to finish my reference letter, yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He raised one dark eyebrow, his eyes never leaving hers, and she felt a little of the worry slip out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because,” she fumbled on, “I know – well, St. Mungo’s gets so many applicants.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continued to stare at her, until she ground to a halt, and the worry began to twist her stomach now into a painful knot. His mouth twisted in a sour look of exaggerated patience as he obviously waited for her to finally ask the real question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor,” she finally blurted, her voice actually shaking. “I heard – from Matilda –” She bit her lip nervously, and her voice dropped to a hoarse whisper. “The – the Dark Lord was – here. Was </span>
  <em>
    <span>back</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dropped her gaze to one of the exams on his desk, fighting for control – wrestling this unexpected outburst of emotion back where it belonged, safe and secure. It was from his first-year class, and poor …. Neville Longbottom’s work was already covered by Professor Snape’s small, cramped notes. The silence dragged on. The silly boy had confused liverwort with newt's eyes. Which was impressive, as they not only looked nothing alike, sounded nothing alike, and acted in completely different ways. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finally met his eyes again, calmed with the thoughts of potion ingredients and a little humorous pity for the boy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mouth was a narrow line. “This is not a matter for school discussion. I can assure you that </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> back. He – some part of the Dark Lord – was using Professor Quirrell to steal an artifact that was hidden here at the school. But he was stopped and is gone. Quirrell is dead. That is all you need to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, relief flooding out any lingering worry. “Thank you, Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “I will thank you to help the teachers prevent wild stories from traveling further through the school.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As a prefect, supporting the teachers was definitely part of her responsibilities.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” he said. His crisp voice communicated that subject was closed, and he’d answer no more questions. He straightened. “As it is, I have completed the recommendation letter, and it is now on the headmaster's desk, as he’s graciously agreed to add a postscript of his own. Right now, as you can imagine, Professor Dumbledore is quite preoccupied, but I assure you, he will make sure to send it on before the end of term.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cassandra grinned. “Oh, thank you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Professor Snape’s mouth curled into something like a smile. “You’ve worked harder than the rest of my N.E.W.T. classes combined on Potions, and your effort to master spell theory over the last two years is impressive. Professor Dumbledore agrees with me that, if you are willing to </span>
  <em>
    <span>maintain</span>
  </em>
  <span> this level of dedication at St. Mungo’s, you will make a quite decent healer.” He picked up the exam and his face returned to the sour pinch he’d worn when she’d entered. “Good day, miss Crawford.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the most glowing praise she’d ever heard from her mentor, and understanding the dismissal, she practically floated out of his office and back up the stairs to the great hall where wild rumors were flying about in hissed whispers. She immediately started to work her way down the Slytherin table, correcting insane theories, but offering no new information. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next few days were filled with June sunshine and flying rumors. Eventually, the student body seemed to land on an account of what happened that went something like three Gryffindor first-years, one of whom being Boy Who Lived Harry Potter, fought their way through a series of protections the teachers had put in place to guard the famed Philosopher’s Stone – the creation of Nicolas Flamel – to protect the stone from Professor Quirinus Quirrell, who’d tried to steal it, in some way under the influence of He Who Must Not Be Named. Potter had fought him and protected the stone until Professor Dumbledore was able to come to his rescue. Quirrell died in the fight, and Potter was recovering in the hospital wing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the middle of it all, Cassandra was still busy, sitting for her final three brutal tests between her and the five Os or Es she needed for St. Mungo’s to take her on as a trainee. Without those grades, all the letters in the world from Professor Snape and Professor Dumbledore would mean squat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike her O.W.L.s, which she’d taken with her whole class, each N.E.W.T. student was assigned an individual appointment for each subject with the Ministry testers throughout exam week. For Potions, the tests had started even earlier, as the four major N.E.W.T. potions take a month or longer to brew, so the testers observed her as she started them, then they were placed in a locked cabinet that they could only access under Professor Snape’s observation. Finally, during exam week, the potions were brought back out, and the testers observed any final ingredients. It was a stressful month as they watched their potions turn the correct colors and reach the right markers along the way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During her final appointment with the potions testors, Cassandra was asked to brew a fifth potion, as drawn from a bag, from start to finish along with completing the four big ones. It had been a grueling five hours on Tuesday, but as she filled a vial of each before the two slightest observers, she’d felt a decided sense of relief verging on euphoria, as each looked and smelled perfect. They took them, and before her watching eyes, magically sealed them with her name now glowing across their labels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had to admit to being disappointed that there had been no way she’d been able to sneak any of the potions – except for her Amortentia. The concept of love potions had always made her feel a little queasy. She’d been reminded of her dad’s flippant confession to using it to control her mum too many times to ever chose to go near the stuff. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But to have even a few drops of Felix Felicis – </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> would have been lovely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her Defense Against the Dark Arts test was held Wednesday after dinner – just hours before the stone fiasco. In their private sessions since her fifth year when she’d decided she wanted to become a healer, Professor Snape had taught her to sense and understand the magic behind curses and hexes. Stopping, blocking, and healing from them was not a matter of a book of magical remedies that a silly housewife could buy and place on her shelf, he’d told her in his quiet, cold voice in their first session that year. It’s an ever-changing, ever-mutating creature that must be understood, that must be known, that must be respected, to be defeated – that was why DADA was a required N.E.W.T. for healers, after all. Even if most never thought about the class again, he’d added snidely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to understand curses and hexes – yes, miss Crawford, even the Dark Arts – to know what drives them and makes them work – if you have </span>
  <em>
    <span>any</span>
  </em>
  <span> ambition to be anything more than a hack at St. Mungo’s and spend your days repairing wizards who stupidly tried to make their own Flu Powder or to magic off acne, or splinched themselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wide eyed and a little pale, she’d nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark Arts had certainly been floating around Slytherin house for years – it was something everyone liked to pretend to know all about, but then, when it came to it, most of them were as clueless as the most good-natured Hufflepuff. But to actually have Professor Snape basicly offer to teach her not just the Dark Arts, but how they worked – it was a whole new, terrifying and exhilarating prospect. He’d made her swear to not share what she was learning with her classmates. To not tell anything, and just say she was taking extra classes in Potions, if it came to that. To prepare for her O.W.L. so she’d get high enough marks to take it in N.E.W.T. level.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so, as she’d listen to the boasting about what a classmate could do, she’d smile and go back to reading, completely aware that the little second-year didn’t have a clue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The final three tests – Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology, after Professor Snape’s training, had gone smoothly enough. Transfiguration and Charms worked the same way the Dark Arts did, and understanding one allowed her to easily grasp the light concepts of the other two subjects.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Herbology, being such an important aspect of Potions, had been the last and easiest of all, and on Friday afternoon, she left the greenhouse and blinked in the afternoon sun, suddenly realizing that it was over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced around the grounds. Students sat and talked or chased each other around, all done with their exams as well. But they’d all be back for another year in September. When she boarded the train for King’s Cross, it would be over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, it would be just beginning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned, and some of the melancholy slipped away. It was time. She was an adult. She’d be training at St. Mungo’s in a month or so, once her N.E.W.T. results came through. And she was going to find her sister.</span>
