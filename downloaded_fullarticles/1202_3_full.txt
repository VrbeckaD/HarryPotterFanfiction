  <strong> <u>Part One: Lord Braxton &amp; Little Lords</u> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Braxton Rosier is sitting in his private dining room, a newspaper laid out on the small table and a House Elf close by finishing his morning tea. On his lap, is a young boy curled up and suckling on his thumb. The boy is Harry Potter. A rather distant cousin, but one who had been orphaned. Braxton was the closest, best choice – his parents were much too old to take on a young child, after all.</p><p>It had been some months ago when the Ministry officials arrived with Harry in tow. The boy was much smaller, laid tightly in a basket. “Other than your parents and grandfather, you have the most Potter blood after Harry here.” A witch explained to him, while a wizard next to her wordlessly handed the basket containing the boy over. “By Ministry law, you have custody. It’s up to you what happens next.”</p><p>Meaning, Harry could have stayed with Braxton or, he could’ve been given to muggle authorities to handle in their orphanages or simply trace further back to find the next living relative. Braxton chose to at least temporarily keep the child and wrote to his parents for advice. That had been when his grandfather, Fibius, stepped in and asked Braxton to please take the boy.</p><p>“He’s a close cousin of my own,” His grandfather had said. Braxton’s grandfather is dreadfully old, but he could still see the sorrow in his grandfather’s eyes behind the hanging wrinkles and dusty lens of his glasses. “It’s the Potter line. It should be my responsibility, but I can’t. Please, my boy.”</p><p>So Braxton wrote to the Ministry and confirmed he would take on the boy as his ward.</p><p>Since, Braxton believes he’s done much to be a fair and good guardian. At first it was very difficult, of course. Harry struggled to take his bottle, likely more used to his mother’s milk versus the stuff Braxton had to stew in a cauldron, but he adapted. Harry is still a very attached child, but Braxton finds he doesn’t very much mind.</p><p>Harry has a room of his own. A semi-elegant nursery, one that many Rosier heirs have slept in, but one that goes mostly unused. Harry prefers to sleep curled next to Braxton at night. Sometimes, Braxton can get his ward to tuck safely at least into the crib still in the master room. Very rarely can he have Harry sleep in the nursery and be alone. Harry just doesn’t like it.</p><p>Braxton sighs when Harry suddenly makes a noise. He looks down. “What is it?” He asks, just as Harry opens his mouth and babbles out some inconsistencies followed by something actually understandable.</p><p>“-milk!” Harry ends, eyes wide and already starting to water.</p><p>“You just had a bottle.” Braxton says, lifting Harry up more. He looks at the House Elf, Flea, preparing his tea and tells it, “Go fetch a bottle of Harry’s milk from the cooler and warm it for me.”</p><p>Flea quickly obeys, knowing to pause her current task to tend to the newest order. She comes back after a couple of minutes, but by then Harry’s getting restless and tugging angrily at Braxton’s robes.</p><p>“Here, sir,” Flea’s voice is high pitched, but softly spoken. She holds the bottle out for her master to take.</p><p>Braxton shakes the bottle slightly before bringing the nipple up to Harry’s mouth. Harry’s hands immediately grab tightly onto it and tips the bottle up.</p><p>While Harry empties his second bottle of the day, Braxton returns his attention to the newspaper and tells the elf to hurry up with his tea.</p><p>It’s shortly later in the day when a letter arrives.</p><p>Braxton is now in his office, accompanied by his third cup of tea, and Harry playing with wooden blocks beside the desk. He’s got papers he should be paying attention to now laid out in front of him instead of the morning’s edition of <em>The Daily Prophet</em>, but instead of doing what he’s supposed to do he’s watching his ward.</p><p>Harry must be hitting milestones, soon. The boy’s begun to grow in some teeth. He talks more, too, though mostly in incoherent babbles and those baby noises with an occasional word thrown in. He can kind of walk, now, without falling down, but the boy seems to still prefer to just crawl or wait to be picked up. Mostly, all Harry has to do is point or cry to get what he needs. There’s not much need to learn to walk or even talk, not yet. Harry’s needs and wants are still very basic.</p><p>Flea pops into the office, right by the shut door. The House Elf bows its head and waits for Braxton’s gesture to come forward.</p><p>“I have a letter, sir, from the Malfoy family.” Flea says, setting the letter on the desk.</p><p>Braxton reaches forward and takes the letter. It comes in light blue parchment, like it had been dyed in water colored like the sky, with dark orange ink written over the top: ‘<em>To Lord Braxton of the Rosier Family, From Lady Narcissa of the House of Malfoy</em>’.</p><p>It’s one of Braxton’s cousins. Narcissa Malfoy, formerly Narcissa Black, the youngest daughter of his Aunt Druella, in fact. They were much closer in their youth, before the war and before the end of the war. She was a few years older than him, but had a son with her husband, Lucius. She married well, Braxton knows. The House of Malfoy, with the decline of the House of Black, is the most powerful pureblood family in Great Britain. Wealthy and politically affluent, armed to the teeth for pureblood society despite being so small.</p><p>He removes the wax seal, stamped with the Malfoy sigil, and unfolds the letter.</p><p>
  <em>Lord Rosier,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Later this week, the young Lord Draco is hosting a small get together in honor of his first birthday at Malfoy Manor. I would love for you and your ward to come attend. It’ll begin at noon on June 5<sup>th</sup>. </em>
</p><p>He stops reading.</p><p>Braxton snorts and drops the letter onto the desk. He has been wondering how long it would be before someone decided to start investigating him and Harry. With the war, he expected it would be a while longer. When does one ever ignore a pureblood heir’s first birthday?</p><p>Even though he doesn’t think he’s going to ignore this party very much, he guesses he doesn’t have much of a choice. Gossip spreads like wildfire among purebloods. He doesn’t need a story of his rudeness being passed around his relatives, ultimately reaching his parents who would immediately scold him like he’s still a child.</p><p>“Well, Harry, what do you think of attending someone’s party?” Braxton asks, turning his body to peer down at the boy.</p><p>Harry simply tosses a block and makes a pleased noise.</p><p>“It sounds good.” Braxton agrees. “Alright. I’ll let them know we’ll be coming. Guess you’ll need some fancier robes. I don’t think my cousins will take too kindly to your diapers.”</p><p>
  <em>June 5<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Malfoy Manor sits over meticulously maintained grounds, tall and as elegant as every Malfoy portrays themselves in their always fashionable, top of the line robes. The manor itself is not overly large, almost small in comparison to the sum of land which surrounds it, but it is most amazing to see with your own eyes. An exterior of white and silver, the shining windows, all down to the grand front doors.</p><p>Braxton and Harry arrive via the firepit in the gardens. Obviously, the Malfoy’s have weakened wards in some way to make it easier for people to transport in for the young heir’s birthday. It might even have something to do with the invitation letter in Braxton’s robe pocket, which he brought just in case he had to talk to the front gate and show proof to the damn thing.</p><p>It’s been years since Braxton walked these grounds.</p><p>In his arms, is Harry, curled up and fisting the front of his robes. His eyes, big and green, stare out in wonder.</p><p>Rosier Manor is antique compared to Malfoy Manor; Dark and grim to the bright and fine, wood where there is stone, English granite instead of Italian marble.</p><p>“I know, Harry, it’s very pretty.” Braxton whispers gently to the boy. “Maybe you’d like the gardens back home redone, hm? Can’t be too expensive to make it livelier.” Or, at least, alive.</p><p>Braxton is roughly ten feet from the firepit when it roars to life again. He turns his head and pauses, watching as someone steps out of the flames. He holds back a shiver when Bellatrix Lestrange comes bounding out, arm in arm with her husband, Rodolphus.</p><p>“Brax!” Bellatrix shrieks in greeting, ever the proper socialite. She beams and tugs her husband to start walking faster. “It’s been so long! Oh, who is this?” She grins, sharp surprisingly clean teeth, eyes darting so quick to the boy in Braxton’s arms that she had barely spared the pureblood lord a glance.</p><p>“This is Harry.” Braxton responds. “The child of the Potter’s.”</p><p>Rodolphus makes a noise. “His parents died from Pox, didn’t they? Sad.” He sounds very bored. “Is he not a halfblood?”</p><p>“He is.” Braxton agrees. “But it’s fine. The Potter family is good, old blood. My grandfather is a Potter, too,”</p><p>“Families are complicated, aren’t they?” Rodolphus cuts him off, while Bellatrix makes faces at Harry. “I always get such a headache looking at the family trees.”</p><p>“Very complicated.” Braxton agrees. Then he resumes walking, trying to effectively end the conversation.</p><p>He isn’t so lucky.</p><p>“Well! Rodolphus and I think it’s absolutely kind of you to take in someone with filthy blood in them.” Bellatrix goes on, arm detaching from her husband so she can skip beside Braxton. The skirts of her layered robes bounce with her, sleek hair still without a single stand sticking up.</p><p>Braxton curls his arm a little tighter around Harry. His ward rests his head back onto Braxton’s chest.</p><p>“He’s not filthy.” Braxton says. “He’s simply a halfblood. Should I remind you of his parents? Despite their age and means of death, they were very powerful.”</p><p>“I heard it’s the elderly Potters who caused them to become sick.” Rodolphus comments. “My brother works at St. Mungo’s. Said the Pox they contracted was pretty fierce. Miraculous, that the boy didn’t get it himself.”</p><p>“It isn’t like the Potter’s are that pure, Brax.” Bellatrix says. “I mean, they aren’t even in the Sacred list.”</p><p>“We all know the Sacred list is nonsense.” Braxton responds tightly. “Where’s Rabastan? He normally tags along with you two.”</p><p>“Rabastan decided to stay home.” Rodolphus says.</p><p>Bellatrix snorts. “He’s such a baby.” She complains.</p><p>Braxton wonders how long this birthday party is going to run.</p><p>The small group reach a large pair of doors, framed in sculpted bushes and vines, which are propped open. A small House Elf stands in the middle, armed with a scroll.</p><p>It greets them. “Hello lords and lady, what are your names?” It asks, undoing the scroll a little clumsily.</p><p>“Bellatrix Lestrange.” “Rodolphus Lestrange.” “Braxton Rosier.”</p><p>The elf looks at Harry. “And?” It pushes.</p><p>“Harry Potter.” Braxton adds.</p><p>It nods and begins to roll the scroll back up. “Please, come inside.” It bows its head. “Lord Draco’s party is down the hall to the right, in the second drawing room.”</p><p>The inside of Malfoy Manor is as beautiful as the out. The carpeted stone floor splits out like a forked road, to the left, right, and front. The small group follows the elf’s instructions and goes down the right hallway, which leads eventually to a large archway to the side.</p><p>“Cissy!” Bellatrix shrieks, bounding from the small group. Braxton is grateful to see the woman attach herself to her younger sister, Narcissa.</p><p>Harry makes a noise.</p><p>Braxton looks over the room and spots a small cluster of children playing. He walks over to them.</p><p>Draco Malfoy is the easiest to spot. The toddler is standing and walking in circles around three other children. An older girl is nearby, who Braxton immediately recognizes as Nymphadora Tonks. The halfblood girl, born from Andromeda Tonks. At least Harry won’t be the only halfblood present. Then, there is a young girl close to the age of Draco and Harry. Braxton assumes she must be his cousin’s daughter, Victoria.</p><p>They quiet as Braxton nears.</p><p>“Hello,” He greets kindly. “Is it okay if Harry plays with you?” He asks.</p><p>The oldest girl nods. “Yes!” She agrees happily, holding her arms out. “Can I hold him?” She asks.</p><p>Braxton hesitates, but allows her to take Harry into her thin arms. He mostly hangs out of them, but Harry is obviously safe. Braxton doesn’t intend to venture far, though, and chooses to stand awkwardly a couple of steps away while Harry integrates himself into the group.</p><p>Despite not wanting to distract himself, it doesn’t take very long before someone decides to strike up yet another conversation with Braxton.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen you around!”</p><p>Evan Rosier, the latest Hogwarts graduate in the family. He beams at Braxton while he walks forward, a little clumsy in each step like maybe he’s hurt his leg.</p><p>“Hello.” Braxton greets back.</p><p>“Merlin,” Evan clasps Braxton’s shoulder. “I heard about you taking on the Potter boy. How is he?”</p><p>“He’s going well.” Braxton replies, glancing over to the children. Evan’s eyes follow the movement. “He was too young, when his parents passed, to be able to miss them. He’s a very happy child.”</p><p>“Your mum was a Potter, right?” Evan presses. “What about the boy’s mum?”</p><p>“A muggleborn, yes.” Braxton sighs. He looks around the room, searching maybe for something to sip on while he socializes. “He’s a halfblood, but the Potter family is a good, pure family. He’ll make a fine husband for a lady, when he’s older.”</p><p>“He will.” Evan agrees. “I think Victoria is his age, too. Since they aren’t closely related, blood wise, it would be advantageous.”</p><p>“Harry’s too young to talk about marriage arrangements.” Braxton says. “What of you, hm? Have you chosen a good witch to settle down with?”</p><p>“I’m still young!” Evan laughs. “What about you, cousin? I think you’re far more desperate in need than I, you’re the one with a kid.”</p><p>Braxton can’t help the laugh. “I have House Elves. Harry’s very well behaved.” He says.</p><p>“You’re also Lord Rosier. We’ll need an heir, one day.” Evan says. “Oh, Carmella!” He shouts.</p><p>An olive skinned witch, dressed in dark green robes, turn her head from where she was talking to Narcissa Malfoy to glance over. She scowls immediately and turns right back away. Narcissa looks, too, and she smiles when she makes eye contact with Braxton.</p><p>“Oops. Think I attracted the lady over.” Evan slaps Braxton’s back. “I think I’ll go bug Lucius, excuse me…” He steps away.</p><p>Narcissa walks full speed towards Braxton. He braces himself for impact.</p><p>“Lord Braxton,” Narcissa’s smile is soft, but true. She holds her hand out. Braxton gently takes it and bows his head, in respect.</p><p>“Lady Narcissa. Thank you for inviting me to your home.” Braxton says before releasing her hand.</p><p>“Now, Draco is the host.” Narcissa corrects.</p><p>Braxton raises his brow in suspect. Narcissa laughs.</p><p>“Yes, alright.” She says. “But in honor and name, Draco is our little host. I’m happy you could make it.”</p><p>“I thought it would be fun for Harry.” Braxton admits. “All the company he really has, is me.”</p><p>“Oh? I’m surprised his godfather hasn’t come storming back in yet.” Narcissa says. “I grew up with Sirius. I know his personality well.”</p><p>“Black has tried.” Braxton says. “I won’t let it happen. He left Harry with a werewolf, after all.”</p><p>Narcissa nods. “He’s blinded by companionship.” She says. “Does Harry do well? Adjusting, to your manor?” She asks.</p><p>“I think so.” Braxton says. “He eats plenty, sleeps straight through the night.”</p><p>“Oh? How much solid food does he eat?” Narcissa asks.</p><p>Braxton pauses before his answer. “None.” He looks around again for a drink, like the glass of firewhiskey in Narcissa’s hand. “I don’t think he’s old enough for it yet. His first birthday is only next month.”</p><p>“I suggest,” Narcissa says. “You start him on solid food. Draco is already eating what I mush up for him. I’ll owl you some recipes I’ve made.”</p><p>“That’s not-“</p><p>“It’s not a problem.” Narcissa quickly cuts him off. “How about I fetch you something to drink? You look parched.”</p>

  <strong> <u>Part Two: Fragility</u> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Harry takes to solid foods fast. Braxton gives the recipes that Narcissa sends him over to the House Elves working down in the kitchen. They immediately, and gladly, brew up the mushy meals for Harry to begin to eat. His favorite becomes the mashed peaches spiced with cinnamon. He has a small bowl every day for lunch, which Braxton feeds to him using a small silver spoon.</p><p>Another result of Draco’s birthday party, is the new list of friends for Harry to visit. Play dates become increasingly common. Normally, it’s with Draco himself. The two seemed to have become close very easily, the way little children do. Braxton can’t find any fault in the growing friendship. A Malfoy is a very good friend to have, especially for a halfblood lord like Harry.</p><p>As Harry’s birthday nears, Braxton finds it isn’t too difficult to draw up a list of people to invite.</p><p>As Harry’s birthday nears, Braxton also finds the pestering of Sirius Black becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p>Braxton tosses the third letter since the beginning of the month into the fireplace and calls for Flea the House Elf.</p><p>As soon as it pops in, Braxton tells it, “Please dress Harry. I’m going to take him to Diagon Alley.”</p><p>There’s much to do. Braxton has to order a new (small) wardrobe for Harry, since he’s already starting to outgrow what he has. He also needs to order the supplies for Harry’s birthday celebration at the end of month, mostly just for a wide liquor option.</p><p>After about ten minutes, Flea hands Harry up to Braxton. His ward is dressed in all light blue – from the full skirted frock to the petticoat to the ribbon tied around his head like a diadem.</p><p>Harry babbles something in greeting, but Braxton can almost make out his name coming out of it. It’s okay, Harry doesn’t seem to be too far behind, though not ahead, of other children in age in terms of talking.</p><p>Braxton thinks so, anyways. He isn’t entirely certain. He’s just basing this off of Harry’s interactions with Draco and other children.</p><p>They travel to Diagon Alley via Floo, as Harry’s too young to handle Apparition without simply puking and Braxton isn’t inclined to having to take a moment to vanish away vomit.</p><p>Stepping out of the public Floo pits, Braxton breathes in the warm air before moving out of the way for the next arrival.</p><p>The Diagon Alley public Floo pits were a new addition to the alley, but one Braxton appreciated. He simply paid the attendant on the exit for using the pit and it was much easier than trying to stumble out into the Leaky Cauldron, which is almost always a cluster of people and…Not.</p><p>At the exit today is a young wizard. He’s obviously still in Hogwarts years, but he recognizes Braxton and throws a big smile up at him when he stops and hands him the two knuts.</p><p>“How’re you today, Lord Rosier?” The boy asks. It takes Braxton a moment to finally place the wizard properly – Giovanni Avery, the youngest of Lord Colton Avery and his wife Delilah. The boy frequently stands beside his father and worked as an intern last summer at the Ministry in his father’s office.</p><p>“I’m doing well. How’s your mother?” Braxton asks kindly.</p><p>Giovanni’s smile wavers. “She’s going good.” He says.</p><p>Having more than one son must be hard, Braxton thinks. He bids the young Avery farewell and moves into the alley’s main road. The firstborn son is, of course, the heir. The second born more like a backup heir, but at least has political advantage. A thirdborn son is difficult. There’s no great inheritance promised for him. He has to work much harder than his siblings, because few parents want their daughters to marry a thirdborn.</p><p>At least things are changing, Braxton thinks. There are many more romantic marriages than arranged ones, nowadays. The boy is also a hard worker. Not many purebloods would willingly work as an attendant at the Floo pit.</p><p>Braxton, with Harry held firmly in his arms, walks down the main road in Diagon Alley. It’s rather crowded, but he remembers the month. If he’s remembering right, July is normally the month when students begin getting their letters from Hogwarts.</p><p>Merchants chant slogans and wave products, decorative signs flash and morph in sighs, workers quietly sweep dirt out of their store back to the road. People shove, intentional and not, trying to get to their destination. Still, it’s all fast paced. It’s only roughly a ten minute walk before Braxton is walking off of the road to get to the door to <em>Fair Lady’s</em>.</p><p><em>Fair Lady’s</em> is a small clothing shop ran by Lady Elizaveta Shafiq. She’s an older woman, built like an Amazon warrior in spite of her soft character. The store is also one of the best in Diagon Alley, at least for finer clothing.</p><p>When Braxton steps inside, the bell on top of the door rings.</p><p>A short, young witch organizing rolls of floating cloth greets him. “Lady Eliza is in back finishing up with a client, sir. Feel free to look around while you wait.” She says kindly.</p><p>Braxton nods his head and does just that.</p><p>Like many shops alongside Diagon Alley, the interior of the shop is much bigger than it looks to be from the outside. Past the racks full of fabrics and sample designs, are mannequins.</p><p>Braxton briefly eyes up the cloak draped over a female mannequin, caught on the shining rubies on the clasp. He makes note of it and instead walks on to the child sized mannequins further in back, each decorated in different kinds of outfits.</p><p>“What do you think, Harry?” He asks the child in his arms.</p><p>Harry glances around the options, like he’s truly considering them. He points immediately over to the mannequin dressed in black suited robes with a golden cape hanging around the shoulders.</p><p>“That’s a bit much.” Braxton says. Though he does like how the suited robes look. Might be too much for Harry to wear at his age, but he’s sure Lady Elizaveta would be able to throw something like it together for Harry. No golden cape, though.</p><p>Eventually, Lady Elizaveta comes out in her bright yellow robes talking to her client. It’s an older witch, who she kisses goodbye and tells to come back soon.</p><p>Braxton waits for the witch to come to him. When she does, she’s flashing her teeth in a fat smile.</p><p>“Lord Braxton! Back again so soon?” She greets, as cheerful as ever.</p><p>“Harry’s already growing out many of his things.” Braxton says. “I would like to order a set in the next general size up, to be delivered next month.”</p><p>She nods. “Of course, darling. How about we go look at my books, hm?” She offers, already turning around for Braxton to follow.</p><p>He leaves <em>Fair Lady’s</em> missing some gold and silver, but a receipt for Harry’s next wardrobe in his pocket with the promised delivery date scribbled onto the corner.</p><p>The rest of the shopping trip passes easily. Braxton orders liquor from <em>Lizard &amp; Goose Booze</em> and meat from his butcher. He takes Harry to the toy store at the end. He lets Harry down on his wobbly legs and helps him walk through the aisles, to pick out a toy. Harry chooses a shiny gold and black train set, which the clerk says has been very popular since they got it in.</p><p>Braxton has Harry back in his arms before he leaves the toy store. He’s barely three steps down the road back to the Floo pit when he meets the dark eyes of a wizard standing outside of the bookshop.</p><p>Sirius Black.</p><p>The man recognizes him immediately, or at least the boy in his arms. He comes rushing out into the crowd, but Braxton pushes through with a bit more force than usual to hide himself before he can be caught.</p><p>
  <em>July 29<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Harry falls ill on the 24<sup>th</sup> of July. On the second day of puking and coughing, Braxton calls a Healer in from St. Mungo’s. They diagnose him with a viral infection and give Braxton the order slip for potion cures from a mediwitch. On the fifth day, Harry hasn’t gotten very much better. He calls the Healer in again, for another visit.</p><p>“Has it been keeping down the medicine?” Healer Johnson asks, pressing a finger into the side of Harry’s thin neck.</p><p>“Most of it.” Braxton says. “We had some trouble. He’s been keeping all of it down now, but at first it was hard.”</p><p>“His pulse is weak.” Johnson says. “Has he been drinking water?”</p><p>Braxton nods. Then he confirms it verbally, remembering that the Healer isn’t looking at him.</p><p>“It’s just taking some time to pass.” Johnson decides. “Continue giving him the medicine. As long as he’s keeping it down, he’ll be fine, but it’s going to take more time. A viral infection is hard to beat back, Lord Braxton. It’s nothing magic can make simply disappear. A muggle child, or a weak child, would be long gone. But Harry’s strong. He’ll make it.”</p><p>“Are you sure it’s just a viral infection?” Braxton asks. “Could it be-“</p><p>“It’s not Dragon Pox.” Johnson says. “I understand your fears, but if he would’ve gotten it, he would’ve gotten it much earlier than this.”</p><p>“I’ve read that the Pox can lay dormant for some time.” Braxton says.</p><p>“Not in anything alive. Now, Lord Braxton, I need you to relax. Harry’s ill, but he’s going to be fine. My word, as a Healer.”</p><p>
  <em>July 30<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Braxton sends out the letters canceling Harry’s birthday celebration. He spends the entire day sitting by Harry’s crib, listening to the boy’s shaky breathing.</p><p>
  <em>August 4<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Healer Johnson refuses to come again. He writes to Braxton, telling him that Harry just needs more time to get over the illness.</p><p>
  <em>August 6<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Harry coughs for thirty minutes straight. Braxton swears he can’t hear Harry breathe briefly after the fit. He writes to another Healer, this time.</p><p>
  <em>August 7<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Martha Flint is a young Healer, but not acquainted with St. Mungo’s. She runs a private medical practice. Braxton is referred to her by Narcissa after he writes to her asking about anyone she might know, someone who is good at what they do.</p><p>She picks Harry up out of his crib and then puts him back down.</p><p>“It’s bad.” She tells Braxton. “I’m going brew him a week’s worth of medicine and send it to you tomorrow. If the potion doesn’t get rid of his illness, there won’t be anything else to do.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.” Braxton says. “What does he have? No one’s told me what he has.”</p><p>“Muggles call it a flu.” Flint explains. “He could’ve picked up the illness anywhere. Sometimes, it takes a while for it catch up and make its victim sick. It’s a particular strain of it. I’ve only seen it a couple of times before, personally, but it’s awfully common for muggles. Not so much for us. Our bodies aren’t as used to this strain, so we get sicker from it.”</p><p>“Strain?” Braxton asks, even more confused.</p><p>“It’s a virus, sir. It’s hard to explain. I’m using muggle terms, see, because it’s a muggle disease.” Flint says. She smiles softly. “I give you my word, Lord Braxton, Harry will be well on his road to recovery this time next week.”</p><p>Braxton thinks about the last Healer. He isn’t so sure, but he doesn’t think he has much of a choice. So, he just sighs and nods. “Okay.”</p><p>
  <em>August 13<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Harry is giggling loudly after being sick for over twenty days. Braxton feels like he can’t remember the last time he heard the boy make so much noise. His eyes water, just a little, when Harry wants to be picked up and demands it by swinging his arms.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <u>Part Three: Sirius Black</u> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>James and Lily Potter died from a particularly rare strain of Dragon Pox. The Healers at St. Mungo’s tried and failed to cure them in time, before complications from the illness caused their death. They were hospitalized in quarantine by the time their son turned three months old. They died shortly after. The Ministry of Magic sent a team of Aurors to burn their cottage in Godric’s Hollow down, to make sure the rare strain didn’t spread. Their son, Harry, was briefly quarantined until St. Mungo’s were sure he wasn’t sick, too. He was released and given to his godfather, Sirius Black.</p><p>Sirius Black loved his godson. He forced himself to shake off the devastation of losing one of his best friends, because he had a baby to raise. A boy who lost both of his parents before he ever got to hold them. He worked a little less, didn’t go on quite as many missions, the war became less important to him. Because he had Harry, whose big green eyes were so much like his mother’s but Sirius swore the giggles he made reminded him of an absolutely delighted James.</p><p>The happiness that Sirius took time to brew was dumped mercilessly when he decided to ask his friend, Remus, to babysit Harry while he went on a mission. It wasn’t the first time he had one of his friends watch Harry for him. Around the full moon it was Peter Pettigrew, but mostly it was Remus Lupin. Remus had stood by Sirius after the death of James. Peter has mostly fallen off the map since, broken in his own silent way.</p><p>Someone found out Sirius had left Harry with a werewolf. Within days, Harry was taken away by Ministry officials and he was slapped with a week’s stay in Azkaban for endangering a magical child.</p><p>Sirius cried when he came home to a quiet house.</p><p>Soon after, Sirius petitioned the Ministry to return guardianship. He hired people to fight the case for him. He spent a lot of gold, trying to prove that he was still worthy to raise a kid. It got sent the Wizengamot’s Lower Court eventually, but the woman in pink sitting up at the front tutted and told him, “No.”  </p><p>So, Sirius began to write to Harry’s newest guardian: Braxton Rosier.</p><p>Braxton was Sirius’ senior by only three years, but he never knew the other wizard well. They were in different Houses while in Hogwarts. Occasionally, he saw Braxton at family gatherings around the holidays. When Druella and Cygnus Black hosted their seasonal parties and invited the family, Druella invited her brothers from the Rosier family and their children while Cygnus invited his sister and her children. He knows who Braxton Rosier is, but he just never bothered to actually know him.</p><p>Sirius sent a letter a day. At first, he begged for Braxton to sign guardianship back over. Then, after a month of no responses, he began to beg to at least be a part in Harry’s life.</p><p>Still, Sirius was denied even a response. He began to wonder if Rosier was even reading his letters. If even opening them.</p><p>He contemplated sending a Howler, but Remus advised him against it. It probably wouldn’t help his case very much.</p><p>About a week ago, Sirius had gone to Diagon Alley. He was going to get the supplies for Remus’ next monthly dose of Wolfsbane Potion. As he exited the apothecary, he spotted Braxton Rosier. He wouldn’t have known the wizard, who looked so different from how Sirius last remembered him, but he definitely recognized Harry.</p><p>Little Harry, so much bigger than Sirius had last seen him.</p><p>Braxton’s arm was curled possessively around Harry, the boy clutching tight onto the wizard’s sleeves. His eyes were as baby big as when Sirius last saw them, as clear green as before. Harry had been looking around Diagon Alley in wonder, trying to watch everything happening at once.</p><p>Harry was dressed up like a little pureblood heir. Braxton held him like a mother would, rather than a pureblood father.</p><p>Sirius remembered the look on Braxton’s face when he finally saw Sirius pushing through the crowd to try to get to them. He remembered Braxton’s face when he turned away and quickly pushed through, vanishing into the swarm of witches and wizards, effectively vanishing.</p><p>Suddenly, Sirius understood.</p><p>Wizards like Braxton didn’t exist like anyone Sirius is close to. Sirius had let himself forget so much of pureblood culture and tradition. Seeing Braxton and Harry, it made Sirius remember.</p><p>Harry isn’t just Harry Potter anymore. Harry is Harry Potter, the ward of a pureblood lord. Not just any pureblood lord, too. The Rosier family is an ancient and noble house, just as sacredly pure as the Black family. Not as incredibly wealthy or powerful, but just as filled with old traditions. The way Harry was held by Braxton, it told a deep story.</p><p>Sirius had wondered, shortly after, how long it would be before Braxton Rosier declared Harry to be his heir.</p><p>Sirius knows, now, why Braxton doesn’t return his letters. Braxton doesn’t ignore him because of how he left Harry with a werewolf, but because Sirius is how he is.</p><p>Braxton is undoubtedly bestowing lessons of pureblood tradition and supremacy on Harry, even now though Harry can’t understand those lessons yet. Sirius disowned those traditions and he got blasted off of his family’s tree. By name and blood, Sirius is a Black and a pureblood, but Sirius isn’t worthy enough in Braxton’s eyes. He goes against everything Braxton supports and upholds, after all.</p><p>It’s the Tenth of July and Sirius watches the fireplace while Remus quietly works in the kitchen, a potion cooling on the counter and food cooking on the stove.</p><p>“I think I’m going to write my brother.” Sirius speaks up.</p><p>Remus doesn’t seem to hear him, but he does peak out from the kitchen. “What?” He asks, confused. “I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you.”</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Sirius says. “I’m just thinking.”</p><p>“Oh. Okay.” Remus seems hesitant, but he’s pulling from the doorway to return to the stove in order to stir the stew.</p><p>
  <em>July 31<sup>st</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Sirius doesn’t write to his brother until after he and Remus light a candle stuck on top of a cupcake in honor of Harry’s birthday. Neither of them blow out the candle, but watches the wax melt over buttercream frosting while they silently sit at the kitchen table. When the flame finally goes out, Remus picks up the cupcake and throws it again before cheerfully saying, “I think I’m going to make us penne for dinner.”</p><p>They’ve both heard the rumor that Braxton Rosier’s ward has become ill. From a friend of a friend of Harry’s Healer, the word has traveled. Harry’s sick and he’s been sick for a while. The Healer is, apparently, not entirely certain that the boy is going to make it. Sirius has had the idea of Harry dying without Sirius ever being able to see him again, without ever being able to say a proper goodbye, rattling around his head since Kingsley Shacklebolt told him about it at the last Order meeting.</p><p>The night of Harry’s birthday, Sirius sits down at the desk crammed in the living room and begins to write a letter to his brother.</p><p>He hasn’t spoken to Regulus in a long time, but he knows if anyone could help him seem more proper to a pureblood lord, it would be his little brother.</p><p>
  <em>August 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Regulus wrote back fast. He tells Sirius to meet him at a small café in Diagon Alley, at noon.</p><p>Sirius hasn’t seen his little brother since he graduated from Hogwarts. Regulus looks more like their dad than Sirius ever did. Regulus looks regal and aristocratic, dressed in fine robes, twisting a spoon around a cup of tea across from Sirius like it hasn’t been actual years.</p><p>“I wish you wrote me because you wanted to see me, instead of wanting to use me.” Regulus finally says.</p><p>“Would you have written back?” Sirius asks. “I’m a bloodtraitor, remember?”</p><p>“You are.” Regulus says. “That’s why mother doesn’t want to see you and why father doesn’t correct her when she says you’ve been disowned.”</p><p>Sirius swallows. “I have been disowned.”</p><p>“No.” Regulus corrects. “Mother might have blasted you off of the family tree, but father still has you as his heir. Believe me, we’ve both been trying to correct him.” He smiles crookedly. “When father dies, you’re still going to be Lord Black.”</p><p>“You know I’m going to abdicate.” Sirius says.</p><p>“Not if you ever want to see Harry again.” Regulus puts the silver spoon down on a napkin. He hooks his finger into the cup handle. “You wrote to me because you want Harry back. And, I replied because you’re still the Black family heir. You,” He lifts the cup. “Get to decide my fate when father dies. I’m only the second born.”</p><p>Sirius snorts. “No brotherly favors here, huh?” He asks.</p><p>“Sirius, we haven’t been close since we were boys.” Regulus says. “Do you want my help?”</p><p>“I do.” Sirius says.</p><p>“Well, if you ever want to see Harry again, you have to write father. Reembrace the Black family and our traditions. Then, you’ll become the influence Lord Braxton would be okay with on his ward.” Regulus says simply.</p><p>“Mother still hates me.” Sirius says.</p><p>“She does.” Regulus agrees.</p><p>“What about you?” Sirius asks.</p><p>Regulus points his eyes down at his tea as he takes a sip, like he’s hesitant to answer. He sits it down and finally, again, looks at Sirius in the eyes. “I don’t hate you.” He says, quieter. “You’ll always be my big brother, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius begins to play with the tablecloth. “I don’t think I can be a pureblood heir, all proper, like dad’s going to want.” He says.</p><p>“Sirius, you weren’t always a bloodtraitor. It won’t be hard to take a few steps back.” Regulus says. “What’s more important to you? Your godson, or your desperate need to rebel?”</p><p>“I’m not-“ Sirius cuts himself off. “I’m not, how I am, because I just want to rebel.”</p><p>Regulus looks like he doesn’t believe him. “Choose what you want more, Sirius. Lord Braxton won’t ever let a bloodtraitor mix with his ward.”</p><p>
  <em>August 18<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>“I, Lord Orion, hereby name Sirius Black as my one and only heir.”</p><p>“Please, sign here.”</p><p>Orion reaches and signs his name across the line at the bottom of the long parchment, while the goblin watches him. The goblin’s eyes track every curl of Orion’s letters, stretching lazily out. He dots the ‘i’ neatly and lays the quill down.</p><p>The goblin begins to roll the parchment up. “I will have this officialized by tomorrow, sir.” He says.</p><p>Only a couple steps behind Orion is Sirius, watching with a ball in his throat.</p><p>“I hope you don’t make me regret this, son.” Orion says calmly. “Regulus has been trying very hard to take your seat as heir and your mother hasn’t been the happiest with me since I told her we were going to officialize this.”</p><p>“Dad, I already promised.” Sirius trying hard not to tense up. He feels like he’s doing a hundred steps back, like he’s a little first year at Hogwarts waiting to be sorted all over again. “I’ll uphold the honor of the Black name.”</p><p>“I hope you will.” Orion says.</p><p>The goblin holds a small, shiny brass key out and Orion takes it with a small nod. Orion hands the key out to Sirius.</p><p>“What’s this?” Sirius asks, confused.</p><p>“The key to the heir vault.” Orion says. “It’ll do you well to study the materials within. Every Black heir should know the knowledge within before they ascend to Lord Black.”</p><p>Sirius takes the key, rubbing his thumb over the smooth side.</p><p>“Now, I think you should come sit and have dinner with the family. Your mother would be delighted to have you.” Orion says.</p><p>“Don’t lie.” Sirius says, but Orion just smiles and gestures for him to open the door while the goblin quietly seals the roll of parchment.</p>

  <strong> <u>Part Four: Yule at the Malfoy’s</u> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>December 24<sup>th</sup>, 1981</em>
</p><p>Christmas Eve.</p><p>Braxton Rosier sits quietly in a large armchair, with a glass held in his left hand half-full with mead. A very traditional drink for the holiday, though the name could be anything depending on who you ask in the room. Ask the old Malfoy mumbling to himself in a wheelchair, it would be Saturnalia. Ask Bellatrix Lestrange, it would be Yule. To Braxton, it’s simply Christmas Eve. The winter holiday is the same, no matter the name, because the traditions are exact.</p><p>The largest drawing room at Malfoy Manor has been completely transformed. In the center of the room, roars a large fire. A wild boar roasts above, tended to quietly by a half-dozen House Elves. Barrels full of mead and beer are held in thick, iron racks. Each barrel with a spout, of course. A table full of mugs and glasses sit beside the racks. There’s a large wooden table set up at the farthest side, with two wooden benches set up and two large chairs set up at the front. There will be bread and assorted vegetables set up when the boar is done. They will eat off of wood plates, but still use proper silverware and glasses.</p><p>Harry is sitting with the other children. There’s many more present than Braxton honestly expected.</p><p>There is, of course, Draco Malfoy sitting close to Harry. The girls the same as them, Pansy Parkinson and Victoria Rosier, are playing with the same assortment of toys they had gotten from the gift pile to share. Nymphadora Tonks sits alone, near her mother and trying to juggle marbles while her hair morphed in color and texture. Felix Rosier looks tempted to try to talk to Nymphadora, but instead he twiddles his thumbs and looks around nervously. Luna Lovegood, still an infant, is curled in her mother’s arms while her father eagerly talks to his cousin, Lucius.</p><p>There are many pureblood present. Braxton is impressed by Narcissa Malfoy’s ability to pull so many into the same room together. As of yet, there hasn’t been a single fight.</p><p>The most shocking thing about the holiday at Malfoy Manor is Sirius Black, sitting quietly by Lord Orion who is loudly telling Rodolphus Lestrange about the complexities of proper owl breeding.</p><p>A cousin, Vincent Rosier, comes to him with a mug full of beer. He sits down beside Braxton before he begins to talk.</p><p>“Are you as surprised as I?” Vincent asks.</p><p>Braxton turns his head and looks at his cousin. The other wizard has dark bags under his eyes. His brother, Evan, was killed not too long ago by Ministry officials. The memory still stings. Evan was only eighteen when an Auror struck him down.</p><p>“I am very surprised.” Vincent continues without a response given to him. “Sirius was never one for this type of thing, surely you remember, but I’ve heard he’s living well up to the Black name. He’ll be Lord Black before long. Lord Orion is eager to retire, I’ve heard.”</p><p>“Much like my parents.” Braxton comments. “I wonder what it is, with their generation. All of them have been very eager to give up their lordship.”</p><p>“Except for Lord Abraxas, of course.” Vincent reminds.</p><p>They both look to the old Malfoy. All but officially, Lucius is Lord Malfoy. Abraxas Malfoy certainly lost his mind long ago, but he refuses to give up lordship.</p><p>“The war’s over now, at least. Your lordship will be a lot easier.” Vincent says. “I imagine that’s why they were so eager. So many good purebloods have died.”</p><p>“I would rather the war never have ended.” Braxton mutters. “The Ministry has gotten out of control.”</p><p>Vincent is silent.</p><p>They both, certainly, agree.</p><p>More purebloods have died in the Ministry’s intense questioning and persecution since the Dark Lord’s disappearance than during the actual war. Evan Rosier is only one of few casualties. Still, the Ministry only worsens. As more time passes, the punishments lined up have become more intense and cruel. Azkaban imprisonment have turned into the Kiss, for anyone who doesn’t have family who can still pull a couple of strings.</p><p>The Malfoy’s escaped, barely. They have Lord Abraxas and his tightly controlled network to thank, though none of them know how the senile man has managed to pull it off. The Malfoy’s have saved, also, the Lestrange family. Bellatrix sits quietly as of right now, but they all know she went on a rampage when news broke about the Longbottom boy.</p><p>What Narcissa’s pulled together is a feat to admire indeed.</p><p>Even Andromeda Tonks is making niceties. Her husband isn’t the most welcome, but no one is going to start any fights together. It’s for a time of family and togetherness, to forget the wrongs at least for a day, to ignore the chaos and evolving anarchy happening beyond the warm inside.</p><p>“Harry’s grown quite a bit.” Vincent comments.</p><p>“I can thank Narcissa for that.” Braxton says. “I admit, I didn’t know very much about children. I think Harry still wouldn’t be walking if it wasn’t for her advice.”</p><p>“She’s a great mother.” Vincent says. “You can certainly understand how Lucius is lucky to have her.”</p><p>“How is Felix?” Braxton asks. “I know he and Evan were close.”</p><p>“Better.” Vincent says. “Our parents have mostly kept Felix busy.”</p><p>It’s hard to bury a son, Braxton knows. He looks to Harry, giggling with the other children as they knock down a tower of fist-sized blocks. The wood chunks bounce against each other and the floor.</p><p>“The Rosiers are strong.” Braxton says.</p><p>It doesn’t take too long before everyone is called to the table.</p><p>Narcissa and Lucius take the two large chairs at the head of the table, while Lucius’ father levitates himself over to the other end. Draco claims a seat on his mother’s lap. Everyone else simply sits where they can find room, until everyone has crammed over the wooden benches and the House Elves bring out the first course.</p><p>Vegetable soup. Harry refuses to take even a spoonful.</p><p>Across from Braxton, is Sirius.</p><p>Sirius doesn’t talk to Braxton until the soup is cleared and their goblets of water is replaced with mead. The boar is carved by Lucius and the rest is left to the House Elves, who quietly serve the first servings out to everyone while platters full of bread are brought to the table. Sirius doesn’t even talk yet. No, Sirius doesn’t talk until the boar and bread is replaced with tender beef garnished with onions and baked potatoes, and when their drink is now a dark brew.</p><p>“How is he?” Sirius asks.</p><p>Braxton looks at him in the eye. Harry is on Braxton’s lap, swishing a piece of onion around in his mouth. He doesn’t answer the question, but he says, “You’re very persistent.”</p><p>Sirius smiles.</p><p>Whatever conversation that may have happened then, didn’t, because Bellatrix screeched loudly at one end of the table and surged across to attack Lucius’ cousin – Xenophilius Lovegood. His wife smiles serenely as her husband topples to the floor with Bellatrix’ hand wrapped tight around his throat.</p><p>“Don’t play so rough, dear.” Pandora Lovegood says, so gently.</p><p>At the same time, Andromeda stands tall and points her wand at Vincent. A fat bolt shoots out of the tip of her wand and Braxton can’t even tell what curse she’s used because of Bellatrix’ screaming.</p><p>Now this, Braxton thinks as Harry begins to cry from the sudden commotion, is a pureblood family holiday.</p><p>Braxton doesn’t get to see Bellatrix seethe about wrackspurts and whatever else Xenophilius told her had swarmed the Dark Lord’s brain and made him run off, naked, in a field somewhere. He is, instead, soothing Harry outside of the drawing room and trying to get the scared boy to settle.  He does hear about it, later.</p><p>He does get to hear Andromeda scream, “You’re a pig, Vincent Rosier!” Before seeing her come out of the room with her daughter’s hand in hers and Ted Tonks quickly rushing off behind her. He watches her robes flutter behind her while she rages to her husband and daughter, swearing to never step foot near anyone here if she could help it.</p><p>Harry is still crying when Sirius comes out of the drawing room.</p><p>“Can I?” Sirius asks, walking over them.</p><p>Braxton hesitates. Something makes him agree – so he lets Sirius take the boy from his arms. Harry still cries, but Sirius begins to sing a strange lullaby. Something about a rocking baby and a tree, softly sang down to the boy. It settles Harry until he’s sniffling and beginning to bumble through a mishmash of words.</p><p>“His mum used to sing him that whenever he got upset.” Sirius says, wiping tears off of Harry’s cheeks. Braxton steps forward to take Harry back and Sirius doesn’t fight the move. Harry snuggles into Braxton’s chest, though his eyes are still red and a little watery.</p><p>“He’s being doing very well.” Braxton tells him. “You shouldn’t worry about him so much. I’ve been taking good care of him. He’s going to be a great heir.”</p><p>“There’s more to life than being an heir.” Sirius says.</p><p>Braxton snorts. “Right.” He says, as Sirius’ eyes widen and he shakes his head.</p><p>“Wait, no! Listen, okay? I didn’t mean it like that. I just-“ Sirius swallows. “Please. I want to be a part of his life, please. I’m his godfather. Please.”</p><p>“You’re persistent.” Braxton says. He peaks around into the drawing room, where Bellatrix is tugging on her hair while Xenophilius’ hair is pet by his wife and daughter. “I suppose you can’t be any worse than the rest of the family.”</p><p>He pulls back and looks at Sirius, who is entirely too hopeful. The other wizard is actually beaming.</p><p>Braxton hopes he doesn’t regret allowing this. He even lets Sirius hold Harry again, doesn’t even complain when Sirius makes faces to make Harry laugh.</p>
<hr/><p align="center"> <strong><u>Part Five: <strong>The</strong> Weasley Attack</u></strong></p><p>It was Christmas.</p><p>It was not the first time the Ministry had sent an owl requesting Arthur’s attendance over a holiday.</p><p>Molly had just smiled and kissed her husband goodbye. Told him, “Don’t be gone for long, okay? I want the family to eat dinner together.”</p><p>“Of course, dear.” Arthur said. They kissed again, before he finally left.</p><p>No, it definitely wasn’t the first time Arthur had left on a holiday.</p><p>Neither of them expecting anything to go too terribly wrong. Maybe one of the kids would hurt themselves, but they were all behaving themselves well. Bill and Charlie were playing chess, Fred and George were making faces at Ginny to make her giggle, Ron was curled up against Percy taking a nap while Percy struggled through a copy of <em>Tales of Beedle the Bard</em>.</p><p>Molly set to work on dinner.</p><p>She was slicing potatoes and dropping them into water over the stove when she felt the wards ripple.</p><p>Knife in hand, Molly paused. She looked out the kitchen window. There wasn’t outside she could see, but that didn’t mean anything.</p><p>The war had ended. There shouldn’t be anything to fear. Arthur reassured her that the Ministry was doing its work, Death Eaters have been arrested and sentenced more than the past ten years combined.</p><p>Still, the wards rippled like someone had entered. Arthur always came in from the same side, so she could see him from the window by the stove. She saw nothing.</p><p>Molly was a great witch, but wards had never been her expertise. She thought about the ripple – tried to figure out if it was friend or foe, tried to tell if the magic was trying to warn her, when she heard someone knock.</p><p>“Excuse me! Please! I need help!” A man shouted, from behind the door. “Please!” Fists pounded on the door.</p><p>She pulled her wand free.</p><p>“Bill!” She whispers furiously, out to where the kids are. “Go hide in the attic. Take everyone with you.”</p><p>Her oldest, wide eyed and confused, only nodded. He stood and began to quietly direct everyone away, despite the confusion. Percy held Ron’s hand as they followed Bill up, Charlie picked up Ginny and hooked his hand into Fred’s who hooked his into George’s.</p><p>The man behind the door was still pounding his fists on the wood. Molly waited until she couldn’t hear her children walking before she came up to it.</p><p>“Who is there?” Molly asked.</p><p>“Confringo!”</p><p>The door blasted to bits. Molly flew backwards, but her wand kept tight in her hand.</p><p>She blindly shot out a spell. “Stupefy!” Then another. “Expelliarmus!”</p><p>Through the splinters and blown up dust and dirt, she saw a man emerge with a invisible layer of protection wrapped around him. Both of her spells smacked into the protective bubble, sizzled around until they die.</p><p>Molly stood in time to put up a shield of her own when the man casts a spell.</p><p>The duel was short. Molly battled fiercely. The man toppled back outside, but as Molly prepared to land a finishing blow – while the man’s wand lays discarded to the side and out of reach – the man threw his hand out and cast a wandless spell.</p><p>“Crucio!”</p><p>And Molly fell. She did her best to not give the man any satisfaction, tried not to scream. When the spell died off, the man stood above her and, finally, did she recognize him.</p><p>Bartemius Crouch Jr., whose eyes were heavy and bagged. He looked wild. “I want you to tell me about your brothers.” He said. His wand was back in his hand.</p><p>“My brothers are dead.” Molly spat, trying to stand. She dropped her wand, she realized. She searched for it, but it was useless.</p><p>Crouch sent another curse at her.</p><p>Maybe because it was cast with a wand, it was worse. Molly couldn’t help the scream that escaped her, couldn’t keep her body from writhing in pain.</p><p>The curse didn’t let up for what felt like hours. It was probably only minutes. Crouch stood above her, his wand pointed steadily down.</p><p>Molly gasped for breath when the curse died again. Her face was hot and her body was still tingling with the aftershocks of what felt like thousands of needles piercing her skin over and over again.</p><p>“Don’t give me so much attitude.” Crouch said. “Listen, I know they knew something about my Lord. And if they were going to tell anyone, I know it would be you.”</p><p>“I wasn’t involved with the war.” Molly managed to hiss out. “They wouldn’t have told me anything.”</p><p>“I have seen my father’s files.” Crouch snarled. “I know they visited you before they left, before they died. This was after my Lord’s disappearance. All I need you to do is tell me what they told you!”</p><p>“They were just saying goodbye!” Molly yelled desperately. Hand trying to reach for her wand. It was only a few inches away before Crouch shouted the curse out again.</p><p>It went on and on.</p><p>Crouch would let the curse go on before stopping to press about Molly’s brothers. When she had no answer for him, her would cast the spell again. It went on, and on.</p><p>Molly couldn’t feel the wards ripple when they did next. She was on the floor, groaning softly and drooling. When Bartemius pressed another question, she couldn’t answer.</p><p>Arthur came home with a friend from work, an Auror working on the case with him. It was hard to get out of the Ministry quickly enough.</p><p>By the time Arthur saw the blasted door and rushed instead, Bartemius Crouch Jr. was cursing his wife again. She didn’t have it in her to still scream.</p>
