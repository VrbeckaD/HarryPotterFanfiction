    <h3 align="right">Aug. 1st, 1969</h3><p>Dear whoever gets this letter,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Remus, and I'm 9 years old. My da says we have to move again and I hate it. I was just starting to make a friend here for the first time in my life. He says I'm just too different, and that people might get scared of me. I'm not that scary! Promise! But I know that he's just worried about me. So I guess i can't be that mad at him. He does love me a lot. Even when people say mean things about me, he's there to defend me. Anyways, an old friend of da's told me once, that if a wizard writes a letter, it will magically end up where it needs to be. So I hope that I'm a wizard, because I really want to go to Hogwarts... and I hope that whoever gets this letter.. well I don't know what the rest means but maybe I'll make a friend by trying.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Aug. 02, ‘69</h3><p>Dear Remus, </p><p>Hi! I’m Sirius. I’m also 9! Guess that means when we start Hogwarts, we’ll be in the same year together! (That’s right, <em> when </em> , not <em> if </em>. You’re definitely a wizard! I got your letter!)</p><p>You don’t seem scary to me. People who say mean things to you are just gits, don’t bother with them.</p><p>It’s nice that your da sticks up for you. I wouldn’t know what that’s like. My father’s a wanker. But I have a brother, and I stick up for him. Your da and I have that in common. </p><p>Anyway, I’ll be your friend. To be honest, I could use one too. I wouldn’t really call any of the kids I know my “friends”. They’re mean. All of them. Sons and daughters of the richest wizard prats I’ve ever met. Jerks, every single one of them. Hopefully I won’t be sorted into their house.</p><p>Hope your move goes well. Keep writing me if you want!</p><p>Your new friend,</p><p>Sirius</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Aug. 23rd, 1969</h3><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>I had to wait to write your letter because I wasn’t sure if maybe it was something I just dreamed, or maybe it was just my imagination. I CANNOT believe it worked! I’ve been wanting to research the magic involved but I don’t want to make Da suspicious. He worries. You really think we’ll get to go to Hogwarts together?! That would be amazing! To know someone before we have to get sorted. I don’t know too much about the houses and I’ve only heard rumours about the sorting process. I wonder what we have to do… Maybe it’s a test of some kind? I’m really good at tests, Da says so.</p><p>You say that now, but if you really knew me, you’d probably be scared too. Everyone is eventually. But it’s okay. And besides, if it’s just letters, then you can’t get scared of me.</p><p>That’s a bad word! But I guess you can say it here… I don’t mind. I won’t tell on you. I’m sorry your father is a… well that word. Parents are supposed to love their kids… maybe the magic worked and sent your letter back to me because you could really use a friend too!</p><p>I like that you stick up for your brother though. Anyone who’s like my Da is pretty cool in my books. Though I doubt you’d make us move so often. That reminds me, where are you from? I don’t know how far the magic sent my letter!!</p><p>Those aren’t really friends. Da says that mean people aren’t friends, even if they say they are. He says there is a clear line between playful teasing and just being mean. Maybe one day I’ll learn the difference I guess.</p><p>I’ll be your friend Sirius!! I’ll be a very good friend, I promise! You’ll get letters from me all the time, and I’ll tell you all kinds of things! Just… promise you’ll write me back too?</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Aug. 30th, ‘69</h3><p>Hey Remus!</p><p>Glad to hear back from you! I got worried for a moment there, thought I scared you away!</p><p>Hogwarts houses are basically like this: Slytherin is the worst. It’s for jerks and mean people who think that being a “pureblood” makes you a better wizard. It doesn’t. Gryffindor is where brave people go. That’s what I’m gunning for. Ravenclaw is for smart people. If you’re good at tests, you might end up there. Hufflepuff is the lame house, it’s for everyone else. My cousin married a Hufflepuff guy, so I guess they can’t be all that bad. Still better than Slytherin. No test to get into a house. Some dumb hat tells you what to do. I don’t get it, don’t ask.</p><p>I’m not scared of anything, Remus! That’s why I’m gonna be in Gryffindor! So I obviously can’t be scared of you. Got it?</p><p>You think wanker’s a bad word? You should see what <em> other </em> muggle words I’ve learned! I’ve been sneaking out and listening to them around the city. BOY do they have some good insults!</p><p>I live in London. Where are you? It’s got to be somewhere in the UK, because you mentioned Hogwarts. If you were in France, you’d be talking about Beauxbaton or something. And probably speaking French.</p><p>I’m excited to have you as a friend! I can’t wait to get your next letter. I promise, I’ll keep writing you, so long as you keep writing me!</p><p>See you at Hogwarts, mate!</p><p>Sirius</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Sept. 3rd, 1969</h3><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>You definitely didn’t scare me away. I don’t get scared easy. I think those are pretty cool houses, and to be honest I’d be happy to be in any of them, if it means I get to make friends and be accepted. Maybe Ravenclaw would be a good fit. I do like to study, and I love learning. But then again, I’d be just as fine in that Hufflepuff house. I mean, if they take anyone, then they have to take me right? I’m pretty brave too, my Da says so! So maybe we’ll be in Gryffindor together?! That would be so cool! A new friend and in the same house? Oh man we have to try and make that happen! I wonder if we’ll make a lot of other friends while we are there!</p><p>That sounds like maybe a lot of your family went to Hogwarts! Only my Da did but he doesn’t like to talk about his time there.</p><p>You definitely sound brave! That’s pretty cool! I don’t know anyone else that sounds as brave as you!</p><p>You sneak out?!?! How do you do it? I’ve always wanted to but my parents always keep a close eye on me. They don’t want me to seem odd to the neighbours, or else we’d have to move again. Do you just walk around when you sneak out? Or do you go places? What kinds of other words do you know? Maybe I can try using them sometime too.</p><p>Right now we are in Wales, but I don’t know for how long… It feels like we just got here but I guess we’ll see what my parents say. I’d love to live in London! It seems so… I don’t know the word, but just really really cool.</p><p>I’m definitely going to keep writing!! Though, it might get harder if we are moving again, I’ll still make sure to write you when I can. Magic is pretty amazing like that, isn’t it?</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Remus!</p><p>P.S. I drew you a picture of our cottage. It’s not much but I like it. What does your home look like?</p><p>

<h3 align="right">Sept 14th, ‘69</h3><p>Remus,</p><p>I sure hope we're in Gryffindor together! We'll be the coolest kids in school! Two more years!</p><p>Yup, my whole family went to Hogwarts! They were all sorted into Slytherin, naturally. Yours didn't? Where did they go instead? Durmstrang? Beauxbaton? Ilvermorny?</p><p>Course I sneak out. Can't get any peace and quiet around here. I usually just go to the muggle arcade and I'm back before my parents come home from the ministry. The arcade is this thing where muggles put muggle money into these boxes? And they do things, like press buttons? I don't really get it, but I like watching them. Muggle kids always get to have so much fun. No fancy parties to worry about, not having to be the good son and follow a bunch of rules. Sometimes I wish I was muggle.</p><p>Oh yeah, I have a whole bunch of words! Wanker and tosser, those are the most common. Also arse. I like that one. I've been saying “Merlin's arse”, and it makes father so mad! There's also some worse ones. I said one once (that starts with a B) and mother got so angry, I've never had a beating that bad before! I'll teach it to you once we meet in person, I promise!</p><p>London's alright, I suppose. The muggle areas are fun. Don't much care for the wizarding community here, though. Bunch of arses, if you ask me.</p><p>Your drawing is great! Do you draw a lot? I've never tried, I'm not really artistic. I do like to sing, though, but that's not really art.</p><p>My place is boring, you wouldn't want to see it.</p><p>Can't wait to hear back from you!</p><p>Sirius</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Sept. 28th, ‘69</h3><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>My Da says we might have to move again soon. It makes me sad. I might not be able to write to you as often. But writing you makes me feel better! You are right! We are going to be the coolest kids ever! You definitely sound super cool!</p><p>Oh no! Does that mean your family is all bad guys? That’s not good at all!! Maybe you shouldn’t live there anymore! I don’t know any of those. I didn’t know there were other schools besides Hogwarts. That’s the only one my Da’s ever talked about. He definitely went to Hogwarts but he doesn’t talk much about being a kid. I guess he just tries not to think about the past much.</p><p>But my mum, she’s… well she’s not like us. Dad doesn’t like saying the word because he’s afraid of what people might think, and they’ll hurt us. Or, well her at least. I guess he doesn’t worry about me getting hurt so much anymore. Still though, she didn’t know about any of this until she met my Da. He was hunting Boggarts! Wait, you want to be a muggle!? That’s what my mum is! She’s a muggle! And she wishes she was a witch, just because she thinks me and Da have all the fun. Sometimes I also wish I was a muggle. I think it would mean I’d get to hang out with other kids my age to. And we wouldn’t have to move as much.</p><p>You go to fancy parties? That’s so cool! I’ve never been to a fancy party before. Actually I don’t think I’ve been to a regular party before either. I’ve heard a lot about them. Maybe we can throw a party when we’re at Hogwarts.</p><p>That’s a lot of swears! I’m gonna try and use some of them. I like wanker. I’ve heard my Da say that once, but I don’t think he knew I was listening. I can’t wait for you to teach me all the swears you know! I hope we get to meet soon. Wait you got beaten?? That’s so horrible Sirius!! You shouldn’t live there anymore!! Maybe, if we find somewhere permanent, my Da will let you stay with us. I hope so anyways.</p><p>I like some muggle areas too. I get a lot of weird looks no matter where I go, so I guess it doesn’t matter too much. But where we are living right now, there’s a little secret area a ways past the forest. I like to go there sometimes and just be by myself. It’s nice because there’s a little river and it’s really secluded.</p><p>I’m really glad you like my drawing! I love to draw, and colour, and all that stuff. Singing is pretty cool too though! I don’t really sing, but I think you’d probably be really good at it. You’re cool enough.</p><p>Sirius, what do you want to be when you get older? I’ve been thinking about that lately because I heard some asking their kid yesterday.</p><p>Can’t wait for your next letter!</p><p>Your Friend,</p><p>Remus</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Oct. 10, ‘69</h3><p>Remus,</p><p>Keep writing, even if you can't send the letters. If it makes you feel better, it's worth doing.</p><p>Haha, that would be the dream! Not living here? That's the plan. I just need to be old enough to move out. That's why I'm so excited for Hogwarts! It sucks that your da doesn't talk about it. It's a really cool place! Some of my cousins go there now and they're always telling cool stories!</p><p>Your mom's a muggle?!? That's so cool! I've never met a wizard who was muggle born! What's it like? What was growing up like? Do you have muggle stuff in your house? Do you have a tellyvision? What's that like? Tell me everything!</p><p>Fancy parties are lame. They make you dress up in ugly robes that choke you and you have to socialize with everyone. Tell you what, though. That's a good idea! When we go to Hogwarts, we'll throw tons of parties together!</p><p>Oh yeah, getting beaten is pretty normal around here. Why, is that not how it is at your home? What do they do when you make a mistake? What happens when you cause trouble? That would be so cool to live with you! But I don't want to put you out or anything.</p><p>I get weird looks too. We should buy some muggle clothes so that we can fit in better! Muggles don't seem to like when you walk around in wizard robes!</p><p>I wish I could go see your forest. We don't have anything like that in London.</p><p>When I get older, I think I want to be in a band. A muggle band. Maybe play the guitar! Muggle music is the coolest! And rockstars are so awesome! And they have so much freedom! They can do whatever they want, whenever they want!</p><p>What about you?</p><p>Sirius</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Oct. 30, ‘69</h3><p>Sirius,</p><p>We are moving again.</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Nov. 27, ‘69</h3><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>I’m really sorry I’ve taken so long to write you. When we move, I don’t always find ink and parchment. One thing the muggles have over us is pens and paper. My mum uses them all the time. She thinks some of the things we do are “archaic” but I don’t really know what that means. (Also I had to ask how to write it, but I told mum that it was for practice)</p><p>I guess living at Hogwarts is kinda like living away from home. Where did you want to move when you’re old enough? I want to move on my own too. I don’t want to be a burden to my parents anymore. I’m thinking a little cottage in the middle of nowhere. I like the city, but it’s not the safest place.</p><p>It sounds like you have a huuuge family. That’s so cool. I don’t really have any family besides my parents. And yeah, my mum is pretty nice. But to be honest, we don’t really have a lot of stuff in our house. We have lots of books about magical creatures and stuff, because of my Da’s work, but that’s about it. Mum says it’s because it’s easier to pack up when we have less stuff. But I think she misses having some stuff. No we don’t have a telly, but one of our neighbours did once. We lived next to muggles, and they let me watch it one time. It was some kind of drawing on the telly. It moved, it was the coolest. They called it a cahrtoune or something. I’d like to draw something like that one day.</p><p>But muggle tellies are like magical portraits. They just move inside a little box. Except they don’t talk back to you, or even realise you exist. They just do their own thing. I guess. It’s kinda hard to explain.</p><p>Can we have butterbeer at our party? I’ve heard it’s really good but my parents won’t let me have it because they say I’m too young. Which is really just parent speak for: it’s really good.</p><p>That’s normal?… That sounds really bad actually. When I get in trouble, usually my Da just sits me down and has a long talk with me about what I did wrong and why it was bad. Like when I used a swear the other day, I tried out one of the ones you taught me (I said tosser) and he got really upset. I had to stay in my room for the whole day. But he doesn’t beat me. Maybe he should… Maybe I am really bad and that is normal and… I don’t know Sirius. That’s all too confusing.</p><p>Are you kidding?! You wouldn’t put me out at all! You’re my mate now! And we have to look out for each other. I’d probably hide you in my wardrobe or something, because Da doesn’t like me having friends. But we can be secret friends for sure.</p><p>Wizard clothes? Do you mean those silly looking robes? We dress in muggle clothes a lot, just because when we move, we don’t know how many muggles there will be where we are going so it’s usually a little less spicuous. That’s what my mum says.</p><p>Do you think Hogwarts has a forest? I hope it does. I’d like to run through it and explore!</p><p>That is super cool! I’ve listened to a little bit of muggle music. My mum has a record player, and plays some muggle music for me. My mum has been playing this band called “the Beetles” a lot because they made her sad by announcing they weren’t going to be a band together anymore.</p><p>I think you’d make a great rockstar! They are cool!</p><p>I don’t know what I’d want to do actually. Maybe be a teacher? I like to study and learn, but I think I’d like to teach other kids too. I don’t know if I’d be any good but I think I’d like it.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Remus</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
<h3 align="right">Dec. 24, ‘69</h3><p>*<em>When the letters finally arrive, the last one is quite crinkled, and the writing is very shaky compared to the previous letters. There’s tears on the sides, indicative of some man-made damage to the paper.</em>*</p><p> </p><p>Happy Christmas Sirius.</p><p>I hope these letters send. I missed writing you. I’m sending you a present too. I hope you like it.</p><p>Remus</p><p> </p><p> </p>
