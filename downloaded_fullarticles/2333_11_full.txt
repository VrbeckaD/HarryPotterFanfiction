    <p>"...had <i>no</i> idea if it'd work, I'd never tried Summoning something from that far away before, and while I was waiting meanwhile, I still had this great bloody dragon to deal with, and it hadn't forgot about me for a moment!"</p><p>It's a beautiful day, crisp and bright, a perfect day for flying, and Harry's been in a talkative mood since the morning. His first-years had done well today, almost everyone had actually got into the air for a few seconds not by accident <i>and</i> hovered, and Harry is rewarding them with a flying story, the story of trying to outfly the Hungarian Horntail during the Triwizard Tournament. A few of their parents might have been there to watch, but their eager faces tell him this is a new and exciting story for everyone.</p><p>"I had to hide behind a rock, and the thing started trying to melt its way through, and by now I was getting a bit nervous, my broom had been my only idea and what if I hadn't Summoned it hard enough? But finally I risked a look, and it was pelting down at me, and somehow I managed to make the leap and hang on. The Horntail's fire nearly caught my tail, but we were away."</p><p>"That's <i>so</i> cool, Professor Potter!" cries Peter Harrison, clutching his broom as if he wants to try escaping a flaming dragon right this moment. Harry laughs and absently reaches up to tame his hair as the autumn wind whips it into even more disarray than usual.</p><p>He's about to go on with the story when he's interrupted by a positively <i>scathing,</i> "Professor Potter!" Harry turns, carefully schooling his face into neutrality, but it's an even greater challenge than expected when he's confronted by Malfoy struggling with his wet cloak, and wiping the damp away from his—</p><p>
<i>Don't laugh, don't laugh, </i>don't laugh.
</p><p>"Hello, Professor Malfoy," Harry manages, much too innocently. "Is something the matter?" <i>As if I can't see what's the matter. Brilliant, I can't believe it worked.</i></p><p>"Could I speak to you alone for a moment?" Malfoy grits out. "The bell has gone for afternoon break, you know."</p><p>Harry doesn't roll his eyes, but it's a near thing. "Yeah, I know, we were just getting to know each other a bit," he says instead, and counters by sighing and turning an apologetic smile onto his flock of first-years. "Off you go, then. I'll see you next time."</p><p>Peter Harrison looks heartbroken, hugging his broom as he walks off with two of his friends, and Harry resolves to finish the story after the next lesson. They're good kids, and they deserve an uninterrupted story. He glances at Malfoy, annoyed as always by the pompous attitude, but the sight of those eyebrows sets him grinning again.</p><p>"What do you want, Malfoy? I've got stuff to do," he says when Malfoy just glares at him, and he hopes against hope that it's just going to be a brief conversation. He really does need to get down to the broomshed and try, once again, to get things back in order. It's a losing battle, he knows, but it's <i>his</i> losing battle.</p><p>"Like what?" Malfoy says with a snort of derision. "Counting broomsticks? Checking which way is up? Making sure...actually, that's all I can think of. What is it you do, exactly?"</p><p>Harry is reminded strongly of school, as he often is when he and Malfoy need to have a conversation, but never more so than now. How quickly and easily Malfoy has fallen back into the pattern of hurling mocking accusations, Harry thinks, smoothing his expression, feeling a bit proud of himself that he's not rising to the bait.</p><p>"I don't think you came storming over here to tell me what you think of my job," he says with admirable calm, shifting the broomsticks so one of them stops vibrating against his ribs. "For one thing, I already know how low an opinion you have of me, and for another, I can't see you getting your feet wet just to snipe at me."</p><p>Well. <i>Almost</i> not rising to the bait.</p><p>"No," Malfoy mutters, looking mutinous, and continues almost softly enough that Harry needs to lean in to hear him. "Perhaps I'd just like to know what the hell you think you're playing at?"</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry says calmly, ignoring the ever-so-noticeable Gryffindor-scarlet eyebrow lifting at him.</p><p>"What—did—you—do—to—my—eyebrows?" Malfoy fairly snarls and Harry comes so very close to dropping all of his brooms and falling into a heap of laughter. Only the wet, muddy ground and the very real possibility that Malfoy will hex him into painful oblivion keep him upright, but he can't entirely suppress the grin.</p><p>"Nothing," he says with a too-casual shrug. "It's a good color on you, though," he can't help adding brightly. It's a terrible color, obviously. It's almost obscenely bright, especially against his pale skin and hair. From a distance, it looks like he's bleeding inexplicably from the eyebrows.</p><p>"I know it was you, Potter."</p><p>"I don't think you do," Harry says with serene confidence.</p><p>"So it's merely coincidence, you're suggesting, that the very day after our . . . discussion about certain people's biases in removing House points, I take points—quite rightfully so—"</p><p><i>When has that </i>ever<i> been true?</i> Harry manages not to interject.</p><p>"—from a student in your House and I am immediately rewarded with <i>this</i>?" Malfoy points to his eyebrows and then folds his arms, as if just waiting for Harry to own up now that the trademark Malfoy impeccable logic has been laid out. It's so damn <i>arrogant</i>.</p><p>"It wasn't me," Harry says coolly.</p><p>"Oh, really?"</p><p>"Really." Harry takes a firmer grip on the broomsticks and turns to leave, before he can succumb to the temptation to wallop Malfoy with one of them. He's certain <i>that</i> couldn't be blamed on the notorious capriciousness of the school brooms. "Like I said, I have things to do."</p><p>"I know it was you, Potter!" Malfoy shouts at his back. "And I'm not going to forget it!"</p><p>He's not going to answer, he's <i>not</i>, but he can feel Malfoy's eyes between his shoulder blades, dragging him to a halt. He stops and turns. "Hey, Malfoy?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>For a moment, he's <i>sure</i> that Malfoy thinks he's going to confess. "You do take too many points from Gryffindor," he says instead, and doesn't turn around again.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center><p>"Bloody Malfoy," Harry mutters as he opens the door to the broomshed, catches a falling broom on his foot, hurls the brooms into the darkness within, and slams the door after them. He ignores the faint clatters from inside as he leans against the door, folding his arms and glaring at the sky.</p><p>"Trust <i>you</i> to take the fun out of something like this," he complains at the fluffy white clouds. He hadn't really thought about an ending to the tricky little charm, but he knows he can undo it pretty easily. The question is whether or not he wants to. Malfoy deserves it, the arrogant git, and Harry hadn't been at all surprised to see that Gryffindor red had shown up first.</p><p>"If you had your way, there wouldn't be a ruby left in the Gryffindor glass at all." But talking to an absent Malfoy isn't going to get anything done, Harry knows, and he's already behind schedule. Kicking at a clump of thistle on his way past, Harry storms back up to the castle. The fresh air and truly glorious weather do a lot to improve his mood, and by the time Duelling Club begins he feels refreshed and ready to take whatever his students throw at him, sometimes literally.</p><p>Harry has decided that the best course of action is to ignore Malfoy completely, something he has gotten better at over the years. It won't solve his dilemma of whether to remove the charm or leave it in place for another few days, or indefinitely, but it does allow him to put off thinking about it, which is acceptable enough. He succeeds in putting Malfoy out of his mind for the rest of the evening. As he crawls into bed, exhausted, he spares him just an idle thought, wondering if Malfoy had managed to rid himself of the red yet, and then he's asleep.</p><p>He can tell even while surfacing from a good night's sleep that it's going to be another beautiful day for flying, which he's quite happy about. He always likes his students to have an even playing field, and he can't teach all of the first-years at once. The promise of a good flying lesson is enough to have him bouncing out of bed and walking in to breakfast with a spring in his step. As he'd vowed the night before, he ignores Malfoy completely and greets McGonagall, maybe a bit too cheerfully from the raised eyebrow he gets in response, but he can't be bothered by that. It's a lovely day.</p><p>The lovely day lasts almost two whole hours before Harry spots a scuffle in the courtyard on his way past. He breaks it up easily just by striding up and frowning. It's a free period for these students, so there are plenty of witnesses. No magic is being used, no wands are out, but it's pretty clear from the blotchy, upset face of the Ravenclaw and the sullen, defiant expression on the Slytherin's that he's started it. Still, neither of them should have been fighting, so it'll be a few points from both Houses.</p><p>"All right, Johnston, I'm taking five points from Slytherin and—"</p><p>And he shivers, and the shiver locks each of his joints, and he nearly knocks the frowning Ravenclaw over as he pitches backward, hitting the stone wall painfully on the way down and feeling his knuckles scrape against the hard-packed ground.</p><p><i>What the fucking hell?</i> he tries to say and realizes with mounting panic that he's only thought it, he can't speak, he can't do <i>anything</i>, he's—</p><p>"Paralyzed," Johnston whispers, eyes wide with horror as the students drop to their knees around him. "Professor, Professor Potter, what's happened? Are you all right? What do we do?" he says in a panicky voice to the Ravenclaw he'd just been sparring with.</p><p>"Hospital wing?" the Ravenclaw—Baldwin?—asks hesitantly, reaching out for Harry's wrist with timid fingers and checking his pulse. "He's alive. And breathing. And stuff. Hospital wing?"</p><p>"How?" Johnston says, his previous sullen expression now drowned in concern.</p><p>"Well, we could carry . . . him . . ." Baldwin—no, Baines, Harry remembers, a second-year who hadn't needed much help with flying—Baines shakes his head at his own suggestion. Harry is much too heavy for three second-years to carry.</p><p><i>Levicorpus</i>, Harry thinks hard at them, but he's not actually sure if they teach that spell to second-years. He'd learned it in third-year, but only because of Hermione.</p><p>They're joined by several more students demanding to know what's happened. As they discuss what to do in hushed voices, Harry can feel sensation starting to return to his fingers and toes. He thrashes, or it feels like he does, but the movements are tiny, hardly there for several seconds. Finally he manages to twitch a hand and the crowd of students falls silent, then begins chattering even louder.</p><p>He shuts them out, concentrating on the sensation of <i>moving</i>, and finally he sits up, and stands up, leaning against the wall for support. He must not look recovered, as the students are still staring and whispering amongst themselves, and he's left wondering what happened when the sea of black robes parts and—</p><p>Of. <i>Course.</i></p><p>That utter, utter Slytherin <i>bastard</i>.</p><p>Harry isn't at all certain of his ability to storm across the courtyard like he wants to, so he restrains himself to a simple beckoning gesture. Malfoy drifts over casually, as if they've an appointment to go over lesson plans together. Harry notes, to his irritation, that there isn't a trace of red left in Malfoy's eyebrows.</p><p>"Hello, Potter." Malfoy has the gall to be pleasant at him? Harry grits his teeth, fighting down his anger, reminding himself that there are still students present and a vicious duel between professors would not be setting them a good example. He'd likely lose anyway, with how shaky he feels. A Full Body-Bind is one of his least favorite things.</p><p>He doesn't mind the dirt, but brushing himself off buys him time to calm down and choose his words carefully. "I know this has something to do with you," he murmurs, keeping an eye on the students, hoping Johnston and Baines aren't blaming themselves for it.</p><p>"I'm flattered," Malfoy says calmly.</p><p>"Malfoy!"</p><p>"Potter?" Malfoy nearly beams at him.</p><p>Harry nearly screams back. "So this is your revenge?" he hisses instead. "Because you think I did something to your eyebrows yesterday?" Which he had, but colored eyebrows and a Full Body-Bind are <i>very different things</i>, thanks very much.</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Malfoy shrugs. "Perhaps someone thought you looked better flat on your back," he adds, lowering his voice, and if that had come from <i>anyone</i> except Malfoy, Harry would assume—but no, it's coming from Malfoy, it's not flirtatious, it's mean-spirited.</p><p>"You think you're funny?" Harry sighs. "You think you're funny. Right." He balls his hands into fists and winces. His knuckles are stinging something <i>awful</i>, and the wounds are filthy. He'll need to go see Poppy about them. Maybe he can make up a story. "Okay. This is not over, Malfoy," he promises.</p><p>Malfoy lifts an infuriatingly blond eyebrow. "I'm terrified." And he turns, he <i>turns his back</i> and walks away.</p><p>Harry fumes, then puts on a bright smile. "Thanks, Professor Malfoy!" he calls after the retreating figure. "It's always nice to talk to you!" <i>Wanker.</i></p><p>The second time it happens, just after lunch, he panics a little bit less and keeps his head a little bit more, and wonders if he should maybe take a break himself from taking away House points, and experiments with the idea that this revenge is justified. The idea doesn't sit well with him, though, and instead he decides that the curse can't last forever. He isn't going to let it change anything. <i>He's</i> just going to carry on as per usual.</p><p>Later that afternoon, when he's lying there staring at another crowd of concerned broom-clutching students and waiting for his muscles to begin responding to his commands again, he takes a moment to reflect that it's actually <i>really</i> difficult to refrain from taking away House points as a quick and easy punishment for small (or large) infractions.</p><p>"I'm fine," he says immediately as soon as the minute is up and he's able to start moving again. "I'm fine. It's nothing to worry about. Just you remember what I've said about talking when you're meant to be listening to me, yeah?"</p><p>That seems to clear most of the concern out of the students' expressions and the flying lesson goes ahead, but he knows he's being watched when he walks through the Entrance Hall on his way to the Gryffindor Quidditch practice.</p><p>The fourth time it happens, he's <i>in midair</i>. He's in the middle of telling off two Slytherin players who have snuck into the stands to watch their practice—which is a <i>completely</i> legitimate and justified reason to take points from Slytherin, but the curse hasn't cared thus far about how justified the points are. He tries to choke back the "ten points each from Slytherin!" but the words escape him enough to activate the curse. Luckily he isn't too far off the ground, and luckily, too, the Gryffindor Seeker has Seeker-like reflexes with spellwork, <i>and</i> he knows <i>Arresto Momentum</i>.</p><p>He wants to give Roger Jenkins about five thousand points for the gentle cushioned landing his Body-Binded body experiences, but he wonders if the curse works both ways and would freeze him up if he dared <i>give</i> points rather than taking them away. By the time the team has been called in and is gathering around him, Harry is already beginning to move again. He's in no mood to hand out reassurances this time. With a curt "Keep practising!" to Roxanne Ainsley, he stalks back toward the castle, not even pausing to pull off the mud-streaked robe.</p><p>He casts a careless <i>Tempus</i> as he storms through the corridors. Just six o'clock, too early for the workaholic to be in his rooms yet. Harry arrives at his office door in a rail of knocking.</p><p>Malfoy's "Come in" is <i>much</i> too calm, and Harry imagines some smugness there, too, as he bursts through the door.</p><p>"How long are you intending to keep this up?" he demands. This, apparently, is enough to prompt Malfoy to <i>deign</i> to look up from his papers. Harry stands, fuming, as Malfoy looks him over. Is he battered enough yet? Should Jenkins have just let him fall? Would a broken arm be sufficient for the bloody sadist?</p><p>"I really don't—"</p><p>"Right," Harry breaks in, "you don't know what I'm talking about. I'd believe you, only . . ." Harry stalks forward, ignoring the squeak of his shoes, savagely pleased that he's likely tracking mud everywhere. "Wait, no, I wouldn't," he continues, folding his arms and ignoring the little voice urging him to keep his head. "Because pretty much everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie."</p><p>A hit, a very palpable hit. Malfoy leans back in his chair, looking as though Harry's words have really reached out and given him a solid blow. "It's interesting that when you pull an idiotic stunt to humiliate me, it's all fun," Malfoy says in a tight voice, "but when you think it's the other way around, the claws come out."</p><p>The way Malfoy is playing with his quill and avoiding Harry's eyes is so reminiscent of their sixth year that for a moment, Harry forgets that it's his turn to speak. "Malfoy . . ." He shakes it off and continues firmly, "I don't know what you're trying to do here but this Body-Bind thing has happened to me three times since lunch. Enough is enough!" <i>I nearly fell from my broom. Remember the last time that happened on the Quidditch pitch? Also your fault, if I recall!</i></p><p>"Whatever happened to your eyebrows," he adds, because he's still petty enough not to own up to that, "I'm pretty sure it was only once!"</p><p>"I wouldn't know," Malfoy says delicately. "I haven't taken any points since then. Maybe you should try that."</p><p><i>What, none at </i>all<i>? Have you learned </i>already<i>?</i> "You mean it wor—erm . . ." Harry nearly chokes on the almost-admission and fights to keep his focus in the face of Malfoy's sudden calm. "The point is, Malfoy . . ." There must be a point somewhere, right? "The point is—are you insane?" he demands, falling back on an old, tired insult.</p><p>The smile Malfoy gives Harry makes him itch between his shoulder blades, as if he's being watched. "It's interesting you should think that," Malfoy says, suddenly conversational, "because I happen to have read that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."</p><p>Harry can feel the embarrassed flush rising to his cheeks—maybe Malfoy will think it's windburn—as he realizes he <i>had</i> thought earlier that perhaps it had worn off. "Never mind that," he says more quietly, tightening both hands into fists to keep himself from lashing out. "Just stop it. Stop it now."</p><p>"Like I said, I have no idea what you're talking about. And I have things to do," Malfoy says, and Harry <i>knows</i> Malfoy is repeating his words back to him on purpose. He manages not to flinch when Malfoy picks up his wand, but he's only opening the door to make it clear as crystal that this interview is over.</p><p>If he stays, Harry knows he's going to do something he'll regret. He stalks toward the door, but comes to a halt just outside it and turns back, unable to let it end there. "Malfoy, if you don't sort this out—"</p><p>"You'll do what?" Malfoy asks mockingly. "Run to McGonagall?" He turns pointedly back to his papers.</p><p>Harry snorts, imagining McGonagall's reaction to this schoolboy feud between two of her professors. "No," he says, and a wicked, hot little voice prompts him to cut at Malfoy with: "But I wonder who she'd believe—you or me?"</p><p>As soon as he says it, he wishes he hadn't. He doesn't really know how Malfoy ended up at Hogwarts, but he's heard that McGonagall had had something to do with it. That might have been a lower blow than he'd meant it to be. When he sees Malfoy's face, he knows that it was. He finds himself stuck between defiantly leaving the words sitting between them, and offering a quiet apology, but his words don't quite seem to cooperate.</p><p>Malfoy beats him to it with a glare. "I can fight my own battles these days, Potter. Maybe you should try the same—it's been a while, hasn't it?"</p><p>Immediately, Harry can hear the voice in his head—<i><b>("You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself . . . to die . . . permitted your friends . . .")</b></i>—and before he can force them away and find some way to react, the door swings shut with enough force that if he'd been a bit closer, he'd be visiting Poppy for a broken nose.</p><p>Harry stands and stares at the door. The words flare up across his imagination, Tom Riddle's spiked and flaming handwriting, and then they go darker, changing into sinuous black ribbons tracing those accusations in elegant cursive. Breathing carefully, Harry imagines his Patronus charging the words themselves, shaking them apart on his antlers. Finally, when they're all gone, driven off by Prongs, he walks away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center><p>Perhaps predictably, Harry sleeps badly. His dreams are blessedly free of a high, amused laugh, or flashes of green light, or any of the horrors that had haunted his dreams when he was younger, but they are still strange, nonsensical, and vaguely unsettling. He wakes earlier than he needs to, and in a foul mood despite the continuing lovely weather. As he stomps and mutters his way through his morning routine, he vows to really avoid Malfoy entirely this time, <i>and</i> to keep ignoring this curse-thing of his. If Harry falls into a Full Body-Bind enough times, McGonagall is sure to notice, and Malfoy will be the one in the way of her wrath. That's the best logic he can summon today.</p><p>He eats breakfast early, hardly noticing what he's putting onto his plate, and leaves the Great Hall before Malfoy appears. He hasn't got anything on his schedule yet, but working with the students always makes him feel better. Later, he'll remember that that's how he'd ended up in the courtyard, explaining to Magnus Humphries why Extensor charms are so useful.</p><p>"It's not something your average wizard uses every day," he is saying as he casts the charm that shimmers in front of him like a film of soap-bubble. "And they can be a bit tricky if you don't concentrate—hey!" he shouts across the courtyard as he sees a flash of spell-light out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Ivy Baron has her wand out and pointed at a group of boys, possibly also Slytherins. Ordinarily, Harry would ask what was going on, but the foul mood resurges and he points at them. "Ten points from Slytheri—" and he chokes on the final "n" as the Extensor charm shimmers more brightly and then pops.</p><p>He can't breathe, for a moment he can't <i>breathe</i>, and he hardly feels the impact with the ground this time. Faces appear above him, horrified, a sight he's beginning to grow used to, and he closes his eyes. He tries to close his eyes. He can't close his eyes. He can feel himself breathing, but when he tries to take a deeper breath, he can't. He tries to twitch a finger and he can't. He can't, he can't, he can't—</p><p><i>Don't panic</i>, he tells himself firmly. <i>It wears off in a minute. And after this, I can visit Malfoy with his own personal Bat-Bogey Hex, that should be a fun memory for him.</i></p><p>"Professor Potter. <i>Professor.</i>" It's Ivy Baron, he knows her voice, but the fall has knocked his glasses aside and he can't move his eyes around to see which of the fast-moving blurs is Ivy. "<i>Enervate,</i>" he hears—ah, there's Ivy; she's the one holding a wand—and he can feel the tingle of the spell wash over him. It doesn't help, but everything is fine.</p><p>Everything is fine even when he's certain that sixty seconds have passed and he still can't twitch even a finger, or take a deep breath, or move his eyes. Everything is fine.</p><p>Everything is still fine when he hears Malfoy's voice at the entrance to the courtyard. "Miss Baron, step aside, please," and Malfoy sounds fairly calm, it's Malfoy's curse and therefore Malfoy can get him out of it.</p><p>He waits expectantly. Malfoy casts the counter-curse. Then Malfoy casts it again.</p><p>Harry hears, "How long has he been like this?" and suddenly <i>everything is not fine, nothing is fine, he can't move, he can't blink, he can't </i>breathe on his own—</p><p>"About five minutes," and there's a note of panic in Ivy's voice that cuts through Harry's own panic like cold water across his face. With a supreme effort, he digs in his fingers and drags himself up and out of the pit his panic has dropped him into. He's still not moving—he can feel the ground against his back and the steady in-and-out of his breath—but his fingers hit smooth, cool glass. It's a goldfish bowl, and he's at the bottom of it, surrounded by students staring down. Bizarre.</p><p>He can't see himself, but he can see the students clustered in a tight circle around him, Malfoy towering over him with his wand out—unnerving sight, that—and questioning red-haired Ivy Baron, who looks petrified, as if this is her doing. Harry presses his palms against the glass, staring up, feeling weirdly exposed as Malfoy asks, "What did you do?"</p><p>The story comes out—Ivy had been trying to protect her sister, not curse anyone—and Harry feels instantly bad for jumping to conclusions about who had cast what. It wouldn't have happened that way if he'd been in a better mood, but Malfoy has got inside his head and mixed things up so now <i>Harry's</i> the one shouting at students without reason and <i>Malfoy's</i> the one asking patient questions to find out what's happened.</p><p>"What's wrong with him?" asks a student Harry can't see. Malfoy doesn't answer and Harry slams his palms against the cold glass.</p><p>"<i>Yeah, tell them, Malfoy! Tell them what's wrong with me!</i>" he yells up at the faces. "<i>Tell them what you've done to me, why don't you!</i>" He unleashes a shower of profanity that isn't overheard by the students and doesn't make him feel any better.</p><p>When it runs out, he stares up at Malfoy staring down at him. Malfoy looks afraid. Why does Malfoy look afraid? "<i>What's wrong with me?</i>" he asks in something closer to a whisper.</p><p>Malfoy doesn't answer—obviously he wouldn't; he can't hear Harry, no one can hear Harry—but Harry can see a relieved expression blossom on his face when the students part and Poppy crouches next to him.</p><p>"<i>Hi, Poppy,</i>" he says, even though she can't hear him, but he's just relieved to see her. She'll be able to help. He's sure she's seen this before, obviously. She's seen every daft thing students have done to each other. This is <i>nothing.</i></p><p>Harry sits cross-legged on the floor of his goldfish bowl and watches the lights from the spellwork reflect off the glass. He'll be able to move again any minute. Obviously.</p><p>Poppy's expression of concentration only deepens. Harry frowns, and he stands up again when she turns away and back to Malfoy. "Professor Malfoy, perhaps you'll help me get him up to the hospital wing?"</p><p>"<i>But—what? Why? What's wrong? </i>You<i> can put me right, Poppy,</i>" Harry protests, then stumbles back as his body is levitated and begins moving. It's disorienting. He's unable to ground himself, and he feels faintly sick, though whether that's from the movement or from the realization beginning to unfold itself in his stomach, he doesn't know.</p><p>Maybe she just needs a potion to do it, Harry rationalizes as he sits with his back against the glass and watches the slow progression of the stone arches, filled with sky and bracketed by pillars. Sky, pillar, sky, pillar. Not everything can be solved by magic alone. Sky, pillar, sky, pillar. Glass-filled window with milky sunlight filtering through.</p><p>He can half-see Malfoy's face, staring straight ahead, looking forbidding. He can hear the clicking of heels on stone and wonders why he hadn't realized Poppy wore heels before another face bobs into his view and quickly disappears again. Ivy Baron. Why is she coming with them? He's missed it.</p><p>As Harry is floated into the hospital wing—dark oak door frame, ornate stone ceiling he remembers from the night he'd had his bones grown back in second year—he hears a whispered "Shut up, Potter" and he starts so hard he nearly knocks his head on the glass.</p><p>"<i>Malfoy? Can you hear me? Wait, how could you, I didn't say anything. What the hell do you mean, 'Shut up, Potter'? I can't be more shut up than I am, thanks to you, Malfoy! Stupid . . . git,</i>" Harry trails off. He wraps his arms around his knees as they set him down on a bed. It's chilly in the hospital wing, much cooler than it had been outside.</p><p>Malfoy is dictating orders to Ivy Baron, sounding pinched and cross, and Harry rolls his eyes when Malfoy asks if she understands. "<i>Of course she </i>understands<i>, Malfoy, she isn't an idiotic git like some people.</i>" He watches Ivy as she relates the story to Poppy, noticing the way the normally-outgoing girl keeps her eyes down. "<i>You're even like this to Slytherins?</i>" Harry asks, shaking his head. "<i>Bloody unpleasant in general, aren't you? Some things never change.</i>"</p><p>Except in school, the Slytherins had actually <i>liked</i> Malfoy. That's changed, it seems, if Ivy's anything to go by. Harry is musing on that when he hears his name again and looks up.</p><p>"—stay with Professor Potter while I run a few tests?"</p><p>"<i>God, I hope not,</i>" Harry says fervently, staring up at the two of them, Malfoy's startled face and Poppy's shrewd, calm stare.</p><p>"Er," Malfoy says, "I'd better not. I have a class starting in . . ." Harry tips his head as he hears the bell. He's late for something too, but he supposes he's got a fairly solid excuse. Black humor, he thinks. He may as well embrace it. "Well, there's the bell," Malfoy continues, backing away from the bed as if Harry is contagious. "I wouldn't want to be late! Sets a terrible example, you see, and I must . . ." Malfoy's voice trails away as the doors close behind him.</p><p>"<i>Good!</i>" Harry shouts after him. "<i>Wouldn't want to miss inflicting yourself on your students, they might forget to hate you for a day!</i>"</p><p>Harry slumps back against the curved wall of the goldfish bowl and stares at nothing in particular as Poppy sighs and smiles at Ivy. "Well, Miss Baron, it's just you and me."</p><p>"But Professor Malfoy said I should go back to class," Ivy says uncertainly, looking down at Harry.</p><p>"You certainly may if you wish," Poppy says briskly as she moves away from Harry's sight. He can hear bottles clattering in the background. "I will write you a note to excuse you for being late. But Professor Potter may be grateful for the company. You are a member of the Duelling Club, I believe?"</p><p>"I, er, yes, I am," Ivy says with a bit more confidence. Harry can hear the scrape of wood and then Ivy reappears, perched on a chair next to the bed.</p><p>"I was a part of the Duelling Club when I was a girl." Harry snorts with laughter at Ivy's startled expression. She must be trying to imagine <i>Madam Pomfrey</i> as a <i>student</i>. It's difficult for Harry as well, but then, Poppy looks exactly as she'd looked when Harry had been twelve. "I spent much of my time there repairing the damage done," Poppy continues wryly. "But it did spark my interest in healing spells. I'm glad to see the Club has been resurrected. Doing well, I hope?"</p><p>"Um, yes, fairly well," says Ivy, tucking her red hair behind her ear. "Thank you," she adds automatically.</p><p>"You're quite welcome." Poppy takes a sample of Harry's hair, for some reason, and waves her wand, causing a few other colors to bloom. Then she removes Harry's glasses, which makes him apprehensive at first until she whispers a spell that makes Harry's watering eyes fairly gush. It's a really uncomfortable sensation, and he can feel tears running down his cheeks as well, but the reason for it becomes instantly clear. The last thing Harry sees is her hand gently covering his eyes to close the lids.</p><p>"<i>Bless you, Poppy,</i>" he sighs and scrubs at his streaming eyes in his imagination as he feels a soft cloth dabbing at his cheeks, wiping away the excess tears.</p><p>"There, Harry, you'll be much more comfortable now." Harry can't see her anymore, obviously, but it's rude not to look at people when they're talking to you. He imagines her and she appears immediately, just as he'd seen her moments ago. Her familiar patient smile is backed by the ornate ceiling above her, and Harry smiles back.</p><p>"Now," the imagined Poppy says, "I have one or two tests to run." She's talking to Ivy now, and the Poppy straightens up and addresses her impromptu assistant. "They won't take long, but if you could keep Professor Potter company while I'm gone, I'm sure he'd be grateful. And if anything changes, please come and find me right away, all right?"</p><p>"Yes, Madam Pomfrey, all right," Ivy says, and Harry pictures her sitting straighter with that determined jut to her chin that she gets when she's trying to master a challenging spell. Poppy's right, Harry thinks. He does feel better having someone familiar nearby, especially now that he can't see.</p><p>Poppy's footsteps fade and a door closes in the distance. He hears Ivy heave a sigh. "I really don't know what happened," she stage-whispers, quickly, as if trying to get the words out before they're overheard. "I'm sorry, Professor. I wish I could help."</p><p>"<i>You're doing fine, Ivy,</i>" Harry says and imagines himself sitting up in bed, the better to talk to her.</p><p>His imagined Ivy looks very small and young for her fifteen years. "You look sort of alarming like this," she admits. "You look sort of . . ."</p><p>"<i>Sort of dead? Yeah, it's not the first time,</i>" Harry says with a shrug.</p><p>Ivy is silent for several seconds. Harry hopes she doesn't feel guilty, that she isn't missing a class she'll have trouble making up, that she doesn't feel strange sitting here keeping her frozen, motionless professor company. "Are you cold?" Ivy asks and hops off her chair. Her heels clatter around the bed and Harry wonders what she's doing until a heavy, warm weight settles on him and he realizes she's drawn a blanket up to cover him.</p><p>"<i>Thanks, Ivy.</i>" Harry imagines a blanket of his own, soft and warm, Gryffindor red and gold—knitted, like something Mrs. Weasley might have made if she'd ever done blankets one year for Christmas—and wraps it around his shoulders. It's dark now that his eyes are closed, and he stares through the glass into the darkness, wondering what's out there, and how long he'll be like this.</p><p>"Magnus and I have been talking," Ivy says, breaking the silence, "and we think we've a better way of letting the younger students practice some of the more challenging spells in Duelling. We don't want them to be hurt, and I think they're nervous of accidentally hurting someone else, but I was thinking about what you'd told us about Dumbledore's Army back when you were a student, and I think we could make some of those wizarding dummies."</p><p>Ivy describes her idea, that she and Magnus will work with a few of the older students who are good in Charms and Transfiguration to construct a few wooden dummies that the younger students will be able to "blast away at" without worrying about something going terribly wrong. Harry sits back against the glass and lets her words wash over him, occasionally nodding, reassured that he wouldn't have much more to say about it even if he could talk. It's a good idea, and it sounds like Ivy has thought it through. He wishes he could help with it, of course, but Ivy might not need the help.</p><p>Ivy talks until the distant door reopens, then cuts off mid-sentence as Poppy's footsteps approach the bed. "Did you cover him up?" Poppy asks.</p><p>"I, er, yes. I wasn't sure if he was cold, but I thought it might not hurt," Ivy says.</p><p>"It was very considerate," she says. Harry can see Poppy's smile in her voice. "What did you two talk about?"</p><p>Some coil of tension loosens itself in the vicinity of Harry's stomach. Trust Poppy to treat him normally and act as though he and Ivy had had a conversation.</p><p>"I was telling Professor Potter about mine and Magnus's idea for Duelling Club," Ivy says. He hears her hop off the chair, and then it scrapes against the stone as she drags it out of the way. "We'd like to make some mannequins or dummies to practice on, so the younger students can try some more difficult things without worrying about cursing someone."</p><p>"That's an excellent idea," Poppy says approvingly and Harry nods in agreement. "I'm sure he agrees." She sets a hand on his forehead, then presses her fingers against his cheek and takes his temperature with a whispered spell.</p><p>"<i>Best send Ivy back to class soon,</i>" Harry says.</p><p>"Thank you, Miss Baron. Here is your note. I must ask you not to discuss Professor Potter's condition," Poppy says briskly.</p><p>"No, Madam Pomfrey, I won't." He imagines Ivy shaking her head firmly. "Er . . . Professor Potter can hear us, can't he?"</p><p>"<i>Every last word, even better than I can hear you and Magnus whispering during lessons,</i>" Harry says, examining this blanket that his imagination has conjured up for him. It's surprisingly detailed, warm and soft, with little imperfections in the wool and the stitching. For a moment, he really can't remember whether or not Mrs. Weasley had knitted him a blanket with a Gryffindor lion on it one year instead of a jumper. Maybe he'll ask her for one when he's better.</p><p>"I believe he can," Poppy is saying when he looks up again. "Talking to him is one of the best things we can do. You did quite well, Miss Baron. Now, off you go."</p><p>"Thanks, Madam Pomfrey." Her heels clack toward the door and he hears it creak open before Ivy stops. "I'll, that is, could I come back and visit?"</p><p>Poppy hesitates, he can <i>see</i> her hesitating, before she says, "We'll see. I hope Mr. Potter will not be here long enough to need a visit."</p><p>Apparently satisfied with that answer, Ivy must depart without saying anything else, as Harry hears the heavy door close. "<i>I will be, though, won't I?</i>" he asks the imagined figure of Poppy, standing in the middle of the imagined hospital wing with a worried frown on her imagined face. "<i>I will be here long enough to need a visit.</i>"</p><p>"Well now, Harry," Poppy says, setting a hand on his forehead again, but maybe just to give him a bit of comfort this time, as she leaves it there longer than she needs to for simply checking his temperature. "We'll do what we can to make you comfortable. Minerva is on her way down. She insisted on seeing you herself. I hope you don't mind."</p><p>"<i>I don't mind,</i>" Harry says, picking at a loose thread on his blanket, unraveling it enough to get some string to play with. It's not really one of Mrs. Weasley's gifts, so it's all right to do that. "<i>Let her know whose fault it is. Let her know she can tell people the truth if they ask. So can Ivy. They should tell the truth. They should tell </i>everyone!"</p><p>Harry yanks savagely on the thread and the entire blanket unravels into a pile of red and gold. Harry glares at it until it sinks slowly down through the bottom of the bowl and the glass closes over it again, viscous like syrup. He stares and then stands up slowly. "<i>I don't want to be here anymore,</i>" he says aloud.</p><p>There is no answer, and he puts a hand against the glass. "<i>I want to be somewhere else.</i>" But there's no point in saying that without having somewhere else in mind, is there? He wonders what time it is, automatically casts <i>Tempus</i> to find out, then scowls at the floating, blinking <i>87:70</i> and banishes it. Of course it wouldn't work. It's not real magic. It's just his imagination. That's no help at all.</p><p>No, he thinks, he can work this out. It had been morning, just after breakfast when he'd been helping Magnus, and not much time could have passed since then. Probably. So it's likely late morning, maybe lunchtime—and the Great Hall materializes around the outside of the bowl, wavery through the glass.</p><p>"<i>Weird,</i>" he murmurs and presses a little harder on the glass, experimentally. His hand sinks into it with a cool, slick sensation, and he shivers and closes his eyes and presses his way through the glass. He's clean when he opens his eyes, no trace of the syrupy glass on him, and it's gone when he turns around. "<i>Huh. Well, that was pretty easy,</i>" he says, mood lifting a bit as he walks toward the High Table. Everyone is dressed in their winter robes and there is snow falling outside the windows, big thick flakes gathering on the panes. The chatter he hears from the tables is mostly speculation on the outcome of the Quidditch match that afternoon, and Harry realizes this is November, two years ago, that day Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had played in an almost impenetrable blizzard. It's like walking through one of his memories.</p><p>It <i>is</i> walking through one of his memories.</p><p>Harry stops in the middle of the Hall and two second-years dodge him as he stands transfixed beneath the weight of that realization. He can walk through his <i>memories.</i></p><p><i>Think about Diagon Alley,</i> he begs himself. <i>Think about coaching Quidditch. Think about the World Cup—the beginning bit, the match, not the other stuff. Think about—</i></p><p>But either he isn't fast enough or the memories of darker times are just too strong to be shouldered aside, because the fires flicker out of the Great Hall, the windows burst and shatter inward to the sound of students screaming—</p><p>The sound of the hospital wing doors opening is enough to slam Harry out of the old memory. The ruined Great Hall vanishes like a light has been switched off and he focuses desperately on Minerva's hurried footsteps to keep it that way. "Poppy, is he—oh, <i>Harry.</i> Dear boy."</p><p>"<i>I'm thirty-two, you know,</i>" Harry says weakly, more grateful than he can say for the anchoring hand McGonagall sets on his forehead. He knows he'll always be <i>dear boy</i> to several people, and she's one of them. He doesn't mind, at least not right now.</p><p>McGonagall's hand disappears from his forehead, but Harry hears the scrape of the chair, and then her hand returns to press against his shoulder. "Poppy, what on earth <i>happened?</i>"</p><p>Harry listens with half an ear as Poppy runs through the story again, noting that she gives the Headmistress the names of all four students involved as well as Malfoy, but he's concentrating on creating an imaginary McGonagall. He's already discovering that it's much easier to focus on the conversation when he has someone to focus on.</p><p>That and the unsettling darkness pressing against his eyelids is getting harder to ignore, and he needs to put something there before his subconscious decides to populate it without his input.</p><p>Although he sees her several times a week, Harry still imagines Minerva McGonagall as the imposing, skeptical figure in emerald green who had towered over the crowd of first-years and explained about the Sorting. He's grown since then, but he still puts her in that same set of green robes, and her matching hat, but it comes with a forbidding expression he remembers her directing at Neville when he'd misplaced Trevor. No hat, then, he decides, and feels instantly better when he's got rid of it.</p><p>"But what do you believe has caused this?" McGonagall is asking Poppy and Harry pauses in recreating her Transfiguration classroom to put her in. He's got a few theories, and of course he knows about Malfoy's part in it, but he doesn't really know <i>why</i> this has happened.</p><p>"Well, when the Healer from St. Mungo's arrives, we'll have a more definite answer," Poppy says, but clearly McGonagall is giving her one of those skeptical looks because she continues, "Ivy mentioned Harry helping Magnus Humphries with an Extensor Charm."</p><p>"Yes, but Magnus Humphries isn't the type to cast anything on a <i>teacher,</i>" McGonagall points out. "Even accidentally."</p><p>"And Harry wouldn't have cast a Full-Body Bind on <i>himself,</i>" Poppy says, and Harry can see her firm, certain nod. "He's far too sensible for that. But then where did it come from, and why has it been affected by an Extensor Charm that Harry himself had cast?" she muses.</p><p>Both women fall silent and Harry imagines them sitting, a little dejected, watching him and wondering. "<i>The curse Malfoy put on me got tangled in the Extensor Charm when I tried to take points from Slytherin,</i>" Harry says, entirely unhelpfully as neither woman can hear him. "<i>Go and quiz him on it.</i>"</p><p>The silence continues, so Harry goes back to building McGonagall's Transfiguration classroom. Then he goes back to the Great Hall and starts fixing that up. By the time he's finished with the sky-reflecting ceiling, he's decided to go ahead and rebuild the rest of the castle in his mind's eye. It will give him something to do until the healer from St. Mungo's arrives and puts him right, anyway.</p><p>Not much had changed at Hogwarts since he'd been there as a student, even taking the Battle of Hogwarts into account. Professors, past and present, had come together and made a concerted effort to restore the ancient castle to its former glory, nearly untouched by the conflict save for a black onyx paving stone in the courtyard where Voldemort had finally, finally died.</p><p>Harry meanders through corridors recreated in his imagination, rearranges the staircases with a furrow of concentration, and hangs portrait frames on the walls, filling them with the painted figures he remembers. After a while—he isn't certain how long, and his <i>Tempus</i> still comes up as gibberish—he leaves the rest of the frames empty and walks the long, familiar route up to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>"<i>G'morning,</i>" he greets the painting of the Fat Lady, still presiding over Gryffindor Tower after this long.</p><p>"<i>Hello, dear,</i>" she replies absently. "<i>Password?</i>"</p><p>Harry thinks for a moment. It's up to him now, isn't it? This is all up to him. Or is it up to her? "<i>Dunno,</i>" he says. He thinks himself up a spindly chair and sits backward on it, crossing his arms over the back. "<i>What do you think would make a good one?</i>"</p><p>The Fat Lady blinks down at him, surprised, and snaps her fan closed. "<i>Well, I'm sure </i>I<i> don't know,</i>" she demurs.</p><p>"<i>I bet you know loads of brilliant ones.</i>" Harry grins as she flutters the fan coquettishly in front of her face. "<i>We've never really chatted before now.</i>"</p><p>But because they'd never really chatted before now, the Fat Lady in Harry's imagination doesn't do much more than smile and flutter her fan at him. "<i>Caput draconis,</i>" Harry says at last, just to pick something. Maybe he'll work his way through all the passwords he can remember during his school days.</p><p>The portrait swings forward and Harry absently carries the spindly chair into the Gryffindor Common Room. This, he changes to reflect his first year, all deep red walls and velvet drapery edged in real gold, with worn red armchairs pulled up to the fire. He climbs into one of them—it's oversized, as if he hasn't grown at all since he was eleven—and stares at the leaping flames.</p><p>He can't hear anything from the ward. McGonagall has gone, maybe slipped out while he was building walls or painting portraits, and he doesn't think Poppy is there either. He'd known it would happen: he has nothing on the outside to occupy his mind. But Harry isn't ready to grow introspective yet. "<i>Something will fix it,</i>" he tells the fire. "<i>They've already called a Healer. They can put me right. Can't be anything they've not seen before.</i>"</p><p>The fire doesn't answer. Harry doesn't blame it. It's not the fire's responsibility to keep him from going completely mad before the Healer arrives and fixes him up.</p><p>"Here we are, Harry." Poppy's voice startles him, but not as much as it startles him when she wraps an arm around his shoulders and pulls him, carefully but steadily, into a sitting position. "You may be here for some time," she continues cheerfully as her deft hands begin unlacing his flying robes, "so we'll make you a great deal more comfortable. I have some lovely pajamas for you, in a nice light blue."</p><p>"<i>Er. Thanks,</i>" Harry says, awkward despite Poppy's cheerful demeanor and fast, practiced movements. He can't really remember a time he'd needed help dressing himself. Aunt Petunia had left him to dress himself almost as soon as he'd managed to balance on two legs, and although he'd spent a lot of time in the hospital wing, he'd never been <i>completely</i> helpless before.</p><p>"<i>I don't much care for it,</i>" he mutters, picking at a loose gold thread in the armchair's embroidery. "<i>Bloody Malfoy.</i>" Bloody, bloody Malfoy. And it doesn't make Harry feel any better to know that technically, Harry had started it.</p><p>It doesn't take Poppy long to finish, and Harry is grateful for the running commentary and idle chatter she keeps up during the whole process. The pajamas are lighter than his robes, much better for lying completely still in, and he can feel more of the air through them. She's right; he does feel more comfortable.</p><p>Harry is dozing when the sound of a bottle hitting the floor shatters through his mind and breaks apart the warm, comfortable Common Room. Harry grips the arms of his oversized chair until his knuckles go white as blackness leaks in like ink running over the red and gold and crackling in the fire until Harry is left with his armchair, staring up blindly into the darkness.</p><p>"<i>What time is it?</i>" he blurts, forgetting for a moment that he won't get any answer that makes sense.</p><p>A scraping sound backed by muttering might be broken glass being swept off stone floors, and a whispered <i>Evanesco</i> is the spilled potion being cleaned up. Poppy is out there again. Is she looking after a different student, or doing something else for him? Is she just doing her rounds, keeping things spotless as always?</p><p>Unbidden, a vision of the hospital wing blurs into view, dark and flooded with moonlight, though Harry doesn't know if it's late enough for moonlight. He doesn't want to leave the safety of the armchair, but there are a few details that aren't quite right, and he does want to fix that. Harry sits perched on the edge of the cushion, torn between getting up and moving closer so he can refine the imagined room, or staying where he is in the (probably false, honestly) hope that the chair won't suddenly change under him.</p><p>He hears squeaky footsteps—Poppy's, he knows them already—drawing closer to his bed. "Good afternoon," she says briskly, which prompts the moonlight to turn into golden sunlight as if a switch has been flipped. Harry's almost sure she isn't talking to him. She doesn't sound nearly so relaxed.</p><p>"Why have you closed his eyes?" asks Harry's least favorite person in the world. A version of him shimmers unbidden into existence, and Harry's sudden surge of anger shifts the afternoon sunlight to the deep glow of a vivid sunset before a storm rolls in. It washes the stone red, along with Malfoy's pale skin and hair, but it doesn't keep the imagined Malfoy from staring at him as he adds, "He's not dead."</p><p>"<i>Yeah, still not dead,</i>" Harry growls, echoed by thunder only he can hear, as he shoves himself out of the armchair and stalks around the tall simulacrum. "<i>Bit of a disappointment, is it? After this long, you could've been shot of me, but you've botched it up, haven't you?</i>"</p><p>Even as he says it, he knows it isn't fair, because it isn't true, but he doesn't care. Harry waves a hand in front of the Malfoy's face. It doesn't react. Feeling oddly like a ghost in his own mind, Harry withdraws a few paces and listens to Poppy.</p><p>". . . can't blink, Professor Malfoy. I closed his eyes to stop them getting dry and sore."</p><p>"<i>Bless you for it, Poppy,</i>" Harry says absently, still watching the unmoving figure of Malfoy, bathed in too-red sunlight. It washes out what little color he has. He looks like a statue, or like he's been Petrified. Weird juxtaposition of the two of them.</p><p>"The eyes aren't usually affected by <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>, but this is a rather unusual case," Poppy continues, and now her voice sounds a bit more like the tone she uses when she speaks to Harry.</p><p>It takes Malfoy a long time to answer, and when he finally does, his "Yes, I suppose it is" is so oddly <i>subdued</i> that Harry wishes, for the first time since this started, that he could actually see Malfoy's face. Maybe figure out why he sounds so unlike himself.</p><p><i>That urge will pass</i>, Harry tells himself.</p><p>He doesn't hear footsteps throughout Poppy's potion-administering process—which just feels a completely different type of <i>weird</i>, as the potion pours into his mouth and into his stomach without his having to swallow, as if he's just a chute—and he occupies himself thinking how weird Malfoy is for staying to watch, because it's easier than wondering <i>why</i> Malfoy had stayed to watch. Finally, after Poppy has walked away, he hears Malfoy shuffling for the door. The imagined simulacrum walks away too, shoulders set tight and tense, bent a little against the dark red sunlight as if it has a weight to it.</p><p>"Good evening, Potter." It's curt and unexpected, and Harry gapes and doesn't think to answer until the oak doors close. The heavy sound leaves Harry feeling oddly unbalanced, because even though Malfoy wouldn't have known whether or not Harry answered, Harry hadn't.</p><p>"<i>'Night, Malfoy,</i>" he says anyway, and feels a little better, and feels annoyed about it, and storms off to build a Quidditch pitch.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>Harry is finally getting round to reorganizing the broomshed. He'd managed to recreate it exactly, right down to the frankly horrifying mess. It's something of an indication of just how long it's <i>been</i> a frankly horrifying mess, that he remembers it so well. Though it's only in his mind and the real broomshed will look just the same when he sees it again (he'll see it again, the Healer from St. Mungo's will put him right), he feels a sense of accomplishment as he moves the stacks of brooms around and cleans behind them. An unfamiliar voice makes him pause with an obstinate broom twitching in his hand, and he sets it down and steps outside, not onto the Quidditch pitch he'd mapped out but back into the goldfish bowl that seems to show up whenever he's being watched.<p>". . . no professors there when it happened, but we've pieced it together," Poppy is saying as her footsteps draw closer.</p><p>"I see he's been well looked after," says the voice Harry doesn't know. Presumably this is the Healer. Harry has absolutely nothing to go on, but he begins imagining a version of him. The voice is deep and solid, Irish, he thinks, and the outline starts to take shape: tall, a little broad, around fifty years old.</p><p>"Good morning, Professor Potter," the Healer says. "My name is Healer Talbot and I'll be looking to see if we can fix up this little trouble of yours."</p><p>"<i>'Morning, Healer Talbot,</i>" Harry answers, and feels a little better that the Healer's speaking to him as though he's an ordinary patient who can answer his questions, the same way Poppy has been. Maybe that's something all Healers learn how to do. He gives Healer Talbot glasses—he's often wished more people in the wizarding world wore glasses—and gray eyes, tired but kind, behind them, as Professor McGonagall begins supplying the answers Harry cannot give.</p><p>As Healer Talbot asks his questions, a few of which seem quite a bit off-topic to Harry, a finger gently lifts his eyelid. Harry yelps as the fish bowl floods with a light that clings to the sides, sticky like glowing custard. He can't see anything at all as it melts away into dark spots of afterimage, but as he crouches against the glass with his face buried fruitlessly in his arms, he congratulates himself on his guesswork: Healer Talbot does indeed have glasses.</p><p>He almost misses the light moving away and careful hands lowering his eyelids again, but he lifts his head as the Healer's hands dab away the few tears that had reflexively welled at the intrusion of the light. "I admit, I wish it were something a bit more complicated." Harry goes cold at the tone of regret beneath the cool, even, professional voice. "If it were a curse, we might have a place or two we could begin unravelling it, but here and now it's just two spells doing their jobs. There's nothing more we can do but wait for the effects to dissipate. I'm sorry, Mr. Potter."</p><p>"<i>What do you mean, there's nothing more you can do?</i>" He can hear the wooden chair scrape back. He can hear the Healer's heavy footsteps moving away. He can hear talk of keeping St. Mungo's informed, a few comments about care. "<i>Wait! </i>Hey!" he shouts, pounding on the glass with both fists as the <i>crack</i> of Disapparition echoes through his mind, lasting far longer than it should have done. "<i>You can't just leave me like this! How long will it last? I will get better, won't I?</i>"</p><p>The glass is smooth against his flat palms. He can feel it, but he knows it isn't real. It's just the memory of what glass feels like. The chill seeps into his skin like the glass has been made cold from rain streaming down the outside, and now there is rain painting trails down the outside of the glass. It's Privet Drive out there now, but inside the fishbowl, everything is dark.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>He is, yes, sulking in a corner when the hospital wing door opens again. He does not care who it is. He is busy sitting on an unending dull linoleum floor that disappears into the darkness yards or miles away from him, and he is feeling sorry for himself, and he does <i>not</i> care.<p>"You again?" Poppy sounds shocked, and for the barest moment a flare of hope kindles in Harry's chest. Is it Healer Talbot again? Has he—</p><p>"Yes. I was wondering—"</p><p>"<i>Oh, </i>push off<i>, Malfoy!</i>" Harry shouts, suddenly furious, suddenly drenched with a sheet of thunderous rain as he shoots to his feet and stalks through the glass into the hospital wing in his mind, populated now by Poppy and a slump-shouldered Malfoy staring off into space. "<i>No one bloody cares what you were wondering!</i>"</p><p>"—Healer from St. Mungo's."</p><p>The torrential downpour slackens to a steady, miserable rain, soaking the bed linens and plastering Malfoy's hair to his forehead as he stares at the wall and not at Harry, never at Harry.</p><p>"<i>Oh, you would. Like to get the details on just what it is you've done to me? Keep you warm at night, will they?</i>" Harry snarls at him as Poppy explains that the Healer had already left. He shoves at the simulacrum, which staggers back a few steps, then slowly returns to its original pose, shoulders slightly hunched, head ducked and turned to the side. It doesn't make Harry feel any better.</p><p>He stands, fists balled, as the rain slackens and dissipates and dry patches appear on the marble floor everywhere except around him. He can't quite make out what Poppy is saying as she adjusts his sheets for him, but the sensation causes billowing fabric to drop from the ceiling. He and the unmoving mannequin Malfoy are alone then, in a world of white linen and the hot smell of despair.</p><p>"Professor Malfoy, are you listening to me?"</p><p>Slowly, Harry reaches out an arm to brush aside the linen curtains. They cling to his damp skin like bandages, or like a shroud, and Harry panics and—typically—runs straight through them, ripping them, shredding them with a shout that leaves him in a glowing burst. He thinks he hears distant hoofbeats meeting up with his shout as it travels farther and farther away.</p><p>"I think you ought to sit down."</p><p>"No, I'm fine, really. I just—"</p><p>"Sit. Now."</p><p>"<i>Can't fight her when she's got that tone,</i>" Harry says as his running stride comes to a stumbling, disjointed halt. He's back in the hospital wing. The water is gone, the linen—</p><p>
  <b>{—the shrouds, your shroud, white and silent and peacefu—}</b>
</p><p>—is gone, and a squeak of bedsprings makes Harry look over. Malfoy is sitting on a bed. Other than the posture, there is no change in him, still expressionless, still staring. It looks like him, anyone would know who it was meant to be, but it looks like a copy, and Harry remembers suddenly about Dudley telling him—one of the only conversations they'd had after Harry had left for Hogwarts—about Madame Tussaud's museum of waxwork statues: <i>"An' they had all sorts there, an' they looked, y'know, almost real, like they'd start talking, right, on'y they never would, coz they're only wax an' all."</i></p><p>"I'm fine," Harry hears, only it's muffled, and he smiles despite everything when he hears Poppy's forbidding "Shush" and silence descends.</p><p>"<i>What's the matter, anyway?</i>" he asks the waxwork Malfoy, perching on the next bed over and folding his legs under him. "<i>Don't tell me you're coming down with something. I don't want you stuck in here with me.</i>"</p><p>"Well, Professor, it seems you are quite all right after all," Poppy says after almost a minute of silence.</p><p>"I did say that."</p><p>"Yes, well, your pulse is rather fast and you did turn a terrible shade of grey," and Harry nearly chokes as the Malfoy across from him turns grey and mottled and rotted.</p><p>"<i>She didn't say he looked like a </i>zombie<i>! Bloody hell!</i>" Harry growls at his subconscious and waves his hands a bit frantically at the Malfoy-zombie, trying to return him to some semblance of life. While he's at it, he tries to remember what Malfoy looks like when he's more animated; it's off-putting to stare at a waxwork with less expression than the man himself.</p><p>"Young man!"</p><p>"<i>Sorry, but it's a bit weird, isn't it?</i>" Harry begins before Malfoy's incredulous "Young man?" interrupts him and he realizes three things in quick succession: firstly, Poppy can't possibly be talking to him; secondly, Poppy has just called Professor Draco Malfoy "young man" to his face; and thirdly, Harry has missed it. "<i>Of all the facial expressions to miss out on,</i>" he groans. "<i>Just when I'm trying to imagine him up properly.</i>" Of course, he reasons as he goes back to listening to the conversation with half an ear, whatever brilliantly confused expression had appeared on Malfoy's face, it wouldn't have contributed to imagining him properly. Malfoy never looked confused, or bewildered, or anything but bloody, bloody arrogant.</p><p>"I'm fine!" Malfoy almost shouts, and the simulacrum still doesn't look at him, but it does draw its (blond, not red) brows together and tilts its chin in a way that prompts an automatic stab of annoyance. Harry finds it oddly soothing.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>"<i>Pull the other one.</i>"</p><p>"I didn't mean to alarm you, but I can’t help feeling it’s understandable to have some sort of reaction to the news that you are responsible for the permanent paralysis of the most popular man in the wizarding world." Harry can <i>see</i> the twist of Malfoy's lips as he nearly spits the words.</p><p>"What on earth are you talking about, permanent paralysis?" Poppy asks, and "<i>What on earth are you talking about, most popular man in the wizarding world?</i>" Harry asks, and he suspects he and Poppy have nearly identical expressions. "<i>It's been years. Fairly certain the new Keeper for England is more popular by several leagues, if the talk I hear in the corridors is anything to go by.</i>" But then he shuts up, because Poppy is explaining, and truth be told, he hadn't been in much condition to pay attention before.</p><p>He can hear Malfoy breathing, sharp and ragged, louder than it ought to be, and he realizes Malfoy has <i>started</i> breathing again. "<i>Were you worried?</i>" he asks, genuinely surprised.</p><p>"I haven't killed him."</p><p>Harry is too startled by the barefaced relief in Malfoy's voice to do anything but sit again on the hospital bed as Poppy answers, "No. I think he's made of sterner stuff than that, don't you?"</p><p>"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised."</p><p>"<i>Yeah, s'pose I've build up immunity to death by now</i>," Harry says and immediately regrets it as the sky outside the hospital wing windows goes black and begins to drip in over the low sills, running across the floor like oil. There is a sheen to it that sickens Harry. Somehow, he knows it isn't just coating the marble. It's deep.</p><p>He lifts his feet up away from the shiny black, feeling his stomach pull as it ripples and separates into ribbons, coiling like snakes. Snakes would be better. His eyes don't leave them as he listens to Poppy talk about the strength of the curses—probably very bloody strong, he thinks, he and Malfoy were both good at curses—and then she says, "He said we should talk to him."</p><p>"<i>Did he?</i>" Harry crawls along the narrow bed, the floor beneath almost lost under a roiling tide of slithering black ribbons.</p><p>“To Professor Potter—to Harry." Harry's hands are wrapped white-knuckled against the metal bed frame. He stares upward, keeping his eyes off the floor, closing his ears to the whispers scraping just on the edge of hearing. "Listening is about the only thing he can do for the time being, and it’s as good a distraction as any," Poppy continues.</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"<i>Right</i>," Harry echoes. He can hear the bed shift as Malfoy rises, and he can make out the particular scrape of his shoes against the floor. As his imagined Malfoy stands and walks, the ribbons bend out of their way to avoid his steps. He leaves a trail of clear marble floor behind him.</p><p>“I’d better be going—I have tests to mark before the next lesson," Malfoy says, much farther away now. If he concentrates on remembering the sound of Malfoy's footfalls, he can widen the gaps.</p><p>He hears Poppy call, “You have lunch to eat before the next lesson if you know what’s good for you, Professor Malfoy,” and he laughs. The laugh ripples out from him and the ribbons writhe and twist away from it. As they sink into the marble, it closes over them like the glass of Harry's fishbowl.</p><p>"I will do that. Thank you, Madam Pomfrey."</p><p>"<i>It's only lunch, Malfoy, you don't need to sound so bloody formal about it,</i>" Harry mutters as he slips off the bed onto the bare marble floor. It isn't even tacky, just smooth and cool against his feet.</p><p>"You know," and for a moment Harry thinks Poppy is going to say the same thing. He laughs again as she says, "You don't have to call me Madam Pomfrey anymore." He was almost right, sort of.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"<i>'Excuse me?'</i>" Harry mocks and is gratified to see the imagined Malfoy frown in his direction from his position near the door.</p><p>“I don’t pretend to have a talent for remembering dates, Draco, but I know you’ve been teaching here for a good few years. We’re colleagues. I do have a first name, you know.”</p><p>"<i>It's been, what? Fifteen years since? Loosen up a bit, Malfoy, it's amazing what happens when you unbend your spine.</i>"</p><p>"I know." Defensive. No, Harry thinks, not quite defensive. Uncomfortable. He wouldn't have made the distinction before. Maybe he wouldn't have spotted it before, but like Poppy's said, listening is all he can do right now. "I've always called you Madam Pomfrey."</p><p>"<i>You have, too,</i>" Harry says thoughtfully. He'd made the effort to shed the "Professor" this and "Madam" that only a few months after he'd started working at Hogwarts, and it'd been <i>weird</i> at first, especially with some people, but by the time the winter holidays were over, the weirdness was mostly gone. "<i>But it helps if you start.</i>"</p><p>“It’s just . . . well, most of the other teachers call me ‘Mr. Malfoy’ or ‘Professor Malfoy’ . . . like you do . . . usually." The last word is a bit muffled and the Malfoy standing in front of the hospital wing doors is pinching the bridge of his nose. Harry discovers, to his surprise, that he's smiling.</p><p>"<i>'Course they do, that's all you call them,</i>" he says. "<i>Even the ones you like. If there are any of them.</i>"</p><p>Poppy's “Has it ever occurred to you that we are formal with you because you are so formal with us?” makes Harry laugh again. She's got Harry's thoughts bang to rights today, if only she knew it.</p><p>"<i>At least you've got to listen to one of us.</i>" There's no answer, but Harry doesn't expect one as he turns to the walls and begins adding more detail to the brickwork around the windows.</p><p>“You still don’t feel like you belong here, do you?” Recreating rooms is surprisingly engrossing and Harry almost misses Poppy's soft question, but he stands with one finger buried in stone and listens to the silence as it thunders outward, cracking the walls and sending the pieces cascading down through the dark glass floor, until only Malfoy is left, standing in front of the dark doors, motionless and small and alone. "Maybe you should think about that." The doors are gone. Harry barely notices Poppy's disappearing footsteps. He watches Malfoy grow thin and reedy, like a ghost, like a fog. The sound of the door closing dissipates the last shreds and then it's only Harry, staring at nothing.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>He'd stayed where he was and brought the hospital wing back, trying to continue his re-carving of all the brickwork, but working on the hospital wing isn't helping him to get his mind off being <i>stuck</i> in the hospital wing without any idea what's happened to him, or how long it will last. It isn't remotely night, and Harry isn't remotely tired, but he goes back to Gryffindor Tower anyway. He walks through the oak doors from the hospital wing into the Gryffindor common room directly, which feels weird, so he goes back and this time he walks the corridors properly. He takes the time to populate a few empty painting frames and adds detail to a staircase or two on the way. It's something to do.<p>"I am sorry, Harry." He's halfway up the spiral staircase to the boys' dormitory when he hears Poppy's voice next to him. She sounds tired. "I really did think there would be something we could do besides wait." There's a little huff, but he knows she's smiling.</p><p>He sits on the windowsill and imagines her there in the stairwell. She has a basin in her hands, because it just feels wrong to have her standing there without something to do. Poppy never stands round doing nothing. "<i>It's not your fault. I know if there was something you could do, you'd be doing it.</i>"</p><p>He feels a gentle pressure on his shoulder as she squeezes it, then the heavy weight of a blanket again. The image of Poppy wavers a little and he sends her back down the stairs, back to work, as he continues upward. The stones grow more defined as he walks past them, like his very presence is enough now to create an accurate rendition. He has his own set of rooms, of course—he's had them for years now and has relished the privacy and the ability to make the space truly his own, both somewhat new ideas to him at the time—but being on his own right now feels a little too . . . well, real.</p><p>When the door first swings open, the room beyond is a little too big and everything in it just slightly oversized, like he's a first year again. He thinks about changing it, but there's an unexpected warmth when he steps inside, an echo of the wonder he'd felt when he'd seen the room for the first time and thought, <i>Home.</i></p><p>Poppy's footsteps have walked away from his bed again and he doesn't know how long it's been. He's busy tracing golden filigree onto red velvet curtains with his fingertips, marveling a little at how something he'd never really noticed is coming back to him so easily, when he hears the scrape of the chair next to his bed. The mirror on the wall turns milky white and when it clears, it reflects the hospital wing. A little cough has to be McGonagall.</p><p>Dripping gold from his fingers, he crosses to the mirror and climbs up, perching in the oversized frame like it's a window, just as she says, "I'm sure you're concerned about your duties, but I'm pleased to say, Harry, I've come up with a solution."</p><p>"<i>Oh, this ought to be good,</i>" Harry mutters as he hops through the mirror and into the hospital wing proper, drawing up another chair to sit across from her. "<i>I know that voice, that's the 'You're not going to like this so let's get it over with' voice.</i>"</p><p>"You have a great many duties at this school, for which we're all very grateful, but there are several staff members here who have spare time and will be able to take them on temporarily."</p><p>"<i>Go on, then, who've you stuck with it?</i>" Harry says, flipping his chair around to sit with his arms crossed over the back.</p><p>"Mr. Malfoy will be assisting your flying students, coaching your Quidditch team, and, well, Mr. Malfoy will in fact be taking on all your duties," she says quickly, getting it all out, and even the imagined simulacrum McGonagall that Harry thinks he's done quite a good job with won't meet his eyes. "I'm sure he'll—"</p><p>"<i>You what? You gave </i>Malfoy<i> everything? He can't possibly.</i>"</p><p>"—do very well with it once he gets his feet beneath him, and—"</p><p>"<i>Minerva, he </i>can't possibly<i>. He'll have no clue how to do half what I do, he's got barely any idea what I do in the first place!</i>" Harry says, louder, as if it's going to make a damn bit of difference.</p><p>"—should have everything sorted out for you when you're better, so I don't want you to worry."</p><p>"<i>If you didn't want me to </i>worry<i> you should've considered giving my duties to someone who </i>cares about them!" Harry shouts and the noise echoes into thunder. A crack of lightning blinds him before he realizes it's Poppy pulling one eyelid open to check on him again. "<i>Poppy, talk some sense into her, will you? She's clearly not going to listen to me.</i>"</p><p>Of course it's all useless. Everything's useless. Why should he even bother waking up again? Malfoy's going to ruin everything.</p><p>There's a chill on the back of his neck and he whirls to find the mannequin Malfoy standing behind him, neutral-faced, staring into space. Harry rears back and throws a punch. His fist shatters the wax and sends it across the floor, the entire head crumbling and melting where it lands, spreading and sinking through the marble, leaving the headless figure motionless and unaffected.</p><p>It's horrifying.</p><p>Harry stares at the empty spot on Malfoy's shoulders with his stomach in knots. It was like watching a nightmare. It's horrifying that he'd even managed to think that up. Who <i>does</i> something like that?</p><p>He can't quite bring himself to apologize, but he does run a hand over the damage and restores it before letting the figure waver and fade again. His hands shake only a little.</p><p>Harry spends the rest of the evening in the boys' dormitory—one place in the castle he knows Malfoy's never visited—painting filigree and carving the iron on the stove, drawing frost on the windows—he'd always liked winter best in the dorm—and finally climbing beneath his covers. The other four beds are empty and he considers bringing in Ron, or Neville and Dean and Seamus, but even alone in the dorms, he feels like his friends are just downstairs. He's almost able to banish the nagging reminder that they're not. He isn't here at all. It's all in his mind.</p><p>It might be all in his mind for the rest of his life.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>"I know you're awake, Potter."<p>Malfoy's words have the effect of sloshing a bucket of cold water over Harry, who had in fact <i>not</i> been awake, thank you very much. He sputters and sits up to find his four-poster bed sitting alone at the bottom of the fishbowl. Malfoy's face is looming over him, staring down into the bowl, and he scowls and pulls the pillow over his head. "<i>I bloody bloody wasn't, you horrible bastard,</i>" he growls, muffled, into the mattress.</p><p>Faintly, he can hear clinking next to him, and he whips the pillow off and stares irritably upward. "<i>Leave my potions bottles alone.</i>"</p><p>The clinking stops. There's silence for a moment, but Harry knows Malfoy is still there. He can feel the difference in the texture of the air. "Well, Potter, here we are."</p><p>"<i>So we are.</i>" Harry sits up and his bed changes beneath him into his red armchair. Clearly Malfoy isn't going to stir himself any time soon. Harry might as well settle in. He'd been having rather unsettling dreams anyway. The remnants of uprooted hedges and red sparks appear and disappear outside the glass.</p><p>"It’s Wednesday the twenty-sixth of September, in case that’s of any interest to you."</p><p>"<i>Great. Smashing.</i>"</p><p>"It’s about eleven o’clock at night."</p><p>"<i>Can't imagine who'd be sleeping at a time like that.</i>"</p><p>"There’s no one here but you and me, and that’s a first, because we’re not arguing."</p><p>"<i>Not for lack of trying, believe me,</i>" Harry growls, folding his arms and summoning the Gryffindor common room's roaring fireplace. It appears, but it's blurred, the details made unclear by familiarity.</p><p>As he's running his hands over the carvings and bringing them into sharper relief, he hears Malfoy whisper, "Shut up, Malfoy," and realizes Malfoy is supplying his half of the conversation, and snickers. "<i>Yeah, too right, shut up, Malfoy,</i>" he agrees.</p><p>"I’m only saying this because you can’t say anything back—"</p><p>"<i>Bloody cheat,</i>" Harry says absently, carving a lion's head out of marble with his fingers.</p><p>"—but . . . you know what, Potter? I don’t know how you do it. I really don’t."</p><p>"<i>Do what?</i>" Marble drips like paint from his finger onto the red and gold hearthrug as he turns his head to look at the Malfoy that's appeared, slumped in an uncomfortable wooden chair—one of the chairs from the Dursleys' kitchen, he realizes, and hurriedly banishes the echoes of linoleum and cabinetry that begin to form.</p><p>"The Gryffindors are needy and neurotic and bizarre—"</p><p>"<i>They aren't!</i>" Harry shoots back hotly, and the flames in the fireplace leap up as if in agreement.</p><p>"—none of the first-years like me—"</p><p>"<i>You've not gone out of your way to make them, have you?</i>"</p><p>"—the students from the Duelling Club would have preferred it if I’d not turned up and the house-elves apparently think I tried to murder you and refuse to speak to me at all.”</p><p>Harry blinks. "<i>You've </i>done<i> all that?</i>"</p><p>“Of course, it’s only Wednesday. I haven’t had my first Quidditch team practice yet."</p><p>"<i>You mean they </i>have<i> given you </i>my<i> Quidditch team?</i>" Harry roars, shooting back out of his armchair just as he'd sat down again. "<i>McGonagall said, but I thought she was joking, I didn't think she'd—</i>"</p><p>"I bet you think that’s hilarious, don’t you—the idea of me trying to coach a group of Gryffindor tearaways who aren’t going to listen to a word I have to say?"</p><p>"<i>No, I don't think it's hilarious, I'm bloody outraged, as it happens!</i>"</p><p>"Yes, I bet you’d love to be there, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>"<i>Of course I would, Malfoy, you idiot! Of course I want to be there! I want to be anywhere but here! Look at me, look at this, look how </i>useless—" A black ribbon curls out of the lion's mouth, questing as if smelling for him. He backs away.</p><p>“Just so you know, your broomshed looks like it has been raided by trolls. Don’t you ever tidy up in there?”</p><p>"Yes<i>, as it happens, I do, in fact I was just working on it before I decided I'd better get some sleep, before someone else decided sleeping at night wasn't something he was interested in. You ought to see it, it looks brilliant, I've finally sorted out how to keep the really temperamental brooms from getting loose and knocking everything down—</i>" He stops, feeling silly. He hasn't tidied up in there. He's tidied up a version of it that he'd made up. The broomshed, the real one, is still a mess. "<i>If you could see it, though, you'd be impressed,</i>" he finishes lamely, and curls up in his oversized armchair and stares into the fire.</p><p>The silence lasts for several minutes, and Harry isn't in any position to break it, even if he'd wanted to. He's half asleep again by the time he hears Malfoy murmur, "They all just want you, you know."</p><p>"<i>Mm? Whozat?</i>" he asks sleepily.</p><p>"All I hear is ‘when is Professor Potter coming back?’ or ‘Professor Potter does it like this, not like that’.”</p><p>"<i>'S right, I've got them all sorted,</i>" Harry agrees. "<i>Took ages.</i>"</p><p>“Yes, I thought you’d like that. Everyone thinks you’re a better teacher, which is nice for you."</p><p>Harry huffs and opens his eyes, waving his hands impatiently and conjuring up another armchair, with a Malfoy in it, the better to glare at him. "<i>Never said that.</i>"</p><p>"I never wanted to be a teacher anyway, did you know that, Potter?"</p><p>The glare falters a bit. "<i>You didn't? Then why—</i>"</p><p>"I’ll bet you think I just love striding about in my black robes and taking points away from Gryffindors for no good reason. Pretending to be Snape . . .”</p><p>The glare returns full-force. The Malfoy isn't looking at Harry. Weird, how they don't look at Harry.</p><p>Malfoy's voice breaks into his introspection. “Well, maybe a little bit."</p><p>"<i>A </i>little<i> bit?</i>" Harry counters with a snort of disbelief.</p><p>"Of course, the two of you could never get along—"</p><p>"<i>I can't imagine why.</i>"</p><p>"—but Severus was a truly astonishing person. I suppose you could say he was my inspiration. He never really meant to be a teacher, either, but Hogwarts has a way of . . . seeking people out, I suppose."</p><p>Inspiration? "Severus"? Harry stares at the Malfoy, perched on the edge of the armchair cushion in his black robes with his neat blond hair, and wonders why the only professor Malfoy is on a first name basis with is someone who died when they were both seventeen.</p><p>“I have been here longer than you have, Potter. How is that even possible?"</p><p>"<i>Dunno,</i>" Harry says as the Gryffindor common room slowly forms around the two of them, drapes and portraits and finally the warm red wallpaper pouring in and filling all the gaps. The fire is burning low and adds a ruddy glow to Malfoy's face, which makes Harry realize he always pictures him as unhealthily pale.</p><p>"Of course, you just turned up one day with your trunk and the rest was history."</p><p>"<i>Right, yes, I thought I'd just pop in for a spot of professoring as I was passing by.</i>" Harry rolls his eyes and tosses a throw pillow at the other chair. It hits, bounces off, and the simulacrum staring at its hands doesn't react.</p><p>"The truth is, I know what really happened."</p><p>"<i>Oh yeah?</i>" Harry says, to fill the silence.</p><p>"I know that Madam Hooch had a job offer to coach the Harpies, and I also know that she accepted on one condition—that Harry Potter would come to Hogwarts and be her replacement."</p><p>Harry sits bolt upright.</p><p>"You didn’t know that I knew about that, did you? You were headhunted, weren’t you, because you’re just that . . .”</p><p>"<i>Just that what?</i>" Harry hears movement and strains his ears. The Malfoy across from him is fading. "<i>Just that what? Malfoy!</i>"</p><p>Silence. Malfoy's gone. He's bloody gone, just like that. "<i>Good riddance!</i>" Harry shouts, abruptly furious, and sinks the other armchair savagely halfway into the glass, so it sticks out of the floor like a shipwreck. "<i>And you'd better bloody come back, d'you hear?!</i>"</p><p>Grumbling to himself, Harry conjures up the Weasley knitted blanket again and curls up in his armchair, too exhausted suddenly to even attempt recreating his bedroom again. "<i>Bloody Malfoy,</i>" he whispers and sleeps.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>This time, Harry is ready, only dozing when the scrape of a footfall on the marble brings him awake. "<i>Evening, Malfoy,</i>" he says, sitting up and stretching. This time, as the chair squeaks and Malfoy settles in, Harry creates the Three Broomsticks around them and puts them in the snug, quiet and empty except for their two-person table.<p>"Where were we?"</p><p>"<i>Dunno, Malfoy, I guess we're where wherever you'd like us to be,</i>" Harry says as he sips a pint of butterbeer. He's long since tried a lot of what Madam Rosmerta has on offer, but it's still his favorite. He makes it winter outside and piles up a bit of snow on the windowsills.</p><p>“We were talking about teaching.”</p><p>"<i>Right, yeah. And how you never wanted to be one, but Hogwarts sucked you up, wasn't it?</i>" Not Christmastime, no need for decorations, but Harry adds a small fire in a grate. Malfoy sits across from him, shoulders hunched, head bowed, hands folded on the table. "<i>Drink up,</i>" Harry says, even though he knows Malfoy won't. The simulacrum won't do anything unless Harry makes it, and that seems wrong somehow.</p><p>"It’s Thursday, you know. Nearly midnight."</p><p>"<i>I know. Thanks.</i>"</p><p>"Your Quidditch team are a bloody rabble. I only hope they listen to you better than they listened to me."</p><p>Harry laughs, maybe a little unkindly. He can't help but like the idea of his team flying around over Malfoy's head as he stands beneath them, shouting ineffectually. "<i>Not by much, I'd think, but they were probably nicer to me than they'd be to you.</i>"</p><p>"And thanks for promising extra flying lessons to three hopeless cases—that was a lovely surprise.”</p><p>"<i>Three </i>what<i>? Damn you, Malfoy, they're not </i>hopeless<i>, don't tell them that, I've only just got it through their heads that they're </i>not<i> hopeless! If I wake up and find out you've undone everything, I'll bloody well deck you so hard your precious father will feel it!</i>" Harry shouts across the table, selfishly glad this isn't the real Three Broomsticks, where that kind of thing would get Madam Rosmerta sweeping down on him with a false smile and iron in her eyes.</p><p>“Like I said, I never wanted to be a teacher. I’ll tell you what I wanted to be, Potter, because you’ll like it—”</p><p>"<i>I don't care!</i>"</p><p>“I wanted to be an astronaut.”</p><p>"<i>I don't—you what?</i>"</p><p>“When I was six years old, I had a governess called Ingrid. She was rather a progressive type—my mother hired her, of course."</p><p>"<i>Wouldn't've thought either of your parents would hire a progressive type for anything,</i>" Harry says a little wonderingly. Where had Narcissa found her?</p><p>"One day she took me to a Muggle library in town and let me loose in the children’s section. After that, I did nothing but dream about space."</p><p>Harry's hands curl around his butterbeer mug as he listens, open-mouthed. The simulacrum's lips are moving in time with Malfoy's words now, he realizes absently. He must have wanted them to.</p><p>"Of course, my father soon . . . persuaded me out of the idea,” and Harry can <i>hear</i> the wince in his voice, and finds himself wincing in sympathy. He's no stranger to being <i>persuaded</i> out of ideas. No stranger at all. A twinge of something that might be reluctant understanding starts up inside his chest. “Ingrid was gone within the week."</p><p>"<i>Shame,</i>" Harry murmurs and nearly spills his butterbeer when he hears Malfoy murmur the same thing.</p><p>"Shame . . . I liked her. And all those stars and planets . . . fascinating. I always loved Astronomy. Goodness knows how I ended up with Transfiguration."</p><p>"<i>You were always good at Transfiguration,</i>" Harry says automatically.</p><p>"Well, not really. McGonagall needed a Transfiguration teacher, but that’s another story. I suppose the bigger question is, why choose someone like me?”</p><p>"<i>Because you were always good at Transfiguration? Seems to me they'd want someone good at it to teach it.</i>" Space? Stars and planets? An <i>astronaut</i>? </p><p>“I like a good snail proverb, don’t you?”</p><p>"<i>What?</i>" says Harry blankly, still trying to work out how they'd gotten from the rabble of Harry's Quidditch team to young Draco's crushed dream of becoming an astronaut. He doesn't remember learning much about space. Dudley had never been interested, there was too much science involved in real space, and Harry couldn't get handed down books about space if Dudley didn't have any. "<i>What was that about snails? Malfoy?</i>"</p><p>There is no answer. Malfoy must have snuck out while Harry was still trying to remember what he'd known about space before taking Astronomy at Hogwarts. To his mild surprise, the Malfoy across the table is still there. This is the first time, he thinks, that his imagined Malfoy has stayed after the real one had left. Feeling a little foolish, even though no one is there to see, Harry raises his mug and thinks, <i>Go on, have a drink</i>. It takes a moment, but Malfoy's hands separate and wrap around his own mug, and after Harry clinks them gently together, takes a drink.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>Talking about the broomshed has Harry thinking about Quidditch when he wakes up. After Poppy's been and gone, he walks out of his bedroom in the castle and all the way down to the Quidditch pitch. It's habit by now that on the way he examines and fixes anything that he's misremembered. When he gets there, he turns and regards the imposing castle. He knows it well enough by now that not a brick is out of place, not a shingle is missing. He's even left in the gouges on the roof from the Hungarian Horntail. It's a beautiful day to fly, even if the clouds don't move unless he thinks about it.<p>Still, hard work would make flying even better, and despite what he'd said to Malfoy, he isn't entirely finished tidying up the broomshed. Silly, really, bragging about it like that. Not like Malfoy could hear him, or could see his made-up broomshed, but Harry supposes that's just the pattern they've always fallen into when they've talked. Or at least, when they've both been able to talk.</p><p>These one-sided conversations are giving him a lot to think about.</p><p>After cleaning out a few more cobwebs and performing repairs on some of the more desperate-looking school brooms, Harry shuts the broomshed door and carries his beloved Firebolt down to the Quidditch pitch. That's only half-finished, smudged towers where the spectator stands should be, and Harry mounts his broom and kicks off. This is what he'll do today, and when Malfoy comes to visit, he'll have something to be proud of too, even if he can't tell Malfoy about it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>"Hello, Potter."<p>"<i>'Lo Malfoy.</i>" It's not the common room this time, at least not all of it, just the two armchairs and the fireplace with its hearthrug. It feels a bit strange having Malfoy curled up in the prized red velvet chair by the fire, but he reasons rather fiercely that Malfoy <i>is</i> acting Head of Gryffindor right now.</p><p>"Today’s Friday the twenty-eighth . . . just about. It’s pretty late."</p><p>"<i>I know. Thanks.</i>" Harry isn't certain when his thanks had gone from sardonic to genuine. "<i>Finished building the Quidditch pitch today. It looks brilliant, even better than the real thing. Wish you could see it.</i>"</p><p>"I have had a very strange day. Would you like to hear about it?”</p><p>"<i>'Course. Not like I've a choice, but I'd want to know what </i>you<i> consider a very strange day anyway, so—</i>" Harry waves a hand. "<i>Go on.</i>"</p><p>“Of course you would. Now, where to start...” Malfoy talks, and it seems to Harry that he's being used as a sort of verbal diary entry at this point, which he finds he doesn't mind so much. Probably good for Malfoy to have someone to babble at anyway, give him a bit of practice.</p><p>He'd used to think Malfoy just liked the sound of his own voice too much. Now Harry is trying not to think about how important it's become. Poppy tries her best to stop by and speak to him when she can, but she's a busy woman. Out of everyone in the school, Malfoy is the one who comes and talks to him for hours, gives him fresh images to use in his mindscape-sculpting, and keeps him up to date on the school.</p><p>He's half-listening to a litany of complaints about the broomshed as he tries repainting a few of the Gryffindor common room portraits to hang on the walls of nothing, just to give the space a bit of definition, when he suddenly realizes the sound of Malfoy's voice has trailed off. "<i>Malfoy?</i>" he says, brush in hand, and the half-finished portrait appears to be listening as well. There's no answer, of course, and he realizes from the feel of the room that Malfoy must have been talking for hours. Had he left when Harry wasn't paying attention?</p><p>It's odd that he feels a bit guilty about that. It isn't as though Malfoy would know whether or not Harry had been hanging on every word or asleep through the whole thing.</p><p>Suddenly restless, Harry lets the portrait disappear, lets the bits and pieces of common room disappear, and goes for a walk in what he remembers of the fields around the Burrow. No fiery wraiths come raining from the sky, and the shadows beneath the grasses are clear of any slithering black ribbons.</p><p>He lays down in the long grass behind the house, watching the clouds drift overhead, moving because he wants them to. It's afternoon there, even though he knows it's night because Malfoy's told him so, but it's, it's safer to visit the Burrow during the day.</p><p>Eventually he must fall asleep, because Malfoy's irritated "Good grief, I'm awake" whisper also wakes him. He sits up, back in his bed in the dorm, blurry-headed and confused.</p><p>"<i>'Timezit?</i>" he asks, and gets no answer except Poppy's "Up you get, then" to Malfoy.</p><p>"<i>Did you fall </i>asleep<i> in that chair? It's so creaky, it can't be at all comfortable, how'd you manage that?</i>"</p><p>"I will in a minute, I promise," Malfoy is saying, and Harry is suddenly aware of a touch of warmth on his hand that means the sun is shining onto his bed.</p><p>"<i>Were you here all night?</i>" he asks, not entirely sure how he feels about it.</p><p>"—why sensible people sleep in beds, not chairs." Poppy is reprimanding Malfoy, and an image of the chair appears, stretched out and spindly and much larger than life, a properly giant-sized chair with a little stuffed ragdoll Malfoy slumped over against the back of the seat.</p><p>"I didn't plan to sleep here. And anyway, I doubt Potter minded." Harry gets out of bed and climbs the leg of the chair and sits next to him, and straightens him out a little.</p><p>"<i>Nah,</i>" he says at last. "<i>'S fine.</i>"</p><p>"Be that as it may, I am a nurse, not a hotelier, Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>Harry grins. He can so clearly see her upturned nose and the extra-disapproving face she always uses when she's trying not to laugh.</p><p>"What, no breakfast, then?" Malfoy says, he actually says, and Harry can't help it, he bursts out laughing, and the sound spreads and washes sunlight through the darkness. He and the chair and the bed and Malfoy are all on the Quidditch pitch now. It's still done up as well as he can make it, all the details sharp and vivid. Harry shrinks the chair down to a normal size, hopping out of it just before he winds up on the ragdoll's lap.</p><p>He's filling the stands for a match when he hears a distant "Catch" and a hollow <i>thok</i> that has to be some piece of fruit, either that or a football. Maybe a cabbage. "Now, off with you!" Poppy adds, and Harry kicks off on his broom.</p><p>"<i>Nice catch, Malfoy,</i>" he says to the Malfoy that is suddenly on a broom in the sky with him, holding a golden apple with wings. "<i>Keep at it, yeah?</i>" Malfoy lets the apple go and it zips away, an oversized Snitch, and Harry laughs again as he dives after it to the roar of his imagined crowd.</p>
