  <em>September 1, 1999</em>
</p><p>The cobblestones under my feet resounded as the wooden heels of my dragonhide shoes hit each stone.  Approaching the platform that used to be my ride to freedom, I felt a heavy knot tie itself in my stomach.  The last time I had been at Hogwarts had been the worst year of my life.  Being the child of a death eater had earned me some reprieve, and I had escaped the worst tortures, but my classmates pained screams had not left me for a moment since.</p><p>My father’s funeral had been poorly attended, as the bastard deserved.  Only the house elves attended the pitiful service; I couldn’t even bring myself to say anything at the graveyard.  What do you say to a man who beat you until you were good enough?  A man who would’ve offered you to the service of a demented dark wizard without even a second thought.  I cried as they lowered him into the ground, not out of sadness, but out of relief.  I had spent my entire life trying to be the son my father wanted, and when that still wasn’t good enough, I calculated just how much of a disappointment I could be without him killing me.</p><p>I thanked Merlin every day that after Draco’s disappointing performance in killing Dumbledore that the Dark Lord refused to accept wizards until majority.  May 2.  That was the day that my father had died, and Voldemort had fallen.  May 7, my 17<sup>th</sup> birthday.  I had only five days left before my service to the Dark Lord would’ve begun but thanks to Potter, Weasley and Granger I never had my arm marked…I never had to serve a man I despised.</p><p>Some Ravenclaw girl I didn’t recognize bumped into me, and I heard her mumble her apologies, never once looking at me.  “I didn’t see you there.”  She’d said, and I sneered.  No one ever saw me.  Not once in my entire life had anyone ever seen me.  No wait…that’s a lie.  My mother saw me.  I never could figure out how a woman of such beauty and kindness had ended up married to my horrid father.  Her death had been the saddest moment of my life, and the moments before it was the last time I knew love of any kind.</p><p>The platform suddenly fell into a hush of whispers and I knew that there were two options of who had just come through the barrier.  The first option (and the more preferable of the two) was that Draco Malfoy had arrived, the second option (and the more likely since Draco was planning on apparating to Hogsmeade and walking in) was that Harry Potter was truly coming back for his last year at Hogwarts.  Now I just had to determine which one it was.  My question was answered a few seconds later when a round of applause like rolling thunder rippled through the station.</p><p>Turning towards what seemed to be the center of the commotion, my eyes took in the sight before me.  Being taller than most of the other students, I was still able to see the trio through the throng of students and parents – it also helped that there were notably less people than usual, a sad testament to the destruction and loss of the war.  Standing just outside the entrance were the heroes of Hogwarts. </p><p>Potter seemed to have finally packed on some weight, looking less emaciated and exhausted than he had during the final battle.  I’d always noticed how thin he was, children of abuse tended to see one another in ways other could not.  He had his arm draped around the Weasley girl, which was not a surprise at all.  Anyone who was within fifty feet of those two could tell they were destined for one another, it honestly made me sick.  The Weasel looked like he had fully recovered his strength from the year before as well, and I couldn’t help but notice that he was much more muscular than I remembered him being.   That wasn’t what interested me the most though.  No, what interested me the most was Hermione Granger.</p><p>She had always been cute, at least I had always thought so.  I still remembered that first day on the train when she had asked me if I’d seen Longbottom’s toad.  Draco had been quick to make fun of her curly hair, and then later when she’d been sorted into Gryffindor and they found out she was muggleborn…it was safe to say that any and all romantic interest towards her would be punished, severely.</p><p>Looking at the woman standing to the right of Potter now though, it took all of my Slytherin training to not drop my jaw to the floor.  She had cut her long curls off just around her chin, giving her a flattering bob.  Her honey eyes were highlighted by the slight rosiness of her cheeks, and he figure was being tightly hugged by muggle denims.  The peasant-style blouse she wore sucked in at her waist before pooling out, the light blue complimenting her skin beautifully.  Only the princess of Gryffindor could fight a war and come out looking better than before.  Even her scars were beautiful, glinting in the light as she walked.</p><p>Was she my punishment for all the wrong I’ve done?  It was the only thing that made sense.  She was not beautiful in the traditional sense, not in the way that Daphne Greengrass or Lavender Brown had been.  It was everything non-traditional about her that made her irresistible.  She never seemed bogged down by what she was supposed to be; never giving in to the plight of many teenage witches wondering how to do their hair or what makeup to wear.  It was intoxicating, the confidence with which she snubbed her nose at what and who she was supposed to be.</p><p>My focus on her features was broken as the Weasel said something to make her laugh.  I was too far away to hear what it sounded like, but I liked to imagine that it was soft and sweet.  When she was done laughing, the Weaselette whispered something in her ear, and her huge brown eyes turned suddenly and locked onto mine.  “Shit.”  I muttered under my breath, breaking away my eyes from hers.  I’d just been caught staring by Hermione Granger.  Pushing whatever misguided feelings I was having for the girl aside, I gathered my belongings and approached the train.  I could only avoid facing my consequences for so long, and time was running out.</p><p>No one at Hogwarts knew that I didn’t want any part of Voldemort’s plan.  No one at Hogwarts knew that I was abused by the very man they thought I worshipped.  Not even Blaise, my closest friend, knew about the beatings.  In a world where I was never seen, my mask of indifference and boredom morphed into a death eater’s mask to some.  There would be people there who would blame me for the sins of my father, for the lives he had taken, and I’m not even sure I wouldn’t deserve it.  All my life I’ve been a coward.  Too afraid to stand up for myself…too afraid to stand up to my father…too afraid to run away and too afraid to stay.  There would be people who would want me dead, and if I’m being honest with myself, I want me dead too.</p><p>The scars the entire student body had suffered in the time of the Carrows made me sick.  The younger kids were tortured, harassed, made to feel afraid in the very place they should’ve felt the safest.  Older students…well we were no better off.  The first time I was made to torture a student was September 3<sup>rd</sup>.  Amycus Carrow had caught a Gryffindor with one of the contraband Weasley contraptions and I was the unlucky bastard who had been walking by.  It seems the Carrows didn’t understand the nature of the Cruciatus however, because when you cast one, you have to mean it.  Looking down at that terrified second year with his wide blue eyes staring at me, pleading for his life, I had never meant anything less.  I mouthed the words and moved my hands the way I should’ve, but I didn’t mean it.</p><p>Of course, the students of Hogwarts wouldn’t know that.  I was Theo Nott, son of a death eater, Slytherin scum.  Nothing else mattered; not that I cried myself to sleep for the first two months of school, not that my father beat me when he heard I couldn’t cast the Cruciatus.  To all of these people, I was what they decided I’d be.   Maybe…no…I shook my head to cast out the thought the moment it came into my head.  Moving quickly, I boarded the train, finding an empty car where I could be alone with my thoughts.  Draco wasn’t going to be on the train, so I ran through who I might see and how I might get out of seeing them.</p><p>Blaise would no doubt come find me eventually, but his role as Head Boy would keep him busy for a while.  Crabbe…well he was dead.  Goyle had helped his father try to flee the country, so he was doing a nice little stint in Azkaban.  Pansy, well I wouldn’t be surprised if I never saw her face in London again (trying to offer the savior of the Wizarding World to the Dark Lord tends to make someone unwelcome).  Daphne and Astoria were hidden away at Beauxbatons the moment the Dark Lord took control of the ministry.  For all intents and purposes, I was alone.</p><p>Casting a disillusionment charm so no one would see me, I suddenly felt the weight of my exhaustion.  I’d barely slept since the end of the war, waiting for the nightmares to fade.  Every night I would dream that my father was alive, and what a disappointment I would be.  Not only did I not fight, I ran away…I was a coward.  Before I realized what was happening, I felt the hot sting of tears run down my face.  I shouldn’t have come back.  I should have fought.  I should’ve…</p><p>My self-pity session was cut short when a familiar voice called out, “Found an empty one.”  Wiping my face quickly, I made sure not to make a sound.  In filed Potter, Weaselette, Weasel and Granger.  My breath caught when, of course thanks to my blasted awful luck, the muggleborn witch sat in the seat closest to me.  Only moments later, once everyone had stowed their trunks, Neville Longbottom and Loony Lovegood joined them.  This was already not good, and it was getting worse every second.</p><p>Loony, wearing her trademark crazy glasses, moved to sit next to Hermione, but she also did something I didn’t expect.  She looked straight into my eyes and excused herself.  I was 100% sure I was still under a disillusionment spell, but cast worried glances around the cabin to see everyone regarding Luna with a look of amused dismissiveness and she leaned in close and whispered so only I could hear it, “Don’t worry, they can’t see you.”  She then let out a forced cough, reminding me she had asked me to move.  I hurriedly scooted over and watched with awe as the blonde turned back to her friends.  Why hadn’t she given me away?  If I hadn’t been hiding from the very people she had come in with, I would’ve dropped the spell right then and asked her. </p><p>“What was with that prat staring at you?”  The Weaselette asked, moving her head from its place on Potter’s shoulder and leaning across to speak to the girl. </p><p>“I’m not sure.”  Granger responded, and I almost choked on air as I noticed a small blush forming around the base of her cheeks.</p><p>“Probably wishing Voldemort had finished the job and done her in.  All Slytherins are such blood purist scum.  Who even was he?  He looked like he was around our age, but I don’t remember him.  Probably some nobody, looked familiar though.”  If I hadn’t already been used to people saying that about me, that might’ve stung, but I’d cultivated the last five years of my life into being forgettable…being nothing.  I invited people to underestimate me, but now that my father was dead and the madman had been dealt with…I didn’t want to be forgettable anymore.  I wanted to be seen.</p><p>“Anyway, lets not talk about some psycho Slytherin…are you excited to be Head Girl Hermione?  I mean it’s not like there’s any contest in our year.  You’re loads smarter than everyone else.  Don’tcha think?”  The Weasel seemed to lean in closer to Granger, and I couldn’t help but notice that she was smiling, but her eyes looked a little panicked.  <em>Oh this is interesting</em>, I thought.  <em>The Weasel’s got a crush, but it doesn’t seem that the Gryffindor Princess reciprocates.</em>  This was new information to him, as the Daily Prophet had been running a continuous speculation column on the relationship of the Golden trio’s Brainiac and…well whatever purpose the Weasel served.</p><p>“Regardless, I need to work hard.  Who knows, maybe this will be the year that Malfoy finally bests me.  After all, he doesn’t have his father or Voldemort holding him back anymore.”  The ease with which she both said the Dark Lord’s name and talked about Draco caused me to stare at her with my mouth agape.  My slight gasp was luckily drowned out by the laughter that followed her statement, and I returned to listening intently to their conversation.</p><p>“You never know.  Perhaps someone will surprise you.  Theo Nott was always exceptionally bright.”  Loony stated, looking once again directly at me.  She winked with a mischievous and knowing look in her eye, and I was once again left to wonder what game she was playing at.</p><p>“Nott?”  The Weasel responded, finally seeming to remember where he knew him from.  “You mean that bastard who Sluggy wouldn’t let join his club sixth year because his father was a death eater?”  His voice dripped in disgust, and Harry seemed to reel at the mention of their sixth year.  It hadn’t been a good year for anyone in my house, and it seemed to me that that statement was true unanimously through Hogwarts.</p><p>“Ronald.”  Granger warned, placing a small hand on his arm.  Of course she would stand up for me; the precious Gryffindor princess, so kind and forgiving.  “Nott is…I’m not concerned about him suddenly replacing me as number one.  He’s not the most confident wizard is he.  I don’t even really remember him except for a handful of encounters.  He’s just another Slytherin.  I highly doubt he has the power or brains to challenge me.”  There was something in her eyes that filled me with bitter disappointment.  Not that I expected sympathy or forgiveness from her, Merlin knew I didn’t deserve it.  What I absolutely didn’t expect though, was the anger that followed it.  I was so tired of these self-righteous Gryffindors.  Sure, they were heroes, but he wasn’t a villain.  He was more than a Slytherin…he was more than his father’s son. </p><p>As soon as that thought entered my head, I knew that I had to change things.  If they didn’t want to see who I was, I would make them see.  I would show them just how strong a wizard I could be.  <em>Well well, miss Granger</em>, he thought, scowling at the collection of heroes around him, <em>I never took you for the type to make the same mistake as everyone else…Underestimating me comes with a price.</em></p><p>For the past five years, I had been holding myself back…fading into the shadows.  It was time for everyone to see who I really am.  I am powerful…I am smart…I am Theodore Nott.</p>
