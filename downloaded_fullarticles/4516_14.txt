    <p>It is dark and I am very afraid.<br/>
How did I get here? I struggle, but find that I am confined by chains around my wrists, which are attached to the wall. I feel around for my want, but to no use. I hear voices and I stop moving.<br/>
"Watch her closely, Lucius. We can't have her running away--do you understand?"<br/>
"Yes, my lord. I will keep a close watch on her."<br/>
The voices grow louder and I hear footsteps approaching. The dungeon door creaks open, letting in a sliver of light. I cover my eyes, which have been in the dark for too long. The door shuts behind the person who has just entered. "Are you awake?" the voice calls out in the dark. I try to respond, but nothing comes out. I clear my throat. "Yes," I croak. A dark figure approaches me Quickly.<br/>
"Lumos"<br/>
A bright light is emitted from the tip of the wand--I see Lucius Malfoy standing above me. He looks at me with a penetrating stare of curiosity and something else I can't quite place. "How are you feeling?" he asks me. How am I feeling? I'm fucking terrified. I stare blankly at him, completely exhausted. Noticing the vacant look he extends his arm. I instinctually shy away. "Don't be afraid. I brought you some water...here." I cautiously take the water, looking inside the glass. "There's nothing in there. I just thought you might be thirsty. You've been out for three days." he informs me. Three days. Holy shit. As I drink the water he lights some lanterns that are hanging on the walls. "You're friends with him, aren't you? That's the reason you're here, after all." he purrs. 'Him'. The chosen one. I'm unsure of what to say. My stomach is turning and fear rises in my throat. "Yes." I manage. Out of somewhere, courage appears. "Why am I here?" I ask. Somewhat startled, he turns and faces me. "Let's just say that you're going to make excellent bait. There's nothing Potter loves more than swooping in and saving the day, it's almost a flaw of his. He comes to rescue his little friend and we've got him exactly where we want him. Understand?" I nod. Though I wish that Harry will come and save me right away, there is another question on my mind.<br/>
"What am I supposed to do until he comes?"<br/>
"You wait."<br/>
Waiting? That is very vague. Waiting could mean sitting in this room for weeks on end, or it could mean a much worse fate--torture. I begin to worry, but my thoughts are interrupted. "If you're thinking of going anywhere, you can just get that idea out of your pretty little head. I'm going to be with you pretty much all day every day so there's no chance of you escaping." he informs me. My stomach sinks. He notices the look of fear and disappointment on my face. "Oh, cheer up. I can't be that repulsive, now can I?" he taunts. Before I can answer, there is a knock at the door.<br/>
"Lucius, come out here. I must talk with you."<br/>
Lucius meets my eyes. "I'll be back." he says before exiting and locking the door behind him. Now alone with an illuminated room, I can see that the room is about ten by ten feet and made completely of concrete. I'm lying on a straw mat with a pile of ratty blankets under me and the only other things in the room are a chair and a bucket...presumably for bodily functions. As the reality of my situation sets in, I begin to cry. I'm chained to the wall like an animal, waiting for one of my friends to drop out of the sky and save me. In the midst of my crying, Lucius reenters the room. I look up at him and, though I am scared, I can't help but find some comfort in his presence.<br/>
"We're moving you."<br/>
He takes my hands and gently unlocks the cuff from around my wrists. As he does this, I look in his eyes and see a glimmer of sympathy staring back at me. Upon making eye contact I quickly divert my eyes to the floor. I am finally un-cuffed. "Come with me," he say, walking ahead of me. I follow him through the door and out of the room.</p>
