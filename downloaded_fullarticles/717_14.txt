    <p>Janet D'arcy strolled the streets of the french quarter, coat collar high and hat low, hiding her blood stained face. She was thinking over  the contract that waited on her desk at home, when she heard a soft whimper. Her head snapped to the side, and her blue eyes narrowed. It didn't sound like an animal, but a small child. She scanned the street, until she heard the noise again. It was coming from the stoop of an orphanage that she knew was heavily underfunded and overpopulated. That was bad enough, but it was <em>January</em>. They may be in Louisiana, but it was still barely above freezing. She strode over, heels clicking on the cobblestone, and crouched next to the small swaddling. She growled, low in her throat, when she got a good look at the child. </p><p>It was a baby of no more than six months, wrapped in a thin, pale pink blanket. The small child's nose was purpling at the tip, as were her small ears. Janet scooped the child into her arms, and resumed her path. Her mother had been bothering her to produce an heiress, and this sweet <em>petite fille</em> needed a home. Really, it was only logical.</p><p>XoXoX</p><p>Janet used one hand to dig around in her pocket, before pulling out her keys. She quickly unlocked all three locks on the heavy oak door to her house, before slipping inside. She shut the door silently, and turned around to see her mother standing on the marble stairs in her robe with her arms crossed.</p><p>"Is the target eliminated, Janet?" Marie D'arcy was a woman of fifty two, though she did not  look a day over thirty, with brown hair and green eyes. </p><p>"<em>Oui, Mama.</em> He died in his sleep. Truly a shame." The two smirked at each other for a moment, before Marie's eyes went to the odd bulge in her daughter's jacket. </p><p>"Another stray kitten, Janet? You can't keep doing this, <u></u><em>mon couer. </em>Let's see the poor dear then." Marie's bayou accent grew heavy with exasperation.</p><p>"Not quite a kitten, I'm afraid." Janet brsced herself as she pulled the small baby out of where she had been keeping her warm. "Meet your new granddaughter." Janet winced at the glare her mother sent her.</p><p>"Explain, <em>ma fille</em>. Now." </p><p>"I found her on the stoop of Lady Levi's Orphanage, Mama. She only has a thin blanket, and was turning blue. She'd be dead come morning. I couldn't just leave the poor <em>cher</em>." Marie glided down the stairs, and pulled the cord hanging from the wall near the bottom. She swept across the marble  floor, and took the sleeping child from Janet's arms.</p><p>"Gerard can fetch your old cradle from the attic for tonight. We'll buy her everything she'll need tommorrow. For now, go get a shower. I'll call Healer Leblanc to look her over. Just know, she'll be trained the same as you were, <em>mon couer</em>." Marie bounced the little girl slightly, staring her daughter in the eye.</p><p>"<em>Je comprend</em>, Mama." Janet peeled off her coat and headed for the stairs, smiling. She may be an assassin, but she still had heart enough to be glad that her mother would be helping the <em>petite fille.</em></p>
