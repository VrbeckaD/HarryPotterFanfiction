    <p>Part One</p><p>She was saddened to hear of Draco Malfoy’s death.  She could not explain why those obituary words stuck in her throat as if she’d eaten a large wad of taffy without water. She felt slightly itchy and ready to choke. She rubbed at her stinging eyes with confusion. She and the boy had been embittered, school yard rivals; those years were not easily dismissed and yet she had knocked back tears for him.</p><p>She’d seen the news on the fourth page of the “serious” wizarding reporting newspaper-a new authentic title that was spooned onto all things nowadays. Everything required an identifying monocure to make it authentic now. So much so that reality itself was yet another package to be rewrapped and sold as the new, more real reality. Yet another consequence of a dark evil threatening society to extinction. Voldemort’s influence  could never truly die in the hearts of a post-war world.</p><p>Sins would always bleed into the soil and this time the thing that flowered was a need to prove that existence was a shared, agreed upon set of dictations. The post war world assurance that what was real for one wizard was real for them all. A collective belief...a collective understanding of the world that bars wizards from splintering into factions and camps that believe this truth over that truth over another.  Now, the world as a whole was intent on believing one singular truth that everyone could agree on no matter the consequences. No matter that it killed the idea of the “individual”. The collective was all that mattered now.  </p><p>So, she did not question the “truth” of this backpage news story. It was salacious and full of gossip that hinted at a shocking cause of death, but she had no doubt of its core truth. He had died and, perhaps in the most unforgivable way for a beautiful young man to die, at his own thin hands. With so few virile young men to repopulate the desolate and devastated population, this was a death that even she could not forgive. There was one less man roaming the streets providing romance to a broken generation. </p><p>His death would have been the front page headline even one year prior but now it was relegated to the forgotten pages of the “authentic” news rags right behind the adverts peddling Mrs. Honeycutt’s “Newly Improved and Absolutely NOT Combustible Wart Removal Potion”. Hermione could almost imagine Malfoy’s affronted face as he realized that his death was of so little importance that it was placed after such a hackneyed product and she found herself sniggering until she cried again. A couple looked at her oddly as they passed by her and she remembered she was sitting on a park bench looking very much like an utter loon. She dried her face and looked around. The world was still going on as if something monumental had not just happened. The indomitable Draco Malfoy was dead and no one seemed particularly off kilter about it. The world continued to spin as normal and she couldn’t help but feel as though something had been irretrievably lost.</p><p>The world was too broken to care anymore. It was searching for meaning in mighty heroes and impossible feats of magical defiance. The media did not have the publishing budget to focus on the death of a has-been. The days of admiring the rich and famous had been strangled out in lieu of a culture clinging desperately to magical super men who could save the world with a swish of their electric wands.  There was simply no use for glitz and glamour when the world was too busy sewing itself up into a super mass of collective idealism. And for that reason she wept. For the horrid days of the dark and the horrid days in this new light.</p><p>Still sitting on the park bench, Hermione stashed away the offending newspaper and pulled out her weekly planner in hopes of shaking off her melancholy. She reviewed her speaking engagements and scheduled appearances coming up in the next few days and could barely find a moment to even go to work. She had been in a listless swamp of banquets and interviews that all seemed to be laser focused on her insurmountable fame and her even more larger than life friends. She knew that all three of them were bombarded with requests, invitations, ribbon cuttings, endorsement deals and the like. Each member of the Trio handled it on their own messed up terms.</p><p>Ron, surprisingly, was the recluse. Harry had Ginny to pull him from the dark cupboard of his mind into the more acceptable darkness of merchandised selfhood. Harry could often be found skulking about at auction halls as the top prize for The Society of Orphaned Web-Winged Toad’s Charity or some other such nonsense. </p><p>Sadly, Ron had only himself and a forgetful Hermione to push him through the glittering flashes of lonely fame. And, for her part, she could not be the backbone of the trio anymore; she couldn’t be Ron’s backbone anymore. Ron slipped and drowned under the world’s crushing wave of adoration and Hermione was unsteady against its tide. Ron was unable to piece together a version of himself that wasn’t muddled by hero-worship and unrealistic expectations; his search for meaning and identity was suffocated by the public’s need for an unscarred hero. She was no better.</p><p>Hermione felt shaky and unable to make appropriate decisions anymore. It was too difficult to be intelligent for public display. It hurt too much to be the glue. Ginny attempted to take Hermione’s mantle but was unable to understand Hermione’s essential (and unspoken), primary function, was unable to hold the flaying group together. Hermione was the irreplaceable piece. At least in that Hermione was vindicated.</p><p>The trio still met religiously but their bond was a captain-less vessel left unanchored so that each member buffeted against the great sea with no strong leader to steer them back oncourse. And for that, Hermione was terribly anguished. Part of being on a leaderless ship entailed finding one’s self in vast galley of unawareness and floating into oblivion. She hated that she could not be the leader her men needed. She hated that Draco Malfoy had most certainly felt as adrift as she did with no one to pull him back to safety. He was another lonely vessel left to float alone. Hermione felt somehow as responsible for his lack of guidance as she did with her own boys; if she were more “The Hermione Granger” that the world wanted her to be then none of this would have happened.</p><p>Hermione stashed her planner back in her bag and picked up the crumpled newspaper again. She told herself to leave it- leave him on the bench and go about her day but she couldn’t. She turned to his page again to stare at his obituary photo. It was him in what she assumed was his family’s immense gardens. He was standing behind his mother as she sat primly on a garden chaise lounge. He was wearing a perfectly tailored set of summer dress robes and his face was set in a serious expression. He looked every bit the perfect English aristocrat but his hands told a different story. They clutched the back of his mother’s chair like claws as if he were as light as air and could simply float away with the slightest provocation if he did not clamp himself to something tangible. Hermione wondered how many years he’d been clutching on to humanity before he finally let it go.</p><p>The church bells from Saint Maria’s began ringing in the new hour and Hermione was broken from her reverie. It was almost 8 am and she was going to be late for work. She reached for her caffeinated tea and vacated the bench, heading for her job. She attempted throwing the newspaper in the rubbish bin near her bench but was unable to actually do it. She sighed as her hands trembled over the rubbish bin with the paper in hand. Hermione bit her lip before snatching up that page and ripping it out of the paper. She folded into the tiniest piece that she could before slipping it into her bag for safe keeping. He was more than a printed piece of paper but this was all she could do for him now. It was the least she could do to save him from the rubbish keep. </p><p>Satisfied with her decision, she threw the rest of the paper away and hurried as quickly as her sensible shoes could carry her. She refused to apparate or use some other magical convenience to make up time. She straddled a life on the edges of society. She remained a full witch but spent much of her time commuting to a small muggle village where she relished in old books and manuscripts. She was fully aware that she was wasting away her intelligence and it hurt her deeply and yet she was too unhappy to excel further. She could not wrestle up the resolve to do more, be more. That perseverance had been strangled out of her at 18 when she saw what the world really was. </p><p>……………………………………………………...</p><p> </p><p>She did not go to the Burrow anymore as a point of contention despite constant pleas and veiled threats. She could not participate in a happy mirage while her parents fell into oblivion. She knew she should not and yet she could not stop herself. She spied on them obsessively with a crackling cauldron in her small flat on the east end. They were unhappy. They could not remember their daughter or their respective siblings, cousins and college mates. And yet, they were not complete. Despite the unnamed or unremembered lives that had been spirited away from them, their spirits knew of loss. They could not be truly happy together but without other relatives to rely on, they could not be  apart.</p><p> She watched them yell at each other, unhinged and unsure, never knowing what missing pieces were haunting their lost souls. They could not get close to each other and yet they could not walk away. They pushed and pulled and tried to rebuild lives they did not remember. They argued about eating sweets without knowing why, they complained about the British royals and parliamentary politics with such emotion that it frightened them. They weren’t actually British so why did they care, they’d seem to say silently to themselves. Those confused glances and far away looks crushed Hermione. She watched them scream together and fumble apart. She often slapped the cauldron to the ground. Watching the cackling brown liquid coat her floorboards. She did not sleep anymore.</p><p>She soon realized that with no parents and no Weasleys, her life was rather small. She often found herself staring at the walls without any true knowledge of the passage of time. Hermione had been in a daze for several years now. She sometimes heard a woman screaming in the darkness as she lay awake at night. She always shuddered when she recognized the voice as her own. </p><p>And just like that, a miracle or curse depending on the perspective, slammed into her life and changed everything. A missive of all things woke her from her sticky stupor. An invitation to meet a beseeching acquaintance. Daphne Greengrass-Goyle wanted her to come to tea. “What the fresh hell?” Hermione thought as the small, decadent invitation floated in her hands as the carrier owl feverishly flew away from her. </p><p>The invitation requested her presence on Sunday at midday. She hated the vague sense of casual formality. Why not be frank and say noon or one o’clock? Midday seemed like an inside joke for the fabulously wealthy who intrinsically knew when to show up somewhere and when to depart. She, not being of that class, was unsure of what time midday could mean to such people and she was annoyed that she wasn’t sure. She found it odd that she was more annoyed by their casual timeliness than the invitation itself.</p><p>She knew that she should not bother to attend. But her curiosity had not been peaked like this in so long.  If she were honest with herself, she’d admit a tiny thrill about the invitation. It was a chance to break up the monotony eating away at her days. She only broke up her routine for weddings and funerals and the overabundance of pregnancy celebrations. Those were all things that happened to other people and she was always on the smiling periphery- celebratory but aloof and adrift. </p><p>The short note was specifically crafted to ensure that Hermione would be too interested to decline a meeting. And it read as follows:</p><p> <i> “A good morning to you Miss Hermione. I know that this may be untoward and rather abrupt, but I hope this letter finds you well. I cannot claim much familiarity with you as we hardly interacted as children and yet we of this generation all have a shared past that makes such formalities feel slightly unnecessary. I digress because that is a topic for another occasion. </i></p><p><i> Now to my point: I have come into contact with  a rare item. I have heard that your expertise would be of extreme use in deciphering the properties of said item. I am having tea in the garden this Sunday at midday. It would greatly please me to have your company and expert opinion on such a unique find. You, of course, would be well compensated for your time.</i> </p><p>	<i>	Etc etc, </i></p><p>	<i>	Daphne Greengrass-Goyle. “</i></p><p>Despite the rather abrupt tone and the large possibility that this “rare item” was nothing more than a muggle cassette tape (truly a relic these days), she was interested. The note had a red gummy substance on the bottom. She had only seen such a thing once before when she still worked in the ministry. She found it a mixture of arrogance and acceptance that Daphne had not bothered to explain what it meant to her in the note. Despite being muggle-born, Daphne knew that Hermione would understand its significance despite not knowing her at all. </p><p>Hermione felt soft fur pass over her bare feet and she started. The cat had brought her back to the current moment and she realized that she was only partly dressed for work. She finished up her morning procedures with heart beating faster than it had in awhile. She debated all day if she should tell her two best friends about the strange morning note.</p><p>She told them of course. They were her family now-all broken and busted up like all the other familial relations in the world. Harry, long past the point of surprise, was the first to suggest that perhaps she should go and see what all the fuss was about even if only for a chuckle. He’d known how monotonous life had been these past few years. The daily schedules and routines were relentless especially for him, young father, who no longer tangled with adventure and disaster. </p><p>Her other best friend was a different sort entirely. Ron had grown so distrustful of almost everyone from their previous life that he strictly forbade her acceptance. His face was deep red and he sputtered angrily that anyone could think this was a good idea (with a few curses peppered throughout to emphasize his disapproval. </p><p>Ginny gave him a strong look and he crumbled back into himself and murmured that “it’d be a shame to survive war only to be poisoned by a bloody Goyle”. Ginny, incensed with pregnant fire, verbally fired back at him. His look of dejection as his sister scolded him like a mother made Hermione almost want to intervene. His vehement rejection of the note was the biggest spark she’d seen in him in years. She felt a burning grow inside herself- a moment of craggy hate for his sister who doused his fire. Hermione immediately burned up with self reproach. Ginny didn’t deserve that anger.</p><p>She wrapped a pale arm around Ron’s threadbare body and kissed the spot beneath his ear quickly, as she used to do. He smiled at her with a flickering of flame of roguishness and she felt intense relief. Their love story ended before it ever got off the ground but the deep affection would never evaporate. Harry and Ginny, with hope still deep in their hearts, smiled at each other as she and Ron openly embraced. They always did when they saw the small flint of fire between Ron and her. They’d never stop believing that the two of them could save each other. Hermione and Ron knew it simply wasn’t true.</p><p>Ron walked her to the bus station after ending the evening with Harry and Ginny. They walked calmly together in the cool night. Ron complained lightly at the needlessness of walking when apparition was an option. “You’re a witch!” he’d tell her as if she’d forgotten. She’d shrugged not being able to voice the need to be a normal girl walking home from a night out with friends. He never understood her need to pretend to be average. </p><p>They were walking through the square towards the bus line. It was a Thursday night and no one was around. She stopped walking abruptly and spun to kiss his neck again. He knew it was coming. It was always one of them who began this way. Right before reaching the statue in the center of the square, one of them would do it. She pressed her lips against his neck then nibbled. He bent down and ran a hand across her thin arms. They never kissed each others lips. They only nibbled at one another in an imitation of taking the other in. That was far as it ever went. This strange ritual of kissing and nibbling at necks and ears and throats. They dared each other to take it further- to hastily unzip each other but it never happened. It couldn’t be done. As she said, their love story wasn’t burning bright enough and never would. </p><p>The clinging and sighing stopped with both of them breathless and reluctant. They pulled apart like repelling magnets. They did not discuss it. They walked onward with wet necks and flushed cheeks and with a clammy warmth in their bones- just enough heat to be noticeable and make them shiver with the sudden coldness of the air.</p><p> </p><p>Sunday approached on swift feet. Hermione had been looking at the red gum paste off and on for an hour. She could not bring herself to press her finger to the past and  she could not ignore it either. She wondered how it would feel under her finger. She needed to know how it would bind her. She threw up her hands and slouched away from the invitation. She took a few moments to dress in what could be considered acceptable garden attire. She left her wild hair unencumbered as she always did these days. No potions or spells to hide behind. That was not acceptable anymore. It was not real.</p><p>She paced and frumped about attempting to be caught up in some project that would make her forget the time and perhaps miss the engagement entirely under the guise of tricking herself. She  found that she could not throw herself into anything with enough vigor and her interest in the tea party was too great to allow her to be distracted. </p><p>At half past noon, She picked up the invitation and wrapped it back in its packaging. She was careful not to touch the red gum. She reluctantly apparated  to the residence apparation point using the instructions on the back of the card. She was before the foreboding grounds too quickly. The home was large and old. Its gothic style old even compared to most wealthy families’ standards. It reminded her of a black painted pumpkin with sharp, jagged teeth. </p><p>The front door opened at her approach and tall servant of indeterminable gender stood in the door’s shadow. The servant had two thick red lines tattooed at the base of the neck. They resembled the fat straight lines coloured markers made if you slanted the marker tip to the side. </p><p>“Please allow me to welcome you to the gardens Miss Granger”. The voice was deeply masculine with a slippery quality to the tail end of his words. It was as if his mouth couldn’t grab the words before they glided out into the air. </p><p>He waited for her to cross the threshold as his patient hands gestured towards an oddly country-chic door with old style wood grid pattern intersecting the window that led to a manicured garden. When she was fully inside, he began walking her over to the garden entrance and she surreptitiously looked about the humble hallway. The candles were unlit and the only light came in through the open shutters lining the foyer and adjoining hallways. There were very few specialty items or expensive furnishings on immediate display. She’d heard that the Greengrass family vaults had been greatly reduced in grandeur after the wartime reparations. However, she’d assumed that Daphne’s marriage to Gregory’s older brother would have secured the young woman  a lifestyle more in keeping with her upbringing. </p><p>Too quickly, she was back outdoors and walking through the lavish gardens. The gardens were the opposite of the inside decor and much more in line with Hermione’s vision of a wealthy homestead. The rose bushes  were docile and clean while the large shrubs were perfectly sculpted into mythical creatures that looked both ferocious and heavily yoked. Close to the house was a large paved pavilion with luxury lawn furniture, gold hardware, modern lighting and table settings. </p><p>In the center of the pavilion sat the beautiful lady of the manor wearing fashionable summer robes and large hat resembling that of a muggle royal. Next to Daphne was another woman, wearing an even larger summer hat that obscured her face. By the extreme softness of her hands, from too many moisturizing potions, Hermione guessed the other guest was a bit older than Daphne and Hermione. Daphne’s mother or aunt most likely. </p><p>Hermione, upon seeing an unexpected second lady, felt her back stiffen. She had not expected anyone beyond Daphne and she couldn’t help feeling concerned. she reasoned that tea parties usually had multiple ladies in attendance and she should have been prepared and yet she was not ready to mingle. She had hoped to get down to the business of the mysterious item and be off rather soon after. She had a strong sense that it would not be a short affair after all. </p><p>Daphne and the woman were speaking in low and slightly sharp tones but the conversation abruptly ended as the servant and Hermione approached. Daphne’s creased forehead smoothed instantly and her shoulders rolled back pleasantly. Hermione wished she was able to compose herself so quickly. She imagined it was learned in finishing school or perhaps it was simply bred into highborn women. </p><p>The servant led her to the table and pulled out her seat. She sat quickly and looked down as the servant pushed her chair easily into the proper place. Without ceremony, he poured her tea and was off. She felt as if her security blanket was being ripped from her although she would not miss looking at the red stripes down his throat. They reminded her of congealed blood.</p><p>“Thank you Miss Granger for accepting my invitation”. Daphne said with an air of restrained politeness.  Hermione responded in kind. Daphne inquired into the acceptability of the tea and Hermione assured her that it was lovely. A short silent erupted where the other woman’s opinions would need to be accounted for and yet neither the woman nor Daphne said anything. Right as Hermione began to feel the need to look over at the silent woman seated next to her, Daphne interjected.</p><p>“I must apologize that I have not introduced Mrs. Malfoy. It must seem impossibly rude but I believe she has fallen asleep and I was reluctant to wake her.” Hermione looked over and it did appear that Narcissa’s chin was resting on her chest. Her eyelids were closed but the eyes underneath appeared to be fluttering wildly. The discomfort at being seated next to Narcissa Malfoy was crackling. Her mudblood scar felt itchy and raw. Her legs felt restless in her seat. </p><p>Daphne felt Hermione’s unease and hovered a soft hand above Hermione’s own tightly clasped fist. She did not actually touch Hermione, perhaps Daphne knew that would be an unwelcome feeling or perhaps touching a muggleborn was too far beyond the limit of civility. Hermione looked up at her with mild annoyance and wondered what sort of silly game this was. </p><p>“I would like to know what I am doing here” Hermione said evenly. She wanted to be as calm as Daphne appeared to be. She wished she had the Slytherin talent for not showing her emotions. For some reason, Draco Malfoy’s stony face floated into her open mind as she thought this. </p><p>Daphne, seeming to sense that she could quickly lose Hermione’s patience, made a decision. She placed her smooth, unworked hand atop Hermione’s and patted it gently. Daphne smiled reassuringly and seemed to say with her whole body that “You are safe here.” While Hermione did not appreciate the subtle bit of emotional manipulation, she relented and relaxed her body a bit. </p><p>“I will not keep you long here. I know that the great Hermione Granger has never been one for long dalliances.” Hermione bristled at the unnecessary remark but remained silent. “To be honest, your business is not with me but with dear auntie who seems to be awake. I assure you that you will be intrigued if you’d stay a moment to listen.”</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy was stirring alongside her. Hermione, even more rankled that she had been duped into listening to the Malfoy woman, turned towards the older woman with narrowed eyes and a hand on her wand. Narcissa’s eyes were already appraising Hermione cautiously and they did not lose their edge when she realized the Hermione  was waiting for her to begin.</p><p> “I imagine Daphne has already welcomed you to tea and solicited the necessary pleasantries.” Hermione started at the brisk overture always remembering Narcissa as a genteel, though prejudiced, lady. Hermione had not expected the business like manner with which Mrs. Malfoy addressed the room. </p><p>“I’m sure you have heard that my son is no longer with us,” She began and Hermione attempted to stammer out a clunky condolence but was cut off as Narcissa continued, “Yes, yes thank you.”<br/>
“What almost no one knows is that an amulet- that I nor anyone in my circle can account for.” Mrs. Malfoy stumbled slightly over her words as if saying them caused her to trip. “It was found wrapped tightly around his neck”. She finished out in a dignified rush. At Hermione’s stunned face, Daphnee quickly interjected.</p><p>“Draco left the world by his own means. The amulet was not used as a weapon. Auntie only meant that it was a choker style necklace.” Hermione nodded warily.</p><p> She could only wonder at what emotional pain had caused the young man to die by suicide. The wording also struck her, “left by his own means”. Hermione had heard various descriptions of completing suicide but that turn of phrase felt malingering. Wrong.</p><p>Narcissa continued where she had left off as if reading from a practiced script. Hermione found her steady resolve to finish her difficult story admirably sad. No parent should have to discuss the disturbing details of child’s death, especially to a young woman she barely knew or tolerated. Hermione could only wonder at how important this must be to Narcissa to reach out to Hermione of all people. </p><p>“The amulet is of no origin that I could trace. I have had little luck understanding its properties or significance. I know that you spent some years training as an unspeakable but did not manage to complete your training.” Hermione clenched her jaw at yet another unnecessary slight but felt Daphne’s pleading eyes on her. </p><p>“Yes, I did pursue that career for a time” Hermione stated in a clipped voice.</p><p>Narcissa blinked dismissively and said in a dry tone, “I wasn’t insinuating anything by it Ms. Granger. I was only stating common knowledge. '' Hermione remained silent.</p><p>Waving a hand, she went on. “My attempts to reach out to the Unspeakeables has been most difficult and I fear rather fruitless. I had hoped that your experience with them could be of service.They may look into it if you were to bring to them”.</p><p>“What makes you think the amulet is an item that would need to be researched by the Unspeakeables? Even if I were willing to use my contacts as you insinuate, they’d hardly stop their work for such a request.” Hermione sniffed knowingly. </p><p>Narcissa narrowed her eyes like an eagle ready to pounce and Daphne cut in. “Our personal acquaintances cannot guess at its primary function or origin. We have been assured that the amulet exudes strong magic and was forged by creature of great power. The Malfoy family has an extensive purse collection of rare magical gemstones, literature and artifacts as you can no doubt guess. Naturally, they like many great families also have thorough records and ledgers detailing the collection’s contents and uses.”</p><p>“Naturally”, Hermione said dryly.</p><p>“Despite the ministries attempts to deplete them after that skirmish” Daphne continued bitterly. </p><p>Hermione held back a growl. “Voldemort’s war was certainly not a skirmish” she said hotly. The privilege of such people was ingratiating. </p><p>Narcissa smoothly cut the tension before it was able to build between the two young women. “I’d like to focus on my son.” Both women turned toward her and she continued. “There were no records of Draco purchasing what must be a rare charm in our banking ledgers and there is no explanation for such a thing to be on his person. It took several hours and numerous spells for the amulet to unclasp from his neck. I must know what it means.” </p><p>“That is very odd” Hermione agreed with alarm, “however I cannot be sure that will be a priority for the Unspeakables”. </p><p>Narcissa looked crestfallen and began clenching her hands. Hermione feared that Narcissa may begin to sob, “But, I will reach out to my contacts to inquire”. Hermione finished limply. </p><p>Narcissa and Daphne looked relieved and slightly surprised. Daphne, as if afraid Hermione would change her mind, gestured to Narcissa to reveal something. Narcissa, with trembling fingers, reached into her pockets and produced red velvet box of exceptional quality. Hermione looked at with trepidation as Narcissa opened the small box. Inside lay a small necklace- too small to comfortably lay on a man’s neck but too large to be a bracelet. The necklace itself was made of spun gold that was weaved into circular patterns and thin lines. It reminded her of something a gothic heroine would wear on the cover of an old novel. At the base of the necklace sat a large bead made of swirling blacks, golds, reds and oranges. The colors moved and mixed on their own accord as if someone had scooped up an active potion and bottled it up in a glass container. She had never seen anything like it. The shifts and swivels of the colors happened at random and she found herself mesmerized by its unknowable pattern. In the back of her mind, she felt a sense of cold panic and a deep pressure on her spin as if the garden’s gravity had intensified. </p><p>WIth a snap, Narcissa closed the box and the pressuring sensation was gone. Hermione shivered. Her curiosity had never been more piqued. She felt that old burning return to her: that zeal to uncover buried knowledge. The drive to shed light on the unknowable that carried her into the library stacks for hours on end. She felt Daphne looking at her with a knowing smirk. She cursed her open features. They had her and they knew it. </p><p>“Before I can allow auntie to release something so precious to a relative stranger, I must inquire about my note. More specifically, I must ask you to stamp the sealing wax.” Daphne said cooly. Daphne knew she’d gained the upper hand. </p><p>Hermione remembered the note in her pocket with the untouched gummy substance. She felt cold under the warm summer sun. She produced the letter and tossed it on the garden table. “I know perfectly well that it is no ordinary sealing wax. What is it for?</p><p>“It is an ordinary sealing wax. You muggles stole the look of it without understanding its meaning.” Narcissa said as though speaking to a child.</p><p>“Sealing wax has been used for centuries to ensure that a certain level of trust amongst parties could be well... sealed” Daphne finished, “It only means that you intend to return the amulet to its rightful owner upon completion of the analysis and any other subsequent discoveries. And that any said discoveries would be promptly relayed to the Malfoys without any personal usage by yourself unless in pursuit of the amulet’s origins. We would not want any unsavory details released to the general public without our approval.” </p><p>Hermione bristled at the insinuation that she would steal anything or release any salacious details like a common Rita Skeeter.</p><p>“We do not mean any offense Miss Granger. You must understand the precarious situation we purebloods are in these days. Our every move is exploited, tracked and reported on to a hungry populace salivating at our  bloodied expense. I cannot allow my son’s memory to be used even more against him anymore than it already has. '' Narcissa looked terrified and pleading. </p><p>“This sealing wax will also ensure you that we will appropriately compensate and protect you during this interval.” Hermione screwed up her mouth at the protection caveat. </p><p>“If you would feel more comfortable, you can create the incantation for the wax. It is inactive until the incantation is complete. It will solidify only after the words have been said. Hermione looked over at the red box and she felt an excitement stir in her that she feared was long dead. She nodded jerkily at the two expectant faces. The bargain was struck.</p>
