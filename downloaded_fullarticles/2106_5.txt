  <strong>Y/N's PoV</strong>
</p><p>I am a peculiar. I live in Miss Peregrine's loop. I have the power to make people live in their worst nightmare, or their greatest fantasy. My power was great as I could manipulate the images, but terrible as I had to see everything.</p><p>"Are you serious, Emma? You can't possibly like him. He's ignorant. He'll get us all killed." Enoch's voice booms through the room. Emma stands a few feet away from Enoch, Millard behind her. Enoch was yelling, beyond pissed at the appearance of Jake.</p><p>"No. You'll get us killed yelling like that. What do you think Miss Peregrine will say?"</p><p>"Why should I care? He shouldn't be here. He's not peculiar. He's ordinary. Do you want him to be like Abe?" Emma looks taken aback, and stays silent. "Am I finally getting it through your head? You thought Abe was going to stay here and love you, and look how that turned out." Enoch's voice gets louder with each word until he is all but screaming.</p><p>"Stop it, Enoch. He was your friend too. Shut up," she chokes out. A tear streams down Emma's face. Her eyes dart around for a way out, but the only door is behind Enoch.</p><p>"No. You shut up and listen. He doesn't belong here. He left tonight, and you think he's coming back to help us. He's coming back to get you. He wants to fuck you." My mouth drops at Enoch's words. Miss Peregrine had banned any vulgar language from the house.</p><p>"Oh, get over it. All of you. I said a bad word. What's going to happen to me? It's the truth." His voice has lowered to his normal tone. "You think he would come back here to spend time with us - with freaks - for fun?" His voice breaks. "You think he doesn't want anything from us?"</p><p>"Enoch, it's not like that. He's here because of Abe. He wants to know about him," Millard says.</p><p>"He wants to know about the man that left all of us and got himself killed? The man who was in love with Emma as well. None of you see the connection here?"</p><p>"I do," I say. Emma turns to look at me, betrayal on her face. "He has a point, Emma. Think about it." Enoch turns to look at me, and I notice just how angry he is.</p><p>"I'm not listening to this," Emma growls. Her anger was starting to show through. Enoch had the worst and shortest temper of all of us. He scoffs.</p><p>"Fine. Walk out of here and run away from the truth," he shouts after her as she slams the door. Millard had walked out several minutes before, leaving the two of us alone in the attic. He growls, turns, and slams his fist into the wall. The wood splinters around it, and blood trickles down his fist.</p><p>"God damn it," he shouts, hitting the wall again. More blood. More broken wood. He swings again and again until the blood starts dripping down the walls.</p><p>"Enoch, please stop," I beg. I couldn't sit there and watch him rip himself apart.</p><p>"I'm sick of it, Y/N. Everyone thinks I'm a joke. They think I'm jealous." His fist hits the wall again.</p><p>"I...I don't," I whisper, afraid he'll hit me next.</p><p>"Don't lie to me," he screams, turning toward me. I fall onto the ground, my arms moving to cover my face. Enoch had never hit me, but I had been friends with him for years, and I knew he was uncontrollable. I feel his weight land on my chest, almost like he was tackling me. He pulls my arms away from my face with one hand, and brings his other one back to hit me.</p><p>I let out a strangled whine, trying desperately not to cry. I open my eyes when I don't feel a hit. Enoch straddles me, his face buried in his hands.</p><p>"Y/N, I'm sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean to." He reaches a hand out to touch my hand, but stops when he sees me struggle. He rolls off me. I hear a muffled sob tear from his throat.</p><p>"Enoch?" I whisper. In all our years of friendship, I had never seen him cry. Not when Victor died. Not when Abe left. Never. I look over at him, and see he's laying on his stomach, face to the floor. Blood still drips from his fists. I hesitantly reach my hand out to him, lying it on his shoulder. "Relax," I say as I feel him tense.</p><p>I push myself into his mind, trying to find his happiest thoughts. Something that would make him forget about the hatred, just for a minute. Not many of his memories were happy. Flashes of before he was here, working in the morge, fill my head. To get to the best parts, everything he had experienced, I had to experience too.</p><p>I try to shut my eyes, not wanting to see most parts. Not wanting to see him getting beaten by parents and bullies. Not wanting to see him cry, hurt himself and others. I just wanted something good. I also knew everything I was seeing, he was also seeing. Then, I hit something. Him meeting me. A smile on his face, a real one.</p><p>"St..op," he stutters out.</p><p>"We're almost to something good. You'll feel better," I soothe.</p><p>"Just stop. Before you see it."</p><p>"See what?" I ask, curiosity getting the better of me. The feelings flooding through me were actual happiness, things Enoch had felt before.</p><p>"Before you see..." His voice trails off. "That," he whispers. I can't talk as everything rushes over me. I feel him try to pull my hand off him, but I kept it there, wanting to finish his fantasy. Pure pleasure rushes through me as I see the images. Things Enoch had imagined. Me, bent over his bed. Me, sucking him off. Me, touching him everywhere imaginable. He lets out a whimper next to me as he sees them too.</p><p>"Enoch?" I say. I pull my hand off him, regaining my own feelings. The fantasy runs through my head as I look at him. He lays on his side now, but rolls onto his back and stares at the ceiling. I grab one of his bloody, hurt hands. "Is this the one you use?" His breathing stops temporarily as he processes what I said.</p><p>"W...what?" His usual confidence was gone, replaced with a nervous boy instead.</p><p>"Is this the hand you use to please yourself?" I wrap my fingers in his. His eyes glance over at me.</p><p>"I'm sorry. Just listen an-" I press my finger against his lips, silencing him.</p><p>"I want to feel it." He swallows heavily, his eyes finally locking with mine. I roll over, putting myself on top of him so I'm straddling his waist. I ignore the half hard bulge in his pants as I look down at him. I press my fingers against his face, slowly trailing them down his skin. I start pulling up my shirt, but his hands stop me.</p><p>"You don't have to. You know that, right?" he asks. I nod my head, pulling my shirt off. His eyes roam over my chest, and he lets out a groan upon seeing my breasts. He moves his hands up, his cold skin running along my hot flesh. His hands cup my breasts, squeezing them. He pulls me down, bringing his tongue out to touch my nipples.</p><p>A shudder runs through me as he brings one of my nipples into his mouth, running his teeth along it. His hands move down my back, dipping into the waistband of my pants. I feel his hands touch my ass, gripping the flesh. His tongue starts licking my chest, making me let out quiet moans.<br/>
He tugs at my pants, pulling them partway down.</p><p>"Take them off," he growls, his hand slapping my ass. I stand up, bending over to slowly pull the fabric down my legs. I hear him move behind me, but think nothing of it. I let out a scream as something wet touches my ass. Enoch kneels behind me, his face buried in my flesh. His fingers touch my thigh, parting my folds as his tongue dips into me. My knees almost buckle at the feeling.</p><p>He falls backward, taking me with him. He lands on his back, and I land on his chest. He smirks at me, grabbing my legs and pulling me closer. He moves me until I'm on his face, riding his tongue. His tongue licks up my slit before circling my hole and dipping into it. He roughly takes my clit into his mouth, biting down on it with enough force to make me scream his name.</p><p>His arms wrap around my legs, holding me tightly against him. I push my fingers into his hair, gripping onto him tightly. A coil in my stomach is painfully building.</p><p>"I feel weird," I whimper.</p><p>"You're fine, Y/N. Just let it go," Enoch whispers beneath me. His voice is muffled against my soaking core. I lean back, my hand landing on his toned stomach. He groans, and I realize how close I am to his cock. I snake my hand down, palming him through the cloth of his trousers. I had never had sex before, so I was just doing what felt natural. His arms tighten on my legs. He sucks harder on my clit, making my vision go white.</p><p>"Enoch," I scream out as pleasure rips through my body. It takes me awhile before I get my senses back. I'm still positioned on Enoch's face.</p><p>"You like that, baby?" he purrs.</p><p>"Yes," I whisper, still trying to catch my breath. He flips us over, slamming my back into the wooden floor. He hovers over me, pressing his wet lips against mine. The kiss is huried and hard, like he's been waiting forever. I feel his tongue sweep over my lips, and my lips spread open. His tongue starts exploring my mouth. I can taste myself on him, and the pressure in my stomach ignites again.</p><p>We pull apart, both of us panting. He looks beyond hot above me. His eyes are darkened more than usual with lust. His hair is covered in sweat and thrown everywhere. His face is wet from my juices, so I run my tongue along his face, cleaning him off. The bulge in his pants is more prominent now, pressing against my stomach as he presses our bodies closer.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to keep going?" he asks, pressing his forehead against mine.</p><p>"Yes. Please," I say. My lips are barely an inch away from his. I wrap my arms around his neck, pulling him flush against me as I lock our lips together. He fiddles with his belt, and pulls down his trousers. I yank at his shirt, breaking the kiss so I can pull it over his head. I moan at the sight of him shirtless. His skin is tanned and toned. A v line leads down into his boxers. I reach my hand inside, wrapping my fingers around his length. He hisses as the cold air touches him.</p><p>I run my fingers up his shaft, collecting precum with my thumb. I lock eyes with him as I bring my thumb into my mouth, sucking on it. He grunts, obviously enjoying the scene in front of him. I push his chest, and he easily falls onto his back. I crawl on top of him, shedding him of the last of his clothing.</p><p>"You...uh....dont have to do that if you don't want to," Enoch says as I get lower on his body. I touch my tongue to the under side of his cock, and hum in appreciation. His hips move slightly upward at the feel. I wrap my lips around him, bobbing my head lightly up and down.</p><p>"I think I want to," I moan. My words are obviously unintelligible as they are muffled by the organ in my mouth. Enoch doesn't seem to care. He hesitantly puts his fingers in my hair. I look up at him as I start taking him deeper, seeing his eyes are closed and a look of pure pleasure is on his face. He starts moving me up and down, in sync with his hip thrusts.</p><p>He hits the back of my throat, and I try not to gag. He holds me there, letting me take in his scent and taste. His flesh was salty, completely different from his lips and mouth. He pulls me off of him, dragging me by the hair to his lip to kiss me.</p><p>"I need to be in you," he growls. His voice is deep and sexy. He grabs my wrist and pulls me up. He slams my back into a table, and it creaks in protest as it takes my weight. He pushes me fully onto it, pulling my legs apart. He pumps himself in his hand before lining up with my soaking entrance. His lips find my neck as he pushes into me.</p><p>"Ow. Ow. Enoch, it hurts. It hurts," I cry out. The pain was horrendous. I wanted to push through because I knew what it meant to Enoch, but it felt like my insides were being ripped out.</p><p>"Hey. It gets better. Just give it a minute," he says. He continues sucking on my neck. The pain in me starts to lessen.</p><p>"You can move," I whisper. He kisses my lips, and slowly rocks his hips. Pain courses through me, and I squeeze the table. He grabs my hands and puts them on his shoulders. He moves more, pulling himself almost all the way out of me before pushing back in. My nails sink into his back. He's moving painfully slow, and I know he wants to go faster.</p><p>I rock my hips against his, hoping he'll move. Everything still hurt, but this might speed it up. He nibbles on my ear, starting to thrust into me. He sets a pace, still slow. He bites down on my neck, hard enough that I'm sure he drew blood. His tongue darts out and laps at the wound, making me moan out. I can feel his cocky smirk against my skin.</p><p>"Lord, you are hot like this," he purrs. His voice drips like melted chocolate. He bucks his hips forward, stretching me every way possible. My nails sink deeper into his flesh as he starts to move faster, each time pounding into me harder. The pain is replaced with indescribable pleasure.</p><p>"I'm not going to last much longer," I moan out. The same coil was tightening in my stomach painfully, begging to be released.</p><p>"Well then cum for me, baby girl," he growls in my ear. I scream his name as my orgasm hits me like a truck. My senses seem to be nothing. All I can feel is Enoch pounding into me as I experience the best kind of pleasure. He pulls out, and flips me over, pulling me part way off the table. He pushes himself back in, filling me in a different way. My chest rubs against the wood of the table painfully, yet it adds to the pleasure building in me once more.</p><p>I can hear him pant, his balls slapping against my skin. His muscular arms wrap around my waist, holding me closer than I thought possible to Enoch. I can feel the sweat drip down my back. His mouth nips at my neck once more, obviously needing more to do.</p><p>"I'm almost done," he groans, picking up speed. His once organized thrusts are now sloppy. They no longer have a rhythm. I reach backward, grabbing his head and bring him to my lips. I slip my tongue into his mouth, needing to taste him as I came one last time. He pulls away, his hand slapping my ass. I let out a whimper at the feeling.</p><p>"One last time. Come on, Y/N." His voice is difficult to understand as he is practically out of air at this point. "Cum around me, baby girl." I slam my fist into the table as my last orgasm slams through me. He freezes behind me, and I feel a warmth spread through me before he pulls out again. He hits the wall beside me, panting for air.</p><p>"You're...uh...good," I say.</p><p>"Good? That's what you call that?" His usual cocky self was returning.</p><p>"Well, I guess it was a bit better than good." I pause. "Now, how's your anger doing?"</p><p>"Wait, that was because I was angry? Man, I need to get mad more."</p>
