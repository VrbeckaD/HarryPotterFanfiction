<p>Crazy Christmas</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Harry,” said Draco, keeping his voice soft. “What in the name of Circe and Morgana is that hanging over the mantel?” </p>
<p>Harry coughed, “Luna likes to make homemade gifts and Christmas decorations.” He smiled weakly. “I think that’s a Christmas wreath made of lettuce.” He frowned. “Or maybe cabbages.”</p>
<p>“Cabbages,” Draco said flatly. He blinked, unsure he was actually seeing what he clearly <i>was</i>. “And are those…radishes and cumquats?” </p>
<p>“I think so?” Harry shrugged. “I did mention how the Lovegoods are different when it comes to the holidays, didn’t I?” </p>
<p>Draco snorted. “There’s different and then there’s fucking gone.”</p>
<p>“Shh!” hushed Harry. “Try to be nice.” </p>
<p>“Nice?” Draco hummed. “I’ve not climbed up onto the mantel and tried to <i>eat</i> the Christmas wreath, have I? I’d say that’s nice given the options on the buffet table.” </p>
<p>Harry sighed. “If you’re good, we can stop and get some chicken tikka on the way home.” </p>
<p>Draco brightened immediately. “Now that sounds like a plan.” He glanced over at the drinks. “Looks like there’s tea over there, that should be safe enough—”</p>
<p>“No!” Harry grabbed his arm. “Trust me,” he hissed. “<i>Never</i> drink tea made by a Lovegood.” </p>
<p>Draco winced. “Right. We can’t drink, we can’t eat, and we can’t mock the decorations. What exactly can we do at this party, Harry?” </p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Just…pretend to enjoy yourself, all right?” He grinned. I thought you pure-blood types grew up learning how to fake enjoying yourselves at parties?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” drawled Draco, “I can fake just about anything, Harry. After all, Weasley and Granger think I like them these days—”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “I happen to know you and Ron get along fine, and you love Hermione.” </p>
<p>Draco smirked. “As I said, I can fake anything.” </p>
<p>“You are horrible.” Harry poked him with his elbow and Draco winced. </p>
<p>“Ouch! There’s no need to assault me, Harry.” Draco pasted a smile to his face. “Happy Christmas, Mr Lovegood. Lovely party.” </p>
<p>“Thank you, Draco. Hello, Harry.” Lovegood leaned in. “And don’t you worry about the Nargles, boys. My Luna’s taking care of them.” </p>
<p>“I figured as much,” said Harry, smiling brightly. “If you’ll excuse us, we’re should say hello to those people over there.” </p>
<p>“That wasn’t very subtle,” murmured Draco as Harry dragged him away. “And what the fuck is a Nargle?”</p>
<p>“No idea, and subtlety is lost on Mr Lovegood.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “Unless you’d rather we stay and listen to his theory on imaginary creatures?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you.” Draco shuddered. “How long do we have to stay?” </p>
<p>“We should at least say hello to Luna.” </p>
<p>“Oh, hello, Harry. Draco.” </p>
<p>Draco and Harry spun around to see Luna standing behind them, a brightly wrapped package in her hands. “I made this for you.” </p>
<p>“Er, thanks.” Harry accepted the present gingerly. </p>
<p>Draco eyed the wrapping, which depicted a ferret and a stag frolicking together. He blinked, checking it more closely. It looked like the stag and the ferret were getting into some rather intimate activity. “Are they—?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Luna, smiling vacantly. “They really like to shag. Charming the paper was fun. Oh, the gift is homemade, too. I think you’ll like it.”</p>
<p>After she’d wandered off, Draco looked at Harry. “I’m not sure whether I should be intrigued or horrified.” </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “I’m frequently both when it comes to Luna, so welcome to my world.” He tucked the gift into his pocket. </p>
<p>“Are we actually going to open that?” Draco muttered as Harry steered him towards the door. </p>
<p>“We should know what it is so when she asks us how we liked it later we’ll know how to reply,” said Harry. </p>
<p>“That’s fair. Although, given the wrapping paper, I’m a bit scared to see what’s inside.” </p>
<p>Laughing, Harry slid his arm around Draco’s waist. “Don’t worry. I’ll protect you from anything too scary.” </p>
<p>“And if it’s a stag sized dildo?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised. </p>
<p>Harry grinned. “Since when do you need protecting from that?”</p>
<p>Draco hummed. “Fair point. Right, I’m for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Agreed.” Harry patted his pocket. “And perhaps we’ll even have dessert.” </p>
