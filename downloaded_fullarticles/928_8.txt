  <strong>Blaise Zabini</strong>
</p><p align="left">Young.</p><p align="left">He was young.</p><p align="left">Blaise knew this, as it was one of the most common things people liked to remind him about. 'Oh dear, you're too young to understand,' they would say with close-mouthed smiles.</p><p align="left">Fake.</p><p align="left">Fake smiles. Fake platitudes. Fake people.</p><p align="left">Everything in his life was fake.</p><p align="left">His mother was the only exception to that. She told him nothing but the truth. How his father had died (by her hand), what she did for money (fashion design... and kill her many husbands), and why people liked him (his money).</p><p align="left">Blaise learned as much as he could from his mother and then rejected every one of her teachings on how to get ahead in life.</p><p align="left">He had no friends amongst the Italian purebloods that his mother would shove him at when she wanted to go out and drink wine with her 'friends'.</p><p align="left">No, he was alone.</p><p align="left">Except... there was one who kept him company. </p><p align="left">The girl in the book.</p><p align="left">Blaise only had one book that was not from the library, where there were only dusty tomes that weighed more than him and gross moth-infested scrolls. His book was clean, with a cover that shimmered like it was made of silver, and it detailed the life of a princess.</p><p align="left">'Snow White' the book was named and Blaise never let his mother even be in the same room as it, for fear of losing it. (Not that Safrina Zabini liked to venture across the manor to where his rooms were, no that was too much work and she could just call him via house-elf.) And though the book was repetitive and fairly simple, it gave him hope.</p><p align="left">A beautiful girl, emboldened to run away and start an adventure, saved by a handsome prince who she then loved forever?</p><p align="left">Well, his mother sometimes called him 'her little prince'... so maybe one day a beautiful and smart and kind princess would love him forever, unlike his father, that had tried to kill his mother when she was pregnant with him, hence the man's death.</p><p align="left">His mother had always been a fast dueler.</p><p align="left">He swore to himself he would not follow the path of bitter vengeance on the opposite sex his mother danced down, nor the insanity his father had supposedly drunkenly stumbled down. He would be better than them. Worthy of the title of 'Lord Zabini'.</p><p align="left">And yet it was hard not to withdraw from the world more and more with every year that passed, every lonely birthday with his house-elf passed by with no friends.</p><p align="left">With each year, the princess in the storybook got a little less realistic.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">By the time Blaise had grown to be eleven, his letter to Hogwarts (and a few other schools) having shown up, his mother had gone through five husbands. </p><p align="left">So when he chose the British school because it was the furthest away from what his mother wanted (and from her in general), he felt no shame in disappointing her. Not when he'd had to memorize a whole string of violin and piano pieces for every new wedding his mother had made him be the ring bearer and entertainment for. Not when his fingers had bled for something that he hated.</p><p align="left">However, when he actually walked through the international floo, then was led through the cramped streets of England's magical market... he wondered if in his spite he'd made a mistake. </p><p align="left">His mother, he knew, was looking for this weakness though, so he kept his head up and his stride measured.</p><p align="left">First were robes.</p><p align="left">The door rang softly when opened, the bell above it jingling merrily and he decided he hated this shop already. Well, until he was told to move to the platform for measurements and he saw her.</p><p align="left">Looking over in apathetic curiosity to see if the person next to him was as uncomfortable with the invasive tape measure as he was, he stilled when his eyes fell upon the long black hair spilling down the back of a slender frame like rippling shadows. With skin like the honey that the cook always got fresh and eyes like the emeralds in his mother's favorite necklace, the girl was...</p><p align="left">Imaginary.</p><p align="left">She had to be- some delusion of boredom that had come to him, playing on those dreams of a princess from the book he'd found.</p><p align="left">But her eyes said differently. Not that she wasn't a princess- oh she definitely was- but that she wasn't real. Because even if she was standing completely still as if blinking would show her to be just an illusion, but her gleaming green eyes were darting around as if studying everyone in the room for possible flaws.</p><p align="left">He felt so inadequate...that he didn't even notice her plain and worn clothes. (He would remember later and frown for a while before brushing it off as her guardians being improper and not knowing how to deal with a lady.) </p><p align="left">"How do you stand so still?" The words slipped out before he could stop them and before he could pretend that he never said anything, those piercing eyes stilled and then slid right to him.</p><p align="left">Blaise had never felt more captivated, held in place, by a single stare.</p><p align="left">"How do you fidget so much?" The girl's voice was soft, bearly a mutter, voice smooth but so very cold.</p><p align="left">Falling back on his nonchalant act that he'd picked up from his mother like it was as easy as breathing, he grinned. "I'm impatient and I hate shopping."</p><p align="left">The girl's eyes slid away from him as if she'd seen such a thing a million times. </p><p align="left">As if she was painfully bored with him.</p><p align="left">As if she could see right through his act.</p><p>Her voice was flat. Uninterested like no one else had ever been to him. "I guess that means I’m more patient than you." </p><p align="left">Unnerved, he couldn't seem to take his eyes off the strange princess. </p><p align="left">
  <em>Had she seen through him? No one saw through him! They all just bowed at his feet, ready to be shoved to the side like all the other boring people around him!</em>
</p><p align="left">When both their tape measures were done, he immediately shoved his hand out. "Blaise Zabini, House of Zabini."</p><p align="left">The girl looked him over, slowly and critically, as if she knew exactly how he'd broken composure and was wondering just how to smear his name to all her friends.</p><p align="left">Then, to his surprise, her small warm hand curled around his. "Lena Farland. Demon of St. Judes."</p><p align="left">
  <em>Lena. Her name was- Wait. What? Demon?</em>
</p><p align="left">Instinctively his eyebrows furrowed, not understanding the girl's obvious joke, as she smiled at him as if he'd failed at figuring out her puzzle and thus made a fool of himself. Then she turned and walked to the counter, finalizing her purchase herself.</p><p align="left">But before he could go after her, try to understand what her parting statement had meant, try to understand- his mother curled a clawed hand over his shoulder. "Make a new friend, dear?"</p><p align="left">"Yes." He knew better to be this uncomposed around his mother, collecting himself and strolling with her to the fabrics, unable to stop himself from glancing at the girl at the counter. "Lena Farland. She looks to be a lady."</p><p align="left">His mother's laugh was short and cruel- sort of like the smile the girl had given him- and he knew he was in for another 'life lesson', her hand tightening on his shoulder. "The Farlands are an old family of soldiers and though they are <em>notable</em> to some families, to us they are nothing but <em>cannon-fodder</em>. Come now. We have to get you an owl."</p><p align="left">Even as he let his mother lead him away, the words <em>'cannon- fodder' </em>rung out in his head, mocking him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Shopping was bland.</p><p align="left">His mother had let him chose Hogwarts, but that was only because for all extents and purposes she still controlled every part of his life otherwise. She chose his clothes, books, trunk, owl- Merlin she even chose his <em>parchment</em>.</p><p align="left">So when Lord Nott, an old man with shifty dark eyes and greying hair that apparently knew his mother somehow joined them and the two of them started to talk, he basically zoned everything out. Plus, the old man gave him a cold and dark vibe he wasn't sure he liked and had no plans to make good with him anytime soon.</p><p align="left">When his mother was done with shopping for him, they dragged him to some old wand shop that Lord Nott insisted was the best in Britain.</p><p align="left">Again he was basically shoved through a door, but this time not only did he not notice the bell, but he was so focused on where a white-haired man was looking at the girl from the shop- Lena- with critical eyes that he didn't notice there was another boy his age near him.</p><p align="left">Lena was holding a short ashen white wand, still and staring right back at the old man as if waiting for something.</p><p align="left">"Yew with one of the only cores of magical ice that I’ve ever successfully made. Ten inches, more than a bit stiff… Made especially for someone who will do whatever they want and could care less about the consequences."</p><p align="left">Magical ice, Blaise knew was a rare wonder- said to be unmeltable and very hard to get one's hands on.</p><p align="left">He wondered what it was doing in the hands of this girl for only a second, before admitting to himself that if anyone's hands, hers was probably the most likely.</p><p align="left">"Are those words from you or Jack?" Lena's tone was measured, seeming actually curious for the barest of seconds before a crooked and slightly broken smile flickered across her lips for the barest of moments, shaking her head slightly as if to clear it of something ridiculous. "Nevermind. I don't care either way. How much do I owe you?"</p><p align="left">“All I want is a promise you’ll never point that wand in my direction.” </p><p align="left">The old man sounded serious and by the way he noticed his mother's eyes widen out of the corner of his eyes, he wondered if she was mentally rethinking her earlier comment about the girl.</p><p align="left">Nodding, as the girl was acknowledging she was such a threat the man was right to be afraid, the girl gave a soft chuckle under her breath. “Very well. Say hello to the old man, as I’m sure you’ll see him before I do.”</p><p align="left">Blaise blinked. <em>Was her father... dead?</em></p><p align="left">The girl turned on her heel, once again leveling that piercing gaze on him for a long moment before seeming to look at the others with the same critical eyes. “Excuse me.” </p><p align="left">"Lena." The old white-haired man's face was curled into a frown. </p><p align="left">The girl stopped but didn't look back, as if she didn't actually care but did it for the sake of some semblance of social niceties.</p><p align="left">"Jack loved you like a father."</p><p align="left">The message was soft and heartfelt, but all the girl did was scoff softly and then walk out.</p><p align="left">He wondered how many times she would walk away from him before he was able to be in her presence or actually talk to her without feeling like an idiot.</p><p align="left">
  <em>Probably more than a few.</em>
</p><p align="left">His mother leaned down, voice a quiet whisper next to his ear and he ignored the other boy his age finding his wand in order to listen to her. "I will only say this once. I only knew two other people with that girl's magical power and a yew wand. One whose name I refuse to say while in the same shop as Lord Nott, less risk my head, and the other? Gellert Grindelwald." For the first time in what he felt like was forever, his mother's voice wavered slightly, even if it was just for a breath. "Be watchful of that girl, a Farland or not."</p><p align="left">Nodding, he neglected to tell his mother that he'd planned to do that with or without her instruction.</p><p align="left">She was, after all, his princess.</p><p align="left">It didn't matter if her eyes were the color of death or her lithe fingers would probably rather dig into his ribcage so she could pull out his heart- she was a princess.</p><p align="left">Of what... he had yet to see.</p>
