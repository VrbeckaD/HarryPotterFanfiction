    <p>The first thing… there are many first things. Still, it was dark and warm and you dreamed. Dreamed until it became a nightmare. Dark and claustrophobic – walls caving in around you – pressure squeezing at you, and then lights (so bright) and noise (harsh) and you’re screaming. It’s cold and you’re wet and you keep screaming. Nothing makes sense.</p>
<p>	You’re not stupid though – this is a thing not meant to have happened. You… have just been born?</p>
<p>	It’s not so bad, you think. You are going to be so far ahead of the curve. However, you’d previously heard of baby brain in the context of pregnant women… your brain really is a baby’s.  Your emotions are all over the place, and you have no motor control. None of these are things you want to remember, normally these things get blocked out, right? Is that going to happen to the rest of your memories too? Will this be it? Who are you without your memories?</p>
<p>	You are horrified when you put enough together.  Your mother, red hair, Lily. Father, dark hair, glasses, James. You, Harry. Magic. You’ve been reborn as Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Your parents are going to die, you’ll grow up neglected and unloved and you have to suicide to defeat the Dark Lord. Shit. You try to do your best to communicate – Peter equals bad, even as you have a side of – is this really the best option? Should you let things play out as written? Should you try to change things? What if you make them worse? Shit, you’re going to die at Halloween, at the Dursleys, at Hogwarts – troll, jinxed broom, Fluffy, Quirrell…</p>
<p>	Still, you have a year of being loved. Right? One Halloween with Lily and James, mum and dad. A year and some to figure out a way to save them – to work on being able to speak, to let them know there is a traitor and it's Peter fucking Pettigrew. </p>
<p>	You’re wrong. Shit you are so wrong. Halloween, and you’re three months old - “Lily, take Harry and run!” and already… already you know. You reach for your mum – and you’re crying silently – murmured words and He’s here. </p>
<p>	“Not Harry. Take me instead.” Green light. And then Lily, mum, falls. He turns to face you. You glare, because what else can you do? Maybe you die here, and Harry continues the story as it’s meant. </p>
<p>	“Avada Kedavra” Green light. And you know no more.</p>
