    <p align="left">                                                                               </p><p>Harry stood at the king cross station pondering about the nightmares he was having from the past few months. His eyes yearned for his best mates but instead to his bad luck there with his perfect blonde hair stood the greatest git in the world “Malfoy”. To call him the bane of his existence would become the understatement of the century, that boy, NO, that rich bastard always managed to ignite unadulterated hatred in him.</p><p>As harry walked ahead feigning indifference, he realized he did not hear the familiar “scar head” or the malevolent sarcastic voice and without a thought he looked back at the spot where “Malfoy” had stood. For the first time in years he saw the git with a genuine smile on his face talking with Zabini. The sight left Harry perplexed and with a sour mood.</p><p>The Patel twins moving past him like a train made him lose his balance. “Sorry, Harry” they said in unison before disappearing in the crowd.</p><p>That’s alright, he replied not allowing his bad mood to get the best of him.</p><p>As harry walked to his usual compartment, he couldn’t help but remember the pleasant memories of his short stay with Sirius. It had been brilliant in every way, even though they had to spend most of their time at the cold Grimmauld Palace in the company of a very loud annoying portrait. With that came the memory of Pettigrew and the shrieking shack reminding him that Voldemort’s shadow was still following him.</p><p>Before Dark thoughts could cloud his vision, he found himself in the warm embrace of Hermione and he would have said something if not for the fear of her bushy hair attacking him.</p><p>Harry!  How are you? said Hermione brimming with excitement before she noticed the frown tugging her best friend’s lips.</p><p>What happened? her voice immediately filling with concern.</p><p>Nothing, nothing happened, he re-assured her, though his words felt flat to his own ears.</p><p>He looked at a red Ron who had failed to utter a single word to him since his arrival, “did I make him angry?” he thought.</p><p>What’s wrong, Ron? You seem a bit shaken asked harry a bit cautiously.</p><p>Well, did Ginny tell you that I ate the cupcakes which mom had made for you? Ron said sheepishly.</p><p>You Ronald Weasley are unbelievable, said Hermione enraged and smiling at the same time.</p><p>Harry started cracking up and his best mates followed pursuit, in that moment he felt well and fine knowing that he had the best people in the world as his friends. Maybe hoping for a normal Hogwarts year was not that far fetched after all.</p><p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, Cho appeared with her friends leaving harry panicky and breathless at the same time. Hermione as observant as always gave Harry a knowing smile before walking away.</p><p>Who am I kidding? He said to no one in particular.</p><p>The picture of Malfoy flashed to his mind, stealing the small smile he had gained a few minutes ago.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Draco had not only just seen Harry Potter but also completely snubbed him without any of his usual sneering or jabbing which meant either Pansy was losing her mind staying in the company of world’s greatest idiots or the world was coming to an end. Neither of her explanation extinguished the desire to know WHAT THE HELL WAS HAPPENING? Her mind moving in circles always came back to the same question.</p><p>Any other ordinary bloke might have lost the feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment, when scrutinized at the hands of Slytherin’s best detective. But today Draco felt invincible and refused to be anything but happy in this situation.</p><p>Is there a reason? you can’t take your eyes off me, Pansy dear said Draco haughtily, which made Pansy snort and Blaise roll his eyes simultaneously.</p><p>Oh, come on, the wizarding world knows how charming we ‘Malfoys’ are.</p><p>True, you are one hell of a candy, Draco darling but do you have any idea why Zabini here is adamant on avoiding me? She said viciously.</p><p>I’m not avoiding anyone said Blaise, his serenity and peace infecting the people around him.</p><p>What are you trying to prove Zabini, she said bitingly.</p><p>Blaise with a solid hold on his emotions did not even care to look at pansy and resorted to close his eyes for a while.</p><p>The Slytherin’s in his compartment had got to stop acting like Hufflepuff’s for heaven’s sake, it’s been 6 months since this drama had begun, though entertaining in the beginning the whole affair had become troublesome sooner with his friends deciding to get cross with each other and completely avoiding him. The words “why don’t you just shag already?” was at the tip of his tongue before he decided against it, as an angry Parkinson was not to be messed with.</p><p>Pansy quickly recovering from the setback called “Blaise”, immediately pounced on her intended Prey.</p><p>Were you finally laid, Darling?</p><p>Shut your trap, Pansy said Draco trying hard to stop smiling like a fool.</p><p>Tell me all about him? Does he have emerald eyes? Does he have messy hair?</p><p>Even if it is true that I had an excellent time recently, I don’t understand why you are making him the copy of saint potter? He said drawling the last bit.</p><p>With the topic now safely away from his mixed feelings, Blaise had no reason to stay away from all the fun “Well, well someone has been secretive”.</p><p>As much as Draco would have enjoyed rubbing it to their faces that he “Draco Malfoy” had managed to charm the most fit Ravenclaw half of Hogwarts desired, there were more important things that he liked to share, and he knew exactly what to tell them.</p><p>Mother knows that I fancy men, he said victoriously.</p><p>And as expected a resounding WHAT? Left their lips. This was going to be a long ride for sure.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hogwarts greeted harry with all its warmth, there was excitement in the air over the announcement of tri-wizard tournament. All and all, it felt like a new chapter in his life, just waiting to be explored. Though hearing about the challenging tournament had sent the risk-taking side of him to a jiffy, he knew without a doubt that he had no interests in participating in such a tournament now or in the future.</p><p>With the feast beginning, harry turned to see his best mates bickering on something or the other. His gut told him that he was going to be a witness to their not so platonic bickering for a long time. It was Ginny who broke him out of his train of thoughts.</p><p>“Nice, glasses Harry” Ginny said amused.</p><p>Thank you, gin. he replied with a bright smile.</p><p>Ginny with her confident smile and fiery attitude towards life had grown to become really close to harry in the past few months. Having her around brought a smile to his face immediately. Ron’s interrogation about their relationship never failed to embarrass him.</p><p>“I meant your glasses are askew, dummy” she said carefully removing the glasses and handing it back anew with a simple ‘Reparo’, it had been years since he entered the wizarding world, but the smallest of things still fascinated him.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>No problem, need my beauty sleep, goodnight she said pretending to be lazy and walked away with a final swish of her long hair.</p><p>With Ginny leaving, Harry’s eyes on instinct travelled towards the Slytherin table and as he didn’t find Malfoy at his usual place, a strong need to know his whereabouts rose in Harry which he immediately crushed while trying to concentrate on the ongoing debate amidst the Gryffindor’s “whether it was a wise decision to revoke the tri-wizard tournament or not” and finally bored turned his attention towards Seamus who had just finished writing a letter.</p><p>Is it a love letter, Seamus? asked Harry with a wicked look.</p><p>“Kind of and I’m only becoming an expert with time Harry”</p><p>Who is the lucky girl? , Harry asked now very much curious.</p><p>Seamus replied with a warm smile, “It’s my mother, I always send her a letter once I reach Hogwarts”.</p><p>“It must be really nice”, Harry replied with difficulty as his throat felt heavy suddenly.</p><p>Seamus playing with the letter in his hand sighed “It’s a laborious process since I’m not a letter kind of person”.</p><p>He was not jealous of the kids who were lucky enough to have parents anymore but there were times just like today, when Harry just failed to not drown in the huge void left by his parents. The inescapable fact that they had lost their lives saving him made it unbearable and as much as his friends sympathized with him, no one could truly understand his years of guilt and suffocation.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Draco had skipped the ever boring feast and had decided to spend his time doing other productive stuff like re-reading his favorite novel “my prince” by James lo  which revolved around a little squib boy who learns to be happy in a world which will always oppress him” , he was at the end of chapter three when he noticed a blue paper sticking out from the book and  carefully removed it to find</p><p> “MeEt me At the quiDditch piTch, after The fEAst”</p><p>The hand writing immediately created the image of the sender in Draco’s mind and he couldn’t help but feel a thrill of excitement run through his spine and decided to rush to the quidditch pitch before deciding to make Noah wait. He then left the room after 10 minutes as making someone wait more than that was unbecoming of a Malfoy.</p><p>The moon lit the quidditch grounds enough for one to walk without breaking their nail or teeth but that didn’t make Draco less cautious or uneasy. It was while walking towards his usual spot that he witnessed a nut job wildly running around the pitch and at a closer look he instantly recognized the unmistakable messy hair and shabby clothes of Harry potter.</p><p>“Expect the deranged savior to work out at this hour”</p><p>At this point of time Draco had stopped counting the number of times POTTER had appeared out of thin air in front of him and had accepted that they bumping heads was inevitable.</p><p>Anyone could tell by the rate Potter was running, that he would end up by Madam Pompfrey’s side either from total exhaustion or injured ligaments and the temptation to call him out on his idiocy filled his being with fire before being extinguished by his unresolved emotions.</p><p>With his previous enthusiasm leaving him, Draco decided to apologize to Noah later and turned around to leave when an agonizing cry pierced his being and left him stupefied for seconds. A feeling of dread and guilt arose in him “He shouldn’t have been here, he clearly shouldn’t have been here”.</p><p>His mind used to the arrogant attention seeking Harry potter drew a blank when forced to witness his nemesis breaking down, hence he followed his first instinct of running to his dormitory before other heart wrenching sound stopped him dead at his track.</p><p>“Unbelievable, this is unbelievable”, quipped Draco before having his pre-conceived notions being bombed by the distraught sight of the stranger in front of him and for reasons he did not know , a part of him yearned to reach out to this person.</p><p>“Like that would go really well Draco Abraxas Malfoy” he said berating his unrealistic and illogical thoughts.</p><p>After failed attempts of abandoning Potter, he sought to silently accompany him and cast a lasting warming charm on both. The next few hours passed by miserably as harry refused to budge even an inch and the cold was making Draco’s legs cramp.</p><p>True, Potter was not aware of his presence, but a calmness had engulfed Draco in his company and if he was truly honest he had to admit that he was enjoying it, Of course he would never admit it out loud.</p><p>With his hazy mind clearing Draco knew exactly what he had to do....</p><p>Draco searched for an elegant object but only found stones, leaves and grass around him and then the twin platinum bracelets glimmering in his right hand caught his attention.</p><p>“perfect”</p><p>He drew a triangle and placed one of the twin bracelet at its center and pictured the image of Harry with his eyes closed as the words “lux recreant” left his lips, magical sparks emitted from the drawn triangle, the bracelet and Draco’s wand merging to create a bluish silver light which transformed the bracelet into the replica of a Fairy.</p><p>Draco left the breath he was holding when the ethereal little fairy spread her wings and flew towards Harry, glowing in the darkness with her bluish light. At first, he thought he had miscast the spell, then a wave of ecstasy passed through him as he saw Potter finally following the ball of light.</p><p>“I’m a genius” </p><p>With his work done here, Draco conspicuously moved towards his usual spot as there were high chances that Noah was still waiting for him there after two hours. The question of Why he made a fairy for Harry Potter with his magical essence?  was put off for being answered later as his mind filled with the images of his warm bed and cocoa tea.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------x---------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                                                                           </p>
