  <strong>Prologue: Setting the Scene</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>International Confederation of Wizards; Bonn, Germany; June 1<sup>st</sup>, 1688</em>
</p><p>“…if things continue the Muggles will destroy us!”  The statesman from the New World colony of Salem rebutted, rising to his feet and decrying one of the more…<em>pacifistic</em> statesman among them from Tibet.  “As things are the aggression against witchcraft and wizardry have never been higher thanks to the like of the Puritans and the Lutherans!  Killing their own as they try and destroy something they cannot and <em>will not</em> ever understand!”</p><p>The statesman sat down as the Confederation devolved into a roar as the company fought against each other, all witnessed by their Supreme Mugwump in his first year at the head of the confederation.</p><p>He was a new appointment, a sop to the warlocks of Lichtenstein after they refused to join following Pierre Bonachord’s original appointment as the first Supreme Mugwump.</p><p>One of those proud and fierce warlocks sat at the new Mugwump’s side and gave a heavy sigh.</p><p>He was Grand Warlock Henrich Bonn, and had only concede to accompany the Mugwump as they were friends and colleagues of many years…and more than that, he was truly looking forward to watching this pumped up flock of popinjays get their comeuppance at the hands of a wizard that they <em>never</em> should have allowed power if they had wished – as many did from their own arguments over the last hours – to maintain the status quo.</p><p>Potters were many things, including the highest of the high among wizarding nobility thanks to their being a family prone to either a single, <em>powerful</em> son or several powerful daughters who tended to marry cannily and well.</p><p>His friend was one such powerful son: Hereweald Antioch Potter, Lord of the Noble House of Potter, and through his family connections one of the direct heirs of the House of Peverell, and of Gryffindor and of Slytherin among others.</p><p>The Potters kept it quiet of course, they weren’t braying upstarts such as the Malfoys were seen in England despite having long connections in France.</p><p>But it was true all the same – if one only took the time to <em>look</em>.</p><p>Henrich knew what course his friend was set upon – it was only a matter of letting the others present spin themselves around and tie themselves into so many metaphorical knots that his clean, precise plan will seem like a gift from the gods to bless lesser wizards.</p><p>He sat back as his friend stood, shooting him a smirk from a well-formed, aristocratic mouth, and prepared to watch the show.</p><p>“My fellow wizards.”  Hereweald’s smooth, well-tutored tones instantly soothed and quieted the raucous politicians, all turning their heads to stare up at him and sitting back – or down in the case of the most vigorously arguing – and giving him their utmost attention.  “The days of simply hiding are gone.  In Europe especially,” he waved an elegant hand towards the European delegation.  “Where wand-use is so prevalent, our people are on the brink.  And while, yes,” he nodded towards his Salem-born fellow.  “The aggression shown is troubling, we <em>do</em> yet have options.”  Hereweald laid his hands down flat on the podium before him.  “Muggles have begun to advance, this is true.  To adopt ideas of culture and society and <em>science</em> that before were beyond them.”  He flashed a smile.  “They are beginning to truly <em>evolve</em>, and thus present a unique opportunity if we were to grasp it: evolving along with them, in plain sight.”</p><p>“Integration.”  One of the Japanese delegates murmured, many of the Asians present smiling – a bit smugly.  After all, integration was <em>their</em> method.  Though many of them gathered that their Supreme Mugwump meant more than to simply <em>stop hiding</em> as the European sheep had done for so long.</p><p>“After a fashion.”  Herewealed nodded.  “Yes.  More importantly…taking the <em>reins</em> of this changing world instead of cowering in the shadows.  What I propose is simple: we come out from the shadows not as <em>magical</em>.”  He smirked.  “But as <em>technological</em>.”</p><p>A bright hum of conversation broke out at that, and at his back Henrich gave a mellow chuckle.</p><p>He’d been right, after all.</p><p>Hereweald Potter was many things, but among them all was an agent of <em>change</em>.</p><p>“What if the Muggle governments object or try to destroy us anyway?”  One of the French wizards asked, shrewdly.  “What you are proposing won’t be possible without some form of state endorsement?”</p><p>Hereweald arched an unimpressed brow.</p><p>“Are you a wizard or aren’t you?”  His look turned dark.  “This isn’t a discussion of trying to bilk a helpless Muggle – this is the survival of our race without persecution, pandering, or destruction.  If the Muggle governments do not wish to play along, we will <em>make them</em>.”</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Excerpt from Bathilda Bagshot’s <u>A History of Magic:</u></em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The International Confederation of 1688 heralded a new age of wizardry: that of hiding in plain sight.  Rather than sneak away into the dark shadows and hide all that magical kind are, we stepped out into the light: not as magical, but as scientific.  Advanced thinkers and inventors who were willing to help their fellow man.  It is also the first and last instance of wide-spread and sanctioned use of the Imperious Curse.  Governments and people all over the world were bespelled to accept this truth and look no further.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Several new policies grew from the Scientific Integration Act, chief among them the outlawing of wand-use except in private homes, Europe in particular having to adapt to Eastern schools of magic which instead used rings as magical conduits or having to train in wandless magic.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was a dangerous time, but out of it grew a world where technology and magic became integrated, and muggle science is as much a part of our world as our magic is of theirs, giving our children the opportunity to seek employment and opportunity in the muggle world, without the fear of discovery.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Second came an understanding of genetics, allowing what was once a dwindling people and populace to experience a resurgence, magical people now at last able to recognize that muggle humanity could and did serve a valuable purpose in the magical genetic code, allowing for fresh blood to help alleviate problems of breeding that had begun to take hold in some bastions of magical people.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was by no means, a perfect solution.</em>
</p><p><em>But it was a solution that </em>worked<em> nonetheless…”</em></p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>MI-7 Headquarters; London, England; 2013</em>
</p><p>“Agent Potter, welcome.”  Kingsley Shacklebolt smiled at one of his best – and brightest – proteges.</p><p>There was worry about Harry Potter in many circles, especially after the…<em>unfortunate</em> and unethical experiment that the now-incarcerated Albus Dumbledore had run with the Potter scion.</p><p>Granted, any many scientific minds among their community were all-but frothing at the mouth to read Albus’s body of work on what was now being called the Riddle-Potter experiment, but it was the <em>cost</em> of the experiment that sat poorly with the rest of their world.</p><p>So many deaths.</p><p>So much wasted time and talent and blood.</p><p>And for what?</p><p>To see – for once and for all – if a psychopath was created by nature or nurture?</p><p>Harry Potter (as he was born but then later adopted by his exonerated godfather Sirius Black) and Tom Riddle shared as close a genetic sequencing as possible outside of identical twins, it was true.  They were from different branches of old lines, they even looked the same.  But in his greed to prove a hypothesis, Albus had overlooked serious <em>flaws</em> in his experimental controls.</p><p>Harry hadn’t been orphaned at birth – but at fifteen months.</p><p>Both had been raised in abusive environments, it was true, thanks to Albus’s own abuse of his position in society.</p><p>But, after being reintroduced to magical society, Harry <em>hadn’t</em> been returned to the so-called “care” of his unlamented relatives, but given into the custody of his godmother, Alice Longbottom which in time was shared with Lord Black once he was exonerated of participation in the Potter murders.</p><p>And so on, and so forth.</p><p>However, what had the academics quivering for the day Harry Potter died – that being the magically binding agreement between Albus and Harry regarding publication of Albus’s study of Harry – was the connection between the two: a magical connection created the day Thomas Riddle orphaned young Harry Potter, that was later discovered to be the most foul of magics – a horcrux.</p><p>Harry lived, and spent all his youth until he was eighteen either as hunter or hunted in a deadly game of, well, <em>tag</em>, with Tom Riddle, the serial killer known as Voldemort who for a time had command of an elite group of other psychopaths in the United Kingdom, all “omegas” to his “alpha”.</p><p>Voldemort didn’t die the day he orphaned Harry Potter – but he was weakened, and spent many years researching what had gone so very <em>wrong</em> the night he attempted to become the last true heir of the Peverell and Slytherin lines.  His cohort still would terrorize Britain yearly, but all in all, it was a quiet decade.  And then Harry Potter returned, and Tom stepped out of the shadows once more.</p><p>It was a tale as if from a children’s story.</p><p>Good and evil.</p><p>The just prince and the wicked villain, all overseen by a corrupt vizier.</p><p>Still, while Kingsley abhorred what life had done to Harry Potter-Black, he couldn’t deny that it had given him his best man.</p><p>Harry – thanks to his connection with Tom – had had an <em>insight</em> to the killer that had proven vital in finally ending him.</p><p>The young man had done it, and then gone on to college, all while still consulting with MI-7 and Kingsley in particular to help catch the remainder of Tom’s cohort the “Death Eaters.”</p><p>They were all gone now.</p><p>Either ashes and dust like their leader or locked away in Azkaban.</p><p>All that remained from those decades of terror being the hidden study of Albus Dumbledore, and the scars – both literal and figurative – on the man before him.</p><p>A man, interesting enough, that if not for the actions of his ancestor, wouldn’t about to be put to the question Kingsley had for him.</p><p>A question that could very well change his life.</p><p>“Director Shacklebolt.”  Harry smiled at his mentor.  After the true depth of Albus’s betrayal had come to light, Harry hadn’t thought he would truly <em>trust</em> anyone ever again.</p><p>Padfoot and Moony aside, however his trust in his godfathers had everything to do with his understanding of them and their motivations and little to do with needing to have any sort of <em>faith</em> in their characters.</p><p>Kingsley had slowly – but surely – proven him wrong.</p><p>“Now.”  Kingsley said after tea was dispensed and some of his wife’s wonderful cookies had been shared with his best insight into the killer’s mind.</p><p>Which was rather the problem.</p><p>Harry could <em>understand</em> a killer the way few others could.</p><p>Kingsley’s wife Sharon – a mind-healer – had proposed that perhaps he had a form of empathy that helped, rather than it being a strict result of his connection with Tom Riddle, but Harry had been tested, as all young children were upon entering their training at a “advanced school of technology” aka Hogwarts for any above-and-beyond magical gifts that would need honing to seem as the work of education or technology to their non-magical cousins.</p><p>Agent Potter’s advanced understanding had almost nothing to do with magic – as Kingsley understood it – and everything to do with the actions of Tom Riddle haunting his thoughts and steps for over a decade.</p><p>That Harry was alive and not Tom was nothing short of proof that he did indeed <em>know</em> how a psychopath operated.</p><p>“Harry,” Kingsley broached the subject of his summons to the boss’s office.  “Have you given any thought what you would like to do now that Bellatrix has been apprehended?”</p><p>Bellatrix LeStrange had been the last – and worst – of the Death Eaters caught.</p><p>Well, <em>caught</em> was a bit misleading.</p><p>Put-down might be a better description.</p><p>As an MI-7 Agent Harry Potter had helped track over three dozen witches and wizards – and even a muggle or two – who had bought into Tom Riddle’s dogma.</p><p>Less than a dozen were currently in custody, the rest dying in the course of their apprehension or of other causes before being found by Harry’s task force, which had since been disbanded and all the members of which reassigned…except Harry.</p><p>It was a situation that had raised a few…<em>troubling</em> rumors among the public.</p><p>Rumors that Kingsley thought he’d come up with a way to squash…with some help from an old friend.</p><p>Harry sighed, as aware of where this conversation was going as Kingsley, and shook his head.</p><p>“Well.”  Kingsley set aside his teacup and picked up a folder from his desk, holding it out to Harry.  “I might just have an idea about that.  An old friend of mine named Jack Crawford has been given the approval for a task force not unlike the one you lead against the Death Eaters.”</p><p>“The Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI.”  Harry noted, green eyes lighting with interest beginning to peruse the folder with increasing interest.  “I’ve heard of it.  Misters Crawford and Graham have written some interesting articles – and Mr. Graham several books – on the psychopathic or criminal mind.”</p><p>“Yes.”  Kingsley smiled softly, enjoying seeing Harry with a…<em>spark</em> again.  Since his fiancé left him several years ago, sparking rumors regarding Harry’s…<em>methods</em>, finding real <em>life</em> in Harry was often moments few and far between, other than when playing with his young god-sister Romina "Rom-not-Mina" Celeste Black.  “At the moment Mr. Graham teaches only for the FBI Academy, he’s considered too unstable for the field.”</p><p>“As I understand it.”  Harry pursed his lips a bit as he flicked through the pages of the folio, quickly assimilating the gist of the information.  “Will Graham for all his unique ability to <em>see</em> into the minds and motivations of others is closer on the personality disorder spectrum to autism and Asperger’s than sociopathy.  Not the <em>best</em> cocktail for a field operative.”</p><p>“No,” Kingsley sighed.  “No, it’s not.  A rare time when <em>less</em> emotion would be a boon over more.  And with the closure of the Death Eater files, you’re rather under-utilized here, Harry.”</p><p>The implication laying between them being that <em>Harry</em> was closer to sociopathy than either man was comfortable admitting.</p><p>Harry had been spiritedly vilified in the papers over the years, called everything from a sinner to a saint and all the grey in between, though lately it seemed – thanks to the aforementioned former-fiancé – they preferred adjectives along the lines of “cold”, “distant”, and even “dangerous.”</p><p>Mad, had also been bandied about more than seemed reasonable or even organic in nature.</p><p>Hell, it seemed, had no fury like a Hermione Granger scorned.</p><p>“Cards on the table, Kings.”  Harry sighed, sitting back in the armchair and closing the file.  “You want me to go to the States?  Help this BSU team?”</p><p>“Jack could use your insight.”  Kingsley told him evenly, not trying to snow him – it wouldn’t work and would just be a waste of time – but not getting into the underlying <em>worry</em> that plagued him over what might happen if Harry remained in Britain.  “And you could use some…<em>distance</em> from our community here.”  Kingsley held up a hand, silencing whatever objection was sure to come in response.  “You do, Harry.  Other places, especially America, don’t have as strong of a wizarding culture underlying the muggle.  Our people have had the hardest time – historically – staying integrated but under the radar at the same time.”</p><p>“Hogwarts doesn’t help that.”  Harry pointed out with no-little exasperation.  A point that he’d made over and over and over again to the upper echelons of MI-7 and the offices at 62442 Downing Street.  “It creates a sense of both isolation and superiority that are counterproductive to full integration.”</p><p>It was an argument that had been made by Potter men and their political allies for centuries now.</p><p>And yet the anachronistic educational facility still stands, even if to the public as a boarding school for “elite and gifted students.”</p><p>“Be that as it may.”  Kingsley sighed, pinching his nose.  “Britain remains one of the few places with an actual wizarding-type society that holds itself at arms-length from our non-magical cousins.  You, however it came about, were raised in a non-magical household and excelled in non-magical schooling until you were brought into the…<em>secret</em> as it were.  Of all the help I could offer Jack, you’re the best bet for not sending up any red flags.  You also would benefit from the lessened scrutiny you would face in the States.  Just.”  Kingsley sighed.  “Just think about it, will you?”</p><p>“When do you need an answer by?”  Harry asked, taking that as a cue to rise and holding onto his folder turning for the door.</p><p>“A week.”  Kingsley told him.  “Jack and I will both need time to clear the paperwork and your status as an agent-on-loan from MI-5.”</p><p>Harry nodded, mind working furiously, and wandered away to the Apparation point to pop home.</p><p>He wouldn’t need the week.</p><p>If he was honest, he didn’t need a day.</p><p>They both knew he was going to take the offer – if to get away from the <em>expectations</em> of the magical underbelly of British nobility if nothing else.</p><p><em>They</em> hadn’t approved of Hermione, though now in hindsight many of them would have preferred her or anyone magical over his seemingly unending bachelorhood.</p><p>Harry might play at being an agent, but he was also so much more than that.</p><p>If only on paper.</p><p>Siri oversaw his seat in the House of Lords, Remy watched over the board at Potter International.</p><p>His godfathers helped him…<em>maintain</em> and manage his profile in Britain.</p><p>It would be…<em>refreshing</em> to live in a place where he wasn’t constantly under a microscope…at least one not of his own making.</p><p>The sort of crimes that units like the BSU investigate tended to bring the limelight and microscopes along with them…but that could also be managed.</p><p>And at least they wouldn’t have his ex-fiancé’s poisonous words to put on the second page every other day.</p><p> </p>
