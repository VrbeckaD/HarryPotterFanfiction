    <p>The air was crisp and calming. The sun was warm enough that Newt had to loosen his scarf a bit to let in some air. The rocky path grumbled beneath his boots as he hiked up the mountain trail. Birds were chipping away high up in the large, old trees. A light breeze rustling some of the leaves.</p><p>Newt admired the sound, trying to catch a glimpse of the birds but they were too well hidden. Instead he sent them a smile before adjusting his backpack and carried on. </p><p>The sun was on its way down and it wouldn’t be long before Newt would need to find a good place to set camp. His stomach clearly liked the idea and gave a little rumble, urging Newt to pick up his pace. After a couple of minutes walk, Newt stopped and looked around. This would be too out in the open, there would be no shield for the cold wind of the night, so he decided to go off the trail, hoping to find a nook between the trees, flat enough for a tent and a fire. </p><p>The backpack landed on the ground with a thud and Newt sighed in contentment, his shoulders growing tense from carrying the weight. He untied the red cloth he had and found a branch to tie it to. That way he would know his way back, if he should get too turned around. Newt was an experienced hiker, so he doubted he would need it, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>From there he headed into the rough terrain and away from the path. A few paces into the forest, Newt tied another red cloth. A few meters in, he found a perfect little patch. A tiny plateau, big enough for the tent, with a large rock at the back so the wind wouldn’t be too hard if it should pick up in the night. </p><p>Newt put down his backpack, stretched his shoulder and walked around the newfound camp to make sure he wasn’t disturbing too much wildlife. All was clear, except for the foxhole further down the hill behind his camp. It was far enough that he wouldn’t cause too much harm. It was only for tonight, he would be back on his feet and on his way when the sun was back up. </p><p>Back at the little make-shift camp, Newt skillfully unfolded his tent and made his bed, a small fire was forming in the dried up leaves and branches he had placed outside. His stomach was growling louder now, making Newt feel a tad sick from hunger. He rummaged through his stuff and found a small bag with dried up vegetables and spices for soup. For a second he argued with himself if he should eat some jerky and then save the soup but he needed water anyways so he might as well go and get that now. </p><p>With his flask and a foldable container, Newt made his way to the stream of fresh, clear water that ran through the mountains. It had been close to the original path so it wouldn’t take too long to get. </p><p>A rabbit sprinted along when it heard Newt’s footsteps on the crunchy leaves and gravel. Newt watched it as it knowingly ran and jumped, fleeting from the human behind it. A smile formed on the adventures lips as he reached the bank of the stream. He carefully stepped out on a wet stone in the middle and squatted down to fill the flask first. He took a grateful sip of the cold water, flinching slightly as the cold hit his teeth. He then carefully threw the bottle back on land and unfolded the bowl, cathering a bit of water for his soup.</p><p>Newt got up and stepped back on land but his boot slipped on the surface of the rock. The twist in his ankle hurt, making Newt whimper. It was followed shortly with a splash as the boot stomped through the otherwise calm water. Newt landed with a loud gasp on both knees and hands, hitting himself on the rocks underneath the water. The container tilted, spilling the water. Birds flapped away, scared of the commotion from the stream. Everything went quiet, only Newt’s breath sucked through his teeth and the stream was noticeable. </p><p>Newt hurried out of the water, it was too late to save his clothes from the cold, but laying there for too long would only make him sick. He scrambled his way to a dry piece of moss, leaning his back against a tree as he swallowed down the pain from his knees and ankle. After a few collecting breaths, he rolled up his wet pant leg and pulled as much of his shoe out as he could so he could get a look at his sore foot. </p><p>It wasn’t too bad. Nothing seemed too damaged, it only hurt. A good night's sleep would see to that and hopefully it wouldn’t slow him down too much tomorrow. </p><p>Newt took another deep breath and got back on his feet. His pants were dripping with water and it was cooling down his skin quickly. He had to get back to camp as fast as he could. The sun was falling down behind the trees and it was already getting dark in the forest. </p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>An owl howled, as if it was a warning. Or at least it felt like one. It was dark. The insects in the air were gone, the birds had been silenced, everything was either sleeping or lurking. </p><p>Newt still hadn’t found his way back to camp. His ankle still throbbed with pain, his clothes wet and cold. The temperatures had fallen with the sun and the forest was dense and wet. Newt was shivering but he continued walking, fumbling through the trees and bushes, cutting his arms on branches and hitting his legs on stumps and rocks.</p><p>It was a bad idea to continue walking, the possibility that he was walking in the wrong direction was rather large. But he would freeze his nose off if he stopped moving. He couldn’t hear, see, or smell the fire so he turned around. Hoping he hadn’t fumbled his way too far from where he came from. </p><p>He kept telling himself that he had been in worse situations. He had been on lots of hikes with his mother and older brother. He knew how to handle himself out in the wild, there was no need for panic. Though his heart still pounded hard, a reminder that panic was lurking right under the surface of his forced calmness.</p><p>The terrain turned into solid rocks. This felt familiar and Newt took a deep and steadying breath. He was on the right track now, he could feel it. It had been solid rock some of the way from his camp to the water. If he could find his way to the water again, he was sure that he would be able to see the fire from there.</p><p>A crisp branch snapped loudly underneath Newt’s feet, making him choke on a gasp as he stepped backwards. </p><p>He hit the ground hard, slamming his whole body against the rock. His foot hadn’t landed on ground, he had stepped right over a cliff. He went down, fast, and he tried to hold on but it was smooth and his hands couldn’t find anything to hold onto. It felt like slow motion as he fell in the air. It went so fast that the darkness turned him blind. Newt lost his breath as he landed on his side on the next piece of ground, then further down, again it felt like flying, but he could feel himself turn. He had no idea if he was up or down, but he found out soon enough when his legs hit rock. The pain was unbearable but his lungs were empty. His hand frantically caught grass but the only thing it did was cutting his hands as he continued falling. </p><p>Newt rammed into the ground, landing on his back. He was wheezing for air, water running from his eyes as they closed.</p><p>The whole forest turned silent. </p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>The sun was bringing life to the forest. Birds were singing, joyous for a new day. A whitetail deer moved to the stream and took a quick drink before jolting its head back up. Big brown eyes searching the woods. Even in the serenity of the forest, it still watched out. </p><p>It turned and jumped back into the bushes as a fox came trotting out from where the deer had sensed activity. Not that the fox would be any threat, but the deer was now long gone. </p><p>Newt gritted his teeth, his mouth felt dry. His body hurt so much that he felt numb. A rustling sound to his right made him stir a bit. A tiny growl broke through his lips, making the rustling sound stop in its tracks. </p><p>Newt blinked, his eyes slowly getting used to the sunlight. In the corner of his eye something red was sneaking around, curious as to what creature had fallen into its domain. It’s beady eyes landed on Newt and a second later it was darting away from him and through the dense underground of the forest. </p><p>With a grunt, Newt turned on to his knees, slowly sitting back on his heels. Every muscle in his body was aching. He moved his gaze to the cliff he had tumbled down from. It was maybe 6 meters tall, bumpy, steep, and rocky. It was pure luck that Newt hadn’t broken anything. Everything hurt like hell, yes, but other than bruises he was fine. Miraculously. He exhales loudly and leaned his head back, blinking at the sun. It seemed like a mockery that everything was so pure and peaceful, though he was thankful the weather was with him. </p><p>Newt looked down at his hands stretched out in front of him. Dirt and dried up blood covered his palms. He had some nasty cuts from the sharp strands of grass he had frantically grabbed at on his way down. </p><p>He needed water, his eyes fell on the stream close to him. Newt scrambled to his feet, staggering his way to the water. The short walk went better than Newt had dared to hope. He sat down on his knees again and washed the grime of his hands. The icy water stung in his cuts as he did his best to clean them. After that, Newt took a sip, using his hands as a cup. Spilling a lot down his scarf but that was the least of his worries right now. He needed to find a way back up and then hopefully the daylight would lead him back to his things.</p><p>A mechanical clicking sound caught his attention and Newt was about to turn his head when something pressed against the back of his skull.</p><p>Newt froze in place, adrenaline pumping through him as a nauseous feeling sprouted in his gut. He held his breath, trying to look out of the corner of his eyes without turning too much.<br/>
“Don’t . Say. A word.” a voice snarled behind Newt. Newt gave a hiccup, eyes shut tightly as he tried to swallow. His hands were shaking as he felt the metal press harder against his skull.</p><p>“Turn around slowly. Hands up so I can see them.” The voice belonged to a man, his voice husky and raw. </p><p>“But-” </p><p>“I said turn around!” A hint of panic in the voice, only a slight tone, but Newt sensed it.</p><p>Newt lifted his hands up slowly so the other could see that Newt was unarmed. For a second Newt feared that he would throw up, he took a shaky breath before he got up on his knees and turned on them.</p><p>His eyes glued to the ground. The stranger was wearing a pair of black boots. They seemed newly polished but they were splattered in fresh mud. He had been running. The splatter was tell-telling, drops all the way up the others legs. </p><p>“I-I- this is a misunderstanding- I was hiking- the cliff-”</p><p>“Shut up.” The newcomer took a step back. The tip of the rifle came into Newt’s view as the other pulled it away from the back of his head.</p><p>Newt dared to lift his gaze, moving slowly, eyes calculating over the others frame. He was dressed in all black. Black combat pants, a black shirt and a coat, a bag hanging behind him. He had broad shoulders, both hands on the rifle which he held in a loose grip. A stripe of dried blood had run down one of his hands. Newt blinked his wet eyes as he took in the weapon, an unwanted tear running down the dirt on his cheek. </p><p>“You don’t look like them. Who are you?” The stranger grumbled. </p><p>It was almost as if Newt was supposed to know who he was talking about. Newt’s eyes reached his face. A handsome one of that. A straight nose, well-cut jawline, hard eyes watching Newt’s face carefully. His hair was salt and pepper, half of it parting in the middle and falling to the side in strands, rest of it combed back with a hand. </p><p>“My name is Newt Scamander, and I swear Sir, I was just hiking. I fell-” Newt pointed haphazardly to the cliff. “I got turned around in the dark, I haven’t seen anyone, I promise.” Newt shook his head, eyes getting wet again as he tried to explain his way out of this. </p><p>The stranger nodded, he seemed more relaxed. “British.” He stated and looked around. </p><p>“Percival Graves.” He continued and reached down to help Newt back on his feet. </p><p>Newt took the offer and staggered back on his feet. The adrenaline and fear in him had absorbed the pain in his body. Newt got control over his breathing while this Percival was taking him in. Newt followed his eyes and looked down at himself. Dust and dried mud covering his chest, hiding the dusty red color of his clothes underneath. His pants ripped at his left thigh.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Percival asked, suddenly quite friendly. He hung the rifle over his shoulder, his eyes constantly moving from Newt and to the forest around them.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine. Sore, but fine.” Newt said with a nod. “And confused. Scared. Many things, why are you carrying a gun?”</p><p>Percival’s eyes fell on Newt’s, eyes searching for something. Newt felt small under his gaze, even though the other was shorter than himself. Newt swallowed awkwardly. </p><p>“Danger is looming between the trees.” Newt didn’t get a chance to answer that mysterious sentence as the other continued.</p><p>“We gotta get moving. They’ll follow the smell of us, and they are quick.” </p><p>Newt stared at the lunatic before him as Percival made his way to the water. His eyes following up the stream. It was uncomfortably silent in the forest, though Newt was probably paranoid. He now realised how much he wanted to go home, as in now. Back in his house, by the fire and forget everything that had happened over the last 12 hours. He was hungry and needed sleep.</p><p>“What? Bears?” Newt asked with a raised brow. “As long as we stay away from their cubs they-”</p><p>“Not bears. Worse.” Percival glanced at Newt over his shoulder. “So keep an eye out, we have to move north, there should be a cabin a few miles from here.”</p><p>“Well then have a safe journey, I have to find my stuff and get home.” Newt shrugged in defeat and made his way towards the cliff. If he followed the foot of it, there should be a path up. Maybe a game trial or water path he could climb. </p><p>Newt could hear the crunching of stones under the other’s boots at Percival followed him. He grabbed Newt by the shoulder, holding him back. Newt tried to wring himself free from the other but it hurt so he decided to stop and accept his fate. He gave a sigh and turned to look at the weirdo stopping him.</p><p>“You don’t know what you’re up against. They have already picked up your scent.” A hint of mania was clear in Percival’s brown eyes.</p><p>“I need to get back to my camp, I want to go home, okay?”</p><p>“That camp has probably saved your life, we have to go now, do you understand?” Percival pulled Newt closer, urging him to follow.</p><p>Newt slapped Percival’s hand away with a grunt. This time walking faster to get away. It hurt in his legs to move so quickly but he needed to get away from this person. His heart beating faster as annoyance filled his belly. </p><p>Boots running towards Newt made him pick up his speed so he would be running to, had the other not grabbed Newt by the collar, choking him as Percival pulled him back. An animalistic growl made the adrenaline in Newt flare up again. Newt got a hard push in his chest, landing on his hip in the gravel. He was about to yell in anger at the other when the rifle was fired multiple times. </p><p>Newt threw himself down on the ground, hands over his head, sure that this was his death. He whimpered, biting his lip hard enough that it drew blood. No pain came, to Newt’s confusion so he looked up just in the same second as Percival pulled Newt back up on his feet. </p><p>Percival was panting as he pulled Newt along. Both stumbling, Percival was holding so tight around Newt’s wrist that it felt like snapping. A loud, painful roar deafened Newt’s ears as they ran for their lives into the bushes.</p><p>Heavy stepped sprinted behind them, threatening to catch them. Newt was too scared to look behind, his heart pounding in his throat, his legs running on their own, his whole mind and body geared on flighting.</p><p>The creature behind them roared desperately but the stomping of its gallop had stopped. It kept screaming, whimpering, whatever the hellish sound was, mad that it couldn’t follow them into the forest.</p><p>They both kept running, Percival leading the way with the rifle loaded and ready. </p><p>Newt felt like fainting.</p>
