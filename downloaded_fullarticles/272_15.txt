Everything concerning the current mission had been going so well, too well he had thought, just before a bright light and an earthquake had sent everything he knew into utter chaos.</p><p>'And that is normally the time when things go pear shaped. Right after the thought of "all is well".' he mused, as the screams of people no longer in the area he inhabited still played through his mind as if the event was rippling back through time. He was falling, twisting, being pulled into a place he had no wish to be. He had a grip on someone who was also falling, being pulled and yanked into that same place.</p><p>Harry's muddled thoughts suddenly shifted tracks, running further back into a conversation he had with one of his best friends a while ago. It was when he told her he had been selected for the project that was currently falling down around his ears in a rather spectacularly public fashion.</p><p>*Start Flashback*</p><p>"Hello the house!"</p><p>Harry's joyful voice bellowed over the normal supper time din of the Burrow as he stepped onto the front porch. Sudden excited screeches from the inside gave him very little warning before two red-headed missiles - one large and one very small - collided with him, almost knocking him flat onto his rear; he wound up in a squatted stance just to keep his feet.</p><p>"Harry! You've been gone for ages, where have you been hiding yourself?." came the sharp command from the older of the two once she had released him and stepped away.</p><p>Harry smiled and looked up at her from his half crouched position while still trying to keep his balance during the onslaught of pushing from the little one at his legs. His mind started to wander as it always did when he was faced with the family he considered his yet was still so separate from. Molly was looking quite well these past few years now that peace was restored to pretty much all of the wizarding war affected areas of Europe. She had taken it upon herself in those early days afterward to care for all of the remaining Order, and those now homeless children like Harry, and had been very much the perfect picture of a 'mother hen' with all her smothering.</p><p>It's now over a decade since the war ended and those people she had taken in weren't children anymore or homeless for that matter. Most had lives and families of their own, though that didn't stop Molly from acting the parent over them still. This was mainly why Harry was 'hiding away' as she liked to put it, so that he could think for more than five minutes in silence before Molly would come around and start worrying over his post war 'moping'. Harry didn't mope anymore, there was nothing to mope about, Molly just wanted to be useful and figured that since Harry didn't have anyone to mother him, then she should be it. Her calling his quiet time moping just gave her an excuse to offer others as to why she was always on his case.</p><p>As Harry's mind drifted he tried to remove from his legs one of the many little red-headed terrors that had popped up over the years. With all the surviving Weasley children out starting their families there were quite a few of the little devils about. Having not been in touch often with the rest of the family due to work and Godfather duties, nor really paying attention to the pictures Ron showed him when they did meet up after work, left a regretful Harry without a clue which one this child belonged to; its not that he didn't care, really he did, but there was only so much he could take in when he was busy with some project and Ron insisted on doing the catch up thing when Harry's brain wasn't engaged for it. In many ways Ron was as bad as his mother in that he always chose the most inopportune moment to try and socialize, making it a predictable habit of his to drop some important tidbit of information while Harry was distracted and so although Harry knew Ron and Hermione had two kids themselves with a third on the way and knew the names of their children and quite a bit about them in general, he didn't remember the names or the ages of all of the children of the rest of the clan.</p><p>Most of the Weasley kids had moved off to live elsewhere once they were grown and only met up on the holidays, something Harry had pointedly been ignoring invitations to since he turned twenty to not only keep out of the chaos that was the clan when everybody came to the burrow, but because he was normally occupied elsewhere with his Godson during the hols. This then resulted in him being quite behind on the who married who aside from Bill, Ron and of course Hermione. He was glad he wasn't so reclusive that he didn't know basic things like George had one child with a possibility for another in the future, and both Percy and Bill had a brood of two and four respectively. Ginny was with Dean and although they weren't married, they had two themselves who were sure to be Quidditch players once they got old enough to ride a broom without an adult on it with them. But the fine details were lost in the haze of being overworked, sent abroad on long stints for said work, and Ron's perfect way of catching Harry at a bad time.</p><p>The only one Harry really knew almost everything about was his own Godson Teddy. Harry had promised not to be the Godfather Sirius had been, he would do better, and so most of his free time was devoted to Teddy rather than the Weasley family gatherings or just meeting up with a couple of them for more than just tea. He loved them dearly, really he did, but they didn't need Harry in order to be happy; Teddy on the other hand did. Now that Teddy was old enough to really understand the world around him, he needed his Godfather to take him places and show him things that others only dream of seeing or doing. He needed a male influence in his life that wasn't the family house elf who enjoyed swearing and insulting people under his breath. He needed toys and pets and long weeks away from home so that he knew he was loved by more than just his Grandmother. He needed a positive role model to come and stay with him and help him keep sane when Andromeda had one of her frequent paranoia fits and would lock Teddy, Harry and herself away in the house for months on end out of fear of loosing her last link to her daughter to some perceived misfortune.</p><p>And it's not as if Harry's friends didn't know Teddy or interact with him at all, it's that they weren't as invested in him due to having their own very full lives; Teddy wasn't their responsibility, he had people who cared for him, so they didn't go out of their way to visit him. Only Ron and Hermione bothered to do more than just occasionally visit, and Harry had even gotten them to promise to take his place in Teddy's life should anything happen to him that would prevent his being there for the young man.</p><p>Harry kept telling himself he was in the right every time Hermione would say something about the family and Harry wouldn't know what she was talking about, kept reminding himself that he wasn't a terrible person for choosing Teddy and by extension, Andy, over everyone else. But it was hard to keep the guilt of straying so far away from those old bonds from rising up in him when faced with just how little he knew his friends and their families now.</p><p>Shaking himself free of his thoughts, Harry finally answered Molly. "I've been busy at work, actually. It's partially why I came here tonight, I need to see Hermione for a bit. Is she in, or Ron even?" He chuckled while he wrestled the tiny hands from his trousers, grinning when the child darted away and vanished in the house not long after he managed to separate it from his person. It happened so quickly that he wasn't sure even what gender his attacker had been.</p><p>"Ron's not in yet I'm afraid." Molly started, watching Harry start to re-situate his coat, "But Hermione is in the kitchen, got here not a moment ago. Will you stay long?" She asked hopefully, reaching out and tugging Sirius' - now his - coat back into place from where it had been rumpled in the extreme hugging.</p><p>Harry shook his head and gently motioned her hands away from the coat as he answered "No, I have to be back in the Department before seven, which only gives me less than an hour and a quarter before I must be leaving. Although my work day is over, I've been asked to come back in for a bit to help out with something. I'll probably be too tired to come back out here tonight.".</p><p>He pulled out his wand and waved it at the wrinkles in his clothes, glad that even though he and Ginny never worked out as a couple, she was still willing to teach him 'handy skills' that he could use until he found a woman to 'properly' care for him. As a matter of fact she was very happy to teach him all these skills and more; Harry had the impression she thought he might swing the other way and she was determined to make sure he was capable of looking sharp enough to attract one of the better looking males of that persuasion, instead of just the ones who really could do with some tips from Lockhart, even in the man's current state. Harry wasn't bothered with it, even though he didn't swing that way, or at least he had never had such an urge that he remembered, it's just that he was absolutely pants at romantic anything and so didn't waste any time on such things. Later, once he was less busy, he would try to find someone, and if it was a man instead of a woman, he promised himself not to get too hung up on the fact that had been looking in all the wrong places before. Obviously.</p><p>Molly frowned a bit at his answer but allowed him to make his excuses like she always did these days and led him into the house proper while calling for Hermione. The Matriarch then headed into the kitchen to finish up whatever was cooking, patting Harry on the shoulder and giving him a soft smile as she left. The smells of roasting meat, baking potatoes and the unmistakable tang of onions being cut filled the air and brought a sense of peace to Harry that he had been lacking as of late.</p><p>"Harry! I didn't think you were going to visit!" Hermione said in surprise as she exited the kitchen and spotted him standing near the cat hair infested couch. Her arms darted upward while walking into the sitting room and, gathering Harry up into a nearly bone crushing hug, smiled when he protested at the re-wrinkling of his favorite coat. More loud crashing and screaming from upstairs made her smile even wider at the flinches they pulled out of a worried Harry. He had no idea who was here today and how many they had brought along with them, though judging by the fact that there weren't any responsible adult voices shouting back at the screamers from upstairs, he could probably safely assume it was Ron and Hermione's kids and whoever's that was who had attacked him outside earlier. Hopefully none of them were in a pranking mood today.</p><p>"I wasn't going to but they stopped me when I was packing up for the day and gave me some news I just had to share immediately. I do have to go back around seven though. They've asked for some help on something unrelated to the news I'm about to give you, and I'm the one who drew the short straw when people started coming up with excuses as to why it shouldn't be them." he said, plopping down on a sofa that was now free of cat hair thanks to Hermione's quick thinking and wand waving; seriously the amount of cats that visited this place with all the new cat owners in the family now was ridiculous, they could start selling the fur as nesting material at this point and make a killing.</p><p>A pillow moved about right before Hermione joined him on the couch and she picked up a small black and white kitten from under it before continuing the motions of taking a seat next to Harry. "Oh? What have they got for you now?" she asked, her face set into a curious expression.</p><p>Harry sighed explosively and gave a wry grin "Well, it is a bit of a long story, but the quick of it is that they found some sort of rip in the fabric of time and space somewhere in Wales and apparently its been tossing out odd objects, some really advanced tech and even some seemingly temporally displaced people." Harry said, rubbing his face with both his hands while he remembered the long conversation about the tear and what that means for wizard kind. Again most of the government wanted to stick their heads in the sand at the strange thing that was encroaching on their perfect little world, but the Department had some level headed folk working there this time and they at least wanted to poke at the strange and unusual first before following the sheep mind of the rest of the group if it got too out there for them to handle. Though Harry did wonder what would be considered too out there if a group of Roman soldiers from around the time of Christ just appearing out of nowhere didn't phase them.</p><p>"They want someone who deals well with the 'weird and horrible' on the case. Seems strange that this tear has been active for a long while yet the DoM has only just said anything about it. Almost like they've either not noticed it before now, which I think is Crup Shit seeing how volatile it is, or they've hit a major snag in their work with it and need outside help fast. Either works for me as even though it's not exactly my branch of the Department, it does get me out of the office." he laughed, taking the kitten from Hermione and setting it in his lap, where it immediately sought out the buttons on his shirt. A few more screams from upstairs had Hermione turning toward the staircase and shouting to use their 'indoor voices please' before she looked back at Harry.</p><p>"A tear in the fabric of...? What in Merlin's name are they going to do with something like that? What kind of spells would you even use on one safely? And while I'm on about it, why select you at all? I get you're a national hero and that would give whatever team working on this thing the extra boost they needed for their goals...But, Harry, even you know that such a project isn't your area of expertise. You're more of the 'rush in and stop the badguys' kind, not someone who is good with delicate..er..." she trailed off and pursed her lips together, turning away and frowning over at the fire in the hearth with a slightly embarrassed air about her.</p><p>Harry shrugged in good humor, not at all offended at her words and quipped "I'm very good with thinking on the fly and proven to be difficult to put down. Pretty sure its to do with something that came out of the tear recently, or maybe some idiot in the crew tossed something back and hell is brewing." Harry shrugged, batting the kitten's paw away from a loose thread on the worn shirt he had decided to wear that day in preparation for a messy field op that didn't pan out, he wound up coming back to the office after only twenty minutes out and about Greater London.</p><p>"And it's the Department of Mysteries, what spells do you think they will use on it? Probably try to tame the time travel aspect or some such, you know how they get when there is experimenting to do. In the name of Magic and Science should be their motto." Harry said, looking amused.</p><p>Hermione paused in her thoughts and looked askance at him in worry, "Yes, I do know" her voice suddenly filled with fear and her face showed extreme discomfort "Oh, Harry. You will be careful, won't you?" She looked him straight in the eyes now, there was a gleam in them that Harry hadn't witnessed since they had gone on the Horcrux Hunt. Well that wasn't true, a similar one would show up if the word 'research' was even so much as breathed around her. Harry opened his mouth to speak but then closed it with an amused hum when the woman across from him waved her hands around frantically as if to dismiss any answer he might be trying to think up.</p><p>"Actually, you know what? Don't answer that, I think I'll have to help you in order to make sure you're alright. There is no way I'm leaving you to Them alone." The way she said 'them' was so stressed and defined, he was sure that she probably wrote it down in italics and capitalized when she had to refer to that branch of government on paper without naming names. Even though the DoM was one huge department, it had many different branches or divisions in it. Them was the top layer of the Department as a whole and both Harry (Combat and Weapon Research) and Hermione (Spell Crafting and Enchantments Research) hated that part of the DoM with a passion.</p><p>"Well if you think that would help." he said lamely. "I don't think they will approve, though we may both of us be in the same Department, there is still a bit of a jump between your division and mine." he added just to sooth her.</p><p>'And not very much help will be wanted by them in this endeavor. From what I've heard about the project, its obvious the Muggles already know about this tear even though no one can do a damn thing about it except hide what comes through. And They want to prove we don't need Muggles to figure this thing out, and Muggleborns are still just a step up from Muggle in their eyes' Harry added silently, so as not to bring Hermione into another one of her 'we are all magical' rants that she tended to go on when such ideas were voiced in her hearing range.</p><p>Hermione sighed heavily at his tired expression. "I know that, Harry, really I do. But I figure it will be unofficial help. I just want to look things over, make sure those idiots don't screw something up. They can always find a new tear as I'm sure there are more, but I can't just get another Harry Potter to replace my friend if something goes wrong."</p><p>She snatched up the kitten from where it had tried to slink back under the pillows, Harry's petting hands having stilled a while ago during the conversation. She placed the kitten on her chest to cuddle it and gathered herself, biting her lower lip out of habit.</p><p>"And if they complain, you can always say your girlfriend or boyfriend threatened to spell you into the basement forever unless there was a more, well trained-in-the-Muggle-technology eye to watch over things. I might even be able to send someone who knows what they're doing to oversee it."</p><p>The way she stated it, so simple and share, it took him a moment to realize she was still a bit miffed at him; that he didn't actually have such a person to spell him in place when he got a stupid idea in his head was a conversation they had quite often, and he really didn't want this one to dissolve into one of those arguments about how he failed at being in a romantic relationship. And it was plainly obvious from her choice of words that she had been talking to Ginny again about Harry's possible sexual leanings...Joy.</p><p>"Yes, well, They know I don't have anyone, which...now that I think about it." he trailed off, looking into the fire in dawning comprehension, "Is why they asked me." Harry finished in a near whisper, not out of fear, but out of anger.</p><p>Being the last of a family line meant that unless he willed everything to someone - and he had, the whole Weasley clan and his Godson, Teddy, would be getting his stuff - then upon his death it would default to the nearest blood kin or to the government, if the blood kin was unable or unwilling to accept. Harry had obviously been singled out by the Purebloods as revenge for not helping to scrap the new laws that would restrict their hold over the Ministry and the Muggle issue. Many had approached him with bribes and 'knowing smiles' when they spoke of the Muggles and the Wizard's need to keep them away and the Muggleborns as well, who want to change the traditions of magic because they saw them as dated.</p><p>They thought him of the same mind due to the horror story that was his treatment by the Dursleys, being outed in the paper a week prior by a 'worried' friend that wasn't sure this new Muggle law was a good idea. 'More like an enemy that got hold of the information through digging, and now they are making sure I'm at the front to take the fall if this dangerous rip decides to blow.' The thought ignited the hot sort of anger that Harry's mother was well known for.</p><p>'And if I die in the process, then my money would have gone to them and they could line as many pockets as they needed in order to change the laws again. Too bad for them that I fear being killed by a still free Death Eater and already got my affairs pretty much in order.' he thought savagely, shaking his head and standing up once he noticed the time.</p><p>Hermione blinked at the quick movement, obviously thinking that her friend's head shake was a polite end of the conversation, and then sighed when she too noticed the time.</p><p>"I'll see what I can do on my end, Harry, you just watch yourself and double check everything by me first before you do it. And if anything goes wrong, you get the hell out of there." Hermione rose to her feet as well, hugging him as she muttered "Promise me, Harry" into his coat. Harry made a noise that he hoped she would take as one of agreement, being unable to voice even a small 'yes' with her hugging him as tightly as she was.</p><p>When she finally let go he pulled back and nodded, eyes sincere as he uttered "I promise."</p><p>*End Flashback*</p><p>*The Present*</p><p>'Yup, that worked out really well, didn't it? Why don't you make a few more promises you can't keep, eh, Potter?'</p><p>Harry couldn't figure out what happened to set the whole thing off, everything had been going absolutely perfectly, the tear was fine, just a blip on the stolen Muggle equipment they enchanted to help observe the thing. The damn temporal tear was just quietly buzzing away and not being threatening at all. The most it had done all day was two hours earlier it had happily thrown out an odd, green trunked and orange leafed tree of unknown origins, that was covered in equally odd multicolored fruits that smelled of bananas but tasted like maple syrup with a touch of something unidentifiable, and yes someone had been stupid enough to eat one to find out. The medium sized tree had still been covered in large amounts of purple soil around it's dark green roots and appeared to have been pulled up in its entirety. There were even little blue and green bugs that were definitely not from earth all over the slick bark; Harry thought they might be ants from how they interacted with each other.</p><p>Then suddenly, ten minutes ago, the machines started malfunctioning and the tear vanished for unknown reasons from the sensors. Nothing registered anywhere within a forty meter area in all directions and an invisible and intangible bubble of radio dead space just popped up over their operation point. Everyone outside the bubble was still getting readings of some kind and were shouting at the team near the tear that something was most certainly happening. Then the spells that were suppose to allow the DoM team a better look at what the tear was doing to the world around it, backfired and killed two people immediately, causing an earthquake that the rest of the world surely felt in some way. It all came to a head right after that when the screams of the damned that were too close to the tear when the spells backfired echoed strangely around the area, as if they were a recording on a repeated loop, fading in and out rapidly. Everything seemed blurred and warped within the bubble, now a visible bubble due to the distortions, like looking through water that was being hammered by a heavy rain.</p><p>No more than five seconds later the Emergency Recall Ward, which would portkey the team back to the clearing they launched from upon sensing danger, activated and also failed...spectacularly. The result was both truly horrifying and funny in that "it only happens to you" kind of way.</p><p>Oh the recall worked, to an extent, in that it did it's job in taking the team back to where it came from, but who ever designed the ward forgot to factor in that the team could possibly be MOVING at the time of recall, and due to the strange waves of quickly displaced air from the 'Event', the affected were moving fast as they were tossed away from the epicenter.</p><p>One part of the team, which comprised of a few Aurors and one Unspeakable, went "home" in a nasty shower of very wet gore that spread on the ground in a fine mist on this end. The screaming coming from the clearing on the other side of the trees let Harry know they got a bit more than mist over there. The other part of the team, which was Harry, the two now dead-from-the-explosion Aurors and one technician Hermione sent, were left behind close to the core of the 'Event'. The technician was suppose to handle the many devices they were using to make sure everything was safe, which he did do quite well until this all started, and only survived the explosion due to his fast reflexes.</p><p>The next few moments were filled with Harry pulling the much older man through the gauntlet of near invisible anomalies that started showing up around them in short spurts; devastating anything they came in contact with for more than a second. They looked like vertical puddles of water shifting in size and clarity, rippling like the surface of a lake when a pebble is skipped across it. An ominous low hum emitted from them that also had a soft crackling background noise like electricity or a small fire.</p><p>The sight of burnt grass and mangled metal that got shat out of one of the fading anomalies was enough to cause both Harry and the technician with him to stick their hands into their pockets and start frantically rubbing the stones the secondary Recall Wards were installed on.</p><p>The user's magic was suppose to enable these Personal Recall Stones and have them act like single user portkeys, just in case the team was separated too far apart for the Emergency Recall Ward to grab up as a whole. Each member had a Stone and it could only be activated by being rubbed quickly in a hand, to ensure it wasn't accidentally turned on when the wearer put something in the pocket with it.</p><p>And of course it was right about the time that the secondary Recall Wards activated that Harry's companion made a misstep in his backpedaling, pulling himself and Harry into the path of one of the more obviously violent temporal anomalies; a bird had gotten pulled into it moments earlier and came out the other side as tiny and new as if it had just hatched, but just as the bird was about to hit the ground, it inverted in a sick way, seemingly turning inside out before falling apart in a manner that suggested a sharp knife had cut it up.</p><p>And that's where Harry was right now, watching what was left of his team, the tech, fall backward in slow motion toward that same dangerous anomaly. Harry was still gripping the man by the front of his coat, the only place he could grab quickly when the whole thing went to shit, and was being pulled along with the other man into what was surely their death. The smell of metal, blood, sick, trees, animals and human waste...all flooded the area near the anomaly as the two were almost sucked right into it.</p><p>In the instant that their bodies almost hit the anomaly, something else happened, the air around the two wizards moved oddly and they were both suddenly pulled in a different direction, toward the center of the original tear. Harry could only just make out the shouts of horror from the other teams outside the bubble as they notified each other that the tear was expanding rapidly, sucking in things closest to it and spitting out things from somewhere else entirely. Both the tech and Harry himself were snatched up in the tear and for just a moment, Harry thought he saw another version of this very part of Wales being laid over his vision of the current catastrophe, only it wasn't a bunch of panicking wizards he got a glimpse of.</p><p>It was a group of frantic Muggles with big black cars and important looking flashing lights, and a man wearing a blue pinstriped suit, red shoes of some kind and a pair of wire rimmed glasses, was standing just outside the bubble, one arm raised with a bit of glowing equipment in his hand, squinting at them as if he wasn't sure he was actually seeing anything or if it was just a trick of the light. Then a sharp yet incomplete jerk at Harry's navel told him the Stones were trying to take them back to the meeting point, but were unable to finish due to the strength of the vortex that had grabbed them and the alternate Wales was pulled away from them.</p><p>'Oh Teddy, I'm so sorry'</p><p>Harry's whole world became nothing but an alternating blue and white light so bright it burned his eyes even when closed, unintelligible musical voices shouted and an unidentifiable howling sound so loud his ears felt like they would burst. And under the howling was a beat, some strange noise banging out four times with a metallic sort of ring to it, echoing softly under all the other sounds being thrown at them. It was also quite cold but not a cold Harry was used to, it was bone deep and thrummed with a throbbing ache and a piercing, ripping pain crawled throughout his entire being like an army of very angry and very large ants. Something was very wrong with this type of cold but Harry couldn't place what exactly screamed wrong about it. The scents from the anomaly previous were now so overpowering he was sure his sense of smell was ruined forever. He felt like his very being was melting in this place, being pulled apart slowly bit by bit and not being put back together again.</p><p>In all the event felt like it lasted for days but perhaps only a few seconds had passed before everything just stopped.</p><p>There was no sound, no light, no smells, no tastes and nothing to touch, but more importantly, there appeared to be a sudden lack of air... And an almighty pressure was pressing in on him from every direction along with that terrible cold. But then even that stopped, he had no connection to his body or so it felt like as he now had no input from it. Harry wasn't even sure he existed at this moment, his body was nothing, his thoughts were all he had, all he was. He could feel the other one's mind, the one he came here with, also moving with him, riding along and touching everything. Harry was so much more than before, everywhere all at once, every-when all at once, his magic and his thoughts spreading out to all of time, the other doing the same, until there was nothing and Harry's thoughts became slow, the other faded from his mind, and finally everything seized up. Magic screamed and Harry wasn't anything at this moment, he was nowhere and no-when, there was no Harry.</p><p>Thought slowly returned, trickling in like determined oil through a strainer, sluggish and thick. The feeling of something other worldly watching him tugged at the little bit of his awareness that was starting up again, like a computer being rebooted after a terrible crash; this other wasn't the one that had come with him, this one was old and new, bigger and smaller. It too stretched out and touched everything and nothing all at once, but it did so in such a way as to suggest it was always like this, it had no other way of being but that it could be something else if it wanted.</p><p>It was curious, Harry didn't know how he knew this, how he knew it was a living thing of at all, only that he knew deep down in his very soul that he wasn't alone here and was being regarded with a sense of startled fascination. It, whatever it was, pulled on him, tugging him away from wherever this empty place of nothing but thought was. He felt the other now too, the one he had been holding what felt like so long ago and yet only a moment ago. They were both of them now in the grasp of the curious thing, being toyed with as if this great awareness were nothing but a very old child that had found a new pair of pets to play with.</p><p>Then it threw them away, not because it was bored, but because it was curious as to what would happen, Harry felt this, knew that it wasn't malicious. They drifted as nothing but thought for a long while, going farther away from the thing in this no-place, feeling it still watching them with amusement and wonder.</p><p>End Chapter one.</p>
