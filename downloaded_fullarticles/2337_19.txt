          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Stunners won’t work, I need to strategize.”</p>
<p>The group of Hufflepuff 6<sup>th</sup> years grew quiet again as pages turned.</p>
<p>“Conjunctivitis curse to the eyes?”</p>
<p>“They are the weakest point...”</p>
<p>“What if you get trampled? Do you lose points for getting hurt?”</p>
<p>“Probably,” Cedric sighed. “We need flashy, something creatively impressive that will keep me safe and show off my skills.”</p>
<p>“What if the dragon went after something else? Distract it then pull out the binding spells to tie it down while it goes after . . . whatever you distract it with.”</p>
<p>“You’re spot on with transfiguration, mate. Might work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>✯o✯</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Diggory, a moment of your time after class.”</p>
<p>“Yes Professor.”</p>
<p>The 6<sup>th</sup> years made their way to the exit, Cedric’s friends waiting just down the hall.</p>
<p>“I wanted to comment you on your excellent grasp of inanimate and animate transfiguration.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Professor.”</p>
<p>“May I inquire as to how you decided on a labrador?”</p>
<p>“One of my dorm mates developed some photos of her parents’ dog from the summer and it was so goofy and loud I figured it would work perfectly to distract the dragon.” Cedric said, rubbing the back of his neck and grinning hopefully at his Professor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>✯o✯</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Biggest drawback of being a champion?”</p>
<p>“Not playing in pickup games because of the TriWizard Tournament is definitely a drawback.”</p>
<p>“Missing me isn’t?” Cho smirked, walking slower as they talked.</p>
<p>“It gives me the chance to dance with you.”</p>
<p>“When does it do that?”</p>
<p>“When you accompany me to the Yule Ball.”</p>
<p>“So self-assured.”</p>
<p>“Merely attempting to project confidence.”</p>
<p>“Are you as confident in your dancing skills as this?” At this, she gestures vaguely around, indicating the general situation.</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“It’s a date then,” and Cho entered the women’s locker room, the closing door cutting off any reply Cedric voiced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>✯o✯</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the steam dispersed throughout the room, Cedric sighed, picking up the golden egg yet again. He had spent many nights pondering the screeching clue after a relaxing soak – the only way he can tolerate that heinous noise long enough to work on his checklist for a bit: nothing that sounds like a spell, no Latin or French or Romanian.</p>
<p>Cedric picked up the egg and opened it just as a translucent head broke the surface of the cooling bath. With a startled yelp, he dropped the egg into the water and dove to retrieve it as Myrtle began laughing.</p></div>
