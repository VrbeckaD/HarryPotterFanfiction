    <p>Percival Graves and Credence Barebone sat at the dining room table eating breakfast delivered from Mr. Kowalski's bakery. The air between them was silent and comfortable. Credence was perfectly content to spend time with his husband before the man went to work, while Graves thought the same of his young husband who would be staying home.</p><p>The danishes from Mr. Kowalski's bakery were excellent as ever. Credence had miserably failed in trying to politely eat his - the cravings Tina warned him about had begun to hit and Mr. Kowalski's baked goods smelled oh so good. His face flushed bright red as nearly half of his danish was gone and Graves' wasn't. Though, the older man didn't have a knack for a sweet tooth.</p><p>Graves, on the other hand, watched Credence fondly from across the table. The younger man wore this new and unexpected but welcomed (after a slight breakdown) pregnancy very well. He noted thoughtfully that Credence had gained some rounded curves to the sharp angles of his face and body. He couldn't be more proud to see their love physically bloom.</p><p>A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he curiously noted a light struggle cross his husband's face. Credence knew the other was watching him, and his face heated but his eyes remained focused on the center of the table as he concentrated... concentrated in not ripping his clothes.</p><p>His buttoned-down top had been straining to cover his growing abdomen for the past few days but it seemed the material was deciding enough was enough.</p><p>He felt it a tad bit slower than the material felt it, but he didn't have time to stop it. His eyes widened slightly and Graves tensed, his heart skipping a beat and worry starting to creep over his curiosity. A question was on the tip of his tongue when it happened.</p><p>The last bite of danish was the tipping point - or ripping point - for the stretched material. Two buttons popped audibly, bursting from Credence's shirt and hitting - for heaven's sake! - Percival's knee before clicking to the floor.</p><p>Credence bit his lip and tried in vain to hide the beet red flush that crawled up his neck, dusted his cheeks, and finished at the tips of his ears. He found himself unable to meet Percy's eyes. He ducked his head at an angle, very embarrassed and even a little ashamed.</p><p>The older man reached across the table, sensing the need to assure his Credence he did nothing wrong, and rested his hand over his. He squeezed his hand, giving Credence a small and encouraging smile when those brown eyes quickly glanced up and away. "Do not fret. I will have new clothes made for you, my love." He ran his thumb over Credence's knuckle. "Perhaps Tina can give Todd some of her maternity clothes to use as a base for yours, and we can take your measurements every month."</p><p>Credence looked at him through his eyelashes. His cheeks were still flushed and his shoulders shrugged in a bit apologetic and embarrassed manner. "I'm sorry," he said because he didn't know what else to say. Even after all this time, he found himself reverting back to those habits that had been driven into his head.</p><p>Percival gave his hand another squeeze. "Do not apologize."</p><p>Another comfortable silence settled between them and neither complained. The flush of Credence's cheeks lessened and he managed to take a deep breath, exhaling shyly as he met his husband's warm hazel eyes. The corner of his mouth quirked upward and he tried not to hide his face again.</p><p>Credence and his confidence had really improved from the way Grindelwald had left him. It hadn't been an easy or quick process for either of them, but Percival held the patience Credence needed. Graves' blood still boiled at times when he was left to his thoughts, remembering receiving the news that Grindelwald had used <em>his</em> face to deceive Credence... They took this new life, this second chance, and worked through the distrust in the beginning - was it really Graves that was before Credence once more? or was it the impostor? Together, they managed in healing from the abuse Grindelwald had inflicted on them. Though the pieces left behind were jagged and nightmarish, they were mended and restored by the determination of Graves and the strength of Credence.</p><p>Their romantic love bloomed after their strengthened friendship settled. Like two new lovers, it was slow and shy. After a year of courting, they were married, sealing the deal that they would handle whatever life threw their way together. Even if in this unpredictable world, unexpected events happen and through an honest accident - a flu that had persisted for at least three weeks - discovering Credence's natural ability to bear children.</p><p>Their new life was turning out quite alright.</p><p>Presently, this quiet moment where the two could just sit content with one another's company was short-lived as it was every day. Credence watched Percival turn his head and glance out the window, a faint look of reluctance passing over his husband's face - he needed to leave.</p><p>The man cleared his throat and stood up. He cleared their dishes from the table the no-maj way, giving Credence time to stand and meet him at the front door. Much like each morning, Credence would see Percival off to work.</p><p>With his briefcase waiting at the base of the door, Graves straightened his suit and tossed on his coat. His eyes went to Credence and his hand found its home in the curve of his husband's back. His eyes were crinkled with a soft tenderness he reserved only for Credence. "I will return late. Picquery insists I train new recruits with Goldstein." A twinge of humor laced his voice, probably thinking of how Tina's new motherly antics were causing trouble at work.</p><p>Credence smiled.</p><p>"Then, on my way home, I'll stop in at Todd's (his personal tailor) and see about getting you some new clothes." He ran his other hand along the curve of Credence's jaw, his thumb coming to rest just below the younger man's bottom lip. His face held both mischief and pride.</p><p>Credence's shoulder twitched but he fought to keep it still and not shrug shyly. He wouldn't hide his emotions from Percy, even as his face warmed at the knowledge of the man starting to spoil him. He allowed his eyes to meet the other's before he reached for the blue scarf that hung by the door. He looped it around the Percival's neck and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. A smile crept onto his lips at the light blush that covered Percy's face.</p><p>Graves' lips held a tender smile of their own but his eyes were tinted with sadness. Parting from Credence always hurt him the most - it was something he dreaded every day. Would he be alright alone? Would he grow tired of being cooped up here? Would he step outside for some fresh air and if so, would trouble find him? What would happen if Credence needed him but he was unreachable? What if something happened to their child? The questions never stopped swirling inside his head.</p><p>Credence noted the slight crease to Percival's brow. He was worrying again, thinking too far ahead. He rested his hands on the man's chest, drawing him back to reality.</p><p>He gave a firm nod; he truly must leave or else there would be hell to pay with Picquery and maybe a hormonal Goldstein. He kissed Credence's lips before turning for the door. His hand was on the doorknob before a startling thought crossed his mind. He faced Credence, his eyes set firmly.</p><p>It was Credence's turn to frown. What could have Percy so- oh. Yes, that could have something to do with it. He bit his lip.</p><p>"We'll continue with your lessons when I get home," he said. "Remember, you cannot do everything - especially so soon." He gestured to Credence's midsection. "Please, Credence. I have your word I will not find you as I did last week?"</p><p>Credence flushed with embarrassment at the memory of Percival scolding him for practicing magic (it was defensive spells and transfiguration) while not only pregnant but alone and inexperienced. "You have my word."</p><p>A heavy weight seemed to lift from Graves' shoulders - Credence would be alright. "Very good," he managed out with a relieved nod. He could leave now.</p><p>He turned the knob and opened the door, stepping out onto the porch. He looked at Credence. "I love you." And he meant it just as much as he had since the first time he spoke it.</p><p>The younger man nodded, joining him outside. His hands traveled to Percival's neat hair and ghosted over it but didn't touch it. "I love you too. Please be careful."</p><p>Emotions tugged at his heart. "I will," he assured. He knew Credence would always worry - perhaps even more than Graves worried about him - that someone like Grindelwald would disrupt their life again.</p><p>But nothing ever did.</p>
