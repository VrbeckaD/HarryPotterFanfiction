    <p>April 2027</p><p>Heart racing, Scorpius paced around the corridor of Malfoy Manor, running his hands through the blond hair that had actuallu been combed for this specific occasion. It was something he always did when he was stressed or nervous. Today was the day. His boyfriend Albus was going to have tea with Scorpius' father. Not just a regular, get together-type dinner, but to ask for his blessing to marry his son. But Draco, being, well, Draco, meant this wouldn't be an easy task. Not an easy task at all. Regardless, Scorpius was confident. Well, sort of.</p><p>He knew that he loved Albus. Ever since the boy had formed an opinion on him based off his character and personality, not by his notorious bloodline. That was when he knew Albus was special. He had a huge heart, a caring one, that made Scorpius' own soar with joy and elation, and blush like a schoolgirl even years later.</p><p>Snapping out of his anxious trance, he stopped pacing, for at this rate, it was a marvel that the floor was still intact. Pressing one ear to the mahogany door, Scorpius listened intently to the muffled voices over clinking silverware.</p><p>Albus awkwardly stirred his mashed potatoes in a circle, giving Draco a nervous grin in attempt to ease the uncomfortable silence. </p><p>"So...nice weather today, sir?" Albus said. </p><p>"I hate small talk, You're just like your father." Draco grumbled bluntly, shooting Albus a look that could either be interpreted as judgemental or amused. Or perhaps both at the same time. "And don't call me sir. It makes me feel dreadfully old." </p><p>"Right. Sorry." Albus coughed. "I actually, well...I wanted to talk to you about something." </p><p>Draco blinked slowly, his silver eyes bearing into Albus' soul, which he used as a chance to proceed with the question he’d been waiting to ask for so long. </p><p>"You know I love Scorpius." Albus said. "More than anything. He's...well, you know how wonderful he is," he rambled slightly, a fond grin forming on his face. "I think, maybe, we could-"<br/>
Suddenly, a piece of food lodged in his windpipe. All of his gasping, wheezing, and attempting to hack out the piece of meat seemed to take forever. Draco even checked his watch, his stone cold expression not leaving his pale, gaunt face, even if Albus was choking to death. </p><p>Scorpius sighed from the other room, strongly considering banging his head against the wall, There was no way his father would even /consider/ giving the couple his blessing now, what with Albus making an utter fool of himself. He stepped away, too embarrassed to merely listen anymore. </p><p>Once the coughing had come to a stop, and the young man had choked up soggy food. It flew through the air and landed on Draco's nose. "Sorry."</p><p>"You are wearing my patience thin, Potter." Draco said, wiping his nose with a napkin. </p><p> </p><p>"I am so, so sorry." Albus said, handing Draco more napkins. "That was incredibly rude and downright disgusting of me-" He leaned over, trying to clean up Draco's face but instead knocked over his goblet of wine, directly on the man's lap. "Shit! I mean damn! I mean...sorry. Let me just..." He backed away slowly. </p><p>"That would be wise." Draco said darkly, wiping at his trousers. "Now, go on with what you had to say." </p><p>“Okay, um...I rehearsed this all in my head beforehand. and now that it's happening, I'm not sure if I can do it, but..." He sighed.<br/>
"I want nothing more than to marry your son. I know we're both men and that probably tarnishes the Malfoy bloodline or whatever, but I think...no, I-I know I can take care of him. I love him, Draco, sir. I really, truly do." </p><p>"Potter," Draco began, setting his fork down. "My parents were not happy when Astoria and I married. And after all, I am not my father. All I want is happiness for my son, and no foolish worried about making sure the Malfoy line stays intact. If it dies with him, so be it. However, Albus, that display was embarrassing, even for you." </p><p>Albus looked down, cheeks flushed. He wasn’t sure whether to chuckle or to be ashamed. </p><p>"However," Draco said, smiling for the first time that night. "I cannot think of anyone better suited for Scorpius. Though you both seem so young...would it not be wise to wait another year or two?"<br/>
Albus shook his head. “I’ve been waiting too long for this, sir. And Scorpius just turned twenty one, which is technically far past being of age and-”<br/>
Draco raised his hand. “I was only making a suggestion. I am perfectly fine with you marrying my son.”<br/>
He moved across the table, and firmly shook the hand of an awestruck and slightly dazed Albus. "Take care of him, Albus, please. And if you even consider hurting him, be warned, I was a former Death Eater." His lips twitched slightly, making Albus shrink back and laugh it off. </p><p>Albus, nodded dumbly. "Y-Yes sir." He stood up and adjusted his dress robes. "Um...thank you, sir-" </p><p>"YES!" A muffled voice that could only belong to Scorpius came from behind the door outside, followed by a jubilant squeal. "Yesyeyesyesyes!" Scorpius barged through the door and tackled Albus, making the latter yelp in surprise.</p><p>“We did it, Al. We’re getting /married/,” Scorpius gaped, throwing his arms around his new fiancee. “How’re you feeling?”</p><p>A lonely tear rolled down the brunette’s cheek. “I know, Scorp,” he said into the boy’s shoulder. “It’s-it’s the best feeling in the whole world,”</p><p>And he meant it.</p>
