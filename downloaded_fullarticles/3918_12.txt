  <u> <strong>None But The Brave Deserve The Fair – The Prologue</strong></u>
</p><p>Harry Potter slumped in his chair at the Burrow, nursing his cup of tea. He had spent the evening silently seething; watching the poncy, blond bastard insinuate himself further into Harry's adopted clan. Malfoy was having an animated conversation with Bill Weasley about famous and unpleasant curses through the ages; many, it seemed, had been cast by a Malfoy on a Weasley and vice versa. Some had even been invented by an ancestor with a member of the other family in mind.</p><p>At least this conversation was mildly interesting. Earlier he had been treated to Malfoy and Percy giggling about ministry gossip, with Malfoy stage-whispering, “Really, then what did Shacklebolt say?”</p><p>He felt as if he had spent the evening trying unsuccessfully to tune out the pointy pillock. He had not needed to see Malfoy’s orgasmic face over the dinner table. The slimy sod had eaten three helpings of Molly Weasley’s Lamb &amp; Apricot Casserole, exclaiming, “So much better than our old house elves. How DO you get the lamb so tender?” Mrs Weasley had blushed furiously, launching into some complicated speech about marinades. And though Harry had left half of his on the plate she hadn’t noticed.</p><p>He had not enjoyed Malfoy and Ron bickering good-heartedly about Quidditch and the latest Beater for the Chudley Cannons, especially Malfoy’s pontificating, “Well, with Sheckley on the team, they can’t stay bottom of the league for much longer!”</p><p>He had heard Malfoy in the background throughout the evening. Childish though it was, he felt like he was being mocked by the smug bastard.</p><p>The rotten icing on an even more rotten cake had been Malfoy and Ginny discussing fabric for Ginny’s forthcoming nuptials to Michael Corner. Here the loudest phrase had been a very poof-y, “An ivory would make your skin so luminous but white would make you look like you were suffering from Consumption.”</p><p>Malfoy had even read a Muggle bedtime story to Victoire Weasley. Something about a multi-coloured elephant, that Hermione had brought with her. The image of Victoire’s chubby little arms around the neck of her newest ‘uncle’ made Harry sick. Anything around Malfoy’s lily-white, aristocratically pure-blood neck should rightly be throttling him.<br/> He had ground his teeth so much they ached.</p><p>Harry longed for the Good Old Days at Hogwarts, where That Smarmy Git Malfoy was loathed by all sensible Gryffindors, red-headed or not. He was not convinced by the New, Improved Malfoy, the Hero of the Weasley World, All Round Good Guy, and the Brand New Adopted Son of Arthur and Molly.</p><p>He finished his now cold tea and got up to leave. Molly made a half-hearted offer of leftovers, "Just in case you get hungry on the way home to dinner." Harry forced a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes and went outside to Apparate home. Once there, he took a Headache Potion and went to bed.</p><p>His nose was firmly out of joint.</p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p><br/>"His nose was firmly out of joint" is both a British expression AND a literary quote. In this case it means he was resentful, pushed out of his normal top-billing, slighted.</p><p><br/>Malfoy reads Victoire, 'Elmer the Patchwork Elephant' by David McKee, a story about diversity and acceptance.</p>
