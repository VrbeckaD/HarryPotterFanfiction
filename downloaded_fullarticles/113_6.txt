    <p>
  <span>On July 30th, at midnight, Harry awoke in soaked sheets, his thighs sticky, writhing in pain as his abdominal muscles cramped and released. He groaned as he tried to exit the bed, and almost retched all over the floor. He slid out of the bed, landing with a thump, and sat up shaking. Hedwig clicked at him, and he shushed her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop.” He hissed as he pushed himself up. She continued to nip at the cage, and screeched as he approached. “Hedwig, seriously. Hang on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nipped at his fingers as he unlatched her cage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hedwig!” He whispered. “Please be quiet!” He opened the cage and limped to the window. “Go to Ron's.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The owl nipped his fingers again when she landed on the window sill, chirping like mad.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go to Ron's, I'll be fine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She chirped again and then took off, leaving him to whatever horrible issue he was having. At least she would be safe from the consequences.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He moved on to strip the bed, he'd sweat and it was everywhere, muddling up his room with its scent. He gagged, throwing the bed linens into the corner. His spine tingled before a fresh, cooling wave of wetness spread across the back of his thighs. Groaning in disgust, he removed his slacks and shorts. The night air made his feverish skin stop itching, and he reached back to touch the fluid oozing out of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What's wrong with me?” He whispered, groaning again when he saw the fluid was clear and smelled of peaches. It awakened something in the back of his mind, and like some sleeping giant, it rose to take over.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His groans changed, he could feel it happen in his throat. Suddenly, the pain was gone and his mind cleared enough to assess his situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His left arm ached from holding his weight, his knees burned against the hardwood floor, but that warmth spreading from his backside made him sag. His fingers had settled inside him, plugging the rush of fluids and resting against his prostate. It felt good, like his body needed the intrusion to survive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Embarrassed, he moved his wrist, and his index brushed against his prostate. It sent electricity through his limbs, and his muscles shook, giving him enough reason to pause. In those scarce moments, he managed to position himself better, relieving his knees and palm of the strain. He leaned against his mattress, sweat dripping down his back and face, fingers still deep inside him. He panted under the heat, but he pressed on, moving his thighs apart and leaning back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was weird, but it alleviated the abdominal pain </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> the emptiness he felt in his belly. His cock was harder than it had ever been in his whole life, and it made his actions slightly less weird, at least in his mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wondered wildly, for a fleeting moment, if he would be able to keep his fingers in the right place and sleep at the same time. But the moment he withdrew to shift, the pain returned tenfold.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By the time the sun was rising above his neighbor's roof, he hadn't moved much, trying to keep the pain at bay. But his back ached from the abnormal position, and his erection hadn't flagged even a little. He decided to go for it, and pressed the pad of his middle finger into the nub inside him. It was deliberate, but deadly as the sensation had him sweating and panting again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Merlin,” he cursed, trying to roll his hips forward. The movement made the sensation grow, pooling in his belly just below his navel. He was tired, and wet all over. His toes curled with every shock of pleasure, and he had to stuff his other hand in his mouth to keep quiet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The knock on his bedroom door sent panic through his skin, and it crawled. He threw the comforter over himself with his free hand and removed his fingers, pain lanced through his body immediately. He groaned weakly as the cramps resumed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Boy, get up and do you- oh!” Petunia said as the door opened, and he must have looked pitiful. Her eyes narrowed as she took in the room. “Where's the bird?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I- I sent her away,” he panted, and his throat felt dry. His body wanted, and he just wanted her to go away, not to witness this embarrassment of a disaster. “She was making too much noise.” He groaned and curled in on himself as a particularly bad cramp knotted his insides.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She just sniffed at him in disgust. “Good riddance, that diseased bird can stay away for all I care. What about you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not doing good.” He swallowed hard. “Just leave me be, and I'll be better tomorrow.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine, no dinner tonight.” She said, and left. No reason to stay any longer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It didn't matter, his friends had sent cakes and pumpkin juice yesterday morning, but he felt like puking instead of eating. He just wanted time to deal with this issue, and then to get back up on his feet and move on.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>----------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>On July 31st, Severus received a letter from the Headmaster of Hogwarts. It was an official letter, addressed to the Professor and not the man. He assumed it was an all-staff party invitation and ignored it in favor of finishing the last of his potions. But the letter seemed to follow him into his laboratory, and everywhere he turned, it would be sitting innocuously among his things.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, as his Shrinking solution entered the last and most independent phase of brewing, he relented and opened the letter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Professor Severus Snape,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>This is an official notice of a presenting student. Mr. Harry James Potter has been documented as an Omega, and requires a guardian of a certain standing among the Professors of Hogwarts. Albus Dumbledore has nominated both you and Minerva McGonagall as Mr. Potter's guardian.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>You have twenty-four hours to respond, should you wish to take on this responsibility. Otherwise, the second nominee shall take the position. We look forward to hearing from you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Signed,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Silvia Augus</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Head of the Department of Litigations and Liaisons</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>M.O.M</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shock. Maybe resentment. He wasn't sure how he felt. He would rather be de-spining </span>
  <b>
    <em>Mimbus Mimbletonia</em>
  </b>
  <span>, to be quite frank. But Albus had nominated him, ahead of Minerva, with no one else after her. He was considered the boy's only lifeline.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, that had always been the case; he'd been chasing that boy and cleaning up his messes for six years now, he certainly couldn't just </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop</span>
  </em>
  <span> because someone </span>
  <em>
    <span>else</span>
  </em>
  <span> could take the reigns. That would be nothing less than abandoning the boy, in his greatest time of need even.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sighing, he Summoned a quill and some parchment to scribble down his assent, and sent all of it to the Department Head's desk. In a few short hours, he would have to leave his home in Spinner's End and begin his internment as Harry Potter's guardian. He wondered how the boy would react, as he poured himself a significant amount of alcohol to nurse for a while.</span>
