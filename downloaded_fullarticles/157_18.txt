    <p>Urgent footsteps echoed in the empty corridor on the seventh floor as Hermione paced in front of a blank wall.  She needed a place to hide. She needed a place to sulk and not be bothered for a couple of hours. She needed a place that will grant her the warmth and safety that she is currently missing.  She looked up after the third pass and a small tired smile tugged on her face. She approached the plain wooden door that wasn’t there a second ago and pushed it open with shaky hands.  </p>
<p>Once again, her one true companion had not disappointed her.  She first read about the Room of Requirements in <em> Hogwarts:  A History </em> back before starting at Hogwarts <em> . </em>  She remembered the excitement of learning that magic was real and the urge to learn everything about the Wizarding World and the school she would be attending.  She devoured the book in a matter of days and tried to commit everything to memory. The Room was casually mentioned in a short paragraph about the tapestry depicting Barnabus the Barmy teaching tolls to ballet.  Rumor has it that a secret room would sometimes appear opposite the tapestry to those in need. Young Hermione didn’t think much about it; she was more fascinated about how the magical ceiling in the Great Hall worked or why Muggle electronic devices won’t function on school grounds.  Discovering that the Chambers of Secret actually existed last year, and being alienated by her supposed best friends had her in a desperate search for the secret room.  </p>
<p>She walked into a circular space that was a combination of her living room and a library.  A large recliner and a sofa surrounded a glass coffee table facing a grand fireplace instead of the TV set she had at home.  The walls were covered from the ceiling to the floor with books both muggle and magical. She curled up in the recliner and pulled a duvet over herself, it smelled like the laundry detergent she uses back at home.  Closing her eyes, she tried to let the quiet crackling of the fire fill her numb mind. When the tears started to fall, she didn’t even try to stop them.</p>
<p>She knew what to expect from Malfoy and the Slytherins.  A Mudblood. That’s all she was and will ever be, despite that she was the top of her class and the brightest witch of her age.  Mudblood. How she hated that word. She’s learned to deal with them though; every time they try to tear down her wall, she builds it back up, higher and stronger, until it is impenetrable by the snakes.  Each time they throw the word in her face, Mudblood, she reminds them of her worth by besting them and outsmarting them at their own game.  </p>
<p>But her walls weren't as concrete as she thought—they currently lay in ruins, smashed by the two people she considered her best friends.  Harry was angry at her because she went to McGonagall about the Firebolt. She knew it would upset him, but she would never forgive herself if something happened to him if the broom was cursed.  He didn’t see it her way though. He believed she betrayed him and he could be particularly nasty when he wanted to be. Ron was beyond furious with her and murderous towards Crookshanks. He was convinced that her cat ate Scabbers.  She asked for proof. He mentioned some blood on his bedsheets and his missing rat. She pointed out how his evidence was flimsy at best and proved nothing. He blew up as soon as her words left her mouth. She never expected him to use that word.  Mudblood. Her walls crumbled. She left, refusing to cry in front of him. Yes, she could have handled the situation more delicately. But logically, she didn’t do anything wrong—Siris Black was out there looking to kill Harry, it made sense to have the broom examined for sabotage; Scabbers was missing but without a body and concrete evidence, all Ron had was hateful accusations.  So why was she the only one at fault and the one receiving all of their anger? Eventually, the tears stopped but she was too exhausted to move. She curled up around herself more in the recliner and fell asleep, her fists clenched the duvet with desperation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione woke up slowly.  Her neck and back protested when she shifted position.  The clock sitting on top of the mantle of the fireplace told her it’s 5 in the morning.  It was Saturday, no classes, no homework to do, no extracurricular activities to attend to, no reason to leave this chair.  She covered her face with the duvet and willed herself to go back to sleep. Her stomach growled in displeasure, reminding her that she didn't have anything to eat since lunch yesterday.  She ignored it.</p>
<p>A soft purring pulled her from her slumber 3 hours later.  She glanced at the comfortable warm weight on her hip. Crooks looked back at her expectantly, demanding food.  She sighed and finally moved from her safe haven. It was still early on the weekend, hopefully, most of the students would still be in their dorms.  She didn’t want to interact with anyone right now.  </p>
<p>Her familiar meowed at her the whole trek down to breakfast trying to get her to walk faster.  She tried, she really did but her body felt like lead and she couldn’t summon any energy besides the bare minimum.  When she finally reached the Great Hall, she spotted Ginny at the Gryffindor table. Cursing under her breath, she lingered out of sight.  Why couldn’t things just go smoothly for once? Sneak in, feed Crooks, go back to the Room. It was a simple plan. But the presence of the redhead complicated everything.  Ginny was there when she and Ron had their screaming match and the redhead probably noticed the brunette never returned to her dorm last night. Ginny was a good friend and is always supportive; she knew that.  But she really didn’t want to answer her questions or pretend everything was alright.  </p>
<p>Crookshanks meowed impatiently, looking up at her with big round eyes.  Hermione sighed and picked up her grumpy cat. When she bent down, the gold chain around her neck slipped out of her robes.  An idea popped into her mind. She slipped the chain around Crookshanks’s neck and flipped the Time-Turner 3 times.  </p>
<p>The Great Hall was completely empty now when she took a seat.  Food appeared in front of her and Crooks munched on a piece of chicken happily.   She stared blankly at her bowl of oatmeal; it was her favorite, blueberries and peaches with cream and a pinch of cinnamon.  Her stomach growled again but she had no appetite. A furry head bumped her right hand, drawing her attention. The cat purred loudly and batted at her bowl, his intelligent yellow eyes never leaving hers.  Hermione wanted to cry again but held back her tears. Instead, she dutifully picked up a spoon and took a few bites.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione strolled between the dusty shelves in the Room of Requirement.  It was larger this time. Her recliner and the fireplace still existed in a small enclave close to the entrance, but hidden beyond that were rows and rows of bookshelves filled to the brink.  She spent the past 2 hours perusing these shelves until her past self left with Crookshanks for breakfast. She really loved that cat.  </p>
<p>Upon returning to her seat, she noticed a small leather-bound book on the glass coffee table.  There was no title that would give her a clue to its contents. Placing the books in her arm down, she picked it up.  The magic of the room will provide her with what she needed; but what did she desire besides some peace and quiet? Better friends?  She scoffed at herself. She loved her two idiot boys and she knew they loved her back. She would rebuild her walls. Then, whatever they were going through right now will pass and everything will go back to normal.  She had to believe that. Besides, she really doubted a book or any spell would be able to fix that aspect of her life right now. So what is it that she desired? Whatever it was, the Room must have gifted her this book for a reason.  She curled up in her recliner and started reading.</p>
<p>The book, if you could call it that—it seemed more like someone’s notebook, contained a miscellaneous of spells, rituals, and potions.  While a spell that would enchant a bag to hold more than physically possible, a potion that would extend your senses, or a ritual that would allow your spirit to leave your physical body for a short period was interesting, she didn’t really have a use for them right now.  The only thing that really caught her interest was the detailed process of becoming an animagus. Her mind always functioned better when it was focused on something—it allowed her to ignore the ever-present void that lingered in the periphery. Schoolwork was a nice distraction, but it was all too easy even with her extra courses.  The long, tedious and meticulous process of becoming an animagus seemed like the perfect solution. She put the book down and stared into the fire. How was she going to break into Professor Snape’s storage this time?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Things got better.  But at the same time, it didn’t.  Third-year ended with the trio back as a united front facing down an escaped convict that was actually innocent, a pet rat that was actually a wizard, a professor that was actually a werewolf and a swarm of soul-sucking dementors.  Fourth-year started out rocky with the whole ordeal at the Quidditch World Cup. When Harry got picked as the fourth champion, Hermione tried her best to balance between her two feuding friends despite herself. When Rita published her article, she spent a whole day soaring above the castle in her animagus form, a common kestrel.  It was relaxing being able to escape from everything and just enjoy the wind in her feathers. It was freeing being able to enjoy the open air and not suffocate in her own mind. When the Yule Ball was upon them and Ron opened his stupid mouth, everything got too much again.  </p>
<p><em>“Hermione, Neville’s right - you </em> are <em> a girl...” </em></p>
<p>How dare he?  </p>
<p>
  <em> “Well - you can come with one of us!” </em>
</p>
<p>Who exactly did he think he was?  </p>
<p>
  <em> “No, you’re not!  You just said that to get rid of Neville!” </em>
</p>
<p>She wanted to punch him.  What kind of person did he think she was?  And the audacity to question her! What would she even gain from lying about something as trivial as this?</p>
<p>She felt her walls crack.</p>
<p>“You’re not good enough,” a voice whispered in her head.  “You’re not wanted. You’re nothing but a last resort.”</p>
<p>A numbness washed over her.  </p>
<p>Ron grinned.  His mouth moved but she couldn’t hear what he was saying.</p>
<p>“Mudblood” echoed in her mind.</p>
<p>Her walls crumbled.</p>
<p>She fled.</p>
<p>She wanted to go to the owlery to transform and fly but her feet took her to the seventh floor instead.  Her recliner and fireplace greeted her warmly. She wrapped herself in the blanket that smelled like home and sank into the chair.  She felt the despair and the loneliness digging their claws in. She felt the void creeping in. She didn't do anything to stop them.   She didn’t even have any energy to cry.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pretending she was fine was getting harder and harder.  Fleur caught her zoning out multiple times and commented on how her eyes didn’t shine like they used to.  Ginny could tell something was wrong but never pushed for information. Instead, Ginny kept her company by sitting with her in the Great Hall or in the common room.  Once, the redhead called her brother a brainless, insensitive git and even apologized for him. Hermione smiled weakly and changed the topic. Crookshanks was worried too.  He clung to her like a shadow, constantly showing affection and reminding her to eat. She kept up the facade for their sakes, not wanting to disappoint the few people that cared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ball passed in a blur—the bookworm had brew and taken an elixir to induce euphoria with the help of her small leather book.  She danced the night away in the arms of the Beauxbatons’s Champion; the nervous jitters couldn’t dissuade her from coming out. She was happy; the darkness that plagued her mind couldn’t touch her.  She felt invincible; all the jealous and dirty looks, the whispered insults behind her back and Ron’s puerile behavior couldn’t affect her mood. The night ended with a short but sweet kiss at the bottom of the marble staircase and the long climb up to her common room.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Ron was insufferable before, now he was outright agonizing to be around.  He cornered her the next morning in the common room screaming blasphemy and questioning her loyalty to Harry.  She looked at him with empty eyes. What’s the point of defending herself when she did nothing wrong? It would only agitate him more and she is so sick of this song and dance.  Harry, looking uncomfortable, stood to the side and didn’t intervene. Ginny, being the great friend she was, got into her brother’s face and yelled back. Crookshanks, wanting to defend his witch, stood next to her feet with dilated eyes, arched back, flattened ears, and released a frightening hiss.  She could feel everyone’s eyes on them. Maybe she should thank Ron for making a scene here instead of the Great Hall, she thought bleakly, who knows what the Slytherins would do if they could join in. She backed out the portrait hole without much resistance. Hermione hated the idea of abandoning her allies, but she really wasn’t in the right mindset to do anything else.</p>
<p>Flying did nothing to lighten her mood.  Although, she did consider staying in her animagus form indefinitely; life would be so much simpler as a bird.  When she returned to the Room of Requirement, she found her small leather book opened on the glass coffee table.  Hermione approached it curiously, wondering how the Room was going to help her this time. Staring back at her on yellow pages was a ritual that will allow the caster to apparate to their soulmate’s side wherever they are and whenever they want to.  The idea of having a soulmate intrigued her—a person that was meant for her, that would understand her and that would accept her unconditionally. But at the same time, the concept seemed too good to be true. And if life has taught her anything so far was that for every one good thing that happens, 10 bad things are waiting around the corner.  Still, the Room had not disappointed her yet. Plus, she had nothing better to do until classes resumed.</p>
<p>Performing the ritual was simple enough; she prepared a potion, drew some runes on the floor, did some chanting, nicked her finger to drop some blood into the potion and drank it.  The Gryffindor didn’t know what to expect exactly, but it was a surprise when nothing happened. She was still in the Room of Requirement and she felt absolutely the same as she did 5 minutes ago.  Closing her eyes, she focused on the desire to meet her soulmate. Still nothing. Did the ritual fail? Was the whole thing a hoax? Or maybe she didn’t have a soulmate. She sighed. She knew it was all too good to be true, she thought bitterly.  And if soulmates did exist, she was probably so undesirable the universe didn’t even bother to give her one. The setting around her changed and she found herself back in her small enclave. She plopped onto her recliner with another sigh.  </p>
<p>A second later, she jumped out of the chair and ran out of the room.  How could she be so stupid? Hogwarts was surrounded by anti-apparition wards, she read about this in <em> Hogwarts:  A History. </em>She threw open a nearby window and made sure no one was around.  The next moment, she was soaring towards Hogsmead at full speed.</p>
<p>She landed behind the Shrieking Shack and made her way inside.  The decrepit building looked exactly the same as she last saw it 6 months ago.  She took a deep breath to steady her nerves and closed her eyes. She wanted to meet her soulmate.  She felt a harsh tugging sensation and disappeared with a crack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A bout of nausea overcame Hermione as she emerged at her destination.  Her knees and palms hit damp stone floors as she dry heaved and tried to breathe at the same time.  This was worse than traveling via portkey. Then, an overwhelming cold descended upon her. She froze.  She felt this depressing coldness before—a physical manifestation of the void in her head; it didn’t affect her as much as it did Harry or her schoolmates, but it still sent an unnerving chill down her spine.  She looked around frantically. Stone walls surrounded her, a storm raged outside, relentless waves crashed against rocks, the presence of dementors… There was only one place she could be—Azkaban. She backed up against the iron door, a million questions ran through her mind.</p>
<p>“Well, well, well, look what we have here.”   A high-pitched, honeyed voice spoke from the shadows.  </p>
<p>Wide eyes searched for the owner of the voice.  Hermione opened her mouth but her brain and vocal cords were paralyzed with fear.  </p>
<p>“What’s wrong, dearie?  Cat got your tongue?” Two feral eyes as black as a moonless night traveled up and down her body with a scrutinizing glare.  “Tsk… I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be brave…”  </p>
<p>Brave, she never thought herself to be exceptionally brave—sure she had faced down a three-headed dog, survived an attack from a basilisk, and outsmarted a werewolf, but she knew Harry and Ron had her back then; right now, she was completely and utterly alone.  So no, she was not brave; all she wanted to do was flee and pretend this was just a bad dream.  </p>
<p>“You know, it’s very rude to ignore someone talking to you, Kitten.”  A smirk full of yellow, rotten teeth gleamed in the darkness. “Even if it is a nightmare.”  </p>
<p>“I…”  What? How?</p>
<p>“ANSWER ME!”  The figure lunged with an ugly snarl.  Wild black hair framed a thin gaunt face.  A ragged striped gown covered a skeletal frame.  Twin chains attached to boney wrists were pulled taut, denying the woman the pleasure of tearing into her prey.  </p>
<p>She gasped in terror and in realization.  Her soulmate was a Death Eater and not just any Death Eater, she was Voldemort’s right hand—“Bellatrix Lestrange,” she whispered under her breath.</p>
<p>Dark eyes narrowed, “I’m running out of patience if you know what’s good for you… <em> Soulmate </em> or not.”  The dark witch took a few steps back, allowing the chains to relax, and crossed her arm in front of her chest.</p>
<p>Hermione tilted her head to the side, curiosity momentarily overriding fear.  How is she reading my mind?</p>
<p>“It’s called Legilimency, Kitten, and I’m not so much reading your mind when you are shamelessly shouting them at me,” Bellatrix explained with a face of utter boredom. She wasn’t even looking at the young witch anymore as she picked at her fingernails.  </p>
<p>Legilimency?</p>
<p>Bellatrix let out a long exasperating sigh, “does Hogwarts teach you nothing, girl?  Or am I to believe my <em> soulmate </em> is as sharp as a bag of rocks?”</p>
<p>The young Gryffindor bristled at that comment, “I’ll have you know I’m at the top of my class and considered the brightest witch of my age!” She pronounced proudly with a straight back and raised chin.</p>
<p>Dark chuckles echoed in the small cell.  “She speaks at last! You had me worried for a second—I would have to kill you if you are anything but perfect and being dumb would definitely not be acceptable.”  Bored eyes turned hungry again. “Now, who are you? And more importantly… How did you break into Azkaban?”</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes, trying to rein in her thoughts and not ‘shout’ them.  If being ‘dumb’ was a killable offensive, she’d hate to know what would happen if the dark witch found out about her blood status.  She opened her eyes, regaining her composure. Honesty was the best policy but so was the omission of some ‘minor’ details. “I performed a ritual… and it… it brought me here.”</p>
<p>“What ritual?”  </p>
<p>“I don’t know the name of it.  I found it in a book. It’s supposed to let the caster apparate to their soulmate’s side.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”  Dark eyes narrowed again, “I’ve never heard about such a ritual,” she bared her teeth in an intimidating smile, “if I find out you are lying…”</p>
<p>“I’m not! I swear!”  Hermione interjected quickly.</p>
<p>“In that case,” Bellatrix pouted, “am I ever going to learn my soulmate’s name?”  </p>
<p>Hermione shook her head in shock at the display; if it weren’t for the skeletal, malnourished features, it would have been adorable.  How did she flip between a feral panther and a house cat so effortlessly?</p>
<p>“My name...”</p>
<p>Someone or something released an inhumane screech, drawing both witches’ attention.  Bellatrix cackled madly as the coldness around them intensified. “Tick, tock, lil’ kitten.  Big, bad dementors are comin’...” the dark witch started singing with childish-glee.</p>
<p>Brown eyes dashed towards the barred window.   </p>
<p>“Are you trapped with me in this hellhole of a prison?  Or do you have a way of escapin’?”</p>
<p>Hermione watched the mad witch skip and clap her hands in delight as she changed into a bird.</p>
<p>More people started screaming.  “Hurry, lil’ hawkling. Fly, before they come searchin’.”</p>
<p>And she did.  She squeezed through the bars easily with her smaller form and took flight into the storm.  Bellatrix’s mad cackle continued to ring in her ears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione managed to fly back to the mainland and took the Knight Bus back to Hogsmead.  Ginny ambushed her as soon as she stepped through the portrait hole demanding where she’s been for the past 4 days.  Four days, has it really been that long? It only felt like 2 since she walked out the day after Christmas. She smiled apologetically at her worried friend.  Ginny didn’t let the brunette out of her sight until classes started again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The young Griffindor was not happy about being tricked into becoming bait for Fleur during the second task, but her irritation evaporated when Harry tied for first-place due to his great moral fibre.  She celebrated with her housemates. Ginny stayed by her side the entire night. Harry mumbled something like an apology for not stepping in when Ron was obviously out of line. She forgave Harry but avoided Ron like the plague.</p>
<p>During her free time when she is not accompanied by Ginny, which was few and far between since her disappearing act, she dug up all she could about Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black.  The bookworm had already done some preliminary research on Azkaban and its inmates after freeing Sirius last summer. Now, she wanted to know everything she could about her soulmate.  Pure-blood directories, newspaper clippings, gossip magazines, school records, she left no stone unturned. She set up a bulletin board in the Room of Requirement that displayed her findings.  Much to Hermione’s dismay, she couldn’t find much about her childhood. School records told her of a troubled child, bright beyond her age but prone to anger and tended to solve problems with her fist as much as her wand.  A wedding announcement between Bellatrix Black and Rodolphus Lestrange was released in the paper before her graduation in 1970. Everything after that was Death Eater related. Hermione cried when she found out about Neville’s parents.  How was this pure-blood fanatic, this lunatic that has tortured and murdered her other half? She leaned back in her recliner and scowled at the room. This was definitely NOT what she needed. The room ignored her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As it turned out, having a Death Eater as a soulmate was only a part of her worries.  On the night of the third trial, Harry and Cedric entered the maze together, but only Harry came back out alive.  Voldemort was back.  </p>
<p>During the confusion, Hermione slipped away from the stands.  She had a sudden pressing urge to see her soulmate—Bellatrix was extremely distressed; she didn’t know how she knew that, but she did.</p>
<p>Azkaban was ringing with insane shouts and laughter when she arrived.  A couple of voices were chanting “He’s back” over and over again at the top of their lungs.  Hermione found Bellatrix curled in a fetal position cradling her left arm. For someone who claimed to be Voldemort’s most loyal follower, she wasn’t exactly jumping with joy like the others.  “Bellatrix?”  </p>
<p>The dark witch stirred slightly but didn’t respond.  </p>
<p>She took a tentative step forward.  “Bellatrix, are you alright?”</p>
<p>Bellatrix shook her head with vigor like an upset child. </p>
<p>“What wrong?”</p>
<p>“He’s back,” she whispered, her voice trembled with… fear?</p>
<p>“Who’s back?”  Hermione moved closer, she didn’t like seeing the dark witch so broken and in distraught.</p>
<p>The young Gryffindor jumped back slightly when Bellatrix shoved her left arm towards her with an angry hiss, “Him!”  A black tattoo of a skull and a snake slithering out of its mouth glistened on pale white skin. Dark feral eyes glared at the Mark with hatred.  “He’s back!”</p>
<p>“I thought you would be happy with him being back...”</p>
<p>“Happy?!”  Bellatrix jumped up and towered over the other witch, “I was happy when Andy and her daughter were safe!  I was happy when Cissy and her son were out of harm’s way!” She picked up something and threw it at the wall away from Hermione.  </p>
<p>Hermione flinched as the thing shattered.  </p>
<p>Bellatrix then visibly deflated and sank back down to the floor, “what if I’m not able to keep them safe this time?”  </p>
<p>The young witch didn’t know what to say or do.  All of her research did not prepare her for this.  What happened to the larger than life Death Eater that killed and tortured without hesitation?  The witch before her looked nothing like the most wanted posters or the mugshots that lined her bulletin board.  Who was this broken soul that put her sisters’ family before herself?</p>
<p>Hermione sat down next to her soulmate and offered a hand.  After a few long awkward minutes, a bony hand slipped into hers.  The young Gryffindor laced their fingers together and gave a comforting squeeze.  There was more to the story of Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black, that much was obvious.  Maybe... she wasn’t that... bad. Maybe... they could work something out. Maybe...</p>
<p>“Thank you, hawkling.”</p>
<p>Hermione almost didn’t catch the soft whisper.  She smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome, Bella.”</p>
