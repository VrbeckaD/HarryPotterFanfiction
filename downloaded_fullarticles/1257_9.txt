    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, nor any characters, plot, setting, or other things associated with it. That all belongs to J.K. Rowling, and I could never hope to compete with her work.</p><p>A/N: <em><strong>Important timeline note!</strong></em> I have shifted some dates around because of a few errors I made initially and while the story is supposed to be 8th year after the Battle of Hogwarts, it's currently set in the 2019-2020 academic year so that's why there's tech in this story.</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione's POV</p><p>It's just one more week before I go back to Hogwarts one final time for my 8th and last year of school. It seems so weird; that after all the pain the war gave us, we're still going back to school and carrying on with our lives. I feel sad remembering that my parents will never see me graduate. Just another thing that the war has stolen from me.</p><p>It'll be so strange going back by myself. Ron and Harry were able to get fast-tracked into becoming Aurors because of how much they did during the war, but I still feel like going back for one more year of school would have done them good. Especially for Ron, as his grades weren't exactly the best in our sixth year.</p><p>As I sit on my bedroom floor, I finally stop procrastinating and pull out my letter from Headmistress McGonagall. I will never get used to saying that. As I read it for the sixth time today, I wonder if life could possibly get any worse. I may have gotten the prestigious honour of becoming Head Girl, but Malfoy is Head Boy. Honestly, this is a disaster waiting to happen. Malfoy and I will be at each other's throats all year. I wonder why he's coming back for school. With a feeling of shock, I realize just how alone I will be this year. All the students coming back are in a separate class from the seventh years to keep numbers at a reasonable level. Even if we weren't separated Head's have their own dorms, which would mean no Harry, Ron, or Ginny. I won't have anyone to talk to at all, and I'll essentially be isolated.</p><p>I break down at the thought and let myself cry. I slowly try to calm down and realize this has been my third breakdown this week and it was only a Wednesday. Ever since the war, my emotions have been all over the place. Wiping the tears from my face, I go back to reading my letter for the 4th time. My classes for this year are Arithmancy, Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Study of Ancient Runes, Charms, Transfiguration, Alchemy, and Ancient Studies (focuses on really old magic like old Egyptian spells). Though I never told Ron or Harry this, I've always wanted to be an Auror or work in the Department of Mysteries. They would have laughed at me but I think that any other job would leave me seriously bored, especially after all of our adventures. The only thing that might hinder me is a fear heights.</p><p>I turn the timetable over to see the list of school supplies and textbooks needed for this year. I already have most of the supplies, with the exception of new quills and parchment. I never had the opportunity to replenish my supply last year and I haven't really left my house since I returned after the Battle of Hogwarts. The books we need are all pretty standard and I shouldn't have too much trouble getting them. I'll have to go to Diagon Alley to get my supplies, but that can wait till Friday.</p><p>For now I start packing my clothes and supply of wizarding money. I pack a couple of sets of casual clothes for evenings and Hogsmeade trips; two sets of pajamas, one for winter and one for summer; and about 7 sets of uniforms. I quickly grab my small pouch of galleons and stow it under my pajamas, then put a special lock charm on the suitcase as an extra measure of caution.</p><p>Going downstairs, I walk towards the kitchen to fix myself some lunch. As I reach the fridge to pull out the ingredients for pasta, the doorbell rings. Strange, no one's come by since I first came back home, not even the neighbors. I quickly run over to the door and open it to reveal Harry, Ron, and Ginny.</p><p>"Hey Hermione, mind if we come in?" says Harry with a small smile on his face.</p><p>I'm too shocked to really answer and just move out of the way to let them in.</p><p>"Uh… what are you guys doing here?" I ask.</p><p>"Well, it's been two weeks since we heard from you, so we decided to pay you a visit. Then we found out that you hadn't left the house since the beginning of summer!" says Ginny exasperatedly. "We also wanted to see how one of our best friends was doing especially since you stopped replying to our letters two weeks ago!</p><p>That's right, the letters just started piling up around the same time that I got my Hogwarts letter came. Too many memories and flashbacks from the war had been brought to the forefront of my mind whenever I saw their letters, especially their questions. After a while, I couldn't really bring myself to reply to them anymore.</p><p>"Hello… Hermione, are you there?" asks Ron</p><p>With a start I realize I've spaced out again.</p><p>"Oh sorry Ron, I just got lost in my thoughts. So, how are you guys? What have you done in the two weeks since I last responded to your letters?" I can tell Ginny wants to know what I've been doing and why I stopped replying, but she can tell I want to shift the conversation and starts talking about their week to get it over with.</p><p>"Well I got my Hogwarts letter," says Ginny, "congrats on getting the Head Girl position by the way. Ron and Harry both finished Auror training, and Bill and Fleur had their baby shower. It's going to be a girl!" Ginny squeals as she says this last part. "So what have you done the past two weeks? And what do you think about the new Head Boy?" She wiggles her eyebrows when she says this, but based on their expressions I can tell she hasn't told either Ron or Harry who the Head Boy is this year.</p><p>"Yeah Hermione, who is this 'elusive' Head Boy Ginny keeps teasing us about? The suspense is killing me, just tell me who it is and put us out of our misery." Ron confirms my suspicion that they don't know who it is, and I feel kind of apprehensive about telling them.</p><p>"Alright, I will answer your questions on one condition, you are not allowed to make a big deal about it or hex anyone. Got it?" I see Harry raise his eyebrows at the last statement, but he agrees and so does Ron. Ginny just waits expectantly, with a slightly mischievous expression on her face.</p><p>"Alright, to answer your question the Head Boy is the one and only Draco 'Ferret' Malfoy. And don't worry, I'll find a way to deal with him. Before you try to interrupt me, these past few weeks have been spent reading, listening to music, crying at random times, reading my Hogwarts letter, and memorizing my timetable." I look at both Harry and Ron to gauge their reactions. Harry looks gobsmacked and Ron looks ready to puke. Judging by their facial expressions, I can tell they are only thinking about Malfoy and haven't actually listened to the last part. With a glance at Ginny, I see her look sympathetically at me.</p><p>"Wow 'Mione," starts Harry, "guess we've missed a lot of information these two weeks. And Malfoy, is he really coming back for school? It just doesn't seem like him at all." Well at least he has responded pretty well to the news. Not quite what I was expecting since he and Malfoy were the biggest pair of enemies in the whole school. I guess now it's down to Ron.</p><p>"Unfortunately, he is. I sent a letter to McGonagall to confirm if he is, and she responded with a yes." I reply.</p><p>"I don't know what to say, you and Malfoy have to share a dorm and common room? That'll end well." Ron says in a sarcastic voice. Phew, I was dreading an outburst from Ron, but I guess he's matured over summer.</p><p>"I was wondering if you guys would mind coming with me on Friday to Diagon Alley. I need to get supplies for school and I don't really want to go by myself." I'm actually glad they came today. Going to Diagon Alley has never been too appealing to me since its always crowded, now I can ask for some company without it seeming too needy.</p><p>"Yeah sure Hermione, I can get my stuff as well then as supposed to doing next week. And next time, don't be afraid to ask us to accompany you. You're one of our best friends, we'd love to spend time with you." Says Ginny. Yay, one down and two to go.</p><p>"Ron and I would be happy to come seeing as how we haven't seen you all summer" Replies Harry. This is great, I won't be by myself and I'll get to catch up with them.</p><p>"Well then, since that's settled, how about I fix you guys some lunch while you're still here. Is pasta okay with you guys?" I made sure I knew how to cook since I found out about the house elves in our Second Year, and the skill has come in quite handy for many situations.</p><p>"That'd be great Hermione! We'd love to stay for awhile." says Ginny.</p><p>It's nice seeing my friends. It was way too lonely this summer, but I couldn't bring myself to leave my house. With a feeling of contentment and a big smile on my face, I go to prep lunch.</p>
<hr/><p>Author's Note: I know this chapter was a bit of fluff, but it will be a bit of a slow burner so bear with me. We will see Draco's POV in the story. Feel free to send me feedback as it is always good to hear from readers. Thanks, Kathryn D.</p><p> </p>
