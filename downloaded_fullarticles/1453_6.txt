    <p>The letter was on aged parchment, the same as every Hogwarts letter he had ever received. Green ink, spiky letters, the Y in his name looping around on itself. There was nothing different about this letter. So why was he so surprised to be holding it? Harry shook his head, a little bewildered by the paper in his hand. A formal invitation to return to Hogwarts for an eighth year, to finish up the schooling Voldemort had taken from him. He sat down heavily on his bed, wondering what to do. The question was very nearly answered for him when a tall redhead burst into the room they shared.</p><p>“You got one too mate? We’re going back, yeah?” Ron’s tall form stood in the doorway, his blue eyes wide and a smile on his lips. “Hermione will be so pleased, she’s been hoping that we’d get a chance to go back, she’s so school obsessed. I wouldn't be surprised if she flooed over here later to talk about it. At the very least, she’ll write to us telling us we have no choice but to go back. You know how she is.”</p><p>In a puff of dust that caught in the golden sunlight, Ron fell onto his own bed, holding the letter high above his head. Harry just stared at him, eyes narrowed behind his glasses. Ron was going back, no question. He would do anything Hermione told him to, he was so stupidly in love with the girl. They had only been official for a few months, but their love for each other had run so deep and for so long that it was like they had been together for their whole lives.</p><p>Ron looked over at Harry, brow furrowed. “You are going to go back, right Harry?”</p><p>“I don't know mate, I’ll have to think it over.” Hogwarts had been the place of so many sorrows for Harry, and he knew it had been for Ron too. But the thought of stepping back in the stone halls of the place that had turned from home to tomb was a thought Harry wasn't quite ready to accept. “I’m gonna go for a walk, I’ll be back for supper. Tell your mum to not wait up for me.”</p><p>Ron nodded at him, eyes full of concern as Harry stood up and left the room. He slipped down the narrow halls and stairways of the Burrow, careful to avoid the closed door of Fred and George’s room, a door which rarely opened these days. He paused at Ginny’s door, tempted to open it, to talk to her, but he couldn't. This moment was one he needed for himself. Exiting the house without detection from Molly was no small feat, but he managed to get away without any questions. He wandered through the fields and trees surrounding the house before finding himself at his favourite place: the lake.</p><p>Seating himself along the shore, he pulled the letter from within his jeans pocket, where he had stuffed it before leaving the house. It was crumpled now, but a muttered spell and a flick of his wand had it smoothing out again. McGonagall’s familiar writing looked up at him, and each word felt like an accusation. He didn't deserve Hogwarts and the people within it. He didn't deserve to walk the halls where so many good people had died, good people that he could have saved, if only he had tried harder. He didn't want to go back and see the eyes of people who looked at him as the saviour, when really he was the one who had doomed them all to begin with.</p><p>He was about to crumple the letter in his fist when a familiar flowery scent washed over him and Ginny settled onto the ground next to him. Her head soon became a soft weight on his shoulder, one that was not unwelcome but felt strange nonetheless. Their relationship was unsure, nothing confirmed or denied. His mind wasn't in the place for a relationship, but he enjoyed spending his time with her when they could sneak away from Molly’s watching eyes.</p><p>“Are you going to come back in September?” Her voice was soft, as familiar as Ron’s. “I know Ron is, and I’ll be going. If you don't come, you’ll be left here with mum, dad, and George. I know you would never have a problem with that, but being alone with them seems like a lot of sadness in one house.” Her voice lilted up in a sort of half laugh, and Harry grinned a little despite himself.</p><p>“Are they going to be okay by themselves?” He asked, curious about how the three would do when left alone with their grief and no one else.</p><p>Ginny thought for a moment, “Yeah, I think Bill and Fleur are going to move back for a few months, just to make sure everything is going smoothly without us. They’re leery about leaving them alone too. Without Freddie, George isn’t doing well, hell none of us are, but George most of all. Mum doesn’t know what to do. I almost think having all of use out of the house might help. She could devote her time to George instead of all of us.”</p><p>Harry nodded, his head heavy. He felt guilty for everything this wonderful family had endured for him, and he realized with a small pang of pain that him leaving the house would mean he wasn't a burden. Turning to look at Ginny, he smiled softly. “I guess I’ll come back then. I’ll tag along with everyone to King’s Cross, get myself back into the swing of normal life.” His smile was little more than a ghost when Ginny threw her arms around him, and he was glad she couldn't see it fade.</p><p>And as she kissed him and they fell back into the long grass, he was glad that she could not see into his head, which was repeating the words <em> I don't deserve this </em> over and over and over.</p>
