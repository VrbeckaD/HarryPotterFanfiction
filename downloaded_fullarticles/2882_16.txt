    <p>“Mister Scamandar.”, Grindelwald's voice caught the attention of the two brothers, looking at the dark wizard as he spoke. Neither of them knew who was addressed just yet. Theseus mind flying through everything that had happened, the many aurors already killed by the blue fire. While Newt's mind was stuck on Credence joining Grindelwald -who had abused him, hurt him, manipulated him- and Queenie joining him.<br/>
“Do you think Dumbeldore will mourn for you?”.</p><p>The voice was suddenly from behind them, Grindelwald had apparated behind them, and they turned around swiftly. Newt's eyes widened in shock when Grindelwald grasped his arm, and he was forced to apparate.</p><p>
  <b>OO</b>
</p><p>Newt woke up again laying on something soft. A bed? He didn't remember falling asleep, nor having gotten to bed. Thinking about it, he didn't remember much of what had happened. He sat up, still feeling groggy, tired. Looking around, he recognized the bedroom wasn't his own. This room was big, the ceiling high. Wooden furniture with intricate designs, plush carpets and heavy curtains. The bed was incredibly soft, the blankets and pillows smooth, but warm from when he had slept.</p><p>He remembered his case, and his creatures. Feeling more panicked, he looked around, unable to see it anywhere. He got up, uncaring where he was, feeling more concerned for his creatures. If they weren't in this room, he needed to search for them! But before he even got to the door, it opened, and in stepped.. someone? Newt stood just next to the bed, staring at the other man that had entered.<br/>
Pale skin, blond, almost white, hair, and mismatched eyes. White and black, as it looked like. Something inside of Newt screamed at him that this man was evil, that he needed to get away. He grabbed for his wand, but felt it wasn't at his side. It must be with his case, hopefully.</p><p>“Who- who are you?”, Newt asked, averting his gaze. He felt uncomfortable in the presence of the other man, presumably a wizard. The stare of those mismatched eyes made him feel nervous.<br/>
“My, it appears you can't remember me, dear.”, Grindelwald spoke, walking up to Newt. The magizoologist fidgeted, hands nervously wringing together.<br/>
“I- no. Where- where are my creatures?”, Newt looked up to Grindelwald, feeling a little helpless. He needed to find his creatures, make sure they are alright, look after them, care for them.<br/>
“Your case is safe with me, dear Newton. You trust me, don't you?”, Grindelwald's voice was like a purr, and it send shivers down Newt's spine. He felt like he shouldn't trust him, that this person -who hadn't told him their name- was evil.<br/>
“I- please- I just need to take care of them.”, Newt looked back up to Grindelwald, feeling almost helpless. He just wanted to see his creatures, why couldn't he do that? Why did this person insist?</p><p>“Don't worry darling. I'll take you to your creatures.”, Grindelwald murmured, his hand laying onto Newt's chin. The smaller male couldn't react before lips were against his. He was frozen, not knowing what to do, thoughts in his head screaming that this was <em>wrong,</em> he needed to get away. But before he could move back, or anything else, Grindelwald had stepped back again, smirking slightly. He grabbed Newt's hand, and pulled him along.<br/>
“Come now, Newton. I'm sure you're creatures are waiting for you.”, he said, and let go of Newt's hand once he started following Grindelwald.</p><p>Newt looked around as they walked, taking in the grand and expensive looking furniture and decorations. It felt alien to him, like he didn't belong, and it made him feel wrong. It made him crave something else, something that felt like home. He didn't remember what home was, though.<br/>
They reached something that looked like a study, or an office, and there on the desktop, sat Newt's case. He immediately rushed to it, relief rushing through him as he saw it, and was able to pull it close against his chest.<br/>
“Now, Newton. I'll allow you into your case, as long as you return in the next two hours.”, Grindelwald spoke, making Newt look back to him. Why did he only get two hours? It should be enough to take care of his creatures, make sure they all were alright, but still...</p><p>“Hurry, time is running.”, Grindelwald smirked as he saw Newt's panicked face, and the man quickly set his case down, opening it and quickly climbing down into it, closing the lid behind himself. He had no clue why he only had two hours, but he wasn't going to waste them!<br/>
He was very happy to see his creatures, who seemed... strange. They seemed concerned for him almost, and he wasn't sure why. He took his friend's clinginess as him having forgotten to take care of them with all what was going on.<br/>
All that was going on? <em>What was going on?</em> Newt frowned to himself, grabbing buckets and crates with food and bringing them to all of his different creatures, petting them and talking with them, as he pondered over what had happened. Where he was.</p><p>After having fed all his creatures, he settled down at his shack, looking over the pictures he had put there. He saw Leta, remembering her with a small, fond smile. But then he saw another woman, and another picture with a woman and a man. And a third picture of someone looking similar to him. His gaze focused on these people, and he thought hard about who they were. They.. they seemed important to him. But why couldn't he remember? Neither them, nor what had happened in... the last days? Weeks?</p><p><em>My brother must be worried sick about me...</em> Newt thought, before realizing what he had just thought about. Brother? <em>His brother! Theseus!</em> The memories came slamming back, making him stumble a step backwards.<br/>
The fight against Grindelwald. Queenie leaving with him, leaving Jacob behind. Credence joining Grindelwald's side. His brother, the other aurors. How he had been forced to apparate somewhere, and then- then someone had used <em>obliviate</em> on him. That was why he couldn't remember! Just because something had triggered his memories did he remember, probably because the person casting the spell hadn't been very strong, or knowing what to erase.</p><p>Newt paled as he realized with whom he was. Just who was waiting outside of his case. <em>Who had kissed him</em>. He shuddered, curling up inside of his shack. He only had two hours. How much time had passed? Surely an hour had gone by already. Maybe more. He couldn't go back out there, though! He didn't have his wand, he wasn't very skilled at wandless magic. He was helpless, and he didn't know what to do. Maybe- maybe he could apparate out of here? He just had to grab his case, and be quick enough before Grindelwald knew what was happening. He doubted he'd be able to do it though, but he had to try.</p><p><a name="docs-internal-guid-4f4b8f4d-7fff-affc-bf7f-f3b6ed1dfa64" rel="nofollow" id="docs-internal-guid-4f4b8f4d-7fff-affc-bf7f-f3b6ed1dfa64"></a> So, making sure neither Pickett nor his niffler were hiding in his coat, Newt climbed back out of his case. Better be early than too late, and receive... what, exactly? A punishment? What would Grindelwald have done?<br/>
“Ah, Newton. There you are.”, Grindelwald watched Newt climb out of the case, closing it and picking it up after him. He seemed nervous, and when he glanced at Grindelwald, even afraid. There was no doubt in Grindelwald's mind that Newt had triggered his memories in the case. He had expected it already, and had set up wards to make apparating impossible.<br/>
“What- what do you want from- m-me?”, Newt asked instead then, licking his dry lips. Feeling disgusting that Grindelwald had kissed him. He looked up at him, startled, when the dark wizard came towards him, smirking? He knew, he must know, maybe he had cast Legilimens? Newt wasn't skilled at Occlumency in the slightest. He had never had a need for it.</p><p>“Now now Newton, you don't intend on telling me you remember who you are with now, hm?”, Grindelwald said, watching Newt with cold eyes, and an almost neutral expression. The magizoologist shrunk into himself, visibly afraid, uncomfortable. He clearly remembered, and Grindelwald didn't want that. Oh no, he needed Newt not for anything that he could think of. Newt was, in itself rather useless. Sure he possessed quite a bit of knowledge of beasts and how to treat them. But he had also written all of that down, in a handy little notebook that was already in Grindelwald's possession. And the book he had written as well.</p><p>“I- I won't stand for what you do.”, Newt said, looking up to Grindelwald with defiance. Of course he would, with what Grindelwald all had done already.<br/>
“And what do you intend on doing against me?”, Grindelwald asked, smirking. He knew Newt could do nothing against him. He wasn't as strong as his brother, or anything close to any of the other friends Newt had. Not that said friends were of any use to him now anymore either.<br/>
“I'll- I'll do whatever I can.”, Newt steeled his nerves, knowing he couldn't actually do any damage. He was at Grindelwald's mercy, and he was very well aware of that. But, what did Grindelwald even do with him? He wasn't strong, all he had was... all he had were his creatures. He paled, thinking about how Grindelwald might want to use them for his war.<br/>
“You are well aware of the fact you can't do anything against me.”, Grindelwald spoke, stepping closer to Newt, making him walk backwards, until his back hit the shelves behind him. He clutched the case in his hand, looking anywhere but to Grindelwald.<br/>
“I will do whatever I please with you. You're not very useful for anything after all, are you?”. Grindelwald grabbed Newt's chin, forcing him to look up at him. Newt looked scared, not knowing what Grindelwald meant. He didn't want to do anything against his will! But he was powerless, standing in front of the most powerful wizard of this time. It terrified him, how with one spell, Grindelwald could easily end his life.</p><p>“P-please..”, Newt whimpered, looking at Grindelwald. “Just- just d-don't- don't hurt my c-creatures..”. As long as he could protect them, he'd be fine. He'd do anything for them. Even if it meant that he would... he would be used.<br/>
Grindelwald hummed, looking at Newt as he thought for mere seconds. “You don't even know to what extent I'm capable of hurting them.”, he said, holding Newt's chin tighter in his grasp. “You don't know anything about how powerful I really are.”.</p><p>He kissed Newt again, forcefully. Teeth biting Newt's lips, pulling on them and making sure he drew blood, forcing his way into the other's mouth. Newt was whimpering, trying to get away, but Grindelwald's body was pressed against his own, and the grip on his chin kept his head in place. He had to endure the kiss, no matter how disgusting it made him feel.<br/>
“I will break you.”, Grindelwald muttered against Newt's lips, making him gulp. He was scared, terrified. He hoped beyond hope that his brother, that his friends, that <em>anyone</em> would safe him. “You'll be my little obedient toy. And <em>nothing</em> more.”.</p><p>Grindelwald stepped back from Newt, the magizoologist frozen in place. He could only stare wide-eyed at Grindelwald, as he pulled out his wand and pointed it at him.<br/>
“Diffindo.”, the man spoke, effectively cutting all of Newt's clothes, and he scrambled to try and hold the cut pieces against himself, cheeks flaring red when Grindelwald used his magic to pull them all off of him.<br/>
Grindelwald took in the form of Newt's body, the long pale limbs, covered in faint freckles everywhere. Little to no body hair able to be found, making the man almost look feminine. Grindelwald smirked.<br/>
“Get on your knees.”, he commanded, watching Newton. When the man didn't move, he growled. “Move, or I will <em>make you</em>.”.</p><p>With satisfaction, he watched Newt get on his knees, trying to hide himself behind his hands, gaze on the ground. Grindelwald stepped closer to Newt again, until he was in front of him. He used his wand to raise Newt's chin, making the embarrassed wizard look up at him, even if the almost grey looking eyes didn't look at Grindelwald.<br/>
“Move your hands. I'm sure you can figure out what to do.”, Grindelwald said, gripping Newt's hair tightly with his free hand, pressing his face into his crotch. Newt whimpered, looking up at Grindelwald. He didn't want this, he was scared, and the thought of having to... to <em>pleasure Grindelwald</em> sickened him.</p><p>“If you don't, I'll teach you the pain your creatures will be in, if you continue to disobey.”, Grindelwald threatened. It seemed to do the trick, as Newt raised his shaking hands to fumble with Grindelwald's pants. He was pale, trembling, feeling so helpless. But he had to protect his creatures, had to protect what and whoever he could. So he pulled open Grindelwald's pants, swallowing the lump in his throat when he saw the bulge of Grindelwald's dick. He was big, even if not really aroused, and it made Newt more scared and uncomfortable. A sharp painful tug to his hair made him hurry up to pull down Grindelwald's undergarments, freeing his cock. With blazing red cheeks, Newt began licking at it, keeping his hands on Grindelwald's thighs. He felt disgusting, but what else could he do? So he licked at the length, ignoring how gross it tasted, how terrible it made him feel. Taking the head into his mouth, sucking on it, swirling his tongue around the head and through the slit, pulling off again to continue licking and sucking on the sides of Grindelwald's cock.</p><p>The dark wizard didn't make any sounds of pleasure, but he also didn't hurt Newt further, so he hoped he did well enough. Taking Grindelwald's cock back into his mouth, sucking on the pale but warm flesh, starting to bob his head slowly. He took more of him into his mouth, sucking and moving his tongue, feeling the dick in his mouth begin to harden and grow. He just kept going, trying to take all he could into his mouth, which was barely halfway before he felt like gagging. Quickly pulling back, breathing heavily, before he continued bobbing his head, sucking noisily.<br/>
Grindelwald seemed to get impatient with him though, the grip on his hair tightening and holding him in place, as he began thrusting into Newt's mouth. Forcing his cock further down Newt's throat, making the man gag and choke around Grindelwald. Which he just seemed to <em>enjoy</em>. Fucking Newt's throat, gripping and pulling at his hair, sending pain over Newt's scalp.</p><p>“This is all your mouth is useful for, understood?”, Grindelwald growled. “Just a warm hole for me to fuck. Nothing sensible ever comes out of your mouth, you're useless as a wizard as well.”.<br/>
The words hurt to hear, and made Newt whimper around the cock in his mouth. Saliva was starting to run down his chin, but he didn't move his hands to wipe it away, feeling scared to do anything that might anger Grindelwald into hurting his creatures.<br/>
Grindelwald forced his cock down Newt's throat until his nose was pressed into Grindelwald's pubic hair. He was forced to swallow him down, gragging and choking, his throat constricting and spasming around the dick in his throat. Tears gathered in Newt's eyes, his lungs were screaming for air.<br/>
Until finally, finally Grindelwald came, forcing Newt to swallow his cum, before pulling out, so the last of his seed landed on Newt's face. Newt could care less right now, as he gasped and struggled to take deep enough breaths to get air back into his lungs, while also swallowing what cum was still in his throat.</p><p>“You're not going to see your creatures again until tomorrow.”, Grindelwald spoke, pulling his clothes back on properly and snatching the case from the ground, using some spells to make it unable to be opened. “As lesson for not obeying immediately.”.<br/>
“P-plea-se-”, Newt's voice cracked, words broken up as he struggled to breath, tears running down his cheeks. “D-don-'t- don't hu-rt th-them-”.<br/>
Grindelwald didn't seem to care much, and instead swiftly left, putting locking charms onto the door, which would be unable for Newt to open it. Not that the magizoologist currently cared, kneeling on the ground, crying and gasping for breath.</p><p>After a few minutes, Newt weakly got onto his feet, and stumbled back to the bed. His clothes were torn to shreds, useless, and there was nothing he could do. There was nothing in this room he could use, he didn't have his wand, and no spells he knew wandless would help him at this moment.<br/>
So he curled up in bed, trembling as he buried himself in the blankets, sobbing into the pillows. He didn't know what Grindelwald was going to achieve with this, with hurting him. All he could hope for currently, was that his creatures would be safe, and that maybe, hopefully, someone would come safe him.</p><p> </p>
