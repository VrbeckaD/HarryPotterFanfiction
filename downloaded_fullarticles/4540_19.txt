    <p>“Oh, <i>wow!</i>”</p><p>Harry resisted the urge to squirm at the sudden, awed exclamation. The magical world was <i>amazing</i> but he <i>really</i> could have done without the fame.</p><p>“Hi-….?” He trailed off the greeting when he turned to find a boy - red haired with so many freckles it was almost a tan instead - ignoring him entirely.</p><p>“Hey…” The boy said absent-mindedly, his entire focus on Hedwig.</p><p>Harry, puzzled but not about to argue over the situation (what would he even <i>say</i>? <i>Why are you looking at my owl as if <b>she</b> were the famous one?</i>), watched the boy watch Hedwig preen. Eventually, she seemed to have enough of being the center of attention and tucked her head beneath a wing.</p><p>“She’s <i>beautiful</i>.” The boy said, finally looking at Harry. “She looks young, fully mature mind - I think that you’re her first wizard. That’s not a bad thing! You don’t have to worry about her not delivering your letters! You being her first wizard is a good thing, really!” </p><p>The boy smiled as if to reassure him. It was a bit crooked and not all the teeth were straight - one even looked sharp enough that Harry wondered about the existence of vampires - but it was a nice smile all the same.</p><p>Then the boy was barreling onwards, “Owls are loyal and have a very strong sense of duty, it’s why they’re the main means of communication for the Wizarding World, but they’re very particular to their first owner. And yours is a female, one who never had any chicks before and you yourself are still young - which she <i>knows</i> - so she’ll be doubly loyal to you and likely protective on top of <i>that</i>.”</p><p>The boy paused and, just when Harry was about to ask his name, said, “What’s her name?”</p><p>“Hedwig.” Harry answered in the expectant silence that followed, asking, “Do you like owls?”</p><p>“Sure,” the boy said agreeably. “They may not be my <i>favorite</i> but they’re kind of amazing, you know?” He paused as if a thought hit him. “Sorry, who are you?”</p><p>Harry hesitated but eventually said, “Harry….Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Huh.” The boy said instead of commenting, “I’m Charlie, Charlie Weasley - it’s nice to meet you and Hedwig, Harry.”</p>
