    <p align="left">Remus opened a window, taking out the cigarette package that always lingered in his back pocket. While he took one out he could hear his phone go off on the table behind him. He turned around and picked the device up. The screen showed the word 'mother' so without further hesitation he answered the call. </p><p align="left">"Yes, mom?"</p><p align="left">"Hey sweety, have you seen my pills? I thought I left them in the cabinet above the fridge but I can't seem to find them."</p><p align="left">"I have no idea mom, you probably moved them somewhere else and forgot about it." He held a bottle of sleeping pills in his hand.<em> "</em>Isn't it a bit too late to take them anyway?" </p><p align="left">There was a short silence on the other side. "Well I went out with an old friend of mine and it became a bit late. I'll try to do it with just tea then. Goodnight honey."</p><p align="left">"Yeah goodnight mom, don't worry you'll be fine." </p><p align="left">He could hear the familiar sound of an ended conversation. Remus loved his mother he really did, she supported him through everything even when he got his first tattoo. Now his arms were covered with them. He remembered how she was always worried about the posters hanging inside of his bedroom, they portrayed tortured people or sometimes they just had the face of a serial killer. So that, and the fact that he had an addiction to horror movies was an understandable reason for her to be worried. Though, she didn't have to be, not at that time in his life. Remus was just a young teen back then wanting to show off how creepy he was to others, such an edgy kid. It didn't come as a surprise that he wanted all kinds of torture devices tattooed on his body, having around 10 right now. Filled up with some latin which made him look like some kind of devil worshipper. The horror movies, the serial killers had been just a phase but the interest in torture stayed. Always wanting to learn more about it, it was a topic that came up in his head more than once a day.</p><p align="left">Remus leaned out of the window, slowly smoking up his cigarette. His cousin Lily was coming over tomorrow morning but he wasn't sure yet if he should be happy about that or annoyed. Honestly, he loved the cheerful young lady but there were times he would love to just shove a ball gag into her mouth so she'd finally shut up. The image of that made him laugh, throwing away what was left of his cigarette as he closed the window. Standing in front of it for a moment, watching his reflection in the glass.</p><p align="left">He walked to the kitchen as he picked up the bottle of sleeping pills on his way over. Taking a glass of water and opening the bottle. Looking into it while he took a deep breath. Knowing that he probably shouldn't do it, he took 3 pills out of it. He wasn't suicidal or anything just a little self-destructive he loved waking up with a pain in his chest from taking a bit too many pills. Putting the pills on his tongue and the glass to his lips as he swallowed them down. Oh, how he loved the feeling of the capsules going down his throat. Remus laughed for a second, not a genuine laugh, no a pathetic one, before he headed over to the couch and falling asleep on it.</p><p align="left">--</p><p align="left">Remus woke up by the sound of someone knocking loudly on his door. Moaning when he remembered his appointment with Lily, so with a lot of effort he stood up and opened the door.</p><p align="left">"You fucking moron! I've been knocking for over half an hour now! I've even called your phone! Twice!" She sounded offended.</p><p align="left">"I'm sorry. I was in a deep sleep."</p><p align="left">Lily was already looking around the room and she found what she was looking for. Running over to the bottle that was still on the kitchen counter and taking it in her hand.</p><p align="left">"I thought you stopped this? Didn't you learn anything from the last time you took too much of these and they had to empty your stomach?"</p><p align="left"><em>"I </em>didn<em>..."</em></p><p align="left">"How many did you take? And don't lie to me!" Remus could hear the disappointment in her voice which made him feel helpless for a moment.</p><p align="left">"I.. I took three of them."</p><p align="left">Lily punched him on the chest making an angry sound but when he looked down he could see that she did her best to hold back tears. She was a strong woman who wouldn't let any man ruin her but when it came to someone she loved she easily broke down. </p><p align="left">"Hey Lil, it's fine. I just wanted to fall asleep without having to think too much."</p><p align="left">"So you take three fucking pills? Remus! If you need to talk then call me but don't go doing these kinds of things!" By now she was shouting so loud he was sure his neighbors could hear it. Not that he minded that though, he hated everyone in his building.</p><p align="left">"Alright I won't do it again is that what you want to hear?" Remus took her hands in his and kissed them softly. </p><p align="left">"No, I want to see you not doing it again. Words don't mean anything in your world!" She pulled her hands away and sighed. "Are these your mother's?" Examining the bottle she noticed that it was indeed from Remus mother. "You know she really needs these right?" She scoffed, nodding her head in a disapproving way. "She probably hasn't slept tonight because of you."</p><p align="left">Remus knew that she was right about that but right now he wasn't in the right state to care about that. "I'm going to take a shower and then we'll go to the gallery you wanted to see." He walked over to his bathroom and closed the door. Going over to the mirror as he pushed his hands into his face. He hated these kinds of conversations because it made him feel like a bad example to Lily. She was younger than him but already so much more mature.</p><p align="left">Lily looked around in his apartment while her cousin was showering, looking at the laptop that was flipped open. Going over the touchpad it seemed that Remus didn't have a password on his laptop. She rolled her eyes. "You're so dumb." She sat down behind it, noticing that he still had some tabs open. Most of them were research for his job.</p><p align="left">He worked in an alternative clothing shop which sold mostly goth but also rock, punk and metal clothes. It suited him, he always wore black and sometimes a white shirt but combined with ripped black jeans. He still liked his hair shorter which most of the guys that came in the shop didn't, they all had long hair or at least shoulder length while Remus had more of a David Beckham but slightly longer on the sides kind of style. Lily liked his ear piercings the most, they gave Remus a rough look that went along with his tattoos. She herself always wanted to have tattoos but never found inspiration for a design.</p><p align="left">The other tabs were just porn which didn't surprise Lily at all, she had never in her life seen Remus with a partner before. She had no idea what kind of type he was into. At first, she had thought that he was asexual until he had stated to be dating someone. Unfortunately, it didn't work out and no one ever got to see the mysterious date of Remus Lupin.</p><p align="left">"I'm ready, so let's go."<em> </em>It didn't bother him that she was on his laptop, he didn't have to hide anything from her. Lily was very open-minded and didn't question too many things. She never asked why he got torture devices on his arm. Maybe she just didn't want to know but Remus was pretty sure she just wouldn't understand anyway. </p><p align="left">"Alright, you got everything? Keys, money and your mother's pills so we can bring them back to her?" She pulled up an eyebrow at him.</p><p align="left">Remus smirked, putting the bottle into his shoulder bag along with the keys and his wallet. "You're going to be an amazing mother one day, I can feel it." He laughed, grabbing her waist and squeezing her against him.</p><p align="left">"Oh shut up." She slightly blushed, thinking about her having a family one day and Remus being the unstable godfather of her children. </p><p align="left">--</p><p align="left">They arrived at the art gallery, it was an exposition that showed work from young artists that wanted to make a break through. Lily was still studying philosophy and wanted to become a writer once she was done, she always loved to go to galleries to get inspiration and Remus went along to discover what kind of crazy things were being called art now.</p><p align="left">It wasn't too busy at the moment, around 15 people were looking at the paintings and sculptures. A couple of them were the artists themselves, giving a bit more explanation to their work for the people interested.</p><p align="left">Remus moved closer to Lily so he wouldn't have to talk too loud. "Euhm, Lily that guy is definitely checking you out. Just so you know." </p><p align="left">"Who? Where?" She was looking around for the guy, meeting with some hazel coloured eyes. The guy gave her a charming smile which she kindly returned. "Is it okay if I go over to him?" She looked a bit worried at Remus. </p><p align="left">"Of course! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine looking at this... art?" </p><p align="left">She rolled her eyes and went over to this guy who was what you would call handsome. "Hey, I'm Lily, any of these yours?" She offered him a hand which he shook.</p><p align="left">"James Potter, yes I made the one with the stag." He pointed over at a sculpture that represented a very strange formed animal. </p><p align="left">"Oh yeah, I see it! Looks amazing, why a stag?" She looked intrigued, hoping to hear some cool backstory that would lead to the making of this sculpture.</p><p align="left">"Nothing too special, once when I was little me and my father found a wounded baby stag so we nursed it. It still lives with my parents now, it's kind of cute to see how fond it is of them."<em> </em>He chuckled, looking over to Lily. <em>"</em>So, he's not your boyfriend right?"<em> </em>He nodded towards Remus.</p><p align="left">Lily shook her head and smirked. "No not in a million years! He's my cousin and even if he wasn't, he's not my type." She gave him a playful wink.</p><p align="left">"Well I know someone who would be interested in him, maybe we could go on a double date? You and me, him and my best friend?" </p><p align="left">"What does she look like?" Lily was quite interested to hear about this girl not because she wanted to hook up Remus but because she wasn't too fond of a guy with a female best friend.</p><p align="left">"No my best friend is a guy, your friend is gay right? I mean, he looks like he is." James felt a bit awkward by now, Sirius had been with quite a lot of men so James felt like he had developed a good enough gay radar by now to be his friend's wingman.</p><p align="left">"To be fair I don't really know but I don't think he is?" She was getting a bit confused herself now, remembering that Remus did watch straight porn but that didn't mean that he wasn't secretly beating off to the guy. "This guy what does he look like?" Now she was curious because she had never thought about her cousin dating another guy.</p><p align="left">"Wait I have a picture of him, he's a bit special but that's why I thought your cousin would be into him. He seems like that kind of guy."<em>  </em>James took his phone out of his pocket, showing Lily a picture of Sirius. "I know he seems like a whole lot but he's the best. Also for a guy he has a great ass."<em> </em>He smirked. </p><p align="left">Lily grinned slightly at that comment, taking in the picture of this young guy. He was the perfect balance between feminine and masculine, long black hair in a messy bun, a small amount of makeup, lip and eyebrow piercing, a loose black crop top above some sweatpants with mesh and plain black creepers. Though she also noticed that almost every visible part of his skin was covered with thick scars. "What happened to him?" </p><p align="left">James knew that she was talking about Sirius' scars<em>. "</em>Abusive past which gave him mania. It used to be really bad because we didn't know that he had mania but now he's taking medication. He still has the urge to self-harm time to time but he tells me so I can watch him while he does it. I know it sounds weird but I rather know that he's doing it so I'm there if something goes wrong than him hiding it from me and accidently killing himself." </p><p align="left">Lily didn't really know how to respond to that, she had been through Remus drug abuse but it was nothing compared to seeing someone close to you hurt themselves so vividly. "You know what I'll tell him that he has to go on that double date with me and we'll see how that works out. Even if he isn't gay they seem like they would at least have some of the same interests." She pointed at the piercings on the guys face. "What's his name?"</p><p align="left">
  <strong>"Sirius Black."</strong>
