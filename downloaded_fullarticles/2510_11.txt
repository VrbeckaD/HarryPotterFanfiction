    <p>This is it. Our hero has accomplished her dream</p><p>Of annoying Lucius Malfoy. Yes, THE Lucius Malfoy.</p><p>Right now we see our hero (me, in case you haven't noticed, this is about me, but from an outsiders point of view) standing in a...</p><p>Bathtub.</p><p>Our hero wanders closer to said bathtub, and fills it up precisely 3/5 of the way.</p><p>"Perfect," she says, dipping her toe in.</p><p>Soon she is standing knee deep in the water.</p><p>It's cold water.</p><p>Precisely, cool.</p><p>But it's cold.</p><p>Our hero, shivering slightly, turns towards the constellation out the window, Sirius.</p><p>Yes, I know what your thinking.</p><p>You're thinking of Sirius. Sirius Black.</p><p>*CUE GASPS OF SHOCK, HORROR, AND MAYBE DELIGHT*</p><p>Well, this tidbit of information is actually important.</p><p>It will take our hero to Sirius Black's current residence.</p><p>Yes, you are correct.</p><p>Number 12, Grimmauld Place, Order of the Phoenix Headquarters, current residence of the (annoyed and restless) Sirius Black.</p><p>In case you are thinking *is this about our hero going to the HP universe? Isn't this set today? Isn't Sirius's residence at Grimmauld in 1995? *</p><p>You are correct, and you will find out more about that later.</p><p>Anyway, back to our hero.</p><p>She turns towards Sirius (the constellation), and whispers some carefully chosen words.</p><p>
  <em>"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."</em>
</p><p>Then our hero is whisked into the depths of time and universes.</p><p>LMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLM</p><p>Y/N groans.</p><p>Has she done it?</p><p>Has she reached the HP Universe? And also gone back in time to 1995? (Told you).</p><p>She looks around.</p><p>Our hero has arrived through a Universe-Time-Portal into a dusty old attic.</p><p>She doesn't know if it is Grimmauld Place or not, but it is.</p><p>She just doesn't know that.</p><p>Our hero quickly gets up and dusts herself of, then quietly creeps down the stepladder of the Attic.</p><p>
  <em>Cr-e-e-e-a-a-a-k...</em>
</p><p>Oh, dear.</p><p>"Who are you! Are you a Death Eater? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS DUM-Uh, my house!"</p><p>That was Sirius Black, in case you didn't understand.</p><p>Y/N looks wildly up at the man in front of her.</p><p>He has shoulder-length black hair, piercing, haunted gray eyes, and has a wand pointed at her face.</p><p>"Sirius! Mr. Black! Let-let me explain! Please! You can use Veritaserum on me if you like!"</p><p>Our hero cowers under Sirius's stare but looks up hopefully when he slowly lowers his wand.</p><p>"Okay, so, Sirius, you may not believe this but basically...I came from another universe just to annoy Lucius Malfoy and then return! That's all, I swear!"</p><p>You can just barely see the twinkle in Sirius's eye when she mentions pranking Malfoy, but his eyes harden.</p><p>"How can I believe you?"</p><p>Y/N thinks.</p><p>She can't tell him in her universe that he's part of a book series, because he'll ask her abut his fate...hmm...</p><p>"Um, you're friends at Hogwarts called you Padfoot, you <em>weren't </em>the potter's Secret Keeper, that rat Pettigrew was, um, you uh, made the Marauders map," Our hero says quickly.</p><p>Padfoot looks up at her in shock.</p><p>"W-how...did you know that?"</p><p>Our hero knows that she can't reveal anything so she just says simply,</p><p>"Well, that's for me to know and you to find out. I'm Ari, by the way. So, can you help me prank Lucius?"</p><p>Sirius decides to trust her, and grins mischievously.</p><p>"Sure. What do you want to do?"</p><p>"Well, you see..."</p><p>LMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLM</p><p>We now come to our hero and her Animagus friend, Sirius Black, escaped convict, Marauder, and prankster extraordinaire.</p><p>What are they doing, you ask?</p><p>Trying to set up a Floo connection to Malfoy Manor. (Sirius isn't coming)</p><p>You see, the wards around Malfoy Manor are so strong that you have to do some tricky ward-magic to be able to get through.</p><p>Right now, we see Sirius leafing through many Dark magic books on wards, while Y/N paces impatiently.</p><p>"Oh! Got it!"</p><p>"Really?" Our hero asks eagerly, and runs over to where Sirius has found a way to break the wards for 1 hour exactly.</p><p>"Perfect!"</p><p>LMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLMLM</p><p>Y/N tumbles out of the fireplace in the living room of Malfoy Manor, clutching Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, and a fake elder wand to scare them off. She is under the disillusionment charm that will wear off in approximately 2 minutes.</p><p>She can hear the Death Eater meeting going on in the next room, and so she quietly creeps in. Nobody notices the slight creaking of the dining room door, and so she is safe.</p><p>Then our hero turns towards the edge of the table and stifles a gasp.</p><p>Voldemort!</p><p>THE Voldemort!</p><p>The Dark Lord!</p><p>He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named</p><p>You-Know-Who!</p><p>
  <em>Tom Marvolo Riddle</em>
</p><p>I am Lord Voldemort!</p><p>Tommy Ole' Boy</p><p>AH!</p><p>This isn't one of her best moments. I mean, its VOLDEMORT! He is so creepy...and Dark... and pure <em>evil </em>that she cant ever understand why her Baby Dray-Draco is anywhere <em>near </em>his family or the Dark Lord!</p><p>But still, she must carry out her prank, then get back to Grimmauld, and return to her Universe and Time.</p><p>So she quietly creeps up behind Lucius Malfoy's chair, shivering when she passes behind Tom Riddle (what if he sees me? What if he <em>kills </em>me!).</p><p>And then she carefully whispers into Malfoy's ear just as the disillusionment charm is wearing off,</p><p>"<em>Hi, Lucy,"</em></p><p>Malfoy gives a pleasant, ear-splitting shriek and jumps out of his chair quickly.</p><p>Our hero knows what she has to do now.</p><p>Y/N quickly, (shaking with fear, because <em>Voldemort is right there, omigod, omigod</em>), jumps across the table to Draco, and kisses him on the lips, the slaps Voldemort in the face (<em>omigod, omigod, omigod, am I gonna die?</em>).</p><p>Then she throws the Darkness Powder on the ground and everything is dark (except to her, of course).</p><p>She can hear furious cries of outrage, Tom's cries of,</p><p>"Who was that Mudblood brat? Where is she? Get her!"</p><p>Draco's cries of,</p><p>"Eugh! She kissed me!"</p><p>And Lucy's indignant cries of,</p><p>"<em>LUCY!</em>"</p><p>She rushes out of the room, waving her Fake Elder Wand high in the air incase they see her, grabs some Floo Powder, and whispers into the fireplace (so they don't hear her),</p><p>"<em>Number 12, Grimmauld Place!"</em></p><p>WHOOSH!</p><p>Our hero tumbles into the living room of Grimmauld Place, where Sirius is pacing anxiously, but stops when he sees her unharmed.</p><p>"Dear, God! What happened, Y/N? Tell me every detail!"</p><p>And so our hero told him.</p><p>"Lucy! Ahaha!"</p><p>"You <em>kissed </em>him!?"</p><p>"No! You <em>didn't</em>!"</p><p>"Nice escape!"</p><p>And with that, Y/N told him that she had to say goodbye, and if he could not mention this to anyone, as it just wouldn't do.</p><p>"I really must be going, Padfoot. It was so nice meeting you," She says through her tears, hugging him fiercely.</p><p>"Take care of Harry, 'Kay?"</p><p>Sirius grins.</p><p>"Of course! Now, off you go!"</p><p>So our hero trudges up the stairs towards a bathroom, fills it up precisely 3/5of the way, steps in, shivering, and faces the Sirius constellation.</p><p>"<em>Mischief Managed."</em></p><p>She whispers, and then our hero is sucked away towards home.</p><p>Voldemort never did find out who cause such a commotion during his meeting.</p><p>Sirius never really questioned how that mysterious girl got there, how she knew him, and why she wanted to kiss Draco Malfoy.</p><p>And he never told anyone what happened until he died later that year.</p><p>But he made sure to tell James and Lily, and Remus and Tonks when they came,</p><p>Over,</p><p>And over,</p><p>And over again.</p>
