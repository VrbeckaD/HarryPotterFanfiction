    <p>Surprises weren’t anything I particularly liked. Well… no, that’s not true. I DID like surprises. Just none that landed me somewhere I couldn’t figure out how to get out of.<br/>
Like right now.<br/>
Frowning I threw another plate out of the window into nothingness. The blackness of vast, empty space had long lost its appeal to me. It was simply… black.<br/>
A crash signified the plate had somehow returned into the apartment and smashed onto the ground. Just like the other things that I had used to check the apartment’s defences. Helpless rage bubbled inside of me. I had been in this stupid apartment for thirty-four whole days now. Four bedrooms, one living room, two bathrooms, a big kitchen, a small gym and a small library with books I had already read.<br/>
Thankfully, the water worked and was drinkable. Also, there was more than enough food in the fridge and pantry, enough to last me for years, actually.<br/>
I sincerely hoped I would get out earlier.<br/>
For the third time now I jumped out of the window, not even surprised anymore when I landed on the apartment floor with an audible “Ooof!”<br/>
“Oh, bloody hell!”, I screamed and kicked at the nearby sofa.<br/>
Yeah, I wasn’t that good with being imprisoned. Even if it WAS a nice prison.<br/>
Grumbling I picked up the shards of the plate and threw them into the trash that seemingly emptied itself whenever I closed it.<br/>
I was so bored out of my mind that I had picked up doing one hour on the cross trainer in the morning and one in the evening. Around midday I made use of the punching bag to let out my frustrations. Between those I read some of the books in the library, though since I already knew them, I skimmed over some parts I knew to be unimportant or uninteresting, so it didn’t take long for me to finish them.<br/>
Jeesh.<br/>
I had taken to cooking lavish meals, just so I had something else to do. </p><p>PLOP!<br/>
</p>
<p>…<br/>
Plop…?</p><p>Blinking in confusion I peeped around the door frame separating the living room from the kitchen and… stared.<br/>
There were two people half lying on the Sofa, half on the ground. The posture looked REALLY uncomfortable. But still, they seemed to be sleeping soundly.<br/>
I remembered the day I had woken up here in a similar fashion, though I had nearly smashed my face in as I hadn’t expected to lie under a narrow table. And sitting up abruptly is not such a good idea when lying underneath a solid oak table, I tell you.<br/>
Maybe I could make their arrival a little more… painless.<br/>
…<br/>
Or not.<br/>
With an evil smile I threw a plate out of the window.<br/>
One… Two… </p><p>CRASH!</p><p>Two panicked squeaks echoed through the apartment, followed by hysterical screaming.<br/>
I yawned and grinned. I hadn’t had that much excitement since… well… since I had landed here.<br/>
But hey, maybe I was being a bit of an asshole there. </p><p>“Good morning, sleepy-heads”, I greeted the two while calmly sweeping the shards together to depose of. They looked at me as if I had grown another head, and huddled together to protect themselves. From me.<br/>
“Oh, come on!”<br/>
I rolled my eyes. “I’m in the same boat as you two, I just arrived a few weeks before you did. Choose a bedroom, the left one is mine, the other three are empty. I’ll cook. Anything you don’t eat?”<br/>
The two stared at me, though they edged closer to the doors I had pointed to. They seemed… frightened. Of me.<br/>
While they chose their rooms, I chopped two chicken breasts, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, beans and zucchini, squeezed some lemon juice, mixed that with a bit of olive oil, spices, herbs and coconut milk, put everything into a casserole, sprinkled it liberally with mozzarella and put it in the oven. I then cooked some rice, washed a head of lettuce and set the table.<br/>
It seemed the smells of the oven-chick’n’veggies did the trick to get the two girls out of their rooms, so I just motioned to the chairs and started serving them.<br/>
“My name is Nina, by the way”, I informed them lightly and forced a smile onto my lips. I was glad my boring routine had been disrupted, but those two already got on my nerves without saying anything.<br/>
“I don’t like mushrooms”, came the first complaint already. “And I don’t eat meat”, the second one grumbled.<br/>
I could feel the slight tick in my left eyelid I always got when I was close to the end of my patience, which was ridiculous. Those two had only just arrived a few minutes ago. How could they be headache inducing already?<br/>
“Eat… or starve”, I quoted from one of my favourite movies and shoved some food into my mouth to keep me from saying something I would regret later. They tentatively tried the food and pulled faces. Jeesh! I had explicitly asked them if there was anything they didn’t eat, and they hadn’t answered. So now they were stuck with this, and they wouldn’t get anything else until they had finished their food.<br/>
Had I known they would be THAT ungrateful, I would have put the amount of pepperoncini in that I usually preferred, and not opted for a mild version.<br/>
Brats.<br/>
“So, what are your names?”, I asked, trying to get my animosity under control. Just what was up with me really?!<br/>
They eyed me suspiciously, but told me their names. The redhead was called Annabelle. She looked like one. Small and willowy with red curls bouncing on her shoulders and freckles all over every piece of exposed skin… she was kind of cute. Or would be, if her attitude wasn’t that repugnant.<br/>
Or was that just me? Was I too judgemental after my brief time without any human contact?<br/>
The blonde was called Clarice. She was pretty as a doll and had a bit of the Barbie-flair going on. She was taller than me, but I supposed she had to be about ten years my junior. At the very least. Annabelle seemed a bit older, in her early twenties, maybe. </p><p>After they had choked down the food I had made, I took them to work with doing the dishes and cleaning the table. I had never been a particularly tidy person when it was just me in my own apartment (it was clean, mind you, just not particularly tidy), but in the last few weeks I had found surroundings where everything had its place kind of… soothing. Anyway, after we had cleaned up I showed them to the bathroom I wasn’t using. They would have to share, I wasn’t going to put up with their attitude more that I would have to. And the both of them looked like they took their time in the morning.<br/>
I also showed them the library. They were far more enthusiastic than I had been; obviously they found some books they hadn’t read yet.<br/>
Figures.<br/>
“Rules”, I stated then. “Bedroom rules: Keep your place tidy. I have no idea how many more people we will have to house here. Bathroom rules: Keep it tidy and clean. I will not lift a finger to clean it. And you won’t like me when I am pissed. Kitchen rules: Put everything back from where you took it. After every meal I want the place spotless. No one touches my spices. Living room rules: Put everything you use away again. No taking anything into your rooms without informing all others about it and asking if it is okay. Library rules: No taking out any books without putting the book title on the page with your name on it and putting a replacement card where you pulled it out. After returning it you cross out the book title and put it in the exact place it has been in before. Got it?”<br/>
The two girls stared at me wide eyed. Yes, maybe I was a bit weird to them. I had been alone for over a month, dammit! I was allowed to be weird! And they really grated on my nerves. It wasn’t as if they had actually done anything to warrant my curt behaviour, but I just couldn’t… After weeks of pining for human contact I now just wished them gone again.<br/>
Wonderful.</p><p>The two gave me mutinous looks and then disappeared together into one of their rooms. I sighed. I got the feeling I would start missing my solitude sooner rather than later. </p><p>PLOP!<br/>
</p>
<p>…<br/>
Plop? Again?</p><p>I frowned and turned around, only to see a black clad woman with black hair hanging over the back of the sofa. If I would have had to stay in that position, I was pretty sure I would puke my guts out after a minute.<br/>
Oh, well. </p><p>I cleared my throat.<br/>
I cleared it again, louder.<br/>
“Hey!”<br/>
…<br/>
Still nothing. Maybe I would have to use the same method as before… So, I took a plate and threw it out the window.<br/>
One… Two… </p><p>CRASH!</p><p>Nothing happened. </p><p>I frowned harder and stared at the body contemplatively, while Annabelle and Clarice appeared again, looking worried. I simply started cleaning up the shards of the plate, before standing next to our newest addition.<br/>
Was she dead?<br/>
Two fingers on her pulse point showed me that her heart was still beating, at least. “What’s with her?”, Annabelle asked, sounding frightened. I just rolled my eyes. How the hell should I know?! So, I ignored her and pulled the unconscious girl properly onto the sofa, where I could look at her. She was older than I had expected, probably somewhere around my age, and obviously a metal head.<br/>
I liked Manowar too, but I hadn’t tattooed the Band logo onto my throat.<br/>
Whatever.<br/>
I raised my hand and smacked her in the face. Clarice squeaked and Annabelle made a noise as if she wanted to interfere, but finally, finally the metal head opened her eyes. Wide.<br/>
With a shocked expression her hand went to her cheek and she stared at me, bevor jumping to her feet, finding that she wasn’t as sure on her feet as she would have liked, paled and fell to the ground.<br/>
“Hi there, I’m Nina”, I said, completely unconcerned, before turning around and pointing to the others, “this is Annabelle and that’s Clarice. Welcome to your new prison with the blackness of space outside the windows and a back-to-sender policy when one tries to leave.”<br/>
She stared at me and I simply smiled noncommittally. Okay, I had to admit, maybe the time alone HAD made me into an asshole. An asshole without tact, to boot.<br/>
Her eyes jumped around and took in her surroundings before resettling on me. “I’m Alice…”<br/>
Another PLOP! had all of us turning around into the direction of the sound, expecting another girl, though… there was a glowing face hanging in the air.<br/>
A… face. Glowing. And… hanging in the air.<br/>
We all stared at it as if it would tell us what it wanted if we only looked at it hard enough. It just… hovered there.<br/>
“Okay, I’m pretty sure that ups the creep-factor of this place”, I commented about a minute later, but it didn’t really bother me. Having been stuck in this place for over a month I was pretty sure there wasn’t much that would faze me anymore.<br/>
“What the hell?!”, Alice growled in her raspy tone and looked from me to the face and back. “You just accept that?! Where are we? What are we doing here? How did I get here?!”<br/>
I could only shrug though. How the hell should I know?!</p><p>“Oh, there now, finally! The loop must have stopped…”<br/>
We resembled statues for a second, before all our eyes snapped to the face that seemed to have garnered an upper body and a voice while we had talked.<br/>
It was a bald man, quite young, with dark kohl rimmed eyes. He was shirtless and… quite nice to look at, I had to admit.<br/>
“I apologize for startling you, ladies”, the dude drawled and indicated a shallow bow, which looked… weird without legs or even hips.<br/>
None of the others reacted, so it was obviously on me: “No problem…”<br/>
The dude grinned. “Wonderful. So, before we come to the important part… do you have chocolate? I haven’t tasted chocolate in centuries!”<br/>
My left eyebrow climbed up slowly, but I obediently got him a box of chocolate from the kitchen and held it out to him, staying just out of his reach myself, but making it possible for him to take one of the pralines.<br/>
He chewed and moaned so lewdly I got the urge to cover the other girls’ ears. I didn’t move though.<br/>
After clearing my throat the thing seemed to snap out of it and coughed. “As to why I’m here… I’m here to explain things to you.”<br/>
He said that as if it explained everything and didn’t elaborate.<br/>
“And WHAT exactly are you here to explain?”, I prompted. He really was getting on my nerves right now, especially as he started chuckling. “Why you’re here, of course!”<br/>
Again, my left eyelid started to twitch. If he didn’t spill soon, I would sic the girls on him. All three of them. He wouldn’t be laughing anymore then…<br/>
Somehow he seemed to read some of my thoughts on my face, because he cleared his throat nervously and shook himself. “All of you have died before your time”, he told us and I pulled a face. I was dead? I didn’t feel dead… “So, I cannot let you into the underworld. I can’t let you go back either though.”<br/>
Wonderful. Would we be stuck in this apartment until it was our time then? I was pretty sure I would go mad!<br/>
“Sooo, I took the liberty of preparing a few alternatives.”<br/>
With this he waved his hand around and some piles of books appeared in front of him. My eyebrows rose again. Game of Thrones, Shadowhunters, Twilight, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Kate Daniels, Narnia, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Warrior Cats, Percy Jackson&gt; and Eragon were lying around. I pulled a face. I couldn’t stand some of them. But still, what did he mean by ALTERNATIVES?<br/>
Something collided with my shoulder and nearly had me sprawling on the floor. What the…?!<br/>
Clarice had barged past me and thrown me out of the way to make a grab for the Twilight books. “MINE!!!”, she screeched and I blinked, completely overwhelmed. What the hell? She didn’t even know what these ALTERNATIVES would be!<br/>
The naked dude just grinned though. “You’ve made your choice.”<br/>
With that Clarice vanished into thin air.<br/>
“Did you… did you just transport her into the books?”, I asked, forcing myself to stay calm as he just nodded, glee on his face. Okay then. My eyes wandered over the other books. Which one would I want to be in? I stopped at Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that would do the trick.<br/>
“I don’t want to go into a book world, I just wanna go home!”, Annabelle whined and actually started crying, which had me rolling my eyes, before I could stop myself.<br/>
What the hell?! I had never been this jaded, this indifferent to the pain of others!<br/>
The glowing baldy just rolled his eyes though and snipped his fingers. Annabelle disappeared.<br/>
“What… what did you do? Where is she?!”, I asked, slightly panicked, but the stranger just rolled his eyes again. “Back into your world, she just got born again. So, come on then, I don’t have all day!”<br/>
Oh well. I had always wanted to live in Middle Earth. So…<br/>
“I’ll take that”, Alice said and grabbed the books before vanishing.<br/>
Wait… what?<br/>
Uncomprehending I stared at the place where Tolkien’s masterpiece had lain just a few seconds ago.<br/>
“Seriously?!”, I snarled and threw my hands in the air.<br/>
Wonderful.<br/>
Grudgingly I looked over my other possibilities. Eragon, Warrior Cats and Percy Jackson were obviously out. I didn’t like the first two and I would probably start screaming if I had to live through the inaccuracies in the third. Game of Thrones… I really didn’t want to die, so no to that one too.<br/>
That left Shadowhunters, Harry Potter, Kate Daniels, Narnia and Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. I wasn’t one for drug-induced hallucinations, so Wonderland was off the table, and Kate Daniels just simply had too much blood, gore and sex in it. Shadowhunters would probably bore me after the first few years… So that only left Narnia and Harry Potter, both of them series I really liked, but I leaned towards Harry Potter.<br/>
They might have war and Voldemort and Death Eaters, but at least they had showers and toothbrushes there.<br/>
I sighed. “I’ll take Harry Potter”, I informed the dude and wanted to pick the series up, when he began speaking. “Good choice, good choice”, he muttered, “but I have watched you the last month. I think you would be bored, if I gave you the usual treatment…”<br/>
The… usual treatment? What was that supposed to mean?!<br/>
“Oh yes, I know…”<br/>
And with that the whole collector’s box slammed into my chest.<br/>
And everything went dark.</p>
