</p><hr/><p>"He's dead now, Potter! Your beloved godfather is dead!" Bellatrix mocks as she stands near the Veil after killing Sirius.</p><p>Lillian's rage blinds her, but it is her despair that made her go after the crazy woman the moment Sirius fell lifeless to the ground.</p><p>"I'll kill you!" she howls, launching herself at the insane woman. "I'll kill you, Lestrange!"</p><p>For her part, Bellatrix isn't afraid of her and simply cackles madly.</p><p>"No, Lillian!"</p><p>Lillian hears Remus shout the warning, as well as the other Order and D.A. members who are watching her become blinded by her anger.</p><p>"Don't do it, Lillian!" she hears Hermione yell and Ron's call of, "Don't let her get to you, Lil!"</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Lillian ignores all of them. She eyes the Veil for a swift moment while she runs. Immediately, she comes up with a plan to finally dispose the mad witch.</p><p>"Do you even have the guts to kill someone, Potter?" Bellatrix asks tauntingly as Lillian runs towards her. "Do you?!"</p><p>"YES!" Lillian answers as she closes the distances between them. "I HAVE!"</p><p>Bellatrix waves her wand using a non-verbal magic, but the scarlet light that shot out from the woman's wand tells Lillian what spell it is.</p><p>It is a disarming charm, but Lillian hastily erects a barrier by uttering, "Protego!"</p><p>At once, Bellatrix spell rebounds against her shield charm. However, it isn't the only spell that Bellatrix has prepared for her, for Lillian sees three other different spells that comes her way.</p><p>Lillian doesn't have time to cast another strong shield charm, so she twists away and evades the spells just in time. One nearly grazes her left shoulder by inches, but she is gratefully unscathed when she arrives next to Bellatrix.</p><p>She doesn't give the woman another chance to cast another spell for she instantly grabs a hold of the woman's wand arm and shortly shoves her into the Veil.</p><p>It is Lillian's intent to push Bellatrix in the Veil and see her go through it. However, what she doesn't expect is to end up being swept into the Veil as well.</p><p>Bellatrix Lestrange had gotten a hold of her for a brief moment, and as a consequence, Lillian fell into the veil together with the crazy witch.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>It feels like being doused with an icy cold water when Lillian went through the Veil. Yet it doesn't feel like water at all when her body hits something solid not soon after. The impact is so sudden and so powerful that Lillian feels her teeth rattle and her bones shake as she is dump into the ground unexpectedly.</p><p>Somewhere around her, she hears the sound of people gasping out loud at her sudden appearance.</p><p>Lillian's eyes shot open and saw to her confusion that she is no longer in the Death Chamber where the Veil is located, instead she is somewhere else; a place where people wearing old-fashioned clothing occupies most of the vast room.</p><p>She rolls to her right, and her mouth nearly drops as she sees the looming monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and twisted metal, where a man sits, nearly uncomfortably, at the top of it.</p><p><em>A throne</em>, Lillian thinks in wonder as her attention came to pause on the silver-haired man sitting on the throne of swords. Her gaze immediately locks into a pair of dark violet eyes.</p><p>Lillian notices the crown on the man's head and knows him to be a King.</p><p><em>But King of what country?</em> Lillian wonders silently.</p><p>However, before Lillian can contemplate more on that, she hears the voice of the woman she wants to kill.</p><p>"It seems to me that we are still both alive, Potter, after crossing the Veil."</p><p>Lillian twists around with her wand raised. She instantly bares her teeth as her gaze lands on Bellatrix Lestrange, who stands yards away from her.</p><p>"You!" Lillian manages to say through gritted teeth while she quickly got to her feet.</p><p>"Surprise to see me still alive, Potter?" the woman sneers, and Lillian cares not about the muggles who were watching the interchange between her and the mad woman, because Lillian only cares about was to permanently silence the witch before her.</p><p>Lillian wants to end her in the same way Bellatrix Lestrange ended Sirius' life.</p><p>She raises her wand, preparing to attack her, while Bellatrix does the same as well.</p><p>However, a voice interrupts them before they can start dueling.</p><p>"HALT!" a voice booms across the cavernous hall and Lillian looks up to see the man in the throne speaking.</p><p>"Who are you and how are you able to appear in my throne room?!" the man demands, standing up from his seat to walk down the steps of his monstrous throne.</p><p>Neither Lillian nor Bellatrix spoke as they watch the man descend from his Iron Throne.</p><p>Meanwhile, the people around them began to talk and whisper amongst themselves as they watch everything unfold with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>"I am King Aegon I Targaren and I demand an answer!" the man says as he halts at the bottom steps where two knights wearing white armor stands at attention and with their sword drawn out.</p><p>Lillian tenses when the man slowly draws out his sword as well and points the blade at both her and Bellatrix.</p><p>"Speak now and I vow that no harm shall come to you!" He says in a commanding voice, his purple eyes flashing in warning.</p><p>"Are you threatening me, you filthy muggle?!" was Bellatrix Lestrange only words for the man.</p><p>The man opens his mouth to answer. However, Bellatrix didn't give him a chance to say anything else for the insane woman suddenly raises her wand at him with a deadly purpose.</p><p>"If so, then die you worthless human!"</p><p>Lillian curses underneath her breath and moves instinctively.</p><p>"I think not, Lestrange!" She yells, running towards the silver-haired King with the intent to protect him. "He is not dying while under my watch, you bitch!"</p><p>"Carnificare!" Bellatrix shouts, in the same instance, Lillian cries out, "Triplex Clypeus!"</p><p>Lillian is able to conjure a strong shield charm just in time for Bellatrix's decapitating hex to go shooting for the man, who calls himself King Aegon I Targaryen.</p><p>And thus the duel begins.</p><p>.</p><p>. </p>
