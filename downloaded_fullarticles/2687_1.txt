  <strong>1. Frightened Kiss</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newt belongs to the wild. Percival, city wizard, tamed and domesticated, knowing only the law of the streets and the city halls, can feel the old land in his lover still. It beats in his blood and drums in the rhythm of his magic, quicksilver and erratic, in a pattern only the wild magic understands. It’s a rich, intoxicating mix of laughter and curiosity, a cheek that mocks the carefully constructed rules of Percival’s world and makes a fool of his laws. He loves it, he’s drunk on it, he might die for it, if Newt asked him to.</p>
<p>Newt, who is shy and wary, demanding and brave, all at once, all mixed up with no apology for any of it - none that he means anyway, not really. Not in the deep and unyielding way he loves his beasts. Not with the same sincerity he holds the gaze of a wounded Nundu, or the true kindness with which he lifts a sick Occamy chick up to feel the warmth of the sun on its scales.</p>
<p>Newt dreams in far off places, in a world that turns to its own whims and cares nothing for the rules of city wizards and their petty demands. Percival can hear the forests in his voice when he talks of his travels, can smell the tang of the ocean and feel the touch of the desert sun on his lover’s sun-freckled skin. The power of it is phenomenal, daunting, inexorable, and Percival - collared by printed laws and wearing the silver shackles of MACUSA’s authority - he fears its intentions. When Newt lies in his arms, fingers tracing on Percival’s skin the patterns the waves make against the Côte d'Ivoire, he can hear it calling. He knows that time is short, that every time Newt turns his head and looks off to the sky, or to the distant places only he can see, that it grows shorter still.</p>
<p>And so Percival holds him tight, presses him close, and tries to drown out that siren song with the only love his paper-nicked and law-bound hands can give. He holds him tight and firm, his own dark and jealous strength set against the beauty of the wild. And if his kisses are deep it’s love and desperation and fear too, and the knowledge that some day, maybe not so far off now, he will slip up and the wild will come for him, roaring and triumphant, to take back its own. </p>
