He had in fact just finished his detention with Umbridge but thankfully his wound had stopped bleeding, but Nikita couldn't wait to kill Umbridge if she used the same thing on other students.</p><p>He sits up in his dorm room to get away from everyone who are acting like idiots because Voldemort had returned and the Ministry is slandering whoever is making the claims, thankfully Nikita hadn't been so vocal about the claims as he and Cedric had escaped from him and his death-eaters the year before, Nikita had told Cedric that it was possible that the ministry would deny the claim and to not be so vocal, thankfully Cedric had heeded the advice.</p><p>Suddenly a knock sounds on the door, the door opens to reveal Ronald Weasley, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom who all enter the room, Seamus asks in his Irish accent "you alright, Harry ?"</p><p>"yes, I'm fine, just thinking about everything that is going on" replies Nikita in an English accent (thankfully it's fake but the others don't know it, yet). He stands up, turns around before he turns towards the four before he says "I need to be alone for a while" he then asks "can you three leave so that I can be alone, please ?"</p><p>"of course, everything everyone is saying must be stressing you out" exclaims Dean.</p><p>"it is" nods Nikita, the three teen boys leave Nikita alone as he thinks about some things as he starts to take out his weapons, he then starts to polish his daggers and his other weapons before suddenly a giant portal opens behind him, it sucks him inside it taking his daggers and his other weapons that he has on him along with a bag with a Vibraniam Prosthetic Arm that Nikita's best friend and Nikita had made together because Nikita was told by Luna Lovegood to have it made the previous year, his vision goes black after he is sucked inside the portal.</p><hr/><p>On the Isle of the Lost, on board the Lost Revenge is a fifteen year old Harry Hook, he is helping his captain, Uma help out the kids who are being abused at home, the Lost Revenge had become a safe haven for abused kids, ever since Mal and Jay had gone to Auradon leaving Evie and Carlos behind on the Isle things had been pretty interesting, the other gang leaders including Uma had decided to make Mal's old territory into a neutral zone where they could trade between themselves. Harry had found out that after Mal and Jay had left that Gil and Carlos had gotten together and that the two had started to date. The abused kids all ended up on the Lost Revenge, the homeless kids ended up with Harry's older sister, the kids who weren't very evil ended up with the Anti-Heroes Club which was lead by Yen Sid but among the kids, the leader is Claudine Frollo, the many gangs of the Isle had all agree to make Mal's old territory into neutral ground. The gangs were the Wharf Rats with Uma as the captain, Harriet Hook's Crew with Harriet as the captain, The Hunters Gang with Yuan, son of Shan-Yu as the leader, The Witches Coven with Mad Maddy, the eldest Granddaughter of Madam Mim as the leader and the Banker's Gang with Rick Ratcliffe, the son of Governor Radcliffe as the leader. Harry, of course, being the first mate was also the one to be in meetings between the leaders with their right hand men or women. Uma tells him that it's time for the meeting that is happening that day.</p><p>In fact it is just after that meeting Harry's life will change, Harry is walking back to the ship since Uma had decided to stay to talk more with the leaders, he heads toward the dock where the Lost Revenge is, not knowing that inside his quarters is a surprise waiting for him.</p><p>Harry enters his quarters to find a portal, he is sucked into the portal, his vision goes black after he is sucked inside the portal.</p><hr/><p>Peter Parker, aged fifteen, is sitting in his room. Peter is working on his homework, a knock sounds on the door, it opens to reveal Peter's Aunt May, she says to Peter "I'm heading off to the store. Is there anything you want ?"</p><p>"Some chocolate please, Aunt May" replies Peter, his Aunt tells Peter that she'll get the chocolate for him but is interrupted by Peter's police scanner, the person on the scanner says "all nearby officers, we have a 10-20 (AN: also known as a 10-30 if the website I got the info from is correct) at JP-Morgan Chase, ten suspects, they have hostages with a 10-33" Peter looks at his Aunt in a way that tells her that he wants to help, May sighs knowing what the look meant before she says "OK, go, but if I so much as see a mark on you, you are grounded until you're fifty" Peter nods as he promises to try and not get hurt, he puts on his suit and mask before he leaves through his bedroom window, he swings towards the bank as his aunt watches from his bedroom praying that he won't get hurt.</p><p>Peter takes ten minutes to get to the bank, he looks for a way inside, he finds one, a window left open in the roof. He climbs through the window and crawls towards where the robbers, hostages and the bomb are, he crawls across the ceiling to get a better look, he sees six of the suspects holding hostages while the other four must be grabbing the money so Peter decides to get after them first, he crawls across the roof to where the robbers are and he quickly silences them, takes their weapons away from them and ties them up using his web shooters.</p><p>Peter then crawls back to the main part of the bank where he ties up the rest of the bank robbers, he sees the bomb, the timer is less than a minutes left so he starts to take the bomb a part, he dismantles the bomb to reveal the wires. After a few seconds he cuts the wire that stops the count-down and he breathes a sigh of relief before he swings away not noticing Iron Man watching him as he swings away.</p><p>When he had gotten home Peter's aunt asks Peter to tell her everything about what he had done while he was out, Peter tells her everything making his Aunt proud but also nervous that Peter had put himself in great danger.</p><p>An hour later, after Peter had finished building his Lego Death Star a giant portal opens behind him, his vision goes black after he is sucked inside the portal.</p><hr/><p>James Barnes is with his best friend Steve Rogers AKA Captain America and the howling commandos are on a train which has the scientist Doctor Arnim Zola.

He hangs onto a piece of the train as his best friend fights the HYDRA agent. After the agent had been knocked off the train he goes to the hole and yells out "Bucky" as he sees James hanging onto a piece of the train, he starts to climb towards James and he says "hang on" he then says after getting at close as possible while holding out his hand "grab my hand!" James reaches for Steve's hand but can not reach it. Suddenly the railing that James had been hanging onto break making James fall, as he falls he screams.</p><p>His arm gets caught on something and his whole arm including his shoulder is ripped off as he falls but he doesn't land into the water below, no, a portal opens and he falls into it.

He then blacks out.</p><hr/><p>In the abandoned streets in the city of Atlanta, in front of a manor (AN: the manor in this story looks like the manor that the Baker Family live in from the 2003 movie Cheaper by the Dozen and it includes the hedge as well), four portals open next to each other, out of each of them a male falls, once they had exited the portals, the portals all close, the portal that had the Russian also had spit out a whole lot of weapons and a bag.
