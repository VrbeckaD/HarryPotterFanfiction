  <p>Y/N Avada-Salazar awoke the morning you was meant to catch the Hogwarts Express and begin truly learning magic with so much excitement, you felt your heart might burst.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Of course, joining the prestigious school as late as 5th year was unheard of, and you didn’t really know anyone in your year, but you was determined to succeed. Dumbledore had visited personally to observe you undergo the trials he had set to ensure it would be safe, and now you had passed nothing could get in your way.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It had been a complex process, you see, due to the fact that Y/N Elentiya Avada-Salazar was no ordinary witch. Not only were you the heir of two mighty wizard bloodlines, the French Avada who famously created the killing curse and the Salazars, relating you to one of the four founding members of Hogwarts, but magic seemed a second nature to you.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Your grandmother, Aelin Avada, claimed it was a direct result of such powerful bloodlines coming together, <em>(but said the girls looks were obviously from her side of the family - with the odd Veela ancestors)</em> and the ‘secret’ <em>disgusting</em> blends of broth-like meals she fed you religiously, which you only choked down out of love. And the fact her grandmother was her last living relative.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The truth was, only Dumbledore and Aelin knew of the extraordinary gifts, or perhaps curse, you possessed. Curse, perhaps, as both your parents had tragically died the stormy April night you was born, along with everyone else in the room. Classic wizard stuff. But as the deaths were never explained and all that was left of the room was the new borne baby, you were almost as revered by the wizarding world as the boy who lived; though obviously better liked by the pure bloods. You knew you were lucky Aelin hadn’t been there, and that Aelin knew of Dumbledore so well.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>When the grieving grandmother found the child aged 6 levitating flowers, singing melodic tunes that put enchanted animals to sleep and hiding a pet snake (pronounced <em>‘rake’</em> by little Y/N by the time), she had realised just how special you may truly be, using magic so early, and had called Dumbledore right away. Luckily they were already friends, but to this day you did not know how it came to be.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore had then become another presence in your life, as he advised your grandmother on what to do, how to help you, and learnt to encourage you to try new skills to keep you constantly improving. Despite your relation to the infamous dark wizard Tom Riddle with the Salazar blood, Albus had known upon meeting you that there was nothing you had in common with your relative, other than unexplained power.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>To nurture you, he had arranged for private tutors, a private quidditch instructor, a martial arts teacher (you loved Karate Kid from her muggle studies) and regular carefully planned outings into the wizarding and muggle communities around the world. However, as grateful as you were for the expensive education, you still felt incredibly <em>lonely</em> by age 11, when you discovered, in fits of tears, that Albus did not think you were ready to enrol at Hogwarts. All your life you had only ever known grandmother and Albus, and you was desperate to befriend people your own age. You were jealous of the muggles you had glimpsed on outings with Dumbledore, chatting in large groups and laughing with friends, and you were not desperate enough to refer to the snakes she talked to as friends. <em>Yet.</em> They <b>were</b> just snakes after all.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>So despite being able to apparate by the time you were nine, cast a patronus<em> (Chinese Fireball Dragon)</em> by 12 and at 15 technically finished the 7th year curriculum and qualified in all but age to be a St Mungo’s healer (Dumbledore let you sit the test, interview and training sessions but made you decline the job), you would only be joining Hogwarts now, in time for your OWLs.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>You knew Dumbledore wanted you, and everyone around you to be safe, but you couldn’t help but feel a bitter twinge of sadness for all the experiences you felt you had missed out on. For a start, you had heard of all the adventures Harry Potter and his friends a year older than you had got up to, and was convinced had you been there Voldemort would be a forgotten myth by now. But at least you knew how to fully control your magic now. If you did enough each day, snakes were not drawn to you like a magnet, and the air around you and objects you touched no longer turned gold (Aelin also claimed this was a trait from her family - strangely neither Albus nor you believed her).</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was finally time.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>And as you darted out of the large, beautiful but lonely mansion that had felt so much like an ornate prison for so many years, you couldn’t help but feel as if the sun where shining just for you as you finally headed to Hogwarts.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>

</div><div>
  <p>Standing at Platform 9 and 3/4 next to your grandmother, you felt the first wave of panic hit you as you realised you had no idea what to do. All your luggage was with them (Aelin insisted on making you levitating it, saying the ground would damage the expensive dragon leathers), your new barn owl Balthazar hooted animatedly from your shoulder to the other owls student lugged around in cages (you couldn’t work out why, where the other owls not tame?), and you was dressed in your favourite muggle designers - Gucci ‘dad’ trainers, your favourite denim skirt and an oversized Tommy Hilfigurer jumper.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Despite the common pureblood stereotypes, Aelin had drilled into your head from a young age that muggles were in no way inferior to wizards - after learning about Shakespeare, Rosa Parks and listening to Harry Styles sing, you couldn’t help but agree.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Y/N <em>ma cherie,</em> ze train must depart soon. I will post anything you may think you have forgotten, and for Merlin’s sake stop looking so nervous, you are an Avada!”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>You stopped biting your lip and fiddling with your skirt to look at grandmother, and only friend for many years, with a sadness you knew was visible in your eyes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“With you be okay alone at the Manor grand-mere? I know you will have the elves with you, and Albus promised to visit but I still worry about you so… who will pick the aluna berries for your arthritis? Perhaps this isn’t a good idea…”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Aelin gazed sternly at her granddaughter, and muttered in French before pulling you into a stiff but well meaning hug.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“<em>Darling</em>, I hope you learn to word your arguments better in class, otherwise ze professors will be far from impressed. Say <em>salut</em> to Flitwick for me. It is time, remember your teachings, and never forget who you are.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The train whistle screamed loudly behind you as you took one last glance at her grandmother, missing the regret twisting her regal features as you hurried to board the Hogwarts Express.</p>
