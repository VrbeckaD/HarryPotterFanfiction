    <p>It was supposed to be an accident at first. And like every other thing in his life, it spiraled out of control faster than his eyes could catch. He tugs at his sleeves; the cuff of fabric went beyond his knuckles.</p><p>
“You’ll grow into it,” his aunt had said as she dropped the bundle of identical clothing on the floor of the home they shared.</p><p>
Harry remembered the thick scent of smoke in the air. He remembered thinking to himself that he would’ve believed his aunt’s words if only she bothered to stock their kitchen in the first place. The teen hummed, tugging at his dark locks.</p><p>
He couldn’t even cook if there wasn’t anything to.</p><p>
Petunia Evans left the crowded living area with open curses as she tripped over the stack of gossip magazines by the patched sofa. A cockroach came skittering about. Neither aunt nor nephew would bother to take its life as it ran like they would.</p><p>
A rumble of hunger makes its way into the depths of his stomach. Harry would tell the average concerned stranger that he’d already ate and his appetite was simply being a tad dramatic.</p><p>
‘Liar,’ he’d hear himself think right after, ‘but I ate already. At 5am. Aunt Petunia shouldn’t be able to find the bag underneath the bed would she? I’ve already switched it from the wardrobe though… it was so hard buying those crackers without her knowing.</p><p>
The floorboards are getting rotten. I’ll need to switch them out soon.</p><p>
I’m hungry. So hungry.’</p><p>
The library door closes, the knob turns with a soft click. Harry lifts his head from where it was buried between his knobby knees. He was going on part-time but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the hours feel any less tedious.</p><p>
Before the counter he sat behind was a man. He looked young, probably a senior student. Harry notices how he fidgets like cola that was about ready to pop from its can. “How may I help you?” he inquires softly.</p><p>
“Do you have books on demonology? It’s for research purposes. I know it’s before hols but I promise to bring back whenever.”</p><p>
“Yeah, we do have books on those but I can’t just-“</p><p>
“I’ll only need those books for a few days. You have to let me borrow them. it’s only for a bit and it’s already dark out and my project is due real soon.”</p><p>
Harry would’ve raised a suspicious brow if he could, but he hasn’t looked into that skill yet. Plus, the guy escalated awfully quick from inquiring about demonology to being absolutely sure that he had to bring whatever back to wherever with him.</p><p>
The bespectacled teen smiles, it was a crooked thing.</p><p>
“I’m sorry. But as I’ve said, I can’t just lend out whatever. Not my place, no hard feelings mate. And whatever schmick you might have to look up on? It has to be within these walls. Tell you what, I’ll close up later than usual yeah? Take your time with whatever research you’ve gotta do.”</p><p>
“Sure,” the might-be senior mumbles. He adjusts his sling bag over his shoulder and heads towards the shelf just after the washroom.</p><p>
Research purposes huh.</p><p>
Makes you wonder.</p><p>
Harry is hungry for food, but home always has him hunger for something else. Either way, he doesn’t mind waiting for a bit before returning. Aunt Tuney wouldn’t notice anyway. Fridays are pre-weekends. The woman will be out until after 3 at the very least.</p><p>
Tugging at his sleeves once more, Harry scoffs. So much for all that ‘what would the neighbours think’ rubbish she goes on about still. Having that divorce with Uncle Vernon was the next best thing Harry could’ve asked for after Dudley’s death. But the way Aunt Petunia was dealing with her loss?</p><p>
It wouldn’t take the freak of the two to notice that the neighbours have long accepted his aunt as one of the crowd that they tell their kids to never grow up into.</p><p>
In Harry’s book, it went under the category of freak too.</p><p>
Two freaks under the same roof. One in reluctant acceptance and the other in denial. What could <i>possibly</i> go wrong?</p><p>
Harry’s eyes trail after the non-existent silhouette of the senior that has long disappeared among the forest of shelves. Something wasn’t right with the lad. He seemed twitchy somehow; and Harry would be the world’s greatest busybody if it meant to stave off the nagging tug of hunger at his gut.</p><p>
Demonology reminded him of a school that was never meant to be his. It scrapes at the bottom of his mind like the hard-to-remove stains of bacon scraps he used to accidentally burn till it stuck at the bottom of the frying pan when he’d learnt to cook ever since he could.</p><p>
‘Freak!’ Oh, the memory was as clear as day. ‘That letter does not belong to you! Give it back, boy. Before I teach you a what it means to be grateful we ever took you in!’</p><p>
Uncle Vernon's face had been a splotchy purple. It matched the bruise Harry sported on both arms after serving 2 slices of toast instead of 3. The memory ripples.</p><p>
The 11 year old boy had trembled. His eyes lowering as his hand gripped tightly at the strange letter. His meek postured fooled none of his relatives (or maybe they just didn’t care). Harry had managed a glance at the contents already anyway.</p><p>
There was a meaty hand that shoved him near the fireplace. A glint came about his uncle’s eyes. It disappeared just as quickly.</p><p>
<em>‘Give me the letter, freak.’</em></p><p>
Hogwarts, he vaguely recalled. It was a school for the… magically gifted?</p><p>
Harry doesn’t bother. He rocks at the office chair where he sat. Curled up as his palms supports his chin. Freaks, they all were. That’s what Aunt Petunia had mumbled underneath her thin lips, and it wasn’t the most reliable source of intelligence or unbiased perspective. But they’d made him write back- declining acceptance into whatever sorcery of a school it was.</p><p>
Pretty smart, considering how Harry managed to convince his relative’s spawn that one time that swimming was for ‘pansies’ when they were relatively alone at the pool; before Dudley’s parents came around with only one ice-cream in hand. Dudley kicked up a fuss because it wasn't double-scooped or chocolate. Even after all that ridiculous nonsense, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Tuney made sure to ask only dear duddykins if he wanted to learn how to swim.</p><p>
Dudley said no, with the confidence equivalent to that of a scientist that rediscovered Einstein’s long lost theory about electrons and whatnot.</p><p>
No one had seen Harry’s smile as he somehow managed to pay a dollar for a kid to accidently ‘trip’ and knock Dudley into the adult’s pool.
Good times.</p><p>
The green-eyed teen hoped whatever that senior was researching for, he doesn’t kick up a fuss from it. Harry was too hungry and too tired for that shit. Demons exist, they have to, Harry believes. Because people like his uncle and aunt exist too. Strangely enough, Dudley doesn't belong on that list. Blame the parents for raising such scum. Harry still hates, though. Dudley dying is a blessing, no doubt. Yet Harry doesn't consider Dudley as a contribution to his belief as to 'why Demons should exist.'</p><p>
Something tugs at the back of Harry’s mind. It slithers by with a hiss.</p><p>
The supernatural, unnatural. Demons, angels. Magic.</p><p>
<em>Freaks.</em></p><p>
Hogwarts.</p><p>
<em>Freaks.</em></p><p>
‘None of that in my house, boy.’</p><p>
‘Yes, uncle Vernon.’</p>
