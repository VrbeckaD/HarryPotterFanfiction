          <div class="userstuff"><p>Three months. Two days.</p><p>I don’t know how many hours. You know, I’ve lost my sense of time.</p><p>I just know too much has passed, or perhaps too little.</p><p>And you’re not here.</p><p>The first days have been the worst. I expected to see you coming in from the living room’s door, with that bored face of yours, complaining about segregation as usual.</p><p>And I’ve waited for you, for a while. With a book in my hands, massaging my temples, searching the concentration necessary to read, never finding it.</p><p>Throwing continuous gazes to that door, which frame has stayed empty. Until I had to give in to the obvious.</p><p>You weren’t going to come. Not that day, nor the next one, nor the following. And I had to give up and accept that what I had seen at the Ministry was horribly real.</p><p>That you had actually fallen behind that veil, that it wasn’t a trick of my mind. That you had left me alone.</p><p>And yet, even though I surrendered, I keep staying here, motionless, waiting for someone that will never come.</p><p>I pass a finger distractedly over the cigarette burn on the couch’s upholstery.</p><p><em>Silk burns too easily, </em>I remember these were your words when you had let the stub fall off your hand.</p><p>And I remember I also got mad for your negligence, while now I’m glad for that single burn. It’s a sign of your presence in this house, a sign that you’ve lived here, even hating every second of it.</p><p>Silk burns too easily, it’s true. I smile for that useless comment of yours, that now comes violently back to my mind, without leaving me be. I breathe deeply the air, still slightly foul with the smell of smoke.</p><p>Since you haven’t come back home, it has happened often for me to light up cigarettes and let them burn, consuming them, to save that smell.</p><p>It still bothers me, but the acridity they release tastes of you.</p><p>It tastes of your sleepless nights, it tastes of your moments of irritability and of those of melancholy.</p><p>It tastes of moments spent together, in the endless nights in this curse house, which nonetheless for a while has been <em>ours. </em></p><p>I take the package left abandoned on the desk. There’s only one left. I sigh and hesitate, then I turn it on.</p><p>I keep it in my hands, watching it as if it had a sort of magic that I can’t completely understand.</p><p>I feel an emptiness inside of me, Sirius, an emptiness that burns just life this cigarette.</p><p>And I let my mind wander, I close my eyes and I see you, I breathe in the sharp smoke resisting the instinct of coughing and I imagine you keeping it in your hand and smoking it, till the end.</p><p>I fight to hold back the tears, because I really can’t cry anymore.</p><p>You’d be laughing about me if you were here, I know it.</p><p>But <em>you’re not</em>, so in the end what does it matter?</p><p>I open my eyes again, staring at the circular, ephemeral traces of smoking spreading through the air.</p><p>I’m tired, Sirius.</p><p>I’d like to lie down, closing my eyes without knowing I have to open them again, sooner or later.</p><p>I dream of getting to bed without wanting to. Like when you were still here, like when I did battle with sleep, because sleeping meant closing my eyes and missing the chance to see you until the next morning.</p><p>I dream all of this, I desire it, and I know that none of these cravings of mine will ever be satisfied anymore.</p><p>Because you’re not here, Sirius. Death has consumed you, like oxygen is consuming the cigarette in between my fingers.</p><p>The last one.</p><p>Biting my lip, I bring my hand closer to the upholstery.</p><p>
  <em>Silk burns too easily. </em>
</p><p>And I must say you’re right, for once. Not even the time to get the stub close and I already see a tear in the fabric. Next to the one you made, to keep it a little company.</p><p>My fingers start to feel the warmth. They burn.</p><p>Like the emptiness inside my heart.</p><p>I crush it in the ashtray, violently, trying with it to crush the memory of you as well.</p><p>I’m tired, Sirius. So damn tired.</p><p>We’re out of cigarettes, and now I know you won’t come back.</p><p>I’d like to go to bed now, because I still want to do it. Because I’d like to close my eyes over this suffocating emptiness.</p><p>I’d love to close my eyes over you. But <em>you’re not here. </em></p><p>The last cigarette is consumed. And perhaps is a sign I should move on.</p><p>My fingers go back brushing the burns on the couch, two of them now.</p><p>Because silk burn too easily, Sirius. Just like me.</p><p>I close my eyes, I can’t keep them open anymore.</p><p>I fall asleep with the taste of you floating in the air, for one last time.</p><p>Farewell, Sirius.</p></div>
