              <p>
  <i>That night, Draco took out all the paper cranes in the drawer. He touched each and every one of them, caressed their wings, tapped on their heads; under the dim lamps, they seemed to glow in a halo. He remembered the way Harry hunched around the paper, eyes focused as his glasses slid slightly down his nose, his messy mop of hair blocking his fringe. He remembered Harry’s satisfying grin as he finished one, always admiring his own work for a few seconds before he touched it again. He could hear his own pounding heart as he feigned nonchalance when Harry first gave him one, Harry’s shrug and small smile, Draco’s hurriedly averted gaze and careful hold of the crane. He remembered Harry giving him a second, a third, a fourth.</i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>He went to bed with his heart thumping in his chest, feeling more alive than he’d ever been.</i>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>He was going to do it.</i>

          <div class="userstuff"><p>He didn’t notice it at first.<br/>
<br/>
It was a small thing. Subtle and faint, pulsing through his veins every time he saw Potter: a quick glance whenever Potter entered the room, a silent acknowledgement, a quiet obligation to sit a little straighter, to set his chin a little higher, to move a little closer. Not that he ever listened to it. It had always been easy to silent the voice inside his head, and even more so after the war.<br/>
<br/>
Draco had thought it was gratitude. For saving him twice during the final battle, and later the testimony that got him out of Azkaban; there was something Draco couldn’t quite grasp between the tenacious words echoing by his ears with near friendliness for the whole summer, like a stranger, insisting he didn’t deserve the punishment he deserved. Or maybe it was curiosity. For seeing Potter as someone more than a scrawny boy with stupid glasses for the first time, for not being an enemy of his for the first time, for catching his surprisingly warm smile for the first time, even though it was not directed to him.<br/>
<br/>
Draco wondered why he’d never seen that smile before.<br/>
<br/>
The history between them lay dusted, untouched. They were on nothing more than neutral ground, nothing more than strangers besides, of course, the life debt he owed Potter. No smiles exchanged, no nods of acknowledgement, no redeemed handshake, so maybe that was why Draco missed his heart fluttering when Potter caught his eyes unexpectedly, the smile for his friends still lingering. He whipped his head away and stared at his mashed potatoes like it had personally offended him. That night in bed the smile returned, only this time it was directed to Draco, the warmth soft like layered blankets, like bathing in the late summer sun in the middle of a sea of swaying wheat.<br/>
<br/>
Draco forgot it when he woke up the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t catch his gaze on Potter lingering into two seconds, three, four, every time he entered the room. He didn’t catch himself fidgeting with an intangible urge to move closer. He did catch his thoughts wandering places, though, when he snapped back in the middle of potions class from messy raven hair, worn frames of round glasses, and green eyes like foliage with flickering sunlight. He caught his heart skipping a beat, his cheeks a little warmer than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Once he caught it, there was no going back.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn’t help but sneak looks at Potter, everywhere. Potter caught him a few times, curiosity hinted in his tilted head. Draco cursed his pale skin and rosy cheeks as he glared at whatever was in front of him like it had personally offended him, cursed the sudden tug in his chest and his quickening heartbeat, cursed as he swore not to do it anymore and as he did it again.<br/>
<br/>
Fire danced in front of his eyes, and as a moth he couldn’t help but lean closer.<br/>
<br/>
Draco buried his head behind the mashed potatoes. Potter had caught his eyes earlier and he could feel his gaze on him, a phantom weight heavier than anything else. Draco stabbed the potatoes with his fork.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s you who’s about to eat the potatoes, not the other way around, Malfoy.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco looked up. Potter stood in front of him with a hint of amusement in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
It was so unfamiliar it was unsettling.<br/>
<br/>
“Potter,” Draco said. Suddenly he hated his posh accent.<br/>
<br/>
Potter nodded and invited himself to sit down across from Draco, despite that it was the Slytherin table and not even Draco’s own housemates wanted to sit with him. People started to talk, not bothering to hide their stares. Draco suppressed the urge to fidget.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey,” Harry called. Draco looked up from the potatoes again. Harry tilted his head. “Care to explain why you’re killing potatoes with your glare?”<br/>
<br/>
And then they were walking to classrooms as they make awkward small talks, sitting on the same couch in the eighth-year common room (the one in front of the fireplace), studying in the library though Harry always ended up folding paper cranes from parchments, wandering in the castle late at night when words weren’t needed and company was enough. Potter became Harry and Malfoy became Draco; every time they called each other by given names Draco’s heart sped up a little.<br/>
<br/>
He was pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
A pile of paper cranes bundled up in a corner on his desk. Harry always gave him the ones he folded when they ended their study sessions. Draco knew Harry only did it because he was too lazy to keep them, but still he kept each and every one, not even bothering to convince himself he’d throw them away later. A lie, anyway. There was already no hope for him, might as well cling onto anything he could grasp.<br/>
<br/>
That was what he told himself, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Also a lie.<br/>
<br/>
He’d heard voices when he grabbed the doorknob to Harry’s dorm. He just didn’t think much of it. The delusions of his relationship with Harry had dulled him. Harry and Ginevra had broken up and gossip had boiled Hogwarts for nearly a month, and even though Harry didn’t talk much of it, Draco knew it wasn’t a clean cut. It still hurt when he pushed the door open and saw them kissing, though, Harry clinging onto Ginevra like a lifeline.<br/>
<br/>
It hurt like hell.<br/>
<br/>
That night, he stayed in bed. He usually went down to the common room and sat at the couch by the fireplace—their couch—but instead he lied on his back, under the covers, the dorm room quiet all by himself. He thought of Harry’s bronze skin, his green eyes molding into pools when the sun hits just right. He thought of the way Harry walked, always a little jumpy as if his thin body and knobby knees couldn’t contain all the life in him, the frown between Harry’s brows when he wanted to argue about something Draco said, and his gaze across the midnight lake, pensive and solemn and suddenly he was miles away, somewhere Draco understood but couldn’t reach. He thought of Harry’s smiles that came to beam for him, the way he grinned like late summer sunshine in a swaying wheat field, warmth spreading across his own chest and he couldn’t help but smile, too. Harry’s laughter rang in his ears, bright and brisk, sunlight crackling air, tangible in his hands. He thought of Harry, like all the nights he did before.<br/>
<br/>
He cried.<br/>
<br/>
It was darkness and fire all at once. How foolish of him to think he’d be unharmed if he convinced himself not to hope. Fire burned in his wings, in his body, and he embraced the flames even though he didn’t choose to because it was too late already. How could he have thought that he’d be able to back out?<br/>
<br/>
The next morning when he woke up, the sun had already risen. Streaks of gold illuminated his bed from where it streamed through the windows, pass the drapes, like countless other mornings.<br/>
<br/>
It was almost like nothing happened. He walked to classes with Harry, carefully keeping his distance so their hands didn’t brush. He threw the paper cranes into the drawer where he now kept them. He subtly scooted over when Harry tried to bury his feet under Draco’s thighs on the couch, like all the other times he did before. He waited for news of Harry and Ginevra getting back together to break out, though it never happened and Harry never brought it up.<br/>
<br/>
He waited nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
June, and he prepared himself to say goodbye. The once blazing fire now dulled into a low roar, a constant rumble in his veins that had become a part of him. Give it a few years, and he’d get used to not having Harry in his life anymore. He might even get over him. Eighth year was borrowed time, anyways. He just didn’t realize it at the beginning. At some moment he had hoped that it could become more than that, but it was a dream wrapped in a bubble, foolish and fragile.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn’t live in denial anymore.<br/>
<br/>
He allowed himself to look at Harry for as long as he wanted to on the train. They sat across from each other in the compartment, and Harry propped his chin on his hand and looked outside the window. Ghosts of the flying scenery reflected on his face like a painting, and Draco traced Harry’s unruly hair, his eyelashes, his lips, his neck. Branding it into his memory so he could remember him as clearly as he could for a minute longer in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Harry caught his eyes and smiled.<br/>
<br/>
They hugged at King Cross. Harry was small and thin, his chin resting on Draco’s shoulder. His arms wrapped tightly around Draco, pressing him into his body, and Draco wanted to brand this moment into memory, too. They parted with a promise to owl.<br/>
<br/>
Draco turned away before he could watch Harry leave.<br/>
<br/>
He found work at a potions workshop, a small place with only three people. He buried himself in potions and wrapped his head around work so nothing else could get in. He found a tiny flat somewhere not far away from the ocean, and slowly he settled. Books lined up on shelves and tea stood next to each other in the cabinet, chocolate biscuits in a jar beside. Ivy climbed onto the beige walls outside, a corner of green. He liked how it looked.<br/>
<br/>
Then Harry owled.<br/>
<br/>
Draco held the letter in his hands, touch feathery light. He had become so familiar with the messy scrawl that spread across the parchment that even though it had been months he still recognized it in seconds, like coming back home. He remembered the midnight blue ink on Harry’s fingertips every time he used a quill, sometimes smearing a trace on his cheek. He remembered Harry folding paper cranes in the library, concentration in his eyes the way it never did when he studied.<br/>
<br/>
The paper cranes still sat in a drawer in his room.<br/>
<br/>
Harry asked if he had time for cuppa, or maybe a pint. Draco considered it, but it wasn’t like he had any choice, really.<br/>
<br/>
The pub was a cozy place with buttery walls and wooden floors. Harry hadn’t changed much; still the messy hair and round frame glasses, his green eyes as warm as his smile. Draco hadn’t realized how much he’d missed him. His bright laughter echoed inside Draco, and it woke something dusted yet familiar, something he’d slowly sealed. Now it vibrated through his body, pulsing through his veins, like croaked land awakening under the first rain after a season of drought, like living again.<br/>
<br/>
Harry asked if Draco wanted to change his job to the ministry, where Harry worked. They were looking for people. Draco thought about it. He liked where he worked, though, the two other people who felt like friends, the small place, the way potions always felt dear to him instead of a job.<br/>
<br/>
Harry nodded.<br/>
<br/>
They met up, every now and then, for tea, for a drink, for a walk. Harry’s flat was wooden and messy, and slowly Draco started to find the tea he liked in the kitchen, chocolate biscuits the same brand he always bought, a couple potted plants he’d suggested Harry get in off-handed comments. He left some books and never thought to get them back. They piled up on the small table beside Harry’s couch.<br/>
<br/>
Their fingers brushed when they walked, and Harry’s knee always prodded against Draco’s in pubs. For a split-second Draco thought about Ginevra but he let it go. News never broke out; maybe it wasn’t that important anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
He remembered the casual touches feeling like fire, from a time not so long ago yet already felt like another lifetime, first ignited sparkles then burns that made him flinch. Sometimes they still felt like that. On some nights he lied on his back under the covers, and he thought of Harry’s sun-kissed skin, his soft, wild hair, the curve of his mouth. He didn’t think about him as often now, but the fire was still there in his chest, a dull roar that rumbled through his veins, as subtle and natural as breathing. On the nights he felt daring enough, he imagined Harry’s lips on his own, his calloused fingers on his neck, imagined hot breathes mingled together. He’d close his eyes and trace his own lips, and if he tried hard enough it would be Harry tracing them, tender and careful, his laughter echoing low against his mouth like hidden sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
He made himself forget when he woke up.<br/>
<br/>
The pub had more people than usual tonight. Dim lights hung from wooden beams, faint shadows swaying on the buttery walls; Harry tore a beer mat into a square and folded it into a crane. Draco watched as Harry not-so-precisely pressed paper against thin lines and pulled and flattened, trying to decipher the steps, and then a bird was in Harry’s hands. Harry smiled at him like a secret and murmured a spell. The bird flapped its wings and landed on Draco’s palms.<br/>
<br/>
“Make one for me,” Harry said.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know how to fold one.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Great Draco Malfoy doesn’t know how to fold a paper crane?” Harry gaped. Draco smacked him in the head, and Harry laughed. “Seriously, you’ve seen me fold enough times. It should be easy for you. I can teach you.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco shook his head, but later that night, he took out one of the paper cranes Harry gave him in eighth year and opened it. Faint lines crisscrossed the parchment like a constellation he didn’t know how to read. He waved his wand, and the paper folded itself back into a bird. He flattened it again and, one step at a time, he flicked his wand as he pressed and pulled the paper, slowly memorizing the constellation. When he finally finished, he found a piece of parchment with flowery patterns and carefully folded it into a crane.<br/>
<br/>
Two paper cranes sat together, their wings touching and heads resting atop one another.<br/>
<br/>
Draco averted his gaze. He really was going mad if he started to get sentimental over two pieces of paper.<br/>
<br/>
He gave it to Harry. Harry stared at it for so long Draco seriously considered taking it back and obliviating him, but then Harry touched it gently with his fingers and looked up to Draco. “You actually folded one.”<br/>
<br/>
“I thought you wanted me to.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since when do you listen to what others want you to do?” Harry held the delicate crane between his fingertips, touch almost ginger. Since you, Draco thought, but said nothing. “I was half-joking. Why didn’t you let me teach you, then? If you wanted to learn? Wait, where did you learn this?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco smiled at the bombarding questions. He wanted to kiss them away. He caught himself in the middle of the thought and startled.<br/>
<br/>
And there was no going back. The thoughts blossomed furiously in his mind despite his desperation to suppress them. He wanted to slide his hand into Harry’s every time their fingers brushed and he had to look away. He wanted to run his fingers through Harry’s hair, twirl and stroke the soft curls, wanted to trace his brows and eyelids, his nose, his jaw, wanted to caress the soft skin at his neck. He wanted to press his lips to Harry’s and taste them, nibble the softness, exchange hot, damp breaths.<br/>
<br/>
God, he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
And Harry, Harry just smiled infuriatingly at him, which didn’t help in the slightest. The kind that he sent when he thought Draco wasn’t looking, small, barely-there curls of lips that softens his features and makes Draco’s guts churn. He didn’t know whether he should distinguish the fluttering hope in his chest. It felt so ancient, something that hadn’t existed for such a long time that he almost forgot what it felt like, how dangerous it was. Except that it didn’t feel dangerous anymore. It felt like hovering above the alluring fire, one inch apart from the beautiful agony.<br/>
<br/>
If he were to fall, he would brace the flames. He was burnt inside out already, anyways.<br/>
<br/>
“How’s Ginevra?” Draco asked, his fingers digging into the cushion he hugged in his arms. Harry’s cushion; surprisingly dark inky green, and softer than anything else. It was his favorite at Harry’s flat.<br/>
<br/>
He wondered since when Harry’s flat had started to feel like another home.<br/>
<br/>
“She’s alright.” Harry shrugged as he sipped his tea. He looked at Draco curiously from the rim of his mug. Or maybe not so curious, after all. “Why?”<br/>
<br/>
“Nothing.” Draco looked away. He was tempted to leave it like this, but he forced the rest of the words out. “I’ve always thought the two of you would end up together.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry stilled.<br/>
<br/>
“I thought so, too, for a while,” he said after a moment. He stirred his tea and looked up to Draco with a small smile. “But things don’t always work out the way we expect them to be.”<br/>
<br/>
“That had to be the most intelligent thing you’ve said in your whole life.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve said a lot of intelligent things in my life.” Harry drew one knee up. “But yeah. Things were a little messy after Gin and I broke up, but we stayed friends. Lucky to have that.”<br/>
<br/>
Damn, when Harry sat like that. Draco wanted to kiss him silly. He tamed the low roar in his veins until it subsided, and then he sipped his tea. His eyes caught the flowery paper crane on the windowsill beside the potted plants, sitting delicately in the golden patch of sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
He wondered if it could mean anything.<br/>
<br/>
That night, Draco took out all the paper cranes in the drawer. He touched each and every one of them, caressed their wings, tapped on their heads; under the dim lamps, they seemed to glow in a halo. He remembered the way Harry hunched around the paper, eyes focused as his glasses slid slightly down his nose, his messy mop of hair blocking his fringe. He remembered Harry’s satisfying grin as he finished one, always admiring his own work for a few seconds before he touched it again. He could hear his own pounding heart as he feigned nonchalance when Harry first gave him one, Harry’s shrug and small smile, Draco’s hurriedly averted gaze and careful hold of the crane. He remembered Harry giving him a second, a third, a fourth.<br/>
<br/>
He went to bed with his heart thumping in his chest, feeling more alive than he’d ever been.<br/>
<br/>
He was going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
He stood across from Harry’s flat the next day, waiting for the flow of muggle cars to pass. Harry opened the door, and his face lit up when he saw Draco. Draco smiled back, his heart leaping in his chest. He realized a second too late that Harry was walking towards him without turning his head.<br/>
<br/>
He was a second too late.<br/>
<br/>
There were screams. Everywhere, the world shutting down into deafening silence. His fingers trembled, Harry’s lifeless green eyes staring back at him. Blood on his hands, smearing fresh red stains onto Harry’s face. Harry’s blood.<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t realize he was screaming, crying, begging for Harry to wake up. Someone tried to pull him away, and the next thing he knew he was sitting in the waiting hall at St. Mungo’s, where Harry got transferred. The chairs were sickly mint green, the walls pale, dull grey. He stared hollowly ahead. Blood dried on his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Too much blood loss.<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn’t let him see Harry. Still unstable, the trembling healer said. Draco slacked back into the mint green chair. The shadows on the walls shifted, and the room darkened. He stared ahead, an aching cavern drilling in his chest.<br/>
<br/>
It was all his fault.<br/>
<br/>
Granger came. And Weasley, too. Granger squeezed him like she was going to break apart, her bushy hair stinging his eyes, and he couldn’t find the strength to hug her back. They came and left, bringing hot tea with worried eyes. Draco couldn’t tell day from night.<br/>
<br/>
He was wobbly when they finally allowed him in Harry’s room. Harry lay under white sheets that were too crisp and too tidy, his chest heaving so faintly it was almost still, his bronze skin pale. His glasses lay broken on the short drawer beside.<br/>
<br/>
“Harry,” Draco croaked. The name split his chapped lips and he choked back a sob. <i>Don’t cry in front of him,</i> the healer had said. <i>Talk to him like you would normally. He can hear you.</i><br/>
<br/>
“You should hold his hand,” Granger said when she and Weasley came. She sat by Harry’s bedside with Draco as she squeezed his shoulder, smiling sadly at him. “It’s supposed to help, you know.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco stared at her, his mind blank.<br/>
<br/>
“You can kiss him, too. If you want to.” Weasley glanced at his own feet. “I think he’d prefer to remember his first kiss, though.”<br/>
<br/>
Granger launched into a story about Cho and wet mouths and teaspoons. Weasley laughed, patting Granger’s back when she wiped tears with the heel of her hand as she chuckled, sometimes including Harry in the conversation, looking at him when he was addressed. Draco sat beside them, the room turning into a background of white noises.<br/>
<br/>
<i>You can kiss him, too. If you want to.</i><br/>
<br/>
Fire seared in his veins. Pain burst and spread like poison, smoke swirling in his lungs, suffocating him with regret. He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. He thought he might do both.<br/>
<br/>
If only he’d told Harry earlier. If only he’d made his mind up earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Harry won’t…<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t kiss him, in the end. He held Harry’s hand, sometimes carded his hair back even though it seemed just as stubborn as when he was awake. Harry’s hand was rough and soft, solid in his slender fingers. Draco stroked the back of his hand, traced his palm, sometimes slid his fingers along Harry’s upper arm. He pressed their palms together, twining his fingers through Harry’s.<br/>
<br/>
He held Harry’s hand, even though Harry didn’t hold back.<br/>
<br/>
He only left the hospital when visitor hours were over, and then he’d slip back. He slept by Harry’s bed, arms curled on the too-tidy sheets. He didn’t start talking to Harry until after the first week. The silence was suffocating, the unanswered words heavy in the air, but eventually he started telling Harry about the manor, about the deserts his mother would have the house-elves make, about the corners he’d found for himself in Hogwarts. He told him about the garden that never withered, the vines ever-green; the boundless sky above the grounds, the chilly wind biting his cheeks as he soared through the air, where freedom immersed him, tangible and wild. The trifles served with layers of thin cake, sweet berries, custard, and cream, the puddings filled with silky chocolate, the creamy custard tarts wafted in with a trace of lemon. The farthest back aisle in the library, sunshine streaming in between wooden shelves and old parchments, where he could daydream without anyone catching him; the astronomy tower where he’d go before sixth year, the tallest place on the world, the castle ground stretching back into rolling hills; a corner by the lake shed by willows, where the ground was always dry and he’d sneak out at night to watch the stars.<br/>
<br/>
“Snowdonia is a great place to watch the stars.” Draco brushed Harry’s hair back. It bounced back, so he did it again. “We…we should go some day.”<br/>
<br/>
He was careful not to touch any promises, though at times like these he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t know which he dreaded more, the dream or the reality.<br/>
<br/>
It became routine. Hold Harry’s hand, tell him about anything on his mind, or sometimes just watch him when quietness felt enough. Harry’s hair covered his forehead and fell in front of his eyes in wavy curls, his eyes closed and chest heaving; looking at him without his glasses felt like unexpected openness, something fascinating. When sunlight streamed in and covered Harry in golden patches, it almost felt like Harry was sleeping, in the middle of dreamless peace, and he’d wake up at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope, Draco felt as it fluttered in his chest, was a dangerous thing.<br/>
<br/>
So when Harry’s hand twitched in his in the middle of a childhood story, silence swallowed him. Disbelieve and wariness crashed onto him in waves, dragging him away from shore. He stared at Harry until fear seeped in and he started to think he’d imagined things.<br/>
<br/>
Then slowly, Harry blinked himself awake.<br/>
<br/>
Lively green eyes, though tired, looked back at him behind heavy lids. Draco’s vision blurred.<br/>
<br/>
“Harry,” he croaked.<br/>
<br/>
Harry smiled faintly. “Hey.”<br/>
<br/>
His voice was weak and hoarse, yet Draco felt like collapsing, felt like crying, felt like crushing Harry in his arms and never letting go. He crushed Harry’s hand instead. He opened his mouth, yet no words came out, all emotions tangled and swirling and brimming, ineffable.<br/>
<br/>
Harry’s hand twitched again. “Come here.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco moved and gingerly sat on the bed right beside Harry. He touched Harry’s face with trembling hands, stroking his cheek. Harry closed his eyes and exhaled.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you tired?” Draco asked, voice low and shaking. He blinked until his vision cleared, but it blurred again in no time.<br/>
<br/>
“'m fine,” Harry mumbled. He snuggled closer to Draco and buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck. Draco took a sharp breath as warmth spread through his chest, soft and giddy.<br/>
<br/>
“You should sleep,” Draco whispered, despite the fear of losing Harry to the dark again, of Harry slipping away in his hands again. He buried his nose in Harry’s hair and squeezed his hand. Harry squeezed back faintly. “Until you feel better.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry murmured, voice already drifting away. “Want to stay here with you.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll be here.” He kissed the top of Harry’s head hesitantly, for reassurance, and when Harry hummed contently, he couldn’t stop pressing small kisses, again and again. “Sleep.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry hummed again. Soon, his breathing slowed, his shoulders rose and fell steadily. Harry’s body pressed against his, warm and solid, his head a reassuring weight on his shoulder. Draco grabbed his hand and kissed him, again and again, his throat closing.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Thank you.</i><br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
It was the small things.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting by the sea shore near Draco’s flat, watching waves splash over the rocky edges again and again, seafoam breaking out like tiny white flowers, drifting back into the deep ocean blue. The concrete warm from the sun, the air tasting of salt; Harry’s hair wild in the wind, his glasses catching the reflection of lapping tides. Their fingers touched, like a silent promise, a reassurance that they were there, right beside each other.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, quietness was more than enough.<br/>
<br/>
They shared their first kiss over the hospital bed. Tender and soft, Harry’s lips chapped against his; it was sunshine, running barefoot in a wild field and screaming in laughter, his mother’s custard tarts with a waft of lemon, sweet with so much want it aches. Harry’s breath was hot on his lips, pulse drumming where Draco cradled his neck, the liveliness crashing onto him in waves and leaving him shivering in behind. He’d nearly lost all this. Fire blazed in his chest, roaring in demand and pain, a need to claim, a cry to be reassured. He closed his mouth around Harry’s until he couldn’t feel his own lips, until the brushes of Harry’s fingers on his jaw numbed, until his lungs were about to explode and he couldn’t help but pull back. Harry’s hands were in his hair now, tight grip loosened, his eyes still closed in a daze. Their chests heaved, almost against each other, face still close that if Draco leaned in he could kiss Harry’s lips. Again.<br/>
<br/>
He had never seen green more vibrant than when Harry opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“I should have gotten into a car crash sooner,” Harry said, still slightly out of breath.<br/>
<br/>
Draco’s voice quivered. “Shut up.”<br/>
<br/>
“Okay, okay. Sorry.” Harry pulled him close and kissed him again. Softly, as if he was tending to wounds. Maybe he was. The fire quieted into a low glow, and for the first time the heat didn’t burn but warmed instead. Something in his chest stung as if thawing, something tender, at once foreign and familiar, like remembering an old song. It was at the tip of his tongue now. He didn’t realize his hands were trembling where he clutched Harry’s waist, as if he was afraid.<br/>
<br/>
It was twining his fingers through Harry’s and Harry holding back. Small smiles when Harry caught his eyes, the kind that softened his features and made Draco’s guts churn all those years ago. Burring his hands in Harry’s hair, the strands soft and wild between his fingers; kissing Harry everywhere he wanted to, golden skin underneath his lips, as if tasting sunshine. Harry’s feet pushed under his thigh on the couch, in front of the fireplace. Taking walks like they used to in the middle of the night at Hogwarts, chaste kisses here and there. Harry finding all the paper cranes in his drawer, his mouth open, his eyes deep and heated when he turned to look at Draco.<br/>
<br/>
“You kept all of them?”<br/>
<br/>
Draco had looked away, his hands clenching and unclenching. “It’s not like I folded them, is it?”<br/>
<br/>
They went to Snowdonia. Thousands of stars shone like broken diamonds in the dark sky, caught by the lake as if fallen, the whole galaxy unraveling around them as if they didn’t exist at all. Draco reached for Harry’s hand, lost in the dazzle. In the cold Harry grabbed back, his hand freezing yet solid, strong like an anchor. His green eyes shone in the dark like a galaxy of its own.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said.<br/>
<br/>
“You know who else is beautiful?” Draco asked.<br/>
<br/>
Harry laughed, bright like a thousand suns. It was the same one that stole his heart away, the same one he heard at night alone in his bed, yet it felt so different now. Draco couldn’t help but smiled. He didn’t need to see Harry clearly in the dark to know how beautiful he was. It pulsed through his veins and beat with his heart, a low hum, the warm halo of a steady fire.<br/>
<br/>
Above them, stars shone.</p></div>
