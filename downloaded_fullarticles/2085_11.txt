    <p>Living in every micro second at a time, is the only thing that distracts from the thoughts. The cool gray and the pitter-pat of the rain; the way the street lamps orange light reflects it's hope onto every drop of the Angel's tears. How the smoke of his cigarette twirls in sadness and delight, and the red from within eats it's way toward his finger. And the faint yet strong song coming from one of the young man's earbuds, demanding he acknowledges every note, yet seeps into the background with comfort. </p><p>Today it is Fur Elise, a masterpiece he's had his whole shortly lived, long life to memorize. He knows every key so well; as if its burned into his skull like the faces of the innocent with heavy souls. He knows this next chorus so well, he hadn't realised his muggle phone had dropped a minute before. </p><p>He cares not. Leaning a trembling bony finger up to his lips as he breathes in the nicotine. His lungs expand as if it's the first breath of fresh air he's had in years. The smoke passes through his throat, prickling uncomfortably, but he welcomes it. The taste lingers on his tongue as he lets the breath out. The smoke infects the air, disappearing from existence almost. </p><p>The thoughtful moment feels a minute yet an hour when he hears commotion echoing off the walls of the astronomy tower. He flicks the butt over the edge, watching it fall like an aspiring, sad, shooting star through the black night. It's past curfew, so he leans against railing and seeps in his last moments alone. He was nearing soaked from the light flurry of the storm, as if Zeus was smirking down on him with a knowing look from his high throne in the unforgiving clouds. He waits for the steps climbing the spiraling tower to end and admit defeat. </p><p>He's shocked to realise that, they had stopped long ago. He would not have came to conclusion through his haze had he not felt eyes on him. His head dips, looking at his pale fingers grasping the steel. He loses himself watching the small drops on his knuckles, reflecting back a broken soul he couldn't find himself to recognize. </p><p>Though, he turns. He sees nothing, but he feels a presence, gnawing at his gut that he is not alone. He was never alone, no, not physically. He scans the room before a thought dawns on him as if it had been obvious enough that the boy was not wearing a cloak. </p><p>"Potter," he mumbles, his voice heavy and unfamiliar to his ears and atop his tongue. He couldn't muster a sneer, no, not now. "Stalking me again?"</p><p>And a sigh rings the air slowly, the water in the air and breathing of the trees cease for a moment, giving all it's attention to the boy who drops his guise. </p><p>"Malfoy," he greets back in drawl. "Trying to catch a cold?"</p>
