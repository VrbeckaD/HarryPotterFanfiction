    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Leaves</em>. </span> <span class="s2">Leaves were everywhere. I mean they just kept falling off the trees and onto Harry’s and Draco’s yard. Harry loved the leaves. He knows it makes him sound like a child but he loves jumping into piles of leaves and feeling like a child. Draco on the other hand doesn’t like them as much as his husband. He didn’t like them falling off &amp; going in his neat yard well his and Harry’s yard. 1 year they have been married. How times go by fast. The best year of Draco’s life. Sure there was ups and downs but he loved Harry with all of his heart and he just know that Harry felt the same. </span></p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Harry dear, can you rake up all the leaves please.” Draco asks Harry. Harry is currently sipping his hot cocoa on the porch. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Yes darling” Harry called back and with a flick of his wrist the leaves made a pile. To be honest the only reason he agreed was so that he can jump in the leaves. He sets down his hot cocoa on a coffee table and ran to the pile of leaves. He stopped looked back at the door to see if Draco was there. Which he wasn’t and jumped in the pile of leaves. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Draco, come here” Harry yells and beckons his husband to come there. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Coming Love” Draco calls from the house. He comes outside to not see Harry anywhere in sight. He walks out further and further. Harry jumps out scaring him While throwing a pile of leaves at him and screamed “boo!”. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Did I scare you love” Harry asked. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“I’m going to get you back for this Potter” that being said Draco stopped down picking out some leaves from the pile and threw it at Harry. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“So it is a war you want it is war you will get” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">They stay there outside for an hour just throwing leaves at each other and they love their “friendly” competition. Eventually they have ran out of breath and collapsed to the ground with leaves everywhere. In their hair stuck to their shirts and pants. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“I think it is safe to say that I won” Harry said when Draco crawled towards him and laying by his side.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“As if I clearly won” Draco said getting closer to Harry. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Yeah sure you did” Harry said sarcastically. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Don’t even with that” he leaned over and pressed a kiss on Harry’s cheek. And with that he jumped to his feet pulled out his wand and made all the leaves go back in their pile. “I am going to go make some dinner” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">“Okay love” Harry stands up too. He grabbed Draco by his waist and pulled him close. He gave him a gentle kiss. Harry pulled away and held Draco’s hand. They went inside together and they made their dinner. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">They had a great day together and there’s no doubt about it all because of the leaves. </span>
