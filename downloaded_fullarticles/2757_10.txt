    <p>Cedric dies first.<br/>
Thrown aside like a bit of parchment too short to write on.<br/>
A green flash of light and the words “Kill the spare.” echoing in his ears.<br/>
After that Harry resolved to learn and train as much and as hard as he could to defeat Voldemort.</p><p>Sirius dies second.<br/>
Falling through the Veil with a smile on his face and his laughter still echoing through the chamber.<br/>
The rage Harry felt at the death of the man he had hoped to call home, fueled the first dark curse he ever cast. But it was not the last.<br/>
“You’ve got to mean it” Bellatrix calls in her mocking voice. And he does mean it though. It just takes more than hatred to fuel a Crucio. It takes power and control. Both of which he vows to improve. So the next time he sees her his curse won’t fail again.</p><p>Dumbledore dies third.<br/>
The man with the best of intentions and the harmful manipulations falls from the astronomy tower. The pain that was moments before carved into his face from Voldemort’s foul potion is absent. He seems peaceful in the aftermath of the Avada Kedavra. The man who even though he had wronged Harry, both through the Dursley’s and his manipulation and keeping him in the dark, he still cared for like a grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
Draco died next.<br/>
The third dark curse he ever casts finishes what he started in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom weeks before. The Sectumsempra rips Malfoy neck to waist open in deep slashes. His breath coming short and the blood flowing like water. There’s no time for Snape to save him now as the Death Eaters flee from Hogwarts.<br/>
Draco dies with the knowledge he failed his lord and the shame of defeat by his schoolyard nemesis.</p><p>Harry studies the darkest books he could find in Knockturn Alley when he returns home to the Dursleys. No. Not home. It has never been home with how he has suffered there. He tells himself it’s so he can find everything possible about Horcruxes and spells he might need to counter. He chooses not to think on how he’s memorizing the incantations and wand movements as he reads</p><p>Mad-Eye dies in the skies above Little Whinging. The coward Mundungus attracts the attention of the Dark Lord to the master auror. Harry didn’t see it happen but he’s sure Moody wouldn’t have gone without a fight. It’s the first real taste of death in battle in what is sure to be a bloody war.</p><p>Bill and Fleur's wedding comes and everyone is happy. Happy for a little bit of distraction in hope in these dark times.</p><p>Then the Death Eaters attack.</p><p>Harry grabs Hermione’s hand and they fight their way over to Ron. He is hoping she doesn’t notice the increasingly dark curses he throws at the black robes and silver masks.</p><p>Ron and Ginny are fighting back to back, wands raised and red hair flying fiercely. They are surrounded by Death Eaters, two bits of color in a sea of black and silver. Harry and Hermione watch helplessly as Ron and Ginny are struck down by killing curses.<br/>
Harry apparated them both away to the forest where the Quidditch cup was played, and they break down holding each other. Sobbing over lost friends and lost loves.</p><p>Hermione asks him about the spells he used at the battle of the Burrow. Harry tells her about the entrail expelling curse and the bone shatterer. The withering curse and the skinning hex. He defends his actions telling her that, “Stunners don’t work in a war when their enemies can be ennervated and thrown right back into the fray. Sometimes you have to put them down hard and fight fire with fire.” She looks disapproving and warns him that dark magic is addictive and enticing before she asks him to teach her the spells. Harry tries not to think how Ron would be vehemently against the use of dark magic.</p><p><br/>
So many others die during their quest for Horcruxes. The casualties listed on the wizard radio are long every day. Sometimes they hear names they know and mourn silently.<br/>
They come across a gang of snatchers that Harry obliterates quickly with an overpowered dark spell that summons internal organs.<br/>
He sits there in the carnage wondering how he had enough power to affect multiple people on a spell meant for one.<br/>
Harry and Hermione grow closer. They talk every once and awhile about Ron and Ginny, how they felt about their long gone friends. They share a bed when Harry’s nightmares become too much to handle.</p><p><br/>
They infiltrate the Ministry and Umbridge dies next. A simple piercing hex to her heart proves that Harry doesn't need dark spells to kill, and the words “I must not tell lies” carved into her hand brings him a small piece of revenge.<br/>
They capture Snape as he tries to lead them with his doe Patronus in the Forest of Dean. They interrogate him with Hermione’s brewed veritasium and learn that Dumbledore knew that Harry was a Horcrux and bound his core to stop it from gaining power. Harry realized that the bindings must be broken somehow, explaining his influx of power. The knowledge of this betrayal, the withholding of important information stokes the fires of Harry’s rage higher.<br/>
Snape dies on his own curse. The sectumsepra reflected back off the shield Harry threw up when Snape attacked Hermione. They left him there for the wolves and crows.</p><p>Harry uses the second Unforgivable Curse as they make their way into the wizarding bank. The imperio sings from his wand, the feeling of control is intoxicating, it's inviting nature is showing warning signs but he ignores them. He swears on the graves of his parents that he won't use the third Unforgivable, the curse that killed them, that gave him that scar.</p><p>Countless goblins die when they rob Gringotts. A blackness pulses in the back of his mind, a willingness to be more brutal and to curse more quickly. He ignores Hermione's slightly disapproving gaze and runs past warnings about the corruption of dark magic in favor of the power that flows from his fingertips.<br/>
Curses he didn’t like to use came effortlessly to his fingertips as he tore through the crowd of warriors he could have stunned and subdued. “You don't need to kill them,” a voice in his head whispers. He ignores it and throws the next dark curse at a goblin in his path. He’s long past the Light now.</p>
