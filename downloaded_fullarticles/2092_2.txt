    <p>
  <span>Harry's jaw went slack and hung open as he stared in shock at the healer in front of him. "Erm...can you repeat that?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mr Potter, you're pregnant."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Err, how? I'm a guy. That's not how that's supposed to work..." Harry said looking down at himself incredulously. He didn't look pregnant; he just felt like crap. Is <em>that</em> what pregnancy is? Nine months of feeling like arse?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It is a rare occurrence. But it's usually one that happens when you have regular unprotected contact with a magical being," the Healer explained. "From your blood test the womb inside you is about six months old..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry touched his stomach gingerly. "I'm having a baby," he said, sounding the idea out. "How big is it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The baby?" The healer assumed, smirking. "You're nine weeks along. I believe that's the main cause of your nausea and fatigue." Harry sat back; it explained a heck of a lot. Suddenly a thought began to surface. <em>Sleeping with a magical creature?</em> <em>He hadn't. He'd... Maybe he </em>wasn't<em> kidding when he said he was part Veela.</em></span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Could sleeping with a male Veela cause it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That would be very likely," the Healer confirmed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry winced; his brain hit auto pilot and he was not paying attention as the healer gave him a list of midwives and suggested changes to his diet. He left as soon as he could, retreating to the bathroom and staring at himself in the mirror. He hadn't changed, of course: he still had his dark, messy hair and his well-worn round glasses. Now though? Now he was <em>pregnant</em>.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That's just my luck</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought to himself, annoyed. He turned on the taps and cupped his hands underneath; catching the water between his hands, he drank some, thinking idly to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to talk to someone. He needed to know <em>why. </em>Hermione would research it - Magical Creatures weren't her strong point, but Fleur might know, she was a quarter Veela.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flooing back to Grimmauld Place, he collapsed onto the sofa and sat back on the sofa, sitting in the empty silence. He leaned back and eased his shirt up, looking down at his stomach; it was mostly flat, as always. He'd always been thin his entire life, with any muscle tone he had being due to a lack of body fat. The only curve in his body he'd ever had was a definite curve from his ribs to his belly which, due to being starved since he was one, had always been there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At primary school, one of the Muggles had said he looked like a starving African child you see in magazines; he'd been beaten up by Dudley for that and, a week later, he had changed schools.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While he was far from Dudley sized, there was a curve, a gentle one, low in his stomach. "Merlin, I hope you're alright in there," he said, feeling a grin creep across his face at the thought that he was having a baby - <em>his </em>baby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fireplace exploded into flames and a head poked out, resting in the flames.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Finally, Potter," said the familiar voice. "I've been waiting for you to arrive home for hours."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The head disappeared back into the flames, which receded. Seconds later they erupted into flames again and Draco Malfoy, his perfect blond hair falling neatly over his forehead, tumbled out. He stood up as gracefully as always and dusted himself off; his robes were neat and black, perfectly fitting his body as always.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn't get up - he hadn't thought this through he realised, as panic built up inside. Maybe Draco didn't <em>need</em> to know...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fireplace lit up with flames and a head poked out, "Finally Potter. I've been waiting for you to arrive home for hours..." Draco Malfoy commented, his perfect blonde hair falling neatly over his forehead. His disappeared back into the fire as they turned green and out tumbled Draco. He stood up gracefully and dusted himself off. Harry looked up at the blonde, dressed in his always neat black robes, fitted perfectly to his body. He didn't get up, he hadn't quite thought this through. Maybe Draco didn't need to know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry, you're staring. Is something wrong?" asked Draco, frowning as he eyed Harry with suspicion. "Is - oh. You want to break up," he muttered, the inevitable sigh breaking through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sat up straight, the words flying from his mouth in a jumbled mess. "No! Do you? Wait, no - that's not-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Spit it out," said Draco, smirking in relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm pregnant," said Harry. He couldn't even explain it if he had wanted too and felt himself wince.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blinked owlishly and stared in shock as colour seemed to drain from his already pale face; he clapped his hands over his mouth as tears began to well in his eyes. "Merlin, I'm sorry, Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Draco," said Harry as he watched him apologise profusely; it was, Harry realised, probably the first time he'd truly seen Draco put his walls down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't think it would happen," admitted Draco, falling silent as he sat next to Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because of your Malfoy Veela-ness?" asked Harry quizzically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes. "Obviously," he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Truthfully, I kind of thought you were making the Veela thing up," admitted Harry truthfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stared at him, affronted. "What, you thought I was pouring out my deep family secret for nothing?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, no - I mean, I just sort of assumed you were making it up to sound cooler," admitted Harry, shrugging. "I didn't think it'd get me pregnant."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sank forward and held his face in his hands, resting them on his knees. "It shouldn't have happened. I'm part Veela. But I'm not much Veela."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you - do you not want the baby?" Harry said, trying not to sound hurt. He wanted a baby. Being a dad - he had always imagined it happening eventually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I - no. It's just - I shouldn't have children..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes. "Too late now," he said. "Look, I don't know exactly <em>how</em> I'm pregnant, but I am; it's a gift."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sighed and put his arm around Harry, resting his head against his. "It's a baby of love," he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You love me?" asked Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes. But that's how your pregnant," Draco said, placing his hand on Harry's stomach. "When a Veela male loves a mate he's able to breed with them. I didn't mean too - honestly I didn't think I could!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry silenced Draco's apology with a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just shut up, you stupid Veela." said Harry, grinning as Draco chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You never said if you love me," noted Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Draco, I love you, but honestly I never thought you'd ever commit," Harry admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pressed his head into the crook of Harry's neck and kissed his skin gently, murmuring "I know."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the night had gone as usual dinner, then collapsing into bed, fucking, and then Harry passing out. Draco on the other hand couldn't sleep. Apart from the fact Harry's pillows were not as soft as his own, his mind was elsewhere; it was one thing to have a secret fling with Harry Potter. It was another to be publicly dating him - he was the Boy-Who-Lived. Draco was a pure blood - a Veela, a particular fact which was known to his parents and a few select Slytherins and even then the whole Veela thing was one of their deep dark secrets, the kind you take to your death bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead Draco figured he wasn't going to be happy if he settled down and married a woman. His father had firmly tried to convince him otherwise. But as Draco was as stubborn as his father, eventually his father explained. The Malfoy curse...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>According to his father - so in Draco's mind the whole thing was dubious - in 1795 The Malfoys were a family of six; Josiah and Angelique Malfoy had four children - Uriah, Erasmus, Zebulon and their only daughter, Euphemia. Now known for being the last female Malfoy, she had apparently fallen in love with this beautiful male with long, blonde hair, shining grey eyes and a pointed jaw. He was a Veela and they began a secret affair; every night she would walk out into the woods and make love to her Veela. Eventually her older brothers caught wind of something suspicious going on, especially when Euphemia was found to be secretly pregnant. Josiah, who was livid, sent his sons off to kill the Veela who had sullied his daughter's virginity and bring his head to be mounted on the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of the sons returned and were found decapitated, their bodies torn to shreds in the woods. Josiah was going spare; his wife Angelique was deep in mourning and struggling to cope with the loss of her three oldest sons. She took her life, and told her daughter to leave and never return, perhaps in an effort to at least give her some happiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Euphemia, heartbroken at her brothers' deaths and conflicted over her love for the Veela, walked into the forest and killed her lover, bringing his head back and placing it on her father's desk. Josiah had been horrified but understood, promptly drawing up plans to marry her off and cover the whole sordid thing up. Euphemia had ruined his plan, unintentionally, by going into labour and dying two days later from sickness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Josiah, left with no children and a half-breed grandchild, raised the boy and created a fake father so as not to sully the status of his grandson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since that date there had been no other female born into the Malfoy Family; it was believed that this was due to the strong Veela presence that was passed down through each generation, something which Lucius suspected was a curse placed on the family by the Veelas so that the Veela side, which should weaken with each passing generation, would not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco assumed it would just be a fact, another footnote in his life - like him being a Slytherin or his foot size; instead it had reared its ugly head and bit him firsly in the arse. His parents would be livid and it was bound to be a scandal in every paper: Draco Malfoy was a Veela and gay, which unfortunately led to him knocking up his boyfriend. He turned his head to look at Harry, who had his head resting on his chest, drooling as he slept.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco reached over and placed his hand on Harry's middle. His child was growing in there. He didn't regret it as much as he should have done; he was conflicted, but certain. He knew they baby inside Harry was created out of love. Even forbidden love, something Draco was proud of. He put his arm around Harry, holding him tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next morning Draco was brewing coffee from the table with his wand. Sirius Black, wearing a brown pinstripe suit, walked in a rolled his eyes in Draco's direction as he walked past Draco to the fridge. "I should put wards out the house to keep you out!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco ignored him, levitated the kettle and poured the tea into his cup, before returning the kettle to the stove. "Mother said she hopes your well," he commented coolly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tell my cousin her husband is still a tosser."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry walked in - he looked pale and tired. "Can you not fight for once?" he grumbled, thumping down in a seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Here," said Draco getting up and grabbing a glass of water before rummaging through the cupboards. "Let me get you some water and something light to snack on."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Two months of this and now he's doting," commented Sirius dismissively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uncle!" Harry sighed, as he drank the glass of water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, I wasn't aware of his condition until now.." Draco said, pulling a box of thin, salted crackers out of the cupboard. "Here, these should be alright."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Condition?" Sirius said firmly, turning to his godson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thanks," said Harry, hesitantly taking a bite.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry, what condition?" asked Sirius firmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm pregnant," he said, finishing the cracker and leaning back. "Which is apparently a thing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, only if you're sleeping with a Veela or..." Sirius trailed off as he looked at Draco, gazing at him suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco crossed his arms. "I'm part Veela," he confirmed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius grinned, a wide amused grin. "Not so pure now are you?! Oh, I love good old fashioned irony!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed as he snacked on another biscuit. "Uncle!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, come on Harry, you have to admit its funny." said Sirius, amused. "When I tell Remus about this..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sirius, he's pregnant. We're keeping it quiet," Draco insisted. "He is a guy. And he's Harry Potter. You know the magazines will have a field day."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius frowned. "I can't tell anyone? Well that isn't fair."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You can tell Remus and Tonks, but that's it!" Harry insisted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry!" Draco protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Look, I'm going to tell the Weasleys eventually. Sirius can tell Remus," said Harry diplomatically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rubbed his temples and sighed. "You are going to be the death of me, Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So I'm Potter again..." Harry said, smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"When you frustrate me, yes! You can't just tell everyone about this, because it's my life at steak! I'm a Veela and I don't particularly want that shouted from the rooftops!" Draco insisted. Harry's shoulders slumped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your right," said Harry. "But I'm telling Ron and Hermione."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fine," huffed Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius just beamed, smiling playfully. "Your first lovers' tiff. And to think I got too see it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes and sighed in annoyance and then glared at his godfather: "Seriously."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I think you mean Sirusly.."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco winced. "That was terrible. And you should feel bad," he said nudging Harry. "Come on, I have to head home anyway."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and sighed. "Of course.. Yeah."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco put an arm around Harry. "You could come back to the manor with me, you know."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blanched. "I'm pregnant, not suicidal," he replied frankly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes, "They are my parents, and this is their grandchild. They have to find out eventually."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I like never," Harry pouted. Draco sighed and pressed his head into Harry's shoulder, kissing it affectionately and pulling Harry close against him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know. We both know that's wishful thinking." Draco admitted as lifted his head and kissed Harry's lips. "I love you, Harry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry paused. "I love you, too."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco smirked. "I'll send you an owl later."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and stole a kiss from Draco's cheek. Draco walked to the front door and stepped outside. From the spy hole Harry watched Draco apparate away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You really know how to pick them," Sirius commented. "Of all the people to knock you up... It's<em> exactly</em> what I would have done." Harry smirked at his godfather's words. "Of course, if your parents were still alive your dad would have had a fit. Mind you, Kreacher would be impressed. A Black heir born here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry couldn't help but chuckle. "I'm giving birth in a hospital."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked at him straightforwardly. "You're a wizard. They always have home births. St Mungo's doesn't even have a maternity wing. As well as being a male..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry paled, suddenly realising that as fancy as the wizarding world claimed to be, they were very backwards.. "So there's no epi...epidural? Or potions or something?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All natural. Honestly, I was pretty sure James was going to lose his - you know - with the pain you put Lily through," Sirius warned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry paled further. "I need to sit down..." He mumbled, horrified at the realisation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I wouldn't worry too much," said Sirius, patting his back reassuringly. "Molly had seven kids and she's fine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked uncertain. Molly she wasn't a boy - she was made to deliver a baby. He wasn't.</span>
