    <p>
  <span>Julian walked into his office he shared with Barry. He set down his coffee cup and took off his jacket and hung it up. He sat down and took a sip of coffee when he heard footsteps approaching. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You are always late Allen, even with that speed of yours, why is that?” Julian said never looking up</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m actually early” Hermione answered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian looked up and saw Hermione standing in front of him. Her hair was incredibly short, it resembled a pixie cut, he almost didn’t recognize her. Standing up, he looked behind her to see if anyone else was there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here Granger?” Julian asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Looking for you Malfoy”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do not call me that”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I see you’re living as this Julian Albert Desmond, what kind of name is that? You were hard to track down” Hermione said looking down at the name plate on his desk</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now that you’ve found me, leave”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I need to speak to you about something”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you have to leave”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Before your coworker comes in and finds me here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Exactly, leave now”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then you’re coming with me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know you haven’t been here long, but here in America you just can’t just up and leave your work place whenever you feel like”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sure you can find an excuse, car trouble, cat’s sick, you need more coffee”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pushed his coffee cup off the table and it splattered all over the floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger! Stop this!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A quick scourify will fix it”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop that! These are muggles, no maj, have you forgotten!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just need to speak to you for a few minutes and then you’ll never have to speak to me again”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If only it were that easy”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Barry came walking in holding coffee and a box of half eaten donuts. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Julian, and friend. Really hot looking friend. I mean you don’t have any friends, I mean you don’t have friends that come visit you here at work” Barry said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter, she was just leaving” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Donut?” Barry offered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yes, at least someone here has manners” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took one of the donuts and smiled at Barry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Hermione, thank you for the donut” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Barry, how do you know Julian?” Barry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took a bit of the donut and looked over at Julian who looked very uncomfortable.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We went to school together” Hermione answered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A long time ago” Julian added</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not that long ago, would you believe that he used to dye his hair an unnatural shade of blonde? That it was almost white?” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why?” Barry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was a phase I grew out of. Anyways, you should get going” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yes, Julian has decided to take me out for breakfast since I’m only here a short while” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re already eating breakfast” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s ok, I’ll cover for you, that’s what we do, you know on team fla..I mean cause we’re friends”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione looked back at Draco who was standing there confused. This Barry was more like Neville from what she had seen, and Draco would never be friends with someone like that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you hit your head?” Hermione asked Julian</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No” Julian responded</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s go, it’s rude to keep a lady waiting” Julian said grabbing his jacket</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Barry watched the two of them leave. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Friend huh?” Barry said</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Hermione was walking in the nearby park with Draco who looked annoyed. She finished up her donut and walked with him.</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want Granger?” Draco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are you living as a muggle here?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why do you care?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because it was hard to find you. And this is the last place I’d expect to find you, living with muggles. What would your pureblood parents say?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t know, they’re dead”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It was all over the papers, my father sent to Azkaban, my mother died of overwhelming grief when my father received the dementer’s kiss.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, I wasn’t there, in the country that is. I just returned recently”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And where were you hiding?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Australia”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Teddy, he’s Tonks and Remus’s child. He’s a Black. He needs your help”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve never met him”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“His parents died fighting at Hogwarts. Harry took him in and raised him as his own. He’s about to go to Hogwarts”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is there a point to this Granger?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Teddy’s a Black, he’s entitled to some of the Black fortune. He needs that money to go to school”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Doesn’t the ministry pay for students who can’t afford to go?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s just it. They know he’s a Black, and they won’t pay for his schooling”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter can’t afford it? Saves the world and he’s still poor?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s not the point! Teddy’s entitled to that money! It’s just for him to go to school! Why can’t you understand that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want from me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re the only living of age Black, and therefore the fortune falls to you. You haven’t touched it anyways, so just give Teddy some so he can go to Hogwarts. I know you’ve never met, but-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright Granger! What do I have to sign to get this over with?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You have to go to Gringotts, they won’t release the funds unless you’re there in person, and they need your wand to confirm it’s you”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bloody hell Granger! That is the last place on earth that I want to be!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve arranged an international portkey so-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No! I’m not going back there! You’ll have to imperio me to do it! Don’t get any ideas!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do not call me that!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why? It’s your name! Why are you pretending to be this Julian person!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why did you chop off all your hair to look like a boy!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You stuck up, bigoted, spoiled prat!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Holier than thou swotty little-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is there a problem here?” the police officer asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two looked over and saw the police officer standing there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lover’s quarrel?” the police officer asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I apologize officer, she tends to get emotional” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione just glared at him in response.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe you should take this inside somewhere more private” the police officer said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, come along darling” Draco said grabbing her arm</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t call me darling” Hermione hissed</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Draco opened the door to his apartment and walked inside. Hermione followed him in and closed the door. The apartment felt barren almost. She could feel no magic, it was dead and empty. There were no pictures or anything to show who lived there. She was surprised there wasn’t even a snitch or anything quidditch related.</p>
<p>
  <span>“You live here? In this muggle flat?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re called No Maj’s here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you hiding from?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Everyone”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not the only one”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that why you cut your hair?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that why you’re spray tanned Draco?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re both trying to leave the past behind it seems”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Aren’t you afraid of my muggle germs in your flat?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never really believed in any of that. Not that it matters. The wizarding world only sees me as that. Deatheater.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You dye your hair too?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why did you pick this shade? You could have gone darker”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wizard hair is apparently resistant to muggle hair dye. Believe it or not I use the darkest color and it turns out like this”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why not charm it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I try not to use any magic while I’m here. Any new wizards to the area must register their wand and themselves so they can keep a record and track them”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you’ve been without magic this entire time?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But you’ve known magic your entire life. To go without it, how can you do it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sure the Americans would love to know that a former Deatheater lives here among them. They’d send me back and that is the last thing I want”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s cell phone start ringing and he answered it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Allen what is it?” Draco said watching Hermione walk around his flat</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We have a situation, where are you?” Barry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m in my flat”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was gust of wind, rustle of papers flew up in the air and Barry appeared next to Draco. Hermione jumped when she saw Barry appear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Julian! I’ll fill you in, hold on, and your friend is still here. In your flat, you’re together alone in your flat, together. Oh, I just, yeah, it’s ok. Cisco can figure it out. Um, you should really get that air conditioner fixed, causes such a draft” Barry rambled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Allen, I’ll call you later, I need to talk to her a bit and I’ll be down at star labs shortly” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, sure” Barry said as he left quietly</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What was that? Is he one of us?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, he’s not. He’s a meta human. Science not magic”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? Since when does Draco Malfoy believe in science?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Since I’m an expert in Meta Humans. I wrote several papers on it actually. I have a doctorate degree”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then I’ll read your papers while you and Barry are in the labs”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you are not staying here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well I could go with you, see more of these metas you study and write about”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, absolutely not”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I could just apparate there”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“NO! They don’t know magic exists, and we have to keep it that way”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine, I’ll be here when you get back”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Julian was at Star Labs analyzing the residue from the crime scene. It had strange properties and he didn’t know what to make of it. Joe walked in with Hermione, the two were laughing. Julian looked up horrified at the two.</p>
<p>
  <span>“I met your friend Julian. She’s so funny” Joe said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course you think she is” Julian answered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I went to look for you at work and ran into Joe instead” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you thought to bring her here?” Julian asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She seemed very interested in your work with metas, plus Barry seemed to like her” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Barry saw her for a total of 5 minutes” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So what are you doing now Julian?” Hermione asked as she walked to stand next to him</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Analyzing some residue left at a crime scene” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian noticed how close she was standing and how intently she was looking at the screen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You could have been an auror” Hermione whispered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I”m a scientist Granger”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure about that?” a different voice said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The three of them looked up and saw a strange man standing there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Abra Kadabra and you have something of mine” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Joe immediately drew his gun out and pointed it at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t move!” Joe yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? How many times have I heard that?” Abra said waving his hand</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Joe fired his weapon but it squirted water out instead. Joe looked at his gun in shock. Julian stood up and pushed Hermione behind him. He held his phone in his hand and quickly activated the app Cisco made whenever they were in danger. Abra sighed and threw something at them. It exploded and they were sent flying against the wall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s go!” Joe yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The three got up and ran down the hallway. Julian grabbed Hermione’s hand and pulled her along. They reached the other room where they closed the doors. Abra appeared behind them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Give me what I want” Abra said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian raised his hands in the air, to show his surrender. Joe did the same. Hermione rolled her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really? Really?” Hermione said looking at the two men</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger!” Julian hissed</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pulled out her wand from her sleeve and pointed it at Abra and yelled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Petrificus totalus”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger! Not in front of the muggle!” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Abra stood there frozen, unable to move. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you just do magic in front of all of us?” Julian asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You weren’t doing anything! I expected a lot more from you!” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was another gust of wind and special handcuffs were placed on Abra. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Everyone alright?” Barry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Peachy. Nice outfit” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your arm Julian” Barry said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian looked down at his arm and saw blood. He must have injured himself in the blast. Hermione held his arm and waved her wand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Episkey” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wound healed up quickly. Hermione cast another spell to fix and clean the arm sleeve. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What just happened?” Joe asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is she a meta?” Barry asked</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Barry and Joe watched as Hermione and Julian were arguing in the other room. They couldn’t hear what they were saying but they could see everything. Cisco returned with his popcorn and shared it with the others.</p>
<p>
  <span>“What I miss?” Cisco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not sure, they’re doing a lot of hand motions, and probably arguing in British terms we don’t understand” Barry said</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Honestly Granger?! That was completely reckless of you! Doing magic in front of the muggles?! Have you lost your mind!?” Julian yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I stopped that crazy man who thought he was magican with this pathetic parlour tricks! What was that? Does he think that’s even real magic!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s not a magician! He’s a meta!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you just stood there, you could have used your wand, but you just stood there! What happened to you!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t use magic!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re a pureblood! You always have magic! You just stood there and didn’t do anything!? I expected a lot more from you! Especially-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“From a deatheater!? That’s what you were going to say wasn’t it?! I was a deatheater right? I should be casting unforgivables easily! What the bloody hell happened to you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not the same girl from school anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Obviously”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why don’t you use your magic? It’s a life or death situation here!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re not dead are we?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No because I had to do something about it! But you! You were all too ready to let this, I can’t even say his name kill you. Honestly who names them?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cisco does, but he’s terrible at it”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where’s your wand?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“In a box”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why do you care?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because you’re a wizard! You’re suppose to use magic, it’s who you are! Do you even have magic in you anymore?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How dare you question me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione could see everything in the room start to get charged. She could feel it in the air. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am and always have been a wizard!” Julian yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione saw all glass in the room suddenly explode and shatter at Julians’ outburst. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you still have you magic then” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I never lost it”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you just see what happened there?” Cisco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I didn’t think Julian was a meta” Barry said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took out her wand and waved it around, all the glass repaired itself  and went back to where it was before. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you can do wandless magic” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know what you’re trying to do”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What am I trying to do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re trying to instigate me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Am I?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian grabbed her by her upper arms to stop her from moving closer to him. She placed her hands on his waist. He could see the glint of mischievousness in her eyes. He knew they were watching from the other room but couldn’t hear. He thought of the glass and instantly it turned into metal. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh come on!” Cisco yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not bad, transfiguring too now?” Hermione teased</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will go to Gringotts with you, sign whatever it is, and then we’re done” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I like this new look on you Malfoy, tan, scruffy, darker blonde. But you still dress the same” Hermione said as she moved her hands up his chest. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you are nothing like the Granger in school”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione leaned in to kiss him but stopped just before touching his lips. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you want to kiss me?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you want to kiss a Deatheater?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Former death eater”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And with that Hermione kissed him. His arms wrapped around her, while hers played with his hair. He pushed up against a table and she pushed him back against another. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your place?” Hermione breathed out</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, side along” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t have any wards up?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, let’s go”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was in the shower as Draco sat at his desk looking at his computer. He was trying to figure out a way to help Caitlin contain her Killer Frost powers. Hermione walked out wrapped in a towel. She walked over to him and climbed into his lap. He shut his laptop and immediately placed his hands on her hips. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m hungry” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You should be” Draco smirked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you don’t have any food here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can order something”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good, because it will take about 30 minutes before it gets here, plenty of time for me to-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione yelped as Draco picked her up and placed her on the table. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Only 30 minutes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It only took you 5 on my tongue”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco pulled her towel open and kneeled down before her.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean you’re leaving town for a few days?” Cisco asked on the phone</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll be back in a few days. There’s this thing I have to do” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thing? You’re calling her a thing now? Tall, brunette, british, and incredibly short hair like Halle Barry?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going back to England if you must know. I have to deal with my cousin’s inheritance”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And she’s going along with you right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll call you when I get back”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re gonna have to talk about these powers you and your friend have”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re not Metas”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Obviously, but-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Goodbye Cisco”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Rude”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Was that Julian?” Barry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, he’s going on holiday as they call it with his super hot super powerful lady friend with the super hot accent”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know Julian has the same accent”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah but she’s super hot”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco walked into Gingotts alone. He drew the attention of everyone inside as he walked by. The goblin sat atop in a high desk looking down at Draco but ignored him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If you’re going to pretend to ignore me by looking busy you could at least make it look realistic” Draco said looking bored</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr Malfoy, an unexpected surprise”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, it’s been far too long. I’m here to sign some papers about the Black fortune”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do not know what you’re referring to”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How about I get Harry Potter down here and he can clear things up then? I’m sure you’d love to see Saint Potter, isn’t he an auror?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The goblin hissed at the name of Harry Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Didn’t he take a ride off that dragon you had guarding something? I’m sure he would love to come back here and take something else that belongs to you”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr Malfoy, right this way”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco was in the Black vault. There were various heirlooms and other magical objects inside that he had never seen. The goblin presented him with a scroll. Draco quickly read it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am only allowing him part of the fortune, no heirlooms, or dark objects or anything else in here. He has access to funds to school and nothing frivolous.” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shall we appoint you the executor of the fortune?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bloody hell no. That would be Potter. I don’t know how much it costs to send him to Hogwarts, but I’m sure you do. He gets that amount, and supplies of course, which Potter no doubt already has a list.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Very well Mr Draco”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And a pet and broom if he so wishes it”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Noted. Now if you’ll sign here”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Draco was walking out of Gringotts trying to leave as quickly as possible. He wasn’t staying at the Manor, that place held too many memories. Once his mother had died, he left without looking back. He was walking towards his muggle hotel when he felt someone walking alongside him.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy” Hermione smiled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I did what you asked. Teddy can now go off to Hogwarts with his new caldron”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you, I know it must have been hard to do so, coming back here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No one’s hurled deatheater insults at me yet, but it’s still early in the day”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then we should have lunch then”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Aren’t you afraid of all the eyes watching us”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh who cares? We’ve both changed and I don’t care what people think anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure? Your reputation would be tarnished”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I highly doubt that. I think they’ve all forgotten about me. They only care about Harry these days”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And that doesn’t bother you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I like being left out of the spotlight. I’m hungry, let’s go already”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>After lunch, the two ended up at a candy shop. Most of the younger people didn’t realize who they were and ignored them. Draco had a sweet tooth and ended up buying far too much candy. Draco was eating a licorice wand, when Hermione pulled it from his mouth and took a bite from it.</p>
<p>
  <span>“There are plenty more in the bag, I don’t know why you had to take mine” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because I wanted to. And you were never going to share”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well now you’ll never know”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So are you going to invite me over or not?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t want to be presumptuous”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Always a gentleman. Must be that pureblood upbringing. Since you’re not going to invite me over, I’ll invite you over.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And where are you staying? Potter? Weasley?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Neither, I’m in a hotel right now. It’s rather cramped at Harry’s, and Ron and I aren’t exactly speaking”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Weasley not talking to you? Now that’s a story I need to hear”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Julian returned to Central City taking the plane rather than port key. He didn’t want anyone to know where he was traveling to. When he landed he checked his messages and they were all from a frantic Cisco. He took a cab over to Star Labs where he found everyone in a panic.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Julian, you’re back!” Cisco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s happened?” Julian asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So we know who Savitar is” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s good”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s Barry”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not real Barry, fake time remnant Barry”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And Caitlin hs full on Killer Frost now”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When did that happen?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You missed a lot while you were gone”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Miss me boys?” Killer Frost said as she appeared, “You should really change the security codes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian and Cisco ducked under the tables when Killer frost shot ice at them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I did not come back to this” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I called Barry, but he seems to be tied up” Cisco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian reached into his bag to find his wand. He held it in his hand and felt the magic thrumming through his body. He stood up, holding his hand at his side.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing?!” Cisco yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Finally stopped hiding?” Killer Frost teased</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve had a very tiring trip back” Julian said as he cast a shield in front of him</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Poor baby, let me make it all better” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Julian!” Cisco yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Killer Frost sent ice at him, but it bounced off the invisible shield Julian had cast. Killer Frost was surprised but then sent a blast of ice at him again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m rather tired right now. How about we move things along?” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian pointed his wand at her and then cast an unforgivable, Imperio. Killer Frost stood there with a blank expression on her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Be a dear and walk yourself into one of the cells and lock yourself in there” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Killer Frost began walking towards the cells. Cisco stood up and looked at him in amazement. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where can I get one of these?” Cisco asked</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>“So you’re not a meta” Cisco said</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, we covered that already” Julian said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But you’re not human”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not exactly”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then what are you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m a wizard. Magic is real. All of it is real”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Whoa. No way. Like pointy hats and dancing brooms and Mickey Mouse causing trouble?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Brooms don’t dance”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So witches are real”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your hot friend, she’s a witch!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why did you hide it for so long then? Do you know what we could have done if we had known?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not allowed to tell any muggles, no majs about magic. You humans are suppose to think that there’s no magic in the world. We keep our worlds separate”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why? Why would you do that? I mean magic is so cool!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Rules, I don’t make them. You have to swear never to tell anyone, otherwise they’ll come and oblivate you”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That doesn’t sound fun”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, they take your memories away, they’ll make you forget”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Amnesia! Does that mean people who have amnesia are just people that knew about magic?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know! It could be a possibility. Or it could be the fact that they have actual amnesia”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But they could be because of magic”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Julian watched as the rest of the team did as Savitar held Iris hostage. He watched as Barry tried to fight him but failed. Savitar was going to kill Iris. Julian going against everything he had tried to achieve in the past few years. He raised his wand and cast the same spell that was used on him.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sectumsempra!” Julian yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Savitar started screaming and dropped Iris to the ground. Barry flashed over and grabbed her and ran off with her. There was the sound of metal being scraped and torn open. Savitar clawed out of his metal suit, screaming and bloodied. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you do that?” Cisco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes” Julian answered</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can you make it stop?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Draco waved his wand in the air, packing what few belongings he had into a bag. He stopped and then emptied his bag. There wasn’t anything that he wanted. This life he had created for himself wasn’t one he recognized. He opened his window and stuck his head out.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bubo bubo!” Draco yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A eagle owl flew down from a tree and landed on his windowsill. He reached over and stroked its feathers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I neglected you. Will you forgive me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The proud owl merely looked at him but preened under his touch. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I need you to deliver something for me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The owl hooted. It had been so long since it had delivered anything. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just need to go get it, I’ll be back in a few minutes”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The owl looked at him aghast. Making him wait? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Julian walked out of his flat and headed over to the local bakery to pick up some donuts. He knew Barry had an affinity for them and smiled. He bought a small box and then returned home. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can you handle this Bubo?” Draco asked as he tied the box to his leg</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The owl merely hooted as if he were insulted. He was an owl, a wizard’s owl, not a carrier pigeon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Off you go” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The owl took off and flew out his window. Julian left his things and his apartment. He took his phone with him and walked out. He walked past the coffee shop where Iris, Cisco, Wally and Joe were talking. He walked past the bus stop where Caitlin was waiting for the bus. He walked past Star Labs and towards the water. He looked around at where he had spent the past year and sighed. Barry was gone. He walked into the speed force to take savitar’s place. His friends wouldn’t remember him, because the aurors here were very fast at responding when they realized he was using magic, from an unregistered wand, and casting a spell that could be counted as an unforgivable. The no maj or muggles were oblivated to forget his very existence. Julian Albert merely wrote papers on meta humans. He never worked with Caitlin’s mother to formulate a cure for her. And he never joined team Flash. With a crack, he apparated away.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Hermione was talking to Harry in his office when the eagle owl started tapping on the window. Harry opened the window to let the bird in. The owl landed gracefully on the desk, and looked at Hermione. When Harry tried to untie the box, the owl bit him.</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t think it’s for me” Harry said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione untied the box and the owl hooted. She opened the box and smiled at what was inside. She saw a postcard tucked under the paper and picked it up. It was a picture of a city skyline. She turned to the back and it was blank. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s strange” Hermione said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was a slightly glow and words appeared on the back. She smiled. She brought the postcard to her lips and kissed it, leaving her lipstick print on it. She looked around Harry’s desk for an envelope and placed it inside. She then tied it to the owl, who took off out the window. Hermione took a bite out of the donut inside.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who’s sending you donuts?” Harry asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I give you one will you drop this whole thing about Ron?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For the next 15 minutes” Harry said as he took a bite from a donut</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just let it go Harry. We’re the same, we’re not compatible”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t say anything. I’m trying to eat a donut here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Everyone expected me to marry him and squeeze out kids. I mean I didn’t know if I wanted to spend forever with him!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Still eating, not listening”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>Draco walked out onto the observation deck at the empire state building. It was windy and filled with tourists. He’d stop using the self tanner on his skin and it turned back into its pale porcelain tone. He stopped dying his hair and it returned to his natural platinum shade. He walked around looking at the city skyline. He felt someone standing next to him and looked over.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger, decided to finally show” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You didn’t give the greatest directions Malfoy”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was in a bit of a rush when I left”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What happened?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I tried to save someone, used magic in front of the muggles. A lot of magic, the aurors were there within seconds. Oblivated them”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry Draco”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re better off without me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can’t say that”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I just did, besides disaster averted, no one got killed, and everyone is safe. Guess that’s all that matters right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I suppose. The hero gets the girl. The sidekick gets praise, and they all live happily ever after”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Does the hero get the girl?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sometimes the girl gets the guy she wants”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Even if he’s a deatheater?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Former deatheater”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s get out of here”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your place or mine?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Does matter now does it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not really, let’s go”</span>
</p>
