    <p>Reborn's POV:<br/>
2 Years before the curse</p><p>When Renato Sinclair awoke he was cold. He was in what looked to be a medieval dungeon. The stone floor upon which he sat was damp with water and mildew. Renato was not sure how he got there or who had striped him of all his clothing, but he swore he would kill whoever locked him up. His eyes darted around the room looking for anyway to escape. He sighed. Whoever shackled him knew what they were doing. They somehow managed to block the use of his sun flames. Thankfully he could still use them internally to keep himself warm, but that was all the inhibitors allowed him to do. Renato tensed as the door creaked open letting in a stream of light.</p><p>"Seems like your awake", An older man with brown hair and hazel eyes said walking in.</p><p>"No thanks to you", Renato snarked back.</p><p>"Glad you have some fight left in you, muggle." The man stated with a lecherous grin, "This makes what I am going to do to you all the more satisfying."</p><p>Renato shivered and thought, "Damn it all. I'm supposed to be the greatest hitman in the world there is no way I am going to let you make me your toy!"</p><p>"You see I was unaware that there were any muggles in control of their soul flames. Especially those with the rare yellow aspect." The man said while he forcefully grabbed Renato's length.</p><p>Renato growled and kicked the man away from him.</p><p>The man smirked and wiped the blood off his face. "Do you know what men with the yellow aspect can do that no other man can do?"</p><p>Renato rolled his eyes and spit in the mans direction. Of course he knew what his sun flames allowed him to be capable of. </p><p>"If you wanted me to give you cancer all you had to do was ask." Renato jabbed at the man.</p><p>"I would prefer if you didn't." The old man said calmly, "After all I have to be alive for when my heir is born."</p><p>"Shit, shit, shit, shit", Renato thought as his eyes darted around desperately to find some means of escape.</p><p>"You know what. Patraficus Totalis." The man said and Renato felt his muscles tense.</p><p>"Fuck", He thought, "I cannot move any of my limbs."</p><p>Renato felt the man forcefully spread his legs. Renato closed his eyes and imagined himself somewhere far away. Using all the techniques he had developed to avoid breaking by torture. He felt a sharp pain up his anus. "Not here, not here, not here." He heard the man whisper something in his ear as another shot of pain vibrated up his body. "Not here, not here, not here." Renato imagined himself back in his apartment drinking a good cup of espresso. A sharp pain shook his being. Sitting with Fon fighting over tea versus coffee. Pain. Shooting at target practice. Pain. Having trouble thinking. Pain. Renato felt a sigh of relief as he felt the man leave his body. He could move his limbs now, but he hurt too much to do so.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Renato awoke sitting in a pool of his own blood. He felt a wash cloth touch his shoulder. Renato tried to move away only for a sharp pain to radiate throughout his body.</p><p>"Don't be scared of Dipsy." a strange elf like creature said. "Dipsy here to help young sir."</p><p>Renato stared at the strange looking creature for a second before scoffing. "I do not fear you."</p><p>The elf creature smiled at Renato, "Dipsy glad, Dipsy not startle young sir. Master told Dipsy to clean young sir then prepare dinner for him. Dipsy be right back with dinner."</p><p>Renato stared at the place the elf disappeared from and got an idea.</p><p>It was what Renato thought to be about a month when he had his second visit from his capture. He came in with another man who he was calling a healer. The healer walked up to Renato and he spit on him.</p><p>"So your the muggle murderer Lord Potter decided to procreate with." The healer said.</p><p>Renato growled.</p><p>"Still have some fight left do you?" His rapist this so called Lord drawled.</p><p>Renato tried to hold back a flinch.</p><p>"Your lucky you have a yellow aspect or Lord Potter would have never graced you with his presence." Healer said while approaching Renato. He then touched Renato's abdomen with what looked to be the tip of a glowing stick. "Congratulations Lord Potter. Your yellow did what only a yellow can do."</p><p>Renato stiffened. "Why?"</p><p>"The muggle asks why. Should I indulge him in the answers he seeks." Lord Potter said.</p><p>The healer smiled at Lord Potter and said, "You may as well. It is not like the muggle kind understand much anyway."</p><p>"Well you see, my wife is unable to have children and I require heirs to take over my line when I die." Lord Potter stated, "Yellow aspects make such good breeders."</p><p>Renato growled in response. He knew it was possible for sun flames to allow a man to bear children, but it was an unspoken rule in the Mafia not to act upon it unless the sun gave his or her permission. </p><p>Lord Potter laughed at Renato's anger and slammed the door shut leaving Renato in darkness once more.</p><p>"Dipsy came with food for young sir." the elf said as she hesitantly approached.</p><p>Renato nodded to the elf in acknowledgement as she spoon fed him since his hands were bound by chains.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As the months past by Renato worked on gaining the trust of the elf knowing she was his only means of escape. After a while he genuinely started liking the elf. It was nice to have some company in this dark dreary place. Renato was pretty sure Stockholm Syndrom must have kicked in, since he shouldn't trust the elf as much as he did. He learned that the elf was a slave to the Potter family. She had the same standing as him in the household. Renato felt sick to his stomach. He hated morning sickness. Renato has now been here for 9 months and he is expecting to give birth any day now. He trying not to show fear, but he knows most male suns do not survive giving birth.
Lord Potter tried to convince him that this was punishment for killing people. Honestly Renato felt that raping someone is worse than killing Mafioso any day.</p><p>Suddenly Renato felt his stomach drop. It was time. Fuck! It was time. Dipsy went to get her master and healer. It was 24 hours later when Renato finally gave birth. He tried not to stare at the brown haired baby. He didn't want this. He never wanted a child. Renato tried not to put blame on the child as he continued to bleed. Hopefully his child will have a better childhood than he had ever had. He watched as the child was taken from him, and all he could do was sit while bleeding profusely. <br/> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The next time Renato awoke he was in a hospital bed in the Sun ward of the Mafioso hospital.</p><p>"Glad to see your awake, Ren." Fon said, "You have been missing for about 10 months and then I find you bleeding to death in an alley way."</p><p>"Oh?" Renato blinks trying to get the sleep out of his eyes.</p><p>"You sure you do not want to work for the Triad with me?" Fon said seriously.</p><p>"Not interested." Renato said with a smirk, "Anybody take my place as top hitman yet?"</p><p>"No, but people are still competing for the title. I think now is the best time to create that new identity." Fon said.</p><p>"From today on I will be Reborn!" Renato said with a subtle smirk at his bad pun.</p>
