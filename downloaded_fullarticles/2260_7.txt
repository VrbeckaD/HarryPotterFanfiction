  <em> <strong>"You can’t be a hero without a quirk."</strong> </em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p>Usually after someone tried to tell Izuku this, he would cry. But then he'd pick himself up again and face the world with his teeth bared in a fierce smile. They had no say in his life. Besides, he would never know unless he tried, right? The only way to guarantee he'd never be a hero was by not trying.</p>
<p>But to hear it from him? From the one man he'd always looked up to? To smile and make everything better, because he was there? It felt like a punch to the gut.</p>
<p>Izuku logged off after All Might tactlessly killed his dreams but vaguely remembers him mentioning different career options. He barely registers All Might telling him he had to go turn in the villain he’d captured and that he should have a doctor check him out before breezing past him.</p>
<p>Izuku felt numb. He wandered over to the roof’s railing and gripped it like a vice. A sigh, that may as well have been a sob, escaped him without his volition. He squatted down on the balls of his feet and put his face to bars in an effort to ground himself. It didn’t really work. He watched some kids play ball on the street below instead.</p>
<p>They seemed to be playing soccer, but instead of using their feet to kick the ball around, they were using their quirks. One of the goalies was able to make small green disks come out of her hands for short periods of time and the other goalie appear to be able to stretch his arms quite a bit. There were two other kids sending the ball back and forth across the empty street.</p>
<p>One had some kind of super breath and blasted it straight at the goal. The other kicker dashed, <em> Woah, he's fast, </em> in front of the goalie and pointed at the ball. Then it disappeared. Izuku blinked. He pressed his face closer to the bars for a better view. The ball reappeared a split second later on the end of the street it came from next to the goalie with the disk quirk. <em> Transportation? </em>No, the ball kept up the momentum from when it disappeared. The opposite goalie must have expected this because she already had a green disk on each hand and blocked the shot. Displacement would be a better term for a quirk like that. Izuku closed his eyes and rest his forehead against the bars. His thoughts strayed back to his impromptu face-to-face with All Might. He snorted.</p>
<p>   <em> What am I even doing? </em> He took a deep breath.</p>
<p><em>   I guess I should have expected it though. I’m quirkless and I’m built like a damn stick. </em>Izuku looked down at his arms. He blinked, then covered his face with his hands. He was such an idiot.</p>
<p><em>    I should be taking advantage of the factors I can control! </em> Izuku is a weak kid. He <em> knew </em> he was a weak kid. He could be getting <em> stronger.</em></p>
<p>He knocked his forehead against the bars. <em>At least I figured that out </em><b><em>before</em></b> <em>the</em> <em>UA entrance exam. </em></p>
<p>Izuku stood and pat his legs as the blood rushed back into them. He needed the be realistic. There was no way he’d be able to surpass other applicants in the physical part of an exam in his current state. Mentally, he has more than a chance. But as of today, he has ten months to get stronger. He'll need to learn how to fight as well. Building muscle needs a better diet right? And proper equipment. Can he afford that without asking him mom for money? Probably not. He’ll need to get a job.</p>
<p>Izuku’s phone chimed. He blinked. He reached for his phone, his ears dusted pink with embarrassment. <em> I should be planning at home when I can at least write things down instead of standing around like an idiot. </em> Just as he opened a message from his mother ( <em> Can you grab some flour on your way home?), </em>his unoccupied hand suddenly was wasn’t holding onto the bars anymore. He would have stumbled but his feet weren’t on the ground either.</p>
<p>Izuku wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing, but if it wasn’t for his recent accidental ride on the All Might Express, he wouldn’t have immediately realized he was falling.</p>
<p>  <em> How- </em></p>
<p>He nixed that thought before it could start. How didn’t matter at that point because it wasn’t going to stop him from falling.</p>
<p>
  <em>   Why am I so high!? </em>
</p>
<p>He just managed to right himself and he could see the roof he was just on from <em> above. </em></p>
<p>At the rate he was falling, Izuku probably had 10 seconds before he became a sidewalk pancake. It took him 3 of those seconds to realize that there was no way he could stop it.</p>
<p>Izuku couldn’t hear over the wind in his ears and his eyes were glued to the fast approaching ground and his only thought was that didn’t want die, that would devastate his mother.</p>
<p>At least he probably wouldn't feel the impact due to shock.</p>
<p>At least he hoped he wouldn't.</p>
