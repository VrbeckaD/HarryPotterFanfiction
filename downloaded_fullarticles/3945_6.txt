    <p>Before we continue onto the main story, Reader allow me to tell you the tragic tale of Agate Lightvale and her twin brother Copper Lightvale…</p><p>We find ourselves sometime in the past or more specifically… the “Golden Age” of magic as some historians in the wizarding world have dubbed it. What is the Golden age? You're wondering to yourself. This was the time period of the famed wizard Merlin and King Arthur of Camelot. During this time, magic was freely used in everyday life without fear of being executed.</p><p>We find ourselves in a large home, where the cries of a baby could be heard echoing. Two small children, the twins Agate and Copper are looking in their mother's bedroom as she just gave birth to their new baby sister, Amber. Unfortunately, Amber’s birth took it toll on their mother and her Blue Soul, the soul of Integrity, began to crack. The healer, Mila Rutrow, the Wizard of Kindness was a renowned healer but even she could not stop the SOUL from shattering.</p><p>Agate, the soul of Bravery, had a look of horror upon her face as her mother’s soul shattered while her twin brother flinched.</p><p>A few years had passed since the birth of Amber and the deaths of Agate and Copper’s parents. As a result of their parents untimely deaths, the twins took it upon themselves to raise their little sister the best they could. Copper was with Amber, playing with her when Agate came in and informed her brother that he had been summoned by King Roy Goldburn.</p><p>Copper sighed, placed a kiss on Amber’s forehead and said his goodbye to Agate. Once the door closed, Agate looked at Amber with a small smile as the child held out her arms to be lifted.</p><p>Another few years have passed and we find the Lightvale family out and about playing various types of games.</p><p>Later that day, the Lightvales are back at their home and too her siblings surprise Amber has discovered her soul trait or rather traits… a rather unique soul. Amber had the Soul of Kindness/Integrity. Copper leaned down and observed the soul as it continued to shift from dark blue to Green. That night Amber was in her room, reading a book on the different types of souls and their rarity, until she heard Copper and Agate shouting at each other.</p><p>It was hard for Amber to make out what they were saying… something about a war? The argument started to get louder and Agate pointed her spear at her twin’s throat, challenging him to a battle. Agate smirked at her twin who glared in return.</p><p>The next day, the two fought viciously neither one willing to back down. At first, the battle was in the favour of Agate, with her spears allowing her to attack from a distance… but slowly the battle shifted into Coppers favour who slashed at Agates spear shattering it. The Wizard of Bravery fell to the ground as copper pointed his ruby red sword at her before turning to the crowd and raising it in victory.</p><p>Tears formed in Agates and both of eyes and hair turned gray as she felt her bravery disappear. Copper and Amber called out to her but it was no use… Agate had fled the kingdom.</p><p>Months passed and no one has heard from or seen Agate. Copper was left with the responsibilities of keeping the kingdom intact while raising Amber.</p><p>Amber was in her room studying when Copper called her. Once in the main room of the lightvale home, Amber let out a gasp as she saw Copper hugging a brown haired Agate. Amber joined her brother in welcoming their sister home by throwing a party for her.</p><p>Everytime someone asked Agate where she was and what she has being doing in her exile, the queen gave a vague answers.</p><p>After the party, Amber went to bed and the twins stayed up to catch up. The young princess woke up in the middle of the night to her sister screaming at Copper again, slowly the bluenette made her way to the living room as Agate shoved Copper to the ground pointing her brown spear at her twin “FIGHT ME!” The Queen screamed, Copper shook his head and looked away.</p><p>Agate grit her teeth, looking in Amber's direction before an insane grin made its way onto the mad queen’s face. Copper gained a look of horror as Agate turned around and made her way towards Amber who looked at her elder sister with a terrified expression. The Wizard of Determination shot up to the ground, his ruby sword materialising into existence. Agate smirked as Copper charged at her, in a blink of an eye the Wizard of Bravery’s spear clashed with Coppers shield. Looking at Amber, Copper told his little sister to run. With a look of fear on her face, Amber began to run for the door.</p><p>Unfortunately for Amber, Agate had sent a fireball at the door destroying it and trapping under the wooden beams. Amber managed to pull herself free by tearing her off a part of her skirt and fell to the ground with a wince. She looked up and saw Agate, with an insane smile on her face and her spear raised, and could her copper screaming for Agate to stop.</p><p>Agate plunged her spear threw the chest of her sister while Copper slumped to the ground… his Soul of Determination turning gray. Agate laughed as she saw Amber's soul shatter and made her way to her brother, preparing to end his life as well. Raising her spear once more, Agate drive it threw her brothers chest, as tears rolled from his eyes. Placing her hand under his chin, forcing him to look up at her, Agate with a smile spoke “I win” as her brother slumped to the ground, but unknown to Agate his soul did not shattered… it simply disappeared.</p><p>Agate growled as she leaned against the wall, her brown soul in her hand, during her exile, Agate had managed to invert her Bravery trait and it became the soul of fear. And due to her years of training under the most powerful wizards, like king Roy Goldburn and his court who had disappeared sometime ago.</p><p>Glaring at her cracking soul, Agate grabbed the body of Amber and dragged it off to a cave that she found years ago. This cave had immense magical power which amplified a person's magic… throwing Amber on the ground Agate raised her hands as her soul began to shake. Channelling her dark magic into the soul, Agate began to chant the Bête Noire spell… one of the most forbidden inverted magic spells in history. As the spell finished, Agates brown soul became a bright pink.</p><p>Looking down at the body of her deceased sister Agate held the Soul above her “And now Little Amber, you and your descendants are to ensure that nothing is to disrupt the balance of magic. Destroy them, those who would disrupt everything whether they be light or dark, good or evil… it was a shame that Copper didn't see it my way, things would've of been different if we had gone to war.”</p><p>In a flash of pink light Amber-no Bête Noire stood up as Agate slumped to the ground, the life leaving her eyes</p><p><b>Finally done. Ok so if this still confuses you, watch glitchtale origins by Camila Cuevas. It mostly the same but I made a few tweaks to it</b>.</p>
