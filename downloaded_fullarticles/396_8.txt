          <div class="userstuff"><p>'You shouldn't have come.' Harry's voice is empty.</p>
<p>'I read your letter,' I say in response, when the silence stretches for too long and he does nothing but stare. He looks defeated. I want to touch him.</p>
<p>'I wrote that twelve months ago,' he says, turning to look back through the one way mirror. 'I'm a different person now.'</p>
<p>I can't follow the path of his eyes. I know what awaits him in that room and I can't let him do it.</p>
<p>'You're not,' I say. He doesn't respond, so I reach for the arm of his dark Unspeakable robe.</p>
<p>'You're not a different person,' I repeat. 'Not yet. Please don't do this.'</p>
<p>'It's already done,' Harry says, and there's something sad in his voice, just a fraction of emotion. I cling to it.</p>
<p>'I've already shed most of my memories. After today I'll be clean and ready to transition.'</p>
<p>He's looking back through the window, at the other trainee, screaming silently as every memory, every element of her being is pulled from her, displayed and discarded. </p>
<p>'Harry,' I say, fingers tightening on his sleeve. 'Please. Don't do this.'</p>
<p>I don't know what I expect, him to shake me off, to kiss me, to hit me. Instead he turns, voice calm.</p>
<p>'They take the deepest, most important memories last,' he says instead. 'I've lost so much. I can feel the spaces where it used to be. But some things are still there.'</p>
<p>Just for a heartbeat, I can see what was between us shining bright in his eyes, but then it's gone again.</p>
<p>It's hours later when I see it again. It's the last memory to be ripped from him, the thing he clung to so desperately. </p>
<p>My eyes are blurred with tears, but I can easily make out my own face, smiling up at him, my lips moving as I mouth the words.</p>
<p>
  <i>I love you.</i>
