  <em>
    <span>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harrie Potter rolled over inside her blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside her and she slept on, not knowing she was special, not knowing she was famous, not knowing she would be woken in a few minutes’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to turn off the porch lamp, nor that she would spend the next hours being poked and prodded by goblins as they figured out just what was wrong with her… She couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harrie Potter- the girl who lived!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Dursley opened the front door, intent on turning off the light as Mr. Dursley had asked. As she did so, her eyes found themselves trailing downward, towards a blotch of color in her lower peripherals. They widened over dramatically before a scream was ripped through her throat uncharacteristically. Green eyes tiredly opened to meet blue, Mrs. Dursley’s scream echoing into the night sky above them. She snapped her mouth closed and quickly bent down to pick the child up into her arms, anger flaring at the thought of someone simply leaving her to the cold October night, swaddled in nothing more than a blanket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Petunia!” Mr. Dursley sounded out of breath as if he had run from their bedroom at the sound of his wife’s scream. He probably had. ‘What’s wrong, what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia turned to face her husband, face not even approaching a smile as she took in the sight in front of her- Mr. Dursley was red-faced, nightcap falling off, with a broom in his hands. The broom was dropped in shock. Somewhere in the house, Dudley began to cry from being woken. The infant in her arms did not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that…” Mr. Dursley trailed off, not wanting to be the one that finished the sentence. His wife had voiced her concerns previously about her sister’s wellbeing, but he had dismissed them as Petunia’s overbearing habits. If the child in her arms was who he believed, then she had every reason to be concerning for her sister and family. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go sit with Dudley.” Her voice was quiet but boomed in the silence of the house. She moved out of the doorway and past her husband, into the living room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child was still quiet, looking up at her aunt with curiosity in her eyes. She observed the world around her and blinked sluggishly, lazily, her eyes closing slowly. Petunia may not have had the same capabilities as her sister when it came to their family’s magic, but she could tell simple things when the source was strong enough, and nothing could match up to her skills as a mother- her instincts were now screaming at her that something was wrong with the child, her niece. Something was very wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her arms beginning to shake, she laid the child down gently on to the sofa, moving pillows around to properly support her. The child didn’t fuss, eyes still closed. Petunia brushed a lock of hair out of the girl’s face before hurrying over to the still-lit fire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Dursley matriarch reached on top of the mantle, ignoring the pot of floo powder and going straight to the tin next to it. She grabbed a handful of the foul-smelling powder and threw it forcefully into the flames, watching as they turned to a bright scarlet. Perhaps she used too much powder, she thought, stumbling backward with a shriek pulled from her throat as the flames licked the outside of the fireplace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even as her aunt struggled to get ahold of herself, the child remained quiet and complacent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long for the powder to take its effect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wisps of silver emerged from the fireplace, taking their respective forms as a wolf and fox. The patronuses looked around before their owners joined the fretful woman. Two men tripped out of the fireplace, one moment after another, both looking worse for wear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first had shaggy black hair pulled into a pathetic bun. His grey eyes sported bags underneath, his face held a five ‘o clock shadow that had obviously been growing for several days. His robes were pulled tightly around him, but Petunia could see the mismatched clothes underneath, down to the different shoes he wore on each foot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The second was slightly more put together than his counterpart, but only by a fraction. His sandy brown hair was as disheveled as the rest of his appearance, sticking out in every which way as his hands returned every few moments to run through it. He had forgone robes and shoes, but he wore sweatpants and a dress shirt that had been buttoned wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The former raised his head to meet Petunia’s eyes. At that moment she knew that her worst fears had been confirmed, his eyes red-rimmed and distraught. She heard the words echo in her mind before they left his mouth and his confirmation did nothing to help the pain stabbing through her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James and Lily were killed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia forced herself to clamp down her jaw and bite back the tears, a sob stuck in her throat in fear of scaring the child on the sofa. She sullenly nodded and took a shaky breath as Sirius crossed the space between them and pulled her into a hug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They weren’t the closest out of the group, but over the past months, as Lily and James were left fighting for their lives, James had entrusted his best friend with making sure that his wife’s sister was kept safe. They, along with Remus, had become closer, and as a few tears leaked from her eyes and onto his shoulder as he rubbed her back soothingly, she remembered why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia shook in his grasp, but her head was nodding. “I suspected as much when I found Hadria...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The name reminded the trio that there was, in fact, another person in the room. The girl in question still laid, unperturbed by the going ons around her, on the sofa, green eyes closed to the world around her. Sirius gently let Petunia go and she wiped the remaining tears and Remus briskly walked over to the babe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus, be careful.” Petunia warned, moving quickly to stand in his way. “There’s something wrong with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus squared his jaw. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think,” She walked placed herself between Hadria and Remus, but she wasn’t exactly sure which she was more intent on protecting, “We’ve often made comments of Hadria being the loudest child in history. Yet, she’s been absolutely silent. And I may only be a squib, but I’ve never felt that amount of pure magic on anyone, including my parents, let alone a child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus gently pushed his way past her. He bent down to pick up Hadria, only to hesitate as his hands wavered over her. He stood back up and sighed, running his hands through his hair again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Petunia, I’m going to need you to pick her up.” His voice was tired, and Petunia could see the pain in his eyes. “We’re going to need to bring her to Gringotts, see what the goblins know. I feel as if our night is just beginning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia nodded and hurried off in the opposite direction, presumably to update Vernon on the situation. Remus sat down on the sofa, moving gently as to not disturb Hadria, his hand resting on the sofa near her head. Sirius came over to join them, placing his hand in a comforting gesture on Remus’ shoulder. Remus turned and gave him a sad smile, of which he returned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus turned his focus to his small godchild, the sad smile still present on his face, and whispered, “Hadria Potter, you are going to be much more trouble than you’re worth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Actually,” Sirius interrupted, snaking his hand around Remus’ shoulders in a comforting manner, “I’ve always admired the name Vivian for a child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus’ eyes widened in alarm, and he looked back and forth between the child and his partner, “Sirius, you don’t mean-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius tightened his hand on Remus’ shoulder and nodded firmly, “James and Lily left us as the godparents, Remus, and we can’t leave Petunia to take care of a child such as her alone. There are people who will want their hands on her, and the only way to ensure she’s safe is if she’s in our care.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, we aren’t ready for a child, we aren’t even married yet because that was too big of a step to take,” Remus argued, not because he was unwilling, or unwanting, to take care of the green-eyed child, but because he was fearful of their ability as parents, “We might as well be leaving her in Petunia’s care with the amount we’ll be able to care for her.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to argue you on this, Remus.” Sirius’ jaw was dead set, and from the entrance to the room, Petunia admired how he was handling the situation with uncharacteristic maturity- the maturity of the family usually came from Regulus, not Sirius. “Our godchild is now our daughter, and we will raise her as such.”</span>
