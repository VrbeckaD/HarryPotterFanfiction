    <p>“What the everloving fuck?” came the explosion behind him. Oliver startled, dropping the floo powder on the floor. He was momentarily caught up by the green and black sparkling through the air (all the better to help avoid looking toward the door). <i>Shit</i> he thought, <i>now was crunch time</i>, straightening, the burly scot turned towards the doorway leading to the small hall. He attempted not to cringe as he caught sight of the fucking enormous man taking up the whole door frame. 6’5” of solid muscle quivering in rage glared at him. Oliver wasn’t frightened, no, he’d never been intimidated by Marcus on or off the pitch. Oliver was cringing from guilt. </p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me? I haven’t seen you in <i>three</i> days, you snuck in at two a.m. and didn’t even come in to say hello or sleep in our bed and now, hah! Now you are sneaking out again without saying goodbye!” the note of hysteria in Marcus’ voice was evident even to Oliver’s sleep deprived state. He finally dared to look at his partner’s face, shocked as he spotted tears silently tracing their way down the dark cheeks. </p><p>“Shit babe, I don’t even know where to start” he tried. Oliver truly didn’t - what <i>should</i> he say? The fact was that, despite how much he loved and trusted his partner, Marcus was a security risk the Order of the Phoenix disapproved of. He was committed to both but right now the Order had to take precedence. They were in the middle of a war, he’d thought that Marcus had understood that. Oliver took a step toward the openly weeping man in the doorway but stopped again as Marcus held up his hand defensively. </p><p>“Just don’t” Marcus whispered in a broken voice that made Oliver’s stomach clench. “I can’t stand it any more. I never know if you’re alive or dead or just fucking around with the rest of the Order between missions.” </p><p>“I don’t fuck around” started Oliver hotly, going bright red. </p><p>“That’s interesting isn’t it?” yelled Marcus, instantaneously switching from utterly distraught to murderously angry “All those fucking owls from Charlie fucking Weasley say different.” Marcus started to cry again “I thought you were over him years ago, you promised me Ols, you <i>promised</i>”. This was worse than the rage Oliver thought (even worse, Marcus was right, he<i> had</i> promised). </p><p>Oliver tried again, his voice breaking “I...I just...I’m so sorry Mar. I can’t talk to you about missions before they happen and I don’t want to tell you how bad they were after. Once we’ve been healed up...I dunno, near death experiences leave me with the same high that a really hard match gives...” he trailed off lamely after glancing up wild-eyed at Marcus, tracing the strong lines of his face. </p><p>“I’m sorry I can’t take back what I’ve done. I promise I’ll try to do better” he said, then waited, head bowing under the weight of scrutiny from the other man. He watched Marcus’ form, the way the warm light of the flames from the fireplace danced on the dark caramel skin of his bare chest, his face partially hidden in the shadows cast by the door frame. </p><p>The cheery scot could normally take anything life threw at him. It was why he and Charlie made such a good partnership for the more dangerous mission, they both stayed calm against the terrifying intensity in a way normal people just didn’t. But this time, oh this time Oliver felt only fear in the pit. He just did not want to hear what was coming. The fire crackled and spat while marcus stood there measuring him silently. Despite the warmth from the hearth the shadows felt as if they were crawling over him, chilling his body to the bone. After what felt like an age the reply came, jolting Oliver back to the present. </p><p>“No” came Marcus’ deep voice. Oliver focused on his partner’s eyes. They were their usual steel grey, beautiful with the tears still glittering around the lashes like tiny diamonds but the look inside them was the same hard, burning force that Marcus turned on tricky opposing teams. Oliver knew he was lost with the next words. </p><p>“You are going to return to headquarters now. I will see you again when the war is over if we’re both still alive.” </p><p>A sob tore itself from Oliver’s chest as he shook his head, barely noticing the tears streaming down his face.  </p><p>“Mar...” he tried but the larger man cut him off, voice breaking </p><p>“Go. Now. I’ll get your stuff together and someone else can come collect it in the next hour” </p><p>“Mar, no” Tried Oliver again but Marcus was openly crying now as he stopped Oliver speaking again.  </p><p>“It c-can't be you or Ch-charlie. I’ll key Order members into the wards” Marcus choked as he stepped backwards into the hall. “Go. Good luck with the war” and with that, Marcus shut the living room door quietly but firmly. </p><p>Oliver was left stood on the colourful hearth rug blinking in shock. Barely able to see through the tears he turned, grabbed a pinch of floo powder and threw it into the fire before stepping in and calling “Shell Cottage”. The roaring, sickening rotation ended surprisingly quickly, leaving him staggering into Bill and Fleur’s cosy little sitting room. He made it a couple of steps before collapsing onto the floor in wretched a ball of misery. He didn’t even register the stocky figure of Charlie Weasley appearing in the doorway drying his hands on a tea towel. Charlie cocked his head, taking in the scene. </p><p>Out of nowhere Oliver heard Charlie’s voice above him “Ols, what’s wrong?” asked the older man, causing Oliver to curl further into himself. Oliver heard swift footsteps but could not bring himself to move his head away from his knees. </p><p>“Is it Marcus? Is he hurt? Is the flat compromised?” asked Charlie urgently, unable to think of anything else that would make his mission partner <i>this</i> distressed. He sat on the floor next to Oliver and threw an arm round him. Oliver briefly nestled into the touch then almost immediately leaned away shaking his head against his knees as Charlie stroked his brown locks. </p><p>“Shit bud, you need to tell me what’s up or I’ll have to go through and check myself”. Oliver shook his head violently at Charlie’s words before finally lifting it to look at the ceiling. He took a steadying breath and said in a low, broken tone </p><p>“You can’t. Marcus has keyed the wards against us.” </p><p>“What?” asked Charlie, aghast. </p><p>“He found out about us and he’s kicked me out” said Oliver. The hand on his head stilled and was slowly withdrawn. Ollie finally turned his head enough to see the vibrant redhead’s face. He was staring at Oliver as if he had admitted to torturing baby dragons. </p><p>“Are you telling...” Charlie shook his head a couple of times to clear the ringing in his ears. “Are you telling me that you have been cheating on Marcus with me for the past <i>nine months</i>?” Charlie closed his eyes, head back as he pieced it all together, then he snorted a humourless laugh “<i>Of course</i>. The first time was with permission from Marcus like you said wasn’t it?” </p><p>“Yes” whispered the other man. </p><p>“But that was just for that time?” Charlie asked. </p><p>“Yes” came the almost inaudible reply. </p><p>“So you let me assume you had blanket permission for an open relationship and you let Marcus assume that everything was back to normal?” </p><p>“Pretty much” Oliver sighed “I know it’s not okay and I’m sorry”. Charlie stood abruptly. </p><p>“You utter arsehole” he said softly, surveying the scot. “He’s done everything you’ve asked for,<i>everything</i>.” He shook his head again “I’m going to write a letter to Marcus then I’ll send Bill through to get your stuff. I don’t really want to see you right now.” </p><p>The younger man nodded. “I understand” he said simply. Charlie gave him one last disgusted look and strode away. Oliver could hear his feet thumping up the stairs as he slowly untangled himself and moved to the sofa where he curled up and went miserably to sleep.</p>
