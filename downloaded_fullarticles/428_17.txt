    <p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"The Slytherins are here," Ron said, his voice low and acrimonious.</p><p align="justify">Hermione felt every inch of her muscles tense.</p><p align="justify">Despite knowing better, she looked up from her plate of toast at the newcomers stepping into the Great Hall for breakfast. All the familiar faces were there: Avery, Antonin Dolohov, Lucius Malfoy, Corban Yaxley, Alphard Black, Rodolphus Lestrange, and of course, there was Tom Riddle.</p><p align="justify">Out of all those sneering faces, his stood out the most, which was hardly surprising because his was the only face that wasn't sneering and, of course, since he was the leader of the group. The dynamics had never been explicitly stated, but it was obvious enough from the way he walked quietly in front of them, with none of the other Slytherins even daring to step alongside him.</p><p align="justify">It would have been easy to regard him with contempt, Hermione thought, but most people didn't. She wouldn't say she liked him because of the company he kept, but contempt? </p><p align="justify">No, he was too polite for that. He left her alone, and that was enough. While most Slytherins made no secret of their endless mockery and loathing for Muggle-borns, she had never witnessed Tom Riddle expressing any form of prejudice towards anyone, regardless of their blood status. He was unwaveringly urbane and pleasant to everyone, and partly because of that, he was the first Slytherin in many years to be made Head Boy.</p><p align="justify">There was, of course, also his academic brilliance. He had scored at the top of his cohort every year leading up his current seventh, just as she had scored at the top of her cohort that was two years behind his own. As of late, there had been much buzz about his being awarded the Medal for Magical Merit by the Headmaster, and it was a prize an ambitious Hermione was eagerly eyeing as well.</p><p align="justify">The problem with that was, despite scoring at the top of her cohort, that was only compared to her peers of that cohort. Based on Riddle's groundbreaking records, his annual examination scores had been higher than hers throughout all four years of her studies thus far.</p><p align="justify">Veering near on arrogance on her part, she had never thought that was possible.</p><p align="justify">"Miserable, nasty twats," Ron muttered over a swig of pumpkin juice.</p><p align="justify">Harry, like Hermione, didn't say anything. She glanced over at the subdued bespectacled boy, then looked away, struggling to suppress the swelling of emotion in her chest.</p><p align="justify">Harry had never been the same since Hagrid's expulsion years ago. </p><p align="justify">She shook her head. She didn't want to think about the nightmare that had transpired those years ago. No one in Hogwarts could forget the attacks. The terror, the devastation—and the doubt.</p><p align="justify">She'd lived in bone-chilling fear for weeks, wondering every sleepless night if she would be next in line to the Muggle-borns that had been found Petrified in the corridors of the castle.</p><p align="justify">Or if her fate was twisted enough, she could have ended up like Myrtle Warren.</p><p align="justify">Hogwarts had been her home, her haven. To have something you thought was a refuge upturned was... discombobulating, to say the least.</p><p align="justify">And if—<em>if—</em>Riddle had been right, then Hagrid had betrayed her in the worst way possible. She remembered him showing her with relish the egg he'd acquired. </p><p align="justify">The egg that had hatched an Acromantula; the monster responsible for the terrible attacks.</p><p align="justify">Hermione expelled a breath, swigging from her own cup of pumpkin juice. There was no point in dwelling about that now. Riddle had exposed Hagrid, and regardless of Hagrid's innocence, the deed was done. Hagrid was expelled and gone.</p><p align="justify">Only Harry had never forgiven Riddle for it.</p><p align="justify">"So how was working for Riddle on the train like?" Ron asked.</p><p align="justify">"Uh…" Hermione straightened on the bench, grabbing the remains of her buttered toast and finishing it with a hefty bite. Though she knew he would never admit it, Ron envied that she'd obtained her prefect badge at the start of their fifth year. It was something he'd coveted for ages considering many of his siblings had been prefects as well. "Well, he was very polite. Not rude or arrogant at all. He briefed us what to do, and that's about it. Then we all went our separate ways to patrol the train."</p><p align="justify">It was the truth. Riddle had been so gracious, so unlike the quintessential Slytherin, but at the same time brief and matter-of-fact, appearing notably detached from the simpering female prefects. After giving them the necessary instructions, they had all been dismissed to perform their duties, and that was that.</p><p align="justify">"Well, that sounded fun," Ron groused. He was absent-mindedly trying to levitate a cup of coffee over, and Hermione found her temper brewing at his dismal attempts. </p><p align="justify">"Merlin's beard, Ronald!" she exclaimed exasperatedly, irked as she always was by any signs of incompetence. "We were taught this in our first year! How are you failing at the incantation? It's Wingardium Lei‐<em>o‐</em>sa, not Levio-<em>sa.</em>"</p><p align="justify">With that, she waved her own wand emphatically and levitated the cup over towards them with a dexterity he had sorely lacked. It set itself down neatly on the table in front of Ron's reddened face. </p><p align="justify">"Bloody hell, Hermione," he snapped, darting his mortified eyes around the curious onlookers in the Great Hall. "Obviously I know how to perform the charm, I just wasn't paying attention—"</p><p align="justify">"Well, then you should have paid attention," Hermione retorted superciliously. "You're a fifth-year now, Ron! You need to set an example to those younger than us, not display your ineptitude for everyone to—"</p><p align="justify">Her voice died in her throat at the tall, slender boy walking from across them, headed for the exit of the Great Hall. </p><p align="justify">Riddle. </p><p align="justify">He'd finished breakfast, she realised.</p><p align="justify">For a fleeting moment, his bottomless dark eyes met hers, and while frozen, she could have sworn she recognised a glimmer in those irises. </p><p align="justify">Faint amusement.</p><p align="justify">Then the moment was over, and it was like his sidelong glance at the Griffindors' table had never occurred. He continued walking gracefully away, a book held in his hand, seemingly oblivious to the attention he drew from every occupant in the hall.</p><p align="justify">And then he was gone from the Great Hall in a heartbeat, his immaculate emerald-lapelled Slytherin robe billowing softly behind him. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hermione sighed as she made her way towards a wooden table situated in an alcove inside the Hogwarts Library, her arms loaded with a heap of parchment and tomes. Ron was still aggrieved with her over their little spat in the morning, and Harry was awkwardly stuck in the middle, as he often was during their frequent fights. Not wanting to study in the Gryffindor common room with Ron glaring holes into the back of her head, she'd decided on the library to catch up with her studying.</p><p align="justify">She didn't care if it was the start of the school year, that their examinations were still far, far away. If she wanted to continue staying ahead of the curve, she would need to make a head start as she always did. It was evident many students didn't mirror the sentiment judging by the deserted library. </p><p align="justify">Well, it was a bonus in Hermione's opinion. It meant more peace and quiet, and less of the repugnant hanky-panky from other students between the library shelves. Still, she was a prefect now. She could penalise them if she ever caught so much as a whiff of such behaviour. Satisfied by the thought, she dumped her leather-bound books and parchment on the table with a faint groan of relief, and started unravelling them carefully. </p><p align="justify">Hermione had just seated herself comfortably and dipped her quill into her ink bottle when something—only she didn't know what—made her look up and across the rows of dusty tables of the library. </p><p align="justify">The hand holding her quill went rigid.</p><p align="justify">A dark-haired figure sat alone by a table a good distance away from her towards the other side of the library, his own quill held elegantly in his long-fingered hand as he wrote something on a scroll of parchment, a heavy tome opened beside said parchment. </p><p align="justify">Hermione blinked, struggling to make sense of what she was seeing. It was extremely rare to see Tom Riddle without the company of his Slytherin followers, his Head Boy duties notwithstanding. She was aware, of course, that he shared her voracious appetite for reading, and that he visited the library as regularly as she did, but she didn't remember being alone with him before.</p><p align="justify">If he'd noticed her, which he must have unless he was deaf or blind, he exhibited no sign of acknowledgement. It was as if she didn't exist in the room at all. Instead, he merely continued writing on his parchment with clever, confident twists of his fair hand, his charcoal lashes splayed across his pale cheekbones. Intrigued, she noted a signet ring on his middle finger. </p><p align="justify">It was too far away for Hermione to properly make out the scratches on the dark stone of his ring. She considered it incredible that she could tell there were scratches at all.</p><p align="justify">How strange. From what she'd heard, Riddle possessed no distinct heritage in the wizarding world. He did not hail from an aristocratic family. Why, then, did he have a ring? Was it a gift from the Malfoys or the Blacks, perhaps?</p><p align="justify">No. All of Hermione's instincts rioted against that notion. While she did not know Riddle well, she could guess that he did not accept charities from anyone. Maybe it was because of pride, or maybe there was something else. She wasn't sure what.</p><p align="justify">Blinking, she averted her brown eyes to her own parchment. What was she doing anyway, analysing Riddle? She was here to study—nothing else.</p><p align="justify">She did feel slightly confused and perturbed that he hadn't acknowledged her at all, though. He'd been perfectly friendly with her back at the Hogwarts Express when he'd met all the new prefects, had even asked for all of their names and had them introduce themselves so he could welcome them properly.</p><p align="justify">It was a far cry from how he was blatantly ignoring Hermione now. She started writing on her parchment, trying to blot out her tumultuous thoughts. If Ron or Harry was here, she could guess what they would say.</p><p align="justify">"It's because you're a Muggle-born, Hermione!" Ron would hiss. "He's no different from those other Slytherin toerags, after all."</p><p align="justify">That made no sense. If he was prejudiced towards Muggle-borns, why was he always friendly to them? He definitely hadn't been unwelcoming or hostile to her in any way back on the train.</p><p align="justify">Unless it was an act, of course, but she knew she was sounding increasingly paranoid for even thinking so far.</p><p align="justify">Hermione shook her frizzy head, driving her asinine thoughts out. She wasn't here to gain the mysterious Head Boy's favour. </p><p align="justify">She was here to break the records he'd set.</p><p align="justify">The next half an hour passed in silence save for the stabs of quills against parchment, and soon enough, she found herself forgetting about Riddle altogether. Instead, her attention was captured by a single line in her textbook. </p><p align="justify">
  <em> "A bezoar is a stone-like mass taken from the stomach of a goat, that acts as an antidote to most poisons, with a notable exception." </em>
</p><p align="justify">An exception? What exception? She ran a baffled hand through her bushy brown hair, the fingers of her other hand rifling through the sepia pages of the leather-bound tome as she searched for an elaboration.</p><p align="justify">There was none. </p><p align="justify">
  <em> What the…? </em>
</p><p align="justify">Hermione read through the book furiously, even going to the index at the front to check through its content, but she could find none of the answers she sought. She slammed the book shut, then started leafing through her other voluminous books in a frenzy.</p><p align="justify">Nothing. </p><p align="justify">Nothing at all. </p><p align="justify">Hermione slumped against her ladderback chair, staring at her opened, strewn books on the mahogany table in aghast. How could they not contain such a crucial fact? What was she supposed to do if a question about the exception to the bezoar's antidotal properties surfaced in the examination? </p><p align="justify">It was a question she could not afford to lose points on—for all she knew, it might be the one thing she could wield as an edge against the other students! </p><p align="justify">She decided then that she would have to personally ask one of the professors. Perhaps Professor Dumbledore. He seemed the most astute amongst the professors here. </p><p align="justify">Hermione promptly stood up and waved her wand so that all of her books closed and arranged themselves into pristine piles, while the parchment scrolls rolled themselves up. She tucked her wand in her robe and gathered the items up into her arms, then stiffened. </p><p align="justify">She felt it then: an unsettling sensation of being watched.</p><p align="justify">The girl instantly looked across the tables to the other sole occupant of the library. </p><p align="justify">He was still reading his book. It was a different book from before, and his scroll of parchment had been kept away, but he was clearly engrossed by the book he was reading, one aristocratic ringed hand resting idly on the page. </p><p align="justify">In the back of her mind, she marvelled at how rare it was to find someone who possessed the same mental capacity to pore over books for as long as she did. Half an hour was about as long as either Ron or Harry could take.</p><p align="justify">Yet as Riddle read and ignored her, it was just like before: as if she didn't exist to him at all.</p><p align="justify">She squirmed in discomfort, skin flushing. Had she imagined the sensation?</p><p align="justify">Feeling cross with herself and attempting to ignore her erratic heartbeat, she propelled herself to the exit of the library, her arms laden with her belongings.</p><p align="justify">And even despite the return of the disarming sensation of imaginary dark eyes drilling into her back, she continued bolting out of the library without a backwards glance. </p><p align="justify">She didn't dare to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She was still thinking about it even as she patrolled the second floor of the castle that night, her prefect badge shiny and polished on her chest. </p><p align="justify">The bezoar conundrum, that was, <em> not </em>Riddle.</p><p align="justify">None of the professors had materialised at the Great Hall during dinner, and she'd made sure to loiter around even after she'd finished her meal. Eventually, after waiting for eons, she'd given up and headed for Gryffindor Tower to get some rest before she went for her night patrols later.</p><p align="justify">Tempted as she'd been to visit Professor Dumbledore at his office, she knew an academic question wasn't enough to warrant a private visit. It would have been intrusive and unnecessary, and she'd decided wisely that it was best to wait until classes tomorrow before making her enquiries. </p><p align="justify">Examinations were still a long way from now, and she wasn't in a hurry. At least, she told herself she wasn't. It went against her almost irrationally studious nature not to obtain the answers she wanted right away, but she knew it was an internal battle she would have to overcome.</p><p align="justify">Passing through the girls' bathroom on the second floor now, Hermione paused. She was sure she had heard a sound—an indistinct, stifled laugh, maybe. It was already late, way past curfew hours. Narrowing her hazel eyes, she swivelled around and ventured purposefully towards the gloomy entrance of the bathroom, lighting her wand.</p><p align="justify">Upon entering the dark dingy bathroom, the sphere of light at the end of her wand soon illuminated a boy and girl crouched surreptitiously under a basin. They were snuggling with each other and caught in a liplock that frankly repulsed her to her very core. How they found the mood to be amorous with their less-than pleasant surroundings—the floor was uncomfortably damp, the mirrors were cracked, and the wooden doors to the nearby stalls were flaking—she had no idea.</p><p align="justify">But then again, Hermione supposed the alternative meant being separated in their respective dormitories for the night, which was probably worse to them.</p><p align="justify">"Oi, you two!" she barked, and they both jumped, the boy banging his head against the aged sink with a yelp. She dimly recognised them: they were both fourth-years from different houses, but she couldn't remember their names.</p><p align="justify">"It's already eleven and an hour past curfew," Hermione went on, glaring at their defiantly glowering faces. "What in the name of Merlin are you doing here?"</p><p align="justify">The girl, a pretty redhead with blue eyes from Ravenclaw whose name Hermione could not recall, thrust out her chin mutinously.</p><p align="justify">"We just wanted to see each other, is all," she said. "Not breaking the law, innit?"</p><p align="justify">"I don't know about the law, but you both definitely broke curfew," Hermione said tersely. "For that, I'm afraid I'm going to have to give you both detention. And—"</p><p align="justify">"No, don't!" the boy cried, but she interrupted him. </p><p align="justify">"Five points from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff," she announced. "Now go back to your dormitories immediately."</p><p align="justify">The girl looked livid. </p><p align="justify">"You could have just given us detention!" she burst out. "You didn't have to take points off and affect the others—"</p><p align="justify">"I <em> said</em>, go back to your dormitories," Hermione ordered sharply. "If you don't, I'll take off more points."</p><p align="justify">"You—you—<em>bitch!</em>" the girl exclaimed furiously, ignoring her boyfriend's horrified gasp as he tugged desperately at her sleeve. "You think I don't know you, don't you? You're that little know-it-all bitch from Gryffindor. We all know about you. You think you're so clever, but you're just a stuck-up—"</p><p align="justify">A white-hot haze of fury had seized hold of Hermione, and she found herself shaking violently as she spoke again, her voice glacial and laced with rage. "Ten points from Ravenclaw."</p><p align="justify">The redhead lurched inelegantly to her feet, her complexion matching the shade of her hair. </p><p align="justify">"You bloody—" she clamoured, and the haze of fury that consumed Hermione intensified.</p><p align="justify">"Fifteen points from Ravenclaw," she seethed. "Keep talking, and I'll keep taking them off." Unable to stop herself, she said, "And I'll go up to thirty. Double each time."</p><p align="justify">The redhead shut her mouth, her pupils dilated, and then, without any warning at all, she lunged at Hermione, her hands balled into fists. </p><p align="justify">The boy screamed. </p><p align="justify">Hermione might have screamed too, but her throat had clamped up with shock, and all the air seemed to be trapped in her lungs as the redhead loomed over her, pretty features twisted with hate. </p><p align="justify">Hermione stared, and comprehension began to sink into her stupefied mind.</p><p align="justify">The redhead wasn't moving. She was frozen in that position, her hands still balled into fists, her face contorted in that terrible expression, body suspended partially in mid-air. </p><p align="justify">The Freezing Charm, Hermione recognised. </p><p align="justify">Driven by some instinct, the prefect turned her russet head towards the entrance of the lavatory.</p><p align="justify">Tom Riddle stood calmly in the doorway, holding his wand. She gawped at him in disbelief.</p><p align="justify">She hadn't heard him say the incantation, which meant he'd performed a nonverbal spell. She had yet to learn that form of magic until the sixth year (but had been secretly attempting it in her dormitory) and watching it being demonstrated completely took her aback.</p><p align="justify">"R–Riddle," the male Hufflepuff gasped, the colour draining from his face at the appearance of the Head Boy. "Oh no…"</p><p align="justify">The Head Boy's appearance was like cold water being thrown at Hermione as well. She felt abruptly abashed and mortified.</p><p align="justify">Tonight was her first night patrol as a prefect, and she had let her temper get a hold of her, causing things to escalate to the point that a student had tried to attack her.</p><p align="justify">Even if the student had been at fault, she had also been tactless and unrefined in disciplining that student.</p><p align="justify">Soundlessly, Riddle approached the immobilised redhead, those endless dark tunnels for eyes gazing at her frozen face.</p><p align="justify">"I trust you'll be calm when I release you, Miss Clarkson," he murmured quietly in that deep silken baritone, and Hermione realised with a jolt that he remembered her name. "If you choose to kick up any more of a fuss, I'll have no choice but to personally escort you to Professor Flitwick."</p><p align="justify">He didn't move or speak for several drawn-out seconds, letting his words sink in—and letting her consider her options, Hermione thought.</p><p align="justify">Or, she thought again, letting her register who was in power in that instance.</p><p align="justify">Riddle lowered his wand, and just like that, the spell broke, and the redhead collapsed to the wet floor, gasping and trembling. The Hufflepuff boy looked like he wanted to scamper to her side, but his eyes darted from Riddle's patrician, inexpressive features to the redhead.</p><p align="justify">"Please return to your dormitories now," Riddle said softly. "I will speak to both of you myself tomorrow. For now, you'll find Clearwater outside—she will escort you both to your dormitories."</p><p align="justify">There was a pause, and both the redhead and the boyfriend exchanged stricken glances at each other. Hermione understood why; after what they had just done, especially attempting to assault a prefect, there ought to be more repercussions.  </p><p align="justify">Yet all Riddle had said was that he would speak to them personally the next day. Somehow that came off more disturbing. </p><p align="justify">It made what awaited them all the more nebulous.</p><p align="justify">"Is there a problem?" Riddle said vaguely, with distant interest. </p><p align="justify">"No, no!" Both boy and girl shook their heads frantically, before scrambling together in unrehearsed tandem for the exit of the lavatory, their footfalls echoing raucously across the walls.</p><p align="justify">And then, for the second time today, she found herself alone with Tom Riddle.</p><p align="justify">He said nothing even as those black holes for eyes settled upon her, and she stared back, looking at the sleek raven hair, the milky-white, angular features of his handsome face, the hollowed cheeks, and the pale sculpted mouth. He was so immaculate, so put together, so elegant, that she felt frizzier than ever looking at him, with her bushy hair, pink cheeks, and the turbulent emotions rampaging through her too-tight chest.</p><p align="justify">She began fumbling to break the godawful silence.</p><p align="justify">"I should have done that better," Hermione said, folding her hands primly together to compose herself. "I lost my temper. I apologise."</p><p align="justify">She had also overdone it with the number of points she had deducted. As a prefect, she knew there was a threshold to the number of points she could deduct.</p><p align="justify">He continued looking at her, and Hermione's heart suddenly stuttered in her ribs. It was hard to tell in the dimness of the light because of the few candles lit inside the bathroom—and because her wand had been extinguished and Riddle hadn't illuminated his—but she could have sworn that the very corners of his pale lips were lifted upwards. </p><p align="justify">
  <em> Was he… smiling? </em>
</p><p align="justify">Then he canted his dark head sideways so that the entirety of his regal face came out of the shadows and into the candlelight, and she saw there was no smile at all. His countenance was placid and emotionless.</p><p align="justify">She furrowed her brows. She must had imagined it.</p><p align="justify">"We all make mistakes for the first time," Riddle said quietly. "There is no need to apologise. I know I've made a fair share of my own."</p><p align="justify">Somehow, Hermione doubted that. </p><p align="justify">Inadvertently, a stray thought came to her head, and she squared her shoulders, half-wondering if she should go ahead with her sudden idea.</p><p align="justify">What was the harm? she pondered. The worst case scenario would simply be that he didn't know.</p><p align="justify">"Can I ask you something, Riddle?" Hermione asked breathlessly.</p><p align="justify">A single dark eyebrow rose.</p><p align="justify">"You may," Riddle said, and this time she was sure of the amusement in his obsidian eyes.</p><p align="justify">"I would just like to know," Hermione went on eagerly, "if you happen to know what the exception to the bezoar's antidotal properties is. It seems it cures most poisons save for an exception."</p><p align="justify">There was a moment, and Riddle stared hard at her, seemingly enraptured for reasons she could not fathom. When he spoke again, however, his voice was quiet and unassuming; at odds with the glint in his eyes.</p><p align="justify">"There is more than one exception," he said.</p><p align="justify">"Well, could you give me an example of one?" Hermione probed impatiently. Then, discovering that she might be coming off rude, she flushed, then said in her own most deferential tone, "Only if you're all right with it, of course. I know you're doing me a favour, and I appreciate it."</p><p align="justify">"Not at all," Riddle said softly, but she could feel those dark, dark eyes searching her face and making her feel quite bare. "If you'd like an example, I can give you one… such as venom, Miss Granger."</p><p align="justify">"Venom? Like what, from a spider?"</p><p align="justify">"No," he said. He enunciated his words slowly. "Something else."</p><p align="justify">"I don't—" Hermiome was bewildered and frustrated. "Look here, how did you find the answer? I read all the books I could get my hands on, and I didn't find anything of the—"</p><p align="justify">"If you want to learn, Miss Granger," Riddle said quietly, "it won't be enough to read what is given to you. You will need to push…"</p><p align="justify">"Push—?" Hermione's bewilderment mounted. </p><p align="justify">"Push the boundaries of your imagination," he said, with a little gleam in those pitless black eyes. "You will need to step further than where you stand. You will have to step outside the box, Miss Granger..." </p><p align="justify">What? What the hell did that mean?</p><p align="justify">He observed his wand held in his ringed hand, and then looked back up to smile politely at her.</p><p align="justify">"I apologise," he said. "It's late. You should return to your patrol now."</p><p align="justify">"What?" Hermione was thrown. "Wait! You haven't told me—"</p><p align="justify">"If you'd like to know more, I will tell you more," he said, with a half-smile. "But tonight, you will need to finish your patrol. I'm afraid duty awaits, Miss Granger—for both of us. I have work to do as well."</p><p align="justify">Hermione faltered, but reality set in. He was not obliged to help her in the first place. She was the one that had botched how she had handled the situation tonight, and now she was pestering him to tutor her instead of resuming her job.</p><p align="justify">"I'm sorry," she said, biting her lip, feeling most displeased with herself. "I… I'll go."</p><p align="justify">"Don't be sorry," Riddle assured her smoothly, with a sudden warm, kind smile that made her flush—nothing like the curious smile she thought she'd seen him wear in the shadows earlier. "I appreciate your efforts, Miss Granger."</p><p align="justify">She didn't say anything. She couldn't. </p><p align="justify">She left the toilet instead, feeling the sensation of dark eyes drilling holes into her back. </p><p align="justify">This time, she knew for sure that it was not her imagination. </p>
