    <p> </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: Forest of Dean                                                         <br/><br/><br/><u></u></strong>Hermione closed her eyes and takes a deep breath, holds it in for a few seconds, before exhaling slowly. Keeping her eyes closed, she listened to the soft rustling of the leaves in the trees surrounding her, feeling the grass underneath her hands, as she leaned back. She’s going to miss this place. However, it had been a good decision, to come here. She was in desperate need of some alone time.<br/><br/>These last couple of months have been hectic as hell. She scoffed at that though. Months? More like <em>years</em>. After all, things have been hectic since she started Hogwarts when she was eleven. At first, it was a good kind of hectic, you know? Learning all these new things, learning all about magic. She still remembered being <em>so</em> excited to learn all she could about the wizarding world. Really, who wouldn’t be excited.<br/><br/>When she had just turned twelve, after being at Hogwarts for only two months, she came face to face with the first of many dangers the magical world held. A Mountain Troll of all things, she had never been as scared in her life! It only kept getting more hectic after that. From being literally petrified, to going back in time to help a criminal escape, who apparently hadn’t done anything wrong, to watching loved ones die. By the time she was 18, she had seen it all, or so she thought. At the time, she couldn’t imagine anything worse than seeing her friends and classmates die, during the last battle with Voldemort. The Battle of Hogwarts, they had named it. How wrong she was.<br/><br/>It was only two months ago, but it feels like it was yesterday. She had just finished her last N.E.W.T., when she was called to the Headmistress’ office. Honestly, Hermione didn’t really think anything of it, her mind still at the last test.<br/><br/>While walking towards the office, however, she got a bad feeling in her gut. A feeling she knew all too well. Has something happened? No, surely not. Not after everything that’s happened. It’s been quiet for over a year now. Shrugging off the bad feeling, she continued climbing the stairs to the third floor.<br/><br/>Hermione should’ve trusted her gut. Not that it would have mattered, but how could she have ignored it? It had helped her stay alive all these years. Making sure she made it home. Home. That word alone brought the tears back to her eyes. No. She was <em>not</em> going to cry again. She’s cried so much already. But thinking of home. She didn’t have a home anymore. Who could’ve thought this would happen? And because of a house fire, of all things. In a world where there’s magic and so many impossibilities, it was something as mundane as a house fire? <br/><br/>The only comfort in all this, was that her parents didn’t suffer. Or so she was told. If only that would lessen the pain she’s feeling, because it hurts so bad. She should’ve been home, she would have been able to save her parents, she was sure of it. <br/><br/>Hermione shook her head. No! Enough of that. Moping wouldn’t bring them back. Neither was feeling sorry for herself. Which is why she came here, to the Forest of Dean. Even though she only came here once with her parents, it still felt appropriate. The forest was so peaceful. Which helped tremendously with her grieving. <br/><br/>Right. That’s enough of that, she told herself as she stood up. Raising her arms, she stretched her back. Hermione looked up, noticing the darkening sky. “It’s getting late, I should probably go eat something,” she murmured.<br/>She walked to the tent and moved the front flap to the side before walking in. It’s not quite like the one they were using while hunting Horcruxes, just a bit smaller, but spacious all the same. <br/><br/>She grabbed her bag and put her arm in, feeling for the separate bag she used for food. Her mind wandered again, this time towards the future. Now, fresh out of school, she would have to go look for a job. Only, she wasn’t entirely sure what she wanted to do. Before her parents had died, she had it all planned out, but... Everything is just different, now. She’d probably end up at the Ministry, that would be the most logical choice, wouldn’t it?<br/><br/>Nodding to herself, she let out a soft “Aha!” as she finally found the bag she was looking for. She probably should organize the contents of her bag before leaving. As she’s making her dinner, she heard a loud growl. She looked down at her stomach sheepishly. Yeah, she probably should’ve had some lunch as well. She totally forgot about that. Continuing to prep her dinner, she made a mental note to make sure she doesn’t skip any meals anymore.<br/><br/>After eating dinner, she started packing up most of her belongings that are strewn all over. Tonight would be the last night in the forest. Ginny’s birthday is coming up in a couple of days and she still had to get her a present. She promised to stay for a few nights, as Ginny said she was in desperate need of some girl-time. All the boys were driving her insane.<br/><br/>Which brought her to the next issue, because it’d probably be a bit awkward, seeing as she broke it off with Ron during her last school year. As it turned out, their ‘relationship’ was more of a ‘heat of the moment’ kind of thing. That’s how Ron called it in his letter. Being apart probably didn’t really help either. Both Harry and Ron decided they wouldn’t be returning to school to finish their last year and had decided to start working as Aurors instead. While Ron didn’t mention it in his letters, Harry was kind enough to let her know Ron apparently had a lot of ‘admirers’ and wasn’t against acting on it. It’s probably for the best that they remain friends and go their own way. <br/><br/>Looking around in the tent, she’s satisfied with the packing she had gotten done. Hermione checked her watch and mumbled a soft curse. She really needed to go to sleep, if she wanted to get an early start tomorrow. She walked to the front of the tent and closed the front, making sure it was secured properly. Hermione then walked to her sleeping cot, changing into her sleepwear. She put out the small flame in the lantern that was on the bedside table, encasing the tent in darkness. <br/><br/><br/><br/>-<br/><br/><br/><br/>The following morning, Hermione packed the last of her possessions, while making a mental inventory of the contents of her bag.<br/><br/>“Hm, I might as well stock up on some potion ingredients, if I’m going to Diagon Alley,” she said to herself.<br/><br/>“Okay, so first Gringotts, then it’s best to go to Slug &amp; Jiggers Apothecary. Maybe I’ll drop by Wizards Wheezes as well. Hm,” Hermione mumbled to herself, while grabbing her wand. She looked around, giving it one last look to make sure she had packed everything, before leaving the tent. With a few flicks of her wand, the tent shrunk down to a small package, fitting in her bag without a hitch.<br/><br/>She glanced around in the forest. She was almost sad to leave. The forest had become a safe haven for her, it always would be, really. Slinging the strap of her bag over her shoulder, she gave it one last glance, before apparating away with a soft <em>pop</em>, not leaving a single trace behind.<br/><br/>Hermione appeared in an alleyway, seconds later. Walking out onto Charing Cross Road, she spotted the Leaky Cauldron across the street almost immediately. As she entered the pub, she smiled at Tom. He greeted her with a nod, as she walked by. Opening the backdoor, she revealed the entrance to Diagon Alley. It wouldn’t matter how many times she came here; it would always remind her of the giddy feeling she felt when she first came here.<br/><br/>Making her way to Gringotts, she steeled herself before opening walking in. The Goblins still weren’t too happy with her after the stunt she pulled with Harry and Ron last year. Holding her head high, she walked up to the currency exchange counter. She took out some of the money she withdrew from her parents’ bank account, requesting an exchange for wizarding money.<br/><br/>With her money pouch filled with coins, she made her way outside, turning towards the Apothecary. Grabbing a basket, she browsed the shelves, grabbing the needed items as she went. Satisfied with what she had collected, she went to the register to pay, thanking the cashier on her way out. Next on the list is Wizard Wheezes, Hermione thought to herself, as she walked towards the brightly coloured building. <br/><br/>“Mornin’ George,” Hermione greeted as she enters the shop.<br/><br/>“Blimey, Hermione! Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes!” George joked as he walked around the counter to give her a hug. “Decided you couldn’t live without me, eh?”<br/><br/>“Yes, of course, George. My life wouldn’t be complete without you,” she joked back, while giving him a soft shove.<br/><br/>“No, thought not,” he grinned. “Anyways, what can I do for you this fine morning?”<br/><br/>“Actually, I came to ask if you have any idea what to get Ginny. Maybe she’s told you if there’s anything she wished for?’ Hermione asked as George walked back to the other side of the counter.<br/><br/>George shrugged. “Not that I can recall, though she’s always going on and on about our Quidditch equipment back home, so maybe that’s something you can look into?”<br/><br/>“Hm, yes, I actually thought that’d be my best bet. Thanks, George,” she smiled. “While I’m here, anything you recommend I should get?”<br/><br/>A grin formed on his lips again, “Of course, ‘Mione! Changed your opinion about the shop, did you? Well, come on then, let’s see what we can find for you.” He said, guiding her upstairs. “How about some Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder? Can’t hurt to have some of that on you.” <br/><br/>“Actually, that’s not a bad idea,” Hermione agreed. “I’ll take a few of those, then. Oh! And a pair of Extendable Ears as well, please. I think that’s all for now.”<br/><br/>“Alright, one pair of Extendable Ears coming right up. I’ll throw in a few Ton-Tongue Toffees as well, just for the fun of it.” George said as he packed all the items. “That’ll be three Galleons and five Sickles.”<br/><br/>As Hermione tried to object, George put his hand up, “No, ‘Mione, don’t argue with me on this one. If you do, I’ll give it to you for free.” He stated.<br/><br/>She swallowed her objection and gave him the money, “Just this once then, George. Next time I don’t want a discount, though. I’m perfectly able to pay full price.<br/><br/>“We’ll see,” he said with a smile and winked at her. “Well, thanks for shopping at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes!”<br/><br/>Hermione laughed, “Sure, sure. I’ll see you later, George.” She gave him a wave as she left the store, crossing the road to look for an appropriate gift at Quality Quidditch Supplies.<br/><br/>After about half an hour of browsing, she decided on getting Ginny a new pair of Quidditch gloves. Paying for her purchase, she made her way to the last store on her list. Flourish and Blotts, she was in desperate need of some new books. Maybe one on transformations. She didn’t know nearly enough about Metamorphmagi and it would definitely help, seeing as young Teddy inherited the ability from his mother and she wouldn’t be able to teach him. It might even give her some insight on Animagi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-<br/><br/><br/><br/>It was in the early afternoon when Hermione finally made it to the Weasleys family home. And of course, it had to be Ron who opened the door for her.<br/><br/>“Um, hi,” he said rather awkwardly.<br/><br/>“Hi, Ronald,” Hermione responded politely. She was quite proud of herself for keeping her voice level. She stopped right in front of him, waiting for him to let her pass. A few seconds passed, before she raised her eyebrows, looking at him expectantly.<br/><br/>“OH, right! Yes, um, sorry, come in, ‘Mione,” he said, while stepping to the side, allowing her to slip inside.<br/><br/>As Ron closed the door, she turned to look at him, opening her mouth to say something, but drawing a blank when she made eye contact. They kept looking at each other, until a loud bang is heard from upstairs. They both jumped at the sound. While it <em>is</em> still awkward to stand next to Ron like this, it did somewhat help dissipate the strange atmosphere that surrounded them.<br/><br/>“I, um, I promised Mum to help in the backyard, so, I’m just gonna... Yeah, I’m just gonna go.” Hermione didn’t even have a chance to respond, watching Ron fleeing the room. Shaking her head, she made her way upstairs to Ginny’s room. They agreed beforehand that she would be staying in her room.<br/><br/>She didn’t bother knocking, they’re both girls, after all. But she should have. She <em>definitely </em>should have. <br/><br/>“<em>Merlin’s beard!</em>” She exclaimed, covering her eyes. “Sorry! I’m so sorry! I- uh, yeah, bye!” She really didn’t need to see that part of Harry. At all. Closing the door, she turned around and bumps into George. <br/><br/>“Oh! I’m sorry, I didn’t see you!”<br/><br/>George chuckled, “Well, I don’t suppose you would be able to, covering your eyes like that. You alright, ‘Mione? I heard a shout.”<br/><br/>Hermione blushed, “Um, yes, I- that was me. I just saw... Never mind. I’m just- Wait, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at your shop?”<br/><br/>He smiled, “Nah, closed the shop for a week. I’m entitled to some vacation time as well, aren’t I?” <br/><br/>She frowned and raised an eyebrow, not really believing his reasoning, but decided to let it go. “Right, well, I’m going to get a cup of tea, so...”<br/><br/>“Cup of tea? Sounds good.” George interrupted. “Maybe we should ask Ginny as well, I’m sure you two have got a lot of catching up to do.” She really didn’t like the mischievous look in his eye. Surely, he wouldn’t. Of <em>course</em> he would. How could she think otherwise, he was a prankster after all.<br/><br/>“George, don’t. Wait!’ She tried to stop him, as he reached around Hermione to open the door to Ginny’s room. He didn’t get the chance to open the door, as Ginny already pulled it open.<br/><br/>“You two do realize w- I mean, <em>I</em> can hear everything you’re saying out here, right? You aren’t exactly being quiet.” She huffed. <br/><br/>“Why, little sister, you look a bit-”<br/><br/>“Do <em>not</em> finish that sentence, George!” Ginny crossed her arms, blocking the way to her room. “Besides, I heard you say something about tea? Let’s go, then. I’d like a cup.” She closed her door, not giving her brother a chance to walk inside and ushered George towards the stairway.<br/><br/>“Alright, alright, I’m going.” He said, before shouting “COMING, HARRY?” <br/><br/>“<em>GEORGE!</em>” <br/><br/>Hermione sighed as she shook her head. Honestly. She heard a door slowly opening, and watched Harry trying to sneak out of Ginny’s room, freezing when he saw her.<br/><br/>“Uh, hi ‘Mione” he greeted, rubbing the back of his head.<br/><br/>“Hey Harry, glad to see you’re dressed.” She joked while sporting a blush, watching as a blush  also spread across his face. “Come on, you might as well join us downstairs.” She heard Harry sigh, before following her.<br/><br/>After they had tea, she dumped her bag in Ginny’s room. George did have a point; they <em>did</em> have a lot of catching up to do. She hadn’t seen Ginny since she left school after hearing the devastating news of her parents’ deaths.<br/><br/>It was actually quite nice to be able to talk to someone about this. While the forest helped tremendously with finding her peace, it was quite lonesome. They talked well into the night, until Hermione couldn’t stop yawning. <br/><br/>“Right, I think it’s time we turn in,” Hermione laughed, “we’ll have plenty of time tomorrow.”<br/><br/>“Which is good, because I think it’s time I tell you all about Harry and I.”<br/><br/>Hermione threw her face into her pillow and groaned. “Really, Ginny?”<br/><br/>“Yep, you’re not getting out of this one!” Ginny started laughing, even when dodging the pillow Hermione threw at her. “Besides, it’s my birthday in two days. You have to be nice to me, so you have no choice but to do this for me.”<br/><br/>Hermione groaned again. She wanted Ginny to be able to talk to her about this, but she wasn’t sure if she was able to handle talking about this when it concerned Harry.<br/><br/>“Merlin, help me.” </p>
