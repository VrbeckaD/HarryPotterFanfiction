    <p>Peter floated away from the window of the three children, being careful to avoid his shadow. Tink, being the annoying little devil that she is, starts to make noise, therefore attracting that attention of his shadow.</p>
<p>“FUCKING HELL TINK!”</p>
<p>Tink, also known as the most annoying fairy in the world, just stuck her tongue out at him. As his shadow got closer, Peter let go of all the glamour's, the ones that hid his true, monstrous appearance. For his shadow wasn't actually his shadow, it was part of a race called the galajed. The galajed were a cruel race that preyed on magical children, much like obscurials, but instead of using the children's magic, they tried to take their souls. </p>
<p>The galajed, the one that was about to take Peter’s soul, let out a very high pitched scream and scampered away. </p>
<p>“Really Tom? Everytime I swear.” Tink, formerly known as Tom Marvelo Riddle, Big bad voldie, MoldyShorts, the big bad wolf, H. H. Holmes, Roden, Alice, and Swiper, just shrugged uncaringly. </p>
<p>Peter, because now he was Peter, not Harry, not Jaevid, not Sage, not Adrian, not Jasper, not Reguls, and not Grindelwald, scoffed. Internally, though, he was exhilarated. It had been so long since he had let his wings out and up in the air.</p>
<p>“Well, what are you waiting for darling? Let's go.” And Peter (though he looked more Harry than anything) flew off.</p>
<p>Tink followed, happy to go back to their home. Neverland.</p>
