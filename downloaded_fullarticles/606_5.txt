    <p>Martha Jones worked for UNIT, she was sent to work briefly with Torchwood Three. She knew Jack as they once spent a whole year together, the team knew that.<br/>
What they didn't know was Ianto and Martha spent 7 years together.<br/>
<br/>
Ianto Jones was the infamous Slytherin who attended Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was known for his mischief and many feared him.<br/>
Of course, he was not alone in this mischief. He had a close friend who was with him, every step of the way.<br/>
Martha Jones was also a Slytherin in Hogwarts. She was known as the 'accomplice'.<br/>
Together they wrecked havok and made almost every teachers lives hell.<br/>
But, life was fun.<br/>
<br/>
After the wizarding war, where Ianto and Martha both fought against the Death Eaters and were overjoyed when Voldemort was killed, despite their reputation as extremely proud Slytherins. They both retreated into the Muggle world.<br/>
Martha went to Medical School and became a Doctor after briefly travelling with THE Doctor. While Ianto joined Torchwood One in London.<br/>
After the battle of Canary Wharf, Ianto joined Torchwood Three and was soon accepted as part of the team.<br/>
<br/>
This was a brief history of the two, the closest friends there were. They shared everything and after many years where their only form of communication was an owl, and, unbeknownst to either of them, a reunion was soon to come.<br/>
They were both happy.<br/>
<br/>
When Jack called Martha in to help with Torchwood, they both hid it well but afterwards they had a movie night and talked about everything they had been up to in the 5 years they went without contact.<br/>
<br/>
A week after Martha was called to help with Torchwood Three, something happened.<br/>
<br/>
The team were coming back from rounding up a few weevils. They all reached for the door handles on the SUV at the same time. This set off the first alarm.<br/>
At the speed of light, the car disappeared, along with the six people holding onto it.<br/>
A second later, they were standing in the middle of a graveyard, the car nowhere to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Ianto and Martha laughed, Ianto said "it's like 5th year all over again!"<br/>
Martha nodded in agreement. <br/>
<br/>
"What the FUCK is going on??" Owen bellowed, bringing the two out of their laughing fit.<br/>
<br/>
Before anybody could get a word in, the figure of a small man appeared from behind a gravestone.<br/>
<br/>
"Ianto, Martha, how excellent it is to see you again!"<br/>
Ianto smirked, Martha held a look of disgust, while the rest of the team looked at eachother in confusion.<br/>
"Yeah, wish I could say the same Wormtail." Ianto mumbled, a crooked smile contoured on his lips.<br/>
"You got it?" He whispered the Martha.<br/>
The woman reached into her pocket and pulled out a long stick, while Ianto did the same.<br/>
"Always." She replied.<br/>
<br/>
"Anybody want to fill us in!" Gwen shouted, causing Tosh to jump back in suprise.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes Ianto, my young prince, you want to inform your little pets into our deepest secrets?" The man known as Wormtail, suggested with the grin that was far to big for his face.<br/>
<br/>
Ianto and Martha shared a worried look, before they both nodded and rushed to the Torchwood Team.<br/>
<br/>
"We have to keep them safe" Martha whispered angrily to Ianto.<br/>
"Don't you think I fucking know that" The young man replied, with the same amount of anger in his voice.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath and said to the team.<br/>
<br/>
"You four HAVE to stay hidden!"<br/>
"Not matter what happens." Martha stated.<br/>
"Stay hidden!" Ianto finished.<br/>
<br/>
"Ianto? Martha?" Jack asked, fear laced his voice.<br/>
"Not now Jack." Was all Martha said to him.<br/>
"We'll tell you everything at the hub, that is-" Ianto stopped, unable to finish his sentence.<br/>
"If we survive this." Martha finished.<br/>
<br/>
The two took a few shakey breaths.<br/>
<br/>
"No, tell us now. Teaboy, you have no power over us. Now tell us what the FUCK is going on." Owen was almost shouting at the end of his sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Before Martha could shout at the idiotic man who was shouting at the man who had saved his life, Ianto had spun around and struck the smaller man as he raised his stick.<br/>
(Of course by 'struck' I mean the light coming out of his respective stick disarmed him.)<br/>
<br/>
"Now hide for Merlins sake!" Martha was telling now.<br/>
<br/>
She guided the group to a larger gravestone as she held out her stick, pointed it at the group and yelled;<br/>
<br/>
"PROTEGO HORRIBILIS!" <strong>(A/N a protection spell)</strong><br/>
She held her position for a few seconds before she felt the spell had been completed.<br/>
<br/>
"Stay here, don't move. This is where you are safest."<br/>
She paused<br/>
"If you see me or Yan go down. Stay there. It's our job to protect you. So, Stay there."<br/>
<br/>
She ran towards Wormtail before anybody could respond.</p>
