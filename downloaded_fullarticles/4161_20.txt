          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius Black might have been a fighter.<br/>
A fighter in not giving up, in keeping going, in not breaking.<br/>
But all in all, Sirius's life was a fight and it teached him. He fought constantly, not always for his life, but fighting nonetheless. </p><p>Remus Lupin knew he was made a monster.<br/>
Not every monster was born one, but some were made.<br/>
He's a monster in ripping on life itself, he was a monster with that monthly urge to kill.<br/>
The monster teached him pain and despair, and Remus tried to teach it love. He's pretty sure he failed, there's no love in breaking furniture apart. </p><p>Sirius and Remus were quite the pair.<br/>
Remus licked Sirius's battle scars, while Sirius teached Remus's monster about love. </p><p>The moment Sirius was gone, there wasn't much left to love for a monster.<br/>
Left alone in a pack of none. </p><p>What heroes they used to be.</p></div>
