    <p>“Is she really here on her own?”</p><p>The question catches your attention above the buzz of conversation which fills the room and you close over your book. You can't concentrate on Hogwarts: A History knowing that at least one person is probably watching you right now, and that you'd have gotten less attention if you'd found a park bench to sleep on.</p><p>But wanting a distraction had been why you'd come down here, and although it's annoying, it's nothing you're not used to. The last three days have been the same. Somebody inevitably approaches your table and tries to initiate a conversation with you, tries to find out why you're here alone, regardless of how cold your glare is.</p><p>“She’s old enough,” Tom the barman says as he dries a tankard with the towel draped over his shoulder. “What are you after?”</p><p>You grit your teeth as the wizard at the bar glances over at you again, deciding you’ll hex him if he says anything else about you. What does it matter if you’d be expelled from school for it? Being the centre of attention is making you antsy. </p><p>But the wizard returns to his friends, giving you one less thing to think about, one less thing to distract you from what brought you here, to a pub, at Christmas.</p><p>Something flickers in your chest. Guilt, maybe, or anger. But it’s only directed at yourself. It was your decision to leave school, your decision to walk out of the house. Your fault your uncle was angry.</p><p>“Can I sit there?”</p><p>You start when you hear the voice and look up to see who’s blocking the heat from the fire, prepared to tell the wizard from the bar to get lost, but your mouth goes dry when you see that it’s Sirius Black.</p><p>“Can I?” He asks, indicating the empty chair beside you. “There’s nowhere else to sit.”</p><p>Somehow you manage to nod, years of ignoring your feelings finally coming in useful. It’s this practice which enables you to sit at the same table as the man who’s more or less responsible for your problems without ripping his head off or inflicting as much pain on him as you suffered five years ago in Diagon Alley.</p><p>You force in a breath, and tell yourself to get over it. It’s not like Sirius knows who you are or what happened. Nobody does because you’ve never spoken of it. </p><p>He unzips his leather jacket but doesn’t remove it, and it's then you notice the scars on his hands, the dirt under his nails, the same exhaustion on his face which is evident on every single person who survived the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p> It’s not only from the horror of that day, but from the nightmares and the survivor’s guilt because so many people didn’t make it.</p><p>“I’m Sirius,” he says, offering you a hand.</p><p>You’ve heard stories about him, of course. You don’t just know him from the aged wanted posters which were around when you first visited the wizarding world. You know about his pureblood family which disowned him, about his closeness with James Potter and the legend they left behind at Hogwarts. But that man isn’t the one sitting at your table: that man is gone. This version of Sirius is war-worn and betrayed and battle-hardened, and radiates guilt like heat from the fire beside you, so intense you can’t bring yourself to tell him he’s the reason your mother is dead.</p><p>“I’m not,” you reply.</p><p>A hint of a smile appears on his face. “Do you always pun on people’s names?”</p><p>“I do when the occasion presents itself.”</p><p>Sirius laughs. “Wait till you meet Remus, then. You’ll have a field day.”</p><p>You’re momentarily distracted from your situation, because you know of only one Remus, and that’s Remus Lupin, your Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. It’s common knowledge that he’s a werewolf, that his impact on Harry Potter is the reason there’s a law named after him which aims to get work for people affected by lycanthropy, and that at least half the female population of the school are planning on sending him cards on Valentine's Day.</p><p>You'd be lying if you said you didn't understand the appeal, but you like your classes too much to join in with their fawning.</p><p>“Are you talking about Professor Lupin?” You ask, determined to come across as casual, and not overly interested. </p><p>“You’re his student?”</p><p>“He’s a good teacher.”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes. “Don’t let him hear you say that. One day back at teaching and he’s prouder than a hippogriff. All he does is bang on about his classes.”</p><p>“He doesn’t seem proud,” you say. The idea is hard to accept. Every time you’ve seen your teacher around school, you’ve always gotten the impression that he’s trying to blend in with the walls.</p><p>“Oh he is,” Sirius assures you. “You’re lucky you don’t live with him… Speak of the werewolf.” He nods towards the door.</p><p>Despite his opinions, there’s a hint of fondness to Sirius’ voice and for the first time in days, you find yourself smiling.</p><p>“Get it?”</p><p>You watch as Lupin approaches your table, in his usual well-worn green suit and patched, fraying robes of the same colour. </p><p>“Hilarious,” he says, then he gives you a smile. “Hello, Y/N.”</p><p>You notice that there a few more scars on his already marked face, but he’s lost the starved, sickly appearance which was present at the start of term.</p><p>“Hi,” you say, your face heating up when you realise how high-pitched your voice has gone. </p><p>Lupin, however, doesn’t comment, and sits down beside Sirius.</p><p>“I found a student who doesn’t like you,” he declares, nudging you with his elbow. “Right?”</p><p>Lupin frowns at you. </p><p>“I said nothing of the sort,” you assure him hurriedly, then decide to retaliate. “Sirius said your ego’s too big.”</p><p>“He’s one to talk about egos,” Lupin replies, directing his frown at his friend. “When he’s drunk, he believes inanimate objects insult him.”</p><p>“Those stairs called me fat and you know it,” Sirius retorts haughtily, and you laugh.</p><p>Then the conversation lapses and they both look at you.</p><p>“Are you waiting for someone?” Sirius asks.</p><p>You consider lying. You don’t want either of them to know about what happened, especially Lupin. He could very easily go to the school board or Ministry about this, and you don't want to think about what they'd have to say about your situation. </p><p>You shudder at the thought.</p><p>“No,” you say. Lying would involve effort, and not blurting out the whole story already takes enough. “I’m staying here until school starts again.”</p><p>They exchange glances, and Lupin’s brow furrows as he looks at you again. </p><p>“Don’t you have family to stay with?” He asks.</p><p>“I do. I just don’t want to stay with them.”</p><p>Another glance.</p><p>“Did something happen?” Sirius asks.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>You make extra sure that you don’t avoid eye contact, don’t fidget, don’t blink too much. Any of that could mean them accepting your answer, or not.</p><p>“Then why did you leave school?” Lupin asks. “If you didn’t want to stay with your parents?”</p><p>“I changed my mind." You shrug. “I missed the school.”</p><p>You look at him since he’s the one who asked the question, but you can tell he’s suspicious, that he doesn’t quite believe you, and you sit with bated breath, waiting for him to say he’ll have to report this to McGonagall. </p><p>But he doesn’t. </p><p>“You could come back with us,” he says eventually. “I’ll owl Professor McGonagall. I’m sure she’ll have no reservations about allowing you back early.”</p><p>Why isn’t he interrogating you? Why isn’t he forcing you to talk?</p><p>“She wouldn’t be annoyed that I went home and came back so quickly?” </p><p>“You’re a good student,” Lupin replies as he stands. “She’ll understand.”</p><p>You watch as he leaves the room, wondering if he knows more than he’s letting on.</p>
