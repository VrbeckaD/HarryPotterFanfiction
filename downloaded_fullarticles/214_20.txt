    <p>Theseus says that a vampire attacked him, one that lives in the Capitol. And there’s no reason not to believe him, Newt knows Theseus would never lie to him, but the first thing he remembers (and the only one) after waking up in the house, with his brother’s face on his chest, is himself offering his wrist to a vampire.</p>
<p>But of course, he’s dizzy and weak and Theseus just saved his life by giving him some of his own blood in a transfusion, so it’s normal to be confused.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since vampires took over the world and even though all his family believes they’re heartless monsters, Newt still thinks there are some that are not precisely evil.</p>
<p>He wants to believe the ones in charge are the problem, that not all vampires agree with using humans as slaves.</p>
<p>They all have to pay tribute to them, all humans, as soon as they turn 21, they have to give his blood every week to a vampire that needs it. It’s mandatory, even though humans have managed to develop synthetic blood for them.</p>
<p>No one wants that and humans are there to serve anyway.</p>
<p>All members of Newt’s family have to “donate” their blood if they want to keep their house and their place outside the Capitol.</p>
<p>But not Newt, he’s just 16 and he doesn’t know yet how that world works, but he’s aware of what happens behind the doors that lead to the Capitol, at least he knows what Theseus has told him.</p>
<p>That place is only for vampire elite and their beloved slaves/pets (humans that have been purposely selected to please them in every way).</p>
<p>Sounds terrible and Newt has learned to be scared of that place, but he still thinks there’s hope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life seems to want to crash that hope, for when Newt turns 18 his mother is murdered; vampires don’t like to call it a murder, to them it was an unfortunate accident.</p>
<p>“You fucking demons!” Theseus spits at the vampires that bring their mother’s body. Newt tries to calm his brother even though his own heart is breaking.</p>
<p>Their father falls to his knees and starts crying over her body. She’s pale, there’s no more blood in her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the vampires are too bored to be angry at Theseus.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it happens, she was probably too hungry and couldn’t stop… The employees didn’t realize until it was too late.”</p>
<p>Newt has to hug his brother in order to stop him from jumping at their throat.</p>
<p>“She could’ve turned her,” Theseus says through gritted teeth. “To save our mother.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t want her as mate,” one of the vampires points out. “She wasn’t going to sacrifice herself just for a–”</p>
<p>“Thank you for informing us,” Newt mumbles, holding his brother, although he’s started to feel quite devastated himself.</p>
<p>The vampires seem to notice him then, one of them grins, fangs visible behind his lips.</p>
<p>“Are you a donor, beautiful?”</p>
<p>Theseus growls at them and pushes Newt behind himself; they seem to find it amusing.</p>
<p>“He’s only 18.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pity,” says the other vampire, winking at him. “I guess we’ll see each other in a couple of years then.”</p>
<p>When they’re gone, Newt holds back the tears while Theseus presses their foreheads together. Their father is still crying with their mother in his arms, Newt tries not to listen to his pain.</p>
<p>“I have to go,” Theseus mumbles, making Newt shiver. “I gotta find them so we can be free.”</p>
<p>“You’re not sure this community of hunters actually exists, ‘Seus” Newt sobs, desperate. He knows his brother has always believed in them. In these people that somehow managed to live in the forest and have turned themselves in vampire hunters.</p>
<p>He also knows that the only reason Theseus has stayed is because Newt asked him to. His brother could die out there, where the other vampires live, those that don’t consider humans anything else than food. They kill them.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>“Please don’t go,” Newt pulls his brother closer. “Or at least take us with you. Our father and I–”</p>
<p>“It’s too dangerous, little one,” Theseus kisses his cheek before looking back at him. “But I’ll come back for you.”</p>
<p>“For both of us,” Newt reminds him and Theseus looks at his father before grimacing. He’s never liked their father.</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you, Newt.”</p>
<p>The boy sighs, knowing there’s nothing he could do to change his mind.</p>
<p>“You better come back to me.”</p>
<p>“Always, little one.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Newt’s father decides to drown himself in the cheapest alcohol he can buy. Newt tries to take care of him, but the man doesn’t seem to want to see him. He doesn’t even ask for Theseus.</p>
<p>When two vampires show up at his house, Newt is not surprised; his father can’t donate anymore and since Theseus is gone, there was going to be an issue sooner or later.</p>
<p>“Your father has been declared useless,” one of the vampires says. “He cannot be a donor anymore.”</p>
<p>“Also… We have here that your brother hasn’t been seen in a donation center in months, where’s he?”</p>
<p>“He ran away,” Newt lies, trying to relax. Every time someone mentions Theseus he can’t help but feel worried.</p>
<p>Both vampires look at each other and roll their eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s most likely dead by now,” one of them says and Newt flinches.</p>
<p>No, he refuses to believe that. His brother is strong, he’s a survivor.</p>
<p>“Well… Mr. Scamander,” the first vampire says and Newt realizes he’s actually talking to him. “Our community needs at least one donor per house in order to preserve your place here, do you understand?”</p>
<p>He nods. One of them strokes his cheek.</p>
<p>“Good boy.”</p>
<p>“We know you’re 19, but you need to start donating right now if you want to keep the house, okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’ll do it. I’ll sign up tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Perfect, doll. We’ll see you then.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It hurts a lot to be bitten, especially because most of the vampires don’t really care about humans. On his first day, Newt sees a woman with a bandage around one of her wrists while one of the vampires in charge tells her that she has to start using the other one because that is just useless.</p>
<p>Newt is scared, although it doesn’t hurt as much as he had imagined. The vampire that feeds from him is kind, but seems to want to feed from his neck as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the employees sees them and she takes the vampire out of there. Because there are rules and they cannot feed from the humans’ neck.</p>
<p>Newt’s not sure why, but he’s grateful for that.</p>
<p>It’s been a month since he became an official donor when he meets Tina Goldstein. She’s a different vampire; she starts by apologizing as soon as Newt sits in front of her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to do this, but I’m hungry,” she mumbles. It seems the hunger has made talkative because she adds: “Queenie shares her mate with me sometimes, just so I can feed from him, but I know it bothers her. Vampires are very possessive after all, it’s in our nature.”</p>
<p>Newt doesn’t understand what she’s talking about and the names only make him feel more confused so he decides to try to make her comfortable.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Tina Goldstein.”</p>
<p>“I’m Newt Scamander,” and she starts smiling, looking at him in the eye.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty, Newt,” she blurts out and the human blushes. She keeps looking at his exposed wrist though. “Can I…”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>For a vampire that claims to be hungry, Tina doesn’t drink too much and she even is very gentle with him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Newt.”</p>
<p>They see each other again, Newt actually prefers to feed her because she’s kind and she actually feels really comfortable around him.</p>
<p>Sadly, they can’t do that every single time and Newt has to endure some aggressive bites every now and then and also a few glances and touches that make him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get worse than that at least.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Things start disappearing in the house because Newt’s father is running out of money to buy alcohol. Newt tries to help, he tries to talk to him, but his father is gone most of the time.</p>
<p>They have an argument one day because Newt won’t let him sell Theseus’s stuff and the boy freezes when his father yells something like: “why do you care? Your brother is dead anyway.”</p>
<p>Newt has to get out of the house for a couple of hours, to cry and tell himself that Theseus is coming back to him.</p>
<p>When he returns to the house, he finds the two vampires that brought his mother’s body that night.</p>
<p>His father is on the floor with bruises on his face and a bunch of golden coins around him.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, Newt. But I need this,” he cries and tries to reach out to him, but one of the vampires takes the boy in his arms and doesn’t let him go.</p>
<p>“Not yours anymore, you useless, filthy-blood,” the other huffs.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Newt mumbles. “What is going on, Dad?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, doll,” the vampire takes his chin with his hand in a painful grip. “Your life will get so much better anyway. A rich vampire will buy you and if you’re a good pet you’ll have anything you want.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Newt,” his father repeats before he passes out on the floor and he realizes that his father sold him.</p>
<p>“We’re going to the Capitol, doll.”</p>
