    <p>Green eyes slid open as chapped lips emitted a groan of confused pain. Rubbing a hand through messy hair, a nineteen year old Harry Potter slowly sat up and used his senses honed in war to gather information about his surroundings. Immediately he knew he wasn't where he remembered he should be. For one, it was too cold to be his North London apartment. Rain was common any time of the year, but it was still too warm to explain the snow that he could smell on the wind. The second thing he noticed was how his magic was still crackling weakly in the air. It was a sure sign that he'd recently had a large burst of it, most likely by accident. The third was the noise of horses he heard near by, as subtle as they were, coupled with the lack of any honking horns or the noise of pissed off motorists screaming through his window. </p><p>Harry knew he was a long way from home. </p><p>Which begged the question: Just where in the hell was he?!</p><p>Checking his person to see what he had on him, he immediately sighed in relief. His wands, coin purse, potion's kit, magically charged mp3 radio, emergency travel tent and combat boots had stayed with him in transit. Thank Merlin he hadn't bothered to take off his backpack before he settled on the couch in front of the telly. His battle robes were definitely in tatters, though. The several large holes and rips gave proof of his rather rough entry into wherever the hell this was.</p><p>Standing up and giving a stretch to work out his stiff muscles, he then checked his still intact hip satchel. Another sigh of relief followed when he felt his shrunken photo album, meager food rations, more potions, his journal, and the likely busted remains of his godfathers pocket watch. Walking over to the only place to sit in what looked to be a log cabin about to fall apart, he finally started to collect himself. After all, this wasn't the first time he apparated or Floo-ed to an unknown location and any place was better then Knockturn alley.</p><p>He gave a little whistle he hoped would be answered swiftly. The sweet melodic chirping he heard a minute later made his heart soar. His beloved familiar, Twilah, landed lightly on his shoulder, her feathers bristling with the sudden cold around her. She was in her snigget form rather then her more conspicuous thunderbird or phoenix forms. It was the way he'd taught her to shift when she was in an unknown area. She was harder to see this way. Most people would easily mistake her for a finch or a hummingbird and quickly dismissed her. Twilah was a rare shifter bird he'd purchased some time back in India after Hedwig's untimely demise. He thought what he purchased was a well trained red-tailed hawk.He was very confused the next morning to find out his newly chosen mail carrier had more then one surprise tucked under her brilliant wings. He felt the nuzzling of his tiny friend and nodded to her.</p><p>"There you are, girl. I'm glad you made it. We can't have us getting separated in the middle of no where. Well girl, lets take a gander of where we've popped to, shall we?"</p><p>As he looked around him and tried to piece together how he found himself in the middle of no where, an unmistakably recognizable voice came from a distance. The minute he heard it his eyes opened comically wide. It was a voice of a man he'd been hearing for weeks. It was also the voice of a man that shouldn't exist outside the game console Hermione set up for him mere months ago. That deep, charismatic, slightly scratchy voice was all too clear and real to be anyone else. It reminded Harry of what chocolate melting over a black blazing fire would sound like. </p><p>"Miss Grimshaw, Mister Pearson, start getting this place packed up. We have those bonds in our pocket for now, but the Pinkertons won't be far behind with the snows thawing. Hosea found us what he reckons is a nice spot to relocate. We have to be ready to move by tomorrow morning the latest. So work it out and get everyone moving."</p><p>As that rather sensual voice rang loud and clear, Harry began to piece together just where he was and what could have happened. Just a short month ago he'd been completely taken over by a video game he played on his days off. Red Dead Redemption 2 was a ready relief from his constant battles against what was left of the Death Eater faction. It was a place to escape to when the burdens of his past woke him up in the dead of night. The easy setting of the late 18th century, with it's long horse rides and dead eye shooting, became his guilty pleasure and addiction. </p><p>But in doing the play-through for the third time, he got exceedingly unhappy with the way it began to fall apart all over again. Between Dutch's decent to madness, Arthur's battle with Tuberculosis, and Micah's betrayal, Harry couldn't help but feel somehow disgruntled by the end of chapter six. Watching Arthur's death all over again had him snapping in rage. Right now it seemed silly to get so emotionally invested in a game, but at the time, it made perfect sense. No matter how he tried, he couldn't save the main protagonist from how the game developers planned the main story-line to go. Harry had let his emotions get the better of him, saying something no powerful, angry witch or wizard should say. To make matters worst, he'd yelled it out loud as his magic swelled around him. </p><p>
  <i>"Merlin's bloody bullocks. I wish I could change it all!"</i>
</p><p>Like always, his magic listened unfailingly. It did exactly what he'd asked it too. Hermione would be laughing right now if she could be here. After all, it was his constant need to save people that seemed to get him into trouble time and time again. </p><p>This situation was no different. In his righteous anger, he really only wanted to save the misinformed Van Der Linde gang from it own destruction. To see two proud men fall from grace so readily because of the evilness of the third hearkened too much to reality for him. It was Dumbledore (Dutch), himself ( Arthur), and Voldemort ( Micah) all over again.</p><p> For all it's Pinkertons and gunslingers, Micah was the real antagonist of the rdr2 universe. A terror to himself and those around him. Like Voldemort, he depended on fear, confusion and chaos to get his own way. Whispering into just the right ears to watch people fall in line around him. In a rebel gang where loyalty was the heart that kept them all together, Micah played an over-stressed Dutch like a flute. Harry had been so pissed the first time he played the main story line when the little rat had managed to get away. John killing him in the epilogue just seemed so....anti-climatic; an afterthought to true justice. Arthur was the one who deserved the right to claim that vengeance. Sadly it had been stolen from him by sickness. </p><p>Not this time around, though. Harry would see his mistaken wish come into fruition. In his heart, Harry was more healer then fighter. But after all he'd been through, he was first and foremost a consummate warrior tried and true. He'd been fighting against people like Micah Bell his whole life and he had no intentions of stopping now. Game or no game, strange or not, he was here. He was determined to see this through whatever it took. Somehow he would save them all from the little weasel intent upon destroying them. Not to mention saving a fair few of them from themselves along the way. The laundry list of people whose acts had to clean up was daunting but Harry was just as stubborn as Dutch with a plan.

He would make sure no one would be killed this time around. Even if that meant he might die trying. Which of course, knowing his luck, he probably would. </p><p>First, though, he needed a horse. Lucky for him, with a near encyclopedic knowledge of the game's map, he knew just where to get one of the best in the game for free. All he had to do was envision Lake Isabella hard enough to get there. So, after a few general spells to keep him warm and dry, he issued an order to his familiar to stay put before apparating away. He would come back later tonight. </p><p>After all, how hard could taming one horse be?</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>Harry wished he could beat himself to death for being so stupid. Of course he'd forgotten the twice-cursed wolves that liked to hunt around the same frozen lake. Though he'd managed to claim and bond with the pure white mare, the scent of her fear when he first approached drew what was probably the largest pack of wild wolves in the area on his ass. Ten of which were currently trying to run him down. Couple that with the recent snows and the lean pickings, and he was nothing but a warm t-bone steak running in the middle of no where. </p><p>Now, with the horse under him panting heavily and running out of steam, he could barely make out the packed wagon in the distance that signaled his approach to the camp. He clutched his bleeding wand arm to his chest, the upper half of which was nearly bitten clear through to the bone. The claw marks down his chest hurt like hell too. In his excitement of trying to find the perfect horse, he'd made a terrible blunder of not checking over everything in his satchel. The healing potions he'd had in there must of smashed from the massive burst of magic it took to get him here. Now,between the magical drain and blood-loss, Harry could barely stay upright on the running mare beneath him. </p><p>The wolves behind him gave out another snarling howl and nipped at his horse's back legs. With a sudden jolt and a loud whinny, his new horse bucked him clean off her back, the last of her stamina finally running it's course. The wolves gathered around him as his nervous mount hopped over one and proceeded to canter towards the silent camp. Now he was on his own. Weak, drained, and near freezing, he stood up the best he could, ready to do battle. After all, Voldemort had nearly killed him plenty of times. What were the chances that wild beasts would succeed where the powerfully evil Dark Wizard could not. </p><p>But as one wolf latched on to the back of his left leg, he screamed with the startling truth. Nature was a cruel mistress sometimes. Playing the game of chance with her, regardless of who you were, was foolish. It was a game you never won. </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the semi warm confines of one of the few log cabins left standing in the abandoned mining camp, Arthur Morgan's eyes snapped open suddenly. He couldn't say what, but something wasn't right. Sitting up, he automatically grabbed his sawed off shotgun lying next to his pillow. A chilling howl on the wind crept down his spine as he stood up and put on his fur lined boots. The growling snarls that followed had him tossing on his coat and putting his cattleman revolver on his hip. That's what woke him; Wolves were too close to camp. The damned mangy beasts probably followed Marston off the fucking mountain. Walking out of the tiny bedroom, his head snapped to the west as a blood-curdling scream of a stranger rang through the air. Shit! Someone was out there! He was already bursting out the door as he called for Dutch. </p><p>Stepping outside, he realized he wasn't the only one woken by the noise. Charles, Javier, Hosea, Lenny and Bill were also standing outside, clutching their guns as they ran towards the horses. He mounted his newly acquired horse as Dutch spoke behind him. </p><p>"If it's a Pinkerton or one of Colm's little stooges, we'll have to let the wolves finish what they started. I know it isn't pretty, but we don't need that kind of trouble right now. If it's anyone else, we save them. Stick close and aim true, gentlemen. Lenny, stay behind and tie up that horse. Now come on, we've got wolves to hunt. HYAH!"</p><p>Arthur kicked his horse into gear, keeping pace with Dutch. As they approached the snarling, they finally made out the growling mass of wolves nipping at a person who looked too small to be a fully grown adult. Although making a valiant effort beating back the wolves with what appeared to be a large stick, they could all see his strength was failing. One wolf laid dead, and another was limping, but that didn't attest for the blood soaked snow they could see under the now kneeling form in front of them.</p><p>Charles struck first, using his good hand to take out his tomahawk. With a war cry reminiscent of his native forefathers, he flung the weapon through the air, catching one animal in the head dead center. The others whipped themselves into action, each aiming carefully to make sure no one hit the wounded stranger lying on the ground by now. </p><p>Finally one of the last wolves whimpered, running off. Arthur's pistol bullets nearly caught it in the back leg. But it was Dutch who saved the strange person from certain death. The snarling beast about to bite through the stick lodged against the person's throat was shot dead between the eyes before it could deliver what would have surely been a killing blow.  As silence fell, Arthur slipped off his horse and approached what he could now tell was a male form shaking in the snow. The stranger collapsed completely by the time he reached him. </p><p>Kneeling down, he took the stick and pried it from the limp death grip it was in. The stranger, which he could now see was a fairly young man, was unconscious. Judging by the wounds and blood Arthur could see, it was a wonder he'd stayed upright as long as he did. </p><p>"Dutch, this ain't no Pinkerton. Lord's above, he looks younger then Lenny. What the hell's a boy doing all alone up here. First the fuckin' O'Driscolls, then Mrs. Adler, now a damn boy. We seem to be surrounded by folk wantin' to get themselves killed up here."</p><p>Dutch, having dismounted by now, knelt in the snow beside him. </p><p>"Christ, you aren't wrong. He's too young to be out here by himself. Thankfully the cold is slowing the bleeding. But he won't live much longer if we don't get him inside. I'll carry him if you get our horses and his pack for us. Damned wild mongrels must've snapped the shoulder hold when they bit through his right arm. Nasty animals, the lot of them."</p><p>He turned to the rest of the men and barked commands as he situated the boy carefully in his arms. </p><p>"The rest of you I want on lookout. Light fires on all sides of the camp and keep the horses tethered up in the middle. Javier wake up Mr. Pearson, I want you both to take the East. Bill get Micah up and guard the North and South. Charles get Tilly, give her a gun and the both of you guard the West. Hosea, before you get inside, wake Miss Grimshaw and Reverend Swanson. This boy needs sewing and patching up. But please remember Hosea, I don't want you out long. That cough of yours is nasty and this cold is only going to make it worse. The rest of you can take turns resting and warming up, but I don't want anyone to stay sleeping for long. With all this blood and the scent of fresh kill near by, we have no way of knowing when or if those beasts will be back. Not to mention bears and cougars. That cursed snow storm has everything hungry up here."</p><p>Making sure he had the stranger secured properly in his arms, Dutch set a fairly swift stride towards camp, the others trailing behind him. He didn't know why or for what reason, but the sudden and startling protectiveness in his mind took a hold of his heart. Whoever this young boy was, regardless of where he came from, he mustn't be left to die. A determined, grim expression settled over the consummate leader's face as he looked down at the prone form in his arms.</p><p>Whoever this boy was, he was going to live. Dutch wouldn't allow it to be any other way.</p>
