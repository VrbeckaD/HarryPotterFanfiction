      </p>
      <p>He was staring. Again.</p>
      <p>Ron was the first to point it out, but afterwards it was impossible to glance at the blonde ferret without finding him <em>already </em>looking at me. He looked confused, maybe even a little put off.</p>
      <p>"That's it, I'm going over there."</p>
      <p>"Oh calm down, Ron. He isn't doing anything."</p>
      <p>Ron glared across the dining hall at Malfoy, who was no longer staring at me, instead engaging Blaise in conversation.</p>
      <p>"It's been two weeks of this shit. Has he said anything to you?" asked Ron, looking to Harry for support.</p>
      <p>I shook my head, refusing to look at Malfoy again. "Nothing out of the ordinary, no."</p>
      <p>"You two practically live together, how -"</p>
      <p>"We don't live together." I snapped, glaring at him. It'd been two weeks of this nonsense and I'd had enough. He wasn't <em>doing</em> anything to me. "We share a common room and a bathroom. I hardly ever see him."</p>
      <p>Not for his lack of trying, though, that was for sure. He'd attempted starting plenty conversations, none of which I'd been particularly keen on participating in. I didn't trust him.</p>
      <p>At all.</p>
      <p>"If he keeps this up I'm -"</p>
      <p>"Oh come off it, Ron." muttered Harry with an eye roll, "You won't do anything. We all came back for the same thing, to finish school and get out of here."</p>
      <p>I could always count on Harry to be level headed.</p>
      <p>We returned to our food without mentioning him again, but each time I glanced over to his table I caught his gaze.</p>
      <p>It was like he was <em>trying </em>to get under my skin.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>"Earth to Malfoy!" I said, waving my hand in front of his face, "Did you hear anything I just said?"</p>
      <p>He blinked a few times before nodding, "Sorry, yeah. I heard you."</p>
      <p>He'd said very little to me over the past few days, which was strange considering he'd gone out of his way to speak to me any other time. The staring, however, didn't change at all. He just seemed...resigned about it.</p>
      <p>"So?"</p>
      <p>Malfoy cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair before his eyes met mine again. He was more unfocused than I'd ever seen him before.</p>
      <p>Strange.</p>
      <p>"We can take the last carriage. At least that way we'll know everyone else is on."</p>
      <p>We were in charge of the weekend trip to Hogsmeade, so I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly, even if that meant sharing a carriage with Malfoy.</p>
      <p>I nodded but before I could say anything else I heard Ron calling my name. Malfoy's expression instantly soured when he spotted him.</p>
      <p>"Your Weasel calls." he said, barely contained contempt lacing his voice.</p>
      <p>"What's your problem? You've been weird since we got back. I bloody <em>testified </em>for you, and you've done nothing but make the start of this year strange and uncomfortable." I snapped, glaring at him.</p>
      <p>He laughed, though the sound wasn't humorous at all, "You think <em>you </em>feel strange and uncomfortable? You don't know the half of it, Granger."</p>
      <p>I could've stomped my foot on the ground I was so angry. <em>He </em>was the one doing all this. Without a word I turned away from him, finding Ron, Harry, and Ginny getting ready to get onto their carriage.</p>
      <p>"Are you coming?" asked Ginny, already seated inside.</p>
      <p>"I'll meet you guys there. I'm taking the last carriage so I can make sure everybody makes it there."</p>
      <p>Harry looked over my shoulder, no doubt at Malfoy, as he said, "Just be careful, yeah?"</p>
      <p>I rolled my eyes, "Come on, I need one of you to keep a clear head about this."</p>
      <p>He chuckled, joining Ginny and Ron in the carriage.</p>
      <p>"If he tries anything, let us know." said Ron, before the carriage pulled off.</p>
      <p>I already felt more tense as they left, but I squared my shoulders and helped the rest of the students onto their carriages.</p>
      <p>Sooner than I would've liked everyone was headed to Hogsmeade, leaving only Malfoy and I at the bottom of the stairs, one carriage remaining.</p>
      <p>"After you, Granger." he said, offering his hand to help me up into the carriage.</p>
      <p>After a second of contemplation I took it, surprised by the slight electric shock. I glanced at his face, but he wasn't looking at me, the only sign he'd felt anything was his slightly clenched jaw.</p>
      <p>After we were both seated across from each other the carriage started moving, leaving the two of us in a rather uncomfortable silence.</p>
      <p>I kept stealing glances at him, but he was staring stoically out the window, seemingly content to ignore me for the entire ride.</p>
      <p>But I was just too damn curious.</p>
      <p>"What's going on with you?"</p>
      <p>He didn't respond for a while. In fact, he didn't even act like he'd <em>heard </em>me.</p>
      <p>But after a moment he turned to look at me, his eyes meeting mine and -</p>
      <p>
        <em>Was that gold?</em>
      </p>
      <p>But it was gone the second I saw it, his eyes their usual slate grey as he said, "I don't know that it'd do me much good."</p>
      <p>"How do you know?"</p>
      <p>"Because you loathe me, Granger. That much I do know."</p>
      <p>I frowned. That wasn't what I was expecting. I didn't even know if I <em>did </em>loathe him.</p>
      <p>How could I, really? After everything that had happened I was just happy to be alive.</p>
      <p>"I don't, though. I certainly don't trust you, but I meant everything I said at your trial."</p>
      <p>He flinched at the mention of his trial, his eyes dropping from mine, "I never thanked you for that, did I?"</p>
      <p>"You didn't have to." I said with a shrug, both of us jostling a bit as the carriage came to a stop.</p>
      <p>He nodded slowly, his eyes meeting mine again as though he'd made up his mind about something. "Will you join me for a drink?"</p>
      <p>"Are you going to tell me what's going on?" I countered.</p>
      <p>His face paled, but he nodded.</p>
      <p>"Then yes. Let me find Harry and Ron so they don't go starting a search party."</p>
      <p>"I'm sure they'd be more likely to form a mob that had pitchforks." he quipped, stepping out of the carriage and offering me his hand again.</p>
      <p>I didn't bother stopping the laugh that bubbled up at the thought, "Accurate."</p>
      <p>That same electric shock zapped my fingers a second time, but this time his eyes met mine.</p>
      <p>"What was that?" I asked, eyebrow raised.</p>
      <p>He cleared his throat, retracting his hand as he said, "Meet me at the Three Broomsticks."</p>
      <p>Before I could say anything he was gone, his thick black robes blending in with the crowd within seconds.</p>
      <p>
        <em>What the hell is going on?</em>
      </p>
      <p>I found Ron and Harry, unsurprisingly, looking at broomsticks.</p>
      <p>"This is the <em>new one, </em>Gin. It's a big -"</p>
      <p>"I couldn't care less, Harry." sighed Ginny with a bored eye roll, "I'm going to Madam Malkins."</p>
      <p>She smiled and invited me to tag along after I was bored of their Quidditch talk.</p>
      <p>"Hey, Mione." said Ron, swinging his arm around my shoulders. "Glad to see you made it in one piece."</p>
      <p>"I'm fine." I said, looking to Harry for help in case Ron continued the Malfoy-berating.</p>
      <p>"We were thinking about buying a few things in here." said Harry, pointing to the broom they'd been talking about.</p>
      <p>"It's the ne-"</p>
      <p>"New one." I finished with a smile, "I heard."</p>
      <p>Harry had the decency to look embarrassed as he said, "Feel free to join Gin. We know this isn't your thing."</p>
      <p>"Actually," I said, sliding out from Ron's arm, "I'm going to grab a drink with Malfoy."</p>
      <p>"What?" asked Ron, voice raised considerably higher than was acceptable for <em>inside </em>a store.</p>
      <p>"You wanted to know why he's been so weird, I'm going to find out."</p>
      <p>"Where?"</p>
      <p>I rolled my eyes, "The Three Broomsticks, where else?"</p>
      <p>"We're coming." snapped Ron, his face a rather unflattering shade of red.</p>
      <p>"No we're not." said Harry, a bored expression on his face, "Because if we go you're just going to start a fight, everyone will have to go back to Hogwarts, and we still won't know what's up with Malfoy."</p>
      <p>Ron couldn't seem to come up with anything to refute him, his face reddening further.</p>
      <p>"Thank you." I said to Harry, "I'll see the both of you later."</p>
      <p>Before Ron could continue the argument I left the store, hoping Harry could keep him from following me.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>I saw him sitting at a booth tucked away in the farthest corner, practically out of sight from the rest of the pub. I made my way toward him slowly, relieved that there were so many people here already.</p>
      <p>I slid into the booth across from him, but he didn't seem surprised, as though he knew I was headed his way.</p>
      <p>"That didn't take as long as I thought." he said, looking up at me with a smirk. "I was sure Weasley was going to follow you in here raising all sorts of hell."</p>
      <p>I shrugged, ordering a glass of firewhiskey before saying, "Harry was on my side."</p>
      <p>He seemed surprised, but didn't comment on it any further.</p>
      <p>"So what's up with you?" I asked, thanking the waitress for my drink before looking back to him.</p>
      <p>He forced out a chuckle and said, "Straight to the point, eh, Granger?"</p>
      <p>"Why do you think I'm here?" I asked, taking a sip of my drink, "You've been staring at me for weeks looking like someone kicked your puppy - not to mention," I said, speaking over his attempts to interrupt me, "That weird fucking shock."</p>
      <p>"I -" he stopped, knocking back his drink before continuing, "I'm a veela."</p>
      <p>That was certainly not what I was expecting.</p>
      <p>"You...okay...did you always know?"</p>
      <p>He shook his head, a sharp chuckle erupting from his throat, "No. I found out the night before we came back here."</p>
      <p>"Woah...how?"</p>
      <p>"My parents didn't think it mattered much with the war. It's not like either of them expected to live."</p>
      <p>I let that sink in, taking a few more sips of my drink. I noticed Malfoy had another of whatever he was drinking, watching as he brought the glass to his lips when the thought hit me.</p>
      <p>"Malfoy...what does any of this have to do with me?"</p>
      <p>He frowned, his eyes trailing over my features before he smirked, "I think you know."</p>
      <p>I shook my head, "You're absolutely out of your fucking mind."</p>
      <p>He narrowed his eyes at me, "Do you seriously think I wanted this? You think I <em>chose </em>you or something?" He spat the words at me, venom laced in each as he continued, "I don't know why it's you, Granger. Salazar knows I don't know why it's you. Fuck I tried for weeks to convince myself that it <em>wasn't</em> you."</p>
      <p>I crossed my arms defensively, leaning back against the booth, "What's that supposed to mean? I'm not -"</p>
      <p>"It's not supposed to mean anything." he snapped, knocking back the rest of his drink, "You're it for me. I don't know why, but I <em>feel </em>it. That's what the shock is."</p>
      <p>I shook my head, "No. <em>No</em>. You don't even <em>like </em>me, Malfoy. How can you -"</p>
      <p>"Granger, <em>I don't know</em>. I don't know anything, other than when I'm around you I don't feel like I'm about to crawl out of my skin."</p>
      <p>His blunt admission caught me off guard, and I found myself just staring at him. My mouth might have been open, I had no idea.</p>
      <p>"Could you say something?" he snapped, annoyed.</p>
      <p>What was I supposed to say to that?</p>
      <p>"I...I don't know what that means." I said lamely.</p>
      <p>He leaned back as well, his eyes holding mine, "It means that I need you to survive, Granger."</p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>No, no, no, no, no, no, <em>no</em>.</p>
      <p>"You have completely lost your mind." I said, digging through my bag for a few galleons, "<em>Completely</em>." I snapped, slamming down a few coins before standing from the table. "I'll meet you at eight by the carriages to make sure everyone gets back safely."</p>
      <p>Before he could say anything else I turned on my heel and left the pub, making a beeline away from all the shops to find a quiet place to process my thoughts -</p>
      <p>And maybe have a breakdown.</p>
      <p>I slipped behind one of the last buildings, sliding down the wall. I had the presence of mind to be thankful I'd worn my thick robes, otherwise my pants would've surely been damp from the slightly wet stones.</p>
      <p>It had been a rather rainy October.</p>
      <p>I leaned my head back against the wall, closing my eyes and taking a few deep breaths.</p>
      <p>Malfoy didn't know what he was talking about. He didn't even know he <em>was </em>a veela until a few months ago, how was I supposed to believe he knew the signs of a <em>mate</em>. Didn't the idiot know that was for <em>life</em>.</p>
      <p>Merlin, this wasn't happening.</p>
      <p>I tried controlling my breathing, and was slightly successful, when I heard quick footsteps on the stones around the corner.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Great, now what?</em>
      </p>
      <p>Malfoy rounded the corner, slowing when he saw me glaring at him.</p>
      <p>"Are you alright?" he asked, bouncing from foot to foot as though he had to force himself to keep the distance between us.</p>
      <p>"Go away, Malfoy." I groaned, dropping my head into my hands.</p>
      <p>
        <em>How was this happening</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Granger, I don't think you get it." he said, his voice directly in front of me, "I can...I <em>feel </em>what you're feeling. And it's rather uncomfortable, so I'd like for it to stop."</p>
      <p>I blinked up at him, the sheer shock of his admission slowing my heartbeat, "You <em>what</em>?"</p>
      <p>"There's a lot to all this shite." he muttered, glaring at the ground before huffing out a resigned sigh and sitting down across from me, "There are things that I don't know yet. Things I don't understand."</p>
      <p>"Bloody hell." I muttered, dropping my head back to my hands.</p>
      <p>"I know that you don't..." he cleared his throat, seeming to have to force the words out, "Feel anything for me, so this is a lot, but I'd really prefer not to die over this."</p>
      <p>I couldn't stop the laugh from bursting out. This was all too much.</p>
      <p>"This is certainly not the way I saw my last year going."</p>
      <p>Struggling to reign in my laughter I continued, "This is so utterly <em>ridiculous."</em></p>
      <p>His eyes narrowed and suddenly giant wings burst from his back, but instead of feathers like I would've expected, there were scales. Green, glimmering, <em>beautiful </em>scales. He was -</p>
      <p>"Breathtaking." I murmured, sitting forward onto my knees and lifting my hand to them.</p>
      <p>Malfoy caught my hand in his, a conflicted expression on his face, "I'm not breath -"</p>
      <p>I tugged my hand from his, lifting it to trail my fingertips over his wings.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Soft.</em>
      </p>
      <p>So much softer than I expected. They felt like the softest silk.</p>
      <p>Malfoy's breath hitched at the contact, and before I knew it he had me pressed against the opposite wall, his wings fluttering softly, caging us in.</p>
      <p>"You really shouldn't do that." he murmured against my ear, his lips gently brushing against my neck as he spoke, "You ought to read a book on veelas sometime."</p>
      <p>I could hear the smirk in his voice, though I couldn't see his face, but for some reason, this close to him - I could literally <em>feel </em>the power radiating off him.</p>
      <p>There was so much more to Malfoy than I thought.</p>
      <p>"Your heart is beating faster." he noted, leaning back slightly to look at me.</p>
      <p>"Maybe you scare me." I said softly, unable to meet his intense gaze.</p>
      <p>He slid two cool fingers under my chin, tilting my face up to look at him, "No, I don't think fear has anything to do with it."</p>
      <p>I could feel a blush spreading on my cheeks, his cold hand nice against my quickly heating skin.</p>
      <p>Had he always been this attractive?</p>
      <p><em>Yes</em>.</p>
      <p>His eyes darkened, his tongue flicking out to lick his bottom lip as he looked at my throat. I could see the tip of a fang, and for some reason instead of it scaring me, I felt <em>excited</em>.</p>
      <p>"You do know that I can <em>smell </em>your excitement, right, Granger?" he asked, trailing his lips across my neck, "And you smell delicious."</p>
      <p>The way the words rolled off his tongue had me clenching my thighs, half wishing he would kiss me, half wishing he would bite me.</p>
      <p>"All you have to do is ask." he murmured.</p>
      <p>"I...don't know what I want."</p>
      <p>He smirked, leaning back to look at my lips as he spoke, "Then you just tell me to stop."</p>
      <p>Before I could process what his words meant, his lips were on mine. The touch was feather soft, his lips, like his hands, cool. The second I relaxed into him, he pressed me harder against the wall, his hands finding my hips.</p>
      <p>When I broke away to gasp for air, he continued attacking my neck, licking and nipping the sensitive skin while murmuring, "Fuck, you don't know how badly I want you. How long I've wanted this."</p>
      <p>I tugged at his hair, pulling his face back up to mine. His eyes were a bright gold, need clear as day in them. I knew veelas needed the blood of their mate to survive. How was I supposed to say no to that? He would <em>die</em>.</p>
      <p>Without thinking on it any further I pulled him into a kiss, sliding my tongue along the sharp tips of his fangs before whispering, "Bite me."</p>
      <p>He groaned, his right hand resting directly under my breast, "You don't have to -"</p>
      <p>"I know that I don't have to." I snapped, "It's not like you could force me to do something even if you wanted to."</p>
      <p>He matched my smirk with his own, dropping his head back to my neck to place open mouthed kisses there, "Quite the smart mouth. I do love that about you."</p>
      <p>Before I could debate the meaning of those words, his fangs sank into my neck and absolute bliss exploded through my body.</p>
      <p>It was as though I was riding a wave, <em>up, up, up, </em>and then I crashed, knees buckling at the intense pleasure his bite provided, though I didn't need to worry, because his arms were around me, holding me up. I felt his tongue gently licking the bite mark on my neck, murmuring something I couldn't understand against my throat.</p>
      <p>
        <em>What the fuck just happened?</em>
      </p>
      <p>"I knew it. I fucking knew it." he murmured.</p>
      <p>When I managed to look at him his wings were gone, but the smirk was not.</p>
      <p>"What...just happened?" I asked, trying to gather my thoughts, but with my racing heartbeat I found the task quite difficult.</p>
      <p>"You're my mate, Granger. The fact that you came when I bit you just proves my point."</p>
      <p>I shook my head, trying to process his words, "Veela bites are supposed to give pleasure."</p>
      <p>"Not like that."</p>
      <p>What was I supposed to say to that?</p>
      <p>"How do you expect me to react to all this?"</p>
      <p>A small smile graced the corners of his lips as he said, "Well, I expected you to hex me."</p>
      <p>Honestly the thought hadn't crossed my mind, surprisingly enough, though I didn't really want to dwell on <em>why </em>that was.</p>
      <p>"I...need to do some research." was all I managed to say, slipping out of his arms, "I'll meet you by the carriages at eight."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>After spending the last three hours of the trip in the bookstore, immersed in every book on veelas that I could get my hands on, I had a pretty good understanding of what it meant to mate with a veela, and everything that came along with it.</p>
      <p>Overwhelmed wasn't even the half of it.</p>
      <p>I felt like I was in a daze as I met Malfoy by the carriages, a few younger students already in theirs ready to leave.</p>
      <p>"I almost thought I was going to have to dig you out of a pile of books." quipped Malfoy, arms crossed as he leaned against one of the carriages.</p>
      <p>"I managed."</p>
      <p>He seemed to regard me carefully for a moment before saying, "I'm sorry. I know you don't want this, but at least let me try to show you that I've changed, eh? Believe it or not, I could make it worth your while."</p>
      <p>I felt myself blushing at the insinuation, butterflies erupting in my stomach at the thought of <em>that </em>feeling again.</p>
      <p>"You can't honestly believe to win me over with orgasms, Malfoy. I can't have bite marks all over the place." I said, feigning indignance.</p>
      <p>He smirked, his eyes lighting up as he took a step closer to me, "Trust me, love, I don't need to bite you to show you a great time."</p>
      <p>Before I could come up with anything to say I felt someone's arm swing around my shoulders.</p>
      <p>"Excuse us for a moment." said Harry, immediately steering me away from Malfoy.</p>
      <p>"Harry, what -"</p>
      <p>"Don't 'Harry what' me, Mione. I heard what he said. What the hell is going on with you two?"</p>
      <p>I sighed, glancing over to Malfoy who was watching the two of us intently, before focusing back on Harry.</p>
      <p>"It's complicated."</p>
      <p>"Complicated? It sounded like he wants to <em>fuck </em>you!"</p>
      <p>"Keep your voice down!" I snapped, hazarding a glance at Malfoy, who had <em>definitely </em>heard him if his shit eating grin was of any indication.</p>
      <p>"I'll talk about it when I figure it out." I said, forcing myself to focus on Harry, "There's nothing to tell right now."</p>
      <p>"Nothing to tell, or nothing your <em>going </em>to tell?" he countered, eyebrow raised.</p>
      <p>I shrugged, glancing over toward his carriage, Ron and Ginny already in it, "You should go. And <em>don't,</em>" I said, fixing him with my most intimidating glare, "Mention a word of this to them."</p>
      <p>Harry sighed but agreed, giving me a quick hug before jogging to his carriage.</p>
      <p>Instead of walking back to Malfoy I stayed further ahead, making sure the carriages were ready to go. Soon enough the first carriages were moving, heading back to Hogwarts.</p>
      <p>After having counted - and made Malfoy count - everyone twice, I could relax in good conscience. He was already sitting inside the carriage by the time I got there, fiddling with the ring on his middle finger.</p>
      <p>He looked up when I sat across from him, smirk already in place.</p>
      <p>"Should I be prepared for Weasley flipping out on me?" his eyes sparkled at the idea of the challenge, and there was something...<em>sexy </em>about it.</p>
      <p>I shook my head, focusing my gaze out the window. I needed to get a grip. Ever since he'd bit me, being in his presence had my body on high alert.</p>
      <p>"No, he won't say anything."</p>
      <p>Suddenly I felt his long, slender fingers wrapping around my wrist, tugging me forward sharply and effortlessly twisting his legs so that I fell across his lap, his opposite arm sliding behind my back to keep me tucked against his chest.</p>
      <p>"What are you -"</p>
      <p>"Showing you." he said with a smirk, the motion exposing his fangs to my gaze.</p>
      <p>
        <em>What was wrong with me?</em>
      </p>
      <p>This was what happened when you really were a veela's mate - it was just about a million times more intense than any book described.</p>
      <p>His hand left my wrist, instead sliding to my cheek to pull me towards him in a kiss.</p>
      <p>He was demanding, teeth nipping at my bottom lip before his tongue slid against mine.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Why was I fighting this, again?</em>
      </p>
      <p>I slid my arms around his neck, tangling my fingers into the silky hair at the nape of his neck and tugging slightly as I returned his kisses.</p>
      <p><em>My body was on fire</em>.</p>
      <p>I could very distinctly feel the hardness of his erection against my bum, the knowledge that he was turned on by this - by <em>me </em>- was kind of exhilarating.</p>
      <p>But we were in a <em>carriage</em> literally <em>minutes </em>from the castle.</p>
      <p>"We can't do this right now." I panted, pulling away from his lips, though he didn't seem deterred, instead moving to my neck to press hungry kisses there.</p>
      <p>"Malfoy, I'm serious." I said again, tugging his hair a <em>little </em>harder than was probably necessary and said, "We're about to pull up to the castle. Get <em>off me</em>."</p>
      <p>He groaned, eyes dark as he said, "I like it rough, Granger."</p>
      <p>I slapped at his hands, unwilling to fall any further into this hole. We were not doing <em>anything </em>in a <em>carriage </em>for fucks sake!</p>
      <p>He did let me go and I slid into my seat just as we stopped in front of the castle. I glared at him, at a loss for words.</p>
      <p>"Judging by your <em>delectable </em>smell," he murmured, voice smooth, "It's more likely you're angry we didn't have time, then angry at me for trying."</p>
      <p>"Oh sod off," I grumbled, practically stomping out of the carriage.</p>
      <p>I was really just upset that he was right.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>By the time I made it back to the Heads Dorm I was exhausted.</p>
      <p>And still incredibly pent up.</p>
      <p>I was hoping to slip into a cold shower and go to bed, avoiding Malfoy all together, but when I pushed open the portrait I found him asleep on the couch, a few empty and half empty glasses of what looked like firewhiskey on the coffee table.</p>
      <p>His friends had probably been here, but it was almost one in the morning now.</p>
      <p>I shut the portrait, quietly tiptoeing into the bathroom, locking the door with a soft click.</p>
      <p>I let out a relieved breath, the safety of the bathroom relaxing me instantly.</p>
      <p>Though I couldn't entirely ignore the tingles sliding across my skin at the thought of Malfoy in the other room -</p>
      <p>
        <em>Get a grip! </em>
      </p>
      <p>I quickly stripped my clothes and stepped into the warm steam of the shower, hoping to wash all naughty thoughts of Malfoy down the drain.</p>
      <p>Though now that I was thinking of Malfoy, my mind wandered to what it would be like if he was here.</p>
      <p>A rather embarrassing incident when I walked in on him in the shower had taught me Malfoy was <em>rather </em>well endowed.</p>
      <p>I rubbed my thighs together, tilting my face up to the warm stream and shutting my eyes.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Why did I want him so badly? </em>
      </p>
      <p>"Do you know wandless magic, Granger?"</p>
      <p>My eyes immediately flew open and I stuck my head out of the shower to find Malfoy, <em>stark arse naked </em>a few feet away.</p>
      <p>"What?!"</p>
      <p>"Do you," he started, walking toward me, smirk on full display, "Know wandless magic?"</p>
      <p>"Not very well." I said slowly, eyes narrowing, "Malfoy, stop right there."</p>
      <p>"Why? I can smell you from here."</p>
      <p>The sensual rumble of his voice made my stomach clench. It was becoming increasingly difficult to remember why this shouldn't be happening.</p>
      <p>"You...you can't just say things like that." I managed to force out, cheeks hot.</p>
      <p>"Why not? You seem to like when I do."</p>
      <p>By this point he was directly in front of me, his hand over mine on the shower curtain - and I felt as though my heart was going to beat out of my chest.</p>
      <p>"Could I join you?" he asked, smirking down at me.</p>
      <p>"Why would you want to do that?" I asked, voice barely above a whisper.</p>
      <p>His smirk widened and he pushed the curtain open - and I let him.</p>
      <p>His eyes widened as they trailed down my body, gold flaring in them almost immediately. He looked strong and <em>sexy</em>.</p>
      <p>"Salazar, you're fucking stunning." he groaned, stepping into the shower and pushing me back against the wall.</p>
      <p>His hands wove into my hair, tugging me forward into a kiss and, as if by instinct, my hands went to his waist.</p>
      <p>His lips were rough against mine, demanding as much as he gave.</p>
      <p>"You smell devine, love." he murmured against my lips, biting the bottom one before pulling back to kiss and nip at my neck.</p>
      <p>I couldn't help but dig my nails into his hips, tensing at his ministrations.</p>
      <p>He immediately pulled back to look at me, "I would never bite you unless you asked me to, Granger."</p>
      <p>"That's not..." I shook my head, cheeks heating at the thought of <em>voicing </em>how much I enjoyed the first time he bit me - and that I wanted him to do it again.</p>
      <p>A devilishly handsome smirk spread across his face, eyes flashing gold once again.</p>
      <p>"That wasn't it at all, was it, Granger?" he asked, lowering his head back to my neck, "You <em>want </em>me to bite you again, don't you?"</p>
      <p>"Yes," I admitted breathlessly, his wet chest sliding against mine <em>almost </em>too much, "Only Merlin knows why, but yes."</p>
      <p>Surprisingly he didn't bite me, instead his head went lower, fluttering over my collarbones before he was pressing open mouthed kisses to my breasts.</p>
      <p>The hand that wasn't on the wall beside my head moved to my arse, tugging me against his hot, hard erection.</p>
      <p>When his fangs dragged over my nipple I couldn't stop the moan from slipping past my lips, my nails digging into his shoulder blades.</p>
      <p>Suddenly his wings exploded from his back, the force cracking the wall of the shower, and I couldn't help my surprised yelp.</p>
      <p>"Fucking hell," he cursed, hopping from the confines of the shower. As he did his wings unfurled fully, the green of the scales even shinier now that small water droplets reflected the light.</p>
      <p>I couldn't help but stare at him. He was unlike anything I'd ever seen - he was unreal.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry." he said, running a hand through his hair as he closed his eyes, "My wings...this happens when I'm...turned on."</p>
      <p>"Or angry."</p>
      <p>His eyes met mine at the comment, a smile tugging the corner of his mouth up, "How is this not freaking you out?"</p>
      <p>I stepped from the shower, a slight shiver at the cold air against my wet skin passing through me, before I approached him.</p>
      <p>He looked tense, but I was far too turned on to care.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Who was I? </em>
      </p>
      <p>"You sure had a lot of big talk in the carriage, but here, not so much. I'm disappointed, Malfoy." I said, putting on my best Malfoy-smirk.</p>
      <p>He raised an eyebrow, his cock twitching as he obviously thought something over.</p>
      <p>Without a word he pulled me forward, his wings wrapping around me, the soft scales against my back as my front was completely pressed against him.</p>
      <p>Being so completely enveloped by him was intoxicating.</p>
      <p>"Hold on." he murmured, and I suddenly felt the familiar tug of apparition.</p>
      <p>We landed on his bed, soft with silk sheets - I couldn't make out the color but I'd have bet they were green.</p>
      <p>He flipped our positions causing his wings to unfurl behind him - and really I couldn't help staring.</p>
      <p>"There are more interesting things than my wings." he said with a smirk, his lips capturing mine in a kiss.</p>
      <p>His hands were everywhere, my cheeks, my breasts, my hips -</p>
      <p>"Oh, Merlin." I gasped, back arching off the bed as his skilled fingers found my clit.</p>
      <p>"I intend to show you just how little I need my fangs to get you off, Granger." he murmured against my neck in between sharp nips and soft kisses.</p>
      <p>I couldn't find the words to respond to him. The only thing I could focus on was the immense amount of pleasure Malfoy was giving me.</p>
      <p>Turns out those rumors about him were <em>definitely </em>true.</p>
      <p>He was incredibly skilled in bed.</p>
      <p>"Nothing to say?" he asked, one of his slender fingers sliding into my dripping core while his thumb continued its slow circles on my clit, "That's a first."</p>
      <p>"Shut up." I managed to force out, my hips rising to meet the steady thrusting of his finger.</p>
      <p>He smirked, immediately adding a second finger and curving them up in just <em>that </em>-</p>
      <p>"<em>Malfoy!</em>"</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>DPOV</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Granger was fucking perfect.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Perfect.</em>
      </p>
      <p>And after weeks - <em>weeks </em>- of pining after the lovely bint, she was <em>here</em>. She was letting me -</p>
      <p>"I'm coming,"</p>
      <p>And then she was, and fuck if it wasn't the sexiest thing I'd ever seen.</p>
      <p>Her back arched, pushing her pert tits further up, her lips were red and swollen and parted in a silent 'o' as her pussy clenched around my fingers.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Fucking hell I wanted to be inside her.</em>
      </p>
      <p>But first, I wanted to <em>taste</em> her, because bloody hell she smelled divine.</p>
      <p>While small spasms continued to wrack her body, I moved between her thighs, pushing them open and diving in.</p>
      <p>Her unique flavor erupted across my tongue, and fuck it all <em>I wanted more</em>.</p>
      <p>I could hear her gasping above me, her hands tangling into my hair as I licked at her in earnest, alternating between soft strokes and fierce licks.</p>
      <p>"Oh gods...Malfoy..." seconds later she moaned, her smell flooding my senses, and all I could think about was pounding into her tight, wet pussy.</p>
      <p>I kissed my way back up her body, stopping to pay her breasts some attention, before capturing her lips in a kiss and settling between her legs.</p>
      <p>"You're incredible." she murmured, nipping at my bottom lip, a small smile on her face.</p>
      <p>"You haven't seen incredible yet, love."</p>
      <p>Slowly, <em>painfully </em>so in fact, I inched my way inside her inviting heat, not stopping until I was completely seated.</p>
      <p>Her nails were digging into my arms, eyes closed and pinched tight in concentration.</p>
      <p>"You can breathe, Granger." I chuckled.</p>
      <p>She moaned, her eyes fluttering open to glare at me, "Ron and Viktor were not...this endowed." she finished, a blush spreading across her breasts.</p>
      <p>I slowly pulled out, watching her expression the entire time, before slamming into her twice, "That," I said, leaning down so my weight rested on my forearms, "Was for mentioning two other blokes names in <em>my </em>bed."</p>
      <p>Her heart was racing and her pussy was already beginning to clench around me as she said, "Just fuck me, Malfoy."</p>
      <p>I couldn't help the grin that spread across my face - she had no idea what she'd just done.</p>
      <p>Without a word I began pounding into her, my lips exploring her neck, her breasts, her cheeks -</p>
      <p>And she was a writhing mess beneath me and <em>I fucking loved it</em>.</p>
      <p>The buzzing that had been filling my ears ever since we came back to school was finally gone, replaced by a tingling under my skin. My body was on fire and I couldn't focus on anything other than how <em>fucking great </em>she felt underneath me.</p>
      <p>Her arms wrapped around my neck, pulling me into a kiss, and I could <em>feel </em>how close she was.</p>
      <p>I pulled one of her legs up around my hips, angling to hit that perfect spot inside her that would have her coming undone in seconds.</p>
      <p>And it did.</p>
      <p>And this time it was none too quiet.</p>
      <p>Her orgasm ripped through her, her walls clenching around my cock as she moaned my name in-between expletives. Her fingers were tugging at my hair <em>almost </em>painfully, the action making my balls tighten.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Fuck I was close. </em>
      </p>
      <p>I didn't slow my pace, continued to pound through her orgasm in desperate search of my own.</p>
      <p>"Oh my <em>god</em><em>s,</em>" she gasped, her back arching so that her breasts were pressed firmly against my chest, "<em>Draco</em>!"</p>
      <p>The sound of my given name falling from her lips in such a breathless way pushed me over the edge, white light exploding behind my eyes.</p>
      <p>"Fucking hell, Hermione." I groaned, coming harder than I had in my entire bloody life, as my head rested against her breasts.</p>
      <p>We stayed like that for a while, both of us trying to catch our breath.</p>
      <p>After a few moments I felt her fingers tentatively playing with my hair, her breathing slower than it should've been for how fast her heart was beating.</p>
      <p>"Granger?"</p>
      <p>I immediately wished I hadn't spoken, because she tensed, the fingers in my hair stilling before she replied softly, "Yeah?"</p>
      <p>How was I supposed to explain, to the woman who'd been tortured in my home, the woman that <em>I </em>had tortured for years, that she was the only person I could see myself with. Without her...it wasn't just that my body felt a need for her, it was my <em>soul</em> - whatever tiny, shriveled up bit of it was left, anyway.</p>
      <p>I shifted off her, rolling onto my back to stare up at the ceiling. <em>How?</em></p>
      <p>"I'm going to -"</p>
      <p>My hand shot out, grabbing hers before she could leave my bed, "How do you feel?"</p>
      <p>"Can't you tell?" she quipped, a small smirk on her face.</p>
      <p>Her smile made me less tense, and I sat up to face her.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes."</p>
      <p>"Not all the time?" she asked, seemingly surprised.</p>
      <p>I simply shook my head.</p>
      <p>She nodded slowly, adjusting the blanket she'd wrapped around herself, "I...am very confused."</p>
      <p>Okay, confused was good. Confused wasn't regret.</p>
      <p>"Ask me anything, Granger."</p>
      <p>She seemed to study my face for a moment, her toffee-colored eyes searching, before she seemed to find what she was looking for.</p>
      <p>"How do you feel about me?"</p>
      <p>
        <em>Fuck me. </em>
      </p>
      <p>That wasn't the first question I was hoping for.</p>
      <p>I sighed, running a hand through my hair in thought, "I..."</p>
      <p>She bit her lip, worrying it between her teeth for a moment before asking, "You said I was it for you, back in Hogsmeade. Did you mean that? I mean - is that how <em>this</em>," she said, gesturing between the two of us, "Makes you feel?"</p>
      <p>"Yes," I said easily. I didn't know why or even how, really, but something in me just <em>knew</em>.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I...I mean I don't even really <em>know </em>you -"</p>
      <p>"I know you don't feel -"</p>
      <p>"<em>But</em>," she said, glaring at me for my interruption, "I'm willing to."</p>
      <p>
        <em>What?</em>
      </p>
      <p>I felt the need to pinch myself, but refrained.</p>
      <p>"Willing to?"</p>
      <p>"To know you, Malfoy." she said with an eye roll. "You're not like you used to be."</p>
      <p>
        <em>Salazar, I fucking hoped not. </em>
      </p>
      <p>The image of her being tortured in the Manor inspired a kind of rage I hadn't felt before. I felt my wings <em>itching </em>to burst forth again, but I clenched my teeth and focused on the conversation.</p>
      <p>"At least not entirely."</p>
      <p>She chuckled lightly, running a hand through her hair, pushing it back from her face, which exposed the two small dots of where I'd bitten her.</p>
      <p>Without thinking I lifted my hand, trailing my fingers across the slightly raised skin, and I'd be a fucking liar if I said that the soft moan that slipped past her lips didn't go straight to my cock.</p>
      <p>I looked at her face, but her eyes were closed, mouth slightly parted.</p>
      <p>"What does it feel like?"</p>
      <p>Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused for a moment as they met mine, "Sensitive."</p>
      <p>"Oh?" I asked, raising an eyebrow, "What kind of sensitive, Granger?"</p>
      <p>Her cheeks flushed, her pupils blown as I brushed my thumb back and forth across the bite mark.</p>
      <p>The scent of her arousal hit my nose almost instantly, and I couldn't keep the grin off my face, "Oh, <em>that </em>kind of sensitive."</p>
      <p>I leaned forward, flicking my tongue out against her neck, immediately dragging a moan from her. The hand that had been holding the blanket over her breasts moved to my hand, exposing her perfect tits to my gaze again.</p>
      <p>With my free hand I played with her nipples, her soft moans spurring me on, while I forced myself not to bite her.</p>
      <p><em>She had to ask</em>.</p>
      <p>"Please," she groaned, both hands tangled in my hair at this point.</p>
      <p>"Please what?" I asked, dragging my fangs along her collarbone.</p>
      <p>Her shudder made me feel powerful. <em>I </em>was doing this to her.</p>
      <p>"Bite me." she begged, "Please bite me."</p>
      <p>Her voice was soft and desperate, and how the fuck was I supposed to say no to her?</p>
      <p>I tugged her so she was straddling my lap, my left hand moving to her waist as I looked up at her with a smirk. She seemed slightly uncomfortable with the position, but I didn't let her dwell on it.</p>
      <p>I placed a kiss to the curve of her neck where it met her shoulder, before simultaneously pinching her nipple and sliding my fangs into her soft skin.</p>
      <p>She immediately gasped my name, her body arching against mine as her blood exploded over my tongue.</p>
      <p>Never had anything tasted as good as she did.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Intoxicating.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Granger shuddered against me as her orgasm washed over her, her essence coating my now <em>almost </em>painfully hard cock as she writhed above me.</p>
      <p>Her fingers were tangled in my hair, pulling at the strands as she ground herself against my dick, pressing my lips to her neck harder.</p>
      <p>I pulled away from her, not giving her a chance to recover before sliding my aching cock into her still pulsing pussy.</p>
      <p>"Malfoy!" she gasped, head thrown back as she slowly rocked her hips over mine.</p>
      <p>
        <em>She felt fucking divine. </em>
      </p>
      <p>Her hands were on my chest, mine on her hips, helping her begin to bounce on top of me.</p>
      <p>"Oh gods...so deep." she panted.</p>
      <p>I looked down to where we were connected, watching as her tight pussy slid over my cock - and fuck if it wasn't the best thing I'd ever seen - Granger repeatedly taking my dick.</p>
      <p>I sat up, sliding both my hands up her back, pulling her close to me, before attacking her breasts, kissing, licking, and nipping at them, enjoying the various sounds I managed to elicit.</p>
      <p>"Please don't stop." she panted, her pace increasing.</p>
      <p>"Never," I grunted, pressing a rough kiss to her lips before pulling her back down with me, holding her hips still above mine as I began to fuck her in earnest.</p>
      <p>From this position I could clearly hear her every moan against my ear, her fingers tangled in the blankets on either side of my head as I continued to pound into her, my heels digging into the bed.</p>
      <p>Her orgasm caught me off guard, the intense clenching of her walls immediately throwing me over the edge with her.</p>
      <p>She collapsed on my chest, her warm breath ghosting across my nipples as she tried to catch her breath.</p>
      <p>"Fucking hell, Malfoy." she mumbled against my skin.</p>
      <p>I couldn't help the surely idiotic smile that spread across my face, unable to stop it.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully I've thoroughly proved my point."</p>
      <p>At that she laughed, rolling off me to stare up at the ceiling, "You have no idea..."</p>
