    <p>Taking a deep breath as the Hufflepuffs and other Ravenclaws started filing out of the Defense classroom, Caroline stood and waited. Professor Lockhart didn’t notice, busy admiring his hair in a handheld mirror. Once she was quite certain no one still lingered in the hallway outside the door, the seventh year made her approach.</p><p>A quiet cough drew Professor Lockhart’s gaze. “Ah! Miss Persimmons! What can I do for you? Another autograph, perhaps?”</p><p>“Well, sir,” Caroline said as she fought back a blush without success, “I was hoping to talk to you about my essay on Holidays with Hags.”</p><p>The Professor blinked. “I, see. Ah... Ah! You were the one to cross reference with my Marauding with Monsters book, yes?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right, sir.”</p><p>“Well, it seemed a perfectly good essay to me-”</p><p>“But that’s just it, sir!” Caroline’s face reddened further at her bold interruption, but she forged ahead regardless. “You only gave me an Acceptable on it, sir!”</p><p>“...ah.” Blinking a few more times, Professor Lockhart tilted his head a bit to one side, a clearly practiced gesture that allowed the sunlight coming in through the windows glint off his hair all the more handsomely. “What then, Miss Persimmons, are you prepared to do to rectify that?”</p><p>Caroline had to take another deep breath to steel herself. Then she stepped closer, into the man’s personal space, and pushed her shoulders back in order to make her chest more prominent. “Whatever you’d like me to, sir.”</p><p>He stared her down for several long moments. Then his mouth curled into smile, just as charming as always, yet with a hint of something more that caused Caroline to shiver. “I see. I understand perfectly, sweet girl. Do you have anywhere you need to be right now?”</p><p>“No, sir. I have no other plans tonight.” She licked her lips, nervous, but determined to see her decision through. Perhaps a bit more boldness would be in order. “Shall we step into your office, sir?”</p><p>The Professor hummed, his gaze slowly dragging down and back up her body. “Hm, yes, for a moment. But then we may as well continue through the Floo to my quarters, since it is entirely possible we’ll be long enough to miss dinner.”</p><p>Tension coiled through Caroline’s belly, even as she nodded. Her heart fluttered with several emotions; fear, at what she was potentially getting herself into, but also a hint of excitement that it might go well, and of course the hope that she would earn enough goodwill to warrant a change of grade. Following Professor Lockhart through the door to his office just made it all so much stronger.</p><p>“Here we are, my girl,” the man said as he pulled a pinch of Floo powder from a pot decorated in his own likeness. “If you’ll take my arm, we can step through together.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.” Caroline moved to stand directly beside him, their hips touching as she tucked both hands around his extended elbow.</p><p>“Excellent, excellent. The Gilded Room!” A flash of green flame, a step forward, and then Caroline had to wipe some soot from her eyes as the professor swiped his wand over their robes. “There we are, clean as new. Please, set your bag over there, I’ll be back in just a moment.”</p><p>He vanished through an open doorway on the other side of the sitting room, and Caroline took the chance to look around. She set her school bag by the wall as indicated, then ran a hand across the luxuriously soft back of a velvet-covered armchair. All of the professor’s furniture was red velvet, contrasting nicely with the rich amber of the shag carpet and the gold brocade curtains. Portraits of the professor in various heroic poses decorated the walls, along with quite a few autographed photos and enlarged newspaper articles.</p><p>“I thought we might partake in a little refreshment to relax ourselves.” Caroline jumped, not having realized the professor was back. He moved smoothly to her side, and offered one of the long-stemmed glasses he held, nearly full with a dark, maroon colored liquid . “Have you ever tried a good Burgundy wine, Miss Persimmons?”</p><p>“I- no,” she replied, carefully accepting the glass and mimicking how he held the other. “I haven’t tried much alcohol at all, actually.”</p><p>“Well, this may spoil you then; it’s only the very best.” Professor Lockhart raised his glass into air, adopting a pose that made him look particularly dashing. “I propose a toast - to extra credit, and all the good things it delivers.”</p><p>“To extra credit,” Caroline murmured. She raised her glass as well, then took a small sip. It was, different, to say the least. Whatever flavors there were blended together to create a not unpleasant tingle that spread across her tongue and down her throat. Aware that the professor was watching her over the rim of his own glass, Caroline took another, slightly larger sip.</p><p>“Do you like it?” He asked, moving half a step closer. She nodded slowly.</p><p>“It’s, not like anything I’ve had before.”</p><p>“That can be a good thing.” Professor Lockhart moved closer again. “Would you do something for me, Miss Persimmons?”</p><p>“Of course, sir.”</p><p>“Hold very still.” With that, he tilted his head down, and kissed her.</p><p>Caroline didn’t dare resist as his tongue swept across her lips, seeking entry. She’d been kissed by boys before who tried to do the same, with no real idea of what they were doing, and this seemed so much better. The professor took his time, for one thing, and didn’t add groping hands to the mix to distract her.</p><p>When he pulled back, Caroline had to breathe deeply for a moment and found herself leaning back just a tad.</p><p>“Very good, my sweet girl,” Professor Lockhart said, smiling at her. “You taste simply scrumptious.”</p><p>Uncertain how to respond to that, Caroline just nodded.</p><p>“Now, you go ahead and enjoy some more of that Burgundy, while I rearrange things a bit.” She did so, quickly swallowing another gulp. The professor twirled his wand and began levitating the furniture - settee and table and two of the three armchairs were moved aside, along with her bag - as well as closing various curtains. The final chair was set just a bit back from the center of the room, facing towards the fireplace. As soon as he was done with that, the Professor also went and closed his Floo connection, then cast a locking charm on the door leading out of his quarters. Lastly, he Summoned a small chest from his bedroom, which he placed on the floor before sitting in the remaining armchair. “There now, I think we’re ready.”</p><p>Gulping down her last swallow of wine, Caroline set the empty glass on the mantle. “Me too, sir.”</p><p>“Of course you are,” the man practically purred, crossing one leg over the other. “Now... Take of your outer robe, please, let it fall to the floor.”</p><p>Caroline did so, shrugging off the black garment easily. Her heart was still fluttering, but there seemed to be a disconnect between it and her head, which felt quite light all of a sudden.</p><p>“Good girl. Your sweater next.”</p><p>It too fell, landing with a soft whisper on top of her robe.</p><p>“Leave your tie be, please, but unbutton your shirt for me, slowly.”</p><p>Caroline’s fingers fumbled a bit, which certainly kept her slow, but she was glad at least not to have to deal with undoing the knot of her tie. A distant part of her mind wondered at how easily this all was going, but the rest of her eagerly forged on, dismissing any concerns in the face of earning a proper Ravenclaw grade.</p><p>“Slip it off now, that’s right... See, I knew you’d be gorgeous underneath all that extra cloth.” The professor smiled, all charm, but his voice grew huskier with every word. “Turn around now, put your back to me. There you go, sweet girl. Tuck your thumbs into the waistband of your skirt - that’s it, now slide it down, don’t be afraid to bend over as you go.”</p><p>Caroline started to tremble in anticipation as she followed his commands, most of her clothing strewn on the carpet.</p><p>“Hold that pose, sweet girl. Take off your shoes, leave the stockings. Now take a single step backwards.”</p><p>She didn’t realize he’d stood from the chair until she bumped into him. Smooth hands slid around the bare skin of her waist to press against her belly, matching the professor’s murmured encouragements to slowly straighten up. His hands moved as she did so, tracing patterns that raised goosebumps on her flesh, until Caroline stood fully flush against his chest. The man then slipped his fingers beneath her bra, and Caroline gasped when they started to alternate squeezing the soft flesh of her breasts and pinching at her budding nipples. Her own hands began to twitch with the need to do something, which Professor Lockhart clearly noticed.</p><p>“Here now,” he whispered, pausing in the little line of kisses he’d been pressing to her neck. “Let’s take care of that little nuisance, shall we?”</p><p>“Y-yes sir,” Caroline replied, breathless. She whined when one of his hands left off fondling her chest, but he shushed her, grabbing hold of the lower band of the bra and tugging it higher.</p><p>“Lift your arms for me, my sweet, there you go.” Under his command, Caroline lifted both hands as far above her head as they would go, and held the twisted material of her bra in place as well when he slipped it up to her wrists. Then the professor let go, and a moment later the girl realized why.</p><p>He whispered two charms in quick succession: one that shrank the undergarment just enough it served to bind Caroline’s hands together, and another that pinned it into place midair. She wound have whined at the restriction, had he not then returned full attention to kissing and licking and fondling more sensitive areas of her body.</p><p>Caroline couldn’t have said how long it was before the professor’s hands travelled lower once more, to catch the band of her knickers and push them downwards. She tried to catch her breath as his mouth went lower too, planting a trail of kisses down her spine. He left off briefly in order to slip the knickers off her completely, then began licking his way back upwards, putting her firmly into a warm haze once again.</p><p>Next that Caroline was aware, one of Professor Lockhart’s hands gently gripped her jaw and the other pressed something soft to her lips. “Open for me, sweet girl, I promise you’ll like the taste.”</p><p>It wasn’t until the damp bundle had been tucked past her teeth that Caroline realized he’d just put her own folded knickers inside her mouth. She started to mumble a protest, only for him to slide the as-of-yet untouched tie up her neck and arrange the knot directly overtop her mouth. The professor quickly tightened it, preventing Caroline from trying to spit the knickers back out, then brought the loose ends around to the backside of her head to tie another knot. That done, he moved to stand in front of her, eyes glinting.</p><p>“Aren’t you just a treat,” the man said. “Delicious and oh so sweet, and just for me to enjoy tonight. Unfortunately, I do have to go attend dinner now-” he ignored Caroline’s muffled squeak, “-but I promise you shan’t go without attention in my absence.” The professor disappeared from her field of view, and Caroline felt the return of tension to her insides. Being left alone in the man’s private quarters in a very compromising position was not within her comfort zone. Granted, the same could be said of a lot of what they’d done already, but she had to draw a line <i>somewhere.</i></p><p>Unfortunately, trying to say as much was more than a little difficult with the makeshift gag he’d placed on her, and Caroline’s wand was well out of reach, tucked into a pocket of her bag for safekeeping.</p><p>A familiar hand suddenly cupped and squeezed one of her ass cheeks, causing Caroline to jump with a muffled yelp. Chuckling came from behind her, and then Professor Lockhart was back, running his fingers through the dark hair usually kept hidden by Caroline’s knickers.</p><p>“Don’t fuss, my sweet girl,” he crooned. “I just know you’re going to enjoy this.” He held up a small white ball for her to see, along with two connected pieces of looping leather with a pair of obscure oblong shapes attached to one. “Clearly, you don’t recognize what these are, but I promise you’ll be just <i>wild</i> about them soon enough.”</p><p>That said, the professor reached down and tucked the little ball <i>inside</i> of Caroline. She squealed a bit at the intrusion in a place only her own fingers had before explored. Then the pieces of leather were positioned, one fitted like a belt around her hips while the other went between her legs to connect again in the back. A very odd set of knickers, it seemed.</p><p>Professor Lockhart whispered some sort of activation spell, his wand tapping the belt, and the whole thing tightened to fit her form. Caroline couldn’t help but squirm when the oblong things found their own ways inside her too - one followed after the ball, pushing it deeper, while the other nudged it’s way into the hole between her cheeks. Both were odd in the extreme, the latter bordering on being downright uncomfortable, but at least they weren’t more than an inch or so long.</p><p>Caroline looked up into Professor Lockhart’s eyes, and shivered once more at how he was watching her.</p><p>“All settled?” He asked. “Good, then I must be off. I will try to hurry back after dessert, but I’m sure you know how I can be held up by admirers so often. Oh, and before I forget-” he paused in the little foyer leading to the main door, and gave his wand a pair of jabs. <i>“Excitant.”</i></p><p>Caroline shrieked.</p><p>The ball had begun to <i>vibrate</i> and almost seemed as if it were changing shape inside of her. Even worse, the two oblong shafts were moving too - growing, both longer and bigger around, the one in front pushing the ball deeper and deeper. Caroline squeezed her legs together, trying to do something to get them to stop, but the hard leather of the belts prevented her from having any effect. A few moments later, the shafts felt as though they were shrinking again, and she breathed a sigh of relief - only to regret it when they reverted a second time. The ball, too, apparently had a pattern, alternating stronger and softer vibrations, stuck to the end of the front shaft as it was pulled and pushed around. Caroline started to shake, a tingling heat building inside her, as the strangeness of the sensations began to be replaced by something bizarrely <i>pleasant.</i></p><p>Far, <i>far</i> beyond the boundaries of her comfort zone, the girl cast a desperate look towards the foyer - but Professor Lockhart, it seemed, was long gone.</p>

  <p>-Extra Credit-</p>
</center>“...and quite normally, yes, a good barrage of spells is just the thing to take down a mountain troll, but I had been here, I’m sure I’d have easily been able to dispose of the terrifying creature on my own, thus sparring my fellow teachers the need to face it,” Gilderoy finished with a blinding grin. The half dozen or so students in front of him sighed appropriately, and he finished the final autograph with a flourish. “Now, I look forward to seeing you dear girls tomorrow, but as I’m quite sure you’re aware, we all need our rest to look proper in the morning!”<p>A chorus of <i>goodnight, Professor!</i>s followed him down the hall, as Gilderoy tried not to look too eager to get back to his quarters. Catering to his fans usually took precedence, after all, and he didn’t want anyone becoming suspicious as to just what treat awaited him.</p><p>Checking the surrounding hallway before unlocking his door, the man swiftly stepped inside and sealed it again. He went ahead and physically took off his boots and outer robes in the foyer, then banished the rest of his clothing. While a great deal more relaxed than it had been earlier while, ahem, ‘setting up’, his cock was still somewhat hard, and quite eager to spring to the fore with proper inspiration.</p><p>Gilderoy peered around the corner, and found more than enough.</p><p>Miss Persimmons stood exactly where he’d left her two hours before, arms suspended above her and head thrown back, eyes clenched shut. Her knees and thighs were pressed tightly together as the girl shifted in place, clearly trying to manipulate the toys inside her. Body soaked in sweat, an appealing flush darkening her pale skin, Persimmons looked ten times more desirable than before. She’d melt beneath him before the night was through.</p><p>Well aware of just how distracted the girl was, Gilderoy took his time sauntering forward, the thick carpet muffling his footsteps. Only once he stood directly in front of her in an appropriate stance did the man speak. “It seems you’re well past earning an Exceeds Expectations, Miss Persimmons.”</p><p>The girl’s head snapped up, eyes wide, her teeth clenched beautifully against the knotted blue fabric of her gag. Gilderoy arched an eyebrow, allowing himself to smirk. “Ready to be done with the toys and earn an Outstanding, my sweet girl?”</p><p>She moaned, skin reddening even more with embarrassment at the wanton sound. Gilderoy was tempted to make her beg a bit more eloquently, but the increased throbbing in his cock decided otherwise. Moving swiftly, he scooped the girl up into his arms, ending the charm holding up her bra-turned-restraint at the same time. Persimmons was little more than a limp ragdoll in his embrace, and small enough he easily carried her into the bedroom. Once there, he gently deposited her onto the sinfully large expanse of silk sheets, and detached the clips of the modified chastity belt.</p><p>Persimmons moaned again as Gilderoy oh so slowly drew out the front shaft and vibrator, both shiny and slick from her pleasure. Then he did the same with the anal shaft, which earned a noise that was a bit more whine than moan.</p><p>“Just look at you,” he murmured, casting the belt aside and climbing onto the bed himself. “Such a filthy mess, my sweetness, you’ve completely fallen apart and utterly enjoyed it, haven’t you?”</p><p>She whined once more, whether in protest or agreement, he couldn’t tell. Gilderoy moved her still-bound arms to lay on the sheets above her head, then started mouthing at one of the girl’s breasts as he lined himself up.</p><p>Pushing into her was wonderful, his toys always did such a splendid job of turning a partner’s insides soft and pliant. Persimmons started to gasp as Gilderoy gradually sped up, her shivering turning into full-blown shudders when he tipped her over the edge. There came a delightful scream of pleasure, her walls squeezing against his cock with delicious heat. After that, Persimmons fell back, awake but only just.</p><p>“Wasn’t that perfect?” He asked her, not expecting a response. “But we aren’t quite done yet, my sweet, I still need my turn.” Sufficiently close to climaxing, he eased back out of her. The girl whimpered as he turned her over, but made no move to resist. Rising onto his knees, Gilderoy pulled her up just enough, then slammed his cock forward into the hole already stretched and waiting for him. Persimmons moved automatically, flinching away from the intrusion with a startled shriek. Gilderoy didn’t bother with reassurances or sweet nothings as he pounded, focused solely on his own growing heat and the need for release.</p><p>It wasn’t long at all before he came, his own juices mingling with hers in a moment of perfect ecstasy. He pushed Persimmons over the edge of another charge, or else she was finished off by his finale; either way, the girl was out cold when he finally pulled himself free. Breathing heavily, Gilderoy smiled, more than pleased with himself. He retrieved his wand and used a quick cleaning charm to tidy himself. After doing the same for Persimmons, he moved to perform the usual Memory Charm - and paused.</p><p>The previous two occasions when he’d done this - first with a Gryffindor in Sixth Year, then a Slytherin in Fifth - removing all knowledge of the evening had been a must. The underage girls could have easily cried rape and gotten him into serious trouble, tarnished his reputation. Persimmons, on the other hand, was technically seventeen, not to mention a pliable Ravenclaw desperate for perfect grades. He’d be able to deliberately give her less than stellar marks and offer further “extra credit”, and if she ever protested, point out that <i>she’d</i> been the one to approach <i>him.</i> It wouldn’t have worked with the others, as both held the age of consent card in their hands.</p><p>And really, why shouldn’t he have a more tangible reward for his time spent teaching the snot-nosed brats of the next generation? Persimmons managed to check most of his required boxes, being reasonably intelligent but not calculating; old enough to have fully bloomed physically while still young and naive mentally; and most important, pretty, but not so much she could ever outshine him.</p><p>Chuckling, Gilderoy rolled her over once more in order to give the girl a quick peck on the lips. Yes, perhaps leaving her memory intact would work out for the better.</p><p>He vanished her underthings for simplicity’s sake, but undid the knots on her tie so as to leave it for a souvenir. Then Gilderoy summoned over the rest of her clothes and quickly slipped them all back on the girl, pausing only when she let out a soft, sleepy mumble. As soon as Persimmons was outwardly presentable once more, he scooped her up again and headed for the fireplace. He only just remembered to summon her bag to hand before stepping through the Floo.</p><p>From his office, Gilderoy carried Persimmons through the empty halls of the old castle, slowing down when needed to avoid the voices of others. Soon enough they arrived at the entrance to Ravenclaw Tower, and he used his position as Professor to bypass the inaine riddle and get inside.</p><p>Only a couple of Upper Years yet remained in the common room, but they all jumped to their feet upon realizing just who had entered.</p><p>“Blimey, sir, is Caroline alright?” One of the boys asked, quickly approaching.</p><p>“Yes, she’s quite fine,” Gilderoy answered, as the girl herself started to come to in his arms. “Miss Persimmons, while I’m quite capable of maintaining this posture, it would be a relief to see you wake up.</p><p>“Hm...? Oh!” Eyes going from a bleary haze to sudden awareness, the girl jerked upright, nearly falling from his embrace. “Oh no! I-”</p><p>“There’s nothing to apologize for, dear girl,” Gilderoy interrupted. “You fell asleep in my office, working on that extra credit assignment, so I decided the best thing would be to let you rest while I carried you home again.”</p><p>“That’s awfully kind of you, sir,” another of the students complimented, fluttering her eyelashes at him. “We’ll make sure Caroline gets to bed without any trouble.”</p><p>“As I’m sure you will! Well then, goodnight children, I look forward to seeing you all in class.” Gilderoy smiled at them and headed for the door; already, he could hear questions about what Persimmons had done to deserve extra credit, and felt a tremor of worry that the girl wouldn’t be able to keep their secret.</p><p>Then he heard her reply that it was just adding a bit on to one of her essays, including more details about Gilderoy himself, and the worry vanished.</p><p>“Goodnight, sweet girl,” he murmured, stepping through the door. “I especially look forward to seeing you <i>after</i> class.”</p>
