    <p>Hermione leaned over the floor of Grimmauld’s basement and marked the last of her runes on the stone slabs. She stood up, observing the intricate runic circle that radiated magic. Counting the moons in her head, Hermione double checked the numbers. Jupiter was ascending, so yes her math checked out and her circle was even.</p>
<p><br/> “Don’t worry,” reassured Harry. “Ron will be here to heal us.”</p>
<p><br/> “I don’t want to heal you,” grumbled Ron.</p>
<p><br/> “Besides,” he continued, “It looks perfect. Your circles are even perfect. Looks like all that time with the compass was worth it.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron groaned. “No it wasn’t. My hand still trembles just thinking about circles.”</p>
<p><br/> “I know, I know. I’m just worried,” said Hermione, chewing on the ends of her hair. It was a bad habit and Fleur would most likely scold her for it. With the baby on its way, the veela’s maternal instincts were at an all-time high. “If it’s even the slightest bit is off, the room could blow up again.”</p>
<p><br/> Harry shrugged. A wide grin stretched across his face. “My last ritual blew up in my face, but I can speak to the dead! It’s weird, very guttural, but now Teddy can speak to Remus and Tonks whenever so there’s that. Also, it’s very similar to the lowland streaked tenrec, which I can also speak! Tenrec is at a much higher pitch but oddly enough they have a lot of overlapping words. Kinda weird how things work out.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron sighed heavily and ignored the tenrec part. He could ponder that later, after Harry used it to get into trouble. “What,” he said, words slow and over pronounced, “did I say about doing rituals without me?”</p>
<p><br/> “Er, nothing?” asked Harry. “You said experiments, not rituals and this is supposed to be safe! I found it in Salazar’s Library.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron groaned and flopped to the ground. Hermione checked her circle one last time, and gestures to the boys as she bounced in excitement.<br/> “Okay, you can come in.”</p>
<p><br/> Quickly, and with great care not to disturb Hermione’s chalking, they walked into the innermost circle; it was barely large enough to hold all three of them. They were all rather grateful that Ron was so skinny and that Harry was still small. Not that Harry would admit it. He hated being short. Hated it. At least Luna was smaller.</p>
<p><br/> Hermione began to chant. The small golden scar on her right hand began to glow, golden spots popping up like gleaming freckles on her dark skin and quickly grew larger. Her eyes flashed gold as the spell came to a climax. The candles flickered; dust was stirred up and blown off of cabinets and old books. Harry sneezed. Hermione glared at him in annoyance, missing a beat. She went back to chanting, but the damage was done. The dust turned gold and started to spin around the circle.</p>
<p><br/> Ron stared at him in disbelief. “Oh Merlin,” he said.</p>
<p><br/> “Sorry,” said Harry below his breath.</p>
<p><br/> Suddenly Hermione’s chanting slowed and the dust died down. Harry sneezed again, his body trembling with the force.</p>
<p><br/> “Harry,” scolded Hermione, her voice higher than usual.</p>
<p><br/> “Sorry,” Harry said, looking up at her and reading to get a verbal smackdown. He took a deep breath and gaped at her. “Merlin,” he whispered.</p>
<p><br/> “Hermione, Harry,” Ron breathed out. “You're kids.”</p>
<p><br/> Hermione’s hands went up to his face. Harry spun around to look at the tiny kids, all of whom were gaping at the castle they were in. Castle.</p>
<p><br/> “Guys,” said Harry. “I think we’re at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p><br/> “What,” sneered Draco, who was close enough to hear Harry’s words. “Can’t believe it? Are you like Longbottom, a step away from being a squib?”</p>
<p><br/> Harry glared at him before his face broke into a grin.</p>
<p><br/> “Oh Merlin,” said Ron.</p>
<p><br/> Hermione on the other hand, matched Harry’s grin. “Oh no,” she said. “I’ve always known I had magic. I read Matilda a while ago and couldn’t help but try to mimic it. It was easy, once I figured out to focus. And of course, I never had to worry about not having magic either. My parents would love me either way.”</p>
<p><br/> “Hermione,” said Harry slowly, eyes widening in mock surprise. “Malfoy’s parents would love him either way too. I mean, it’s not like they’re bigots.”</p>
<p><br/> “Hermione, Harry,” hissed Ron. “He is eleven.”</p>
<p><br/> The trio looked over at Draco, who had a look of forced indifference.</p>
<p><br/> “Fuck,” said Hermione.</p>
<p><br/> “Look, we’re sorry,” apologized Harry.</p>
<p><br/> “I’m sure you parents do love you,” said Hermione.</p>
<p><br/> “And even if they don’t,” said Harry reasonably, “somebody has to. Besides, nobody has loved me besides my parents.”</p>
<p><br/> “Oh yeah,” grimaced Ron. “The Dursleys.”</p>
<p><br/> Hermione looked at Harry critically. “You know, you’re very small.”</p>
<p><br/> Harry’s wand shot to his hand and he gripped it. “I will turn your hair yellow.”</p>
<p><br/> Hermione scowled. “I hate yellow,” she said vehemently. “Gold too. And green: bright, acid green.”</p>
<p><br/> “Like my eyes,” offered Harry.</p>
<p><br/> “No,” said Hermione. “Your eyes are more alive. An emerald color. They’re pretty”</p>
<p><br/> Ron smirked. “And as green as a freshly picked toad.”</p>
<p><br/> When McGonagall walked in, Harry Potter was choking on his laughter, Draco Malfoy looked thoroughly bewildered, Ron Weasley had a look of smug satisfaction, and Hermione Granger, the promising muggleborn she had lead through Diagon Alley, was looking into thin air like she had a puzzle she couldn’t wait to tear apart and figure out. She had seen looks like that. When the marauders had walked in, it was the same: eager anticipation and determination.</p>
<p><br/> The first years followed McGonagall and lined up as they waited to be called off. There were frantic whispers when all they could see was an old hat. They were staring at it as if it were rabid.</p>
<p><br/> “A hat?” came a tentative whisper.</p>
<p><br/> A rip in The Hat’s brim opened and it began to sing. Somehow it sounded like rocks grating together mixed with the clear pitch of a well tuned violin. It was cacophonous and listening would give anyone a headache as they tried to comprehend how something could be tuneless and rhythmic.</p>
<p><br/> “I think the Hat would be rather good at Gregorian chants,” said Harry, lost in thought.</p>
<p><br/> “I think you’re insane,” muttered Ron. “Anyways, the spell was messed up and we’re kids, right? Went back into our younger bodies?” said Ron, lowering his voice so they wouldn’t be heard over the hat’s song.</p>
<p><br/> “I think so,” said Hermione under her breath. “I’m a chronomancer. I deal with time, not parallel universes.”</p>
<p><br/> “Parallel universes would be bad,” agreed Harry. “I can barely remember this past. A different one would be impossible. What about our younger selves? A soul fusion, maybe. And speaking of souls and onto more important topics, how did they animate the Hat? A soul? A fake soul? A real soul?”</p>
<p><br/> “There’s definitely an accumulation of magic that promotes sentience,” replied Hermione.</p>
<p><br/> “Yeah,” said Ron, “but it makes decisions, you know? That’s more than just magically accumulated based sentience.”</p>
<p><br/> Hermione nodded slowly. “Yes, well, it is some of it.”</p>
<p><br/> “We never said it wasn’t,” pointed out Harry. “Just that it wasn’t all of it.”</p>
<p><br/> “I suppose,” said Hermione thoughtfully. “It would make an interesting project.”</p>
<p><br/> “Or we could just ask the Hat,” offered Ron.</p>
<p><br/> They three students stared at it for a while. Susan Bones got into Hufflepuff and Seamus Finnegan went to Gryffindor and Goyle was surprisingly a hatstall before being sent off to Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Granger, Hermione!” McGonagall called out.</p>
<p><br/> Hermione grinned and eagerly strolled to the stool, jamming the Hat onto her head.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Hello Hat</em>, she said happily.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Ms. Granger</em>, replied the Hat. <em>Back again?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>It was Harry’s fault</em>, Hermione said and the Hat gave a dry chuckle. <em>Anyways, how are you enchanted?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>That</em>, the Hat said, <em>is a secret. But there is a fourth year Slytherin who is trying to find out the same thing. She’s snuck into the Headmaster’s office several times in order to talk to me.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Alexandra Jenkins?</em> Asked Hermione. <em>She was an unspeakable with me. Best friends with a Hufflepuff, though I can’t remember her name.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Yes, yes,</em> said the Hat. <em>Still, I do need to sort you. Any ideas?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Not really, no,</em> said Hermione. <em>Life’s more fun when there are mysteries to figure out.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>It’s nice to know that you’ve learned how to let go of control</em>, said the Hat. <em>You were so scared. You needed to reassurance of control. Well, moving onto sorting. It would be boring to repeat myself, let's cross out Gryffindor. You’re still as clever as ever but Ravenclaw has never quite fit you. You’d eat the Slytherins alive. Hardworking, determined, and loyal. Yes, you’ll do well in</em> “HUFFLEPUFF,” the hat screamed out loud. Hermione winked at Harry and Ron as she went off to sit with the puffs.</p>
<p><br/> “Blimey, I never saw that coming,” said Ron as Wayne Hopkins followed Hermione to Hufflepuff.</p>
<p><br/> “I thought she was a shoe in for Slytherin,” agreed Harry.</p>
<p><br/> “No, the Hat wouldn’t do that to the poor Slytherins,” said Ron.</p>
<p><br/> “I’m not so sure,” said Harry. “I mean, the Hat has got to be bored. I bet it likes to stir up some trouble every now and then.”</p>
<p><br/> “Maybe,” said Ron doubtfully. “Oh, look. It Neville’s turn.”</p>
<p><br/> They watched what little of Neville’s face they could see screw up.</p>
<p><br/> “I think he’s arguing with the Hat,” said Ron.</p>
<p><br/> “That won’t do him any good,” replied Harry. “The Hat’s a stubborn bastard.”</p>
<p><br/> “I thought you said it gave you a choice,” said Ron quizzically.</p>
<p><br/> Harry waved a hand dismissively. “I thought it did,” said Harry, “but it was really just amused that my largest reason not to go to Slytherin was Snowflake.”</p>
<p><br/> “Gryffindor!” yelled the Hat and the two watched Neville run off with it still on his head.</p>
<p><br/> “Yikes,” said Harry.</p>
<p><br/> “Poor kid,” agreed Ron and they clapped politely.</p>
<p><br/> “We should get him in our study group,” said Harry. “He’s great at herbology and I hate plants; it’s one of the few things that Hermione can never get quite right.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron sighed and rubbed his temples. He had a feeling the next few years were going to be a catastrophe. “Just don’t harass him.”</p>
<p><br/> “Me? Never,” protested Harry. “Besides, I like Neville.”</p>
<p><br/> “Malfoy, Draco!” yelled McGonagall.</p>
<p><br/> Draco swaggered off, which looked rather trying seeing how short he was.</p>
<p><br/> “Look!” cooed Harry. “Baby Snowflake.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron snorted. “He hated when you called that back in the 2000s, he’s going to hate it even more now.”</p>
<p><br/> “We’ll leave his family out of it,” said Harry. “So nicknames are fair game.”</p>
<p><br/> “Slytherin!” yelled the Hat.</p>
<p><br/> “That took longer than last time,” said Ron, toying with his earlobe.</p>
<p><br/> “We should get our ears pierced,” Harry said, watching Ron’s nervous tick. “Or you might just pull your ear off by the end of the year.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron hummed, not an agreement or disagreement.</p>
<p><br/> “Or,” said Harry, “you could wait for Bill to take you. Actually, do you see him this summer?”</p>
<p><br/> Ron muttered something under his breath. “I think so. Not for long, thought.”</p>
<p><br/> Harry shrugged, “if it’s more than an hour, you could ask him to pierce your ears this summer.”</p>
<p><br/> Ron nodded slowly. “Yeah. Yeah, that might work.”</p>
<p><br/> “Potter, Harry!” called McGonagall. The whispers broke out.</p>
<p><br/> “You see him?”</p>
<p><br/> “The one with the glasses.”</p>
<p><br/> “He’s so small!”</p>
<p><br/> Okay, whoever just called him small was getting socked. He tipped his head back, put on the same smirk he had seen his father use in the pensive and strolled to the Hat. Harry winked at Snape before he put the Hat on and barely had time to see the look of pure contempt cover Snape’s face before the Hat covered his eyes.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Mr. Potter</em>, said the Hat. <em>Tricky as ever.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Did Hermione ask how your sentience work?</em> Asked Harry.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Yes, she did, so you can ask her about it.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Fair enough</em>, conceded Harry. <em>Actually, do you have a name? It’s annoying to just keep on calling you Hat</em>.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Of course I have a name</em>, said that Hat. <em>But that is inconsequential. Where shall I put you?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Anywhere you desire,</em> said Harry. <em>But I would like to know your name</em>.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Plenty of courage in you, yes, that hasn’t changed,</em> said the Hat, completely ignoring Harry.</p>
<p><br/> <em>You know my name,</em> protested Harry. <em>It’s only fair that I get to know yours.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>And still loyal to those you love,</em> said the Hat. <em>But your work ethic leaves much to be desired. And I must say, the years have dulled you cunning.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Not really,</em> Harry argued. <em>There’s just very little I must be cunning in order to get. And when I do get clever and plotting, I seem to double cross myself somehow.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Yes, that’s always been a talent of yours,</em> agreed the Hat. <em>But while you grown less Slytherin, you’ve certainly learned how to think.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>I’ve been stuck with Hermione most of my life,</em> said Harry. <em>How could I avoid learning how to think?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>But it wasn’t all Ms. Granger, now was it?</em> <em>You’ve come to enjoy experimenting, come to love magic in its convenience and its brilliance. Well, Mr. Potter, I’ve seen where you belong.</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>Wait a minute,</em> said Harry. <em>What about your name?</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>You’ll surely have the most fun in -</em></p>
<p><br/> <em>I need your name!</em> said Harry.</p>
<p><br/> “RAVENCLAW!” screamed the Hat as Harry groaned. There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p><br/> <em>I’m not leaving</em>, he said stubbornly, <em>until I have a name!</em></p>
<p><br/> The Ravenclaws burst out in applause. One older student screamed to “take that, Gryffindors!” The applause and cheers died down as boy-who-lived stayed under the Hat.</p>
<p><br/> “Maybe he wanted Gryffindor?” suggested one person and whispers, once again, broke out like a bad case of hives.</p>
<p><br/> Finally, McGonagall pulled the Hat off of Harry’s head. “Mr. Potter!” she began to scold.</p>
<p><br/> “It won’t tell me its name!” said Harry. “It told me it had one, but it won’t say what!” Dumbledore snorted and McGonagall glared at him.</p>
<p><br/> “Be that as it is, Mr. Potter, you cannot delay the sorting. If you truly want to find out the Hat’s name, I suggest doing it later. I’m sure the Headmaster will be able to find the time to accommodate you.”</p>
<p><br/> “I’ll do that,” said Harry. “Thank you, Professor McGonagall.” Harry easily went to join the Ravenclaws who gave a feeble applause, confused about the Hat.</p>
<p><br/> “That Hat has a name?” someone asked.</p>
<p><br/> “I mean, I guess,” someone else answered.</p>
<p><br/> “The boy-who-lived is nutters,” despaired another.</p>
<p><br/> “Rivers, Oliver!” McGonagall called up and the voices quieted.</p>
<p><br/> Ron shook his head in annoyance. One normal day, full of tea and warm fires and comfy sweaters. He could cook and maybe Harry would even help. But no, Harry would most likely plot something with Hermione and a giggling Teddy. Neville would unleash some sort of plant on his kitchen while Luna and Rolf would look at each other like they had never loved anyone more. Maybe Bill and Fleur would come over with Victorie. George would come over, and while he wouldn't crack jokes in the same way he did when Fred was here, he’d laugh when they’d joke around him.</p>
<p><br/> “Fred!” Ron whispered urgently. “Merlin’s sweet wand, fuck!”</p>
<p><br/> Lisa Turpin and Blaise Zabini, who were the only ones left besides him, looked at him strangely.</p>
<p><br/> “Turpin, Lisa!” called McGonagall.</p>
<p><br/> Ron watched as she went up to the platform, but his mind was in overdrive. It was like watching Harry fight a dragon or Hermione grin maniacally over a potion: a feeling in his gut saying that suddenly, shit was about to hit the fan.</p>
<p><br/> They were displaced in time, without Teddy to keep Harry sane. They were going to look at the ghosts of their family members each day. Hermione was in Hufflepuff with Cedric Diggory. Fred was alive at Gryffindor.</p>
<p><br/> “Fuck,” Ron repeated.</p>
<p><br/> “Scared the Hat won’t even know where to put you?” asked Zabini, not mockingly but also not concerned.</p>
<p><br/> “Not really,” said Ron. “I’m scared that I’m going to separated from my idiots.”</p>
<p><br/> Before Zabini could question what Ron was talking about, Ron was called up and sitting on the stool.</p>
<p><br/> <em>And so you’re the last time traveler,</em> mused the Hat.</p>
<p><br/> <em>Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff</em>, Ron chanted.</p>
<p><br/> <em>You could do well at either house</em>, agreed the Hat. <em>You’re clever and loyal, certainly. You’re willing to work hard and be imaginative. But your mind is strategic, always plotting the best way. Your hard work is all for your loyalty-based goal: to keep your friends safe. Really, Mr. Weasley, you aren’t a challenge. You would destroy the world to protect them, with such ambition. Love, after all, can be a Slytherin trait when it is as strong as yours; but it is rare for children to have such love. For you all are children now, with children’s bodies, magic, minds, and emotions. Good luck Mr. Weasley in keeping those two alive. I think you’ll find that your greatest help is in</em> “SLYTHERIN!”</p>
