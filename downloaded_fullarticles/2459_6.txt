  <b> Prompt: Newt being sleepy, mornings are difficult and of course he's making a mess during breakfast. Gellert or Albus or the two (you decide :D ) react(s) to this cute Magizoologist morning "routine" :) </b>
</p>
<p>The first thing Albus and Gellert found out about Newt when they started living with him was that Newt was utterly useless in the morning.</p>
<p>It took him at least an hour, along with tea and at minimum 7 hours of sleep to be well-rested and wake up. Usually, since Newt would spend hours working on his book and caring for his creatures Newt rarely got even 5 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Their first morning together as a triad, Gellert woke up first. As an insomniac, this wasn’t unusual. In their large bed, the blonde watched with a small smile as Albus and Newt curled closer together as they lost Gellert’s body heat.</p>
<p>Gellert had already known by then that Albus was a light sleeper so he’d gotten fairly good at getting out of bed without waking up Albus. From what he knew about Newt, the Magizoologist slept like a rock. It was a little hilarious.</p>
<p>Unless he was in his case or their expanded basement, in which case even the softest sound of a Billywig flying past him would wake him up.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Albus woke up, too and they waited a while for Newt to wake up. Their Magizoologist worked so hard so they decided to let him sleep.</p>
<p>Until it was well past noon and there was no sign of Newt waking up.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t he feed his creatures in the morning?” Albus asked, both of them standing in the doorway and watching Newt.</p>
<p>Gellert shrugged,</p>
<p>“Maybe his assistant does it?”</p>
<p>Around 2 in the afternoon, they heard a thump from upstairs, as if someone had fallen onto the floor. It was followed by Newt cursing in a language neither Albus or Gellert recognized.</p>
<p>When Newt came downstairs, he didn’t acknowledge either Gellert or Albus but waved his wand lazily to start the kettle. He then practically collapsed into the kitchen table, he rested his head in his arms and it looked like he had fallen back asleep.</p>
<p>“Newt?” Albus asked,</p>
<p>The Magizoologist looked up at him, glaring slightly but the mix of him being in his PJ’s and his long fringe ruined the effect. He looked like a wet kitten, which Gellert told him.</p>
<p>That first morning had been weird, seeing Newt literally come to life as he sipped his tea was like watching a sunrise.</p>
<p>They watched him, and like casting a lumos one moment he wasn’t awake and in the next he was.</p>
<p>The Magizoologist smiled at both of them, dropping the empty teacup into the sink. He kissed both of them and left to go downstairs.</p>
<p>The German and Brit stared at one another.</p>
<p>“Was he like this at school?”</p>
<p>“I never had him in my morning classes.”</p>
<p>Several months later, the two of them had a system figured out. Once Albus and Gellert were both awake, if they started on breakfast and made tea and basically picked up Newt and brought him downstairs and forced the tea down his throat he’d start to wake up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if they let him sleep, Newt really would sleep well into the afternoon.</p>
<p>If Newt figured out what they were doing, he never commented on it. What he would do is kiss both of them and show his appreciation in other but very nice ways.</p>
<p>Once, Albus brought it up to Theseus who laughed in his face.</p>
<p>“He’s always been like that.” Theseus explained “Just wait till he’s been up all night helping the Graphorns give birth or getting a creature to adjust to a new habitat, then it’s going to be fun.”</p>
<p>When Albus told Gellert that, both of them felt a dawning horror.</p>
<p>Newt had mentioned the day before that Meela, his female Graphorn was pregnant again.</p>
<p>“Well, we knew what we were getting into, right?” Albus suggested weakly, resting his head against Gellert’s shoulder, the two of them sitting on the couch.<br/>The German groaned, dropping his head to the top of the couch.</p>
<p>“Why are the weirdest ones always the most attractive?”</p>
<p>Albus lightly pinched him for that.</p>
<p>“The same could be said about you.”</p>
<p>Through the open doorway to the basement, both of them could hear Newt coming up the stairs. If they were going to deal a bratty sleepy Newt soon, they were going to make him work for it tonight.</p>
<p>Maybe they’d finally get Newt into that dress they had gotten for him?</p>
