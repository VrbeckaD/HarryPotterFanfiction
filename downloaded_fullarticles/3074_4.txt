          <div class="userstuff"><p>Less than an hour after The Prophet hit the newsstands, the Howlers began to arrive; exploding into little showers of golden sparks as they hit the wards.</p><p>
  <em>Pervert.</em>
</p><p>By the third day they were still going strong. They started to come by regular owl to get through the wards.</p><p><em>Filth</em>.</p><p>It took a week for the owls to stop trying, for the Muggle postman pick up the slack. They were Incendio-ed in the fireplace all the same.</p><p>
  <em>Sinful.</em>
</p><p>He hadn't left the house in two weeks. He hadn't left the sofa in one. Stewing in his own anger, his self-hatred, his filth.</p><p>
  <em>Faggot.</em>
</p><p>He only kept one letter; the only one that had raised a smile during the longest month of his twenty-two years.</p><p>Â </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Scarhead,</p>
  <p>I hated you before it was cool.</p>
  <p>Yours,<br/> DM</p>

    <small>P.S. You'll still be a git next month when Skeeter picks her new victim, regardless of where you stick your dick.</small>
