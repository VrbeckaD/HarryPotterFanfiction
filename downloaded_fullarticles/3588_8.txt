    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="western" align="left">Not for the first time, Credence woke to the clash of steel on steel outside his window. Reality always took a few minutes to kick in – he stumbled out of bed in a haze of disoriented self-preservation instincts and went to the window.</p><p class="western" align="left">In the practice yard outside, two figures in padded armour were circling each other in the half-light of just past dawn, their blunted blades crashing together in a sudden flurry. The smaller of the two darted back out of arm’s reach and when her opponent followed, she stuck out her foot at the last minute. Percival did not fall for it, too used to the tactics of children after years as an instructor. He disarmed Modesty with an easy flick of his wrist and laughed at her annoyed pout.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Good try,” he said. “Your footwork is improving.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I’m going to beat you one day,” Modesty warned him. “I’ll knock you into the <em>mud</em>.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“It’s good to have ambitions,” Percival said serenely. He sent Modesty off to the armoury with a light push, then noticed Credence at the window and strolled over to smile up at him. “Sorry, did we wake you?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“She means it,” Credence told him, leaning his elbows on the sill. “Watch out.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I know she means it. I’m counting on her getting there someday. Go back to bed, Credence.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I’m awake now, I won’t be able to sleep again.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival grinned over his shoulder as he turned for the armoury. “Oh, I know that too.”</p><p class="western" align="left">There would come a time, Credence told himself, when Percival would say something like that and he would <em>not</em> blush to the roots of his hair. He turned away from the window to look at the bed, where the sheets were crumpled and still warm from his body heat, and both pillows wore the indents of a shared night. It had been Percival’s bed for a long time, presumably through many sexual partners before Credence moved in three weeks ago, and Credence still did not know quite how he felt about his place in it.</p><p class="western" align="left">On the one hand: arriving as he had with nothing but the clothes on his back and a nine-year-old sister to look after, there had been no question of Credence finding his own place. Not that he had <em>wanted</em> to, he had hardly crossed worlds to live on his own, but sometimes the thought nagged at him. He had expected too much, and he had been given it. What was he supposed to do with that?</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence had been sleeping in Percival’s bed from the start, though it had been some time before they crossed the line from ‘trying to take it slow’ to ‘we are <em>sharing </em>a <em>bed </em>and may as well enjoy it’. And Credence was enjoying it, dear God was he enjoying it. If he lay awake sometimes with Percival asleep beside him and sweat turning cold on his skin and his mother’s voice in his ears – if he was still waiting for the other shoe to drop – he told himself that the time would come when that changed too. Credence was accustomed to obedience, not faith.</p><p class="western" align="left">“He wants you,” he told himself out loud. “He wants you and you want him and it doesn’t have to be complicated.”</p><p class="western" align="left">In that spirit, he pulled off his nightshirt and stood naked in the first sunlight of the day, feet bare against the worn-down floorboards as he padded to the dresser and washed his face in the magic basin that always produced clean water at precisely the right temperature. No wonder Percival had scoffed at the plumbing in his world. Credence lifted his head, ready to reaffirm his fuckability in the mirror. He mostly just looked young and clueless. He would be twenty one in November, or rather, in Macusa’s equivalent of November, and everything that he had spent those twenty one years learning to be good at belonged in a town he would never see again.</p><p class="western" align="left">He heard the creak of the door opening and turned away from his reflection in time to see Percival walk in, casually stripping off his own shirt. That was not a sight Credence was likely to get tired of any time soon. He hovered for a few moments, always a little awkward at the start, thinking too hard about where to put his hands. Percival had no such hesitation. Why would he? He had wonderful hands. He took Credence’s face between them and kissed him, easy and deep; Credence’s eyes closed instinctively, the better to focus on the feeling of skin on skin, lips on lips, a warmth between them that already smelled of sweat and desire.</p><p class="western" align="left">The few feet of floor to the bed was crossed at a lazy, meandering pace. Percival discarded the rest of his clothes at some point while Credence was too occupied by his mouth to notice. Credence was too pliant, he knew, too willing to be impressed – Percival had said as much, once, his tone fond (“what you do for my ego, Credence”) but tinged with a little sadness. Credence didn’t want to be needy, to be pitied. He kissed harder and Percival made a pleased noise. He liked it when Credence made demands of him.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Tell me what you want.”</p><p class="western" align="left">One day Credence would be able to admit to himself that he liked making demands. “Your hands,” he whispered. “Please, give me your hands.”</p><p class="western" align="left">They lay together as the room grew brighter around them, as Percival reduced Credence to a gasping mess one finger at a time and then finished him off with his mouth. Credence’s eyes squeezed shut as he tipped over the edge; when he opened them again, Percival was propped on one elbow, gazing down at him with a private kind of wonder.</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence flushed hotly. “Sorry, I’ll just – I’m not…” Where was he going with that? That he wasn’t used to it, that he wasn’t used to being touched at all? That it was so overwhelming he’d forgotten that orgasms were supposed to be mutual?</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival laughed. “Do you <em>really</em> think,” he said, soft and hot, “that this isn’t good for me?”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence drew in a breath, let it out. “Okay,” he said, running his tongue across his lower lip and moving down the bed. “Then I’ll make it better.” He might not have Percival’s expertise, still figuring out quite what to do with his tongue and his teeth, but Percival voiced no complaints about the learning curve.</p><p class="western" align="left">Afterwards, Credence did manage to sleep again. He woke alone under a clean sheet with a pot of tea sitting on the bedside table, spelled to stay warm. He stared at the teapot a bit too long before sitting up and pouring himself a cup. They liked their tea the same way, sweet and very strong. Credence allowed himself the luxury of waking slowly before finally getting out of bed and going to the basin to wash. He looked in the mirror, expecting to see bed-hair and a helplessly wide smile. What he saw was glass completely covered in his sister’s handwriting.</p><p class="western" align="left">Not the sister who was around to sneak into his room, either. No, this was the other sister, who had sold him out to a meglomaniacal sorcerer, then sold out the meglomaniacal sorcerer to Death, then stolen away under an extremely valuable magical artefact to do who honestly knew what next.</p><p class="western" align="left">Apparently, she was writing letters.</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em> Dear Credence, </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em> The witch tells me that if I burn this letter in this candle, it will show up where you are, which sounds very stupid but the witch has a cat’s head so I’m taking her as an authority on stupid things. I trust you and Modesty are well. If you’re not, I trust that you’re going to do something about it. You won’t be able to write back so don’t waste your time trying – I’m perfectly all right. The people speak English here, which doesn’t make any sense because there is NO ENGLAND, but half of them are illiterate so they’re all willing to pay for the services of a scribe. The witch traded me a magic candle for writing down her spells, for God’s sake. It’s like the Middle Ages without all the churches. I think the people here secretly worship a lion. The weather is terrible, but it’ll do for now. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em> If Percival doesn’t treat you well, I hope Modesty stabs him. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em> Best wishes, </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em> Chastity </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence watched the words fade off the mirror and wondered if it was really true that he couldn’t write back, or if Chastity just wasn’t ready to hear from him yet. He could hardly resent it – he wasn’t sure, even now, if he was ready to hear from her.</p><p class="western" align="left">But now, at least, he knew she was alive. And he knew she wanted him to know it.</p><p class="western" align="left">*</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence liked the barracks. For one thing, he didn’t have to leave Percival’s rooms if he didn’t want to, and some days he didn’t. He just stayed there all day, reading battered old books on the history of sword-making or lying on the floor, watching the spread of sunlight (not his sun – a different sun, the centre of a different solar system) across the ceiling. For another thing, Credence had a ready-made place here. He was Percival’s lover and Modesty’s brother, two lights bright enough that Credence was allowed some space in their shadows.</p><p class="western" align="left">Not enough to escape the eye of Albus Dumbledore, however.</p><p class="western" align="left">“No,” Credence said. Most of his conversations with Dumbledore went like this – Dumbledore would have an idea, and Credence would hate it. What was worse was that Dumbledore always summoned him into court to have the conversations in comfortable chairs beside a cheerful little fire, goblets of something that was spicy and orange offered as refreshment, making Credence feel like he was at a pseudo-medieval parent-teacher conference where Dumbledore was playing the parts of both parent and teacher.</p><p class="western" align="left">“I understand you have reservations, Credence,” Dumbledore said in his most reasonable tone, “but how else are we to discover the extent of your powers?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t care,” Credence said stubbornly. “I’m not reading aloud any more. I told you, no.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Modesty liked Dumbledore, so Credence put up with him, but there was nothing that put his back up more than people arguing with him when he said ‘no’. It was his line. He could draw lines now, and they mattered to him. Percival had caught on quickly that, unless lives were at stake, Credence saying no to anything was the end of the discussion. Even Modesty was beginning to accept the new rule, but Dumbledore saw an untapped well of untold power and kept circling back to the same point. What could Credence do with it, if properly trained? What <em>couldn’t</em> he do?</p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t want to know the extent of my powers,” Credence told him. “I’m not going to use them.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“You say that, Silvertongue,” Seraphina remarked, from the doorway. “But you’ll find it’s difficult not to use power once you have it.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence scrambled to his feet to give a hasty bow. The queen was Percival’s friend, with the kind of history behind them that led to obscure jokes and shared private enmities, and on top of that, well, she was the queen. Credence wanted her to like him and he was pretty sure she didn’t. He couldn’t blame her – her world had crashed into his because Credence had read his little sister a book. Under the circumstances, he would not have liked him either.</p><p class="western" align="left">“The boy who won the last word with Death,” Seraphina said thoughtfully. “Did you know that’s what they’re calling you? You are already a legend, Silvertongue.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence wanted Percival here to press his boot against Credence’s foot and mutter in his ear, “That’s a good thing, Credence, breathe,” or “She enjoys intimidating people, try to look bored instead”. Modesty had come into herself with a streak of brutally blunt honesty that left people stunned in her wake – <em>she</em> would not be intimidated. Credence thought of Chastity, who was cold and hard and very far away, and lifted his chin.</p><p class="western" align="left">“We are all stories, your Majesty,” he said.</p><p class="western" align="left">Seraphina raised her eyebrows. “Are we, now.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I have it on very good authority,” Credence said, because he <em>was</em> the the boy who had won the last word with Death, if only because Death thought his story was an interesting one and wanted to know how it would end. He thought he could feel her watching him sometimes, a chill on the back of his neck. It wasn’t entirely unpleasant. Credence had never been good at being on his own.</p><p class="western" align="left">“So what do you plan on doing with yourself?” Seraphina asked, coming a little further into the room. She took up Credence’s untouched goblet, gave the contents a cursory look and didn’t drink it either. “Are you going to train with your sister and master the sword?”</p><p class="western" align="left">There was enough of an edge in her tone that Credence thought, suddenly, this was not only about what he could do or what he had done. This was about Percival too. She didn’t think Credence was good enough for Percival. And, all right, he agreed with her, Percival was overqualified to be anyone’s boyfriend while Credence would have to scrape the barrel for accomplishments like ‘can cook breakfast if you don’t watch and make me nervous’ or ‘will probably remember to wash your clothes if I borrow them’. But Percival wanted him, and Credence wanted Percival. It was complicated. It was nobody else’s business.</p><p class="western" align="left">“My plan, your Majesty,” Credence said, biting out the words with incautious steel, “is to study the magic of crossing between worlds. I think someone should figure out how it works.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Seraphina and Dumbledore looked at him with identical expressions of incredulous uncertainty, clearly waiting for him to qualify that statement into something more attainable. Credence didn’t know enough about magic to say just how impossible his spur-of-the-moment life goal really was, but that response alone was enough to give him an idea.</p><p class="western" align="left">“How very…ambitious,” Dumbledore said eventually.</p><p class="western" align="left">“It’s good to have ambitions,” Credence said, bowing briskly to queen and sorcerer before making his escape so he could go and have a panic attack in a closet.</p><p class="western" align="left">It really didn’t help when fiery writing appeared in the dark.</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>WHAT IS THE POINT OF BEAVERS. FUCK THOSE LITTLE PLOTTERS AND THEIR TALKING LION AND THEIR THRONE TOO. FUCK THEM ALL.</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">*</p><p class="western" align="left">The next time Chastity wrote to him was two months later. Her words showed up in Percival’s shaving mirror, which led to a round of cursing and a bloody nick just under his jaw. It seemed, Credence thought, trying to read the letter and tend an injury at the same time, a very Chastity thing to do, and she hadn’t even done it deliberately.</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>Dear Credence,</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left"><em>There was a minor revolution, but I didn’t like that world anyway. It was too cold. My new job is speech writer to the local monarch, which means I’ve had to learn to play croquet, because she is obsessed with the game. I hate croquet. She cheats, she keeps threatening to behead people, her palace is literally a house of cards and I haven’t even got into details about the rodents who run the justice system around here. I will </em> not <em> be staying long. Travelling between worlds is easier </em> <em>from this place</em> <em>, all I have to do is decide where I want to go. I’ll let you know when I get there.</em></p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>Best wishes, </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>Chastity</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left"><em>P.S. If you want to eat mushrooms in Macusa, </em> <em>ask about</em> <em> th</em> <em>e side effects first</em> <em>. Or just make </em> <em>someone else</em> <em> eat them </em> <em>and see what happens</em> <em>.</em></p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t like that she can do this,” Percival said. “Or that she’s working for a tyrant. That appears to be a pattern.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence shrugged. He had never been able to explain why Chastity did what she did and saw no reason to start trying now. Percival gave the mirror one last distrustful glare and reached for his sword-belt, then shrugged on the elegant dark coat he wore whenever he was going up the hill into the castle, to take his place at the queen’s right hand.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Percival,” Credence said quietly. “Please don’t tell anyone about this.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival paused. He didn’t answer immediately and Credence didn’t say anything else, waiting. Everything felt like a test to him, every day in this world, springing up out of nowhere at the worst possible time. It would either work out or it wouldn’t. Life on the knife’s edge, sitting here in the bedroom that wasn’t really his.</p><p class="western" align="left">“For now,” Percival said tightly. “If I believe there’s a real risk…”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence drew in a shuddering breath. “I miss her sometimes,” he confessed. “Not often, but sometimes.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Silence fell between them again. Slowly, Percival eased his coat off his shoulders and sat down beside Credence on the bed. Credence did not lean into him – it was a gesture that took effort for him, and right now he didn’t quite have the effort to give. He could feel the warmth and weight of Percival’s presence beside him, though, and thought, <em>I would miss you too. I would miss you more.</em></p><p class="western" align="left">But he really didn’t want it to be a choice.</p><p class="western" align="left">*</p><p class="western" align="left">It was Credence’s second summer in Macusa before he saw Percival’s holiday home for the first time, because yes, he was in a relationship with a man who had a holiday home. What happened – what, Percival informed him, always happened – was that at a certain point Seraphina lost all patience with the rising heat and took off for the cooler climate of the south, and the court trailed in her wake as if they had all stumbled on the same excellent idea at the same time. This was the awkward starting gun of the Macusa social season.</p><p class="western" align="left">This year, rain followed promptly behind them. Not that that had stopped Modesty from going out riding with the other squires, and she had done her best to convince Credence to go too, but he avoided riding on horseback in the mildest of weathers and had chosen to instead spend his morning reading on the rug beside the fire, a decision that involved dry socks and the soothing background scritching of Percival’s pen against paper as he wrote irritated RSVPs to various social events he didn’t want to attend. Once or twice he got up to frown out the window and try out various wordings of refusal on Credence to see which was the least rude.</p><p class="western" align="left">“They all sound a bit rude,” Credence pointed out apologetically.</p><p class="western" align="left">“That is because I don’t want to go,” Percival muttered, returning to his desk to frown at the paper instead. “Seraphina doesn’t have to put up with this nonsense, she has secretaries to write refusals for her. I need a secretary.”</p><p class="western" align="left">If Credence had felt like it, he could have written the letters. Delicate wording came more easily to him. But he didn’t feel like it, and he didn’t want to attend any of these events any more than Percival did, so he remained on the rug with his book and let Percival suffer the process alone. The book was…borrowed…from Dumbledore’s private collection, part of the passive-aggressive intellectual war being quietly waged between them. Dumbledore would never be so crass as to actively interfere with Credence’s studies into inter-world travel, but Credence was sure that it was no coincidence how often the books he wanted most went missing right when he wanted them and other books on subjects as subtle as exploring one’s latent abilities showed up in their place. Modesty had taken Credence’s side – she would sneak into Dumbledore’s rooms and steal his books, and so far she was getting away with it, possibly because Dumbledore did not want to draw attention to what he was doing but more likely because he planned to eventually win Modesty over himself.</p><p class="western" align="left">Dumbledore didn’t know her very well yet. She wasn’t on Credence’s side because he was her brother – she was on his side because no one was allowed to steal books except for her.</p><p class="western" align="left">Honestly, Credence wasn’t sure quite what he was trying to prove with this research. There were stories about travelling between worlds, and some sorcerers even claimed to have done it, but no one had ever been able to replicate what they said they’d done. Credence thought of Ariana’s mirror and the friends on the other side of it. He had no way to reach him, and if they could get to him, they hadn’t done it. Queenie would have, he was pretty sure, if she could have done. Maybe she had changed her mind and gone home to her own world after all. Maybe, if Credence did find a way to get back, there would be no one there for him.</p><p class="western" align="left">He didn’t want to get back, not really, not even for Queenie. But there were things he missed. The smell of coffee and the taste of peanut butter. Headphones. Incidental music drifting out of shops and cafes passing cars, a casual backdrop instead of something you had to seek out and pay attention to. More than anything, Credence missed feeling certain. He had not realised what he thought of as basic realities until they were all taken away. Percival had told him at the start, and a few times since, that he could ask any question he wanted, and for a while Credence had actually tried, though it had gone against his instincts. But all the questions came back to the same point: this was not the world he had grown up in. He would never understand why it was the way it was; every question was rooted in a thousand more.</p><p class="western" align="left">For instance. “The giants are war-mongering on the border again,” Percival remarked, his frown deepening as he opened another envelope. “That is why I’m so inescapably popular this year, I expect. Everyone wants to find out what I’m going to do about it.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Giants,” Credence said.</p><p class="western" align="left">“And it’s not even up to me to do anything,” Percival continued irritably, “which they should know by now. Seraphina has made it clear she wants to maintain peace for as long as possible. The last border war was an ugly mess right at the start of her reign, you know.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Giants,” Credence said again.</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival turned around in his chair. “You did know about the giants, didn’t you? Don’t you have them in your world too? I was talking to Modesty about it and she said ‘oh like Bigfoot’.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence experienced a strange moment where he wanted to laugh but he also wanted to burst into tears and what actually happened was that he lost his temper. It took them both by surprise, because Credence generally gave everyone, including himself, the impression that he did not have a temper to lose. “You talked to Modesty about it,” he began, “but you didn’t talk to me?”</p><p class="western" align="left">And it went spectacularly downhill from there.</p><p class="western" align="left">They didn’t know how to fight each other. They had never fought before, not really; arguments, yes, usually about Modesty when Percival decided her next level of training required lots of sharp objects, but this was different. Credence’s voice rose to a cracked, ugly shout that was thick with unshed tears as words spilled out of him, all of them true, all of them better kept to himself. Resentment about his place in Percival’s life (a kept luxury, an exotic pet, that was what people thought of him), frustration about his place in Percival’s world (he had followed him here, he had never stopped following him, always a step behind), and above all, anger with himself for thinking it would be different. For thinking he could walk away from what he was, the scarecrow boy from a distant, dusty town.</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival stopped answering him at some point, was now simply staring in disbelief. Credence drew in a shuddering gulp of air as the enormity of what he’d said crashed down on him. The ensuing silence was horrific. It was unbearable. Credence bolted like an animal out of a cage, into the rain.</p><p class="western" align="left">There was nowhere to go out here either, of course. It was Percival’s property and if Credence walked for half an hour in either direction he would be on another knight’s property because they were clannish like that and liked to group together even away from the barracks. Credence stood for a moment among the elegant clipped hedges of the formal gardens around the house before diving off down one of the paths. His heart was hammering. He had, with practically no effort at all, ruined everything. Percival had not even done anything wrong. It was Credence who had overreacted, Credence who had…</p><p class="western" align="left">He’d sounded like his mother.</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence didn’t know how long he sat in the rain, watching the river. Even his misery washed away eventually, leaving him chilled and numb. Water pooled in the mud where his footprints had been. Familiar handwriting scrolled in the puddles, rippling with the raindrops so it was almost impossible to read.</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>Dear Credence,</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>I’ve been careless. There isn’t much of this candle left and now I don’t have any choice but to let it burn. I don’t know where I am. It’s dark. I’m selfish. I wrote to you because it made these stupid, beautiful, awful places real to me, not because I cared about you. I don’t care about anyone. Sometimes I don’t even care about me. I think I’m only feeling like this now because it’s – dark, and I can hear something moving out there. I’m glad you and Modesty aren’t here. I hope you’re okay. </em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">
  <em>Stay alive, Credence. Don’t you dare</em>
</p><p class="western" align="left">The words stopped coming. The rain kept falling.</p><p class="western" align="left">“She’s never written about me before,” Modesty said, coming up to stand next to Credence. She was almost as wet as he was and muddy up to the knee. They both stared at the pool of water as their sister’s words broke apart into ripples and disappeared completely. “Is this why you freaked out on Percival and came out here to drown?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“No,” Credence said dully.</p><p class="western" align="left">Modesty was quiet for a while. “Do you think she’s dead?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t know.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Are you going to stay out here in the rain much longer? Is that going to help?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t know,” Credence said again, his voice thick and harsh, but Modesty had no particular respect for misery and precious little pity for it. She rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="western" align="left">“You’re being stupid,” she said. She sounded so much like Chastity that Credence could do nothing but stare at her dumbly. “Why are you angry? Why are you <em>sad</em>? Percival thinks you’re homesick. You can’t be homesick. We didn’t <em>have</em> a home. You hated it there as much as I did!”</p><p class="western" align="left">“What else is there?” Credence shouted, despairing. “I could have left, couldn’t I? I was twenty, she couldn’t have made me stay. I stayed because there was nothing else for me. I don’t know how to make anyone a home! I don’t – it’s different for you. You’re clever and she liked that. I’m not clever, Modesty. I’m not brave. The best I can do is pick up the pieces of someone else’s mess. I’ve been trying so hard and I just, I just can’t do it. Percival needs someone better. You didn’t hear what I said to him.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Then say sorry,” Modesty shouted back. “Make it right!”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Then <em>I’ll do it again.”</em></p><p class="western" align="left">Modesty went quiet, eyes wide. Eventually she said, “Did you hit him?”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence wrapped his arms around himself, uselessly. “Not this time.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“Don’t say it like you’ve hit him before. You haven’t. He could flatten you with one hand if he felt like it, but he doesn’t, he doesn’t want to. You could, I don’t know, read him out of existence. You could leave him.” Modesty was getting furious again. “Why would you hurt him? You’ve never hurt me! You yelled at him. People do that sometimes! It doesn’t mean…just because we grew up in a prison doesn’t mean we’re going to build bars wherever we go! I don’t care why you stayed. You were there when I needed you. Stop pretending you weren’t. Stop pretending you’re a monster when you’re better than anyone I know. Stop it.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence was in tears again. “Okay,” he said. “I’ll stop it. I’ll stop.” Modesty shoved him, hard, and he hugged her until his arms ached and they both stopped crying.</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival was waiting for him when he came home. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking as he looked at them both, the otherworldly siblings he’d decided to take in and keep, who could never be expected to remember all the things they didn’t know. He touched Modesty’s shoulder as she went inside, dripping all over his floor. Credence lingered in the doorway when she was gone.</p><p class="western" align="left">“You should go and take a bath,” Percival said neutrally.</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence looked at him with an ache in his throat. “I don’t care about the giants,” he said.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Well, you should. There’ll be another war sooner or later, the way things are going.” Percival looked back at him for a long considering minute, the careful distance in his expression slowly giving way to some emotion Credence could not decipher. “I did think you knew. I shouldn’t have assumed.”</p><p class="western" align="left">“No,” Credence began, horrified all over again. “You don’t have anything to be sorry about, it was me, I was – ” He groped for a word that would cover his guilt. “Inexcusable. I should have known, I can’t rely on you to tell me everything, that’s not your job.” There was more he needed to say, convincing things about how he wouldn’t do it again, but he wasn’t sure that they would be true.</p><p class="western" align="left">“Is that the first time you’ve ever shouted at someone?” Percival asked quietly.</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence looked away. He had been that angry before, a howling misery that felt like it would burn him up one vital organ at a time, but it had never made the transformation into words.</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival lifted his eyebrows when it became clear that Credence wasn’t going to answer him. “Do you feel like shouting some more now?”</p><p class="western" align="left">“I’m sorry,” Credence said, pressing his hands over his eyes. “I’m sorry.”</p><p class="western" align="left">He felt calloused fingers brush against his face, startlingly warm against the chilled skin. “Take a bath,” Percival said, painfully gentle. “I’m still going to be here when you’re done.”</p><p class="western" align="left">He didn’t say, <em>I’m not going anywhere</em>. He was too honest for that. There were all kinds of places Percival might go, if he felt he had to. It was enough for Credence that he was here tonight – that when he was clean, Credence came to bed and Percival was there, steel-framed glasses propped on the bridge of his nose as he paged through what turned out to be Credence’s unfinished book.</p><p class="western" align="left">“I don’t regret coming here,” Credence said urgently, seeing for the first time the logical conclusion that Percival might have reached. “Not for a minute. I’m not – Percival, this is the happiest I’ve ever been.” He sat down on the edge of the bed, looking at the book in Percival’s hands. “I understand if you don’t want me to stay with you, though. Right now, anyway.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Percival took off his glasses. “I don’t feel like letting you out of my sight,” he said matter-of-factly, putting down the book. “I’m not Queenie, Credence. If you want to know something, you have to <em>ask</em>. But all you have to do is ask.” He leaned forward and kissed Credence, brief and firm. “I’m going to keep saying it until you believe me.”</p><p class="western" align="left">Credence did not have quite enough air. He felt crushed with love. “I believe you.”</p><p class="western" align="left">And it was true. For tonight. Maybe for tomorrow.</p><p class="western" align="left">Maybe always. There was only one way to be sure.</p>
