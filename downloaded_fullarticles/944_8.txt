    <p>Instead of focusing on her notes in preparation for the Charms exam the next day, Hermione found herself studying her left forearm, running her fingers over the letters printed into her skin. Sometimes she wished her tattoo were placed somewhere a little harder to access, like the “I’ve got something to tell you” wrapped around Harry’s right ankle or the “Oi, ginger!” scrawled across Ron’s chest. Unlike Hermione, they didn’t seem too fussed about their tattoos. Then again, Harry had already found his soulmate, and Ron was busy pursuing any girl who happened to glance his way.</p>
<p>To Hermione, her soulmate tattoo was a mystery, a puzzle she couldn’t solve. Who was this person who matched her perfectly? She ran through her mental list of facts that she knew about her soulmate. </p>
<p><em> Alive </em>. The most important detail. The words on her arm were dark, as though newly inked, not like Cho’s tattoo, which had faded to a light gray following the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione couldn’t begin to imagine the pain of losing one’s soulmate so young.</p>
<p><em> Older </em>. People’s soulmate tattoos appeared on their bodies when their soulmates were born, and her parents told her she’d had hers since birth. </p>
<p><em> A woman? </em> The phrase on her arm certainly seemed to imply it. Which left Hermione to ponder the various situations in which a person’s first words to her would be “Girl to girl.”</p>
<p>Sometimes she worried that she was creating too much buildup. What if her soulmate didn’t live up to expectations? She knew she wasn’t always an easy person to put up with. She had a tendency to drone on about certain academic subjects, she loved giving unsolicited advice, and her constant pursuit of perfection didn’t make her any more likable. Even the boys got tired of her at times. Was there really someone who would not just accept her quirks, but also love her for them?</p>
<p>Hermione’s train of thought was interrupted when she found herself suddenly engulfed in darkness. Her candle had burned all the way through, but she didn’t bother lighting a new one. She was done studying for the night. She fumbled her way to her bed in the dark, not wanting to wake her roommates with a <em> Lumos </em> incantation.</p>
<p>She hoped her exhaustion would finally grant her a restful sleep. Ever since what had happened in the Department of Mysteries, she’d been having recurring nightmares of Sirius’s death. </p>
<p>Some people claimed that they dreamed about their soulmates before even meeting them, but all Hermione got were visions of that crazed witch with disheveled dark locks and a gleaming, feral grin. That night was no exception.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em> Two years later... </em>
</p>
<p>Hermione shouldn’t have been surprised that they’d been caught. They hadn’t been careful enough, and then the Snatchers had been on them. She knew her plan to conceal Harry’s identity had been too optimistic, and it had fallen apart within minutes, which is how she found herself on her knees, tied to Harry and Ron, staring up at the Black Manor gates. </p>
<p>She’d never thought this would be how she spent her last moments. Bound to her two best friends as the Malfoys eagerly identified them one by one. Perhaps her belief that good would always prevail over evil had made her too confident. She hadn’t prepared enough, she’d allowed herself to get sloppy. Too late now. She wondered if her soulmate would mourn her upon discovering his or her faded tattoo.</p>
<p>And then Bellatrix Lestrange walked into the room, and Hermione grew sick with fear at the sight of the woman who had so often awoken her in a cold sweat. Bellatrix looked straight at her, eyes bearing into hers, and Hermione could see the insanity in their depths. “But surely this is the Mudblood girl. This is Granger?” she whispered with feverish excitement. </p>
<p>It was almost amusing to watch them bicker over who would call Voldemort. She would be dead soon, so she might as well enjoy the provided entertainment. Then by some stroke of luck, they were being spared at least a little while longer, a window of opportunity to plan and execute an escape. </p>
<p>Hermione could have cried in relief when Narcissa Malfoy ordered Greyback to take them down to the cellar. The feeling was short lived. “Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except… except for the Mudblood.”</p>
<p>Ron began protesting, but Hermione could hardly hear over the blood pounding in her ears. Bellatrix sliced through the ropes joining her to the other prisoners with a flick of her wand, and another flick sent Hermione crashing into the far wall. She cried out in pain and watched in horror as her friends were taken away. What was going to happen to her?</p>
<p>Bellatrix answered her unspoken question, announcing, “I’m going to have a little conversation with this one.” The witch stalked closer, and pressing her against the wall, finished, “Girl to girl.”</p>
<p>Her blood ran cold, and she must have blanched, but Bellatrix didn’t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary, probably used to getting that reaction. She only cackled and dragged the younger witch to the center of the room. </p>
<p>Hermione could barely feel the claw-like nails digging into her scalp, tearing at her hair. All she could think was that there had to be a mistake. Her soulmate, the one she’d longed to meet, couldn’t be Bellatrix, a woman—a monster—so vile and cruel even other Death Eaters feared her. No, it couldn’t be. After all, those words hadn’t been the first she’d heard Bellatrix utter… but were they the first words Bellatrix had spoken directly to her?</p>
<p>The potential soulmate in question was not privy to Hermione’s inner thoughts, and she shoved Hermione to the ground. “How did you get that sword?” Hermione struggled to get up. “Ah ah ah,” Bellatrix wagged her finger. “No moving.” A burst of light shot out from her wand, and Hermione found her legs locked in place. “Now answer my question.”</p>
<p>Hermione knew she had to stay silent, and not just to protect the information. If she said anything, the witch would find out about their bond (if it even existed), which she was sure Bellatrix would exploit in some way. </p>
<p>The witch in front of her sighed impatiently. “Come now, pet. Cooperate while I’m in a good mood, and it’ll be a lot less painful for you. A lot less fun for me though.” She cackled again, and the sound made Hermione’s skin crawl. She remained silent.</p>
<p>Bellatrix shrugged, then her mouth widened in a grin. “Have it your way. <em> Crucio! </em>” she cried, wand pointed at Hermione’s chest. She closed her eyes, bracing for a blast of pain, but it never came. She tentatively opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“<em> Crucio! Crucio! </em>” Bellatrix continued to shout, but Hermione knew it was no use. She almost wished she could feel the excruciating pain the spell was meant to induce. Instead, all she felt was the dread of confirmation and bile rising up her throat. The soulmate bond prevented either one from casting an Unforgivable Curse on the other. </p>
<p>The older witch didn’t seem to make the same connection. “Some sort of charm to protect yourself from my spells? That’s alright, Mudblood, I can hurt you the Muggle way, too.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix jumped on top of her before she could roll out of the way, fingers encircling her throat. Feeling panicked, Hermione threw a few punches, which the other witch deflected with a growl. “You dare lay a hand on me?” Bellatrix pinned both of her arms to the ground with one hand. She was stronger than Hermione expected.</p>
<p>“That’s better.” Her grin had reappeared, and she brushed an escaped lock of hair back behind her ear. Then she paused, her eyes finding the writing on Hermione’s arm. Her mouth warped into a sneer, and her free hand wrapped tighter around Hermione’s neck. “Speak, Mudblood. SPEAK!”</p>
<p>Hermione’s vision swam with black spots, the pain and pressure on her windpipe mounting. She bucked furiously, trying to throw the Death Eater off of her, but it was no use. “Please,” she gasped. “Please, stop.” A single tear leaked out from the corner of her eye. She looked up into her tormentor’s face, expecting a flicker of recognition, a reaction of some kind, but receiving none.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Bellatrix released her neck, and she sucked in a lungful of air, almost choking on it. The older witch waited until she was done coughing and sputtering. “You’re wrong, muddy. Whatever you think there is between us, you’re WRONG!” Hermione startled, and Bellatrix seemed pleased. “I have no soulmate tattoo.”</p>
<p>Hermione paused. She knew some of her peers were missing tattoos. Some would develop them later on in life, but others might never get them. They weren’t common, but the Unmatched did exist. Could Bellatrix be one of them? Maybe her soulmate was someone else after all?</p>
<p>Bellatrix continued on. “Which means I have no qualms about hurting, torturing, or killing you. Now tell me, how did you get the sword?” Hermione just stared blankly up at her. “Being difficult, pet? Then I’ll show you what I think of your silly little tattoo!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a searing agony shot up Hermione’s left arm, and she screamed, tears springing to her eyes. Finally the pain receded, and she looked down to see that Bellatrix had carefully carved something over her tattoo with a dagger. “Let’s take a break, shall we? It’s hard to answer questions when you’re too busy screaming. Now are you ready to talk?”</p>
<p>Hermione gritted her teeth. And the screaming began again. It felt like they had been at it for hours, although common sense suggested that only a few minutes had passed. She wouldn’t last for long. Bellatrix was certainly an expert.</p>
<p>Another break. Words whispered furiously into her ear. “That sword is meant to be in my vault in Gringotts. How did you get it? Did you and your friends TAKE IT FROM MY VAULT?” Sharp nails dug into her skin, drawing blood.</p>
<p>Hermione sobbed out, “I didn’t take anything. <em> Please </em>, I didn’t—”</p>
<p>“LIAR!” Bellatrix screeched.</p>
<p>“The sword is a fake, it’s a copy. I promise!” She couldn’t take the pain anymore.</p>
<p>“Your promises means nothing to me, you filthy Mudblood!” She held the dagger over Hermione’s face threateningly.</p>
<p>Lucius interjected, “Let’s call up the goblin. He’ll be able to confirm or deny her words.” Hermione had forgotten that there were others in the room.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, Bellatrix nodded her assent. She stood up, brushing herself off as though she had sat on something dirty. Hermione was thankful for the brief reprieve. And then Harry and Ron were there, and Dobby. Blasts of light flew around the room as her friends engaged in battle with the Malfoys.</p>
<p>But then clawed hands were pulling her up, and she was too weak to resist. “STOP OR SHE DIES!” Bellatrix bellowed. Hermione felt a sharp blade at her neck, but oddly her focus was on Bellatrix’s body pressed up against her own, hard edges and softness all at once. Silently, she willed her friends to forget her, to get away while they still could. </p>
<p>The sound of unscrewing from above drew everyone’s attention up to the ceiling, and she was pushed away from behind as the huge chandelier dropped down towards them. Then, finally, they were Apparating to safety.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em> Two months later... </em>
</p>
<p>Hermione, Harry, and Ron sat in the Leaky Cauldron, sipping their drinks. Well, Hermione and Harry were sipping. Ron was pounding them down. “Maybe slow down there?” Hermione suggested.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Let him enjoy tonight. It’s not every day we defeat Voldemort. We did it. It’s finally over.”</p>
<p>Hermione had to agree. She sighed. “And at no small cost either.” Her eyes grew sad as she watched Ron, who had lost more than most. “Fine, but you take the blame when he wakes up tomorrow morning feeling like a Hippogriff stomped on his head.”</p>
<p>“You two are talkin’ ‘bout me, aren’t ya?” Ron had finished his fourth mug and now redirected his attention at his friends. “Hey, I’m gonn’ fin’ my soulmate tonigh’.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t want to ruin his fun, but… “Ron, you can’t just find your soulmate because you decide you want to. It doesn’t work that way.”</p>
<p>“Oi, are you,” he stabbed his finger in Hermione’s direction, “saying you don’t b’lieve ‘n me? Cuz watch, I’ll pwoove you wong.”</p>
<p>Harry was amused by his friend’s drunken state. “What’s your plan?”</p>
<p>“See tha’ girl?” He motioned toward a pretty blonde a few tables away. “I’m gonn’ bump into her, get her to say ‘Oi, ginjah’ an’ BAM soulmates!”</p>
<p>“Best of luck, bud,” Harry patted Ron on the shoulder. Ron gave him a salute before turning towards his target. With all his stumbling, he really didn’t have to fake knocking into the poor witch. </p>
<p>“Watch where you’re going!” she exclaimed, and Ron threw up his hands in apology, shoulders sagging with defeat. He turned back towards his friends who were both smirking at him.</p>
<p>“OI, GINGER!” Ron jumped, instantly sobering up. A buff, blonde man marched up to him. “That’s my girlfriend.”</p>
<p>Ron’s jaw dropped. “No fucking way.” The other man raised his eyebrows. Harry and Hermione watched the events unfold, giggling at their friend’s shocked expression. </p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Who knew our little womanizer was barking up the wrong tree the whole time?”</p>
<p>“What are you two laughing so hard about?” Ginny had joined them, and Harry pulled her down into his lap.</p>
<p>Hermione replied, smiling, “I think you can expect to get a new brother-in-law soon.” At Ginny’s questioning look, she nodded towards Ron and his newfound soulmate, who were now making out on top of a table. The blonde witch was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Ginny rolled her eyes at the public display. “Oh, Ron. At least he’s found his One, and I won’t have to deal with meeting all his snooty, annoying girlfriends anymore. Speaking of, when are you going to meet yours?”</p>
<p>Hermione stiffened, looking down at the mess of scars crisscrossing over her tattoo. The wound hadn’t had enough time to heal, the letters a dark, garish red. They would never fade away completely. <em> Mudblood </em>. Her one lasting reminder of Bellatrix Lestrange... Except that underneath, her tattoo was still fresh and dark, and she had seen Bellatrix fall at the hand of Mrs. Weasley. </p>
<p>“Hermione, you okay?”</p>
<p>She gave the redhead what she hoped was a reassuring smile. “Yeah, just a lot on my mind.”</p>
<p>Ginny looked like she wanted to say more, but then Harry pulled her in for a kiss, leaving Hermione to her own thoughts. So her soulmate wasn’t a Death Eater after all. Hermione should feel relieved, but instead she felt unsettled. After the incident at Black Manor, Hermione had been convinced that Bellatrix was indeed her soulmate. What else could explain her immunity to the evil witch’s curses? While Bellatrix had claimed to be Unmatched, Hermione definitely wouldn’t put it past her to lie.</p>
<p>Try as she might, she couldn’t silence that tiny voice in the back of her head insisting, <em> She’s alive. She’s still alive. </em> There was only one way to settle the matter. She had to check the battlefield and… Hermione finished the rest of her drink and drained Harry’s cup for good measure. He was too busy feeling up Ginny anyway. She had a body to find. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The protective wards of the school had been damaged in the fighting, allowing Hermione to Apparate in directly. It was eerily silent in the Great Hall. She hadn’t thought she’d be back in Hogwarts so soon. Sure, she’d always planned to finish her education, but by the start of her seventh year, the school would have been repaired, all signs of the gruesome final battle wiped away. </p>
<p>The ground was covered in debris, dust still filled the air, and when Hermione looked up, she could see the moon—the real one, not the enchantment that usually transformed the ceiling into the night sky. She sent a spell into any braziers that remained hanging, and the hall lit up, revealing what she hadn’t been able to see in the dark. Buried under the rubble, bodies that no one had come to claim. They were mostly Death Eaters, but there were others too. She glimpsed the large glassy eyes of a house-elf in the distance, recognized the yellow and black pattern of a Hufflepuff scarf peeking out from underneath a stone slab. </p>
<p>She bit down on her hand to hold in a sob. It was all hitting her now. Why was she here? She should be in Australia, tracking down her parents and restoring their memories. It was over, and she should be holding her loved ones close instead of trying to find the corpse of her torturer. </p>
<p>She turned to leave, but then she saw the body. It had been spared from any falling ceiling parts, almost perfectly preserving how the witch had fallen. Hermione stepped closer. Bellatrix’s face was relaxed, and she seemed at peace. It made Hermione uncomfortable that the older witch’s loveliness was apparent in death, wiped free of the insanity and cruelty she had worn as a mask in life.</p>
<p>Of course no one had taken Bellatrix’s body away. Those who had fought by her side had either suffered a similar fate or gone into hiding. In all honesty, it was unlikely that anyone on Bellatrix’s side would have cared enough to give her a proper burial anyway. Hermione was about to Apparate back to the Leaky Cauldron, but then she looked down. She had to make sure, or else doubt would find its way back into her mind eventually. She knelt, hand reaching for a pale, delicate throat. Her fingers slid up, searching for a pulse she wasn’t expecting to find.</p>
<p>A hand enclosed around her wrist and she yelped. Eyes darting to the once peaceful face, Hermione found murderous dark eyes staring back at her. Red lips were now stretched into wicked grin. She retracted her arm and scrambled away from the Death Eater. </p>
<p>Stumbling to her feet, she pointed her wand at Bellatrix. “Don’t - Don’t move a muscle! Y-you’re supposed to be dead! <em> Accio </em>!” A wand lying just out of Bellatrix’s reach zoomed into Hermione’s open palm.</p>
<p>“Supposed to be dead? Clearly I’m not.” Bellatrix cackled before her face contorted into a wince, and her hand clutched at her chest.</p>
<p>“Don’t move, I said!” Hermione sent a threatening blast of light whizzing past Bellatrix’s face.</p>
<p>“Easy, pet! Wouldn’t want to hurt your <em> soulmate </em>, now would you?” She licked her lips, looking pleased with herself.</p>
<p>“You said you were Unmatched.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix rolled her eyes. “I lied. Don’t tell me you’re surprised.”</p>
<p>“Then show me your tattoo. Actually, no, tell me where your tattoo is.”</p>
<p>“You don’t trust me?” Her accompanying pout looked oddly childish.</p>
<p>“Not as far as I can throw you,” scoffed Hermione.</p>
<p>Bellatrix sighed. “Under my right ribcage.”</p>
<p>“<em> Immobulus! </em> ” cast Hermione before she approached cautiously, almost smiling at the glare the other witch was giving her. With her wand, she sliced away a piece of the trademark black corset, finding the word she was looking for. <em> Please </em> , in tiny letters. She also found blood, lots of it, oozing from a wound that must have been located in the center of Bellatrix’s chest. Mrs. Weasley hadn’t missed her mark, so how had Bellatrix survived the <em> Avada Kedavra </em> curse?</p>
<p>Hermione magicked Bellatrix’s corset back into one piece and moved a few steps away before reversing the freezing spell. </p>
<p>Able to move her jaw again, Bellatrix raged, “You dare cast a spell against me? You’re a Mudblood and I am the Dark Lord’s most loyal servant—”</p>
<p>“He’s dead.” That shut her up. Hermione continued, “And soon you will be, too.”</p>
<p>Bellatrix sneered. “You’re going to kill me?”</p>
<p>“No, but that nasty hole in your chest will do it. A few hours without treatment, and you’ll be dead like you’re supposed to be.” Hermione was proud of how steady her voice sounded.</p>
<p>“I - You - I’m your soulmate!” Bellatrix spluttered. “You’re just going to leave me to die?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s gaze was cold. “I don’t need a soulmate like you.” She turned around, preparing to Apparate away.</p>
<p>“I’m your perfect match!” Bellatrix said, her voice tinged with desperation. </p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more different!”</p>
<p>“We’re not <em> that </em> different.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted disbelievingly.</p>
<p>“Did you know I was the brightest witch of my age? We were both shaped by circumstance. You found Potter, and I found the Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that’s your excuse!” Hermione whirled around in anger.</p>
<p>“It’s not an excuse. It’s what happened.” Bellatrix paused, her eyes finding Hermione’s. “You must have longed to meet me, thinking about me, wondering about me, before you knew me.” </p>
<p>Hermione was silent at the painful truth in those words. </p>
<p>“Now you’re not even going to give me a chance?”</p>
<p>Hermione fumed, “What kind of a chance do you deserve? After everyone you’ve killed, maimed, tortured!” She jabbed a finger at her own chest. “You found out we were soulmates, and you - you carved <em> Mudblood </em> into my arm! Or have you forgotten?”</p>
<p>Bellatrix was calm in the face of her wrath. “No, I haven’t. I remember all of them. They’re all up here.” She tapped her temple. “Will it make you feel better if I say I feel guilty? It doesn’t change the past.” At Hermione’s silence, she continued, “Now pet, we can keep arguing, but the reality is, I’m dying. If you’re going to save my life, better decide quick.”</p>
<p>It was the sanest Hermione had ever heard Bellatrix sound. Thoughts rushed around her head as she struggled to come to a decision. It should have been obvious. Bellatrix was pure evil, and a few halfway remorseful words didn’t change that. There was no question that she deserved to die. But then, could Hermione really walk away with a clean conscience? She gritted her teeth before whispering, “<em> Somnium </em>.” </p>
<p>Bellatrix’s head flopped backwards, and Hermione strode forward, grabbing her arm. “You’re really going through with this, aren’t you,” she muttered, shaking her head at herself before Apparating them to the only safe place she could think of. Home.</p>
