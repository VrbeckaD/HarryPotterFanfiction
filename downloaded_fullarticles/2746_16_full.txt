    <p>Chapter One</p><p> </p><p>“Can I get you another round, Sir?” the waiter asked the disheveled looking man who had just finished his fourth Mai Tai. The man had been lazing around the lido deck all morning, speaking to no one and seemingly enjoying his solo holiday. The waiter hadn’t realized just how strong those Mai Tais had been as the young man didn’t seem to even realize he was there.</p><p>“Sir?”, he asked again.</p><p>“Sorry, what?” Harry snipped.</p><p>“Would you like another round?” the waiter answered, putting on his best Customer Service Smile.</p><p>“Oh, sorry mate. Uh, no, I’m fine, thanks.” Harry said, turning back to the parchment in his hand.</p><p>Harry had been enjoying a well deserved week off at the Lux Cerul Resort and Spa in the Maldives, courtesy of their Ministry for Magic, when an owl had perched itself on Harry’s beach chair. That had been when Harry knew this holiday wouldn’t last long.</p><p>The only place left in the wizarding world that still used owls was the British Ministry for Magic. Literally everywhere else in the world-even the Russians!-had implemented the use of Phloons, or Personal Floo Networks, allowing witches and wizards to Floo one another through conjured floo fire, right at the tip of one’s wand. Not only was it less time consuming but also much neater, Harry thought as the Owl began to hop around on his unfinished breakfast plate. Once he was able to subdue the creature with a bit of leftover bacon and pineapple, he untied the piece of parchment from the bird’s leg. The first thing he noticed was the deep red wax seal, reflecting a simple yet stern “MfM”. That was the final stone on this holiday’s grave; if Kingsley was owling him using the official Minister for Magic seal, it was urgent. And serious.</p><p>“For fuck’s sake”, Harry mumbled.</p><p>Harry hadn’t set foot on British soil in what felt like a lifetime.</p><p>The war had ended, finally. And after his three day nap and a hearty meal at the Burrow, Harry knew in his bones he had to leave. He knew he couldn’t handle the inevitable deification of the Boy Who Lived anymore than he could stand to stay in Grimmauld Place without Sirius. The Weasley’s were about to enter a muddy and engorging grief that Harry knew too well and couldn’t stand to witness his surrogate family trudging through. He had said goodbye to Molly and Arthur with promises to write and keep himself fed, he had hugged Hermione for so long it seemed to last days and the clutching embrace from Ron brought him to tears. They had been a triumvirate for almost a decade, and now it would be the couple and the solitary seeker. But they had all understood, these people had watched the rise and fall of Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, The Boy Who Lied, The Chosen One, The Triumphant One. They knew just as well as he did that Harry, just Harry, could never truly live a life free from his past in England. Their love for him and desire for him to be and remain Harry outweighed their desire to keep him close.</p><p>Saying goodbye to Ginny had been the most...uncomfortable, to say the least. She was furious that he was leaving so soon after the war, so soon after Fred and Lupin and Tonks. So soon after they had finally been given a real chance at their young love.</p><p>“What will Teddy think, Harry! You can’t be another person to just up and leave him!”, Ginny ejected through gritted teeth, “What about us, Harry? The first sign of normalcy, the first sign that we could have a normal life and you decide to leave?”</p><p>“It will just be months and months, even years of ‘The Chosen One wipes his nose! The Chosen One takes a piss!’. I’ve done my duty as ‘The Chosen One’ for god’s sake” Harry barked, unable to contain the fear that came with never ridding himself of the life the prophecy had created for him.</p><p>In that moment, the life he has imagined, the idea of a future that had gotten him through those dark and cold days in the Forest of Dean, felt like a death sentence more damning than the Prophecy because he would have chosen it for himself. The house, the children, the job in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, all would be coated in the thick film of expectation and nostalgia. It would be a life rooted in his past, a past he wanted to leave firmly at his back. Ginny was less understanding than the rest of the Weasley family, and though Harry corresponded with the lot on a weekly basis, even Percy on occasion, he and Ginny hadn’t spoken since.</p><p>What Harry hadn’t told Ginny, or any of the Weasley’s (though Hermione guessed, of course) was that he was also wholly and uniquivacably bent. How was he to explain that to the family that was so sure to add him on as a son-in-law? Of course they would love Harry regardless, being gay wasn’t the issue-it was leaving Ginny and their future behind for good that would so thoroughly gut them, and he just couldn’t do that to them.</p><p>So Harry grabbed his rucksack, extended at the expert hand of Hermione, and stormed out of the Burrow, taking the first International Portkey on offer.</p><p>That had been 15 years ago.</p><p>Having decided he couldn’t possibly read this letter without a stiff drink, even though it was 9 in the morning, he called over a waiter and ordered what would be his first in a long string of Mai Tai's. The soft break of the ocean swallowed by the warm and citrusy breeze had been a tonic Harry hadn’t known he needed until he arrived at the resort three days ago, but now it was simply mocking him as he re-read the worn parchment for the upteenth time.</p><p>Harry-<br/>As the Minister for Magic, I am requesting your presence in my office as soon as possible. It is a matter of the utmost importance. There will be a portkey waiting at the front desk of the Lux Cerul leaving at 3pm this afternoon.</p><p>KS</p><p>It was worse than he could have possibly imagined. After his first bracing Mai Tai, he slipped his thumb under the wax seal, shoulders tense and jaw set, anticipating all sorts of horrid phrases that awaited him on the parchment. “We are having a war memorial and would like you to speak” or “We would like to dedicate a monument in your honour, would you do us the great service of sitting for a casting to be done in pure gold?”. Voldemort’s return had even crossed his mind. But the fact the Kingsley had written to him “As the Minister for Magic”, not as a leader in the Order of Phoenix or as one of Harry’s surrogate parents, and with so little detail included, had only meant one thing-Minister Shacklebot was requesting Harry’s professional services.</p><p>Harry had received many Phloon calls with a similar inclination as this letter, Ministers or Presidents of various Magical governments requesting that Harry appear in their offices as soon as possible, as a matter of grave national and sometimes international importance. Some of these men and women were being paranoid or dramatic in the face of the unknown, some were being paranoid and dramatic for good reason. But it had never phased Harry before. He was well trained and well practiced in his craft, there was no case too dangerous or too convoluted. He was the best in his field, a field he had chosen because there hadn’t been the need for services in England like his for nearly a century. It seemed as though that run was over.</p><p>Harry left a generous tip underneath his, what was it? fourth? fifth? Drink and began walking back to his room to find a strong hangover potion and pack up his rucksack, the same one he’s had since he last left the Burrow.</p><p>The hotel room door gave way to his push, Harry stumbling directly towards his potions bag in the bathroom.</p><p>“Why are there so many blasting bottles” Harry slurred, looking for the light yellow hangover potion he knew had to be in there. “Don’t portkey while punched!” he repeated over and over in his head, giggling all the while. Harry unstoppered the bottle, pressing the cool vial to his lips and tipping it back. While hangover potions were Merlin’s gift to earth, the way they literally burned the alcohol out of one’s blood was wholly unpleasant.</p><p>Sober and alert, Harry got to packing.</p><p> </p><p>In less than five minutes, he was ready to go. He had picked up his potions bag from the beautiful grey marble bathroom being sure to snag the travel sized luxury potions the hotel provided, accio’d his salty swimming costumes from the balcony overlooking the cerulean water, took a quick shower and was ready to go. Harry loved that his whole life could be packed up into a small rucksack in just a few minutes. Of course, when he was using the tent it usually took a bit longer, but he had gotten it down to less than 10 minutes-his goal was eventually 7. His life was simple and it was completely his.</p><p> </p><p>~*~*~</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy walked through the sterile Ministry corridor towards his office at exactly 7am. Just as he had the morning before and as he had the morning before that and every morning for the past two years. With each step closer to the imposing door with the gold embossed plate reading</p><p>D.L. Malfoy<br/>Director<br/>Council for the Preservation of the International Statute of Secrecy, British Division</p><p>, Draco stood a little straighter.</p><p>It had been nothing short of a miracle that such a name plate existed. He and his mother had been pardoned during the post-War trials, due in no short order to a rousing letter from Harry Potter as well as testimony from Granger and the Weasel in support of the Golden Boy’s statement. While he was of course grateful to the man, and he has put so much in his letter to him after the trials had finished, he was also deeply horrified that his fate had once again come down to Harry sodding Potter. He never understood why Harry had written that letter for himself or for his mother, but that was in the past. It hadn’t defined his future. Or, well, that’s what he told himself.</p><p>Potter’s letter had been pithy; “When given the chance, right under the nose of Voldemort himself, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy had made choices that directly defied Voldemort and had in fact directly aided me. While they may not be my favorite people, I would undoubtedly have died before killing Voldemort. Both Narcissa and Draco Malfoy made the decision to alter my fate once, the fate of the wizarding world in fact, and it is for that reason that I implore, no demand, they be pardoned of all crimes.”</p><p>Draco was unsure of exactly what he had done, and even more unsure of what his mother had done, to invoke such a plea from Potter, but he took the second chance with both hands, wringing a life and a future out of his bloodied past.</p><p>After the trials, he and his mother apparated back to Malfoy Manor, intent on acheiving some sort of normalcy once more. Feeling the weeks of holding cell grime seeping into their skin deeper and deeper with each passing moment, they retired to their separate wings for the evening, asking the house elves that were left to bring them dinner to their quarters. As Draco walked back to his childhood room, through the stone cold passageways that had seen so much violence, he was smacked in the face with remnants of the Dark Lords headquarters. He has assumed the house elves would have cleaned up all of this...carnage.</p><p>“Where had all of the blood come from?” Draco couldn’t help whispering.</p><p>The further he walked into the Manor, the more he saw. How had he missed this in the months and months that the Dark Lord had been inhabiting the Manor? How could he miss the dead bodies of mouthy snatchers slumped against the wall? How could he miss the tortured and mangled bodies of muggles that had fallen victim to one of Dolohov’s drunken tirades? How could he have missed the blood that coated the floors and the drapes and the paintings?</p><p>Feeling cold sweat dripping from his temple, his mouth dry as sawdust, he turns around and sprints back to the foyer. There he saw his Mother, holding the only portrait that existed of Lucius, Draco, and herself. It had been an anniversary present from Lucius to Narcissa when Draco was a young boy. It was sticky with drying blood and had deep gashes through the middle, surely the work of Fenrir.</p><p>“This is not the home your father and I built” was all Narcissa said to her son, and with those words they walked back through the Manor doors towards the gate. With a click of her fingers she summoned Snill and Frany, the two remaining house elves in the manor, and with a light flick of her wand and a breathless “Incendio”, Narcissa Malfoy burned the last vestiges of Voldemort’s hold over her and her son’s life to the ground.</p><p>That had been 15 years ago.</p><p>Draco opened the heavy mahogany door to his office, casting a silent Lumos towards to schonces on the wall, an Incendio towards his fireplace and an Initium towards the kettle in the small kitchen that sat behind strong glamours in the corner of his cavernous office. He knew his secretary could bring him tea whenever he asked for it, but there was something bracing about brewing his own cup that made the hassle of constructing and hiding the cozy corner in his otherwise intimidating office quite worthwhile.</p><p>While hanging his coat and stowing his briefcase, Draco noticed a small letter sitting in the middle of his massive desk. He was fastidious about leaving his work space completely devoid of clutter at the end of each day, sometimes staying past midnight to ensure his inbox was empty so that each morning he could face a new day and the new problems it would bring. What’s more, Draco never received correspondence in his office that didn’t come directly from the hand of Lena, his eccentric secretary that he could not possibly function without. Even his personal correspondence was handed to him by the old bat which rarely ended well for Draco.</p><p>“I see Ms. Parkinson has sent another dirgeful missive”, Lena would croon.</p><p>“Are you reading my mail again?! It was one time she sent me a shrieking Howlr! One time! Pansy AND I already apologized for the burn mark!” Draco lamented, snatching the letter from Lena’s stodgy hand.</p><p>Leaving his briefcase and coat forgotten on the floor, Draco inched towards his desk, tenting the graceful fingers of one hand on his leather plotter and tracing the index finger of the other over the burgundy wax seal.</p><p>“What in Merlin’s name does the Minister for Magic want with me?” Draco thought to himself, puzzled beyond words.</p><p>Yes he was a high ranking Ministry official in his own right, but protocol dictated he deal with the Under Secretary for International Magical Cooperation to ensure no political business got in the way of his charge. This could mean one of two things: either Draco was in deep, deep trouble or he was being promoted. There was no in between.</p><p>Director Malfoy-<br/>I request your presence in my office at precisely 8pm this evening. Carrying this letter will grant you access to the 9th floor.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>KS</p><p>Several minutes later, after Draco had memorized the short missive, he tucked the parchment into the breast pocket of his suit jacket and walked over to the kettle. He allowed himself to seep into the routine of his morning cup of earl grey. He shovelled three heaping scoops of earl grey into the teapot, swiping his favorite bone china cup and saucer from the bottom shelf. While his tea steeped, he placed one sugar cube and a splash of milk into the cup, watching the sugar dissolve in the small pool. After exactly five minutes, he poured the fragrant liquid over the sieve, removing it to the saucer, stirring once, twice, thrice with a fine silver spoon, and finally taking his first sip.</p><p>“The British have done little right, but May God Save the Queen for a good cuppa” Draco said to his empty office. He knew this would not be his last cup of the day. Nearly 13 hours lay between him and his appointment. 13 hours during which his mind would wander to the absolute darkest corners of his imagination. Could the Dark Lord be rising again? Surely not, why would Kingsley get him involved? Had there been an allegation against him or his mother? Mother hadn’t stepped foot in England in years and he had been a model wizarding citizen and Ministry employee. But there were still those who only saw his mark and his father’s surname. There was always the possibility Draco was being promoted, he had risen quickly through the office of the Council, arriving earlier and staying later than every peer, turning on the Malfoy charm for all the right people. He was most popular among the Continental Ministries and downright adored in the Americas (of course), getting whatever the Under Secretary had asked of him.</p><p>Draco was lost in thought as Lena poked his upper arm once again.</p><p>“Director Malfoy please tell me you are not drunk at 8am!” Lena spat at her boss.</p><p>“What? Why would you think that? What kind of morning greeting is that anyway?”</p><p>“Sir, you’ve been staring at your tea cup for 10 minutes, surely something is wrong and we both know I always assume the worst of you” she said, peering over the top of her delicate eye glasses.</p><p>“If you must know, I have an appointment later this evening with the Minister,” his words barely audible.</p><p>Lena stared at Draco with a pregnant pause, simultaneously concerned for her job security and the sanity of the young man sitting in front of her.</p><p>“Right,” she directed, “I shall keep correspondence and interruptions to a minimum. You brush up on your case work and recent accomplishments, scant though they are. I refuse to allow you to jeopardize both our futures due to lack of preparedness.” Lena glided to the door, huffed on the gleaming gold name plate and shined it with the cuff of her sleeve, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>“That woman will be the death of me and my ego,” Draco mused. And with that, he opened up his case files and began to do as the old bat had instructed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Out of sheer habit, Harry landed from the portly in a crouch, assessing his surroundings before making any sudden moves. He saw gleaming black floors and appeared to be in a cylinder of the same material.</p><p>“I should have expected that,” Harry thought to himself, realizing he was in an International Arrivals bay in the British Ministry’s portray terminal. He spelled the marble in front of him transparent, taking note of the other occupants of the terminal. Thankfully, due to the late hour, there was one terminal attended witch who was deeply engrossed in the latest issue of Witch Weekly and a lone, aging wizard about to step into a departure bay. Once the old man had disappeared, Harry took his hair out of the bun at the nape of his neck, letting it hang in front of his face to cover his scar. His scar was really the only part of his body, save his eyes, that would identify him as The Boy Who Lived. He had grown another few inches since the Battle, had grown out his hair that he kept tied back, and had spent his first really paycheck getting a Muggle procedure that would eliminate his need for eye glasses. His work also required him to be in top physical condition, a state that he could never claim in his adolescents. And by the amount of witches and wizards who regularly hit on him, he was really quite fit.</p><p>He stalked past the desk of the terminal information desk where the witch didn’t even flinch as he walked past. Adjusting his rucksack higher on his back, Harry began searching for the elevators that would take him to the Minister’s office. He thanked every star in the sky that Kingsley had asked him to come so late in the evening, meaning most employees would be gone by now and the ones who were left wouldn’t care about a lone stranger walking the halls. “Probably an undercover auror or a hit wizard”, they would think to themselves, trying to avoid eye contact.</p><p>After five minutes of walking, Harry found the golden gates of the elevators, stepped onto the marroon carpet and was instantly transported to that day in the Ministry so many years ago. He could smell Ron’s damp clothes and taste the adrenalin on his tongue. His body instantly responded; he separated his feet more, firmly rooting himself into the floor in case he needed to cast quickly. His abdominals tightened, ready to move at a moments notice. His shoulders hunched, his jaw set, his hearing sharpened.</p><p>Harry jumped at the ding that came from the elevator button panel-“Where to, sir?” the buttons asked in unison. This much he remembered, even after all of these years, “Floor Nine, Minister’s office, please,” he panted out.</p><p>Licking his lips and consciously lowering his shoulders, Harry braced himself for whatever was awaiting him in the Minister’s office. He cast a quick tempus, it glowed “20:12” just above his wand.</p><p>Draco had left his office at exactly 7:55pm, knowing it would take him 1 minute to walk to the bank of lifts and, based on his experience traveling around the Ministry, it would take him approximately 2 minutes to arrive at the 9th floor, leaving him 1 minute and thirty seconds to find the Minister’s outer office to which he had asked Lena for directions and another 30 seconds for the Minster’s secretary to alert him to his arrival. The note from Minister Shacklebot say neatly in his breast pocket, allowing him access to the lifts, he hadn’t even needed to speak after the golden grates closed.</p><p>“Floor Nine, Minster for Magic” the buttons crooned, and Draco stepped out of the lift onto the plush red carpet, turning right and then immediately left, just as Lena had instructed. “Then you take another left at the portrait of Minister Percival, he will be the one in the Hippopotamus leather…cloak? garmet? I’m not sure what one would call it but you’ll very clearly see the head of the poor animal” Lena had instructed when explaining Draco’s impending journey through floor 9. “After that, its about 20 paces to a lovely young woman named Hannah Abbott, Minister Shacklebot’s personal secretary, which of course is different than the Secretary to the Minister who is much more organized but constantly smells of moth balls.”</p><p>Draco arrived at Hannah’s desk. He and Abbott had seen each other occasionally at Ministry functions, always exchanging a polite hello but never more than that. After 8th year at Hogwarts, all of the students who had returned decided it would be best to overcome their differences seeing as they would be sharing a dormitory. The little kumbay circle had been lead by Granger, of course, and at first Draco had pasted his best Malfoy Malaise on his face to get through it. But after the literal hours of tearful confessions of loss and of fear, Draco opened himself up to the realization that he had been really fucking wrong. It took a few more sessions before he as able to talk, and once he did, he talked for almost an hour. About how afraid he was of Voldemort, about the torture he was subjected to, about the torture he had to witness, of his mother and father, of Pansy. He talked about what the Death Eaters would do to muggles and muggle borns in front of him, how they would taunt him with whisper’s of “You’re next if you aren’t good”. The other students hadn’t realized what it was like inside the Manor for all of those months. Neville even admitted to assuming they were skipping around a bonfire of Muggles every day, drinking and laughing at the pain they were causing. And that was true, but not for everyone, especially not for Draco. After the last scheduled session, Draco apologized to Hermione and Neville, and then to Luna.</p><p>After that, there was a calm and comforting mutual respect amongst the survivors of the war.</p><p>“Oh hello, Draco, Minister Shacklebot is expecting you, you can go on in”, Hannah said, her quill poised above a hand filled piece of parchment. “Thank you, Hannah”, Draco responded with a deep nod of his head.</p><p>Draco stepped past the left side of Hannah’s desk towards the large, forrest green door that he assumed was the Minister’s office. The door hummed with the magical wards that policed those who could enter, making it sound proof and blast proof. There was also a peculiar magical eye sitting above the name plate, Draco felt as though it’s gaze was piercing his skin.</p><p>“Not that door, Draco, the one to the right”, Hannah instructed without looking up from her work. The door to the right was just a door. A nice door, it matched the rich wood paneling of the walls, but it was just a door, It could have lead to a broom closet for all of the splendor it held, but it was as heavily warded as the other.</p><p>Draco placed his hand on the door knob and the light blue wards wrapped around his hand like a vine, up his forearm and shoulder, only stopping at his chest and wrapping around the letter his his pocket. Once the strands fully encased the letter, they pulsed once and disappeared. The door opened with a soft click.</p><p>“Good Evening, Minister”, Draco said firmly.</p><p>The Minister turned around from his bar cart, “Good Evening, Director Malfoy, how are you this evening?”</p><p>“Quite well, thank you sir”.</p><p>“Would you care for a drink? I just received a bottle of Hocklenor Whiskey from the Irish Minister for Magic. I think this might be just the right occasion to try it out.”</p><p>Hocklenor Whiskey was the most expensive whiskey in the wizarding world, aged in wood barrels made from the oldest sentient tree in Europe and tended to by the fairies that lived within. It took 100 years to make a batch and wasn’t even sold in stores. Draco had heard about this whiskey from some of his father’s friends before the war and had always felt ownership of a bottle would mark a success in his life. Even tasting it would be a day to celebrate.</p><p>“No, thank you, Minister, “ Draco said, trying to hide the deep regret in his voice.</p><p>“Draco, you’re going to have a drink with me. Unless of course you’re a recovering alcoholic or something?” the minister said with a playful sternness.</p><p>Following suit Draco replied, “You know, you’re the second person today to question my relationship with alcohol” He reached out and took the tumbler from the Ministers hand with a grateful nod.</p><p>“Lena keeping you on your toes then?” the Minister chuckled.</p><p>“How did you…?” How did the Minister of Magic know the name of his secretary?!</p><p>“Oh, Lena and I were in school together, we see each other a few times a year at Hogwarts and Order functions of course. She has quite a lot to say about you, young man!”</p><p>“Of course, Sir, I’m sure” Draco said with a smirk.</p><p>“Please, take a seat, Draco. We are waiting for one more before I can explain why I have asked you here tonight.” The Minister pointed to the plush arm chairs and love seat in front of the roaring fire. Draco took a moment to survey the room, what must have been the Minister’s private study. It was cozy, much like the common room the 8th years had shared at Hogwarts. Persian carpets of reds and yellows adorned the floors, rich hangings of burgundy covered in lions and woodland creatures decorated the walls. The Minister’s desk was delicate yet sturdy, and covered in large tomes and small notebooks. This was obviously the place the Minister came to think, and apparently the place to hold late night meetings with reformed death eaters and mysterious guests.</p><p>Draco took a seat on the far armchair, facing the door and his back to the wall. Orienting oneself to a position of protection was a habit that had not died with Voldemort.</p><p>“Minister” Draco began, but before he could finish, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>“Come in,” the Minister said, raising is eyebrows towards his hairline and allowing twist to appear on his lips. Draco saw the magical thread of the wards pulse from the door just as it had done for him and heard the door click open.</p><p>In walked one of the fittest men Draco had ever laid eyes on. He was just the right amount of tall, perfectly toned and strong but not in a boarish way. He stood with a weary self assurance, like he could take on the dangers of the world without a second thought. The man wore work boots, like the ones Draco saw muggle builders wear, dark and weathered denims, and a fitted navy blue jumper that had seen better days. A tan rucksack over his shoulder, the man was a casual, but imposing figure. After Draco’s indulgent meander over the man’s body, his eyes finally reached the man’s face. And his eyes. And his forehead.</p><p>Of course. Of course it was Harry Potter.</p><p>“Harry, Draco, I’m sure you remember one another,” the Minister said with mirth, subtly imploring the two men to not get into a fist fight in his study.</p><p>The two men stared at one another for longer than was comfortable, examining what 15 years would do to one’s least favorite classmate.</p><p>Draco examined the man again, now with the knowledge that it was Harry Potter. He was still one of the fittest men Draco had ever seen, whatever Potter was up to these days obviously agreed with him. But the rugged and casual nature of the man’s appearance seemed out of place on the Boy Who Lived, as if he had stripped himself of everything that made people say his name in capital letters. His face had aged, of course, but he still had those boyish good looks that made him so popular with the girls of Hogwarts. His skin was deeply tanned, there were laugh lines around his mouth that could be seen just underneath the light stubble on his face, small freckles underneath his lower eye lashes. His green eyes were as bright as ever, standing in stark contrast to his skin. Without his glasses, Harry looked more mature. He wore his hair long, tied back in a bun at the nape of his neck. “So he’s hip, now is he?” Draco thought to himself, watching Harry’s eyes grow wider and wider with the recognition of the blond man who was standing opposite him.</p><p>“This is worse than I ever, ever, EVER could have imagined,” Harry thought to himself while he surveyed the blond standing across the room. Draco had aged well. Really, really well. Harry had heard bits and pieces about the git from Hermione, who saw Draco on occasion. But she never conveyed what Harry saw right in front of him. Draco was tall and slim, with shoulders that were just broader than the rest of his torso. In a perfectly tailored muggle suit and waistcoat, he looked powerful. His hair was slicked back as it had always been in school, but in a softer, more natural manner. He was still pale, but in a porcelain way, not in a “I am afraid the Dark Lord is going to impale me through the heart at any moment” kind of way. Harry barely noticed his clean shaven face or the subtle lines around his mouth and forehead. All Harry could see was his steely eyes. He had forgotten where he knew that color, appearing in his dreams every so often alongside the smell of copper. His instincts took over again as he firmly rooted himself into the floor, bending his knees slightly to lower his center of gravity.</p><p>Kingsley cleared his thought, bringing both men out of their shock induced hazes.</p><p>“Harry, it is a pleasure to see you son”, Kingsley said as he walked over to wrap the man in a hug.</p><p>“You too, Kings,” Harry replied, returning the hug and burying his face in the older man’s shoulder, much like one would do to their parent.</p><p>“How long had it been since they saw each other?” Draco thought to himself, feeling as though he was imposing on a long sought after reunion.</p><p>Kingsley released the man, holding onto his shoulders at arm’s length and examining him.</p><p>“Molly will not be happy, Harry”, he said with a chuckle.</p><p>Harry returned the man’s laugh alongside a sad and tight smile.</p><p>Remembering they were not along, Kingsley stepped aside so the two men were once again face to face, though neither of them knew what to do next other than stare.</p><p>“Please, take a seat, Harry,” Kingsley said as he walked over to the drink cart to pour Harry a glass of Hocklenor. Harry did as instructed, taking a seat in the armchair Kingsley had just vacated, never breaking eye contact with Draco. Draco resumed his seat, picked up his tumbler and with an effort he did not expect, broke eye contact with Harry in favor of a glance at the fire.</p><p>“Here you go son”, Kingsley said as he handed Harry the glass</p><p>“Thanks Kings”, Harry whispered, moving his gaze from Draco to the Minister.</p><p>The Minister took a seat on the small loveseat, his large frame dwarfing the piece of furniture. Before speaking, Kingsley took a long pull of his drink and firmly set his glass down on the table before him.</p><p>“I’m sure you are both curious as to why I have asked you here this evening,” he began.</p><p>The two men sat in silence, staring at the man in anticipation.</p><p>“There has been an incident in Wales, one that is causing me and the Ministry great concern. An event like this hasn’t occurred in the United Kingdom in over 300 years and so we are unsure of exactly how to proceed, which is where you two come in.”</p><p>“What kind of incident?”, Draco asked, more confused than he was this morning. He was a bureaucrat, a glorified pencil pusher and glad hander. He hadn’t been in the field for over a decade, let alone dealing with an incident that was causing the Minister or the Ministry “great concern”.</p><p>“Before I can answer that, I must first ask if you both accept the case. I cannot divulge the details without good reason. If either of you wish to leave, you may do so now, with no prejudice at all.” The Minister paused, looking at both men for a long moment.</p><p>“I’m game,” Harry replied, “If I wasn’t I would have damn well stayed on the island.”</p><p>Kingsley nodded, turning then to Draco.</p><p>Draco knew he should say no. He did not need this kind of disruption in his life. He had a routine and house plants and a life. He did not need to be running off to Wales with Harry sodding Potter for god knows how long. But he also knew that if he said no, the curiosity would eat away at him. No one had seen Harry Potter in England since the end of the War. Of course there had been rumors and talk of sightings, but never anything confirmed. Of course Draco knew he was alive and not completely incapacitated from the passing mentions by Hermione or the Weasel, but never any details. He had to know. Even though every bone in his body was scared out of his mind, he had to say yes.</p><p>“Yes, sir, I accept,” Draco said.</p><p>“Harry, you may tell your family you are here” Draco assumed he meant Granger and the Weasels and Andy and Teddy “but no one else. Draco, you may tell your friends and family you are on an assignment but may divulge no more details than that. You may not tell anyone where you are going or why, and you may not tell them anything about what you may…encounter while you are away.”</p><p>Draco was already regretting this decision.</p><p>“Okay,” replied the two men.</p><p>“I have chosen you both for specific reasons, of course. Harry is one of the world’s leading myth hunters, Draco. He is the top in his field and comes highly recommended by many Ministries and Administrations around the world. Draco is the Director for the Office of the Preservation of the International Statute of Secrecy, Harry, and has extensive knowledge of the wards and charms that keep the magical world hidden from muggles as well as those that protect muggles from the magical world. I hope I can count on both of you to put your boyhood feuds aside for this case.”</p><p>The two men looked at each other in silence once more. After one heartbeat they broke eye contact and turned back to the Minister.</p><p>“Alright, I guess that will have to do. Now….” Harry then reached for his rucksack which lay against the foot of his chair.</p><p>“No, no notes, I will provide you with a small pensive to bring with you to act as a reminder.”</p><p>Harry instantly stiffened in his chair, remembering the last case he took during which he could document nothing. It hadn’t ended well.</p><p>“One month ago we were alerted to some odd activity in the wizarding village that sits just a few kilometers away from Pendragon Castle,” Kingsley said slowly, careful to watch the reaction of the two men before continuing. Harry had closed his eyes and took a deep breath, obviously understanding what this meant. Draco, on the other hand, had a quizzical look on his face.</p><p>“What is it, son?” Kingsley asked Draco.</p><p>“I’m sorry sir but I don’t recall the significance on Pendragon Castle? The name sounds familiar but I don’t understand what this place has to do with me. Or MythHunting at that?”</p><p>“Pendragon Castle is the ancestral home of King Arthur and was the place of some of Merlin and Morgan Le Fay’s greatest magic,” Kingsley replied.</p><p>The gears of Draco’s mind finally began to turn. “Oh”, was all he could muster.</p><p>“Yes, indeed. Because the stories of Arthur and Merlin, and to a lesser extent Morgan, are so well known in the Muggle world, the Castle has become quite the tourist attraction. Draco, if you do some digging, you will be able to find the spells that have kept the magical aspects of the building concealed from Muggles. They were placed around the fourth century, so you’ll have to go back a bit. These wards and charms are meant to conceal not only the powers of the Castle, but a great deal of the Castle itself. When a muggle sees it, they see a dilapidated brick structure with a winnowing tower, this of course was meant to deter too much exploration and questions. Unfortunately, due to the ancient nature of the wards, wizards see much the same thing, though they can see and feel the wards that have been placed around the Castle.</p><p>“Last week, we received word that a Muggle was lost in the Castle. Her friend had come rushing into the only pub in Llanwyn begging for help. Luckily the owner of the pub is a wizard and was able to alert the Ministry, but the poor girl had to be obligated and her friend has still not been found. I don’t think I need to underscore why this turn of events is so urgent. I need you both to get to Llanwyn as soon as possible and try and get a handle on what is happening. I have an inkling about what is occurring, but I hope I am wrong.”</p><p>Draco also had an inkling about what was occurring and he also hoped liked absolute hell he was wrong. His first and only encounter with myth magic had been in his fourth year in Opus (that was the shorthand for the Office of the Preservation of the International Statute of Secrecy, as the alternative was too crude for the work place). His success on that case had given him his first promotion and commenced his trajectory to Director. While myth magic hadn’t occurred in England for centuries, it was more common in other countries, especially America. In the early 2000s he was on a junket with the Under Secretary for International Magical Cooperation in the Pacific Northwest of America, Washington to be exact, when a string of vampire attacks occurred. Vampires were not native to the area, though many magical creatures were, and the American wizarding community had been stunned and very concerned. Muggles were being taken almost weekly, their bodies left bloodless and white on street corners and in parks. The National Department of Magical Law Enforcement had to be called in and the British envoy was asked to stick around to help investigate as Europe had far more vampires than America. It was after a late lunch that Draco had stopped in a muggle book shop to see if they had any of the new James Patterson novels he secretly loved when he saw a gaggle of teen girls in the queue for the register holding a book called “Twilight” and pretending to bite one another. On the neck. Much like a Vampire. Draco dropped his book, ran into the alleyway next to the bookshop, and apparated to the wizarding hotel the British delegation had been occupying for the last two weeks. The muggle fervor around “Twilight” had made the area highly attractive to and conducive for Vampires, and as the story’s popularity grew, so did the magic’s strength. Draco relayed his discovery to the Under Secretary who took it to the Head of the American DMLE. They were thanked profusely for their assistance and left the Americans to deal with their issue. Upon their return, the Under Secretary asked Draco to become her executive liaison to Opus, and he rose quickly through the ranks.</p><p>The sheer magnitude of destruction that occurred in America on that visit, however, had stuck with Draco. He had never heard of anything like it since and he had hoped he never would. He never did find out how the Americans dealt with their problem, but since it was never mentioned on any subsequent trips across the pond, he had assumed it had been handled.</p><p>There was a long stretch of silence, each man lost in their own thoughts. Harry was the first to break it.</p><p>“Alright, Kings, I have some diagnostic questions for you before we take off”</p><p>“Woah there, Potter, we aren’t leaving tonight!” Draco interrupted.</p><p>“Obviously, Malfoy, its just an expression,” Harry said with a slight roll of his eyes, “Actually, I guess these questions could be for both of you, seeing as I haven’t been in England recently. Have there been any changes in either the Muggle or Wizarding school curriculum?”</p><p>“No”, both Draco and Kingsley answered. “There was talk a few years ago about changing it, but nothing to do with that part of either societies histories,” Kingsley continued. Draco nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Okay, the more obvious questions are around literature, film, video games, anything like that?” Harry asked, the question more directed at Draco this time.</p><p>“There was a relatively popular muggle game called Dungeons and Dragons that made a resurgence in late 2005, but that was mainly amongst a particular sect of teen muggle boys. Nothing like the fever I imagine would be needed to invoke myth magic,” Draco responded. noticing the puzzled look on Harry’s face.</p><p>“How does Draco know what invokes myth magic?” Harry thought. So few people even knew what it was, let alone what it took to invoke it.</p><p>“I’ve encountered it before, only once, and did some reading on it in the wake of the event. It was unlike anything I had ever seen,” Draco said in response to the obvious shock and confusion on Potter’s face.</p><p>“Right. Uhm, okay. What about any other places in Britain? Any outlandish breaches in the Statute by witches or wizards or magical creatures? Its getting close to the holidays, did Nicholas Kristoff break out of the Jannis Thickley ward again?”</p><p>“No, nothing like that,” Kingsley stated, “this is why I called you Harry. You know I wouldn’t have asked you to come back here if it wasn’t important.”</p><p>“I know, Kings, I know.”</p><p>Silence fell once again, each man picking up their forgotten tumblers and throwing back the warm, tingling liquid.</p><p>“Kings, I have one more question for you,” Harry said, “Do you think this could have anything to do with Voldemort?” Harry was doing his best not to look at Draco while he spoke, but he eyes darting towards the blond betrayed him.</p><p>“I don’t know Harry,” was all Kingsley could say.</p><p>Harry then looked directly at Malfoy and then down to his arm.</p><p>“Well, Malfoy? What do you say?” Harry said while shooting his eyes down to Draco’s left arm and raising his brows expectantly.</p><p>“My mark hasn’t burned for over 15 years, Potter, surely I would have told someone if it had?” Draco spat, offended Potter would think anything else.</p><p>“Just doing my job,” Harry muttered.</p><p>“Well do it without insult me, yeah?”</p><p>“Gentlemen, unless you have anymore questions, I will give you the case file and we can all be on our way,” Kingsley stated.</p><p>“Sure”</p><p>“Of course, Minister”</p><p>“Good. Now here is the file,” Kingsley fetched a small folder from his desk, tapped it twice and it duplicated, “Both of you read up and if you have anymore questions I will make myself available all day tomorrow. I have arranged with the Department for Magical Investigations that you may have access to anything you may need; research, equipment, potions, anything. I hope you will get out into the field as soon as possible, though, at very least to re-establish the wards and bar any more muggles from access the Castle.</p><p>Draco nodded. Harry just stared at the Minister.</p><p>“Harry, the floor in your tent will connect directly to this office and I have also amended the wards to allow you both to apparate in and out of this room. But only this room. It took me all night to adjust the wards without alerting the entire Ministry. Harry I know its important to you that few know you are in the country.”</p><p>“Thanks, I really appreciate it”</p><p>“Thats it for tonight, gentlemen,” Kinglsey rose out of his chair and moved so that there was a clear path to the door for both of them.</p><p>“Night, Kings,” Harry said with a hug, “give Katrina my love, I’m sure Molly will be having everyone over soon.”</p><p>“Ha, of course”</p><p>“Good evening, Minister,” Draco said as he shook Kingsleys hand. Kingsley returned the handshake and gave Draco a warm nod.</p><p>Harry and Draco found themselves standing outside of Kingsley’s study. Alone. Perhaps for the first time since the bathroom incident so many years ago.</p><p>The two men just stared at one another, unable to move or speak or even think for that matter. Hannah had long since gone home and the whoosh of the floo could be hear from behind the door from which they just exited. They were alone and had no idea what to do next.</p><p>“I arrive at my office promptly at 7am every morning, there are rarely more than charmed brooms around to notice me. Here is my office number,” Draco conjured a small piece of parchment with his name, title, office, and office number written upon it, “we’ll meet at 7 and go from there.” Draco said goodnight and began to walk towards the lifts, using every ounce of courage to not turn around and assess how Harry had reacted. Draco was in an absolute tizzy and needed to rely on the aloof haughtiness that had gotten him through so much of his life.</p><p>Draco arrived at the lifts, thankfully a golden grate stood open, waiting for a passenger. He quickly shoved the grate in place and barked out, “Floor 3, Opus!”.</p><p>“See you then,” Harry said to the empty corridor.</p>
