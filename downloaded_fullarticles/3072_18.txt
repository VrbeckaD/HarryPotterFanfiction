<p>No one knew about them. Which was why Draco was poised beneath Harry’s desk, mouth full of thick cock, and saliva dripping down from chin to throat. The fact that anyone could come in at anytime had been a tantalizing trip, enough that Harry was hard in seconds and shoving himself down Draco’s throat, hands tangled in blond hair, and thrusting so fast that Draco could barely breathe.</p>
