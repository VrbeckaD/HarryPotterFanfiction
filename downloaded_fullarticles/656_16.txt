    <p>Albus Dumbledore found a way to travel between dimensions. It had taken him a rather long time but after years of information gathering, he'd done it. He was only here for one reason and one reason only. He needed a Savior. What better person to be the savior than the child that this young woman just gave birth to?</p><p>He knew who the child's parents were and given that they were both powerful, she would be as well. While the mother was being taken care of by the midwife in this hovel of a place, he disillusioned himself and slid towards the baby. Before either could realize it, he'd already whisked the girl away. There was no reason for him to stay any longer within this realm and so he quickly made way to his own. </p><p>It was a rather simple trip if you discount all the time it took to figure out how to actually enter this dimension. </p><p>He quickly appeared close to Hogwarts and made his way inside. Once within his office after not being stopped by anyone on his way, he through some Floo Powder within the fire and shouted 'Potter Manor'. Dumbledore stepped within the flames and entered the sitting room where his two favorite students sat with one another.</p><p>"Albus! We didn't know you were coming over," James said as he stood up. </p><p>Lily, ever the more observant, noticed the child within his arms. "And who's this, Albus?"</p><p>"This child was left out in the Forbidden Forest," he grew solemn as he talked, "I know how you both have tried for a child and was wondering if you'd care for her?"</p><p>"It's a girl," Lily asked softly as she stepped forward and asked permission to take the child. Albus handed the baby over. He didn't think she wanted a response and it was her merely talking to herself.</p><p>"You know that we would be happy to take care of her, Albus. We'll need to blood adopt her but I don't see there being any other issues. Thank you for thinking of us," James said.</p><p>"Think nothing of it! Well, I shall be off now. I've had a rather trying day."</p><p>With that, Albus Dumbledore left the stolen child with the couple and stepped back through the flames.</p>
