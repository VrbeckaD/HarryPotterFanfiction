    <p>They’d been talking about and making this plan for three months. The remaining Unspeakables, Aurors, Wizengamot members, Medicals and Magicals from all walks of life had spent the last three months talking and arguing about what they were going to do, and finally, last week they’d finished their discussions and come to a decision.</p>
<p>Magic had started dying out in full a decade ago, after almost a century of being abused by its users. First, it began by the number of Squibs rising and Muggleborns dropping. Then the Magical Creatures and Races – Veela and the like – began reporting decreasing birth rates. And before anyone realized, the Magic in the world had been disappearing from everything else.</p>
<p>The loss of Magic was first noticeable in new objects or those that didn’t store Magic on their own – so most enchanted objects and new Ward schematics which hadn’t had the time to gain any external power. They began to stop working and failing until eventually they just ceased functioning and couldn’t be replaced.</p>
<p>Magicals with weaker Cores began to get sick shortly after – fever, chills, refusal of sustenance until eventually they just wasted away – and then they began dropping like flies. At first, Healers had thought that it was a new strain of Dragon Pox or some new disease from the Tropics – the last hosts of the Quidditch World Cup – but eventually that changed once they started doing more rigorous testing on those who held onto life. Concurrently, Wards put up within the past forty years began to fail – layer by layer disappearing until nothing remained.</p>
<p>Light Magicals went next – getting the same sickness and dying the same way as those who’d passed before them. Unfortunately, a good portion of the Weasley family had been part of the first wave of those ill and Percy had been the first to pass away. At the same time that Light Magicals were dying, the remaining Wards put up within the last one hundred years began to fail, going out layer by layer again but in a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>When these talks had started, Dark Magicals were just beginning to lose their magic – the Crabbe and Goyle families being the first to fall – and at the same time Heavy Wards began to drain.</p>
<p>Now, with only few Magicals left – mostly Magicals with a Gray affinity or a Strong Core – and only the Ancient Wards around Hogwarts, the Ministry, and Gringotts remaining, they have to put their last resort plan into action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“‘Mione, ‘Mione. We’ll be fine. Draco and I have been planning for this for months. We are as prepared as we can be,” Harry patted Hermione’s hand lightly as he settled back down next to her hospital bed from where he’d gotten up to get her some water.</p>
<p>Hermione coughed and took a sip from the glass before she spoke, “If you two are sure…”</p>
<p>“We’re sure. Bill, Charlie, Georgie, and Susan are coming to see us off.” He raised his wrist to check his watch. “And I really have to be going, it’s almost time.” He stood from his seat, pressed a light kiss to the top of her head, and exited the room.</p>
<p>He took his time to walk down to the Ministry, taking in everything around him. This may be the last time he’d ever see the buildings or trees or even the few people he recognized as he walked past them again.</p>
<p>He stepped in through the Unspeakable entrance, pressing his thumb to the new scanner before waiting for the lift to go down. As it counted down the floors he thought back on the past.</p>
<p>After defeating Voldemort, he’d returned to school and spent the next year catching up so that he could sit for his N.E.W.T. tests. He’d had to stuff almost two years of learning into one and it had only been with the help of both Hermione and Draco that he’d passed all his N.E.W.T.s.</p>
<p>Upon graduating, he and Ginny had married – though only for the convenience and to get Mrs. Weasley to stop hinting and harping at them – and he had joined the Unspeakables at Director Drakona’s insistence with Draco at his side as his partner. From there, he’d spent the first decade of his time researching many things – the Wards around his relatives’ home, time-turners and how they work, Patroni and their effects on Dementors with a look at how Dementors do what they do, and Magical genetics. Once that first decade had been completed, he and Draco had been given the task of studying the Veil, and it was almost a decade before they figured out that the Veil was a doorway to the Spirit World and that at one point in time, there had been one in each continent.</p>
<p>Now, they have no choice and he and Draco were about to embark through the Veil. They needed to see if there was some way of changing things, of fixing things. And this was the best idea.</p>
<p>The bell of the lift dinged and the doors opened. He stepped out and headed to the door he knew would take him to the Veil room. He threw it open and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The small group that waited for him surprised him some as he hadn’t expected a few of them. Waiting for him in front of the Veil were five redheads, three blonds, three brunettes, two ravens, and one person whose hair couldn’t decide on its color. William ‘Bill’ Weasley, Charles ‘Charlie’ Weasley, George Weasley, Ginevra ‘Ginny’ Potter-Weasley, and Susanna ‘Susan’ Bones-Corner were the redheads. Draconis ‘Draco’ Malfoy, Scorpius Malfoy – Draco and Astoria’s son, and Lunetta ‘Luna’ Lovegood were the blonds. Daphne Greengrass, Astoria Greengrass-Malfoy and Neville Longbottom were the brunets. Of the ravens were Dean Thomas, and Albus Potter – his and Ginny’s seventeen-year-old son. And the last was Harry’s godson Teddy Lupin-Black, whose hair kept cycling through the color spectrum as he shifted from foot to foot.</p>
<p>Ginny stepped up to his side and wrapped her arms around him in a hug before she pulled back to look at both Harry and Draco, “Are you two still sure about this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Gin. We’ve no other choices. We are the last of Britain’s Wizarding population, unless you want to count the dozen or so people wasting away in Mundane hospitals,” Harry remarked as he settled his arms around her, Teddy, and Albus.</p>
<p>He hugged the three of them to his chest, breathing them in quietly before he pulled away. He cupped their faces, staring into their eyes for a long moment before he pressed a kiss to their foreheads and whispered, “I love you,” against their skin.</p>
<p>They soon moved away and he moved to say good-bye to the others who’d come to see them off. Bill and Charlie simply gave him a quick hug and told him how lucky they were to have met him. George wrapped him tightly in his arms and whispered quietly into his ear, “Freddie would have been so proud of you, little brother.” Harry could only make a soft noise before he pulled away to wipe at his eyes.</p>
<p>Luna and Neville came over next. They each wrapped their arms around his shoulders and he wrapped his arms around their waists. Harry pressed a kiss to Luna’s forehead and whispered quietly so that only she and Neville could hear, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Luna hummed softly in response before she spoke, “I know.”</p>
<p>Luna had the unfortunate fate of being a Bound Seer, which meant that she would continue to live until <em>all</em> Magic was gone. Leaving her as the last of the Magicals unless something else killed her before Magic disappeared.</p>
<p>Harry pulled away from the two of them, and quickly greeted the remaining members of the group: pressing light kisses to the cheeks of Astoria, Daphne, and Susan; hugging Scorpius lightly while quietly warning him against hurting his son who the blond was dating; and finally, clasping arms with Dean who was beginning to get ill and was leaning heavily on a pair of crutches.</p>
<p>With everyone now addressed, Draco and Harry began to ready themselves. They removed their robes, their practically powerless wands, their D.O.M. ID cards, and the few remaining magical items that were still working that were on their person. With everything set down and away from them, they stepped up to the Veil.</p>
<p>“Together? Or would you like to go first?” Harry questioned as they stopped before it.</p>
<p>“Might as well go together,” Draco replied, looking quizzically at the shimmering silver cloth before them. Harry nodded and they took a step closer to the old cloth.</p>
<p>They each turned back to share one last look with their loved ones before simultaneously they took a deep breath and took the plunge with eyes closed, stepping up and through the cloth, leaving behind the world.</p>
