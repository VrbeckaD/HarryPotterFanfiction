  <b>Draco Malfoy: </b>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy had always believed that he had been born for greatness; he was a wizard of pure blood, from an honorable and great family, he had ended up in the most esteemed Hogwarts house, and he his grades had been more than satisfactory. He was bound for an easy time in school, with excellent academic credentials, whereas upon graduating school he was sure to gain a high position within the ministry, and gain friends and admirers from his fellow Death Eaters. Then, to add further to how lucky he was to be born when he was, Voldemort had returned during his lifetime. He was one of the few young Death Eaters who had spoken with the Dark Lord himself, and he had been entrusted with a task of utmost importance and glory: killing Albus Dumbledore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet, pureblood didn’t mean anything to most wizards anymore, his grades were not good enough to be outstanding at all, despite being good, he didn’t have an easy time at school. Nobody admired him, nobody listened to him unless he mention his dad beforehand, and nobody really cared what he thought. Voldemort’s return had been horrible, most of his followers were less than thrilled to have him back, since the only truly loyal ones were locked up in Azkaban for their crimes. He had been chosen by the Dark Lord for a task he couldn’t possibly complete, to make a mockery out of his family and the family’s name. He had of course failed the task, and had been forced to go on the run, thus, he had no real education and couldn’t actually get a well paid, respected job, all he could do was hide at home, with all the crazy Death Eaters and the Dark Lord himself living there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then came the war, the final battle, and the Dark Lord was defeated by Harry Potter, and suddenly, his side had completely lost. The war was over, anyone who had fought on the Dark Lord’s side was to be tried for their crimes and removed from the Wizarding World. A lot of people had very strong opinions against Draco Malfoy, as he had been witnessed being embraced and accepted by the Dark Lord in front of the entire school… there was no real doubt in anyone’s mind that the Malfoys were war criminals. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet there were many criminals to prosecute, and unlike last time, the wizards and witches called for fair trials, demanding that everyone be tried fairly and justly. Many just wanted the criminals gone, but the ministry was already criticized so heavily for all their own crimes and inaction, that they were desperately trying to win back the trust of the public by keeping the trials fair and honest. So the ministry had to come up with some manner of way to keep those waiting for prosecution. There was far too many people to be able to keep them locked up, so only the most dangerous ones were put in arrest, while the rest were allowed to go free, under the condition that they were subdued under a certain tracking spell. The spell in question was called </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sequor Vos</span>
  </em>
  <span> (follow you) and it took the shape of a white, vaguely luminescent ribbon around the affected one’s neck. The spell was not removable by anyone other than the caster, and it would signal to all those who encountered the one with the mark that the person was wanted by the ministry. The spell itself was but a tracking spell, that would let the caster locate the object of said spell on any map, so the person affected could never outrun the caster. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those given the ribbon were explicitly told to not leave the country, or they would be hunted down and automatically deemed guilty. The spell was kept a secret from people outside of the ministry, and even within the ministry from the divisions who would never have the need to use the spell and even then it was strictly forbidden from being used carelessly. If a caster died before removing the spell, the mark would last for forever, thus it was very important to the ministry to avoid branding people for life, if an accidental or not so accidental death was to happen. Everyone subjected to the spell also had the memory of the spell’s name removed, thus it was most commonly referred to as ‘The ministry’s collar curse.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While his father and mother had not been allowed to leave their cells, Draco had been sent off with the collar curse on his neck, leaving him alone in a hostile world, where more than a few people were eager to get their hands on anything that resembled a Death Eater, and the ministry’s collar curse was an open invitation for violence. Draco had been living in fear for the last months, and that fear had culminated into a single, horrible, panic when his father had been tried and sentenced to Azkaban. Draco was desperate, frightened, and marked with a curse that would either get him hurt or rejected from everyone he knew, leading to him standing outside a door he never thought he would be standing outside of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco took a long and deep breath, pulled his scarf tighter around his neck as if to shield himself from the cold, before he lift his hand and pressed the doorbell to Harry Potter’s house, located in Godric’s Hollow. The lights were on inside the house, and Draco could hear footsteps approaching the door. He stepped back, and waited for the familiar face with the round glasses and the unruly black hair to peek out from inside the warm house. Upon looking at his face, Draco found himself at a loss for words for a few seconds, before he finally gathered enough courage to speak. “...May I come inside? I have to speak to you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted very much to be his usual, powerful self, who would simply demand to be let inside, and demand Potter to listen to him, but months of loneliness and fear had dulled his mind to concepts of pride. He would have liked to consider himself humble looking, but to the piecing green gaze that was Harry Potter’s eyes, he most likely appeared weak and frightened. Draco pulled his clothes closer around him, staring down at the rug on the porch which said ‘welcome in, unless you are a vampire.’ He felt like the rug was mocking him, so he glanced up at Potter again, while shifting nervously. It was starting to get rather cold, he could see his own breath in the air when he breathed. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>Harry Potter:</b>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Harry Potter had never gotten used to being alone; it was simply not something which seemed natural to him. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>At first, he had lived, albeit very mistreated, with a family who was still always there, and very loud at that; there had been no way to get away from their noises, neither from the scrub under the stairway, nor the room that became his in later years. Then of course, upon being sent to Hogwarts, privacy was lost in living in shared spaces, and constantly spending time around his two best friends, not that he minded, he wasn’t very good at being alone with his own thoughts. Further places he hadn’t been alone was during the times he was allowed to live with the Weasley family, the celebrations he had shared with them, time he had spent around Remus Lupin in later years, with Dumbledore himself, and time with the Phoenix Order. Even at the time of running away and staying in hiding, he had never been alone, as Ron and Hermione had been with him. Needless to say, the entirety of Harry’s life could almost be summarized with a buzz of sounds and impressions, people and their voices. It was because of the constant buzz of noise, that the complete silence of his parent's house was so very jarring to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had discovered that he didn’t very much appreciate being alone with his own thoughts. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone, himself least of all, but then again he had never been very good at foreseeing consequences, if he had been, he imagined the past seven years of his life to have turned out differently. It was always in hindsight he realized matters, and it was very annoying to the young wizard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even after his family’s home being restored, the house felt big, empty, and quite so eerie; it felt lonely; it felt a little maddening. Harry was absolutely positive he could hear the wind outside the windows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The war had ended, and the world had finally, finally, settled down into being normal, well, normal for a kid who found out he was a wizard, Harry supposed. His legacy in itself had ended, the prophecy which Voldemort had so believed in, the threat of Voldemort himself, and now he wasn’t just the Boy Who Lived, but also the Man Who Killed The Dark Lord. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Harry had always wondered why the wizarding world felt off and odd to him, but as he had grown older, as he had been taken in to the Ministry to become an Auror before he even finished school, as his words started affecting the entirety of the English Wizard community, he was starting to understand his problem with it. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was an absolute nobody, practically muggle-born as he had lived with a non-magic family all his life. If Voldemort’s idea of racial superiority was indeed wrong, then he was no better than anyone muggle-born, as he had never had the advantage of growing up with great wizards and witches around him. Unlike his fellow classmates, he had never heard a word about the magic that lived around it in everyday life, being completely new to everything which others already had taken for granted existed. He wasn’t the brightest student, he may have been very much uncannily lucky, but he was nowhere near as bright or dedicated as Hermione, or many other students for the matter, and he could barely practice magic alone, and learnt nothing more, as he had been thrown back into the muggle world every year he finished school, for a long time. He was already at a disadvantage, and then expected to have no time to catch up on his own, during his free time. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In all honesty, he had been a terrible student. There were certain things he was very good at, such as catching things very quickly, and getting some simpler spells right, but he never learnt the more advanced things he was supposed to know; he was never one of the best. During his school years, despite the awe of everything magical he experienced, it still felt so far away and out of reach, when such huge loads of it was thrown on him repeatedly. It felt like opening a far too thick book with far too tiny text font, that happened to be a sequel to a book he had never read or heard about, expecting him to already know a lot of which the book brought up; of course he had been discouraged as a child, and no one had really helped him get past that mindset. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Harry was the least qualified to everything he had accomplished, and while it had made him feel very special and great at the time, looking back, he only saw the accomplishments of other people who would never be mentioned in the story. He couldn’t count the number of times where Hermione had done all the work, all the preparation and all the problem solving, he had completely lost count of the times he had been saved by teachers, grown ups and even stranger magical creatures, and he couldn’t for the life of him remember a time when he hadn’t caused a lot of damage as well, just for being him, just for being The Boy Who Lived. He held no illusions that he wasn’t special, his circumstances were special, but who he was didn’t quite matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His existence had brought upon a war, had made Voldemort’s return possible, and had taken so much away from him, but even worse, from others who weren’t used to having nothing. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Sometimes it was just the little things, things that just felt like enormous mistakes, once he gave them proper thought.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He remembered his first year at Hogwarts, and how it felt like he was taking part in some fantastical fairy tale. He had found very quickly that said fairy tale was only fun until it got dangerous, and when it got dangerous, it was because they were foolish children not supposed to do what they had done. That year Harry had already become a legend of his own, because he, and his friends, had received points for defeating the Dark Lord, only, if one really thought about it, they hadn’t done anything but endangering themselves and others. Voldemort had not been strong enough to be a threat to any talented, more experienced, wizard, even a centaur had scared him off, lucky for Harry. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>In actuality, in his first year, by his own foolish, childish mistake and behaviour, he almost saw to Voldemort’s return. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>There was no way Professor Quirrell could have gotten the stone, Dumbledore had explained how it worked. All Harry ever accomplished by being there was ruining an almost impenetrable defense, by instead placing a defenseless child with the stone in his pocket in front of the Dark Lord. Then, he was saved by his mother’s spell again, but that was such a moment of sheer luck that it left a bitter taste in his mouth upon thinking about it, and how wrong things could have gone. After that, three small children were rewarded for said behaviour, and for endangering the entire world, and Harry couldn’t help but to think that it had become the catalyst for his recklessness in the upcoming years. It had made him feel like he was the most qualified, like it was his responsibility, like the scar on his head actually formed his destiny and he would succeed at everything on his own. He never did succeed at mostly anything on his own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sort of felt tricked, he felt like a tool. He had always adored Albus Dumbledore, always trusted the man, but the more he thought back, the more he stayed up long at night, staring up at the ceiling of his empty house, he couldn’t help but to feel like a set piece. He knew that Dumbledore had used people as set pieces before, himself included, and was prepared to sacrifice, and with everything said and done, he couldn’t help but feel a nagging sensation that he had been blindly brought along a road, without ever getting to see what happened along it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had left one of the current generation’s absolute worst, most reckless and least qualified wizards, namely himself, known as one of the time’s greatest wizards for defeating Voldemort. It had left him a legend that he didn’t deserve, one that was bothering him even more than the first legend, where he had only been glorified for something his parents had accomplished, where he never had any involvement. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After all which had been lost, it was getting increasingly hard to be excited over his fame, to believe it had been worth it. Upon realizing that the wizarding world was still as foolish as it had always been, still as unstable and corrupt, as to that they would listen to him just for being who he was, no matter his qualifications, he had tried his best to use it to his advantage. His voice had carried a lot of weight in the request to give the Death Eaters and followers of Voldemort fair trials. It would still carry a lot of weight as he stepped into the corrupt, inefficient, courtroom in a few days as a witness of the trial of Draco Malfoy. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a good distraction from all the darker thoughts that swirled about inside his head, after everything that had happened, to have tried to come to a conclusion about Draco Malfoy. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Of course, he had already come to a conclusion, knowing well what he would say about the other. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Speaking of the Devil. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>His doorbell rang, and while the world had gotten a lot safer, he was still too famous to dare take any risks, hence, he brought his wand with him. Still, the sight he found outside his door was a somewhat tousled up, clearly miserable, Draco Malfoy, looking at him with a strange pleading gaze that just-... didn’t suit the young man at all. It was kind of jarring to see Draco that way, even for someone he didn’t know that well personally. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Harry himself wasn’t the most in order, he hadn’t shaved properly, and was dressed in nothing but a muggle t-shirt of plain color and pajama trousers, and immediately felt the cold air of late autumn bite at his skin. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Draco…? Uh, sure.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He was very bloody surprised to find the young man on his doorstep. It was really as simple as that in the muggle world, Court systems made a lot more sense, where witnesses weren’t allowed to discuss and meet with the prosecuted individual under just any circumstances before the trial. However, he sort of, well, had to let Draco in; it wasn’t purely about the fact that Draco somehow managed a look of a desperate and thrown away pup, but also because if Harry actually was going to speak the way he had planned at the trial, he might as well uphold his own words. It was actually rather preferable to him, as Draco had just earned a chance to prove himself.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He moved out of the way, and closed the door behind the boy-turned-young-man who had probably always regarded him a bigger enemy than he had regarded Draco. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Uh, do you want tea, coffee, something warm? Let’s just talk in the kitchen.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b>Draco Malfoy:</b>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Harry Potter addressed him by his first name, completely out of the blue. Draco was more than a little surprised to find himself spoken to on a first name basis, rather than by his surname. He couldn’t recall the other man ever using anything but ‘Malfoy’ when speaking to him, and the change in names seemed completely out of the blue to him. Still, he was invited inside, and took the chance to quickly enter, as to avoid the autumn evenings cold bites. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house was warm, and Draco quickly relaxed, only to blame himself for the carelessness, causing him to return to his tense position of a man who was completely out of his element. He didn’t thank Potter for letting him in, the very concept of saying such things as ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ was very alien to the pureblood wizard, so much so that he neglected to show his host that simple courtesy. “Tea, yes, I don’t drink mu… I mean, I don’t drink non-ma… I, just tea is fine.” He stopped himself from calling coffee a muggle drink or a non-magic folk drink, which it very much was, but Draco didn’t think his view of the drink would be appreciated by Harry Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pureblood removed his jacket, and hung it up, while keeping the scarf on, despite the warmth of the home. He wasn’t quite ready to reveal the collar curse to his host just yet. Soon, he found himself sitting by Harry Potter’s kitchen, in a bright, warm home, where the only black color came from his host’s hair. Draco had never been in any other kitchen than the one at home, where everything was a dark gray or black, from the floor to the furniture, except the furniture that was in dark mahogany. Compared to his home, Potter’s was so very… bright and open. It was almost jarring to the pureblood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter was making tea for him, slouching about in his unclean kitchen in pajamas and… whatever that shirt was supposed to be. Had this happened a few months ago, or maybe a year ago, he would have blamed the other for the unwashed dishes and the sloppy presentation of himself. But time changed a man, Draco would no longer blame the other, for he knew what it was like to be stressed and having nobody else who did things for him. Draco had grown up with a house elf who did all the work, and a mother who would not have her son caught dead doing housework. Thus, he was absolutely hopeless at all of those things, and he had a hard time managing the simplest clean up spells unless he gave said spell his full focus. Right now, Draco did not have full focus to give, so he had naturally failed to keep the house in check all on his own, for it was a very big house. Dishes piled up, clothes weren’t being washed, the food turned more and more simple, and dust gathered in the corners. It took all he had to remember to shave once in a while, as he had been taught to never, ever show himself in anything less than perfect, a philosophy which had caused Draco a myriad of problems and anxieties for most of his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter finished making a cup of tea for Draco, and he was given said tea in a mug,<a href="http://userimages-akm.imvu.com/userdata/42/02/05/51/userpics/Snap_ySKA7jLVOZ660434713.jpg" rel="nofollow"> shaped like a chubby unicorn, with the words ‘I don’t believe in humans’ on.</a>  The pureblood looked up at his host, unable to hide the utter confusion on his face. Potter was smiling at him, in a perfect impression of gleeful innocence that made Draco confused enough to not make any comments about the mug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sat in silence for a short while, as Draco absently played with the teabag in his chubby unicorn mug, trying to gather his thoughts. He spotted </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Daily Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the table, and picked it up, flipped the newspaper open and turned it around for Potter to see. The page showed a moving picture of his father, in the middle of a big courtroom, with the text ‘Lucius Malfoy sentenced to Azkaban for War Crimes’ underneath the picture. Draco took a deep breath, it was clear that he was very shaken. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father… was judged guilty by the ministry… My mother will be trialed tomorrow, and… I will be judged in a few days… I… I know that my mother saved you, my mother was never involved with anything that He did, she really didn’t have much of a say in anything. I know you will be a key witness in the trial, and since she saved your life, she shouldn’t have any problems being excused for her crimes. That’s not… why I’m here…” He stopped, bit his lip, and stared down at the chubby unicorn mug in silence. “...I know I’ve been… I made mistakes, I know I’ve been cruel to you for as long as we’ve known each other, I know I’ve said bad things about your friends, I know I’ve not been a, uh… nice person at all. Least of all to you: but I came here… To beg you to speak favorably for me at the trial. If anyone can save me from Azkaban, it’s you. I know I haven’t done things that would probably make you want me to be locked away forever, but I would never survive in there…! My life will be miserable enough as I was openly endorsed by that… that… monster! Potter, you’re the only one who can give me even a chance at, at... life at all!” </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Draco had imagined himself to be able to present his request in a less… panicky, embarrassing way, but he had clearly failed. Worst of all, he was showing himself weak and desperate to somebody else, which was not allowed for a Malfoy, and he was doing it in front of Harry Potter, while begging to be saved. Yet he didn’t care. He was willing to go through all of this, if it gave him even the smallest chance of escaping from the fate of Azkaban. </span>
