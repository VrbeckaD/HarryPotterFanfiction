  <span>He was fidgeting in front of them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Looking down at his hands picking at his nails.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A bad habit he had started which always made Severus pushed his hands down.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He had taken to watching from the shadows; watching their routine.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His therapist was sitting on the couch by the tree with her daughter, Elise. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She called his attention back to her,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s okay.” She said softly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He watched when they came out and threw the trash out, to clean the sidewalks, to make snowmen.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He took a deep breath and took a step a closer to Remus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Slowly he raised his hands wrapped the around the man's body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He squeezed lightly, afraid that he was doing it wrong.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He noticed that on Sunday when the sun started to set, they would come out.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus stilled and waited.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a few seconds he placed his arms around the boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He noticed the flinch but the boy didn’t pull away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Both of them, one with long greasy hair, one with shabby tawny hair. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry pulled back and repeated the gesture with the other man. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The dark hair man rubbed circles above his shoulder blades.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After that he turned back to the tree and started to pass out gifts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They would go around the perimeter wands raised, words whispered under their breath. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry made no big deal about it,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So they didn’t either.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But it was. It was a huge deal.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They would strengthen the wards.Tearing down parts and rebuilding them better.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This was the first time that he initiated the contact.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the most contact that he had made since he came to live with them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And they both would destroy the world to be able to do it again.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>It would be in that moment, between night and day, that he would be able to slip in.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As the day bled into night, every person laughed and smiled over their gifts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Elise and her strawberry blonde hair would laugh and push chocolates towards Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That's when Charice, his therapist, would pull the two men into the hallway.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>So he waited. Until he felt the warning energy fall in front of him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s been working on that for weeks.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She said to the men, as they stared at the kids. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A blonde with strawberry earrings sat by Harry’s feet.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He darted in, his paws propelling him forward. He hid behind the garden shed.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Elise has been joining me to help with contact. So has Luna.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The men had noticed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The flinching, though still there, wasn’t as brutal.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He hid between a box holding a hose and firewood.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s not going back.” It was Remus who spoke up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His voice soft and didn’t carry far.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man next to him nodded his head agreement.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He waited for the last light to go out before he walked towards the back door.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She looked at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had talked about but she was now waiting for an answer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He needs to move forward,” Severus continues for the other man, “Hogwarts is his past.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Transforming on the steps, he pulled out the stolen wand and pointed at the door hearing a click. He was in. </span>
  </em>
