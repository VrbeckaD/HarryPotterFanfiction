    <p>I woke up to my bedroom door being pushed opened, my eyes opened to see my papa and dad trying to sneak in.<br/>"Happy Birthday, pup". Papa says as he flops down onto my bed. I sat up and wrapped my arms around my papa’s neck while my dad kissed my head.</p>
<p>"Thanks guys, but you both suck at trying to sneak in." I tell them with a laugh, as I pull away from Papa's arms Dad hands me a small box and a white envelope.<br/>"This is from your mother and father, they wanted you to have it on your 21st birthday." Dad said.</p>
<p>I opened the box revealing a beautiful necklace, picking it up I looked at the pendant, a stag with a white lily between the antlers.<br/>"Your father had it made after your parents were married." Papa explained.<br/>I slip it on, as tears start to fall.<br/>"We'll be waiting downstairs for you, come on Sirius let's give him a moment to read his letter." Dad says as he pull papa out the door.<br/>Once the door closed I opened and the letter with shaky hands.<br/>My Dearest Harry,<br/>If you're reading this then something happened to your father and I. First, Happy 21st Birthday my little Bambi.<br/>At this point I don't know if you are a death angel yet, If you are then I’m so proud of you. Now, the main reason for this letter is to tell you that I have a brother who lives in America. His name is Robert Singer, but he goes by Bobby. You only met him once when you were a one year old. He cut me out of his life after his wife died. I want you to go meet him and do hide it if your a death angel, he's a hunter. Remember that your father and I love you with all of our hearts.<br/>With all my love,<br/>Mom<br/>I drop the letter in shock, getting out of bed quickly,<br/>I dressed and hurried down to the kitchen feeling anger course through my veins. Papa and dad are sitting at the table with mugs in their hands.<br/>"Did you know that I had a bloody uncle that’s still alive!" I scream at them, watching them both go pale.<br/>My dad answers, "Well yes, we both knew about Bobby. Your mother and him had a falling out after your aunt died."<br/>I start pacing back and forth, " You both lied to me. I asked you when I was 11 if I had any living family, right before I started at Hogwarts Academy." I tell them in a matter of fact tone.<br/>The tears start coming up to the surface thinking about all the years I’ve been lied to.<br/>"We thought it was best by not telling you because he's a hunter." Papa tries to explain to me.<br/>Seeing red I blow my top and scream.</p>
<p>“That's a bunch of hogwash, you come from a long line of hunters, Papa! And dad does research for them. Hell, I've been on a couple of hunts myself." I yell.<br/>I take a deep breath,"So, you're going to tell me everything about him and where he lives or I'll find out on my own. And it will be a very long time before I darken the doorstep." I tell them.</p>
