    <p>The corridors of Hogwarts were barely recognizable now. Statues broken along with the still bodies of Death Eaters and friends alike. She wanted to feel sad, to close the eyes of the classmates and allies who stared off into Oblivion. Hermione wanted to pay her respects, but she didn’t have time. A bright red light flew past her face, so close it singed the skin on her cheek, and she countered so swiftly that she didn’t remember what curse she used to incapacitate the Snatcher to her left.</p><p>She <em> did not </em> have time for this. There was a nauseating twang in her stomach as her head caught fire and her eyes squeezed shut to try and null the pain that was overwhelming her being. She didn’t have time.</p><p>“Hermione?!” Automatically her wand sang through the air like a saber and trained on the voice that had called out to her. “Easy, girl!” She began to recognize the voice as it spoke again, breaking through the ringing in her ears. “Hermione, aren’t you supposed to be with Harry?!”</p><p>“I don’t have time for this, Neville!” Her house mate’s hands were up in surrender as she lowered her wand and turned to start running again.</p><p>“Wait!” The tall boy grabbed her by the arm and she had the strongest urge to stun him and start running again. “Hermione, they’ve fallen back! We’re supposed to be regroupin’ to the Great Hall.”</p><p>“Do you know where Fleur is?” She asked suddenly as she looked into dark eyes that almost matched her own and Neville blinked rapidly a few times before shaking his head. “Then let me go, Neville, or by Merlin I will hex you!” </p><p>“Why’re you looking for her?” He asked as Hermione ripped her arm out of his grasp and continued on her unknown path. Neville called after her again, but Hermione ignored him. She didn’t know where she was going, but her feet were leading her somewhere. Something was wrong and she didn’t have time to analyze it like her brain wanted. She just followed. </p><p>“Fleur.” Her voice was soft as she ran past the splintered door and into the courtyard, down the path that led to the lake. Outside of the castle, it was quiet, eerily quiet, and still dark as the moon hung low in the starless sky. Besides the obvious marring of her surroundings, it seemed as if there wasn’t a war going on. She ran past Hagrid’s demolished hut and the trees blurred around her.</p><p>Her lungs were burning as she jumped over a dead log and saw a few of the Aurors combing for the bodies of their comrades. Her mind ignored all of this. The pull in her body was getting stronger as her nerves began to hum. The only thing that pulled her back to reality was the splash of icy water that soaked through her shoes as she reached the edge of the lake. Hermione inhaled sharply, as if she’d never taken a breath in her life. Her dark eyes scanned the expanse of land around her.</p><p>Trees were broken, craters were blown into the earth, and the smell of blood and burning flesh was all around in the air. But Hermione wasn’t paying attention to any of that. Desperately, she began to search the edge of the lake and out over its dark waters. The surface was like glass and Hermione wished she could just walk on the surface, but if anyone was in the lake, they had long sunk to the bottom.</p><p>
  <em> Here… </em>
</p><p>The brunette spun around as a soft breeze wrapped around her and shattered the moonlight reflecting off of the water. That’s when she saw it. The silhouette of a body pulling itself slowly out of the water, disturbing the façade of peace. Her wand was clenched tight in her hand as she ran towards the shadow. Coughing filled the air as the figure fell onto their back as their body escaped the clutches of the lake and gasped hungrily for oxygen.</p><p>Hermione was not a religious person, or spiritual in any way. She depended on knowledge and analysis, but at that moment, she prayed. Prayed to any god that was listening to her that the body she was running towards, was Fleur. That she was alive. That this pull in her chest wasn’t a foreboding sign.</p><p>“Fleur?” The brunette called out tentatively as she was less than ten feet from the silhouette. “Fleur, is that you?” There was no answer, just the raspy intake of air and the sounds of the rocks shifting under the figure. “Lumos.”</p><p>The Brightest Witch of her Age, that’s what people called her. Harry Potter’s best friend. But as soon as the light of her wand bathed over the silver blonde hair that was drenched in blood, she was none of those things. She didn’t care about Harry, her mind could not function rationally as she dropped her wand and fell to her knees.</p><p>“Oh, Merlin…” She breathed as one blue eye barely opened and looked up at the brunette.</p><p>“H-Hermi-” Fleur’s body shook from her coughing fit and Hermione cringed as she moved to cradle the part-Veela on her lap, her arms instinctively cradling her head. As the assault calmed, a weak chuckle took its place and Hermione looked down at the woman in her arms. “I really fucked up this time, mon coeur. Oui?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Hermione chastised gently as she removed Fleur’s wand from her cold hands and lit it. A soft gasp escaped the brunette’s throat as she saw the extent of the Veela’s injuries. Clad in black, she couldn’t tell if her clothes were drenched in blood or just water. But the rips and burns to the cloth gave her the view of the gashes and bruises that scarred once flawless skin. “Who?” Fleur flinched slightly as her one good eye opened fully and looked up at Hermione. “Who did this to you?”</p><p>“Would you believe it was Bill?” The blonde answered weakly as another sardonic chuckle escaped her lips. “I think…I think he still holds a...what’s it’s called? <em> Une rancune. </em>”</p><p>“A grudge…” The younger witch whispered as her brow furrowed and her mind finally returned to her. She waved the wand slowly over Fleur’s body and began chanting the healing spells that were second nature to her now. “He would hold onto something like that.”</p><p>“Can you blame him?” Fleur muttered as she visibly relaxed and closed her eye. “I broke his heart.” Hermione shook her head and gently combed her fingers through blood stained locks that were still as smooth as satin, letting the hand rest on the Veela’s abdomen. </p><p>“I did too, Fleur.” She sighed. “It wasn’t just you.” A small smile broke loose on the Veela’s lips as her cold hand gently covered Hermione’s that was resting on her stomach. </p><p>“I don’t recall you canceling the wedding, Hermione.” There were voices sounding behind them and Hermione whipped her head around to see the white lights of wands flitting erratically in the darkness. Fleur tilted her head back and saw them as well before looking up at the brunette. “Get out of here.”</p><p>“No, Fleur.” Hermione answered firmly as she gently removed herself from the blonde. “They can help you.”</p><p>“There is no help for me, ma belle.” The Veela hissed. “Leave me and go. If they find out that you’ve-”</p><p>“Who’s there?!” Hermione stood and put her hands up as if to stop the figures from approaching. “Stop! It’s Hermione Granger.” She shouted and three of the six lights lowered while the others continued to draw nearer. “Please, she’s injured and needs help.” Her dark brown eyes glanced down frantically at Fleur, who had tried to roll onto her stomach, but was still on her right side, neck craned to look at the Aurors. “Please.”</p><p>Mr. Weasley was the one who stepped forward and stopped Robards, the Head of the Auror Office, from advancing any further. Hermione stared at him, eyes begging to help her before glancing back down at Fleur. There was a gentle sorrow, an apathy, as Arthur walked over to her and laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. He looked far older than she remembered, the war had weathered him and he sighed heavily as he shook his head.</p><p>“You know we can’t heal Death Eaters, Hermione.” His gaze fell onto Fleur at that moment, who had opted to turn over onto her back and chuckled. “I know you want to believe she isn’t what she is, but she’s a traitor. We can’t trust her.”</p><p>“She’s incapacitated!” Hermione shouted as she saw Robards’s hand flinch slightly and tighten around his wand. “She’s not a threat right now.” Her eyes fell back frantically to Arthur. “Mr. Weasley, please, she needs medical attention.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Hermione.” He muttered softly as he lowered his gaze. “She will be taken prisoner in her current condition.” Arthur turned to walk away as Hermione’s brow hardened and she clenched her hands into fists, realizing then that her wand was gone. Her eyes darted back and forth as she looked over her shoulder and saw it a few feet to her left. </p><p align="center">x—x</p><p>
  <em> Hermione sat, fidgeting in the living room of the Burrow. Muffled arguing in the next room made her anxious. A deep, rage filled voice and a higher pitched, calmer one that sang softly through the walls and into her ears as she tried to focus on anything but the voices. Harry and Ron were sitting with her, or across from her rather, Harry looking anywhere but her, and Ron, glaring intensely.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Are either of you going to say something?” She asked finally, unable to take the deathly silence any longer. “You’re just…sitting there!” Harry flinched slightly as Ron huffed and looked away. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I s’pose,” Harry started as he scratched the back of his head and sighed. “We don’t really know what to say, ‘Mione. This is, a bit of a shock.” </em>
</p><p><em> “ </em> <b> <em>A bit of a shock</em> </b> <em> ?” Ron mocked as he flung forward and slammed his hands down onto his knees. “I think that’s a bit of an understatement, mate.” He turned and his pale blue eyes were a murky grey as they narrowed on Hermione’s form. “Are you pleased with yaself?”  </em></p><p>
  <em> Hermione flinched slightly at the bite in her friend’s tone and ducked her head slightly. She’d seen Ron upset before, but this was different. Here she was, only seventeen and ruining someone’s life, or several people’s lives. Harry moved and put a steadying hand on Ron’s shoulder before the red head stood violently and walked away, pacing slowly.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “We’re just confused, Hermione.” Harry said gently as he looked at her with an apologetic smile. “I mean, a few months ago, Bill and Fleur were the happiest couple I’d ever seen, and you…you were still-” His emerald eyes glanced at the pacing form of Ron before he adjusted his glasses and sighed. “We are just trying to get a handle on things.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “So am I, Harry.” The brunette answered as she combed her fingers through her wavy locks. “I…I didn’t plan this. It just…it just happened.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Just happened?!” Ron intervened again as he stalked towards her, his face red with fury. “You are ruining my brother’s life!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Easy,” The bespectacled teen warned as he stood and grabbed Ron by the arm and the red head shrugged him off. “It’s not her fault, Ron.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “She’s a homewrecker!” The red head fumed as he took a step towards the seated brunette and she flinched under his radiating anger before she shut her eyes. “She’s just a lying bitch!”  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ron didn’t see, nor did anyone for that matter, but they heard the resounding slap that silenced the room and Hermione was staring up at the blonde in front of her. Ron was gob smacked as his hand went up to hold the burning skin of his left cheek. Harry was staring as Bill stood behind Fleur with his hand massaging his forehead. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “If you ever,” Fleur seethed as she took a step forward and Ron back tracked. “Speak to her in that tone of voice again, I will curse you into next year, Ronald Weasley.” Her blue eyes were narrowed and tinged with gold flecks as Ron swallowed hard. “Is that clear?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ron just nodded slowly as Fleur turned and crouched in front of Hermione, her eyes softened, but gold still glittered faintly in her irises. Her hand reached out and gently smoothed down Hermione’s hair before ghosting over her cheek. The brunette calmed immediately at her touch and released a heavy sigh before closing her eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Are you all right, mon ange?” Fleur whispered and Hermione nodded before opening her eyes, offering a small smile. “Do not let him get to you, Hermione. This was inevitable, neither of us had control over it.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I know, I know.” Hermione nodded again and looked into Fleur’s soothing gaze. “It’s just…it’s hard when I’m ruining a relationship.” Fleur had explained the bonding several times now in the past four months. How she had no control over it and that it was sporadic. Her feelings might not have manifested until Hermione was mature or ready to be with Fleur.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I am sorry, mon coeur.” The part-Veela sighed as she leaned forward to gently rested her forehead against the shorter woman’s. “It will get easier with time. I promise.” Fleur moved forward to gently embrace her with a contented sigh. “I will never let you go, Hermione.” </em>
</p><p align="center">x--x</p><p>“And if she dies from her injuries?” The brunette’s voice was broken slightly as she tried to hold back the rage that was building in her body. “You won’t help her, even then?” Arthur paused slightly before continuing to walk towards the other Aurors. </p><p>Robards, and another woman, moved forward, past Hermione towards the supine form of Fleur Delacour. Hermione stood frozen, still watching Arthur Weasley disappear into the black void of the forest with the three other figures, before whipping around when she heard a sharp hiss ring into the night air. The Aurors had grabbed Fleur underneath her arms and yanked her to her feet.</p><p>“You’re hurting her!” She argued as she summoned her wand and moved towards the blonde. “Please, let me heal her more serious injuries, she’ll be no use to you if she can’t testify against others.”</p><p>“Stand back, Miss Granger.” Robards growled as he glared down at her, a large gash marring his left cheek. “She’ll be put in the dungeons for now and she’ll be dealt with then this all over.” Fleur grunted in pain as the woman jerked her, coaxing her to move forward when she could barely move at all. </p><p>“Then let me take her.” Hermione pleaded as she followed the Aurors. “Please, I know her, I can-”</p><p>“We know <em> exactly </em>how well you know Miss Delacour, Miss Granger.” Robards cast her a nasty glare over his shoulder and scowled. “You will not be allowed to be near this…woman, while she is in custody, is that understood? Or we will suspect you of treason as well.”</p><p>Hermione froze at the threat and halted as she watched the two drag Fleur towards the tree line. The sun was barely starting to light the sky a light lavender. If there hadn’t been a battle in progress, Hermione would’ve found the sight quite beautiful. If only.</p><p>“Stop.” She said firmly as she stalked after the figures and clenched her wand in her fist. “Please, I’m asking you to stop.” Robards sighed as she dropped Fleur roughly and her body jerked from still being held on her one side. </p><p>“I’ve had about enough of your arguments, Miss Granger.” He said as she turned towards her. This time Hermione didn’t hesitate as she raised her wand and spoke the stunning spell. The female Auror dropped Fleur to grasp for her own wand, a mistake that would lead to the same fate as Fleur stood fully and wrapped her arm around the woman’s neck until she passed out.</p><p>“You could move all this time?” Hermione asked as she looked at Fleur who wiped the blood from her mouth and glanced up at the brunette. “What? Were you just going to let them lock you up in the castle then?”</p><p>“I was planning on killing them once I got out of your sight.” Fleur answered with a small shrug as she silently summoned her wand and sighed heavily before holstering it on her forearm. She glanced at Hermione again who had one eyebrow raised and her hands on her hips in a chastising expression. “Really, Hermione, you didn’t expect me to actually go with them?”</p><p>“I expected you to at least stun, not kill.” The Gryffindor countered while folding her arms over her chest. </p><p>“I didn’t kill her, did I?” The Veela motioned to the unconscious woman on the ground and then back to Hermione, a small smile creeping onto her lips.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re just so adorable when you pout.” She mused as Hermione, if possible, pouted even more and furrowed her brow before turning her back to the blonde and stalking off in the opposite direction the Aurors and Arthur had appeared. “Where are you going, mon ange?” </p><p>“Somewhere you’ll be safe from either side until this battle is over.” The brunette answered as she breached the tree line and headed deeper into the forest. “You need to keep your head low for a while.”</p><p>“Says the girl who’s protecting a known Death Eater.” Hermione spun at Fleur’s words and the Veela almost ran into her before she was met with a withering glare. </p><p>“I’m protecting my mate.” Hermione growled as she looked into sapphire eyes that softened with a nod from Fleur. “I don’t know why you betrayed us, Fleur, and honestly, I’m not sure I want to know.” The younger witch turned and began walking again. “But as long as you’re still…as long as you’re still my Fleur, my mate. I’m not going to let anything happen to you.” </p>
