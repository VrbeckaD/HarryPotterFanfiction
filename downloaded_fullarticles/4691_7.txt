<hr/><p class="m_-6429691454287411433p2">he's still stupid. he teases you for the freckles across your nose and he makes your ball your fists in frustration. being thirteen with knobbly knees and hormones doesn't look very good on either of you. sev is always strange and jealous he's around. you try not to think about it. maybe they'll both know better when you're all older.<span class="m_-6429691454287411433Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<hr/><p class="m_-6429691454287411433p2">they're both stupid. sev stupid to think he could own you, and so was potter. you are not something to be owned. you're fifteen, for gods sake. you tell Marlene and Mary this in the dorm that night, as they hold your hand while you cry for that lost friendship and that dumb boy. they let you sit with them with your damp ginger hair and you know they've got you. and you can't help but think, maybe we'll be better when we're older.<span class="m_-6429691454287411433Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

James you're an idiot, you'll tell him through laughs. you hope he knows what you really mean. you know deep down he does. when he looks at you with that big dumb grin, it makes you terrified, because seventeen is too young to be in love like this, to be in war like this one. you can't do either right now, really, even though you know you will do both anyway. but maybe you'll know better when you're older.<span class="m_-6429691454287411433Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

James has got you, and it's dumb, but you know he has. he and hi<span class="m_-6429691454287411433s1">s dumb friends make you laugh and the ache in the throat goes away and you begin to think it will be okay. maybe you'll be happier when you're older.<span class="m_-6429691454287411433Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
