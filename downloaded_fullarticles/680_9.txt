    <p>As Harry pushed open the bathroom door with Ron behind him, they were both pulled up short when Moaning Myrtle stopped them before they could fully enter. Holding a finger to her lips and beckoning to them with her other hand for them to follow, they went back out into the corridor.</p><p> </p><p>"Myrtle, what's going on?" Harry asked, glancing back at the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>"It's Hermione", Myrtle replied. "She told me not to let you in".</p><p> </p><p>"What, why?" Asked Harry, getting worried for his friend.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean 'why'?" Asked Ron, huffing in annoyance. "If she doesn't want us to go in then lets just go, I'm shattered. She's probably just on the toilet".</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing, when did Ron become such  an arse? Shaking his head, he turned back to the floating Myrtle, raising an eyebrow in question.</p><p> </p><p>"She wouldn't let me see, but I think it has something to do with the Polyjuice you all took".</p><p> </p><p>That was it for Harry, afraid that something had happened to Hermione, he rushed past Ron and into the bathroom. Hearing a noise from over by the toilet stalls, Harry ran over, calling Hermione's name and pushing open the doors. Coming to the last one, he paused for a moment, wondering what he would find. Pushing on it so it swung open, he gasped at what he saw. He briefly heard Myrtle snort before stopping herself from out right laughing, however Ron on the other hand did no such thing, he practically fell to the floor as he held his stomach from laughing so hard.</p><p> </p><p>"Merlin", croaked Harry.</p><p> </p><p>He held his arms out as Hermione rushed forward, catching her and pulling her into a comforting hug. Looking down, he could see a large bushy tail poking out from her skirt, while also feeling one of the furry ears that now adorned her head against his cheek.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry 'Mione", he said, rubbing her back and guiding her out of the stall. "I'll take you to Madame Pomfrey, she can sort this out".</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"Oi Fred, George, tell Harry he's being an idiot".</p><p> </p><p>"<em><strong>You're being an idiot Ron</strong></em>". The two identical red heads chorused together, causing Harry to laugh and Ron to shoot them a glare.</p><p> </p><p>"Where you going Harry?" Asked one of the twins, standing from the common room sofa and walking over to stand next to him, while the other twin did the same with Ron.</p><p> </p><p>"To the hospital wing", replied Harry, "Madam Pomfrey said I could stay there with Hermione until she got better", he held up his small bag that had a pair of pyjamas and some toiletries in it.</p><p> </p><p>"That'll be new", said one twin.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah", said the other, "it'll be the first time you'll be in the ward without a broken bone".</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled and shook his head, pushing past the twin he made his way through the portrait hole.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"Miss Granger", called Madam Pomfrey as she entered the hospital wing, a tall blonde woman walking behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Hermione looked up from the game of exploding snap that they were playing on Hermione's bed.</p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay Madam Pomfrey?" Asked Hermione, brushing the creases out of the bed sheets.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course Miss Granger, I would just like you to meet Madam Greengrass", she said, waving toward the blonde woman. "She works at St Mungo's, particularly with people who have had accidents with potions and the such".</p><p> </p><p>Madam Greengrass stepped forward, offering her hand to first Hermione, and then Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"No need to be so formal Poppy", she admonished the older witch. "You may call me Aithne (et-na)".</p><p> </p><p>"It's nice to meet you Aithne, you can call me Hermione if you want. Are you related to Daphne Greengrass?"</p><p> </p><p>"That I am Hermione, she's my sister's daughter".</p><p> </p><p>"What can I do for you?" Hermione asked, looking between Madam Pomfrey and Aithne.</p><p> </p><p>"Well Hermione, I was wondering if you'd allow me to run some tests on you, no ones seen a case like yours in quite a while, and I was hoping to see if we could fix it".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, of course".</p><p> </p><p>Aithne smiled at Hermione before pulling out her wand, stepping up close to Hermione, she begun waving it in intricate patterns up and down Hermione's body. After a few minutes the blonde with stepped back, took a handkerchief out of a pocket and dabbed her sweaty forehead. She'd obviously spent quite a bit of power from just scanning Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, Hermione, I have some good news and bad news. I believe that with the right potions and spells, we can fix most of what has happened, unfortunately I don't believe we can remove your new extremities such as your ears and tail without amputation. If you wish for them to be removed then it will be possible, but it shall be a messy affair".</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Harry shot up in bed when he felt something press against him. Looking down, he gasped in shock at what he saw. Laying at his feet was a completely naked, and entirely fur free Hermione. She was curled around his legs, her hands and feet rubbing up and down his legs, and her head butting lightly against his groin.</p><p> </p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p> </p><p>The cat-girl looked up he could see that the pupils of her eyes had turned to slits like a cat, and looked to be dilated. She let out a low purring noise as she stuck out her tongue and ran it across Harry's throbbing cock through his Pyjama trousers.</p><p> </p><p>He let out a guttural groan as everything hit him at once, the sight of his naked friend, the utterly sexy noises she was making, and her licking his cock. Throwing his head back against his pillow, he released a long moan as his cock jerked and throbbed. He felt as spurt after spurt fired from his dick, soaking his trousers, as well as Hermione sucking and slurping at his groin, trying to get as much of his cream through the barrier.</p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes Hermione let out a contented purr, pulled herself up Harry, and laid her head on his chest while her arms and legs wrapped around him. Harry passed out a few minutes later as he listened to the deep breathing of his best friend.</p>
