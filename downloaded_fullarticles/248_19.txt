    <p><b> September, 1974 </b> </p><p align="justify"> <br/>The Hogwarts Express chugged steadily along the old railway tracks towards Scotland. The thought of beginning a new year at school distracted those aboard from the small shakes and screeching noises the steam train made as it headed up north. The train was full of mixed emotions this morning. Nervous first years explored the carriages in hope of finding an empty compartment to hide in, or perhaps a welcoming face to sit with. Returning students roamed cockily up and down the aisles, sharing summer tales and treats from the trolley with their friends. </p><p align="justify">A group of hugging students blocked the door to the last carriage. You pushed through the group of Hufflepuffs and yelled a loud and fairly insincere apology back towards them when their scornful murmurs reached your ears. The last compartment in the last carriage was where Lily Evans sat. </p><p align="justify">You remembered meeting Lily in this very compartment four years ago. You had just come from the trolley. You sat down and opened a chocolate frog which had jumped straight onto Lily's knee. She had screamed and tried to get the frog off her whilst you shot around the carriage trying to catch it. After you had caught it and stuffed it into your mouth you had apologised. You knew Lily’s reaction to the chocolate frog hadn’t been an, erm, <em>normal</em> one and the bewildered look on her face made you ask if she’d ever had a chocolate frog before. Quietly, she had told you she was muggle-born. You couldn't have cared less and turned out your pockets to show her all the different magical sweets. You could still envision Lily's face when you told her about acid pops. During this time you only vaguely remembered Severus Snape sitting and glaring at you as Lily and yourself chatted.  </p><p align="justify">Then, ten minutes later your family friend James Potter came looking for you. He had tried to show off in front of Lily by demonstrating a new shoe-lace tying spell on you. The only problem was that James had tied the opposite laces of your shoes together, preventing you from walking. You had drawn your wand and begun loudly arguing when Sirius Black burst in and opened a tin of sugared butterfly wings. The butterflies had swarmed the tiny compartment, flying towards the glass window to seek freedom. You had tried to run to the door but fallen straight onto your face, forgetting that your shoe laces were tied together. James and Sirius almost wet themselves laughing at you. Unfortunately, the startled butterflies and prankster boys had really gotten on Lily's wick. She and Snape got up and moved to a different carriage, leaving you to deal with James and Sirius.  </p><p align="justify">It had been a rather bad first impression but despite that eventful first train ride you had easily become friends with Lily, and not only because you weren’t afraid to tell James Potter to piss off.  </p><p align="justify">When you entered the train compartment this morning four years to the day you weren't surprised to see Snape sitting inside with Lily.  </p><p align="justify">You closed the door behind you and gave your friend a huge smile. Lily hadn't grown much over the summer. You noticed she was still a few inches shorter than yourself when she stood up to hug you. Her long dark red hair was tied back into a messy ponytail and she had already changed into her maroon school robes. </p><p align="justify">You shifted your gaze from your friend to the boy sitting in the corner of the carriage with shoulder length black hair. Judging from the way he was looking at you Snape was utterly displeased by your presence. Unscathed, you greeted him as well. Not only did he not return your greeting but he diverted his eyes back to the window and avoided your forced smile. You had never pretended to be friends with Snape, but at least you could say you had never been rude to him either. Which was worth noting seeing as you hung out with a group of guys who definitely had it out for this particular Slytherin. </p><p align="justify">The compartment door slid open before anyone could say anything and you turned to look at the newcomer. It was Nala, another fourth year Gryffindor who shared the same dormitory as you. Nala was tall and slender with black hair, dark skin, and a fabulous smile. </p><p align="justify">She gave you a hard and friendly clap on the shoulder. “It’s bloody chaos out there,” she said. Unlike you, Nala sat herself down straight away and ignored Snape. “First years everywhere and Alice has already gone and lost her pet toad…” </p><p align="justify">“Every year! She needs to keep the damn thing in a cage before it ends up in a jar in Slughorn's storage cupboard." Nala gave a snort of laughter at your joke. She opened a packet jelly slugs and crammed two into her mouth. </p><p align="justify">Lily grimaced and sat back down. “Poor Alice. She doesn't have a lot of luck with her pets. Here, come sit down,” she suggested, gesturing at yourself. </p><p align="justify">Lily and Snape were sitting next to each other on one seat and Nala had sat down opposite Lily. The only free seat was opposite the moody Slytherin who was still deliberately staring out the window, uninterested in the conversation and company. You squeezed past your friend's knees to sit down across from Snape. </p><p align="justify">“I can't believe we’re supposed to start preparing for our O.W.L's this year. It’s going to be murder finishing my homework once Quidditch starts back up," Nala said with a moan of despair. She lounged out on her seat, propping her feet up in between Snape and Lily. Snape gave her knackered pair of boots a distasteful look and budged over closer to the window. </p><p align="justify">Nala was not the academic sort and spent most of her time with the Quidditch team. Her shoes were always caked in mud and you could bet by October she would have permanent grass stains on her robes. Although you didn't play Quidditch you sympathized with Nala because you didn’t like homework either. You certainly weren’t as studious as Lily, who had never forgotten to turn in an assignment or wagged class.  </p><p align="justify">“Years of misery for a measly two-week examination period at the end of next year,” you contributed to the conversation. “It’s so dull, memorising all same old spells.” </p><p align="justify">Snape's face remained positioned to stare outside but he gave you a side wards glance, his eyes studying your face briefly. He probably thought you were stupid, and you thought he might actually tell you so. After a couple of moments passed without a word spoken you decided that he wasn't going to say anything after all. </p><p align="justify">“What’re you thinking?” Nala asked you with a wicked grin on her face. “Charming a quill to remember all the answers for you?”  </p><p align="justify">“Don't be daft; they have anti-cheating quills that we all have to use," Lily retorted. </p><p align="justify">"Ok what about this - I could create a new disease. Makes you ill right before your exam. Maybe you end up in the Hospital Wing for a week so you miss out on the exam?”  </p><p align="justify">Lily rolled her eyes, unimpressed by your quickly thought up idea.</p><p align="justify">“No, it’d be completely painless for the most part. You could only do it once though, ya know. Otherwise Dumbledore would get suspicious if you kept getting sick right before finals.” </p><p align="justify">“You guys are idiots,” Lily said in jest. She looked at Nala. “If you spent less time on the Quidditch pitch and if <em>you </em>spent less time hanging out with Potter and Black you’d probably achieve better grades," she continued, giving you a pointed look. "You know the amount of time you spend with those idiots makes me wonder why you haven’t already been sent to the Hospital Wing to get your head inspected.”  </p><p align="justify">At her comment the corner of Snape's lips turned upwards. </p><p align="justify">As a Gryffindor your tactic was to be friendly to everyone, unless they gave you reason not to be. If someone had deliberately done something bad to you then they were fair game. Your friendship with Sirius Black, James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew really just reflected the similarities you shared with them. These similarities were mainly a knack of breaking the rules and playing pranks. You got a thrill out of roaming around Hogwarts after curfew trying to find secret passage ways and shortcuts around the school. You also loved plotting revenge when it was rightfully owed.</p><p align="justify">You sat up in your seat, ready to reason with Lily. “They’re not that bad. You're forgetting James topped Transfiguration last year as well.” You got the feeling that the subject of James was a touchy subject for both Lily and Snape.  </p><p align="justify">No matter how well James performed in class Lily thought he was a stupid show off. Of course, James’s arrogance didn't particularly win him any favours either. He had yet to learn when to be humble. James had also seemed to have it out for Snape, who happened to be Lily's friend, since they first met. At a glance it seemed as though it was all down to House Rivalry but you had an inkling there was more to it than that.  Sirius and James loved to pick on Snape, and Snape was always quick to return the insults and hexes right back at them. The fact that they could always get a rise out of Snape made it all the more fun for them.  </p><p align="justify">One would assume that Snape was probably jealous of James and Sirius because they were very popular and gifted with great social skills and good looks, as well as being talented with spells. That assumption made; you hadn’t ever asked anyone when this rivalry started. Snape never spoke a word in class unless called upon and spent most of his time reading alone or talking to Lily under his breath.</p><p align="justify">Sensing that all the Potter talk had created tension you stood up and grabbed Nala's hand to pull her along with you. You graciously excused the two of you before James or Sirius came in looking for you and caused trouble. As you turned to tell Lily you’d see her at dinner you noticed Snape was looking at you with relief, clearly glad that he was granted alone time with Lily again. </p><p align="center">---- ~ * ~ ---- </p><p align="justify">Due to amount of time you spent catching up with the lads in the Gryffindor common room it was later than usual when you finally made it upstairs to the girl’s dormitory. Lily, Nala, and Alice were sitting cross legged on Nala’s bed flicking through a couple of muggle magazines Lily had brought. Some of the other girls had drawn the curtains around their beds already, suggesting that they had called it a night. </p><p align="justify">As you unpacked your suitcase to look for your pajamas Nala came over to say goodnight. Nala had been a close friend of yours since first year. You knew you were going to get along with Nala because she was very outgoing and loved to joke around. The minute you saw her hex a cocky first year Sirius Black for purposely knocking pumpkin juice on her skirt you knew you were going to be friends. </p><p align="justify">After Nala had gone to bed you went over to see Lily. You watched her put frames that held eerie motionless pictures of her family on her bedside table. When she had first shown you a picture of her sister Petunia you had laughed. They looked completely different! Petunia had blonde hair and blue eyes, whereas Lily had red hair and green eyes. The only thing they had in common were their smiles. From what Lily told you about Petunia she didn't sound like the type of person you'd be friends with. You felt bad for her because you had always desperately wanted a sibling, and Lily had one but didn’t get along with her. </p><p align="justify">You interrupted Lily's decorating with a question. “Hey, Lil. This morning on the train..." You fidgeted with your pajama button before asking the question you wanted to. "Did I intrude on your conversation with Snape?" </p><p align="justify">Lily placed a vase of flowers down and turned to look at you. "Not at all. You know that's how Sev is. He's always been like that. It'd do him good, actually, to speak to more people." Lily always had some reason to defend Snape. They had been friends long before Hogwarts. "I've been thinking. If you spent a bit more time with Sev then maybe that'd do him some good. And," she added quickly, "If you're friends with him too then maybe Potter and Black would leave him alone." </p><p align="justify">Lily knew you felt bad that Snape got picked on.  </p><p align="justify">"If you got to know him then you'd realise he's nothing like Potter!" </p><p align="justify">"I think you're forgetting that<em>  I'm </em> not the one who has an issue with James..." </p><p align="justify">"I know... but Sev is so different, he’s caring, he’s smart, he - " </p><p align="justify">"Ok, ok. It's fine. I mean he can't be that bad, can he? And he's never really done anything to me so…” you trailed off, shrugging your shoulders. </p><p align="justify">Lily looked relieved. You wondered how long this had been on her mind. “Really?" she said. "Come by the Great Lake after class tomorrow and then the three of us can hang out together.” She went to smile, though stopped midway to contemplate her sentence. Her eyes flashed as she had just remembered something. “Although, for Severus’s sake - could you not mention that I asked you to do this? And of course, don't let Potter or Black know either. I would hate for them to - " </p><p align="justify">“Lil, stop! I've got it. It's our secret. I’ll get to know Snivellus- ” You quickly covered your mouth and your eyes bulged. “I mean Severus,” you corrected yourself. You’d have to make sure to get that nickname out of your head before tomorrow afternoon. “It'll be fun," you said to convince yourself. </p><p align="justify">Right now you were a tiny bit motivated by this year's mission: getting to know the icy Severus Snape. On occasion you had wondered why Lily was friends with him and this would be a great way to find out if everything she had been saying about him was true. Besides, everyone knew Snape was clever. Perhaps for the sake of your O.W.Ls you’d gain a potions tutor! </p>
