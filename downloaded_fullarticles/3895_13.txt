This is one of the hundreds of species of Pokémon found till date! This one is a Froakie! It is a Water-type, and one of the twenty-one Pokémon given to new trainers! </p><p>We, humans, share our lives with Pokémon in so many different ways! Some of us battle with them...</p><p>(Goes to a League match)</p><p><b>Referee</b>: Now, begins the title defence match between Lance, the Indigo Champion, and the challenger!</p><p><b>Challenger</b>: Go, Pikachu!</p><p><b>Lance</b>: Go, Dragonite!</p><p><b><b>Challenger</b></b>: Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!</p><p><b>Lance</b>: Dragonite, dodge it, and then use Outrage!</p><p><b>Dragonite</b>: (Screams) (Hits Pikachu)</p><p><b>Commentator</b>: Wow, what a power-packed Outrage!

Some of us, on the other hand, have them as dear friends and play with them, and others work with them!</p><p>However, Pokémon only live in some places. And these places are known as Pokémon regions, and there are 7 of them.</p><p>Firstly, Kanto, east of Japan. Kanto is famous, for its shady Elite Four. Whoever loses, never comes back!</p><p>Then, Johto, the mostly Japanese speaking region just west of Kanto. It is known for its beautiful ships and architechture. How wonderful!</p><p>Hoenn, south of Japan. It houses the Shinkaen School for Trainers in Petalburg City, for Johtonians, Hoennians and Sinnohans. Hoenn has held bitter rivalries with Kanto for over 400 years, even disallowing Kantonians in Shinkaen!</p><p>Then, we have Sinnoh, north of Japan, with its bitter-cold climate and pollution-free air!</p><p>Then there's Unova, near New York in America, the leader in Wizardry and technology. It also is home to the Aspertia School of Magic and Pokémon Training, for Kantonians, Unovans and Kalosians.</p><p>Kalos, the bilingual region just north of France, known as the region of love, and famous for its various beautiful tourist sites and its amazing music! S'il vous plaît indeed!</p><p>Then last but not least, Alola, near Hawaii. It's a unique place with dense forests and big cities! It is home to the Paihua Trainers' Academy, known for its metal badges made of gold, given to the best students.</p><p>These regions are only accessible by Pokémon Trainers, and not to Muggles, normal people who can neither perform magic nor command Pokémon. We trainers ran from Muggles in the 17th Century, due to increasing amounts of hostility towards trainers, leading to witch-hunts and the mass killings of Pokémon.</p><p>Magic, is a supernatural force that emanates from the body of trainers and Pokémon, in waves called aura. Magic can be harnessed by trainers, with wands, and without wands with extreme skill, and by Pokémon in forms of moves.<br/><br/></p><p>Have great fun in a great world!</p>
