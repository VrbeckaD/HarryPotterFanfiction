  <em> October, 1995. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“It's ridiculous!” Hermione slammed her book on the table a moment after Ron moved the plate. “First she changes the entire curriculum, now she cancels the exams?”</p><p>“Bloody hell, ‘Mione,” Ron said, swiping at the table where some of the plate's contents had been thrown. She huffed, plopping onto the bench and opening the book, its stiff spine creaking as she flipped through the pages. Her hair was wild around her, as if she had run her hands through it in her frustration, and even her uniform was in disarray- leaving her to straighten her tie as she scanned the pages. </p><p>Harry and Ron exchanged glances.</p><p>“Did you go to sleep last night?” Harry asked gently. The bags under her eyes were apparent in the sunlit Hall. </p><p>“I was studying!” She snapped. They exchanged another glance- one that she noticed. She looked at them guiltily, fiddling with her robes. “Sorry. I was studying, trying to memorize all these stupid 'Creature Rules’ of hers, and the classifications. . .and then I heard this morning that she canceled the exams. Due to the spellwork portion, she says, because she wants it eliminated.”</p><p>Harry looked up at the teacher's table, where Umbridge was carrying on as usual. It was a cool but cheery day, the ceiling of the Great Hall showing a clear blue and silver sky. Students were hunched over breakfast and books, scribbling on parchment and idly chatting. It was a beautiful day ripe to be ruined with some manner of assignment from Umbridge. Perhaps another 18-inch essay on Ministry Dark Magic regulations. Perhaps a 20-inch on why Voldemort was dead.</p><p>Perched on the edge of her chair like a flighty, pompous, bird- she peered down at them all with that infuriating smile. Umbridge’s frilly pink clothes didn’t help her against the comparison, serving to make her appear even more like some strange and ugly species. Her small, watery, eyes scanned up and down the tables until she reached where the trio was sitting. She locked eyes with him, raising a brow, and Harry glared right back. </p><p>He felt a familiar curl of hate in his gut, wishing for all the world that Dumbledore had the power to kick her out of the school. Hermione had been right- painfully so, really. The Ministry was trying to take over Hogwarts, and Umbridge was their enforcer, determined to do everything in her power to mess up their lives. Hermione was right about another thing; Umbridge was truly the devil incarnate.</p><p>“Harry,” He broke the staring contest, looking to Ron and urging his brain to process the words being thrown at him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Hermione was flipping something between her fingers- a Galleon. “When's the next meeting?”</p><p>He could feel the weight of Umbridge's eyes on him again. Remembering the DA was satisfying. She knew, of course, that something was going on- had gotten bits and pieces of information from her little minions. His personal arch enemy, next to Voldemort of course, had been trailing him quite obviously for days, at the end of every corridor as he went from class to class. But with the help of the map, Malfoy didn't stand a chance. Try as they might to place new restrictions and catch them, no ‘<em> Inquisitorial Squad </em>’ could stop the DA. “Tonight. We’ll have it tonight, after dinner.”</p><p>A smirk curled at Hermione's lips as she drew her wand under the table and tapped the coin, changing the numbers. Harry felt his own grow hot against his thigh. He liked to keep it in his pocket, to hold onto whenever Umbridge was being particularly terrible.</p><p>Ron grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. “Have you planned the lesson yet? I was thinking we work on some Transfiguration. You know, to cause a little trouble.”</p><p>“Trouble?” Hermione laughed, shaking off the remnants of her frustration, “Should we turn kittens into Cornish Pixies? Or the other way around?”</p><p>“Umbridge would love that,” Ron agreed, grinning back at her.</p><p>“I'll write that one down,” Harry said. And not as any sort of joke! They had actually compiled a list of all the distractions they could possibly think of. It had been an entertaining night with the DA, sitting in a circle and jotting down everything from giving Filch Fred and George’s chocolates to enchanting a line of tap-dancing spiders. Ron hadn’t liked that last one though, so they had to switch out spiders for cows. A more noticeable, and therefore more effective distraction anyways.</p><p>“Oh! That reminds me,” Hermione said, tapping the parchment Harry had pulled out. “Harry, I was thinking that we should go through the Room of Requirement for anything the DA could use. I know there are plenty of books in there, and perhaps some enchanted objects or- well. I don’t know. There are a lot of possibilities.”</p><p>“Don’t know?” Ron muttered as he piled more food onto his plate, “That’s a new one.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, giving Harry a <em> ‘can you believe this git? </em>’ look. “So?”</p><p>He turned it over in his head, but it wasn’t a hard decision to make. The Room had been there since Hogwarts was built, who knew what secrets it held, and with Umbridge around, Defense wasn’t the only class getting stricter. All the curriculums had been changed, and less and less magic was being used. Their only weapon was slowly being stripped away, what hope did they have but to train themselves?</p><p>Harry nodded in agreement, and Ron carefully chewed on his toast. “Mm, ‘ve go’a free pe’iod af’er lunch.”</p><p>“It’s settled, then,” Hermione said, blocking Ron from taking another bite.</p><p>“It’s settled,” Harry repeated. He grinned as Ron and Hermione went back and forth, him responding to her every claim with the infamously creative ‘you’re not my mum’ speech. She finally gave up with a heavy sigh, while Ron victoriously waved his butter knife, barely missing the girl next to him.</p><p>“Last time I visited,” she said, snatching the knife from Ron without a glance. “I found a book on defensive magic. Apparently, it’s not circulating anymore, since it was deemed too powerful- especially one particular chapter on Rebound spells.”</p><p>Harry nodded. Having an arsenal of spells no Death Eater had heard of would come in handy. “I’ll take a look at it- but anything we try has to be safe enough for the DA.”</p><p>“Of course.” Her next words were directed pointedly at Ron, who was focused purely on his breakfast. “Maybe I should demonstrate on you?”</p><p>“Wha-” Ron coughed violently, choking on the toast he had been scarfing down.</p><p>“Hey!” Hermione exclaimed, while Harry tried to dodge the flying bits of spittle and bread.</p><p>“Ro-ooon,” Harry groaned. He snatched a napkin from his hapless friend while Hermione pounded him on the back.</p><p>“Haven’t I warned you not to talk with your mouth full?” she chastised, though she had remained out of the line of fire from her seat beside him. Harry glowered at the sticky splotches and occasional bits of mush now decorating the front of his robes, blinking in surprise when they vanished.</p><p>“Thanks,” he mumbled, seeing Hermione’s sympathetic expression as she put her wand away.</p><p>“Anything to say, Ronald?” she said, though her tone had turned light and teasing. Ron grumbled out an apology, but swiftly turned back to stuffing himself full of toast. Hermione let out a sound- an attempt at a scoff that quickly turned into laughter. Harry laughed with her, and for a moment everything was perfect. Sunlight beaming down, Umbridge’s attention off of them, and a little bubble of happiness that hid him from the stares and whispers of the other students. He’d had a rocky start, with the Dementors, expulsion, the trial, then gossip and glares once he came back to Hogwarts. The place that was supposed to be his escape- but it was working out, wasn’t it? Everything was going to be fine.</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p><em> Bang! </em> Harry cursed, flicking his wand frantically in an attempt to douse the flames. It had been so simple, just a few spells to analyze the strange object before he laid hands on it- and it just had to blow up.</p><p>He sighed as the fire finally died down, looking around at the piles upon piles of items in the Room of Requirement. It was quite an assortment- towering stacks of everything from school books and old curtains to desks and entire beds. The room stretched on and on into the distance, until it became nothing but blurs of colors and shadow in his vision. There were a few open surfaces around him- ancient vanities, a scorched trunk, a tipped over wardrobe- that he had cleared off in preparation.</p><p>Hermione and Ron were only supposed to be a few minutes late, running some errand or another for Professor McGonagall, and he had been eager to start on their task the moment he arrived. So, hence the tests and the flames.</p><p>Harry flicked his wand, making a projection of the time appear. “Twenty minutes late, Hermione,” he said in the general direction of the door. His voice echoed, sounding deafening against the crushing silence.</p><p>He sighed, then flinched at the sound. There was a strange pressure or presence or something in the room that day- making him feel like he was leading on a monster. Showing it his location so it could pounce.</p><p><em> “Harry!” </em> A voice cut through the quiet of the room- a musical, airy thing. He whipped around, trying to find the source of the voice. There was nobody else to be seen, and he hadn’t recognized the voice in the first place. Harry held his wand at the ready, scanning the room and never letting giving his back to one area for too long.</p><p>“Who’s there?” he demanded. The wardrobe was laid face-down, so clearly nothing could be inside it, right? None of the vanity drawers could hold a person, although that was to assume the source of the call was even human. Harry glared at it with suspicion before the trunk drew his attention. In some ways, it resembled the trunk that had been used to house a Boggart for DADA class. More than big enough for several people, with a wrought iron padlock on the front and dark metal details.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Who’s there!” The voice had come from behind him, only a few feet away. </p><p>“Over here, Harry,” it beckoned. “Come closer.”</p><p>Harry did an about-face to find the origin. Nothing.</p><p>The object he had been messing with- a structure that looked rather like a giant silver time-turner set into a large wooden frame, was the only thing that stuck out. It was bright against the pile behind it, even through the dust. Rather than words around outside of the rings, there were runes in a thin, twisting script- ones Hermione might recognize but that he didn't.</p><p><em> “Harry. . .” </em>The high, lilting voice called. It was not unfriendly, but admittedly rather eerie- and it had a charm to it, the same pull that he imagined a Siren’s song might have. Dazed, he approached it with measured steps, and now as he drew even closer he could tell that the voice did indeed come from the strange object. It sat on an old chair, the top of it reaching his chest, though even with the golden sand inside along with the metal and wood, it seemed to be lighter than a feather when he had picked it up earlier. Harry stepped closer, slowly, lifting his wand to clear away the dust.</p><p>It reflected the light brilliantly- no, it was glowing- a white, pure light. Harry felt the power radiating from it, pulses of magic leading him until he ran his fingers along its gilded edges. A tingly warmth spread from his hands up through his arm. It danced across his shoulders, and within a few moments he was shining with it.</p><p>“Harry,” the voice said again, and his eyes slipped closed, the darkness swallowing him up. It was peaceful, the voice like a gentle lullaby, and the sway of its magic was calming. An ocean of power slowly pushing and pulling him with the tide, the thrum of an infinity of living creatures around him. He could sense them weaving in and out of each other below him, in the deep depths of the sea. They glided up to meet him, energy slipping around and through him.</p><p>He felt something in his chest; not some big bang, but a contained explosion. A contentedness that filled him with warmth. And he was floating. Floating on the water, floating into the sky, floating higher and higher until he reached the gleaming silver moon and saw it’s glow against the back of his eyelids. “Harry, wake up.”</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>The first thing he noticed was the cold. There was a hard stone floor beneath him, and a chill in the air. His head was pillowed on his bag, and something wet was sliding through his hair and down his neck.</p><p>Harry jolted, sitting up and snapping open his eyes, seeing the corridor spin before him. He blinked rapidly, trying to think back. Trying to think at all. Hadn’t he been in the Room of Requirement? He remembered the moon- something about the moon. He looked around, seeing torches down the wall and the painting with the dancing trolls. Ridiculous as ever.</p><p>“Hello?” He called, to no response, rubbing the back of his head. His hand came away covered in ink, and a quick examination of his bag, paired with the fact that his legs were aching, made him conclude that he had landed hard. The ink bottle in his bag had shattered, soaking his books and parchment in the dark, slick liquid.</p><p>Sighing, he closed his bag again and scooped it off the ground, wiping black fluid over the red flaps of his robe. At least the hallway was empty, or else he’d have to answer questions- and he was definitely not ready for that. He put a hand back up to his head, forcing himself to his feet. A wave of dizziness hit him, accompanied by a pulsing pressure like his brain was pushing up against his skull. Harry groaned, stumbling to the wall and pressing his forehead to the cool, soothing stone, releasing the strap of his bag and ignoring the crunch of glass.</p><p>Time to regroup. He had been in the Room of Requirement. Ron and Hermione were on their way in just a few minutes. He had been casting simple, harmless, spells. There had been no one else in the room with him. There had been a voice, and a pull, and clearly he had gone unconscious at some point, and perhaps someone dragged him out of the Room? But for what reason? And where were they now? And how long had it been?</p><p>Harry searched for his wand, quickly finding it inside his robe pocket. Funny, he didn’t remember putting it there, and whoever moved him didn’t just steal it. Harry drew his wand carefully, comforted by the familiar holly. He cast a quick spell, projecting a little image of the time- 5:32 pm. Almost dinner, far past when someone should’ve come after him. His head spun with the oddness of it.</p><p>“<em>Scourgify, </em> ” he whispered, remembering the cleaning spell. “<em>Reparo. </em>” The ink bottle pulled itself back together as he resolved to go back into the Room. Bracing himself for a possible attack, wand clutched tight, he stalked back and forth in front of the wall. Sections of stone pushed away and darkened until the spiraling design appeared, the door swinging open before him. Harry took a measured step forwards with a white-knuckled grip on his only weapon and a humming anticipation in his very bones. </p><p>Only, there was no one in the cavernous room. Just the same piles of items, and a heavy blanket of silence. Of course, Hermione had taught him better than to just let it go at that. Harry scanned the room with several sensing charms. For people, for creatures, for any living presence- but there was nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>His stomach flipped, unsettled, and his attention was drawn to an object laying on its side at the foot of a rickety table. It gleamed, a blink of light like a wink, looking exactly as it had a few minutes ago- although he knew that wasn’t where he left it. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, switching tracks and striding right back out again. He really didn’t want to have another thing to worry about right now.</p><p>It was almost dinner, and that sounded like a fantastic idea at the moment. Food to quell the twist in his gut and two people to help him figure out whatever the hell just happened.</p><p>The room shut itself quietly, dissolving into the wall behind him as if it had never been there at all, and Harry began his trek to the Great Hall. He let his mind wander, wanting to think about something that didn’t confuse him and make him so. . .unnerved. It wasn’t a foreign feeling, but that didn’t make it any more pleasant.</p><p>A flash of a shy smile and a blue scarf came to mind. Warm, intelligent eyes. And then, a flash of yellow and black. He had liked Cedric, perhaps a little more than he should’ve for someone that had technically been competing against him. But who could blame him? The Hufflepuff was kind and helpful on top of being handsome- which is why it had hurt doubly so when he found out Cedric and Cho were going to the Yule Ball together. And his honest smiles, the little mischievous spark in his eye as he told Harry about the egg, how fair he insisted on being in every single situation. Those all made his death worse. Green flashed across the backs of his eyelids, and Harry knew that his nightmares were going to be making their return that night.</p><p>“You alright, mate?” Harry flinched, only retracting into himself more when he saw the little badger on the boy’s robes. He had managed to miss the fact that three other students were in the hall with him- the Hufflepuff boy with honeyed hair looking at him, concerned, and two Ravenclaw students just behind him. He nodded quickly, ducking his head when the boy put a hand on his shoulder. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry choked out, “Just fine.” His heart tugged a little, the faces of a stranger and a friend blurring together- and even through that image, all he could see was Cedric’s glassy eyes.</p><p>“I’m Avior,” he said softly, and nudged the pair behind him. Harry did his best to paste a smile on his face, taking comfort in the weight of the coin in his pocket and the wand pressing into his ribs.</p><p>“Blair,” one of the Ravenclaws, a girl with curly black hair, introduced shortly. She turned her attention back to Avior, elbowing him back. “Dinner’s starting soon, and I don’t fancy my seat getting stolen by bloody <em> Barbara </em>again.”</p><p>Avior laughed abruptly, and Harry had to stop himself from flinching. “We don’t have assigned seats!”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what Barb-dear says,” Blair snapped, though her eyes were dancing. “Everyone knows that’s where I sit.”</p><p>“Not at lunch!” protested their last member, a red-haired girl. She grinned when Blair whipped around with raised brows.</p><p>“Must you both insist on playing Devil’s advocate?” She mock-glared at Avior. “It’s all your fault, anyways.”</p><p>“For doing what?” he spluttered, and Harry enjoyed a few more moments of temporary relief while their attention was off of him. He scrubbed his eyes harshly, trying to wipe away any trace of tears.</p><p>“She thinks she’s impressing you! Showing how so very strong and assertive she is so the meek little Hufflepuff will be swept off his feet.”</p><p>“Lies!”</p><p>Harry shuffled his feet as they went back and forth, considering making an awkward turnaround. The curly-haired Ravenclaw was gesturing for them to get a move on, and Avior obliged, shooting an apologetic smile at Harry. His heart tugged again. “Want to walk with us? We were just talking about- don’t even say it, Blair- last week’s Quidditch game. Gryffindor versus Slytherin- and the Slytherins lost! I swear, their team was better in ‘39, and that was when Goyle led the team.” The boy rambled cheerfully, clearly trying to distract Harry from the tears stinging at the corners of his eyes.</p><p>“They were still better in ‘37,” Blair cut in, giggling.</p><p>“You mean during the dragon incident?”</p><p>“I meant the Great Goat Event, but that too. Blimey, that was a weird year,” Harry felt like he was missing out on something as the trio burst into laughter.</p><p>“And to be my first experience with Quidditch,” Avior sighed, “I had such high expectations after that.” There was no conclusion Harry could draw from the conversation, lost in what must’ve been a multitude of inside jokes. What else could explain it? Unless Charlie shown up in the middle of a match while he was chasing the Snitch. And goats? Well no, since they were referencing an event in 1937, an odd bit of information to know, even for Ravenclaws. And then Avior had said. . .</p><p>Harry settled on the easiest piece of the puzzle to identify. “Did you say Gryffindor? I don’t remember that.”</p><p>“The whole school was talking about it,” Blair replied dubiously. Harry’s eyes darted between the trio, seeing nothing out of sorts. They weren’t joking.</p><p>“I didn’t know.”</p><p>The other Ravenclaw was staring at him curiously, even as she shoved pieces of parchment into the cauldron on her arm, trying to stop the overflow. “You must have missed it,” she piped up. “It happens. Unless you’ve got friends obsessed with the stupid sport, of course.”</p><p>Harry shook his head while Blair punched her arm. “I couldn’t have.” Draco would’ve teased him endlessly if he had, not to mention what his own Housemates would say.</p><p>Avior shrugged, trying to laugh it off and continue their trek. “You wouldn’t believe what’s possible. I once missed all of my classes because I thought it was a Saturday,”</p><p>“Despite us talking about Merrythought at breakfast that very morning,” The curly-haired Ravenclaw sing-songed. Blair hooked his arm playfully, and they swayed back and forth for a few steps, almost bowling over their third member. The girl huffed dramatically and leisurely caught a textbook that tipped out of her cauldron.</p><p>“Merrythought?” Harry asked, feeling dumber by the second. The pair paused, looking back at him. Was that some sort of potion ingredient?</p><p>“The Defense professor?” She said tenderly, her expression softening. Harry had a double-take looking at her. Wild, curly hair tumbling past her shoulders, mahogany skin, and eyes of pooling ink. She looked to be in his year, or somewhere near it- but he didn’t recognize her, neither had he heard the name Blair around school. And then there was the matter of the other Ravenclaw, with her memorable carrot hair. She looked like a Weasley- with pale skin, a long nose, and freckles sprinkled over her face- but she couldn't be. She wasn’t anyone he’d seen before.</p><p>They didn’t seem to recognize him in return- and everyone had been acting rather shifty around him just that morning. Nobody would talk to him, much less ask him how he was feeling or invite him to go to dinner with them. There might be plenty of students at Hogwarts, but he had seen everyone’s face before, even if he hadn’t befriended them.</p><p>He remembered the giant silver hourglass, and the voice that had called to him. Before, it had been like peering through murky water, trying to see a line of pictures on a riverbed. Knowing they were there but unable to reach them or make out the fine details. The water cleared now, and he remembered hearing his name being called, the ocean swaying beneath him. The hourglass had reminded him of a Time-Turner, after all. “Excuse me,” he said quietly. He took a breath to steady himself, to no avail. “What year is it?”</p><p>The Hufflepuff narrowed his eyes, as honey-colored as his hair, and examined Harry again. “Did you knock your head? It’s 1941.”</p><p>Harry snorted, trying to look amused. “Of course it is.” He looked between the three friends, who had all stopped their banter and were exchanging glances. His feet stuck to the floor, heart hammering to a stop. “Are you serious?” His disbelieving laugh was high and airy.</p><p>“Maybe you should go to the Infirmary,” Avior was saying, but the words seemed warped. Far away and filtered, and Harry was sinking, sinking, sinking. The ocean was rising to take him again, to carry him far away. Harry felt a steadying hand on his arm, urging him back down the corridor.</p><p>“No!” Harry jerked his arm out of the boy’s grip, stumbling back. “No. I’m fine. I’ve just- sorry, I’ve got to- I’ve got- things,”</p><p>“Things. . .” Avior repeated.</p><p>“Upstairs.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Avior approached slowly, hands raised as if he was trying to calm a wild animal. Behind him, the girls were unsure, edging away from the situation.</p><p>“I left a textbook,” Harry stepped back every time Avior stepped forwards. “Excuse me,” Harry spun on his heel and whisked away down the hall as the boy made a leap for him, running before any of them had the chance to grab him again.</p><p>“Hey, wait!” They weren’t joking. It was 1941. “Come back!”</p><p>WWII-era. Whatever had happened in the Room of Requirement had sent him back in time. “Lion-boy!” The designs, the words, the stars. Maybe it had been a prototype of some sort.</p><p>“We’re getting Madam Bliant!”</p><p>“Sorry!” Harry shouted behind him, stealing one last glance behind him as he rounded the corner. The Hufflepuff was staring after him, eyes wide, while Blair held him back.</p><p> </p>
