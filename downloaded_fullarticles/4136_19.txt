    <p>Harry dashed up the stairs of the Burrow and climbed the ladder to the attic, closely followed by Ron and Ginny-- they were the only three home, other than Mrs. Weasley, whose scream they’d just heard.</p><p>Harry froze. Someone was lying on the floor in front of her! Wait. No, it wasn’t a person-- and it was changing. To look like different people-- namely, her family. Mrs. Weasley was crying on her knees while this occurred…</p><p>“Harry, get off the ladder!” Ron called from behind him. “What’s going on? Is she okay?”</p><p>“It’s a boggart,” Harry told him, entering the attic, with the other two following. “It’s changing to each of us, but dead.”</p><p>Ginny ran over, placing her hand on her mother’s shoulder. “Mom, it’s okay, just a boggart…”</p><p>But Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t stop sobbing. The boggart had changed to Ginny, then Draco, then Fred, then Ron, then Hermione… </p><p>“Hold on, I’ll take care of it, mine’s just a dementor, and I had plenty of practice against it when Lupin taught me how to make a patronus.” Harry moved in front of Mrs. Weasley just as the boggart had changed to himself.</p><p>But the boggart didn’t turn into a dementor. Instead of changing, it stood up, still in the form of Harry. No, wait, it had changed-- to a vampire. It stared at Harry with hungry cat-like eyes tinged with red.The expression in the eyes was dreadful: cold, deadly, hungry, not an ounce of humanity in there. Blood dripped from the mouth as it grinned mockingly, baring sharp fangs. Clearly, it had just eaten… no, in the process of eating. Harry watched in horror as the figure knelt down, driving the fangs into the neck of a mangled figure that clearly was human, although the features were fuzzy-- after all, the fear wasn’t that he’d feed on a specific human, just a human in general. Harry found he couldn’t move.</p><p>Someone pushed Harry aside, and the boggart changed into a book, which was dispelled easily by Ginny. </p><p>“You okay, mate?” Ron asked, from beside Harry.</p><p>Harry looked at his friend with panicked eyes, then turned to Mrs. Weasley, who was looking at Harry with a wide-eyed expression of shock. Harry made a strangled mewling noise and popped into his animagus form-- a scrawny yet fluffy black cat with a streak of brown on the forehead. He tumbled painfully down the ladder, dashing away to find a place to hide.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>“Here, kitty, kitty!”</p><p>“Seriously, Malfoy? You honestly think he’ll react to that?”</p><p>“Actually, Ron, considering he’s probably overcome by the cat’s mind right now, yes.”</p><p>“Oh, so that’s the only reason, huh? You don’t call him that in the bedroom, too?”</p><p>“Nah, Ginny, he probably calls him ‘kitten’ in the bedroom, like he does out of it sometimes.”</p><p>“Aww, that’s so cute!”</p><p>“S-shut up, both of you!”</p><p>“You’re sure he’s in this room?”</p><p>“Yes, I can smell him…”</p><p>“Maybe we should start moving things around; this room is full of stuff.”</p><p>“No! Fred and George store rejected joke shop things in here; for all we know, haphazardly moving things could blow up the room!”</p><p>“But calling isn’t working… Maybe if we get some cat treats?”</p><p>“I’m going cat.”</p><p>Harry listened to the voices from behind the protection of multiple boxes stuffed under a bed. He had forgotten why he had decided to hide there in the first place, but it was cozy, so he decided to stay there for a bit longer. He didn’t know why, but he didn’t want to deal with humans at the moment. His tail flicked in front of his face… oh, no! There was some dust on it! Harry lowered his face to it and began licking.</p><p>“Mew?” Harry looked up to see a pure-white shorthair kitten. He sniffed. Friend! Harry began to purr. </p><p>The friend-cat batted him on the nose and then hopped backwards. Oh, so that’s how it was, huh? Harry batted back, and the other cat moved behind a box. Oh, the game was on! Harry darted forwards, then got caught in a bit of weird fleshy string hanging out of a box. He struggled, but couldn't escape! The friend-cat returned, trying to help him pull the string off, but biting wasn’t working, nor were claws! Then the friend-cat disappeared… Harry stopped struggling. Had friend-cat abandoned him? Harry mewed in resignation as the voices began again.</p><p>“He’s tangled in some weird string thing, and I couldn’t get him out.”</p><p>“Okay, but we need to be careful about the boxes…”</p><p>BOOM. Harry yowled in surprise.</p><p>“That was not being careful! I told you they could explode!”</p><p>“Okay, okay! I didn’t know you were that serious!”</p><p>Harry shook as things around him were moved. Then, his box began to, as well! Harry yowled in surprise as he slid across the floor with the box.</p><p>“Careful! He’s attached to the box!”</p><p>“Ron, if you hurt my boyfriend, I swear--”</p><p>“I know, I know! Sheesh, Draco, you are way too overprotective! Look, he’s fine… let’s get you untangled…”</p><p>Harry mewed in thanks as the things wrapping around him were removed, then made to go back under the bed.</p><p>“Oh, no, you don’t!” Harry was lifted up by the scrunch of his neck, and then found himself looking into beautiful ice-blue eyes. “Harry James Potter, you will turn back to a vampire right now!”</p><p>Harry mewed at the silly vampire. He was a cat! Harry wondered where friend-cat had gone; the vampire’s eyes reminded him of… oh. </p><p>“Harry. I know you can understand what I’m saying, cat-mind or not. You are a vampire. Remember, and TURN BACK.” Those last few words had a strange compulsion attached; Harry decided he should follow that.</p><p>Harry looked around the room. It was Fred and George’s old one, full of boxes-- one which was burned, and another with a pile of extendable ears spilling out. Draco, Ginny, and Ron were circled around him… the memories of why he had hidden in his cat form stirred. Harry let out a strangled cat-like cry and leapt forwards to clutch Draco, who in turn wrapped his arms tightly around Harry.</p><p>“We already explained things to Mrs. Weasley, and she understands,” Draco informed Harry. “She was actually quite broken up about forcing you to eat, much more so than you being a vampire.”</p><p>“[That’s not the main issue,]” Harry muttered to Draco in the dream-tongue, so as to keep the conversation private, silent tears streaming down his face. “[I knew she’d be understanding. It’s what the boggart showed… I still crave it, Draco. I never did before, not this badly, except the time I nearly starved, but now that I’ve had a taste… I thought the desire would fade after a couple weeks, but it hasn’t at all. I’m terrified that the instant someone gets cut, I’ll be on top of them.]”</p><p>“[I promise, Harry, you won’t be. You have much more self-control than that.]”</p><p>“[But I want it so badly! And being restricted to the potion only makes it worse, I think…]” Snape and Dumbledore had insisted that Harry stick to only the potion, nothing else, until the craving vanished.</p><p>“[Did you tell them that?]”</p><p>“[Yes! But they don’t believe me. If I can have animal blood, I’m sure it would subside more… but they even made Sirius and Hagrid promise not to give me any!]”</p><p>“[Bite me.]”</p><p>Harry moved back a bit to look Draco in the eyes. “[But didn’t they also tell you…]”</p><p>“[Screw what they told me. You need actual blood, not that stupid potion. Bite me.]” Draco used a highly commanding voice, encouraging Harry to give in.</p><p>Harry removed the retainer, and nuzzled into Draco’s neck. He licked the skin slightly, then bit down. Draco closed his eyes and arched his head back, revealing as much of his neck as possible, letting out a slight moan as Harry sucked, some blood dribbling across the skin.</p><p>“Er. We’re right here, you know,” Ron said faintly.</p><p>“Hmm. I can see why Luna’s so enchanted by it.”</p><p>“Ginny! You’re not serious, are you?!”</p><p>“I’m quite serious… if they weren’t gay, I might be trying to get a piece of them. Possibly both at once.”</p><p>“Ugh. Please don’t talk with me about wanting to shag my best friend!” Ron pleaded.</p><p>Harry lifted his fangs from Draco’s neck and grinned at Ron, blood trickling down his chin.</p><p>Ron fainted.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Harry, calm down already,” Draco whispered, placing his hand on Harry’s knee to stop him tapping his foot.</p><p>“Sorry. Just anxious, I guess. And before you ask: I’m not entirely sure why, as usual.”</p><p>Harry and his cohorts-- Draco, Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Neville, and even Luna-- were finally permitted to attend Order meetings. Mrs. Weasley still wouldn’t let Ginny, as she wasn’t of age yet. Technically, Luna shouldn’t have been permitted due to that as well, but she had followed them in like she belonged and no one noticed until it was halfway through the meeting. Harry of course still had a few weeks until his birthday as well, but he was in the thick of it so they couldn’t really prevent him from going. So far, though, it was fairly boring: essentially just review of what had gone on only a couple weeks prior, at what had been monickered the “Battle of the Astronomy Tower.” </p><p>Snape was in the middle of giving a report on what they knew of Voldemort’s wearabouts and followers. It was still undecided whether he would try to rejoin Voldemort or not, as the situation was quite tricky now that literally all the Death Eaters who had been at the battle but he and Nott had been beheaded, and Nott was now under Dumbledore’s protection; it would take quite a bit to convince Voldemort of his continued allegiance, and so far Voldemort seemed to have vanished-- or at least, he had not used the Dark Mark to call the Death Eaters. Chances are he would be quiet for some time, as most his inner circle were dead or imprisoned. Snape reviewed the followers whom they knew were alive, as the list was shorter than stating whom had died. Currently in Azkaban, captured at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, were Nott Sr., Macnair, Crabbe Sr., Rookwood, Dolohov, and Mulciber; the other Death Eaters whom had been at that battle had presumably all been eaten, as Voldemort only managed to get Bellatrix out and no one from the battle had rejoined him after. As far as anyone could tell, only three, four if you counted Snape, remained free and alive: Pettigrew, Selwyn, and Travers. Thus, unless he could free those in Azkaban, Voldemort would most likely be lying low for a while, attempting to reestablish a base of followers.</p><p>“Thank you,” Dumbledore told Snape, as he took back the podium. “Now, everyone, it may seem as though things are calmer at the moment, but I implore you to not become complacent because of such. While Voldemort is still alive, we are in danger, regardless of his number of followers. I remind you, once again, that our recent victory would not have been so complete if that creature had not rebelled against the Death Eaters that had captured it. Surely he seeks to find one now that he can better control. Yes, Arthur?”</p><p>“What exactly was that thing, though?” Mr. Weasley asked. “And how did You-Know-Who capture it? I never heard of such a beast until last year! Now, suddenly, another one attacks, it turns out the squid was one too, and you’re saying there are more...”</p><p>“Ah, forgive me, did I not explain to everyone?” Dumbledore looked out across the many confused faces. “Seems I have not… well, then. Unfortunately, after the one at the Ministry was released last year, Voldemort got the idea that perhaps he could find another and control it. I did some research on them, and found that they are a race of ancient creatures simply known as the ‘Old Ones’. They are powerful immortal beings with unknown forms and abilities that vary between them. Today, most are sealed away or choose to ignore humans, which is why the knowledge of them has been lost to time.That is all the  definitive information we possess on them; there are rumors and old tales about specific ones, but none which can be confirmed.”</p><p>“So we’re going in blind on this, you’re saying?” Kingsley asked. “We know nothing about how to defeat them, if he does manage to recruit some?”</p><p>“Well, we do know that, in some cases, corundum does seem to have an adverse effect; it has been used to seal some in the past, according to a book I found, and enchanted cuffs made of it are what Voldemort used to control the one last week.”</p><p>“Then we can seal them!” Kingsley suggested. “Find ones that aren’t sealed yet, and seal them to prevent them seeking him out and offering to join, then guard the seals.”</p><p>“We’re not sealing them!” Harry spat vehemently, to the surprise of most in the room. Harry blushed. “I mean, that probably will only encourage those who aren’t sealed to join him, right? Since then the Order would be seen as the greater enemy. Not that they’d want to anyway, after what he did to Tsathoggua. There’s dozens of them, after all, so no way you can get to all of them before he does.”</p><p>“Harry makes quite a good point,” Dumbledore acknowledged. “They are not the type of beings that you want to upset.”</p><p>“But zey are beasts, are zey not?” Fleur questioned. “Monsterz? How will zey know the otherz are being sealed?”</p><p>Harry snorted. “No more monsters than humans are,” he grumbled, garnering some odd looks.</p><p>Ignoring Harry’s remark, Dumbledore answered. “Some can communicate with each other. Regardless, sealing them is not in the cards. Now, Remus, would you please report on the werewolves…”</p><p>Draco looked at Harry curiously. “Why are you so upset?” he asked under his breath, so only Harry could hear.</p><p>“Because they’re talking like the Old Ones are nothing more than common beasts! No wonder most creatures dislike humans; they’re so arrogant. Looking ‘monstrous’ doesn’t mean one is unintelligent!”</p><p>“Well, yes, but remember, all most these people know are from three Old Ones, one which devoured whomever she could grab, another who chopped the heads off of a dozen people, and the third being the giant squid; they know nearly nothing else. They haven’t spoken to them like we have.” </p><p>Most the Order had been told the same details as everyone else had heard about the battles, completely unaware that Harry and his friends were fairly involved with them and the creatures. The Old Gods hadn’t been mentioned, either-- Dumbledore felt the knowledge that they had helped Voldemort could be detrimental to morale, and as they weren’t extremely involved it could be overlooked. It was a similar situation to Nyarlathotep and their group: a little help here and there, but nothing overt, and definitely not at their command. Nyarlathotep did what he wanted, when he wanted, for motivations only he fully knew. The only thing that was definite is that he did not want Harry to die, as Harry was his “pet anomaly,” as he called it-- a unique being, a vampire that had drank Old One blood and gained powers from it, first of the kind, and Nyarlathotep found that extremely entertaining. That’s why the Old Gods had given Voldemort the knowledge of how he could control them: they hated the cosmic beings (which included the Old Ones, Outer Gods like Nyarlathotep, and the Great Ones who ruled the Dreamlands), and despised the fact that there was a new one coming about. Harry didn’t really consider himself a cosmic being, but apparently the Old Gods didn’t want to take the risk that his abilities developed further, hence helped Voldemort in hopes that he would die since they couldn’t overtly attack him without causing an even bigger war. To them, any cosmic being was a danger to humanity, and they would do whatever it took to prevent a new one from coming about-- even if it meant some humans were harmed in the process.</p><p>Harry barely listened to the rest of the meeting-- the rest of the reports were fairly boring-- and before he knew it, it was over.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>The next Order meeting was called quickly after the first, an emergency one-- there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban, meaning all the captured Death Eaters had been able to return to him. However, according to Snape, the mark still had not burned to summon them; which made sense, since they’d probably all been gathered anyway during the breakout, since there were so few left... even so, eight Death Eaters were not enough to do much, so things were still fairly safe for the moment, it was decided. </p><p>Still, they needed a spy, so Snape volunteered to try returning to Voldemort, even though that could be fatal to him if Voldemort decided he’d been a traitor. Dumbledore, however, thought he’d accept Snape back, as there was no one left alive to prove Snape was a traitor. Since the Dark Mark hadn’t burned, meaning there were no callings he’d missed, Snape could merely say he’d been searching on his own.</p><p>Unfortunately, Nott Sr. had been killed brutally after the escape-- the Order had not expected such. He had not betrayed Voldemort, but he had told Nott Jr. that failure would be punished heavily, and despite having so few numbers Voldemort wanted to show that he followed through on threats.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>“And just where have you been, mister?” Mrs. Weasley glared at Harry, hands on her hips, as he walked through the door-- she had been waiting for him, it seemed.</p><p>“Does it matter?” he mumbled with annoyance.</p><p>“Yes, it does! You are not yet of age, therefore my responsibility, and I will not have you wandering outside the wards at all hours! If you want to leave the house-- at a reasonable hour-- you will tell me where you go, and I will approve it before you do so. You also will go with someone. We are trying to protect you, Harry!”</p><p>“Yeah, I know, but I can protect myself, you know!”</p><p>Mrs. Weasley narrowed her eyes. “You may have abilities humans don’t, but that does not make you invulnerable. What if you are caught off-guard? What if a large group attacks? We need to know where you are, so if you don’t return, we know where to look.”</p><p>“I was just taking a walk,” Harry easily lied. Logically, it made sense, what she was saying. Yet he could not tell her where he went. What was there to say? ‘Luna, Draco, and I went to a pub in another world, and then climbed a mountain, all in under an hour’? Too many questions he did not want answered, especially since Dumbledore would be highly disappointed if he found out-- he’d relegated to the fact that they couldn’t cut all connections with the cosmic beings, but he still expected them to minimize contact with such and all things related, which included using his controllable cosmic abilities. Like apparition to the Dreamlands. If Dumbledore learnt he’d been going there, he’d instantly know it was via the abilities, and if Harry denied that he would assume he were using the potion again, which he’d also ‘promised’ not to use… right, the Dreamlands were staying a secret. Not even their friends would know how frequent their adventures there had become.</p><p>“Just a walk? At 2am?”</p><p>“Yeah. I was bored, and wanted some fresh air. I don’t need sleep, remember?”</p><p>“I am aware, yes. But that is still no excuse for leaving the property; our yard is big enough that you can take a walk without having to leave it.” </p><p>“Er. Well. I suppose that’s true,” Harry muttered, and indeed it was: their place lay on former farmlands, thus had a backyard reflective of such. “I just didn’t think of such.”</p><p>“Harry James Potter. Do not lie to me. You went to the woods, didn’t you?”</p><p>“The woods?”</p><p>“To hunt. Dumbledore told me you like to do such. He also told me that you promised him you’d stick to only using the blood potion.” Despite her strong voice, Mrs. Weasley’s aura showed her to be somewhat uncomfortable with this conversation-- which was understandable, seeing as despite raising seven other children, none had needed to be told to hold back from draining the blood of animals dry.</p><p>“Ah, yeah. Sorry. I actually didn’t, though! Hunt, I mean. I did go to the woods, with the intention to… but I held myself back! I did promise Dumbledore, after all.” That was utter bollocks, of course. Harry had merely promised Dumbledore he would try to hold back; not his fault the old man had interpreted that as though he actually would. </p><p>“Oh. Well, in that case, I suppose I’m proud of you. Just, please tell me if you want to leave the grounds next time, okay?”</p><p>“Will do.” The lie came much too naturally.</p>
