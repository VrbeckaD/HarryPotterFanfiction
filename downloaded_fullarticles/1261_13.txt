    <p>Hermione stared down at the little punch pack on the counter, her lips pressed together in a tight line as she eyed the last pill, still waiting for her inside the hard plastic. Her last suppressant. She had taken the daily pill since thirteen years old, and now eleven years later she was facing the prospect of having to go through her very first heat.</p><p>Back when she'd started taking the pills, the side effects never frightened her. She never assumed she'd spend over a decade on the bloody pills, nor did she assume she would be without a mate by twenty four. For an Omega, this was nearly unheard of. But here she was: twenty four, unmarried, unbonded and facing the very real prospect of infertility if she did not come off the suppressants.</p><p>While she wasn't ready to have kids now, the idea of never having the opportunity left an unsettled pit of anxiety low in her belly. It wasn't strictly biological either—although her inner omega wanted to gouge her eyes out at the prospect of never having pups, it was her own wants. She'd always dreamed of having a big family. Growing up an only child was blissful. Her parents were nothing but attentive and catered to her every whim and desire. Despite the constant love and affection from her parents, she'd longed for a companion growing up. While she was several—<em>several</em> years away from wanting to have children, she knew that she wanted more than just a couple to fill her home.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, she picked up the packet and pressed her thumb over the last little pink pill. It fell into her hand, rolling into the grooves her palm as she tossed the empty pill pack into the bathroom bin without a second thought. She put what was to be her last ever suppressant pill on her tongue before washing it down with a quick gulp of water from the bathroom sink.</p><p>She brushed her hand on her cotton pajama shorts as she walked out of the bathroom, leaving the door ajar as she moved down the small hallway and back to the living room where she left her roommate—and best friend, waiting. "Well, that's the last one."</p><p>Harry glanced up, his face illuminated by the artificial glow of light from his laptop that rested on his thighs, and his lips pulled in a small grimace. "Already? I thought you had another month."</p><p>Hermione shook her head as she fell onto the couch beside him with a huff of air. "Doctor wouldn't write another script since my birthday is in the middle of the month. Said that it's better to go off it early than late."</p><p>"What a wanker." Harry breathed his curse, shaking his head as he pulled his eyes back down to the computer screen. "So what's your plan then?"</p><p>Pulling a throw pillow into her lap, Hermione curled her arms tightly around the lumpy fluff until it was squished against her chest. Even after all these years of friendship, the idea that Harry thought she had an actual plan regarding <em>this</em> particular part of her life was almost amusing. Or rather, it would be if she wasn't so bloody petrified by the idea of going into heat.</p><p>Little Omega's and Alpha's were told from an early age as to the fate that awaited them once the hit puberty. It wasn't like they wouldn't figure it out eventually, as the curse of being a demi-human was typically inherited by at least one of their parents. They had years to prepare for heats, and ruts, and the idea of raising pups. Years to grow used to the idea that their life was going to be literally dependent upon another person. Years to learn the symptoms of an upcoming heat and watch how their parents handled the ebb and flow of hormones included with being a demi-human.</p><p>But Hermione had not been so fortunate.</p><p>She had been raised by two beta's and as far as she knew, there had never been an Omega on either side of her family tree. Which meant she was either incredibly lucky or had the worst luck in the world—depending on one's opinion of the whole demi-human concept. With no preparation for her diagnosis at the age of eleven, and virtually no great examples of Alpha and Omega relationships to reflect upon (no thanks to the media's portrayal of demi-human relationships in overly romanticised novels and movies); Hermione and her parents were woefully ill-prepared to navigate the complex world of what her life was to become when she reached adulthood.</p><p>Fortunately, the scramble to figure out this new lifestyle got pushed to the backburner shortly after her diagnosis. For her savior had come in the form of a little pink pill. The experimental drug was marketed as a miracle—a means to provide an answer for Omega's who wished to avoid the hassle of heats. What her parents saw was an answer to their daughter's problem. What Hermione saw, was a way to avoid pesky little things like adulthood. The drug would suppress her hormones and force her more prominent Omega traits into stasis, while also pushing the Omega instincts down into the deep recesses of her mind. It would give her a chance to grow up without worrying if an Alpha would accidentally trigger her heat, or if she would be safe walking to and from school. It would give her a chance to complete her education so she would not end up as a mindless piece of arm candy, like many of the other the Omega's did.</p><p>And so eleven years ago she began to take the little pink pill everyday, using it to try and have a normal life. One where she didn't have to admit to anyone that she was an Omega. One where she could just be <em>normal</em>—a beta. And up until a year ago, she lived under the pretense of being able to take that bloody medication until she found someone to bond with.</p><p>However that false sense of hope was quickly shattered at her annual physical. Dr. Dumbledore retired and in his place a rather tight lipped eldry M.D. took his place. She took one look at Hermione's chart and broke the unfortunate news. Studies have been proven to show that prolonged use of the suppressants lead to irreversible infertility, and based on the amount of time she'd been on the drug; well... the odds were not in her favor.</p><p>"I was probably just going to…" Her voice drifted off as she looked down at her feet resting on the coffee table, eyes focusing on the chipped blue nail polish instead of having to look at her best friend of nearly fifteen years as she spoke. "Buy some of those toys you showed me on amazon and just—"</p><p>"Are you bloody kidding me?" Harry sighed. She didn't need to look at him to know exactly what type of look he was giving her now. It was the same tight lipped disapproval her mother often gave her when she told her about breaking up with yet another boyfriend. The "<em>I'll love you forever, but you really are a moron"</em> look. "Mione, you can't go through your first heat alone. Did you even try to find someone?"</p><p>"Who the hell am I supposed to ask, Harry? My ex's?" Her eyes flickered up to Harry and she cocked a brow. "I'm sure Cormac would fucking love that."</p><p>"First off, fuck him. He was a pompous arsehole whose only redeeming quality was a big cock." Harry quickly pointed out, his nose wrinkling as he shook his head. "No, you're never allowed to call him again. <em>But</em> you could have, <em>I dunno</em>, here's a novel idea but maybe you could have asked someone who isn't your bloody ex."</p><p>"Yeah? Like who? Neville is married, I'm fairly certain Blaise might have an STI and Cedric is...well, Cedric. Those are the only Alpha's that we know. Clearly my options are limited."</p><p>"What about the owner from that one paper you've submitted articles to?" Harry pressed. "Blond bloke."</p><p>"Lucius Malfoy?!"</p><p>"Yeah. His whole vibe screams Alpha. What about him?"</p><p>"Hard pass." Hermione said with a shudder. "Besides, I think he's married...or asexual. Fuck I don't know. Definitely not interested, though."</p><p>"Okay! Well, what about the hot guy at the end of the hall...big muscles, tattoos and that thick accent! He has to be an Alpha!"</p><p>"Viktor's already bonded, Harry. Have you never noticed the gorgeous blonde that nearly glued to his side?" Hermione sighed, lifting her hands to rub them over his face.</p><p>"Oh...guess not. To be fair, his muscle shirts are rather distracting." Harry pursed his lips together, finger tapping thoughtfully on the top of his laptop. "Fuck. I don't know...I could—I mean if you wanted, I could help. I know I'm no Alpha, but it's better than going through your first heat alone." Harry quickly offered, his eyes softening on her in a way that made her heart ache.</p><p>"Harry...that's so sweet, but…" Hermione began, her shoulders shagging as she tilted her head to the side to look at him. His eyes were on her, soft with worry and concern. It was bad enough knowing she was just days away from what she was shaping up to be one of the most terrifying experiences of her life—but to have Harry so bloody concerned he'd offer to <em>shag</em> her through her heat? Blimey, that was nearly too much to bear.</p><p>"Is it because I'm gay? I'm fairly certain getting it up won't be a problem. I'll just keep my phone hooked up to your TV and play some RedTube." Harry picked up his mobile from the couch cushion and he wiggled it at her with a smirk. "I've got a killer playlist already saved. Just put that on loop and I'd be a walking hard on."</p><p>"Ha! I mean you being gay might be <em>one</em> of the issues, but let's not discount the fact you're in a committed relationship." Hermione took the phone from Harry's hand and she tossed it on the couch between them before taking his hand in hers, giving it a gentle squeeze as a small smile pulled on her lips. "I appreciate the offer, I really do, but no. Theo already thinks we're too close—could you imagine how he'd react if told him we were going to shag?"</p><p>"It's not <em>shagging</em>, it's your heat. Very different." Harry quickly corrected, his lips pursing in disapproval at her wording. "But you do know Theo would understand...if it came down to that. His best friend is an Alpha."</p><p>"Harry, again, you're kind to offer, but there is no way I would ever agree to allow that." Hermione sighed before releasing his hand from hers. Hermione shifted on the couch so her back pressed into the arm and she could face her friend better. "Look, even if we took Theo out of the equation, how can you expect me to agree knowing full well how repulsive you think vagina's are."</p><p>"Whoa!" Harry pulled his laptop screen down, pausing his work as he turned to face her with raised brows. "I thought we agreed we would never talk about that night, ever again!"</p><p>"Haha! Hardly. You tried to swear me to secrecy after I helped cleaned up your sick the next morning, and no amount of cheesecake from Hagrid's is going to make me want to not tease you about it."</p><p>"Ugh...I still can't show my face in Flitwicks," Harry groaned, his fingers sliding under the thick plastic rim of his glasses so he could pinch the bridge of his nose.</p><p>"Because of your drunken confession to an entire bar, or puking all over their coatroom?" Hermione questioned, doing little to stifle her laughter as she watched her friend visible pale at her words.</p><p>"Is both an option?" Harry groaned as he adjusted his frames back into place, emerald eyes flashing over. "Look, fine. I won't help you through your heat—"</p><p>"Good, because I was never going to allow you." Hermione interrupted.</p><p>"Excuse me, rude." Harry rolled his eyes as he lifted a single finger towards her. "Let me finish. What I was saying...I won't help you through your heat, but you really ought to sign up for that heat matching website."</p><p>"I'm sorry, what?" Hermione's brow knit as she narrowed her eyes at Harry in confusion. Heat Matching website? How was it she was the bloody Omega and has never heard of this before.</p><p>"Yes, you know. Findr?"</p><p>"Uh...no, I don't know." Hermione pushed off the arm of the couch, shifting closer to Harry when he opened his laptop and began hurriedly typing away.</p><p>"It's like Grindr, but for demi-humans."</p><p>"And I'm supposed to know what Grindr is?"</p><p>"Oh fuck me. I'm sorry I forgot my best friend is a fucking grandma." Harry sighed a bit more dramatically than necessary. "It's an app—and website for hooking up. But in your case, it helps pair Alphas and Omegas for their heat cycle." Harry explained as he turned the laptop towards her.</p><p>The screen held an image of the Alpha and Omega symbols on a blue background. Underneath the slogan '<em>A Heat is a terrible thing to waste'</em> stood in bold white font. Testimonials from users scrolled beneath the slogan, nearly all of which singing the company's praises for helping find a partner to carry them through their heat.</p><p>Her fingers trembled as she took the laptop from Harry and she set it on her thighs as she began to scroll down the page with a growing curiosity. This was...well, perfect. The idea of going through her heat was already terrifying, but add in the prospect of going through it alone? That was simply too much and she wasn't exactly in a position to proposition anyone to help her.</p><p>This site, Findr, could help her find someone who might know exactly what they were doing. Although sleeping with a complete stranger was not on her top ten list of things to do within the next two weeks, it sounded a hell of a lot better than fucking some plastic knot in her bedroom.</p><p>"Theo's friend...he's used this?" Hermione questioned curiously and her eyes flickered over the computer screen toward her best friend.</p><p>"Oh yeah, loads of times." Harry said with a small wave of his hand. "Helped him keep his wits about him at the hospital. He's had accidental ruts triggered by unsuppressed Omega's seeking medical assistance and even found last minute matches."</p><p>That was...oddly comforting.</p><p>"Do you mind if I…" Hermione's voice trailed off as she selected the <em>sign up here</em> link, and the computer screen flipped to the next page.</p><p>"Oh, not at all." Harry pulled his feet from the coffee table and he pushed up off the couch, his arms lifting above his head as he stretched his spine. "I'm going to make a toastie, want one?"</p><p>"No, but I'd love some water, if you don't mind." Hermione didn't even bother looking up from the screen as she began to fill out the information.</p><p><em>Name: Hermione Granger</em><br/> Age: 24<br/> Status: Omega<br/> Interested In:</p><p>Hermione paused, her mouse hovering over the drop down menu as she looked over the choices with raised brows.</p><p><em>Alpha Male</em><br/> <em>Alpha Female</em><br/><em> Omega Male</em><br/><em> Omega Female</em><br/><em> Beta Male</em><br/><em> Beta Female</em></p><p>Her tongue swept across her bottom lip as she debated the choices. While she didn't have a genuine interest in women, this wasn't supposed to be about dating, right? This was about getting her through her heat, and regardless of what sex the Alpha was, they would be able to help her—right? Biting her bottom lip. She selected the two Alpha choices, telling herself it would only increase her odds of finding someone.</p><p>The remaining questions felt almost clinical, asking about her heat history, when her next expected cycle was, what forms of birth control she was using (thank god for the implant) and when her last STD screening was. By the time she got down to the important questions, the ones where she had to tell potential suitors about herself and pick out her profile photo, Harry sauntered back into the room with a water bottle tucked under his arm and a mouthful of toastie.</p><p>"OOH!" He said excitedly from over her shoulders, practically yanking the laptop off her lap as he dropped the bottle on the couch next to her. "I get to do this part."</p><p>"What?! No way!" Hermione reached to take back his laptop, but Harry swatted away her hands as he settled back on the couch. "Harry, come on, this isn't funny."</p><p>"I'm not laughing, am I?" He questioned, his fingers already fast at work writing her biography. "You're shit at these things, okay? Let me help and if you absolutely hate it, feel free to change it."</p><p>Hermione crossed her arms over her chest, her lips pursing as she watched him at work. Resigning herself to simply deleting the profile later tonight if what he wrote was absolutely trash.</p><p>It took Harry ten minutes to finish her bio, and before she could ask to review it, he hit the create button on the page before returning the laptop with a triumphant.</p><p>On the computer screen sat her Findr profile page. The picture he'd selected was decent—thank god, because he had a plethora to choose from that where less than flattering. In it, she was sitting outside their favorite cafe, The Leaky Cauldron, with a large white coffee mug. She wore a smile that stretched wide across her lips, and her eyes were focused off camera, likely on the waiter who was approaching with their meal. It had been taken in the middle of summer, so the low cut burgundy tank top showed a decent amount of her skin without seeming overly offensive.</p><p>Taking the laptop from Harry, Hermione let it rest against her thighs as she began to scroll down the page, reading the short biography in which Harry outlined her personality to a tee. Headstrong, but open minded. Organized Chaos, with a splash of impulsivity. He didn't touch on her past—only alluding to having a string of off and on again boyfriends and no family within the area.</p><p>But it was the last part of the page that brought a smile to her lips, and remind her that while he was a complete pain in the arse—Harry really did know her far better than anyone else. And maybe his honest assessment of her personality, quirks and all, would help her find a match that would be well suited for her heat in two weeks.</p><p>
