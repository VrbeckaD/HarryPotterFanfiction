    <p>Chapter 1: Intro to Another World</p><p>“So you’re saying that some summoner needs our help in another world?” Mirabelle quirked an eyebrow while making eye contact with you.</p><p>“Yes, after dealing with some conjugation magic, some person appeared and pleaded with me to save their world,” you spoke with a mostly straight face, somewhat confused at the turn of events. In all your lifetimes nothing like this had ever occurred. </p><p>“I see, the Midden is certainly strange. It’s unsurprising that an unknown creature would appear. Dealing with conjugation magic you say?” Tolfdir scratched his chin.</p><p>You could hear Colette gasp, why you had to hold meetings with the lot of them confused you at most times. Not everyone typically attended, but here you were.The restoration master finally came to her words. “The potential there is abounding, but heavens, you said a person was summoned?”</p><p>Phinis hummed in acknowledgement, “humans being summoned are a rare occurrence, but what makes this so important to you archmage?”</p><p>Having been tired of their incessant chatter and instead wanting to get along with things, you silently praised the gods. “I’m intrigued because of the nature of the request. Saving people hasn’t been a problem before,” you coughed awkwardly, as you realize killing people is more your expertise, “the man was at his last breath, the least I could do is check out his problem.”</p><p>What really intrigued you wasn't necessarily the dying man himself. It was just the idea of a new adventure. You had been accustomed to living in a cycle for some time now, even in each life the events tended to be the same. Reach the depths of Blackreach? Been there. Helped the people of Dawnstar? Done that. Took on the emperor’s contract for the Brotherhood? Killed that. It all had to get old at some point. </p><p>You tried living normally for the most part, but living multiple lives messes with you. You’ve been a man, woman, elf, wizard, warrior, khajit, argonian, vampire, werewolf, and the list goes on. But this, this man who pleaded for help was something new.</p><p>If it turned out to be a bust then oh well, you weren’t too concerned at this point. You were pretty sure no one could entirely harm you. </p><p>“The man escaped from attackers, saying he teleported from a world that seemed different from ours. I tried to ask who orchestrated the attack but he seemed too scared to tell me. Apparently it’s some dark lord that is ruling over his country with fear and violence.” Your eyes met your fellow mages’ as you all stood around each other. Their expressions looked grim for a moment, and you hoped you kept the excitement out of your voice.</p><p>“Please tell me that you at least healed him, archmage!” You heard Tolfdir heave exasperatedly.</p><p>“Of course. He told me most of this after he was already healed.” You continued to explain the specifics to the rest of the mages. Their expressions looked worse for wear, but you figured they’d be less worried if they hadn’t lost their previous archmage so recently. </p><p>“So you plan on going to this world with a man who happens to be some sort of oracle? He says that he needs you to protect the savior of that world or something?” Faralda pondered the situation, you could tell she was worrying about the danger that the new world could provide. </p><p>“Yes, and according to what I’ve learned, by the time I’ll truly be needed will be about the savior’s fourteenth year of life.” The oracle had explained some sort of timeline to you, but you figured that you could weasel your way in somehow without disturbing the way other things work. </p><p>“When do you figure you’ll be leaving?” One of the mages asked. </p><p>“I’ll speak to the oracle once more when he wakes up, other than that I’ll probably only need a few more days to prepare.”</p><p> </p><p>After all your explaining, the mages still seemed somewhat worried. You suppose you could ask one of your “friends” to guard the college in your absence. But figuring that none of the timelines had the college in danger without you being involved, you weren’t so worried. </p><p>You always had that ace up your sleeve after all. </p><p> </p><p>“You should probably look younger for this to work,” the oracle explained. “Seeing as Harry Potter ought to be fourteen when you get there, I think it would be best to be the same age.”</p><p>You teetered with your gear appropriately, taking what supplies you might need in emergency. </p><p>“But didn’t you say that in order to blend in at this time, we’ll need more people? Enough for a few students at least?” You tried to go over what previous material he had gone over. What else did you need? Armor, weapons, potions, funds…</p><p>You checked your satchel of septims, thinking about how much you should carry to the other world when-</p><p>“I don’t think they would take those coins in my world.” The oracle leaves up from his place on the bed. “It might be more sufficient to bring universally valuable items, belongings that wouldn’t draw too much suspicion from others.”</p><p>“Would gold ingots work?” You ask, thinking about whether you should bring some building materials in case you needed to build a house as well.</p><p>“I-ingots? Just how rich are you? You must be some sort or royal, aren’t you?” The poor man looked like he was going to have a heart attack at the sight of a few gold ingots. </p><p>“Gemstones might be more effective in terms of carry weight right?” You turned, and when the oracle didn’t respond you figured you ought to answer his previous question. “No I’m not from royalty. Who do you suppose would be the best for me to bring with me?”</p><p>“A pure blood then? Maybe with that, you’d be able to get into the Dark Lord’s ranks and infiltrate…” </p><p>“No idea what that is. I may be part dragon though. I’d best get going before we run out of time to prepare.” Since you figured the man would no longer have any useful information for you, you headed out, to Riften it is.</p><p> </p><p>You nodded to the members of your guild as you strode past, your goal in the Ragged Flagon today was none other than Galathil.</p><p>“What can I do for you today?” Galathil spoke in her typical condescending manner.</p><p>You averted her gaze, not that she would be able to tell with that hood of hers. “I need you to make me look a fourteen year old.” You weren’t surprised when she gasped.</p><p>“I know that I’m skilled, but something of that caliber is quite ambitious, even for me.” She tapped her chin lightly, her thoughts uninterrupted by the chattering of the flagon. </p><p>“Can you do it or not?” Getting tired of her hesitance, you rushed her. If she couldn’t do it then you’d need to figure out something else. </p><p>The corners of her mouth lifted, “any other features you’ll need changed then? Or do you want to look the same but younger?” </p><p>You smiled at her. “I’m glad we could come to an understanding. The same is fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“It might be useful for me to teach you how to apparate.” The man you called “the oracle” tried to get out of bed. “Unless you already know how.”</p><p>“Is that some sort of special spell that comes from your world?” You leaned up against the wall adjacent to the bed. </p><p>“Yes,” the man coughed, “it allows you to instantaneously travel from one place to another, by only using magic and your memory.”</p><p>You were quick to hand him another health potion, “so that’s what it’s called,” you hummed thoughtfully, “I always just called it fast travel.”</p><p>He chuckled, “I guess I should have known better, seeing as the ones back at the school kept calling you Archmage.” Leaning back, he took in his surroundings. “I don’t suppose the wages here are so good as to grant you all this?”</p><p>“While my room here is for Archmages, most of my wealth was made by other means.” The man seemed confused by your explanation. “The previous Archmage passed on recently. Due to saving the college I was granted the title of Archmage.”</p><p>“Ah, I see you’re of great capability then. I guess I don’t have to worry too much.” The man seemed more assured by your hasty summary.</p><p>“I do want to ask though, since sometimes I fail to fast travel, or apparate, when enemies are around.” Mr. Oracle looked confused by your words. “Is there a way in your world to travel, other than apparating?”</p><p>“I don’t think that typically happens in our world. We are able to travel no matter the enemies around us, hence how I got here. I guess this ‘fast traveling’ of yours may be different.” He tapped his chin lightly, “we do have something called portkeys though…”</p><p>Minutes later, after being taught the portus charm, the man assured you that it could be used even when threats were nearby. He taught you how to enchant items, and when you assured him you understood, he made a portkey for you.</p><p>“Once you touch this cup you’ll be transported to my world-“</p><p>Before you could finish explaining, you found yourself being sucked into a whirlwind, only to land on the ground in front of a castle.</p>
