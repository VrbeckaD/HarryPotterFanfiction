    <p>Jack develops an ‘alternative personality’ that’s a lot like the inner hollow from Bleach. Will tease and scare but wants original safe. Has no problems with killing.<br/>
As the fans craft more and more of the lore for ‘Anti’ their belief takes on a power of its own...<br/>
...<br/>
At first just tiny moments of ‘something coming over him’ and he’ll do things he wouldn’t normally do.<br/>
Then he almost gets jumped in an alley way and a tiny voice in his head starts teasing him for how he’s handling it. Jack dares the voice to do better. ‘Deal accepted’</p>
