    <p>Prologue:</p><p>	The room spun as I yet again raced to the bathroom.   The orange carpet was soft underneath my bare, tanned feet.  I reached the bathroom door to find it locked.</p><p>	“Harmony!  Come on dude, really?  You've been in there all morning!”</p><p>	My pink-haired friend opened the door and threw a hand on her hip.  “And you were in there all night?  You calling off work again?”  </p><p>	I nodded and pushed past her.  I then threw up the contents of my stomach.  Harm watched from the doorway, a look of concern painted over her face.  I tilted my head up again.</p><p>	“It's just the flu, Harm...”</p><p>	“And you've had it for over a week...  don't you think it's time to go see a doctor?”</p><p>	“Only if it's Dr. Chase....”</p><p>	“Lizzie... “</p><p>	“I'm fine, Harm...  really.  Now get lost before I get you sick...”</p><p>	“Elizabeth Gordon, what am I going to do with you?”</p><p>	“Put up with my insane antics?”</p><p>	“Sheesh.  It's like dealing with a five year-old.”</p><p>	“You love me and you know it...”</p><p>	“I gotta go to work loser.”</p><p>	“Be safe, Harmy.”</p><p>	“And you get back to bed.   We're going to the doctor's office when I get back.  No complaints...”</p><p>	“Yes, mother...”</p><p>	“The sad part is I'm the younger one...”</p><p>	I started coughing hard and I couldn't breathe. Harm helped me stand up and we walked back into my bedroom.  She handed me a bottle of water from my refrigerator and sat on my bubble chair.  </p><p>	“Are you sure you're ok?”</p><p>	“Harmony, I'm fine.”  I said, hoarsely.</p><p>	“I'm calling in.  I'm taking you to the doctor now.  It's serious.”</p><p>	“Harm!  Go. To. Work.  I'm not going to let you baby me.  I can handle this.  If it gets really bad, I'll call you, ok?”</p><p>	“Are you sure?”</p><p>	“Yes!  Get going or your boss is going to fire your pink-haired ass!”</p><p>	Harm gave me a forced smile.  I sighed and took a long drink of the water.  </p><p>	“If I take myself to the doctor, would you calm the hell down and leave me be?”</p><p>	“Yes....?”</p><p>	“Ok, I'll call Dr. Riley and see if she can get me in...”</p><p>	“Ok.  Let me know.  My phone is on.”</p><p>	“Ok.  Go to work.”</p><p>	“Fine...” said Harm, throwing a pillow at me.</p><p>	I rolled my eyes and called Dr. Riley.   This was not going to end well...<br/>
2 Hours later<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>	“YOU'RE WHAT?!” said Harmy.  </p><p>	Harmy's hair was as shocking as her face was, especially in the stark white hospital.  Her pink hair seemed to loosen itself from her loose ponytail and stand on end.</p><p>	“I just got diagnosed with Leukemia.”  I said</p><p>	“No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no...” said Harmy.</p><p>	“Harmy, come in Harmy.” I said.</p><p>	“YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR HAIR!!!” said Harmy.</p><p>	I stared at her.  “Wow.... and shhhh.  There are dying people here.”</p><p>	“Like you!” said Harmy.</p><p>	I rolled my eyes.  “I'm fine.... course I'll be in the ground in 3 months but eh...”</p><p>	“ELIZABETH!!!  YOU CAN'T LEAVE!” said Harmy.</p><p>	“Do you think I want to Harmy?” I said.</p><p>	“No....” said Harmy.</p><p>	“Dammit, be happy I have 3 months!”</p><p>	“Oh, fine!”<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2 and a half months later~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>	I had lost all of my reddish-brown hair and I could hardly leave the bed due to almost constant blood transfusions.  Harmy, like an awesome best friend, was at the hospital everyday.  One day I was flipping through channels while Harmy was messing with my cell phone when I turned to her.</p><p>	“Harmy, do you want to know what I want to do before I die..?” I said.</p><p>	“What?” said Harm, putting down my phone.</p><p>	“I wanna visit every single fandom that I have liked in like animes and tv shows since the beginning.”</p><p>	“Is that even possible?” said Harmy</p><p>	“Hey, it's what I want.” I said.</p><p>	Little did I know that it was possible.... and I was about to get it.</p>
