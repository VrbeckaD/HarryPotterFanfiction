    <p>The snitch zoomed into Harry’s hand as if it was meant to be there, and cheers erupted all over the stadium.</p><p>Colin Creevey’s jubilant voice rang out over the pitch. “Yes! Harry Potter’s got the snitch! Gryffindor wins the Term Tourney!”</p><p>With a smile for his teammates, Harry alighted at the centre of the pitch and held the snitch over his head like a trophy. His teammates pressed in and bombarded him with hugs and slaps on the back, knocking him this way and that in their exuberance. Harry endured it with a grin, because it made them happy.</p><p>Inside, he was wondering what the point of it all was.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of green and silver alighted ahead of him, and Harry found himself face-to-face with Malfoy’s pointy scowl.</p><p>“Enjoy it while you can, Potter.” Malfoy flashed a vicious smile. “Tomorrow won’t be so good for you.”</p><p>Ron stepped up beside Harry and cracked his knuckles. “Was that a threat, Ferret-boy?”</p><p>“It was a promise, Weasel.”</p><p>The rest of the team moved into place beside Harry and pulled out their wands as one.</p><p>“You have ten seconds to leave the pitch before we rearrange your insides,” said Jack Sloper from Harry’s left.</p><p>“Make that five,” said Ginny from Harry’s right. “You’re outnumbered, Malfoy. Take your issues elsewhere.”</p><p>Malfoy growled and twitched his wand as if he was tempted to test his luck, but after one more scowl in Harry’s direction, turned and left the pitch.</p><p>“I don’t even know why that little prick is allowed in the school,” said a furious Ron. “He’s a bloody Death Eater!”</p><p>With how vicious Malfoy had been lately, Harry didn’t know either, but he kept his mouth shut. He’d heard enough about his supposed obsession with the slimy Slytherin ferret to be going on with.</p><p>“Oh, come on, Ron,” said Ritchie Coote. “You-Know-Who’s not going to take in whiny little shites like Malfoy. I mean, he’s what, sixteen, seventeen? Why would You-Know-Who bother with a kid? Especially an annoying prat like Malfoy.”</p><p>Several of the others agreed, but Harry knew better.</p><p>“Voldemort’s taken younger,” said Harry in a quiet voice. “And Malfoy <em>is</em> marked. I’ve seen it, when the bastard tried to cut me in half in the loo last month.”</p><p>The team went quiet.</p><p>Katie Bell whispered, “He’s really marked?”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Ron. “He is, and he shouldn’t be in school here. He’s dangerous, the bloody prat. I don’t understand why Dumbledore doesn’t just chuck him.”</p><p>But Harry thought of another Slytherin who had been marked young, one who turned to the light and risked his very life and sanity all for them, and he thought he understood. He didn’t dare share his thoughts with his teammates, however. They still saw the world in black and white. Not a one of them understood yet that the world was all shades of grey.</p><p>Well, none of them had been forced to grow up as early as Harry had. They were still children, and that was okay. They were <em>supposed</em> to be children. Harry shook his head and, just for a moment, mourned the loss of his childhood.</p><p>Yet another precious thing he had sacrificed for this bloody war.</p><p>“Just forget him, guys,” said Ginny. “Let’s not let the Prince of Ponces ruin our fun, yeah? Come on! Harry just won us the tourney, remember? Why aren’t we celebrating?”</p><p>Her exuberant words brought back the team’s excitement, though the shine had worn off for Harry, and they broke into cheers.</p><p>The next thing he knew, Harry was up in the air again, hoisted high on his teammates’ shoulders. He forced his grin steady as they cheered and carried him about, too swept away in their excitement to notice their captain’s growing discomfort. Too many hands touching him, too many fingers too close.</p><p>He endured it despite his fear, because he didn’t want them to know his greatest shame.</p><p>The crowd grew. Gryffindors and ‘fans’ from other houses slipped into the huddle for their piece of the action, and suddenly there were hands all over him. Too much—too many. His grin turned into a grimace, and he asked to be put down. Of course, they didn’t listen.</p><p>Instead, someone grabbed his arse, and he tensed with sudden terror.</p><p>“Guys, that’s enough, really. I can walk!”</p><p>But they were too wrapped up in an off-key verse of “Potter is Hotter” to hear. Harry tried moving his rear end out of the way, but it seemed no matter how he wiggled, someone was always too close. Part of him wondered if normal men—men who hadn’t been damaged by war and insane relatives—actually enjoyed this, or if they just put up with it, too.</p><p>Shite. Where were his teammates? He didn’t even know the group hoisting him now.</p><p>Then some adventurous twit—he wasn’t sure who—grabbed him between the legs on the next toss and <em>rubbed</em>, and Harry shrieked with the violation. <em>That</em> was too bloody far.</p><p>“Oi! What the hell? Put me down this instant!”</p><p>At the fury and volume in his voice, the crowd obeyed—finally—and set Harry on his own two feet. His teammates pushed through the unfamiliar faces, and he glared at the lot of them, sparing only Ron and Ginny his wrath. Harry knew better than to suspect either of them for this.</p><p>“Who the bloody hell thought it was fair to grope me, huh? Just because you read some stupid story saying I like such things or so much rubbish—and I don’t—but even if I did, that still doesn’t give you the right to fucking assault me!”</p><p>Ron laid a soothing hand on his shoulder. “Mate, easy. I know you’re angry, but it was probably an accident. Hard to gauge when you’re in the air like that.”</p><p>“Oh no, Ron,” said a seething Harry. “This was no accident. Someone thought my fame or the fact that I’d won the tourney gave them a free ticket to my bits. Well, it doesn’t. Stay the hell away from me.” He rubbed a hand across his face—he was shaking all over. “I … I need a minute.”</p><p>He stalked away to a chorus of disappointed moans and the sound of Ron bellowing at the crowd. Harry just wanted to get away from it all.</p><p>Jack, Ritchie, and Katie muscled the crowd out of the way, parting the sea of excited students and rabid fans to give Harry an escape. He gave them a grateful look and dashed away on his Firebolt the moment he gained enough ground for a takeoff.</p><p>Their eyes dragged across his body like fingers, and Harry shuddered with a sudden urge to retch. Why did people think they owned him just because he’d rebounded Voldemort’s curse as a baby? Gods. All he wanted was peace, a little bit of normalcy in his mad life. Instead he was hounded everywhere he went—unless he used polyjuice or glamours. It was insane. People didn’t treat Ron or Hermione like this—only him.</p><p>He was utterly sick of it.</p><p>Harry flew around the castle a few times to clear his head and, once he could go five minutes together without snarling, alighted by the beech tree beside the lake. As everyone was still hanging about the pitch, the grounds near the lake were peaceful and empty. The giant squid had come out to play and was waving its arms lazily in the sun, but otherwise, the lake was silent.</p><p>Harry breathed in the quiet and the stillness, and sighed. This was more like it. All he was missing was the Prince’s book, and he would have everything he needed to wash the stain of groping hands from his memory. With a nod, he Summoned his rucksack from his dorm and grinned as it sailed into his arms.</p><p>As his nerves slowly began to settle, he cracked open the potions book and lost himself in its pages. The Prince was such an expressive writer. Whether he was adjusting a potions recipe or writing poetry in the blanks between recipes, his way with words captivated Harry.</p><p>He wished he could meet the man, just once, before Voldemort killed Harry.</p><p>
  <em>“Sectumsempra—for enemies.”</em>
</p><p>Harry frowned and traced his finger over the words, a spell written in the handwriting of his beloved Prince. Wasn’t that the curse Malfoy had tossed at him in the loo three weeks ago? When Harry had thought he would be cut in half? Snape had come to his rescue and sang over him, his low, dark chant healing the wounds, but gods, until then, Harry had been certain he would die.</p><p>How Malfoy hadn’t been expelled … but then, Harry remembered the terror on the boy’s face, the shock and horror at what he had done. Maybe Malfoy hadn’t known what the spell would do when he cast it. Gods, what a stupid thing to do. He might have killed Harry, not that it would have been such a great loss to the little ferret.</p><p>What was <em>that</em> twisted spell doing in the Half-Blood Prince’s book?</p><p>“Where’s your protective detail, Potter?”</p><p>The voice raised the hair on the back of Harry’s neck. Malfoy. He closed his book and carefully set it inside his rucksack.</p><p>“What do you want, Malfoy?”</p><p>There was no answer, and, heart thundering in his ears, Harry dared peek around the tree. Malfoy and his twin muscles, as well as a distraught Theo Nott, were standing about twenty yards away, all four with wands raised and pointed straight for him. And this time, Harry was alone.</p><p>Shite. He did <em>not</em> like those odds. Especially given Malfoy’s strange behaviour at the match, Harry knew he needed to get out of there. Something about this situation was just not right.</p><p>Harry moved slowly, never taking his eyes off the group ahead, and slipped his fingers around the base of his wand.</p><p>Malfoy sneered and cried, <em>“Sectumsempra!”</em></p><p>Shite! So much for Malfoy being horrified of himself.</p><p>Harry rolled away from the spell, towards his books and broom. It cut through the bark of the tree where his head had been seconds before, and Harry’s stomach dropped into his gut.</p><p>This wasn’t Malfoy the schoolboy rival, this was Malfoy the Death Eater, and he wasn’t playing games.</p><p>Goyle shouted, <em>“Oculignis!”</em></p><p>Harry had no idea what that sickly grey light would do to him, but he didn’t want to find out. After a quick dodge, he leapt atop his broom and jerked his rucksack over his shoulders.</p><p>
  <em>“Confringo!”</em>
</p><p>The branch directly above Harry’s head burst into bits and dropped.</p><p><em>“Protego!”</em> His shield went up just in time to send the heavy branch and pieces bouncing harmlessly to the side.</p><p>Bloody hell, he had to <em>move!</em> With a little cry of alarm, Harry shot into the sky and darted about to avoid any incoming curses.</p><p>Malfoy screamed, <em>“Crucio!”</em></p><p>Harry dropped like a stone to avoid the Unforgiveable, then zipped away, pouring his considerable power into his shields and his broom for greater speed.</p><p>For a moment, he thought he was safe. Then, the curses and spells started again, and Harry realised that the little ferret had come prepared. A quick glance behind him confirmed his fears—they had all mounted brooms and were tearing after him, still shooting curses at every opportunity.</p><p>Dear Merlin, this was <em>bad</em>.</p><p>Harry dodged another cutting curse and flattened himself to his broom, soaring as fast as his power would allow towards the castle doors. He had to get out of the open, and in there, at least he could take shelter in a password-warded room. No one would be inside except perhaps for a couple of teachers who hadn’t been that interested in the impromptu, end-of-term quidditch tourney, but he could escape to the Headmaster’s office and wait until Dumbledore returned. Malfoy wouldn’t be able to get in there.</p><p>As he might have predicted, his plans didn’t work out as he’d hoped. Malfoy was just as fast as Harry and the little shite was clearly determined to do him in. Just as Harry reached the way to the headmaster’s tower ….</p><p>
  <em>“Accius Draconis!”</em>
</p><p>Harry skidded to a stop in front of a burst of green fire and barely ducked under a pair of snapping, fiery jaws. Heart heavy as a stone, terror turning to despair, he turned on his heel and darted down the only remaining route—the way to the dungeons.</p><p>Snape. If he could get to Snape, maybe he’d have a chance. The man hated him, but he wouldn’t let Harry be cursed to bits. With a little cry of frustration and terror, he dashed towards Snape’s office and prayed the man would be there. He had to change route again, however, when Goyle summoned a viper and dropped it at the doorway. Shite! Harry could speak to the snake, sure, but he hadn’t the time to convince it not to strike with curses exploding all around his head.</p><p>With a cry of rage and terror, Harry turned again and dashed for the potions classrooms. If nothing else, he could take refuge in the heavily-warded rooms. Their thick doors and stone walls would keep the worst of Malfoy’s curses out, if only he could reach them in time.</p><p>Harry darted to the nearest classroom, but the door wouldn’t budge. He cast a hasty <em>Alohamora</em> and dashed inside, slamming the door shut just as Crabbe threw a blasting curse at him. He registered the looming presence of someone else in the room, but he had no time to take in any other detail—the wards would do no good if he left the door unlocked. He turned and cast the strongest locking charm he knew at the door, praying it would be enough, and whipped back around to warn the room’s other occupant, whoever it was.</p><p>As his eyes took in the identity and condition of the man on the other side of the room, a panicked cry for help died on his lips. Snape was standing by the window, eyes wide and face streaked with tears, his marked arm dripping blood and a red-coated knife in his hand.</p>
