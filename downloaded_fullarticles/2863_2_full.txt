  <strong>UnknownUnseenUnheard's Christmas Special, 2018</strong>
</p><p>Sora sighed, looking up at their handiwork. Leon had been skeptical when Sora had told him his plans, but had agreed nonetheless. Sora was glad. Villains Vale had never looked more cheery, which was a really weird sentence now that Sora thought about it.</p><p>Decorations here and there, lights strung all over the damn thing, people running back and forth setting the place up(mostly house elves, to be honest, since even Sora couldn't get enough volunteers to turn get massive castle in tip top shape in such short order).</p><p>Preparing for a Christmas bash was busy work, even with massive creepy castles to go with it. Jack Skellington seemed to be having a blast setting all the decorations, though.</p><p>"I can't believe you invited me! I'm so excited!" Jack all but gushed as he busied himself setting more lights.</p><p>Sora laughed.</p><p>"Of course I invited you! I invited everyone." Sora revealed.</p><p>Jack blinked down at him. How he managed to do so without eyes was something Sora was still trying to wrap his head around. Still, Jack managed it, because of course he did.</p><p>"Everyone?" Jack repeated.</p><p>"Everyone." Sora affirmed.</p><p>Suddenly, an arm appeared out of literally nowhere, draping itself over Sora's shoulder. The young Keyblade wielder eeped in surprise, turning his head to gaze at the red leather clad six foot tall Canadian towering behind him.</p><p>"Including me! You're favorite friendly Christmas lovin' Deadpool!" The assassin crooned. Actually crooned.</p><p>"Deadpool?" Sora exclaimed, surprised. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>When had this become a Marvel crossover?</p><p>Oh. Wait. Disney owned Marvel now. Duh.</p><p>Deadpool tsked, wagging his finger at Sora.</p><p>"Sora, Sora, Sora. 'Course I'm here! After all, yours truly has a starring role in From the Heart II!" Deadpool proclaimed, taking a step back and trailing a hand seductively down his torso, head tossed back as he shamelessly splayed himself.</p><p>Sora gaped.</p><p>"Wait, you do? When did that happen?"</p><p>Deadpool shrugged.</p><p>"Who knows. Although… If the author could hurry it up and introduce me, that would be great!" Deadpool shook his fist at the sky.</p><p>Sora continued gaping.</p><p>"But- but- aren't you a little, you know, not PG friendly to be in a Kingdom Hearts crossover?" Sora asked.</p><p>Deadpool squealed, chin cupped in his hands as he swayed back and forth.</p><p>"Oh, my good little Padawan, already breaking the fourth wall! I have much to teach you, my new apprentice!"</p><p>Elsewhere, Young Xehanort could only blink in astonishment as he received his own Christmas bash invitation, wondering if this was some sort of elaborate trap by the Keyblade welder to trap him. But no, it was not.</p><p>When Sora said everyone he, quite literally, meant everyone.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>Leon looked around the castle in wonder.</p><p>Wha… How… How!?</p><p>"Wow, Sora really spruced up the place, didn't he? Isn't this exciting!" Yuffie exclaimed, jumping up and down in joy.</p><p>Leon could concede this, he supposed. Sora had, in the matter of a few hours, somehow managed to convert Villains Vale into a sunny happy Christmasy place.</p><p>Well. As Christmasy as something can get when one of the decorators is Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King.</p><p>"Well, well. Look at what we have here. Puberty boy. Who would have thought."</p><p>No, no, noooo. Please tell me Sora didn't… Leon turned, and groaned, burying his face in his hands. Sora had. There, striding straight towards him with obvious purpose, was the one person Leon had never wanted to see again, in this life or the next.</p><p>Of course he would survive the fall of the world. As annoying as he was, even Leon could admit, Seifer Almasy was tenacious. Of course he'd survive the end of the world. Seifer literally existed just to annoy Leon, so this shouldn't be as surprising as it was.</p><p>Then, an arm was yanking insistently at his sleeve.</p><p>"Oh hey, who's the blond hottie? Introduce me?" Yuffie begged.</p><p>Oh hell no. Leon would rather tangle with another Heartlessfied Malboro.</p><p>"I'm not dealing wi-</p><p>"Squall!"</p><p>Leon froze. Froze, then turned, slowly. There, making her way towards him past the throngs of people going in and out of Villians Vale, was none other than Quistis.</p><p>Leon gaped. He couldn't help it.</p><p>Quistis reached him, smiled at him, then wrapped him in a quick hug.</p><p>"It's good to see you." His former instructor told him, pulling away. Leon still stood there, stock still, mouth hanging wide open because, what?</p><p>"Oh wow. I don't think I've ever seen him so shocked." Yuffie commented.</p><p>"I have, when I gave him that scar. Ruined his pretty widdle model looks." Seifer drawled.</p><p>"Nah, you just gave him a sexy scar." Yuffie disagreed. "And, I see he returned the favor!" Yuffie eyed Seifer up and down appreciatively.</p><p>Leon just had to facepalm at that. Trust Yuffie's idiotic banter to knock him out of a funk. Leon couldn't help but laugh. Looking around, he realized this party might not be such a bad idea after all.</p><hr/><p>

Maybe he could use tactile telekinesis to pin them both in place long enough to escape? Wait, no, that would never work, these two were trained by Batman, of all people. He'd never get past them.

"Oh boy, you're useful." he stated with an eyeroll. "Just how exactly am I supposed to stop the end of the world?"</p><p>"Easy," a voice spoke up. Jason!IW turned, gaze locking on a little boy standing near another version of Percy. "Set sis and Annabeth on him. They scare the crap out of him." the child revealed.</p><p>The Percy next to him gasped.</p><p>"Nico, you are utterly evil and I should have totally left you in that casino."</p><p>Who?</p><p>Jason!IW clutched at his head. What? Who?</p><p>"I doubt any of this matters." Reyna decided to add in her two cents.</p><p>"Why?" Percy!Canon and Percy!PB said in unison.</p><p>"Because," Reyna said with a pointed glare at the author, "Prophecy Breaks hasn't been updated in over a year and the Inverted World is almost as bad. We're screwed."</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"I still can't believe we are the only Star Wars/Gintama crossover." Shinpachi lamented.</p><p>"Wait, are we?" Kagura questioned.</p><p>"Gin-San is too lazy to check. He has to ready himself for a fight with Darth Vader." Gintoki twitched from where he laid sprawled across a table, bottles all around.</p><p>Shinpachi winced.</p><p>"I'm sure you'll be fine."</p><p>Gintoki looked up.</p><p>"Vader is a total M, with an emphasis on asphyxiation. It was nice knowing you, Shintank."</p><p>…</p><p>"THAT JOKE IS LITERALLY YEARS OLD!"</p><p>Beside them, Luke exchanged a look with his sister.</p><p>"Just what did we get ourselves into?"</p><p>Leia considered this.</p><p>"Either we're going to save the galaxy in the most ridiculous way possible, or some deranged immortal is going to figure out how to blow up galaxies instead of just planets and take us all out."</p><p>Luke sighed. Right. Story of his life.</p><hr/><p>

Half, you lazy bastard!"</p><p>Beside him, Byakuran shrugged while popping marshmallows into his mouth.</p><p>"Personally, I don't mind if that particular crossover ever gets published." Byakuran revealed.</p><p>Gintoki shot him a look of betrayal and revulsion.</p><p>"What? I may be an insane sociopathic mass murderer, but that doesn't mean I want to be smacked into the face with that," Byakuran motioned towards Gintoki's bokuto.</p><p>Gintoki twitched, lifting said wooden blade.</p><p>"You, Marshmallow-kun, have killed more than even Utsuro could manage. In fact, I do believe you have the highest kill count of anyone in this room, Sith included."</p><p>"Lalalala, I once massacred the entire Marvel Universe cause the Avengers tried to fix me but yah can't fix perfection, lalalala!" Deadpool pranced right by them, singing in a ridiculously high pitched voice.</p><p>Byakuran looked victorious. Gintoki arched an eyebrow.</p><p>"You wiped out a trillion different versions of earth." Gintoki reminded the other.</p><p>"Yes," Byakuran waved a hand dismissively, "but I'm good now, honest!"</p><p>Gintoki still broke his face for good measure.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"You three are the most adorable things ever!" Rin!ADR crooned, cradling the younger versions of himself, Yukio, and Nero.</p><p>Beside him, Yukio!ADR facepalmed.</p><p>"Really, Rin? Your brother complex is now extending to a younger alternate version of yourself?"</p><p>Rin!ADR shot him a confused look.</p><p>"Brother complex? I don't have a brother complex." he denied.</p><p>Yukio!ADR decided to seek aid from Dante. This, it turned out, was a bad idea.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Dante was currently engaged in an outright screaming match.</p><p>"Mephisto! You went to <em>Mephistopheles</em> instead of me! I could have helped you, Vergil!" Dante bellowed.</p><p>Vergil sneered, arms crossed as he shot the other an unimpressed look.</p><p>"Ah, yes. Your brand of so called 'help'. Exactly what I would need. A suicidal maniac running about, uncaring of the carnage he wroughts because at the end of the day he just wants to die."</p><p>"I don't care if we were fighting at the time," Dante ignored Vergil's words, "if you had told me you needed help, if you had told me you <em>had a damn kid</em>, I would have tossed everything aside and done my best to help!"</p><p>"Well, it's too late now, isn't it!" Vergil screamed right back.</p><p>Dante flinched.</p><p>"Yeah… Yeah, I suppose it is." he said softly.</p><p>Yukio!ADR gulped. Ah hell. He hoped he and Rin never ended up like that. He had no idea what he would do if they did. Sure, Rin was annoying as hell, but still.</p><hr/><p>
  <strong><u> Reincarnation Roulette (Harry Potter, Supernatural, Star Wars, Percy Jackson, Bleach, Naruto, Katekyo, Fairy Tail)</u> </strong>
</p><p>Harry's jaw dropped. He could not help it. Sue him.</p><p>"Wait, wait, wait- you mean you're all me?" Harry gasped. "Well." Harry paused. "Different versions of me, obviously."</p><p>Surrounding him were the many versions of him, scattered across time. Seriously. Harry was starting to wonder if he wasn't secretly Xehanort with how many different versions of himself there apparently were.</p><p>Bobby Singer cracked his knuckles.</p><p>"Obviously, boy. I swear, I'm surrounded by idjits."</p><p>That one was one of Harry's favorite versions of himself. Anyone who took out Voldemort with a goddamn sniper rifle was good in his book.</p><p>"Hey, lay off the kid a bit." Han Solo chided.</p><p>Solo actually hadn't taken out Voldemort. On the other hand, he had liquified Bellatrix Lestrange in a moment of awesome pissed off rage, so Harry could wave that off. Even if his reincarnation had arguably been Harry's messiest life to the point where Solo used a bloody reset button to get out of the mess he'd gotten himself into.</p><p>A Darth Sidious possessed Dumbledore was a terrifying thought.</p><p>"Herbivores. Let me nap or I will note you all to death." Hibari snapped.</p><p>Flamel had actually gotten off his eternal ass and done something in Hibari's timeline. And, by something, Harry meant fixing Voldemort's shattered psyche and proceeding to turn him into a child. Who got adopted by Cedric Diggory, of all people.</p><p>"If you wanna nap, the fuck are you doing here, pretty boy?" Grimmjow growled.</p><p>Harry was pretty sure Grimmjow was sleeping with Kurosaki. There. He said it. Those two fought like they had wild hate sex.</p><p>Well, that, and he had successfully freaked Dumbledore out enough that Grimmjow was literally fighting his own side in a three way war.</p><p>A three way war that hadn't been updated in wayyy too long.</p><p>"Sleep is for the weak." Gaara said.</p><p>If Harry ever met Gaara's father, he would break his own person thou shalt not kill rule, period</p><p>"Dude. You sleep more than he does, panda eyes." Gray said incredulously.</p><p>Gray got fucked over more by the Ministry than Harry had. He got fucked over so bad it ended with Ginny becoming Ginnymort, which in itself was horrifying when you don't account the fact that Ginny was still alive in there, utterly horrified because her body was moving to someone else's sing and dance.</p><p>"At least you people got multiple chapters." Revan complained.</p><p>"Yeah, me and Revan are way incomplete." Luke Castellan nodded.</p><p>Revan glared.</p><p>"You, at least, got two chapters. I got one and Voldemort got away with the Philosopher's Stone. Can you say cliffhanger?"</p><p>"I got a spin off, motherfuckers!" Grimmjow boasted.</p><p>"A spin off that has not been updated in a year." Gaara's could not help but point out. "Also, a spin off that is far behind based on how far you were in Reincarnation Roulette."</p><p>Grimmjow waved this off dismissible.</p><p>"Who cares, fuckhead? I got a spin off and you don't, I gotta spin off and you don't-"</p><p>Revan lifted a hand lazily. Grimmjow gasped, choking for breath.</p><p>"Stop it. I have a headache from all the genderbending. You have absolutely no idea what hell that does to your hormone state." Revan complained.</p><p>"Gender bending?" Harry repeated dully. What?</p><p>Revan nodded, rubbing at his aching head.</p><p>"Yes. Me and the Exile both suffer from it. I honestly wouldn't mind if it was just a mental state, but-"</p><p>Revan's form suddenly flickered in and out rapidly for several seconds. Once it was done, what was left was a voluptuous woman, groaning as she lowered her head to the table.</p><p>"That- this Ramza-" she began.</p><p>"Ranma." Gray corrected.</p><p>"This Ranma gig is getting old. How does the Exile deal? They never get phased by it!"</p><p>"I think," Gaara began, "that we ought to forget about that and remember my story. After all, I have to fight Herpo the Foul."</p><p>Harry was confused.</p><p>"Herpo The Who?"</p><p>Gaara shot him an incredulous look.</p><p>"Herpo the Foul. The father of the Dark Arts. Lord of darkness. Inventor of Horcruxes and the first to successfully breed a basilisk." Gaara explained.</p><p>"And he's still alive?" Harry said, alarmed.</p><p>"He was suppose to be the big bad for the Next Gen series, but that got discontinued." Revan explained.</p><p>"Next Gen? What's that?"</p><p>As one, Harry's reincarnates turned to gaze off into some dark corner of the castle.</p><p>"The forgotten stories." they each murmured ominously.</p><p>Okkkay. Harry was bowing out of this one.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"Wait, what do you mean I die at the end of Frozen Memories?! I don't wanna die!" Sora cried out.</p><p>Ventus took a moment to gaze up at the sky, hoping for patience and strength to get him through Sora's melodrama. It didn't come.</p><p>"How else would we have ended up in Harry's head?" Ventus pointed out. "We had to die somehow. Although, honestly, the surprising bit is that the universe didn't reset when we did." Ventus commented.</p><p>Sora froze.</p><p>"What do you mean, universe reset?" he asked.</p><p>Before Ventus could even open his mouth, a red leather clad figure slammed into Sora's back, causing a gasp to escape his lips as he looked over his shoulder.</p><p>"Ow, ow, I can answer! I can answer, pick me!" Deadpool ranted in Sora's ear.</p><p>"Deadpool?" Sora repeated, more of a question than a selection.</p><p>Deadpool didn't seem to take it that way and let out a cheery shout as he backed away. Then, out of nowhere, a projector began to shine light on a screen that Sora could have sworn wasn't there five seconds ago.</p><p>"So, we start here-" Deadpool pointed at one end of the diagram, labeled as Keyblade War, then to the next one, "then we go here, and here, and here."</p><p>Sora blinked.</p><p>"Those are… The stories the author's written that are Kingdom Hearts related." Sora could not help but point out.</p><p>"Bingo!" Deadpool patted Sora's head. "Each time you die, the universe resets and it moves to the next story! You, sir, are trapped in a time loop dating back to the original Keyblade War!"</p><p>Sora's jaw dropped before gazing at the map on growing horror.</p><p>"Wait, does that mean that all those stories will end with a death scene for me?!"</p><p>Deadpool blinked. Somehow.</p><p>"You know, I suppose you do, Sky boy. Lucky." Deadpool muttered the last part in a tone that was undeniable jealousy. Sora tried not to think too much into that one.</p><p>Instead, he turned towards Ventus frantically, hoping for some sort of denial, some sort of continuation that Deadpool was pulling his leg.</p><p>Ventus shrugged.</p><p>"I remember it all. Why do you think I'm so goddamn bitter?"</p><p>Ah hell. Sora was screwed.</p><hr/><p>

Sirius replied.</p><p>Ben considered this.</p><p>"Well, I don't know in story for obvious reasons, but I was originally supposed to be Jacen Solo." Ben spoiled.</p><p>Sirius and Remus exchanged looks.</p><p>"Originally?" They both repeated.</p><p>Ben nodded.</p><p>"Mhm. But, since the Star Wars Universe got Thanos snapped, I'm technically more of an unholy mix of Jacen, Ben Skywalker, and Kylo Ren." Ben continued his spoilers shamelessly.</p><p>Ben Skywalker appeared next to him, a growl on the young Jedi's face.</p><p>"Excuse you, mother Slayer, I ain't you! I'm going to run you through!"</p><p>To this, Ben shrugged.</p><p>"Have at it. In case you forgot, I'm already dead, so you won't actually be doing any damage."</p><p>Sirius turned to Harry, arms crossed and eyebrows raised.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Oh, shut up. Okay, so my Master's got a few faults, but I still like him."</p><p>"Yeah? I liked him too, once upon a time, before he snapped like an elastic band yanked back a mile by sheer force." Ben Skywalker hissed, eyes still locked on the other Ben.</p><p>"Careful, cousin. Keep that up, and you'll end up with glowy golden orbs, just like I did."</p><p>To this, Ben Skywalker responded by igniting his lightsaber and swinging.</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>"Okay, okay, okay. Where the hell am I!" Edward Elric yelled to anyone that would listen. "I showed up in the first chapter! The very first! The first, and I haven't been seen again, even though Truth explicitly brought me in because he thought I might be able to end the conflict!"</p><p>Edward wasn't alone in having only been in a single chapter.</p><p>Dante and Shizuo exchanged looks.</p><p>"Arm wrestling contest?" Dante asked.</p><p>Shizuo considered this before shrugging. Ah, what the hell? Might as well arm wrestle with someone who actually had a sliver of a cheating at beating him.</p><p>"Yeah? At least you didn't get kidnapped by tall, dark, and mask obsessed." Katsuki growled, shooting a glare at Revan.</p><p>Revan was currently in the process of examine his nails. Or pretending to. You can't exactly do that when wearing gloves.</p><p>"Please, I pulled you out of a dangerous situation and proceeded to assault you with plot points and backstory."</p><p>To this, Izuku backed away of Ultimecia.</p><p>Katsuki noticed this and growled at the time witch.</p><p>"If you come anywhere near him, I'm blasting you to pieces, bitch." Katsuki promised. To this, Ultimecia merely smiled.</p><p>Revan sighed, setting down his hand.</p><p>"You already tried that, Katsuki. That's how you died in the last cycle." Revan reminded.</p><p>"Screw you and your cycles. Only I'm allowed to hurt Deku." Katsuki snapped.</p><p>"Kaachan! That's- well, not sweet and a bit fucked up, to be honest, but-"</p><p>"Shut up you shitty ass nerd!" Katsuki bellowed.</p><p>"Tsundere…" someone stage whispered. Katsuki snarled, turning around but not catching who did it.</p><p>"I only it one scene as well." Pride informed Edward. "Be glad you are alone. I was trapped with Kefka for company."</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>"I got killed off and possibly turned into a Regalia, so at least you're alive." Zuko said.</p><p>"Ah, Zuzu, I thought you loved me!" Yato cried dramatically, tossing himself on Zuko's back.</p><p>"Get off, you insane rogue god!" Zuko yelped, trying to push him off.</p><p>"My bankai got shattered by a crazy imp with a skin condition." Ichigo sniffed.</p><p>Rin was not impressed.</p><p>"My soul literally got ripped in half in the last chapter by Utsuro!"</p><p>Ichigo winced. Okay. That one was worse than his Bankai getting broken, but only slightly.</p><p>"I still want to know how you broke my blood bending." Percy turned towards Gintoki.</p><p>"Scouts honor. Can't say." Gintoki shrugged.</p><p>"... you were never a scout!"</p><p>"I was too! You don't know my life!" Gintoki yelled right back.</p><p>"What was coming up next, anyways?" Naruto asked.</p><p>Several blinked. Hm. Where was the story going anyways?</p><p>"Did you not hear me state that my soul got ripped in half?" Rin asked incredulously.</p><p>"Did no one hear me state that Acnologia had devoured Shinryu, therefore becoming a threat to our collective universes?" Young Xehanort reminded them all.</p><p>Zuko shot him a narrow eyed look.</p><p>"You lied to me and orchestrated my death for the sole purpose of getting Aang to do your bidding. I can't take anything you say seriously." Zuko spat.</p><p>"Wait, you did what?!" Aang eyes swerved back and forth between Zuko and Young Xehanort.</p><p>"Well, since none of us will remember this when we go back to our collective stories," Young Xehanort waved a hand, "I set up Zuko's death. And, just to make sure he died properly in case the thralled Warrior of Light didn't do the job properly, I healed him and then had a manakin of you choke the life out of him." the Seeker of Darkness bragged.</p><p>Aang stared at him blankly for several moments.</p><p>"... I'm gonna murder you, period." Aang said, a tremble of barely controlled fury in his voice.</p><p>To this, Young Xehanort raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Are you, young Avatar? Bring me your best."</p><p>"He can heal from bisections. I can attest to this." Yato spoke up.</p><p>Young Xehanort shot him a look of pure venom.</p><p>"You will return my Keyblade, heathen."</p><p>"Nah," Yato said, summoning Twisted Hours and twirling the Keyblade in hand. "I like it. This is mine now."</p><p>A collective shudder ran across the spines of anyone who knew Yato. Hey, can you blame them? The only person that it would be worse to hand over to would be Deadpool.</p><p>"What happens next," a voice interrupted as a dark figure strode towards Naruto, "is I am going to wreck. Your. Shit." Each word was punctuated with a poke to Naruto's chest.</p><p>"Oh yeah? I'd like to see you try, pretty boy." Naruto growled at Caedus.</p><p>The Sith Lord's eyes gleamed.</p><p>"I'm going to butcher you all over my grave site."</p><p>Naruto blinked.</p><p>"Well, that's not morbid at all," Naruto muttered sarcastically.</p><p>"Hey, hey, back it up!" a voice exclaimed before Anakin.2 appeared, pushing the two apart.</p><p>Caedus rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Anakin, stop being a kill sport."</p><p>Anakin.2 glared.</p><p>"Uh uh. No fighting. I even helped put in Ysalamir all over the place to prevent that." Anakin.2 revealed.</p><p>Aang blinked. Ah. That's why he couldn't go Avatar State to rip Young Xehanort a new one. Ysalamir had the annoying ability to produce a power null field. The more you had, the bigger the field.</p><p>To this, Caedus raised an eyebrow. Then, without missing a beat, he swung his right arm out, in the direction on Anakin.2's ever present bodyguard.</p><p>An Amphistaff shot or of the sleeve and went straight at Deadpool.</p><p>"Motherfucker! As if normal snakes aren't bad enough, you wanna set one on me that can't be cut by lightsabers? Not cool, bro!" Deadpool slashed at the creature.</p><p>"Jacen!" Anakin.2 snapped in annoyance.</p><p>Caedus shrugged.</p><p>"What? I'm never defenseless." Caedus said. Then, with a tilt of his head and a pointed look at Naruto, he continued on. "And, I'm still going to wreck ninja boy's shit."</p><p>"Yeah? I'd like to see you try! I won't go down easy!" Naruto yelled.</p><p>To this, Caedus smiled.</p><p>"I don't expect you too, Uzumaki. I don-"</p><p>Caedus was smacked upside the head. Growling, the Sith turned towards the perpetrator.</p><p>Kon rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Stop antagonizing the future Hokage. Come on, I wanna introduce you to my friends in a neutral environment where they won't judge me for befriending a Sith Lord." Kon stated plainly before gripping Caedus arm and dragging him along.</p><p>…</p><p>"Er. What just happened?" Sora asked.</p><p>"I… I'm done. Just done." Anakin.2 sighed.</p><p>"If you're done, can you help me with his snake? I mean, it can't kill me, but I can't exactly heal in this place either!" Deadpool called.</p><p>Oh. Right. That.</p><p>"Never mind! Got it! Bombs away!"</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p>Anakin.2 turned to the sight of Deadpool somehow managing to shove a goddamn grenade into the amphostaff's narrow throat before tossing the creature away. In died in a fiery explosion that left them all covered in snake bits.</p><p>Anakin.2 twitched, unsure of who to blame more: Deadpool, or his idiot brother.</p><p>Lex and Clark watched their son waltz off with the Sith.</p><p>"This is your fault." Clark accused.</p><p>"My fault? You're the reason Kon doesn't listen to even the smallest bit of authority." Lex retaliated.</p><p>"You set the bad example by befriending Revan!" Clark snapped.</p><p>"I did not," Lex denied. "That one shot is still in the drafts, so you can't use that against me until it's published yet! Hell, there isn't a title for it yet."</p><p>To this, Clark sulked.</p><p>"I can't believe you teamed up with a Sith to kill me."</p><p>Lex huffed.</p><p>"Not you. Alternate you. Ultraman deserved it."</p><p>Clark would like to deny this but, really, Ultraman.</p><p>"Still your fault." Clark gestured towards Kon and Caedus.</p><p>Lex did not dignify that with an answer.</p><hr/><p>Hours later, Sora sighed.</p><p>Clean up would be a real bitch. True, they had house elves to help because, hello, Dobby, but still. Villains Vale was a mess, especially considering they'd filled it hundreds, including some alternate versions of some characters, including Sora himself.</p><p>"Ah! This was fun! Although… Sora, you little shit, where are my Chimichangas?"</p><p>Sora turned.</p><p>Deadpool was currently strolling through the place like he owned it, whistling to himself as he twirled one of his katanas above his head. Sora noticed the name Bae embroidered on the blade, shining for all to see.</p><p>Sora sighed, turning around.</p><p>"Cleaning would be a lot easier if we could use magic."</p><p>Which he could not. The ysalamir were still here. They hadn't gotten around to removing them yet, which would be a bitch since they had to bring in literally hundreds of them to keep the guest from doing too much harm to each other.</p><p>Well. Other than Shizuo putting Izaya through a wall. Nothing could have stopped that one from happening.</p><p>"Oh? That! That one's easy peasy, Sky boy." Deadpool said. Sora turned to him, confused.</p><p>Deadpool responded by drawing a pair of pistols, opening wild fire up to the ceiling were the ysalamir had made their nests.</p><p>"Wade! Stop!" Sora cried out.</p><p>Deadpool paused even as magic began to seep back into the general area as about two dozen ysalamir fell from their perches, dead.</p><p>Sora face palmed.</p><p>"Wade! You can't just go around killing your problems!" Sora scolded.</p><p>"Why not? That's exactly what you did to the Organization and the Heartless."</p><p>Sora opened his mouth before closing it again with a snap. Ah hell.</p><p>"That was different."</p><p>To this, Deadpool raised an eyebrow. Somehow. That mask had magical properties. "Oh really! They seem more like helpless creatures to me. Could of be you believe in euthanasia!?"</p><p>Sora would like to deny this, but, to be blunt, that's exactly what he'd been doing every time he killed a Heartless or a Nobody.</p><p>"Anyways," Deadpool turned to shake his fist at the sky. "We didn't get our villains panel! Or the Subject of Memory Section! Or a Supernatural section either! Or an Assassination Classroom one! Or one for Strategic Retreat! This is offensive! Evil! Twisted! Lemon scented!"</p><p>Sora decided then and there and Deadpool and Gintoki could never ever meet. The multiverse would not survived. Nope. Not at all. Anyways, back to cleaning.</p></div>
