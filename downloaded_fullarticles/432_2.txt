    <p>It's been almost two years since the war has ended. Almost one since the <em>Aurors</em> rounded up most of the Death Eaters and almost six months since Ginny and Harry broke things off amicably, citing that they were better friends than lovers. Now, if Harry remembers correctly, she's quite happily dating Luna.</p><p>Harry is eighteen years old, on the cusp of becoming a year older, when he realizes that he doesn't have a clue what he wishes to do with his life.</p><p>It's a rather startling realization that without the war to drive him forward, he has no motivation. He's tried to confide in Hermione or Ron once or twice, but no matter how well he explained it, they didn't understand.</p><p>This wasn't 'just a phase,' or something frivolous – Harry was well and truly lost and more than that, he felt as if there was this large piece of him missing. There was an emptiness in his heart and soul that he couldn't explain away. It had been there his entire life, but the emptiness had only become more pronounced after the war and he was left to fester in his thoughts and in his sorrow.</p><p>There were times where he'd gaze in the mirror and wouldn't recognize the person standing there. There were times he'd dream of people he could barely see or remember when he woke, but he'd still wake with a nostalgia so potent, it sent him reeling every time and had him sobbing into his pillow.</p><p>This to Harry, of course, only solidified the notion that there was something deeply and irrevocably wrong with him. Why would he get so emotional over blurry and faceless strangers in half-remembered dreams? Why did he sometimes fail to recognize himself in the mirror?</p><p>He never found an answer to his questions and refused to confide in Hermione and Ron and further. Though great friends, they were currently in the honeymoon stage of their courtship, and through the lens of their overwhelming happiness, they wouldn't understand Harry's concerns.</p><p>So Harry did his best to ignore the emptiness, the dreams, and he did his best not to look in the mirror. He goes through the motions, smiles when he has to, and avoids contact with friends.</p><p>The emptiness only gets worse.</p><p>But that's alright.</p><p>Harry almost feels like he deserves it.</p>
<hr/><p>Tonight was the weekly Weasley family dinner.</p><p>Ron had been trying to get him to come since he and Ginny had broken things off, but he didn't feel right about coming around anymore. Not because he was still pining after Ginny – but without their relationship to distract him, he'd gotten so much more morose that being in the company of those that were so cheerful (and how could they not be? Fred had astonishingly pulled through after being thought dead, Ron and Hermione were planning to marry, and Bill and Fleur were expecting their second child) simply made it worse.</p><p>But, Ron was Ron, and he refused to take no for an answer. These past few weeks, he'd become increasingly more persistent and last week, he'd almost bodily thrown Harry into the Floo. Though the effort wasn't appreciated, the contact was nice. It'd been nearly six months since anyone had really touched Harry, and the warmth of Ron's hand had grounded him considerably. Harry had almost considered going to the Burrow before he talked himself out of it.</p><p>Harry knew that Ron would simply get more and more stubborn as the weeks passed and Harry didn't want to see what sort of thing Ron had cooked up this week to convince Harry to come to dinner. His efforts last week had almost worked – which wasn't good at all. As far as Harry was concerned, this self-imposed isolation was better for him than being around people. They'd just ask Harry what was wrong and press and press when Harry didn't explain. Either that, or they would ignore him entirely and continue to be nauseatingly happy, which was even worse.</p><p>That was why, this week, Harry left his flat to go for a walk before Ron could arrive and start pestering him. If Harry avoided Ron entirely, then he couldn't be persuaded to go to family dinner at the Weasleys – because despite how much he wanted it, he wasn't family.</p><p>He didn't belong there.</p><p>It's twenty minutes into the walk that Harry regrets his decision. He'd left home without a jacket and in a nearly threadbare t-shirt, not anticipating how cold it would get once night fell. He has half a mind to talk his wand out of his holster and cast a warming charm, the muggles surrounding him be damned, but then he remembers the Statue of Secrecy and banishes the thought. He'd rather battle the cold and slowly freeze than explain to a team of <em>Obliviators</em> why he thought pulling out his wand in front of muggles was a good idea. Besides, the cold isn't too bad.</p><p>It fits his mood rather well.</p><p>He walks for another ten minutes before the street goes mostly empty. Harry checks his surroundings once more. There's only one woman on the other side of the street who looks to be going into a pub and a man in a suit behind him. The man looks vaguely familiar, though Harry ducks his head and begins walking faster before the other man can recognize him. Harry has no desire to be accosted by some acquaintance while out near Muggle London – not while he's doing his best to drown in self-pity and freezing half to death. Because Harry had turned so quickly, he wasn't able to see how the man's eyes had widened at the sight of his face or how he'd frozen in place.</p><p>"... Henrik?"</p><p>The name nearly echoes in the near silence of the street. Farther down the street, a streetlamp flickers once before going dark.</p><p>Although it wasn't his name being called, the grief-stricken tone has him stopping in his tracks, even as the name itself resonates deep inside himself, stirring up vague memories and images, even as he's very sure he's never heard the name before in his life.</p><p>Harry turns around slowly, noting absently that the woman he'd spotted was nowhere to be seen and that must have meant, by default, that the man was speaking to him.</p><p>"That's ... not my name –" Harry says this slowly and hesitantly. The name feels like something out of a half-remembered dream and though he's been a bit out of sorts lately, he's almost positive he knows his own name – and Henrik isn't it.</p><p>(But it<em> is</em>).</p><p>The conflicting feelings of him both trying to deny and respond to the name have his head spinning.</p><p>Once he's fully turned around, he's able to get his first look at the man who called out that name so despondently and distantly he wonders just why short-trimmed hair looks so wrong on the other man. When Harry's words sink in and when Harry shows no recognition upon viewing the man's face the man expression, which had been so hopeful and heartbroken, immediately falls. Somehow that expression makes that near constant emptiness inside his chest<em> ache</em> and Harry flinches, immediately scrambling for something else to say.</p><p>"I-I'm Harry. I'm so sorry - I don't know why I turned around, were you looking for someone?" Something about the man eases the aching emptiness in his soul. Harry wonders why that is. He feels lighter than he has in weeks – maybe <em>months</em> – and it has him feeling flustered and like a kid again. His ears begin burning when he realizes that maybe the man hadn't been calling out to him – and perhaps he'd just prematurely responded to that name that had sounded so familiar when the man was instead calling out to someone else.</p><p>The other man tries to smile, but it comes out more like a grimace and for one absurd moment, Harry's overcome with the urge to push the man's cheek's together to get rid of the unsightly expression and perhaps even make him laugh. Just as Harry finishes pushing down that urge because he's sure that wouldn't go over well, the other man begins to speak.</p><p>"No, no. It's fine. I was … merely reminiscing. You remind me of someone I once knew. I am El–"</p><p>"—ijah." Harry interrupts, the name rushing unbidden from his lips. Just as he opens his mouth to apologize for interrupting so rudely, he sways on his feet, suddenly very dizzy. "Elijah …?" He calls out once more in a voice he can barely recognize as his, as it sounds much younger and very confused.</p><p>The images that had initially come to him the first time the other man – Elijah – called out that name become brighter and brighter behind his eyelids, even as his vision grays and starts to go black around the edges.</p><p>He sways once more and he would've fallen to the ground if Elijah hadn't darted forward to catch Harry in his arms. When Elijah inadvertently brushes his fingers against the exposed nape of Harry's neck, the onslaught of images becomes worse and worse and worse, strange scenarios playing out in the forefront of Harry's mind that somehow feel like his memories. Which is impossible because they feature people Harry is sure he's never before seen in his life.</p><p>"Hen – Harry? Harry ar –"</p><p>Harry doesn't get to hear the rest of what Elijah begins to say, because in that instant everything goes black and he's dragged into a set of memories that aren't his own.</p>
