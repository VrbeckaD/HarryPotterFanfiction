          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Ron and Lavender Weasley's house, they have just come home from the hospital after the birth of their daughter Victoria. Their son Hugo and his wife Lily Luna are visiting.</p><p>Hugo smirked. "After all that fuss over the name Evanora, you went with a normal name after all; mum."</p><p>Lavender said, "I was all set on naming her Evanora, but then I saw her face and decided she didn't suit that name."</p><p>Ron smiled. "I think Victoria is a better fit."</p><p>Lily agreed, "It may be a 'normal name' as Hugo put it, but it's a very pretty name."</p><p>Hugo laughed. "If she's as mad as the rest of this family, her normal name won't matter too much."</p><p>Ron responded, "Her common name is just one part of her. She's going to be a great witch one day, just like her mother."</p><p>Lavender beamed, "Just like Hugo is a great wizard like his father."</p></div>
