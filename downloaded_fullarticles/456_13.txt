    <p>Harry Potter was not having a good week. It was the first week of summer, and it started with him waking up screaming. He dreamt that he was back in the grave yard, Cedric had just been killed by Wormtail. But this time, he lost the dual with Voldemort, and he took over, killing everybody he cared about (in a variety of “creative” ways). After he woke, Hedwig started hooting in a startled way before sharply nipping his ear. “Sorry girl, bad dream” Harry said, while stroking her feathers absentmindedly. “BOY!!! WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS ALL THIS SCREAMING ABOUT!?”, Harry’s uncle Vernon shouted as he stormed up stairs. “YOU START SCREAMING AT TWO IN THE MORNING LIKE YOUR BEING MURDERED, AND I COME UPSTAIRS TO FIND YOU PETTING YOUR DAMN PIGEON LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED!?”, Vernon went on like this for a good five minutes, with the usual threats of punishments (getting beat with a frying ban, disembowelment, the normal stuff) before he realized Harry wasn’t listening. “DON’T YOU IGNORE ME BOY!!”, he shouted. Harry looked up, glasses now in place, and responded “Sorry uncle Vernon, I had a nightmare. Oh! By the way, is it alright if I send a letter to my godfather? I have some questions and Hedwig could use the exercise.” Vernon, now looking scared at the mention of Sirius Black, decided to let it go and give him permission. “Alright, but if any of your freak friends show up, I’ll give you something to have a nightmare about”, Vernon said warningly, and than left the room to go back to sleep. Harry, grateful that he was gone, started writing his letter. He spent about half-an-hour writing it, and when it was done it read: </p><p> </p><p>Dear Padfoot, I hope this letter doesn’t arrive at a bad time, as I am writing this at about 2:30 am. Anyway, I keep having a reoccurring nightmare. I know this probably doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I was wondering if it has any significance for wizards that it normally wouldn’t for muggles. </p><p>P.S.: I’ve been wondering if there’s anyway to get my hands on an animagus potion (I want something to distract me from what happened last year) also, send your replay to the Leaky Cauldron, as I’m going to stay in Diagonal alley for a few days, than probably see if I can spend a few weeks at the burrow with the Weasllys.</p><p>Thanks, Harry P.</p><p>Harry tied the letter to Hedwig’s leg. “Take this to Sirius. Love you and be careful, don’t let anyone see you”. Hedwig hooted in a reassuring tone, and nipped his finger affectionately, before taking off. Harry immediately started packing, and than wrote a note explaining his absence and left it sitting on the kitchen table.</p><p>———2 hours later———</p><p>Harry staggered into the Leaky Cauldron, wishing that the Knight Buss wasn’t the only way here without walking. “Welcome to the Leaky Cauldron, what can I do for ya?”, a large man with an American accent asked. “Can I have a room for a week please?”, Harry asked and gave the man the money. “Right this way, you’re in room 28 on the second floor. Would you like some room service?”, the man asked. “No, thank you”, Harry answered the man. When he got to his room, he put his stuff away, and got into bed, tired and exhausted. He hoped Hedwig was finding her way alright.</p>
