    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
<p><em>“I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,</em><br/>
<em>or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:</em><br/>
<em>I love you as one loves certain obscure things,</em><br/>
<em>secretly, between the shadow and the soul.”</em></p>
<p>-<br/>
1 SEPTEMBER 1971</p>
<p>Severus did not want to be here.</p>
<p>The platform 9 ¾ was loud, crowded, bright and bustling - everything the boy hated, all in one place. A babbling mother herded her children past him, nearly knocking him over in her haste. Scowling, Severus clutched his trunk a little closer to his person.</p>
<p>His heart fluttered anxiously in his chest. As eager as he was to be starting a new chapter of his life, Severus felt unbearably overwhelmed. How was he to proceed without his frail mother’s guidance? He had no friends, no prior experience - and if there was one thing Severus hated the most, it was walking into something blind.</p>
<p>The Hogwarts Express released a shrill whistle as it pulled up to the platform, steam hissing from the brakes. The noise and intensity reached a crescendo around him as parents frantically waved their children off with tearful goodbyes, handkerchiefs pressed to their faces. Severus grimaced at the sight and sighed silently. Tugging his belongings along with him, he sullenly boarded the train.</p>
<p>The train was as garishly bright on the inside as it was on the outside, much to his chagrin. Bright light filtered in through the large windows, casting a warm glow on the plush velvet seats. The corridor was long and cramped, its carpeted floors muting his footfalls and the light scraping of his trunk against the ground. </p>
<p>Severus made haste towards an empty compartment once he saw more children filtering in, not wanting to be caught in the current. He slid the door shut behind him in a hurry, and sighed again. That was all he seemed to be doing today.</p>
<p>Once he’d calmed enough, Severus made quick work of setting down his things and taking a seat. Reaching into the folds of his cloak, he pulled out a book. ‘Elide Ember’s Anthology of Enchanting Tales’, it was called. Normally this would be a far cry from his usual taste in reading (he preferred textbooks to fairy tales, thank you very much) but this book was special. His mother had gifted it to him the night before his departure, a twinkle in her normally solemn blue eyes.</p>
<p>“I took this book with me on my first journey to Hogwarts,” she had whispered, gently pressing it to his chest. “It had been a dear friend to me then. Now it can be one to you.”</p>
<p>The cover crackled with age as he pulled it open. His slim hand traced over the message that was neatly written on the cover page.</p>
<p><em>To my Dearest Prince -</em><br/>
<em>You will be the greatest wizard Hogwarts has ever seen.</em><br/>
<em>Travel safely, my love, and remember;</em><br/>
<em>Perseverance is the key to any locked door.</em><br/>
<em>- Mother</em></p>
<p>Filled with renewed determination, Severus held the book close to his heart and turned his gaze towards the window as the train began to pull away from the platform with one last shrill whistle.</p>
<p>He would excel in his studies and graduate from Hogwarts with flying colours as a fully-fledged wizard. As soon as he gained his Master's status in potion-making, he would rescue his mother from the dismal hellhole he was raised in and would provide her with enough comfort to live out the rest of her days, away from hardships and her husband.</p>
<p>Yes. Severus no longer felt that he was going in blind now. He had a goal now, and nothing could stop him from reaching it.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
