    <p>
  <span>Credence didn’t know when it’d started.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s what he’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>like </span>
  </em>
  <span>to say because that’s how all stories like this should go, shouldn’t they? Innocent interest transforming into confusing feelings of the heart thrusting him into situations totally unexpected way before he could fully realize or understand what was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But no, he remembered exactly when this all started. This… </span>
  <em>
    <span>obsession</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>September 4th, 2018.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only a couple of months ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence had been lounging in his favorite coffee shop, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Common Grounds Café</span>
  </em>
  <span>, with a — frankly — sinfully delicious cappuccino cupped between his scarred hands. The cotton cloud foam, the heat radiating through his fingers, and the perfect amount of cinnamon sprinkled on top. Credence had never been to heaven, but he was pretty certain it was quite similar to this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been raining all afternoon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albeit typical of the English weather around this time of year, he still had yet to grow accustomed to the bitter gloom; so, he slipped on his maroon sweater and pulled up his knobby knees underneath, warming his bones with milky foam and espresso.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened his backpack and pulled out his tablet, scrolling his way through his WitchBook feed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were updates on the latest American Quidditch match that had immediately caught his attention and he was thrilled to discover that his favorite team, the</span>
  <em>
    <span> Sarasota Skunk Apes</span>
  </em>
  <span>, had won against all odds. With their defeat of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jersey Devils</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the Florida underdogs were riding the wave of victory all the way to nationals where they would competing for their right to play in the World Tournament. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Good for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence continued scrolling through his feed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That new food vlogger that he’d recently followed had posted a new video on how to make her famous Cheerly Chili and, right underneath it, was a political takedown post about his father’s recent speech against—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pressed play on the chili video, nearly shattering the screen in the process.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even as Cheryl Carmilla Cheerly described how to find the best tomatoes to use for oven-roasting, Credence found himself… distracted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Corvus LeStrange had never really been a father to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he meant that </span>
  <em>
    <span>literally.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently, Credence was Corvus’ long-lost son that had been kidnapped from his mother’s arms by a religious zealot on her deathbed when she had been visiting family in upstate New York. Underneath Mary Lou’s stern rule, he had thus grown up knowing nothing about the outside world except for the Bible and the Divine Word of the Lord. To think, Credence had thought he’d been </span>
  <em>
    <span>adopted.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It had only been after an impressive Obscurial burst that leveled half of New York that the magical community had rediscovered the missing LeStrange heir.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence had lost his family. He had lost all sense of his identity. After 24 hours of suffering underneath a never-ending cascade of loss, he had found himself whisked away to Paris having lost his</span>
  <em>
    <span> name.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>And if that hadn’t been nearly enough, he had inherited a fortune and a </span>
  <em>
    <span>legacy</span>
  </em>
  <span> that he’d never wanted with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dining on expensive Almas caviar coated in edible gold with pan-seared duck and a glass of Chateau Margaux every night seemed too luxurious. Hiring maids and butlers, chefs and limo drivers seemed like pointless expenses. Needing all of the latest fashions, the finest jewels, and the fastest broom in the world despite never actually using it more than </span>
  <em>
    <span>once</span>
  </em>
  <span> seemed a waste.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence was content with a single-bedroom apartment. He was content with having enough groceries in the fridge to not go hungry. He was content with electricity that didn’t flicker off every time the trains barreled past. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so, resulting from the societal pressures to integrate his son into the company while also compensating for his… predispositions, Corvus had inducted Credence as the division head of charitable distributions at LeStrange Enterprises. Despite not knowing much about the world of business, Credence had quietly embraced his role. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was always on the lookout for new places to throw money at. He was always searching for struggling people to save, to give a </span>
  <em>
    <span>fighting chance </span>
  </em>
  <span>in a world designed to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps this way, Credence could become the Guardian Angel that he’d always wanted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s when he’d found it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Adopt Them: Senior Creature Sanctuary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time he’d finished the next sip of his cappuccino, Credence had opened up his FundFriend App and made a sizable donation to the non-profit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anonymously, of course.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a freedom to be found in making charitable donations that came from his own bank account compared to the company’s. There were far less people to run the idea through. There was even far less publicity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As a private citizen, Credence could support whomever he wanted without worrying about the media spotlight shining down upon him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Besides, how could he have ever resisted those soulful midnight black eyes of the Niffler and his salt-and-pepper fur, wrapped up in an old yellow-and-gray scarf like a blanket?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the title overhead : Sweetpea, Honorary Hufflepuff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His name was</span>
  <em>
    <span> Sweetpea.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>From that rainy day forward, the Senior Creature Sanctuary had become an obsession—an </span>
  <em>
    <span>addiction</span>
  </em>
  <span>. With every new post, photo, and update, Credence pulled up his FundFriend app and pressed </span>
  <em>
    <span>send</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snidgets nesting in empty Jack-o-Lanterns in October? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sent.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hippogriffs sleeping on their backs with their tongues lolling out and little toes twitching in November? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sent.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Chupacabras wearing snazzy bedazzled Santa hats in December? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sent. Sent. Sent!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Thousands upon thousands of Galleons transferred from his account into theirs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence adored those creatures like his own family. Seeing all the renovations to the Sanctuary’s grounds and all the much-needed medical care that he’d funded had warmed his heart. The ever-mysterious owners of the non-profit had made a public post thanking their mysterious benefactor for their generosity once they’d figured out what was going on and would update more and more frequently with how they’d spent his money.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A new sweater (or rather, what they called a</span>
  <em>
    <span> jumper</span>
  </em>
  <span>) for Mashed Potato the Opaleye Dragon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fluffy pillows to sleep on for Sweetpea the Niffler.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Insulin for Tofu the Hippogriff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every update brought Credence joy. Every photo made him smile. Every creature that he helped feel a little more comfortable in their old age and every donation he sent filled a little more and more of that gaping hole in his heart and made him feel… alive. It made this life feel just a bit more bearable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then came the</span>
  <em>
    <span> incident.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence had been scrolling through his WitchBook feed after a long day of managing funds at his father’s company when a notification popped up at the corner of his screen stating that the Senior Creature Sanctuary had a new post.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Expecting cute pictures of magical creatures, he’d pressed on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And came face-to-face with a </span>
  <em>
    <span>man.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A man freckled to oblivion. A man with a shy yet charmingly dopey grin. A man with the most beautiful green eyes that he had ever seen, and he was cradling a Bowtruckle against his chest.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Pickett refused to leave Mummy’s side today. Had to bribe him with blueberries back onto his perch. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Cheeks burning and heart pounding inside his chest, Credence had pulled up his FundFriend app in a frenzy and made another donation, double the usual amount.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t understood what was happening at first. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, that’s another lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had understood </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly</span>
  </em>
  <span> what was going on. He knew why his face burned. He knew why his mouth had suddenly run dry. He knew why his heart was threatening to burst out his chest with every</span>
  <em>
    <span> th-thump, th-thump, th-thump</span>
  </em>
  <span>; but, the difference was… he had refused to acknowledge it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, he’d started including notes on every donation. Somehow, he found himself growing discontent with remaining anonymous. Somehow, what had begun as an innocent sponsorship had turned into something </span>
  <em>
    <span>more.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d started inquiring about the Bowtruckles and the Occamies. He commented on how well the new barnyard renovations were turning out. He asked about the Kelpie that they’d recently adopted out and about the new Cockatrice that they had subsequently brought in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, one day, Credence asked about the owner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Much to his surprise, he’d</span>
  <em>
    <span> responded.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>With every update came an answer to a question he’d posed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The primary owner, the man with the freckled face and dopey grin, was named Newt and he ran the Senior Creature Sanctuary with his older brother Theseus. Newt was the more hands-on of the two by far, providing their creature tenets with the utmost care and comfort, while also maintaining the Sanctuary’s WitchBook page and general social media presence. Theseus, on the other hand, worked behind the scenes and managed the books.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a little bit of prodding, Credence had discovered that Newt heralded from a firm background in magizoology. He had pioneered research in the field and had almost single-handedly thrust magizoology into popularity. He had even written a book. After spending so much time in the limelight, however, he had decided to draw back for a while and created the Senior Creature Sanctuary for the elderly and infirm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence followed these rare updates with an eagerness he had never known before, that not-so-mysterious feeling that he’d refused to acknowledge growing more and more with each and every update.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to know more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted a better connection with Newt, and yet…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, he was the infamous Corvus LeStrange the 5th — heir to LeStrange Enterprises. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything Credence did was up to public scrutiny. His name as Corvus LeStrange was far too recognizable and, depending on who you asked, held some rather unsavory connotations to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even his own </span>
  <em>
    <span>visage</span>
  </em>
  <span> was safe. After having flattened half of New York and killed thousands, no matter how unintentional, it didn’t matter where Credence went. Corvus LeStrange the 5th or Credence Barebone, no matter what name he chose, he would always be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>monster.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>This was too complicated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shouldn’t even be entertaining the thought of—of—of—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, late one January evening in his office after everyone had already long since gone home for the night, Credence had pulled up his WitchBook account. His scarred fingers, the ever constant reminder of the life he’d once live, hovered over the keyboard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took in a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And opened up the chat window to the Senior Creature Sanctuary.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Hello.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Not even two seconds later came a response.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Good Evening! Are you interested in adopting one of our senior creatures or sponsoring the sanctuary?</em>
    </b>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence bit his lower lip, heart pounding.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>If you had wanted me to add an extra zero to my donations, Newt, all you needed to do was ask.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>ashdFASGDHagsdhfjhkj</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Are you okay?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Yes! Yes! Perfectly fine. I just uh… banged my head against the computer.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence blinked, fingers hovering yet unable to dictate a response to such… cuteness.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>But, nevermind that ahahaha.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>It’s you! I’m so sorry I didn’t realize...</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Thank you so much for your contributions. We here at the Senior Creature Sanctuary really appreciate your sponsorship.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence smiled and shook his head.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>It’s my pleasure. I see that Green Bean is enjoying her new pen.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Oh yes! Very much so! Far more field for her to work out those old bones of hers.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I’m glad.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>And you? Are you doing well?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Me?</em>

  </p>
  <p>
    <em>

  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Yes?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>You post a lot about the creatures— which I enjoy! Really! But I rarely hear about you unless I ask. Why is that?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Oh.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Newt didn’t respond for an entire minute and Credence feared that he’d crossed the line.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>I just feel that… </em>
    </b>

    <b>
      <em>I don’t know.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>I suppose, I’m just not that… interesting? </em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>You see, I’m just so passionate about my creatures. I rarely get to talk about them with others that appreciate them like do. Whenever I’m online, I’m immersed in a community of my peers and sometimes I feel that…</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>Well…</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>I’m not that well-composed in real-life. </em>

      <span>Neither am I. Neither is anyone.</span>

      <em>You underestimate my ineptitude.</em>
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Is that a challenge?</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence pursed his lips together, fingers flying faster than he could process what he was about to offer.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Meet me at Common Grounds Café this Saturday at 3:30 PM. Back corner by the bookshelf. There should be two booth seats.</span>

      <em>You live here, oh mysterious benefactor? How come I never knew that?</em>

  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>And… this is technically our first real conversation.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence laughed, typing with one hand now as the other covered his face.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>O—oh… right. </em>
    </b>

    <em>
      <span>Hmm, I suppose our date on Saturday will determine that.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence’s flushed deeper than the crimson tie that he had decided to wear that morning. Where was all this sudden confidence coming from. He never flirted with anyone. Ever.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>
      <em>…date?</em>

  <p>
    <em>
      <span>No, that’s not what this is.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>Credence’s face was burning hotter than a blazing inferno. It was this moment right here that he appreciated the relative safety of sitting behind a computer screen because, otherwise, he’d likely be making even more of a complete and utter fool of himself.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>

<p></p><blockquote>

  <span>Was he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Could Credence possibly reveal such… devastating information so soon? Sure, they were (maybe? hopefully?) going to meet later that week and, from the simple act of seeing his face, Newt could put two-and-two together quite quickly—oh god, what if this was all a horrible decision? What if he didn’t like him? What if he recognized the family he belonged or his exploits in New York and fled? What if he went to the public? What if he stopped talking to him?</span>
</p>

  <span>Somehow, as he signed off for the night and grabbed his briefcase with an extra pep in his step, Credence knew that no matter what happened… everything was going to be alright. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After all, he had a date on Saturday.</span>
