          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Fred and Hermione Weasley's house. Their only child Rose is away on her very first sleepover at her cousins' house and the house is quiet.</p><p>Hermione said, "This is nice, the peace and quiet I mean."</p><p>Fred muttered, "Isn't it unusual, though?"</p><p>Hermione admitted, "A bit."</p><p>Fred frowned. "Our little Rosie pie is growing up so quickly, Mione. I'm scared that if I take my eyes off her for even just one second, she'll be getting married and leaving us forever."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "She's only five!"</p><p>Fred sighed. "You know what I meant."</p><p>Hermione replied, "I've been thinking the same thing lately, but Freddie, that won't happen any time soon."</p><p>Fred put her arm around him and told her, "I know, but time is slipping through our fingers since she was born. I don't want to lose her like you almost lost me."</p><p>Hermione asked, "Have you been worrying about that for a while?"</p><p>Fred nodded.</p><p>Hermione reassured him, "You're not going anywhere and neither am I or Rosie for that matter, Freddie. "</p><p>Fred smiled slightly. "This is why we work so well, you're the calm, level headed one and I'm the funny one who hides his worries."</p><p>Hermione laughed. "I'm not always calm."</p><p>Fred nuzzled her neck and whispered, "You're always calmer and ten times smarter than me, Mione."</p><p>Hermione grinned. "We're all alone for one night, but do you know what that means?"</p><p>Fred smirked. "Netflix and chill as your dear old Muggle relatives say?"</p><p>Hermione snorted. "Where on Earth did you hear that?"</p><p>Fred shrugged. "Your cousin Stephanie."</p><p>Hermione beamed, "Well, you are right. Let's take this to the bedroom my shining knight in armour."</p><p>Fred insisted, "After you, my damsel in distress."</p></div>
