    <p align="justify">“You told me you were clean.”</p><p align="justify">Seraphina is sitting behind her desk, back straight and hands demurely crossed, one on top of the other, as she stares down her Director of Security, sat across from her.</p><p align="justify">It is not an uncommon picture. They have sat across from each other, in this same room, countless of times, to discuss every topic imaginable. From high security threats to MACUSA, to the latest piece of gossip making the rounds across Woolworth building. Percival usually feels as comfortable sitting in Seraphina’s visitor chair as he does in his own office. And yet, today, he cannot help but fidget anxiously. The chair suddenly feels too small, the room too hot, and Seraphina’s eyes are as cold as ice.</p><p align="justify">“When I asked you to run with me as my vice-president, you told me you were clean. That there was nothing Osmander or his lackeys would be able to use against you. ‘I’m Director of Magical Security, Seraphina. I’m cleaner than all those pathetic politicians scurrying around Congress, Seraphina. Pick me, Seraphina. Trust me, Seraphina’. Well, look how good that turned out!”</p><p align="justify">Percival raises a hand to try and stall Seraphina’s angry speech. “Ser-”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not finished, Percival.” She snaps. Percival glares at her but brusquely motions for her to continue. He reclines back in his chair as he mentally curses the idiotic ambition that made him decide to get further involved in politics. No one had ever <em> dared </em>to question him as Director of Magical Security. As long as criminals got caught and no-majs were kept unaware of the existence of anything remotely magic, no one had ever cared.</p><p align="justify">The moment Seraphina had announced he would be running with her in the forthcoming election, his whole career seemed to have come into question. It seemed politics had a way of making all kinds of shit float to the surface.</p><p align="justify">“This may not have been something you needed to care about as Director. But this is politics, Percival. Our voters may not give a damn about who the Director of Magical Security brings to their bed, but you can bet your ass they will care about their future unmarried Vice-President sleeping around with some mysterious woman!”</p><p align="justify">Seraphina finishes her tirade by, once again, trusting the latest edition of <em> New York’s Ghost </em> towards Percival. The titular on the front page stares mockingly back at him:</p><p align="justify">
  <em> Director Graves’ Torrid Affair: Sources in Mr. Osmander office claim to be in possession of incriminating pictures of Vice-President Candidate Mr. Percival Graves and a Mysterious Lover. </em>
</p><p align="justify">“Our insider at the <em> Ghost </em>says they will be publishing the pictures tomorrow” Percival turns his attention away from the newspaper and back to Seraphina. She is now sat back tiredly, her massive chair seeming to almost drown her. The anger is gone from her voice and just a monotone weariness remains. “Apparently, they are quite scandalous. Indecent, even. They may need to charm them to avoid upsetting any sensibilities”</p><p align="justify">“How considerate of them” quips Percival, idly playing with the newspaper’s pages.</p><p align="justify">“Why didn’t you tell me you were seeing someone?” Seraphina asks tiredly “We could have worked around it, you know. I wouldn’t have kept you from seeing her, Merlin knows it’s about time you start showing interest in someone not involved in criminal activities. We could have told the papers about your relationship-”</p><p align="justify">“Our <em> Torrid Affair </em>, you mean” interrupts Percival, his finger outlining the words on the paper.</p><p align="justify">“Percival” When he glances up Seraphina is staring at him, a sad smile on her lips. “Who is this woman? You need to tell me. We can still get ahead of this, but we need to get our story straight. Our team can spin it”</p><p align="justify">He sighs.</p><p align="justify">“There is no woman”</p><p align="justify">“<em> Percival -” </em>he raises a hand to forestall Seraphina’s angry retort. He takes a deep breath and steels himself.</p><p align="justify">“My <em> Mysterious Lover </em>is a man.”</p><p align="justify">“Ah”</p><p align="justify">“Indeed.”</p><p align="justify">They stand there, looking at each other, as the truth sits awkwardly between them. Seraphina attempts a reassuring smile, but it comes out feeble and strained. She has never been the sensitive and comforting type. Neither of them are. It is the reason they have always gotten along so well in the first place. Work first, social niceties later, and intimacies, hopefully, never.</p><p align="justify">“Is there a spin?”</p><p align="justify">Seraphina startles “Beg your pardon?”</p><p align="justify">“To the story. Is there a spin, even if my lover is a man?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh. Yes, sure.” Seraphina straightens up immediately. With the initial surprise done and over with, her brain is already sorting through potential scenarios, trying to determine if Percival’s newly revealed sexual preferences are likely to damage her campaign “It may ruffle a few feathers with some of the old families, sure. Older folks, mostly. And it’s not like we were very popular with them to begin with. Your brother has thankfully ensured there’s a new generation of Graves to pass on the name. No one can object to you finding yourself a nice gentleman to have fun with. As long as he doesn’t have any unfulfilled obligations to his family-”</p><p align="justify">“He is a no-maj” interrupts Percival.</p><p align="justify">Seraphina blinks slowly at the new bit of information. Opens her mouth, closes it, screws her eyes tightly shut and takes a deep breath. And then, she explodes.</p><p align="justify">“A no-maj!? Are you mad?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, I suspect he may actually be a Squib” He rapidly amends, and then, because he has never believed in delaying uncomfortable situations more than absolutely necessary, he adds “He is twenty four”</p><p align="justify">“Twenty-? Twenty Four?!” Seraphina screeches, before she seems to remember her position and collects herself. Her fingers steepled in front of her nose, she stares Percival down and repeats “Twenty four. Merlin, Percival. That’s a <em> kid </em>  we are talking about. He’s almost half your age”</p><p align="justify">“Trust me, Seraphina, I’m well aware of that fact”</p><p align="justify">“Really?” her tone is disbelieving.</p><p align="justify">“Why do you think I kept it quiet?” He hisses.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know why you even started it in the first place!” replies Seraphina, kicking her chair back to pace angrily around the office. “You are a good man, Percival. Admittedly not always the best company, yes, but you are handsome enough that most men would be willing to overlook any personality faults. Merlin’s balls, you are loaded! It cannot have been that hard to find someone, even with your lack of anything resembling a social life. Where did you even find a no-maj, anyway?”</p><p align="justify">“Work. He’s with the Second Salemers”</p><p align="justify">“Morgana’s tits”</p><p align="justify">“Look, Seraphina, this thing it’s- It’s not serious. It was supposed to be just some harmless fun-”</p><p align="justify">“Do you actually hear yourself? ‘Some harmless fun’. Why couldn’t you just get a good whore, like a normal person, if all you wanted was to scratch an itch?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m just saying, we can obliviate him. I had Tina fetch him and take him to a secure location the moment the news broke. Just one spell and-”</p><p align="justify">“And what? It’s bad enough people will think you are some kind of depraved Lothario, I don’t need them thinking you are a callous asshole on top of that.” A pause “You said Auror Goldstein is with him?”</p><p align="justify">“They should be in a room at the Ansonia, right now”</p><p align="justify">Seraphina closes her eyes and takes a long breath. “Good. That’s good. We may be able to control the damage yet.” She looks back at him “Do you trust Goldstein?”</p><p align="justify">Percival thinks back to Tina Goldstein standing in his office three months ago, her auror career hanging on the line, begging him to ‘Please, sir, just make sure the boy is okay.’ Percival knows he could have fired her that day, and she would not have even complained as long as he had promised to check on the boy.</p><p align="justify">(She kept her job, of course, but that had way less to do with her decision making skills than with Percival trying to cover his own hypocrisy)</p><p align="justify">“She won’t do anything to hurt the boy” That much he knows for sure. A day before he could have also relied on Tina’s badly disguised hero worship of him, but he has the feeling she will not think so highly of him now. Not after she discovers the nature of his involvement with Credence, anyways.</p><p align="justify">“How much does she know?”</p><p align="justify">“Very little. She asked me to look after Credence after that messy affair with the Second Salemers a few months back”</p><p align="justify">“Her one woman assault. I remember, she ought to have been demoted for that. So you… and the boy…”</p><p align="justify">“It started then, yes” Percival avoids looking at Seraphina. The back of his neck feels hot with embarrassment. He has always been a private person by nature, having to recount the history of his latest affair to his superior officer is beyond humiliating. He knows how the whole thing looks. Knows he should have ended things the moment the Campaign started. Should not have even started them, as Seraphina pointed out.</p><p align="justify">And yet.</p><p align="justify">It had all been so... easy. Credence had been blissfully unaware of everything. MACUSA, Percival’s job, his reputation, the Graves’ nameline… To him Percival had just been a rather wealthy gentleman willing to offer him some much needed comfort. Credence did not demand expensive gifts or political favours, he did not complain if Percival was late or missed one their meetings, he just gratefully took what was offered and gave everything he had back in return.</p><p align="justify">Percival can readily admit he may have taken more than his fair share. Too blinded by the easy convenience of their arrangement. And now he had brought Credence into the middle of a Wizarding political thunderstorm.</p><p align="justify">“You mentioned he may be a Squib?” Seraphina questions, cutting short his musings. “Isn’t his mother the actual leader of the Second Salemers?”</p><p align="justify">“He is adopted. And I couldn’t say for sure. On occasions I could swear there’s a spark in him, but most of the time I can’t really feel anything”</p><p align="justify">“Have you considered getting him tested?”</p><p align="justify">“Of course I have” complains Percival. His track record may not be stellar where Credence is concerned, but he still is Director of Magical Security. A potential Squib being left for adoption by a religious fanatic hellbent on exposing their community is not something to ever be taken lightly ”I submitted a request a month ago to the Registry”</p><p align="justify">“And?” prompts Seraphina.</p><p align="justify">“And I’m still waiting for the results. You know how things work at the Registry.”</p><p align="justify">“I will get the request analyzed. We need to know for sure if he is a Squib or a no-maj before we proceed. Here, write down the details of the request” she demands handing Percival a spare scroll and quill. As he starts writing she quickly charms two paper mice and sends them off with a quick wave of her wand. Presumably to summon her crisis cabinet “Now, let me tell you what we’ll do.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify">Here is what they do.</p><p align="justify">Seraphina’s three advisors show up at her office not five minutes later. They sit down, listen and take notes, as Seraphina briefs them on the situation and outlines the plan of action.</p><p align="justify">They also silently judge Percival and his life choices from all across the room.</p><p align="justify">Covignton is promptly dispatched to deal with the Registry and their pathological inability to complete requests in a timely manner. Apparently he knows a witch, who knows a wizard, who knows someone who may be able to get the testing done by midnight.</p><p align="justify">Villanueva and Bowler are set to write the official statement. Both versions of it.</p><p align="justify">(“If the boy turns out to be a no-maj, you will admit to a severe lack of judgement” explains Seraphina “Say you were blinded by love, and will break things off to preserve the Statute of Secrecy. The boy will, of course, be obliviated by our best aurors, and you will be properly devastated at the loss of your star-crossed love. All very tragic. Hopefully the tragedy will gain you back some sympathy with the voters.”</p><p align="justify">“And if the boy turns out to be a Squib?”</p><p align="justify">“So much better for us. We can play it as a major fault of the previous administration, failing to properly look after a child of magic descent. You will be the heroic rescuer who sensed the boy’s magic and fought to get him reinstated to his rightful place in our world. More romantic, and with a happy ending. The public will eat it up. And it will take the attention away from the more sordid details of the story, and towards Squib protection policies.”)</p><p align="justify">Finally, Percival and Seraphina are left with the most crucial task: getting Credence’s collaboration.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">They owl Tina who agrees to meet with them on the Astonia’s lobby. Her answering note is brief, professional and completely unlike any other note she has ever sent before. Percival can almost feel the disappointment emanating from the words. All sharp, efficient lines, with none of the usual flourishes that use to make their way into Tina’s handwriting.</p><p align="justify">The knowledge that he has lost Tina’s respect, if not her loyalty, ranks on him. For the first time all day he truly starts to appreciate the impact this scandal will have on his life. He angrily stuffs the note on his coat pocket and stalks towards the apparition point</p><p align="justify">“I take it your favourite protégé was not too happy to learn you had been sodomizing that poor boy behind her back” questions Seraphina as soon as they both apparate on an alley behind the Astonia.</p><p align="justify">“Sodo - Merlin, do you need to be so crass?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, so now you decide to get all moralistic”</p><p align="justify">Percival stops walking and turns back to look at his colleague. Seraphina stands her ground, head held high and glaring defiantly at him. There lines around her mouth are pulled tighter than usual. Seraphina has always been better than him at keeping a cold head on any situation, but it seems the events of the day are finally catching up with her as well. It may have been naive of him to think the reveal had not upset her in the slightest.</p><p align="justify">Percival sighs “There has been no sodomizing” Seraphina arches an eyebrow in response. He coughs awkwardly and elaborates. “That is, I- We- We haven’t- Not that. It’s been mostly…” He makes a quick, abrupt gesture with his hand to demonstrate, too embarrassed to form the words “You know…”</p><p align="justify">“I Know?” Seraphina’s reply is tinted with amusement. She imitates his gesture, and promptly breaks out laughing. “Merlin’s beard, Percival! Don’t tell me you had an affair with a boy half your age and didn’t even make it past a handjob.”</p><p align="justify">Percival hunches his shoulders and locks his jaw, looking pointedly at the floor. He can feel his ears burning. He wonders if there will be anything left of his dignity by the time this whole affair is over.</p><p align="justify">A hand on his shoulder makes him look up again. “Well, now. Let’s go meet this boy of yours.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tina is waiting for them in the lobby, as promised. She politely welcomes Seraphina and dispenses with a curt and cold “Sir” for Percival. He tries not to show how much her small dismissal upsets him.</p><p align="justify">Tina leads them up the elevator and through the elegant corridors of the hotel in complete silence, her steps brisk and purposeful, muffled by the soft carpet.</p><p align="justify">Percival opens his mouth several times to try an explain his actions, but ends up closing it before any sound can come out. Tina finally stops in front of  a room and  fiddles with the keys to open the door. Once opened, she steps aside and motions for them to go inside. She, very pointedly, does not look at him.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry” Percival hears himself whisper as he hovers at the doorway.</p><p align="justify">Tina’s jaw clenches in response “What for, sir?”</p><p align="justify">His mouth opens. Closes again. He tries to catch her gaze, but Tina is resolutely glaring at the carpet.</p><p align="justify">“For letting his dick do all the thinking” snaps Seraphina as she brushes past them and into the room. Tina’s head snaps up in surprise and she stares at her President scandalized. Percival grits his teeth together and reminds himself that lashing out at Seraphina will not help anything. “Now, do keep up. We have work to do. You can deal with the revelation that Graves is not, in fact, made from Justice and Righteousness on your own time.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, Ma’am” replies Tina as she scurries into the room, softly calling out for Credence and letting him know Mr. Graves and a very important visitor have arrived. Percival closes the door and follows in after her, only stopping to throw a very ineffectual glare in Seraphina’s direction.</p><p align="justify">Credence is sitting in a plush chair in one corner of the room. His hair looks freshly washed for once, and his face is flushed pink from warmth. He is wearing no-maj pajamas and drowning in a thick dressing robe. Probably Tina’s work.</p><p align="justify">His face lights up like a fucking Christmas tree when he spots Percival standing in the doorway.</p><p align="justify">“Credence” salutes Percival, as he sits down in an armchair opposite him “I’m very sorry for all this… hassle. As Miss Goldstein may have told you something… unexpected came up”</p><p align="justify">“She told me we had to wait for you here” murmurs Credence. He smiles timidly at Percival, while darting nervous glances at Seraphina, who has been hanging back and is currently examining a no-maj lamp with an appraising eye. “Ms. Goldstein has been very nice to me.” declares Credence, voice tinged with the wonder, as if baffled by the fact “We ordered pancakes for lunch and she got me these clothes”</p><p align="justify">He shots a quick, awkward smile at Tina who eagerly returns a warm one of her own, before she immediately goes back to glaring holes at Percival’s head.</p><p align="justify">“Good, that’s... good” Percival looks down at his hands, unsure of how to proceed. Credence’s knowledge of the Wizarding World and Percival’s own role within it is spotty at best. During their whole affair Percival had been either too mindful of Rappaport’s Law or too horny to indulge Credence’s curiosity about all things magical.</p><p align="justify">He does not even know how to begin explaining the whole mess to him.</p><p align="justify">“Now, about the reason Tina brought you here… Something happened. And I’ll need your help to deal with it”</p><p align="justify">“My help?” questions Credence. “I don’t understand… is it something to do with Ma?”</p><p align="justify">“No, no, nothing to do with that woman. This is slightly more… personal”</p><p align="justify">“We need you to become Percival’s fiancée” interrupts Seraphina from the back of the room.</p><p align="justify">“F-fiancée?” squawks Credence, his face going an alarming shade of red.</p><p align="justify">“<em>Fiancée?!” </em>shrieks Tina, raising her wand and moving to stand between Credence and her superior officers.</p><p align="justify">Percival pinches his brow.</p><p align="justify">“There’s been a leak on the press” continues Seraphina ignoring both Credence’s embarrassed meltdown and Tina’s angry huff. “Photos of sexual nature involving you and Mr. Graves.”</p><p align="justify">Credence goes from red to white, and right back to red in an instant. Fear and embarrassment chasing themselves across his face. He opens and closes his mouth several times, no sound coming out. Finally, embarrassment seems to win out and he curls into himself, hands over his eyes, head between raised knees, and lets out a sound like that of a dying animal.</p><p align="justify">Tina, in the meantime, seems to be seconds away from cursing him and earning herself a one-way ticket to unemployment.</p><p align="justify">“Any other time, I would let Percival deal with the mess on his own.” explains Seraphina, moving to stand at Percival’s back and fixing him with a very pointed glare “But it’s an election year and I made the regrettable choice of picking him as my future Vice-President, so now his reputation is tied up with mine. Seeing how I have absolutely no intention of losing this election, I’m left with no alternative but to fix this.”</p><p align="justify">“A secret engagement is the best solution we could come up with in such short notice. It will lessen the scandalous nature of the pictures and may help us on the long run by softening Percival’s image. Once the election is over we can arrange a discreet and amicable break up. What do you say, Mr. Barebone, will you help us?”</p><p align="justify">Credence raises his head from between his knees and looks and Seraphina from beneath messy bangs. “I-I don’t… I can’t-” he darts a quick glance back at Percival “I’m a man”</p><p align="justify">“Obviously. I don’t see what that has to do with anything” comments Seraphina before turning an inquisitive eye on Percival “Is that a no-maj thing? Men cannot marry?”</p><p align="justify">“It-it’s wrong” whispers Credence, curling back into himself with a familiar anguished expression “Two men cannot lay together, it’s a Sin. Ma says so”</p><p align="justify">“Well, that just doesn’t make sense, and it’s not like it stopped you until now.” answers Seraphina dismissively, causing Credence’s shoulders to slope down even further at the accusation. She continues in a more reassuring tone “I assure you there is nothing wrong or sinful about men being together. The only problem magic folk would have is the lack of descendants, but knowing Percival it’s not like that was on the books anyway.”</p><p align="justify">Credence shakes his head.</p><p align="justify">“Ma won’t let me.” He insists.</p><p align="justify">“She doesn’t need to know” Percival reassures him. “We can erase her memories, like we did after Tina’s intervention. She won’t ever remember you. And after, you will be able to start anew, wherever you want.”</p><p align="justify">“What about Rappaport’s Law?” blurts Tina. “Have you two given any thought on how to deal with that? Fiancée of Mr.Graves or not, Credence is still a no-maj”</p><p align="justify">“We suspect he may actually be a Squib” rebates Seraphina. “One of my assistants will be over shortly with the final testing results”</p><p align="justify">“A Squib?” asks Credence.</p><p align="justify">“Non-magical person born from magical parents. We suspect your original parents may have been wizards” explains Percival “Squibs cannot do any magic, but they are still accepted as part of the Magical Community”</p><p align="justify">“I could live in your world?” asks Credence in trepidation, a tenuous hope shining in his eyes. His gaze flicks wildly through all the wizards in the room, seeking a confirmation on which to anchor his hopes.</p><p align="justify">Percival is about to reply when there is a knock on the door. He looks at Seraphina, who nods back at him: Covington has arrived with the testing results. He waves his hand and the door opens, letting in a harried looking Covington.</p><p align="justify">“I’m so sorry about the delay, Madame President!” exclaims the man as he fully comes into the room. He is haphazardly clutching a stack of crumpled papers to his chest, his tie is halfway undone and he looks positively stressed. Percival raises his eyebrows in a silent question. Covington quickly nods at him “Director Graves. Miss Goldstein…?” He trails off at spotting Tina and Credence, staring confusedly at them.</p><p align="justify">“The results, Covington, if you please” demands Seraphina.</p><p align="justify">Covington throws one last nervous glance at Credence and Tina, and hands over his paper stack to to the President.</p><p align="justify">“We cross checked all records of wizarding children on the age gap specified by Director Graves, but were unable to find any matches”</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure?” questions Percival, standing up from his chair in front of Credence to come and look over Seraphina’s shoulder as she browses through the testing results “Did you try extending the age gap? The orphanage’s assessment of his age may not have been accurate-”</p><p align="justify">“We did that, Director” brusquely interrupts Covington, clearly miffed at having his research skills brought into question. He readjusts his glasses, before continuing “We also checked immigration records and consulted with Wilkinson Hospital on any potential illegitimate births around those dates. No results on either side. I can say with almost one hundred percent accuracy that Credence Barebone was not born from magical parents.”</p><p align="justify">Percival looks back at Credence just in time to see the brief shine of hope sputter and die in his eyes. He doesn’t cry or protest, simply hangs his head and draws further into himself, clearly too used to having his hopes crushed to be too bothered by another broken dream.</p><p align="justify">Percival just offered Credence his greatest dream, all wrapped up in a pretty bow and ready to go, only to take it all away an instant later. He feels like the world’s biggest asshole.</p><p align="justify">Tina obviously shares his opinion, if the white knuckled grip she has on her wand is any indication. Percival discreetly reaches for his own wand.</p><p align="justify">“We still ran the test on the blood samples Director Graves had provided” continues Covington, somehow oblivious to the raising tension on the room “I was a bit skeptical about getting anything out of them, since they are not as reliable with Squibs. And, of course, the samples we had were a bit dated. So, imagine my surprise when the test came back positive! I had the technician run it two more times, for safety, but there’s absolutely no doubt: full positive.”</p><p align="justify">“Meaning…?” prompts Graves.</p><p align="justify">“Meaning the boy is a wizard, of course. A no-maj born wizard, most likely. Now, I’m not sure how he wasn’t detected by MACUSA, or Ilvermorny, before but-” Covington drones on, but Percival stops listening, too shocked by the revelation to pay attention.</p><p align="justify">A wizard.</p><p align="justify">Credence Barebone, a wizard.</p><p align="justify">How could he have not noticed? After all the time spent with the boy, has he been so blinded by his own selfish desires that he failed to properly recognise any signs of magic? But then again, neither did Tina, or Ilvermorny or anyone else in MACUSA, for that matter.</p><p align="justify">He shares a baffled look with Tina, who looks as rattled by the news as he feels, before they both turn to look at Credence.</p><p align="justify">Credence who appears to not have moved a single muscle since the reveal. He is still sitting in the chair, head hung low and body curved into himself. He slowly raises his head and looks back at Percival, lips trembling with silent words that cannot seem to make it pass his throat.</p><p align="justify">Percival makes as if to take a step towards him, when Credence’s eyes roll back into his head and he awkwardly faints into the chair, long limbs sprawled gracelessly over the armrests and the floor.</p><p align="justify">Tina is the first to react, rushing to Credence side to check his pulse and lightly pat his cheek. Credence’s head lazily rolls to the side. “He’s fainted, poor thing!” she exclaims. She hovers nervously next to the chair for a moment, before she starts trying to re-arrange Credence into a more comfortable position, all the while muttering softly under her breath.</p><p align="justify">Percival snaps himself out of his shocked stupor and heads over, gently pushing Tina aside and scooping Credence up in his arms. He crosses the room in three purposeful strides and carefully deposits Credence down on the bed, arranging him so he lays flat and covering him with the blankets.</p><p align="justify">“I feel so stupid for not noticing” laments Tina, as she anxiously frets over Credence unconscious form, tucking the blankets ups to his chin “I spent weeks watching the Second Salemers, I don’t understand how I could miss something like that. A wizard!”</p><p align="justify">“I thought he was a merely a Squib” Percival reminds her. “And I dare say I spend more time with him and in certainly… closer quarters”</p><p align="justify">Tina snorts in response. “What a fine pair of Aurors we make”</p><p align="justify">“MACUSA’s finest, indeed” interrupts Seraphina from the back of the room, sarcasm dry and cutting on her voice. “Fortunately for all of us your lack of perception is greatly surpassed by the Registry and Ilvermorny’s absolute incompetence.”</p><p align="justify">“We still should have known” argues Tina “We failed Credence in the worst possible way”</p><p align="justify">“Not at all, Auror Goldstein. You saved Credence. You protected him when he accidentally manifested magic in front of his no-maj mother, and dutifully reported the fact to Director Graves”</p><p align="justify">“That’s not- It did not happen like that” protests Tina who had not only knowingly violated the Statute of Secrecy, to protect who she thought was a no-maj, but had also had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into Graves' office to confess. </p><p align="justify">“Now it is” corrects her Seraphina.”You identified the boy as a wizard and reported it to Director Graves who, upon confirmation of the boy’s magic, started introducing him to the Wizarding community and fell madly in love with him in the process”</p><p align="justify">Tina looks as if she wants to protest, but clearly thinks better of it and just silently mouths the words ‘fell madly in love’, disbelief clear on her face.</p><p align="justify">Percival would be be offended at her incredulity, if the thought of being ‘madly in love’ with anyone didn’t make him want to grind his teeth together.</p><p align="justify">“Director Graves got engaged to Mr. Barebone in secret and kept their relationship from all papers to avoid overwhelming his beloved fiancée.” continues Seraphina “He was planning to make it public once things settled down after the election, of course”</p><p align="justify">“Of course” agrees Percival, because what else is there left to do?</p><p align="justify">“It is quite unfortunate how Mr. Osmander’s hunger for power caused those scandalous photos to be taken” adds Covington, shaking his head in disbelief “Exposing poor Mr. Barebone to the scrutiny of the Wizarding community so soon after finally leaving his abusive no-maj home.”</p><p align="justify">“Tragic, indeed” responds Seraphina “Of course now that the story is public I will have no choice, as president of MACUSA, but to remove the people responsible for Mr.Barebone’s unfortunate situation from their offices. The matter would have been handled more discreetly if all had gone according to plan, but…”</p><p align="justify">“Now that the story is public, the involved parties must take responsibility” declares Covington.</p><p align="justify">“John Hopkirk, Head of Registry, to begin with. He is close to Osmander if my memory serves me well.”</p><p align="justify">“Amanda Potts, from Ilvermorny’s Admissions Department. She has held the position for decades, and although she hasn’t expressed any clear political preferences, we can all agree Willem Harrow would do a much better job.”</p><p align="justify">The exchange goes on for a while. Seraphina and Covington systematically picking each and every person potentially involved in the mess, no matter how indirectly, and analyzing the benefits that keeping them in their position or not would have on the future elections.</p><p align="justify">Percival sits himself down on the bed, next to Credence sleeping form. He knows he should at least try to contribute something to the conversation, as future Vice-President and main person responsible for the whole mess, but he is too tired to participate in Seraphina’s political ploys.</p><p align="justify">Out of the corner of his eye he can see Tina gape at Seraphina, horrified.

How long before he tires of having to spend time with him, out of the bed of a sumptuous hotel room. How long before he discovers Percival is not nearly half as charming as he pretended to be to get him in bed. How long before all his faults are laid bare and Credence realises he deserves better.</p>
