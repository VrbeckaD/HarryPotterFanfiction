    <p>Hogwarts was different this year, at least for Harry Potter and his friends.  The school had been rebuilt over the summer, and was pretty much back to normal unless you were returning to redo your seventh year.  Only twenty-seven students had chosen to return and retake their seventh year, fourteen boys and thirteen girls.  There was a mix from all four houses.  Because the dormitories had not been built to contain an eighth year class, and the board did not want to mix the ‘eighth years’ in with the regular seventh years, a new common room and dormitories were created for the eighth years. </p><p>Pains had been taken to decorate in a mix of house colors so that all the students would feel welcome.  The common room had a large fireplace dominating one wall;  another wall was filled with floor to ceiling windows.  Comfortable couches and overstuffed chairs were grouped around the spacious room, ready for the students to study or socialize.  The boys’ dorms were off a hallway to the left, and the girls off to the right. </p><p>There were five bedrooms and a shared hall bathroom in the boys’ hallway.  Harry was rooming with Blaise and Ernie.  Ron was in with Theo and Terry.  Neville had been placed in with Draco and Michael.  Seamus, Anthony and Justin were together, and Dean and Wayne were lucky enough to only have two in their room. </p><p>Harry missed rooming with his Gryffindor friends, of course, but this new arrangement was working out better than he could have hoped.  It turned out that Blaise was funny and he treated Harry just like a regular bloke.  Ernie was mostly gone from their room studying, so Harry and Blaise were left to be as ridiculous as they pleased, often accompanied by Ron.  Neville had been nervous to room with Malfoy, but he had relaxed after the first week.  Neville had reported to Harry that Malfoy was surprisingly quiet and tidy, and didn’t seem inclined to bother anyone. </p><p>Harry had seen some of these changes in Malfoy firsthand.  There was a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher this year.  Thaddeus Thropwaite had come from Ilvermorny to teach at Hogwarts.  Professor Thropwaite had decided that he would assign partners for the entire year and, of course, Harry had been paired with Malfoy.  It hadn’t been as painful as he had expected.  For one thing, Malfoy hardly ever spoke to him.  No insults, no cutting remarks, and no sarcastic songs.  When they did have to speak for class, he was polite and stayed focused on the lesson at hand.  Harry slowly started to relax around him, and was beginning to appreciate his intelligence.  It nearly rivaled Hermione’s.  But just as Harry had started to settle comfortably into the school year, weird things had started to happen that Harry could find no explanation for. </p><p>For one, there was the strange thing that happened in the library.  Harry had been returning from the stacks, his arms weighed down with a pile of books for his History of Magic assignment.  He walked over to where other students were sitting and working at tables.  He saw Malfoy sitting alone at a table, his parchments and books spread across the whole surface.  As he drew nearer, he watched Malfoy draw his wand and move the books and papers into neat stacks, leaving half of the table now clear.  Harry was so startled he halted in his tracks.  Malfoy hadn’t said anything or even looked at him, but Harry couldn’t shake the idea that he had cleared this space for him.  Harry sat in the empty chair and plopped his books down.  “Thanks,” he mumbled quietly. </p><p>At first Harry thought Malfoy would just ignore what he had said, but after a long pause he heard a whispered, “You’re welcome.”  They worked silently side by side for nearly three hours.  Harry had expected to feel jumpy and nervous, but he hadn’t.  He had felt comfortable working alongside Malfoy, and he had gotten a lot done. </p><p>After the first time, it had become a regular thing. Whenever Harry studied in the library he seemed to come across Malfoy, and Malfoy would always make room for him at his table.  Harry had even asked Malfoy the occasional question about their homework and Malfoy had been helpful and hadn’t made fun of Harry even once. </p><p>And then there was the kiss.  It had started innocently enough, a game of Truth or Dare enhanced with revealing charms that turned your hands red if you lied.  It had been the usual silly questions and dares until Michael Corner asked Blaise if he liked girls or boys. </p><p>Now, despite recent history seeming to indicate the opposite, Harry tried to be a laid back kind of guy.  You don’t bother me and I won’t bother you.  But on the question of sexuality, Harry was quite passionate.  He had been wrestling with his own sexual identity, for the last few months.  And he firmly believed no one had the right to out anyone else.  And that was what he said.  Before Blaise could utter a single syllable Harry interjected, “That’s not OK!  What kind of a question is that?  You can’t make someone out themselves, Michael!  Blaise you do not have to answer that.” </p><p>Blaise smiled warmly at Harry, “That’s okay, Harry.  Thanks for that, but I’m okay with answering the question.  I have nothing to hide.”  He flashed his most charming smile around the circle. “I like both.  The answer is, I like both.” </p><p>An uncomfortable silence descended around the circle.  Only Seamus and Dean were smiling and meeting his eyes.  Everyone else was looking everywhere else, even Malfoy and Pansy who Harry knew were Blaise’s closest friends.  All Harry’s Gryffindor tendencies rushed to the fore.  “Me too . . . er, I mean . . . uh, I like both too,” he blurted out.  All those eyes that had been looking elsewhere, now focused on Harry.  He turned red but he held his head high. </p><p>Blaise threw his arm around Harry and gave him a side hug, “That’s great Harry!  We’ll have enough for our own Quidditch team in no time at all!”  Blaise’s joke seemed to break the tension and everyone was soon laughing and smiling.  Everyone but Malfoy, who was frowning and staring at Blaise and Harry. </p><p>Harry supposed it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that Malfoy was a homophobe considering his previous prejudice against Muggles, but it made Harry unaccountably angry.  The game moved on and the spotlight was no longer on Blaise and Harry, but every time he gazed in Malfoy’s direction he found him looking right back with a frown on his face.  Harry was pulled from his speculations when he heard Malfoy’s name. </p><p> “Draco, kiss the person you’re most attracted to,” Pansy directed. </p><p> “Hey!  That’s just as bad as Michael’s question!” Harry objected. </p><p> “Okay.  Calm down Potter!” Pansy squinted round the circle.  “I’ll change it . . . Draco, just kiss Potter then.” </p><p> “What the hell?” Harry asked no one in particular. </p><p> “You know he won’t mind, Draco, he just said he likes boys too.” Pansy smirked and ignored Harry’s comment.” </p><p> “I think Dra . . . uh, Malfoy is the one who will mind, Pansy,” Harry challenged.  But even before he had finished talking, Harry could see Malfoy crawling across the circle towards him, a determined expression on his face.  Before he knew it Malfoy was in front of him, his grey eyes piercing Harry’s. </p><p>Malfoy clamped his hand on the back of Harry’s neck and dragged him close.  His lips pressed firmly to Harry’s own.  They were so warm, almost hot, and Harry had not been expecting that.  If he had thought about Malfoy’s lips at all he would have imagined them being cool, as cool as his ice grey eyes and pale moonlight hair.  But they weren’t, they were hot and they ignited Harry.  Malfoy’s mouth moved over Harry’s, his lips firm and soft, pressing and sucking – and fuck, what was happening. </p><p>Before Harry could get his brain working and respond in kind, the kiss was over and Malfoy had retreated to his side of the circle.  Malfoy flashed a smug smile in Blaise’s direction, and then the game continued.  Harry spent the remainder of the game in a daze.  He couldn’t have said what happened or even what questions he himself had answered.  That night in his bed, he replayed the kiss over and over in his head trying to figure out why it had happened and what it meant. </p><p>It was true that he thought Malfoy was a fit bloke.  “Who wouldn’t?” he thought.  Tall and slim, he had firm muscles without being bulky and pale blond hair that fell perfectly around his face each day.  And speaking of his face, his pointy nose just fit in with the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones.  His lips, those surprisingly warm lips, were the softest palest pink and were just this side of too full.  But most captivating of all were his eyes.  His blond lashes, a shade darker than his hair, framed his dark grey eyes.  Grey that reminded Harry of a stormy sea or a thunder cloud.  Not that Harry had spent much time think about Malfoy.  It was just that he was so hard to miss that naturally Harry’s gaze would be drawn to him.  That really wasn’t Harry’s fault.  And now that Malfoy had kissed him, Harry was having a hard time dislodging Malfoy’s image from his brain.  But that was totally normal, right? </p>
