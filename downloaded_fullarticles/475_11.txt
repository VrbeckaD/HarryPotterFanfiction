    <p>Harry sits down in his chemistry seat, gets his stuff out and puts his head down on the desk. It's first period on the first Monday of the year. Yeah they'd been officially back a few days already but hardly anyone ever turns up to the three first days back because there's actually no point. All they do is sit around. None for the teachers start the topics for the year. Although on the bright side their chem' teacher, Professor Howarth, was really nice and to say it was an A-Level class they did fuck all. They had been allocated their seats in the previous lesson and their seating plan this year wasn't half bad. Harry had been allocated a desk for two and he was going to share it with the new kid. Not many people change schools in the middle of their A-Level courses but needs must. Harry had heard of the new kid before he was from the side of the family that is a bit dodgy. Harry's dad and the boy's mother are cousins. Harry wasn't genetically Remus and Sirius' child like his little brother was. Harry was the child of Lilly and James. Remus and Sirius were their best friends so it was the natural choice for who was going to look after him.<br/>
"Aye up here he comes. This new kid. Damn! He's a fucking snack." Harry thinks gayly. Draco walks up to the teacher.<br/>
Prof' Howarth: Hi. You must be Draco.<br/>
Draco: I am.<br/>
Prof' Howarth: You are sat on that desk over there next to the boy with the ACDC pencil case and his head on the desk.<br/>
Draco: Okay. Thank you.<br/>
He walk over to his seat and sits down; he starts to get his stuff out. Harry lifts his head off the desk.<br/>
Harry: Hi.<br/>
Draco: *under his breath* Damn.<br/>
Harry: What was that?<br/>
Draco: Nothing. Nice to meet you. I'm Draco Malfoy.<br/>
Harry: Harry Lupin.<br/>
They shake hands.<br/>
Draco: Harry Lupin? Where have I heard that name before?<br/>
Harry: Was your mum's maiden name "Black"?<br/>
Draco: Yeah. Why?<br/>
Harry: Your mum and my godfather are cousins.<br/>
Draco: Oh yeah I remember now. I'm sorry if this sounds rude but didn't your parents die when you were one and your godfather adopted you?<br/>
Harry: Keep your flipping voice down man. I don't need the entire school to know.<br/>
Draco: Sorry.<br/>
Harry: Don't worry about it. I just don't really trust anyone around here.<br/>
Draco: *wiggling his eyebrows* What about me?<br/>
Harry: Well you're a model and the models that I have come across are bitches who get my attention then try to get me to shag them.<br/>
Draco: Do you shag them?<br/>
Harry: Nah. I don't like girls.<br/>
Draco: Same. It's awful when they get all attached because I kissed them once in for an advert.<br/>
Harry: Can't relate, sorry. Although there is a girl in sixth year...<br/>
Draco: Going for the young ones then are we?<br/>
Harry: She's a year younger than us and let me finish you twat.<br/>
Draco: Maybe. *wink*<br/>
Harry blushes.<br/>
Draco: I don't know why you're blushing. I haven't bloody done anything.<br/>
Harry: You bloody winked.<br/>
Draco: No I didn't.<br/>
Harry: Yes you did. Now. As I was saying. This girl is one of my best mate's little sister and she think I'm playing hard to get when I say I don't like girls.<br/>
Draco: What. An. Idiot.<br/>
Harry: I know.<br/>
Draco: Have you ever had a crush anyone inÂ at your school before?<br/>
Harry: Not until about ten minutes ago.<br/>
Draco: What happened ten minutes ago?<br/>
Harry face palms to; 1) display his annoyance and 2) to hide his blush.<br/>
Draco: Ooooh. *whispering in Harry's ear* Well I think that you are bloody gorgeous and I can see why all those girls want to shag you.<br/>
Harry moans in frustration. Draco smirks.<br/>
Harry: Draco you can kill a man saying things like that.<br/>
Draco rubs Harry's thigh and Harry lets out a strangled moan that he tries to cover up with a cough.<br/>
Harry: *through gritted teeth* Draco we are in class.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* So?<br/>
Harry: *whispering* If I start moaning in the middle class Miss will notice.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* I touched your leg. If I realised that you would get a raging hard on then I wouldn't have done it.<br/>
Harry: *whispering* It's not my fault that all the guys that are in this school are arse holes.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* What about your mates?<br/>
Harry: The two gay mates that I have are dating each other.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* So you're a poor virgin soul?<br/>
Harry: *sigh* Yes. *whispering* My brother has a better sex life than me.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* Isn't he in like third year?<br/>
Harry: *whispering* Yeah.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* Damn. Something is going to have to be done about that.<br/>
Harry: *whispering* You're telling me.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* I don't have any more classes until this afternoon.<br/>
Harry: *whispering* Neither do I.<br/>
Draco: *whispering* Well then. I have a plan.</p>
<p>*Time Skip*<br/>
Class has just ended and they are packing up their stuff.<br/>
Draco: Do you want to come round to mine for a study session? *wink*<br/>
Harry: Yeah.<br/>
Hermione: Hi Harry.<br/>
Harry: Hi Hermione. Did you have a good weekend?<br/>
Hermione: Yeah. You?<br/>
Harry: It was the usual. Beat Teddy at Fifa so he called me a big virgin so I called him a slut.<br/>
Hermione: Sounds like a normal Lupin weekend.<br/>
Harry: Yeah. 'Mione this is Draco.<br/>
Hermione: Hi. I'm Hermione Granger.<br/>
Draco: Hi. I'm Draco Malfoy.<br/>
Hermione: Harry are you still up for the study session at lunch?<br/>
Harry: Crap sorry I forgot. I've double booked myself.<br/>
Hermione: No don't worry. I think the second thing is more important, if I am guessing what it is right.<br/>
Draco: Thank you Hermione. Now if you'd excuse us. We must be off.<br/>
Hermione: Okay bye.<br/>
Harry: Bye</p>
