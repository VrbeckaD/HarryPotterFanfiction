    <p>sit down and let me tell you about the Marauders, Peter Pettigrew, and how the Hogwarts sorting system fails kids in the most spectacular manner possible</p><p>Hogwarts students are sorted into one of four houses at age <strong>11</strong>. Everyone acts like it’s your greatest strength that determines it, but that’s not really true, is it? When was the last time you looked at an eleven-year-old kid and thought <em>ah yes I can perfectly determine the virtue that will define this person for the rest of their life?</em>Pretty much fucking never, kids are <strong>kids</strong>. Different people have different strengths but you know what else makes a huge fucking difference? Which strengths that person is <em>encouraged to cultivate</em> during their formative years.</p><p>That’s what the house system at Hogwarts does. It puts the kids in the environment where they can <strong>grow into what they value</strong>. That’s why the all-knowing Hat takes a kid’s preferences into consideration. That’s why the know it all who’d already read all her text books ended up in Gryffindor and why the ambitious, underhanded parselmouth was allowed to say “<em>Not Slytherin</em>.”</p><p>Peter Pettigrew <strong>was a Gryffindor.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Pettigrew</strong>, age eleven, <em><strong>wanted to be brave. Wanted to be heroic. Wanted to do great things and be recognized for</strong><strong> it.</strong> </em></p><p>And he was best friends with James Potter and Sirius Black.</p><p>Now, obviously, not every Gryffindor can be the designated hero. It’s a competitive house, by nature! But Potter and Black were the golden boys of their class. They were awful and brilliant. They were bullies. They were prodigies. And they <em>liked Pettigrew</em>. </p><p>Now, in their shadow was probably the safest, most exhilarating place for pretty much anyone else in their year. You got first-row seats to all of their hijinks - even the ones most of the student body never dreamed were going on - and you’d never, ever be the target.</p><p>But here’s the thing. <em>Peter wasn’t just a spectator</em>. He was <strong>smart</strong>. He was <strong>capable</strong>. There’s only so far having brilliant friends will take you, especially when it comes to complicated, personalized spellwork, and <strong>Peter Pettigrew was an animagus at age fifteen</strong>. He was instrumental to their schemes, in a lot of ways that Lupin <em>wasn’t</em>. Lupin was the <strong>excuse</strong> for the great animagus caper, but Pettigrew was the <strong>grease in the gears</strong>. Do you think Padfoot could get anywhere near the Whomping Willow? Do you think Prongs could scout the secret passages of the school? Do you think it’s a coincidence that Wormtail’s credit on the map comes <strong>before</strong> Padfoot or Prongs? The Mauraders needed a clever, small, nimble agent to do what they did, and that agent was <strong>Peter Motherfucking Pettigrew</strong>.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Pettigrew wasn’t the <em>hero</em>. He spent every day of his school career being told that bravery and bravado and public recognition were the ideal to strive for - he was a <em>Gryiffindor</em>. And he was the tagalong. Potter and Black were the geniuses, the darlings of their classmates. Pettigrew was always clever and observant - is there any way that he <em>didn’t</em> know the Transfiguration teacher thought he “wasn’t up to their level”? Him, who could turn into a rat at will, who knew the corridors and hallways and secret passages of the school as well as any person alive and better than most.</p><p>It rankled. It had to. Gryffindors can make good sidekicks, but they make awful lackeys. They don’t like being out of the spotlight, they don’t like being looked down on. And a more bombastic Gryffindor would have been hard to live with, if put in Pettigrew’s place. Look at Harry’s classmates! When Ron feels overshadowed, he sulks, he shouts, he throws things and gives people the silent treatment, sometimes for months. When Hermione feels underappreciated, she bristles, she retreats behind her intellectual superiority, she refuses to be reasoned with. Seamus grasps at the most damaging rumor about his rival and fans the flames, Lavender and Parvati become increasingly cliquish.</p><p>Pettigrew didn’t do that. Pettigrew was a people-pleaser. Pettigrew didn’t rock the boat. Pettigrew <em>stewed</em>. </p><p>And then, after seven years of second billing, of brilliant magical and exploratory achievements that no one outside their group could ever know about, of <em>trailing after Black and Potter, </em>he enters the adult world in the midst of the war. He and his friends get drawn into the elite forces of the white hats. The stakes have skyrocketed.</p><p>Potter’s the one who draws the most accolades, of course, but that’s only to be expected. Black chases the risks, and that’s to be expected.</p><p>And then there’s the great task for Pettigrew. The most important thing he’s ever been trusted with. And it’s entrusted to him precisely <em>because no one would believe him capable of it.</em> </p><p>Peter the sidekick. <em>Peter the second-best</em>. <strong>Peter the slightly hopeless</strong>.</p><p>Exactly how much more persuasion do you think Voldemort had to offer to get him to switch sides?</p><p>So ok.</p><p>Fuck you, Pettigrew.</p><p>But fuck you, Potter. Fuck you, Black. Fuck you, every crack that Pettigrew slipped through, and fuck you, every adult and authority figure who let him slip through those cracks. And that includes you, <em>Lupin</em>, you were supposed to be a prefect and his <em>friend</em>.</p><p>But especially: fuck you, Voldemort. Let’s put the blame where blame is due - with the monster who habitually preyed on the weak, the isolated, and the overly ambitious, who pulled in a bright, insecure 21 year old, promised him <strong>respect</strong>, and stripped him of his <em>friends</em>, his <em>freedom</em>, his <em>hand</em>, and ultimately his <em>life</em>.</p>
