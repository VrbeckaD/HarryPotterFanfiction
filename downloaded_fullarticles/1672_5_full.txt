    <p>It was months after I had defeated Voldemort, and I mean months. A year, almost. Hogwarts was nearly finished getting rebuilt. </p><p>If I'm honest I'm not sure any of this was even real. It was hard to process. I didn't know how. Eight months of peace and I should've taken this time to process and relax, but I drove myself bloody mad. </p><p>Nothing felt real, every last thing spooked me and I found myself isolating and distancing myself from everyone. </p><p>Hermione and Ron have been constantly checking on me, I think they've noticed my sudden change. It felt like I hardly even had a personality before. </p><p>After Voldemort, it feels every last bit of reality and happiness I had left just got stripped away along with him. </p><p>But it was the first day back at school, I had been debating whether I wanted to go all morning. But Ron said I absolutely had to. </p><p>He reassured me it'd be an amazing day. </p><p>Harry Potter; the chosen one and the man who ridded the world of Voldemort and saved Hogwarts. </p><p>I'm even more of a legend than before. </p><p>And I didn't want the attention. </p><p>Anyway though, Ron and I met Hermione at the train and got to Hogwarts soon after all that. </p><p>The whole train ride was them talking and trying to include me, but I was quiet and hardly even there the whole train ride. Physically, I was there, but mentally I was dozing off. </p><p>I couldn't help but wonder what this year would be like, I just wanted to get by unnoticed like all my peers, but I'm Harry bloody Potter so that means heads turn everywhere I go. </p><p>You get used to it, but after I hit this weird phase of distancing myself and clamming up every time someone showed interest, I got anxiety just thinking about how bad it'd be this year. </p><p>I don't think I can handle something like that again. I felt so empty, I wouldn't want to fight it. </p><p>The three of us stopped where we were supposed to part ways with Hermione, in the middle of the crowd. </p><p>"Boys," she grinned. </p><p>"Hermione," Ron returned the grin and they smiled fondly at one another. </p><p>I pursed my lips, but forced a tiny smile and gave a nod when she turned to me. </p><p>"I better be off, I need to get settled." </p><p>"Of course, I'll talk to you later, yeah?" </p><p>The two leaned in and joined together for a sweet short kiss and she almost didn't pull away, but licked her lips with a cute smile as she turned away. </p><p>I sighed deeply, "Before you ask, I'm fine."</p><p>I could tell Ron was rushing their goodbye to ask me that. He was clearly anxious and groaned. </p><p>"You aren't! All you do is ignore me and respond with short crap, I'm tired of it!"</p><p>"I'm sorry, mate. Trust me I really am," I stared him in the eye and rested a hand on his shoulder, "not so recent events have me a little messed up, I guess. But I'm fine, I'll get over it I just need to recharge, is all."</p><p>He was short with me this time, just pursing his lips together and gesturing so I'd start walking. </p><p>Yeah, I wasn't in the mood for this conversation either, so I did start walking. We both did, in silence. </p><p>I've always been honest with Ron, but I didn't have the heart to tell him I felt empty and that I couldn't process reality. </p><p>It's so hard to explain, I don't even know what it is. But I've accepted it, nobody else wants to though. I'm the great Harry Potter, I'm not supposed to feel alone and empty. People would give everything they had to me because of everything, as a reward, and yet I just want to be alone. </p><p>I feel alone, and I want it that way at times. </p><p>Maybe pushing my only friends away is a bad idea, but it's all I could do, otherwise I'm just a burden. I hated how I felt but it is what it is. </p><p>We were traveling the long halls in silence, keeping close. That is, until we spotted a familiar someone. The whole room stopped talking to stare. </p><p>He stared back. </p><p>"Malfoy." Ron whispered. I felt my heart drop. </p><p>I didn't expect to see him return, not after the whole school witnessed him and his family on Voldemort's side. I wouldn't have the guts. </p><p>Draco swallowed hard and pushed forward and through the crowd, trying to push past Ron and I but then he realized who it was, staring at me and stopping in his tracks. </p><p>"Malfoy.." I repeated Ron's words from earlier and spoke without a second thought. Our eyes met and we stood there for a second, but he broke the contact and started pushing past everyone again. </p><p>I turned to watch him run off. </p><p>"What the hell is he doing here?" Ron stared at him as well. He hated Malfoy, he didn't see the boys struggles and pressure he was under. </p><p>Draco hid that side of him, and I paid attention. I wanted to help him, at times. But I was too late by the time I realized it. </p><p>But I didn't say a word and turned to start walking, Ron wouldn't understand. </p><p>He shouldn't be back, I'll say that. But I admire his courage. </p><p>In the end I know what happened and there isn't a thing I can do, but it doesn't mean I'll give him a harder time than he's already probably having. </p><p>I just left it alone, didn't think about that moment for weeks, until everyone was settled and I had to use the loo. </p><p>I walked down the halls and into the restroom, where a boy stood in front of the sink and stared at himself in the mirror. </p><p>He looked as if he were struggling, overthinking everything. That's what I gathered the second I saw him. </p><p>After a few seconds I knew who it was; Malfoy. </p><p>He looked at me in the mirror, and then turned to face me with swollen eyes. </p><p>"What do you want, Potter?"</p><p>"I've got to take a piss." I answered nonchalantly, walking next to the sinks where the urinals were and unzipping my pants. </p><p>There was a weird silence, but I wasn't sure what I expected to be fair. </p><p>Draco cleared his throat and straightened his back, "What, no 'why're you back' or 'you've got some nerve'?" </p><p>I did my business and then eyed him after a few seconds. </p><p>"I'm sure you get enough of that as it is, I don't think you want to hear it from the man himself."</p><p>I could sense a slight smile, but avoided eye contact once I started letting the water run over my hands. </p><p>As cocky as it was to say 'the man himself' when referring to me, we both knew how accurate my words were and I knew he knew. </p><p>Everyone knew. </p><p>So it was no surprise I acknowledged it. </p><p>It was no surprise that Draco felt almost relieved, I assumed he had gotten a lot of shit since he got back, because if he hadn't he would've returned to giving me shit, and he hasn't. He got a taste of his own medicine, I bet, and started being considerate. </p><p>"You're the first person to actually say something like that, believe it or not." He turned to face me but I grabbed the towels to dry my hands and forced a smile. "Doesn't mean you're any less of a self-centered arse."</p><p>"I figured. Still," it was nice to have a quiet conversation, without wands or arguing, as in I didn't argue with him. He had no reason to be soft. I've never had a decent conversation with him, a normal one. "It'll cool down eventually."</p><p>Draco didn't respond, he just turned back around and watched himself in the mirror. </p><p>That was that, I didn't want to push anything and anger him, so I nodded, clicking my tongue and left. </p><p>I went back to my class and sat next to Ron with a small smile. He stared, a little confused. I had been all nonchalant and distant and suddenly a trip to the bathroom I'm all flustered? Yeah I get where he's coming from. </p><p>But it's not that I was flattered or anything, I just was happy to have that conversation. We both needed it, him more so than I. But I'm hoping it cleared things, he might not hate me as much for being considerate about his situation. </p><p>Hey, all I could think about is how bad it must be for him back here. This whole school is terrified of Voldemort, Draco looked him in the eyes and had to follow his fathers footsteps, the school witnessed that. I witnessed it.</p><p>Can you blame me for being considerate? For thinking about it constantly?</p><p>Everyone assumes I should hate the guy, he tormented me through every school year and then sided with Voldemort, but unwillingly. That's the part everyone leaves out, he didn't have a choice, I saw it in his eyes. There was hesitation, and slight resistance. I know what I saw. </p><p>Doesn't change the fact that in no way I'd even consider being his friend, but doesn't mean I shouldn't consider all sides to the story. </p><p>Soon the day was over, Ron and I were gonna go visit Hagrid, we were on our way at least. </p><p>He kept pushing and asking why I was all smiley, because I hadn't been for awhile. All summer I ignored them anyways, so it's only understandable that he'd question me I suppose. </p><p>"Look, Ronald! I've just processed things. Draco..is getting a taste of his own medicine, I think for the first year he won't be in the picture. Voldemort is gone, the school is stable again, things are good. We finally get some peace." I don't know why I lied, that wasn't true. I hadn't processed that. It's a glass half empty or full situation, and it was not half full to me at all. Half empty, because that's all I felt; empty. </p><p>I knew what mindset I had to have, I was above major struggling. But I let it get to me for once, just to cope. I never got to cope with my emotions, I found distractions. Voldemort was my distraction. </p><p>Heck, that was my coping method. Distractions. It wasn't very healthy. </p><p>Now that I have time to manage it, I've been trying. </p><p>It's harder than I thought but not terrible, not something I can't handle. </p><p>Only thing is it's hurting my friends slightly, and I realize that. </p><p>"Yeah," Ron didn't question me further, accepted the answer despite his suspicion, "Draco had it coming, I suppose. Karma's a bitch, huh?"</p><p>I kept walking, but frowned, "Yeah, but it's for the wrong reasons. Do you honestly believe he'd side with you-know-who, Ron? He never had the guts. After everything I think he was on our side."</p><p>"No, he wasn't." He scoffed and stopped walking just to face me. I turned as well, because I knew I'd have to defend my opinion. It's not a common thing, most people despise Draco for having the audacity to return to Hogwarts. But think of it this way, if he truly didn't belong here, do you really think the ministry would allow him to return? Absolutely bloody not, they'd deny his attempt at reenrolling. </p><p>Ron sighed deeply, lowering his voice because he noticed my angered expression. "Harry..Malfoy was not on our side. You're too kind, sometimes that kindness blinds you. He deserves the shit he's getting, don't try denying that."</p><p>"Look, all things considered, trust me. But I know what happened, Draco had every last opportunity to betray us, to expose me and hand me over to Voldemort, but the fact that he didn't counts for something. He's just at a low, Ron. And it's because of my kindness that I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, it's all about perspective, and I personally think mine, it's looking at all sides. Not just the assumption you're all making." My voice was steady and stern, I wasn't gonna get all dramatic over it. I didn't want to. </p><p>Ron could tell I wasn't worth arguing with, he simply frowned. But just because he could tell didn't mean he didn't want to. </p><p>I've always had a weird opinion on Draco. The reasonable emotion to feel is hatred, considering what he's put me through and who he was involved with. Especially hatred from me, but I don't. I feel nothing towards him. If I have to name an emotion, why not call it sympathy? Maybe I'm a fool but Draco probably would disagree if I expressed my opinion. </p><p>"He didn't want blood on his hands. It's not about whether he did it for you or because he was on our side. It's about him." He gritted his teeth, "You're flattering yourself, Harry. He was looking out for himself, not you."</p><p>I didn't agree. As much as I'd like to, I didn't. I grabbed my friends wrist and stared harshly before speaking, "We both know that isn't true."</p><p>The red headed boy was preparing his next argument, but something fire like came flying in our direction. </p><p>Luckily I noticed it enough quickly, yelling 'duck' and pushing Ron down as it passed and hit the brick wall behind us. </p><p>I saw the creature who threw it at us, standing far back and running closer. I quickly pulled my wand out, my mind racing with what spell I could use. I can't kill whatever or whoever this is, it's on school grounds. </p><p>So, I aimed it at the man and hesitated slightly. My breathing was heavy, it was defense, if he did die I'm sure I'd get by with a detention of some sort, right? Maybe. I don't know. </p><p>My name counts for something, usually there isn't harsh punishment. </p><p>And that's because my name, it's because I'm targeted by a lot of people. </p><p>Just like now, I'm the target. Not Ron. If it were Ron he'd be dead, but it's me the fire was aimed for. Ron happened to be closer because I held his wrist. </p><p>"Expelliarmus!" </p><p>His wand came flying my direction and Ron grabbed it when it hit the ground, standing as well. He didn't have his wand currently, but I was paranoid, so I carried mine everywhere. And it's bloody good that I do otherwise we'd die. </p><p>He pointed the wand at the guy as well but I reacted all too quickly. Don't give time by questioning their motive, because you give them time to debate their next move and give them a chance to distract. I've learned the hard way in the past. </p><p>"Crucio!" I yelled, angrily I might add. </p><p>He fell to the ground, groaning in excruciating pain. I took this moment and breathed, dropping my arm and watching him struggle to stand back up. </p><p>"Alert Hagrid, please." I watched Ron run down to his house and sat on the ground, the man yelling still. </p><p>That was the first attack since I've got back. I didn't expect there to be more attacks. I thought it was over, but I suppose it's never over. </p><p>I felt so mentally exhausted, just thinking of how many more there'll probably be. I hated this guy already, for just reminding me peace hardly exists when you're me. </p><p>I sat next to him but at a slight distance, holding my wand out and whispering, "Incendio."</p><p>His arm caught fire, and he panicked even more. </p><p>Hagrid and Ron came rushing back up, seeing the mess I created. I found it amusing, because I was upset the man reminded me that I'm never safe. </p><p>For awhile my mindset has been healthy, kind of. I was managing and then this ugly twit decides to ruin that. Of course. </p><p>"He tried to kill me." I said before Hagrid could comment. </p><p>He saw the emotion–that hardly was visible–in my eyes and nodded, "Right then."</p><p>"Why do ya think he was targeting 'arry?" My friends accent was thick, I don't know why but whenever he failed to pronounce my name with 'h' I just smiled. This time I didn't, I was upset this man tried attacking me. </p><p>"You-know-who's followers, I guarantee 'yer. They think good ol' Voldemort is living inside Harry. His soul latching onto the nearest living thing. 'Our lord will rise again' n' all that." Hagrid had mumbled something under his breath and the man stopped groaning and the fire disappeared. </p><p>He grabbed the man and turned back to me, "We'll talk later, boys."</p><p>The two of us watched Hagrid walk up the hill. We were both upset to hear that now. Maybe Ron more so than me, I figured that moments ago. </p><p>It's similar to what Dumbledore had said, me being a horcrux before I died. It reminded me of that. </p><p>If he were living inside me, you'd think I'd be driving myself mad. But I'm fine, I feel empty but it's only because I'm letting myself to cope. It has nothing to do with him. </p><p>It's no bloody surprise that his followers are gonna be attacking now though. </p><p>"There's never any time to relax, is there?" I sighed quietly as Ron rested a hand on my shoulder. </p><p>"Not as long as you're you."</p><p>"Yeah," I watched Hagrid disappear behind the wall and finally turned to Ron, "you're right, sadly."</p><p>~</p><p>Hermione laid on the couch with Ron at the other end, her feet on his lap. I stayed in the chair across from it with my legs curled. </p><p>We were trying to figure out a plan for these threats. </p><p>And really, that conversation went about like this. </p><p>"Absolutely not, I'm not putting you in danger!" I raised my voice slightly, only because I said it four times already. "Last time I had help-" </p><p>I didn't dare finish, Ron hated when I blamed myself for his brothers death. I kept quiet when he narrowed his eyes. </p><p>Neither said anything about my half-finished sentence. </p><p>"We do it together." Hermione interrupted the silence that was trying to settle. </p><p>I felt terrible about his brother, his family had been heartbroken, Ron didn't talk to me for months, I didn't talk to him either. </p><p>Not only did it feel terrible, it was. I feel selfish, in a way. People should not get to risk their lives for me. Especially the only people I dare care about. </p><p>"Point is.." this time I lowered my voice, easy and calm, "everyone who helps..ends up hurt or even dead. After last time..I can't do it again. I can't lose you guys, I can't lose more family."</p><p>They smiled slightly at each other and stayed silent. I never refer to them as family anymore, because the second I do it means if they die it'll hurt more than it has to, because I've accepted our deep connections. </p><p>Neither saw it that way, but I did, sadly. </p><p>I couldn't possibly risk their lives. If it's just Voldemort's followers, I'll be fine. They're not that intelligent. </p><p>"You doing alright, Harry?" A voice spoke from the doorway. He had his belongings, meaning he was coming back to the room. It was Neville. Also meaning, our conversation was over. </p><p>He walked closer and set his books down, "I heard about the attack, the whole school has."</p><p>I forced a smile, "I'm alright, Neville, thank you."</p><p>Neville coughed, "It got me thinking, what if you-know-who will return, like he isn't dead? What if he uses the resurrection stone? Or returns in a different body. Isn't it possible?"</p><p>My friends stared at Neville for daring to speak what everyone was thinking. It's not like the possibility didn't cross our minds, we're all paranoid, some more than others. </p><p>I've been left alone with my thoughts, that one is a reoccurring thought I have often. </p><p>"Err, Yeah- I mean it's possible, and we'd be a fool to avoid entertaining the possibility, but let's not stress it? There's no telling. I wouldn't worry." I say, a hypocrite. Because all I do is worry! </p><p>"No telling?" Neville almost laughed, "Draco would tell. He might know something. Is it just a coincidence that he's returned? He wouldn't even begin to think about it..unless the dark lord himself has him keeping an eye on Harry. Because he wants to have the element of surprise and he can only do that with someone on the inside, in case we know he's planning on having the element of surprise."</p><p>It was a good theory, but I couldn't help but take the possibility into consideration. Like I said, we have to entertain it all. There's no telling, and I highly doubt Malfoy would tell me a thing. </p><p>If my perspective is the most accurate, then he's probably insecure about it. I wouldn't even think about pushing. But what Neville said had me thinking. What if he was right? </p><p>"Neville!" Hermione threw a pillow at him, "You and your bloody theories! Leave it be. Voldemort is dead, that's why Malfoy is back. To get his life back together."</p><p>I smiled slightly, at least someone agreed with me. All I've heard is how foolish and blind I am. </p><p>Ron rolled his eyes but kept quiet. </p><p>"What??" Neville chuckled, "Was it harsh? Or unrealistic?"</p><p>"Both!"</p><p>The whole night I tossed and turned, thinking hard about what I should do. Neville had a point, even if it wasn't fully..realistic. But Malfoy could still be a follower, a death eater. And Voldemort couldn't have used the stone, but who knows. Entertain the possibility, remember? So you're always prepared, or so I am, I guess. </p><p>Finally, I just sat up, staring into the slight darkness. The moon shined through the windows and I sighed, deciding I would just take a walk. </p><p>Of course I wasn't allowed, so I grabbed the Marauder's map and my wand, wandering down the halls. </p><p>I didn't care that it was late, I was exhausted and couldn't sleep. </p><p>Sometimes I'd just hide out in the library. It was always so calming, the smell of books, the dim lights added a whole aesthetic I really liked. Something about the room calmed me, and so I go there if I can. </p><p>But when I reached the door, I heard sniffling. The lights were on, which was unusual. Meaning someone was in here. </p><p>The person sniffles again, and I fold the map back up and shove it into my pocket along with my wand. </p><p>I walked closer when I heard a sob, peeking through the cracks of the bookshelf. I spotted a familiar bright blonde headed boy and frowned deeply. </p><p>Again? He was crying again? </p><p>He must've sensed he was being watched, because he stopped immediately and held his breath. </p><p>That's when I went around the bookshelf and peered down the long row, giving a sad small smile at Malfoy. </p><p>"What the bloody hell, Potter?" Draco was quick to wipe the tears and rub his eyes until they were raw. "Don't you ever knock?"</p><p>"I couldn't sleep. And there isn't exactly a door I can knock on." I say sternly. His arm with the dark mark was showing, only for a few seconds. It looked bruised and swollen, as if something had happened. But he covered it up the second he noticed my stare. "What happened?" I tried, only to receive a glare from him. </p><p>"The day I turn to you for support is the day I've lost it." Malfoy looked away from me when I took a few steps closer and slid my back down the other wall. "Get lost, okay? I'm not-"</p><p>"Your arm." I said, "It's bruised, swollen I think. What happened?"</p><p>Draco didn't answer and just stared up with the sad look in his eyes I saw the first day of school. I need to stop catching him in these states, I feel sympathy when all people ever say is I shouldn't, not for him. </p><p>"You know," it was worth a shot, right? The classic connection talk. If it didn't work I'd piss off, but I think he needs it more than I do right now. I cracked a small smile and watched his eyes carefully, "they think you willingly went with Voldemort. And that you didn't come back willingly."</p><p>His head shot up and he stared, "Do you believe that?"</p><p>"No," my eyes fell to the floor, "I know what I saw. I know you know what I saw. Let people react how they want-"</p><p>"The whole school's turned on me, it's not like I have a say in any of this." </p><p>I just smiled, "We never have a say in what goes on. Control is key to everyone, once you accept you aren't in control it's easy. That's why everyone's so harsh with you being back, they want control of this." </p><p>Draco was hesitant, awkward even. I could tell he didn't want to really talk, but it didn't look like he wanted to be alone. </p><p>"The ministry decided to let me back."</p><p>"I figured."</p><p>It got silent, because the small talk was over. I wanted to know what happened to his wrist, but I didn't want to push. It's a weird situation. </p><p>"I appreciate your attempt at small talk, trust me, but you should leave." He sent me a cold stare but I didn't crack. </p><p>I could tell he didn't want to be alone. His eyes lit up when he saw me sit down. I know it. </p><p>"Show me your arm and I'll go." </p><p>His hesitation said a lot, but I could tell he'd give in eventually. Draco pulled up his sleeve and showed me the mark. It was bruised, and it looked as if there were a bunch of mosquito bites aching to be itched. His skin looked extremely raw, my heart left my body when I saw it. </p><p>"Is it- because he's dead?" I couldn't help but assume that it was my fault, that's where my mind first went. Can you blame me?</p><p>Malfoy kept avoiding eye contact and rested his hand on his knees that curled into his chest, "No, these arseholes did some spell."</p><p>I didn't say a word. I processed instead. </p><p>After all those years of torment, even Malfoy never hit that level of low. To cast some spell or curse that nobody could possibly figure out without a ton of research? It must be eating alive at him, possibly quite literally. I didn't recognize it, nothing seemed familiar about the symptoms, but I still felt like I should try anything I've picked up over the years. </p><p>"Don't say anything, I know the irony." He faked a snort and smiled through the pain. It hurt to see him like that, despite our past. </p><p>I sat forward and onto my knee's holding my hand out, "Can I.."</p><p>When I reached for his hand he pulled back and stared in confusion. I watched his eyes softly though, hoping the eye contact would be reassuring enough so I didn't have to use words. Words make it awkward. </p><p>"No you twit, don't-"</p><p>"Malfoy." I sat back. "I think I can help. You're probably not getting a lot of that so let me."</p><p>He looked hurt, but I think accepted my response because he had been harsh for so long, me being harsh just once was probably enough for him to give in. </p><p>He reached his arm forward and let me see closely, just watching. </p><p>I pulled my wand out and mentally went over a list. I chose the safest I could use. </p><p>"Finite incantatem.." I spoke quietly. </p><p>The bumps blurred into nonexistence and the bruises faded slowly, leaving the serpent. I didn't comment on it, I figured he wouldn't want me to. </p><p>Carefully, I sat back and against the wall, sighing relief when he didn't get angered I knew what to do. He's always got angry when I did something right. I don't know why. </p><p>"This doesn't make things cool between us, by the way." He spat, but calmly. </p><p>"I didn't expect it to anyways." </p><p>He eyed me, "I never thanked you for saving my life, that day. I..well- it meant- I appreciated it. Thank you." </p><p>Surprised, I cocked an eyebrow and smiled, "Must've been hard for you."</p><p>"Alright," Draco stood, "we're done here. Quit walking in on me, Potter. I'll make you regret it."</p><p>"Empty threats, Malfoy, empty threats." I answered just loud enough for him to hear as he walked out the doors. </p><p>I simply sighed. </p><p>Now for books, the real reason I came here.</p><p>~</p><p>The next few days were quiet. Occasionally I'd catch people messing with Malfoy, and here and there would mind my business but sometimes I'd set their shoelaces on fire to scare them. </p><p>It didn't mean anything to Draco that I helped, in fact I don't even think he knew it was me. But I've been in his shoes, nobody helps except my friends. </p><p>Not that we're friends, I just figured he could use the slight anonymous help. </p><p>Ron and I were in our room studying for some potions test, Hermione was late but she had to sneak around, we're at the age where teachers get suspicious of girls being in our room, even if there are a bunch of other guys and they know we've been friends with Hermione since the start. </p><p>But anyways, we were studying and getting frustrated when Hagrid popped his head in. </p><p>"Harry, I need to talk to 'yer." </p><p>I hesitantly set my books down at Ron's feet and walked over, where Hagrid practically dragged me into the hall. </p><p>"You used forbidden magic when the death eater attacked you."</p><p>I blinked, not saying anything. Okay? I panicked! Give me a break. I've been through absolute hell recently, and it slipped. </p><p>"There's a reason it's banned, if the ministry finds out–and its likely they will–you'll get expelled." He added, a strict voice. </p><p>He's usually never strict, so I stared at my feet. The ministry would fire him if they found out he kept this from them. </p><p>"I killed Voldemort, my heads been all over the place, Hagrid I swear it was on accident it just slipped and-" </p><p>"Relax, I have a job for you and the ministry doesn't have to find out."</p><p>"Really sir, what is it?!" I exclaimed excitedly, because it was good to have an offer like this. Most teachers don't think twice. </p><p>"A detention, of some sort. I'm going away, for a bit, the ministry suspects I'm hiding mystical banned creatures in my home. I need 'yer to-"</p><p>"You aren't, are you sir?"</p><p>Hagrid coughed and looked away and checked behind him, "Do you still have that cloak, 'arry?"</p><p>I nodded. </p><p>~</p><p>"This is not what I had in mind when you said detention of sorts." </p><p>I stared at the..half cricket half bat half cat? I don't know what it was but I stared. </p><p>"That's what the last one said. I need you to hide it if the ministry sends someone, it doesn't make noise, if you feed it. It's a-"</p><p>"No offense sir, but I'd really rather not know what it is. I'll do it." </p><p>Hagrid pat my back, "Thanks lad."</p><p>And as it turns out, I never figured out what it was called and I'm glad. Every chance I had free time, I went down to Hagrid's and watched the cross..creature. I was gonna say breed but it's not even the same species. </p><p>I even skipped some classes for it, claiming I was 'sick'. I wasn't. I don't usually get sick but for Hagrid I do I guess. </p><p>I was studying in his house, while multitasking in a way and feeding the weird thing as well just so it didn't start screaming at me. It was loud when it was upset. </p><p>While I sat, I could hear footsteps. I had threw the cloak over the creature and quickly stood in a panic, peeking through the window. </p><p>It was a bright blonde boy, no teacher. I realized it was Malfoy and rolled my eyes, I didn't think I'd have to see him again. </p><p>Aside from helping him when someone messes with him, I really couldn't care less about him and I feel Hagrid set this up. He knew I was helping Malfoy, he's been keeping an eye on me. I've caught him watching before. </p><p>Since I used the banned magic he's been watching, at least until now. </p><p>I went to go open the door but he pulled his wand out and unlocked it himself, opening the door without a single sign of struggle. </p><p>"Potter??" He groaned, "Just what I needed, you sitting around and trying to make small talk."</p><p>"What're you doing, Malfoy?" I watched as he shut the door and plopped down in the nearest seat, fumbling with his wand. </p><p>He scoffed, "Same as you, genius. 'Detention' as he called it. Where's the ugly mug?" </p><p>Once I processed what was going on, I kneeled down and pulled back the cloak for him to see, "Hagrid asked I brought my cloak."</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes but stood quickly after and started rummaging through Hagrid's belongings. I didn't want to comment, but nothing about what he was doing felt necessary. </p><p>"What're you doing?" I asked again, this time with a blank expression. </p><p>He simply sighed, "Hagrid supposedly took something that belonged to my dad, the night of the battle with Voldemort and Hogwarts. It was a potion, it was rare. And dangerous. One of a kind. My dad asked me to fetch it, so I punched this kid in the nose after his shoelaces caught on fire, got myself detention."</p><p>I nodded and didn't question him further, until I realized he mentioned his dad. Then I turned, "I- Wait I thought-" I ignored his harsh stare when he stopped picking up the scattered objects and throwing them to the side. "Your dad and Voldemort were like- I mean you know I don't believe that you had a choice in all this but it's awfully suspicious-"</p><p>Draco didn't like my rambling. If I was gonna confront him I should've said what was on my mind. </p><p>So, he grabbed my shirt and twisted it, pulling me close so we were inches apart, "Don't accuse me of such, Potter." He spat. "I'm getting it for my dad because the last guy who took a small sip of it died immediately, I'm protecting Hagrid. Don't you ever accuse me of working with Voldemort, willingly."</p><p>When everyone else did, he let them. When I did, he didn't. He was more comfortable with me, which is saying a lot because we hate each other, but me saying that might've hurt. </p><p>My mind is open, I see through a lot and usually there isn't confusion anymore, but gosh this confused me. </p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>Malfoy let the words linger, and the tension thicken before he dropped me and went back to searching the house. </p><p>I watched for a few more seconds, and then finally just sat down and frowned at the weird creature, he stared back at me like a lost puppy. </p><p>It had the wings and face of a bat and a body and tail of a cat and then legs of a cricket, but somehow the face was growing on me. It was kind of cute, once it calmed down after about an hour of yelling at me for not feeding it enough treats. </p><p>"Does it kill everyone instantly?" I asked, a little quieter and softer tone than I intended but I didn't want him getting upset and doing that again. </p><p>Draco stopped and turned his head slightly, but not enough to face me, just the side, "It has a different effect for everyone, but instant death is the most common."</p><p>"Was it your dads? Or does he just want it."</p><p>"Both, But he made it for Voldemort, not to use on, but he's dead now so, yeah. It was actually gonna be used on-" he stopped and tensed, but softly turned and his eyes met with my own, "You, it was gonna be used on you. That was my purpose. That's the part I played in all this. I never went through with it though."</p><p>I nodded slowly. What, was I supposed to thank him for admitting he didn't kill me even when that was his whole purpose? No, I prefer the silence. </p><p>Draco forced a laugh, but it could've fooled anyone, but I know the difference between fake and real. He cocked an eyebrow, "I'm not back here to use it on you because I failed the first time, Potter. You idiot. Everything I've said is true. I'm back because I want to be. Voldemort is dead. Your only issue is death eaters."</p><p>"And I'm just supposed to kill them all, then?" My sarcasm was quite clear but Malfoy ignored me to keep looking. </p><p>He didn't want to comment, he used to be a death eater so it's like, killing his associates. I don't want to use the word family, that would offend him. Even if it's mentally.</p><p>A silence settled, Malfoy took advantage of it and kept looking. </p><p>I watched closely, only because if it is everything he says it is, then I want to see it close up. It should get destroyed, not delivered to his dad. But whatever, it's his dad after all. I trust he won't give it to someone who will use it. Hopefully. </p><p>Finally, he picked up some small bottle with blue liquid inside it, smiling to himself. </p><p>But I tensed and pointed my wand, "Accio bottle!"</p><p>Draco gasped when the bottle went flying at me after I caught it. He stared as I examined it. </p><p>"Give it back Potter." The boy demanded with a strict tone, but I sat back and continued studying its features. </p><p>"This tiny liquid was supposed to kill me instantly?" </p><p>He rolled his eyes, "If you don't believe me be my guest, bet it still works."</p><p>Startled from his response, I handed it back and he snatched it harshly, turning his back and ignoring any attempt I'd make at another conversation. </p><p>However, I tried anyway. </p><p>"The death eaters, suspecting Voldemort being alive, is that true?"</p><p>Asking seemed to cross a line, judging by Draco's dumbfounded expression, but there's no going back now so I just awaited a response. </p><p>"He's dead, quit it with your questions. I already said he was dead."</p><p>I gave a sheepish smile, "Sorry. I just figured you'd have some answers."</p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes again, I swear he does that so much. "No, Potter, Voldemort is not alive. He is not living inside your body. Yes this potion instantly kills, or occasionally curses someone for a lifetime and has no loophole. My dad is still a death eater, and I no longer speak with him now that I'm seventeen, and no, I do not want to be your friend." His tone was harsh. "Don't think I don't see you helping when people mess with me. It's karma, and I can handle myself. The kind gestures imply care and trust me you should not care, so quit it. I can hold my own."</p><p>"From day one I said we aren't bloody friends!" I raised my voice but smiled slightly, "Malfoy I'm not trying to be your friend. You don't have anybody right now, doesn't it feel good to know someone's on your side?"</p><p>He avoided my eyes, staring at the cracks in the floor and possibly memorizing them to avoid answering. Eventually time caught up and he forced a smile to hide his frown, "If it's you who's on my side, no it doesn't feel good. You're just this delusional kid who is known as 'the boy who lived'."</p><p>"Wrong, But I accept the answer." I murmured and spread my legs, staring, "Just know, the offer is there. If you need someone-"</p><p>"If you don't stop it with that rubbish I'm going to punch your face in."</p><p>"-if you need someone, I exist. You know you put me through a ton of shit if I haven't been through what I have I wouldn't have the guts to talk to you. So when I say-"</p><p>I should've listened because seconds later he grabbed my shirt again and straddled me, punching my jaw repeatedly. </p><p>"I-" He gritted his teeth and watched as my face slowly swelled, "told..you..to..stop."</p><p>When he finally stopped, a slight smile grew on my face when I elbowed his gut and pushed him on the floor, deciding against kicking him in the face like that one time he did to me. I was snooping, it's understandable. </p><p>My eye hurt, but I nodded to myself when he looked at me after a short groan, "Despite that, the offer still stands. Doesn't have to be as friends."</p><p>"I'm not hiding behind Harry bloody Potter. I don't need you to defend me." </p><p>"That's not what I mean. All I'm saying is you don't have to be alone. It must be a new low, for you, right? Figured you could use someone right now."</p><p>Draco didn't answer and just narrowed his eyes to the floor, fumbling with his fingers. He must've felt as if I were insulting him by offering a hand, I felt bad immediately after. </p><p>I wiped the blood off my face from the cut he gave me and rubbed my left under eye, it was definitely gonna bruise. Ugh. I should've went for his face for payback. </p><p>Before it could even get silent, we heard footsteps from outside and muffled voices. </p><p>In a panic, Malfoy and I made eye contact and then scurried onto our feet and threw the cloak onto the creature. </p><p>We'd get in trouble for being in here, but they'd question us if we were in here for no reason. </p><p>"There's no where to hide- this oaf needs to clean its horrid in here-" Draco yelped when I grabbed his wrist and shoved him onto Hagrid's couch. </p><p>I made sure to grab a tissue as quick as I could and handed it to him carefully, whispering, "Here."</p><p>He was confused but when I sat down next to him he got the idea, bringing his hands up to my face. One to hold my cheek, the other to get the blood off with the tissue. </p><p>Our eyes met nervously as the door clicked open and a few people–probably from the ministry–waltzed in. </p><p>"Potter? Malfoy? What is this?" The woman asked, a hard stare. </p><p>We turned to her quickly and hesitated, but I spoke up quicker than Draco could. </p><p>"We got in a fight- like with these other kids and this was the nearest place. I-"</p><p>"Get back to school grounds, now." Another said, one I didn't recognize, "I don't want to hear excuses. Someone will come by to discuss your two's punishment. Breaking and entering."</p><p>Did the fight excuse not even matter to her?</p><p>Malfoy and I shared a look before slowly pulling away and walking past them and up the hill. </p><p>Once we were far enough, we sighed relief.</p><p>Nothing else was said, the eye contact was too much and even I knew that, we both reached our socializing limit I suppose and went back to our rooms. </p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>~</p>
