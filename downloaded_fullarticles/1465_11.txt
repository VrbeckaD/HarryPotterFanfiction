<p><b></b><b></b>Whispers echoed throughout the halls of Hogwarts as the History of Magic professor, Rowan Khanna and the Potions professor, Penny Haywood raced through the halls getting stares from every student that they went by. </p>
<p>“Did you hear the rumors? Supposedly those Cursed Vaults from over 20 years ago are “working” again.” </p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you two get to class rather than gossip?” the bespectacled professor said surprising the student and their friend causing them to apologize and rush to class. Rowan than widened her eyes in shock and quickly ran to catch up to Penny. The moment the tall teacher caught up with the blonde she was asked a question, “Hey Rowan, I have a question? How long do you think we can hide this? Students are suspicious and are talking about the vaults.”</p>
<p>In response she closed her eyes, sighed and said,  “I don’t think we can do this for much longer we’ve really met our limit at the moment and if we keep hiding what’s going on and acting as suspicious as we are we’re just going to be questioned even more and when the students find out what’s going on this is going to cause more problems for not onlly us, but also Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic, and all of the other professors.”  </p>
<p>Penny stopped walking and looked down in frustration, questioning her quality on a teacher as she thought “What type of teacher am I if I can even help my students?”. She continued with her thoughts until she felt a comforting hand on her shoulder, she looked up and saw Rowan flashing a soft smile at her. “Don’t worry Penny we’ll figure this out, we always do.” </p>
<p>She then straightened up nodded in response before following Rowan to the headmaster’s office. </p>
<p>The two professors reached the headmaster’s office and said the password “Tabby Cat” in unison, the two entered the office but not before looking at each other and taking a deep breath. </p>
<p>“There you two are, it took you long enough.” </p>
<p>In the middle of the room there stood a tall woman with black hair with silver streaks in a tight and a stern expression on her face, Minerva McGonagall the headmistress of Hogwarts. The two women stood up straight and apologized, “We apologize profess- headmistress McGonagall we just got distracted by something.” </p>
<p>The headmistress closed her eyes and sighed in exhaustion, “It is alright just please don’t get distracted on your way here next time.”</p>
<p>The two professors looked at each other in shock at her comment but agreed to not get distracted. With a worried look on her face the potions professor spoke up and questioned the headmistress. “Professor McGonagall I don’t mean to come off as rude but I’m just curious as to why you asked for the two of us to meet with you.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious as well professor, if by any chance does this has anything to do with the Cursed Vaults and the problems that have been happening again?”</p>
<p>The headmistresses emerald green robes slightly fluttered as she turned and began to slowly walk to her desk, the moment she reached her desk she picked up a stack of papers before turning to face the two former students. </p>
<p>“These are reports by numerous professors and students about incidents that are occurring that are remarkably similar to the incidents that occurred during your time at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Rowan’s eyes widened and had a look of shock and surprise on her face, “W-what are you serious? The vaults are “working again”? I thought the curses on the vaults “broke” years ago”</p>
<p>McGonagall turned away and looked at the reports once again and said “I thought the vaults were done for good as well but it seems as if I was mistaken. From all that I’ve seen and learned about the incidents it seems as if the core of these incidents and vaults working again are the group that caused most of the trouble that you faced during your time at Hogwarts, the organization known as R.” </p>
<p>The two professors eyes widened and they looked at each other in shock, they opened their mouths but nothing came out. Their responses caused McGonagall to confess to them about what has truly been happening around the school and why she called them in. </p>
<p>“The vaults began to start back up the end of the last year after the incident with Mr. Potter and Malfoy but I didn’t inform anyone as I thought I could have handled it, but it seems that I was sorely mistaken as nothing I have done has helped in the slightest, in fact if I’m being all honest my actions might have worsened things.” </p>
<p>Rowan and Penny’s shoulder relax as they see Professor McGonagall’s shoulders slump slightly. </p>
<p>McGonagall then takes a deep breath, straightens up and turns to the two with her trademark stern look.</p>
<p>“That is why I asked to meet with the two of you, you two helped with the Vaults over 20 years ago so I thought you two would not only help with the vaults but also help me come in contact with Hana Kim.” </p>
<p>Penny’s worried face soon became a face of determination, “We promise to not only help with the vaults but also get Hana to help with the vaults.” she declared as Rowan nodded her head in agreement. </p>
<p>The group began to speak about their plans until the sun went down when the History of Magic and Potions professors decided to go back to their rooms.</p>
<p>The moment Rowan got to her room she decided to write a letter to her Hana about the cursed vaults starting up again. She finished the letter just as soon as she started the letter ending it with “Sincerely, Rowan(also please write me back instead of just popping up out of nowhere like you usually do)”.</p>
<p>The silence that filled the room was broken by a soft yawn as the History of Magic professor stretched her arms, she then took her glasses off and rubbed her eyes as she relaxed in her chair. </p>
<p>A clang echoed throughout her room and she turned to the source of the sound and saw her pet owl Avi excitedly flapping her wings, she smiled and walked over to her with the letter in her hand and opened the cage and gave her the letter and told her to deliver the letter to Hana Kim in Cheshire, England. </p>
<p>Avi quickly flew away as Rowan watched her owl fly away with her letter hoping that it would reach Hana and get her to come to Hogwarts and help.</p>
