    <p>Dear Lily,<br/>I know that you hate me. I’m sorry, and I never meant for it to happen that way. I just thought you were pretty, and I did the idiotic thing that most teenage boys do: I flirted by annoying you. And for that, I’m sorry. I’m also sorry I bullied you, Snape, and other people that annoyed me, just because I could. I’m done with that now, and I’m sorry I ever did it. I have done too many things to apologise for. Too many things that I’ve done, and then regretted, but never said sorry for. And I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for everything. Everything I’ve done, and everything I didn’t do, and everything I let happen. And I’m so sorry. I’m going to change, I promise.<br/>Sincerely Yours,<br/>James Potter<br/>P.S. I understand if you don’t want to respond to this letter.</p>
