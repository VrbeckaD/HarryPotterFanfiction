    <p>Malfoy was up to something.</p><p><br/> It was probably around midnight and Harry couldn’t shake off the thought. It’d already been a month since eighth year had started, and Malfoy hadn’t even bothered to speak to Harry, not even to point out how stupid his scar was. Sometimes, from the corner of his eye, he could see Malfoy staring at him, probably thinking of a clever way of hexing Harry without getting caught. Sometimes at night, when Malfoy thought everyone in the dorm was sleeping, Harry could hear small scratching and scrunching noises. Malfoy was probably writing letters to his mother, but why in the middle of the night? Was he hiding so nobody would find out if they were plotting against Harry? He closed his eyes and tried to listen for any unusual sounds coming from Malfoy’s bed. He could hear Mcmillan’s light snoring to his right but other than that...nothing.</p><p><br/> Okay, maybe he was being a tad paranoid. Even if he wasn’t, he’d always been able to outdo Malfoy in the past<span>—</span>if the ferret was up to something, Harry knew how to defend himself. He punched his pillow and laid on his side trying to find a comfortable position. He still had some trouble sleeping; if it wasn’t because of his nightmares, it was because of the awkwardness of sleeping on a decent bed after spending months in the tent he’d shared with Ron and Hermione.</p><p><br/> He was finally dozing off when a shuffling sound came from his left.</p><p> </p><p><em>Malfoy, </em>his mind sparked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry immediately cast a Muffliato on his mattress (the springs creaked sometimes) and jumped into a kneeling position on the foot of his bed to peek through his curtains. He didn’t have his glasses on, but he could still distinguish Malfoy’s white-blond hair in the darkness. He was walking across the room, only stopping to quietly open the door and exit the dorm. The little voice that sounded like Hermione in Harry’s mind stopped him from following; the last time he’d followed Malfoy things had ended up pretty badly. He lay on his back as several theories about what his former arch-nemesis was doing popped into his mind. There was something fishy in this whole situation, and Harry had to find out.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/> Headmistress McGonagall had changed the rules this year, and allowed students to sit wherever they pleased in an effort to strengthen Inter-House camaraderie. Malfoy and Neville were chatting amicably as they ate breakfast at the Slytherin table. A few weeks after the term had started Harry had noticed they were quite civil with each other, but a few days ago they had started sitting together in class too, and now they were <em>laughing</em>. Harry had never seen Malfoy do anything but sneer and smirk. It was so strange, not only to see him being friendly for once<span>—</span>and with Neville<span>—</span>but to see such an open and sincere expression from him. Was Malfoy trying to gain Neville’s trust to serve his own dark and mysterious purpose?</p><p><br/> "We should go to Hogsmeade today. Have a drink at the Three Broomsticks," Ron said, eyeing Harry. He and Hermione had noticed the bags under Harry’s eyes, but they’d blamed it on the nightmares he’d told them he was having.</p><p><br/> Truth was Malfoy had made a habit of sneaking out of the dorm at midnight, and Harry didn’t sleep until he was back; he still had no clue about what was going on.</p><p><br/> "Yeah, sure." Harry yawned and tore his gaze off of Malfoy. "A drink. Why not.”</p><p><br/> "Good," said Hermione, clearly relieved. "We should visit Hagrid first and then go to Scrivenshaft’s before the Three Broomsticks."</p><p><br/> "Yeah. Scrivenshaft’s,” he said absently as he saw Malfoy and Neville standing and leaving the Great Hall. There was definitely something fishy going on.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The place was empty except for a couple of fourth-years. Harry, Ron and Hermione were walking around looking for the school supplies they needed when Malfoy entered the shop alone. He noticed the trio, and Harry could see a blush spreading on his pale neck.</p><p><br/> "Ah, Mr. Malfoy! Your order arrived yesterday." The shopkeeper grinned as he reached for a package under the counter.</p><p><br/> "Good afternoon, Mr. Woodbead," Malfoy said, clearing his throat.</p><p><br/> "I made sure to get a sketchbook with the smoothest paper surface texture<span>—</span>lightweight, just the way you like it<span>—</span>charcoal, and blending stumps. Make sure to let me know if everything worked for you."</p><p><br/> "Yes. Thank you, sir," Malfoy said quietly, leaving a few galleons and sickles on the counter. "Good day." He looked at Harry again and left the shop.</p><p><br/> "Is there an art class that we don’t know about?" Hermione asked, noticing Harry had been staring.</p><p><br/> "Not that I know of. Luna would’ve mentioned it; you know how she likes to paint," Ron said.</p><p><br/> "The things Malfoy just bought. They’re art supplies used for drawing," Hermione responded at Harry’s confused frown.</p><p><br/> The scratching noises at night started to make sense. Malfoy wasn’t writing, he was drawing. Was it possible that he was doing nothing wrong?</p><p><br/> "I’ve heard noises in the dorm. Maybe he’s drawing at night when nobody’s watching?" he said, trying to sound casual.</p><p><br/> "Anyway," Ron shrugged. "Should we head to the Three Broomsticks?"</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It had already been four days since he had seen Malfoy at Scrivenshaft’s, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about what he could be doing, but now it was more in a curious way rather than suspicious. Harry could imagine why Malfoy wouldn’t want anyone to see his drawings<span>—</span>probably thought he would be mocked for it. Still, it didn’t explain Malfoy’s nightly escapades. Harry had a hunch that maybe he went to the Astronomy Tower to draw constellations or something of the sort, and he was seriously considering the idea of following Malfoy under the Invisibility Cloak.</p><p><br/> "Mr. Malfoy, is there something you’d like to share with Mr. Potter? If not, I would very much appreciate it if you would join the rest of the class in today’s lesson," McGonagall said sternly. Harry immediately turned to look at the blond who looked down at his parchment with bright red cheeks.</p><p><br/> "I apologize, Headmistress,” said Malfoy, clearly mortified that he’d been caught staring.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt a strange sensation nudging him in the ribs<span>—</span>curiosity, maybe? He turned his gaze back to the front of the class, but quickly found himself lost in his thoughts.</p><p><br/> Maybe Malfoy wasn’t really up to something insidious as he'd thought.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had always prided himself on how much he and his friends had matured after the war, but now he admitted that holding a childish grudge against someone who’d had no choice other than doing what he was told to stay alive maybe wasn’t so mature after all. He’d given speeches about making the effort to forget old prejudices, but he wasn’t giving much of an example, was he? He was getting intrigued by this new Malfoy. Malfoy seemed to have left their old school rivalry behind...maybe it was time Harry did the same.</p><p><br/> By the end of the class Harry had made a decision.</p>
