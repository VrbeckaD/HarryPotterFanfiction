  <span>It'd been a few weeks since Newt had returned to England and given the Blood Pact to Dumbledore. His efforts in France had forced the Ministry to lift his travel ban and stop surveying him on a constant basis. He was pretty sure Theseus played a role in that too, but he didn't really mind all that much. What mattered was destroying the Blood Pact, going after Grindelwald, and getting Queenie and Credence back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nagini, Jacob and Tina were all staying with him at this time. Jacob would be returning to America soon to continue business as usual, provided he not tell anyone about his experiences in the magical world, and Nagini had nowhere to go after Credence joined Grindelwald. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina was continuously being brought into the Ministry for questioning. Newt and Theseus both protested and Tina's answers were always the same, but the Ministry was never happy. She was also in state of depression over her sister, which didn't help during the inquiries. In the most recent one, she disarmed her interrogators and put a Silencing Charm on all of them and then stormed out with the Scamander brothers on her heels, Theseus lightly reprimanding her and Newt smiling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can say with absolute certainty, Newt, that I understand why you don't like your own government," she'd said when they reached the Floo outlets. "No offense, Theseus." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nothing seriously taken, Miss Goldstein," the older Scamander brother replied and the three of them stepped into the green flames. </span>

  <span>"When can I expect you for dinner, Newt?" Theseus asked as he walked Tina and his brother to the door of Newt's house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Soon, I hope," Newt said, his default response by this point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And maybe you'd like to join us, Miss Goldstein?" Theseus added, casting a hopeful glance at Tina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Depends on whether the Ministry is willing to let me and Mr. Kowalski return to the States," she replied honestly. "But thanks for the invite." She magicked the door unlocked and stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"She certainly is interesting," Theseus said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Isn't she?" Newt said, a little sheepishly. He gave his older brother a pat on the arm and followed Tina inside.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was in the middle of removing her coat when he came in. She seemed even more down today than any of the other times she'd been called in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tina...?" Newt said, shrugging out of his own coat and hanging it up behind the front door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He must have gotten her out of her reverie because she quickly wiped her eyes and hung up her coat next to his. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm fine," she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh you're back already," Bunty, Newt's assistant said, poking her head up from the basement. "How'd it go?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Same as it's been, Miss Bunty." Tina said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How's the Kelpie?" Newt asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Being less temperamental now that you're home, but he's not fond of the Muggle you brought with you." Bunty replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kelpie doesn't like that many people in general," Newt said and headed downstairs. "Tina, would you mind helping Bunty with the Niffler babies?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure," Tina replied, following him down, "I could use a good distraction."</span>
</p><p>
