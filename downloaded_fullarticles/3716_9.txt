    <p>Hermione Granger could not believe that she had agreed to this. While she had been doing a whole host of reckless things lately, letting Ginny Weasley set her up on a blind date was the pinnacle. As she did a final check of her hair and makeup before leaving her flat, she felt a strange nervousness building in the pit of her stomach. Ever since she and Ron had parted ways nearly a year prior, her love life had been pretty uneventful. While she certainly wasn't desperate for marriage or children at any time in the immediate future, having someone to share a bottle of wine over dinner or to drag along to various Ministry parties would be a great comfort. As she felt the butterflies being replaced by the tug of Apparition, she said a silent prayer to the gods that Ginny had found her someone with at least an inkling of potential. <br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Draco Malfoy stood at the bar, irritated. He had agreed to come on this stupid date as a favor to Blaise but already found himself coming up with a long list of excuses so that he could leave while the night was still young. As he nursed a glass of Firewhiskey, he noticed Blaise finally approaching. <br/>"You're late, Zabini," he muttered as a way of greeting his old friend.<br/>"Don't be so sour already, Draco. If your date doesn't work out I'm sure you'll be able to summon one of many bimbos to give you some satisfaction tonight," Blaise replied before ordering himself a drink as well. <br/>"Where is your girlfriend anyway? The sooner this starts the sooner I can leave." <br/>"She'll be here in a few minutes. Practice ran a little later than she expected and she wanted to meet up with your date before she came." <br/>"You really have no idea who she's bringing? I swear if she walks in with Millicent Bulstrode I'll strangle you on the spot."<br/>"Calm down mate, I'm sure that it can't possibly be that bad. Besides, you could use a night out of your stuffy flat, as posh as it may be."<br/>Over the next few minutes, the two friends caught up over their drinks, still waiting for their partners to arrive.<br/>"Oi look, there's Ginny now, but who's that with her?" Blaise said, nudging Draco.<br/>"Merlin's beard, that can't be," Draco replied with a groan.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> "Ginevra Weasley, I cannot believe that you won't give me even the slightest hint as to who you've chosen as my date!" Hermione scolded upon meeting her friend in Diagon Alley. <br/>"â€™Mione, would I do you wrong?" The redhead replied, rolling her eyes as she led Hermione toward their destination. "I had to choose someone worthy, that way you'll actually have a date to my wedding once Blaise finally proposes," she finished, frowning. <br/>Just when Hermione had thought up a witty response, Ginny stopped outside of a rather plush looking bar. <br/>"We're here, but first you have to promise me to be on your very best behavior and to not hex him unless he actually deserves it, Hermione," with that Ginny pushed past the burly men outside the doors and into the dimly lit room beyond them. <br/>Feeling nearly sick with nerves, Hermione followed Ginny to the bar. When she finally gathered the courage to glance at the bar she saw the one person she never expected.</p>
