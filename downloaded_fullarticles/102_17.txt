    <p>Harry stared at the rundown building in front of him. This was Midnight Hall? </p>
<p>"So this is what your father left you?" Petunia said, tightly. Harry started he'd forgotten that she'd brought him here. "My parents used to talk about how grand this place was. My mother would say that my father brought her here on their first date." </p>
<p>Dudley shifted boredly beside his mother but said nothing. It wasn't often that his mother talked about her parents. </p>
<p>"Mother said they had the most wonderful shows." Petunia explained. "She was always one for the theater my mother." </p>
<p>"Maybe that's where I get it." Harry muttered not realizing that his Aunt and cousin had heard him. "I'm going inside." </p>
<p>Harry almost wished he hadn't it made him so depressed to see everything in this condition. They explored the theater and everything around it that Harry now owned. </p>
<p>"Looks like dorms." Dudley said, pointing. "Lets go in there." </p>
<p>Harry quickly agreed though they had to force their way in. </p>
<p>"Looks like this place was being used as storage." Petunia said, wrinkling her nose as Harry went into a sneezing fit and Dudley began coughing. Petunia removed the boys when it started to sound like Harry was having an asthma attack. He was able to recover outside. "Well, you can't live here until you can breathe in those rooms. What do you plan to do?" </p>
<p>"Call a fully trained adult wizard." Harry wheezed.</p>
<p>As expected Petunia and Dudley flinched. They were awed when Hedwig dropped down on to Harry's shoulder as if she'd known that the boy needed her. Harry sent a message off and an hour later Remus Lupin was arriving with a great black Grim on his heels. </p>
<p>"Hey, Harry." Remus said, with a smile. "You said you needed help?"</p>
<p>"In there." Harry said, pointing to the dorms. "I'd clean it the Muggle way but my aunt wont me back in because I had some trouble breathing. " </p>
<p>Remus gave an amused smile and got inside. They heard cursing, coughing and sneezing for an hour after that. </p>
<p>"Maybe I should have sent for Mrs. Weasley." Harry said, to Padfoot the Grim who was sitting next to him. "I forgot Remus is a werewolf and extra sensitive to dust and smells." </p>
<p>Padfoot barked sounding amused as he bobbed his head in agreement. </p>
<p>"Werewolf?!" Petunia gasped. </p>
<p>Harry wondered what she was still doing here. </p>
<p>"He's a good one." Harry shrugged as Remus surfaced. "Sorry, Professor." </p>
<p>"Harry, I am no longer your teacher." Remus said, rubbing under his nose. "Please call me Remus." </p>
<p>Harry nodded. He'd actually sent for Sirius which explained why the Grim was here. He wondered how Remus had gotten hold of his letter and why he had come so quickly.</p>
<p>"Will you be staying here then?" Remus asked. "Looks like twelve rooms all together." </p>
<p>"Yeah, and so can you." Harry decided. "I'm going to need help around here because I can't legally use magic yet." </p>
<p>Remus smiled at his friend's son. </p>
<p>"Very well we'll be off then." Petunia stated. </p>
<p>"Yeah thanks." Harry said, earnestly.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin were now in the dorms picking their way through the mess trying to clear a path to the rooms. Harry was telling them all about his dream of being on stage. He was very happy when they supported him and didn't try to deter him. </p>
<p>Once Harry had claimed a room he went to explore the rest of the theater and see what there was. </p>
<p>That night after a shower he climbed on to the top bunk of the beds in his room and stared at the celing. The beds were build into the walls to make the room have more space and Harry approved the beds were actually larger than they had previously looked. He had plenty of room to stretch out. </p>
<p>"How am I going to do this?" Harry wondered, "I've got to get a troupe together and get this place up and running again. I wonder if Remus and Sirius can act? But three people wont be enough we need at least five. " He sighed and ran a hand over his face. "Ugh I really wish I had some help so that I knew what I was doing. Why did dad let this place fall into shambles?" </p>
<p>Suddenly a screen appeared in front of him. It was blue. </p>
<p>
  <b>Your families theater has fallen into disrepair and you need help getting it back going again.</b>
</p>
<p>"That's literally what I just said." Harry deadpanned. </p>
<p>
  <b>You have enough money in the fund to improve something at the theater. You have to spend money to make money. It's the first rule of business. Here is a business screen to help you.</b>
</p>
<p>The only thing that Harry could improve was the sign so he did. In his mind that seemed to be pointless right now. There were more important things that needed fixing but he guessed he had to do as the screen wanted. With that the screen closed. </p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes and went to sleep.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry was annoyed. How could Remus not know how to cook? How did the man survive?! Sirius he could understand but Remus? Anyway here he was cooking breakfast for the both of them. </p>
<p>
  <b>Cooking-1</b>
</p>
<p>Harry was offended but also confused. He had stupidly assumed that this power was linked to the theater and would only help him with the theater. He hid his shock though and quickly finished cooking. He served it up and they ate. Harry then got stuck washing dishes as he'd sent Remus out with some muggle money and a list of flowers to buy. </p>
<p>
  <b>Dishwashing-1</b>
</p>
<p>Again Harry was offended. </p>
<p>After breakfast they went outside. Harry did some stretches and started to clean up in front of the theater. He practiced his singing as he did. Padfoot just ran around. </p>
<p>
  <b>Sweeping-1</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Singing-1</b>
</p>
<p>People stopped to watch him and he didn't know why. He didn't think his singing was that good and all he was doing was sweeping and picking up trash in front of theater. </p>
<p>"Okay, Harry, I got those flowers." Remus said, when he got back. "Now what?" </p>
<p>Harry grinned and they began planting the flowers in the dirt plots in front of theater walls. </p>
<p>
  <b>Gardening-1</b>
</p>
<p><i>'This power is already pissing me off.'</i> Harry thought to himself. </p>
<p>"Potter?" a voice Harry knew well called.</p>
<p>Harry stood up having finished and sure enough there was Draco Malfoy with his parents. Padfoot stood in front of Harry growling. </p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" Draco Malfoy demanded.</p>
<p>"Well, not that it's any of your business but I own this place now." Harry explained. "I'm trying to brighten up the place with these flowers and fix it up you know. Then I'll get a troupe going and get this place back up on it's feet." </p>
<p>"Do you act?" Draco asked. </p>
<p>"Everyday." Harry deadpanned. "What are you doing here?" </p>
<p>"Going for a walk." Draco shrugged. "My grandparents met in this theater and we come here on their anniversery. They both loved theater. My grandmother was in a troupe here." </p>
<p>"Wow, really?" Harry asked, his eyes lighting up at the information. "Do you like acting?" </p>
<p>"Yeah." Draco answered. </p>
<p>"Great!" Harry said, "Then you can join my new troupe! " </p>
<p>"How many people are there?" Narcissa asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. </p>
<p>"Me and your son." Harry answered. "You know I do some writing and I like to write plays. I wrote one with the Slytherins in mind." </p>
<p>"Really?" Draco asked. </p>
<p>"You're the main male role in it. Greengrass was the main female, then Zabini and Nott were Best Male mates 1 and 2 respectfully, Parkinson and Davis were Best Female Mates 1 and 2 respectfully ." </p>
<p>"Replace Pansy." Draco said, shaking his head. "She can't act to save her life. She'd ruin the whole thing. Can I see the script?" </p>
<p>Harry soon had the Malfoy's inside the dorms and Draco was sitting on a molding love seat with his mother reading the script Harry had wrote around Christmas. Harry was picking things up and slipping them into his Inventory which the screen had just decided to tell him about. Padfoot was growling at Lucius Malfoy but was staying near the sliding glass door and Remus was reading another copy of the script. </p>
<p>"Why am I the lead here?" Draco whined. "and how do you know us all so well? These lines and roles are perfect for Blaise and Theo but I think you got Pansy all wrong. No way would she comfort a distraught friend." </p>
<p>"Well, I don't know any of the other Slytherin girls well enough." Harry shrugged. "I was thinking of forming a Drama Club at Hogwarts and have troupes for all Houses. Like a Slytherin troupe who would perform on Dec. 1st. Ravenclaw Troupe would perform on Feb. 1st. Hufflepuff would perform on April. 1st. Gryffindor would finish it out on June 1st. But, I realized that was just stupid." </p>
<p>"Why?" Lucius asked, "I'm sure you boys can't be the only ones who love acting." </p>
<p>"We're probably not but everyone would need training and we couldn't fall behind on our school work. It just isn't possible. Tempers would run high and everything. " </p>
<p>"Whose doing the set designs?" Draco asked. </p>
<p>"I was thinking of asking Dean Thomas. " Harry said, still cleaning. "You don't know this but he's an amazing artist. and he's just started studying Magical art with a passion. " </p>
<p>"Astoria Greengrass could do costumes." Draco thought outloud. "You don't know this but she's studying to be a fashion designer and she's really good at it." </p>
<p>The two talked and talked actually shocked that they were getting along. The Malfoy's got to see and taste first hand Harry's cooking. They all loved it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When Harry went the front of the theater the next morning he was shocked to find Slytherin's waiting for him. </p>
<p>"Ugh, too early for this." Harry complained leading them inside. </p>
<p>"You need to remove Pansy from the script!" Daphne Greengrass stated. "I refuse to be on the same stage as her!" </p>
<p>"Ugh, way too early." Harry whined. "Okay, she's out but we need a Best Female Mate 1." </p>
<p>"I think you could pull off a skirt if I made it properly." Astoria Greengrass said, circling Harry. "Yes, I can see it and didn't Draco say you wanted to be on stage as well? It may not be the lead but it would get you on stage." </p>
<p>Harry blushed was this really happening? How had this happened so fast? He needed to contact Dean if things were going this fast. </p>
<p>"When will the show go on?" Tracy Davis asked. </p>
<p>"Before September 1st." Harry explained. "We'll still continue practicing at school and can get some port keys made that will bring us back here for shows and stuff. I've already decided that but we'll be managing this and O.W.L.S. this year." </p>
<p>"Bring it on!" Theo said. "there is no Weasley's involved in this right?" </p>
<p>"As of now? No." Harry answered with a smile. </p>
<p>"Then lets begin practice." Blaise Zabini stated. "Is there a practice room?" </p>
<p>"Uh......" </p>
<p>"It's this way." Sirius called, coming into view scratching his stomach and yawning. "But you're not going to like the state of it." </p>
<p>He was right of course. It was like someone threw a party in there and didn't clean up. </p>
<p>
  <b>Draco Malfoy has joined your Troupe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Daphne Greengrass had joined your troupe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Blaise Zabini has joined your Troupe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Astoria Greengrass has joined your Troupe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theo Nott has joined your Troupe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Tracy Davis has joined your Troupe.</b>
</p>
<p>Harry was very pleased as they went to on to have a script reading and get a feel for each others acting skills as Astoria took their measurements and held up different kinds of fabrics to them.</p>
