    <p>
  <em>before</em>
</p><p>As a boy, Draco had never given all that much thought to romance. He'd forgotten it was a concern at <em>all, </em>until Blaise Zabini notified him of Pansy Parkinson's dreadful crush on him their third week at Hogwarts, and he tried not to be thoroughly disgusted. He didn't mention a word of it to her, and by their sixth week, she'd moved on to mooning over Theodore Nott instead.</p><p>Valentine's day at Hogwarts passed quickly during Draco's first year. At eleven, love wasn't exactly at the forefront of his mind. He noticed, of course, the longing looks thrown across the Great Hall between the older students- he wasn't as dense as <em>Potter, </em>who didn't even appear to realise it was Valentine's day at <em>all. </em>But it simply wasn't of any interest to him. No, Draco was instead drawn to the push and pull of his rivalry with Harry Potter, something that seemed to leave him far more breathless than any thought of Pansy's pretty hair or Daphne's sly smile.</p><p>Draco watched Crabbe stare at the back of Padma Patil's head in Herbology, and wondered if there something was wrong with him, fleetingly, before being distracted by the sound of Potter's name in passing conversation. The only discussion his classmates had been having all day was about each other, caught up in the fantasy of securing a significant other before their teenage years hit, and Draco was bored to death by the lot of it.</p><p>What did it matter that he'd never wanted anybody? He was old enough to want, certainly, but still young enough to not. Young enough not to realise.</p><p>“I suppose I'm just a late bloomer,” he overheard Pansy confessing tearfully to Daphne one evening the following week, and restrained the urge to scoff. One or two girls in their year resorting to bras didn't make her <em>late</em> in any way, shape, or form, but he heard some truth in the words. Perhaps that was all he was. <em>Late</em>.</p><p>It wasn't as if he were the <em>only</em> one: <em>Potter</em> didn't appear to have any specific interest in anyone, as far as Draco knew. Unless it was Granger he wanted, if bushy hair and shrill diligence were what attracted him. Maybe it was <em>Weasley</em> he liked- now <em>that</em> was a thought. Were red hair and a large appetite really what the great Harry Potter looked for in a partner? It would certainly be a Gryffindor, or at least some Muggleborn or Blood traitor or something of the sort, so far from the class of wizard he <em>should</em><em>'ve</em> been associating with.</p><p>Though… Potter and someone like Pansy: not quite a match made in heaven. Potter would likely fall victim to Pansy's woeful affections eventually, if only briefly, but Draco couldn't envision Potter reciprocating those feelings. Slytherins seemed to be nothing but an annoyance to him, far from anything he'd consider in terms of a relationship, let alone a marriage- one to continue the sacred Potter bloodline. Draco couldn't imagine that was something he cared about all that much.</p><p>But then, Draco didn't really know him at all.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Did late count if it lasted yet another year?</p><p>Valentine's day at Hogwarts was at its worst during Draco's second year. Pink plastered the walls from top to bottom: blushing flowers unfolding upon the arches of windows and origami hearts falling like rain. Draco felt rather sick to his stomach at the scene, head still swimming from the night before, when Fay Dunbar had cornered him after dinner and leaned precariously into his space, asking if he were going to send anybody a Valentine- Draco had blanched at the suggestive hope in her tone, and for a taut, terrifying moment, had thought she were about to kiss him. Her face had been startlingly close and her lips shiny with the over-application of lip gloss, and Draco hadn't felt a thing but terror.</p><p>Malfoy's were always dignified, except when they were running from pretty girls that wanted to kiss them.</p><p>His odd reaction had plagued him well into the night and remained fraught on his mind the next day. Fay shot him a glare from across the Great Hall at breakfast, confetti obscuring her face as it drifted down, and Draco only felt tired. Enough of worrying about girls and kissing, what could he do to antagonise Potter today? The year so far had been especially good in winding him up, watching his face contort in fury as Draco hurled insults at his friends, followed in his footsteps as Seeker and pushed and teased and snickered until Potter was glaring at him with those blazing green eyes, angry and focused only on Draco.</p><p>An opportunity presented itself by the end of the day: Ginny Weasley and her pathetic schoolgirl crush. Draco was all prepared to laugh until his stomach hurt, grinning in wait as a singing dwarf managed to ambush Potter and waylay him long enough to deliver his Valentine.</p><p>
  <em>I wish he was mine, he's really divine. </em>
</p><p>And that was when it all went to shit.</p><p>Potter stared up at the dwarf in mortified horror, mouth half-open, glasses slipping down his nose, green eyes bright as anything behind those lenses and Draco's stomach flipped in a strange, wobbly way.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh <em>no</em>.</p><p>Late bloomer was beginning to sound less plausible as hot envy rose in him, flying from his mouth as he publicly mocked Potter for his diary, pretending to himself that the deep need unfurling in him to see the secrets inside was for bullying purposes rather than frantic curiosity. His spiking emotions only grew as the dramatics came to an anti-climactic close, and he was unable to prevent himself from throwing a snide comment after Weasley, delighting in the way she turned a horrible shade of red and how her face creased in humiliated despair.</p><p>Potter was nothing but a nuisance to Draco, or so he had thought. Now, he was feeling some fairly intense, undefined feelings for him, ones that sent his head spinning and his heart reeling whenever they were in the same room. He was grateful, at least, for his apparent subtlety. Either that, or Potter was utterly oblivious to the fresh pink on Draco's cheeks as he teased and the tremble of his hands, shaking with excitement at any attention he received. Had it always been like this? Not consciously, certainly, but looking at it, it wasn't such a ridiculous notion. There had always been a want, when he saw Potter. A want to coax a reaction from him, break his façade and witness him: raw and real and stripped bare, who he was without the title of the Boy Who Lived. Perhaps that want ran even deeper.</p><p><em>Am I gay?</em> he wondered to himself, and whispered it into the privacy of his bed one night, curtains drawn and a quietening charm cast upon himself. Gay. The word felt wrong on his tongue and entirely detached from him, somehow. But some sore and hidden part of him came alight, spreading quick and sickly through his stomach, and it made sense of a lot. His steadfast lack of attention to girls. His endless yearning instead for <em>Potter's</em> attention, that jolt of energy he'd feel whenever their eyes met, the hours he'd spend dreaming up barbs and retorts he could fire Potter's way, to see that look of indignation on his face, a pure and honest reaction, so much more than all those stories of his greatness.</p><p>His face. Ever set in a resentful scowl around Draco, but sometimes, bright and open with laughter at the Gryffindor table, an expression that Draco Malfoy would never induce from him. But he wanted to. Merlin's beard, he wanted to.</p><p>He wanted.</p><p>Draco always got the things he wanted. Once, he'd been desperate to find the Chocolate Frog card of Salazar Slytherin, and his mother had consecutively bought him one hundred and twenty three of the things before he'd found it, sitting on the floor of Sugarplum's sweetshop and tearing them open one by one. Another time, he'd asked for the Vibes Twins' new album, and asked for it <em>immediately</em>, and within the hour his father had ventured out and retrieved it for him, sating him for another week before there was some other possession he desired. After that, it had been his pleading for a Comet 260 that had resulted in an especially good Christmas, and an especially good gift. Draco had never gone hungry a day in his life, and had always gotten his way.</p><p>Now, here was a lesson in humility.</p><p>So much for laughing at schoolgirl crushes: he seemed to be sporting one of his own.</p><p>That didn't stop him from taunting for the rest of the year, desperate and longing for Potter's eyes on him, to hear that venom-filled voice to work its way around the syllables of Draco's surname, to experience the exhilaration that came with making Potter feel <em>anything</em>. What other possible way was there to get his attention? At the end of the year, as Potter traipsed into the Celebration Feast with bruises on his jaw and cuts and scrapes licking along his arms and hands, Draco finally accepted the fact that he was utterly and irrevocably infatuated with his great rival. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the hero who conquered the Dark Lord, and Draco Malfoy's dirty little secret.</p><p>What on earth would his father have to say about that?</p><p>Gay was one thing. Gay for the bespectacled git who was responsible for the downfall of his father's previous master was another thing altogether. Potter was all he thought about, really. All he dreamed about. All he searched for when he entered a room, desperate and hopeful to see him, let his eyes trace the curve of his smile and drink in the dark caramel of his skin, the ever-ruffled ebony of his hair. So, this was what desire felt like. Funny. He'd known about the easier parts: the lovesick staring and incessant, obsessive babbling about them. He'd imagined those to be the <em>hard</em> parts, watching his friends and classmates experiencing them and feeling vaguely ill at the thought of it all, but then… nobody had informed him about everything else. The embarrassment, the loneliness, the fear.</p><p>The yearning.</p><p>It was full and white-hot and it hurt so <em>good</em>. It was endless, a faint heaviness that was always present in him, as constant and steady as the sea. Draco didn't stand a chance against the tide.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Summer that year was hard, far harder than it had been the year before. On the train ride home he'd convinced himself that it would be fine, that this was it, that distance would be the cure to his horrible, embarrassing passion for Potter. But puberty made its sudden and cruel entrance during those few agonising months, and so Potter dug his claws in even deeper to Draco's poor heart, the allure at the concept of their mouths together too much for him to put out of his mind. He felt pitiful, muffling his moans in the dark with his hand over his mouth, biting down on his lower lip until he was sure that Potter's name wouldn't spill from his mouth, drawing blood as he did so, tasting it wet and coppery on his tongue. If he said it out loud, it would become real.</p><p>It wasn't real when he saw Potter again, taller now and filling out into his clothes a little, but somehow still retaining the scrawny build that Draco had grown used to. Draco was burning with worry about Potter's apparent fainting incident on the train, but of course, veiled it with a mask of mocking. It was the only way to conceal the truth, a secret so big that Draco feared if it ever got out he would die from the sheer humiliation of it.</p><p>It wasn't real when that familiar and wretched desire for Potter to just <em>look at him, look at me pleasepleaseplease </em>flared up again, sending him all arrogant and defensive like usual, the only emotions he could use to hide his jittery excitement. He was only spurred on by Potter's eyes, so <em>green</em>, now on him. It caused him a minor arm injury, but at least Draco now had something sustained to force Potter's focus onto him.</p><p>It wasn't real when they all slept down in the Great Hall, rows upon rows of students all trussed together, and Draco positioned his sleeping bag only a short distance from Potter. Blaise eyed him shrewdly, but watching Potter sleep made it all worth it, seeing how his expression went lax and his breathing evened out, putting him at peace for perhaps the first time since Draco had met him. He kept his eyes open until they burned, heavy with the desire for sleep, drooping as he continued to gaze at Potter, struck by his soft skin, his pretty mouth, the delicate fall of his eyelashes.</p><p>It wasn't real until Potter fell from his broom, body dropping from the sky like a bird, but with no indication that he could fly.</p><p><em>But I love him</em>, he thought, <em>he can't die because I love him.</em></p><p>Ironically, it was the same day that as they shared a friendly game of chess, Blaise finally asked: “do you fancy Potter?”. Shocked and mortified, Draco was helpless to prevent the rush of blood to his cheeks, tinting his face pink, stealing any denial from his lips. His hand began to shake around the bishop he had gripped between his fingers. Blaise pressed on. “Be honest, Draco. I see the way you look at him- and today… your <em>face</em>. I thought you were about to <em>cry</em>.” Blaise, apparently feeling daring, reached across the board and plucked the piece from Draco's hand, setting it down. His voice had gone soft and kind. “It actually makes a lot of sense. You never shut up about him. You spend all your time trying to rile him up. And… the staring, Draco. It's ridiculous. Tell me, do you…?”</p><p>Draco nodded miserably, hands still trembling. A stuttering, choked breath pushed from his lungs, and he was too afraid to meet Blaise's eyes. “I think I love him,” he admitted, small.</p><p>“Shit.” Blaise inhaled, sharp, pitying. “How long?”</p><p>“I don't know. Maybe… always?”</p><p>“<em>Always</em>?”</p><p>“Not always. I don't know, I mean... I haven't always <em>known</em>, but I think I always… just a bit. It's confusing- there was definitely a time I hated him, and then all of that was gone. Suddenly I didn't hate him at <em>all, </em>and I think I realised that I never really <em>did</em>. I always wanted <em>something</em>, and I...”</p><p>“I'm sorry, Draco,” Blaise murmured, clearly sympathetic to the rising hysteria in Draco's voice, the quiet panic and growing sorrow in his eyes. “Really, I am.”</p><p>Heart aching and vision blurring, Draco replied: “so am I.”</p><p>And so life went on. But this time, Draco Malfoy was in love.</p><p>Loving Harry James Potter was this: soft, extended longing, stretching out forever in his heart, only faltered by the knowledge that <em>having</em> Harry Potter's love would be entirely different. It would be bright and coarse and real. It would be that brash Gryffindor nerve translated into feeling, and Harry's hands would be rough when they cupped Draco's face and his lips would be bitten raw and chapped with cold and perfect, perfect, perfect.</p><p>It would be. If he had it.</p><p>Instead, out of bitter want and spiteful yearning, he lashed out. Went for Hagrid's great beast so Potter would look at him, told himself late at night that while it was all resentment in those eyes, at least Potter was looking in the first place. What he <em>wanted</em> was how Potter had looked at Cho Chang before Gryffindor's match against Ravenclaw, strange and surprised and shy. It was exactly the expression of a clueless boy first discovering girls- Draco had grown accustomed to seeing it, first on Blaise, and then on Crabbe, Theo, Goyle. It made jealousy bloom in him, sudden and fierce, provoking him to cobble together a quick and pathetic plan with Crabbe, Goyle and Flint to throw Potter off, draw his attention back to <em>Draco</em> and forget all about pretty Cho Chang and her subpar Seeker skills.</p><p>The Patronus didn't half knock the wind from him, and the plan lost Slytherin fifty points, but Draco would be lying if he said he wasn't proud.</p><p>Valentine's day came and went with barely a breath, no indication except Blaise disappearing to snog Hannah Abbott in all corners of the Castle. Draco almost didn't realise that a year had passed since he'd fallen headfirst into Potter's charming smile, a whole year wasted to hopeless, endless pining. He was apparently so besotted that he envisioned Potter's floating head in Hogsmeade, so desperate to fall back into the familiarity of his unrequited love. Yet every day was like the first, around Potter. That hot-cold exhilaration whenever he was near, the delirious fantasies that seized his heart, the sickening embarrassment that piqued when he didn't sustain his cool, thrown off by a swift hit from Granger or an angry hippogriff.</p><p>Draco felt a little guilty about leading the silly animal to an execution, but how else would Potter feel anything at all toward him? It was hatred, yes, but better that than indifference. He could see it in Potter's face on the Quidditch Pitch, the wild adrenaline and desperate urgency sparkling in his eyes, the wind sending his hair tangling over his face. Draco couldn't help himself, he finally had the chance to look at Potter <em>all he wanted</em> with no consequence, and attempted as much as he could to prolong the Game, keep Potter up here in his sights, beautiful and free. Another part of him longed to win, competitive ferocity layering his throat, so when he saw a flash of gold, he dived before thinking. But then Potter was racing past him, hand outstretched, and he closed his fist around the Snitch. Frustrated fury shot through Draco, and Flint caught his eye, rage brimming, and the shame hit him like a Bludger to the head. The sea of scarlet encompassed the Slytherin team as they reached the ground, the red washing away the green, drowning away their emerald in favour of ruby. He was so <em>disappointed</em>, almost <em>angry</em> at Potter for the first time since he'd started wanting him, but then he turned.</p><p>Potter had been hoisted above the crowd, and was now holding up the Cup triumphantly, head tilted back with an expression of pure joy and euphoria, glowing in the sunlight. The crimson of his uniform was so striking against the warm umber of his skin, and the ink of his hair was falling into his eyes, which were full with unrestrained elation. There was a grin shaping his mouth that rivalled nothing Draco had ever seen on Potter, it was as clear and bright and new as the fresh coming of spring, as loose and untamed as he'd ever seen him. Draco's heart throbbed in adoration, and he felt as if he were falling in love all over again.</p><p>No wonder Potter's Patronus was a stag: his happiness was the most majestic sight Draco had ever seen in his life, and he held the memory in his palm like the Snitch that he had never caught.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Seeing Potter at the Quidditch World Cup was a sweet surprise, one that almost sent him silent, ashamed to be in the proximity of both his beloved and his father. It hadn't been like this since before he'd started wanting Harry, terribly, horribly, desperately. One glance at his face and Draco's mind was spiralling back to that sunlit day, Potter's face so beautifully open, his smile endless. Draco was helpless against him, against the rush of envy as Potter was entranced by the Veela, against the surge of need to <em>protectprotectprotect</em> as the throng of Deatheaters emerged into the campsite. As jealous as he was of Granger, he knew Potter loved her, so of course: he warned them. Sneered as he did it, maintained that veil of nonchalance, as inside, his heart clamoured for them to go, to <em>run</em>.</p><p>Potter was all in once piece the next time he checked, slipping seamlessly into that old routine of searching for him on the train, simply to antagonise and observe the changes he'd undergone over the summer, use this new knowledge to evolve Potter in his fantasies, make him more current. He seemed to grow more beautiful every year, and Draco <em>wanted</em> him, so damn much. It went even deeper still: Draco loved him. Truly. And when Potter's name came fluttering from the Goblet of Fire, Draco's heart jumped to his throat. <em>No</em>. The frozen shock and horror caught in Potter's expression was enough indication to Draco- this was not his doing. Whatever magic had led to Potter being chosen, it was down to forces beyond his control. So much for protecting Potter.</p><p>Instead, he stayed up night after night, charming badge after badge, anything to help take Potter's mind off the upcoming challenges. As usual, it was taken the wrong way: what was Draco to expect if he taunted and bullied and teased, acted as if it was a game, and that he hadn't spent days awake engineering the blasted things? It wasn't Potter's fault that Draco was so pathetic and lovesick, willing to resort to any measure for a simple glare. Even as he was thrown across the ground in ferret form, his heart was tripping in his chest with the knowledge that Potter was <em>looking</em>. It was why he started slandering him and his friends to Rita Skeeter, in part out of helpless resentment, and in part due to the expectation of how much attention he'd receive from Potter when that whole fiasco was revealed. It begged the question: how long would Potter last? Would he be around long enough to find out? Potter was about to be thrown into a tournament to the death, and Draco would only be able to watch.</p><p>So he did: hands clenched, white-knuckling around the barrier as Potter walked out in front of a Hungarian Horntail. Practically his whole life revolved around Potter; he couldn't lose him. He had his own wand ready up his sleeve, prepared to do <em>anything</em> to prevent tragedy, to keep his precious rival alive. Then, in typical Potter fashion, it all suddenly turned around, and Potter was <em>winning</em>, soaring above them on his Firebolt, wind in his hair. Draco's heart beat in rapture beneath his breast and his arousal throbbed a rhythm in his trousers, stricken by the display of powerful liberation unfolding before him. Blaise only smirked at him, knowing, and turned to talk to Mandy Brocklehurst instead, leaving Draco to his embarrassing excitement.</p><p>It was Mandy that Blaise ended up asking to the Yule Ball the following month, declaring to Draco that it was out of convenience rather than desire. Pansy, on the other hand, had not been so lucky.</p><p>“I've nobody to go to the Yule Ball with,” she admitted to him one evening, biting back tears as she did so.</p><p>“Is there anyone you'd <em>want</em> to go with?”</p><p>“Terry Boot,” she confessed, glancing at him sideways. “But he's going with Lisa Turpin. He doesn't <em>want</em> me. And now I'll have to go <em>alone</em>-”</p><p>“You won't,” Draco assured. “I haven't asked anyone yet. I could ask you.”</p><p>“There isn't anyone you want?” she prompted after a pause, and Draco hesitated.</p><p>“No,” he decided on.</p><p>Her sorrow cleared so suddenly, like clouds parting to reveal the sun. She beamed at him, eyes still wet with her unshed tears, and nodded. “Friends?” she asked.</p><p>“Friends,” he confirmed, and that was that.</p><p>She looked beautiful that night, though he was no judge when it came to girls. Harry Potter, on the other hand, looked like a wet dream walking. Draco had to adjust himself just looking, mouth going dry as Potter entered the Great Hall all dressed up in his robes, so smart and gorgeous and brilliant. Draco was so stunned by him that he couldn't even bring himself to be jealous, gazing at Potter twirling the Gryffindor Patil sister around the dancefloor. The envy didn't come until after: watching Potter watching Chang, who in turn, watched Diggory. It was hard to focus on Pansy's tipsy presence beside him, a bitter thickness choking at his throat, something that even the alcohol-tinged punch couldn't stem. At one particularly sad glance from Potter to Chang, Draco almost felt his heart would break, bringing hot tears to his eyes, the sound of the Weird Sisters nothing but a faint din in his ears. He was almost too distraught to register the tugging on his arm, pulling at him until until fresh air hit him in a wave, crisp and cold in the winter evening.</p><p>“I'm not a fool, Draco,” Pansy whispered to him as they strolled from the Castle, hand in hand. “I know there's somebody else you want to be here with. I know you lied.”</p><p>Draco didn't say a word.</p><p>“It's Harry Potter, isn't it?” Her voice was sure, and his silence was answer enough. “You've been staring all night. I admit, I see the appeal- he looks dashing tonight. But you've certainly hidden it well. I never imagined it was <em>him</em> you'd go for. I always assumed it would be Blaise, or if you really wanted a Gryffindor, Dean Thomas.”</p><p>“You…?”</p><p>“Knew you were gay? Oh Draco, darling, <em>yes</em>. I've known since first year.”</p><p>First year was a blur to him now, but apart from Potter, he couldn't think of one instance of his latent homosexuality rearing its head. But then that was how girls <em>were</em>, ever-perceptive and always astute, glancing at the ones they loved and knowing a hundred different things about them without any indication. Still. He was rather shocked she'd figured it out.</p><p>“<em>I</em> didn't know then. How could <em>you</em> possibly have guessed it?”</p><p>“One of the many mysteries of female intuition,” she remarked, and she looked so pretty in the moonlight. If his parents forced him to marry, Draco knew his first choice would be Pansy. “I can't tell you, honestly, I just… knew. Harry Potter, though. That's unexpected.”</p><p>“<em>Is</em> it?”</p><p>“Hm,” she considered, and Draco envisioned she was going through something similar to what he did when he realised his feelings. “Perhaps not. You two always were drawn to one another, after all. Like two sides of the same coin.”</p><p>“Don't,” Draco protested feebly. “He doesn't want me.”</p><p>Pansy didn't argue with that, because how could she? Instead, she clenched her hand tighter around his and told him that Potter was a right bloody idiot for not seeing what was right in front of his face, though Draco <em>could</em> consider altering his flirting techniques a little. By the end of the night Draco felt ten times closer to her than he'd ever been, and his mood was only soured by the sight of Potter's frustration as Granger stormed away in a gust of blue fabric and chestnut skin. Amidst all his trauma, Draco couldn't help but wish Harry had experienced one good night. One chance to be a teenager.</p><p>So much for youth.</p><p>Harry Potter was only fourteen as he dived into the depths of the Black Lake to saved his beloved Ron Weasley, the awful red-haired reason that he and Draco weren't fast friends in first year. Harry Potter was only fourteen as he made his way deep into a maze with unseen ends, and returned hours later clutching the body of a fellow classmate, urgent terror bright in his eyes and sickened panic shaping his every breath. Harry Potter was only fourteen as he faced down You-Know-Who alone, lived to tell the tale, and then as a result was made into a pariah by his very own community.</p><p>“Why do things like this happen?” Goyle asked during Dumbledore's speech, bewildered sorrow sharp in his tone.</p><p>“That's war, I suppose,” Draco muttered in reply. “People die. Anybody dies.”</p><p>Draco didn't stand for Harry Potter, because how would that be explained? Hot tears fell from his eyes as he sat, and he didn't wipe them away. Just stared at Potter's figure across the Hall through the blur, longed for that undefined shape to be so far away and so safe, even if it meant Draco would never see him again. Potter was so brave and strong and gentle, still standing, honouring his dead classmate after risking his life to return his body to Hogwarts, even though he himself had endured horrors that nobody his age could begin to imagine.<em> Join us</em>, was the litany in Draco's head as he implored to Potter on the Hogwarts Express, albeit tactlessly. There wasn't an excuse for the things he said, sometimes, and his desperation for Potter to <em>see</em> <em>him</em> didn't exactly make it <em>okay</em>. When he awoke an hour later, crumpled on the train floor with Crabbe and Goyle, Draco couldn't help but think he'd deserved those curses.</p><p>Poor Potter. Something was coming, and he was right at the centre of it all.</p><p>Poor Draco. He was helpless to do anything but follow.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>***</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Prefect. Of course he was. He'd expect nothing less, not when his rivals for the position were the likes of moronic Crabbe and sex-crazed Blaise. Pansy as his female counterpart, however? Draco had to admit, he was surprised- he'd always anticipated it would be Millie, with all her studying and quiet concentration in class, but Professor Snape had his favourites, Draco supposed, and he wasn't opposed to showing them.</p><p>Instead of lingering on the blatant favouritism of his own house, his mind flew to consider the others. Gryffindor, primarily. Would Potter be sitting across from him on the train ride to Hogwarts, a new shiny Prefect badge upon his chest? It would stick out like a sore thumb, contrasted by the unruly mane of Potter's hair and his sweet, crooked grin and his wild gaze. It complemented Draco nicely, but he was all smart and sharp and not at all like beautiful, untameable Potter. Still, it wouldn't exactly look <em>unattractive</em>. Would <em>anything</em> look unattractive on Potter?</p><p>“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed, seeing his face fall as it wasn't Potter that entered the compartment, but Ron Weasley. Smooth, honeyed skin was replaced by freckled fairness, and Draco was clearly unable to hide his disappointment.</p><p>Of course, like usual, he sought Potter out, and couldn't prevent throwing barbs his way after being truly startled by the nervous flutter of his stomach that he hadn't felt since June. Potter always looked like heaven and sex and <em>life</em>, and Draco was incapable of summoning a single coherent thought in his presence. Insides squirming, he mentioned the only thing apart from You-Know-Who that was <em>bound</em> to make Potter react, a simple throwaway remark about his Animagus godfather. Something that would have his mind focused on Draco for a little longer. Draco had been cruel before summer, bringing up Diggory the way he had. One of Draco's many regrets, when it came to Harry Potter.</p><p>This year, his first regret was not asking Potter why his hand was becoming more bloody each day, in the odd but distinct shape of words. Second was not getting over himself and following Potter and his mindless admirers into the Hog's Head, coming forward and confessing that he wasn't exactly as he seemed, that he didn't <em>want</em> You-Know-Who to take over the Wizarding World, that it was only <em>Potter</em> he wanted. Next was not capitalising on every chance he had to speak to him, coming across him alone in the library, under the Beech tree by the Black Lake, the Owlery, and so on. Potter was so unaware of the significance he had in Draco's life, and Draco was sure that in Potter's eyes, he was nothing but a background irritant. How pathetic.</p><p>“Draco, darling, your turn: truth or dare?” Pansy asked one Friday night in the Slytherin common room, well past midnight, all of them drunk off their minds and giggling at every interaction. The game had been brewing for what felt like eternity now, the drunken haze of his mind appearing to distort time itself.</p><p>“Truth,” he said recklessly, only aware enough to remember that his previous questions hadn't been all that bad, rather than consider what they <em>could</em> be.</p><p>“If you had to pick a Gryffindor,” Daphne interjected, laughing girlishly and oblivious to the sudden and hopeless panic spreading the faces of Pansy and Blaise, “who would you snog?”</p><p>“Harry Potter, of course,” Draco confessed, Veritaserum and Firewhisky stinging his throat from earlier. As soon as the words left his mouth he realised, almost shocked from his alcohol-addled stupor, cold horror rushing to his face. His deepest, darkest secret. Slipping out in a fifth year game of truth or dare. How fucking <em>typical</em>. Everyone had gone silent, shock and tension layering between them all.</p><p>“Harry Potter?” Daphne finally repeated, and Draco looked to her in panicked mortification, knowing that the others were fixing him with that same strange, bemused stare. Daphne. Crabbe, Goyle, Theo. All of them. Thank Merlin that Millie had passed out hours ago, and wasn't here for the bare exposure of Draco Malfoy's heart. “Why… Is that why you've always been so… obsessed?”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco admitted, unable to do anything else, compelled by the potion in his bloodstream. “I've wanted him forever.”</p><p>His voice was finally breaking, tears rushing forward and pricking at his eyes, and Pansy was up before anyone could do anything, yanking him by the arm to the dormitories. The door to the boys' room slammed shut, and a sob heaved from Draco as Pansy came forward to hold him; he couldn't stop the cries shaking from his chest. How utterly and completely humiliating. No matter how Pansy comforted him, there was no denying that he was now in danger of being outed to the entirety of Hogwarts <em>and</em> have his hopeless crush on Harry Potter exposed. The others crept in hours later, so late that dawn was likely creeping over the horizon, and Draco heard them through the thin curtains around his bed, whispering to one another. Despite Quidditch being tomorrow- well, today- he'd been unable to sleep after Pansy left, too worried about the conversation in the common room and what it might result in.</p><p>“Was he being serious?” Theo was murmuring, shifting as he slipped into pyjamas.</p><p>“He was drinking Veritaserum,” Goyle answered. “We all were.”</p><p>Silence followed, and Theo let his breath out in a surprised rush. “I'll admit, I feel sorry for the bloke. He's got it bad.”</p><p>They <em>pitied</em> him. It was almost as bad as despising him.</p><p>“What do we do?” Crabbe asked, and terror leapt in Draco's chest.</p><p>“<em>Nothing</em>,” Blaise hissed in an instant. “Why would we do <em>anything</em>? Tease him for it, maybe, but only on a good day. You say anything to anyone, Crabbe, <em>anyone</em>, and I swear I'll hex you into next week. Draco may be in love with <em>Potter</em>, of all people, but he's still Draco. Even if that's synonymous for 'gay for a bespectacled Gryffindor prat'.”</p><p>Draco heard the dramatic flounce of Blaise throwing himself onto his bed, and felt the ice of his heart warm a little. Blaise and Pansy. What would he do without them? They were still by his side, despite the alienation he would likely receive from his House. From now on… things would be difficult.</p><p>Draco hated Potter, <em>hated</em> him for doing this. Making a Malfoy so weak, and being far too oblivious to tell. <em>I hate you</em>, he thought the next day, feeling that familiar bitter sting of disappointment as Potter beat him to the Snitch. There was venom in his tone and poison spewing from his mouth as he touched down on the Pitch, going for Weasley more than he already had with that song he and Blaise had prepared last week, and then, of all things: Potter's mother.</p><p><em>I hate you</em>, he thought, wind knocked from his lungs as Potter tackled him to the ground, Draco's cruel remarks ringing in both of their ears. <em>Merlin's beard, I hate you. </em></p><p><em>I love you,</em> he thought, as Potter's fists collided with his face, as his own blood choked him, self-loathing unfolding in his heart. <em>Merlin's beard, I love you. </em></p><p>Draco didn't hate him at all, he just wanted him. Wanted him so much he was fucking <em>stupid</em> about it, treated him terribly just for attention, and now here they were: Draco bruised and Potter banned from Quidditch. It wasn't what Draco had wanted- what <em>had</em> he wanted? Why had he said such things? There wasn't excuses, only explanations, and weak ones at that. Perhaps he deserved to watch as Potter went off on a date with Chang, tiny smile on his face and a flush on his cheeks. Merlin, he was beautiful. He deserved everything, the whole world, and if to Potter that was a perfect little nuclear family, then Draco wouldn't stand in the way. Instead, like usual, he wept into Pansy's robes, let her see him all vulnerable and heartbroken like nobody ever had.</p><p>This year felt like his worst yet: he read about Potter's trauma in the Quibbler and ached for him, cried for the lost future that Harry Potter had never experienced. Let Blaise kiss him during another game of Truth or Dare, shut his eyes and pretended it was Potter, brought himself off later to the pretend press of Potter's lips against his. Joined the blasted Inquisitorial Squad so he could see Potter more, keep an eye on him under the façade of his frequent and expected bullying. Likely dropped a grade in Charms at the simple breathless excitement of Potter's presence during his OWL. Wanted and wanted and wanted.</p><p>“The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,” Umbridge was saying, and Draco's blood went cold. Violent hatred for her raged within him like a storm, like it had when he'd first started to notice the words etching their way onto the skin on the back of Potter's hand. Draco noticed him. He always, always noticed him, and he'd noticed that, too. The monster- if she were about to torture Potter right here and now… Draco wouldn't let her. His heart seized at the fear on Potter's beautiful, brave face, and he knew he wouldn't let Umbridge touch his boy. Oh, let her try.</p><p>Granger beat him to it, but only just.</p><p>Draco, Merlin help him, was beginning to like her.</p><p>Potter, on the other hand, was quickly becoming less likeable in his eyes. Draco was really quite smitten with him, in all honesty, and had been for years now. More than anything, he was so desperately proud of him for his display at the Ministry, and slightly in awe of how he was both still alive after facing down You-Know-Who <em>again</em> and still standing after so tragically losing his godfather.</p><p>But, then.</p><p>Draco's father.</p><p>To say he felt furious was an understatement. Potter was like that, though. All blind and bumbling impulse with no thought to the consequences of his actions. Of <em>course</em> he'd simply rushed into the Ministry without thinking and ended up landing Draco's father in Azkaban, forcing him to spend months upon months with the Dementors and the other nutters in that forsaken place. They had never been <em>close</em>, not with Draco far preferring his mother, but he <em>respected</em> his father, though he wasn't entirely in support of his beliefs and how far he was willing to take them. His father was a powerful man, and Draco had always been provided for. At fifteen, Potter certainly didn't deserve all the rage of You-Know-Who projected upon him, but Draco felt as if his own wrath was justified. Potter was the reason his father was miles away, locked up and suffering all sorts of horrors. His father would return soon, but Potter really was frustrating sometimes. So focused on his uncompromising view of right and wrong that he was unable to sympathise with anyone slightly different to him, unable to see the intricacies of the situation, the danger that he put others in.</p><p>The danger being You-Know-Who waiting at Malfoy Manor when Draco returned for the summer. Suddenly, it was as if Potter wasn't the centre of his universe any longer.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Dumbledore. The old fool was surely deteriorating, well past his time of being Headmaster, but Potter seemed to practically idolise him. Draco had never seen the appeal- Dumbledore, on occasion, had wise words to speak, but usually it was nothing of any significance. That didn't mean Draco wanted him <em>dead</em>, however.</p><p>More importantly, he didn't want to <em>kill</em> him.</p><p>But what choice did Draco have?</p><p>It was either kill Dumbledore, or die. Kill Dumbledore, or watch his family die. Kill Dumbledore, or prolong the war further.</p><p>The pain had barely begun, but Draco wanted it <em>over</em>. This war. Too many had already died, and it was nothing but an elusive storm to most people at Hogwarts, save for him and perhaps a few of the lot from Dumbledore's Army. Most kids in his year were sheltered and unaware of what being in You-Know-Who's presence felt like: cold and empty and still with fear. How Potter had escaped him year after year, Draco would never understand. Only Potter. Only brilliant, courageous Potter. Draco, the coward, could barely spend ten minutes in the same room as him, having a <em>talk</em>, without needing some air. He supposed he took after his father in that way. In fact, Draco didn't think he'd ever see his father in the same way again. Azkaban was affecting him more than they'd presumed, turning him into a pathetic shell of the refined and composed man he claimed to be. He was no great follower of the Dark Arts: he followed the Dark Lord out of fear.</p><p>As did Draco, now.</p><p>He was so frightened that even the presence of Potter couldn't soothe him. It set him ablaze as it always had, burning and swirling within him, a secret locked in his sore heart. But it didn't eventually slacken to soft want as it had used to. His life had become a rocky path to navigate, and not even his heart full of <em>PotterPotterPotter</em> had been able to withstand the sharp piercing of the Dark Lord and his scrutinising sadism.</p><p>He was so frightened that he happily struck out at Potter, sick while doing so, but perfectly content to snap at him in Madam Malkin's and even resort to violence on the train. Stay alive. It was all there was. Push Potter away- him and his blasted hero complex. He'd likely jump in, ruin everything with his hopeless, reckless touch, sparking from his flushed cheeks, tinted with courage. Potter was so utterly Gryffindor, and Draco couldn't risk him. No, this year, he would have to be kept at arms length.</p><p>And so: Draco tried forgetting to be in love.</p><p>The cabinet. Draco thought often of climbing inside it himself, hiding from the world and waiting out the war. But it wasn't an option- what about his mother? His father could do whatever he pleased as far as Draco was concerned, since he was the reason they were caught up at the centre of this chaos in the first place. But his mother was innocent, and just as dear to Draco as she had always been. Any urges to flee were crushed by the brand of the Dark Mark on his arm, a reminder of what was truly at stake here. Not only his life, but the life of his mother, perhaps the most important person in the world to him, rivalled only by his unwavering devotion to Potter. He'd told her, after that day in Diagon Alley, over a Butterbeer at the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>“I don't think I'll be marrying Pansy,” he declared after multiple remarks on his mother's part, voice shaking and hands white-knuckling around his mug. “I'm gay, Mother.”</p><p>“Oh.” Her eyes had grown wide, face pale, but she was nodding. “I see. How long…?”</p><p>“A while.”</p><p>“Why didn't you tell me earlier? How did you know? When exactly-”</p><p>“Harry Potter,” he replied, providing an answer to all she had and would want to ask. “It's always been him.”</p><p>She had held his hand and let him wipe away tears and listened to his every word, and still loved him. A mother's love. How powerful it could be; it was why Potter was here and therefore something that Draco thanked Merlin for each day. After the war, who knew what world would remain? Who knew which side would win? Draco's only loyalty was to life and his mother, and in current times, this meant loyalty to the Dark Lord, as much as he despised the bastard. Less than an hour spent with the bloke and Draco quickly realised that his own views weren't nearly as bigoted as he had originally thought. He may not particularly understand Muggles, or even like them for that matter, but anybody had to be better than You-Know-Who.</p><p>His desperation grew as time passed. The cabinet wasn't yielding any answers, and Draco turned to curses and poison instead, mind stuck on the vision of his mother sat at home surrounded by Deatheaters. In Draco's dreams, Professor Snape swooped in, snatched the wand from his hand and did it all for him. His mother was murdered. In Draco's dreams, Dumbledore came to him, forgave him, took him in and brought him into the safety of the Order of the Phoenix. His mother was killed. In Draco's dreams, Potter held a hand out and Draco took it willingly, let himself be pulled into fiery Gryffindor courage and the rage against injustice. His mother burned in the heat of the flames.</p><p>Old dreams of Potter still plagued him: green eyes shining in the sunlight and sweet smiles pressed against skin, moans caught between mouths and flower petals folded in the pitch-black of a messy mop of hair. But the cloying, lovestruck adoration didn't remain any longer, and instead gave way to agony, inevitable and inescapable.</p><p>“Why are you betraying me, Draco?” Potter asked, and it brought hot tears to Draco's eyes.</p><p>“I'm sorry,” he replied. “I have to.”</p><p>“I thought you loved me.”</p><p>“I do,” he assured. “I do love you. Like you wouldn't believe. Like nobody has ever loved anyone before.”</p><p>Potter's last kiss tasted like blood, and then he was gone, Draco's everything disappearing into nothing, leaving only phantom kisses and the familiar ache of longing in his wake. Draco thought <em>IloveyouIloveyouIloveyou</em>, and sinking to the ground, shouted it after Potter, screamed it until his voice cracked and his throat was raw, until his lungs felt like they would collapse. Potter didn't return.</p><p>Potter didn't ever return.</p><p>Every night, Draco would wake with fresh fear brimming in his heart, confession balanced on his tongue.</p><p>Draco saw Potter watching. Of <em>course</em> he did, it was something he'd wanted <em>forever</em>. If this were a year before, perhaps, he'd be <em>giddy</em> with it, but now things were different. Draco wasn't fifteen and desperate anymore, he was sixteen and dying. Potter didn't <em>want</em> him, he <em>suspected</em> him. Yet his eyes were as green and glaring as always, and it made Draco no less breathless, treasuring each glance and remembering them later with the curtains of his four-poster drawn, mind briefly and blissfully clear from thoughts of impending doom. Merlin's beard, did Draco want to go to him. Fall to his knees and tell all, beg for asylum and safety and hot kisses amidst a war, warm mornings wrapped up in one another. Draco was stuck in the dark, though, stuck in the night; there was no escape in sight. Potter would never accept him, and terror had such a hold on him that he didn't dare speak the whole truth to any of his friends, sparing them the danger of close encounters with the Dark Lord, even through secondhand description.</p><p>Instead, Draco turned to the only viable candidate: bloody Moaning Myrtle.</p><p>“I'm terrified,” he would often cry.</p><p>“I love him,” was another common sentence.</p><p>Draco didn't mean to hurt Katie Bell, and <em>especially</em> not Weasley. As much as he couldn't <em>stand</em> the ginger prick, he knew Potter cared for him. The thing he would miss the most, actually- Draco remembered it well. The spike of envy as it was revealed that Potter's closest and dearest friend was Ron Weasley, followed quickly by sharp relief as Potter finally emerged from the Lake, gasping for air but completely and beautifully alive. Draco wouldn't dare put Potter through such pain, not on purpose. He was far too weak and far too lovesick to hurt a boy with such life in his eyes and such abandon in his smile. That mess of utterly exhilarating beauty was finally looking back, and now Draco didn't have the time.</p><p>How ironic.</p><p>Draco could mark where it all fell apart: the bathroom. Perhaps he never should have gone to Moaning Myrtle in the first place. There were a lot of things Draco would have done differently in his sixth year, given hindsight.</p><p>It was sheer and utter panic, encompassing mortification, unbridled shame. Nobody enjoyed the idea of their great unrequited love finding them crying like a child. Draco, as he always had, <em>especially</em> when it came to Potter, lashed out. Threw hexes, dodged Potter's own defences to Draco's sudden attack, and even, in a blind rush of fury and thoughtlessness, was entirely prepared to attempt the Cruciatus Curse.</p><p>However angry Draco was, he knew it wouldn't work. Not on Potter. <em>Never</em> on Potter. His dear, idiotic Potter.</p><p>Sharp pain slashed across his stomach, and Draco fell. Because of Potter. Typical- that boy was always making Draco fall, every day, always, endlessly. He knew the blood was pouring out of him, warm and slick from his chest, and felt Potter kneel beside him, closer than he'd ever been off the Quidditch Pitch without an aim to antagonise. If Draco weren't bleeding out, his skin would be on <em>fire</em>. Merlin's beard, he adored Potter. He was so bloody beautiful that it was ridiculous. Miles of skin that looked soft as anything and eyes that made Draco weak in the knees.</p><p>“No- I didn't-”</p><p><em>Didn't know</em>. Draco had never heard the spell before, either. Potter was so stupid sometimes, bumbling into every situation with all the tact of Crabbe and Goyle when they caught Draco gazing over at the Gryffindor table. Draco loved him anyway. Loved him, loved him, loved him.</p><p>It took a few weeks for him to really process what had happened. To truly come to terms with the healing scars traced across his chest like faint red roads on a map, spiralling outwards. <em>Potter</em> had done this to him. <em>Harry</em>. Draco felt he knew him well enough to understand that however much he despised Draco, he was no killer. He was far from cruel. He was <em>kind</em> and <em>sweet</em> and yes, he could be intense at times, especially in a fight, but his <em>face </em>as he'd watched Draco shaking on the floor, blood pooling around him. The shock and the horror. He hadn't <em>meant</em> it, hadn't intended for damage like that, yet it still <em>hurt</em>. Harry had injured him, potentially permanently, and now he was off snogging Ginny Weasley. That was what broke Draco's resolve in the end, and he was helpless against the onslaught of tears that rushed forward in an instant, mere seconds after Pansy broke the news to him. It didn't matter that the whole dorm was watching. It didn't matter that Harry had left scars across his heart- hadn't he always?- that might remain forever. He wept into her shoulder for that poor lost little twelve year old boy that did nothing but <em>want</em>.</p><p>If only he'd known the pain it would cause him.</p><p>Fucking Ginny Weasley.</p><p><em>There are more important things</em>, he thought, standing opposite Dumbledore with his wand raised, hand shaking. <em>Mother</em>.</p><p>“Come over to the right side, Draco.” He imagined it, for a second. Harry throwing him a look of barely concealed awe and surprised respect, and when the war was over, taking him in his arms, pressing joy between them. “You are not a killer.”</p><p>Dumbledore, the fool, was right. His hand slipped lower at the mention of his mercy, and then the door burst open. Draco was no killer, not even with the Deatheaters here. To think he could've done it while alone was laughable. He was only a boy, really, doing this to save his mother, and Merlin help him, his father too. Snape was a killer. Appeared to do it seamlessly, speak the Killing Curse like a simple Charm or even a prayer, and Dumbledore was dead.</p><p>This would break Harry's heart.</p><p>It had certainly broken Draco's, and he'd barely known the man.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy hated Muggles, Mudbloods and Blood traitors. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy was in love with Harry Potter. </em>
</p><p>Two truths that had stood strong against the test of time, but now, Draco wasn't sure about the former. To watch the Dark Lord kill a simple and innocent Professor from Hogwarts, to watch <em>all</em> of this, bigotry in its purest and rawest form… it was illuminating. Draco didn't want this. Draco was <em>seventeen</em>, he wanted to be at school making fun of Harry and <em>wanting</em> him and feeling the wind on his face during Quidditch, drinking Firewhiskey with the other Slytherins and avoiding essays for History of Magic. Not here, witnessing brutality like nothing he'd seen before. He was nothing but a child. A scared, pathetic child.</p><p>A child who wanted his mother safe.</p><p>So he obeyed orders, like any good soldier. Tortured Rowle under duress, cried himself sick afterwards while his mother stroked his hair. Longed for Pansy and Blaise and their sharp wit, for Theo and Daphne and their steady humour, Crabbe and Goyle and their quiet camaraderie, Millie with her raucous laughter. They were with him soon enough, stuffed into a train compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but there was no longer want for any light-hearted bantering. What could be said?</p><p>Daphne began to cry during the Raid for Harry, and Pansy went to her, holding her as she sobbed. Blaise looked as if he wanted to chime in, but thought better of it, diverting his eyes to the floor and biting down hard on his lip, hands clenched into fists at his sides. It was hard for all of them. Knowing that all that was coming would be so incredibly awful, knowing that all they would experience this year was pain. Perhaps most of them had said things in the past, things that were truly vile, but it was quickly becoming clear that those words were parroted views of their parents'. And perhaps it was wrong that it had taken a war for them to realise how disgusting those opinions were, but Draco was too frightened to berate himself and any of his friends for that. If Harry won this, the time to repent would come. That time wasn't now. Instead, his focus was this: staying alive.</p><p>“I will save us all, you know,” Harry told him each night in his dreams, his face so close and so lovely. “But it isn't for you. It's for Ron, Hermione, Ginny. My friends.”</p><p>“I know,” Draco replied, “I know you'll save us. You're incredible. Utterly brilliant. I trust you with all of it- the whole world. I trust that you love them enough to win this thing.”</p><p>“It's more than that. More than them. It's about what's right. You never really got that, did you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Maybe if you had, I'd have seen you. Wanted you back.”</p><p>“You aren't gay. You love <em>her</em>. Ginny.”</p><p>“Then friends, at least. But that's not what I meant.”</p><p>“I know,” he repeated, head over heels for the curve of Harry's mouth, the white flash of his teeth when he grinned, the intoxicating thrum of his presence. Draco's heart tripped beneath his ribs at his proximity, his skin tingling, from his cock to his fingertips. He ached to touch. But Harry wasn't gay. “I'm in love with you.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry said, and his lips were warm and real and Draco forgot, for a while, that people were dying.</p><p>As reality shifted from autumn to winter, the trees bare and barren but tinged with white, Draco dreamt of summer. Harry and almost every season made sense in his head. There was the fresh crispness of autumn that he felt seeing Harry after weeks without, like the clean stiffness of newly washed sheets. Harry fit perfectly amongst the oranges and ambers of nature, during those months. And then, winter: Harry in the snow, his hair obsidian against the raging world of white, eyes sparkling with childlike joy. Christmas was one of those few times the Dark Lord didn't seem to get to him, a day of pure and true happiness that sent Draco reeling. Spring came soon after, flowers blooming bright as Draco's love reared up at the flashes of forearm and collarbone Harry displayed in the blossoming heat. Morning dew dotted the greenery of the Castle, and Draco clung onto every wayward glance, all in preparation for summer.</p><p>Summer- that was his one blind spot, when it came to Harry.</p><p>Maybe he'd caught a glimpse at the Quidditch World Cup, but with its transience and the roaring intensity of excitement that one just didn't get at Hogwarts, he didn't really count it. Harry had looked beautiful in the warm evening blue, and Draco had loved him. Apart from that, his memories didn't present a lot of information. He'd envied Granger and Weasley a lot in those juvenile years, longed to watch Harry honest and relaxed over a summer breakfast, to see the way he spread his jam up close rather than peering across the Hall at him.</p><p>Envy seemed so petty now the streets were filling with innocent Muggle blood.</p><p>Envy seemed so petty now Harry Potter was being dragged into the Manor, a Stinging Jinx warping his face.</p><p>Draco would know him anywhere.</p><p>It wasn't all about looks, when it came to Harry, gorgeous as he was. It was the way he held himself, the way he walked, the way his expressions twitched across his face. His voice when he was angry, when he was happy, when he was confused. His everlasting courage, the furious glare of his loyalty, the song of his laugh echoing throughout the Great Hall like a haunting, ascending phoenix. Draco had been absolutely besotted for half a fucking decade; this boy was ingrained in his very soul, and even if one day, by some miracle, Draco moved on from him, Harry Potter would always be a part of him. Harry Potter would always be entitled to a piece of Draco Malfoy's heart, as first loves often were.</p><p>First love. That was all this had been, back in third year. Now, five years deep with a willingness to quite literally cut out his heart for Harry, Draco was beginning to wonder if he would always belong to Harry. Utterly, entirely, ardently. He'd die before anyone touched him. Would stand in front of the Dark Lord and face the blaze of the Killing Curse before they hurt him.</p><p>“I don't know,” he said.</p><p><em>I know</em>, he thought, <em>I'd know him anywhere. </em></p><p>
  <em>I love you. </em>
</p><p>Amongst the chaos he was grateful nobody saw his wand pointed at Aunt Bella, that nobody saw his hands loosen around the wands for Harry to grab, that he smiled despite the sting of where crystal had pulled sharply across his face. He smiled dark and bloody and smitten, full of utter relief that Harry Potter was <em>alive</em>.</p><p>Harry was always so alive, each of his movements shaped by it. When Draco cornered him in the Room a month later, true desperation slipped into his voice as he begged for Crabbe not to kill him. Harry was so, so alive, and he couldn't die. Draco had convinced Crabbe and Goyle that he was fine with turning Harry over to the Dark Lord, that he'd gotten over him <em>months</em> ago, that it was all <em>fine, </em>but it <em>wasn't</em>. Harry couldn't die and neither could <em>Draco</em>, surrounded by hot flames and rising smoke. Of <em>course</em> this was how he would die, burning up with it all, the conflict and yearning and fear. It was thick in his lungs and air seemed to escape him, and Draco knew he was dying. This was it: Harry Potter freewheeling above him, and Draco scorched on the ground. Draco didn't deserve life, not after all he'd done. It was no surprise that this war was the end of him. He'd chosen the wrong side and now he was paying the price.</p><p>Harry didn't care.</p><p>Harry was kind and selfless and the most wonderful person Draco had ever known, and he didn't care that Draco was nothing.</p><p>Draco had bullied him for seven years, had hurled insults and slurs his way, put him and his friends in great danger. He'd been so foul to him. And yet, always good, Harry was saving him. Pulling Draco up behind him and soaring above the destruction and the ashes. How funny that what he had always wanted- to be this close to Harry- came at such a time. That it came while Vince burned below them, while the place that had helped him become the person he was today was fiercely attacked by his own parents, while tears and soot plastered his face.</p><p>“Where's Ginny?” were the first words falling from Harry's mouth once they'd escaped, panting on the floor, and Draco was more than used to the dull pang of jealousy he felt at that name, though he was surprised it was still as persistent during such an awful battle. The fight was raging on around them, roaring like the Fiendfyre that had stolen his friend, and the whole thing was drawing in. There would be an end in sight, soon.</p><p>Harry would win. Harry had to win.</p><p>Amidst the throng and the shouts and the death, Draco attempted desperately to stay alive. Threw all the curses and jinxes he knew from his mother's wand, pledged false allegiance to an organisation that had caused him nothing but misery. He and his mother, they could escape this unscathed, if they were lucky. Life could return to normal and he could pine for stupid Harry Potter from afar as usual, he could spend days on end with Pansy and Blaise in a world that wasn't overrun by such sickness and prejudice. His rage toward Pansy for suggesting that they hand Potter over was significant, especially since she knew the extent of Draco's love for him, but they could move past it. He could forgive, but only if this <em>ended</em>.</p><p>Only if the Dark Lord perished.</p><p>If only.</p><p>Lifeless and limp, Harry Potter finally returned to Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco's agony was soundless as the body was presented to the crowd, so immense that it couldn’t even spill from his mouth, churning inside him with excruciating intensity. Instead, silent weeping racked his body, sending his hands trembling as he gazed at the broken shell of the boy he used to love. Harry, brave Harry, who did nothing but fight for what he believed in. His story had seemed fated to end in tragedy, right from the beginning, from a simple accident of birth. How Draco had loved him. <em>S</em><em>till</em> loved him, even as a mere corpse in Hagrid's arms, empty.</p><p>“He beat you!” cried Ron Weasley, expression shaped in furious, righteous sorrow, and Draco felt such a violent rush of affection for him that the pain nearly stopped. Nearly. He had been so harsh on them, Harry's friends. But they knew him, far better than Draco did. They loved him. He was <em>theirs</em>.</p><p>Even bloody Neville Longbottom, with his defiant denial of the Dark Lord, sent Draco inflating with respect. <em>When hell freezes over</em>. Draco saw it now, why these were the friends Harry chose. They were all like him: so ridiculously Gryffindor, so dutiful and steadfast to the cause. Even those that weren't from his House, they stood tall against the power of the Dark Lord just as their friends did. They loved Harry, but it was about <em>more</em> than him. Some had died- it wasn't for one person. It was about what was <em>right</em>, something Harry had believed in so much it had killed him. What a beautiful fool. Harry, Harry, Harry. His Harry. Draco should've taken the final blast of green for him, should've sunk to his feet before the Dark Lord and pleaded, implored him to spare an innocent who was nothing but a boy, who was <em>Draco's</em> boy, his great love.</p><p>How would he ever go on?</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>The name tore from his throat in a rush of joy and relief. Harry was here and he was real, circling the Dark Lord like he was nothing but prey. Love leapt in Draco like a great Gryffindor lion, daring and endless and true. If Draco hadn't known him, he would've thought he was magic incarnate. But no- he was nothing but human. Fearful and flawed, but brave. Harry asked Voldemort to find some remorse, <em>any</em> remorse, and Draco bit back more tears, awestruck at the depth of his goodness, even on the brink of potential death. Harry saying Draco's name so carelessly made his heart squeeze in his chest, made him remember how truly and fully devoted he was, so much so that he didn't care he'd had the power of great wizards at his hands for almost a year. It wasn't a waste. Not when Harry had it now, and was about to use it to change the world.</p><p>The Boy Who Lived.</p><p>He really, really was.</p>
