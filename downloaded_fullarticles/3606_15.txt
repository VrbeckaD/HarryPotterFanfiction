<p><b>There was nothing left of the money except</b> the small amount he'd needed to get out of the Mansion and into a flat in Muggle London. It had taken Draco four years but he'd made a life for himself that wasn't connected to his family name and the fortune it had come with after both his parents had died. His father had soon given up in Azkaban and nobody could be sure if it was a natural heart-attack or if something or someone had helped Lucion along to the other side faster.</p>
<p>His mother had followed a two years later, never really recovering from the shame and grief. Cause Draco was sure his mother had grieved, over his father, their lives, all the blood on their hands. Afterward, there had been no reason to stay. His house hadn't felt like a home in a long time and with the passing of his mother the last warmth had fled the mansion, making Draco feel miserable and completely alone. No money in the world could replace it and he'd donated what was left of the family fortune to local charities that cared for the victims of the war. Of course anonymously, after the trial he'd kept a very low profile and even the flat he lived in now was not on his real name. Not that Muggles knew anything about him but there were other wizards that preferred living here after the war and Draco didn't need the hate owls and sneak attacks here too.</p>
<p>He'd gone on with his life, not really sure what to do now but he'd found a job at a pet store and soon figured out he wasn't bad in dealing with animals. One thing let to the other and then a lucky encounter had changed his life forever. Who would have thought Harry Potter himself would walk into Draco's life and change it for the better?</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? How did you find me?”</p>
<p>“Word went around. Apparently, you're the number one person to go to when their pets are in trouble. Wasn't too hard to track you down, even if you don't use magic anymore.” Harry had given him a strange look and Draco noticed the lines around his mouth and the small scar near his right eye.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I need help with an animal situation and I came to give you this back.” Harry had held out Draco's old wand and just seeing it had made his stomach do a flip.</p>
<p>“It's yours. You should have it.”</p>
<p>Harry's voice had been apologetic, eyes closely taking in Draco's reaction and he'd needed another second or two to get himself together and take the wand in his hands. Instantly he felt like a missing piece was slotted into place, body going warm and he stumbled out a word of thanks. His hands were shaking and of course, Potter had noticed, eyes staying on Draco's left wrist.</p>
<p>There wasn't anything to see, he always made sure he was wearing long sleeves and a patch to cover his mark but he couldn't stop the flinch as Potter reached out a hand, stopping mid* movement before pulling it back.</p>
<p>“Is it true you-” Harry had stopped, looking over Draco's shoulder before meeting his gaze and Draco had held his breath, dread settling inside him as the unspoken words screamed in the air.</p>
<p>
  <em>You tried to cut it out and almost killed yourself?</em>
</p>
<p>That had been a month after the trial when his father was still screaming murder over the unfairness of his life and him and his mother were just trying to hold on long enough to survive the day. It seemed every wizard in the world had things to say about them and none of the letters were good. After a while they just burned them the moment they came in, not even bothering to open them. It had taken a toll on his mother, wathcing her get smaller every day. It had broken his heart but he couldn't help her. Just looking at him reminded his mother of all that had happend, all they'd lost and after a while the idea settled into his mind that the world would be better of without him.</p>
<p>The mark was a representation of everything he hated about himself, everything he'd done wrong and the blood that was on his hands from all his foolish mistakes. He didn't plan to kill himself, not really. He just wanted the mark gone, maybe have a chance to start again where nobody knew who he was and what he'd done.</p>
<p>His mother had found him just in time and he hated her for a long time after it.</p>
<p>“<em>You should have just let me die.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Never. You are the only good thing I'v ever done Draco. I will never, </em>never<em>, be ashamed of you.”</em></p>
<p>They'd both cried that day, Draco clinging to his mother as if he was a little child again and things had been better after that. That's why his mother's passing had been such a shock. She'd seemed happy and alive for the first time in forever but the universe could be cruel, taking people away for no reason. Just bad luck.</p>
<p>“Hermione thinks she has found a way to remove it. I could get you into contact with her if, if that's something you would like.” Draco had snapped out of his thoughts by Harry's words. The man was looking into Draco's eyes and Draco had pocketed his wand, resisting the urge to scratch his mark. Trying to cut it out hadn't helped at all, it was still there, now accompanied with the scars of the knife he'd used.</p>
<p>“Why would she help me? Why would you? And why would you need my help with an animal related problem? The animals I work with are not magical.”</p>
<p>“That's not what I've heard.” Harry gave the beginning of a smile as Draco felt his face get warmer. He fiddled with the hem of his shirt, trying to ignore Harry's triumphant look.</p>
<p>“That was a one time thing.” Draco shrugged a shoulder as Harry lifted an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Cut the crap, Draco. I know you're Arham Ekras. The famed Magizoologist that stopped the Nundus attack without killing the animals? The one that banned the Billywigs drugs production?”</p>
<p>“I.” Draco hadn't been able to speak as Harry listed of all the things he'd done under a fake name. These days he couldn't recall how it all had begun but somehow he'd made a name for himself as a Magizoologist. He still worked with non magical animals mostly, but from time to time a special job would come in and he'd be gone for days or weeks. He still didn't trust the Minastry 100%, but he did trust Luna and they both had the same interests and love for animals. Though it had taken Draco years to find his passion and make a living of it.</p>
<p>“I'm not an idiot, Draco. And no,” Harry had shaken his head, holding up his hands, “Luna didn't tell me anything. I just pieced it together. Took me 6 months to be sure and now-”</p>
<p>“Now you're here.”</p>
<p>Harry had nodded and Draco had turned to sit down on a kitchen chair, hearing the man follow him. He gestured for the man to sit down when Harry didn't move and suddenly the absurdity of the situation became clear to Draco. <em>Who'd have thought I'd sit down with Harry Potter after all these years and we'd be civil?</em></p>
<p>Potter had testified on his trial, something Draco hadn't understood for a long time. He'd causes so much sorry and pain. He'd made Harry's life hell whenever he saw an oppertunity and still the man had stood in front of the whole Wizamogant and asked for kindness. His mother had sent a letter some time after, thanking Harry for what he'd done. She'd gotten one back and Draco had never dared to ask what was in it.</p>
<p>“There have been some owl attacks attacks lately. Mostly in wizard London but there have been reports of incidents here too. Have you heard anything about this?”</p>
<p>“No.” Draco frowned, removing an imaginary speck of dust from the kitchentable. “ But it's not the first time wizards have caught owls. I don't see why that's-”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry stopped him, face serious and Draco felt his heart skip a beat as those green eyes focused on him intensly. “It's not wizards attacking owls. It's the other way around.”</p>
<p>“That's not possible.” Draco shook his head. Owls didn't start confrontations, by the first sign of trouble they flew away. He was about to say as much when Harry pulled out his wand and before Draco could even tense up, an image came to life of a lonely sidestreet in Diagon Alley in the early evening. A man was walking away from them slowly,carrying a bag in one hand. Then, out of nowhere, a group of at least 15 owls appeared and attacked the man. Draco's mouth fell open as the man tried to fight them out, bag already forgotten on the ground as the birds came after him again and again. Draco couldn't hear the screams but the images were enough to know that the man was terrified, trying to get up and run, always being pushed back down by the angry birds. It footage ended with the man lying on the pavement, grocery bag not far from him, his clothes ripped to pieces, blood spatters and feathers everywhere.</p>
<p>“This was from three days ago. The Ministry is trying to keep it quite for now but more reports have come in. This isn't normal owl behavior, Draco. You probably know that better then me.” Harry pocketed his wand and Draco nodded slowly, still in shock by what he'd seen. There was nothing normal about that.</p>
<p>“We need your help. I need your help. Before panick starts to kick in and people take matters into their own hands. For now it's only the Tawny owl that seems to be effected. I don't want to wait around till it spreads to the other species.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Draco blinked, the image of the man trying to fight off the owls still on his mind. He'd never seen anything like this, whatever it was it wasn't normal and Draco could only imagine what people would do if things got out of hand even more.</p>
<p>“Okay, I'll help you. What's your plan?” He noticed the flash of surprise on Harry's face before the man gave a smile, standing up and offering Draco his hand. Draco took it after a second of hesitation, his brain regestiring that Harry's hand was warm but rough, a clear sign the man wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty.</p>
<p>He swallowed, face warming up as flashes of him and a naked Harry came to mind and his heart skipped a beat when he turned his head and Harry smiled at him, a glimmer in his green eyes. He felt a light squeeze on his hand before Harry spoke, excitement clear in his voice.</p>
<p>“I'm glad you asked. Ready for a new adventure, Arham Ekras?”</p>
