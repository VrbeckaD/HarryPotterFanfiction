    <p>If someone were to ask him about the last three months of his life, Harry Potter would have absolutely nothing to say.</p><p>Truthfully, he wasn’t even sure what had happened. It was all a blur to him. Sounds, colors, shapes, blankness, exhaustion, tears, and the occasional warm summer breeze. Speaking as a witness in the trials of different Death Eaters, going to funerals, helping Ron and Hermione move into their own place, looking for a place of his own, and taking care of the Weasley household while they mourned the loss of Fred. If he wasn’t busy, he mostly sat around, staring at nothing in particular for long periods of time. He did take his time to mourn: he cried, he got angry, he wished he had done better, he wished he had died in the forest, he wished he had never been born, but most of all, he took his time to heal. The entire household did.</p><p>It was hard and it hurt like hell, but after the summer had come and gone, things weren’t as bad as before. The people of that home showed their open wounds to each other.</p><p>They cried together, talked, and there was no judgement or hate, only openness and forgiveness. They all wanted to heal and they did it together.</p><p>September came and Ron entered a training program to become an Auror, Hermione took up an internship at the Ministry, Ginny went back to Hogwarts, and everyone else returned to their lives before the war. Everyone except Harry. Harry realized he was the only one whose life centered almost completely around the war. He was born to die in it, and without that, he wasn't sure what he was meant to do with himself. So he stuck around a while longer. Although he was halfway moved in to his own house, he stayed for Molly. Sometimes, she just couldn’t cook or clean, and without saying a word, Harry would silently get it done for her. He was used to doing so much more, and he felt like he owed her for all the kindness the Weasleys had shown him. Though it sometimes took them by surprise, no one said a word when Harry was the one serving dinner, or when they walked in to see him cleaning. Just silent nods and an unspoken gratitude. Harry preferred it that way.</p><p>When the Death Eater trials finished and the dead were buried, Harry spent most of his time at the Burrow. If he wasn't helping Molly keep the house, he was sitting outside, just breathing and feeling the warm sun. He was so tired that sometimes the warmth of the sun was all he could feel anymore, the only thing reminding him that he was alive. The outside became his own little bubble away from the world, a place where he could be alive. He decided he liked the warmth of the sun, he liked the slow-moving clouds in the sky, he liked the plants, the songs of the birds, the rustle of trees, he liked the air, he felt like he could finally breathe. It was nice.</p><p>His only anxiety left in life became The Quibbler. The newspaper was doing some sort of huge exposé on the Death Eater trials; listing every trial, all the charges, and their outcomes all in one mass article. Molly had made the decision that one Saturday, they should all get together and read it. She thought it would be good for them to all be together, to hear the crimes, and to know the bad guys were getting justice. To know it was finally over.</p><p>It took very little convincing for McGonagall to let Ginny return to her home one Saturday afternoon to be with her family.</p><p>They all crowded into the little sitting room while Arthur slowly read out the entire list. “Bellatrix Lestrange, née Black, currently deceased, on the charges of multiple counts of murder, torture, the use of unforgivable curses, and being a Death Eater. Verdict, guilty. Punishment has been forgone due to the accused being deceased. Titles and properties to be dissolved by Gringotts Bank.” Somehow, that got the entire room to feel at ease for the first time in forever. Molly even let a small smile slip.</p><p>“Titles and properties to be dissolved by Gringotts Bank.” preceded the trial of everyone with a Dark Mark. It was strange to hear it at the end of trials where the accused had children who hadn’t taken the Dark Mark, and therefore, should be given their parent's belongings. Although nobody questioned it, the occasional confused expression revealed that everyone in the room was curious about it.</p><p>After the trials were read out, Arthur skimmed a bit before finding something else of interest, “Ah, since the start of the Death Eater trials, Gringotts Bank has been incapable of bequeathing the titles and properties of Death Eaters onto the next of kin. This is due to the newly revealed nature of vows taken by followers of Voldemort. Said vows were based off of the ancient Oaths of Fealty, which have been unused for centuries. Originally, the aforesaid oaths were made between a vassal and lord, in which the lord would give the vassal property in exchange for loyalty. This modified version, sealed with the Dark Mark, swore loyalty to Voldemort with titles and property as collatera-” Arthur cut himself off, staring at the newspaper in disbelief. He silently read ahead for a few seconds before backtracking to catch the rest of the room up.</p><p>“Right, it says the oaths pledge loyalty, with the titles and properties of the entire House, as collateral. That even includes individual vaults at Gringotts, all surrendered to Voldemort. Does that ..... does that make sense to everyone?” He glanced around the room to see small nods. “Well it seems that, uhm, with the loss of the war the oaths were considered broken; twenty-two families have lost everything. It’s caused a problem in Wizengamot as much of their peerage were Death Eaters, or related to Death Eaters. They’ve been operating with a vast majority of their members temporarily replaced, since titles apparently included their place in Wizengamot.” Arthur actually managed a laugh at that. It was quite a ridiculous situation.</p><p>Arthur read ahead once again, this time with a satisfied smile on his face. “So the goblins've been looking through the old laws to try to figure out what to do with the titles and property, since Voldemort is dead and heirless. Ah, the article brings up how the oaths and laws used by Voldemort are incredibly outdated and haven’t been used in centuries. It mentions that Minister Shacklebolt plans to revisit the old laws and have them dissolved so this can’t happen again.” He read ahead some more, intending to summarize the next section of the article, until he read something that made him go pale.</p><p>His expression snapped into that of shock as he reread the same few lines over and over, trying to process it.</p><p>The room was filled with a dreadful curiosity.</p><p>“Apparently,” he began quite awkwardly, “with the use of such old property laws, the goblins of Gringotts have looked into old legislation for a legal solution, and have decided that the only legal answer is the implementation of the right of conquest.”</p><p>There was a mixed reaction. Everyone looked as shocked as Arthur; besides George, Ron, and Harry; who had no clue what “right of conquest” meant. Although Harry was developing a sense of dread about it, as most eyes in the room went to him, giving looks of sympathy and sorrow.</p><p>“And what does that mean?” Harry's tone wasn’t curious in the slightest. It was stale and tired. This was nothing more to him than yet another mess he had to deal with.</p><p>Molly spoke up and explained it as simply as she could, “It’s an old practice. It, along with those oaths, were long forgotten about as both fell out of fashion. They’re both leftovers from centuries ago. Stolen from Muggle society, really.” It was obvious that she was making a small attempt at delaying the inevitable. Sparing Harry just a few more seconds of peace before she had to tell him the truth. “It’s the right to take property by force of arms.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes slowly widened as he realized what that meant. “So all the stuff that Voldemort got from his Death Eaters ..... I now own? Because I killed him?”</p><p>Molly nodded sadly. “I’m sorry, Harry. I suppose you’ll be getting a letter about it soon.”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and no one said anything else. They let him have a moment to process it before Arthur finished up the article.</p><p>Twenty-two.</p><p>Harry owned the titles, properties, and vaults of twenty-two Wizarding families.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the less he was surprised that the focus of the goblins was to find someone to inherit all of Voldemort’s stuff. It’s what they did. Passing on wealth to the next in line was one of their main jobs. It was a lot to deal with, anyways. He couldn’t blame them for wanting to get rid of it.</p><p>Rather than considering the gravity of the situation, Harry decided that once it was over, he would finish moving into his house and take some time to relax. After all he’d been through, he figured he deserved as much.</p><p>When a letter from Gringotts arrived the next day he was ecstatic, but upon arriving at the bank, it was an entirely different story. The last time he was there, he and his friends impersonated Bellatrix Lestrange, broke into her vault, and stole a dragon. Sure, it may have been a necessary evil, but that didn’t stop him from being incredibly tense and overly-polite from the moment he stepped inside.</p><p>He was escorted down a hallway filled with little offices, and taken into a room where an older goblin was waiting on him. The plaque at the door introduced him as Mr. Demgass.</p><p>This was a goblin that Harry had never met before, yet he was already overcome by the urge to apologize for stealing the dragon. Now that his adrenaline-fueled war confidence had passed, he was back to the tired and anxious boy that the Dursleys had turned him into. Thankfully, the Weasleys dismantle much of the damage done by the Dursleys, and he wasn't nearly as quiet as he once was.</p><p>Mr. Demgass wasted no time in getting to the nitty-gritty. “Mr. Potter, I must say, I’m quite impressed with you stealing a dragon. That was the most interesting thing to happen in my near-century of working here. Now, on to your problem, if you want to call it that.” The goblin pulled out a large file and it slammed onto his desk. Many of the papers inside looked ancient and worn. Much of the writing was faded and the pages were laid instead of woven. It had to be older than the 1700s at least. “You are now the head of twenty-two houses, but given the grim look you walked in with, I assume you didn’t come to celebrate.”</p><p>Demgass was unlike any goblin Harry had ever met, except for Professor Flitwick, who was only half-goblin.</p><p>“I was hoping to find a way to relinquish my new titles and properties back to their original owners.” Harry decided being straightforward about his intentions would be best, even though he didn't know much about the situation at hand or the old laws.</p><p>Demgass tilted his head. “You must see how that gets difficult given that many are deceased or imprisoned. Really, you have a few problems on your hands. Of the twenty-two houses you now head, eight are dissolved. By that, I mean that there are no living or non-imprisoned heirs to those houses. There is no one you can give those titles or properties to. You do have the option of selling the properties and taking those profits, along with whatever they had in their vaults, and either keeping the money or giving it to charity. As for the titles, you have the unique power of filling much of Wizengamot with those you see fit.”</p><p>“How could that be possible? I can’t give away jobs. How do I own jobs?” Harry really didn’t understand that part.</p><p>“Wizard society has an unspoken nobility. It is no secret that being pureblood has, or perhaps, <i>had</i> its perks. Long ago, the Council of Wizards was a peerage, meaning it's members held lifetime and hereditary titles, which kept it entirely pureblood. When wizard society became what it is today, Wizengamot remained suspiciously unchanged. It’s mostly pureblood and their positions in Wizengamot are unofficially hereditary. One ages out, and their children and grandchildren rise to take their place. Given the unofficial nature of the system, there is no one qualified to permanently replace the empty seats. Everyone in line for a spot in Wizengamot is either dead or in Azkaban. So, either you run Wizengamot, or, you hand over the positions to those you deem competent enough to do the job.”</p><p>Harry’s first choices were members of the Order and DA. But, he was also willing to take a chance on a few of the children of Death Eaters. An unsurprisingly low number of his Slytherin peers ever took the Dark Mark. Really, it was just Draco and a few of his friends. Beyond that, almost no young people ever became a Death Eaters. He kept his mental list while the goblin continued.</p><p>“Now, beyond houses without heirs, the House of Crouch is in a unique position.” Demgass began flipping through his folder, searching for something specific. “Crouch Jr. took the Dark Mark and relinquished his inheritance, Crouch Sr. never took the Dark Mark and has no other heir, therefore, you’re the heir to the House of Crouch, but not yet the head. You would have to discuss this with Crouch Sr. so he can find another heir, or, if it’s in his best interest, allow you to remain the heir to his house.” He finally found the page he wanted and skimmed towards the bottom. “As it stands, your status as head of twenty-one houses, and heir of the House of Crouch, will be finalized in roughly half an hour.” He looked up at Harry, an inept excitement rested in his eyes, “You’re about to become the richest wizard in history. Though already wealthy, the House of Potter is to become an incredibly prosperous one.”</p><p>In the half-hour wait, Harry and Demgass went through the eight dissolved houses. He very smugly made the decision to liquidate everything once belonging to Peter Pettigrew and the House of Lestrange, with the profits going to benefit those afflicted with lycanthropy. The profits of four of the remaining houses were to be donated to help families affected by the war: orphans, widows, houses, and businesses. The profits of the final two would be donated to help repair Hogwarts. He wanted to help undo as much of the damage as he could. He felt responsible since he was the one who didn't die when he should have.</p><p>An owl was sent out when they finished with the list of properties meant to be sold and the profits donated accordingly.</p><p>“Now that we have that taken care of, there is something you must understand.” For the first time, an air of seriousness took over Demgass. “Goblins, especially those younger ones, have pride about themselves and this bank. They take pride in their jobs and in the system they’ve created. I know that after everything that’s happened you would like to build a good relationship with the goblins of Gringotts, yes?”</p><p>Harry quickly nodded, growing nervous about where the conversation was headed.</p><p>“Then trust me when I tell you that it would be considered unethical and rude for you to return all the properties. The goblins will see it as you going back on everything they’ve created and as nobody having gained anything. All they’ll see is a backwards transaction, and they’ll take it personally. You can easily relinquish the personal vaults you’ve gained, but keep just a few properties. The affected families are pureblood, they know how this works and they’ll understand. Really, they got themselves into this mess. They shouldn’t expect you to fix it all for them, but here you are. You deserve a few nice things anyways.” The goblin tempted.</p><p>Harry was visibly uncomfortable from the information he received. But he understood. “Alright. I’ll keep a few things. A few small things.”</p><p>Four hours later he rid himself of everything once belonging to House of Black, besides some furniture and everything that belonged to Sirius. The House of Crabbe lost a boat that they were planning on selling anyways, the House of Rosier lost many books, and the House of Yaxley lost some artwork. The other Houses lost nothing. He was very obviously targeting the more prominent Death Eater families.</p><p>As for the House of Malfoy, Harry had a hard time deciding on what to do with them. Part of him wanted to leave them alone and have no more dealings with them, but by the same token, he wanted to fuck them over. He could take the roof over their heads or the clothes off their backs. He could take everything and leave them with nothing but an empty home. Instead, he settled for a few pieces of furniture. It wasn’t even furniture from the Manor, but some items from other properties that the Malfoy family owned. Harry did, however, decide to take a good portion of the wine cellar, knowing how important it was to Lucius.</p><p>He was quite cross with the entire situation surrounding Lucius Malfoy. The man had given up the names of so many Death Eaters, that all charges against him were dropped since he helped Wizengamot and the Aurors bring the last of Voldemort’s followers to justice. Of course Harry understood the importance of bringing the others to justice, but he hated that Lucius got off without penalty. So yes, Harry, who doesn’t even drink, kept some good wine, just to be an arse.</p><p>Harry was quite pleased with how everything turned out. He sold almost everything that he chose to keep, got Sirius’ property in his safekeeping, and he took some wine.</p><p>As for the situation with the House of Crouch, Bartimus Crouch Sr., who was now a very weary man, told Harry that the House of Crouch might be better off in his hands. He decided that if he was so terrible that his child would be a Death Eater, and he would be manipulated by Voldemort, then perhaps it was time for his House to come to an end. Harry was in line to inherit hundreds of thousands.</p><p>Along with the imprisonments, many Death Eater families were hit with hefty fines to make reparations for what was destroyed in the war. Funnily enough, after Harry returned everything, most Houses ended up selling a good portion of their properties to take care of the fines thrown their way. It shook the finances of Wizarding society, and although Harry relinquished almost everything he had gained, the House of Potter was easily one of the richest wizarding families by the end of it all. Harry found amusement in this.</p><p>Harry moved into his house in Hogsmeade and began wondering what he was meant to do with his life. Should he date and find someone to marry, was he to get a job or live off his wealth like his father? Harry liked the idea of working, but he didn’t know where to start. He didn’t want to work in the Ministry, that was certain, but he still wanted to make a difference.</p><p>That’s when he remembered all the spots in Wizengamot he owned. Perhaps that would be a good place to start, especially now that the Death Eater trials were over and Minister Shacklebolt was beginning his plans to reform the Ministry. Given that Wizengamot acts as a judicial and legislative branch, Harry knew Shacklebolt could use all the support he could get there.</p><p>He pulled out some parchment and a quill, making a list of all the people who should have a voice in the Ministry. Starting with a few members of the Order, graduated members of the DA, a few persons afflicted with Lycanthropy, and other great witches and wizards he knew. By the end of it he had nearly half of the missing spaces filled. He began writing letter after letter, explaining the situation and asking everyone on his list if they would be interested in a position in Wizengamots.</p><p>After the responses came flooding in, Harry sent off two final letters; one to Gringotts, settling half his titles; and one to Minister Shacklebolt, sending his list of the newest members of Wizengamot.</p><p>Harry was done fighting. He had given everything, even his own life, to the war. Now, he wanted to repair things. He wanted to see things get better. He wanted simplicity. Amidst his writing, he came to realize that this was his second chance at life.</p>
