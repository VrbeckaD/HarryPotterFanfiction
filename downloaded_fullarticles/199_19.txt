    <u>NOTICE/DISCLAIMER</u>

<p>In light of some things I have seen happening in some stories that I enjoy reading, I've decided to post this message to my readers in all my stories (except one-shots).</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost,</strong> I would like to state that—in case this is news to some of you—I am but a simple human being. I make mistakes, and I sometimes miss things when I am writing out my stories for you all. That being said, if you happen to be reading my stories and notice something that you either don't think is right or that I should have cited, please, by all means, let me know. I promise that I will do my best to fix the problem. The last thing I want to do is plagiarize something, and I will do everything in my power to not do so in the first place. But, I do accept criticism and expect you guys to tell me when I miss something. Do me a favor, though: let it go after that.</p>
<p><strong>Which brings me to my next point</strong>: I want it known that I do not tolerate bullying, abuse, and harassment in any way, shape, or form. If I see it on other stories, I will do my best to stand up for the author in question. I will be that much more fierce when it comes to defending my own stories. If that means reporting or blocking someone (commenter or the comment itself), I will. It is well within my (as well as your) rights to do so. </p>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong> expressing your opinion on a story is fine and dandy. Tell me what you think. I don't care. Okay, I do care, but most of you will get my point. However, when you start jumping stories and blowing up my email with rude and senseless comments, that's where I draw the line.</p>
<p>It's why I stated above to let it go. Most of us author's here and on other websites are writing for our enjoyment, as well as our faithful readers. This is merely a hobby, and we enjoy doing it. Please do not take away our enjoyment by being nitpickers and bullies.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, I want to state, as loudly as I can in writing, that this is a FANFICTION SITE!!! Sometimes, I will need to take some dialogue from the movies, books, etc., that I am writing about. As I stated above, I will do my best to cite my sources and make sure nothing is plagiarized, but know that there may be times that I miss something. Please don't nitpick those few times that I make a human error and just enjoy my stories.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>, please have fellow author's backs. It's one thing to stand up for yourself against someone, but when I see others doing the same, it warms my heart. We are a community here, and the only way we can all enjoy it is if we all have each other's backs. I trust that you all, as my readers, would stand up for me. If I've read your stories, then, chances are, I will stand up for you too!</p>
<p>Whether you are a long-term reader or a brand new reader, please know that I do appreciate you reading my story. I don't want to discourage you from continuing to read my stories or other author's stories, but I also don't want anyone to think that they can harass me about something and get away with it. If anyone has any questions regarding this, please PM me. I'm more than willing to answer your questions or even your concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you all for everything!!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jamie W.</p>
<p>P.S.—This mainly pertains to FF.N, but I figured I would post this on all my stories on all websites that I'm on. I do not own anything you recognize. It all belongs to the proper creator; all that I do own is the original character that I created and some deviations to the original plot. If there are any questions or concerns about this, please PM me!</p>
