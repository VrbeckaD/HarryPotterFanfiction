          <div class="userstuff"><p align="left">“Lucius, I was thinking we could have the Parkinsons over soon. We haven’t had them over for dinner in several months,” Narcissa said to her husband at dinner.</p>
<p align="left">Harry didn’t really pay any attention. He had been staying at Malfoy Manor for a week now and he was thoroughly enjoying teasing Draco. At that moment he was staring at Draco while doing nearly indecent things to his food with his tongue.</p>
<p align="left">“Cissy, Draco’s gay,” Lucius said to his wife.</p>
<p align="left">Harry smirked when Draco started choking on his wine. Lucius just continued to calmly enjoy his meal.</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa frowned at her husband. “Well, yes. I’ve known that for years, Lucius.”</p>
<p align="left">“I contacted the Parkinsons and dissolved the marriage contract between Draco and Pansy,” Lucius said.</p>
<p align="left">“You did?” Draco gasped.</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa frowned even more fiercely. Before she could say anything, Lucius continued.</p>
<p align="left">“I decided on a more appropriate spouse for our son. It works out quite well that Draco is gay.”</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa’s frown eased. “Still, Lucius. I want to start making plans. I want to see Draco married soon. Who have you chosen?”</p>
<p align="left">Draco paled at the turn the conversation had taken. <em>Oh god! I’m finally rid of Pansy, my father knows I’m gay and seems </em><em><strong>happy</strong></em><em> about it and now I’m going to be married off to some strange man. And Potter is still hanging around. What next?!</em></p>
<p align="left">“Harry. I think they will be well suited, don’t you?” Lucius said calmly.</p>
<p align="left">“Oh,” Narcissa said, pleased. “How wonderful! Welcome to the family, Harry!”</p>
<p align="left">“Thank you, Narcissa,” Harry said, smirking at the stunned Draco Malfoy sitting across from him.</p>
<p align="left">When Draco felt Potter’s foot slowly trail up his calf and then start up his thigh, he gave an undignified squeak and bolted from the table.</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa gasped and started to get up from the table.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s alright,” Harry said, giving her a small smile. “I’ll go talk to him.”</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa gave him a pleased smile and Harry rose and left the room. As he stepped into the hallway, Harry wore a predatory smile. Now that they were formally engaged, Harry was ready to move beyond the light teasing and flirting he had been doing.</p>
<p align="left">Upstairs, Draco reached his room and slammed the door shut behind him. He locked the door and then add a few spells for good measure. Draco moved to the center of the room and just stood there for a minute, trying to wrap his brain around what had just happened.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m engaged to <em>Harry Potter!</em>” Draco said out loud in horror.</p></div>
