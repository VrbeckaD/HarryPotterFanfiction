      <p align="center"><em>Can </em><em><strong>YOU</strong></em> <em>help the Boy Who Lived?<br/></em><em>By Rita Skeeter</em></p>
      <p><em>The Chosen One</em>, <em>The Man Who Vanquished</em>, <em>The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter is in need, my friends. Can you help?</em></p>
      <p>Exclusive information—it's our understanding that not even their families and closest friends are yet aware—brought to the attention of <em><strong>Yours Truly</strong></em> has just revealed that Mr Potter and his husband of almost four years, Draco Malfoy, are ready to start a family.</p>
      <p>That's right, loyal readers, some lucky child will get Harry Potter as a father! How do they plan on obtaining this child, you may ask?</p>
      <p>This is as yet unclear, but my diligent research (I interviewed my brilliant cousin Benny, who is indeed also homosexual) has made clear that our dear Misters Potter and Malfoy have a couple of options to explore. They may go the traditional route and adopt, of course, then perform a blood adoption ceremony adding their familial magics and bloodline to the lucky child. This was the only method for same-sex parents for centuries, but my source tells me they can now have another, previously unavailable, option.</p>
      <p>You'll likely be surprised to learn, <em>dear readers</em>, that the Muggles have developed the means of allowing a woman to carry another person's baby! It's true! I verified this information myself! In this method, a gracious, miraculously selfless woman volunteers to carry a child for another couple. The source of the egg is a donation from either that woman or another. Yes, good wizards and witches, Muggles even have the ability to transplant a woman's egg into another woman! The process allows them to fertilize the egg during the process with donated <em>material</em> from any selected man, who would, in this case, be one of our married wizards!</p>
      <p>Do you know of a child who needs a family? Are you willing to carry a child for The Chosen One? Would you like knowing that an egg of your bloodline is becoming a child of The Boy Who Lived?</p>
      <p>It's as yet unknown how the couple will go about choosing their path. However, if you'd like to be considered, please write to us here at the Daily Prophet and explain how you'd like to help, and why they should pick you. Unfortunately, Mr Potter has a block on all owls of unknown origin for his privacy, but we will be pleased to supply this information to the couple for consideration as they begin their journey into parenthood.</p>
      <p>We'd like to wish the happy couple, on behalf of all of our staff and our beloved readers, congratulations and best wishes on this new adventure they are embarking upon!</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Harry entered the Ministry on an early Tuesday morning in May and looked around, sighed, then headed for the lifts. He'd been gone eight months and nothing appeared to have changed in his time away. Seven months and thirteen days he'd been away on his mission for the ICW, and he'd since spent two weeks at home with Draco for some well deserved time of relaxation. Not that they'd relaxed much, he smirked. But the time alone, together, had been very much appreciated.</p>
      <p>In that time, when not <em>getting reacquainted</em>, as Draco put it, they'd managed to get a few things done. They'd bought a house, visited Teddy and watched the Hufflepuff-Gryffindor Quidditch game in which Teddy played Beater, had dinner with family, and most importantly, they'd planned their future. They still didn't know the specifics about everything, but it was an outline, a path to where they wanted to go.</p>
      <p>The first step had been the house purchase, which they'd yet to tell their families and friends about. They'd do that in the upcoming weekend when they made their other announcements as well.</p>
      <p>The second step was his current destination. He stepped onto the lift. "Level one." He ignored the mutters and whispers of the other occupants around him. He'd been suffering from that phenomenon almost his entire life, so it barely registered in his mind. He stared at the door and let his mind continue to wander, ignoring people entering and exiting around him.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching Kingsley's office, a man sitting at the desk quickly put aside his newspaper, looking embarrassed for some reason. "Auror Potter. It's good to see you home safe," he said with a polite smile. "The Minister is expecting you. You may go on in."</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Dale. It's good to see you, too. Are you well?"</p>
      <p>"Quite, thank you. His first meeting of the day is in twenty minutes, so if you need to schedule more time with him later, let me know after."</p>
      <p>"Absolutely." Harry grinned at the Personal Assistant's not-so-subtle hint to get moving and entered the office.</p>
      <p>"Harry! Come in; sit. We have twenty minutes, so let's go to it, shall we?"</p>
      <p>Harry laughed and took a seat. "Yes, so Dale informed me. Where should we start?"</p>
      <p>Kingsley sat back in his chair and met Harry's eye. "Well, I'll be completely honest with you. I had every intention of using this meeting to change your mind about declining the Head Auror position. As you know, we've been preparing both you and the Wizengamot for this change for several years. When I received your letter last week declining the position and outlining your new intentions and desires, I was both taken aback, and I'll admit to you now since we're friends, I was annoyed. Robards has already made plans to step down at the end of this year, so this leaves me barely over eight months to choose his replacement."</p>
      <p>Harry nodded. He knew all this, but he was resolute.</p>
      <p>"As I said, though," Kingsley continued. "I <em>had</em> every intention of attempting to change your mind, but I can see now that it would be a hopeless case, wouldn't it?"</p>
      <p>"Er— Yes, it would be. What persuaded you otherwise?"</p>
      <p>Kingsley raised his eyebrows in surprise at Harry's question. "Knowing your personal intentions, of course. It makes more sense now, and honestly is something that I agree with given those intentions."</p>
      <p>Harry was now completely lost. "My intentions? My intentions aren't personal, Kingsley. I told you that I wanted to go off active duty and join the Training Squad. I think I can do the most good there teaching new Aurors, and encouraging them not only to train and investigate, but to treat people with dignity and to approach every situation with empathy. I want to make a difference, and I think this is the best way I can do that."</p>
      <p>Kingsley shifted in his seat. "Of course. But you'd be able to do most of that as Head Auror, and you'd be able to make sure that policies and expectations were followed. But I understand better now since that would still pull you into the field for high priority missions. The Training Squad will only take you away for training weekends several times a year. That'll be important with a new baby."</p>
      <p>"Exactly." Harry started, then froze. "Wait, what? What do you mean, a new baby?" They had not said anything to anyone yet about their plans to start a family. He glanced at his long time friend and saw a sheepish look cross the Minister's face. He growled, trying to keep his anger from flaring until he knew the details. "Kingsley. Explain what you mean by that, please."</p>
      <p>"Yes, well. Hmm. I know one can't believe everything they read in the Daily Prophet, but given your request for an occupational change and the rumour I heard from a reliable source about your purchasing a new home last week, it seemed to fit."</p>
      <p>"The Prophet." Harry's ire was beginning to burn.</p>
      <p>"Uh, yes. The Prophet. I forgot you don't read it." Kingsley sighed. "There was an article in there this morning about your and Draco's intentions to start a family. Listen, we don't have much time, so let me say this. If it's true, I think it's wonderful and I'm looking forward to watching you become a father." Harry attempted to speak, but Kingsley simply raised a finger, stopping him. "Instead of planning ways to change your mind, I spent a few minutes this morning gathering the paperwork for your transfer, starting next month on your return. You'll be leading the Training Squad, and Hermione and I will work together to adjust other senior personnel to prepare for Robards retirement. That will give you and the other members of the Training Squad two months over the summer to make adjustments to the curriculum before the new recruits begin in August."</p>
      <p>Harry sighed. "I will neither confirm nor deny the Prophet, as I have yet to read it. I didn't even bloody know there was anything in there today. Kingsley, we haven't even discussed this with our families yet. We're doing that this weekend."</p>
      <p>Kingsley grinned. "I understand. Things like this get around fast. It's possible it was even just a lucky guess on behalf of the paper."</p>
      <p>"We haven't even decided how we're going to go about it. We just decided we wanted to. Bloody hell." He ran his hands through his hair, making Kingsley laugh.</p>
      <p>"Please let me know if there's anything I can do." Kingsley looked at the clock and sighed. "But for now, why don't you take these papers, read through them and sign where necessary, and send them back to me by owl by the end of business Friday. We'll want to arrange a press conference next week to make the announcement about the Training Squad, as there will definitely be public relations to deal with on this change. I'll have Dale send you the details when I know more." He handed Harry the papers, then stood to walk to the door. "I'm really happy for you, my friend. Children are a wonderful blessing, and I can't wait to see you embark on this journey."</p>
      <p>"Kings—"</p>
      <p>"Yes, yes," he interrupted. "<em>Allegedly </em>embark on this journey."</p>
      <p>Harry laughed, his anger finally dissipating a bit. "Thank you. Now, it appears my plans for the day have been rudely interrupted and I will likely have a line of people expecting explanations and offering advice waiting on me when I get home." He glanced around. "Do you have a copy of the Prophet I can read before I get there?"</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>"Uncle Draco, Uncle Harry? Is it true? Are you going to have a baby?"</p>
      <p>Draco looked at the teenager as he literally bounced out of the fireplace, blue hair hanging in his face, gangly arms and legs belying the strength he'd gain playing Quidditch. For all of his fifteen years, Teddy was still proficient at behaving like a small child when he was excited, Draco mused.</p>
      <p>Harry and Draco paused their lunch discussion at the kitchen table, and Harry laughed at the boy's eagerness. "We'd like to, Ted, but we have to make some plans and see what happens."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I read the article." The boy slumped into the chair next to Harry and took a crisp, popping it into his mouth. "That's pretty cool that you can blood adopt babies like that, or even have women carry them for you. Thank goodness blokes don't get pregnant, hey Harry?" Teddy gave Harry a little slug in the arm and an obnoxious wink.</p>
      <p>Draco raised an eyebrow at the lack of manners Teddy showed, talking while chewing. Teddy gave him an apologetic smile, showing the scolding was almost unnecessary.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, speaking of pregnant," Harry skewered Teddy with a direct look of his own, "that reminds me that we're due to have an extra special talk this summer. I've heard some interesting stories from Neville of what you've been up to at school this last term. What were their names?"</p>
      <p>Draco grinned. "Chloe and Clare, I believe."</p>
      <p>"Right. So start making your list of questions for when you stay here this weekend, got it?"</p>
      <p>Teddy rolled his eyes. "We already talked about the wands and the cauldrons, Harry. Besides, I got a bunch of answers from my mates at school."</p>
      <p>"Which is exactly <em>why</em> we're going to talk. You already know the mechanics of sex, yes, and you <em>think</em> you know what you're talking about, but now we're going to talk about responsibility and taking care of your partner. Mostly, we are going to talk about respect and consent, got it?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, sir," Teddy muttered, a disgruntled look upon his face. He left out a loud huff and stood up. "I'd better get going. I promised Gram I'd only be gone a few minutes. She's expecting me home to help her with the chores."</p>
      <p>"Oh, Teddy? If anyone asks about the article, tell them that we don't want to talk about it until we've had a chance to talk to the family this weekend. If you run into any reporters, just give them the usual."</p>
      <p>"Right, no comment. Got it. See ya, Harry, Draco." Teddy tossed in the floor powder and left, leaving the two men behind.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad you're having this conversation with him, and it's not me," Draco said with a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>Harry laughed. "Are you kidding? This is going to be a blast. I'm going to bring out the visual aids, props, make diagrams, give him condoms, even give him instructions on how to take care of his partner so they enjoy it, too. Remus did this for me when I was sixteen and I never forgot it." He felt a pang of sadness but forced a smile. "How could I do any less than give the same talk to his son?"</p>
      <p>Draco took his hand and squeezed. "Sounds perfect."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>"Harry, I'd like to help."</p>
      <p>Harry's looked up from where he'd been playing with his dessert to see Luna sitting next to him on the bench at the dinner table, the sunlight bouncing off her pale hair. It was a warm spring evening and Molly had moved the table outside in order to accommodate the larger than normal crowd gathered at the Burrow. They'd all wanted to talk to Harry about the article in the Prophet earlier in the week, but he and Draco had asked them all to wait until the previously planned Sunday dinner to discuss it.</p>
      <p>It was done now, though, and everyone was excited at their news. He'd be taking on a new position at the ministry, they'd be moving next month into their newly purchased home in Oxfordshire, and they'd begin looking into adopting a baby. Over time, if they found someone they felt comfortable with to be a surrogate, they might attempt surrogacy. They knew they wanted at least two children, perhaps eventually three, and they had time to figure it out.</p>
      <p>"Luna? That's sweet of you, but what do you mean? Help how?"</p>
      <p>She smiled brightly, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "I'd like to have your baby, Harry."</p>
      <p>Harry was grateful that he hadn't yet taken that drink of pumpkin juice he'd been reaching for, as he was sure Bill, who was sitting directly across from him, would now be wearing it. "What?"</p>
      <p>"I asked Hermione for more information about this surrogacy stuff months ago. I've been researching it and thinking it over for a while. Anyone who has seen the two of you together with the babies in the family knew that this would be coming soon. I was just waiting until you decided."</p>
      <p>"But Luna, I—"</p>
      <p>"Harry." She stopped him with an uncharacteristically firm tone. "Listen to me. I love you, and I love Draco. You're two of my closest friends. Additionally, I want to experience what it's like to be pregnant, but I've no desire to be a mother. I want to be everyone's favourite Auntie Luna, but I still need to be able to go on my research expeditions and come and go as I please. I'm a selfish being, Harry. I want to have my pudding and eat it, too, evidently. I can think of no one else that I'd rather see raise a child that I carried inside me."</p>
      <p>Harry felt his eyes burn, but couldn't look away from the deep blue eyes boring into his. He knew if he spoke at that moment, he'd embarrass himself. He took her hand and squeezed, begging her silently to give him a moment. This gift she was willing to give him, to give them, was priceless. He swallowed slowly and attempted to clear his throat.</p>
      <p>"Harry? Is everything okay over here?" Draco sat down next to him, his voice full of concern. "Luna? What's wrong with Harry? People are starting to notice."</p>
      <p>Harry leaned into Draco and placed his free hand over his husband's, then found his voice. "Luna wants to carry our baby."</p>
      <p>Draco inhaled sharply, but Luna interrupted before he could say anything. "I'd like you to use my egg as well, Harry, if you want it." She looked between the two of them. "I don't want any claim to the baby, and whoever's sperm you use obviously doesn't matter to me. The other can do a blood adoption with the baby officially after or whatever. I just want to see the baby grow up in love and happiness, and to know that I helped you both to have your family. Please let me do this?"</p>
      <p>By now they had drawn the attention of the entire Weasley clan, and only the voices of the children chasing gnomes in the garden could be heard. Harry looked at his husband and knew his feelings must be obvious in his gaze, just as the quick calculations of all the variables was obvious in Draco's. Finally, Draco smiled. "We'll need to talk this all the way through and make sure we are all completely aware of the others' expectations, but I think this is the best offer we could possibly get." He paused as if thinking, then smiled. "I also like the fact that Luna's grandmother was a Malfoy, so she's already family, and she has my colouring so if we use your contribution, Harry, the baby has a chance of looking like us both. But Luna—"</p>
      <p>"Yes, Draco, I'm sure. I'll sign whatever legal documents are necessary, and I won't travel during the pregnancy, so you can both be there for every healer's appointment if you want to be."</p>
      <p>Harry exchanged a glance with Draco and seeing what he was looking for in his husband's eye, finally stood up, pulling Luna with him, and wrapped his arms around her. "Thank you, darling. You're the best friend a man could have. If you're sure, and once we go through all the details you still want to do this, then we accept. And you'll be the best Auntie Luna our child could have." He felt tears falling down his face and didn't care. He felt Draco come and embrace them both and laughed lightly.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Luna, for everything," Draco's voice whispered into their embrace. "But I think we have a large audience now that wants an explanation."</p>
      <p>Harry chuckled. "Move my glasses up please so I can wipe my eyes?" Luna did as bid, and Harry wiped his eyes on Draco's shoulder. "Shall I?"</p>
      <p>"Go ahead," "Please do," came Luna and Draco's voices together, and Harry let go, turning to the nearly two dozen sets of eyes around him.</p>
      <p>"Luna's going to have our baby!"</p>
