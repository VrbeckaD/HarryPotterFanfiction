  <em>august 16, 1975</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maggie stood in her small room, Lark purring at her feet. She faced a large mirror in front of her, straightening out her robes and trying to desperately flatten a lock of curly black hair.</p><p>A tap on her door interrupted her efforts.</p><p>“Come in, mum.” Maggie said absentmindedly as she rubbed her blushing red cheeks, a sure sign that she was nervous.</p><p>Minerva entered her daughter’s room, an oasis of bright red and gold, Montrose Magpie posters, broomstick parts, and an unmade bed full of books.</p><p>“What in heavens name are those?” Minerva choked.</p><p>Maggie peered down at her robes, not seeing anything blindingly ill with them.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Those robes are not even pressed, Maggie!” Minerva sighed exasperatedly. “How do you expect to make Prefect if you wear your robes like Sirius Black?”</p><p>“I don’t see any wrinkles…” Maggie spun on her heels to try and catch a glimpse of her robe’s tail.</p><p>“Well the back side of your robes differ,” Minerva let out a small chuckle as she waved her wand to remove the offending wrinkles.</p><p>“Thanks.” Maggie sighed heartily.</p><p>Minerva peered at her daughter, a beautiful, energetic, now almost adult witch.</p><p>“Beautiful.”</p><p>Maggie smiled a bit, pushing her hair back behind her ears.</p><p>“Do you think I’ve got what it takes?” Maggie peered at the tip of her mother’s nose, not wanting to look her directly in the eye as she shared this bit of rare insecurity.</p><p>Minerva in turn took a seat on her daughter’s bed, moving a few books out of the way, examining this young witch in front of her who looked far more unsure of herself than usual.</p><p>“I do not think on matters, I know them or I do not. And I know you to be a witch of noble sense, of bravery, of camaraderie, of heart, of order…in most instances…”</p><p>Maggie grinned sheepishly.</p><p>“All makings of a fine prefect,” Minerva continued carefully. “Also all makings of a fine witch, regardless of title. If you are made one, then Hogwarts will have gained a mighty prefect. If not, you will still be all of those things and more.”</p><p>Maggie bit her lip, not knowing precisely how to respond to that moment of adoration from her mother. It was not that her mother ever lacked on affection and affirmations, in fact there had been numerous instances in which Minerva went above and beyond the doting mother much to Maggie’s chagrin.</p><p>It was the war.</p><p>The war that had crept into every fiber of their beings, the war that infiltrated nearly every aspect of everyone’s lives. It was hard to look at anything in exactly the same lens as before. There was an urgency, a pressing feeling that words needed to be said, actions needed to be made. So many people around them had been taken so suddenly that it felt as though life itself was but a fleeting guest.</p><p>“Not to mention a blasted good Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.” Maggie tilted her head up in an exaggerated pose.</p><p>Minerva allowed herself a belly laugh, relishing in the brief moment of charming carelessness that her daughter had been for so long of her short life.</p><p>“Confidence suits you well, remember that.”</p><p>Minerva smiled once more at her daughter with a sigh.</p><p>“I’ll wait for you in your office after the interview?” Maggie offered.</p><p>“No need. You go on with Lily and the others.” Minerva waved her hand dismissively.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“I will have the charming company of Madam Pomfrey all night long, I assure you.” Minerva smiled encouragingly.</p><p>“You’ll send if you need anything?”</p><p>“Are you my mother, dear?” Minerva quipped, earning a nervous chuckle from Maggie.</p><p>Maggie lunged toward her mother, enveloping her in an intense hug. Minerva smelled as she always did, of clean soap and a hint of lavender—a scent that Maggie knew to be the only safe foundation she had these days.</p><p>“I’m off then.” Maggie nodded with confidence as she grabbed for her Nimbus 1973.</p><p>“And Maggie?” Minerva called out in finality once Maggie had opened the front door of their cottage.</p><p>“Yes, mum?”</p><p>Minerva held her breath. I love you? Be safe? Patronus me when you get there safely? No goodbyes seemed fitting. Not when there was a clawing at her chest that seemed to consume her.<br/>“Do not engorge yourself at the ice cream parlor. The last thing we need is a sugar rush to last the entirety of your Hogwarts days.”</p><p>A gleam arose in Maggie’s eyes, a reminder of her still clinging innocence.</p><p>“Oh, what was that, mum?” Maggie feigned inability to hear as she mounted her broom.</p><p>“I said no dubious amounts of—”</p><p>Minerva cut herself off with a chuckle as Maggie grinned devilishly and sped off into the Hogsmeade sky.</p><p>As Maggie approached the Hogwarts main entrance, she noticed a gaggle of students.</p><p>A few Hufflepuff, a handful of Ravenclaws, merely two Slytherin and now herself being the first Gryffindor to arrive.</p><p>“Flying in on a broomstick, how Gryffindor of you.” Amelia Bones.</p><p>Maggie titled her head in mock arrogance as she went to embrace her long-time childhood friend.</p><p>“Only the brave of heart or something of that sort,” Maggie shrugged as Amelia playfully shoved her.</p><p>“Where’s the rest of your lot?” Amelia questioned.</p><p>“Haven’t got a clue,” Maggie ran her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“Cut your hair?” Amelia eyed.</p><p>“A bit, yeah. How’d you notice?” Maggie asked dumbfounded.</p><p>“The ends look healthier,” Amelia smiled as she gently touched the tips of Maggie’s hair.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were here already,” a confident but slightly grating voice said from behind Maggie.</p><p>Maggie turned to see Marlene McKinnon, her dorm mate and close friend.</p><p>“Early owl gets the worm?” Maggie raised two thumbs up in a failed attempt at a joke.</p><p>“What was she doing to your hair?” Marlene inquired Maggie, eyeing Amelia Bones who had rejoined her group of Hufflepuffs.</p><p>“She noticed my haircut is all,” Maggie said nonchalantly as she pulled a chocolate frog from her robes and began to eat it.</p><p>“I notice it too.” Marlene offered.</p><p>Maggie furrowed her brow, biting off a large piece of frog.</p><p>“You both are mad. I cut only an inch or so. To be honest, I myself didn’t even notice it.” Maggie chortled.</p><p>“The ends are less curly,” Marlene continued. “Usually they’re curlier.”</p><p>Maggie stopped eating her frog at once and felt her cheeks blossom into a frenzy of blush.</p><p>“Do you know who’s coming today?” Maggie quickly moved to change the topic.</p><p>“Lily for sure. As for the rest of those heathens, I have no idea. I wouldn’t expect the lot of them to be mildly interested in being representative of school conduct, would you?”</p><p>“James and Sirius are not as bed as you think they are,” Maggie replied. “You know that. They’ve changed a lot in the past year.”</p><p>“You’re only saying that because you’ve known James since you were both in nappies.”</p><p>“Valid point.”</p><p>“And you go to parties and Quidditch games like you’re one of the boys.”</p><p>“Also true.”</p><p>“You’re insufferable.” Marlene grinned as she threw an around Maggie’s shoulders and the two began their walk through the now opening doors of the Hogwarts castle.</p><p>To Marlene’s displeasure, James and Sirius did in fact join the interview crowd a few moments later.</p><p>Lily Evans also made her appearance.</p><p>“It does feel so good to be back home!” Lily sighed in joy.</p><p>The group of students waiting to be interviewed were enjoying snacks and refreshments in the Great Hall.</p><p>Lily and Marlene sat on either side of Maggie while Sirius, James and Peter sat across from them.</p><p>“One galleon says that McLaggen doesn’t make it out of that office without crying,” Sirius chuckled.</p><p>“Two galleons says he makes it to the bathroom at the very least before the tears roll about.” Peter offered back.</p><p>“You both are just jealous,” Marlene interjected.</p><p>“Of him?” Sirius cried aloud. “The boy’s a bloke if I’ve ever seen one.”</p><p>“He’s got ambition. That’s more than you can say for yourself.” Marlene countered as she bit off a bit of carrot.</p><p>“Since when did you start paying so much attention to McLaggen?” Maggie questioned as she played with a candied apple distractedly.</p><p>“He moved in the house across from us last summer,” Marlene said carelessly.</p><p>“You didn’t tell me that?” Maggie squinted.</p><p>“Well I don’t owl you every time I make a tea either, do I?” Marlene pursed her lips.</p><p>“Fair point.” Maggie relented but her throat tightened.</p><p>“Who is conducting the interviews anyway?” James asked.</p><p>“Blimey, I forgot you were here. You haven’t said much today.” Maggie laughed at one of her best friends.</p><p>“No Hogwarts event begins with the very James Potter!” James grinned, his laugh conveying that this was merely an act of faux arrogance.</p><p>Maggie noticed Lily smile.</p><p>“Headmaster Dumbledore of course, Professor McGonagall, Professor Slughorn, Professor Sprout and Professor Bishop.” Lily listed, popping one finger as she counted off each professor.</p><p>“Hold on a moment,” Peter began. “Your own mother is interviewing you, how is that fair?”</p><p>“Life is not fair, sweetums,” Sirius teased Peter.</p><p>“She’s not interviewing me, though I hardly need my mother to vouch for me.” Maggie put her fist under her chin, again making Marlene roll her eyes at her dramatics.</p><p>“Professor McGonagall is sitting out of her interview. To keep it fair, Wormtail.” James explained.</p><p>“I for one think it is very fair and noble of you to have requested that, Maggie.” Lily nodded in applaud.</p><p>“She had to give the lot of us a fighting chance,” Sirius laughed, nudging Maggie affectionately.</p><p>“Are we still going to Diagon Alley after this?” Marlene asked.</p><p>“I’m in,” James responded, eyeing Lily out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Maggie held in a laugh as she squeezed Marlene’s hand under the table, the two girls knowing all too well about the budding romance between the two.</p><p>“If James is going so am I,” Sirius concluded. “Wormtail?”</p><p>“I’ve got no other plans,” Peter shrugged.</p><p>“No surprise there,” Sirius chuckled. “Ladies?”</p><p>“Indeed. We have sleepover plans afterward anyway, right?” Maggie explained.</p><p>“Oooh, sleepovers!” Sirius mocked. “Are the lads invited?”</p><p>“Marlene McKinnon!” Professor Sprout’s voice boomed at the main arch leading into the Great Hall.</p><p>“In your wildest dreams, Black.” Marlene rolled her eyes as she left for her interview.</p><p>“Where is Alice by the way?” Maggie cocked her head to the side. “I thought she was coming today.”</p><p>“No, she went on that list minute trip to America remember?” Sirius replied.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.”<br/>The table grew silent. It was becoming more and more common for wizarding families, such as the Fortescues, to go on “vacations” meaning open-ended time away from the madness that had ensued all the community.</p><p>“And Remus?” Lily asked innocently.</p><p>“Had a bit of a stomach flu,” James quipped almost too suddenly.</p><p>“He gets ill quite often. We should look into brewing him a draught for that.” Lily pondered kindly as she picked at a slice of pumpkin pie on her plate.</p><p>“That’s very kind of you, Lily.” James smiled genuinely.</p><p>“Maggie McGonagall!” Professor Slughorn called out.</p><p>“That would be me,” Maggie bowed before her peers.</p><p>A chorus of cheers and whistles could be heard from behind Maggie as she followed Professor Slughorn to the Headmaster’s chambers.</p><p>Maggie tried to put on her serious face but the thought of Sirius and James bellowing for her brought the smile right back. It had been nearly all summer since she had seen them last. Although James admittedly had grown into a much more mature young man this year, he still had the charm and charisma that Maggie found to be her friend’s best qualities. She was grateful that in the midst of the raging war outside that there were still people like James Potter and Sirius Black—people who were all too aware of the dangers lurking outside but brave enough to laugh alongside them.</p><p>“Headmaster Dumbledore will be right in, Miss McGonagall.” Professor Slughorn noted as he made to leave the office.</p><p>“I thought there was a panel of professors conducting the interviews?” Maggie looked back at Slughorn.</p><p>“Headmaster shall be interviewing you alone, Miss. Very well, he will be right in.” Slughorn waved dismissively as he exited.</p><p>Maggie gnawed at the side of her cheek, clawing desperately at the words her mother had given her before she left… noble sense…bravery…order…</p><p>A surprising chuckle erupted from Maggie’s lips as she pondered on the last one. If only her mother knew half of the things she had gotten herself into with Sirius and James over the years.</p><p>“Miss McGonagall, ever a pleasure to see you.” Headmaster Dumbledore greeted Maggie as he made to sit down at his regal desk.</p><p>“Headmaster, thank you for considering me for the position. I must admit I was a bit surprised at your selection of me.” Maggie relented.</p><p>“And why is that, Miss McGonagall?”</p><p>“Well, sir it is no secret that my cohorts with Potter and Black have landed me in quite a few late nights of detention,” Maggie chuckled nervously.</p><p>“And do you still go on roaming the castle in the middle of the night, my dear?” Dumbledore smiled.</p><p>“No, sir.” Maggie replied dutifully.</p><p>“You impress me very much, Miss McGonagall. May I be candid with you? Just the two of us?”</p><p>“Of course, sir.”</p><p>“From the moment that Madam Pomfrey reported seeing a stag, a large black dog and a rat roaming the halls at night I knew the exact chain of events that had warranted these actions.”<br/>“You did, sir?” Maggie asked stupidly, her throat reaching scorching levels of dry.</p><p>“To become an Animagi at age thirteen is a feat that I daresay no witch of wizard has ever completed, including your mother. But to go on and teach three other students to do it? And to do it properly? My dear, you have a skill that cannot be taught.”</p><p>“Sir, I never meant to break any—”</p><p>“You knew of Mr. Lupin’s secret yet you never told anyone,” Dumbledore continued. “Not even to his closest friends. Once they figured it out themselves only then did you propose aiding them.”</p><p>Maggie sighed.</p><p>“I didn’t know Remus that well back then,” Maggie admitted, suddenly very interested in her robes.</p><p>“Well enough to see his loneliness?” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.</p><p>Maggie stood up, a sudden anxiety growing in her.</p><p>“Sir, there is so much magic around us…so much we have yet to uncover. So much we can use to help others, our friends, our brothers, our sisters… it seems a waste if we don’t use that to better our lives. Especially now. Right now.”</p><p>“You remind me very much of your father,” Dumbledore smiled.</p><p>Maggie sat herself back down in her seat, her interest now at an all time peak.</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>“He was very passionate about his work in the Ministry,” Dumbledore began, popping a candy into his mouth. “I believe it was what drew your mother to him. He saw the potential in very much with very little to prove. An honorable Slytherin, never used his ambition for ill matters.”</p><p>“So I’ve heard,” Maggie smiled half-heartedly.</p><p>“You also remind me very much of your mother,” Dumbledore countered.</p><p>“I’ve been told many times I resemble her,” Maggie laughed.</p><p>“When your mother first came to me, not so much asking as demanding that I teach her to become an Animagi, I was conflicted. As you are fully aware, it takes a great deal of effort, time and near flawless skill to become one. Many witches and wizards are better suited to transfer their energy into other branches of magic.”</p><p>“So why did you teach her, sir?” Maggie furrowed her brow.</p><p>“Because of her reason to become one. You’re aware of your mother’s past in the Ministry?”</p><p>“She was on the board of Aurors,” Maggie replied. “She doesn’t talk much about it.”</p><p>“Covert aurors rarely do,” Dumbledore smiled. “Your mother has always channeled her skills into doing something for the welfare of others and for order. You may not see her sternness and proclivity for rules as a good quality now but perhaps one day you will.”</p><p>Maggie nodded.</p><p>“Professor, may I ask you one thing today?”</p><p>“Of course, Miss McGonagall.”</p><p>“Since you know about Remus and all…it was a full moon last night. I love James and Sirius and the whole lot…but Remus, he was made for this, sir. He’s never let any of us down when we needed help in classes. He is always ready at arms to put an end to any of James and Remus’ schemes from going too far. All in all, sir, he deserves a chance to be interviewed. He’s still recovering from last night I’m sure but will you still consider him?”</p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled again, as if discovering something new and fresh for the first time.</p><p>“Thank you for your interview today, Miss McGonagall.”</p><p>Maggie smiled and nodded once, gently easing herself out of the headmaster’s office.</p><p>When Maggie returned to the Great Hall, the boys were the only ones waiting for her at the table.</p><p>“Where are Lily and Marlene? Marlene is still in her interview?” Maggie pondered.</p><p>“Could be a good thing,” James shrugged. “Slughorn took me and Sirius at the same time. I don’t think that is a good thing.”</p><p>“Poor bloke wanted to get it over with,” Sirius scratched his ear.</p><p>“Shall we go on a shenanigan while we wait for the beautiful ladies?” Sirius grinned.</p><p>“Black Lake it is!” Maggie hurrahed, earning a cheer from Sirius and a clap on the back from James. “Peter wait here and let the girls know where we went when they get back, eh?”</p><p>Peter’s grin fell from his face but nevertheless sighed in indignation and moved to sit back down at the table.</p><p>“Alright, on the count of three, we all jump in. First one out with something of mild amusement wins.” Maggie instructed.</p><p>The three of them stood at the edge of the Black Lake, their socks and shoes off.</p><p>“And what if we meet the squid?” Sirius laughed, his excitement radiating off of his smile.</p><p>“Then you win.” James grinned at the lake, a look of challenge boring into the water.</p><p>“Three!” Maggie began the count.</p><p>“Two!” Sirius added.</p><p>“One!” James bellowed as the three went crashing into the Black Lake.</p><p>Maggie felt the still warm August sun on her back, followed by the now chilly water of the Black Lake. Her vision was blurred but only momentarily. In front of her a large fish zoomed by.</p><p>Not wanting her laughter to the be cause of her drowning, Maggie propelled herself upward and erupted into the surface of the water in a fit of giggles.</p><p>“Thirty points for Gryffindor!” Sirius splashed wildly as he held up what appeared to be the remnants of a bludger.</p><p>“That’s not a treasure!” Maggie contested.</p><p>“It’s more than you’ve got!” Sirius chimed back.</p><p>“Where is James?” Maggie asked seriously, slight worry creeping into her voice.</p><p>“Dunno,” Sirius swam his way over to Maggie. “He’s not a particularly good swimmer come to think of it…”</p><p>“Sirius!” Maggie splashed at him, disbelief evident on her face. “Come on, we’ve got to look for him.”</p><p>Sirius nodded in agreement, making a movement to plunge himself back underwater but a sudden crashing sound stunned both Maggie and Sirius into place.</p><p>“What in Merlin’s name…” Maggie bobbed, watching the infamous giant squid erupt itself chaotically out of the surface of the water.</p><p>“Five thousand points for Gryffindor!” James bellowed, regally riding the giant squid without a care in the world.</p><p>Maggie eyed James in utter shock. Of all the wild tricks and schemes she had witnessed first hand from James Potter, this was the most obtuse and downright childish. Nevertheless, she could not hold herself back from whooping loudly. Sirius joined her in a chorus of praise for James.</p><p>Maggie dragged Sirius toward the bank of the water, excitedly climbing out and clapping James on the back once he had dismounted the great beast.</p><p>“You are by far the most dar—”</p><p>“Downright foolish boys at Hogwarts!” Marlene shrieked as she came barreling down the pathway from Hogwarts, Lily and Peter hot on her heels.<br/>Behind the fuming Marlene, Maggie could see Lily trying desperately to hide a smirk.</p><p>“It was quite marvelous actually, Mar,” Maggie offered as she approached Marlene.</p><p>“And why are you soaking wet?” Marlene signed in exasperation. “Please don’t say you rode the poor creature as well?”</p><p>“I must give credit where credit is due, I could never ride that beast!” Maggie cheered, clapping James on the back once more.</p><p>“Mate, that was some ingenious beast-wrangling.” Sirius bowed dramatically.</p><p>“Winner takes all?” James shook his wet hair, spraying the group of friends who all relented into a fit of giggles, Marlene included.</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, can you at least dry yourself off before we go to Diagon Alley?” Marlene sighed as she gently went to touch Maggie’s sopping wet curls.</p><p>James and the others were still making an ordeal of the situation, daring Lily to dip her feet into the water.</p><p>“It’s fine to admit you enjoyed our bit of trouble,” Maggie smiled sincerely at Marlene. “And it’s okay to touch my hair.”</p><p>The last part made both girls blush furiously but Maggie maintained her cool composure, water dripping from every area of her body from the tip of her brow to the bottom of her robes.</p><p>“It’s fine to admit you hang around a bunch of fools,” Marlene countered. “It really does look nice. Your hair that is.” Marlene quickly confirmed, clearing her throat and taking a step back.</p><p>“It’s alright to have a little fun now and then,” Maggie explained, pulling her dripping hair back. “It’s how we get through all of this.”</p><p>“How can you be so sure we’ll all get through it?” Marlene questioned pleadingly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Because we are stronger than they are. We have something, lots of things worth fighting for.”</p><p>Marlene let a small smile dance across her lips, eyeing Maggie’s form in front of her.</p><p>“I’m not sharing a broom with you if you’re still soaking wet.” Marlene concluded, turning on her heels away from Maggie.</p><p>“I’ll dry off in the sky!” Maggie argued playfully as the group of friends made their way to the front of the castle, a cacophony of laughter and squeals making small light from the darkness around them.</p>
