<p>
  <span>Harry sighed, laying his phone on his desk and looking back up to his computer screen. He was in the middle of writing a funny article about “Unicorns: real or REAL?”. The blog he worked for, The Quibbler, made a lot of entertaining crap like that. Of course, that wasn’t the only thing it posted. There were sections of people throughout the office that focused on different genres of articles, polls, quizzes, etc. Harry subtly looked over his monitor at the Events section. Lord, those people looked sickeningly gorgeous with their nonchalant hair styles and blazers that were </span>
  <em>
    <span>totally chalant</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Who were they fooling? They knew exactly how beautiful they were and how much everyone wanted their positions. Events were the most viewed posts throughout the whole site. Everyone wanted the glory of it. Harry hated the way the Events (which is what everyone in the office called them) held themselves, like they were the best goddamn things on the planet. Most of all, he hated that he desperately wanted their job. Not for the glory or crap like that. Harry wanted the position for the pure sake of writing event articles. He was tired of writing “funny” posts without any substance. Sure, it was entertaining. Just not to him. Ironically, his posts got the most hits than anyone in his section. Which might have been why he never got moved somewhere else.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t feel bad, Harry. We’re just as good as they are,” Came a whispy voice to the left of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry came back from his zoning out and turned to his deskmate, “What? Oh, no, don’t worry, Luna. I don’t think they’re better than us.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just their job</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna smiled softly at him, tucking her hair back behind her ears and revealing extravagant beet earrings. “That’s good. I know you don’t exactly love this section, but you’re really good at it, Harry. And I’m glad you’re working with me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry forced a smile. He loved Luna, but sometimes she unknowingly made him feel extremely guilty. Or maybe it was knowingly. He couldn’t tell. She tended to surprise him with how well she could read people.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks, Luna,” Harry mumbled, turning back to his article. He was about to finish his last paragraph, and add a cute gif for good measure, when he heard a cool, composed voice behind him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thomas, what is the meaning of this.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought it was funny!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I specifically told you to run crap like this by me. Now our Quibbler email is getting filled with hate mail.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry glanced behind him. Draco Malfoy, clad in a pressed suit, stood over Dean Thomas’ desk with one hand on his hip and the other holding out a printed version of said article. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, mate, I-” Dean started.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” Draco raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah… Look, Draco. It was supposed to be satire! I obviously don’t think the Holyhead Harpies are better than the Chudley Cannons,” He said, pointing to his green Harpies t-shirt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Okay, noted. But the </span>
  <em>
    <span>point</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Thomas, is that you should have at least gotten a beta reader to make sure the satire was clear.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dean nodded, albeit reluctantly, “Okay, okay. Sorry. I’ll run it by someone next time.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good,” Draco said curtly, turning to walk back to his office. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry caught Dean's eye, receiving a stuck out tongue and a thumb pointed in Draco’s direction. Harry gave a small smile and shrug in reply. Draco was known as the tough-as-nails manager. He looked over the whole of the Quibbler offices, but he was mainly a Public Relations Officer. He made sure the viewers were getting what they wanted and that the posts didn’t get too out of hand. He also helped manage the Quibbler email. Employees were allowed to wear whatever they wanted around the office, but Draco insisted on wearing suits and calling everyone by their last names. Some people said he took his job way too seriously. Others said he was just making sure the place never got too disorganized. Harry didn’t care which one it was, he just wished Draco would lay off a bit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Especially now, as Harry looked back at the door of Draco’s office, contemplating what he was about to do. If Draco was swamped with emails, his decision making might be off, which could be helpful to Harry. Plus, if Dean got off that easy, Harry might have a chance. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had already tried sending an application for the Events section to Draco. It was denied three times without so much of a response. At some point, Harry got really irked and wrote a long email explaining why he should have the position. He was pretty drunk when he wrote it late at night and completely freaked out when he realized he sent it. (The phrase “I’m a good ass writer and you know it, so what the fuck” may have come up at some point). Luckily, Draco never mentioned the email or anything. He only responded with an annoyingly simple “no” and that was the end of it. Harry was too humiliated to try bringing it up again. Until now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry glanced back at the office door. He could see Draco sit down at his desk through the translucent glass walls. Fuck it, he decided.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er… Luna, I have to talk to Draco real quick. I’ll be back.” He said, scooting out of his chair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay,” She said dreamily, still looking at her monitor, “Let me know if he lets you move positions.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smiled, walking over to Draco’s office. Nothing gets past Luna.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er, excuse me, Draco?” Harry said as he knocked lightly on the door. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come in.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry slowly pushed open the door, smiling apologetically. Draco barely looked up from his computer, typing away madly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, what is it, Potter.” Draco snapped, clearly fully engrossed in his emails.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know you’re busy, but I was wondering if I could… take a shot at the Events section.” Harry said, scratching at the back of his neck. “Er, again,” He added hastily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco suddenly stopped, looking at Harry. “No.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wha-?” Harry started, but bit his tongue at Draco’s expression. That damn eyebrow was up again. Harry tried his best to level his voice, “I don’t understand why you won't let me at least </span>
  <em>
    <span>try</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because you’re good in the Humor section.” Draco said simply, looking back at his monitor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, but I could be just as good in the Events!” Harry said, a little louder than he planned. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco ignored his outburst. The Quibbler employees could say what they wanted about Draco, but they had to admit, he was one composed motherfucker. The blond turned to him, sighing. “Look, Potter. I get it. You’re tired of where you’re at. But I’ll be frank with you: you and Lovegood are the best Humor writers out there, there are too many people from other sections trying to get into the Events section, and, to be honest, you never actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>go</span>
  </em>
  <span> to any events.” He held up his fist, putting up a finger for each point. “Sorry, Potter. But you can forget about the Event section.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry wanted to argue, his mouth already open to say something, but he knew Draco was right. There were too many things against him. He and Luna </span>
  <em>
    <span>were</span>
  </em>
  <span> the best. And probably the least likely to cause issues like the one Dean had. Plus, what events </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> he ever go to? Certainly not the popular, mainstream one’s that the Events went to. How could he ever bring an edge to their section? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Actually,” Harry said slowly, the idea formulating in his head as he said the words, “I do go to events… They’re just more, er, underground. In fact, I’m going to one tonight!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco pursed his lips and narrowed his eyes, “Is that so…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah! I mean, I don’t usually talk about them because, well, er, I figured no one would be interested… but it would definitely bring something new to Events…” Harry trailed off, hopeful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco paused, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. After a moment, he nodded. “Okay. Fine. If you would go as far as send an outrageous and obviously drunk email,” (Harry cringed at that), “or lie about some bullshit underground crap to get a chance, then fine.” He swiftly turned back to his computer, starting to type again, “I want that article on my desk by Monday.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Brilliant!” Harry grinned, practically running out the door, “See you Monday!” He thought he might’ve seen Draco roll his eyes, but was too concentrated on getting to his phone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you got in?” Luna asked as Harry scrambled back to his desk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? Oh, no. But I got a chance to switch.” He said excitedly, grabbing his phone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, well, I hope you get to be in the Events. You’re a good writer no matter where you are,” Luna said, a genuine smile on her face. Harry paused, in the middle of typing his phone password, just to appreciate how happy Luna could be for others.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks, Luna.” He grinned, before turning back to his phone.</span>

<br/>
<span>Harry smiled, slipping his phone into his pocket and turning back to his work. Finally, he was getting a chance at writing something of substance. He looked at his finished post, hoping it would be the last Humor article he had to write, and decided to add another gif or two. For good measure.</span>
