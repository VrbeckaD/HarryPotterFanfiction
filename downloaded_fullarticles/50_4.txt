    <p>
  <span>The Dark Lord had a large sweet tooth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was something Evanna had noticed as she took breakfast over the course of three days. The House-Elves would--of course--fix up a proper English breakfast each morning--eggs, grilled tomatoes, bacon, kippers, baked beans. But the thing that fascinated Evanna to watch was the toast, which the Dark Lord would absolutely slather in sweet marmalade before eating. Beyond that, he would add heapfuls of sugar to his tea in a way that her mother would have described as ‘low class’ if not for who it was sweetening the beverage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More eggs, Evanna?” the Dark Lord said, sounding perfectly posh as he did so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you, milord,” she said quickly. The Dark Lord frowned and she felt some form of disappointment from him. That was right. He was not just the Dark Lord. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was her </span>
  <em>
    <span>father</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those three days, after coming home from her third year in Hogwarts, had been one of the strangest, and strangely peaceful, weeks in her life. When she had arrived home, she had been expecting to be punished for her association with Harry Potter. Instead, she had been immediately whisked into Lucius Malfoy’s study and introduced to the Dark Lord Voldemort himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was still so strange to her. For years, she had wished and wished that she had any father in the world but Lucius Malfoy. Since going to Hogwarts, she had often hoped against hope that Severus Snape was her father. Her coloring was more similar to his any way, and the Potions Master was far kinder to her, protecting her best he could in a dangerous school like Hogwarts. He had never been cruel, never punished her beyond reason, never took advantage of her or forced her into doing Dark Magicks before her time. Yes, Severus would have been an altogether much better father, but as her years in Hogwarts had progressed, she had let go of those hopes. Severus was not her father; Lucius was, though she wished for anyone, someone to rescue her from his clutches. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her wishes, apparently, were dangerous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After introducing himself as her father, the Dark Lord had explained that at the height of his power, he had decided to safeguard his legacy in many ways. One of those ways was to produce an heir--not just to the new world order he hoped to build, but also to the great legacy Salazar Slytherin had left him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Left to </span>
  <em>
    <span>us</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he had emphasized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so, with the help of his most faithful servant, he had Evanna. After a lengthy conversation with him (or really, a lot of the Dark Lord speaking. That was the other thing she had learned about him--Lord Voldemort </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span> to talk), a House-Elf had escorted her to a new room--the second largest in the Manor, right next door to the Master, which the Dark Lord had taken as his own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not the Dark Lord. Her father. She had to remember that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know,” the Dar--her father--said breezily, “you are still an enigma to me, child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna blinked. “My lor--sir?” she said. A flash of approval at her correction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your hair hardly suits that of an heiress of a great house,” he said. Evanna flushed, remembering why, exactly, she had cut her hair. “That would imply a certain amount of rebellion, a lack of respect for your betters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna opened her mouth and then snapped it back shut. Her father smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet you seem to cower before me,” he said. “I tell you there is no need for you to show the same amount of reverence I expect from my Death Eaters, and yet you posture before me like one of the Unmarked masses!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna was completely confused by this statement. It did not fit at all with the tales she had been raised on about Lord Voldemort. In the Wizarding World at large, he was feared beyond all, his name alone was enough to incite terror. Within Malfoy Manor, and to some extent, Slytherin House, he was only whispered about--feared, yes, but also revered for rising to such heights in pursuit of a world where wizards would have no need to hide who they were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Forgive me, sir, but you are no Lucius Malfoy,” she said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” He took a small sip of his sickly sweet tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are much scarier,” she said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His red eyes widened slightly over the teacup. Evanna was mortified to realize he was laughing at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You truly are a surprise, Evanna,” he said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doing her best to cover her embarrassment, Evanna took a sip of her own tea, allowing the cup to linger in front of her face for much longer than was necessarily proper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I am scarier than Lucius Malfoy,” her father said, watching her carefully as she sat her teacup back onto its saucer. “However, had things gone the way they ought to have, you would realize that you, my dear, will one day be far scarier than the slippery ferret as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna frowned. “What are you--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think it means when I call you my heir?” her father asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I--erm--I--” Evanna stammered, not at all comfortable with the question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A lord needs an heir to secure his power. To be his representative, to act on his behalf,” her father said. “This legacy that our great forebearer Salazar Slytherin left us extends beyond the scope of Britain. I knew I would need a second-in-command who would be my equal in blood, status and power. Only you would do for that, Evanna."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But--but I'm not a boy," she said. "I--I can't be--tradition says--"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your mother taught me that before the Romans invaded, the magical tribes of Britain were far more egalitarian. Power ruled. Witches and wizards ruled over muggles, and the most powerful witch or wizard ruled over them all. That is the world which we will restore. And, you, my dear, are very powerful. More than Lucius Malfoy."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna's mind was spinning. She knew there were things she could do that not in her year could hope. But, there were also her abysmal Charms and everything Lucius had ever done to her. The picture her father was painting seemed too good to be true. She would never bow to Lucius Malfoy again. He would bow to her. But…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We don't need to discuss it all right now," the Dark Lord said. "Have you anything you wish to have? It will be given."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna chewed on her lip. What did one ask from a Dark Lord when he was also one's father? This was all so confusing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Might… might I see my mother?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We are working on rescuing my fallen servants from Azkaban. It shouldn't be long," the Dark Lord said, his face darkening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So her birth mother was in Azkaban. That was interesting. But that wasn't quite what Evanna had been asking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean--can I see Narcissa?” she said. “Please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A muscle in the Dark Lord’s jaw twitched and he had an unreadable expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that all?” he asked. “You can ask for anything and it will not be denied you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Spare Harry Potter.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The thought came from nowhere and she quickly squashed it down. It would be suicide to ask for such a thing. Still, it seemed the Dark Lord was determined to indulge his daughter and it would not do to refuse him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“May I consider it, si--Father?” she said, testing the name on her tongue. His calculating eyes softened slightly and he nodded. She felt a flash of approval</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I will inform Lucius to make arrangements for you to see Narcissa,” he said, rising from his seat. “Now, I believe it is time to test your skills. Lucius tells me he has trained you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna felt her insides turn to ice. Lucius’ training was often horrible enough, but to train with Lord Voldemort himself?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Surely you have more important things to do? I mean, you already insist on taking breakfast with me every morning--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You would deny training from the Dark Lord himself?” he said mildly. “And here I was told you are a Slytherin…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna saw the words for the challenge that they were, but it still riled her. Though she may not have been like her brother, constantly performing to the House to remain on top of the Slytherin hierarchy, she was still a Slytherin. She still had ambition and had been teaching herself to achieve more and more in her powers as a </span>
  <em>
    <span>léitheoir aigne</span>
  </em>
  <span>, as well as studying the diaries of Salazar Slytherin himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her response came in Parseltongue. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I am Sssslytherin.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord smiled widely, the expression making him look equally human and unearthly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Very good. You will be marveloussss, Evanna.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Narcissa was being kept in the Spell-Damage Unit of St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Not wishing to subject herself to Lucius Malfoy, Evanna had demanded Draco be her escort to the hospital. He had met her in the parlor, not quite meeting her eyes as he gave an awkward bow. She flushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been told?” she said softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He focused on the floor. “Yes, milady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna did not know how to react to that. On the one hand, her father would insist it was nothing more than her due as his heir. On the other, Draco was her brother--or at least, they had been raised as siblings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do that,” she said. “With things the way they are, you have to treat me as you always have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco still didn’t quite meet her eyes. Evanna got the feeling that he had been instructed not to for whatever reason. She was surprised at how much the thought saddened her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll do my best,” he said. “How--how have you been?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite being in the same house, the two had been pretty much separated from the moment they had arrived home. Instead, Evanna had taken meals in the formal dining room, often, though not always, with the Dark Lord. When he had the time, he had tested her magical skill level, and brought in tutors from his followers--though she had demanded Lucius would not be one of those tutors--to train her in areas where he felt she was deficient. At times, he had even taught her himself.  And Draco had--well, she really did not know what her once-brother had been doing while she was sequestered. That worried her somewhat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been well,” she said. “I’ve been training.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt a flash of jealousy from him and almost sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Of course,” he said. “Shall we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without another word, Draco threw down a handful of Floo powder and said “St. Mugo’s--Spell Damage Ward!” In a flash of green flame, he was gone. Shaking her head, Evanna stepped in and did the same. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had already asked for directions to their mother’s private room and lead Evanna through the hallway silently. When they arrived, Narcissa was sitting up in bed, reading a book. When she looked up to see her children, her mouth fell open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Evanna! Your hair!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna smiled sheepishly and ran her hands through her short curls. Though it was no longer the rough hack job that it had started as, thanks to the efforts of Eva and Elin, it was certainly far shorter than anything that Narcissa Malfoy would approve of. She had dressed very properly to try and appease her mother--</span>
  <em>
    <span>not actually my mother</span>
  </em>
  <span>--in an a-line dress and flared, lightweight robes. It did not seem to be enough, though. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I decided to cut it,” she said lightly. Draco snorted and she elbowed him. The three exchanged small talk, though the conversation did not last. Soon, they were sitting there silently, not quite looking at each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When are you coming home, Mother?” Draco finally said. “Do the Healers know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna shot him a nasty glare. If being in St Mungo’s kept Narciss safe and away from Lucius, Evanna would keep her there forever. Draco glared back at her--at least he did until he remembered who she was and looked at the floor again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That’s the Dark Lord’s daughter, you fool. But it’s Evanna. She’s my little sister--but not anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna looked away from him as well, throat tight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco, darling, would you mind waiting outside the door for a moment? I need to speak with your sister,” Narcissa said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just a moment,” she said with a certain steeliness to her tone that allowed no argument. Draco stomped out in a huff. Narcissa sighed and lifted her wand to cast a privacy charm over the room. Evanna watched her every movement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why did you not tell me?” Evanna said immediately, the hurt she had been pushing away finally bubbling up within her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Darling, I thought it was for the best,” she said. “I never wanted you to grow up having training sessions and people either bowing before you or running away in fear. The night you were born was also the night of--of your father’s downfall. Weeks later, and your mother was imprisoned in Azkaban.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lucius still trained me,” she said. “Was it so much better that I was scared of him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissa looked at her hands. “I did my best to protect you while I was still there. I am afraid that the older you grew, the more fearful of you Lucius became. He wanted nothing more than to control you. And I was no longer there to curb his worst ideas.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna’s lower lip quivered. Her mother--</span>
  <em>
    <span>not my mother</span>
  </em>
  <span>--did not even know the worst of it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>And no one will.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When--when do you come home?” Evanna said, changing the subject abruptly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your fa--Lucius wishes me to come home in the next two days,” Narcissa said, her voice tight. Evanna could feel her resignation and nervousness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what do the Healers say?” Evanna demanded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They--they would want me to have more treatment,” Narcissa said softly, then her eyes flashed. “Do not--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna rose and went over to the door. “Draco, you may have a moment with her,” she said. “I am going on home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her brother stalked back in, a sullen expression still on his face. Not even pausing to say goodbye to Narcissa--she would not give the woman an opportunity to tell her no--she walked to the fireplace and Floo’d back to the Manor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once inside the Manor, she made her way immediately to Lucius’ study, which the Dark Lord had taken over in the past week. She swallowed looking at the door, terrible memories threatening to overwhelm her. Steeling herself, she knocked on the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord seemed slightly irritated when he opened the door. Like before, the room was dim, but the fire was roaring. He regarded Evanna with cool curiosity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Evanna,” he said. “I had not realized you had already returned from your visit with Narcissa. I hear she is to come home soon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna’s mouth felt very dry. But, she had to push on. He had said he would give her anything she wanted, and she wanted this more than anything at the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is why I am here, sir,” she said. “I don’t want her coming back to the Manor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord raised an eyebrow and gestured for her to come into the study. Evanna did as she was bid and he closed the door. She did her best not to jump at the sound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You ask me to bar the wife of one of my highest ranking Death Eaters from his own home. Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Narcissa still needs care. I believe Lucius is trying to prevent that care,” Evanna said. “She was staying with Severus Snape in Hogwarts before--perhaps she could go back to him? He took her care very seriously and it was helpful to have her so nearby. It could be useful again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord looked thoughtful. “Lucius is still one of my most loyal--he took care of my heir when--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Narcissa took care of me, not Lucius,” Evanna snapped before realizing she had just interrupted the most powerful wizards of all time. She looked away, shaking, the Dark Lord’s gaze heavy upon her. The silence stretched before her as she waited to be punished or tortured for her cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well,” he finally said. “Narcissa will be sent to Snape, to help him keep an eye out for you in Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Evanna just barely restrained herself from gaping at her father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th--thank you,” she said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord nodded, that curious look in his red eyes marred by something darker. Suspicion. Evanna could not have left the study quickly enough. </span>
