    <p align="left">Dark was the wizarding world after Voldemort’s victory at the Battle of Hogwarts. It was on a particularly chilly night that Hermione Granger found herself sat on a lumpy couch, dying embers in the fireplace, a worn rug under her feet. Light peered out through a slit in the curtains from the sitting room of 12 Grimmauld Place, which had been reclaimed with much difficulty, and at the cost of too much.</p><p>She was sandwiched between the other two of the Golden Trio, shoulders rubbing on the too-small couch, her bushy hair tickling Ron’s neck as she leaned her head on him. It was only moments – mean minutes – from her departure, and the boys were pleading a lost case.</p><p>“Let us go with you, Hermione,” Harry said, as he had done all day and throughout dinner. “We’ve always been together, been through so much together-”</p><p>“And we’ve been through why the both of you <em>can’t</em>, Harry.” Exasperated, she continued as patiently as she could manage. “Ron needs to stay here. The order has far too few people these days.”</p><p>“I can help,” the ginger interjected hurriedly, turning to face her and knocking her head off his shoulder in the process. “It’ll be quicker and safer if I’m there, and they’re my parents as much as yours-”</p><p>“<em>Quicker and safer</em>?!” she repeated incredulously, her tone rising in both volume and pitch. “I think I’m more than qualified and capable of handling this by myself, thank you very much-”</p><p>“Can’t you just accept help from somebody else for once in your life, Hermione!” Ron snapped, his ears starting to turn red.</p><p>“Besides,” she ploughed on, speaking loudly over him, “<em>You</em> barely know them, <em>you’ve</em> barely spoken to them, and just because we’re dating does not make them yours. They are <em>my</em> parents, Ronald.” She sensed, as she was rattling on, that she had gone a shade too far. Upon seeing his hurt, she felt her heart break, and an apology spilt almost immediately from the mouth that scolded him. “I’m sorry – I didn’t mean to-” The witch sighed and softened her tone; frayed nerves and tired mind, they were all on edge of late.</p><p>“This is the best plan we’ve got, Ron. You know it is. It won’t take long; I just need to check – I need to know that they’re…safe." There was a suffocating silence. Nobody was simply <em>safe</em> in times of war, and they were all aware of the fact.</p><p>“And<em> you</em>, Harry,” the witch continued, having gathered herself from the worst possible outcomes that raced across her mind during the pause. “The wizarding world can’t risk losing you. This is far too dangerous and you’re all we’ve got left against You-Know-Who. You’re our symbol of hope. You’ve <em>got</em> to stay safe."</p><p>It was Harry’s turn to snap. “A symbol of hope everyone thinks is dead? Or a symbol of hope that instead of inspiring, cowers in a house protected by charms? I’m sure that’s a great help, Hermione. The only thing I’m a symbol of is weakness, or failure, or – or-”</p><p>“Harry-” she began desperately, turning to Ron for support and turning back just as quickly when she saw him staring resolutely into the fireplace, clearly still stung by their brief argument.</p><p>“I can’t stay here knowing that people out there are still fighting, and dying, and you-”</p><p>“I won’t die, Harry.” She gave his hand a squeeze, reassuring him as much as she was reassuring herself. A soft knock informed of Mrs Weasley’s presence, her wide frame blocking the dim light from the corridor as the door swung open.</p><p>“It’s time, Hermione, dear. Come on now.” The woman made a brisk <em>follow-me</em> motion with an impatient wave of her hand, pressed by a sense of urgency against an evil that seemed to breathe on their windows and prowl outside their doorstep.</p><p>Hermione extracted herself from between the boys; they started and made to follow but the witch was faster, and Harry and Ron were flung back onto the couch by a silent binding spell. She had overheard them earlier in the day with a plan to latch onto her when she disapparated, and was determined to keep that from happening. They would follow her to the ends of earth and the edge of hell, but she was heading straight into the heart of the inferno.</p><p><em>Was this how Harry felt when he had to hunt Horcruxes? </em>Hermione wondered as she turned to face her best friend and lover, dearer than brothers, studying their features more intimately than she had ever cared to in more peaceful times. She brushed Harry’s dark hair, adjusted his slightly askew glasses, smoothed out Ron’s maroon sweater, brushed her fingertips over his lips; misty eyed, shaky hands.</p><p>“I’ll send a patronus, I promise,” she whispered. “I...”</p><p>Words failed her, failed any promise that she could have kept apart from the one she had just made.</p><p>It was on a particularly chilly night that Hermione Granger kissed Harry Potter good bye on the cheek and Ronald Weasley on the forehead, her lips lingering for a second longer against ginger hair, as the boys sat on a lumpy couch in front of her, dying embers in the fireplace, a worn rug under their feet. As glad as she was to have rendered them immobile and mute, for a single word from either of their mouths would surely break her resolve, she could have made do with a “Stay safe, ‘mione.”</p><p>And then she was out the door and in the hallway, a piece of parchment with an address hurriedly shoved from trembling hand to trembling hand. She found herself engulfed in a warm crushing hug from Mrs Weasley, and then a rather suffocating embrace from Ginny who had raced down the stairs loudly, flaming haired, bloodshot eyed and red nosed.</p><p>Hermione was ushered out the front door, and the last thing she saw was the dim yellow glow from the hanging lamp in the entrance hall before she disapparated with a soft pop.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Weathered floorboards, a kitchenette tucked behind a scratched dining table, books stacked on groaning shelves that curved under their weight. The front door opened and closed hastily as a young witch stumbled in.</p><p>“<em>Lumos</em>,” she whispered, and then, “<em>Homenum Revelio.</em>”</p><p>Her eyes darted around the room, teeth clenched as her scrutinising gaze passed over shadowy corners. Nothing.</p><p>Standing alone in a small flat in muggle London, Hermione held her breath as she paced around, her wand at the ready. Although it was protected with a Fidelius Charm (Mrs Weasley was the secret keeper – “<em>only one</em>”, she’d said sternly after the mess happened with multiple keepers for 12 Grimmauld Place), she knew better than to let her guard down until she was utterly and completely certain the area was secure.</p><p>Pushing open the bedroom door cautiously, she peered in, the small light at the tip of her wand illuminating a bed pushed against the wall, a small closest and a desk that faced the window. Silence. It was not until she had checked the bathroom and dragged the shower curtain open roughly to reveal, to her relief, an empty bathtub did she allow her tense shoulders to droop.</p><p>As Hermione made for the door she saw, in the corner of her eye, a movement and, simultaneously, felt the sensation of something grabbing at her ankles. Startled, she cried out loud, instinctively blasting a spell and snatching at the doorknob as she scrambled for the corridor. Breathing heavily, strands of her wild curls tickled by every exhalation, Hermione observed the scene of her fright and slumped to the floor, fatigued in both mind and body.</p><p>Constant vigilance, she found, soon after putting the phrase to practise, strained her nerves and breathed nightmares into her sleep, but it kept her alive and that was all you could hope to be during a war. Mirror shards glinted from the tiled bathroom floor, as did Crookshank’s eyes when he padded cautiously to his mistress. Her goddamned reflection and her goddamned cat, she realised, had made her scream like a frightened child and fire an offensive spell.</p><p>“How embarrassing,” she muttered, gripping her wand too tightly in her clammy palm. And then she let out a shaky chuckle, because if Harry and Ron were here they would have laughed at the situation.</p><p>“Hermione, are you all right?!” Harry would have asked, footsteps thudding as he ran to her.</p><p>“Bloody hell, ‘mione. What happened here?” Her chuckles grew louder as she imagined Ron’s bewildered face.</p><p>“I’m okay,” she would have replied. “Crookshanks just gave me a bit of a scare.”</p><p>“Finally realised how ugly your cat is, have you?” Ron would have prodded the animal with his toe, and she would scoop her pet up and protest while Harry stood with an amused grin as he watched them bicker.</p><p>A soft mew brought the girl back to her patch of floor, worn wallpaper, a dark corridor and a mirror waiting to be repaired. The chuckles her reverie had induced subsided, and Hermione surrendered to exhaustion and harrowing silence, her sobs echoing around the empty flat; crying because she had never felt more alone, and crying <em>because</em> she was alone.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Ninety miles away from Hermione sat a group of cloaked figures in high backed chairs around a polished wooden table, conversing in hushed, hurried voices. It was a large, grand room, with tall windows that overlooked the gardens and an antique Persian rug that bore the footfall of generations. There was a handsome fireplace set in the wall across them, but nobody had cared to stoke the fire and only dying embers remained. At the far end of the table sat a man who might have, at one time, commanded respect and fear, but his pale complexion and long blonde hair had turned grey, and his proud aristocratic features now sunken and pinched. </p><p>Draco Malfoy found himself watching his father in pained silence, as he often did whenever he was permitted to see him. The Dark Lord had been severe in his punishment and insatiable in his anger after the war was won, in particular towards his mother, who had committed treason the moment she announced Potter’s death. She had not been allowed to live, but she was safe from his wrath in death, and they all still suffered it in life… He was roused from painful recollection when a stifling silence blanketed room, and fear snaked its way around the table.</p><p>“My friends,” said a cold voice that grew steadily louder. “My loyal companions, we have been diligent in pruning our community, I trust?”</p><p>“Yes, my lord…,” the quiet murmur rippled around the table.</p><p>“And what of Potter?” he enquired. With Bellatrix gone, there was a clear absence of eagerness and unreserved adoration for the Dark Lord who, as he made his way slowly to his seat, found his Death Eaters with heads bowed in submissive fear.</p><p>“So quiet,” he hissed. “And silence marks guilt.” A shiver ran through the group. “Have I come here to be disappointed again? To find that my most elite, my most <em>trusted</em> friends, to have failed me?”</p><p>“Please, my Lord,” said Rookwood, “With the ministry’s resources and our men, we have been searching tirelessly for the boy-”</p><p>“And found nothing.” Voldemort concluded in an icy tone, and Rookwood lowered his head in shame. “We have won the war, but the boy is still <em>alive. </em>I need him <em>dead</em> – ” the group flinched “ – and all I see before me are complacent fools, delirious on past victories and diseased in idleness. Perhaps a reminder of what happens to those that fail…repeatedly…” His long, spider-like fingers reached for his wand and Lucius whimpered softly, trembling in his own house.</p><p>“My Lord.” The table turned towards the clear voice. It belonged to Theodore Nott, a bony, curly-haired Slytherin who, being a pure-blooded son of a Death Eater was deemed eligible to serve as a playmate for Draco in their youth. He continued swiftly. “We may not have Potter, but we have located somebody else – we have Granger’s parents.”</p><p>“Granger…” Voldemort repeated the name, deep in thought. “Illuminate me, Nott, what value does a Mudblood and her muggle parents offer us? We have killed and we have tortured what remains of the Order. Nothing can convince Potter to come out from hiding. I’m afraid our little friend is no longer the hero Dumbledore posed him to be…”</p><p>“Potter loves her,” Theodore said simply, and Voldemort gave a large sigh of mock understanding.</p><p>“Oh, <em>love</em>. Yes, I see how terrifying it is now…Dumbledore believed in it, and Severus perished because of it. And your mother, Draco, was so full of love she <em>lied</em> and <em>betrayed</em>…<em>crucio</em>!”</p><p>Pain. The boy watched as his father writhed in his seat, his screams reverberating around the room, crashing in his ears. It was a familiar scene these days, but Draco Malfoy still felt the chill creep through the windows and settle in his bones.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>After suffering heavy losses after the war, the Dark Lord had turned his attention to the youths in Slytherin in search of replacements for his fallen Death Eaters. Those who had yet to complete their schooling did so under his twisted regime at Hogwarts, learning prejudice and studying injustice, while those who were of age were expected to follow and serve his regime immediately. Sat on two velvet chaise lounges around a small, ornate fireplace were four such young people, comprising of two witches and two wizards.  </p><p>“Well? What happened in there?” A pug-faced girl leaned forward, her face shining with anticipation. Meetings these days were shrouded in such secrecy, and allowed so few of the Dark Lord’s followers, that they often became a particularly enticing source of gossip. “Go on, tell us, Theodore, we’re dying to know, and we’ve been waiting here forever.” She turned to her slender, golden-haired companion for affirmation. “Haven’t we, Daphne?”</p><p>Daphne Greengrass clearly did not share in her friends’ excitement, for she was perched on her seat so stiffly one might have thought she had the <em>Immobulus</em> charm cast on her. Curiosity, however, loosened her pursed lips and, turning to the boy, asked, “Did you tell him about Granger’s parents?”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“And? Did the Dark Lord say anything?”</p><p>“Not much.”</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘not much’? Was he – was he pleased?”</p><p>Theodore sighed. “What do you want the Dark Lord to say? ‘Well done, Theo, fantastic work. Here’s a chocolate frog. Run along now and I’ll read you a bedtime story later.’ The Dark Lord wants Potter, so until we can use the mudblood’s parents to find the bespectacled nuisance somehow, no, Daphne. He was not <em>pleased</em>.”</p><p>“We heard screaming,” said the pug-faced girl breathlessly. “Who was it? Although I can probably guess…” She glanced, with a sneering cruelness, at the pale faced and pale haired boy across her. “Was it your <em>daddy</em>, Draco?”</p><p>“Oh, stop it, Pansy,” snapped Daphne, but the damage was done. The chaise lounge creaked as Draco stood abruptly, wand clenched in white knuckles, aiming curse after curse at Pansy Parkinson, who shrieked and drew her own wand. Daphne cried desperately, “Stop! <em>Stop!</em>” while Theodore cast a protective charm, deciding that waiting it out was better than getting involved.</p><p>“You dare-“, breathed Malfoy heavily as he flung every offensive spell he could remember at the squealing girl. “You insult my family – you <em>dare</em> – my father is –” But Pansy had reached the door, and though she had a deep cut on her arm and singed hair, she was largely unharmed. She scrabbled at the handle and disappeared into the hallway, leaving her companions in a room with smouldering wallpaper and an angry portrait that waved his fists and shouted obscenities. </p><p>“Thank you for your help, Theodore,” Daphne said dryly.</p><p>The boy shrugged. “Draco didn’t need it. Besides, you get what you sow. Pansy deserved that.” </p><p>“She deserved <em>that</em>? She could have been seriously injured, having curses thrown like that-”</p><p>“She should’ve kept her mouth shut then, shouldn’t she-”</p><p>Draco closed the door on their bickering and made his way to his room, head aching and hands shaking. After the war, the Malfoys, stripped of their influence and status amongst the Death Eaters, found many of their friendships and alliances to have been built on what was lost. Their reputation had kept many threats at bay, but now they were exposed to those they had wronged, and those who had been jealous of their wealth and power.</p><p>For Theodore he was grateful, as the boy proved to be a steadfast, loyal friend, and though difficult to understand at times, had never mistreated him. Daphne was a girl of quick temper and moderate sensibility; ruthless if need be but did not indulge in unnecessary sadism. But <em>Pansy</em>, Draco thought bitterly, <em>sweet, stupid, hateful adoring Pansy</em>, had abandoned her high regard of him when she learnt of their family’s disgrace, and witnessed them slighted in their own home. He who she used to worship!</p><p><em>She didn’t worship </em>you, <em>you stupid idiot</em>, a nasty voice said inside his head. <em>She only loved the glamorous prestige of the Malfoy name, and the contents of your family vault. You have nothing now. You’re not Mommy’s golden boy or Daddy’s heir...you’re just Draco Malfoy, and what is there to love about </em>him<em>? </em></p>
