<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The Ghost of You</p><p align="center">6th June, 1994－Hermione, 14</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“You really are the brightest witch of your age.” Sirius smiled down at Hermione from Buckbeak’s back.</p><p>They had done it! They had fixed everything－saved Buckbeak and Sirius in one night. Hermione and Harry had managed the impossible. The pair smiled, too, and hurried back toward the school hospital. Something shining from the end of the unused corridor caught her attention. The glowing swirled and shone like a pulsing aura.</p><p>“Hermione?” Harry spoke, causing her to jump from her trance looking down the corridor. “What are you staring at?”</p><p>“That.” Hermione pointed toward the light shining before them.</p><p>“What is that?” he asked, glancing at her.</p><p>“I have no idea, but I don’t have a good feeling about it,” she replied uneasily. “We should probably get Professor Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Let’s check it out,” he whispered, moving closer to it. He always had to be adventurous and want to investigate for himself. Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Harry, no!” she called out to him as he got near it. “I don’t want to go down here. Whatever it is could be dangerous.”</p><p>“So was everything we did in the last twenty-four hours.” Harry chuckled.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes again even as she followed behind him. The light flared brighter as Hermione drew closer. She frowned. This thing only seemed to respond to her getting closer, she thought she could almost feel a tugging to move nearer still. The pair froze, each realizing the same thing only a few steps away from the light.</p><p>“It’s reacting to you, Hermione,” he noted, glancing at her. “Move a little closer.”</p><p>“Harry,” she said, sighing. Why were they always having to mess with things they shouldn’t?</p><p>“You’ll be fine,” he assured her.</p><p>Hermione took two more steps toward it. Suddenly, she felt something pulling her forward, into the blinding light.</p><p>The last thing she heard was Harry screaming out her name in fear.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>June 6th, 1932－Steve, 14; Bucky, 15</p><p>Hermione felt like she had been falling for hours until she stopped, slamming into stone. She groaned, rolling over as she looked about, seeing nothing familiar. Turning her attention to herself, she could tell her arm was broken and cradled cradled it to her chest. Thoughts were running wild in her head. Where was she? What just happened? How could she get back home?<br/>
Her worried questions were cut short, however, when she heard someone speaking to her.</p><p>“My dear, are you alright?”</p><p>Hermione looked up seeing a woman with sandy blonde hair and bright blue eyes watching her in concern. She was dressed in an old-style nurse’s uniform. The woman’s accent threw her off. Unable to answer, a shake of her head was the only response she could muster at the time.</p><p>“Your arm looks broken,” the nurse said softly, trying not to scare the girl as she knelt down beside her. “I’m a nurse; my name is Sarah Rogers.”</p><p>“My name’s Hermione,” she whispered.</p><p>“That’s a beautiful name.” Sarah smiled. “Would you let me look at your arm?”</p><p>Hermione nodded. Sarah gently placed her hands on Hermione’s wrist, ever so slightly applying pressure. Hermione hissed from the pain.</p><p>“Just as I thought, it’s broken. Let’s take you around to the hospital and get this taken care of,” Sarah suggested holding out her hand to help Hermione stand. “Who are your parents?”</p><p>“They . . . aren’t alive,” Hermione said, choking up a bit. It wasn’t a complete lie. “I don’t know where I am, or how I got here.”</p><p>“Oh dear,” Sarah whispered, she didn’t understand the strange pull she had to this girl. “Well, the first thing we need to do is fix your arm.”</p><p>Just as she said, Mrs. Rogers took Hermione around to the hospital. The doctors fixed her broken limb, resetting her bone before placing a cast on her arm.</p><p>“According to the information you’ve given, you have no parents,” the doctor spoke coming into the room flipping through the paperwork. “Do you have any family you can think of?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, letting it drop slightly.</p><p>“All right, I will make a call to the orphanage to come－”</p><p>“I’ll take her,” Sarah spoke up, interrupting the doctor and shocking Hermione. She was aware of the medical precaution the man had been about to suggest. “I work at a tuberculosis ward and some of my patients are coming from there. I’ll take her.”</p><p>The doctor paused for a moment before scribbling on Hermione’s chart. “All right, one less thing for me to do. She’ll be in that for about six to eight weeks. Follow up with another doctor,” he concluded promptly, leaving the room before either could speak.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t let you end up at the orphanage.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mrs. Rogers,” Hermione replied softly. She was truly surprised by the woman’s kindness－ anyone taking in a child they had just met was a miracle.</p><p>“No need to thank me.” She smiled. “Well then, I suppose we’ll be heading home, now. You can meet my son . . . oh, I guess you can consider him your brother.”</p><p>Hermione simply nodded, a little overwhelmed.</p><p>“I know all this is a lot to take in, but you can talk to me. Whenever you need to, or whenever you're ready,” Sarah told her, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p><p>The walk to the Rogers’ home didn’t take long, but Hermione was once again lost in her thoughts. Her mind was still reeling from the information that she was somehow in New York City, and the year was 1932. She was certainly a long way from home. She thought she could possibly find The Magical Congress of the United States of America. That thought was quickly shut down when she remembered how closed off the American Wizarding world was. Who would believe an unidentifiable teenage girl, saying she was from 1994? Both the American Wizarding World and the Muggle world would have her locked in an asylum. Cut off from the Wizarding world, there was no way she could contact Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>She only had one option.</p><p>Keep silent and learn this new world she was in. Maybe she could find a way to return home one day.</p><p>“Where are you from?” Sarah asked as they walked down the street.</p><p>“I’m from Cambridge, England,” Hermione replied. “I guess you can tell from my accent.”</p><p>“Yes.” Sarah nodded with a smile. “That and you are dressed rather strangely.”</p><p>Hermione looked down at herself, seeing her clothes were still a mess from her adventures with Harry.</p><p>“Not that there’s anything wrong with them, they’re just different than what I’ve seen,” Sarah assured her quickly. “I have some clothes at home I can give you that might fit. They belonged to my younger sister, she passed away some time ago. I just never had the heart to get rid of them. I guess I know why now.”</p><p>Hermione simply nodded. She couldn’t find it in her to offer condolences or to puzzle aloud over the apparent feeling of connection between herself and this woman.</p><p>“Here we are.” Sarah pointed, turning up the sidewalk to the house.</p><p>Opening the front door, she let Hermione inside. “I can hear the boys aren’t here since it doesn’t sound like the house is coming down.”</p><p>Hermione chuckled before feeling a sharp pain. Sarah’s words reminded her that she had no idea when she’d see Harry and Ron again, if ever.</p><p>“Let’s get you washed up and in some clean clothes,” Sarah said walking to her bedroom. She grabbed a suitcase from her closet and stepped back out, opening a door next to her room.</p><p>“This can be your room, there’s a bed and a cabinet for your clothes, well, once I can get you some more. The bathroom is the next door over.” She spoke as she placed the suitcase on the bed. Pulling out the clothes, Sarah began putting them away for Hermione. She grabbed a nightgown and it to Hermione. “Try very hard not to get your cast wet.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, taking the clothes from Sarah’s hands. The woman started out of the room to get the bath set up for her.</p><p>“If you need anything, call out for me.” Sarah smiled at the witch before closing the bathroom door, once again leaving Hermione to her own thoughts.</p><p> Sarah walked into the small kitchen, she could hear her son and his best friend coming inside the house. He was laughing loudly over a joke Bucky must’ve just finished telling.</p><p>“Hi, Mom,” Steve said, smiling at his mother.</p><p>“Hey, Mrs. Rogers.” Bucky smiled, too, taking a seat at the kitchen table.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Steve paused, forgetting his first question as he heard something from down the hall. “Who’s here?”</p><p>“I . . . found a girl today, badly hurt in an alleyway as I was coming home from the TB ward. She had a broken arm and some small cuts, so I took her to the hospital for an emergency examination.”</p><p>“Is that who’s here?” Steve asked, glancing in the direction of the sound.</p><p>“Yes. She has no parents, and the doctor was going to just ship her off to the orphanage. I told him that would be unnecessary because I would take her. I saw to it that he switched her name on her paperwork to Rogers. She will be living with us. I can’t really explain why I did it, I just couldn’t let her end up there.”</p><p>“No, she’s family now,” Steve said, proud his mother always followed her heart like this. “She has a mother and a brother. We can be there for her.”</p><p>“I’m here too,” Bucky tacked on, smiling.</p><p>Before anyone could say anything else, they heard the bathroom door open. Sarah turned around to see Hermione slowly walking down the hall. Her eyes were red from crying, but no one mentioned it.</p><p>“Hermione, how are you feeling?” Sarah asked gently.</p><p>Hermione forced a smile. “I’ll be all right.”</p><p>“Hermione, this is my son Steve.” Sarah turned, beginning introductions. “As I said earlier, you can think of him as your brother. Steve, this is Hermione.”</p><p>“Hello, Hermione.” Steve held out his hand to the girl.</p><p>“Hello, Steve,” Hermione replied shaking his hand. Hermione didn’t understand but she felt at ease in his presence. The boy stood only as tall as she did and had a scrawny build. His sandy blonde hair was combed neatly to the side, showing off ocean-colored eyes. “It’s a pleasure.”</p><p>“Where are you from?”</p><p>Hermione looked toward the voice, seeing the young man seated at the table. He had short dark brown hair, his ice-blue eyes watched her curiously. The way he lounged in there made him seem a bit cocky, yet somehow she got the impression he was friendly, too.</p><p>“England,” Hermione responded.</p><p>“Thought so.” He smiled.</p><p>“Then why did you ask?” Hermione was slightly confused.</p><p>“I wanted to be sure.”</p><p>Steve rolled his eyes at his best friend’s antics, “Hermione, this is my best friend, James Barnes.”</p><p>“Call me Bucky.” He smiled.</p><p>“I’ll try.” Hermione chuckled softly, as did the others breaking the tension in the room.</p><p>“Well if you want to stay Bucky, then you three just sit at the table and get acquainted while I get some supper started,” Sarah told them happily before going crossing the kitchen to prepare the food.<br/>
Sarah listened to the conversation between the boys and Hermione. She hoped over time that they would be able to truly be a family, Bucky included－she thought of him as one of her own children. Supper came and went, and Bucky left the family to head back home.</p><p>That night Hermione lay in her new bed trying with everything she had to make herself fall asleep. Her mind wouldn’t stop racing. How was she going to cope with living in this time?</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The first few months were the hardest adjustment for Hermione. She was always polite to the Rogers after taking her in, but she was deeply depressed. Steve and Sarah were always as kind as possible. Her father had always been fascinated with the 1930s, that certainly helped her. She was familiar with some of the music and knew a bit about the time period. Being in a completely different country was still throwing her and she was eager to learn everything she could.<br/>
Sitting on the porch swing, Hermione was drawn in by the book she was reading. She wasn’t even aware of Steve coming toward her until he set down beside her.</p><p>“Hello, Steve,” she said, glancing up to meet his eyes.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing?” Steve asked.</p><p>Hermione responded, wiggling the book in her hands, “Reading.”</p><p>“I can see that.” He smirked. “I guess I should’ve asked ‘what you are reading?’”</p><p>“The Great Gatsby,” she said as she closed the book. “Actually, I just finished it. Your Mom had a copy of the book.”</p><p>“I guess you’ll be starting another one soon,” he commented beginning to swing back and forth. She frowned slightly at his words. “I don’t mean anything by it, I just noticed you like to read a lot.”</p><p>“I do,” Hermione replied. “I love reading. I’ve been called a bookworm, always having my nose in one. Didn’t matter what it was. Shakespeare, school textbook, anything I could get my hands on.”</p><p>“School must have been your favorite thing to do.” He chuckled softly before seeing a sad expression crossed her face. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything. I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p><p>“No, you’re all right, Steve,” she whispered. “It’s not your fault my world was turned upside down. My past and my parents being gone. It’s just . . . hard to talk about.”</p><p>“You don’t have to. I don’t want to pressure you about anything or try and make you talk, but if you need to, I am here for you,” Steve assured her. “And it’s okay to not be okay.”</p><p>“Thank you, Steve.”</p><p>“Come with me,” he told her hopping up from the swing.</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>“Surprise.” He grinned.</p><p>“Okay.” Hermione agreed, putting the book back in the house before following him. Walking a few blocks, they said nothing until Steve come to a stop in front of a building.</p><p>“I hope this can help you smile,” Steve told her, pointing to the sign on the doors.</p><p>“A library?” Hermione glanced at him.</p><p>“You like books and the library has them all.” Steve smiled. “I don’t know much about you, Hermione, but I’d like to. I want to get to know you.”</p><p>“Can we go in?” Hermione asked looking away.</p><p>“Yeah,” Steve said, his sympathy for her terrible situation helping to take the sting out of her brushoff.</p><p>Steve observed while Hermione perused the books. She looked through them all, handling each one with perfect care. She leaned toward more history-oriented books and science. As he watched, she began selecting the books she wanted to check out and bring home. Although after seeing the number of books she had chosen, he was second-guessing his choice to bring her to the library now.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re going to finish all of these before they’re due back?” he asked, carrying half of the load for her.</p><p>“I doubt these will last half that time,” Hermione replied. Meeting Steve’s gaze, she wore a genuine smile as they turned the block, walking back up on the porch of the house. “What? Do I have something on my face?” she asked, startled the look on Steve’s</p><p>“No, it’s just the first real smile I have seen on it.” Steve smiled back.</p><p>“And it’s about time, too.”</p><p>The pair turned around to see Bucky sitting on the swing waiting for them.</p><p>“I thought I was going to have to resort to drastic measures to see a smile on your face.” Bucky grinned as he stood and walked over to them.</p><p>“Buck! I’m happy to see you,” Steve said, excited.</p><p>Bucky frowned in suspicion. “Why?”</p><p>“So, you can hold these while I open the door,” Steve replied dropping Hermione’s stack of books into Bucky’s arms. He grunted from the weight of them, looking from the books to Hermione.</p><p>“Why do you and Steve need this many books?” Bucky asked in utter confusion.</p><p>“Not Steve and I, just me,” Hermione replied walking into the house.</p><p>“How can you read this much?” Bucky demanded following them in the house. “It’s unnatural and . . . unamerican.”</p><p>“Buck, she’s from England,” Steve smirked, putting his keys on the hook.</p><p>“Oh…right…Umm, where do you want these?” Bucky asked sheepishly.</p><p>“The table is fine.” Hermione motioned before smiling at him. “Thank you, James.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Bucky replied with a smile, not even correcting her on his name.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p align="center">September 1936－Hermione, 17; Steve, 17; Bucky, 18</p><p>“Morning you two.” Bucky smiled, waving to them as they approached the school building.</p><p>“Morning James.”</p><p>“Morning Buck.”</p><p>“Happy Birthday Mi,” Bucky said wrapping her in a hug, kissing her head. Hermione couldn’t help the blush creeping on her face, just like she couldn’t help the schoolgirl crush she had on Steve’s best friend. She glared as she noticed the smirk on her brother's face. She was surprised by James pulling a small white box from his pocket. He took her books from her allowing her to open her gift.</p><p>“James, you didn’t have to get me anything,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“I wanted too,” Bucky replied, watching her.</p><p>Hermione beamed. Sliding open the box, she let her smile drop slightly at the sight of a 1918 bronze British penny. Taking it between her fingers, she plucked it up from the box. Attached to the coin was a matched bronze chain.</p><p>“James,” Hermione whispered looking up into his eyes. “How did you get this?”</p><p>“My dad was in the war, he has a lot of different coins from different places. I saw this one, it’s from Britain and has your birth year. I made a necklace out of it. Do you like it?”</p><p>“I love it, James.” Hermione smiled taking the necklace from the box completely, she clasped it around her neck. “This means a lot to me. Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Bucky replied. “Looks good on you.”</p><p>“I’m still here.” Steve finally spoke up looking between the two.</p><p>“We can’t forget you, Steve,” Hermione said in a teasing tone as the school's bell rang. “Sorry I have to go.”</p><p>“See you at home Hermione.”</p><p>“No surprises Steve,” Hermione said sternly walking backward to the doors. “Go home and rest. I know you don’t feel well today.”</p><p>Steve shook his head chuckling.</p><p>“So why aren’t you at school today?” Bucky asked when she was out of earshot.</p><p>“Hermione’s birthday,” Steve replied. “Mom’s making cake and everything.”</p><p>Bucky laughed. “She’s gonna kill you.”</p><p>Bucky and Steve stopped laughing as they noticed three boys walking toward Hermione. They ran into her purposely knocking her books to the ground.</p><p>“Watch where you’re walkin’.”</p><p>“I was, Garrick. You ran into me,” Hermione snarled, snatching her books up from the ground.</p><p>“I didn’t, you were just in my way.” He laughed out loud.</p><p>Hermione grimaced at the boy in front of her. “You’re disgusting.”</p><p>“What did you say to me?” Garrick hissed, standing taller.</p><p>“That you’re a disgusting piece of crap,” Steve answered as he reached them. “Should we say it louder or slower for you?”</p><p>“Probably both,” Hermione added raising a brow.</p><p>Bucky slid in between Hermione and Garrick, blocking her from him. “I would suggest you back away now. I won’t say it again,” Bucky spoke calmly, before grabbing him and pulling him closer. “If I find out you messed with her again, even if I am not around, I’ll break your damn legs. Now go.”</p><p>Bucky shoved the guy away into his friends glaring at them as the group scurried off.</p><p>“Hey, you okay?” Steve asked Hermione.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Hermione assured them. “Trust me, it takes more than the likes of them to scare me.”</p><p>“If they even breathe at you wrong, you tell me,” Bucky said, turning around to grab her books for her.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione replied, once more walking toward the school doors. “But I’m not scared of school bullies.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p align="center">October 1936</p><p>Hermione held close to Steve. Both their hearts were aching today, but she could only imagine what type of pain he was in. They sat at the funeral service of their mother, Sarah Rogers. The woman who’d taken her in and shown her such warmth and kindness had contracted Tuberculosis from the ward where she worked; she simply couldn’t fight the illness. Losing her like this hurt them both.</p><p>“And now, a few words from her son.”</p><p>Hermione squeezed Steve’s hand before he went up to speak for their mother. She felt the tears roll down her face, she rarely cried but when she did, she was in the most pain. She felt Bucky’s arms wrap around her shoulders to pull her against him. He just held her as Steve began to speak.</p><p>“For those here who do not know me, my name is Steve. I’m Sarah’s son and her daughter Hermione is sitting in the front row. Writing this eulogy to our mom was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it was very important to me say some words to honor our mother. Mom was a very patient and kind-hearted woman. She cared greatly for every soul she could. It was so important to her that everyone around her was happy and loved. I believe that’s why mom became a nurse and impacted the lives of thousands of people no matter how small. Always wanting to help and be present when she could, even while raising me and selflessly adopted my sister. Hermione, she loved you just as much as she loved me. She told me you are a Rogers in every way except blood. I will always thank our mother for bringing you into my life, for bringing us both happiness; even now that she’s gone, we have each other thanks to her. There was a lot of love in my mom’s life. Even though she’s gone now, I know that her legacy will live on in all of us. She was an incredible nurse, wife, and mother, who inspired everyone who knew her. Mom, you’re in our hearts forever.” After he finished speaking, Steve stepped down from the podium and walked back across the church.<br/>
The services at the grave were quick. Neither Steve nor Hermione wanted to drag the day out any longer than necessary. Hurting and drained, they only wanted to go home. Bucky stayed with them until they both made it to the house.</p><p>“I think I am going to lie down for a while,” Hermione said as they come to a stop on the porch. She gave Bucky a hug before going inside.</p><p>Leaving the pair to talk alone outside, Hermione changed before going to lay on the sofa in the living room. This was the first time in a long time she hadn’t pulled out a book to read. She just lay there, until Steve stepped into the house.</p><p>“I asked Bucky to let us be alone for a while,” Steve told her closing the door. “Are you hungry?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head.</p><p>Steve sat on the edge of the sofa, settling next to her. “I don’t think I am either.”</p><p>They spent the rest of the night side by side just like that, silently keeping one another company. Better to mourn together than alone.</p>
