    <p align="center">We (mother, Anne and myself) were out for a ride. I was riding Romeo - a sleek, glossy black stallion. Anne was riding a petite speckled white Shetland. Mother was riding King George VI. He was a handsome chestnut stallion, who was very mild, steady, and rarely spooked. A black speck appeared in the sky. It got larger as it approached. I thought it was Hunter (my golden eagle) back from hunting. When it got nearer I realised that it was a handsome tawny owl, with a letter tied to its feet. It swooped towards me, legs outstretched, so I caught it on my forearm. It stuck out its foot for me to take the letter. I opened it.</p>

<p align="center">We were shocked. Mother wrote a reply and sent back on the same owl. I pulled out the list to have a look at it.</p>

<p align="center">I was gutted that I couldn't bring any of my dogs. I showed the list to mother, who told me that the person would be coming at 4, when we had picked up Edward from his tutor. When that time rolled around, mother and I waited in the grand entrance hall, dressed in all our finery. Anne was playing with Edward in the playroom, while Andrew was practicing piano in the music room. Suddenly, the doorbell rang out. It was a bell hanging in the rafters of the entrance hall that you rang by pulling the rope next to the door. It could be heard across the whole of the ground floor. The person was exactly on time. I knew this would make a good impression on mother. The butler opened the door and showed her to where we were standing, examining the family tree, which had been painted on the back wall. She introduced herself as Professor McGonagall, the Deputy Headmistress. I recognised her name from the letter. When mother saw her, she called father in. He walked in from the dining room. He was also dressed up smartly, in his navy uniform. He headed over to where mother was talking quietly to the Professor. Mother introduced him as Prince Philip. The poor woman looked quite overwhelmed at being in Buckingham Palace. Finally, I was introduced, and we all headed through to the sitting room. Professor McGonagall explained loads of stuff, before offering to take us to Diagon Alley. Mother politely declined, and said that we could manage by ourselves. We then all walked out the front door. Professor McGonagall walked off in the direction of Trafalgar Square, while the three of us stepped into our silver Rolls-Royce. Our chauffeur climbed in to the front, and we set off for Charing Cross. The journey was uneventful.<br/> We reached Charing Cross and disembarked from our car. The chauffeur then went to park the car, expressing his desire to do visit a bank in town. I stared across the street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to it - a grubby little pub bearing the name 'The Leaky Cauldron'. I got the impression that the ordinary people around me couldn't see it at all. Why else would they have a name so blatantly magical? I pointed it out to mother and father, who then led me into it. We did as Professor McGonagall said, and asked the innkeeper (Tom) to open the gateway for us. The alley itself was spectacular, with bursts of colour at every turn. I barely knew where to look. My father, though, had no such qualms, and strode confidently up the steps to the great marble bank. Mother and I hurriedly caught up to him. Upon a second set of doors, a poem was inscribed:</p>
<p align="center"><em>Enter, stranger, but take heed,</em><br/> <em>Of what awaits the sin of greed.</em><br/> <em>For those who take, but do not earn,</em><br/> <em>Must pay most dearly in their turn.</em><br/> <em>So if you seek beneath our floors</em><br/> <em>A treasure that was never yours,</em><br/> <em>Thief, you have been warned, beware,</em><br/> <em>Of finding more than treasure there.</em></p>
<p align="center">Father smirked, his lips curving, "That's a challenge". The doors swung open, revealing a long hall lined with goblins, all weighing out various gems. Some of the rubies looked to be the size of a man's fist. We approached the only goblin which wasn't currently occupied. It seemed rather aggressive. I shrank backwards slightly, into mother's warm embrace.</p>
<p align="center">"We would like an inheritance test done, please, good sir." My father's voice was the perfect blend of respect and authority.</p>
<p align="center">I was surprised; it was as if he had encountered goblins before. The goblin, it seemed, was also surprised, and immediately assumed a more friendly (if you could even call it that) expression.</p>
<p align="center">"Come this way."</p>
<p align="center">We all followed after him. I willingly held out my hand to be sliced open. The blood splattered into the potion below, and the goblin placed a roll of specially prepared parchment into the bowl. We all watched, with bated breath, as the potion took hold. Upon the parchment, words began to appear</p>

<p align="center">Oh my god. How many houses did I have? And all those vaults; I must be crazy rich!</p>
<p align="center">"Here are your keys." The goblin slid a drawstring pouch across his desk.</p>
<p align="center">There were so many of them. I hoped I wouldn't lose one, those teeth looked lethal.</p>
