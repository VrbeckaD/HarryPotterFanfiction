  <span>Hermione looked over at Harry and then back at Malfoy who was standing near her hospital bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you certain Harry?” Hermione asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes Hermione, I’m certain. I wouldn’t lie to you about this” Harry said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, he’s...Malfoy. I mean, are you sure I really married him?” Hermione asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes you did, and you’re a Malfoy too. You hyphenated it” Draco said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must have hated that” Hermoine said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn't, I would have taken your name” Draco said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh that’s a good one. Oh Harry you almost had me” Hermione said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, please try to understand. You were in an accident. It caused some brain injury. You can’t remember a lot of things. You thought we were 3rd year, and we just saved Buckbeak” Harry said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We were, that’s the last memory I have” Hermione said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes and you woke up saying I looked old, you’re old! We’re 10 years older now!” Harry said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well this is a shock to me! You’ve grown so much, I almost didn’t recognize you” Hermione said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes wandered over to Draco. The last she had seen him he was crying about how Buckbeak hurt him. He certainly filled out...rather nicely too. Apparently quidditch was good for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can ogle me later at home” Draco said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Home? I’m not going anywhere with you!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter, talk to her” Draco said as he walked out of the room</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rubbed a hand over his face. He took his glasses off and wiped them on his shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, he’s your husband. You married him of your own free will” Harry said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked down at her hand. She saw a small tattoo on her ring finger. She looked at the small designs on it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those are magical tattoos, you gave them to each other instead of rings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Malfoy doesn’t have one, I saw his hands”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, your magic is inside the tattoo that you gave him. Your accident, it injured you severely. You were dead for a minute before we could get you back. Your magic faded, and that's when Draco realized you had died.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I died?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, and then they brought you back, zapped you with electricity or something”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was dead”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you were dead, and when I saw it disappear off his finger, I knew...I knew something terrible had happened to you” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was unable to talk, his voice cracking, he hugged her again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright Harry, I’m here”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t understand, when I saw it fade, there was nothing I could do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here Harry, I’m here, see”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wiped his eyes and straightened himself up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think you’re in your third year, but you’re not. We defeated Voldermort, we found all the horcruxes, we did it all. I wish you could remember it”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then tell me”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will, but you should trust Malfoy. He does love you”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s Malfoy”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just give him a chance please”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco walked into the room. Hermione was reading a book when he walked in. She looked up at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello” Hermione said</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello” Draco said as he approached slowly</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I only remember up to 3rd year apparently”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Apparently. Though it seems deliberate”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deliberate?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, 3rd year is when we started to see each other”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean date?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, we saw each other, we were too young to know what we were doing. We wouldn’t really date until later. Not until I saw you at the Yule Ball in that dress. You were so beautiful and on the arm of Krum.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quidditch player”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would never date a quidditch player”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did, you said you couldn’t understand him half the time, but he was very good with his mouth in other ways”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione blushed and looked down. Draco realized that she was acting like a 13 year old girl still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We dated after, we had to keep it a secret because of the rise of the dark lord. You went with Potter to find those bloody horcruxes and I was left trapped in my manor with a madman. But Potter won, and now we’re here”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did we, have we ever…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ever what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kissed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have we gone farther than that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, we’re married”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione blushed more and looked down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said your first kiss was with Viktor”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should meet Viktor, as I can’t remember him”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t have him stealing your first kiss again”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco leaned closer to her and kissed her quickly on the lips. Hermione turned red with embarrassment and looked away. She felt incredibly warm. Her hands wanted to reach out to him, to touch him. But she didn’t know why. She looked up at Draco who extended his hand out to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shall we go home?” Draco asked</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione placed her hand in his without hesitating. </span>
