  <em>"That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally..."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>the bell rang and we ran out of class<br/>"and I thought nothing could be worst than history of magic!" I moaned <br/>lily crossed his eyebrows and said:"come on divination is not that bad!"<br/>I copied Trealways voice and said:"oh darlings i am here to waste your time with divination"<br/>the boys joined us and James gave lily a little kiss. Sirius rolled his eyes and said:"why don't we leave this love birds alone so they could have sex"   <br/>lily tried to slap Sirius but he was way faster than her.<br/>"come on you don't have to kiss each other after every single lesson!" I argued<br/> "well no one is single as you are Meadows " i heard someone saying with a nasty laugh. I turned around and saw Bellatrix black coming closer with a bunch of other slytherins. She was a ridiculous girl whose been annoying us since our very first day, and here she was still burning me on my last year in hogwarts.<br/>"and no-one is as intruder as you are "I slapped<br/>"bet the poor guy's hand would stuck in that bush on the top of your head" she said with a evil smile<br/>i touched my curly hair and burned with anger, everybody knew my hair was my pressure point. <br/>"get out of the way black!"lily said<br/>Sirius muttered:"guys you better inform which black you are talking to I'm not that smart"<br/>Bellatrix said:"oh is the the tomato head talking to me?" <br/>James couldn't hold himself anymore he took his wand out and point it warningly toward Bellatrix face, she took out her wand quickly as she saw james hand moving toward his robe and did the same thing. although i hated her i couldn't resist the point that she was talented and smart. <br/>remus moved his hands slowly toward his wand as he looked at them warningly.<br/>"don't make me do anything black"james muttered<br/>"scared aren't you potter?"Bellatrix answered<br/>"try me"<br/>" Confri...."<br/>" Stupefy " remus screamed<br/>Bellatrix was thrown backwards and we all started throwing spells. Peter was basically wetting himself while blocking the spells. I shouted:" Incarcerous " and it hit Evan Rosier in the face. Padfoot was yelling at them saying :" you are already dead bitchy bithes!"<br/>we were so busy fighting them none of us saw professor Mcgonagall until she screamed: WHAT ARE YOU DOING!<br/>everybody froze.<br/>Remus muttered: "shall we run?"<br/>"heck yeah"I answered<br/>"3,2,1 GO!" Padfoot said as we all ran for our lives towards the common room.<br/>"YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE MR BLACK! 20 POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>************************</p><p>on their first day at Hogwarts Dorcas slapped James as he and Sirius were bulling severus snape and that was the first reason Lily became bestfriends with her.<br/>in end of the fifth year James finally had the chance to go out with lily.<br/>at the sixth year Sirius punched lucius Malfoy in the face for calling Dorcas mud-blood.<br/>and here they were in their last year walking in Hogwarts like they own it.</p>
