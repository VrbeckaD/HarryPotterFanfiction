<p>Tom looked at her, his eyes narrowed. "He can't."</p>
<p>"He's suspicious," Hermione shared. "Harry knows I'm hiding something."</p>
<p>"If Potter knows you're going to betray him, then our planning will have been for nought," Tom hissed angrily.  His hands were clenched into fists.</p>
<p>"I know," Hermione said, wishing she had shared her fears. "I've been careful, my Lord." </p>
<p>Tom moved closer to her, cupping her cheek. He stroked her face lovingly for a moment before his grip tightened. "Potter must not know what we're planning… You know what is at stake if he figures it out."</p>
<p>"I won't fail you, Tom… I swear." She looked at him pleadingly. </p>
<p>His hand moved to her neck, teasing her collarbone. "I know you won't." </p>
<p>She looked up at him, her tongue darting out to wet her lips. "May I-"</p>
<p>"Return to Hogwarts," Tom said curtly, pulling away from her.</p>
<p>She mourned the loss of his touch. </p>
<p>"Spend time with Potter and Weasley, put any doubts they have to rest." </p>
<p>Hermione nodded. </p>
<p> "I'll Summon you when it's time."</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord." She looked at him longingly before Disapparating away.</p></div>
