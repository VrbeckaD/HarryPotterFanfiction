          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Pass the fucking jug, Blaise," Draco said. "The rest of the house need to drink some coffee too, you know. And it's not yours."<br/>"Tough luck, mate," Blaise snapped. "Besides, <em>Draco</em>, you absolute dunce, the jugs refill themselves. So, for this morning, this lovely jug here is mine. Now fuck off." He put a large hand on it, preventing Pansy from snatching it away. She pouted, picking up her fork and spearing it into her bacon with a sigh. Draco snickered.<br/>"You know, boys, this really isn't dignified behavior. I thought we were supposed to be role models," she muttered, before her eyes lit up with the remembrance of some juicy gossip. "Besides, did you two hear? Potter's gay!"<br/>"<em>What?</em>" Draco and Blaise asked in unison, whirling around in their seats to look at the smirking girl.<br/>"You're kidding, Pans," Blaise said, shaking his head. "What about the Weaselette? If she's single, I'm bagging her."<br/>Pansy shrugged. "You do that, I don't give a shit. Draco, what are you fucking <em>doing</em>?"<br/>Draco was already walking over to the Gryffindor table. With a roll of his eyes, Blaise refilled his cup and sighed.<br/>"Well, he always did have a crush on the Potty. Although I sincerely hope that isn't either of their kinks."<br/>Pansy gagged into her eggs.</p></div>
