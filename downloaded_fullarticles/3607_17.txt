    <p>Draco prefers things to be just so.</p><p>His flat is spotlessly clean, starting with the bedroom. His clothes are folded neatly in their drawers, side by side. His bed is always made. Every dust bunny that even thought of existing fears for its life in Draco’s domain.</p><p>His kitchen is pristine. The metal of the stovetop gleams and his counters look new. Every pot and pan hangs in its place. His china, a family heirloom, stands proudly in a display case, never touched. His silverware lies in neat rows in their dark homes. Sometimes it takes him many tries to stack them up just so.</p><p>His living room is lovely. The books on his ever expanding bookshelf are lined up, occasionally by height, occasionally by color, and occasionally by alphabetical order based on author and then genre—it depends on how wild Draco feels that day. He does his organizing by hand. It seems more satisfying when he gets it right, that way. He so rarely gets things right these days.</p><p>Draco tried to garden once, he really did: His mother kept telling him how soothing it was. But he found that when he started to pull weeds, he couldn’t stop—everything looked like a weed, or like it could have been one. When he tried to prune away wilted leaves and withered petals, Draco found himself taking one off that looked somewhat shriveled, and why not the one next to it, too? Certainly that was about to go to. And the one next to it, perhaps. And the next one.</p><p>And the next one.</p><p>And the next.</p><p>Draco is not good at gardening. But it matters little to him, because he doesn’t like dirt anyway, and it takes far too much patience to garden. He has settled for the few small cacti which appear throughout his flat, and he likes them—he finds them fitting.</p><p>Draco himself is always put together, naturally. His hair is always perfectly combed. His shoes are always shined. His nails are always done. He never bites his nails, but sometimes, when he’s anxious, he picks at his cuticles and the skin around them until he bleeds. The tips of his pointer fingers and thumbs are often pink from new flesh and old scar tissue.</p><p>Draco would never say he has a problem, because being conscientious is not a problem, and organization never causes issues. But he can admit—albeit with reluctance—that he periodically gets sidetracked counting the change he keeps in a small jar atop his bookshelf, trying to reach a certain number of Knuts and Sickles. At times he gets distracted with how his quills are arranged in the mug on his desk. Once in a while, the alignment of the floorboards of his flat in relation to the wall and their slightly unmatched angle deeply disturbs him.</p><p>Sometimes, there is an unruly hair on one of Draco’s eyebrows that he cannot seem to conquer, so he rips half of them out.  But it’s fine, because he can regrow them. And until then, he can Glamour it perfect. Sometimes, he wonders why he doesn’t simply Glamour himself permanently—but that wouldn’t be realistic, magically speaking. Draco knows this. But it’s difficult.</p><p>It’s especially difficult when Draco catches sight of his left forearm. He rarely wears short sleeves anymore.</p><p>Sometimes Draco feels breathless, like a malignant entity has just discovered him and has decided his chest would make a wonderful place to throw itself down. During these times, nothing is ever put to right. Everything is too unwieldy, too unruly, too loud and fast and powerful for him to control. It is these times that Draco stacks, or aligns, or folds or shines or counts or counts or picks or picks or picks or picks until his fingers are bleeding and there is a raw, bloody patch running all the way down to his first knuckle that he can’t remember making.</p><p>Sometimes he feels totally isolated in this flurry of disaster, and that pushes all the wind out of him even easier than his little demon does.</p><p>But sometimes, he has help.</p><p>And sometimes, when it does, it comes to him in the form of Harry Potter.</p>
