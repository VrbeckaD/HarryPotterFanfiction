    <p> </p><p>Bella was bored. She was sitting in the gallery above the castle courtyard, in the honorary seat of the school beneficiaries, watching the seventh years' graduation ceremony form above. The day was particularly hot. The cool stone walls that surrounded the courtyard couldn't shield it from the bright sun, and the graduating students were sweating in their dress- robes. Behind them, the other students and the families were no better off, even though most of them had taken off their robes and rolled up their sleeves.</p><p>In the gallery the shade was very pleasant, but still too hot. To Bella's right, her sister Narcissa was watching the stage with a pair of delicate spectacles that zoomed in and out to follow every movement of the speaker. With her other hand she waved a stylish lace fan to cool her face, her silver-blond hair pulled behind her shoulders to reveal her soft white neck. To her left, her Aunt Walburga appeared very uncomfortable in the thick black robe she had chosen to wear, too proud to fold up her sleeves or loosen her collar. Her humorless face was shiny with sweat, ruining her obvious attempt to obscure the signs of aging from her skin.</p><p>Bella, on the other hand, wasn't going to get all sweaty. She had removed her stockings, lifted her dress up to her thighs, rolled up her sleeves and opened the first two buttons of her robe. She pulled up her elbow- length black hair, which was full and wild, to a loose bun to cool her neck. Then she sat comfortably, swinging one shoe on her toes as she tried not to doze. The head of the School Board had been talking forever, or so it seemed. She was aware of the reprimanding looks her aunt and uncle were giving her, and the resenting eye- rolls that her sister's haughty fiancee, Lucius Malfoy, wasn't trying to hide, but she couldn't think of anything that would interest her less at that moment. The only reason she was there was because she had promised her parents to take upon herself some of the family duties, now that she was to be married. Going to Hogwarts beneficiaries events seemed to be the lesser evil of many tiresome duties, and also – she know it would give her a chance to talk to Sirius.</p><p>The head of the School Board finally finished his tedious speech and descended from the stand, wiping his face vigorously. He was followed by the school Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>Unlike any normative person, the old wizard didn't seem to suffering from the heat. On the contrary – he looked remarkably cheerful in his thick velvet cloak, and his long white beard seemed airy and not burdensome at all.</p><p>"Dear students, teachers, and parents," he began, and everyone listened eagerly. Bella studied the edges of a stubborn black curl. "The wonderful class that stands here before you is, as you have already heard from our dear head of the School Board, the two- hundred- and- thirteenth class to graduate from Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Many great qualities have been attributed to these exceptional boys and girls, in the class that is considered to be one of the best that Hogwarts had seen in many year. That said, the parting gift I wish to give you, my dear children, is a warning."</p><p>The old Headmaster surveyed the graduating seventh- years gravely over his glasses; A look that was nevertheless full of worry, and of love soaked in sadness. A shadow seemed to fall over the crowd under the blazing sun.</p><p>"The world which you are entering is a beautiful world, full of opportunities and possibilities. However, there are also many dangers, especially in the dark days of our present. The shadow of Voldemort's dark intentions hangs above us all."</p><p>A wave of discontent passed through the crowd at the name. Bella shivered uncontrollably in the hot air, her interest in the speech growing at the mention of the Dark Lord.</p><p>"Some of you will stand firm against this darkness, out of a pure desire to make the world we live in a better place. Others will decide not to chose a side. And the rest – the rest will stand by this tyrant and support his evil plans..." Next to Bellatrix, Aunt Walburga was nodding to herself as she listened to the speech intently, a crease forming between her brows. "Whatever side you my choose, my children, do not forget the lessons you have learned here, at Hogwarts. Do not forget that anyone who was born with the gift of magic has the right to use it for good. And always remember that all of you were once children, small and uncertain, when you first crossed the lake and entered this castle together. You were all innocent, sweet and carefree once. My advice to you, before you spread your wings and leave this place that has been your home in the past seven years, is this – remember that all people are born equal, and are equal again as they face death. Thank you, and good luck."</p><p>After the speech, which was too emotional to Bella's taste, the seventh years were called one by one to the stage in order to receive their Trained Wizard Certificate. Bella recognized almost every Slytherin who came on to the stage from her school days, or from social gatherings she would sometimes attend. She recognized Avery, who smiled at all the teachers with an almost threatening personal charm as he shook their hands, and also Amycus Carrow and his ugly twin sister Alecto, who went up to the stage one after the other.</p><p>One of the last Slytherins to come up to get his certificate was Severus Snape, who walked up with almost no applause. He he shook the teachers' hands quickly, as if to complete an unpleasant duty, and descended awkwardly with his greasy hair falling over his grim, unpleasant face, holding the certificate as if it were his most precious possession.</p><p>Bella also recognized one Ravenclaw, Barty Crouch, whose father was sitting in front of her in the gallery. He was busy writing an urgent message to the Ministry of Magic while his son was receiving his diploma. If he and only known where she had seen Barty Crouch Jr, and what people he had befriended while he was busy becoming the new Minister for Magic. Bella thought it was delightfully ironic.</p><p>Sirius was one of the first Gryffindors' to go on stage. Bella's cousin won a loud round of applause from his classmates, and to a variety of bitter and disappointed looks from his parents. He gave all the teachers his famous smile, known for its almost magical abilities of enchantment, and most of them rewarded him with appreciating smiles and firm handshakes.</p><p>"Such a shame," Bella heard Malfoy mumble in her sister's ear. "If I had been related to him, I would have been ashamed to honor this traitor with my presence at his graduation ceremony, especially after he had been so disgracefully disowned last year..."</p><p>"It's funny you should day that. Soon he will actually be your relative, Lucius," Bella told him loudly. "It would be wonderful, don't you think? You could show him off to all your little friends."</p><p>Narcissa gave Bella a meaningful look. Her fiancee snorted in Bella's direction and returned to the ceremony, avoiding Walburga's sharp gaze.</p><p>What a perfect couple, Bella thought bitterly, this golden-haired pair. Their mother had decided that her youngest daughter would marry Malfoy the moment she had seen him, because she though they would have beautiful children. Recently Bella had realized why they seemed like such a good pair; Malfoy's unconcerned arrogance and extravagance came in stark contrast to her sister's submissive humility. A perfect match indeed.</p><p>The ceremony couldn't end sooner for Bella. As the last student left the stage, she was already on her way down the steps that lead to the courtyard. She moved gracefully in the crowd of Hogwarts graduates who streamed neatly between the seats toward the grounds, where the refreshments awaited, and noticed Sirius walking with his friends, the blood-traitors from Gryffindor. His step was graceful – almost feline – and made him stand out in the crowd of sweaty teenagers. Bella caught up with him and linked her arm with his, walking with him.</p><p>"What do <strong>you</strong> want?" He said, looking at her the way one would look at a repulsive disease. He tried to free himself from her grasp, but she pressed her arm to his side forcefully.</p><p>"Don't embarrass us in front of everyone, cousin," she purred in his ear, knowing he dreaded making a scene when it involved his family. "I just want to have a word with you."</p><p>Even if she wanted to, she couldn't have ignored the pleasant sensation of his firm arm close to her body. It was regrettable that a faulty creation such as Sirius was the most handsome, attractive and talented man born under the Black name. His black hair was pulled back from his forehead with natural grace, and sparkling beads of sweat gathered in the hollow of his neck. The top button of his robe was open, exposing a delicious patch of skin and a few black, masculine hair. Sometimes Bella was sorry he had come out of such a rotten apple, and her father had asked his sister to cancel their engagement.</p><p>"I don't want to hear what you have to say," he snarled like an angry puppy.</p><p>His regular companion, James Potter, glanced at them over his shoulder. Bella hated everything about him, from his long legs to his stupid spectacles.</p><p>"Keep on walking, Potter," she said in his direction. He opened his mouth to reply, but his redheaded girlfriend put a hand on his shoulder and he relaxed. Bellatrix was glad that she was at least good for something.</p><p>"Talk and go," Sirius said, not looking at her. "I have better things to do than to listen to you today..."</p><p>"Come to my wedding."</p><p>"Sorry, but if I wanted to waste a day with the people I hate most while everyone is looking for the bride, who had run off with the best man, I would've come to your first wedding."</p><p>"Really, Sirius, I was young then. The second wedding was a charm – " </p><p>"Yeah, before you humiliated the groom in front of all his friends and family, and then declared you wouldn't marry him because he's fat."</p><p>"I see news travel fast," Bella said contentedly. The group began to disperse, and she led her cousin away from his classmates. He let her lead him reluctantly. "But it will be different this time. Rodolphus is handsome and wealthy, and doesn't let anyone tell him what to do. When we first met he wanted to marry right away, even that his mother disapproved. He's the head of his family, you know? He has all the power... So will you come?"</p><p>"I'd rather spend the day throwing up slugs. And I pity the man who's stupid enough to marry you."</p><p>Sirius's friends were huddling away from them, giving them cautious looks – the kind that a herd of sheep would give a hungry wolf. Bella smiled sweetly at them, able to contain her bubbling anger only for a moment, before she leaned over to Sirius, sinking her nails hard into the front of his robe as she whispered in his ear.</p><p>"You allow yourself a lot of liberty, Sirius," she hissed, the humiliation of his words making her abandon the last bit of sympathy she had for him and give in to the wild, violent fury that ignited in her heart. "This is your last chance to redeem yourself. Come. Otherwise I'll have to crush you like the miserable little bug that you are..."</p><p>She saw his Adam's apple move as he swallowed. She could smell his attractive masculine scent mixed with a distant, intoxicating smell of fear. He was good at keeping his composure, but not good enough. They grew up together, after all – he knew what she was capable of when the burning white anger took over.</p><p>She let go of his robe. Yes, they could have been so good together, if he was only a little wiser. There were times she used to think their fates were bound forever, but now she knew she was meant for greatness, and he wasn't. He was just a toy.</p><p>"Think about it, cousin," she said before she kissed him on the cheek and walked away.</p><p>In three days the sun will shine on her wedding day, and then she will become Mrs. Bellatrix Lestrange, a young woman married to a powerful husband in a new world. The possibilities were endless.</p>
