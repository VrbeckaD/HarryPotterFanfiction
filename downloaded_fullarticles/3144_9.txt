    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Ginny was sitting at the kitchen table roughly buttering the piece of toast in her hand before sticking her knife in the jam jar and smearing it across the crunchy bread. She was fed up. It was another morning of waiting. One more morning after years of it shouldn't be hard, but this morning she wasn't taking it well. She'd been so sure when she'd woken up that today would be the day that the others would finally get their school supply lists from Hogwarts and they could finally go to Diagon Alley.</p><p>She'd gotten her owl over a month ago now asking them to confirm her place for the coming year, and she'd been so excited at the idea of getting her wand. But her mother had said they'd have to wait. There was no point making the trip to get her school supplies until the others knew what they needed too. So she waited.</p><p>The owls for older students always came in the first week of August. August had only started yesterday, but that hadn't stopped her from hoping that this year, this year they'd come early. Because this year was special. This year was the year she got to go to Hogwarts.</p><p>Every time an owl had arrived for about a week now, Ginny's hopes had soared. But either it had been Errol, which was normally obvious rather quickly as he crashed into the milk jug or even before that if he failed to get through the open window, a letter arriving for Percy from Hermes, or the Daily Prophet. Ginny spared a look over at her older brother, a scowl on her face. He was reading another mysterious letter, and that was the reason for her bad mood. An owl had appeared that morning as they'd all sat down for breakfast. Her mother had still been dishing up plates for the table as the five of them had sat down, her father had already been there reading yesterday's Daily Prophet, when the owl had arrived.</p><p>Ginny had nearly jumped out of her seat in excitement, but the dour looking bird had gone straight to Percy to drop the letter off before leaving again. Letters from Hogwarts always came in the morning. No supplies list at breakfast meant another day of waiting.</p><p>Across from her, Fred and George were whispering under their breaths about something or other, and Ginny would normally be trying to find out what, but today she just didn't care. She didn't care about anything right now as she shoved her toast around her plate, mopping up some gooey egg yolk. She just wanted her wand.</p><p>As soon as she'd thought the words, she heard a screech from outside and a beautiful looking barn owl swooped in the window. It was majestic, and Ginny couldn't think of a better owl to deliver official Hogwarts letters. It landed gracefully between Fred and George, and Ginny was certain this was it. Their supplies list had finally come.</p><p>She was just thinking of how to word her argument to convince her mum that they had to go to Diagon Alley today when Fred detached the single envelope from the bird's leg, pulling out an expensive looking piece of thick white card as the bird hopped up to perch on his shoulder.</p><p>The owl seemed to know the twins already, and a single piece of card was definitely not from Hogwarts. Ginny slumped in her chair, throwing the half eaten piece of toast back on her plate. Life was so unfair.</p><p>"We aren't doing anything on Wednesday, right, Mum?" George asked after muttering something to Fred. Ginny frowned, her interest peaking slightly.</p><p>"No, dear," was the reply. Their mum wasn't watching them, concerning herself with cleaning the breakfast away, but if she had been, she'd have seen the look the twins shared and been much more alert.</p><p>"So, it's fine if we go to a friend's house, then? This Wednesday," George said, making doubly sure.</p><p>Ginny saw the innocent look that crossed his face as their mum turned around. In her opinion, that was more of a dead giveaway that something was going on than when the twins looked guilty, but for whatever reason their mum didn't pick up on it.</p><p>Ron was also watching them now, though Percy was still engrossed in whatever letter he was rereading. Ginny had been trying to find out what all the serious letters had been about, but so far she'd had no luck, and right now there were more interesting things afoot.</p><p>"That'll be nice," their mum said, nodding. "So long as you behave yourselves. If I get any complaints-" She left the threat hanging as she picked up the empty food dishes from the table. "Ask if it's okay for you to floo to Lee's, won't you?"</p><p>The twins looked quickly at each other. "I know you always do, but best to check."</p><p>"Lee's in Europe," Fred blurted out, and Ginny felt the table bump as George kicked him.</p><p>"Well, whose house are you going to?" Ginny could hear the exasperation in her mother's voice, but there was mild amusement there too as she picked up the plate from in front of her husband. Their mum was in a good mood as usual, but Ginny was almost certain that it wasn't going to last long. It never did when the twins were planning something. Ron was thinking exactly the same thing; they'd both edged to the other side of their seats to get out of her firing line. So she was almost in Ron's lap when George spoke again.</p><p>"Sebastian Fitzroy," he said.</p><p>The sound of a plate smashing on the floor on one side of Ginny was matched only by Ron's shout of "WHAT?" from her other.</p><p>Both her father and Percy had looked up at the commotion, and Ginny wasn't sure where to settle her gaze. She knew the twins had made friends with a boy called Sebastian. They'd told her all about the Christmas prank they'd pulled and how he'd covered for them when McGonagall had arrived. They'd also told her about how he'd pranked them over the holidays, turning their hair bright pink. Ron had cut in and told her that he was horrible and pointed out that he'd been the boy they'd seen pushing in front of them at the platform barrier, which wasn't strictly true. She remembered complaining to Mum about not getting to go to Hogwarts and so the boy had gone on ahead while they were standing still. But what she also now remembered was the reaction Mum had had when she'd seen him.</p><p>"No," their mum said now.</p><p>"No, what?" Fred said. If he'd had any sense, he'd have kept his mouth shut.</p><p>"No, you are not going." Their mum's voice wavered, fighting to keep control.</p><p>"But you just said-"</p><p>"YOU ARE NOT GOING INTO THAT HOUSE!"</p><p>There was a beat of silence before everyone spoke at once.</p><p>"What house?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"What's wrong with his house?"</p><p>But their mum didn't look like answering any of them.</p><p>"Molly, dear-" It was the first thing their dad had said, and Ginny watched as their mum took a deep breath and turned away.</p><p>"Well," Percy cut in, speaking up for the first time. "I, for one, think fostering a relationship with a Fitzroy could only be in the interest-"</p><p>"Shut up!" Ginny's eyes went wide and everyone froze at their mum's scream.</p><p>Percy had tensed at the shout, he was never on the end of their mums anger, on the rare occasions she got this flustered it was always because the twins had done something really bad. Ginny didn't understand why their mum was so upset. But Percy wasn't taking it well. His shoulders were rigid, his long fingers picking up his letter carefully.</p><p>"Percy," the remorse in their mum's face was clear, " I'm sorry, dear."</p><p>But Percy didn't look up as he folded the note and stood up. "I have work to do," he said, taking his leave.</p><p>Their mum's hands fluttered for a moment before coming to rest in a tea towel that had been hooked over her apron strings at her waist. Her gaze was locked on the corridor Percy had disappeared down.</p><p>"Dad?" George asked quietly as if, with Mum's distraction, she wouldn't hear. Ginny sucked in her breath. She had to give George points for bravery, but he was about to lose them for stupidity.</p><p>Their mum's gaze focused directly on him, and George wilted. But when the tirade came, it wasn't aimed at him.</p><p>"Get that owl out of my kitchen!"</p><p>"What-" Fred raised his arm almost protectively in front of it. Ginny wasn't sure why she'd turned her anger on the owl. She had no idea what was happening, she'd never seen her mum like this and she hated not knowing what was going on.</p><p>"I don't want it here."</p><p>"Molly, darling. You're overreacting just a little." Ginny could imagine the fury in her mother's eyes for being talked back to as she turned to look at him, but their dad kept speaking. "It's just an owl."</p><p>He turned to the twins and glanced over at the nearly empty plates in front of her and Ron. "Ah, good. You're all done. I'm sure you have other things to do."</p><p>Ginny didn't need telling twice and led the exodus from the table. Fred took an extra moment to lean the card that had caused all the fuss up against their dad's cup as he followed them into the corridor. As soon as they were all through the door, they pulled it to behind them, leaving it slightly ajar as the four of them crowded around behind it to hear what was being said.</p><p>"I won't let them go," their mum was saying, the stage whisper she was using carried easily to their ears. Their father's voice was quieter, but Ginny could hear if she edged a little closer to the door.</p><p>"It's not like-"</p><p>"No, Arthur, you know about that house. The whole weight of the Ministry can't break down those wards. Everyone knew Hydrus Fitzroy was a Death Eater, long before he killed my-" her voice tailed off before coming back stronger, "Everyone knew but no one ever even tried to search it!"</p><p>Ginny frowned. 'Death Eater', she mouthed the funny words at Ron, but he shrugged and went back to listening.</p><p>"I'm sure that had more to do with Lycorus being head of-"</p><p>"I won't have them go into that house and have no way of getting them out again."</p><p>"This Sebastian boy is in Ron's year," he said after a moment, obviously trying a different tack. "Don't you think-"</p><p>There was a sigh and the sound of a chair scraping, and Ginny assumed their mum had sat down. "I don't have anything against the child," she said, her voice so soft that Ginny could barely hear it. "Poor boy, losing both of his parents like he did, but I will not let them go into that house, Arthur."</p><p>Ginny knew there wouldn't be any arguing with the tone she ended with, and there was silence for a moment.</p><p>Wings flapping inches from Ginny's face made her stumble backwards, she only just managed to stifle her gasp and catch herself as she trod on Ron's toes.</p><p>The owl was still perched on Fred's shoulder. She hadn't even realised it had come with them. It seemed to be bristling, stretching to its full height at the sound of someone picking up the letter, the sound of the envelope crinkling was clear.</p><p>It was pivoting its heart shaped face between Fred and George, who were making desperate hushing motions at it. It must have realised someone who hadn't been the intended recipient was reading the letter it was meant to deliver, and Ginny had to marvel at how clever the owl was.</p><p>"It says it's his birthday. Perhaps the boys could invite him here instead first," their dad was saying. "That way the boys get to see their friend and you can-"</p><p>Ron hadn't been able to stop the noise that left his throat then, but he hadn't tried. He was grabbing for the door handle, the twins a step too late to stop him as he barged into the kitchen.</p><p>"I don't want him here!" he said. "He's a git, <em>and</em> he's a Slytherin-"</p><p>"Ronald Weasley!" Ginny, Fred and George had followed him in but hung a step back as their mother's furious eyes turned to him. "That child has been through things you couldn't even imagine. He is your brothers' friend, whether or not he is a Slytherin doesn't come into it. I did not raise you to spout prejudice!"</p><p>"But-" Ron quickly shut his mouth at the look their mother gave him. "Then I want to invite my friends too."</p><p>"Fine," she said, then glanced at the twins. "You can invite Lee too."</p><p>"He's in Europe, Mum," Fred said, his tone not exactly what Ginny would have used right this moment. "For the champions cup match, remember?"</p><p>"Oh, well - ah Percy!" Percy had just come into the kitchen behind them, and he looked momentarily startled as they all turned their gazes to him. "You can invite some friends too."</p><p>Fred snorted rather unkindly, bringing their mother's ire back onto him. George quickly cut in before she said anything. "When, Mum? We should write him back."</p><p>"I think- Saturday. Yes, Saturday will be perfect."</p><p>"Saturday? But the invite's for Wednesday!"</p><p>Their mum ignored this latest outburst. "Why don't you all write your friends, and if it's a nice day on Saturday we can eat outside."</p><p>"And play Quidditch, right, Mum?" George's words brought Fred back under control instantly. Whatever he'd been muttering seconds before stopped as he waited for their mum to nod. Ginny narrowed her eyes, a game of pick up Quidditch alone shouldn't have been enough to change Fred's mind, but a shout from Ron had her spinning around.</p><p>"Oi, I was about to use him!"</p><p>Percy had made his way over to Errol as soon as the attention had slipped away from him, and he was attaching yet another letter to the poor bird's leg. "Well, you'll have to wait now."</p><p>"You've got Hermes, why do you need Errol too! Mum!"</p><p>Ginny tuned out Ron's bickering as she watched the twins. Fred had retrieved the card and the envelope from the table, and they were making their way quietly out of the room, the barn owl still sitting on Fred's shoulder.</p><p>Ginny made a quick decision and skipped out after them, following them up the stairs to the third floor.</p><p>Just as they were about to close their bedroom door, she caught up. "What was that about?" She could see they were about to close the door on her, so she spoke again. "She reacted like that when she saw your friend on the platform last year too -" George paused, his hand on the door as he looked at her. Ginny pushed forward, seizing her chance. George let her push the door open, and she settled on the bottom bunk bed.</p><p>The owl had finally left Fred's shoulder and was perched on the back of the single chair by the desk. It looked around as if evaluating the mess that was the twins' floor.</p><p>George closed the door and made her tell them exactly what had happened at King's Cross station last year, and they lapsed into silence afterwards.</p><p>"He must look the same," George said after a while. "Seb and this Hydrus bloke he's related to. That must be why Mum was shocked."</p><p>"That or she's gone barmy. You think he'll bring his broomstick here if we ask?"</p><p>"He promised to let us ride it this summer," George said, answering Ginny's look. "He's got a Lightning Bolt." George grinned as Ginny's eyes went wide. That was the fastest broom ever made, no wonder Fred had shut up at the idea of playing Quidditch on it. Suddenly, Ginny was more than happy her mum had refused to let Fred and George go. This way she might get a go too.</p><p>They bent over the desk and wrote out their message on the back of the card, leaving Ginny to sit and think.</p><p>She was brimming with questions, why had their mum reacted like that? Who was Sebastian? How did his parents die? What did she mean about the wards? But she knew if she asked the wrong ones and annoyed them, she'd get kicked out. She bit her lip, thinking over everything that had happened carefully.</p><p>"What's a Death Eater?" She asked finally as they reattached the note to the barn owl's claw.</p><p>She couldn't help but feel like the owl had understood what she'd just asked because the golden eyes turned in her direction and focused fully on her. She almost missed the look the twins shared.</p><p>"They were followers of You-Know-Who," Fred answered eventually.</p><p>"So who's Hydrus?" Ginny asked, confused. "His dad?"</p><p>"Not his dad, I don't know who Hydrus is."</p><p>"An uncle maybe," George said. "Or cousin?"</p><p>"But he still lives with Sebastian?" she asked. Their mum had said it was the same house.</p><p>"No, it's definitely just him and his sister that live there. He told us so."</p><p>Fred opened the window and carried the owl to it. It leapt forward, spreading its wings and gliding away.</p><p>"It's a beautiful owl," she said without thinking and blushed almost immediately. But they didn't make fun of her for the childish comment.In fact, they both seemed rather taken with the owl themselves.</p><p>Ginny wondered how much time they'd spent around it last year as Fred said. "<em>It</em> is a she."</p><p>"And <em>she</em>," George said, smiling at her, "is called Ava."</p><p>She didn't manage to learn anything else about what had happened. Neither Fred or George knew anything more, and they refused to answer any of the other questions she had about Sebastian. All she could get from Percy over the following days was that the Fitzroy family were upstanding wizards (even though both his parents were now dead). They were a really powerful and influential family and that, if the twins knew what was good for them, they'd become good friends. He'd said more than that, but Ginny wasn't interested in the politics of who exactly his father had been at the Ministry. So she hadn't paid as much attention to the rest.</p><p>The day after she'd managed to get that much from Percy, everyone's Hogwarts letters finally arrived, and the matter slipped from her mind. She'd spent her whole life listening to stories from her older brothers about Hogwarts and all the adventures they'd had. But now her mum was saying that the trip to Diagon Alley could wait till next week.</p><p>More waiting. She was starting to think she'd never get her wand. Fred and George had promised to teach her a hex before school started, but at this rate, Mum wouldn't buy it for her until the day before they left.</p><p>Still, Sebastian had sent Ava back to accept the invitation, promising to bring his broomstick with him. And Ron's friends had also replied. She'd get to meet both Neville and Hermione. Ron had been talking about them all year in his letters ever since they'd duelled a troll on Halloween together, and they'd taken on a professor at the end of term too, so at least that was something to look forward to.</p><p>With a sigh, Ginny turned back to Scabbers, Ron's rat. Out of pure boredom, she'd put a bow behind his right ear, but he seemed rather unimpressed and kept trying to rub it off with his paw- the one with the missing toe. If she had a wand, she could make the bow stay on for the rest of the day. <em>It's not long now</em>, she promised herself. And in the meantime she'd get to ride a Lightning Bolt! She held onto Scabbers and forced the bow back into his fur, thinking about the beautiful owl that belonged to Sebastian. All she had was this stupid rat to play with.</p><p> </p>
