    <p>
  <b>This is the story of how I died. Don’t worry, this is actually a very fun story, and the truth is, it’s hardly even mine. This is the story of a boy named Remus. And it starts, with the sun. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Once upon a time, or whatever, a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. Yeah, I know, right? Just stay with me. Magic and all. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>From this drop of sunlight grew a magic, golden, flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured. There was this creepy old man, who used it’s powers for vain reasons. Remember him. He’s important. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Well, a hop, skip, and a boat ride away, a kingdom grew. The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen. The Queen, well, she was about to have a baby. And she got sick. Really, really, sick. She was running out of time, and that’s when people usually start to look for a miracle. Or, in this case, a magic golden flower. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>This is where</b>
  <b>
    <em> he</em>
  </b>
  <b> comes in, I told you he’d be important. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>You see, instead of sharing it, this man, Fenrir Greyback, hoarded the flower’s healing powers. He used it to keep himself young and desirable for hundreds of years. All he had to do, was sing a special song. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>“Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine, </em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine, </em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>What once was mine.” </em>
  </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Alright, he sings to it, he turns young. You get the jist. Creepy, right? </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Well, one night, he made a mistake and the kingdom’s people found it. The magic of the flower healed the Queen, and a beautiful healthy baby boy was born. With beautiful golden curls. I’ll give you a hint, that’s Remus. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>To celebrate his birth, the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky. And for that moment, everything was perfect. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Then, that moment ended. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Greyback broke into the castle, singing the song to the baby, causing the beautiful golden curls to glow and make him young for a moment. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Greyback attempted to cut off a piece, but instead of allowing him, the piece only lost it’s glow and turned a shade of light brown. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>In a panic, he decided to take the baby, disappearing off into the forest with Remus. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>The kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the missing Prince. Because, deep in the forest, Greyback raised the child as his own. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>He would sing to the boy, and brush through his hair, and use it to become young again. Greyback had found his new magic flower, but this time, he was determined to keep it hidden. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>“Why can’t I go outside?” asked Remus, one evening, over dinner, as a small boy of only 7. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>“The outside world is a dangerous place, full of horrible selfish people. You must stay here, where you are safe. Do you understand, flower?” Greyback explained. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>“Yes, daddy.” </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>But the walls of that tower could not hide everything, because each year on his birthday, the King and Queen would release hundreds of lanterns into the sky, in hopes that one day, their Prince would return home. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Remus would sneak to the only window of the tower and watch them every year, in amazement, his long curls reaching farther down his back every day. </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess this is the moment where I sing and dance, right? Good thing we aren’t that lame, Pete.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The rat never responded, of course, only sniffed with it’s little nose into Remus’ hair. The rat’s little grey hairs disappeared as Remus sang while doing chores, healing the rat back to it’s youth. It was the closest thing Remus had to a friend, he thought, while brushing through his hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus swung his hair back around the pillar and hit the ground, checking himself in the mirror quickly, not really caring what he looked like. His face still looked unresolved, as his eighteenth birthday was tomorrow and he was going to see the lights again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Actually, this time, he wanted to actually see them. Up front. He just had to ask father. Remus was older now, right?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Gid, Fab, I could get used to a view like this,” said Sirius, looking over the kingdom from the roof of the castle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Flynn, come on.” Gideon sighed and Sirius was reminded of his name once again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hold on,” Sirius held his hand up, “Yep. I’m used to it,” He dropped his hand. “Guys, I want a castle,” Sirius decided aloud. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Flynn, you do this job--” Gideon stopped to let his brother finish. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You could buy your own castle,” Fabian finished. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A few moments later, Sirius was harnessed and grabbing the Prince’s crown. It was almost in his hands, he just had to reach out and-- </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A guard sneezed just then, casting a perfect idea into Sirius’ head. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ugh, hay fever?” Sirius asked in a cheeky voice. The guard only responded with a “yeah,” before realizing what had happened and by then, Sirius was already on the run, the wonder-twins right behind him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t you picture me in a castle of my own?” Sirius asked as they ran, “I mean, I certainly can. Oh, the things we’ve seen and it’s only eight in the morning! This is a very big day, gentlemen.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“This is a very big day, Peter,” Remus said, putting his paints away, “I’m finally gonna ask him. I’m gonna ask him!” Remus laughed to himself at how understanding the rat seemed to look.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus, let down your hair!” yelled Father, from outside. Remus pulled back the curtain on his new painting and hid Peter behind it. He rushed over to the window, swinging his curls around the hook and letting down his hair. His father was up in a short moment. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi, welcome home, Father!” Remus smiled wide, albeit a bit nervous. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Remus, how you manage to do that every day without fail is amazing. Looks absolutely exhausting.” Father put his hand on Remus’ shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s nothing,” Remus assured. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Then why does it take so long?” Father asked, a faux look of innocence on his face. Remus smiled nervously. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Um,” he stuttered. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Relax, boy, I’m only joking.” Remus took a deep breath. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Um, so you know, tomorrow is a very big day--” Remus was cut off by his father. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Flower, father is feeling run down, will you sing to me?” Remus nodded and grabbed a chair, quickly, grabbing the brush as well. He sat in front of the chair on the floor, singing through the song at a quick pace. Father didn’t say anything about it, as Remus only seemed a little rushed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus got up and faced his father, who looked a little shocked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So you kind of interrupted me, which is okay, but tomorrow is a big day, and you didn’t respond so I’m just going to tell you. It’s my birthday.” Remus inhaled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, it can’t be, I remember, your birthday was last year.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s the funny thing about birthdays,” Remus looked down at his hands, where he picked at his hangnails, “they’re kind of annual…” Remus didn’t mean to sound so sassy, afraid of what his Father would say. “I’m turning eighteen, Father, and I wanted to ask-- What I want for this birthday, actually, what I want for every birthday--” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus, stop with the rambling. You know how I feel about the rambling. You go on and on, blah blah blah, just get to the point. I’m just teasing, you’re adorable--” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Father, I wanna see the floating lights!” Remus managed to get out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Father stood up, looking confused. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I was-- Well, I’m-- I was hoping you would take me to see those floating lights.” Father’s face smoothed out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you mean the stars!” He decided. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Here’s the thing,” Remus swung his hair to open up a high window, lighting up his chart, “I’ve charted stars, and they’re always constant. These, they only appear on my birthday! And I can’t help but feel like they are meant for me! I need to see them, Father, and not just from my window. In real life.” Remus couldn’t believe he had actually managed to get it out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You want to go outside?” Remus nodded, feeling a little ashamed. “Oh, son, that’s simply not a good idea. There’s illness, men with pointy teeth, you’d get eaten up out there!” Father laughed it off, causing Remus to laugh nervously. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But--” Father cut off Remus by putting his hands on his shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t ever ask to go outside again.” Remus felt intimidated enough to only nod, feeling tears start to form in the back of his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“They can’t get my fucking nose right!” Sirius all but yelled, stopped to look at the wanted poster. It had his name, Flynn Rider, on it, something Sirius felt a little proud of. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who cares?” asked Gideon, before they were interrupted by the sound of horses. They ran off, stopping when they reached a rock they would need to climb. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, give me a boost, I’ll pull you guys up.” Sirius felt a plan start to form. Gideon and Fabian shared a look. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Give us the satchel.” Gideon held out his hand. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t believe after all we have been through you don’t trust me. Ouch.” They didn’t seem to buy his dramatics, only giving him a blank look. He handed over the satchel, Gideon putting it around his shoulder. Sirius climbed up and turned, seeing Fabian’s hand held out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Now help us up, pretty boy,” he said. Sirius only showed him the satchel, having knicked it from Gideon’s shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry, my hands seem to be full.” With that, Sirius took off running. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’s not quite sure what happened in the next ten minutes (he was pretty sure he got into a fight with a horse, but he hit his head pretty hard.) He found himself face to face with a beautiful hidden valley, a tower in the middle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The horse (he was pretty sure) was still looking for him, so he just thought “fuck it” and climbed the edge of the building. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It didn’t take long before he burst through the odd window-door and the first thing he thought about was the satchel, grabbing it and feeling the crown through the thin fabric. That was around where his memory cut off. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>CLANG </em>
  </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus panicked quickly, seeing the man fall to the ground at the impact. He seemed unconscious, Remus hiding behind the first thing he could find. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He peeked out at the man, lying on the ground, and examined him. He shared a look with Peter, who seemed to shrug mentally. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He took the handle of the pan and checked for pointy teeth, remembering the speech his father gave. No, this man’s teeth were straight and white, and the more Remus looked at him the fonder he got. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was actually very handsome, it filled Remus with a feeling he had never felt before, but the moment ended quickly when the man woke up, his eyes shooting open. Remus panicked and hit him again, feeling slightly guilty. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Just then, he happened to look out the window, and a plan started to form. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius woke up slowly, first feeling like he couldn’t move, and then realizing a rat was biting his ear he shuddered and let out a small scream, shaking the rat off of him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He examined further, realizing he was tied up in a chair. (Which he would normally very much enjoy, but seeing as he just committed a crime it was probably not for reasons he would enjoy. Shame.) </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Is this hair? What the fuck?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius looked around himself, realizing he was tied up with what looked like wavy golden blonde hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” He muttered to himself, looking around the room almost frantically. It was the same tower room he had been in before. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Struggling-- struggling is pointless.” A young man’s voice brought Sirius’ gaze to a corner of the room that was blocked off by shadows. The boy walked out of the shadows, brandishing a frying pan, looking quite-- well, gorgeous. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His head of hair was connected to what Sirius seemed to be tied to. He had some of it tied in the back, making it look perhaps more masculine than if it was just down. The excess fell down his back and all around the room, ending in a few knots around Sirius. It was much curlier around his head. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was dressed in common clothes, the shirt a soft shade of purple. The next thing he noticed, however, was the boy’s face, which almost knocked Sirius out again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes were wide and a bright shade of green, looking rather innocent. His face had soft yet sharp features, looking like he was seeing another human for the first time. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know why you’re-- why you’re here, and I’m not afraid of you,” He spoke, sounding more scared than he said. His voice was deep, but again, soft, and Sirius liked hearing it a little too much. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Sirius asked, in a sort of daze. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you, and how did you find me?” He asked, looking and sounding more demanding this time. Sirius only let out a short noise at being held gunpoint with the pan (panpoint?) Sirius decided there was only one way to handle this. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you, but may I just say? Hello. How are you? The name’s Flynn Rider.” If possible, Sirius would’ve kicked his feet up and leaned back, but he settled for just relaxing against the chair. The boy didn’t react.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who else knows my location, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flynn Rider?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He asked. Sirius cleared his throat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Listen, Blondie,” Sirius started. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Remus,” the boy, Remus, corrected. Sirius didn’t listen. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Gesundheit--” Sirius didn’t expect to be cut off, but the boy spoke again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Lots of mouth coming from the man I have tied up.” Instead of getting pissed like Sirius mildly felt he should, Sirius only laughed, causing a little (admittedly adorable) red to spread across his face. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d love to be tied up by you again,” Remus blushed harder, “But I was simply in a situation through the forest. I came across your tower and…” Sirius trailed off, making a realization. “No, no, where’s my satchel?” Sirius asked, frantically. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve hid it,” Remus brought the pan back to his side, “Somewhere you’ll never find it.” Sirius looked around, seeing a rather obvious hiding place. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s over there, isn’t it?” Sirius nodded his head towards the vase on the ground. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He woke up again feeling the same bite on his left ear, freaking out and shaking it off again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Would you stop doing that?” He yelled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Now,” Remus said, looking quite proud of himself, “It’s hidden somewhere you’ll never find it.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius tried really, really hard not to be attracted to that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So what do you want with my hair? To cut it? Sell it?” Remus asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Uhh, no? The only thing I wanna do with your hair is get out of it. Literally.” Sirius gestured by attempting to pull his arms up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, you don’t want my hair?” Remus’ arms went by his side, more relaxed than before, looking confused. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why on earth would I want your hair?” Sirius began, “Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it. End of story, beautiful.” That made him blush again. Sirius smirked to himself. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait-- You’re-- You’re telling the truth?” His face softened and he glanced at the rat, who was now perched on his hand. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes!” Sirius briefly struggled, for emphasis. He didn’t respond. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, but he can take me!” He said. Was he really talking to a rat? “What choice do I have, Peter?” He asked. Oh yes, he was talking to a rat. Okay. Sure. He turned back to Sirius. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, I’m prepared to offer you a deal.” He straightened out, as if trying to look serious. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A deal?” Sirius asked, incredulous. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, a deal, look this way.” Remus pulled open a curtain, showing a painting he recognized. “Do you know what these are?” Remus asked, a tone in his voice Sirius didn’t recognize. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you mean the lantern thing they do for the prince?” His face lit up in wonder. If Sirius wasn’t supremely annoyed by his presence, it might have been adorable. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I knew they weren’t stars!” He all but yelled. “Well, tomorrow evening, these will light the night sky,” He explained. “You</span>
  <em>
    <span> will </span>
  </em>
  <span>act as my guide, take me to the lanterns, and return me home safely. Then and </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> then, will I return your satchel to you.” Sirius was in a battle with his mind, one half of it finding his tone extremely attractive and the other half wanting to punch this little twink in the face. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Listen, no can do. Me and the kingdom aren’t exactly simpatico currently. So, I won’t be taking you anywhere,” Sirius explained. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Something brought you here, Flynn Rider,” Remus stepped , “Call it what you will, fate, destiny--” Sirius cut in. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A horse.” Remus shot him quick glare, a small laugh falling through his lips. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I have made the decision to trust you.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A terrible decision, really,” Sirius insisted. A full laugh escaped his lips this time, the smile taking over his face before he pulled on his hair and brought them face to face. Oh boy, this was far too much for Sirius. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But trust me when I tell you this,” Remus’ face was back to menacing, “You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick, and you will never find your precious satchel.” Sirius honestly couldn’t handle it anymore, so he broke eye contact and cleared his throat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So let me get this straight,” Sirius wanted to make a pun, but wasn’t interested in having </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> conversation right now. “I take you to see the bloody lanterns, take you home, and you give me back my satchel?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I promise,” Remus said, “and when I promise something, I never, ever break that promise. Ever.” Sirius almost sighed in relief when Remus let go. He was still holding his hair, ready to do something if needed. Sirius tried very briefly to look attractive to this boy, but after a few seconds Remus only looked confused, if not a little annoyed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine. I’ll take you to see the lanterns.” Remus lit up, turning towards the window, taking the chair to the ground. Ow. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?! Oh-- shit, sorry, oops.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You coming, blondie?” Flynn yelled, from down on the grass. Remus was close to panicking, the only thing keeping him from screaming and shutting the window was the squeaks coming from Peter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus tied a piece of hair around Peter’s little body, using his adrenaline to slide down his hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He stopped, momentarily, just before he hit the grass, before planting his feet to the ground. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Currently, Remus sat against a rock staring into nowhere. Sirius had watched his mood go up and down in the past hour. He must have some very unhealthy relationship with his father, from what Sirius picked up. </span>
</p>

  <span>Remus definitely talked too much, there was no way Sirius could be expected to listen to it all. He walked up behind the boy, noticing he was probably crying. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This could work. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So, I seem to notice you are a bit at war with yourself here.” Remus turned a little. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m fine.” He turned back straight ahead. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure abou--” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m seeing those lanterns.” Remus stood up and straightened himself out, looking a little beat down but making a face of determination. Just then, a bush next to the two boys ruffled, causing Remus to jump. He grabbed his frying pan and pointed it at the bush, before a bunny hopped out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Woah, stay calm, it can probably smell fear,” Sirius said, causing a laugh in the other boy. It was another laugh that almost knocked Sirius to the ground, one that was genuine and bright. Too bad Sirius was still a terrible person. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you hungry?” Sirius asked. “I know a place.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Where?” Remus turned. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you’ll smell it.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>

  <b>See, on his walk, Fenrir Greyback found that lovely palace horse and went into a panic. He came running back, searching and searching the tower for his lovely Remus, coming up with nothing. </b>

  <b>Oh well. </b>
