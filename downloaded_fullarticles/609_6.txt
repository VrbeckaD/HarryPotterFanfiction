    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>White.</p><p> </p><p>Everywhere.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sensation of existing and then not is jarring, complex, but can best be described as humbling—it's humbling how life doesn't just fade into nothingness, how just one stolen breath results to this, how if your heart stops beating it's... over. </p><p><br/>
Over like it is for him now.</p><p><br/>
For one breif but eternal moment, he's incorporeal.</p><p><br/>
And then he comes to realise seconds, maybe minutes or hours later, when his eyes start to see through the blinding whiteness all around him, that Circe, he exists, that he's solid, he can actually feel the stillness around his body.</p><p><br/>
A beat or two later—</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Professor?" He says, surprised that he even has a voice.</p><p><br/>
He can't help it. He's new to being—you know, dead.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Dumbledore stares back at him from a distance away, looking...well 'dour', he supposes, in dark robes, his ridiculous hat sat on his head and his trademark moon eyed glasses perched on his nose. He looks like the last day Harry saw him, on that tower before Snape killed him. Except for the robes. The robes are new. Very un-Dumbledore-like.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
There's also something different about him. Something Harry can't quite name. </p><p><br/>
Silence.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
And just when it starts to get awkward—</p><p>"Harry." The old man acknowledges.</p><p><br/>
"Am I dead, Professor?" Harry asks, not really afraid of what the answer is. </p><p> </p><p>"Your heart stopped beating approximately 2 minutes ago, yes. But you are not quite dead."</p><p>The 'yet' is left unsaid.</p><p><br/>
"I don't understand." Harry says. Because he really doesn't.</p><p><br/>
"Walk with me, my boy." </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore turns around and starts walking, and Harry, honestly having nothing better to do, quickly falls into step right beside him.</p><p> </p><p>They walk for a while, Harry gathering his thoughts and Dumbledore waiting patiently for him to do so, and then, very suddenly, or very gradually does the whiteness around them starts to gain form. It looks like—</p><p> </p><p>"Kings Cross Station." He says out loud.</p><p> </p><p>"This is where your life changed, where your adventure truly began." Dumbledore says, giving him a sideways glance.</p><p><br/>
Then suddenly, there's a wail, a heart wrenching sort of wail that has Harry frantically searching for its source. Because it's sounds like a child is in—</p><p><br/>
"Oh." He can only say. Surprised at the gruesome little thing underneath one of the benches infront of them. It takes but a moment for him to make the connection—the snake like noseless face, the gaunt almost skeletal baby like frame and the waxy-like disgusting skin... "Is that—is that Voldemort, sir?"</p><p><br/>
"It is the piece of him that was in you."</p><p><br/>
Circe, that thing looks disgusting. <br/>
There's another wail of suffering, one that makes Harry think of all the times he'd cried for someone, anyone to take him away from the Dursely's— "Can we help it-him?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore gives him a long searching look, one that quickly has Harry feeling undressed. He double checks just incase to make sure he isn't. "Perhaps" he says, slowly, as if he's pondering on it. ",but it is not worth the effort."</p><p><br/>
Harry frowns, disappointed and maybe a little angry that Dumbledore is doing something like this again. Leaving someone to suffer even if there's something he can do about it.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p><br/>
"He is beyond your help, Harry."</p><p><br/>
"Is he though?" Harry asks, walking towards the golum-man-baby Voldemort thing under the bench. Maybe if he could comfort it-him, he would stop crying like that.</p><p><br/>
"Harry, if you touch him, then there is no going back. Saving Voldemort's soul will lead you on another path. You will never see your friends again."</p><p><br/>
"Will I officially die then?" He asks, an inch away from touching it-him.</p><p><br/>
"It's very possible for you to return to this point, yes. But dying, not so much my boy." </p><p>There's a sigh, a fond one by the sounds of it, then Dumbledore conjures a blanket wandlessly, passing it onto Harry. "He looks like he might need this."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Harry transfers the gollum soul piece baby onto the blanket, after carefully restraining it when it tries to crawl or slither away from him. It—he continues to squirm in Harry's hold but eventually settles down and those wails are reduced to whimpers.</p><p><br/>
"What happens now?" Harry asks.</p><p><br/>
"We ride the train my boy." The old man says, cheerful.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Harry finds a comfortable spot, the train starts to move. He adjusts the whimpering soul piece and gives Dumbledore his undivided attention.</p><p><br/>
"First, let me formally introduce myself. I am the end of all things living—"</p><p><br/>
"D-death?!" Harry interrupts.</p><p><br/>
Dumble—Death gives him a dry look. </p><p>That—huh?</p><p>Harry actually believes him—it, them? Dumbledore doesn't make expressions like that.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Take care not to interrupt me, my boy." It says lightly, but Harry gets the message. "I appear before you as your former headmaster because he is part of my realm and therefore a part of me. He speaks through me."</p><p><br/>
Harry waits for his voice to fade before asking his question.</p><p><br/>
"So, you're a medium of sorts?"</p><p><br/>
Dumble-Death nods. "I suspected perhaps before the moment you arrived here, that you would not do what Dumbledore would ask of you. But I was not sure. You are peculiar being, my boy. I could not, for the life of me, anticipate what you would do next."</p><p><br/>
Harry snorts. Then quickly covers his mouth.<br/>
It jostles the soul piece thing and starts another round of wails. </p><p><br/>
Dumble-Death waves his hand and the gollum goes to sleep.</p><p><br/>
"I think your unpredictableness has everything to do with you having mastered my Hallows, in every existence similar to this one."</p><p><br/>
"Every existence?"</p><p><br/>
"Well, some of them."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Silence.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Harry sighs. "What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Time, my young friend, is not circular, nor is it linear. It is similar to a tree with branches stretching out to the vast eternity that surrounds us. Probability of a certain action being taken or a situation coming into existence is what keeps this tree growing. With probability, there is chance of whether or not that certain action will be taken or an alternative will be utilised.</p><p> </p><p>This means that, Harry, you could've brushed your teeth this morning, but instead you used mouth wash. In another Earth, similar to the one you exist in, this morning you brushed your teeth. </p><p><br/>
It could be anything from that, to actually fleeing instead of facing Voldemort. There is an infinite amount of worlds out there, Harry."</p><p><br/>
Harry breaths out sigh, because this is his life. He's got to stop getting surprised by things like this happening to him,it's getting old. "So in some of the other worlds I mastered your hallows? The wand, the cloak and the stone?" </p><p><br/>
"Indeed. And in all those worlds you used them differently, and in some you weren't even aware of what power you held in your grasp."</p><p><br/>
In hindsight though, that is alot to take in. "So what happens now pro-uh Mr Death Sir."</p><p><br/>
Dumble-Death chuckles into his hand, eyes twinkling in merriment. "Well, my dear boy. Seeing as you want to save Voldemort because of your impressive guilt complex, you've quite a journey ahead of you. It will be long and most definitely hard, and the results might not be what you want them to be."</p><p><br/>
Harry frowns. That doesn't sound like fun. But—"I'll do it."</p><p><br/>
"Very well." The being nods. "Seeing as the only pieces of his soul that are left are those currently residing in his body and the one you hold in your hand, the only way to return him to his original state is if you travel along the branches of time and collect his hocruxes."</p><p><br/>
"Travel the branches of time?" Harry asks, dubiously.</p><p><br/>
 "Voldemort was right in that no one had ever gone as far as he in persuit of immortality. He mutilated his soul, a sin even I, a being of complete nuetrality, cannot overlook. You destroyed his hocruxes and by extension, the soul pieces thst were stored in them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pieces left will forever be stuck in limbo, suffering as you see. The others no longer exist, and therefore I cannot judge his soul. </p><p><br/>
He has offended the balance greatly Harry, and would suffer his crimes in this way were it not for your "saving people thing". </p><p><br/>
There is a catch unfortunately.</p><p><br/>
His soul cannot be restored, not in this universe. The balance will not allow it."</p><p><br/>
Harry thinks about it for a moment. Voldemort must have made hocruxes in the other realities right? "So, I'll have to travel to an alternate dimension?"</p><p>"Yes, you will travel to all those dimensions where you never partook in the war, had yet to be born or died before you could destroy them all."</p><p><br/>
"Wait, so I'll be moving through different times and different realities?"</p><p><br/>
Dumble-Death chuckles. "I did say it would not be easy. We can always turn back now, my boy."</p><p>Harry thinks about it.</p><p>Who ever gave Tom Marvalo Riddle a chance? Just one small measly chance?<br/>
No one.<br/>
No fucking one.</p><p><br/>
"Fuck...no, I'll do it, Sir. I'll do it."</p><p><br/>
Dumble-Death proceeds to tell him a whole lot about the plot that he missed or just wouldn't have found out about as he spent year after year trying to survive Voldemort, the Dursley's, Dumbledore's mechanisations, werewolves and evil Defence Professors.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Seems like we're about to reach our first stop." Dumble-Death says. "You will retrieve the soul pieces in the order that you destroyed them in."</p><p><br/>
"So I'll start with the diary?"</p><p><br/>
"Yes." The being nods. "I wish you the best of luck Harry."</p><p><br/>
"Wa—"</p><p> </p><p>............    </p><p>"—it!"</p><p><br/>
"Dear me, Mr Peverell. Are you alright?"</p><p><br/>
Harry blinks confusedly at Dumbledore's question. "Ex-eh, Professor?" </p><p><br/>
"You must join the other students for the sorting ceremony, my boy." He manoeuvres Harry into the Great Hall, ignoring his wide eyed panicked look, and down to the first year students that are about to be sorted.</p><p><br/>
"—oh, yes. And this year, we have an exchange student all the way from the South African school of magic, Platinumberg Academy, young Mr. Hadrian Peverell who will be joining the fifth years. I hope you will all make Mr Peverell's stay here at Hogwarts an experience he will never forget."</p><p><br/>
Circe, Harry thinks. That last sentence there was very ambiguous.</p><p><br/>
Peverell?</p><p><br/>
Why the hell did they think he was—<br/>
For that matter, how in Circe's name did he get here? And Platinumberg Academy? Seriously, he's never even been to South Africa. <br/>
How—<br/>
What.</p><p>He feels amusement that really...isn't his own. It doesn't feel like Voldemort's...</p><p>Sigh. Oh.<br/>
Oh, it all made sense now.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Dumble-Death did not seem like the kind with good humor .</p><p>He has no chance of blending seamlessly into the masses with a name like that.</p><p><br/>
"Step forward, my boy." Armando Dippet says, gesturing the wooden stool.</p><p><br/>
Harry notices that, yeah—yes, he'd been lost in thought and everyone had been sorted. <br/>
The hat is barely touching his head before shouting "Slytherin!"</p><p> </p><p>Bullocks.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
