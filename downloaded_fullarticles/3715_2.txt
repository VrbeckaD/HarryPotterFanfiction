    <p>So like Veronica was strutting down the street in her nice fancy new bedazzled crocs when she finally decided to eat some fucking food, the stupid anorexic bitch. So she fuckinnng waltzed her way into <strike>Pizza Hut</strike> <u><b>MICKY-DEES</b></u> (A FINE EATING ESTABLISHMENT FOR FAMILIES OF ALL AGES) and was like;</p><p> </p><p>“Sup y’all, all y’all want some fuckin’ pie? Cause I got all y’all some fookin’ pie. Some furkin’ life o’ slice o’ pi, y’all.”</p><p> </p><p>And everyone was really blorpin’ confuzzled and were like;</p><p> </p><p>“OF WHOM ART THOU GIVEN TITLE, SAPIENT FEMALE NARWHAL?”  </p><p> </p><p>Which pissed Veronicia the fuuke off so she shat a fat one on everyone’ses tables and flipped actual birds at them. Now everyone in the established eating restaurant were very confusioned  as to why the fūk there were thousands of blue jays in the ceiling fans.</p><p> </p><p>As Veroonicia approached the counter with the elegance of an obese oompa loompa, the cashier stood stock still. Why, the cashier was death himself.</p><p> </p><p>“heyyoo. like, welcome to <strike>Burger King</strike> <u><b>MICKY-DEES</b></u> (A FINE EATING ESTABLISHMENT FOR FAMILIES OF ALL AGES)  may i, like, take your order?”  The Transdimensional Being Of Doom asked the sexy narwhal.</p><p> </p><p>“All y’all should buy all my pie.” She declared, dumping millions of croissants over the cash register, which short circuited the sad money machine.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>“i’m so so so so so <em> so </em> sorry ma’am, but we don’t take cash here. so so so sorry in advance, young maiden.” The Eternal God Of Entropy said to Vearoonicia.</p><p> </p><p>“But I got all y’all some pies, y’all can’t eat all my pies ya furckingeth fuuuke.” Vearooneecia said, sobbing her metaphorical eyes out. The Immortal Creature Of Lords rolled his also metaphorical eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Just then, when absolutely nobody in the room was expecting a Shrek™ reference, the Kool-Aid Man™  smashed through a wall. He was later charged eight thousand dollars in cash as payment for his destruction of federal property. He still had to serve seven years in prison however because the police discovered that he had been mixing crack in with his Kool-Aid mix. He plans on taking restorative classes to restore his mental health when he <strike> escapes </strike> is let go. <em> (LIKE ANY WALLS COULD HOLD THE MAN OF KOOL) </em></p><p> </p><p>This turn of events caused the dead Invader Zim fandom to resurrect and start fighting over whether or not Harry Potter would date <strike>Taco Bell</strike> <u><b>MICKY-DEES</b></u> (A FINE EATING ESTABLISHMENT FOR FAMILIES OF ALL AGES) if he happened to be an alien in the best crossover fanfiction know to man; Attack Of The Love Struck Taco.</p><p> </p><p>They were all eventually killed by the one and only Chuck Norris Grumpy Poptart Cat the Third. So nothing mattered in the end, but Vearooneeciaaa was the only survivor B/C she’s a old misguided FUUUCKCCKkk.</p>
