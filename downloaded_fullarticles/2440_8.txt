    <p>Sirius stared at Remus for what felt like hours, (but was really only a few seconds) as he tried to take in what he'd just said. </p><p>
  <em>Maybe you should return to your house. </em>
</p><p>  "What?"</p><p>  "You should go back to your old house. You know, so you have somewhere to stay." Remus looked very awkward, looking at how close they were. "You need somewhere safe to stay."</p><p>Sirius glared. "I feel whole for the first time in twelve years and you want to take that away from me?"</p><p>  "Listen..." Remus began, in his professor voice. The same voice Sirius had once loved. </p><p>  "No, you listen, Remus. I don't care about any of that bullshit you're trying to say. I need you and you need me."</p><p>Remus glared right back. "I am not going to be the one to kill you, Sirius. I almost killed Harry and his friends, I won't kill you."</p><p>Sirius stared, mouth open. <em>'So that's what has his wand in a knot. Fucking idiot.'</em></p><p>  "—I'm just a dangerous beast, I won't—"</p><p> "Shut the fuck up, Moony."</p><p>Remus blinked at him in surprise. </p><p>Sirius smirked with satisfaction. "Look, we've been dealing with Moony half our lives. Nothing we can't handle now."</p><p>  "It's worse now." Remus said quietly. </p><p>Sirius reached forward, the sleeves of his leather jacket touching a tender scar on Remus' neck, and making him wince. "Moony, Padfoot's been locked up too long. He misses his wolfie. Why don't we go for a run next moon, and see what happens?"</p><p>Remus sighed, but he had a faint smile. "You've always been an idiot, Pads."</p><p>Sirius nodded, close to beaming. "Yes I have!"</p>
