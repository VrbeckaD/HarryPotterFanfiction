    <p>Karkat Vantas was not pleased, to say the least. He had just watched all of his friends die and was expecting to joking them in a peaceful afterlife, well as peaceful as you get with them. Yet, he was here instead. As a human wiggler. He was trying to get it through his human Russia's head that his name was not in fact Draco Malfoy, but nothing was working. With a sigh he resigned himself to the fate of being called that until he was old enough to talk. Stupid humans.</p>
<p>John wasn’t worried. If he was here than his friends were to, so he had no need to worry. Though he did have more pressing matters to worry about. He hadn’t pulled a prank in ages. It was getting to him. Like an itch you can’t scratch. He would have to wait until he could walk to pull one. Don’t get him wrong he was excited to see his friends. Though when he met Dave he knew he would be teased relentlessly about his new name. I mean what kind of name is Neville Longbottom.</p>
