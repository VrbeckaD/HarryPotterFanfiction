  <u> <b>Dorphis*</b> </u>
</p><p>
  <em> M.O.M. Classification: XXXX </em>
</p><p>The Dorphis, more commonly known as the Fire Phoenix, is a magnificent, swan-sized, scarlet bird with a long golden tail, beak and talons.</p><p>This Phoenix is the most common of the Phoenix family and represents Light Magic. It nests on mountain peaks and is found in Egypt, India and China. The Fire Bird lives to an immense age as it can regenerate, bursting into flame when its body begins to fail and rising again from the ashes as a chick.</p><p>The Dorphis is a gentle creature that has never been known to kill and eats only herbs. It is also able to disappear and reappear in a flash of fire at will and can carry an immense load of weight. Dorphis song is magical: it is reputed to increase the courage of the pure of heart and to strike fear into the hearts of the impure. Phoenix tears have powerful healing properties.</p><p><em>*I have taken most of the words</em> <em>directly from J. K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them.</em></p><p> </p><p>

  <u> <b>Hyphis</b> </u>
</p><p>
  <em> M.O.M. Classification: XXXX </em>
</p><p>The Hyphis, more commonly known as a Sky Phoenix, belongs to the Phoenix Family. This Immortal bird is the rarest of the family and represents grey magic. Much like the Dorphis the Hyphis is a swan-sized bird, though the colouring is different. It has mostly sky-blue feathers and its accents are silver and white. Hypises are know to nest in the clouds, whom are able to carry its weight. They can be found all over the world.</p><p>Just like all birds from this family it is able to regenerate when it feels that their body begins to fail, though it does this in a less spectacular fashion than a Dorphis, namely through the winds who will carry the newborn chick to a cloud for it to grow.</p><p>Hypises have kneazel like insticts and are protectors, but unlike the basilisk, whom protects a place or a building, a hyphis protects a person and is known to kill an enemy of what they see as their charge. A hyphis feather will deflect anything but the unforgivables. Like the Dorphis, it can disappear and reappear at will and will do so trough a puff of mist and completely silent, the hyphis too is able to carry a lot of weight. It also has the ability to turn completely invisable to a point where even spells like humenun revelio wont work. Hyphis tears are the strongest known truth serum.</p><p>

  <u> <b>Cerbris</b> </u>
</p><p>
  <em>M.O.M. Classification: XXXX</em>
</p><p>The Cerbris, more commonly known as the Dark Phoenix or the Shadow Phoenix, also belongs to the Phoenix family. The Black bird is, again, swan-sized and has purple accents within the feathers, the tail, beak and talons revert to a darker grey. The Cerbris represents Dark Magic.</p><p>Cerbrises are most commonly found in the swamps of northern Europe as this is where they nest. Much like the rest of their family, a Cerbris is immortal as it is able to regenerate, collapsing into a pile of bones and rising from within one.</p><p>The Cerbris is known to be aggressive when provoked but otherwise will stay away from humanity as a whole. It is able to travel trough shadows and can carry up to 1 ton of weight. Cerbris tears are highly acidic.</p><p>
