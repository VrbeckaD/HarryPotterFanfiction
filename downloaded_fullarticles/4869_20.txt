    <p>Parseltongue- <strong>‘Harry Potter’</strong></p><p> CHAPTER 1</p><p> </p><p>After the death of the youngest Weasley, Harry and Jasper returned to their home. Miles away in Little Hangleton, Lord Voldemort decided it was time to approach Harry Potter about his new place in the Wizarding World.</p><p>“Severus, do you have a way of contacting Potter? I would like to set up a meet” the Dark Lord asked.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p><p>“Please make haste with it” Voldemort waved Severus away as Lucius came towards him, and gestured for him to speak.</p><p>“My Lord, if I may speak freely, what if Potter is just trying to trick you?” asked the nervous blonde-haired wizard. “This could be his plan all along”</p><p>Voldemort looked at his longtime friend and sighed. “My dear Lucius, Harry Potter is soul bonded to a dark creature, murdered his uncle and killed his uncle’s sister in cold blood, he is as much a dark wizard as I am and could prove very useful to our side.” And even if he didn’t side with us, Dumbledore still won’t win, the tide has turned with Harry being a dark wizard, he thought to himself.</p><p>Smirking, the Dark Lord waved him away, contemplating what would come next, he wanted to meet with Harry, to see if he would become neutral or fight alongside his Dark brethren.</p><p> </p><p><em>Scritch, scritch, scritch. </em>Harry looked up from his mother’s diary, just having read a particularly interesting entry about her keeping her dark veela nature a secret. A white and gray owl stood at the window.</p><p>Harry got up from his seat to open the window; the owl stuck its leg out for Harry to retrieve the letter attached. “Will you be waiting for a reply” He asked the owl who nodded back to him.</p><p>Harry opened the letter and after reading, he started to chuckle.</p><p>Jasper, Bill, and Edward were in the kitchen chatting about what their day would bring, when they heard Harry laughing and decided to investigate.</p><p>They walked into the living room to find the green-eyed wizard laughing and an irritated owl glaring at the young dark veela.</p><p>“What’s so funny darlin’?” asked the handsome blonde.</p><p>“Severus Snape has asked for a meeting on behalf of the Dark Lord. Evidently they have found out some of the things I have done recently and the Dark Lord wishes to meet with me to confirm them” Harry replied, giving a sporadic chuckle.</p><p>Bill looked at Harry in surprise, wondering how the dungeon bat had found out anything that the younger man had be up to.</p><p>“Isn’t Snape one of your professors?” Jasper asked. Harry nodded.</p><p>“Do you want to meet with the Dark Lord, he is always trying to kill you?” he asked his fiancé.</p><p>Harry thought it over and made his decision. Writing a quick letter, he sent it off with the owl and turned to face Jasper, Bill, and Edward. “I think I will, if nothing more than to let him know that I will be remaining neutral in this war; I want nothing to do with it” he stated.</p><p>“Harry, would you mind if we come along as back up, I’d prefer if you didn’t meet the man on your own” asked the older redhead, eyebrows bunched in concern for the young man.</p><p>“I figured you all would and said as much in my letter. I figured all the Cullens, Jasper, Myself, and Bill would want to go, this way we have backup in case it is needed” stated Harry smiling at Bill.</p><p>They all nodded. Jasper looked at his fiancé, and asked “why were you so amused at the letter?”</p><p>Harry giggled, “because I should have known that they would find out what has been happening. I haven’t really kept it a secret.”</p><p>The other three looked at him, still confused. Harry just shook his head and chuckled. “It’s funny because I haven’t even thought of Voldemort in a while. My life has been great, no one trying to kill me.”</p><p>The others just looked at each other and grinned; though the thought of anyone killing Harry made Jasper growl.</p><p>“I requested the meeting in to be at noon tomorrow to get it done with. We are meeting them at Grimmauld Place, I am going to summon Kreacher to have him clean and get it ready for the meeting.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Esme were finishing the last touches on the food for the meeting when a chime sounded, letting him know they had visitors. He casted a tempus to tell him it was exactly noon and met the others in the parlor. Carlisle and Emmet would be meeting the others at the door and bring them on through, Harry had already adjusted the wards for the meeting to let them in when it was time.</p><p>Alice had been smiling for most of the day and when asked, would only state that everything would be fine. She had succeeded in kicking Edward out of her head so that he wouldn’t know what was to come. But Edward was content knowing that her emotions were steady and calm, from what Jasper had told him. She wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. Their world was about to be knocked out from under them today. Or at least Harry and Bill’s were.</p><p>The vampires in the parlor could hear Carlisle and Emmet greet the newcomers and escorted them to the others.</p><p>Harry and Jasper stood up to greet everyone as they came into the room. Along with Voldemort came, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange, Nagini, Nott Sr. and Theo Nott, Joseph Parkinson (Pansy’s father), Amycus Carrow, Travers, and Blaise Zabini.</p><p>The red-eyed lord looked at the boy who lived, “thank you for agreeing to this meeting”. Harry nodded back to him.</p><p>“What can I help you with? I assume you’re not here to kill me?” Harry asked raising a delicate brown eyebrow at his mate.</p><p>Jasper stopped his growling with a sheepish smile. “Can’t help it, the thought of anyone killing you or wanting too makes me upset”. Harry just shook his head at his mate and looked back to Voldemort.</p><p>“No, not here to kill you, just trying to find out what your plans are now” the Dark Lord asked the emerald-eyed beauty.</p><p>Harry smiled and motioned for everyone to sit, transfiguring items to fit everyone. He looked at Draco, Theo, and Blaise curiously before returning his attention to the Dark Lord.</p><p>“After this meeting I have arranged with the goblins at Gringotts to verify the validity of the prophecy, also receive the results of an audit ordered, and was hoping you all would join me in the meeting. Dumbledore has a lot to answer for but I believe the prophecy is a fake as does my fiancé. Dumbledore went in and out of my vaults on multiple occasions, even tried to force a marriage with Ginny Weasley”.</p><p>Harry noticed the sneer on the faces of Voldemort’s followers and continued.</p><p>“As for the war, I would prefer to remain neutral. I have no interest in this war unless it pertains to me and mine personally. So long as my family and friends aren’t hurt, I have no issues with you continuing your war with the light but Dumbledore is mine to deal with” Harry answered.</p><p>“I won’t help you, unless it’s to protect those who are important to me, but I won’t stop you either, unless, again, it’s to protect those who are important to me. As of right now, I will continue with my schooling, in fact I decided on requesting a resort at the start of term”. The shocked look on Riddle’s followers was hilarious and Harry let a chuckle escape. “What, you didn’t think I would remain in Gryffindor did you? I was meant to be in Slytherin, that is where the sorting hat wanted me. Hagrid told me Slytherin was where all the Dark witches and wizards came from, I didn’t want any part of it. That and Draco was a prat the two times I had a run in with him. I bloody well didn’t want to be in any house he was in, so I told the sorting hat I wanted to be in any house but Slytherin, so it put me in Gryffindor. I have since learned that it doesn’t matter the house, Dark wizards and witches can come from any of them, the house doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Harry and those with him thought it was hilarious when they saw the gaping expressions on all of the death eaters, their children, and Lord Voldemort’s snake face made it even more comical.</p><p><strong>‘There is also one other thing, well two, as I already stated Dumbledore is mine, but I will trade him, I want Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Wormtail’ </strong>Harry hissed to Voldemort.</p><p><strong>‘Why?’ </strong>The Dark Lord hissed back.<strong> ‘They are loyal to me and very dedicated.’</strong></p><p><strong>‘Because Wormtail is the reason my parents are dead, even if we find out Dumbledore set up my family, which I believe we will. He gave up their location to you without an ounce of remorse. Bellatrix and her husband because she had a hand in what happened to my friend Neville’s parents, no matter what they did, they didn’t deserve that’ </strong>he stated. <strong>‘Neville has never turned his back on me, even now, knowing I am a Dark wizard with a Dark creature as a mate, he hasn’t turned away from me, he deserves justice.’ </strong></p><p>The Dark Lord sat back and looked at Harry, a contemplative look on his face. ‘<strong>What makes you think that Bellatrix and Rodolphus had anything to do with the Longbottom’s? Dumbledore I presume?’</strong></p><p><strong>‘Yessssss.’ </strong>Harry hissed.</p><p><strong>‘Do you have a pensieve here?’ </strong>Harry shook his head no. <strong>‘Please lower the wards, I wish for one of mine to retrieve something you may want to see’. </strong>Harry did as asked. </p><p>“Bellatrix please return to the manor and retrieved a pensieve” when she hesitated, Voldemort lifted his wand and pointed it at her, she apparated immediately.</p><p>A few minutes later Bellatrix with the pensieve. “Rodolphus, Bellatrix, please remove the memory of the night of the Longbottom’s torture. I was there as well” he stated removing his own memory of the night.</p><p>Lord Voldemort pointed his wand at the pensieve after the memories were deposited. “Magna Screen.”</p><p>“Please watch, I have spelled it to play on a large screen instead of us all going into it together.” Everyone stared at the screen in silence as they watched the different memories play out.</p><p>“How do we know these weren’t tampered with?” Harry asked. “Because the edges would be fuzzy, almost blurry, what you saw is the truth of what happened that night. Dumbledore tortured the Longbottom’s, not my death eaters. He didn’t know we were there, they had asked me for a meeting for eight o’clock that night, he had shown up a few hours before us. They had wanted to make a truce with me, wanted to remain neutral since the prophecy could be about their own son or you. Dumbledore just left them there, he tortured them into losing their minds and walked away. We are the ones who took the couple to St. Mungos for treatment. The Longbottom’s have always been light but remained neutral as they had friends on both sides, they wanted that to continue. I was there to make an oath to that affect.”</p><p>Harry and Bill just looked at each other, their faces alight with anger and pain on Neville’s behalf. What Dumbledore had done was inexcusable and he would pay.</p><p>
  <strong>‘As for Wormtail, he has already been dealt with, he wasn’t working for me the night your parents were killed. He was there on Dumbledore’s orders, he killed your parents Harry, not me, I showed up after, I shot a killing curse at him after I found your father and mother, I was there to speak with them as well, Lily had contacted me, she wanted to speak with me about the prophecy, she didn’t think it was real and had been trying to convince your father of that as well as her idea that Dumbledore wasn’t as light as they thought. I showed up just as your mother screamed and apparated to your nursery, I shot the curse at Wormtail but he moved, quicker than I ever thought he could because the curse hit you and rebounded on me that night. Your mother’s sacrifice protected you. When I came back, I didn’t remember what I know now, I was insane, it’s why I kept attacking you, it took me a while before I regained my sanity, don’t get me wrong, I’m still Dark, but I’m not evil, Dumbledore is.’</strong>
</p><p>Harry nodded to the Dark Lord and just sat there and thought for a few minutes. <em>Dumbledore has more to answer for than I thought. Not just the theft from my vaults, but my parents, Neville’s parents, are on his head. </em></p><p>Harry looked at his family and friends and explained to them what he was just told by Voldemort, Bill looked ill. His family has been following Dumbledore since before the first war and now to find out that he was pure evil, it was a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“2:15” replied Bill after casting a tempus. “Okay, lets head to Gringotts, the appointment is for 2:30, again I would appreciate it if all of you would join us in this meeting” Harry stated. Voldemort nodded and they began gathering around the portkey that they were sent after the arrangements were made. “Everyone grab hold of the blanket.” Harry whispered the password and they were swept away to Gringotts.</p>
