    <p>The street around the burnt out car was empty, deathly quiet, leaving the slight trail of smoke still coming off the destroyed vehicle to twist silently into the air, uninterrupted, the only movement visible to the human eye, had there been one to see it. The scene as it was, had not been so for very long, for just a few minutes previously, a battle to the death had been being fought, although even now, with the bloody remains of one loser splayed out across the side of the car, it would be hard to say who had won.</p><p>Eventually though, the silent stillness was broken by the sudden appearance of a man, at the other end of the street. He seemed to come out of nowhere, one moment not there, and the next he had almost fallen out of the air, stumbling to retain his balance. Once satisfied that the ground under his feet was solid, he straightened up and looked around, his gaze then immediately falling upon the still burning remains of the car.</p><p>Still as he was of now, if one were to observe him, he would be quite the oddity to most unacquainted with his sort. His hair was dark but had faded to a light grey at the tips, and it was very short, but what there was of it was sticking up in spikes, almost like that of the old punk-rocker style. He also had a greying curled moustache and a goatee, also curled, that perhaps didn't compliment his face so much, but did indeed accentuate his features. His eyes, had you been able to see them, were a piercing grey, quite unusual for that of a Korean man.</p><p>His clothes too were quite unusual, perhaps not in of themselves, but certainly when combined together into an outfit. He was wearing the remains of three piece suit, in slate grey with gold accents, although the waistcoat was missing and the jacket torn and ill-fitted to his frame. His boots were what you would probably call unnecessary, adorned with many buckles, few of which served a credible function. But most strangely of all was the cloak he wore around himself, that was purple and midnight blue, edged and adorned with yet more gold, with a scattered pattern of moons and stars across the main breadth of the fabric.</p><p>Seeing such a man, you would have thought him the self-important type, his riches and influence born and bred, rather than earned from the ground up. And you definitely would not have thought him the kind of man that would end up here, alone, harried and scared looking, the only witness to the aftermath of a gruesome murder.  </p><p>The stench in the air, as he hastily approached the car, was something quite indescribable. A foul, heady mixture of acrid smoke, sharp metallic blood and worst of all, burnt flesh, that caused the man to pull his cloak up to partially cover his nose and mouth, although it was of little help. But as far as he could tell, the car wasn't actually on fire, with the smoke coming from a few remaining embers of debris, blasted apart by anger induced magic.</p><p>He approached the car from it's left side, taking in the scene as it came to him. First was the body of a man, slumped against the open car door, his head lolling backwards onto the seat. His chest and neck had been partially obliterated, which was presumably the main source of the blood and burnt flesh scents and the reason, of course, for his death. The man looked a little more closely at the face of the corpse, and although he recognised him, felt rather indifferent to his death. After all, the two of them hadn't exactly been on good terms prior to this.</p><p>Turning away from the man's corpse, he reached for the handle of the front car door, opening it to get a better look at the second body, that was slumped forward in the car seat. This one was of a woman, one which he, rather more regrettably than the man, also recognised. For although he had suspected that she too would be dead, he couldn't help but feel disheartened by it, having thought that maybe she would've been spared. </p><p>However, there was something strange about the body of the woman, compared to that of her husband. For whereas he had obviously died fighting, she seemed to have died shielding something, protecting something, as he judged from the way she was hunched over, cradling something in her arms, hidden under her coat. Frowning slightly, the man reached forward to pull back the folds of her coat, and what he saw made his eyes visibly widen in shock.</p><p>Cradled in her arms was a young baby, that somehow, unbelievably, was still alive. For as he had uncovered it, it had started squirming and whimpering, scared and cold and in pain, afraid of the place and situation it now found itself in. Immediately a clash of conscience rose up inside the man. He knew the child, of course he did, for he had known her parents. But he had not been expecting, not by any measure of predictive power, to find her here, cradled in her dead mother's arms, and yet still alive herself. </p><p>Ridiculously impossibly alive.</p><p>Not really knowing what he should do, but feeling the intense need to do something, he reached gently under the woman's coat and extracted the baby from her arms, holding her in his own. He stepped away from the car, not wanting the baby to inhale anymore of the smoke, and walked a little way off to examine the child. She seemed remarkably unscathed from her ordeal, although she had quite a bad wound all the way down the right side of her face, something which he suspected was one of the main reasons why she was now crying. More out of practicality than compassion, he pulled his wand out from his jacket pocket and muttered a spell, which sealed up the wound, but left behind a long scar, ranging from just above the right corner of her eyebrow to down past her jaw.</p><p>"She'll have that forever..." he muttered to himself, visibly displeased by his own handiwork.</p><p>He glanced back over at the car, mulling over what to do. This child, he knew, was important, even more so now than ever before, due to her miraculous survival. And so the conflict within him came down to just one lingering question, a question that, in the way that he would eventually choose to answer it, would haunt him for many years to come. What was he to do with her?</p><p>For a long time he agonised over what to do, although looking back on it, he would always think that the time he had taken wasn't enough. That if only he had taken just a little <em>more</em> time, put in a little more thought, made a better, or- not better perhaps, but an <em>alternate</em> choice, then his future and indeed hers, would've been completely different. But even in the Wizarding World, you couldn't turn back time. And the decision he made on that night, no matter how much he would go over it in his mind, would never and could never be changed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Without really knowing why or when it had happened, Taeyeon was suddenly awake. She had been asleep, just seconds before it had seemed, and dreaming of strange things. Of smoke, and fire, and of a magical man appearing out of the gloom to whisk her away. She had had such dreams before, most often when she had been at her lowest when falling asleep, and their meaning always confused her. For when having then, they just seemed so real, almost to the point where she was even sure that she could smell the smoke in the air when she awoke.</p><p>Usually she couldn't wait until bedtime, the time where she could bury herself under her duvet and hide away from the world for a few hours, comforted by the fact that her tormentors (in the form of the other children in the orphanage) couldn't reach her here. But now that she had been so untimely awoken from sleep, she found that the covers were suddenly altogether too stifling, and she pushed them back slightly, basking in the coolness of the fore-dawn.</p><p>Squinting at the face of her slightly cracked wristwatch, she could see that it was just after five, far too early on a Sunday for anybody to be up yet. Sighing, she let her arm drop back against the pillow, as she stared up at the ceiling of the bedroom, her eyes slowly adjusting to the dark.</p><p>The bedroom in question was actually the smallest bedroom in the orphanage, something Taeyeon far from cared about as such was her luck that she only had to share it with one other person, a ten year old girl by the name of Tae-Li, a name she had given to herself. Taeyeon had learnt by secretively listening to the care workers conversations, that Taeli's real name was Sooyeon, but the girl herself would not respond to such a name, and having no parents to reinforce it, she had by and large, been allowed to keep up her false persona. </p><p>For Taeli was that sort of young girl that adults just seemed to live and let live, set free to experience her own fantasy world in her head, quite apart from her peers. And Taeyeon, although perhaps not to the extent that Taeli did, felt at kin to her in a way, sharing the role of the imaginary world being the one place she could always rely on to escape to, when the real world became that bit too frighteningly harsh and demanding.</p><p>And by any extension of the definition of the word, Taeyeon would've called Taeli her friend, or as close a resemblance to one as she could get. Or if nothing else, she was the only child in the orphanage that ever attempted to relate to Taeyeon, in the rare occasions when she wasn't locked away inside her own head. But Taeyeon didn't mind their near silent relationship so much. For it was nice to have that quiet sort of connection with someone, a friendship without the need for words or rough play. Although Taeyeon did suspect that she was less of a friend to Taeli, in the commonly accepted sense, and more so only her friend as a result of being a point of interest for the younger girl. For it was almost as if Taeli imagined her as some sort of descendant from a fantasy world, as different to those in the real world as she was, and so kept her around for seemingly that purpose alone.</p><p>For you see, for as long as Taeyeon had been aware of it, she had known that she was different, something that had been all the more imprinted into her by the constant and consistent bullying of her fellow orphans.</p><p>Taeyeon was old enough now to know that bullies preyed primarily on the different and on the weak, and it seemed just her misfortune that she was both. Physically, she was pretty much one of the smallest in the orphanage, even more so than the younger children, which made her a target of both ridicule and physical harm. Additionally, her nature was also one of a certain silent timidness, although this was more something she had adapted as a defence mechanism, rather than something she had a natural affiliation to.</p><p>In terms of different however, she had all those boxes ticked as well. Most notably was the scar on her face, something which in itself, she didn't dislike, but only wished that she didn't have due to the bullying she had suffered all her life at it's expense. The scar itself was reasonably prominent, ranging from a notch just above her right eyebrow, then down as a slash across her eye, to then curl off around her jaw, almost but not quite cutting into the bottom corner of her mouth. In a literary or cinematic content, such a scar would be beyond cool, and so Taeyeon rather liked it for this reason. But scars in the real world were, all the more piteously, far from being treated the same as the fictional characteristic of rugged and roguish handsomeness, that which Taeyeon so ideally envisioned possessing.</p><p>But with this quite individual physical difference, came also her personal differences, for she had always noticed that something about her seemed to be off, and this was something the other children seemed to have picked up on as well. And it was peculiar in the sense that it wasn't really something tangible, like her height, or her quietness, or her scar, but rather just a feeling, almost like some sort of aura if you will. And there just seemed to be this distinct sense of differentness that surrounded her, like a comical rain cloud over the head of a perpetually sad cartoon character.</p><p>And Taeyeon had noticed, in that way that young children often did, where adults chose to ignore them, that many strange things seemed to happen around her, when she was scared, angry, caught off-guard. </p><p>Sometimes she was sure that she could make things move, or disappear, or otherwise be manipulated, in ways which seemed to benefit her against her bullies. Or sometimes, when she was being chased, she somehow seemed to be able to keep just out of reach, or find a hiding place just in time, despite being far from the most physically fit occupant of the orphanage. And most strangely of all, there were even times when she seemed to be able to change the minds of the orphans and even the care workers, in situations where punishment was expected as a given, almost as if she had some unbeknown influence over them.</p><p>And although she usually dismissed these oddities as mere coincidences after the fact, part of her always wondered whether there was something greater at play behind all this, and that whatever it was played a big part in her assigned role as the outcast of the orphanage.</p><p>However, even if these strange occurrences had any basis outside of mere illusion, they still seemed few and far between for Taeyeon, as much more often than not, they did little to dissuade the torment inflicted upon her day in day out, by children who, most likely by little fault of their own, had developed a joyful predisposition for the persecution of those less fortunate than themselves.</p><p>On the whole, Sundays were usually the best day for Taeyeon to avoid the other children in the orphanage, for as a general rule, the care workers pretty much let them roam free throughout the neighbourhood, so long as they were back in time for meals, although skipping lunch in order to stay out longer was not exactly an uncommon occurrence. </p><p>So it was on Sundays, and often Saturdays as well, that Taeyeon spent the most time outside, for at least during the weekdays, there was school and homework to distract from her bullies. Whereas on the weekend, she became subjected to the full mercy of their boredom and natural disposition to threaten and abuse.</p><p>Taeyeon turned over, burying her face into her pillow to try and get back to sleep, but no matter how hard she tried, sleep frustratingly seemed to evade her. So with a barely constrained sigh, she threw back the covers and set about getting dressed.</p><p>Taeyeon was no stranger to sneaking out of the orphanage in the early hours of the morning, for not only was she quite often woken up at such times by strange dreams, but in leaving so early, she could usually avoid any pre-breakfast bullying that might occur, should she instead have chosen to stay in bed.</p><p>Her usual route for early morning escapes was climbing out of the small window at the end of the hallway on the second floor, an exit preferable to sneaking out of one of the lowers windows, for the orphanage was surrounded by a hedging and a gate set in the middle, which was looked at night, supposedly to protect the children inside, but Taeyeon knew well enough by now that it was more to keep them in than to keep anybody out. But exiting from this second floor window, she was able to climb across the windowsills and parapets of the outside of the orphanage and down to an overhanging tree which, if she judged it right, allowed her to climb across and over the part of the hedging that it grew next to.</p><p>She didn't spend long getting dressed, just hastily tugging on a pair of shorts and a loose sweatshirt (a faded yellow and blue striped affair, that was a hand-me-down from one of the older boys) and then tying the laces of her dirty, scuffed white trainers, that were long past their prime, but weren't quite destroyed enough to merit her being given new ones.</p><p>She did however, make sure to glance over at Tae-Li as she left, to check that she was asleep and wouldn't follow her out. But it wasn't that she thought that Tae-Li would go and tell a leader, or even that she wouldn't enjoy her company. Quite the opposite in fact. It was just that, right now, she felt like taking this trip alone.</p><p>By now, she was quite skilled in the art of sneaking out near silently, and made it up and over the hedge with marginal effort, and in what might've been record time, although of course, she had never timed it to make sure.</p><p>As it was still technically summertime, the sun had already begun to rise with the beginnings of an early dawn, bathing the streets outside the orphanage in a pale glow. But Taeyeon, wanting to get away from the residential part of town, headed off of the streets and round the back of the orphanage, which, if you kept walking for a few kilometres in an almost straight line, would soon open out into a grassy play area, which was sure to be empty at this time in the morning.</p><p>Heading to this play area during the day was somewhat of a coin toss for avoiding bullies, for if there were other small children and their mothers there, then she was guaranteed safety. But it was a chance game as to if there ever would be, and especially on days when she was extra tired, Taeyeon didn't often take this chance.</p><p>Once there, she took her perch on a swing, kicking gently back and forth at times, but mostly just sitting still and observing the area around her, her legs dangling in the air, slightly too short to be able to touch the ground. She was there for quite a while, not yet feeling like going back, or heading anywhere else, and it was lucky that she hadn't, for then she might well have missed the appearance of the owl.</p><p>She knew what it was, of course she did, for the beauty and complexity of the human mind was such that you could easily envision something in your head, even if having never seen it in real life before. But, as often was the case, the real thing was ultimately far more intriguing to Taeyeon than anything she could've imagined about it.</p><p>It had been rather a strange appearance, with the owl seemingly one minute not being there, and suddenly, it had been there, swooping down to land on the climbing frame opposite and slightly to the left of the swing set. Due to the speed and unexpected nature of it's arrival, Taeyeon hadn't had much time to look at it in flight, although she had been sure that she had seen something, pale and oblong, clutched in it's talons. But from it's position now, it was hard to see if her fleeting glance had been accurate.</p><p>The owl twisted it's head to face her, in that horror-movie sort of way that they were able to do, seeming not to move at all, just rotating it's head on a robotic-like axis. Taeyeon cocked her head to the side, staring at the owl, for she felt almost strangely certain that the owl was looking at her, or perhaps, more specifically, the owl had been looking <em>for</em> her. And it wasn't that anything about it had given her such an impression, but rather that she had just felt it, in the way that it was looking at her, almost as if it knew who she was.</p><p>And it was only a few seconds later that it took off from it's perch on the climbing frame and flew out of sight, but Taeyeon felt remarkably unnerved from the encounter. For the owl had behaved precisely how she would've expected a spy to do, keeping close tabs on her and then discreetly disappearing when spotted. And although it was ridiculous to even think such a thing, of course it was, the very concept of it just seemed so strangely applicable.</p><p>Glancing at her watch in the still paling light, mainly just for something to do, she saw that it was now close to seven in the morning, and decided that she should probably be getting back as very soon, the leaders would be waking up, and it wouldn't be too long before they began rounding up all the kids for breakfast.</p><p>She had to run to make it back in time, and when she got back, she saw that the front gate had already been opened, meaning that her absence was bordering on being discovered any minute. Taking a moment to catch her breath, she hurried inside and down to the dining hall, which thankfully, was only half full of children, which means her presence hadn't yet been missed and now, never would be.</p><p>Breakfast was uneventful, as it always was, for it was hard for any of the other kids to bully her when under the watchful eye of the care workers. But it was Eunjeong, one of the younger care workers at the orphanage, caught her as she got down from the breakfast table, and smiled slightly at her as she handed her a letter. Confused, Taeyeon began reading the front of it as she exited the dining room, and her mouth dropped open when she saw how it was addressed. </p><p>
  <em>Miss Kim Taeyeon, Jeonju State Children's Home, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do</em>
</p><p>Taeyeon was stunned. An actual letter, addressed to her? But from who?</p><p>The envelope itself was made of a peculiar textured paper, rough and yellowed, although now that she was examining it, she realised that there wasn't actually any envelope at all, it was just the letter itself, folded to resemble one, the address then written on the back. The writing was in cursive ink, the colour of deep sapphire, and Taeyeon couldn't imagine what sort of person, especially one who knew who <em>she</em> was, could've sent this to her.</p><p>But before she could so much as work her fingers underneath the join of the letter and unfold it to read, did a shadow fall over her and quicker than she could stop it, and hand shot out and snatched the letter from her hand.</p><p>Outraged, she glanced up to see Jisung, a boy of fourteen and one of her main bullies, striding ahead of her, making for the bottom of the stairs where all his friends were waiting for him. He had a mocking expression on his face as he read the front of her letter, and the boys on the stairs had a similar look about them, of great excitement at getting to watch their leader's latest display of assertion over his main victim.</p><p>"<em>You</em> got sent a letter, squirt?" he commented callously, already beginning to open it as Taeyeon watched on bitterly.</p><p>"What sort of headcase would ever want to send a letter to <em>you</em>?"</p><p>"Give it back." she said, moving closer to him and making a grab for it.</p><p>Jisung smirked and pushed the base of his hand against Taeyeon's forehead, holding her back as he held her letter high above her head.</p><p>"Ah, ah. Naughty kids don't get their way now do they?"</p><p>"Give it back, it's mine." Taeyeon snapped, characteristically impatiently, pushing Jisung's hand away and lunging at him, which caught him considerably off-guard and elicited an excited response from the rest of the watching boys at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>"My, my, you are angry today. Now just sit quiet okay?"</p><p>Jisung unfolded the letter and held it at his eye level, so that Taeyeon couldn't reach it without jumping. As he read, his expression contorted into a disbelieving smirk.</p><p>"What bullshit is this? Did you get Taeli to write this for you? Make you feel special?"</p><p>"Give it <em>back</em>."</p><p>Taeyeon's tone had no patience left in it as she jumped up to try and snatch the letter back, and ended up engaging in a tussle with Jisung, who of course, easily overpowered her, pushing her back and holding the letter high out of reach once more.</p><p>"Daeseong, Hajun, hold her for me would you?"</p><p>Two boys, both of which Taeyeon knew to be around the same age as herself, jumped up from the pack watching from the stairs, and each readily took hold of one of her arms, pinning it behind her to stop her from moving. Individually, Taeyeon knew they weren't that dangerous, and would usually leave her alone, but when under the influence of boys like Jisung, they would do anything, including beating up little girls it seemed, to impress them.</p><p>Taeyeon decided not to struggle against them, knowing it would only cause her more pain in the long run, and just stared in dismay as Jisung ripped the letter in half and then in half again, shedding the pieces of paper in his hands and then dropping them in front of her face, almost agonisingly slowly, taunting her as he smiled.</p><p>Trying not to cry, Taeyeon closed her eyes, wincing slightly and pushing back against her captors, fully expecting Jisung to start hitting her. But instead they just dropped her unexpectedly, so that she fell, scraping her knees slightly on the wooden floorboards, and she just caught Jisung's throwaway comment as the boys ran up the stairs, laughing.</p><p>"Fucking loony..."</p><p>Taeyeon, not in the mood to do much of anything after such an encounter, retreated to her bedroom immediately, which she was thankful to see was empty. For she was sure that even the invisible Tae-Li would have been too much of a strain on her nerves at that point. For the rest of the day she stayed up there, doing what little homework she had slowly and lethargically, and reading a little as well, tucking herself up under the covers of her bed, with just enough light filtering through to highlight the pages of her book.</p><p>She skipped lunch, but was forced to come down for dinner, although she choose to sit as far away from Jisung as she could manage, ending up with Taeli on her right and a high-chaired toddler by name of Yongseung on her left. Eunjeong, who was on meal duty that day, requested her help in feeding Yongseung his baby food, which Taeyeon did gladly, as it was a good distraction and gave her an excuse to stay after the others had gotten down from the table.</p><p>After dinner though, she found that Jisung had been waiting to berate her, and even gave chase when she managed to break free and run up to her and Taeli's bedroom, only escaping his grasp by slipping out from under him, using her small size to her advantage for once.</p><p>And come bedtime, her high running emotions had reached breaking point, and she found herself unable to stop from crying, although she attempted to stifle her sobs by burying her face into her pillow. But it seemed that she hadn't done so quite effectively enough, as it wasn't long before she heard Taeli's voice from across the room.</p><p>"Taeyeon-ah..."</p><p>Taeyeon sniffed hard and turned away from Taeli's gentle voice, pulling the covers up tighter over her shoulder and hiding her face within them. But Taeli, despite her usual nature of being blissfully oblivious to the feelings of others, refused to let this be the end of her efforts. Tucking her hands under the corner of the duvet, she eventually managed to wriggle under and press herself close to Taeyeon, who despite this, carried on resolutely ignoring her. </p><p>"Taeyeon-ah... why are you upset?"</p><p>Taeyeon gave a sort of annoyed huff, but eventually answered Taeli's question, although admittedly it was with one of her own.</p><p>"Why are you only asking now?"</p><p>Taeli paused for a moment, perhaps caught off guard with having to explain herself, for it was true that she didn't usually show much consideration for other people's feelings, not out of any sort of cruelty, but rather just because she never took the time to notice.</p><p>"Because... I have noticed that, whatever they say or do to you, you always seem to brush it off by bedtime. But not today. And you don't ever cry. I've never seen you cry before."</p><p>A small silence hung over the two of them, during which Taeli rested her chin in what maybe she hoped to be a reassuring way, on Taeyeon's shoulder, and eventually Taeyeon gave in, and told her what had happened, and why it had made her so upset.</p><p>"I got a letter in the post today and... I've never gotten one before in my whole life. But Jisung he... he ripped it up, before I even got to look inside. But what's worse is he read it- and he just disregarded it immediately. Like whatever someone had wanted to tell me was just some joke, almost like I written it myself just to give myself something to read." </p><p>Taeyeon's throat was a little choked up by now, but she forced herself to continue.</p><p>"What if it was someone who wanted to come back for me? An aunt or an uncle or my grandparents or even- maybe even my..." Taeyeon trailed off for a moment, before she finished with a mumble. "My parents..." She sputtered the next part of her sentence unintentionally angrily. "And surely even Jisung would know how important it is for a kid to know that someone is out there for them?"</p><p>Taeli took her time in replying, perhaps because she wasn't practised in the art of comforting someone who was upset, but reply eventually she did.</p><p>"Hey... listen. Whoever sent that letter to you obviously wants to make contact with you. So chances are, no matter what that letter said, they're probably going to come find you here one day. What's important is that there is someone out there, and they know that you're here."</p><p>Taeyeon sniffed hard once more.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Taeli nodded, the action only discernible by Taeyeon due to her face still being pressed comfortingly into the back of her shoulder blade.</p><p>"And Jisung is a dickhead in any sense, he's just trying to hurt you because of the fucked up way his brain works. Don't let him, please."</p><p>Taeyeon smiled very slightly at this, and reached back to tap Taeli on the nose, in what she hoped to be a scolding way.</p><p>"You shouldn't be swearing."</p><p>Taeli grinned back.</p><p>"I know. But sometimes, life calls for swearing."</p><p>Taeyeon smiled and reached down to ruffle Taeli's hair.</p><p>"Go back to bed you."</p><p>"Only if you promise to stop crying." Taeli replied, holding out her pinkie.</p><p>Taeyeon nodded and wrapped her pinkie round Taeli's, stretching her thumb up to press against hers, locking the promise in.</p><p>"I promise."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was late afternoon the next day by the time Jisung next found her alone, for Taeli had stuck close to her side for most of the day as protection, having only retreated upon the rather strict order by one of the care workers to do her homework, something which she often neglected to do. Unluckily for her, he had caught her off-guard, taking hold of her shoulders and pushing her hard against the wall, his characteristic devilish smirk wide and grinning across his face.</p><p>"Listen to me, Kim. I read your letter, on the stupid fancy paper, and all that bullshit about magic. What sort of stupid world have you conjured up in your head? This world not good enough is it? Well I suppose you have to make a world full of nutcases for you to live in, so you don't feel like such a loony yourself. You and that backward brained Taeli, you're both the same. Fucking retarded."</p><p>Taeyeon gritted her teeth together angrily.</p><p>"Don't you use that word about her, or anyone for that matter."</p><p>"Why, it's what you are. Wrong. In. The. Head."</p><p>With the emphasis of each word, he jabbed his finger at Taeyeon's forehead.</p><p>Grabbing her by the collar, he began dragging her over to the side of the staircase, where it was obvious he had planned to take her all along, for there were watching kids thronging the corridors and one holding open the door, that was the entrance to the small storage cupboard under the stairs.</p><p>"Com'n then, we all know about the magic of the back end of doors, so about you spend a night in there, see if it'll work for you, as you're so <em>special</em>. And maybe it'll turn into a <em>magic</em> door and whisk you away to your <em>magic school</em>. You and that freak you share your room with."</p><p>He pushed her hard and one kid stuck their leg out, so she tripped and fell into the cupboard, further antagonising the scrapes along both her knees. Already she was uncomfortable, having never liked cramped spaces, and this cupboard as about as closely confined as it was possible for it to be. But then Jisung kicked the door shut and locked it from the outside, trapping her in almost complete darkness.</p><p>Some of the kids outside began kicking the door hard, jeering with each kick, most likely hoping to further frighten her, but she just backed into the farthest corner and crouched, arms clamped over her head, just waiting for them to leave her alone. For as much of a fighter as she knew she could be, she also knew at what points it was best just to give up. And right now she was miserable and scared, and just wanted to be left alone so she could cry in peace.</p><p>But not a few seconds later, there was a loud thumping noise, something Taeyeon couldn't have even began to try and place, and the kicking and jeering stopped on the instant, only for a new set of noises to start up almost immediately in their place. She could hear muffled screams and shouts, and the sound of scuffling outside the cupboard, and when she looked up cautiously, she could see a curious sort of blue light, that was filtering into the tiny cupboard through the slight crack under the door.</p><p>And for a long moment that seemed somehow to suspend itself in time, Taeyeon was struck with a feeling of greater panic and disorientation even than before, at the prospect of such an unknown just outside the door of the space she was occupying.</p><p>And very suddenly, the door was kicked open, causing her to jump, and Taeyeon could see that it was splintered on it's hinges, having been completely broken through. She cowered away, covering her face with her hands, and for a few seconds, all she could see and feel was a raging heat and light, that both blinded and terrified her all at once. And when she finally managed to open her eyes and look upon the scene before her, she was confronted by something utterly unthinkable, the likes of which, she suspected, even Taeli couldn't have thought up.</p>
