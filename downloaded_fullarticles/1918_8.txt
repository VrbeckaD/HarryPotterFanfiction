          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale starts in the Gaunt household. Morfin and his muggle boyfriend who just so happens to be their neighbour have just told Merope that they know about her secret.</p><p>Merope gasped. "B-But how? Who told you?"</p><p>Morfin reassured her, "No one told us, Mer."</p><p>Merope turned to Tom with an accusing look and scowled. "It was you, wasn't it?"</p><p>Tom said, "Well, yes, but--"</p><p>Morfin interrupted him, "No one told him, he just figured it out."</p><p>Merope muttered, "Damn it, father is going to lock me up forever when he finds out."</p><p>Tom smiled. "You don't have to be scared, we're not going to tell your father."</p><p>Merope asked, "Then what do you want in return for your silence?"</p><p>Morfin smirked. "Nothing, silly. I'm your brother, I would never rat you out to anyone."</p><p>Tom added, "Plus you've been keeping our relationship a secret from him for so long, so think of this as us returning the favour."</p><p>Merope hugged them both and beamed, "You know, when I first heard about your relationship I laughed. I could never imagine my goofy, pureblood brother dating a muggle. But, you two were made for each other just like Issy and I."</p><p>Morfin grinned. "Who's Issy?"</p><p>Merope giggled. "That's a story for another time."</p><p>Tom replied, "I love you and your crazy little family, Morf."</p></div>
