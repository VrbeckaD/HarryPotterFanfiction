    <p>The cushions under his palms were soft and velvety, plush and full. His brown eyes darted around the room, taking in the possessions of one Mr. Percival Graves, who he had the pleasure of encountering that morning.</p><p>The two had run into each other as Charles received his wand permit and proceeded to chat. Percival asked if he'd arrived all right and they continued to make small talk after that, occasionally flirting until Newt Scamander appeared.</p><p>From then, Charles was intrigued as he spoke with Newt briefly about the differences between the Ministry of Magic in London and MACUSA's protocol. Percival recounted Newt's arrival and subsequent shenanigans, resulting in Newt's embarassment and bashful expression.</p><p>While Charles conversed with the Auror team Percival was in charge of, his mind was whirling at meeting the two very interesting men. He managed to set aside his burning curiosity and no small amount of attraction to focus on tactics and planning for Grindelwald's next move, but his focus only lasted until the day's end.</p><p>Once released, the Aurors dispersed and Charles himself planned to depart for his meagre, plain, and rather empty flat, when Percival had invited him over for drinks at his place.</p><p>That was how Charles found himself admiring the soft texture of deep scarlet cushions and squinting at a multitude of volumes on a nearby bookshelf.</p><p>Newt and Percival were in the kitchen, leaving Charles with the instruction to make himself at home. The most he'd done, aside from sit, involved shrugging his deep blue suit jacket from his lean frame. He was left in a crisp white button-up and matching tux, the Snallygaster cufflinks of his family glinting in the low light of the sitting room. </p><p>The two men returned not with brandy, as expected, but with tea. Newt handed Charles a cup before sitting in a nearby armchair. Percival sat next to Charles, his arm casually draped along the couch and near Charles' shoulders.</p><p>Charles resisted the urge to lean into him, sipping his tea instead. The question of the beverage seared itself in his mind like a branding, until he forced himself to ask, "So, tea? Not exactly the drink I had in mind."</p><p>Percival and Newt shared a look, the meaning of which Charles couldn't decipher, but seemed to communicate something the same.</p><p>Newt spoke this time, "Charles, well.. Percival and I wanted to ask you something. And we wanted to do so without anything like firewhisky clouding your judgement."</p><p>Charles felt his throat constrict. Surely Madame President Picquery had kept his identity confidential? It wasn't necessary to the issue of Grindelwald at hand nor to the interest of any wizard or witch, no matter how handsome these two appeared to be.</p><p>Before he could think much more on it, however, Percival spoke.</p><p>"Charles, we wanted to ask you --and please be aware it's perfectly fine to say no, neither Newt nor I will be offended-- if you'd be interested in being.." He searched for the proper word, his dark eyes flickering from Charles to the carpet and back again, "intimate with us?"</p><p>Charles felt warmth spread along his face and neck at that, thrown off balance by the request but certainly not displeased. He found himself speaking before thinking better of it, "Wow..uh, Percival, that sounds like an amazing offer, but.. why? I mean, if you and Newt are together, I thought it would be best if I maintained a friendship with you both rather than cause dysfunction in your relationship."</p><p>Percival laughed at that, "Oh, no, Charles. You see, Newt and I are fairly happy with sharing. Bear in mind, we don't often do this, but Newt mentioned he knew you from school and you're.. intriguing, to say the least."</p><p>Charles flushed further at the praise, but felt a sneaking suspicion at Percival's words. His gaze surveyed the room once again, noting the volume of <em>Hogwarts: A History, A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration</em>, and a book on Divination. Generally speaking, they were all books neither the Director of Magical Security nor Newt Scamander, both of whom Charles was aware were powerful and skillful wizards, needed.</p><p>The realization crept upon Charles until hitting him full force, "You two aren't the only ones here, are you?"</p><p>Again, Percival and Newt exchanged a look, though Percival's expression was more bemused while Newt muttered something that sounded suspiciously like 'nosy Slytherins' with a grin on his lips.</p><p>Percival nodded while Newt answered his question, "Credence Barebone, the young wizard who previously had an Obscurus in him, lives with us."</p><p>Percival added, at Charles' wary look, "I'm sure Madam President Picquery informed you of his newfound abilities and extraction of the Obscurus? He's a very talented young man, very much an asset to this war. And to the wizarding world itself; he's shaping up to be a very fine wizard indeed."</p><p>Charles didn't miss the fondness lacing Percival's voice like honey and his heart ached for such care to be brought on him. As though sensing this, Percival commented, "Of course, Newt's told me a bit about you, mainly from what Theseus has observed in the Ministry. He said you're a diligent worker, cunning, and a bit rebellious. You question the rules and plans for missions?"</p><p>Before Charles could respond, Percival continued, "I like that, Charles. And yes, Credence lives with me. He's currently at Tina Goldstein's home for dinner, although he knows you're here and he knows the offer we've made to you. He's perfectly okay with it, perhaps even interested if he met you, and the three of us --myself, Newt, and Credence-- are in a.. partnership, of sorts. We give and take what each of us needs."</p><p>Charles mulled over Percival's words, considering for a moment and sipping his tea. "So," he spoke after a minute or two, "you want me to be a part of your partnership?"</p><p>Percival's hand brushed his shoulder, then, a slight smile on his lips as he responded, "Well.. not yet, not if you don't want to. What Newt and I are asking you for tonight is.. just a bit of fun. On your say so, of course, and by your terms. If you're interested in doing certain things and not in others, let us know and we'll act accordingly."</p><p>Newt added, "Just a night of fun and naughtiness, really."</p><p>Charles chuckled at that, surprised to hear such words from Newt. He glanced back at Percival, nodding, "Alright, it could be fun."</p><p>While Percival waved his hand to return the tea set and mugs to the kitchen, Charles felt the familiar chilling wash of fear cascade over him.</p><p>"Although, Percival, there's something you ought to know.. I'm a wizard yes, but I'm what some here would call a 'switch.' Newt, Percival, I'm a trans man. I hope that doesn't complicate things?"</p><p>Percival smiled at that, "Oh, no, of course not, Charles. You're like any other man we know. Just be sure to let us know what you're comfortable and uncomfortable with. Should we have a safeword, then? To use if any of us wants to stop, for whatever reason."</p><p>Charles nodded, his heartbeat increasing as the reality of the situation became apparent. Still, excitement thrummed in his veins. "How about.. Snallygaster?" Newt suggested.</p><p>Charles chuckled at that, the word clearly derived from his cufflinks.</p><p>"Well," Percival began, "I suppose we're ready when you are, Charles."</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Shortly after their agreement, Newt rose to sit on the left side of Charles. Percival began carding his fingers through Charles' curly red hair, leaning in and pressing a soft kiss to his lips. Newt, meanwhile, trailed one hand from Charles' inner arm to his shoulder, the other up from his knee to his thigh. Charles felt a whine forming in his throat as Percival kissed him harder, his own hands starting the exploration of Charles' body.</p><p>Percival's palms swept up over his tux, fingers deftly unbuttoning the garment and sliding it off, leaving Charles in a slim white button-up that he desperately wanted off. Newt's mouth trailed down his neck as he helped Percival unbutton the shirt, both touching whatever skin they could reach. At the swipe of his nipples from Percival's calloused fingers, Charles gasped into his mouth. His hands fisted in the fabric of Percival's own shirt and he hoped, absentmindedly, they wouldn't mind the now faded scars under his pectoral muscles, though charms enhanced the sensitivity in his chest. Fine, curly red hairs dotted his chest as often as freckles did. His breath quickened as Percival trailed his right hand down, down, down.</p><p>Just when Charles felt he'd unravel, Percival's deep timbre spoke, "Tell me what you like, Charles."</p><p> Charles gasped, managing to choke out, "I-I like to be complimented. Um.. I don't mind the compliments being..erm.."</p><p>Percival assisted, then. "Dirty? Naughty?"</p><p>Newt, his fingers now wrapped in Charles' curls, spoke, "You want us to tell you what a good boy you are?"</p><p>Charles' heart leapt at those words, desire pooling deep in his belly. He nodded vigorously in response, though Percival returned to kissing him, effectively cutting off anything he could have verbally said.</p><p>He shivered as his shirt was pushed from his torso to join his tux on the floor. His body ached to be touched more, by both men's hands, and a wash of eagerness to please swept over him dizzingly.</p><p>Before he could properly process the action, Percival had slid his black slacks from his hips, leaving him in a slim pair of boxers.</p><p>"Beautiful," he whispered, dark eyes alight with pleasure and, Charles hoped inwardly, awe.</p><p>With his leaner frame and slighter figure, Charles conceded he wasn't the most handsome man, but he hoped the muscles in his arms and thighs made up for the lack of space he failed to take up. He had a fair few collections of battle scars, ranging from thinner, whiter ones curling on his ribs to deeper ones wrapping around his calves and hips. They had healed, of course, and retained some feeling, but Charles knew from experience that not everyone liked them.</p><p>Percival, however, seemed unbothered and glanced up at Charles after breaking off a lingering kiss, "May I touch them?"</p><p>Charles, his chest feeling a bone-deep ache he thought he'd left behind when he was younger and more naive, replied, "Yes, go ahead."</p><p>Newt stilled at the sight of his scars, before continuing to trail his hands down Charles' chest. His fingers traced circles on his skin and the hair on his navel, a much darker red than the locks atop his head.</p><p>Percival lightly traced the scars on his ribcage before following the exploration with his lips. At the first brush of lips, Charles gasped and resisted the temptation to arch his body upward. Percival chuckled against his skin, but didn't halt his journey. He continued until he got down to Charles' boxers, where his fingers playfully slipped under the waistband, "Can I touch you?"</p><p>"Touch, yes," Charles breathed, "But I'd prefer if you kept your..erm.. mouth from there. I mean, I'm okay with my.. arse, but not-- not---"</p><p>Charles grasped for the words, heat licking his skin as he fell further and further into the throes of embarassment.</p><p>"You don't want me to lick your cock?"</p><p>Charles laid his head backward, landing on Newt's shoulder. He was equally flustered and aroused, a mixture of emotions he wasn't unfamiliar with. "N-no, yeah.. but I'd be.. I'd love to--" He stared at the ceiling, determined to voice what he wanted, "--lick yours. Both of yours."</p><p>Percival seemed surprised by the admission, before looking pleased as he tugged the boxers down. "Well, I'm certainly ready for that. I'm sure Newt is, too," Percival commented in an almost conversational manner. True to his word, Charles could spot the bulge in Percival's dress pants and feel the one in Newt's as he pressed against the other.</p><p>He dove happily into Percival's next kiss as his hand slid from his navel to his cock, a small thing, but pulsing with desire all the same. Charles let out a low moan as Percival rubbed him, lifting the skin with his fingers.</p><p>"You're already so wet for us," Percival purred. Newt shifted against Charles, halting in his exploration. Charles, face flushed and drunk on pleasure, turned his head from Percival to Newt, eyeing the sizeable bulge in his trousers.</p><p>"Newt, can--can I?" Charles stumbled in his question, eyes lidded.</p><p>"Can you what, darling? Tell me," Newt replied, voice soft yet commanding.</p><p>"Can I.." His eyes darted down to Newt's pants, "Please, Newt, can I..?"</p><p>Percival chuckled then, his hand working to rub Charles' small cock in his boxers. "Newt, don't tease him so much. He wants your cock, give it to him."</p><p>Newt, blue eyes now on Percival, said nothing, but stood and unzipped his trousers. The sight of his sizeable member, now in full view, free from his trousers and boxers, while he remained in his tux and shirt, resulted in Charles' squirming against Percival's skillful hand.</p><p>"Can we get these off, Charles?" Percival murmured, slowing in his movement. Charles nodded his assent, the boxers joining the rest of his clothes on the carpet. He heard Percival take a sharp breath and, for a moment, feared the worst. His fear was for naught, however, as he saw the hungry look in Percival's gaze. "<em>Merlin</em>, Charles, you're gorgeous," Percival whispered breathlessly.</p><p>Charles was certain by now that his skin matched his hair in its redness, but didn't have time to ponder the thought much longer as Newt took a step forward, his erection a lushous rosy pink at the head. Charles' mouth salivated of the idea of it in his mouth and didn't delay in giving the head a tentative, miniscule lick.</p><p>"Here," Percival said, having watched the exchange and gripping Charles' hips steadily, "Let's get you flipped over, yeah?"</p><p>Charles obediently turned to rest on his knees and palms on the sofa, goosebumps rising from his skin as Percival's hand trailed down his spine to his arse. Newt stepped in front him, charming the couch to elongate and allow room for him to kneel on the cushions in front of Charles.</p><p>Charles took in the sight of Newt's erection in front of him, looking into Newt's gaze as he wrapped his pink lips around the head. Newt let out a gasp and his hand shot up to dig into Charles' curls, before darting back hastily. "Oh, Charles, I'm sorry! I should have asked--" Newt began to apologize, before Charles cut him off by bringing his hand back to his hair.</p><p>"I can tug on it?" Newt asked, to which Charles replied with a nod, sinking his mouth further down on Newt's cock. He reached a little over halfway before he started gagging, hurriedly remembering to breathe through his nose and determinedly attempting to take in more. Newt, lost in the sensation, failed to notice until looking back down, where he pulled back from Charles' throat and flushed lips. "Charles! Are you alright?" He asked as Charles took in a deep breath.</p><p>"I'm--I'm alright," he reassured Newt, part of his mind distracted by the teasing finger Percival circled around his hole. He began kissing Charles' arse cheeks, starting from his tailbone and moving to each in turn. From the tingling of his arsehole, Charles guessed Percival cast a cleaning spell before brushing his lips, feather light, against his hole.</p><p>Charles felt his legs shake slightly and, taking great effort, told Newt, "I can handle it, Newt. I want it."</p><p>Thrown off momentarily by the near desperation in his voice, Newt nodded. His hand raked through Charles' hair and he stated, "Alright, just tap my leg twice if you need air or want to stop, okay?"</p><p>Charles gave him a grin, taking his cock back into his mouth before Newt could say anything else. Just as he sank the remaining few inches of Newt's erection down his throat, swallowing and trying not to think too hard about the wetness that escaped his mouth, Percival asked, "Charles, can I rim you?"</p><p>Not expecting such forwardness or the question, Charles nearly choked and tapped Newt's leg twice before he slid his erection from Charles' mouth, eliciting a slight whine from Newt's lips. Percival shot him an apologetic, if bemused, grin, waiting for Charles' reply.</p><p>"I-I.. <em>Merlin, yes</em>," Charles managed to say before resolutely returning to Newt's cock. Once again buried to the hilt, Charles noted the musky taste that was Newt's and the rapid breathing coming from his chest. At the first swipe of Percival's tongue over his arsehole, Charles groaned around Newt's cock. He moved up and down the length, swirling his tongue as much as he could while not wanting to completely let go of Newt's erection. Soon, Percival had his tongue tracing circles around Charles' arsehole and his hands kneading his arse.</p><p>Coming up briefly for air before taking Newt's erection again, Charles cried out, though the sound was muffled, as Percival buried his tongue in his hole. He squirmed at the feeling, hot and heavy. Newt, much to his dismay, guided his mouth off his cock and met it with his lips. They kissed for a few minutes, all the while Percival's wicked tongue inside him.</p><p>"I want to be inside you," Newt muttered against his lips, giving his cock a stroke or two that sent jolts of pleasure surging in Charles' veins at the sight.</p><p>"<em>Please</em>," he begged, a note of desperation in his tone.</p><p>Newt smiled at that, a brilliantly beauitful smile that seared itself into Charles' mind. After undressing, he glanced at Percival, who had been listening in, and subsequently halted his movements to lift Charles up and allow Newt to lay underneath him.</p><p>Once positioned with Charles' palms on Newt's chest facing the door to Percival's flat, and Percival kneeling in the same spot Newt had, both men continued their previous actions. Percival's tongue once again entered Charles while Newt guided his cock to Charles pink hole, teasingly rubbing his cock as he went.</p><p>Percival, by now, had cast a charm for lubrication and worked one finger inside Charles' arsehole. As he pushed the second in, Newt's cock fully entered his other hole. He moaned openly then, not missing the praise from both of them as Percival said, "Such a good boy, Charles, taking Newt's cock like that. And taking my fingers, too."</p><p>Newt, eyes screwed shut with pleasure, let loose a string of praise, "Oh, Charles, you feel <em>so</em> good. I loved your mouth on me, Charles, your lips and you moan so prettily."</p><p>Charles keened as Percival added a third finger, stretching and working him open. His head fell next to Newt on the cushions, buried in the velvet as he imagined the pleasure they were giving him as a raging fire consuming him, burning him deliciously and wholly alive. Percival, who shrugged out of all his clothes save for his shirt as Charles noticed from a quick glance, straightened and leaned up, grasping his hard cock in his hand and stroking it once or twice.</p><p>Newt continued to move inside Charles gently, rolling his hips and keeping his thrusts light, though he stilled as he saw Percival line the head of his cock to the reddened hole of Charles' arse. Charles whined at the loss of movement, but pressed back against Percival's cock.</p><p>"You want my cock, Charles?" Percival spoke in a deep, rich voice that reverberated through his very bones. "Want to be a good boy for me and Newt? Take our cocks at the same time?"</p><p>Charles whined again, a high pitched thing that he would be embarassed about if he were in any fit state, but all he cared for in that moment was having both men inside him.</p><p>"<em>Merlin</em>, I want it. Please, Percival, give it to me. Give me y-your cock," he begged, Newt leading his face up to kiss him.</p><p>"There's a lad," he whispered just as Percival pushed in.</p><p>Though there was a slight sting, after a few shallow then deeper thrusts, the pain faded into pleasure and Charles enjoyed the feeling of Percival filling him up.</p><p>He broke the kiss with Newt, trying to push back on his cock. "Newt," he grumbled, "<em>Move</em>."</p><p>Newt, surprised at his tone, followed his instruction and Charles nearly wept in relief at being filled up by Newt and Percival.</p><p>Percival, meanwhile, had grabbed a fistful of his hair and tugged sharply. "Is that any way to speak to the wizard who gave you such a nice, thick cock to suck on, Charles?"</p><p>Charles, unexpecting of the action but not opposed to it, gasped and hurriedly spoke, "N-no, sir. S-sorry."</p><p>Percival growled as his thrusts gained speed, "Thank Newt for giving you his cock, Charles. Be a good boy and thank him."</p><p>Charles, his hair still clenched in Percival's fingers though the grip loosened some, moaned and managed to thank Newt, "Newt, t-thank you, thank you for fucking me."</p><p>Newt groaned in response, his own hand rubbing over Charles' neglected nipples. Percival's free hand slid down Charles' cock, rubbing it in time to match his and Newt's quickened thrusts. He brought Charles closer to him, whispering against his ear, "Good boys get rewards, Charles. You've been a good boy, haven't you? Taking our cocks like a nice little Auror. You like being fucked hard, don't you, Charles?"</p><p>He was unable to respond as he became lost in the pleasure, in the brutal fucking of his holes by Newt and Percival and the wash of praise sweeter than any compliment. Percival licked the rim of his ear before trailing down his neck, sucking bruises that gave Charles shivers.</p><p>As they continued to thrust at a rapid pace and Percival rubbed his cock, not one of three men noticed the door to the flat opening nor the quiet gasp as the figure took in the scene.</p><p>Percival, though, looked up from Charles' now purpled neck, spotting Credence standing in the doorway. He lifted the hand in red curls to flick and shut the door, but otherwise didn't halt in his movement.</p><p>Charles, confused by Percival's removal of his hand, glanced up to see Credence. Unfortunately, Newt gave a particularly deep thrust at the same time and left Charles moaning and murmuring, "<em>Oh, fuck.</em>"</p><p>Percival, unperturbed by Credence's surprised expression, breathed out, "Credence, you're home. I hope your dinner was lovely. Would you care to join us?"</p><p>At Credence's hesitation, Percival added, "Charles here is a very good boy, willing to suck you off, I bet. Of course, there's no need to join us if you really don't want to, baby."</p><p>Charles, admitting Credence didn't have to join, was still upset by the idea of Credence returning to Tina's house or another room. Truthfully, Charles had wanted to meet him and now that he had, he was drawn to the young man. His short black hair gleamed in the low light of the sitting room and his dark eyes darted from Newt to Charles to Percival with barely concealed curiosity and arousal. He looked very lovely indeed to Charles.</p><p>Charles knew, from the moment he laid his eyes on Credence, he wanted him.</p><p>"<em>Please</em>," he murmured, voice strained from moaning, "Please, Credence.. let me suck your cock."</p><p>At the request, Credence's previous hesitation crumbled into dust as he swiftly approached the couch. Charles spotted the noticeable strain of Credence's cock against his slacks and he moaned as Credence unzipped them. His cock was guided from Credence's slacks and boxers with his hand, just as pale as he was. The head was flushed a lovely pink and already had beads of precome on it. Charles leaned forward to swipe his tongue over the slit, the salty, bitter taste of semen a growing familiarity on his tongue. He revelled in Credence's pleasured sigh before taking him into his mouth, hollowing out his cheeks as he neared the base. He eventually had his nose buried in the hair around the base of Credence's cock and moaned around it as Percival's pace quickened further.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, was groaning and gasping for pleasure. Charles, determined to have Credence finish with them, hurried his own pace on Credence's lovely cock.</p><p>From somewhere, Charles heard a voice, one he suspected was Newt's, or maybe Percival's, mutter, "My boys, my sweet boys.. Charles, you're taking Credence's cock so good. You look so handsome, such a good lad for us."</p><p>Percival leaned close to Charles' ear, whispering sweet nothings, "Merlin, Charles, you take it so good. You look so at home swallowing Credence's cock like that. You like Newt and I buried inside your holes, don't you?"</p><p>Charles moaned, drawn out and heavy, around Credence's cock. Credence had the forethought to warn him, "C-Charles, wait, I'm going to-- <em>I'm gonna</em>--"</p><p>His words died on his lips, however, as he came down Charles throat. Eager to please and far too happy he was able to suck Credence off, Charles did his best to swallow all the semen.</p><p>Newt grunted underneath him, his thrusts becoming more and more frantic as he heard Credence's moans and mumbled words.</p><p>He came, buried deeply, inside Charles, his cock pulsing with aftershocks. Charles cried out at the warmness and fullness with Percival's own cock hard and heavy in his arse.</p><p>He leaned in again to Charles, giving his hair a viscious tug as he ground out, "Charles, <em>baby</em>, be a good boy and come for me, <em>come for me, baby</em>."</p><p>And that was all it took as Charles' orgasm crashed through him, wave after wave of pleasure as he clenched around both Newt and Percival's cocks, with Newt releasing another, though smaller, load of semen into him. Similarly, Credence came once again, though his come landed mostly on Charles' lips and chin as he was too far gone to swallow.</p><p>Percival was the last to come, his orgasm shaking him and release spilling into Charles' arse.</p><p>The pleasure was nearly overwhelming, but Charles was undoubtedly sedated and pleased at being filled with both men's release.</p><p>Eventually, everyone was spent and collapsed on the couch in the case of Newt and Charles and an armchair, in the case of Percival and Credence.</p><p>Once they had rested enough to catch their breath, Percival gave Newt a lazy grin, Credence snuggled up in his arms and close to sleep. Likewise, Charles was captured in Newt's embrace and nearly in slumber, though conscious enough to catch Percival's words and Newt's agreement.</p><p>"Newt, I think we should keep him."</p><p>His heart leapt joyously at the prospect, but before he could say yes, Charles fell into the arms of slumber.</p><p>He was certain he'd sleep soundly, then.</p>
