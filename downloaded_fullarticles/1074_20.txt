    <p>Draco stared at the parchment in front of him, struggling to find the words that came so easily to him a moment ago. Evidently, he blamed it on the noise. As more Muggles poured into the coffee shop, he scowled at their incredible loudness. It was 10 AM on a Saturday, so perhaps it was his fault for assuming there would be no people around. Still, he preferred the loud noise of Muggles than anything he would experience in Hogsmeade, which was full of Hogwarts students and wizards he went to school with who couldn’t get over the war.</p><p><em>How about this, </em>he thought to himself, ‘<em>Dear Pansy, I received your letter and can’t wait to see you-‘, no it sounds all wrong. </em><em>What about, ‘Dear Pansy, I’m so glad you’re back, I hope we run into each other soon-‘, Definitely not. </em><em>But what if I write-</em></p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his name being called. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise to him that he would see her here, especially since she just moved into a flat not far from his place. Even so, when he saw her standing in front of him, he was at a loss for words.</p><p><em>You’ve changed, </em>the words died in his throat before he could utter them out. He knew she would take them the wrong way, anyways. She <em>did</em> change, there was no doubt about that, but it wasn’t a bad different. She looked beautiful, mature- not at all like the young girl he had once taken to the Yule Ball.</p><p>"Draco…it’s so good to see you again.” She smiled at him softly, and he was slightly dumbstruck until he snapped out of it and pulled her in for a quick hug.</p><p>She felt warm and soft, just as he remembered, although he did notice she was wearing a new perfume that smelled overwhelmingly like lavender, “Pans…I’m sorry I didn’t write sooner.”</p><p>She sat down across from him, noticing the way her long dark hair flowed in waves behind her back, “It’s water under the bridge now. Besides, I knew you were going through a lot.”</p><p>Merlin, was <em>that</em> an understatement. He said nothing though, sipping his overpriced cappuccino silently.</p><p>“Have you kept up with the others much?” She asked, and for a moment he was confused. Up until recently, he hadn’t kept up with much of anyone.</p><p>“Well, Crabbe is dead, Goyle has fell off the face of the Earth, Blaise is always busy with work, Millicent barely talks to anybody, and I haven’t kept in contact with Theodore much.”</p><p>Pansy hummed, “I hardly kept in contact with anyone, save you and Blaise. America is <em>so</em> boring compared to here.”</p><p>Draco held back a snort, “I can only imagine.”</p><p>“South America was definitely a favorite of mine, although I couldn’t stay long. Oh! And I made a stop in Canada as well, it was quite something…”</p><p>They talked for more or less half an hour, mostly about Pansy’s journeys and casual chatter about how much has changed for the both of them. One thing they didn’t talk about was the war. It was a delicate subject for both, for obvious reasons, but he could tell that for Pansy, being back in London was making her antsy. He noticed how every time the tiny bell on the door chimed, she would turn her head minutely, as if he would not notice.</p><p>“So you’ve got yourself a flat around here, yeah? I’m surprised you didn’t buy a wizarding home.” Draco sipped at the last of his drink, before wiping his mouth with a carefully folded napkin.</p><p>“Don’t be daft, Draco.” She gave him a look to which he only shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“Yes, it’s actually just down the block from here. I’m having a bit of trouble trying to set up a Floo address there, but hopefully it should be done soon,” She paused, “Perhaps you can come to visit me then.”</p><p>He offered her a meaningful smile, “Of course I will, Pans.”</p><p>“Maybe we could even get the gang back together for a night of drinking.” She grinned at the idea.</p><p>He chuckled, “I haven’t seen Blaise piss drunk in ages. I wonder if he still acts like a prat every time he drinks, or if he’s finally grown out of it.”</p><p>"I wonder if Blaise is still going steady with that one girl. Oh, what was her name? Mary? Maria?”</p><p>Draco snickered, “Something like that, and I doubt it. He’s far too busy for relationships, from what he’s told me.”</p><p>“And what about you?” She waggled her eyebrows at him, “Is there a witch that’s finally caught your eye?”</p><p>The pleasant feeling in his stomach dipped at the question. He hadn’t told her yet and now he has to tell her in a Muggle coffee shop? After not seeing her for three years? <em>Seriously? </em>I mean it’s not as if he was ashamed, he’s gotten over that long ago, but this was definitely <em>not </em>how he wanted to tell her.</p><p>Draco rubbed the back of his neck while his face burned a scarlet red, “Ah, well, you see – the thing is…”</p><p>Pansy guffawed at his effort, startling him and leaving him unable to finish his testimony.</p><p>“Oh thank <em>Merlin</em> you’ve finally figured it out,” Her loud, boisterous laugh caused a few Muggles to turn their heads around, but it didn’t stop Pansy from being as loud as ever.</p><p>Draco was both horrified and utterly confused, “I bed your pard-”</p><p>“My dear, we’ve ALL known for quite some time. Years even.” Her cackling turned into small giggles, but her face was still as amused as ever.</p><p>“How?” He asked, puzzled, “I’ve only accepted it myself quite recently.”</p><p>Pansy smirked, “Come on Draco, no straight man puts <em>that</em> much effort into his appearance.”</p><p>As scandalized as he was, he couldn’t help the small tug at the corner of his lips, giving into the slightest smile.</p><p>“<em>Seriously</em> Draco, we thought you’d never figure it out. With all that stalking Potter, vying for his attention- “</p><p>His face dropped and his eyes darkened. Among one of the unspoken things they were <em>never</em> supposed to talk about, Harry Potter was damn near the top of that list.</p><p>Pansy must have sensed this as she immediately bit her tongue and stammered an apology.</p><p>“I…I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…” She trailed off, after realizing he wouldn’t say anything.</p><p>The mood changed, and after that, neither of them could carry on the conversation. She knew better than to talk about him, knew how sensitive of a subject it was. Still, he couldn’t blame her. He even felt a bit of guilt seeing how quickly she tucked her tail between her legs, like a kicked puppy.</p><p>After that, a moment of silence ensued where neither one of them knew what to say next. It lasted for nearly a minute until Pansy hesitantly took her leave, with a promise at her lips to meet up again soon. He hoped she meant it.</p><p>He sat there for a moment, with an empty coffee cup in hand and his pride feeling a bit wounded. As he stood up, grabbing his coat, he saw the parchment on the table, with only <em>Dear Pansy </em>written on it. Eventually, he crumpled it up in his hands and threw it away as he walked out onto the streets.</p><p> </p><p>~~~ </p><p>Later in the afternoon, he went to the Manor to have tea with his mother. He tried to visit as often as he could, but once a week was all he could muster when every step he took into the Manor made him want to jump off a bridge.</p><p>For the first 6 months or so after the war, he had no choice but to stay at the Manor until his trial approached. After the trial had ended, he no longer found it in him to stay in that wretched house. It was his childhood home, the only place he’d ever really known besides Hogwarts, but the war ruined them both for him and he found himself tired of it all. After that, he packed up his things, wrote a letter to his mother, and settled in a small loft in a Muggle neighborhood in London. It was a simple life, one that his family could not understand, but one he was content with. He didn’t need the same things he thought he did before the war, and certainly didn’t want the same things. For the first time in his life, the Muggle world seemed much more favorable than the Wizarding world for that fact alone.</p><p>As he stepped into the Manor, he was unsurprised to feel the massive headache that often accompanied him on these visits. He tried not to think of the horrible memories threatening his sanity as he passed the hallowing hallways into his mother’s parlor, which seemed to be the only room in the house that the Dark Lord didn’t corrupt. That didn’t surprise him; his mother greatly prided herself in keeping this room to herself, as if it was her little secret getaway from the dreadful events this house had endured.</p><p>“Draco dear, shut the door, would you?” His mother had failed to look up from whatever it was she was reading.</p><p>Draco complied, shutting the door, and taking the seat opposite of her. The furnace burnt hot and the flickering flame illuminated his mother’s silhouette. He looked to his right to see his tea was already poured for him on the side table.</p><p>“What’s that you’ve got?” He wasn’t necessarily curious but needed to say something just so that they wouldn’t sit there in silence, as they’ve done before.</p><p>“This,” Narcissa sighed, “is a letter from your father.”</p><p>Draco stiffened, “What does he want?”</p><p>Her eyes shifted over to him, narrowing a bit, “He’s in Brussels. He sends his regards.”</p><p>Draco hummed, staring off in the distance at some ornate painting of the Malfoy family, back when they were happy. Lucius looked as stern as ever, but young Draco was smiling a bit as he looked up to his mother, and for a moment they shared a glance with a glint of something in their eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place.</p><p>“Brussels, is it? I thought he was in Switzerland.”</p><p>Narcissa shook her head, still reading the letter intently, “As did I. It seems his business is taking him elsewhere.”</p><p>Draco fought hard not to scoff in front of his mother. His ‘business’ meant trying to rebuild the Malfoy name from the 6 foot grave it was dug under during the war, while staying as far away from Wizarding London as best as he could, lest the Aurors get a hint of whatever malicious plan he has yet to accomplish. From what it sounded like, he was trying to increase their influence elsewhere, if worse came to worst and staying at the Manor was no longer an option. Had Draco been the same person he was three years ago, this would have mattered a great deal to him, and he would likely have joined his father in his endeavors. The thought was now laughable to Draco in numerous ways.</p><p>“I saw Pansy today. Pansy Parkinson. Do you remember her?” Draco blurted out without really meaning to.</p><p>“Parkinson,“ Narcissa looked deep in thought, “A pure blood family. Is she spoken for?”</p><p>Draco wanted to gouge his eyes out. Of course that’s what she was concerned about.</p><p>“No, and I have no intention of being anything other than her friend.” His tone was biting, and for good reason.</p><p>Narcissa finally put down the letter to look at him, hard and unwavering. This look would have intimidated a younger Draco, but he was a man now. He was tired of living up to impossible expectations.</p><p>“Draco…” She sighed, sounding exasperated of having to continue this conversation again.</p><p>He knew what she was going to say. ‘Draco dear, you have a duty to your family and our name. You can have as many hush-hush side romances as you want, but you need to carry on the Malfoy line blah blah blah’. He’s had this conversation more than once and was <em>not </em>willing to have it again.</p><p>“Do we <em>really</em> have to have this conversation again, mother?” He looked at her pointedly.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed but she relented. Relaxing back in her chair, she sat there, saying nothing. It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence, but one that Draco found he actually didn’t mind. He preferred sitting there in silence than being chastised over things he could not control.</p><p>When he came out to his mother, he was surprised to find that she didn’t care much, but his <em>father </em>on the other hand, well…that was a different story. His father wasn’t around the Manor long enough to actually be there in person when Draco told him, so he had to settle for a letter.  He wasn’t sure what to expect, but what he definitely wasn’t expecting was to be ignored completely. His mother prevented him from being disowned, as long as he married a pure blood witch, then he could have as many liaisons as he wished. That <em>was</em> the Malfoy way. Even still, his father barely talked to him as it was, so nothing really changed much. Perhaps it was for the best, Draco thought, that their relationship could never go back to the way it was.</p><p>As they sat in silence, it bitterly reminded Draco how once, long ago, he would have done anything for his parents’ approval. And then Lucius allowed the Dark Lord into their home, and all of a sudden, Draco didn’t see much of a reason to want to be like him anymore.</p><p>After a long while of sipping tea in silence, Draco stood, dusting himself off, “Thank you for the tea, mother. It’s been delightful as always.”</p><p>Although his tone lacked sincerity behind it, Narcissa still stopped him from leaving when she called his name out.</p><p>He turned, to find her with a genuine look of affection on her face, making the guilt seep deeply into his stomach, “My dear, please do take care of yourself.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>With that, he walked out of the door, not waiting for the house-elf to escort him there, until the Manor was far out of view.</p>
