    <p>Sirius Black opened his tired eyes and let out a groan as he looked around his prison cell. Sirius let out a shaky sigh as he closed his eyes once more. However, when he opened them the door to his cell opened. <em>‘What the hell? That door never opens what’s going on?’ </em> He wanted to say but he could not find his voice. Then to his surprise, the door opened. In the doorway. Stood a guard, not a dementor but a human guard.</p><p>“Black,” he said as he walked into the room. Sirius did not look at him when he pulled him to his feet. Sirius did not even struggle. He knew that his time was up and he’s giving up.</p><p><em>‘Good-bye Moony, Harry. I’m sorry everyone.’ </em> Sirius thought helplessly. However, when Sirius was pushed into a room, he did not see a dementor but Dumbledore and some Aurors in the room. Sirius wanted to ask what was going on, but he did not have a voice. However, the guard says two words that made Sirius’s eyes fill with tears:</p><p>“You're free,” with that the guard undid the bounds on Sirius’s hands. Sirius started to cry but it was silent because he did not have a voice.  Sirius gave the minister a look that says. ‘Now and can I raise Harry?’ Dumbledore nodded. This made Sirius smile for the first time in five years. Sirius coughed and rasped out:</p><p>“Really,” Sirius coughed more. Everyone watched.</p><p>“I think you need to get to the hospital first Sirius and then we can make arrangements to bring Harry home with you,” Sirius nodded weakly as he sat down in a nearby chair as he started to cough again.  “An Auror will take you as quick as posable,” an Auror nodded and helped Sirius to his feet. Dumbledore watched as they both were gone with a pop.</p><p>              Sirius passed out once he got to the hospital. The Auror, Sirius never knew his name helped him to one of the healers around the lobby. “I need help,” he said calmly as he looked at Sirius who was unconscious in his arms.</p><p>“What’s his name?” the healer asked. The Auror let out a sigh and said:</p><p>“Sirius. Sirius Orion Black,” the healer steps back away from the Auror.</p><p>“Why is……….is he out of Azkaban?”  The Auror sighed.</p><p>“He’s innocent. I found out this morning. Now we need to help him. He passed out and injured. I think,” The healer nodded and walked over to the front desk and told the lady what happened. She nodded as she waved her wand and said:</p><p>“Man is passed out bring healers,” with that the Patronus nodded and ran into the back. “They will be out soon,” the Auror nodded and looked at Sirius in his arms.  A few minutes later healers came out and took Sirius’s out of the Auror’s arms and carried him into the back.</p><p>It took hours to find out what was wrong with him and it took even more to fix him. When they were done Sirius was out cold. The wizard did not move at all. Meanwhile, a very worried and sick looking Remus Lupin arrived in the hospital lobby. The werewolf let out a shaky sigh and walked over to the front desk. He then cleared his dry throat and said: “I’m here to see Sirius Black,” Remus needed to see his friend. He still can’t believe that it was Peter and not Sirius. he really needs to see him and apologize to him. The person at the desk nodded sadly.</p><p>“Yes, you may see him. However, he’s asleep right now. You can ask his healer when he will wake. You can still see him though,”</p><p>Remus nodded weakly. The full moon was the night before. He knows that he should be in bed but when he heard that Sirius was innocent. Remus sighed and walked to Sirius’s room.</p><p>“Padfoot,” Remus had tears in his eyes once he got into Sirius’s room. It broke the werewolf’s heart to see his best friend like this. Remus walked over to a chair and sat down. “I’m so sorry Padfoot,” Remus said in between his sobs.</p><p>              A few hours later and Sirius was still out. His healer walked in to see Remus sitting by his chair with his head in his hands. “Sir?” The healer tried but Remus fell asleep like this. The healer sighed and looked over Sirius before he left. Sirius opened his eyes and looked at Remus who was asleep. Sirius felt nervous when he saw his friend whom he had not seen since before James and Lily died.  Sirius opened his mouth, but he did not have a voice. Sirius let out a sob. This woke the werewolf.</p><p>“Sirius? I’m……...I’m really sorry I should have believed you. I’m…….” Sirius raised his hand and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Don’t………Don’t worry about it, Moon. It’s not your fault…………...It’s……………. It’s mine,” Remus shook his head.</p><p>“No Padfoot it’s not your fault it’s Wormtail’s. They caught him by the way,” Sirius smiled at this and started to cough. Remus let out a sigh. </p><p>“I………I can………...look after…………Harry……………. I can’t wait to………... get him. When they let me……me out of this bloody place................What the hell………….is wrong with my…………. voice?” Sirius let out a noise. Remus looked at him sadly.</p><p>“I think it’s because you have not used it in five years,” Remus said carefully. Sirius did not reply to this all he did was nod. The two friends fell quiet after Remus had said this.  </p><p>A week later and Sirius was let out of the hospital. Sirius could not wait to pick up Harry James Potter his Godson. Sirius was going to pick him up later in the day, but he could not wait to see him again. However, Harry did not know that his Godfather was coming nor did he know that he had a Godfather. Harry sat in his cupboard under the stares holding his broken arm and trying to sleep. He was tried to go to sleep but the pain in his arm and the sound of his uncle yelling into the phone, Harry knew that he was going to get hit later. The five-year-old shivered at the thought. Harry tensed when he heard pounding on his cupboard. “Boy! Boy! Get up and get the door!” Harry heard the door unlock. Harry who was still holding on to his arm crawled out of the small room and walked over to the door. Harry let out a shaky sigh and opened the door with his uncle behind him. “Not one-word Boy. Do you understand freak?” he said in a harsh tone that almost made Harry cry. Harry nodded as the door opened. In the doorway stood a very haunted man. however, there was a kindness in his gray eyes. This man had black hair just like his own.</p><p>“Hello………….my name is Sirius Black ………...May I come in?” Sirius asked. Harry felt bad for this man. However, he could not say sorry to him because he knew that if he did his uncle will sure beat him after. Mr. Dursley, however, pushed Harry to the ground as he went to shut the door. This was the not the best thing to do however for when Harry fell, he landed on his arm. When he did, he let out a cry and blanked out. This made Sirius pull out his wand and blasted the door open.  “How………. How dare you hurt my Godson!” Sirius yelled. “I’m taking him with me!” Sirius added as he went to pick up Harry. If Harry was conscious, he would have flinched at someone picking him up, but he was out.  Sirius smiled sadly at his Godson in his arms. “Tell me where his room is!” Sirius demanded. His stutter was not there but you can hear it a little. Mr. Dursley pointed to the open cupboard in the hall. Sirius looked at where he was pointing and cursed him against the wall. Sirius then walked over to the small room and gathered what he could find. It broke Sirius’s heart when he saw the room. All that Sirius found was a blanket and Harry’s plush stag that he gave him when he was born. Sirius could not find anything else that belonged to his beloved Godson.  “Oh, he’s going to pay,” Sirius said as he made his way to the door. Sirius let out a sigh when he walked down the road with his five-year-old Godson.</p><p>              Sirius walked down the road until he was stopped by a muggle police officer. “Hey, sir. Do you need help?” Sirius turned around to see the man. Sirius had a mix with sadness and anger in his eyes. Sirius sighed and walked over to him.</p><p>“Ye…. Yes. My…………. My Godson needs help……. his……. his uncle hurt him,” Sirius cleared his throat and looked at the man.  he nodded and looked Sirius over.</p><p>“Sir can I have the name of his uncle and where he lives?” Sirius nodded and pointed down the street.</p><p>“Number 4. Down that way. Vernon Dursley,” Sirius said with a fake smile on his face. The man nodded and said:</p><p>“Thank you, sir. Can I get your name?” Sirius nodded and said after a minute:</p><p>“Sirius. Sirius Orion Black,” Sirius had nerves in his voice. However, the cop did not hear it.</p><p>“Thank you, sir. I think you need to get your Godson to the hospital,” Sirius nodded as the cop left. Once he was out of view Sirius apparated to the hospital with his Godson in his arms.</p><p> </p>
