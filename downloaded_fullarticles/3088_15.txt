    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>A fit of giggles could be heard through the manor, as a three-year-old Hadrian Potter-Black ran as fast as his little legs could carry him. Beneath the giggles, one could hear the very excited barks of a large black dog that was chasing the green-eyed toddler through the manor. Unbeknownst to the small boy, he was being lead right to his bedroom so that he could get ready to bed. </p><p>            </p><p>            The boy laughed loudly as he rounded the corner and entered his bedroom. Once he entered the bedroom, he impressively managed to jump on his bed, which was sitting very highly off the ground. He thought he was safe on his bed but two seconds after he got there, the black dog jumped on him and began to lick his face eagerly. “No, No” Hadrian said through pouts of laughter. “I quit papa, I quit” He said as he tried to get away from his father. About five seconds later, the over-excited dog finally stopped licking Hadrian’s face and was soon replaced by the intimidating figure of one, Sirius Black. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright Pup, it’s time for bed” the man said and was already preparing himself for the tantrum that was sure to come. </p><p> </p><p>“O-tay” the boy said after he had finally calmed down. Sirius’ eyes almost fell out of his head as he heard his three-year-old actually agree to get ready for bed. He didn’t say anything as he didn’t want to ruin his chances and like that, he helped his son put on his pajamas and get ready for bed. </p><p> </p><p>He watched fondly as Hadrian went over to the window sill and grabbed his stuffed lion before padding back over to his father who lifted him and placed him back on the bed. Tonight was the first night in almost four days where he wouldn’t be having any trouble with putting Hadrian to bed. It would be three more days until James would be back from his business trip and they both were counting down the seconds. </p><p> </p><p>Once Hadrian was all tucked in and cuddling his lion, he looked at his father with his best puppy dog eyes, the eyes that could get his papa to move mountains, and said “Papa can you tell me a story pwease” </p><p>Sirius figured that since his son had been so well behaved, he could manage to tell a story. So with a soft smile, the man looked down at his son and said “Sure pup, what do you want me to read” The man said and was about to get up and go over to the small library before he felt a small hand tugging on his sleave effectively stopping him. </p><p> </p><p>“No Papa, I want you to tell me a story about you and Daddy” he asked</p><p> </p><p>“Oh” the man said and began to think of the many stories he could tell his son. “What kind of story pup”</p><p> </p><p>“How you and daddy had me” he said excitedly as he stared his father in the eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s a long story”</p><p> </p><p>“Pwease” the boy pleaded and almost immediately, Sirius conceded with a sigh and said “Alright but I’m going to start with your daddy and I’s last year at Hogwarts. Ok?” the man asked</p><p> </p><p>“O-tay” Hadrian said before cuddling up to his father and waiting patiently for the man to start.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it was a very eventful December” the man started</p><p> </p><p> </p>
