    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>When Dumbledore left Harry Potter on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive he was not to know that little Harry would not stay at his Aunts house for the duration he had in mind. How was he to predict the series of events that were to transpire and put all his carefully laid plans to waste. For Harry Potter was really no Potter at all at least not by blood, Lily Evans had not loved James, in fact they had split the year after they left school and Lily had had a whirlwind romance with a man named Jason who was unlike anyone she had ever met, charming and kind he swept her off her feet. She never knew his real name or his real goal in romancing her, she knew only that he was from far away and that he said he would return to her as often as he could. What she didn't know was that 'Jason' had been to Earth before and had used Meredith Quill much like he was using her, in fact the reason he had returned to Earth was to see if he could locate his son Peter and upon finding he was gone had decided to try with another Earth woman in case his Earth spawn was lost. Lily Evans was an ends to a means and the result of their coupling would result in a prophecy which would target her unborn child and see her married to James Potter for safety.</p><p>When Peter Quill had been fighting Ego he had been surprised by his fathers admission that he had a sibling on Earth that might also be able to use the light. The thought that his father had killed so many children sickened him and he was thankful for his family and their support that kept him going especially after losing Yondu so soon after finding out the truth of his genetics. It would be a few months before he would get a likely hit in the Terra Database, but the last match they got was definitely the Lily they were looking for. She was the only one to have a child in the time frame Ego had indicated, after all he had told Peter the child would be about 5 or 6 now and the picture of the child was like looking at an old picture of Peter himself. The information that turned up would change his and his families lives.</p><p>Harry Potter was sleeping off a punishment from his 'Uncle' in the cupboard under the stairs on an old cot mattress when the knock at the door came that would change his whole life. Petunia Dursley opened the door to a leather jacket clad man with dirty blonde hair and piercing green eyes much like her nephew.</p><p>"May I help you?" She asked politely, wondering what a man such as the one on her doorstep could want.</p><p>"Are you Petunia Dursley nee Evans, sister of Lily Potter nee Evans" he asked keeping his voice steady, he had felt an ache in his chest upon learning that he did indeed have a little brother and that his little brother had been orphaned five years previous when a magical being had tried to kill him. His crew had speculated that he had most likely survived due to his unique heritage. It hadn't taken long to track down his little brother one Harry James Potter to his maternal Aunts house in Surrey, England. He and his crew had agreed to a trip to Terra to make sure Harry was secure in his new home with the small possibility that he may leave with them as Gamora had said they were already raising Groot what was one more child. Besides Peter knew that deep down Yondu would want him to check on the kid and do right by him.</p><p>Petunia's face pinched slightly as she contemplated the man in front of her, he didn't seem to be magical and Dumbledore's letter had insisted that no one with ill intent to anyone in her household could get to the front door. "Yes I am, who wants to know?"</p><p>Peter smiled, "could we speak inside this is a delicate matter?" He had found his brother and it seemed to be a good neighbourhood too, he let himself hope that he would be okay.</p><p>Petunia frowned slightly before nodding, she was intrigued now and so she stepped back and allowed him entry and led him into the living room.</p><p>Peter took a seat on the sofa and taking a deep breath began to explain. "Your sister Lily had a ... relationship with my father... her son Harry is my little brother. I recently found this out and looked her up to check she and any child she had were ok and discovered she had been killed. I guess I just want to ensure that Harry is happy and see if you need any support."</p><p>Petunia looked at the man in front of her in shock. He was telling her that his father had a relationship with her sister, his father must have been at least fifty and some how she highly doubted this to be the case. "I don't understand how your father could have been seeing my sister, she was only 19 when she caught for Harry and no offence but your father must be about the fifty mark?"</p><p>Peter sighed as he contemplated how best to explain this, "My father could ... change his appearance, he wasn't like other people, damn to be honest he wasn't even from Earth"</p><p>Petunia gasped, "You mean Harry is part alien as well as having ... magic?" Part of her was freaking out and another part of her was thinking hard about how this could be the perfect solution, here was a man looking into his 'brother' she could let him take the boy and that way she could go back to her normal life.</p><p>Peter scrubbed his face with his hands, this was frustrating to say the least. "Yes Harry is part alien, like me"</p><p>Petunia nodded, "would you take him, I can't keep him, its too much for my husband, if he finds out it wont be good and well I didn't get a choice with having him." She finished in a rush, she neglected to mention that Vernon had become violent with the child and she feared for his safety.</p><p>Pete bowed his head, well there went the idea that his brother would grow up with a family on Terra. "I can take him yes, you would need to sign him over to my custody, I have the papers here?" He was glad Gamora had thought to check out all possible avenues. He pulled the papers out of his pocket and handed them over.</p>
