    <p align="justify">Of all the things she ever dreamed of doing as a grown up, teaching was the last of them. But when her mom sent her an urgent letter asking her to fill a teaching position at Hogwarts, Elizabeth saw the perfect excuse to leave her boring and monotonous life in America, and start fresh in England.</p><p align="justify">Muggle Studies wasn't exactly her dreamed subject, but the slow mailing system made it too late for her to apply for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Which, according to her mother, had been taken by quite an anxious and introverted person, last name being something similar to squirrel, who also happened to be the former Muggle Studies teacher. One would guess that, with magic, many things ought to be easier and faster. But even if the only position left at Hogwarts was as a janitor, she would take it without thinking about it twice.</p><p align="justify">"Harry Potter is coming to Hogwarts this very year?" she asked dumbfoundedly to her mother, while unpacking the last of her luggage in her new office. Despite being barely the brunette's first day in the castle, she could already tell rumors spread awfuly fast.</p><p align="justify">"Yes he is, dear. But do not get too excited, for your class is an elective for students cursing their third to seventh year," a serene Minerva responded. "Let us not forget he is just a child that's just about to discover the truth about him and this world. Please, help me make this transition for him as normal as possible. Like I tried to do with you, my child," her words seemed sweet but firm, that was the magic of Minerva McGonagall.</p><p align="justify">"You seem to be pretty confident that the boy will be sorted into Gryffindor. Aren't you, mum?" Elizabeth teased her, turning from her last empty suitcase to Minerva, who gave a face of surprise. "It seems to me that you were thoroughly disappointed when I was sorted into Slytherin."</p><p align="justify">"Of course not, Elizabeth! You turned out to be magnificent, no matter what house you were in," she immediately responded, not allowing her daughter to laugh. Her face drastically changed into one of nostalgia, "Lily and James Potter were amazing students of mine, I was very fond of them. They took care of you for me during the rise of the war, and I would like to return them the favor." Her gaze lowered and suddenly was completely lost in her own thoughts.</p><p align="justify">Elizabeth immediately left what she was doing, and ran to her mother. Taking her soft hand between hers and guiding the witch's eyes into her brown ones, she gave her a wide warm smile. "I'm sure you will do an excellent job, mum. Remember I was fifteen when he was born, I'm more than aware that he's a kid. And, I will do anything in my hands to help you."</p><p align="justify">Without anything else to say, a now smiling Minerva stood up and left her curly haired daughter to finish installing. "Roam around the castle freely my dear, you must learn every floor on, and it's better if you do it on your own. Many things have changed since you came to Hogwarts. You have about a month before classes start, so get going," the witch recommended just before she left.</p><p align="justify">After a couple of hours dedicated only to accommodating her new office and bedroom, Elizabeth decided to do what her mother had advised. Being barely 8 o'clock, she figured two hours of exploring would be great for a night.</p><p align="justify">Despite having a good start and always being well oriented, the immensity of the castle was something that had been gravely underestimated. She soon found herself completely lost somewhere down in the dungeons, were the castle was colder and darker. Without having idea of what to do, the only thing that came to mind was ask.... or, yell for help.</p><p align="justify">"Hello?!" Her voice echoed across the hallway. One could notice she tried to yell without being too loud. "I recall my dorm being somewhere near here," she whispered to herself, but there wasn't much else she could remember from the top of her head. Many years had past, and she had tried to forget many things that happened during her school years.</p><p align="justify">A couple of minutes passed and she kept walking in a straight line, perhaps somewhere she could see something that seemed familiar and follow the path. But that "somewhere" or "something", didn't appeared to be close. If her sense of time wasn't failing her as well, it was maybe something past eleven.</p><p align="justify">"What am I going to do?" The question left her lips in a sigh. She was too tired to think about doing anything without bothering others.</p><p align="justify">"Who's down here?" A deep, silky, but above all, menacing voice called from the shadows.</p><p align="justify">The lost teacher turned around to see the tip of a glowing wand pointing at her, and as the bearer of it came closer, she could see him more clearly. A tall man, with both dark hair and eyes, approached her. The look on his face was harsh: a deep frown, and his posture showed he was prepared to attack at any moment.</p><p align="justify">"Hello, good night. I am very, very sorry to bother you, Mr..." The brunette relaxed coming closer to the man, who as soon as he discovered she meant no harm, lowered his wand.</p><p align="justify">"Snape, Severus Snape" he shortly answered. "I was warned about in intruder in the dungeons. May I know who are you, and what are you doing in here at this time of the night, Miss....?"</p><p align="justify">"Oh, Deetz! Well, um McGonagall. Elizabeth Deetz McGonagall," she nervously answered. There was something about Severus that kicked her right out of her comfort zone. "I don't know if you've heard yet, but I am McGonagall's daughter. I was just hired for a teaching position in here, and this is my first day in the castle. And well uh, I attended school here but, my mum told me to explore the castle be-before classes started, because so much has changed. But I... well I got lost. Sorry..." she mumbled her words like a fifteen-year old, something she often did when nervous.</p><p align="justify">The dark-haired man examined the girl standing in front of her before saying anything else. "Yes, I heard of you. And your particular interest in filling the Defense Against the Dark Arts position," he said in a flat voice, with a hint of annoyance in it. "I know where your office is, let us go now." Without another word or a signal that she should follow, he began to walk completely opposite to where she was going.</p><p align="justify">"We do not have all night, Miss Deetz. I still have things to do," he raised his voice without turning around. Which made the new teacher dash to be right next to his side. "You better pay attention to which path we are taking, Miss."</p><p align="justify">"Yes, sir." It was completely ridiculous, she felt like a damn student.</p><p align="justify">It wasn't long until they were right in front of her office. A sigh of relief left her chest after spending all of the ride back in complete and utter (uncomfortable) silence. She took out the small key that opened the lock, and before entering she turned around to the man that helped her.</p><p align="justify">"Thank you, Mister Snape. I don't know what I would have done if it wasn't for you," a kind smile adorned her face in gratitude.</p><p align="justify">"No need to call me Mister," was his response as he turned around. "Next time you decide to take a late-night exploring adventure, take someone with spare time that can help you get back to your office when you get lost again. That way, you won't bother others in the middle of the night. Have a good stay, Miss Deetz." He walked away without saying anything else.</p><p align="justify">The look in Elizabeth's face was indescriptible. How dare he? How can a person be so rude to somebody they just met?</p><p align="justify">She closed the door behind her, still trying to process what the hell was wrong with that person. Yet, she couldn't ignore the goosebumps that his voice and poise caused in her. Severus Snape was definitely an interesting, yet awfully rude man. A common combo if you asked her.</p><p align="justify">The long haired woman tucked herself in bed after changing into her pajamas. The thought of Severus Snape invading her mind before falling asleep. "I hope I don't ran too often into him, that bitter man." She hissed, covering her head with a pillow, forcing her mind to think about anything else.</p><hr/><p align="justify">A line of merciless sunshine settled across the brunette's face. She opened up her eyes slowly, the unknown room that surrounded her made her stand up in surprise. It only took her a couple of seconds to remember where she lived now. The clock on her nightstand marked 7:15, so she decided to take a quick shower before going to the Great Hall at eight, like her mother told her to be.</p><p align="justify">The way to the bathroom and back was easier to remember, quickly finding herself on the way to the Great Hall just a couple of minutes before eight o'clock. The delicious smells of the food guided her from her office to the hall, but she still found herself confused about which way to go.</p><p align="justify">"Your breakfast meeting is at the end of that hallway, madam," a distant and soft spoken voice made her turn around, where she found a tall, pale, grey-haired floating man behind her. "Oh, how rude of me, I didn’t meant to startle you. My name is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, at your service," the ghost kindly introduced himself.</p><p align="justify">"Sir Nicholas, it's me Elizabeth. Elizabeth McGonagall." Her wide smile hoped to be enough for him to recognize her.</p><p align="justify">"Oh, dear Merlin! It is you, how much have you changed! For a second I thought I was hallucinating, you see. I've spent so many years here, sometimes the kids seem to have the same faces for centuries." Nick opened his arms widely as a welcome, being unable to touch her.</p><p align="justify">"Yes, one can imagine. I'm gonna start working here, Sir Nicholas. I hope we can see each other more often."</p><p align="justify">"The feelings are mutual, my dear. Now run to your meeting, one must always be punctual," he said before turning around and disappearing into thin air.</p><p align="justify">"Are we stalling, professor Deetz?" The same hoarse voice that haunted her since last night came from the hallway adjacent to the one she was standing in.</p><p align="justify">"Not at all, professor Snape. I just happened to ran into Sir Nicholas on my way to the Great Hall," she quickly answered, deciding this time she wasn't gonna act like a student. The woman straightened her back and stiffened her shoulders without thinking about it. That rude man had no idea with who he was messing with.</p><p align="justify">"Well, then. Shall we?" Severus invited her to walk next to him with a hand gesture. "I'll make sure you don't get lost on your way there," he spat in the most sarcastic voice he could, it was like he just couldn't keep it to himself.</p><p align="justify">Without a response, Elizabeth walked side-to-side with Severus, the same uncomfortable silence grew between them. Thankfully enough, the Great Hall was only a couple of steps away from where they ran into each other. The teachers table was already filled, Elizabeth and Severus seemed to be the only ones that were missing.</p><p align="justify">"Ah, just in time," Dumbledore whispered to Minerva, who was sitting right next to him. "Please, take your seats, let the meeting begin." He said to the arriving teachers.</p><p align="justify">Severus seat was at the other side of the table, which allowed Elizabeth to enjoy her breakfast even more, since she wouldn't have to deal with his bitter face everytime she turned to the side.</p><p align="justify">"While classes haven't started yet, I was looking forward to having you all together at last so I could introduce you to our newest member of the staff." Dumbledore's soft and warm gaze turned to Elizabeth, who stood up nervously in response. "Perhaps some of you remember her when she attended Hogwarts. Elizabeth Deetz McGonagall is, as many of you already know, our dear Minerva's daughter. And, from this moment on, our new Muggle Studies teacher." The old wizard clapped softly, inviting the rest of the teachers to do so as well.</p><p align="justify">All of the teachers quickly followed, except for Severus, who did nothing but stare at her as if he was inspecting her from the inside out. Something that caused Elizabeth great discomfort.</p><p align="justify">"We hope your stay is pleasant enough for you to stay with us as long as your dear mother has done, Elizabeth," Albus welcomed the brunette, giving her a sweet smile while he sat down again. Before she followed his action, her brown eyes traveled towards Severus one last time, who had not moved his eyes from herself.</p><p align="justify">"Mother," she called Minerva after breakfast was over, also after she made sure Severus was no longer around. "What's the matter with professor Snape?" She asked, trying not to sound as interested as she actually was.</p><p align="justify">"What do you mean 'what's the matter'? Did something happened?" Her mother's eyes were inquisitive, even if her voice was not.</p><p align="justify">"Well, yes and no. Is just that I got lost yesterday, and he showed me the way back to my office. But, he seems to dislike me greatly, he's awfully sarcastic and rude," she confessed, trying avoid details like how intensily he was looking at her during the short breakfast meeting.</p><p align="justify">"Oh... well, I'm afraid to tell you that he just happens to be like that, my dear. Severus is quite an enigma. I myself taught him when he was my student, and still, I have no idea what on heavens goes through his mind sometimes," the older witch smiled as she relaxed, it was common when somebody complained about Severus' character. "But, you shouldn't worry about him that much, he'll come around."</p><p align="justify">"What does that mean?" She asked, her face adorned with a complete look of confusion.</p><p align="justify">"You'll see, just be patient with him. Deep down the harshest looks, a good man protects himself." It wasn't much, but the talk she had with her mother made her think twice about a couple of things. Perhaps she was judging Severus too hard, she had just met him a day ago. The curly haired woman remembered she used to be like that most of her life. But as her mother said, it was only to protect herself from others that caused harm. She couldn't blame Snape for trying to do the same, especially if she didn't knew him.</p><p align="justify"><br/> After many days of debating with herself (and avoiding certain teacher). And when she finally learned how to travel the castle without getting lost in every hallway, a basket of goodies appeared in front of certain professor's door. All with a card that read:</p><p align="center">
  <em> Thank you for the help the other day. Don't worry, I know how to get back on my own now.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> -Elizabeth Deetz.</em>
