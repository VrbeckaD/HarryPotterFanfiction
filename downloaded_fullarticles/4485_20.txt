    <hr/>
<p>It had been almost two full years since he had survived the war and its aftermath when Lucius Malfoy saw Hermione Granger for the first time since that awful afternoon in his drawing room at the end of the afore mentioned war.</p>
<p>Just like she had been then, at this moment she was following the two young men she called friends, but today she looked exasperated. The young woman was limping badly as they made their way up Diagon Alley, and her companions were not heeding her calls for them to slow down; they appeared to be too caught up in their own conversation to even notice her.</p>
<p>She was falling further and further behind the two wizards and finally she stopped completely, leaning up against a shop front for support and holding her injured foot off the ground as she looked after her companionsho still hadn’t noticed her.</p>
<p>Lucius was seated at the café across from where she had stopped, waiting for friends to join him for afternoon tea. He had been slightly early and was people watching while he waited. He and his best friend, Severus, had been welcomed back into polite society very easily when it was revealed that they had both been Dumbledore’s men for the duration of the second war.</p>
<p>Of course, there were always going to be people who didn’t believe that, even if their allegiances had been proven by Dumbledore’s portrait at their trials. He glanced after the black and ginger heads rapidly disappearing from view and he sneered, knowing that those two particular Gryffindor wizards headed the hate department as far as ex-death eaters were concerned.</p>
<p>Lucius appreciated their position; he had dealt with the worst of the scum that was attracted to Tom Riddle, but they were still thinking of things from a child-like perspective, unlike their friend still watching them disappearing up the street. She had been very amicable towards everyone, and really, she had the most to be upset about.</p>
<p>Even if people didn’t know of his loyalties during that awful time, they were usually tolerant of him as it was obvious that Lucius had changed. His snake-headed cane was gone, as was his trade-mark long hair, his hair now just brushed his shoulders. To go with all this change he was a free man; a decision that had been taken out of his hands. Narcissa had eft him in the wake of the war. They had never been love’s dream, but they had managed quite well. After the war however, Narcissa had wanted her freedom, and so as part of this brave new world, he had granted it.</p>
<p>Lucius pulled himself from his thoughts and looked back to the still stationary witch across the road. He had seen her approaching, without immediately recognising her. What had caught his attention to start with was her pretty polka dotted, green dress. The airy material was merrily dancing around her in the summer breeze as were the chestnut curls that spilled down her back, and she made such a pretty picture that it had captured his attention before he actually saw who she was.</p>
<p>He had not noticed that she was injured at first either, only that she was an attractive woman. However, once he recognised her he was shocked to see who it was and exactly how lovely she was.</p>
<p>Not a traditional beauty by any means, but her heart-shaped face was very pleasant, and she appeared to have a well-bred grace and poise that most in her generation lacked. Lucius was intrigued, and ever the Slytherin, he used the opportunity before him. Rising from his chair he strode across the street to her.</p>
<p>To closer he got to her, the more he noticed. Her chest was rising and falling sharply and her throat sounded constricted. “Allow me to be of assistance, Miss Granger,” and he heard her gasp and saw her head snap up. It was then that he saw the panic in her eyes, but he continued as if nothing was amiss. “I have a table across the street, may I escort you to it so you can rest that foot of yours?”</p>
<p>The young woman swallowed hard, and Lucius saw tears welling in her eyes. He offered her his arm wordlessly, and watched her cast a glance up the street, apparently in a last ditched attempt to see her companions. When she saw that they had finally gone out of sight she turned back, giving Lucius a weary look as her lip slipped between her teeth.</p>
<p>Being painfully aware of their history he was just about to inform her that he was waiting for friends of hers to arrive in the hope it was ally her fears, when she straightened and he felt her hand slide across the sleeve of his robes and place itself in the crook of his elbow. “Thank you, Mister Malfoy,” she whispered breathily. “I would appreciate your assistance,” and she cleared her throat.</p>
<p>Lucius remained silent even as he became very concern at her strained breathy voice and took her slowly across the road placing her in the chair beside his. “May I?” he questioned, indicating her foot. “I am rather a deft hand at healing spells.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s lip remained wedged between her teeth, but she nodded. “I do not wish to be of you trouble to you, sir,” she told him as she watched him gracefully descend to one knee before her and cradle her swollen and quickly bruising ankle in his warm hands. He removed her shoe carefully and she had to bite back a moan at the gentle feel of his hands. The Gryffindor witch was not used to this kind of consideration, and she suddenly found a slow fire starting to smoulder deep within her.</p>
<p>“It is no trouble, Miss Granger,” he asserted as he drew a little circle over her ankle with his wand and saw the swelling lessening as he did so. “You have such fine, pretty ankles, it does not surprise me that you turned it. Your friends should take better care of you.”</p>
<p>“I can take care of myself,” she countered tersely, confused by what was brewing inside her, but her mind went into a tail-spin as he chose that moment to caress her ankle as he replaced her shoe.</p>
<p>Placing her foot on the ground and sitting back in his chair he said, “Yes, I know you can, but what I’m saying is that you shouldn’t have to, your friends should show you more consideration, or at least notice when you need assistance.”</p>
<p>Hermione stiffened in her seat, she knew he was right. It had always been a problem, Harry and Ron thought she was invincible—just one of the boys—and she hated it, especially when they chased all other males away just by their presence around her. She relaxed slightly and sighed. “Perhaps,” she conceded, and then took a shaky breath. “Thank you for your help, Mister Malfoy. I appreciate you coming to my aid,” and she started to get up.</p>
<p>“As I said, it was no trouble… though might I interest you in a cup of tea before you go rushing off?” he asked, wanting to lengthen their time together. He didn’t know what had gotten into him; surely this was the last witch he should be entertaining? But there was something about her that seemed to call to him. Then there was the war, he really did need to make amends to her. He knew Severus already had, but how do you ask for forgiveness after what was suffered while you did nothing? He steeled his resolve, he had to try, so he watched her making her decision.</p>
<p>“Umm?” Hermione glanced around herself while worrying her lip with her teeth. A cup of tea was exactly what she needed at the moment, but should she become indebted to this man? <em>Well, actually when you think about it, Granger, you already are, what harm can come of adding a cup of tea?</em> her inner voice told her. Making her decision, she said, “T-thank you, that would be nice,” and she offered him a slight curl of her lips into a smile, not realising yet that her breathing had evened out again.</p>
<p>“Good,” he returned, copying the expression, and summoning the waiter. Once he had placed their order and the waiter was gone, Lucius said, “Miss Granger, I am glad to have met you today, I have been wanting to speak with you. I am aware that you and Severus are now on more amicable terms, and I was hoping that there may be some middle ground we might reach.”</p>
<p>Hermione blinked very owl-like at him. “Oh! … umm, you… umm. Oh!  Sir, I’m not certain…”</p>
<p>“Then let us just have a quiet cup of tea together while you consider it,” he suggested.</p>
<p>She nodded, seeming unable to form words.</p>
<p>“Good,” he intoned, pleased that the waiter was speedy and was just returning with their tea.</p>
<p>They sat there quietly sipping their tea, but Hermione’s mind was reeling, and soon she found words coming out of her mouth. “You know, I do not blame you for what happened to me,” she stated.</p>
<p>He wanted to rant at her. Of course it was his fault, she had been in his home and he had done nothing to stop the horror that had happened to her. “Of course it is my fault,” he returned stiffly, his lips pinched tightly together.</p>
<p>“No! Knowing what I know now, and looking at it from an adult’s perspective,” but she then shrugged, seeming unable to finish. “It’s still very painful for me,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Physically painful?” he asked, his eyes snapping up from his cup.</p>
<p>“No, only mentally now,” and she sighed. “I know you were unable to stop what happened to me, and I guess, if I’m honest, I did hate you all for some time, but then I realised what was what. You would not be sitting here talking to me now if you had protected me that day. I do understand why you couldn’t have acted.”</p>
<p>Her earnest eyes held only honesty, and for the first time in his life Lucius Malfoy was genuinely humbled. “But you were an innocent, almost still a child… she was brutal… always had been… insane.”</p>
<p>Surprising herself, Hermione’s hand slipped forward covering his where it lay motionless on the table. “I do not begrudge you wanting to stay alive, and I’ll wager you have witnessed worse than what happened to me.”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded sadly as he tore his eyes away from her delicate hand resting on his. “That is true, but you were different,” he told her, looking her straight in the eye.</p>
<p>The pain she saw as his eyes shocked her and her hand slipped back to her lap, as did her eyes. “H-how? I was simply another human, I am no different to any of the other victims of the war.”</p>
<p>“You are… Hermione,” and he heard her gasp. “Do you know what started to change me from the monster I had become?”</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes and shook her head, willing her tears not to fall as everything all suddenly crashed down on her once more and her chest started to constrict.</p>
<p>“It was a feisty little Muggle-born witch I met in Flourish and Blotts. She had been about to enter her second year at Hogwarts I believe and she chastised me, but she also made me start thinking about things.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave a little laugh, just a tiny one and her breathing eased a bit. “I am sorry I was so rude to you that day, my mother took me to task over my little speech to you as soon as we got home. She told me that no matter who I spoke to I should treat everyone how I wished them to treat me.” Her voice cracked slightly as she said it. “I wish my parents were still here, I miss them so much,” she mumbled, but then cleared her throat and controlled her emotions again. After a moment, she ventured, “Was it really me who started you thinking about Muggle-born equality?”</p>
<p>“You had a profound effect on me, my dear,” and he found himself returning the little smile that had arrived on her face, but wondering what had happened to her parents. He knew that Voldemort had ordered the Death Eaters to make examples of the Grangers, but no one could find them, and he was suddenly very pleased about that; this young woman didn’t need that pain added to her burden, yet she appeared to be in pain about it regardless.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that she seemed to suddenly become aware that she was lost in his gaze and she tore her eyes away from his stormy grey eyes and placed both hands around her cup. “Tea was exactly the tonic I needed, thank you,” she told him after another silence.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to help,” he replied.</p>
<p>They were both drawn away from their tentative little smiles at one another by a third voice. “Well, well, what’s going on here then?”</p>
<p>Hermione cursed herself as she instantly blushed heatedly, and she heard Lucius chastise his friend.</p>
<p>“Severus, mind your manners. I simply came across Miss Granger and now we’re having tea. Hello, Lenore,” and Lucius rose to peck the red-headed woman on Severus’ arm on the cheek. “You should teach your husband some manners, my dear.”</p>
<p>“Me? Teach Severus something, that’s a laugh,” she responded, and happily squeezed her hands around his bi-cep, smiling up at him.</p>
<p>To Hermione’s surprise Severus smiled back easily, and replied, “I don’t know, you’ve taught me quite a few things, love.” The dark-haired wizard then turned to Hermione. “Hello, Hermione.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Severus,” Hermione said standing to greet them. Hermione greeted Lenore warmly, stepping around her chair to exchange a brief hug with the redhead. Hermione worked with Lenore Snape, and they had become friends, which was how she and Severus had embarked on a more friendly footing.</p>
<p>“Are you staying for more tea?” Lenore asked, giving her a peck on the cheek.</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes went to Lucius, uncertain of what he would say. “Umm,” and her lip went back to its perch between her teeth.</p>
<p>“I would be pleased if you would remain,” Lucius told her, getting up to reseat her should she wish it.</p>
<p>Hermione looked to Severus, certainly she had talked to him as an equal when he’d come to the archive to visit Lenore or to research, but she had never sat in a social situation with him like this.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “If Lucius wishes you to stay, and you are willing, I have no problem with it,” and he sat, after seating his wife.</p>
<p>All three watched Hermione make her decision, finally she nodded, allowing Lucius to seat her once more.</p>
<p>To her surprise the four of them quickly found an easy repour and ended up talking for over an hour. Finally Hermione bid them a good day, still angry that neither Harry nor Ron had come back looking for her, but in the same way glad because she never would have had such a pleasant conversation if they had.</p>
<p><em>A pleasant conversation with Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape?</em> she thought. <em>Why do those two things seen incongruent? </em>But have a pleasant time she had, and was sorry it had ended as she walked back to the Leaky to floo home.</p>
<p align="center">~~~***~~~</p>
<p>As she dropped into her favourite chair and kicked off her shoes, Hermione reflected that it didn’t surprise her that she got on so well with Lenore Snape; Lenore had been a Gryffindor and head girl when Hermione had been in first year. Hermione smiled and wondered how long Severus had been keeping Lenore up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Everyone had been suitably shocked when Severus had arrived with her on his arm after the war. Of course Harry and Ron had had a lot of unsavoury things to say, and Hermione remembered having an all-out brawl with them to get them to remain civil. She was glad that the dour professor had finally found someone to love, and she sighed. She wished she could find that special person she was meant to be with. Then she looked at her hand, the one Lucius had kissed when she was leaving, and she wondered if it was simply politeness that had made him do it.</p>
<p>It took a further three hours for the boys to come looking for her.</p>
<p>“Were the hell did you get to?” Ron opened with, when she let them into her flat.</p>
<p>“What, before or after I sprained my ankle?” She saw guilt spread over Harry’s face, and this incensed her more.</p>
<p>“Is it all right now, ‘Mione?” he asked, looking pointedly at her feet.</p>
<p>“Yes, someone helped me,” she said without offering any more details, but then she scowled. “I tried to get you two to stop, but you didn’t hear me apparently.” Even though from Harry’s expression she knew better.</p>
<p>“Oh I heard you, but we were in a hurry… had to get the tickets,” Ron told her. “You owe Harry for yours, since you didn’t turn up,” he continued, apparently clueless and not seeming to notice that Hermione was becoming angrier.</p>
<p>“If you heard me then, why didn’t you stop?” she all but yelled.</p>
<p>“The tickets for the world cup were going on sale, and you wanted us to stop because you stumbled over a rock as we left The Leaky?” he asked clearly incredulous at her request.</p>
<p>“Is it too much to ask that you…” her mouth pinched, and she huffed. “Oh, never mind. Here is the money for my ticket, Harry,” she said, reaching into the pocket of her dress. “I think I’d like to be alone now, please.”</p>
<p>Harry took the money, handing her the ticket and nodding his thanks before pulling the still clueless Ron towards the door. “We’ll see you soon, ‘Mione, yeah?” he said and shut the door after them.</p>
<p align="center">~~~***~~~</p>
<p>That night, Severus and Lenore were talking over dinner. “I was very surprised to see Hermione Granger sitting with Lucius today?” Severus stated.</p>
<p>“Stranger things have happened, love,” Lenore replied.</p>
<p>Severus chuckled. “I suppose so,” he paused, taking a sip of his wine. “Was it my imagination or did Lucius have a lustful glint in his eye?”</p>
<p>Lenore laughed happily. “No, dear husband I believe you are correct,” she replied as she finished her desert. “Should we try to encourage them, do you think? They are both very lonely.”</p>
<p>“That is true, but Lucius is still filled with such guilt over what happened to Hermione in his house at the end of the war. I’ve tried telling him that there was nothing he could have done to prevent it without signing his family’s death warrants, but it still troubles him.”</p>
<p>“Which tells me that he obviously overcame some internal battle to assist Hermione in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Despite everything, Lucius is a gentleman, Lenore.”</p>
<p>“He is also a consummate Slytherin, just like you, my love.” Getting up, she walked around and straddled his lap. “He may be a gentleman, but knowing their shared history, wouldn’t he have been better to call someone else to help her, not approach her himself unless he had an ulterior motive.”</p>
<p>Severus gave her a speculative eyebrow raise. “Not out of the goodness of his heart?” he posed.</p>
<p>Lenore laughed. “You mean the same goodness that saw you circumventing numerous school rules and blatantly breaking a couple to get me into your bed while I was still a seventh year?” She raised an eyebrow of her own. “Never stand between a Slytherin and what he wants; it’s the same as a goblin and his gold.”</p>
<p>“You make us sound very shallow, my dear,” Severus pouted.</p>
<p>Lenore kissed his pout away. “Not at all, I’m only saying that you know what you want and you will manipulative things until you get it.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know what I want right now,” and he pulled her closer, and started nibbling her neck.</p>
<p>She giggled outrageously. “By my logic,” and she spared a moment to sigh as Severus pulled her earlobe into his mouth. “I bet next time you see our friend Lucius, he will ask you to arrange for Hermione to accompany us somewhere so he can get to know her better.”</p>
<p>“You’re on, I do not think he will ask for assistance. Lucius works best alone,” Severus rumbled against her neck. “What are the stakes?”</p>
<p>“Washing up.”</p>
<p>Severus chuckled. “Oh I don’t think so, we can be a little more creative than that surely.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” and Lenore pulled back and started flexing her hips against Severus’ crotch as she undid her blouse. She grinned at him when she heard him groan. “What do you have in mind?”</p>
<p>A flick of Severus’ wand and Lenore sat on his lap naked. His eyes panned up and down her body before he said, “If I’m right, you will be as you are at the moment each time we are here alone, for a whole month.” Watching the actions of her hips against him for a moment he added, “Now, lay on the table for me.”</p>
<p>“Hang on a minute, Sev, I haven’t set my side of the bargain yet.”</p>
<p>Severus raised one raven eyebrow and waited for her to continue.</p>
<p>“If I’m right… you must give up smoking for the same amount of time.”</p>
<p>Severus snorted. “You must be joking, woman, being able to light up is the only thing that stops me from strangling several people a day with my bare hands.”</p>
<p>Lenore considered this for a moment. “Yes, perhaps you are correct, I might be performing a public dis-service by doing that, although it would be good for your health.”</p>
<p>“You know as well as I do that wizarding cigarettes do not contain the lethal cocktail of caseinogens that their Muggle cousins do, and there is a regenerative potion for any lung damage that only need be taken every ten years or so,” he stated, watching his hands as he started stimulating her nipples into rigid peaks with his fingers.</p>
<p>“True,” she stated thoughtfully, unconsciously arching her back in response. “But I still think that you and Lucius smoke entirely too much.”</p>
<p>Severus glared at her, and she ignored him, pursing her lips and tapping her finger on them as if in deep thought. Finally, she sighed, “Oh, does it really matter?” and she immediately moaned as his mouth closed around one of the now hard rosy pieces of flesh that his fingers had been playing with.</p>
<p>“You can’t think of anything, can you?” he teased.</p>
<p>“You’re deliberately distracting me,” she told him while threading her fingers through his hair to keep his head there.</p>
<p>He chuckled. “Well, never mind, darling, because you aren’t going to win.” His hand slid down between them. “And I’m going to enjoy having you like this for a whole month. Now, will you lay back?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, Severus,” she moaned as both his mouth and his fingers went to work on pleasuring her.</p>
<p>Lenore shuffled up off his lap trying not to break the contact between them and lay back on the table as he asked, placing her feet on the arms of his chair and opening her legs, knowing what he wanted.</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” he crooned to her nether lips and blew air on the glistening flesh before reaching for the bowl that had contained his desert. Leaning forward in his chair, Severus took the bowl that he had left a spoonful of ice cream in. It was now liquid and he took the chocolate confectionary and carefully tipped it over Lenore’s auburn-haired sex, watching in pleasure as it slid languidly from her clit to the table beneath her. She groaned and convulsed as the still cold liquid hit her already quivering flesh, and he chuckled sinfully. “Does that feel good?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, Sev. Lick it up, love, lick it up.”</p>
<p>“With pleasure,” he replied, and brought his tongue out to tease her further.</p>
<p align="center">~~~***~~~</p>
<p>While the Snapes were indulging themselves, Lucius was sitting at his dinner table alone and deep in thought about a chestnut-haired witch with green-flecked chocolate coloured eyes. The afternoon had been blissful for him. Even Narcissa had never felt as good at his side as Hermione had.</p>
<p>It troubled him that there was such a big age gap between them, but her conversation was impeccable, and he was going to make a point of visiting the ministry archive on a more regular basis to see if they had more in common.</p>
