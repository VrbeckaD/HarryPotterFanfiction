  <em>
    <span>“Tom’s coming, he’s coming, he’ll save us,” he mumbled urgently, gripping the child, his child, </span>
  </em>
  <span>their</span>
  <em>
    <span> child (though the adoption had yet to fully go through), to his chest. The sound of planes in the distance made him shudder, pulling the frightened boy somehow even closer.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Poppa, what’s happening,” the child cried, his hands gripping his robes as they huddled against the far wall of their apartment.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I don’t know, love. Planes have never been this close to us before,” never that close to the magical world. He had always felt safe there even on the outskirts magic hiding them from muggle view. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>And that was when he felt it. It wasn’t just planes echoing closer to them, but the lingering ache of dark magic filling every pore. Wizards were coming, and it seemed a battle was about to happen on his front porch. He hoped Tom wasn’t about to be caught up in the storm, as he often did when dark magic was involved. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Crashes sounded from outside, shaking the man and boy to the core. He berated himself for allowing his lover to convince him to borrow his wand, leaving him practically defenseless with their child. Tom would come eventually, he knew, but they couldn’t wait much longer. They couldn’t hide in the dark forever. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“We need to move, Drago,” He already hated the words leaving his mouth, “Tom will find us, but we need to find somewhere safe.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Gripping the boy somehow even tighter, he prayed to whatever gods there were for Tom’s safety. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Rushing the door, he felt a pull at his core, allowing it to slam with a brave show of wandless magic. He barely paid attention to the steps as he glared at the ground, trying to drown out his child’s cries of “What about Dad!” He tried desperately to ignore the lure of dark magic, hearing the screams and cries of people braver than he. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“What’ve we got here?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Mentally cursing, he looked up to see the three brutes standing in the alleyway behind his apartment building. They eyed him hungrily, sending disturbed shivers down his spine. Fearfully he lifted one hand into his son’s hair with a quiet whisper of, “Hush now, Drago.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The poor boy didn’t seem to sense the danger, still crying out for his other parental figure, eyes lifted to the only home he knew. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He took a step back, away from the looming brutes, still eyeing him and his son like they were meat. He made plans to immediately run back to the apartment, ignoring his ideas of escaping elsewhere. The men seemed to sense his decision, racing forward as he turned to rush back up the steps. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>With a shout, he fell, a hand wrapped firmly around his ankle. His boy, his poor child, hit the stairs with a pained scream. His eyes already turned towards his attackers, widening with fear as he saw their greedy looks and wands at the ready. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Releasing his child, he tried to push him up the stairs with a scream, “Run! Run, Drago! Hide!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The poor child looked lost for a moment, his eyes hazy with tears, before he finally pushed himself away from his father, trying valiantly to take the stairs two steps at a time as his father had before.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
  </em>
  <span>Avada Kedavra!</span>
  <em>
    <span>”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He screamed in agony as the green spell flew past his own body, hitting his child, still midstep. The scream overtook the entire battle, if only for a moment, as the man watched the boy fall limp against the stairs, his hand outreached in an attempt to catch him before he landed.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
  </em>
  <b>NO!</b>
  <em>
    <span> No, no no no no!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He could hear the brutes chuckles as they watched his agony, feel the hand still gripping his ankle as it pulled him forcefully down the stairs. He screamed, his voice cracking as a hand gripping his chin made him look at the three hungry stares instead of his child’s body.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Now that that’s out of the way, we can have some fun.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>His eyes widened more in horror of the sentence, his limbs finally reawakening to attempt to scramble from the men pulling him closer. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Tom! Tom help me!” His core shivered as he pushed it against the men, trying to escape their hands holding him down, but his magic wasn’t strong enough. He could feel his core shattering as he called out for his lover, knowing that eventually he would save him from this nightmare.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>With a gasp, Harry shot forward, his eyes wide and searching for his attackers. He could still feel their hands, their breath, touching him, searching him, making him feel unclean as his very being called out for someone to save him.</p>
<p>
  <span>But, finally, looking around the darkened tent, Harry realized he was safe, or as safe as he could be, and that the thoughts still running through his mind were all from a dream. He was Harry Potter, not the adopted father of a little boy. He was on the run from the current Dark Lord, hunting down horcruxes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a huff, Harry pushed himself up from his cot, quietly making his way to the exit. Hermione would be cross with him for leaving without telling her, but he wasn’t going far. He just needed to take a short walk, clear his mind for a few moments. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The cool air of the forest soothed his thoughts, cooling the sweat off of his brow. He closed his eyes, allowing his feet to carry him a short distance from the tent, so he could think, just for a second, without Hermione staring at him, or the burning shame of Ron’s empty cot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The locket burned, heavy against his chest as he moved through the woods, his steps silent except for occasional twig or stick that happened to get stuck beneath his foot. He felt no pain, not even the cool air distracted him from his movements, his mind on one place as he walked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The small clearing he had found days before was a blessing, no matter how much Hermione tried to make it a curse. She tried constantly to force him to tell her where it was he was hiding when he was lost in his thoughts, but he refused. He needed peace, just for a short time, to get his mind back on track, and now that he had found the comfortable land he wasn’t giving it up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Laying in the grass, he realized he hadn’t gotten a shirt, not that it mattered. The hands from his nightmare were still fresh in his mind, and he was content to let the moonlight wash the feeling of disgust off of his body. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The dreams had never been that bad before. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He recalled Ginny telling him that they perhaps meant he had come in contact with his soulmate, and he was gaining memories of their past lives together. It was uncommon, but it happened with powerful couples, and obviously, with ones that had been reincarnated together. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knew Ginny had hoped it was her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something in him knew it wasn’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first nightmares were in his second year, weak and blurry. Again in his fourth, after the disastrous tournament and Voldemort’s revival. After Sirius’ death it had been much worse, he couldn’t make sense between what were nightmares and what were supposedly memories. And now that he was on the run, it felt like he was dying. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The books he secretly read on the subject had said it would get worse when he reached “magical maturity.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The locket burned against his chest, seemingly laughing at any idea of Harry being mature. It pushed a sense of fear into his mind, because it knew, and Harry knew, though he refused to acknowledge it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort, Tom Marvolo Riddle, was Harry’s soulmate. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sadly, the villain was the only one who made sense, even in Harry’s denial. Almost anytime Harry had the nightmares, in the previous days he had had some kind of contact with the monster, whether it was the horcrux with the diary, or it was the man himself digging his nails so deep in Harry’s brain he could still feel it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had yet to see his so called soulmate in his nightmares, he was always alone or with a child (oddly enough as he knew of Voldemort’s dislike of children). He almost always died in these nightmares, having yet to have a happy memory of being with his soulmate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wasn’t his soulmate supposed to give him a sense of completion, of happiness?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh, he wrapped his hand gently around the locket, pulling it up to examine it in the moonlight. It pulsed in his hand, responding to his touch greedily. Harry didn’t know if he should be amused or disgusted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had long before taken full control of the locket, the guilt of Ron’s absence still weighing heavily on his mind. He couldn’t in good conscience let Hermione take responsibility of the horcrux when she was left heartbroken and in tears from Ron storming off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He glared at the locket in his hand, and somehow, he knew, the locket was glaring back. </span>
