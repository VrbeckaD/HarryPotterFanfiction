    <p>GIBRALTAR, MAY 1957</p><p>Some habits are hard to break. When she was a little girl at Wool’s, sleeping in was never a question; everyone was expected to be dressed for breakfast by half past eight o’clock at the very latest, and even if you were willing to skip a meal to get more sleep, there was the constant rotation of chores. She knows now that the routine was important; they had sixty unruly children to look after, they needed to keep everyone on some sort of schedule. They had to prepare them for adult lives; they needed the discipline to occupy them, to keep them from dwelling too long on their bleak circumstances. It didn’t mean much to her as a child of six, but she’s in some way grateful for it now. She doesn’t look back on it fondly, but the memories don’t sting the way they perhaps ought to. If anything, it is a dull, comforting ache, like the reminder of flesh and bone when you clunk your knee on the underside of a table. </p><p>Then she went away to school, and while no one was forcing her to get up and scrub floors or sweep stairs, she had classes and quidditch practice and matches, and living in a dormitory meant that as soon as one of them was up, all of them were up, no matter how comfortable the bed or cozy the room. She was always on the move, she recalls. She can count on one hand the number of times she remembers lying in bed, letting the warm sunlight wash over her from the small ground-level window above her head. There was always somewhere to hurry off to, things to be done, homework to finish, library books to return, a meeting with Madam Amell at the infirmary, laps around the quidditch pitch to run. Or Vera and Ruby were going down to Hogsmeade early and wanted her to come with, or it was the first snowfall of the year and she wanted to see what the grounds looked like, or it was exam week and she was too anxious to doze off again. </p><p>And then she was done with school, and she was out in the big, wide world, and whatever sleep she got while working with the Relief Services, it was never enough, just short scraps and snippets, dozing off while sitting in uncomfortable chairs or slumped against a wall or beneath a tree in some war torn field where they were searching for more and more bodies charmed to be hidden from muggle view. Once she fell asleep in the back of a truck rumbling down a bombed out street in the middle of the day, the constant clamor and noise around her fading to a distant rumble in the back of her eardrums. When she found out she was pregnant she was too worried to sleep the entire night; she would lay awake feeling at the treacherous, definitive bump of her belly, or wincing because her breasts ached, or her back was in agony, or her hands and feet were starting to swell. </p><p>After Mae, of course, well, sleep went out the window. She had an infant to tend to at all hours of the day. She doesn’t think she got a good night’s rest until her daughter was at least three and a half. Sleep has crept back into her life since then, the nights become restful once more, and she stopped jerking awake from some unknown terror, stopped sitting up so quickly her head would swim and looking around the room with wild eyes. She kept Mae’s cradle beside her bed, then her crib, then she slept with her until she was five. Mae squirmed and kicked and clawed in her sleep and mumbled to herself, but all of that was comforting, reassuring, compared to the thought of waking up and finding her missing or hurt. But even when she could sleep easily again, she always woke up early, usually before the sun had even risen. It felt like being ready, bracing herself for the day, not being caught unawares. As if she could somehow see any danger approaching so long as she got out of bed in time to meet it. As if fighting back was simply a question of preparedness and a good breakfast.</p><p>The morning after, she gets up before the dawn, puts on the dented kettle, and takes her tea outside to the tiny, cramped patio out back, where there is perhaps a few yards of rocky, barren earth dotted with old flowerpots and some cheerfully rusting lawn ornaments, and then the solid rock wall of the Mons Calpe. She’s not facing the horizon, but that’s alright. She prefers to watch the shadow of the sun rise over the rock. She finds it invigorating, usually. This rock has been here since the dawn of time. It will be here long after all she and everyone she knows are dead. It will be here even if the seas overflow and the sky rains down fire. No amount of war-machines or natural disasters could topple it. She takes some strength from it, maybe.</p><p>She sips at her tea, and presently Vera slips out to join her, curlers in her hair. “What’s wrong?” Vera asks quietly, without even seeing Amy’s drawn face, just knowing instantly from the way she is huddled in the battered wicker chair, her feet pulled up under her, her hair spilling out of its messy bun, her white-knuckled grip on her chipped mug. Amy clinks the teaspoon against the rim, dumps in some more sugar from the almost empty pot, and massages her aching scalp. Vera is as unobtrusive as ever; marriage and motherhood and a prosperous career have not made her any more assuming or strident. Amy wishes she had that sort of grace under fire. God knows Vera's had her share of hardships too, what with her parents and her brother. She sits down across from Amy, burrowing into her thick lavender cardigan as the wind cuts into them a little. It’s supposed to be scorching today, but for now it is still cool, especially in the shadows.</p><p>“He knows,” Amy says simply. She doesn’t have to go into detail; Patsy and Ted O’Neill have always taken her at her word as to how Mae came about and who her father is, but there was never much hope of hiding it from the likes of Vera or Ruby, not from women who were her closest friends during her time at Hogwarts. She’s already got so many lies to keep track of; it was easier to privately confirm to them that what they suspected was true. They don’t know the whole of it, of course- they don’t know what Tom’s done, they don’t know what she did to cut ties, they don’t know what the consequences of this could be, but they do know her intentions, and that her intentions have always been to stay here, raise Mae as best she knows how, and live a quiet, durable life.</p><p>“He wrote you?” Vera reaches over to take her hand, frowning. “How… did he say how he found out?”</p><p>“You could say that,” Amy scoffs bitterly, then sets down her hot mug, pushing some flyaway hairs out of her sleep-crusted eyes. “He… I don’t know that he’s completely certain. But he knows we’re here.”</p><p>Vera’s hand tightens around hers. “He didn’t threaten you, did he?”</p><p>“No,” says Amy, although the clawing sensation in her chest says otherwise. “You know that’s not his style. Far too aggressive for our Tom. Rising Ministry star. Newspaper darling,” she snorts humorlessly. She's painstakingly kept track of his steadily increasing emergence in the Daily Prophet, from the briefest of mentions to full page interviews. Gilda Skeeter described him as 'positively captivating, controversial policies aside' in her latest profile. “He’s just… making me aware that he’s aware. I’ve no idea if he heard about the job offer.”</p><p>“You should write him back,” Vera suggests. “Lie. Tell him he’s- he’s got the wrong idea. She’s not his, you had a fling, you’re happy where you are-,”</p><p>“I am happy here,” Amy snaps, then flushes like a schoolgirl, ashamed of her own thin skin. She's not supposed to be this fragile. She's tougher than that now. She was, at any rate. ‘Here’ was exotic and strange at first but now it’s utterly mundane. It’s not perfect and it never will be and she knows she’s probably doing Mae some sort of disservice, raising her in isolation on some sandy strait jutting out into the sea, knows this isn’t the ideal life for a child, but it’s better than what Amy had. It’s got to be better. Mae has a mother. Mae has a home. Mae knows she’s loved, and wanted. And Amy likes her work. It may not be groundbreaking, she may make barely enough to keep the lights going and to purchase their groceries every week, but it’s still important. She feels like what she does matters. She feels like she’s come to belong here, in her own way.</p><p>“You are,” says Vera gently. “But I know it must be very lonely at times, even with Pat and Teddy around.”</p><p>“She’s pregnant,” Amy mutters, resenting how bitter the words come out. When Teddy found out, he must have picked Patsy up by the waist and spun her about, shouting with glee. He probably rushed out to start buying things for the nursery immediately, already began debating names. Amy found out while sobbing with snot and wracked with coughs on a dreary October evening in rural southern France. They were living in an abandoned farmhouse surrounded by an orchard full of rotting fruit that had never been picked in time for the harvest. There were dead flies lying in clumps on the windowsill and she cried so hard her eyes nearly swelled shut. No one was there to congratulate or sympathize with her; she didn't dare breathe a word of it until she was nearly six months and it was becoming blatant.</p><p>Vera stills. “Patsy?”</p><p>“Yes. She flooed me the other day, couldn’t contain herself until they came back from Granada. You know they never thought it would happen for them.” </p><p>Amy never thought it would happen for her, either. But she was stupid. It would be just like her to pull a grand plan off and then trip up on the way out the door. For a while it felt like some spiteful finally victory on Tom's part, although he couldn't have possibly known. She's been telling herself that for years. He couldn't have known. They were just children. Regardless of the rest, he was just a boy, and in some small ways still very innocent. She recalls an excruciating conversation just before their first time, her pointedly explaining exactly how to use a rubber and how under no circumstances was he to give her grief over it or suggest that she ought to be solely responsible. The look of thinly veiled disgust on his face had derailed her sober lecture and sent her into near hysterical giggles at how contemptuous he seemed about the whole thing; she can still hear his boyish voice; "Honestly, Amy, I'm not an imbecile, I've read medical texts-," Right. Medical texts. Fat lot of good that did either of them when they were rolling about in the long spring grass. Of course, she had other things on her mind at the time, and he... well, what did it matter to him? They were going to be together always. He'd likely written children off as an unpleasant but unavoidable consequence in the distant future. </p><p>“That’s wonderful,” Vera says uncertainly, letting go of her hand. “What does that mean for the clinic?”</p><p>“I have no idea,” Amy exhales. “They have savings from Teddy’s parents. They were talking about taking a break from work for a year or two, maybe going back to England themselves.”</p><p>She gave birth here, on on a ragged quilt atop the cold exam table. Sabath had delivered babies before but after a brief inspection, left her to it with the local midwife, who gave her something to bite down on and told her to think of waves crashing on the beach. She'd thought of Cornwall and the orphanage's yearly trips to the seashore, until the war broke out. She'd thought of the cold sand and the seashell Tom had given her, to tempt her into exploring the cave with him. She'd thought of the bloated corpses in the water, vomited twice during her labor until nothing came up but warm spittle, and then thought of the opposite of the ocean; the bonfires at Samhain, roaring to life in her belly, bearing down on this guest who'd overstayed their welcome for far too long. She'd thought of the heat of the flames baking her tears into her cheeks, screamed herself hoarse, and pushed Mae out into the world in the sputtering light of kerosene lanterns and the nauseating smell of burning sage.</p><p>“You can’t run this place full-time by yourself,” Vera points out sensibly, and Amy almost hates her for it.</p><p>“I can’t,” she agrees after a long silence. “I’d need to hire help, figure out new schedules… And the position at Hogwarts, it would double what I’m making here. They’d cover all of Mae’s school expenses as well- her books, her uniforms- everything.”</p><p>“But you don’t want to bring her back there,” Vera’s tone wavers between question and statement. The rock wall is beginning to lighten; Amy can feel the air warming up even as they sit here. Her tea is growing cold. She takes another sip, grimacing.</p><p>“I don’t know what I want right now. Yesterday, I knew exactly. I made a choice. I chose to leave. I chose to keep her. I chose to raise her here. Now… you know she found the letter last night. From Hogwarts.”</p><p>Vera sighs quietly. “Was she upset?” That seems like a moot point.</p><p>“Well, she wasn’t thrilled with me,” Amy mutters. “It’s not a wonderful feeling to feel properly shamed by your own child.” And she does. Feel shamed. She remembers her own exhilaration, her joy at receiving her letter from Hogwarts, at that first visit from a stranger. She was so happy. She was leaving Wool's. She was going somewhere else, somewhere she was sought out, wanted. They wanted her, for her powers. Even the idea of having powers thrilled her. Of being powerful. She'd spent eleven years of life feeling nothing but powerless. It was a heady rush, and Tom felt it even more so than her, she thinks. It was like they were walking on air.</p><p>“She’d be safe at Hogwarts,” Vera says. “From… from whatever you’re worried about.” </p><p>For Vera, of course, this is a domestic dispute, between two old childhood sweethearts. No less brutal and vicious, but not quite on the scale it takes up in Amy’s headspace. “He might just feel a duty to provide for her,” she adds in a softer voice, as if hesitant to even say it. “I know you… you have your reasons to want to be rid of him, but he hasn’t got any children of his own. He might just wonder… what it would be like.”</p><p>“Well, he will soon enough,” Amy finishes off the last of your tea. “You didn’t see the headlines in the society section, two months back? He’ll be married by this time next year. He can have plenty of little darlings with his society doll fiancee. Not her. She’s mine.” She knows her voice has grown ragged and rough. “The one- she’s the only thing I ever had all to myself. That I was responsible for. That… that loved me instantly. Mae is mine. Not his. He doesn’t… he doesn’t get any claim to her.”</p><p>“If he can find plausible evidence that he’s her father, he could take you to court over it,” Vera warns soberly. “If they obtain an order of Veritaserum-,”</p><p>“I know,” Amy bites out, closing her eyes, not wanting to think about as she feels the sun’s rays finally reach her face. “Unwed mother of dubious origins. Raising her child in some hovel in Gibraltar while she works like a dog healing gamblers and wannabe mobsters and idiot tourists. If I was a muggle they would have already taken her from me.” She can’t even say the rest. It is too painful. “I know, V.”</p><p>“You have to decide what’s best for both of you,” says Vera, “and you know Danny and I will do whatever we can to help you. Ruby would come back from New York in a heartbeat. But I would… I just wouldn’t do anything rash, Ames. I know you want nothing to do with him or his career or his life. But the job at Hogwarts… it might be the best thing for it. You’ll have Dippet and Dumbledore in your pocket, and the staff’s always been very close-knit. They have connections all over the place. They could really be useful, if it does… if he does escalate this.”</p><p>“The money wouldn’t hurt either,” Amy stands tiredly, rolls back her shoulders and groans. “Well. I should have seen it coming, really. Friends in high places and all that. Couldn’t keep scurrying around just out of sight forever.” Her tone is light, but the words fall like lead weights all the same. Vera stands as well, winces when she hears the clatter of footfall indoors. </p><p>“The boys are up already. We should start breakfast, yeah?”</p><p>Once back indoors, it’s easy to leave the coldly pragmatic conversation out to sit in the sun like her forgotten mug. Amy bustles around with Vera, dodging elbows in the tiny kitchen, scolding her rambunctious sons for not saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, cautioning Mae against pouring the orange juice so quickly, they don’t need another spill, thank you- She hasn’t sat down to eat her breakfast in over a decade, but she leans against the stained counter-top like always and licks bacon grease off her fingers while Mae sprays toast crumbs across the front of her pyjama top and Isaac and Joel jostle and argue over the last fried egg. </p><p>Despite their argument last night, Mae is utterly devoid of resentment or tension now, smiling toothily when she catches Amy’s eye, smearing jam across her toast as contentedly as ever, whistling along with the muggle radio station crackling from the windowsill. A child’s easy forgiveness is almost worse than the fights, Amy thinks. Maybe she doesn’t deserve to be forgiven. For any of it. She’s been living a lie. A safe, well-intended lie, but a lie nonetheless. If there’s anything Mae, bright and beautiful and glorious Mae-flower, hates, it’s being condescended or lied to. She could forgive the omission of her acceptance to Hogwarts. Amy knows she could never forgive the rest of, even if she wanted to.</p><p>If they go back, there is a strong possibility of Mae finding out. Amy always meant to tell her someday, but only after she was grown and settled herself, when she wouldn’t need a mother anymore, when she could hate Amy, ignore her letters, never see her again if she pleased, and still lead a prosperous life of her own with other people. You always find a family. You do, Amy knows that. She’s not worried about that, has never fretted about Mae not having a father or siblings or a ‘normal’ life. What she is worried about is her child hating her and that hate bringing her childhood to an abrupt end. Mae deserves better. She deserves a carefree, happy, easy life, where she doesn’t have to be afraid or hateful. </p><p>And she is worried about Tom, of course. Of course she is. She’d have to be willfully foolish not to worry. She assaulted him, in every sense of the word. She betrayed his trust and his body, blackmailed him- threatened him, really- and then left him lying there on the ground, paralyzed, drifting into unconsciousness, while she fled into the night like a coward. Well, she is a coward. She chose the coward’s way out, she didn’t stay and fight, and she doesn’t regret it, has never regretted it. She is not his chosen other half. She rejects the notion that she could not live a fulfilling life without him. She doesn’t believe in fate, and she doesn’t want ‘love to conquer all’. She has no interest in being conquered or succumbing to something that has always felt more like a free-fall than flying.</p><p>He has every reason to want to hurt her just as badly as she hurt him. And that would be one thing, if it were just her. But it’s not just her. It’s never been just her. And when she found out she was four months pregnant and that her lack of monthlies and the weight gain had not simply been the stress of uprooting her entire life and tearing out the remnants of dark magic across Europe all while constantly looking over her shoulder, constantly on edge, expecting him to show up at any moment, for her entire plan to cave in around her- well, she thought about this then too. She found out much later than most but she still could have done something, could have ended the pregnancy, ridden herself of any lingering, stubborn trace of him. She didn’t. She was selfish, and weak, and eighteen. </p><p>Mae doesn’t deserve any of this. Mae deserves a safe, happy life, not one where her mother has to seriously consider not just whether her father might try to take her away, but whether or not he might hurt her simply for the sake of hurting Amy. She should have left Mae off at an orphanage. She should have given her away to a nice family, a well-intentioned couple who could raise her in luxury and comfort. She should have known better than to think she could do this. She can’t do this. She is thirty years old and within the span of twelve hours and one little note, she has turned back into that same frightened girl, the one who almost stopped, who almost went back. The one who almost turned around, almost stayed. </p><p>She doesn’t know what would have happened if she stayed. Well, she does. She does know. It would have been a life of very comfortable captivity. Mae would have brothers and sisters, and a big house to run around and play in, and all the toys and clothes a little girl could ever want. She would have family dinners on the weekends, she would have tutors to teach her French and Latin and the piano and ballet. She would have splendid birthday parties with all her little friends looking on enviously while presents piled high around her, she would have a broom and a pony and she would never eat beans on toast for dinner. Her name wouldn’t be Mae, either, that would be far too gauche and common. </p><p>She would have a father rapidly climbing the ranks of government, a father who would likely ruffle her hair and kiss her on the forehead and buy her anything she liked, a father who would try to love her the only way he knew how, and if it was a cold, stunted, demanding sort of love, well, she wouldn’t know much different, would she? He would be genial and kind so long as she did what was expected of her and he would spend as much time with her as expected, if he didn’t have a meeting to attend to or a brief to read. </p><p>She would have a mother who sank deeper and deeper into quiet self-loathing with every year. She would have a mother who her father hated, he hated, with every fiber of his being because even after everything, all his efforts, she still was not happy. She would love him but she wouldn’t be happy with him, and it would infuriate him, and he would be cruel about it because he would not know any other way to be, and they would despise one another, and they would try to hide it from their children but it would seep into that house all the same, it would fester in the very air they breathed, and leak out at every opportunity. </p><p>Two days later all these thoughts are still rattling around like coins inside her head. She hates feeling paralyzed, feeling trapped. She hated it as a child, she hated it when she was eighteen and facing down the barrel of a life neatly laid out before, a slow, gruesome demise of any sense of self in the making, and she hates it now. She knows what she ought to do. She ought to leave. Go. Take Mae and run, disappear. Go over to the States; Ruby must have some connections, disappear into some big city, change both their names, dye her hair, and vanish. That would be the smart thing to do. How can she justify taking any measure of risk with her own daughter? She knows very well that Tom has no qualms at all about hurting others to get to her, and that was when he was doing it with what he considered the best of intentions- trying to prove how much he cared for her, how much he needed her by his side.</p><p> She doesn’t want to think about what he might be capable of doing now. He is stronger than her. She’s known that since she was fifteen. She is a far more capable dueler at thirty than she was back then, has been in plenty of dangerous situations before and had to rely on her own instincts and quick thinking, but somehow she doubts he’s simply spent the last decade reclining behind a desk with his feet up, smoking a pipe and growing fat around the middle. She may have improved, may be sharper, more cunning, resourceful and willing to do whatever it takes to win a fight, but he will still outclass her whether they’re using wands or not. Her sole advantage is that she knows how he thinks, and she knows how to trip him up. </p><p>Either way, she cannot rationalize bringing Mae into any of this. They just need to leave. Not immediately, but sometime this summer or fall at the latest. It will be painful, and terrible for Mae, she won’t understand, she’ll be furious, but Amy will figure out some excuse, come up with some plausible story. She’ll home-school her if she has to, no matter how limited an education that might be. She’ll teach her to defend her, make sure she knows to be careful, that just because she’s a witch does not guarantee invincibility, and- and when the time comes she will tell her the truth. That Amy did it out of love for her. That she had no choice. She was just trying to protect her, to keep her away from all of this. And Mae will hate her.</p><p>“Mum, you look like you’re going to cry,” Mae tells her bemusedly as they walk back to the clinic after seeing Vera and her sons off. “Auntie V said they’d come visit again in the summer.”</p><p>Amy composes herself, plasters on an exasperated smile. “It’s just the dust. What, you think I’m going that soft already, huh?” And her daughter bursts into peals of high, childish laughter as she tickles her around the middle, squirming and giggling, swatting at her hands. Amy kisses her hot scalp, winces into the setting sun looming down on them overhead, and tries to quell the buzzing in her head and stomach and chest, a thousand anxious gnats, with little success.</p><p>How can she do this? How can she do any of this? This is ridiculous. She can’t spend the rest of her life on the run. She can’t spend it huddled in a series of shabby flats, always double checking the locks, either. Tom’s proved he’s very capable of tracking them down. For Merlin’s sake, he found their address, didn’t he? God knows how long he’s had that up his sleeve, waiting for the right moment. When she was a child at Wool’s, all she wanted was to stop running, to finally have a home, somewhere she felt safe and secure. She didn’t want to worry about bombs or planes or sirens. So what? Now she’s going to put Mae through the same thing, have her live a life full of tension and fear and anger over something that’s not her fault? Her blood broils; motherhood might have tempered her impulses the way it does most, but in other ways it’s also made her more of a live-wire. </p><p>How dare he. This is her life. She fought for it, she earned it. She tricked him. Her, unassuming, humble, little Amy Benson. She outwitted him, everyone’s favorite savant. She is nobody’s fool, least of all his. He underestimated her once, underestimated the lengths to which she would go, and he’s still doing it, all these years later. If he thinks he’s going to send her running like a kicked dog, he’s got another thing coming. And if he thinks she’s going to dutifully present herself for whatever sick judgement he think she deserves, well, then he’s going to be sorely disappointed. </p><p>No. She needs to think like him. Who is one of the few people Tom is actually afraid of? Dumbledore. Therefore it stands to reason that the last thing he’d want her to… would be to go back to Hogwarts. Under no circumstances would he ever want the possibility of Amy, who knows some of his ugliest secrets, working alongside Dumbledore, who has always seen more of what he really is than most people. She’s chopping the vegetables for dinner a little harder than necessary now, while Mae sighs over her homework at the kitchen table, casting longing looks outside. “Why don’t you take the bike out for a ride,” Amy suggests, and some newfound hardness in her tone makes her daughter look up in surprise.</p><p>“What’d I do now?” Mae demands. “I even kissed Joel and Isaac goodbye-,”</p><p>“Nothing,” says Amy, “but I can see you getting ready to crawl up the walls. Go out before it gets too dark, and come back in an hour for dinner.”</p><p>“Alright,” Mae says suspiciously, flinging down her chewed-upon pencil, and shoving her feet back into her shoes. </p><p>Once Amy is sure that she’s gone, she leaves the cooking, goes upstairs, and sits down to write her reply.</p>
