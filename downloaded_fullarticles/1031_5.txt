    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p> The blazing heatwave that blew through England had stayed longer than expected. Aunt Petunia had taken to lounging on the sofa in a bathing suit with a handheld fan while my Uncle Vernon resorted to vacuuming down whole pints of ice cream in an effort to cool off. I was too stubborn to let the heat get to me. I came out to the backyard every day, regardless of the temperature. In the backyard, my Aunt and Uncle had let me set up a punching bag. Of course, I was only allowed such a luxury because Dudley wanted it and, whatever the brat wanted, he got. I was able to use it when Dudley wasn’t around, though, so I chose not to complain. </p><p><br/>
 My wrapped fists made a loud thumping sound as I landed blows on the bag. The sun was unrelenting, beating down on my shoulders and the back of my neck. Those areas were already an angry shade of red and the salty sweat that covered my body in a thick layer made the sting even worse. I didn’t stop coming out, though. Practicing was more important than a silly little sunburn. </p><p><br/>
 The end of my fourth year at Hogwarts had been one of the worst to date. My last vivid memory had kept me up every night since the school year ended. The image of my brother huddled over the dead body of Cedric Diggory and screaming about Voldemort’s return. A surge of new energy forced my fists to hit the bag harder, though my lungs were heaving with exhaustion. Seeing my brother that way, knowing what had started; it terrified me. It kept me from sleep and plagued my dreams with horrible nightmares. Voldemort was back, had already killed, and was now nowhere to be found. He’d been so close to my brother. That part was always the worst. Knowing how close he’d been to stealing my brother from me. Sometimes in my nightmares, I’d be forced to stare into Harry’s cold, dead eyes. I usually woke up screaming. </p><p><br/>
 But I wasn’t the only one. Nor was I experiencing the worst of it. Harry had been having nightmares, too. He talked and screamed in his sleep, too. But, in his dreams, he was forced to relive that night in a different, much worse way. He’d been distant, more closed off lately. I was there for him as best as I could be, but seeing him this way was difficult. At night, I allowed my sadness to take over. I huddled up at the corner of my bed and cried – making sure to be quiet so no one would know. But during the day, I didn’t feel like crying. During the day, I wanted to scream, to throw something, to hit something. So outside I came to train myself. </p><p><br/>
 My sore muscles burned by the time I stopped. Coming out of my head and back into the present-day was disappointing. I felt useless, powerless. Somewhere out there, Voldemort was back to find us and kill us. There was nothing I could do to stop it and I couldn’t decide if that fact made me more angry or anxious. </p><p><br/>
 Every small movement made my sunburnt back, shoulders, and neck scream in pain as I limped through the house on sore legs. Up the stairs, and into the bathroom I went. My hair and body were so drenched in sweat that I looked like I’d jumped in a pool. The shower knobs squeaked as I turned the cold water on. Stripping out of my clothes made me hiss in pain but, when I got the burns under the cold water, I felt relief. </p><p><br/>
 I closed my eyes and allowed my tired lungs to draw in steady breaths. My mind wandered back to dark places. Voldemort was coming for us. It was inevitable. The only uncertainty was when he would show himself – and whether or not we’d be ready. It made my heart race to think that we may not be. It made me want to go back outside and keep training until I was invincible enough to feel safe. But the reality was that I knew no amount of training would make me feel ready. No matter how well I could defend myself, the fear that suffocated me would still be there. The possibility of feeling safe or normal kept slipping further and further out of my reach with each passing day. </p><p><br/>
 Once I’d thoroughly scrubbed the dirt and sweat from my body, I stepped out, dried myself off, and threw on my jumbled clothes. Stood in front of the bathroom mirror, I started to brush out my drenched hair. The girl I stared at in the mirror didn’t seem like me. The 5’4 girl clad in a giant black t-shirt and shorts with soaked copper hair, light green eyes, and pale skin seemed the same. It was the dark circles under my eyes and the tired look on my face that made me unfamiliar to myself. I wasn’t the only one either. Harry’s eyes had acquired the same tired, trauma-induced dullness to them. I couldn’t explain why seeing it in his eyes scared me more than seeing it in my own. </p><p><br/>
 I could hear the front door creak open downstairs and hurried to finish my hair so I could leave the bathroom. Harry had taken to leaving the house on his own, spending most of his days on the open lands outside our suburb. He’d spend all day out there by himself. I typically didn’t go with him. I understood that being alone was his way of coping. Just like training was mine. But Harry hadn’t been his usual self towards me and, even though I gave him his privacy, I always hoped for our old relationship every time he came home.</p><p><br/>
Once the knots were out of my hair, I threw it up into a messy bun and scurried down the stairs. On my way down, however, I heard Vernon and Petunia’s fussing and cooing from the living room. Dudley must have come home, then. He’d taken to leaving the house, too. He would be out all day with his juvenile friends. Every time they came to the house, I wanted to punch their annoying, pre-pubescent looking faces.</p><p><br/>
 The scene I came upon when I entered the living room wasn’t one I expected. Harry was sitting at the kitchen counter, staring at Vernon and Petunia as they worried over a seated Dudley. He sat in the armchair completely dazed with a garbage bin wrapped in his arms. </p><p><br/>
 “Uh, what’s going on here?” I spoke up as I watched Dudley rock back and forth. Vernon snapped his disdainful gaze to me, showing his teeth in a way I knew he thought was threatening.</p><p> <br/>
 “Your devil of a brother has finally done it,” He exclaimed, “He’s finally driven the boy loony!” </p><p><br/>
 “Vernon! Don’t say that!” Petunia hissed. I looked at Harry, hoping to find an answer. He sat with his hands folded in his lap and that look in his eye. The look he always had when something had happened. I raised my eyebrows at him, silently asking for answers. He shook his head at me and shrugged his shoulders as a reply. </p><p><br/>
 “Oh, just look at him, Petunia! The poor boys gone nutty!” Vernon scuffed, waving a hand at his son. Petunia glared at him and squeezed Dudley’s shoulders tightly, cooing in his ear quietly. Vernon turned his beady eyes towards me with a glare of pure distaste. He took my upper arm in a vice grip and shoved me in Harry’s direction angrily. I stumbled on my feet, but Harry jumped from his seat and caught me before I fell. With an angry look in his eyes, Harry waited for me to steady myself before shoving me behind him. He knew I could take them down if I needed to, but my heart warmed at his protectiveness nonetheless. I grabbed his wrist and squeezed lightly, sending him a quick, appreciative nod. </p><p><br/>
 “I’ve had enough of the two of you, you hear? This is the last time I’m gonna put up with you and your nonsense!” Vernon seethed. I grimaced as I watched the spit fly from his mouth. </p><p><br/>
 Whatever retort Harry or I was about to throw Vernon’s way was cut off when a bird launched itself through the open back door and into the room. A loud thump greeted our ears when the bird hit the ceiling. The poor thing screeched when its head met the solid surface and then he plummeted to the floor. And that’s when I saw the letter. The bird was an owl, delivering a message. The small owl flipped himself right side up and screeched at us before flying out the way he came as if he hadn’t just given himself a head injury. </p><p><br/>
 Suddenly, the letter flew into the air, the back of the letter morphing into an almost face. The black wax insignia had turned into lips, which moved as the letter began to speak.</p><p><br/>
 “Dear Mr. Potter,” The letter began, “the Ministry has received word that at 6:23 of this evening, you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a muggle. As this is a violation of the clear restriction of underage sorcery, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.” </p><p><br/>
 Silence filled the room as the letter’s face disappeared and it regained gravity. My eyes were wide and my mouth agape. I dug my nails into Harry’s wrist, pulling him to face me. Before I could begin to interrogate my brother, Vernon’s gruff, annoying voice rang out.</p><p><br/>
 “Ah! Finally, some justice!” He celebrated, smiling at us gleefully. I glared at my rotund, infuriating Uncle. If he had been closer, I’d have punched him hard enough to make him as loopy as his son. </p><p><br/>
 “Vernon,” Petunia spoke up, “what are we going to do about Dudley?” She questioned worriedly. Vernon sighed and turned to his wife and dazed son.</p><p><br/>
 “We’ll have to take him to the hospital.” He grumbled as he pulled Dudley to his feet. </p><p><br/>
 “You!” Vernon shouted at me, “Be useful and open the door for us.” </p><p><br/>
 I scuffed at him, but let go of Harry’s wrist and walked to the door. The thump of Harry’s footsteps sounded out behind me as I stood in the doorway, watching Vernon and Petunia sneak to the car. I shook my head at the way they were acting. Their shallowness and the lengths they went to in order to keep their reputation continued to astound me. With a sigh, I stepped away from the doorway and allowed the door to shut. Just as the door clicked into place a loud bang from upstairs made me jump. I pinched the bridge of my nose and then began my ascent up the stairs and to the room Harry and I shared. </p><p><br/>
 Harry had his forearms and forehead against the wooden doors of his wardrobe when I walked in.</p><p><br/>
 “I guess I don’t need to ask what that bang was,” I said, announcing my presence. Harry slowly peeled himself off of the wardrobe with a deep sigh. He stooped down, picking up the moving picture of our parents dancing in each other’s arms. </p><p><br/>
 “Sorry.” He apologized distractedly as he straightened. He turned around and slumped down onto his bed, setting the picture on his nightstand and staring at it. I sat on my twin-sized bed against the opposite wall, watching my brother gaze at our parent’s photo sadly. </p><p><br/>
 “Harry, what the hell happened?” I asked gently. He looked down at his lap and his left hand reached up to tangle in the back of his black tresses. </p><p><br/>
 “Dudley and I were attacked by Dementors.” He sighed, looking up at me and pushing his round glasses up his nose. My heart stopped for a moment. Yet another opportunity for the world to take my brother away from me. I sputtered for a moment before swallowing and starting again.</p><p><br/>
 “What?! Why the hell would Dementors attack you?” I questioned, outrage on the tip of my tongue. “This - this is why they expelled you? They can't do that! You were defending yourself!” </p><p><br/>
 “Look ‘Lena, I don’t really want to talk about it right now.” Harry retorted harshly. I raised an eyebrow at him – he wasn’t the type to be snappy with me. He knew I’d have his ass for it. </p><p><br/>
 “Sorry.” He apologized again. The torment in his eyes made me soften. Harry had the tendency to get snappy when he was dealing with something difficult. Witnessing someone’s murder and then having to fight off a grown man hell-bent on killing you would definitely count as difficult. I’d let him have it this time. </p><p><br/>
 “It's fine, I get it.” I reassured him, “But I just – you know that I’m here, right? That I love you and I’d do anything for you?” A small smirk stretched on my brother’s face.</p><p><br/>
 “Anything, huh? Including doing my laundry?” He questioned, mischief in his eyes. I scoffed, rolling my eyes in an overexaggerated way.</p><p><br/>
 “Let's not go that far,” I replied playfully. And for the first time since the end of our fourth year, my brother and I laughed. We were smiling. Neither of us content, but at least we had each other.</p><p><br/>
 “I love you, Har Bear.” I teased, ruffling his hair. He groaned at the dumb nickname, but for once didn’t fight it. He and I stood up, meeting in the middle for a bear hug. </p><p><br/>
 “I love you too, Lena.”</p>
