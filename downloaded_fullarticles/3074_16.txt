His cock twitched against his thigh, thick and heavy with arousal.</p><p>“Okay, you can clean it up now. Do you have a cloth?” Draco said, propping himself up onto his elbows.</p><p>Harry blinked. “What?”</p><p>“It’s sticky.”</p><p>“But...I was going to lick it off you.”</p><p>“What? But that’s dirty. Why would you do that?”</p><p>“It’s <i>supposed</i> to be sexy.”</p><p>“Since when has being unclean been sexy?”</p><p>“Draco, what the hell did you think I meant when I said I was going to cover you in syrup and slowly clean it off you with my tongue?”</p><p>“I don’t know! Next time don’t ask me important questions when—” Draco squeaked as Harry leant down and lapped up the syrup that he’d drizzled over one nipple.</p><p>“So...should I get a cloth, or do you want me to continue like this?” he murmured, tonguing sticky trails across pale skin.</p><p>Draco grunted and arched his back. “Don’t you <i>dare</i> stop.”</p></div>
