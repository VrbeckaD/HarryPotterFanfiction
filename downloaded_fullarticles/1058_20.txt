          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry Potter , student of Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardry and Triwizard Champion walked in to the Great hall with his best friend and fellow misfit Gryffindor , Neville Longbottom and they both took seats at the end of the Gryffindor table with no one sitting near them exempt Luna lovegood the third to their trio of misfits and actually a Ravenclaw but no one said she could not sit with us besides she was bullied by the people in her house like we were by the people in our house.Suddenly Headmaster Dumbledore stood a d the whole hall quited to listen he said</p>
<p>" There will be a Yule Ball held over the Christmas Break for fourth years and above but you may bring a younger student as your date if you may desire now commence with the food!" He stared longingly at his food as he imaged asking his crush to the ball but he did not have enough courage and they probably were not even gay Harry sighed and turned his attention to Neville and Lunas conversation.</p>
<p>"You should so ask him " Said Luna to Neville , they both knew about my crush on Draco and Nevilles crush on Blaise and Luna would not admit she has a crush of Parkinson.</p>
<p>"Should we do it all at the same time ? We could arrange something to make them go separate ways and ask them all at the same time " Said Harry</p>
<p>"I don't have anyone I want to ask " said Luna</p>
<p>" Your not fooling anyone Luna we both now you have a crush on Pansy "</p>
<p>" Okay fine " said Luna blushing</p>
<p>"Okay what if we wait until they go to classes they don't have together and approach them?" Said Neville</p>
<p>" Okay I know Draco has Ancient Runes second tommorow and that he has that without Blaise or Pansy and I know Blaise has Arithmacy while Draco has Ancient Runes ,Does anyone know what Pansy has ?"</p>
<p>"She has Divination , so they all have separate classes second so let's ask them right before because we have a free period all together for second ."</p>
<p>Neville gaped at them looking form Harry to Luna " You guys are the biggest stalkers ever "</p>
<p>Harry took one last glance at Draco and then they got up and Neville and him headed to Gryffindor and Luna headed to Ravenclaw.Once he and Neville got there they headed straight for their dorms because their dorm mates would usually stay in the common until very late which suited them just fine.They went straight to sleep after they changed both thinking about when they would ask their crushes to the ball.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The next day right after their first class</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry and Neville had just spilt up to find their boys and Harry was super nervous. He spotted Draco and fast walked toward him , he was alone. </p>
<p>" Can I talk to you please ?"</p>
<p>"Sure "</p>
<p>"Wouldyouliketogototheballwithme?" </p>
<p>"What?" Draco said with a slight smile he thought that Harry is cute when he is nervous.</p>
<p>"Um, Would you go to the ball with me?"Harry said nervously only a little slower.</p>
<p>"I would love to go to the ball you "</p>
<p>"Really ?" Harry said suprised he felt like he was in a dream</p>
<p>"Of course, I'll owl you what I'm going to wear so we can match colors  "said Draco and walked in to his Ancient  Runes class right as the bell rang.</p>
<p>He walked excitedly to an unused classroom near Gryffindor tower , where they has agreed  to meet after they asked their crushes out to the ball. He found both of them already there smiling huge smiles at him.</p>
<p>"So , I'm guessing they both said yes " Harry said excitedly</p>
<p>"Uh huh " said Luna at the same time as Neville said "Yup"</p>
<p>"Yay we agree got our dream dates , we need to go shopping for robes in Hogsmeade" none of them got them in school shopping because they had wanted to see what they needed them for first and they could always go to Hogsmeade for one or owl order one.</p>
<p>"Maybe I should ask Pansy to go dress shopping together she is really fashionable ."</p>
<p><em>Bbbbring </em> the bell rang and they all scrambled to get to their next class.</p>
