  <strong>1st May 1998</strong>
</p>
<p><br/>Narcissa Malfoy's wrath was something incredible to behold. She barely every lost her cool but when it came to her son she would have walked barefoot through hell. She squared up to her husband looking to him like one of the Furies.</p>
<p><br/>"Do you understand what you have done?" she spat out at him.</p>
<p><br/>"He will be fine Narcissa, the mudblood will be no match for him, it will be an easy assignment which will get him into the Dark Lord's good graces."</p>
<p><br/>"You fool," she sneered, the resemblance to her sister Bellatrix becoming suddenly very apparent to her husband, "you have condemned him to death."</p>
<p><br/>"Narcissa calm down, I know that she has bested him in class but she does not have Draco's knowledge of the dark arts, she will not use the unforgivables, you over estimate her." Lucius Malfoy tried to reassure his wife, but she would not be placated.</p>
<p><br/>"No, you underestimate her, the power she has over Draco is far greater than any of the dark arts, he will die before he will touch her."<br/>For the first time Lucius Malfoy looked at his wife with a little less confidence.</p>
<p><br/>â€œYou have trained him well Lucius, he shows almost nothing of his emotions, but I am his mother, I see the signs that others do not, he will not kill the girl". Narcissa was adamant. "He will not kill her and the Dark Lord will kill him for his failure!"</p>
<p><br/>Comprehension began to dawn on Lucius for the first time.</p>
<p><br/>"No he cannot... he cannot have feelings for that girl... she is nothing, he's a Malfoy...that would be absurd," he stuttered.</p>
<p><br/>"Would it Lucius?" Narcissa questioned, "why, because you forbid it?"</p>
<p><br/>"Narcissa, the Dark Lord has taken measures to assist Draco, I am sure he cannot fail."</p>
<p><br/>"You bloody arrogant fool, don't you understand, the forbidden fruit is always the sweetest." Narcissa all but snarled at her husband.</p>
<p><br/>Lucius was stunned, not only by the manner of his wife's address but also by her words.</p>
<p><br/>"Do you really know your own son so little?' She questioned as she continued her rant. "What has he always wanted?"</p>
<p><br/>"He has wanted for nothing Narcissa," Lucius' tone became clipped as his own anger began to rise.</p>
<p><br/>"Nothing except the pride in his achievements that you have refused to show him and the love of a girl you have forbidden him." She paused ready to take another line of attack.</p>
<p><br/>"Do you really think a boy, so brilliant and gifted, would settle for one of the limp, preened and pampered pure blood princesses you foist upon him. You have taught him to want the best and you have left him conflicted. That girl is the best by all measures except one." She took a deep breath to calm herself before she finished with deadly sincerity. "You had better hope that Potter succeeds because if he does not we will never see our son again."</p>
<p><br/>With that Narcissa stormed away, a swirl of black robes and blond hair like lightening tearing through a thunderous dark cloud.</p>
