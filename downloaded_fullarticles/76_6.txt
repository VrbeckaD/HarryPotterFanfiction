<p class="p1" align="center">“I desire the things that will destroy me in the end.” ― Sylvia Plath<br/> <br/> ❇<br/> <br/>1981</p>
<p class="p1" align="center"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The kitchen window was left open last night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surely it was Mum in one of her sleepless ambles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shivering, I pulled the windows in and tightened the latch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a dusting of snow on the sill and I pressed my fingers into it absently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through the glass and criss-crossed iron I could see the river, a mile away, already freezing along its banks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Past that, in the village, the church steeple punctured the bellies of fat granite clouds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only several people were braving the cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From here they were small black dots like crows.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I glanced at my watch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was eight o’clock and Mum and Dad would be up soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With bare feet padding over the chilly stone, I set to making their breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A quiet prayer that she remembered things today escaped me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was easier when she remembered; it made Dad happier.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Incendio.</em>” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The ancient gas stove burst to life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the teakettle brewing I heated Mum’s cast iron skillet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their hens’ eggs were scattered in odd places around the refrigerator, not where they should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I at last found the butter in with the silverware.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My jaw tightened; it wasn’t a good sign. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">While the pan grew hot my eyes traveled back out the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would snow again today, surely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe I would Apparate to Godric’s Hollow rather than deal with the late trains.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">My fingers gripped the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hadn’t been back to the wizarding village since Lily and James’s murders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dozens of vials, full of priceless herbs and tonics, remained there from her pregnancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t bring myself to reclaim them but now I had no choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were my livelihood; my landlord was losing patience after another late rent.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Maybe I was mad for staying in London during such times, but despite the danger I could stay hidden in plain sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lost in a crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Godric’s Hollow there was nowhere to hide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if the protective spells didn’t save Lily and James Potter—two of the most talented wizards of our age—then I wouldn’t stand a chance.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I cracked an egg in the pan, but the iron had grown too hot over the flame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whites seared with a horrible sound like molten flesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A whimper escaped me and I saw it, the scene I’d imagined over and over for weeks: James’s glasses cracked on the floor, Lily’s hair twisted around her face, almost suffocating her, their bodies hard and pale. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Poor baby Harry…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I threw the pan in the sink and opened the window again before the Muggle fire detector could rouse Mum and Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the cold air rushing over my feverish skin I noticed, past my shaking hands, one of the eggs had splattered onto the floor.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Chloe?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mum.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pocketed my wand before she saw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry, did I wake you?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She hugged a wooly cardigan tightly around her nightgown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s freezing, darling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you forget to turn on the heat?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I flushed because in truth I had only thought to perform a Heating Charm for myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Old habits die hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before I could answer she said, “You’ve gone all pink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sit down and let me finish.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“All right.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally I would have protested, but it meant she was feeling herself today. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Your father is still lazing in bed, that man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’m sure as soon as he smells bacon…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Reaching past me, she latched the window once more while I poured the tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We stepped around one another with the familiarity of having spent decades in the same kitchen together, doing just this. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Before she could set out three pieces of toast I said, “Just enough for you and Dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve got to head back to London.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It took me less than five minutes to tell the first lie.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mum gave me the familiar glance-over and managed to control her insistence that I eat more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In truth I <em>hadn’t</em> been eating, but I couldn’t even begin to explain why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Leaving so soon?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her disappointment was audible.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I pulled the sleeves of my jumper over my knuckles, clutching the fabric tightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lots of early Christmas orders to manage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m up to my eyeballs in poinsettia deliveries.”<br/> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Two lies.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But I can come and visit you over the weekend,” I added upon her silent nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I heard Dad say the sheep fence needs rebuilding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’d be better to finish before the next big snow.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Chloe, I hardly think you’re the man for the job,” she tutted, waving her spatula at my stature.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well, Mum, I <em>do</em> have one advantage…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At her silence I continued gently, “Only a few levitating spells, I promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wouldn’t take five minutes and it would save Dad a lot of back pain, and you wouldn’t have to hire one of the neighbors.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“We’ll see.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The room was silent other than the crackling of eggs and bacon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smell would normally send my stomach rumbling, but I could barely manage to swallow my tea these days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried another sip but it tasted like iron.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She would barely meet my eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Speaking of… <em>that… </em>One of your owls came by very late last night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to wake you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to even my voice, but my throat was already filling with bile. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Not only was my mother awake all night, the paranoia and insomnia eating away at her, but the Order knew not to send owls here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If someone only had time to scribble on a parchment, the message could not have been a good one. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I swallowed thickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Where is it?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“On the little table near the sofa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t read it, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Despite feeling of a frightened bird being trapped in my chest, I stood behind her and squeezed her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know you didn’t, Mum.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pressed my trembling lips to her grey hair.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The arched doorway to the den looked like a mouth waiting to swallow me whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The room was pitch black, the curtains drawn as usual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More than anything I wanted to use a <em>Lumos</em> spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I flicked on the lamp I spotted the parchment envelope on the pile of unopened post.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It contrasted with the the colorful grocery coupons and the newspapers where the pictures didn’t move.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no writing on the envelope; the seal bore no emblem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quickly I tore it open.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was Sirius’s handwriting; I would recognize that scrawling anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I swallowed the knot in my throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now wasn’t the time for such things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The letter contained only two sentences.</span>
</p>
<p class="p4" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Marlene is dead.</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p4" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Come here as soon as you read this.</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It wasn’t how it was with the news of Lily and James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The room wasn’t spinning; I didn’t have to run and be sick in the bin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like the walls were expanding around me, or like I was growing smaller.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The silence was becoming a sound itself, a kind of pressure in my eardrums.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Dead.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Marlene McKinnon, my best friend, was dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had more than likely been murdered by supporters of You-Know-Who.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we hadn’t been speaking to each other for over a month.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Anything important?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mum peered into the dimness as if afraid to come in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She might as well have been staring into the portal to another world: mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter what I told her, she could never possibly understand the contents of the letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And she wouldn’t want to.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Just my flatmate.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My voice was surprisingly strong.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Three lies. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve got to head back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s been some kind of problem with our heating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reckon she didn’t leave the faucet running and our pipes have burst.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was speaking faster and faster, trying to remember where I’d left my bloody coat and suitcase and wishing I could just use a Summoning Spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Mum watched helplessly, unconvinced, but unwilling to ask more. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">With my wool coat and scarf thrown on haphazardly, I pressed another kiss to her cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tell Dad that I’m sorry I missed him, and that I’ll be back on Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Call you tomorrow!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Her uneasily murmured “Alright, dear,” barely reached my ears before I was out the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My feet were suddenly stinging with cold; I had forgotten to put on my boots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there was no time to go back inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My heaving breath billowed before me and I pulled my body from the steadfastness of the door, walking only quickly enough to not raise suspicion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was certainly watching from behind closed curtains.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The dirt drive to our house was long and winding, and as soon as I passed the first bend beside the pasture I fell into the snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sheep watched me with their black watery eyes, uninterested, and in my wildness I envied them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My lungs had collapsed and wouldn’t open again; the sobs were too heavy, and only when I thought I would pass out did the first rattling breath come sweeping into the vacuum of my lungs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With my cheek pressed into the snow I cried and thought of Marlene, and the last time I saw her: the way her white-blonde hair whipped through space as she Apparated, with a thunderous <em>CRACK!,</em> away from Sirius’s Cruciatus Curse.</span>
