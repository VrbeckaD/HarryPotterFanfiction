'more than. you, baby?'</p><p>'more than,' remus took his free hand, pressing his lips to each of his fingers before lacing them with his. 'love you.'</p><p>sirius' smile widened, eyes prickling with... with <em>emotion</em>, with love for remus, with the overwhelming feeling of having remus in his life as <em>his</em>, and <em>his only.</em></p><p>'oh, love, are you crying?' remus cupped sirius' face. 'im sorry. im sorry i made you cry,' bemused, remus kissed away the tear that ran down his cheek. 'why are you crying, love?'</p><p>sirius sniffed, lightly shoving remus, 'just love you a lot, is all.'</p><p>remus paused. 'cute. you're cute. c'mere,' he sat up, pulling sirius with him so that remus was straddling him. he wrapped his arms around sirius, holding him in a tight embrace because his words had failed him and he just wanted to let sirius know how much love he held for him in his heart.</p><p>'baby,' sirius hid his face into remus' neck. 'love you.'</p><p>'more,' remus dropped a kiss in his hair, squeezing sirius tight as if he might slip away any moment. 'alright there, love?'</p><p>'with you, always.' sirius nuzzled remus' neck.</p><p>remus laughed and shied away, 'you're tickling me.'</p><p>'right,' sirius rolled his eyes, smiling. 'i keep forgetting you're ticklish as hell. c'mere, then.'</p><p>grabbing his hand, sirius crawled back to lie comfortably on remus' bed, the two boys in love facing each other, talking about everything and nothing, remus playing with sirius' fingers and sirius committing every detail of remus' face to memory.</p><p>it was moments like these that made sirius close his eyes and think of when he conjures his patronus, thinking of the feeling of being loved by remus and remus in his arms and remus kissing him and remus telling him he loves him back and <em>remusremusremusremus</em>.</p></div>
