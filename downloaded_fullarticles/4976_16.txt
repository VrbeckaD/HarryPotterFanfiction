          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius waits until he knows Harry's asleep to slip into his room.</p>
<p>Actually, he waits until Harry <i>thinks</i> he's tricked Sirius into believing he's asleep. </p>
<p>Harry's breathing is far too shallow and his fingers twitch as if he can barely keep himself from reaching out as Sirius approaches the bed.</p>
<p>Sirius pulls the sheets back and reveals Harry's smooth, bare skin to the dimly lit room.</p>
<p>He licks his lips and brushes a thumb across one of Harry's nipples, watching as it tightens and hardens under his touch.</p>
<p>Sirius then spreads his palm wide and runs it down Harry's abdomen. He hears the hitch in Harry's breath when he reaches his cock. </p>
<p>He's already hard but he <i>is</i> fifteen.</p>
<p>Sirius almost stops. Fifteen seems so young.</p>
<p>Yet....</p>
<p>Harry's hips shift, tiny thrusts into Sirius's fist, and Sirius knows he won't be able to resist. Not that he's even trying.</p>
<p>Besides, at fifteen, he'd have happily taken all the handjobs and blowjobs he could get.</p>
<p>Nothing's changed.</p>
<p>Sirius bends his head, knows Harry will come within moments. He always does.</p>
<p>After that, Sirius will straddle Harry's chest, cradle his head in his hands, and push his cock between Harry's full lips.</p></div>
