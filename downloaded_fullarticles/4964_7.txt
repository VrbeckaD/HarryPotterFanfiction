    <p>Harry had always wanted a home. Number four, Privet drive had never been that. Simultaneously too loud and too quiet, but never welcoming; it was a picture perfect house in a place that was devoid of personality. It looked as if the same house had been cloned all along the street. The only place there that had ever felt remotely safe was his cupboard, with spiders that scared Petunia away and was much too small for Dudley and Vernon to get in. </p><p>Hogwarts came close. For a while, he thought it had been, but now, with everything done, he knew it wasn’t. The wizard could see death everywhere in the school, it reeked of it. It was the same in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Little reminders of people who weren’t there anymore, physical scars left in the stone of walls or emotional ones in the emptiness of the classrooms. Flashes of spells used in the repair of Magical Britain, which alternately made him think of the excitable Dennis Creevey, who carried his camera everywhere, and danger, leaving him tense and weary at the end of every visit. He knew that Hogwarts wasn’t his home, because he no longer felt safe there. No longer felt the warmth of the castle when he entered the front doors, couldn’t bear to visit unless he had to. </p><p>The Burrow, what little time he spent there, during the summer holidays, during the time that should have been his seventh year, but was instead spent on the run from the ministry, living in a tent that, while magically larger on the inside, still felt too small for three people, then two, then three to hide in for most of a year, had also come close to being home. </p><p>The Burrow had, however, taught him most about family. The things that even staying at Grimmauld place with Sirius hadn’t taught him. Affection, boisterous fun, shouting, yelling, impromptu Quidditch matches, sleepy, lazy mornings with Mrs. Weasley making breakfast, serving him extra helpings when he wasn’t looking because he was ‘much too skinny, dear’ and evenings in front of the fireplace, the whole family crowded into that one room, with the wizarding radio playing The Weird Sisters,  playing exploding snap, the twins plotting in one corner, Percy reading quietly in the other corner (when not in his room panicking over cauldron thickness) , Mr. Weasley asking Hermione about electricity in between rounds, and Mrs. Weasley sighing at her husbands obsession while observing the whole room in a matronly way, and glancing suspiciously at the twins every now and then. </p><p>But effects of the war had seeped in slowly over the past few years, from the glaring absence of Fred (and the silent, withdrawn George, half of a whole, the one left behind) to the scars on Bills face, and Percy’s eagerness to repair the damage he had done by choosing the Ministry over his family, and Ron and Hermione, who, finally together after years of countless arguments, were hopelessly in love and rushing into engagement, and Ginny who stared at him, declarations of love in her eyes, but still ridiculously naïve, even after being in the battle, who still thought they could be together, have a ‘happily ever after’,  even after…even after he had died, changing him suddenly from the man-child who still thought in black and white to a man who realized that that wasn’t really true, that everything was just shades of grey, even if he couldn’t explain why he had changed.</p><p>The Burrow was a home, but wasn’t quite his home. Harry knew he was welcome there, but it wasn’t quite right. Felt like he was dressing up in Dudley’s five times too large cast offs, leaving him awkward and uncomfortable, tense in case he tripped over the hem, stepping over boundaries that he was unaware of. </p><p>So he left. Packed his belongings into his school trunk, shrinking his broom and text books to fit the things he had picked up over the years, and left, creeping out the house early in the morning after another night of nightmares, muted except for the vivid red of blood and piercing screams. He placed a note on the kitchen table with a hastily scrawled note comprising of ‘Going home, Harry x’ in his chicken-scratch writing, propped up against the fruit bowl, and was gone. </p><p>He didn’t know where home was, not yet, but he would find it.</p>
