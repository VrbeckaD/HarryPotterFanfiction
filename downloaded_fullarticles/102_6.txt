    <p>The room they were in was really big, adorned with gold and emerald greens. The king sized bed was as soft as a feather, covered with silky sheets and comfy pillows. The massive windows had opened green curtains lined with golden threads that intertwined to create intricate patterns. Right in front of the bed, a massive oak desk was scattered with sheets of paper and a few baby toys. Then, on the left of the bed, opposite the window, there was a little crib made of pure gold. There laid a few different plushies: a horse, a black snake, a green snake and a wolf. A little toy hammer laid there as well, wrapped tightly in the arms of a black haired child.</p>
<p>Said child was a true beauty. Pale skin, black hair, soft pouty lips and a round, soft baby face. He was sleeping soundly after a long, long day, his face peaceful and his body relaxed. If the boy wasn't sleeping, tho, you would have been able to see what made him one of the most beautiful child in the entire reign: two bright, emerald green eyes that completed his angelic look perfectly.</p>
<p>The only flaw, if you could even call it that, was the little lightning bolt scar that the boy had on the forehead. It didn't matter too much tho, because what once was a bleeding cut was now just a pale, almost silvery, mark that made the baby look even more angelic.</p>
<p>Two men were seated on the bed, back against the headboard, and were talking and watching the baby boy sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>They seemed to be total opposites, like the moon and the sun. One had blond hair and electric blue eyes, the other had black hair and emerald green eyes; one was broad and tall, the other shorter and lean; one had a big smile playing on his lips, the other wore a neutral expression, ruined just by the soft eyes that watched the sleeping baby.</p>
<p>Even though they were opposites, tho, the shorter man had his head leaning on the blond's shoulder, an arm intertwined with the muscled one of the other.</p>
<p>"It has been a very long day, my love. No wonder he's sleeping so soundly." said the black haired male to his companion. "Mother and Father came to celebrate after the party, after all, and we know very well how they can be when excited." a smirk appeared on his thin, rosy lips. He was right, however, because that day had been the boy's first birthday and, as the now youngest member of the royal family, he had to make his first appearance in public, not an easy thing for the small, peaceful child.</p>
<p>The blond chuckled in a deep voice and replied, "You are right, my Moon, but seeing how he is usually, I just thought that Hadrian would have resisted a bit more before falling asleep." a tender smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>Hadrian. This was the name of the little one. Hadrian Thorson. Fourth son of Thor Odinson and Loki Laufeyson. Brother to Jormungandr, Fenrir and Sleipnir. Future God of death and ruler of Hel itself. One of the most powerful children Asgard had ever seen, with nothing to evny his elder brothers for.</p>
<p>Just at the age of four months, the child, who his Sire had forgot to fed, hungry and upset, had been able to conjure a lightning bolt in front of himself, scaring the life out of Thor (who had been later scolded by Loki and Frigga for forgetting to feed the newborn) and acquiring his now famous lightning bolt scar.</p>
<p>Loki chuckled and turned his gaze towards his son once more. Getting up from the confortable embrace of his now husband, Loki reached out with a hand and, with a softness that only a Mother could show her son, caressed the head of his baby boy. The child's nose scrunched up in a cute way before relaxing again, accepting the touch of his Mother. Loki's stare softened again and he sent his sleeping son an adorning smile.</p>
<p>Just as Thor got up from the bed to go join his husband next to their son's crib, the double door on the right of the bed opened, revealing three boys of different ages.</p>
<p>The oldest of the three was around sixteen years old, with messy black hair and amber eyes. He was tall and lean, but with a touch of muscles that made him look powerful and strong. He had a blank look on his face, ruined, however, by the warm look he was giving to the three already in the room. He was holding another boy's hand and had a kid in his arms. The one that looked like the middle brother was smaller than the 16-year-old who he had by his side. He looked around ten, had long black hair, dark brown eyes and a handful of freckles that covered his nose and cheeks. His face was rounder than that of his brother and he had a small smile on his face. The younger boy was laying his head on the amber eyed boy's shoulder. He was small and looked around four years old. He had spiky brown hair and blue eyes that had a mischievous glint in them. He looked comfy in his brother's arms and had a big and happy smile that stretched his plump lips.</p>
<p>Thor and Loki, hearing the door open, turned their gaze from the baby lying in the crib to the opposite direction. They smiled adoringly once they saw the three boys that were looking in their direction.</p>
<p>"Fenrir, Sleipnir, Jormungandr. What brings you here, my sons? Is it not time for you to be asleep already?" Thor asked them, trying and failing to sound reprimandive. "I thought your Mother told you to go wash yourselves and then go to sleep." he scolded half heartedly.</p>
<p>Loki looked at his husband with a light glare in his eyes. Of course, he did tell the boys to go to sleep, but it was obvious they wanted to say goodnight to them before that. "What your Father wants to say," he glared harder at Thor when he tried to say something "is that after saying goodnight to us and your baby brother you'll have to go to sleep, sweethearts. It's late already, and tomorrow you'll have to go to your lessons again." he turned his gaze to the three at the door, that now were walking towards them.</p>
<p>The older boys said goodnight to their parents, giving them a brief hug and kissing they're brother's forehead before going to their room to sleep.</p>
<p>Loki turned to Thor, who was smiling adoringly at his youngest son, "We should really go to sleep too. Tomorrow will be a long day and I'm sure that Mother and Father will want to talk to us about today." he said softly. Thor looked up to him and, smiling, nodded his head briefly.</p>
<p>After getting changed in their night clothes and kissing their son's cheek, they went to bed.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, my Thunder" said Loki, smiling at Thor and cuddling against him, using his chest as a pillow. Thor wrapped his arm around him and positioned the other under his own head.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, my Moon" he replied kissing his husband's head. Soon enough, they drifted to sleep, relieved by the fact that their sons were safe. All four of them.</p>
<p>~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~°~</p>
<p>A loud cry ripped through the chilling night air, waking up the royal family and attracting the attention of most of the guards. It was coming from the luxurious bedroom where Thor, Loki and little Hadrian were sleeping.</p>
<p>Thor, having been asleep while his husband was checking on their son, woke up suddenly, recognizing the voice of his husband.</p>
<p>He found Loki on the floor near the crib where their baby boy slept. Hurrying to him, he looked in the crib.</p>
<p>His blood chilled in his veins, making him go still as he looked at the little crib in horror. He just stood there, Loki near him on the floor, crying.</p>
<p>The crib was <em>empty</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>The door opened behind the two, but neither of them had the strength to turn around. Footsteps approached and their three kids came into view. Fenrir stood with Jormungandr in his arms, while Sleipnir was at his side. They all looked scared and confused.</p>
<p>"What is happening here, Father? Why is Mother crying?" asked the oldest of the three. He was trying to comfort the crying child in his arms, but with little success. Sleipnir watched confused as his Mother cried, kneeling on the floor, and his Father just stood there, a blank look on his face and his fists tight.</p>
<p>Thor whispered something under his breath that no one heard, apart from Loki, whose breath hitched as he started sobbing.</p>
<p>"What?" asked again Fenrir, and when his Father spoke again, he heard him.</p>
<p>"Someone took him." said Thor in a tight voice, his fists tightening impossibly. "Someone took my son!" he repeated, this time almost snarling while he spoke. He laid a hand on his husband's shoulder and squeezed it a bit, showing his support.</p>
<p>Loki looked up from the crib for the first time, meeting blazing blue eyes which seemed to have lightning stuck into them. Thor looked furious. Angrier than he'd ever seen him. Loki, seeing this, laid his hand on his husband's, who held it tight. "They will pay." he said through gritted teeth, "The people who dared take our son from us, will pay dearly!" Loki all but growled.</p>
<p>The air around the room suddenly chilled as the kids understood what their parents meant and the three felt their blood freeze in their veins.</p>
<p>Theri expression changed completely.</p>
<p>Fenrir, who was old enough to understand completely what was happening, almost felt his expression harden. His lips set in a scowl, his fists tightening around his youngest brother's clothes and his eyes pratically glowing with power and anger.</p>
<p>Sleipnir was angry. Having studied the history of the Aesir, which included wars and kidnapping, from a really young age, he understood what their parents were saying, at least to some extent, and was pissed to know that something like that had happened to his baby brother. And his expression showed this perfectly. His eyes showed all his anger and, even if it was bearly visible, his fear for what could be happening to his little brother.</p>
<p>Joru, who was too young to understand what was happening, just clung to his oldest brother and hid his face in his shoulder, sobbing silently because he felt that the atmosphere wasn't as light as before.</p>
<p>The entire family, minus Joru, was furious. Someone had taken their youngest and they were going to pay dearly for this.</p>
<p>Their eyes glowed in the night as they looked at the empty crib, and everyone who saw them in that moment would have been able to understand what their expression promised to anyone who took their Hadrian.</p>
