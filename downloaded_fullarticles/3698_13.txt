    <p>The burning pain in his chest was beginning to consume him. It would surely eat him alive, of course. He tried not to think about the way he might be adding to that with the glass of Firewhiskey in his hand.</p><p> </p><p>He glared around the room, his steel eyes cutting from wall to wall as if he could will the entire thing to collapse on top of him. The pain of being back in this house, the place that stripped him of any joy or hope he had the second he crossed the threshold, was still strong.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you going to do this for the rest of your life?” A hoarse voice asked from the doorway. There stood a man who should have been able to cool the fire in his chest but was unable to as his own heart felt as if it had been immolated. He was tall with a somewhat toned and wiry frame. His hair, a muted chestnut color, forced his hazel eyes to glow half-heartedly. His clothes appeared as sad as he was: a faded maroon sweater with an off-white shirt underneath, dark pants that had clearly seen better days, and far too old socks. He was leaning against the doorway, staring at the other man intently.</p><p> </p><p>“Might as well.” The other man muttered quietly.</p><p> </p><p>The man in the doorway came to sit next to him on the ancient sofa. He took the glass from him and drained the rest of it. “Hand me that bottle, would you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Remus--”</p><p> </p><p>“The bottle, please, Sirius.” Remus’ voice was stern and commanding, however laced with grief it might be.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius did as he was told and handed Remus the half-empty bottle which he drained in only a few seconds. He tried not to be shocked. “That’ll hit you pretty quick, you know.” He murmured as he sat back. Remus nodded and copied his position.</p><p> </p><p>They were both quiet for a few minutes. The house was empty for the first time since it had been built. Well, empty save for the two of them. They had just come back from visiting Lily Potter in St. Mungo’s. She’d been in a coma since Voldemort’s attack on their home a week before. They’d buried James three days ago. Harry was currently in the care of his grandmother, Dorea Potter.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe he’s gone,” Remus said eventually. “James is really...it hardly feels real.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius nodded numbly. James had been a brother to him, closer than blood could ever make them. A part of him still believed it was all an elaborate joke, that James would come in the door any second laughing about how gullible he was. He tried to shake the image of James’ lifeless body from his mind. He and Remus had been the ones to discover the horrid scene at Godric’s Hollow.</p><p> </p><p>James’ body was halfway up the stairs as if he’d tried to run to Lily and Harry. He never made it, of course. Harry’s ear-splitting shrieks could be heard, louder and louder as they got closer to his room. There they found Lily on the floor in front of his crib, foaming at the mouth and seizing. Harry had a scar on his head, blood trickling down his face and mingling with the tears there.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius had vomited right there. Remus, ever the collected one, ran a quick diagnostic spell over Lily before instructing Sirius to get her to St. Mungo’s as soon as possible. Meanwhile, he scooped little Harry out of his crib and inspected him for anything other than the scar on his tiny head.</p><p> </p><p>All that felt as if it were a lifetime ago.</p><p> </p><p>Lily showed no signs of waking up any time soon. Dorea refused to bring Harry to see her, stating she thought it might be difficult for Harry if his mother was yet to be conscious. Remus and Sirius were actively fighting her on the issue, of course, but it was a battle yet to be won.</p><p> </p><p>At that moment, a translucent swan sailed into the room and both Remus and Sirius stood immediately. The beak opened and a serene, calm voice floated out. “She is awake. We will meet you there.” It was Dorea. Remus and Sirius shared a frantic look and set about getting ready to leave. Five minutes later, a loud crack was heard in the foyer of Grimmauld Place and the house was quiet once more.</p>
