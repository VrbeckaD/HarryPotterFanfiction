    <p>    Harry woke up the morning after the Final Battle feeling different. Laying on his dorm bed, hearing Ron’s snores and Hermione’s deep breaths was reassuring but something felt off. Maybe it was the fact that this was the first time in months that Harry had woken up in an actual bed, had spent a night in Hogwarts without fearing for his life, but regardless, at this point Harry knew not to disregard his gut feelings, no matter how annoying they were.</p><p>    Of course, everything was solved when he sat up and realized the blanket he had snuggled under all night wasn’t, in fact, a blanket. It was the Invisibility Cloak and rolling out of its folds was the Elder Wand and the Stone. Despite the fact that Harry had definitely dropped and crushed the stone in the Forest before the battle. Or, you know, despite having snapped the wand and throwing it off a cliff. Hermione and Ron were there, they could vouch for it. Yet here all three Hallows were, innocently laying across Harry’s body.</p><p>    Harry picked them up with a sigh. The moon was high in the sky, the sun nowhere to be seen yet. It was late and he’d just killed the maniac that had haunted his dreams, literally, last night. Sleep now, deal with his crazy life later. But laying back down, the strange feeling that had woken him up in the first place returned. It was like something was calling him, pulling him. At this point, he was too tired to care. But the urge, deep inside, it didn’t stop.</p><p>    So he groaned, rolled out of bed, and threw on his shoes. He’d crashed on the bed in borrowed sweater too big for his scrawny, malnourished body, but it’d do for an early morning wander. Not like that’d never happened before in his six years at the castle.</p><p>    Quietly making his way out of the room and trying not to wake Ron and Hermione, who had crashed together in the other bed, Harry followed the weird gut feeling that kept tugging and tugging him through the halls. It led him to the Healers Wing, urging him faster and faster.</p><p>    Something was wrong. Something was happening-</p><p>    “We’re losing her! Her heart is irregular again! Quick, Jones, get Pomphrey, I’m casting the electricity spell again!”</p><p>    “On it! Here, Leeks, support. Try to get her breathing regularly-“ Harry walked up to the doorway, looking in on two healers leaning over a woman laying on a cot, pale and tense. Another healer ran past him, the one in search of Madam Pomfrey, he assumed. The feeling seemed to crescendo.</p><p>    Oh. Harry walked up to the healers, one focusing on her heart and the another who seemed to be mixing together two elixirs in a panic. He slid in between them and put his hand on her forehead. She seemed to sigh in relief.</p><p>    “Her hearts not beating, Leeks, Leeks, support me.” The doctor with his wand hovering over the woman’s heart demanded.</p><p>    Harry pulled his hand away, suddenly even more tired. “She’s gone.” The healer looked up, confused.</p><p>    “Mr. Potter? What are you doing- Leeks, help, we need to tag team-“</p><p>    “Healer. she’s gone. You can’t help her anymore.” Harry said with certainty that came from nowhere. He just… knew.</p><p>    “Harry, please move away, we’re working on this patient.”</p><p>    Harry shook his head and touched the top of the woman’s head. “No, she’s gone. She left in peace, don’t worry, her parents will be there to meet her. Your efforts are wasted. But the boy three beds over…” Harry’s eyes went unfocused, as the feeling returned, directing him to the boy. His left lung’s failure will result in death in fourteen hours. Do something about that, please.”</p><p>    The healer holding the elixirs looked over, cast a detection spell, and promptly cursed. Just then, Pomphrey ran in, followed by the young healer that had been sent to find her. Harry took the hand that was still on the dead woman's head away and backed up. The healer leaning over her ended his spell and leaned back with a deep sigh.</p><p>    “The patient has passed. Pomphrey, can you please look over her. I’ll… go check on this lung with Leeks.” The healer gave Harry a strange look as he changed places with Madam Pomfrey, who came over and exhaled loudly at the sight of the woman’s nonexistent vitals. She started rapping her wand against the parchment hanging next to the bed before summoning a quill from across the room. When it reached her she looked up to catch it and simultaneously caught sight of Harry, standing at the head of the bed.</p><p>    “Harry, what are you doing here? Is something wrong? I can summon more pain relief potion for the-“</p><p>    Harry cut her off, “no, I’m… okay, actually. I think.” He stopped, looking back down at the woman’s body. Pomphrey’s face grew sad. “Harry, her death isn’t your fault, you know that.”</p><p>    That wasn’t the problem though. The problem was that Harry had felt as her life left her. He felt her soul pass and he knew. He knew why and how she had died. He knew, as soon as she passed her soul left this plane, who she was, what family she had waiting for her on the other side. The problem was that suddenly, Harry realized he was holding the Hallows in his left hand, the cloak draped over half his body. Which would explain why the healers kept being surprised when the saw him, he supposed.</p><p>    “No, Madam Pomfrey, it wasn’t. Jules Ratriek cast a heart disrupting curse at her, and I didn’t see, I wasn’t told, but I know. I know what caused her death and I don’t understand why.” He looked up at her, confused, tired, and honestly so done. “I felt her dying while I was asleep, Madam Pomfrey, and it woke me up and brought me down here.” He looked back down at her face, “her name is Linda Samuelson, she’s twenty-five, and she died of cardiac arrest at 3:43 am.”</p><p>    Madam Pomfrey stopped her spell casting to look at Harry, who was looking at his own hands, shaking slightly where he held them in front of him. “Harry, I think you need to go get some more sleep.”</p><p>    “Yeah. Yeah… I’ll… do that.”</p>
