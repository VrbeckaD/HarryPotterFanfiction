          <div class="userstuff"><p>“A customised version of the Draught of Living Death.” Malfoy gets straight to the point when Harry enters the Potions Research office. “It’s not unheard of for wizards with sleep disorder to switch to a weakened version of Living Death over time. The human body develops a resistance to Dreamless Sleep after long-term use. However...” Malfoy studies the medical records in front of him. “You need some talent to get this potion right. Talent the person you found unconscious in Diagon Alley clearly didn’t possess.” He glances up at Harry. “I’m not the Auror here, but I believe this is an accident, not a criminal case.”</p><p><i>I’m not the Auror here, but...</i> Harry has heard that phrase many times since Malfoy started to work for Potions Research. He has always been annoyingly correct with his predictions. Otherwise, Malfoy seems to speak little that isn’t related to his work.</p><p>That’s why Harry doesn’t expect Hermione to invite Malfoy to a get-together of Ministry workers from their year at Hogwarts. He learns Malfoy moved out of the Manor because he needed a break from Pureblood values and family responsibilities. Hermione also tells him how hard Malfoy worked to make amends with her and everyone else who suffered his bullying back in the day.</p><p>It’s even stranger to watch Malfoy chat with Ron about Quidditch statistics, listen to Neville’s stories about the pranks of his charges at Hogwarts and admire Hermione’s work at the Ministry. Harry starts to wonder why it’s only him with whom Malfoy talks about nothing but potions.</p><p>When Malfoy leaves for the cloakroom, Harry follows and corners him in the corridor.</p><p>“I’ve got a complicated investigatory question,” he tells Malfoy. “What reasons could someone have to make amends with everyone save for one person?”</p><p>“I’m not the Auror here, Potter.” Malfoy sounds defiant.</p><p>“Has that ever stopped you?” Harry retorts. “So tell me, does that mean they only hate this one person?”</p><p>“I’d rather assume the opinion of this one person is so important to them that they don’t know how to approach the situation,” Malfoy says cautiously. “Rejection from other people would be tolerable. Rejection from this one person would not. It is therefore better to keep all interactions on a strictly professional level.”</p><p>“But what about the other person?” Harry asks. “Wouldn’t they feel rejected instead?”</p><p>“Would they?” Malfoy’s jaw is working. “Do you?” He stops pretending not to know what they’re talking about.</p><p>“Would I be here if I didn’t care?”</p><p>Malfoy doesn’t reply. The answer is all too obvious.</p><p>“Maybe we can talk about this over lunch sometime?” he suggests eventually.</p><p>“Tomorrow?” Harry asks enthusiastically.</p><p>Malfoy looks as if he wants to back out for a moment. Then he squares his shoulders and straightens his spine.</p><p>“Yes. Tomorrow.”</p></div>
