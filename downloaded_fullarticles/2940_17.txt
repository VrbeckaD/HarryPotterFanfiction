The Calling<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Credence earliest memory of living in Athens was waking up to the sun of Helios warming his skin, the floral smell of anemones against the breeze as they tickled his cheeks, and the sight of the myrrh tree above him. He didn’t have a memory of a mother or father, just the name Crēdentēs embedded in his head, like the Gods had whispered to him an unknowing purpose to his name; it meant belief, and Credence wanted to believe in a higher purpose to his existence and what the Gods had instore for him.<br/>
<br/>
The Gods made him an orphan in Athens, and being an orphan led Credence to being disposable to the entrapment of slavery, but it was a common placement for those lost and with no bloodline ties to royalty, property, or political significance. His value was based in his ability to understand numbers, wit, and adaptability at a very young age in the streets of Athens. Μαριάμ—Mariam, or as she preferred to be called Ma, had taken Credence in at an early age from the ruthless streets; she caught him cheating in a Tavli game, she observed his ability to count and play ahead of his opponents on the steps leading to the Parthenon. He would gamble his way into avoiding the brothels that beckoned him to become a slave to forced pleasure.</p><p>Credence feared that he would end up there in the brothels, the thought of men’s lusting eyes that matched only to that of Hades taking Persephone, tricking him into spending half of the year trapped in an underworld of being physically exploited was death in his eyes. He accepted being a slave for Ma, his gift of logic and beauty held him at a usable body in the temple she tended over. Ma would remind him daily that he was cursed with a foul presence of unnatural splendour, and that fate had brought him in as a spectacle for the temple, bringing in curious eyes as many found his feminine beauty enthralling to observe. If he were to ever leave, the Gods would punish him for his traitorous acts as he belonged wholly to the temple and Gods themselves, as Ma put it in her circadian orations to him.  </p><p>Credence daily routines were of no fun or hopefulness, he was punished by Ma with whips to his hands if he dare get near anyone that visited the temple or so much as make eye contact. He was reduced to an eye display in the shadows, he thought of himself as the statues in the gardens he would sneak out at night to see, as Modestia, another slave to the temple adopted by Ma, would join him in their rebellious acts under the safeguard of Artemis light in the night. Modestia was the closest to a friend that Credence had in the temple, unlike Castitas that was loyal to Ma’s word and would relish in watching Ma’s wrath of punishment towards Modestia and himself. They understood each other well, Modestia was an orphan like him but she did not share the same harsh punishments from Ma like Credence did.  <br/>
<br/>
Credence was always treated differently among the rest of the orphaned slaves, and he knew he would find a way out of the temple and Ma’s vengeful ire, it was as if Enyo herself had poured the need for bloodshed and pain into the woman. For years she struck hurt and fear into him with whips and venomous words, and the older he got the sterner Ma became. He noticed the girls in the temple giving him envious stares as he grew into a young man but his features tricked many into seeing him as girlish. He did not understand why the girls envied him, with ugly markings that lined his hands and malnourished features that made his bones stick out sordidly through his chiton, his thick black hair curled and frizzed at shoulder length from lack of care. He rarely got sunlight in the day because of his duties bound him to the temple, making his skin pale and milky. He rarely slept in the night, too fearful that Phobetor would terrorize him in the form of monsters in his dreams, like the teachings he would overhear in other temples he was forced to collect scrolls from in the day.<br/>
</p><p>Credence was used to the smells of various incense burning in the temples, the scent always lingering on him like a promise that he would always return to worship the Gods. He was bound by word and body, and as Ma put it, the temple honoring Artemis only wanted chaste, untouched slaves to serve it. On the seventh day of the Thargelion month it was the one festival Credence loved, Thargelia; where fruits and offerings were given to Apollo and Artemis honoring them; the smell of laurel incense burned in generous amounts for everyone to have good harvest came upon Athens in an array of celebrations and good tidings.</p><p><br/>
While everyone was enjoying the festivities, Ma and the other girls tending to duties and celebration, Credence was drawn to the forest outside of Athens. He escaped Ma’s usual close supervision in the crowd during the high point of the day, where it became a sea of bodies drunk off wine and steering animals as they prepared sacrifices for the Gods. As he got further out of the city, where he was sure Apollo had made the sun blinding and the air humid just to spite him for not joining in the ceremonies and neglecting his duties; sneaking off was by most accounts an absolute dishonor. But he felt a need to follow a voice that had been calling him in the night since he could remember, a woman’s voice that summoned him in the quietest moments when he’d give his mind over to the Gods in the temple. He watches sheep being herded on the path as he made his way up to the mountain side, it was like a trance as his feet led him where his heart never had the courage to go before. Following the voice was a risk, it was fortuitous of him as he always kept himself fearful of Ma’s punishments.<br/>
<br/>
It was calling upon him, something or someone was guiding him; Credence thought it was the Moirai perhaps snaring him and finally deciding his destiny or planning his death. The further up the beaten path he went the louder the voice became, and the smell of incense guided him to a cave on the mountainside. The cave looked untouched by nature, the cold slabs of rock shaping three-sided walls into a narrow hall. Credence swallowed, his throat tightening as the fear of the unknown was trying to halt him from entering the cave; he forced himself to be more curious than brave as he took a step into the cave. The scent of frankincense became stronger the further he walked, he was shaking as his hand touched the smooth side of the wall.</p><p>“<em>Puer</em>, don’t be shy,” the woman’s voice resounded gently like a whisper in the hall. “I’ve been waiting for you.”</p><p>Credence shivered, he wanted to run the opposite way and go back to the festival. He felt foolish for having gone so blindly into the unknown but his heart told him it was meant to be, that the Gods had planned this all along.</p><p>Beyond the smoke of burning incense and various objects littered on the hollowed area that ended the long path, the room was alight with candles scattered around. There sat an elderly woman covering her head with her himation, her hands hovering over small bones and various leafs, he could feel her smile in spite the darkness that veiled him from properly seeing her; he trembled as his knees buckled before Credence could make any sense of the ominous situation. He knew what she was, without a word spoken; he eavesdropped on so many temple slaves and attendees whispering about her; in fear, admiration, suspicion, about how anyone who could befall onto her in the flesh were granted the words of wisdom or demise from the Gods… an Oracle.</p><p>He sat across from her, Credence hands shook like they did when Ma lashed them at the temple when he made mistakes, like dropping a candle or not being on time for offerings. His eyes stung from the holy incense and poor lighting, tears forming on the corners but Credence dare not move to wipe them away. It was not until the Oracle outstretched her hands in the circle they sat in that was painted with language of old, involuntarily Credence followed her and his hands were soon clasped into her icy cold ones.<br/>
<br/>
Credence couldn’t supress the gasp that escaped from his lips, he could sense the tacit magic that flowed through her. It was true as the whispers between people said in Athens, a feeling that was like touching the Gods, powerful and intoxicating.   </p><p>“<em>Puer</em>, do not fear me,” her eyes were a blue that reminded Credence of the ocean at the point when the sun went down and it was swallowed by the sea; rich with color, her eyes looked as if they too could pull the sun down into the depthless orbs. “You’ve been asking the Gods for answers on your fate… they’ve called upon me to voice them.”</p><p>“I…” his throat clenched as if pneuma was being pulled out of him. All he could manage was a trembling whisper as his head bowed, “Thank you…”   </p><p>“You feel it, don’t you? The Gods presence… like me, you feel the divine voices work through you…” She smiles knowingly, her eyes crinkling on the side. Her words made Credence heart race as he nodded nervously, her ability of sight was as inebriating as her presence. “They’ve told me of your fate… your truth will be not here in Athens under the Gods eyes, you will come upon your fate in blood and gold…”<br/>
<br/>
Credence’s eyes felt heavy as the Oracles words seeped into his thoughts like thick honey, “I… Don’t understand.” He managed with each blink to defeat the blanket of sleepiness that overtook him.</p><p>“You will be tested soon, <em>puer</em>… Your true nature will be soon…”  </p><p>He recalled the image of the sun and gold coins he did not recognize falling to him, as his arms outstretched to try and catch them; then it began to rain blood and the sound of people screaming booming loud. He awoke alone in the cave, his heart racing as he realized it was empty; the only light permitting from the entrance was of Artemis. Credence lethargically picked himself up, silently cursing to the Gods that he had unwillingly fallen asleep and now he was going to have to face the wrath of Ma’s lashings.  </p><p>Walking back to Athens, Credence wondered of the vision he had, but also the Oracles burdening words as it all felt like a warning rather than his fate being brought to light. As he enters the cities pavilion, people still going well into the night in the festivities, drunk off wine and good tidings, Credence weaves through bodies as he wanted to sneak back into the temple without Ma’s knowledge. He would do his best to avoid Ma’s ire and venomous punishments.</p><p>Credence thanked the Gods that Ma was fast asleep as he entered the temple with silence greeting him. He would always take silence over Ma’s vengeful ways, as he did his best to get back into his chamber where a straw bed with old woven fabric awaited him to sleep on. It took him by surprise to see Modestia seated by his door waiting for him, when their eyes met she stood up.</p><p>“Come, let’s walk in the gardens…” She bids in a murmur.   </p><p>They walk in silence, under the watchful eye of Artemis as they come upon their favorite spot where the statue of Aphrodite stood, Credence always loved Aphrodite’s grace and beauty; sometimes he wish he had the same power of beauty and be like her son, Eros, able to be desirable and have sensual influence. A shameful longing he kept close to his heart as he gazed up at the statue of the Goddess.</p><p>He bowed his head from meeting Aphrodite’s eyes as he could feel himself blush. What he didn’t anticipate was Modestia’s face sharing the same pink coloring adorning her cheeks as well. It didn’t take long as she finally permitted the words she had probably held back all day, “I met a man at the festivities today…”</p><p>It came as a surprise to Credence that Modestia got out of Ma’s scrutiny to meet a man, she continues in a gentle tone, “He’s from Sparta…”</p><p>“Modestia…” Credence couldn’t withhold the fear that wrapped around his vocals, it was forbidden to speak to men, let alone, a Spartan.</p><p>“I know,” she hangs her head for a moment, then lifts her gaze to the moon, “he promises to run away with me, Credence… he wants to marry me in Sparta, he’s of an influential family…”</p><p>“When do you plan to run from here?” He asks somberly, seeing Modestia for a first, happy.</p><p>“Sundown tomorrow…, I have a chance to have a future, I can have a family I’ve never had, Credence…”</p><p>“Do you love him?”</p><p>She nods, “Yes.”   </p><p>He felt himself smile as he embraced Modestia, “I’m happy for you, he’s lucky to have you.”</p><p>Modestia playfully shoves Credence away, “Don’t speak that way, I’ll cry.”</p><p>They both laugh as they stare at Aphrodite together, Credence allowing himself to hold Modestia’s hand knowing it may be the last time he would be able to do so. He looked at her as the closest to a friend he had in the temple.</p><p>When Credence awoke in his chamber to Modestia’s screaming echoing in the temple, he leaped to his feet and ran towards her scream. He didn’t expect to see men grabbing Modestia, Credence didn’t know what possessed him, perhaps to was Artemis’ strength that gave him the will to get between the men that were attempting to drag Modestia out. The men gruffly shoved Credence to the ground as Modestia begged why Ma brought men in the temple to take her.  </p><p>It was Castitas that had betrayed Modestia as Ma announced, “Castitas has told me what you’ve done to defile our sacred oath… speaking and planning to elope with a man…”</p><p>Credence’s eyes widen in shock as Modestia sobs, her fear cutting deep into his heart as Ma continued, “If you wish to be <em>Pornai</em> then you will be sold as one.”</p><p>“She didn’t do anything wrong,” Credence rasped in a desperate plea, “Castitas was mistaken, it was me… I saw a man in secret… I desired to elope, I broke our sacred oath, Ma!”</p><p>Ma’s eyes penetrated terror into Credence as she blinked away the contempt in her features, “Take him, leave her.”</p><p>In a quick motion, the men scooped Credence from the temple floor into their grips, Modestia didn’t hold back the tears as she cried for Credence to not be taken. He forced himself to try his best not to cry in front of everybody but the tremors that overtook him couldn’t hide how frightened he was, as he whisper to Modestia, “It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be safe, the Gods will protect you.”</p><p>The men laughed as they threw a sack of drachma to Ma’s eager grips, Credence kept his eyes on Modestia as he wanted to not forget her face. He knew she would escape Ma’s ire and be in the arms of a man she loved, and that gave him comfort to know she would not be forced into the world that Credence would never wish upon Modestia—being a <em>Pornai</em> for anyone to defile. The men throw him into a cage and toss him a cloak as they chortled at how scrawny he is for a man, bounding him in shackles and chains that bruised his pale flesh.</p><p>“He looks nothing like a man, no wonder he was a slave to this temple, but his beauty will make us rich back in Rome!” the one man declares in a hardy laugh.</p><p><br/>
As the chariot moved away from the temple and Athens became distant, Credence silently prayed for Modestia’s safety. Credence would do his best to survive, because he was a survivor all his life. He fought against all odds to be alive, and nothing would change that for him. Even if he was going to be sold off in Rome, he would keep his head down, and beg to Athena that she would give him strength to endure the hardships that lay ahead for him.<br/>
