    <p>The House That Built Me</p><p>By Ammie Hawk</p><p> </p><p>Disclaimer: I own neither Harry Potter nor Gundam Wing… they belong to their original creators</p><p> </p><p>Summary: While in OZ custody, two of the Gundam pilot’s DNA ended up in enemy hands. With the advanced science of the age, a child was created using the stolen genes to create the perfect weapon. What happens six years later when the ‘fathers’ find out they have a son? Original plunny by Vixen Uchiha</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1: Finding Out</p><p> </p><p>Petunia Dursley hummed quietly to herself as she got up the morning of November second, A.C. 197 and prepared to put the milk bottles out for the milkman. She quietly made her way to the front door, not wanting to wake up her husband and infant son. As she opened the front door to set the bottles down, her eyes landed on something that should not be present on her front step at all. Beady blue eyes squinted in the early morning light at the bundle. A scream rent the air as she registered what exactly it was and she fell to the floor in a dead faint.</p><p>A moment later, Vernon Dursley thundered down the stairs, throwing on a dressing gown in his haste to see what was wrong with his wife. He stopped dead when he saw her sprawled all over the entryway floor. Quickly recovering, he went to her side, knelt down, and lifted her head onto his lap.</p><p>“Petunia,” he patted her cheek gently, trying to elicit a response.</p><p>Petunia’s eyes fluttered for a moment before finally opening. It took her a moment to remember what had happened and why she was currently lying on the floor. As memory came flooding back, she surged to her feet and back to the now closed door. Wrenching it open, she fell to her knees and lifted the now wailing bundle into her arms.</p><p>“Hush, little one,” she cooed, rocking the infant slightly as she pulled a letter from its flailing hands.</p><p>She took the bundle of blankets and child into the kitchen and set it in Dudley’s old child’s seat, located near the back door. She then sat down at the table to read through the missive. Her hands began to tremble violently the further down the page she got.</p><p>“V-Vernon,” she stuttered, her eyes wide and frightened.</p><p>“What is it, Pet?” he asked, a frown marring his face as he took the letter from her. “What are we going to do?” he looked up at her as soon as he finished reading.</p><p>“We’ll keep him,” she shook her head, tears flowing unchecked down her face. “We have no other choice. He may not be Lily’s biological son, but I can’t just turn him out. He’s just a baby.”</p><p align="center">888888</p><p>Five Years Later…</p><p> </p><p>Sally Po sat at her desk in the medical ward of the main branch of the Preventers Headquarters, located in Brussels, Belgium. It was time for her annual check through the classified registration documents. Something she, personally, saw little point in, but Lady Une, her superior, insisted that she update the records at least once a year. So for the next month or so, she’d be sifting through files of Preventer personnel, high ranking political figures, and special cases to make sure that nothing was wrong with the current files.</p><p>As was her routine since the Registration Act was put into place some six years ago, she started with the special cases, as this category was the smallest in comparison to the others. She always started with her favorite five, as very little usually changed about their files, but it was always fun to see what they were doing, especially since they rarely kept in contact with her.</p><p>She had made it through three of the files with very little to do except snoop through the lives of the boys. It was as she opened the fourth, however, that something new popped up on the screen. Across the middle of the page a large red banner proclaimed FRA MATCH FOUND. Scowling, she clicked on the banner and was relocated to another page entirely.</p><p>She quickly scanned through the new document, sure there had to be some mistake. But as she had told countless people during the course of this act, DNA does not lie. Her frown deepened when she came across another line in the document, also labeled CLASSIFIED. She clicked on it, typed in the correct security bypass code, and was once again relocated.</p><p>She pushed violently away from her desk, as if distance would erase the truth that was glaring her in the face. Eyes wide, she fumbled to release the cell phone from her belt, needing to report this immediately. Finally pulling the device free, she hit speed dial one and pressed it to her ear.</p><p>~Lady Une speaking,~ the calm, reassuring voice of her superior dragged her partially out of her state of shock.</p><p>“You’re not going to believe this, Anne,” she said, all professionalism thrown out the window.</p><p align="center">888888</p><p>In an office on an upper floor of the same Preventers branch, a phone clattered to the floor as its owner’s hand went slack around it. Lady Anne Une stared blankly at the bare wall in front of her, completely lost for words. What Sally had told her wasn’t possible. Not the fact that two males had a biological child together, no, she knew better than that. But the fact that the child was the son of those two particular males…</p><p>No, the project had been terminated. She had personally looked into it at the conclusion of the Eve Wars. Tsubarov himself had called for the disposal of the embryo in favor of the mobile dolls. God, she always knew this particular project, her greatest sin during the war, would come back to bite her in the ass one day, she just didn’t think it would be in this manner.</p><p>Now all she had to do was call two of the most volatile men on the entire Sphere and confess to them what she had done when they were only teenagers. Great, her life was over. It would only take one bullet, and that would be it. She just wasn’t sure which one of them would pull the trigger.</p>
