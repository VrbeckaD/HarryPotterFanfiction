    <h1>Harry Potter and the Tanaka Clan</h1><h2>By ShinoDagon</h2><h3>Rescued</h3><h4>Time: Dusk</h4><h4>Location: Park</h4><p>A four year old boy was sitting in the park, crying all alone under a tree. Just a few hours ago he managed to get away from his aunt and uncle's house, and he had no plans of going back any time soon. He was so absorbed in how to keep away from his aunt and uncle's house that he didn't realize that someone was studying him, trying to gauge whether or not to act. The boy wasn't aware of this, but he was emitting a strange signal, one that had to be investigated.</p>
<h5>Toranaga's POV</h5><p>I look at this tiny child, wondering why he is left alone. Taking a glance at the sun reveals that there are but a few minutes left until night falls. I need to act now.</p><p>"Little one, why are you out here alone?" I ask quietly, keeping my chi non-hostile and supportive.</p><p>"My family doesn't want me, so I ran," Came the near broken voice. That is strange, I know that there are times when a family without a clan doesn't want a child, but to actually drive one to run away seems to be, incomprehensible to me. Something else happened though, that strange pule of chi stopped. Could that mean he is just needing someone to take care of him?</p><p>"Would you like to come with me? I am sure that we can get things better," I say to him, not wanting to cause him more distress. What he was emitting earlier, was very much like chi, and yet so different.</p><p>"Even if I am a freak?" He asks. His green eyes filled with tears, pain, and, just barely, a small amount of hope.</p><p>I give him a small, reassuring smile, "Even if you are a freak, for I am a freak to some as well, but that is because I can do incredible things, wouldÂ you like to see more?" I ask, perhaps by showing him some of my chi abilities, he would trust me to help him.</p><p>"Yes please," He barely whispers.</p><p>I gather my chi, and carefully charge my eyes with it. Keeping my eyes close, I look away and then open them. The light protruding from them makes the tree I am looking at light up as if the sun were shining from my eyes to that spot. That lasts until the chi that I have gathered is used up. </p><p>"Does this make me a freak? Or does this make me more? I have no idea, but I promise you this, I will help you."</p><p>"What's going to happen now?"</p><p>"{You will become my son.}" Upon seeing his confused look, I realized my mistake, I spoke Japanese, "You will become my son." As soon as the words click in his mind, I have an armful of child.</p><p>"Thank you, I promise to be good, I promise I won't be much trouble."</p><p>I expect some trouble, no child can be perfect all the time, but if you do your vest, I won't be angry at you." I notice that the child was very sleepy, I let his eyes close and let him drift off to sleep.</p><p>Searching through my pockets, I found a few papers, and after searching them for what they do, I put all but one back. I hope that the {Barrier of Protection Against those with Malicious Intent} works, otherwise, I will need to use a few different barriers that last for hours. I will do what I can tonight, and finish things in the morning. Opening the zippo lighter that I keep specifically in my pocket for such an occasion, I light the paper on fire, and let it burn, covering the two of us in a second layer, I can feel that it is attempting to keep us safe, so it is apparently doing it's job. Good.</p><p> Focusing my chi, I draw chi in from the surrounding area. With that going on, I focus on using the chi I just gathered to increase my speed to aid in getting to hopefully his new home. Approaching the Tanaka Compound, I slip inside as silently as possible, thanking Kami that the doors were just oiled recently. I can see that children and teens were about, getting in last minute time with whatever they are doing before going home.</p><p>"{Mr. Toranaga, who is in your arms?}" A person practicing his aikido forms asks.</p><p>{I do not know his name, but he will be treated like my son.}" I respond, letting everyone in the area know that this child is important to me.</p><p>{I understand teacher, shall I inform the others?} someone else asks.</p><p>{No, I shall inform them myself during breakfast tomorrow, I will have everything I need to make it official by then.}</p><p>I take the child to my room, I want to make him my son, and in doing so, I will make sure that he is well protected, healthy, and sane... or at least as sane as it can get in the Tanaka Compound. I am forced to wait until my uncle comes, and gives him a check up. I so wish to just heal him with chi, I know he has many bruises, I felt them through the clothes, but, I can't they need to be documented so that I have a better chance of adopting him.</p><p>'Maybe the examination will provide useful results that I can actually work with... UNCLE LI HURRY HERE NOW!'</p>
