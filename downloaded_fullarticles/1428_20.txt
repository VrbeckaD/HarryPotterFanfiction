    <p>
  <span>Draco was walking to the room of requirement to work on the vanishing cabinet. He had been given the task to repair it, and he could not fail. His mother’s life depended on it. He reached the door when he felt hands on him. He looked back and saw two men grab him. He swung his arm out to strike one of them, and then he tried to pull away. He felt his sleeve rip when the first man grabbed him.  He felt something pulling him and he fell back onto the floor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked up and saw that he was in a different room. He got up and drew his wand out. The two men drew their wands and pointed it at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re outnumbered Malfoy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know who you are and I don’t care, but I am leaving” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We can’t let you do that” the other man said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look he really has the dark mark!” the first man said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked at the two men, they couldn’t have older than 20 and they were amazed by his dark mark. There was something wrong. He needed to leave. Using wandless magic he stupified them both and turned to leave. He realized the room he was in had no door. Draco cast a bombardo only to be sent flying back.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He woke up to a female standing over him. She had long curly hair and was saying something to him. She reached down and helped him sit up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where am I?” Draco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The future” the girl said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“These two idiots decided to grab you from the past, but they went too far back” the girl said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked over and saw the two men that attacked him restrained magically with ropes. He saw a giant hole in the wall, where aurors were walking in and out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re meant to work on the cabinet and get it to work. These idiots didn’t read their history” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m...Rose” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is a very strange dream Rose”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, this is a dream, a really strange dream you’re having. We’re just going to get you to wake up and you’ll be back in the room of requirement”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I like that idea, let’s do that”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rose helped Draco stand. He looked at her curly hair and it looked familiar. There were freckles on her cheeks, but her eyes, they were grey. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You look oddly familiar” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ok, you should wake up from this dream soon” Rose said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked down at her wand, rather it was his wand in her hand. Hawthorne, ten inches. He reached over and took it out of her hands. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d like to have this back” Draco said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Auror Granger!” another auror yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Granger? You’re...your mother is…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, my mother is Hermione Granger. And you have your wand, it’s in your pocket, now give me back mine”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rose took the wand from him and then patted his suit jacket pocket. Draco reached into his pocket and saw that he had his wand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why do you have my wand?!” Draco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s my wand, and you’re having a bad dream”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you have my wand, you’re lying to me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re having a bad dream” Rose said pointing her wand at his head</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco fell to the ground asleep. Rose looked down at him and placed a time turner around his neck. She placed a kiss on his cheek. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry dad, you have to go back and forget this all happened. I wish we had more time” Rose said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rose spun the turner and watched Draco disappear. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How could you just let him go like that?” the other auror asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s not from this time, you know the rules, he can’t stay” Rose replied</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, believe me I know”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You could have told him-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t, if I do, I risk changing everything. Harry Potter has to defeat Voldemort. No matter what, I cannot change the outcome of that, no matter how much I want my father to be alive”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s why you’re head auror”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My father died protecting my mother. If I tell him what happens, who knows what may happen”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He may be alive with your mom, growing old”</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco awoke on the floor in front of the room of requirement. He got up and looked around. He ignored the dust and debris of the broken time turner on the floor. He felt strange. He walked into the room and started to work on the vanishing cabinet. He reached into his pocket and took out his wand. He twirled it between his fingers and looked at it. He found a small note in his pocket as well. He was about to read it when he heard something. He turned his head. He heard someone walking into the room and pointed his wand. Hermione walked closer and saw Draco.</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco lowered his wand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Has your hair always been this big?” Draco asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh sod off Malfoy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked down at the note.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>There’s no fate but what we make for ourselves</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was written on the paper. Draco didn’t know what it meant. He wondered if it was a quote from a book somewhere. Why would he have written it down? But it wasn’t his handwriting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why do you have a quote from the Terminator?” Hermione asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a line from a movie, a muggle movie”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s a Terminator?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The letters on the paper glowed brightly and lifted off the page. Draco and Hermione watched as it drew itself into a ball and then transformed itself into a small vial. Draco reached out and grabbed it. He looked at the small vial. It was a memory. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Pensive! I need a pensive!” Draco yelled</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two of them looked around and found one. Draco poured the memory into the pensive and stuck his head in. Hermione of course stuck her head in as well. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was foggy where they were. They saw a mirror and the word fate written on the fog. A hand wiped it away and Rose was standing there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If you’re seeing this, it means you figured it out, surprisingly. I’m Rose. We met before. It wasn’t a dream. Those two idiots grabbed you when you were too young, you still have to finish the cabinet. I wish there could be an easier way for me to say this, but there isn’t. You’re my dad” Rose said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco choked and looked at the girl standing in the mirror. Hermione looked at her as well. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know who my mother is. I’m sorry to say that I am your only child. Voldemort kills grandmother, grandfather spends the rest of his life in Azkaban. You protect my mother in my final battle. Harry Potter wins, he’s going to win, and you have to help him win. I know you don’t like him. And I know this is a lot. I wish we had more time dad. You shielded my mother, because you love her, and because you knew she was carrying me. But you died dad. The venom took merely seconds. Mom misses you a lot. I miss you. I’m so proud of you dad, of what you’re going to do. I just wish I could have met you. If you change time, consequences be damned. Harry has to win. There’s no fate but what we make for ourselves. Rules were meant to be broken. I love you dad”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A few memories started to play out, Rose sitting in the gardens at the Manor while the albino peacocks walked past her. A house elf appeared and brought her some cookies.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me about my daddy” Rose said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The house elf smiled and started to talk. The memory started to change. Rose was packing for Hogwarts when Harry walked into the room. He handed her Draco’s wand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This was your father’s wand” Harry said</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It is?” Rose asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes it is, it’s very special, not only is it your father’s wand, but it is the same wand that helped me take down Voldemort”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wow”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At the train station Rose was saying goodbye to Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What if I’m sorted into the wrong house?” Rose asked</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The hat knows. You won’t be placed in the wrong house”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your father was sorted into Slytherin, and your mother Gryffindor. Both are wonderful houses”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why don’t I have his name then?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s a question for your mother”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where is she?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Getting your owl” a voice said from behind</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rose turned around and saw Hermione standing there holding an owl in a cage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco choked again and Hermione was in shock watching the memory. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No no no no no!” Hermione said as she pulled her head out of the pensive</span>
</p>
