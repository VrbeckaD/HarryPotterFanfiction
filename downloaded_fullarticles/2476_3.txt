    <p>Harry had been dating a guy. To be precise, he'd been dating Kris Attwood. None of the Weasleys trusted him, but Harry really liked him, maybe even loved him. They were even coming up on eight months of dating soon! But then it had been ruined by some girl, Harry didn't even know her name.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Ginny?" Harry asked, knocking on the Burrow's door.</p><p> </p><p>Molly opened it, and led him in. "Oh, what's wrong Harry?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled at her concern. She was a wonderful woman, but he didn't much feel like discussing his boyfriend troubles with her. "Oh, I'm good, Molly. Is Ginny in?"</p><p> </p><p>Molly waved her wand at the food and started preparing him soup. "Ah, she's just up in her room, dear. Have some soup? You're looking awfully thin. Have you been eating?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Molly. I've been having snacks, and all three meals."</p><p> </p><p>"Sleeping well?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I'm just going up to see Ginny, I'll talk to you later." Harry said, running up the stairs before she could refuse.</p><p> </p><p>A few steps, and he was knocking on Ginny's closed door. "Gin?"</p><p> </p><p>He heard the radio turn off and her voice. "Yeah?"</p><p> </p><p>"Can I come in? It's Harry."</p><p> </p><p>The door was opened and Ginny laughed. "I know it's you, nobody else knocks."</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt himself flushing. "Well, uh--"</p><p> </p><p>"Come sit, I know you didn't come here just to stammer."</p><p> </p><p>The radio was turned back on, at a lower volume, and he sat on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>"Well?" She asked.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed. "It's Kris."</p><p> </p><p>"What'd the slimy git do now?"</p><p> </p><p>"Ginny!" Harry exclaimed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She sighed heavily. "Sorry." She didn't look sorry at all. "What's with your prince?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry muttered, "He's not my prince, anymore."</p><p> </p><p>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at her. "He's not, we're not, I think we're broken up?"</p><p> </p><p>"Is that a question? Did you break up or not?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugged. "I kind of left in a hurry."</p><p> </p><p>Ginny sighed again. "Get to the point."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, picking at his nails. "Well, I came home and he was on the couch, with some girl--"</p><p> </p><p>"What do I need to do?" She asked, sliding off the bed, onto the floor next to him.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" He asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Where should I punch him? Nose? Stomach?"</p><p> </p><p>"No! Don't hurt him."</p><p> </p><p>"Then why'd you come to me, Harry? I'm gonna need a bit of communication from you."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know." he said, sounding strangled. "But you're my best friend, aside from Ron or Hermione, and I know they're going to say 'I told you so' and I really don't want to hear it right now."</p><p> </p><p>Ginny hummed. "Alright. So what you're saying is I can't hurt him?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave her a Look.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine, fine. Would some ice cream help?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. "Very much."</p><p> </p><p>"You know Mum's going to want to know why."</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. "I don't want anyone knowing yet."</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned. "Because they'll only say 'I told you so'."</p><p> </p><p>"I promise I won't let them. Besides, us Weasleys -- aside from Ron or Percy -- are pretty good when it comes to this stuff."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, and they ran down the stairs for ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>As they sat at the table eating, Ginny burst out, "Are you SURE I can't punch him in the face?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed, swallowing his ice cream. "Yes."</p><p> </p><p>"What if I just broke his nose a little?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed, laughing, as Molly turned her attention to them. "Whose nose are you breaking, Ginny?"</p><p> </p><p>"Attwood's." Ginny supplied, ignoring Harry's groan.</p><p> </p><p>"Why on earth would you do that?" Molly asked, completely oblivious to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Because he was very mean to Harry, and I want to hurt him. Harry won't let me."</p><p> </p><p>"What did he do?" Molly asked, looking at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was about to say, 'Nothing.' but Ginny beat him to it.</p><p> </p><p>"The prat cheated on him with a girl." She said brightly, as though Harry wasn't glaring at her.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, that won't do." Molly said simply, picking up her wand.</p><p> </p><p>"Molly, please." Harry begged.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, Harry. You're a Weasley and we protect our own. Ginny, round up your brothers."</p><p> </p><p>Harry's head slammed into his bowl as he groaned.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny patted his head. "Oh, you poor boy. You've much to learn."</p>
