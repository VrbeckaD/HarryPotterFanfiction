    <p>
  <span>It had been a few hours before Harry noticed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day had started like any other weekday. His alarm spell went off at exactly 5:00, then 5:10, then 5:15, and continued until it hit 6:00 and Harry finally tumbled out of bed, wayward strands of sleep-mussed hair sticking out in every direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Six months had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, and Harry was still trying to figure out what he wanted to do with his life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While the Wizarding World celebrated the victory the Light had brought, it was still wrought with grief and pain. People mourned their loved ones and those of other families, murmured condolences shared at almost every gathering. The Weasleys tried to get Harry to go out more often, to interact with more than just the confines of Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he liked waking up early-</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Quiet, morning light filtering through the thing shafts in the vent, the entire household slumbering except for a little boy hidden under the stairs.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>-and setting a routine for the day. He would wake on his own terms, get some breakfast with Kreacher and try not to let the bat-like ears remind him of someone else. He'd spend the rest of the day exploring the attic and basement of Grimmauld Place. So many relics, so much history collecting dust, hidden from sight. It was a good way for Harry to relax. To enjoy the quiet, imagining that every rustle and scratch from his movements brought him closer to family. To his parents, to his godfather, to his professor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he picked up a particularly heavy box Harry stumbled, the contents spilling out onto the floor. He panicked for a brief moment before sighing, noticing that only minor trinkets and several photographs had fallen out. He sat down, going through each item one by one, blowing off the thick layer of dust before giving it a good rub with his jumper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry carefully set the trinkets aside as he continued to peruse the spilled contents. He found a stack of photos, a mix of Muggle and wizarding in nature as seen by how some moved and other did not. Harry idly flicked through them, before he realized that the people in them looked familiar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sandy haired boy, seated by the fireplace in the Gryffindor Dormitory with the light from the flames putting the scars on his face into stark relief. A dark haired boy with a roguish smile, little arm swung around another boy in spectacles, who was winking at the camera. A girl with hair the colour of the setting sun, smiling sweetly as she sat by the Great Lake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been months since Harry had last seen them, yes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Harry still ached. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he went to sleep that night, photos tucked into thin hands, Harry’s last thought before darkness claimed him was simple.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“If only things were different.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Unbeknownst to Harry, deep within the recesses of his magical core, something began to hum.</span>
</p><hr/><p>The next morning, Harry woke up and made his way downstairs to eat breakfast. Oddly enough, the house-elf was seated on the table, something Harry had been convincing him to do, without any success, for the past several months. Just last week, Kreacher had reluctantly agreed to at least stay in the same room while Harry ate. Clearly, things were still a work in progress- until now.</p><p>
  <span>Humming pleasantly, Harry chose not to say anything about it, fearing that if he brought attention to this fact, Kreacher would revert to eating on the kitchen floor again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he stretched after drinking his morning tea, he glanced over at the pantry and noticed that they were running out of food. This is when Harry noticed something else that was… out of the norm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he stepped outside of Number 12, jeans and hoodie snugly fitted on, he saw that no one else was wearing jeans. Even simpler, there weren’t many people outside to begin with, as opposed to the lunch rush that would usually be out at the moment. Shrugging this off, Harry found a quiet corner and apparated to the Leaky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is when Harry noticed fact number three.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The owner, the workers, heck, even the menu at the Leaky had changed. Most importantly, where people would usually begin whispering as soon as he made an appearance, now they simply ignored him, or smiled politely when they caught his gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry began to understand that something was very, very wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Diagon Alley only confirmed Harry’s worst fears. Eeylops Owl Emporium was still there, and so was Ollivanders and Gringotts. But some shops, like Madam Malkin's and the Magical Menagerie were gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Harry went to Gringotts, the goblins didn’t recognize him, and a blood test showed that he had no connections to any families in their records.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he tried to visit the Burrow, the wards wouldn’t recognize him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His Patronus to Ron and Hermione went unanswered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At a loss, Harry apparated back to Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kreacher,” Harry stammered, “We have a problem.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>From what Harry could understand, he was no longer in his own time. No longer in his own universe, to be specific. After doing some research, he discovered that several major historic events in both the Muggle and Wizarding worlds had never taken place. Grindelwald didn’t seem to exist in this timeline, and no one Harry asked had ever heard of a wizard by the name of Albus Dumbledore. No one knew of Voldemort, or even a single death eater.</p><p>It was now April, as opposed to the December it should have been. </p><p>It was 1970, and Harry was alone.</p>
