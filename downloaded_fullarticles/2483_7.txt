    <p>Harry has always felt drawn to Draco Malfoy, in a way he can't quite explain. He always seems to find an excuse to talk to him, or rather, yell at him. That's what they do - they fight, they scream, they insult, threaten and hex each other. But if Harry's being honest with himself, he wouldn't know what to do without Malfoy. He hates the bloke, sure, and he would like nothing more than to punch him right in his stupid face when he starts attacking Ron and Hermione, but he provides entertainment. Harry can always count on Malfoy to keep him busy when he's bored.</p><p>It's at the beginning of Harry's fifth year that he understands the reason behind his odd attachment. Attraction. Not <em>feelings, </em>for Godric's sake; just simple, physical attraction. And who can blame him - the git's handsome. It's really all Malfoy's own fault, strutting around like he does with those stupidly fitted robes showing off his perfect arse, and always wearing that ridiculous smirk on his face - what does he expect? After all, Harry has <em>eyes. </em></p><p>Now, this makes things a tad bit complicated. In fact, it's a bloody mess. Whenever he's around Malfoy, Harry doesn't quite know what to do with himself. Naturally, he keeps up appearances for he isn't one to become flustered in the face of his enemies, but internally he is constantly screaming when Malfoy is around. It happens that the two get so caught up in their constant bickering during class, it is more often than not the very main reason for Harry's continuously failed potions. Of course he's going to ruin Harry's grades as well. Git. Even worse is when Malfoy decides to get up all close and personal, trying to act cool by shouting his insults mere inches from Harry's face. The (questionably imaginary) sexual tension drives Harry <em>crazy</em>.</p><p>Harry knows he needs to get his shit together, this obviously can't continue. Malfoy might be hot, but nothing could ever happen between them due to him also being, well, a bully. A not-very-good person. Yeah, Harry has to get over his stupid crush immediately. The only question is, how?</p><p>*</p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>"What's up, Harry?" Hermione is sitting by the fire in the Gryffindor common room reading a book, and only glances up at Harry once before continuing to read.<br/> Harry sits down next to her. "Er- can I ask you something?"</p><p>Hermione closes her book after finishing the page she was reading and looks up at him. "Don't tell me you need help with your Potions essay?" She sighs. "I thought you and Ron finished it hours ago, you-"</p><p>"It's not that," Harry interrupts.</p><p>"Oh," Hermione frowns. "Then, what?"</p><p>Harry feels awkward. "Well, uh, I was just wondering... you're usually good with, like, feelings and stuff, yeah?"</p><p>Hermione looks amused. "I guess so," she says. "Go on."</p><p>"I just - how do you - er..." Harry tries to find the right words. "Is there an easy way to, well eh, get over someone?"</p><p>"Oh," a look of understanding shows on Hermione's face. "it's about you fancying Cho?"</p><p>"What?" Harry is confused for a moment. Is she talking about Cho Chang? Sure, she's pretty and sure Harry's noticed her, but - <em>what? </em>He'd only asked her to the Yule Ball last year because he didn't really have anyone else to ask. He realises that it's a perfect cover-up, though, since Hermione guessed it herself it won't be too forced. "Oh, yeah... Yeah, I suppose," he adds quickly, to cover up his previous question. Hermione's extremely good at reading people, but Harry hopes she'll only take his slight confusion for awkward nervousness.</p><p>"I don't know, Harry," she says with a small smile. "Sometimes you just have to wait it out, I'm afraid." The flicker of hope Harry had had that his crush would be over soon goes out at her words. "Although," she continues, "you could try confronting her, I suppose. I know she was with Cedric, but I've seen her look at you when you're not noticing. You never know - she could feel the same way."</p><p>Harry flinches a bit at the mention of Cedric, but considers Hermione's words. <em>Tell</em> Malfoy about his feelings? Ha, fat chance. And like he'd ever return Harry's desires.</p><p>He scowls at the mental image of that. What would he do exactly? Run up to Malfoy after potions and shout loud enough for everyone to hear<em> 'hey Malfoy, I just want you to know that I think you're sexy as hell and if you weren't such a rotten person I would've been shagging you for weeks by now!'</em> and hope that would do it<em>? </em>As if he's not catching enough looks already.</p><p>"I- I can't do that, Hermione. I'm talking about getting <em>over </em>a crush."</p><p>"Well, I don't see the point in that." Hermione only shrugs and opens up her book again.</p><p>Thanks, Hermione. That wasn't such a big help.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry has to endure months of Hermione's encouragements regarding Cho, at the same time as he's trying to deal with Malfoy, Umbridge's detentions, the students' gossiping about him, his nightmares, not being able to talk to Sirius, the ever-growing mountains of homework, plus the regular DA meetings. He's almost thankful he doesn't have Quidditch to worry about on top of all that anymore, but at the same time he would do anything to be up on his broom again. Flying has proved a great stress reliever.<br/> Malfoy and his friends have joined Umbridge's new <em>Inquisitorial squad </em>and he is being an even worse pain the arse than normal. Unfortunately, he still looks great and Harry often finds himself staring at him in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures (although he does his best to make sure it just looks like evil glares).</p><p>He decides to give it a shot with Cho, maybe it'll help him get over Malfoy. At their last DA meeting before Christmas, she actually kisses him and although it mostly feels wrong, he kisses her back.</p><p>After Christmas break Harry is forced to start taking Occlumency lessons from <em>Snape, </em>and having Malfoy thinking he's taking extra Potions lessons makes him feel even worse.</p><p>*</p><p>It's Snape, of course, that gives Harry detention for what feels like the hundredth time. Only, this time, it will be even worse because <em>Malfoy </em>will be with him. The two of them were getting into a quarrel outside of the Great Hall after Harry heard Malfoy loudly singing <em>Weasley is our King. </em>They're just about to get physical, which sadly doesn't go unnoticed by Snape. He's just taken points from Gryffindor, <em>and </em>given Harry detention when McGonagall shows up. She's also seen what happened, and demands that Snape gives Malfoy the same punishment for something they were both involved in. Snape can't go directly against another teacher, so he's forced to do what McGonagall says. Harry's very amused at first - for once Malfoy won't get away with his shit like he always does - but then Snape says they'll be in detention <em>together, </em>brewing a Sleeping Draught because he's running low on it. No doubt Snape only does this to further torture Harry.</p><p>"Normally I wouldn't dare leave you with such a task," he says to Harry, "but I'm sure Draco will make sure it's brewed properly." Harry is furious, but not wanting to lose any more points, he bites his anger back. Then Snape turns to Malfoy.</p><p>"Of course," he says, "you're not to do all the work. Just stop him from making a mess out of it." Malfoy laughs, and Harry walks away, fuming.</p><p>*</p><p>"Fuck," Harry swears as the potion once again turns a colour that it shouldn't.</p><p>Malfoy rolls his eyes at him. "Come on, how hard can it be?" he says with a condescending voice as he works with the potion to fix Harry's mistake."It's only a Sleeping Draught, Potter."</p><p>"Shut up, Malfoy."</p><p>"Oh that's right, I forgot, you're taking <em>remedial potions.</em>" Malfoy sniggers. "But really, this is <em>first year </em>stuff, it's <em>easy.</em>"</p><p>"Easy for you to say!" Harry exclaims before he can stop himself.</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean, Potter?"</p><p>"Just, I always thought Snape only favoured you because you're a Slytherin, but you're actually really good at this and it pisses me off," Harry glances up at Malfoy, who's frowning. "Never mind," he adds with a sigh.</p><p>"I'm well aware of my extraordinary talents in potions, there's no need to point it out for me," Malfoy snaps.</p><p>"Wow," Harry rolls his eyes. "I only said you were good, not <em>extraordinary, </em>don't be so full of yourself."</p><p>Malfoy opens his mouth to answer, but at the same time he happens to glance down at Harry's hands and rushes forward to stop him from making another mistake. "No, no, <em>no, </em>Potter, you absolute worthless potion brewer! You're supposed to stir and heat it <em>before </em>adding the Sopophorous bean, damn it!" He's managed to push Harry's hands away from the cauldron, but in doing so the chopped up Sopophorous bean has fallen from Harry's hands and onto the floor. Malfoy sighs.</p><p>"Sorry," Harry mutters and takes out his wand to gather the scattered bean pieces back in his hands.</p><p>"I swear, I knew how to brew this potion at six years old just from watching my dad!" Malfoy claims with an exasperated tone in his voice."Were you raised in a fucking barn, Potter?"</p><p>Harry feels his anger rising. "No, I was raised in a cupboard if you must know," he bites back and starts vigorously stirring the potion, this time according to the instructions in the book.</p><p>"You- what?" Malfoy looks taken aback at Harry's statement about the cupboard. "You're not serious?"</p><p>Harry looks up, confused. The usual venom is gone from Malfoy's words, and his expression lacks the sneer that so far has seemed to be glued permanently to his face.<br/> "Well- er, yeah," Harry says, for he doesn't know what else to do.</p><p>Malfoy seems to come back to himself, and the sneer reappears as he speaks. "Ha, no wonder. Not even the <em>Muggles</em> wanted you."</p><p>Harry's too caught up in the previous change in Malfoy's behaviour to feel angry or upset at his words. There had been something in his eyes - pity? Understanding? Is it possible that there is another person underneath all of Malfoy's nasty exterior? Harry shakes his head and silently puts his focus back on the potion in front of him again. He's probably just imagining things.</p><p> </p><p>*</p>
