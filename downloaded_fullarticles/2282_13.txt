    <p>Everyone expected Harry to be an Auror, fight dark wizards like he had all his life. But he didn’t like hurting people, so Harry became a healer. He wanted to save people, to make up for some of the damage he made in his youth. This plan was a great one, he was good at wounds, he worked in the emergency wing. Harry was in all senses of the word a first responder, with a stable job, and a house all his own, and friends beside him.<br/>    Draco, on the other hand, was broken, his father was dead, and his mother was hiding somewhere not in his life. He had never been alone like this, his father or mother guiding him, guiding him to do horrible things, twisting his thoughts, and his hands to turn him into a weapon. He also had a house all his own, but it was cold and empty, and he slept alone every night, guilt rushing over him. The dark mark, forever reminding him he was a monster. He had not left his house in 4 years, the local kiddies thought he was a ghost, he was so pale, so sickly, so thin. <br/>    Harry had gone home that night, proud in a job well done, he had saved at least 3 lives. He was just sitting down to dinner, awaiting Ron and Hermione’s arrival for drinks, when he got the Howler. <br/>    “Code 10! Code 10! 1044 RAVEN WAY, WALES! EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NEEDED” The piece of paper shrieked, he sighed and left a note for his friends, took his cloak off the stand, and was gone. <br/>    Draco stares at his forearm, the white bone and mangled muscle tissue taking place of the Dark Mark, blood soaking his mother’s Persian carpets, he could feel the effects of blood loss take hold. He crumpled to the floor, and when his house elf found him, he was half dead, his left arm a bloody, mangled, mess, a silver letter opener just a foot away. The little elf called for St. Mungos, and in less than 5 minutes, Harry crashed through the door and applied Dittany, took hold of his childhood rival, and apparated back to St. Mungo's. <br/>    “He needs immediate attention!” Harry called to the waiting staff, this man is dying!<br/>    “Isn’t that-” <br/>    “Yes it is and he is dying! Didn’t you hear me, O’Malley?!” The assistant took Draco in his arms and set him on a bed to begin surgery. <br/>    “He’s too far gone for just essence of Dittany only, he will need surgery,” the blonde man moaned in his sleep. <br/>    “I need more than one assistant! Now!” He yelled, and two nurses came to assist, he moved the arm so he could disinfect it. “Damnit Malfoy, what were you thinking?” He took various bottles and swabbed the arm, first mending the bone tissue, then the muscle, and finally the skin. It took hours, hours of keeping his rival alive, “He will need to rest for a few weeks, and he will always have a scar there, but he will live.” Harry bid one of the Nurses to take him to Intensive Care. And he went home, where Ron and Hermione were waiting for him. <br/>    “Who was it this time Mate?” Ron said when Harry popped into existence, “A brawl? Dog attack?” <br/>“Darling, give him a moment, can’t you see? He’s in shock!” Hermione sat him down and pushed a cup of tea into her friend's hand. <br/>“Suicide, at least I think, Malfoy, he cut out his dark mark with a silver letter opener.”<br/>The Trio went silent, <br/>    “Blimey, is he going to live?” Ron whispered, <br/>    “I think so, it depends on whether he wants to or not.” <br/>    “Oh, Harry! I am so sorry you had to go through that!” Hermione hugged him as he put his head in his hands. <br/>    “He wasn’t kidding when he said he was guilty was he?” Ron said quietly <br/>    “I guess not,” Harry muttered, “I guess years of sleeping alone, and being a shut-in finally got to him.” <br/>    “We will stay here for the night, you shouldn’t be alone either after that.” <br/>    “Yeah, we will stay here Mate.”</p>
