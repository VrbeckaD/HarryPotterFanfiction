    <p>Blood dripped onto the crisp white snow, turning it a deep scarlet color, the contrast of it looking oddly beautiful to Sirius despite the fact that it was his blood creating such imagery.</p><p>He tore his gaze away from the ground and continued forward, his legs feeling quite numb at this point and his teeth chattering loudly, though the only thing he could hear was the pounding of his heart in his ears. How he wished he could have at least grabbed his jacket…</p><p>
  <em>“Filth! Disgrace on my name!” </em>
</p><p>Sirius flinched, the memory of his mother’s furious expression flashing through his mind followed quickly by a slap. Subconsciously, he brought his hand up to feel across the cut her ring had made on his cheek, idly wondering if he should be concerned that he couldn’t feel his fingers tracing it.</p><p>
  <em>“Fornicating with mudbloods! The absolute treachery!” </em>
</p><p>That had made Sirius laugh. It was just so funny, really, that the reason his mother had gotten so worked up in the first place was because Lily Evans had written him a letter. He and Evans had become friends, sure, but the Lily was the last person Sirius would ever find himself ‘<em>fornicating</em>’ with, considering how much he liked to look at Remus instead of her—though he would never tell his parents that. Besides, he wouldn’t do that to James.</p><p>
  <em>“You are no son of mine.” </em>
</p><p>Orion had punctuated every word with a kick to the ribs, his steel toed boots digging in sharply. Sirius was sure he had some broken bones as a result. It was the only thing that explained the pain he felt with each breath he took.</p><p>
  <em>“You’ll learn your lesson. You’ll learn not to disgrace this family! Crucio!” </em>
</p><p>He had been told before what the cruciatus curse was supposed to feel like. They had studied in at Hogwarts in their Defense Against the Dark Arts class. But experiencing it was a whole other story. It was as if every nerve in his body had been on fire. He hadn’t even realized that he was screaming until he felt the rawness of his throat afterward and the shakiness of his limbs as he collapsed to the floor.</p><p>
  <em>“Stop it! Stop it, you’re hurting him!”</em>
</p><p>Regulus. He had left Regulus there. He’d left his little brother with those monsters. But how could he have stayed? They would’ve killed him, surely.</p><p>He wasn’t sure he would’ve cared if they had.</p><p>He couldn’t even remember how he got out. Everything went black after while. He had woken up outside, unsure if he had ran out the door himself or if his parents had simply thrown him onto the street. There were residual pains of the cruciatus curse running through his body and blood dripping from his chest as a result of his fathers whipping job. Not the mention the bruises he felt in all over his body.</p><p>He knew he had to leave. The December snow was falling heavily and the cold had started to freeze him up rapidly, but he walked anyway, determined to get as far away as possible.</p><p>
  <em>I have to get to James, I have to get to James…</em>
</p><p>His thoughts were like a mantra replaying over and over in his head to keep him going, to keep him focused on where he was headed. But it was late, maybe even late enough to be early morning at that point, and his mind was beginning to become more and more fuzzy with each step.</p><p>“James…” He muttered, his eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>There was a twisting feeling in his stomach and suddenly he was falling into a familiar flower garden, knocking a pot over as he went before slipping into unconsciousness.</p>
