    <p>Sirius Black walks down the dark street as rain falls on the shoulders and head of his jumper that's way too big. He walks slightly hunched over as he sucks on the cigarette that dangles from his left hand. The street echoes the noises of his feet hitting the pavement and the sound of soft rain hitting down. Every once in a while a car will pass by him with its light creeping up behind him before disappearing. Other than the few stray cars and himself, Sirius was all alone. The shops have been long shut and the party goers have already passed out somewhere. Sirius had been neither that night, not a normal citizen nor a teenager partying his time away. Looking up at the street clock, he reads that it’s ten past four. He wipes the few drops of rain off of his face as he takes a drag from his cigarette. Once he reaches the bottom of the small hill that the street wraps over he stops under the awning of a shop and takes a short break. Inside the small shop are girlish clothes, but the outside is absolutely filthy. He finishes the last of his cigarette when a car slowly pulls forward. </p><p>“You need a ride?” The middle age driver says as he leans over and rolls down the window. </p><p>“If it’s not a problem,” he replies from the steps. </p><p>“It’s really no problem at all,” he stands up, flicks his cigarette down, and smashes the butt with the toe of his boot. </p><p>“Where’s it to?” the driver asks as he gets in and closes the door. He gives him and address and they pull forward.  </p><p>“You want some cigs?” he offers as he holds up his pack. </p><p>“That would be a nice payment, indeed,” he answers and Sirius pulls out five from the pack and hands them to him. “What is a young lad like you doing out here at this time of night? Do your parents know where you’re at?”</p><p>“Not that it matters if they did,” he mumbles. </p><p>“You’re in for a whoopin' tonight,” the driver chuckles as he lights a cigarette. “What’s your name sonnie?”</p><p>“Sirius,” he answers. </p><p>“Traditional parents, eh, with a name like that. I’m Mitchel,” he says as he looks around before running a red light. “Don’t mind me driving, it’s not like there’s anyone around. That’s why I was able to see you so easily, only moving thing out tonight.” </p><p>“What are you out and about for?” </p><p>“Just getting back from work, I’m up at the factory fifty miles back,” he takes a drag form his cigarette and slowly lets it out. “And what’s your story?” </p><p>“It’s a long, messy one, you don’t want to know,” Sirius says as he plays with the fog on the window. </p><p>“Well, we got an awfully long way back to your place,” the driver nods. </p><p>"It's bad, I've mad some choices," Sirius says as he stares out the window not sure if he is ready to dive into this, not sure if he is ready to go back. </p><p>"I wouldn't have believed those words from a seventeen year old in a second," the driver protests and Sirius looks at him. "Any other seventeen year old except for you," he blows out smoke, "you've seen some things kid." Sirius pulls his jumper around his hands and looks down at his lap. "Well, get on with it. We ain't got all night." </p><p>"Don't... just wait 'till the end."</p>
