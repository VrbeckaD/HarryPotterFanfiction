</p>
<p>
  <span>“Here we go.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The first of September marked the beginning of another year at Hogwarts for Alyra Avery, this would be her Fifth.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra stood in front of the large mirror in her bedroom, sighing as she knotted the emerald green ribbon into her hair, holding half of it back while the rest of her dark locks rested on her shoulders. She fixed the soft strands which rested along the sides of her face, framing it delicately. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Picking up the silver locket necklace off her bedside table, she clicked it open to reveal a small moving portrait of a woman with hair and lips that matched her own. The woman had a warm smile, her eyes twinkling as she laughed in delight. Alyra traced her thumb around the round shape of the locket with a small smile, watching the image of her mother as her chest felt tight for a moment. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Xenetta Avery had passed the day she had birthed her daughter. Alyra had always sensed that her father harboured resent towards the girl over the death of his late wife, and with her birthday approaching it would bring about the fifteenth anniversary of her mother’s death. A grim thing to think about for one’s birthday, but that was the reality for the Avery girl. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Clicking the locket closed, she brought the chain around her neck and clipped it together before tucking it under her blouse; keeping the mother she never knew close to her heart. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra picked up the large trunk which rested on the floor of her bedroom and lugged it out, while a small black cat slipped around her and followed at her side. The two made their way towards the staircase and down to the lower floor of the manor, where the rest of the Avery family was also preparing for their departure. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ellana dear, stop fussing. Your sister will be down in a moment,” spoke Victoria Avery, as she calmed the younger girl who was bouncing with excitement. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra rolled her amber eyes as she dropped her trunk next to her sister’s, “I’m already here. We’ve still got plenty of time.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I just want to get there already,” Ellana whined as she swung her feet back and forth on the chair she had been perched upon, impatient as ever. It was Ellana Avery’s first year at Hogwarts and she had been babbling excitedly about her beginning since the day her letter had arrived.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Father and Silas should be on their way back soon, then we can leave. Don’t you want to say your goodbyes?” Alyra tilted her head to the side in question as she dropped beside her half-sister on the seat.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ellana waved her sister off, “Yeah, yeah…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Leaning back onto the soft back of her chair, Alyra glanced off to the large family portrait which hung above the warm fireplace in the living room. Framed in fine silver with a large diamond dragon head placed on the center of the base, the painting depicted the late Avery Patriarch, Orin Avery, seated on a throne-like chair with his eldest son, Leonidas Avery, standing behind him. On the left stood Silas Avery, the son of Leonidas and Xenetta, along with his younger sister Alyra in front. To the right, stood Victoria, Leonidas’ wife, and daughter Ellana. A proud Pure-blood family of the Sacred Twenty Eight. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Orin had perished earlier in the year, soon after the return of the Dark Lord, who he had been a friend and follower of during their time at Hogwarts. He was a stoic yet proud man who strongly believed in the importance of blood purity, and acted as an advocate for the cause led by Voldemort. Orin appeared calm and regal in the portrait, his robes bearing the Avery family crest and contrasting with the amber eyes he had passed down to his son and grandchildren. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra’s attention travelled to her father, Leonidas, who stood behind his father with his left hand on the older man’s shoulder and his right hand on the shoulder of his son. Leonidas resembled his father greatly, a similar proud look on his face. Following in the beliefs of Orin, he was quick to support the Dark Lord at his return, once again following as a Death Eater. He was now the patriarch of the Avery family and the death of his father impacted his connection with the Dark Lord, but he had sworn to honour his promises and support Voldemort just as his father had done. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Next came Silas, his only son and the first heir of the Avery family. Silas also shared the resemblance of his grandfather, with silver rings roped around his fingers and the same dark robes adorned with the family crest. He was the golden boy who idolised his father and was now formally initiated into the Death Eater ranks. He acted as an agent for the Dark Lord, working in the Ministry of Magic to inform the others of the movements transpiring within the Ministry. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To the right was Alyra’s stepmother, Victoria, looking elegant as ever in a silk dress while her lighter brown hair laid atop her slender shoulders. Victoria married into the Avery family when Alyra was 3 years old and had become her mother figure over the years. She had spent many years with the Averys however as her family was closely acquainted and eventually had approved of a match with Leonidas after the loss of Xenetta. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Victoria’s hands rested on the shoulders of her daughter, Ellana, who inherited her mother’s fairer brown hair yet her father’s almost-golden eyes. Ellana was a curious, confident, and bright young girl, having just turned eleven a few months prior, she was now ready to begin her studies at Hogwarts just as her siblings had done. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra concluded her inspection of the family portrait as her eyes passed over the image of herself, dressed in a black blouse and skirt with her fine aspen wand clutched in her right hand. The quiet middle child who preferred to stand by and observe all others around her than be in the spotlight, however no less stubborn and strong willed than her father and brother. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her eyes were drawn from the picture when a loud ‘pop’ sound came from the entrance to the estate. Leonidas and Silas had returned. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Finally,” Ellana sprung out of her seat and rushed towards the doors as the two men walked in. “Took you guys long enough!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Apologies for keeping you waiting, my dear,” her father laid a hand on her shoulder, before heading towards the stack of Ellana’s belongings. He pulled his wand from the pocket of his fine robes, waving it once. “We best head off then, can’t have you missing your train on your first day,” he made his way back towards the doors as the items floated through the air in front of him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Come, Artemis,” Alyra called to her small black cat, following after her family. She glanced back into the home before leaving through the tall gates.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sound of screeching metal and a smoky scent filled the air as the Avery family passed through the gateway to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, the familiar large black and red train coming into view. The group moved towards the train, stopping near a carriage door to say their goodbyes. Leonidas organised their belongings onto the train while Victoria fussed over her daughter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, you have everything?” Victoria asked as she adjusted Ellana’s collar, receiving an enthusiastic nod. “Good. I can’t believe this day has come, I am so proud of you sweetheart,” she pulled her into a tight embrace and placed a kiss on her head with a soft smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, please don’t embarrass me before I’ve even started,” Ellana giggled, “I’m going to miss you so much.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to miss you too,” she released her daughter and rubbed her arms gently. “Behave yourself, okay? Listen to your sister and stay out of trouble.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll be a perfect angel,” Ellana placed a hand on her heart, before diving towards Silas and hugging him around the waist. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re growing up too fast, El,” her older brother ruffled her hair, earning a glare from the girl as she fixed the stray hairs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Victoria turned to Alyra, “Please take care of your sister,” she spoke, stroking her upper arm delicately, “And be safe.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Always,” she allowed her stepmother to envelop her in a mild hug, lips curving into a smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Leonidas returned to bid his farewells, giving Alyra some time to scan the crowds nearby for her friends. Parents and students were rushing around, getting ready to leave for another year. There were many tears from certain mothers and eye rolls from embarrassed children littered about the platform, while others scrambled onto the train carriages. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A familiar platinum blond caught her eye as he stepped onto the prefect’s carriage near the front of the train, giving his parents a nod with a smirk across his lips before disappearing inside. </span>
  <em>
    <span>So the rumors are true, he is the new Slytherin Prefect.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The sudden touch on her shoulder broke her away from her thoughts, “You okay, sis?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” she replied, turning back to face her brother, “I was trying to see if I could spot Char before we got on.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Her father was at the gathering too, I’m sure she’ll be here soon,” Silas shrugged, “Do be careful, will you? I’ve been told you’ll have a new professor from the Ministry this year and from what I’ve seen she seems a bit...</span>
  <em>
    <span>Deranged.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t say I’m surprised. With Potter running around spreading the word of </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> return, they were bound to send one of their own in,” she rolled her eyes, arms crossed against her chest. “Is there anything I should know? Anything that concerns your duties?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The older boy shook his head, “Nothing you need to worry about.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Aly, let’s get on before all the compartments are full up,” Ellana tugged at her sister’s sleeve.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra gently lifted her cat into her arms and started towards the carriage, turning back to her brother for a moment, “I’ll see you in a few months, yeah?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t miss us too much,” Ellana grinned before grabbing at her sister’s arm again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Their father gave Alyra a farewell nod, to which she responded with a small smile, then stepped onto the carriage with her sister in tow. The two made their way through the carriage until they found an empty compartment, dropping onto the seats across from each other. Alyra left the door open in hopes that her friends would join them once they made it on, while Ellana peered through the window to find their family they had left behind. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A sigh fell through Alyra’s lips, settling herself in for the long journey. The train had soon begun to whistle, signalling that it was time to leave. She watched as her sister waved to their parents and brother excitedly. Silas sent the girls a quick two finger salute and a wink, while Victoria waved and their father held a tight smile. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t long after the carriage had begun to travel that two girls appeared at the door to the compartment, rushing in to sit with their friend.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Char, Sas! Took your bloody time, where have you two been?” Alyra squeezed both girls into a hug.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Charlotte spoke first, “Look, blame the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dark Lord</span>
  </em>
  <span> for this one. I was all set to leave, but my father insisted on coming along to see me off and with their weird ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>gatherings</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ he was late to pick me up.” She closed the compartment door as she spoke quietly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And you know me, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> prioritise sleep over anything,” shrugging her shoulders, Saskia leaned back onto her seat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well I’m just glad you made it, would’ve sucked to have spent this whole ride with just this one,” Alyra gestured towards her younger sister, who responded with a frown and stuck her tongue out.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s right, it’s your first year, El. Are you nervous?” Charlotte rested onto the seat next to Alyra.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nervous? Me? Never,” the younger girl flicked her light brown locks over her shoulder. “Now, where’s that snack trolley?” She jumped up and wandered out of the compartment in search. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Charlotte turned to Alyra, blue eyes shimmering with curiosity, “How was your summer? Is your family doing okay?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Pretty miserable, honestly. The funeral was intense and we’ve had visitors in and out since my grandfather died. Although as much as I dislike studying, I’d much rather be back at Hogwarts with you guys,” she replied with a quick shrug, “I’m assuming yours was better?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You could say that. It was nice to see my sister again though now that she’s finally back,” Charlotte toyed with her long, loose braid. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I heard she’s been on quite the adventure. Silas sure missed her dearly,” Alyra smirked, bumping her elbow onto her friend’s arm.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you think he’ll propose soon?” Saskia chimed in, leaning inquisitively towards the two girls.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I hope so, but with everything that’s going on I’m not sure they’ll be having a wedding for a while,” Alyra let out a small sigh, before turning to Charlotte with a grin, “At least we’ll get to become family when it finally happens.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Charlotte giggled, “In a way! What about you Sas? How was your holiday?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Saskia laid back in her seat, soft green eyes trailing off to the window, watching as the train tracked through the countryside, “It was nice, Mum and I spent a few weeks with my Grandmother, but I spent most of it practising my flying. I’m thinking about trying out for the Quidditch team this year.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’d be amazing! I hear Blaise is keen to try out as well, you’d be a great duo,” Charlotte patted Saskia’s knee in encouragement, receiving an eye roll and purse of the lips as she blushed. “Did you guys hear about this year’s prefects?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I saw Draco looking pretty smug when he got onto the prefect’s carriage,” Alyra scoffed with a shake of her head, stroking Artemis’ head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean I get Malfoy, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> fairly clever and Snape definitely favours him, but Parkinson? She’s nothing but an insufferable muppet. She’s not going to let us hear the end of it,” Charlotte ran a hand down her face, loose strands of her strawberry blonde hair falling onto her face.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up Malfoy,” The voice of Hermione Granger came through the compartment door, which Ellana had left open on her way out. “Get out!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Speak of the devil,” Saskia muttered, peeking her head out the door to look down the carriage.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Charlotte and Alyra followed, watching as Draco Malfoy sniggered to himself as he walked away from the compartment that the commotion had come from, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle following behind him. The three approached the door the girls had been watching through along their path, pausing for a moment.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you looking at?” the Malfoy boy raised an eyebrow, arms folded before his grey eyes flashed to Alyra, “Hm, Avery?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Having fun terrorising Potter again are we, Malfoy?” she sneered, standing straight to imitate his stance.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s it to you?” he frowned, stepping closer towards the three.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra also took a step closer, tilting her head to the side with a pout, “What? Are you going to give me a detention for backtalk, Mr. Prefect?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Watch your mouth or I just might,” he narrowed his eyes, shooting her a quick look up and down.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Whatever, Draco,” she drawled, before using the back of her hand to tap his arm, pushing him back and closing the door. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t think I won’t,” he growled as he continued on his way down the carriage and back to his own.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra picked up her small cat and sat back down, placing Artemis in her lap. Gently, she scratched behind the feline’s ear, turning back to watch the scenery out the window.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That was awfully flirty of you,” Saskia sent her a suspicious look. “What was that all about?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Alyra looked baffled, her dark brows furrowed as she continued stroking her cat.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Are you going to give me a detention Mr. Prefect?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Charlotte mimicked, raising a snicker from Saskia. “What are you up to, Ly? Are you feeling okay?” She prodded Alyra’s shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Alyra groaned, laying her head back against the seat. “I think you both know I’d rather Avada myself than go there.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Averys and Malfoys had always been closely tied families, due to their long-time following of the Dark Lord, as well as being a large part of the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight.’ Alyra could not remember a time before she had met both Charlotte and Draco, having known both her whole life. Charlotte belonged to the Burke family, another long line of Pure-bloods with whom the two families were closely knit to. Orin Avery had always hoped one of his grandchildren would eventually marry one of the other family, continuing the Pure-blood lines and it sure as hell was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> going to be Alyra. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The compartment door opened once again, Ellana singing as she walked through, “I’m baaack!” Her arms were full of sweets which she dropped next to her as she returned to her seat. Looking at the three girls, she popped a Bertie Bott’s in her mouth, before holding the box out to the others.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Bean?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loosening the green tie around her neck gently, Alyra followed her housemates into the Great Hall. Charlotte looped her arm around Alyra’s and the other around Saskia’s as they walked in together. The Great Hall was filled with chatter and excitement as students settled into their seats. Alyra glanced up at the artificial sky which was dark and cloudy, while candles floated about, illuminating the room. The smell of melting wax was in the air from the countless candles, a scent which she strangely found quite comforting. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The school ghosts hovered around the hall, making their way to join students at the long wooden tables. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The three headed towards the Slytherin table, splitting as they took their seats. Charlotte and Saskia slid onto one side, while Alyra parked herself on the opposite next to a tall, deeper skinned boy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, Zabini,” the girls greeted in unison as they faced him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Blaise raised an eyebrow, nodding in acknowledgement, “Ladies.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nonchalant as ever,” Alyra shook her head lightly and rested her chin on the palm of her hand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you expect hugs and tears of joy?” he shot back, receiving a grin and an arm around the neck from the girl beside him which he quickly shook off.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t act like you’re not happy to see us,” she gave him a small shove on the shoulder, then turned back to the other two. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Looks like we’re about to get started,” Saskia nudged her head towards the large table where the Hogwarts Professors were seated, conversing amongst themselves. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A squat woman dressed head to toe in pink caught Alyra’s eye. She was sitting next to their Headmaster, chattering into his ear and sipping from her goblet. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That must be her</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She really does look like quite the fruitcake.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Moments later, Professor Grubbly-Plank took his seat and the Entrance Hall doors flew open, Professor McGonagall leading the large group of first-years in. Alyra scanned for Ellana as she walked through, her eyes lit up by the candles and the evident excitement in her face. McGonagall set down the stool and announced the Sorting Ceremony, beginning with a small boy named Euan Abercrombie.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you think your sister is going to be sorted into Slytherin too?” asked Charlotte, her eyes darting between the ceremony and back to her friend.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, all our family has been in Slytherin for years,” Alyra had no doubts that her sister would be in the same house, it would be as it has been for centuries. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She watched intently while two other first-years were sorted, and now it was time for Ellana’s sorting. The young girl jumped onto the stool and the sorting hat was placed onto her head, a large grin across her lips. The hat spoke for a few moments before calling out something she had never expected to hear. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Alyra caught her sister’s eye, mouth dropping open as the two looked at each other completely dumbfounded. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What. The. Fuck. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ellana was soon rushed off the stool and she bounded down to join the Hufflepuff table. Alyra slowly turned back to her own table, tuning the rest of the ceremony out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What just happened?” Saskia and Charlotte gave each other a look of confusion, then to Alyra who stared down at the wood in shock. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“My father is going to be furious,” she muttered, covering her face with her hands. She could feel many pairs of Slytherin eyes gawking at her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>An Avery in Hufflepuff? No fucking way.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Time seemed to slow down as the rest of the first-years were sorted and the feast had begun, platters and large bowls of food were revealed with the delicious scent of pastries and roasted delicacies filling everyone’s noses. Still feeling mildly shaken up, Alyra picked up a few pieces of roasted chicken along with a large scoop of mashed potatoes and nibbled on her meal.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She remained considerably quiet during the feast, chiming in every so often as her friends talked. As minimal as her appetite was, she dug into the chocolate gateau and a chocolate eclair, something she could never resist. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once everyone was full bellied, the feast disappeared and Professor Dumbledore began his start of term notices. With a few updates to staffing, he then introduced the new pink Professor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Geez, that is a </span>
  <em>
    <span>lot</span>
  </em>
  <span> of pink,” Charlotte whispered behind the polite applause, clapping softly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s that woman from the Ministry my brother mentioned,” Alyra added with a repulsed look, brows raised as the woman suddenly stood up and cleared her throat, approaching the headmaster. “Who does she think she is?”</span>
