  <strong>Sealed with a rose</strong>
</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed heavily as he walked through Diagon Ally. It was only two days before his 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, yet for some reason he felt so restless. As he walked through the crowded streets it only seemed to get worse. <em>‘Can’t get anything done, might as well head home’ </em>Harry thought before heading for the Leaky Caldron. As Harry looked around a patch of blonde hair catching his attentions just before green eyes came across grey both widening in surprise.</p><p><em>’what is Malfoy doing here’ </em>Harry asked himself before frowning as the blonde got up just to head his direction.<br/> “Potter, can we talk” Draco asked sounding somewhat defeated causing Harry to raise an eye brow in confusion.  <br/> “Fine” Harry shrugged as they headed to sit down in a secluded corner. </p><p>“You wanted to talk, so talk” Draco looked down uncharacteristically nibbled on his bottom lip while Harry looked the blonde over even more confused.</p><p>“My father has thrown me out” Harry’s eyes grow wide at this news</p><p>“What?” the blonde’s whole body seemed to shrink as he said it once again;</p><p>Harry’s jaw dropped at this news before grabbing Draco’s arm to the blonde’s bewilderment and started leading him to a floo network trap. As Harry throw the floo powder in he pulled out a small piece of paper to write down directions on.</p><p>“Draco, wait five minutes before coming over okay”</p><p><em>‘Since when did he start calling me Draco” </em>Draco asked himself instead of raising an eye brow confused. The blonde returning his thought to the present realize that Harry’s green eyes were waiting for an answer; Draco just nodded as he watched Harry floo away.</p><p>x-------------x</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked around his house making sure everything was in place before taping the fireplace he only five minutes ago walked through.</p><p>Draco walked out of the fireplace while dusting himself off pitifully already looking around so he could get a good look at the room he was now in. the walls were a light grey with brown trim. The only furniture consisting of a large café table, two love seats, and a large couch all in black.</p><p>
  <em>‘This place is way too neutral’</em>
</p><p>“Okay, start from the beginning” Harry ordered pointing at the only couch not giving the blonde Slytherin any time to rethink anything. Draco nodded before sitting down as Harry’s head disappeared into another room whose doorway he had previous given the order from. Harry smiled gentle as he walked back out with drinks. “Okay so spill”  </p><p>The blonde swallowed hard “Um… my farther took me to see a seer two weeks ago”</p><p>Harry nodded. “That was the day of my 17<sup>th</sup>birthday; she said something’s that made him very displeased”</p><p><em>‘What could she have said to do that’</em> Harry thought frowning. Draco now so nervous found rubbing out the wrinkles in his black dress pants somewhat calming but still did not continue “what did she say?” Draco sighed before opening and closing his mouth having a very hard time figuring out how to say it. Harry smiled became even more gentle if possible as he patted the blonde on the back. Both boys’ heads snapping to look at the front door as the bell rang. Harry sighed as he got up <em>‘who is it now’ </em>Harry frowned before putting on a fake smile as he looked at the six small dots on the top lock at the sight of the yellow one glowing his smile became even more forced.</p><p>“Professor! What brings you here?” Harry asked Dumbledore the older males eyes twinkling as he walked in Severus Snape right behind him. Both men couldn’t help but freeze at the sight of Draco sitting on Harry’s couch.</p><p>“DRACO!” Snape snapped causing said blonde to jump “Uncle Severus” Draco answered pitifully all pride lost and disappointment was clearly painted on the younger male’s face.</p><p>“Your mother has been worried sick looking for you” the blondes face couldn’t help paling even more at his godfather’s words. Harry frowned at this walking over to Draco, already taking a defensive stand in front of the other male surprising not only himself, but the rooms other occupants</p><p>“From what Draco has informed me Lucius is the one that throw him out, why douse his mother not know this?” Harry growled glaring at Snape as the black-haired man’s jaw dropped faster than you could say Weasly Works.</p><p> “But Lucius was with her just as worried” Draco paled even more before gripping his sides shaking “they told him… MERLIN SAVE ME! THEY TOLD HIM!”</p><p>Draco screamed Harry gripped Draco’s shoulders as the blonde started having a massive panic attack. <br/> “THEY TOLD HIM! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” Harry frowned as Draco grip on his shirt tightened “shush… nothing’s going to happen to you” Harry soothed pulling the blonde close as he started rubbing the Slytherin’s back. Draco sniffed before loosening his grip on the brunette’s shirt by now taking deep breathes.</p><p> “Mr. Malfoy would you care to explain, please?” Dumbledore asked kneeling down so he was now at eye level with the still panicked younger male. “A seer said that I have the key to helping Harry kill the Dark Lord”</p><p>Snape gasped at this just to gawk at his godson as Harry started running his hand thought Draco’s hair calming him even more.</p><p> “Did the seer tell you how?” Dumbledore asked his eyes twinkling, Draco shook his head no before his eyes slipped closed from exhaustion leading the blonde to peaceful sleep.</p><p>“Potter, since when have you and my godson been so close”</p><p>Snape asked as Harry gentle helped Draco lie down; the younger male shrugging his shoulders confusion clearly painted on his face.</p><p>“Never, I found him about an hour ago in the leaky caldron before he asked if we could talk.” Snape raised an eye brow at this.</p><p>“I was going to say bug off, but I stopped. I don’t know why” Harry finished Snape sighed before walking out of the room. Dumbledore nodded in understanding before heading out as well “oh don’t forget to come down to the great hall for dinner” the older man said before shutting the door</p>
