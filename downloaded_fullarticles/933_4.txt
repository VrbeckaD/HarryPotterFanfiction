  <em>Once upon a time, before I came, you were all alone. You cried and cried and watched TV all day and were like a zombie. But you wished and wished for me, and Light flickered and I came shooting out onto rug, NYOOM. Then you cutted the cord and said 'Hello Scorpius.'</em>
</p><p> </p><p>I blink my eyes open. Today is a special day. It's my birthday and I'm five. Before today I was four, then a bit of time ago I was three then two then one then zero. Five is the biggest I've ever been.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, wake up!" I nudge him. He groans and slowly opens his eyes. "Pa, I'm five!" He wraps his arms around me and rolls me up in a hug. "Happy birthday, Scorp." He whispers into my hair, white like his. Pa insists that its white-blond, but it's really just white.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa," I ask. "was I negative before zero?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa laughs. "No, you weren't born before you were zero."</p><p> </p><p>"Where was I before then?" I ask, pulling off my sleep top and pulling on a pair of pants. Pa shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>"You were in the Sky." Pa says vaguely. He means outer space.</p><p> </p><p>"And then you wished and wished for me, and I came crashing down through Light onto rug?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa laughs again. "Something like that, Scorp."</p><p> </p><p>Pa gets breakfast ready whilst I say hello to Room. I say hello to Eggsnake, Wardrobe, Sink, to TV. I have to say hello to Room otherwise it won't know to be awake and it might sleep through my birthday.</p><p> </p><p>"It's my birthday!" I whisper to Eggsnake. He's my favourite.  "Pa, it's my birthday. I'm five."</p><p> </p><p>Pa smiles at me as he ties his long hair back. My hair goes down my back all the way to my butt and Pa's goes down a little way past his shoulders.  "So, Mr.Five, what would you like to do first, eat breakfast or find out what special activity we're doing today?"</p><p> </p><p>I chew on my finger as I decide. I choose breakfast first.</p><p> </p><p>I have to take a vitamin before everything. Pa says they'll keep me strong. He doesn't have vitamins, he says he doesn't need one, and he's bigger than me so I think he's strong anyway. Then we have breakfast. It's cornflakes. Pa pours both of ours to make sure I get the right amount, I'm rubbish at counting but Pa used to say it's because I'm only four. But now I'm five, I might be better at it. Halfway through he starts rubbing the outside of his mouth. "Is Bad Tooth hurting?" I ask. He nods and taps his head.</p><p> </p><p>"There are worse things." He reminds me.</p><p> </p><p>"Like your bad wrist?" I ask. Pa nods.</p><p> </p><p>"Just like my bad wrist."</p><p> </p><p>I finish my breakfast extra quick because I want to find out what Pa has planned. Last year on my birthday I got a thing called a sugar mouse, and it took me all day to eat it.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr Five, how do you feel about baking a birthday cake?" Pa asks.</p><p> </p><p>My mouth drops open.</p><p> </p><p>"A birthday cake? Like in TV?" I say, not really believing him. I didn't even know they existed in Room. I thought it was just a TV thing or a story thing, like dogs and dragons and pigeons.</p><p> </p><p>"Just like TV, but real."</p><p> </p><p>I grin toothily. "No way."</p><p> </p><p>Pa laughs. Before we have birthday cake, we have to exercise first. Pa says I'm the best at stretch and running, but I think he's lying because he can stretch more than me, even though I can almost get both legs to go in completely opposite directions. I'm super better at running. Pa doesn't do running because he's too tall and it only takes him one big step to get from one end of room to the other.</p><p> </p><p>I jump up and down on Bed as Pa puts Table back where it should be on top of Rug.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Scorpius the dragon slayer! I'm gonna burst out of Light and with my dragon and bong bong bong with all of the planets and dragons!"</p><p> </p><p>Making a cake is messy and fun. The flour goes everywhere, mostly because we threw some at each other when I got bored. Pa lets me do the stirring because of his bad wrist, his left one is all red and bruised a bit below the tattoo and around the bracelet. We have to be careful not to crack the eggshells too bad, Eggsnake needs them to grow. When it's baking I wash up and Pa sleeps. He sleeps a lot more than I do, even though I'm smaller. He says it's because he gets less energy from sleep, so he has to do it more.</p><p> </p><p>I watch TV while the cake is baking. Teletubbies is on, and Po is my favourite, because it sounds like Pa. I watch it until Pa pulls back the covers in bed and then quickly turn it off, wanting to taste the cake.</p><p> </p><p>The cake is done in the next five minutes and Pa makes me wait at Table while he puts the icing and candles and fire on. I close my eyes while he puts it down.</p><p> </p><p>The cake is as big as the plate, and the icing is white and has 5, the number way not the letter way, on it. There's no candles and no fire. I don't understand. It can't be a birthday cake without them.</p><p> </p><p>"Now with the candles and fire?" I ask, confused.</p><p> </p><p>Pa makes a face. "We don't have any candles, Scorp."</p><p> </p><p>But how can it be a birthday cake if there's no candles. "You said a birthday cake for real. That means candles and fire." I know I'm scowling, but I wanted candles. Pa said it would be a real birthday cake.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay without the candles, Scorp. " Pa says.</p><p> </p><p>"You should've asked Old Tom and Red for candles for Sundaytreat, not dumb jeans."</p><p> </p><p>"Scorpius." He says in his warning voice. "I can only ask for things we need, like actual food that will last and that They can get easily."</p><p> </p><p>"They get anything, by magic, like at the magic school!" Pa pales a bit, and his face goes funny for a second.</p><p> </p><p>"C'mon, lets try a bite." He tries. I know I'm being mean but I can't help it. He promised it was like a TV cake.</p><p> </p><p>I huff loudly in defeat. I don't like it when Pa's face goes funny, it makes my tummy twist. Even though I don't want any without candles, I nod.</p><p> </p><p>"'Kay."</p><p> </p><p>Pa cuts me a slice, a quarter because it's cut in four pieces, and I take a bit. It tastes sweet and yummy, just like I thought TV cakes would taste. The icing makes my fingers sticky, though. Pa normally tells me to wash my hands in Sink when they get sticky but he says because it's my birthday I don't have to wash them yet and can just lick it off, and he gives me the cup with the leftover icing in it.</p><p> </p><p>After I finish the all the icing Pa does make me wash my hands, and then I measure myself on the bit of wall next to Door.</p><p> </p><p>"Have I grown much?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa grins. "So much, young gentleman, I assure you. You'll be bigger than me in no time!" He says in his posh voice which he uses when making fun of people on TV. I giggle.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll grow so big that I'll burst out of Room and zoom around in outer space!"</p><p> </p><p>"I hope you won't leave your old Pa behind!" Pa says.</p><p> </p><p>"Never never never!" I chant. I turn my head to look at how high I am, and it says <em>104CM</em> in marker pen. Last year I was only 99CM!</p><p> </p><p>I watch TV with Pa for a bit, but the picture keeps going all fuzzy. Pa just says we'll have to make do, so instead of watching the fuzzy TV we play snap on Bed. I win, matching six pairs while Pa only matches three. There used to be another pair of cards but I chewed one up when I was a baby, so Pa pinned the chewed up one inside Wardrobe and tucked the other one in between the pages of <em>Tales of Beedle the Bard</em>, like a bookmark.</p><p> </p><p>We have Bath after, and we play mermen. The sea is too big to exist in Room, from what the old man on TV says, but it would be nice. I get extra bubbles too, as I'm five. Pa makes me a bubble crown and he gets a bubble beard. I want to keep it on forever, but I can't because bubbles disappear after a bit and Pa has to wash my hair. My hair is white like his and it takes longer to wash because it's much longer than Pa's and he says it's also baby-fine.</p><p> </p><p>After Bath Pa tells me stories. My favourites are the ones about the magic school. Pa always says he's in Slytherin, so that means I'd be a Slytherin too. But not really 'cause schools and snakes are just something that's in TV. TV things aren't real. Well, most of them aren't. Cake is. I hope dragons are too.</p><p> </p><p>Pa does the spell and I have lots whilst he finishes the story, this one about a brave dragon slayer defeating the bad dragon so the rest of the world could live in peace. It's a bit silly how Pa sometimes talks about the world as if it exists, because really, there's only me and him and Room.</p><p> </p><p>I'm only half asleep when he puts me in Wardrobe. I can't get properly asleep 'cause I don't want my birthday to end, so I stay awake when Door goes beep beep beep and They come in. I'm not supposed to do that.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes it's only one, today it's both. Old Tom and Red. I sit up and wait for them to talk. They always do before Pa does. Pa doesn't really talk to them much, and he never talks to me about them, he just says it's his business and changes the subject. I think it's because They're are only Half-real, not real real like me a Pa.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that birthday cake?" Red asks. I can't see Pa but he doesn't say anything. I think he nods.</p><p> </p><p>"Really? You should've told us, we would've got him something. How is he now, four?" Old Tom says, his voice much deeper than Red's.</p><p> </p><p>"Five." I whisper. Red doesn't hear me, just kicks off her trousers. Red and Old Tom both go over to Bed so I can't see them. I lay back down and count.</p><p> </p><p>Bed creaks once, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.</p><p> </p><p>  </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>There's Room, then Outer Space with all the TV planets. Plant is real but not trees. Spiders are real and one time the Mosquito that was sucking my blood, but Dogs and Squirrels and Dragons are just TV. Monsters are too big to be real, like the Sea. Old Tom and Red? I don't know if they're real. Maybe half. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><br/> Forty seven, forty eight, forty nine, fifty, fifty one -</p><p> </p><p>It's weird how I always wake up in Bed even when I go to sleep in Wardrobe.  I think Pa gets lonely in the night and so puts me in Bed with him. He has to wait until Old Tom and Red are gone because I don't think they're allowed to see me, 'cause it might make me unreal.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, why is it so cold?" I shiver when I get out of Bed to get breakfast. Even through my socks my feet are freezing. Pa passes me one of his jumpers, a woolly one that goes all the way down to my knees.</p><p> </p><p>"It's only January, Scorp. It's been colder, don't you remember?" I munch on my cornflakes, thinking.</p><p> </p><p>"Like when I got really sick and puked everywhere when I was three?"</p><p> </p><p>"Technically that was because we accidently ate mouldy food, but I guess you wouldn't remember, you were only one."</p><p> </p><p>"What happened?"</p><p> </p><p>"It was before we had the heater-" Pa nods at the heater, attached to the wall near Wardrobe. "It got so cold that the water wouldn't warm up properly, so I couldn't give you a bath. I had to keep you wrapped up in the blanket so you wouldn't freeze."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't remember that." I don't remember not having Heater, either. I thought it had always been here, like Pa. It only gets turned on at eleven to five, according to the numbers on Watch. They turn it off, from outer space, which is behind Door. I know it for sure because when it goes <em>beep beep beep</em> and They come in I can feel the cold come in.</p><p> </p><p>They turn Light off, too. They turn it off just before they come in, but They leave Lamp on so it's not really really dark until Pa turns it off.</p><p> </p><p>After Pa puts the breakfast bowls in Sink he gets out the tinfoil. I grin. We made a tinfoil boat and floated it in Toilet's top a bit of time ago. Pa said that when we had spare tinfoil we could make some more.</p><p> </p><p>With my bit I make a baby dragon with wings so it can fly near Light. I wanted to make a bigger dragon, a Pa dragon, but we don't have enough. Pa makes a small person with a longer bit of rolled-up tinfoil in his hand.</p><p> </p><p>"Is he holding a tinfoil roll?" I ask.</p><p> </p><p>"No, he's got a wand, a magic one. He's going to wave it and go on adventures through the ocean." He points to Toilet's top.</p><p> </p><p>"And with Baby Dragon! They're gonna burst out of Light and zoom through all of the TV planets!"</p><p> </p><p>I take Baby Dragon and Pa's person (Mini-Pa) and makes them <em>zoom zoom zoom</em> around Room while Pa makes lunch. We go all the way up to Light, and Mini-Pa whispers that it's not a good idea because we'll burn, so I hope down from Chair Number One and jump into Bath, getting Baby Dragon to cool down so he doesn't burn and go meltedy.</p><p> </p><p>Flat Knife goes <em>thup</em> as it hits Chopping Board. Chopping Board is green and very scratchy. Pa picks out the seeds for me - I hate it when I accidently swallow one, they get stuck in my throat, so instead we put them in the same pot as Plant, and one day they'll grow so much they'll touch the tippity top of Room. He hands me my half of the apple.</p><p> </p><p>Pa takes a bite from his half and gasps. He drops the apple on Counter and reaches with both hands inside his mouth. He pulls them out, covered in blood and holding something small. I squint.</p><p> </p><p>"Is it Bad Tooth?" I ask. Pa nods.  "Can I hold it?" I hold out my hand and Pa puts it in my palm. It's smaller than I thought it would be, it was a big ache so I thought it would be a big tooth. It's more bloodier, too.</p><p> </p><p>Pa leaves his half on Counter and washes his mouth out with Sink's water.</p><p> </p><p>"Why'd it come out?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa wipes his mouth on his sleeve. <em>I'm</em> not allowed to do that. Pa says it's dirty.</p><p> </p><p>"You know I told you about before you came?"</p><p> </p><p>"When you were lonely and walked around like a zombie?" Pa was sad before I came. He laid in bed all day and everyday and watched TV over and over, and didn't even make fun of the flat persons. A zombie is like a dead me or Pa, but it walks all floppy.</p><p> </p><p>Pa's nodding. "Yeah, and I forgot to brush my teeth, and I remembered when you came, but the damage had been done. That's why Bad Tooth fell out." I brush everyday after breakfast and before Wardrobe, so my teeth are clean clean clean!</p><p> </p><p>"So, mine won't fall out?"</p><p> </p><p>"Actually they will," He muses, "but your teeth are baby teeth, so they're supposed to come out. You have your adult teeth underneath."</p><p> </p><p>"How do I make them stick in my mouth?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa does the weird laugh that means I've said something funny without realising.</p><p> </p><p>"You can't. It'll probably be a while before they come out, anyway." I don't like the sound of probably.</p><p> </p><p>I finish my half before Pa. His face looks funny 'cause his cheek is like a hamsters 'cause he stuck Toilet's roll in his mouth to stop the blood.</p><p> </p><p>I put Baby Dragon in Toilet's top so she can drink some water, and then get Remote and turn on TV. I flick the 'Up' button, most of the pictures are fuzzy but then I get one that isn't. The pictures are of two man in a car and are darkish.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"The kids okay?" One asks.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I'm fine." I whisper.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Well, I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Kids get scared."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"No, I don't." I say back. I'm maybe lying just a little bit, but TV persons don't have to know that.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm?" Pa says from Counter. He looks at the TV. "What are you watching?" I shrug.</p><p> </p><p>"I dunno. But it's dark!" Pa makes an 'oh' noise and goes back to Counter to finish his half.</p><p> </p><p>Pa sits down next to me when he's finished, leaning against Bed, and I wriggle into his lap and get his arms to wrap around me. Pa always is warmer than me.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you figured out what it is yet?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nuh uh." I've never seen any flat persons like this before.</p><p> </p><p>"Ew!" I exclaim as a bloody, furry thing hits the see-through bit of the car the TV persons are in.</p><p> </p><p>Pa starts. "I'm not sure if this is appropriate-"</p><p> </p><p>"No! It is, I swear!" I've never never seen anything like this before, TV persons don't usually look like this. I don't want TV to go blank. "Please, Pa!" Pa sighs and I know he's giving in.</p><p> </p><p>"If it gives you nightmares it's your fault." He mutters.</p><p> </p><p>"What's a nightmare?"</p><p> </p><p>"A dream but scary."</p><p> </p><p>The only scary things I can think of are Old Tom and Red. Does it count as a nightmare if I'm awake? I'll have to ask Pa, except he might not answer because he doesn't like talking about Them.</p><p> </p><p>The film makes me jump a few times, and is almost scary but not really because it's flat and flat things aren't real, unless it's paper. Pa jumps at the same bits I do, so he can't say anything about me being scared.</p><p> </p><p>My legs are stiff when I get up so I jump on Bed a few times to make them feel okay again. It's a fuzzy kind of feeling, like when TV goes fuzzy but it's in my legs and they aren't flat.</p><p> </p><p>We get Quick Noodles for dinner. I get the biggest one, and I go <em>slurp</em> all down my throat until there's none left.</p><p> </p><p>Pa washes my hair and lets me splash, but we don't have any bubbles today and he says he's too tired for Mermen.</p><p> </p><p>I have more from the left when he tells me my story. He tells me about a boy that went to the magic school and found a snake down Toilet, and then learnt the snake's language to become his friend. It's a weird story.</p><p> </p><p>I'm asleep before I even get into Wardrobe.</p><p> </p><p>    </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pa walks around funny, but not a haha way, the next day. He's having a zombie day, where he walks all slowly, <em>thump thump</em>. It's like a Gone Day, except on Gone Day's Pa doesn't move from Bed.</p><p> </p><p>The tattoo arm with the bracelet looks purple. I want to ask why, but I don't like it when Pa is like a zombie. He either doesn't talk or talks all snappy. He only eats two spoonful's of his cornflakes before he pushes the bowl towards me.</p><p> </p><p>He pushes back Chair Number One and goes over to Counter, and just stands there, silently with his back to me.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa?" I say quietly. He puts his hand up to his mouth, and his shoulders start vibrating. I jump out of Chair Number Two and tug his sleep shirt.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa?" Without much warning he reaches down and lifts me off my feet. His arms crush me against his chest, but it's a nice type of crush, a warm one.</p><p> </p><p>"Is Bad Tooth still hurting, Pa, is it that?" I feel him nod against my shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh." I say. "Well, it won't always hurt, I guess? Like that time I smacked my head against table, the hurt went away after a bit."</p><p> </p><p>"You're amazing, you know that?" It sounds like he's laughing.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm Scorpius the dragon slayer, of course I'm amazing." Pa chuckles.</p><p> </p><p>Pa has a sleep a bit of hours later, and I'm not allowed the TV on today. Pa says his head is hurting again. He says it a lot and rubs his forehead a lot. I think that maybe Bad Tooth's hurt has gone and he's noticing other hurts now.</p><p> </p><p>I start picking a lose thread on Rug. Pa told me lots of times not to, but he's asleep so he won't know. I try to find the cobweb under Table but Mr Spider isn't there today. I haven't told Pa about him because he goes <em>SMACK</em> with his good hand and kills them dead. He says it's because they eat the food, but they're too small to really do anything.</p><p> </p><p>I hear a squeak and then look up from the thread.</p><p> </p><p>There's -</p><p> </p><p>There's a <em>mouse</em>.</p><p> </p><p>A real mouse. A <em>live</em> thing. In Room. I didn't know they really existed. I quietly reach up to get the cheese that Pa got last night and put a chunk on the floor. Mouse leans forwards and sniffs it and I think he's about to take a bite and then BAM!</p><p> </p><p>I jump and spin around to stare at Pa. Mouse is gone, a big book in her place. <em>Tales of Beedle the Bard</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"You killed him!" I yell using my loud voice. Pa gets on his hands and knees and reaches past Counter and into the hole where Mouse must've vanished. He doesn't deny it. I climb up onto Counter to get to his height when he straightens up.</p><p> </p><p>"Mouse was my friend, and you splattered him dead!" I yell in his ear. Pa doesn't look at me.</p><p> </p><p>"No I didn't." He grabs some tinfoil and rips a chunk off and shoves it behind Counter. "Mouse is safe and sound in the basement with his Pa. Get down off the counter, now."</p><p> </p><p>"What basement?" I ask, confused. I've never heard of a basement before. Pa doesn't hear me well and doesn't say anything back. He stands up and gets the cheese, taking Flat Knife and cutting the bit Mouse sniffed off. He puts it back in Fridge and slams Fridge's door shut so hard I can hear Juice rattle.</p><p> </p><p>"Or fine, don't get off. If you fall and hurt yourself then it's on your head!"</p><p> </p><p>"Why would I fall on my <em>head</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>"It's a figure of speech! I didn't mean it literally!" We're both yelling at each other now.</p><p> </p><p>"Then why did you say it?!" I shout, standing on Counter. I have to duck so I don't smack my head on Ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>"Because I <em>did</em>!" He roars.</p><p> </p><p>Before I can stop it I'm crying, louder than I was yelling.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Scorpius, I'm sorry," Pa scoops me off Counter and rocks me like a baby. He takes me over to Bed. We lay with our backs on Blanket and our legs stretching up Bed Wall. Pa does the spell and I have lots from the right while he strokes my hair.</p><p> </p><p>"Why didn't you tell Old Tom and Red about my birthday?" I ask after a bit of silence, after I'm done.</p><p> </p><p>"You're not supposed to me listening to that. You're supposed to be asleep." Pa says slowly. He doesn't sound mad, though, just tired.</p><p> </p><p>"They said they would get me a present. I never had a present." I remind him.</p><p> </p><p>"They weren't telling the truth, Scorp, they were saying it to be spiteful. That's what They do."</p><p> </p><p>"But what if. . ."</p><p> </p><p>Pa does that thing where he closes his eyes and doesn't say anything. I used to think it was because his battery was all used up and he needed to charge or get new ones, like the time the bulb in Lamp died and he had to ask Them for a new one. It takes him a long time to open them again.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa," I ask quietly. "when's your birthday?"</p><p> </p><p>"June fifth." He says.</p><p> </p><p>"And mine's the. . .?"</p><p> </p><p>"January thirteenth." He says tiredly. Pa measures lots and lots of time in weeks and months, and he names each month. I don't see the point, Room is the same every day and every night.</p><p> </p><p>"How old are you going to be?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa waits a minute. "Twenty-six." His voice sounds all cracked.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow." I've said the wrong thing but I don't know why. I never said happy birthday to Pa before. I didn't really think that he had a birthday. He never seems to get older or bigger, he is always the same as before, just Pa.</p><p> </p><p>Pa makes pasta for dinner. That's how Meltedy Spoon got her name - he left it too close to Pan while Stove was on fire. Pa still looks a bit like a zombie; his face is flat, like a TV person, but he isn't yelling. Maybe his hurt went away.</p><p> </p><p>We wash our clothes in Bath today. I have my spare jumper, my shorts and two pants, my top and my long, fluffy-inside trousers. Pa has his long sleeve top and his shorts, and three pants.</p><p> </p><p>"Sing." I say when he puts me down in Wardrobe.</p><p> </p><p>"One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fires were burning, down the track came a hobo hiking, and he said, "Boys, I'm not turning;  I'm headed for a land that's far away beside the crystal fountains so come with me, we'll go and see the big rock candy mountains. In the big rock candy mountains, there's a land that's fair and bright, where the hand-outs grow on bushes and you sleep out every night -" There's a thud outside Door and then the <em>beep beep beep</em>. Pa shuts the doors quickly.</p><p> </p><p>"Evening." Red says. It's just her today. Pa doesn't say anything back. She hands him a plastic bag.</p><p> </p><p>"I got you some of the stuff you asked for."</p><p> </p><p>I watch Pa through the slats, avoiding Red's face. Pa goes through it and puts things in different places. Red sits down in Chair Number One.</p><p> </p><p>"Not even an ounce of gratitude?" She snorts, like a pig.  "I mean, it's only us who provides you and the kid with food, water electricity. Just the basics." I think she's doing sarcasm but her voice is all nasty and I don't like it.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." Pa says in a whisper voice.</p><p> </p><p>"See, that was hardly difficult, was it?" Her voice sounds even nastier but I'm not sure why. "Oh, and speaking of the kid, I've got him something." She puts something on Table. I gasp inside Wardrobe.</p><p> </p><p>I don't do it quietly enough because Pa spins around to look at me and Red gets out of her chair and puts her face close to the slats. I lean away from them.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, hey Scorpius, how are you?" Pa's shaking his head a lot from behind her. I don't say anything.</p><p> </p><p>"He's supposed to be asleep." Pa says.</p><p> </p><p>"One late night is hardly going to hurt him." Red says dismissively. Her hand touches the slat. It starts to creak. I hold my breath. "Hey, Scorpius, do you want some sweets? I've a lollipop here," She puts something small and round on a stick near slats.</p><p> </p><p>"Come to bed," Pa says, going over to bed out of my view. "please." He adds.</p><p> </p><p>Red rolls her eyes and her face twists something mean, shoving her hand and the lollipop back into her pocket.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine, fine, blondie, if you're so worked up for it." She pulls off her top and then goes back up to Bed with Pa. I count up to one hundred and sixty eight creaks. I'm nearly asleep when I hear a thud and then it's all quiet.</p><p> </p><p>I wait, holding my breath so it doesn't wake Red up, and slowly push Wardrobe's doors open. They squeak and I wince, staying super still, but neither Pa nor Red move. I think they're both sleeping.</p><p> </p><p>I creep on my tiptoes over to Red's jacket - huh, it's red like her name- and reach into the inside pocket. I feel the stick and pull it out. I quietly climb back inside Wardrobe and close the doors.</p><p> </p><p>    </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When I wake up in Bed Pa isn't next to me, and Bed is cold, even with Blanket. I sit up and pull Blanket off me.</p><p> </p><p>Pa is sitting at on Chair Number One, rubbing his mouth. There's a weird greyish mark on his cheek. On Table next to him there's a see-through plastic box, the one Red put down last night. <em>A present.</em></p><p> </p><p>I leap out of Bed and put my hand on the plastic. "Can I open it?" I say as I begin tearing the box open, not waiting for an answer. Out of the corner of my eye I see Pa nod.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the plastic there's a car, a bit bigger than my foot. There's a remote control for it, a bit different to TV's remote, but it works in the same way sort of. I grin as I drive the car around room. It makes a really loud vroom noise like the racing cars on TV do. I ask Pa if he wants ago but he says no and makes breakfast instead.</p><p> <br/> After breakfast we do Scream. Pa's scream is always louder than mine, he says it's because he's bigger so his noise is bigger. I don't think he's truthing about that though, because Car is small but also really loud. My scream is a little bit smaller, but soon I'll be as big as Pa so I'll hopefully be louderer.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, why do the aliens never scream back?" I ask in a break. We scream to keep the bad things away. The monsters and aliens. I'm not sure if Old Tom and Red go into that category or not. Maybe, but they keep coming back, so maybe not.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess we haven't screamed loud enough." Pa's face seems weirdly sad. I think I've said the wrong thing again but I don't know what.</p><p> </p><p><br/> "We'll just have to scream even louderer!" I declare. Pa and me take a deep breath before screaming the loudest scream we've ever seen. But for some reason the aliens still don't answer back.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe they're just lost in outer space?" I guess.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe, I guess we'll just have to keep trying." Pa looks tired, so I do the rest of Scream alone, but they still don't scream back.</p><p> </p><p>After Scream Pa says I have to do Mathematics before I play with Car. Pa makes me go through all of my two times tables and then a bit of the threes. I don't get threes very well. Sometimes Pa gets out the big book of everything, called an encyclopaedia, and says random things and I have to guess what they are. Most of the time I've seen them on TV. It's nice that there's a book that says everything that's on TV, so then on a Gone Day I don't need to wake Pa up to ask a question.</p><p> </p><p>"If I'm five and your nearly twenty-six, does that make me almost five times smaller than you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sort of, fives don't really multiply that way. If I'm twenty five now and your five, how old was I when you were born?"</p><p> </p><p>"Twenty!"</p><p> </p><p>After Pa lets me finish with Mathematics I race Car around Room. I keep banging into Table so Pa helps me lift it onto Bed for a bit. After hours and hours I get tired of racing Car and so I put Table back in its correct place and lay on Bed. Car isn't as fast on Bed as it is on the floor. It keeps almost falling off, as well.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, it's electrocuting me now! Ahhh!" I roll around on Bed, mimicking being electrocuted. I saw someone get electrocuted on TV once.</p><p> </p><p>Pa looks up from what he's cooking. "Oh no." He says and then turns away.</p><p> </p><p>I accidently lean on the controller and Car jabs me in the tummy. "Ow, ow." I mumble. I sit up and smell something funny. Not ha-ha funny, but a bad kind of funny. I look at Pa. "Pa, what smells bad?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa glances at me then at the toaster, sticking his hands in and wincing when they get burned. He says a bad word that I'm not allowed to repeat. "Eww." I mumble. Room smells bad for the rest of the day.</p><p> </p><p>"It least it doesn't smell as bad as it did when I was sick." I say while eating my cheese on toast. Pa has the burnt piece. I don't think he really minds, he isn't eating that much of it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>"There are worse things." Pa says, tapping his bad wrist. I nod. Being sick made Room smell for <em>weeks</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Pa and me play mermen in Bath, like we did on my birthday. We end up staying the bath longer than usual because the numbers on Watch are smaller than they usually are which means we have more minutes before They come. Pa says that they come later on Monday's so it would've been fine anyway. That's another one of his weird names for time.</p><p> </p><p>Because we have so much time we decide to make Eggsnake grow using the eggs from my birthday. TV is showing a grainy picture because the signal isn't very good today. Neither of us actually watch it, it's just noise in the background.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, where do we go when we're asleep?"</p><p> </p><p>"Right here in Room."</p><p> </p><p>"But dreams; do we go into TV for dreaming?" My eyes flick to the grainy picture and then back at Pa's face.</p><p> </p><p>"We're never anywhere but here." Pa squints as he pushes the needle through one of Eggsnake's shells.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you have a nightmare if you're awake?" I ask. Pa shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess things can feel like a nightmare, but not really, no."</p><p> </p><p>I guess Old Tom and Red aren't nightmares, then. Besides, They bring us Sundaytreat so how bad can They be?</p><p> </p><p>We put Eggsnake under Bed when we're done. Eggsnake does a lot of hibernating. Pa lifts up his top and does the spell. I have lots from the right. Pa tells me another story, tonight from Tales of Beedle the Bard.</p><p> </p><p>I'm wide awake when Door goes <em>beep beep beep</em>. It's just Old Tom today. He has a bag that he hands to Pa too.</p><p> </p><p>"What's that smell?" Old Tom asks.</p><p> </p><p>"I burnt some cheese earlier. Sorry, I just wasn't thinking." Pa does the same thing he does with Red; turns away and puts the things Old Tom brought in from space away in Fridge or Shelf.</p><p> </p><p>Old Tom laughs cruelly. "Thinking isn't your strong point."</p><p> </p><p>Pa makes a small noise back and I'm not sure if he's agreeing or not. I hope he's not; Pa is the bestest thinker ever.</p><p> </p><p>"The vitamins?" He asks suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>Old Tom does a sigh and a nodding thing. I think it's sarcasm but silent. "There's nothing in them."</p><p> </p><p>Pa sighs. "Maybe if we had a better diet." He mutters, except not really because I can hear him.</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck, here we go again. Maybe if you could stop complaining, and be a little grateful for what you have."</p><p> </p><p>Pa goes all stiff over the counter. "Thank you... for everything." He says in a whisper voice, quickly turning around and then looking away again.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, and what do you go and do? Raise a goddamn kleptomaniac." I don't know what that means, but he sounds so <em>angry</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Pa's voice is quieter than a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>"See!" Old Tom waggles his finger at Pa. "You can't even control the little shite. Ruby offered him something but he politely declined, and guess what was missing this afternoon?"</p><p> </p><p>Who's <em>Ruby</em>? And what is he-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Oh</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The <em>lollipop</em>! I reach under Wardrobe's pillow and pull it out, still in its wrapper. Maybe if I gave it back he wouldn't be so mad. . .</p><p> </p><p>"So I think it's time the little shite learned a lesson." Old Tom stands suddenly and Pa jumps. He turns and stares straight at me. I want to hide under Blanket, but I can't move.</p><p> </p><p>"No! Not him, you have me!" Pa says in a wobbly, almost shouty voice. Old Tom takes another step towards me, almost reaching Wardrobe's doors.</p><p> </p><p>"No!" Pa yells. He pushes Old Tom away from Wardrobe and stands in front of it, blocking my view.</p><p> </p><p>"The fuck did you just-!" Old Tom roars. I gasp, but they don't hear me because Old Tom grabs Pa and throws him from in front of Wardrobe.</p><p> </p><p>There's a thud, and then another and then Bed starts creaking, faster and louder than it ever has before. Someone makes a choking sound.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to fucking breathe?" Old Tom yells.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't - Touch. . ." Pa voice sounds all croaky and scratchy and horrible and painful.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you wanna breathe?!" Old Tom yells.</p><p> </p><p>Someone makes a weird noise. I think it's Pa; it has to be because Old Tom is still yelling.</p><p> </p><p>"Then shut the fuck up!"</p><p> </p><p>Someone takes in a huge breath. "Don't touch him, don't touch him!" Pa repeats.</p><p> </p><p>"Ever grab me like that, I'll fucking kill you. And your brat."</p><p> </p><p>"Don't touch him!" Pa's voice sounds all horrible and raspy and <em>it's all my fault</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Why don't you think about how you got him?" I don't know what Old Tom means by that, but then Door goes beep beep beep and he's gone.</p><p> </p><p>"Scorp? Scorpius?" Pa croaks.</p><p> </p><p>I run out of Wardrobe and onto Bed, Pa wraps his arms around me and holds me close. Lamp is on and Pa's eyes are red and his neck has dark patches and his pants are at his knees. He yanks them up with one arm and holds me tightly with the other.</p><p> </p><p>Pa rocks me back and forth and suddenly Room goes black. I gasp in Pa's arms.</p><p> </p><p>"Pa, what's happening?" I hear him say a bad word.</p><p> </p><p>"They. . . I think They cut the power." Pa gets out of Bed and I hear Wardrobe open. He gets out my warm clothes and we both put them on. I hear a thud and freeze, thinking it's Them, but it's just Pa trying to open Door. Dumbo Pa. We can't open Door, only They can. "What do we do?"</p><p> </p><p>Pa slides into Bed next to be, pulling me close again. I wrap my arms and legs around him and press my face into his hair. "Just sleep, Scorp." I don't want to sleep but I'm tired and -</p>
