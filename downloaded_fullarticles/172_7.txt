  <b>1995: Summer Before Year 5</b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>16 Heathgate, London 10:42 am</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Why can't anyone do anything right?" Hermione’s stepfather yelled. He had just gotten home from work, and it sounded as though he had stopped by the pub beforehand. She was sitting at the kitchenette with her Charms book open, conveniently charmed to look like a spiritual guide for muggle witchcraft.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You!” he said with disgust seeing her sitting there. “All you do is sit there and read your stupid books, go to school some secret place up north for most of the year and do NOTHING for this household! NOTHING!” He shouted. "Get out! And take your freakish pagan religious crap with you!" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After Hermione's mother had married this buffoon of a man, John, Hermione and her mum mutually decided it best to keep her magic a secret from him after a drunken rant one night about the pagan teenagers he had seen earlier that day “spewing nonsense” about spells and spell work.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been a year and a half since the accident that took Hermione's father away. It was something that she tried hard not to think about when she was home for the holidays. This summer had been the hardest, even with the therapy sessions her mother had set up for her. As the wizarding world’s war  leaked into the muggle world, she was starting to understand the fear that had been prevalent during the first reign of Voldemort and knew she was only beginning to understand the terror that washed over the magical people during Grindelwald's war. Being a part of the Golden Trio, death was sure to follow, and even if the attack on muggle London was by chance, it wouldn't be the last time someone she knew would die.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One thing was for sure: Hermione knew her self worth and to be talked to in such a way by someone who was basically a stranger was unacceptable. She had a life changing choice to make.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>John made his way into the kitchen still glaring at her, rummaging in the overhead cabinet doors looking for a glass and slammed it shut with a look of such loathing that made Malfoy look like a besotted schoolboy. . .</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>BANG!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>-----Flashback-----</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hendon Central Shopping District </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione and her Dad were taking a stroll down the shopping district, it was the one day of the summer hols that she adored the most. The weather felt nice and a subtle breeze kept the heat away. Many children and adults alike meandered to and fro on the sidewalks, stopping occasionally to browse  through a shop window.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>CRASH!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were yellow and purple curses flying everywhere. Building faces were being blown inwards. People were running and screaming. Wizards in dark robes were appearing and disappearing just as quickly as the spells left their wands. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>What's happening? Are those spells?’</span>
  </em>
  <span> In a panic Hermione searched for her wand in her pocket</span>
  <em>
    <span>, “Of course, I left it at home, I just wanted one non-magical day with my dad, but to have left my wand at home of all places! How stupid of me!’ </span>
  </em>
  <span> She heard her dad yell out: “Hermione watch out!”  He had pushed her out of the way as the building next to them came crumbling down. Hermione watched in horror as rubble and debris came down onto him just where they both were standing seconds ago.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"NO!" She screamed, quickly turning back to where her dad had disappeared under the large chunks. Doing her best to heave as much rubble off of him as possible, she was able to find his face and cleared off just enough for his right arm to move as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her father's face was covered in a light grey soot, blood running freely from his nose and mouth "Daddy," She started weakly. Tears pooling and clouding her vision, she knew that she was not strong enough to get the rest of the concrete chunks off of him. "I love you." In afew seconds, she was sobbing, "I'm sorry,” she hiccuped, “ I'm so sorry, daddy. This was supposed to be a normal day.” She reached for his hand, grasping it tightly, willing him to stay with her, willing this to be a nightmare so that she could wake up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m so stupid; I should have brought my wand with me. I would be able to take this off of you and heal you, but I’m stuck, and I don’t know what I am supposed to do. What should I do; what should I do?” She felt the panic rising in the pit of her belly. “I should have brought my wand; Merlin I’m so stupid. I'm so sorry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>An ache started developing in Hermione’s chest; the regret for her carelessness became overwhelming and she could vaguely hear sirens getting closer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sweetie, this ...” He grimaced. “This isn’t your fault. You … you didn’t know this was going to happen,” He coughed, fresh blood appearing around his mouth . “Tell your mum that I love her, will you, pumpkin?” His breath became increasingly laboured.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I promise,” Hermione said weakly, squeezing his hand harder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And know this, Princess ... I love you too. And I am so proud of the woman you are becoming. Keep that strong head on your shoulders,” He started, coughing more violently. “Keep that strong head on your shoulders and nothing will be able to stop you.” He squeezed her hand, and struggled to breathe . “You will do great things Hermione…” And with his final words, Daniel Granger departed the mortal plane </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was gone. Gone from this world, but most importantly- her. He was gone forever, and she couldn't help but scream in agony, frustration, and anger.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione understood  he wouldn't move again, no matter how much she begged for a sign of life. She closed her eyes and stood up, fists clenched so tightly that her knuckles were white. Getting her bearings, she could see the lights from the emergency response units, and survey the extent of the destruction around her. Bodies littered the ground, young and old alike; smoke rose from buildings and rubble covered the sidewalk and streets. She ran towards the middle of the street and flagged down the closest available ambulance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They quickly got out and pulled the rubble off of her dad. They confirmed what she already knew; he was dead. One of the paramedics came up to her and gave her a once over. Asked standard questions: Did she know this man, what had she seen? Once the paramedic examined Hermione’s injuries and declared them minor scratches, she suggested something else that Hermione only partially heard. The paramedic must have seen the far away look and asked the police officer to drop her back home, but not before slipping a note into her hand, addressed to her mom about the potential need for a psychiatric follow-up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>-----End Flashback-----</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ever since that day, loud noises triggered Hermione and  would throw her back in time. From the reading that she had done, and the therapy sessions that she attended to please her mum, it was normal for a traumatic experience to have a lasting effect.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Fine then, John," She said bitterly. He hated it when Hermione called him that. He had always tried to get her to call him dad, but he could never and would never earn that title. "I guess I'll just go and pack. Wouldn’t want to leave you with any cursed items to cause you more problems,” she slammed her charms book shut and quickly made her way up to her room and started packing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once there she took in everything to hold as a keepsake memory, not knowing if she would ever be able to come back, and if she did, would her room still be here. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her four posted pine-framed bed centered the furthest wall from the door, adjoined with two matching nightstands that were decorated with stilled photos of her time at Hogwarts, courtesy of Colin Creevy. Her trunk lay undisturbed at the foot of her bed with a throw blanket across the top. She had a medium-sized dresser on the right wall whilst her closet was built into the left wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a spacious room, enough so that two windows were placed on the wall the bed was aligned with. Her bookcase full to the brim had more books stacked neatly beside it on both sides. Her walls were painted a pastel peach, and the crown trim was a semi-gloss white. These were some of the decoratives that hadn’t been changed since she left for Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had muggle boy band posters along her wall in some places whilst also a banner of the Chinese new years, a large circular poster of the horoscope and a general puppy poster dated from 1991 with a large red circle around the 1st day of September.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione made up her mind, and wrote a note to her mum explaining what happened, and attempting to reassure her that she would be ok.</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Mum, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> want you to know that I love you and that I always will. I'm so sorry that I couldn't save daddy. While you have never said anything outright, I know what your eyes and actions say … you blame me for my inability to save him. And you are right. My magical abilities should have been enough, but I wasn't prepared and didn't have my wand. I will regret this decision for the rest of my life.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I want you to have the opportunity to buil</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>d a new life with John. Neither of you need the reminder of the life you had before, so I'm doing my part and leaving so that you can forget about the pain I've caused and focus on your new happiness. Eventually I was going to have to choose between a life with you, here in the muggle world, or a life apart from you in the Wizarding World. I guess this decision is just happening earlier than either of us had expected.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I'll always remember the happy times we had as a family. I love you and always will. Please try to forgive me for the pain I have caused you, and know that I am truly wishing for nothing but your happiness.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Eternally your daughter,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Hermione</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once she finished packing, Hermione exited her childhood home, placed her note into her mom's book laying on her nightstand. Fighting tears that threatened to fall, Hermione quickly made her way outside and walked to the corner of her street. Looking around to make sure no one was nearby,  she lifted her wand above her head and summoned the Knight Bus. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>4 Privet Drive, Surrey 9:00 am</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh, Harry looked around his disorganized room. It had been exactly a month and a day since the end of term. His uncle and aunt had been working him like a house elf since the moment he returned, so much so that keeping his ‘room’ clean and put together became an extra chore in and of itself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With another, smaller sigh because Harry knew that his room would not clean itself, he got started.  He divided his clothes into two piles, dirty and clean, and then opened the wardrobe that his aunt had given him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been collecting dust in a back corner of the attic for years, and when Vernon had contracted a team to clean out the cluttered space, they had asked what he wanted to do with the ugly monstrosity. His uncle had told them to treat it like all the other unwanted junk, but Petunia had convinced Vernon otherwise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had insisted that, in her words ”If that freak has to stay under our roof, he can use that thing to keep his room clean. I’ll not have him behaving like a slob in our home.” Vernon had quickly agreed with his wife and Harry had gained the first piece of </span>
  <em>
    <span>new </span>
  </em>
  <span>furniture in his life at the Dursleys.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he tossed in his clean clothes, making a mental note to hang them properly the next day, Harry heard a thunk, as if something heavy had shifted upon landing. After a slight hesitation, he knelt and shoved his clothes over to one side. There he saw that a panel had moved over just enough to reveal a dim light shining on the far side, almost as if it were a laundry chute connecting to the lower level of the house. Unsure if he had missed it during his exploratory search of the wardrobe beforehand, Harry quickly got back on his feet and shifted the wardrobe enough to peek behind it. There he saw no shifted panel and no previously obscured laundry chute.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Going back to the front of the wardrobe, Harry leaned in toward the shifted panel and attempted to adjust it so the opening was larger. He cautiously inserted his hand and wiggled his fingers. When he couldn’t feel his hand touching anything, he poked a hanger through the space and ran around to check the back of the wardrobe once more. The hole did not continue through the back of the wardrobe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well...” Harry said out loud to himself. “It can’t be any worse than the Chamber right?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> And with that, he shoved the board over more until it gave him just enough room to slip his body through. With one last moment of hesitation, he pushed himself off and into the wardrobe where a slide appeared, hoping for the best.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A wide space opened around Harry as he whisked from the chute and he found himself dropping heavily from a few feet up the wall where the opening led back to the room above. Looking about, Harry was in awe. The small gap opened to a large room that easily could compare to the Hogwarts Great Hall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wall to his right caught his interest first. It was staged to be a training area with the walls lined with weapons, many of which weren’t from Britain.  Immediately to his right, he first noted the large blue mat with a white circle in the middle that made a small arena. The wall closest to this had many different wooden sticks ranging in size with different length and thickness.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Walking over he grabbed one that was only slightly longer than his own arm and no thicker than a Beater’s bat’s handle. Releasing it from its mount, he found it to be a lot heavier than he had anticipated. Walking to the center of the mat, he took a couple of good swings around. He felt awkward and clumsy with it and the weight of the stick made his arm and shoulder ache. Deciding that it would be best to put it back before he hurt himself, he had also made the quick decision that he would not be doing that again anytime soon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry then moved over to the next area, where he found a display case that was sitting before the wall. In this display case, his eye caught an infantry helmet. Upon closer inspection, he found a grenade sitting undisturbed next to the helmet and quickly backed away from the table for good measure.  Looking at the wall behind this display, Harry was able to name only a few of the many weapons that were displayed across the wall. Without getting any closer, he could spot a few different types of pistols, and a few different types of rifles. Knowing his luck, he kept his distance and did not investigate anymore in this section. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>On the furthest and final part of the wall’s strange assortment of weapons, he was greeted by yet another set of blue mats. This time though, in the center, a wooden dummy was in its place. The walls that surrounded this mat were lined with different types of swords. Harry walked over to the one that most resembled the Sword of Gryffindor that he had once wielded in his second year. Reading the placard it said:</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span> Tantō</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Japanese</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Heian period 749 CE</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He moved over to the next sword, this one longer and had a diamond shaped pattern on its hilt. Harry read the placard:</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Katana</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Japanese</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Muromachi period 1392 CE</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘What is all of this?’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry asked himself, looking at another placard and read the name and found the origin to be Chinese. Glancing at another, he read that it was from the Middle East. Feeling a bit overwhelmed about this collection he turned around to inspect the rest of the room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wall that now faced his right contained many paintings, some had very clear photos and others it looked like they were just a bunch of paint strokes that had to be stared at to figure out what they were. Each one of them also had placards beneath them, this time with names that he was unfamiliar with and what he presumed were the paintings name.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was another display case that he approached wearily, hoping that it wouldn’t contain any other objects that made him uneasy. He had found that it was full of different types of jewelry, each of which also had tiny cards accompanying them. Harry was not one who cared very much for jewelry and continued his self guided tour. Last on his exploration came a very long range of bookcases that led him right back to the chute.  He had passed a comfy looking couch, a small display case with nothing in it and a night stand with a tome placed on it as if lay forgotten by whomever had created this place to begin with. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry walked back down the side of the bookshelves and noticed that some of the books looked rare. "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Something Hermione would be able to tell," </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought. Some names of the books were very familiar to his school course work. Other books, however, were a lot more complex and specific on the content. He was extra weary of the books without a name, as he didn't need another fright from when he was younger and ventured into the Restricted Section at school.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One thing for sure that Harry had noticed was that no matter where he stood in the room, there never seemed to be a shadow from the light. He couldn't find the source specifically, but when he looked up it felt as if he had taken to looking at the sun directly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not knowing how long he had spent down in this secret room, Harry started to panic about being gone for too long and rushed to find a way back up. Seeing a rope with knots, he realized that he would need to climb to the chute to get out. Harry climbed up the rope with some difficulty, muttering to himself that he needed to find an easier way next time, and pulled himself through the chute and back to his room where he was just in time to hear the doorbell ring.</span>
