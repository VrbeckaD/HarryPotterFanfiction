    <p> </p><p> </p><p><u>Chapter 1</u><br/> <strong>Finding Me In The Dark</strong></p><p>                Tina hadn’t officially returned here since her trouble over saving Credence. She’d been forbid from going near the Second Salemers, and that meant this church, too. Especially the church.<br/> So she had yet to see the damage left by poor Credence and his Obscurial. No, she didn’t go near it against until her restrictions were cleared and her place on the Investigative Team reinstated. And she honestly wouldn’t have considered going back to it, if it hadn’t been for Newt.<br/> He was escorted to the docks by Tina, only to turn on her and reveal what he witnessed, what MACUSA couldn’t know.<br/> Credence was alive.<br/> Now, of course, at first she was doubtful and completely against hoping. But Newt told her, he’d seen the slither of Obscurial escape, and that meant one of two things…either an Obscurial was still loose on New York and needed to be caught, or it was what was left of Credence, and it had escaped to find a safe place to regain strength. And Newt, either in knowledge or hope or both, believed the latter.<br/> And so he begged to stay, to help.</p><p>“I still want to save the boy, Tina.” He had told her.</p><p>So did she.</p><p>And so they set off to find where he might be hiding away. Newt said he would probably seek out somewhere he believed secure or safe. And Tina, for the life of her, couldn’t think of any place Credence could possibly view as safe or secure. The only place that was perhaps secure was his home at the church, but that surely never felt safe. But something in her told her to search there, whether it be belief that he simply had nowhere else to go, or just intuition.</p><p>When they arrived on the front steps, Newt and Tina looked over the damage. It was still in absolute ruins. Some small items of remembrance were left, but apart from that, it was left in its destruction.<br/> “MACUSA hasn’t fixed this yet? What will the Obliviated Muggles think?” Newt questioned as they took careful steps traversing inside.<br/> “They think it was a freak accident.” Tina began explaining, careful of her steps as she looked about at the wreckage. “Mary Lou’s supporters cry that the Witches are to blame, while non-believers think it was some crazy explosion.” She caught Newt’s gaze, who was more daring as he traversed the rubble. “With Mary Lou and her oldest daughter dead, it seemed best to make it seems as if they died in a freak accident…”<br/> Tina’s heart was heavy. She saw the broken balcony, spotted Credence’s belt hanging from the banester. She looked over all the damage against the walls, the stairs, the pews. She tried not to wonder what damage was reactional and what was emotional.<br/> Newt had made his way to the ruins of the stairs, considering Apperating but unsure of how stable it was up there. “Do you think…?” he started, only to look to Tina and catch her shaking her head as she looked elsewhere.<br/> Her heart ached as she heard distant but familiar shudders of breath outside, yet close by. “…Out on the corner.” She told Newt in a rushed release of breath, and she hurried back outside, round the ruined churches structure to the corner ally that had the Second Salemer posters stuck upon them.<br/> In a dark corner, curled up against the broken wood of the churches east wall, he sat. He sat, shaking, shuddering and whimpering. The darkness around him seemed to shift and as Tina stepped slowly closer, she saw wisps of darkness gliding over strange wounds; wounds she could only think came from the Auror’s attacks.<br/> Tears stinging in her eyes at the knowledge of all the pain he’d suffered, Tina stepped slowly and carefully closer, hearing careful footsteps behind her as well. She slowed her progress when Newt stood beside her, only for them to both stop when the young man inclined his head in their direction.<br/> Pursing her lips, Tina took a moment before speaking up, hands up as a sign of reassurance. “Credence…it’s okay… We’re here. We’re here to help you.”<br/> “You’re safe, now, Credence.” Newt added.<br/> Credence looked up at them completely then, eyes red and raw as he hugged his knees, shaking. His face contorted with emotion and a struggle to speak before the words finally came, and they came out scared and desperate and pleading.<br/> “…P-please…. Please, help me…”<br/> When he was then reduced to tears and sobs, the other two closed in carefully and securely, ending up on either side of him as the darkness around him faded away.<br/> “Credence, it’s alright—It will be alright.” Tina spoke softly, quietly, and she knelt down beside him.<br/> Once she was close enough, he took the invitation that was her outstretched hand and arms and leaned into her, grasping her jacket and becoming nothing but a shaking bundle of sobs, tears, and whimpers. And Tina didn’t hesitate to wrap her arms around him. She found herself muttering what felt like useless reassurances in a soft tone. It was all she could do to keep her own emotions in check, only she could do to satisfy the need to somehow soothe the young man in her arms.<br/> Newt reached a careful hand which he placed half on Tina’s hand and half on Credence’s shoulder. When he spoke, it was soft and careful as well. “Credence… We’re going to take you somewhere safe, where you’ll be alright…”</p><p>Neither of them had planned beyond this point, so of course they surely hadn’t planned anything for the far future. All they knew was they had to help Credence, and that’s what they were going to do.</p><p>And to begin with, it was hectic; Tina back on her job, she tended to get more busy than she liked. Newt could barely manage to leave the apartment or his suitcase, what with Magical Law Enforcement thinking he’d gone back across the water already, back to the M.O.M. and out of their lives and no longer a problem. On top of that, the unthinkable happened about two weeks after they brought Credence back to the apartment; Queenie brought home Jacob (or, well, snuck him), and not simply him, but Jacob Kawolski—memories returned!<br/> Each of the household had been in a buzz; Queenie confessing her visits, Tina worried but happy, and Newt silently proud. It took a while until they finally tried to pull it out of him. He started talking about the poison and its potential, and assuring a questioning Tina that he wasn’t even sure it was entirely fault of the poisons Obliviative properties failing (he’d have to study Jacob), but it was Jacob who stated the loop-hole he’d fathered to be the answer that saved him his memories. “Newt here, he told me it could get rid of bad memories, that poison stuff from the Swooping thing…but not a one of my memories with you guys was bad enough! Not the wizard police, or that jerk Graves or Grindle-what-you-call-him, or even the Erumper-whatever chasing after me! I’ve never been happier than with you guys…”</p><p>And with an obvious promise of secrecy, adjustment to the increased number of guests/visitors/occupants of the household, all of their new lives were set in motion. As whether they knew it or not then, they all had begun something together. Tina, Newt, Queenie, Jacob, and Credence.<br/> Whether they knew it or not, what they had begun was a family.</p>
