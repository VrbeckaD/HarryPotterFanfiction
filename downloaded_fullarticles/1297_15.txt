<li><span>He’s touch starved and loves hugs even though he says he doesn’t. He says he can teleport away whenever someone hugs him but he never does and smiles softly. </span></li>
<li><span>He talks to a therapist - Vanya suggested it after they stopped the apocalypse, he was stubborn at first demanding that he didn’t need help and he was fine but after he had a panic attack in the middle of the night Vanya insisted that he go see her therapist.</span></li>
<li><span>He still gets panic attacks every so often </span></li>
<li><span>Vanya and Ben help him most of the time </span></li>
<li><span>Klaus helps sometimes too</span></li>
<li><span>The rarest person to help him is Allison</span></li>
<li><span>He doesn’t like to wear extravagant clothing but he dyes his hair red and paints his nails. He gets Klaus to do his left hand</span></li>
<li><span>He’s perfectly capable of doing it himself he just wants to spend time with his brother which he would never admit to</span></li>
<li><span>Gets super offended when someone says anything transphobic and has to be restrained from killing someone. Not only is it in defense of Klaus (Non-Binary) and Diego (trans) but him - he came out as trans right before he left so he spent most of his time with crippling dysphoria until the commission who gave him immediate surgery and hormone therapy it was all very quick so that they could put him to work quickly. When he returns to the umbrella academy everything has been undone, he doesn’t have time to think about it because of the impending apocalypse but once they stop it Grace and his siblings immediately help him with his transition (Diego helps the most)</span></li>
<li><span>Him and Diego often rant to each other about the difficulties of being trans </span></li>
<li><span>Sometimes Klaus joins in</span></li>
<li><span>He’s allergic to a few things bees, wasps, cherries, cats, almonds, peanuts, and bananas</span></li>

<li><span>He’s an emo at heart</span></li>
<li><span>But he really loves Billie Eilish</span></li>
<li><span>He plays piano and used to play with Vanya when they were kids</span></li>

<li>
<span>After stopping the apocalypse he redecorated his room. He’s thirteen years old and he’s not going to be aging up any time soon so he wants to be a teenager since he never go to (e</span><span>ven though he has a 50 year old mind he doesn’t want to age up his body, he missed out on his childhood so he wants to get to be a teenager even if it sucks)</span>
</li>
<li><span>He hasn’t had his first kiss when he gets back from the apocalypse</span></li>
<li><span>He hasn’t even dated anyone</span></li>
<li><span>He ends up finding out he’s ace and panromantic</span></li>
<li><span>He misses Delores but he understands that he has to move on from her </span></li>
<li><span>He goes and visits her every so often and tells her how he’s doing</span></li>
<li><span>Most people give him weird looks but the employees at the shop make sure they kick out anyone who tries to harass him</span></li>
<li><span>He ends up going back to school</span></li>
<li><span>But because of his advanced intellect he would have been able to go through highschool and college quicker but he wanted some normalcy after the apocalypse so he went through high school normally and got a scholarship for college</span></li>
