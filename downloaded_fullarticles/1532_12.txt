    <p>To say that he was nervous was an understatement as Remus watched people his own age and older pass him to get to the Hogwarts Express. He was used to being alone if he was entirely honest. Growing up moving constantly because of his <em>illness</em> kind of made it impossible to have friends. His social skills weren’t what they should’ve been at eleven years old. According to his mother he was too sarcastic for his own good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking into a compartment and smiling at a heftier looking boy as he opened the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do you mind if I sit with you?” Remus asked, as the boy looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Y—Yeah sure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus moved to sit down as the other boy shifted in his seat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Peter Pettigrew.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus took the offered hand hesitantly; he always felt nervous about touching anyone. While his parents tried to shower him with affection he didn’t like being touched by them. He’d always felt like he’d ruined their lives because of his illness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus Lupin, nice to meet you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You too.” Peter said, finally smiling at him, “So what house do you hope to get in?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus honestly hadn’t thought about what house he’d be sorted into. His father had been a Ravenclaw but hadn’t really spoken about Hogwarts much until the last few weeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My father was in Ravenclaw but I’d be okay with any house.” Remus told him, shrugging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Even Slytherin?” Peter asked, paling just a little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father had told him enough about Hogwarts to know the reputations each of the houses had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s statistically impossible for every person in Slytherin to be bad.” Remus explained, “Honestly I’d love to be in Gryffindor but I think I’ll be put in Ravenclaw.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because you’re so smart?” Peter joked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus laughed softly with the boy, “I think my father would be overjoyed. What about you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My cousin Enid thinks I’ll be a Hufflepuff for sure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well there’s nothing wrong with that.” Remus said honestly, “At least we’re lucky enough to go to Hogwarts, right?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right!” Peter agreed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus stopped speaking when someone else knocked on the door. A red head by the name of Marlene McKinnon joined them. She sparked up a new subject about Quidditch that had Peter enthralled. Remus watched them as he ran his hand through his tawny brown hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s your favorite Quidditch team, Remus?” Peter asked, smiling kindly at the boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus opened and shut his mouth; thinking for a moment about being included before he shrugged again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Probably the Caerphilly Catapults.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not the Holyhead Harpies?” Peter asked, “That’s interesting.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Harpies are great but the Catapults have a stronger team.” Remus explained as Marlene smiled at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They do!” she exclaimed, turning to Peter as they continued their talk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only reason he knew about the Catapults and Harpies is because his father had actually taken him to two games while they’d still been in Wales. It had been the best memories he’d had in his life. Both paling to when Dumbledore came and told him he could attend Hogwarts over a game of Gobstones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After thinking for years he wouldn’t be able to and then being told he could. Well it filled him with a happiness he wasn’t used to feeling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They’d been traveling for some time when another red head knocked and opened the door with a black haired male behind her. She smiled at them hesitantly before she cleared her throat gently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do you guys mind if we join you?” she asked, “I’m Lily Evans and this is Severus Snape.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The black haired boy just looked at all of them curiously as Marlene made room on the other side of her. Lily taking that spot while Severus took the space next to Remus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The smaller male just looked to the floor. There was too many people in the compartment and it was making him feel a little uncomfortable. Especially when the two red heads started talking about subjects they were excited about at school. Severus chiming in every once in a while quietly while Peter disagreed with taking Potions and Transfiguration loudly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So did you guys make it on the train late?” Marlene asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lily laughed gently, “More like we were sitting with two ignorant toerags who don’t understand proper manners.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Isn’t that a little harsh?” Remus asked, wincing when the black haired male’s gaze fell on him, “We’ve only been on the train for a little while. You can’t judge people that quickly. There’s um...nerves and fear working against them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The red head regarded him carefully before she licked her lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They were being unnecessarily cruel to Severus because he wants to be sorted into Slytherin.” Lily told them, “As if being in Slytherin automatically makes him evil.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“While I agree with you on that, you also can’t consider them ignorant toerags because of their feelings towards that house. People are allowed to feel however they want without people making them feel bad about it.” Remus said softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“True as that may be they don’t get to call me names.” the black haired male said, “Or are you justifying bullying?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’d like to say I’d never justify bullying.” Remus said, lowering his eyes to the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Given his own childhood and how many people had called him a freak...well he knew all about that subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let’s change the subject.” Peter interjected, looking at the boy’s lowered head, “We still have a few hours left, let’s try to spend it in harmony.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Peter’s right.” Marlene agreed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus tuned them out then. He hated feeling like he didn’t belong and while his parents had assured him he’d be fine he still felt the same way he always had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like an outcast on the outside looking in. He’d grown up seeing kids playing together outside and never being able to do so himself. It made him want to scream and cry when he was younger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now he was used to the silence. He filled his time with studying and reading. Books were one of the only ways he was able to escape the hell he called his childhood. While he loved his parents dearly he hated not being able to talk with anyone his own age. Not being able to tell people about why he was a ‘freak.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus had already put on his robes by the time the others had started to. Leaving to go to the loo and coming back dressed. His parents had drilled the importance of either going in his robes or changing in the bathroom. No one could know of his secret. He knew the consequences if someone did. He’d be singled out and he knew it wouldn’t be long before he’d have to leave the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watching the sun set and the moon rise as he watched them finally come into a station. Following Peter out and sticking with the boy who kept smiling at him. Walking right next to him as they made their way after a giant male that told them all to call him Hagrid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You okay, Remus?” Peter asked kindly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am, thanks Peter.” Remus said gratefully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hope whatever house we get sorted into that we can be friends. I could use some.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus’ smile became more genuine as he nodded his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I could use a friend too.” Remus told him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Climbing into a boat with Marlene and a lad named Frank Longbottom. Making their way to the castle as Remus finally set his eyes on it. It was as magical as his father had claimed it was. The soft candle light casting an ethereal glow to the castle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He exchanged a look with Peter who looked like he was completely entranced by it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The water was black in the moonlight; shimmering as they made their way closer to the school. Remus never thought he’d actually see this place in person. The times his father spoke about it were so few and far in between but Remus could always tell this place held some of the best memories of his father’s life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Coming to the other side as their boats slowly came to a stop. Remus helped Peter out as the two boys kept close; noticing a red haired girl and a black haired boy getting towards the front of the small crowd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus running into someone and falling as he felt Peter try and fail to stabilize him. Hearing someone</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus looked up into gray eyes that were almost silver. Seeing a smile cross the boy’s face as he offered his hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus, are you okay?” Peter asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Remus said, taking the hand and being helped up, “It’s fine, I wasn’t looking.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The boy was pulled by a dark haired male with glasses before he could say anything else. Remus watched the boy look back at him with a smile. Following them with Peter as they went into the castle and up the stairs. Seeing a woman in green robes look at them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Welcome to Hogwarts, my name is Professor McGonagall. Before you take your seats for the start of term feast you will be sorted into your houses. Those houses being Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. Follow me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus felt nervous as he followed with Peter closely behind him. He could almost taste how scared some of the students were. Standing with each of them as the woman stood by a stool with a hat on it that started to sing. He remembered his father telling him that the hat would sing each year depending on what was going on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it was over the woman had a list that she had pulled out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Archibald Abbott.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A blonde haired boy walked up to the stool and sat down. The hat said nothing at all as Remus watched on. Before the hat shouted, “Hufflepuff!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus heard the cheers from the table to their left as their new member joined them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sirius Black.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whispers immediately started as Remus looked around confused. Even Peter looked a little nervous as he took a step closer to the slightly taller boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus realized it was the boy from earlier; his silvery eyes looking around as he sat on the stool nervously. His fingers twitching as he gripped the stool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>I didn’t realize a Black was starting this year.”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus turned to look at the male behind them. Recognizing him as Frank from the train.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gryffindor!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gasps surrounded them as he heard even Peter let one go. The boy that had been with him whooping and fist pumping the air. The boy, Sirius, looked stunned as he glanced nervously at the Slytherin table. Remus didn’t know that an entire house could be disappointed in not getting one person yet here they were.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus tuned out the following names. Watching the boy sit nervously next to an older student. He looked entirely out of his depth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lily Evans.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus watched her go up the stairs with a calmness he knew he didn't have. Sitting down and smiling when the hat went on her head. She looked up at the brim of it with a frown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gryffindor!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She popped up without any hesitation; making her way to sit a little away from Sirius. Giving him a glare as she looked back towards the stool. The silver eyed boy just rolled his eyes at her before he turned his own eyes back to the sorting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus was more nervous now than he thought he’d be. He knew he didn’t belong here regardless of what Dumbledore had told him at his home. His parents had given up hope he’d come here and so had he.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Werewolves didn’t deserve a magical education is what his aunt had told him. She was the only family member that knew of his affliction. His parents having suppressed that particular announcement after seeing how she reacted. The only time he saw her was during the holidays anyways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus Lupin.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good luck.” Peter said softly, as Remus swallowed hard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The walk seemed to take forever although he knew it was only a few minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking at the hat as the professor lifted it as he sat down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it was put on his head he took a deep breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>A werewolf I see. Very peculiar….very rare. You’re clever but timid. Loneliness…but there’s loyalty there for the people you love. You’d do well in Ravenclaw.” a voice said, “But even still...hmm..the loyalty in you. A thirst for companionship.”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gryffindor!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus felt stunned as the hat was taken off of him and he walked into a daze to the Gryffindor table. There were cheering as he took a seat next to dark haired boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Sirius Black.” he said, “Meant to introduce myself after I ran you over.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus Lupin.” Remus said, giving him a small smile, “And I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We’ll call it a draw then, Remus Lupin.” Sirius grinned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two students went to Slytherin whilst one went to Ravenclaw. Peter’s name being called as he went up to sit on the stool. Remus watched the round face of the boy and tilted his head at the fear he saw on that face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His sorting seemed to go on forever in Remus’ mind. Watching as the unsorted students started to get restless. Almost as if they were about to protest to Peter’s taking so long. Everyone else hadn’t taken this long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gryffindor!” the hat cried finally as Remus let out a breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter walked, didn’t rush, but still had some haste in his footsteps to sit across from Remus. Smiling at the tawny haired boy as the werewolf returned it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“James Potter.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on, James!” Sirius cried next to him, as James grinned at the boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Best friend?” Peter asked, as Sirius snorted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We just met on the train but you could say that. You know your friends when you see them.” Sirius said firmly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can only imagine that where your arrogance fails his fills right in.” the red head, Lily, stated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It shouted Gryffindor before it even grazed James’ hair. The bespeckled boy standing up with a grin as he went to sit in between Peter and Lily, who groaned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“James Potter.” he said to Remus and Peter, ignoring the red head entirely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Peter Pettigrew and this is Remus Lupin.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pleasure.” James said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Severus Snape.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus watched both James and Sirius’ noses turn up at the name as they tried to get Peter and Remus to focus on them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So where are you two from?” Sirius asked Remus, who shrugged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Cotswolds.” Peter said, grinning, “You?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Slytherin!” the hat shouted, as the two boys faces went even more sour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The red head looked disappointed as she watched her friend go to the table opposite her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Islington in London.” Sirius told him, “James here is from Devonshire. What about you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked at Remus who looked at the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Merthyr Mawr in Wales.” Remus told them, seeing them look at him in interest which immediately made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fly under the radar. That was the one thing his father drilled into his head last night before he went to bed. And he hadn’t even made it an hour at this school without calling attention to himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where is that in Wales?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Between Bridgend and Porthcawl.” Remus answered honestly, “It’s a village.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius leaned his head on his hand as he stared at Remus curiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s really cool.” Sirius said, as Dumbledore stepped forward to welcome them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus watched the dishes in front of him fill with food. Everyone grabbing food immediately as he just stared at the food. While his parents loved him dearly, he always picked food last out of respect for them. Doing the same with these people before grabbing some chicken and potatoes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James, Peter and Sirius all talked and kept looking to Remus to fill in his own answers which the male did. Trying to include the red head, Lily, as well as the other occupants of the table in their year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the feast was over, Remus tried to blend into the crowd going towards their house. The moving staircases caught his attention quickly as the prefect navigated them with ease. The young werewolf kept with the others as they made it to a portrait with a hefty woman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Forget me not.” was spoken clearly as the portrait swung open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They filed inside and Remus’ eyes widened at the common room. It was spacious with a large window next to tables, being used by older students as they caught up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The girls dormitories are to the left, the boys to the right.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus followed Peter, James and Sirius up the stairs. Going to a door as James opened it. Their things were already in front of the four beds. Remus went and sat on his. The red curtains were open; the window showing the night sky.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two weeks until the full moon. The excuse he was supposed to use was his aunt was ill. His father would send him the excuses to make it look more valid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well looks like we’re going to be roommates, gents.” James said, sitting on his own bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter grinned widely, “Are you guys excited about classes?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m more excited about not being around my family.” Sirius said honestly, leaning against the wall, “If there were a definition for suffocation you’d see my mother as the example.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James and Peter laughed; Remus smiling just a little bit. Not enough to be noticeable from where the dark haired boy was standing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think we’re excited to be away from home and to learn spells.” James shrugged, “What about you, Remus?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m just happy to be here.” Remus told them honestly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because for all intents and purposes he shouldn’t have been. His parents were happy for the opportunity but they, like he thought that Dumbledore had lost his mind. But he assured them that he’d taken every precaution to keep his secret and protect him and the students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We should get ready for bed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each of them getting changed; Remus going into the bathroom. His parents for the most part kept him chained and muzzled once they discovered the wolf would try to bite his own limbs off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t think that Dumbledore knew that. But his scars told a story he didn’t want anyone to ask about. Glancing in the mirror as he sighed. The bite mark around his hip always stood out. He didn’t really have friends at home so no one saw him when he swan or did anything that could show this mark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other scars ran down his back in and his thighs. Putting pajamas on before he left the bathroom. They were all in their beds; curtains drawn and the light out. Remus went to the window and looked out over the lake they’d come to the school on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father used to tell him stories before he was bitten about Hogwarts. His mother having told him to stop that after.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything that occurred after always hurt to think about. He wasn’t supposed to make friends or draw attention to himself. If he did then that meant they’d have to move. They’d been in their current home for almost two years. No one noticed anything because he was homeschooled and kept away from the general masses. Like what he had was contagious every day instead of once a month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knew that closer to the moon his parents were scared of him. He was more moody; never mean or vicious just down and quiet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He never felt lucky since the bite. Never felt like he deserved much of anything. His father had had very different views before he was bitten. And even then he still had some of those same views; he just made sure not to mention them in front of Remus. But there was only so much walls could do to quieten his voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father had told his mother that he’d never say those things to Remus, because he still loved his son so much but the facts were facts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Werewolves were monsters; he by association was a monster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monsters didn’t have friends or a life. His father thought Hogwarts was a waste of his time because it would be next to impossible for him to get a job after.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His parents loved him but they were also painfully realistic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can’t sleep?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus looked at Sirius who was sitting up in his bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nerves.” Remus said softly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you kidding? Why are you nervous?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve moved a lot so I’m not used to making friends or staying places for long periods of time.” Remus said honestly, as Sirius slid out of his bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why do you move around so much?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My parents work. My father works at the Ministry in the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures department. So he tracks rogue spirits and ghosts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father had made the decision to stay on with the ministry because he and his mother thought it’d be easier for them to keep Remus’ affliction a secret. By shifting attention away from their family. His father was still very outspoken about being anti-werewolf to keep up the facade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s what his mother told him; as if that excused what Remus heard at night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus knew everything his parents did was for his own good. He used to be manageable under the full moon but now he wasn’t. Silencing charms and quad locked doors did nothing against the wolf now. Which is why the chains and muzzle had come out in the first place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Didn’t make it hurt any less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s cool.” Sirius said, standing beside Remus who looked at him, “Lot more interesting than my family.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do they do?” Remus asked, as Sirius looked at him in a stunned silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nothing really, they’re just rich. The Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.” Sirius said, not seeing anything on Remus’ face, “The Black family is known for being blood purists. Which is just a dfferent way of saying they’re assholes. I don’t care what blood status someone is. It’s all a bunch of bullshit.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well at least you have your own mind.” Remus said, as Sirius tilted his head with a smile, “Are they going to be excited you got sorted into Gryffindor?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The opposite really. Black’s are usually sorted into Slytherin.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus smiled kindly, “Well, let that be a lesson for you in that you’re nothing like them if you weer sorted into Gryffindor.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The smile that lit up Sirius’ face made Remus look away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Have you never heard of the Black family?” Sirius asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not really. My Dad didn’t really talk about wizarding families much when I was growing up. I think they thought I was going to present as a squib or something. Didn’t want to rub something in my face that may not happen.” Remus said, “That being said, if you don’t want to be like your family that isn’t a bad thing, Sirius. If most people could stand up to their families we may have less jerks in the world.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t know where the words were coming from even if he believed them with all his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think we’re going to be great friends, Remus Lupin.” Sirius said, earnestly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Friends? Remus tried to keep the shock off his face. While Peter had made the comment, Remus had hardly doubted he’d stay friends with him. The way Sirius looked and spoke with him made him believe it. He’d spent the last few weeks reading his textbooks on spells and potions to prepare himself. He’d never actually thought about making friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So much for flying under that radar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think so as well.” Remus said softly, “Good night Sirius.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus went to his own bed and crawled in. Pulling the curtains as he stared at the canopy in shock. He was so used to being shunned and called names by kids his age that he’d never even thought of the possibility of having friends in reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tried not to think too much on it as he fell asleep.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">The next morning found him in his first class Potions. He sat next to Peter who looked nervous as he looked at the cauldron in front of him. James and Sirius sat behind them and if Remus had any doubt about Sirius it was immediately rectified by the fact the boy had sat next to him at breakfast with James and spoke with him and Peter.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">People know when they’ve met good people is what his mother used to say about his bullies.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Good Morning class! I’m Professor Slughorn. Today we will be looking at brewing our first potion.” he said, “It will be the Pompinion Potion on page twenty-seven of your textbook. Go ahead and grab flitterby moth from the open cabinet. You’ll be working in pairs with the person next to you.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He went back into his office as the students started to move.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I’ll get it Remus.” Peter said, as he stood up and went to the cabinet.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius went with the other boy as James came to stand by his desk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“So Sirius and I are going to the Black Lake after classes if you want to join.” James said, “Peter can come too?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Um, I’m not so sure that’s a good idea.” Remus said, as James frowned, “It’s the first day of school, James.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Come on Remus, we get to have fun too. It isn’t just all studying. You have to let loose every-”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Out of the way, fatty.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus looked at the boy who had said it. Seeing the Slytherin tie and frowning as he recognized the boy as the one from the sorting that James and Sirius hadn’t liked.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Who the hell are you shaming when your nose should have it’s own postal code.” Sirius shot back with a glare.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus watched Peter look down, his cheeks pink as Sirius stood in front of him. James had stopped talking to look at the exchange as well.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Well at least my nose can fit through the door. What’s his excuse?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus felt the beginnings of anger stir in his stomach. Coming from the person who had accused him of excusing bullying he couldn’t handle it. Pulling his wand out and muttering a spell as he watched the Slytherin boy’s shoelaces tie together.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Are you so sure about that?” Sirius snapped, “Don’t be a-”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Seeing the boy trip and fall with the moths going into his face caused the whole classroom to laugh loudly. Lily ran up to him to help him fix his shoelaces with a glare in their direction.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“At least Peter can walk by himself. Seems that is a problem for you.” Remus said, causing the laughter to intensify.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius and Peter looked at Remus as James stared at the boy in incredulity.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The two Gryffindor boys coming over to them as Peter sat back down.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“You tied his shoelaces together.” James said, quietly, “That was bloody brilliant!”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“He was being a bully.” Remus told them softly.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“More than just.” Sirius said, as Peter smiled at him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Thank you, Remus.” Peter said, as Slughorn came back out.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Mr. Snape, what are you doing on the floor, my boy? You have to brew a potion at your desk.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus hid his laugh behind a hand; the other three boys doing no such thing as they outright laughed with the rest of the class.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Something told the tawny haired boy that him doing that would definitely come up later at the Black Lake. Because as soon as James said something about it to Peter the boy had looked at him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">And just like that he had three friends.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">Severus Snape was a bit of an ass, if Remus was honest. It didn’t matter what class it was Potions or Transfiguration. He always tried to single out someone from Gryffindor with the exception of Lily Evans.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">After a nasty comment about Sirius’ family being disappointed in their son, Remus had sent a tripping jinx his way on the stairs. Granted, he hadn’t meant for it to hit when the male got to the stairs but nevertheless he stood by it because Sirius hadn’t actually done anything to the git yet. Especially after Sirius had gotten a Howler from his parents about how disappointed they were in him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">While Sirius didn’t want to be like his parents, it had hurt him. Remus could see it on his face even as they tried to get his mind off of it.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">However, his little jinxes in Potions had caused a great debate about starting pranks. James and Sirius had been ‘absolutely inspired’ by Remus.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“If we’re going to do it we’ll get caught.” Peter said, frowning.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Not if we’re smart about it.” Sirius said, “Remus can come up with some pranks. Obviously he knows jinxes.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I read a lot before we came to school.” Remus said, blushing, “And I’m not so sure that we can get away with pranks when we don’t even know our way around the school fully. It’s only been two weeks.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Then we’ll learn it. We can pull a prank after that, right Rem?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Rem? Remus could fully state that he’d never had a nickname before except from his mother.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The young werewolf chewed his bottom lip.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Let me get back from home and I’ll think about it.” Remus said, as the other boys frowned, “I already told you boys that my aunt is ill. My parents didn’t say how serious it was but they want me home for the weekend.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I forgot.” Sirius frowned, “Do you have to, Rem?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus flushed, “You know I do, Sirius. My parents made it quite clear that my presence was demanded, not asked.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Sucks.” Peter sighed, leaning against the same tree as James was sitting in.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus looked down as Sirius threw his arm over his shoulder.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I get it.” Sirius said, an understanding look on his face, “Family doesn’t really give you a choice. We’ll plan pranks when you get back.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I said I’d think about it.” Remus told him, seeing Sirius shrug.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Yeah but how can you say no to the three of us? We’re your best friends.” Sirius said, as the three of them gave Remus their best puppy dog faces.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus laughed and shoved Sirius away. It was so weird thinking about having friends but at the same time it was a welcome thing.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Fine! We’ll plan a prank when I get back.” Remus said, “It—should only be a few days at most.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Seeing them celebrate and knowing he had caused their happiness made him stop reading for just a moment.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">His parents had written to him a few times asking how he was liking things. His father questioning if he’d made friends yet and reminding him again it may not be a good idea.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">And Remus knew why it wasn’t but at the same time, he adored these three boys just a few weeks into their school career. Whether they remained friends or not was in their hands, not his.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“So you’re leaving tonight?” Sirius asked, as James and Peter walked ahead of them.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I am.” Remus said.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius, while sticking to James’ side most of the time, stuck to Remus whenever he wasn’t. Their first night in the tower stuck with Remus. It was the first real talk he’d had with someone.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Loneliness killed people whether his parents wanted to admit it or not. And the very selfish part of Remus that he never liked to acknowledge wanted to not be lonely anymore. He wanted to be around people...have friends. Even if they left him in the end. No matter how his parents reacted to him having friends.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Well that means you’ll be back that much sooner.” Sirius said, “Jamie, Pete, let’s say we have a round of Exploding Snap.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">This was his life now and he was fine with it.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">The transformations were always horrible. They had been ever since his first one. Every bone in your body broken and repaired to accommodate a beast lurking inside you just ready to rip out of you once a month.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He remembered the pain. It was all he did all night. For hours on end; seeing himself being ripped into and not being able to do anything.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He saw everything.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He felt everything.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He remembered everything.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">But he couldn’t stop anything. That night, like most nights, was the same.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He remembered the spells his father put up for the chains. The chains were needed but the muzzle spell was more advanced than what he could do.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">It would keep him restrained and that was what was important. He knew Dumbledore had put spells upon spells around the Shrieking Shack to keep him inside. Knew that unless someone took them down he’d stay in this place.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">But it still scared him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The first transformation in the shack he knew would be the most difficult. It was a new territory to the wolf. It was unfamiliar and strange and the wolf needed a routine and a safe space.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Madame Pomfrey walked him down and into the shack. She walked him back into the castle and into the Hospital Wing. From there a cloaking spell hid him from prying eyes.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Letting her heal him and wondering what the boys were doing.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He had new scars on his thigh and his wrist. Madame Pomfrey had paled when she’d seen it. Remus knew it was bad but the wolf was furious.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Pomfrey was understanding and motherly. She fixed him up and gave him blood replenishing potions. Took every precaution and tried to get him out in two days.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“We don’t want you to miss too many classes.” she told him, giving him a cup of Skele Gro.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He had drank it like someone who had had to drink it one too many times. It tasted foul, like someone had put all the bitter and sourness in the world into one bottle.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">But it worked; hurt like hell to regrow broken bones but it got him out of there sooner.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">That was his routine. Sometimes he wondered if it was worth it. All of this pain and for what? To never have a job when he got done with school? Friends who would flee if they ever found out?</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">His father was probably right. Making friends was probably a mistake.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">And yet, he had this feeling that these boys were different. And he wanted to prove his father wrong.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">It took everything in him to choke down the potions.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He’d made his friends a promise to pull a prank after all.</p>
<p align="center">------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">James had tackled him to the bed as soon as he’d walked through the dorm. Sirius and Peter not far behind as they squeezed him in a tight hug.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“You’re back!” Peter said loudly.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Four months and it still stunned Remus that they were happy to see him. They questioned him still about having to leave each month but he kept up the lie that his aunt was ill.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">It was a good lie. If his aunt was ill then he could use that same excuse for as long as needed until he had to think of another one.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">In that four month period they had played more pranks than Remus had originally thought they would’ve. So far, they hadn’t gotten any detentions. They’d been so sneaky and stealthy that it was quite amazing.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">But luck always ran out; Remus Lupin knew that for a fact.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Their main target was Slytherin. The house as a whole became the butt of their jokes.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“How is your aunt?” James asked, as they all got off of him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Still very ill but my parents needed the break.” Remus lied, “The few days I’m there they can actually rest and do things they want to do.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“That’s a lot to ask from a kid.” Peter frowned.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Yeah but Remus isn’t like most kids. He’s too responsible.” Sirius said, pinching Remus’ cheek and laughing as he moved away from the swatting hand, “It’s a good quality, Rem.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Then why do you say it like it isn’t?” Remus asked suspiciously.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Because I don’t understand that quality.” Sirius grinned.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus rolled his eyes as Sirius sat next to him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“So we’re staying over the holiday with you.” Peter announced as Sirius opened his mouth, “Sorry! I was too excited to keep it in.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Thankfully the full moon was a full two and a half weeks before Christmas. It had been a full three and a half days ago.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Why?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Like we could let you be here by yourself.” James rolled his eyes.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Yeah Remus, that’s utter nonsense.” Sirius told him, “Besides, it’ll give us plenty of time to come up with a beginning of new term prank.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius’ mind was always on pranks and tricks. While he had other hobbies like getting into muggle music because of Simon and Remus, muggle clothing and motorcycles his main focus was on pranks.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He and James breezed through their classes whereas Remus and Peter had to study. Granted tehir friends helped them but they never went out of their way to study themselves.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Homework, unless it was an essay, was done in their study hour.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Which I bet you’ve already thought about.” Remus snorted.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“More than thought about. The three of us have an idea but it needs the Remus Lupin touch.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The tawny haired boy laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus Lupin touch meant making it harder for them to get caught. McGonagall already had her nose sniffing around them. Nothing she could pin on them but still she was onto them.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“What’s the prank?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“We want to prank Snivellus. We thought about charming his seat to making sounds when he sits down. Peter thinks farting ones but we’re open to suggestions.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Snivellus was a nickname that James had given Severus Snape and it had stuck. Remus bore the boy no ill will but it was a harmless prank. The nickname had started because Snape had sniffled his way through an entire Potions class and it had driven James insane.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“What about a foghorn instead?” Remus suggested, seeing Peter’s eyes light up, “We could charm all of his things to do it, actually. Touching his quill, parchment, bag...anything really.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“What’s foghorn?” Sirius asked.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“It’s a really loud blast of sound. I don’t even know how to-”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus muttered a silencing spell before charming a book. Picking it up as the sound emited from it.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“That’s brilliant! Could we do it to him during breakfast too?” James asked, eyes bright.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“It’d be a little harder.” Remus said, frowning just a little, “But if we all do it then it’ll be easier. No one can see your wands move though. They do and that’s detention for all of us.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Even if we get detention it’d be worth it.” Peter said, as the other two nodded.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus just smiled at them. They were fearless in their need to prank not jus tSnape but everyone. It was something they all enjoyed so much. To the point where it was the foundation of their friendship.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">At least one of them.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Standing up from his bed and going to his trunk. Shifting things around with a frown before pulling out some chocolate. Going over to the bed and offering some to Sirius.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I guess that means we’ll have to do it in the next few days before everyone leaves the castle.” Remus said offhandedly, as the boys laughed, “I’d hate for you boys to not have your audience.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius shoved him just a little, “You love the audience too.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“If I do or don’t only I know.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Going down to breakfast and sitting immediately across from Snape. They each pointed their wand at them and muttered the spell. Making sure not to say it too loud but also making sure they were saying it precisely.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">At the sound of the first foghorn, it made the entire hall jump in tandem.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus hid his smile behind his goblet. It was so loud and repetitive that he wondered if he should’ve found a less obnoxious noise.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Seeing the looks on the three boys faces though changed his mind. They looked positively delighted to hear and see the reactions that Snape was giving out.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Eating his food quietly and trying not to laugh each time he heard the foghorn sound. Up until Slughorn ended the enchantment.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus looked up to the table of professors to see McGonagall looking at them suspiciously.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He looked to his food with a frown.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“What’s wrong, Remus?” Peter asked.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Act natural.” Remus told them, “McGonagall is onto us.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius grabbed a few crumpets and attempting to juggle them.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“That’s awful.” James said, “Where’d you learn to juggle at?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I didn’t.” Sirius told him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus grabbed one out of the air and started to eat it.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“Cheers, I enjoy crumpets more once they’ve been tossed in the air.” Remus joked, as Sirius dropped them with a burst of loud laughter escaping him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“You’re hilarious, really.” James said, laughing as well.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">“I try.” Remus said, “Peter would you like to try it? It’s life changing.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Peter nodded as he split the crumpet; handing it off to the other boy.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He knew his father kept telling him to break off these friendships but he didn’t think he ever could. He knew this Christmas holiday would be one of his favorites. These people didn’t have to be friends with him but they were.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">And for some reason, that meant more than a holiday with his parents. Who Remus sometimes felt like had to love him. After hearing them talk about werewolves when they thought he wasn’t around...it made him feel unwelcome. He loved his parents but they were obligated to love and care for him.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">These three people weren’t. Remus knew that he’d do anything for these boys. Although he was eleven, he agreed with James and Sirius. You knew your friends when you met them.</p>
