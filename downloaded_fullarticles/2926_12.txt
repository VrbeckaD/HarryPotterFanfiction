    <p>The platform was bustling. That was the only way to describe it. Children filled every available space, parents taking up what was left. This would be intimidating to a normal person, but to those with Asperger's, it was a living nightmare. Whining slightly under her breath, she took a deep breath and plunged forward into the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>The girl frowned. She didn't know if she would make any friends going to Hogwarts. Not many people wanted to be friends with her, so she'd begun to drive other people away. Counderproductive, but meant that annoying people stayed away.</p><p> </p><p>She followed her sister through the throng of people. She could just barely see her long hair through the hordes of people filling the platform to the brim. She just had to stay with her sister. She'd promised.</p><p> </p><p>The three girls stood in a huddle. Two of them laughed uncontrollably as they poked repeatedly at the third girl. She did not look amused by the others' antics. She looked like she wanted to just disappear.</p><p> </p><p>The two girls smiled nervously at each other as they waited to board. One had been completely abandoned by her two sisters when they met up with their friends. The other's sister managed to get them on the train and into a compartment before disappearing.</p><p> </p><p>Her sister bounced up and down beside her. She wished the young girl would shut up for a minute and not keep going on about Hogwarts, so she could calm her wildly pounding nerves before she passed out completely.</p><p> </p><p>She hung back by her parents. The noise of the platform was loud and it made her nervous. She didn't know if Hogwarts would be accomodating to her Autism or not.</p>
