    <p>Harry hated her name. And yes that was a her and no it isn’t short for anything. </p><p>Harry was born on the 3rd of November 1981, while the country was still celebrating the defeat of You-Know-Who. It was amongst all this celebrating that her mother would go into labour, her parents, as thanks to the boy-who-lived, decided that their child would either be called Harriet or Harry.</p><p>What her parents had not expected was to have delivered two healthy happy twin girls. </p><p>Her older sister who was rude enough to be born five minutes before her, so got the feminine name of Harriet. As for her, well her parents were stumped, it would have been easier if she was a boy, but they couldn’t think of another feminine version of Harriet and the nurse was waiting there expectedly with the birth certificate to fill out. </p><p>To put it simply, her parents panicked and her sister got Harriet while she was stuck with just Harry. </p><p>Harriet understood her sister’s pain, and comforted her with the fact that if she still hated it when she hit 16 she could just change it. But that was beside the point, she would still have to spend the next few years stuck with the name Harry while at Hogwarts. </p><p>Years later after finally getting her letter for Hogwarts, the twins would end up in Ravenclaw together. She must admit at feeling some curiosity about her namesake, hearing that he was in the year above her. But when she gazed at the faces at the Gryffindor table during her first feast she could not see the famous boy</p><p>It would be in the morning that she would hear tales of a flying car, she would soon learn that such stories were common when concerning the boy-who-lived</p><p>Harry will also learn during her many years at Hogwarts, that while she and her sister were the first to be named for Harry Potter they were not the last, in her fourth year three boys and a girl would all be sorted into Gryffindor together and later confirm that yes they were all named after Harry Potter, seriously they should really start a club or something</p><p>Harry was determined that no matter what her parents said the moment she hit 16 she was changing her name, and nothing would affect her decision</p><p>It was the same year she turned 16 that Harry Potter would defeat You-Know-Who for the last time, she still changed her name but as thanks still kept the Harry, and days after the battle of Hogwarts she would become Hope Harry Hartshorn, maybe the name Harry did grow on her a little in the end</p>
