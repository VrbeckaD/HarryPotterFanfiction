    <p>The first time Sirius Orion Black felt something odd was when he was four years old. He was in his playroom and Kreacher had given him a picture book on magical beasts and species. As any four year-old was wont to do, he was perusing the pictures and calling out the names of those he knew.</p><p>"Dragon!" "Elf!" "Goblin!"</p><p>But, when he came on an unknown picture of a horse with the torso of a man, he was immediately struck with an image of a centaur that he had seen with his own eyes before, with a gleaming chestnut coat of fur and wise eyes. He didn't know how he knew it was called a centaur, but he had the strange feeling that he had seen one in person, despite never having left the oppressive walls of Number 12, Grimmauld Place.</p><p>But, he was only four years old and did not know what it could mean. He did not even ponder upon it too much. It was a centaur and that was that.</p>
