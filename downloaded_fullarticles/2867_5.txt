  <span class="s1">Harry Potter had all but demanded him to be his husband. The<em> darling</em> of Ravenclaw had looked at him with hard determination his eyes, and offered him the prestige of the Potter name. And Tom Riddle could only stare in fascination at the boy who he never even had talked to in all his years at Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p class="p2">Of all his admirers, none had ever had the pure confidence the Ravenclaw possessed. He was unapologetic, straight to the point, and was not blushing. Which was a pity really, because the Potter heir was beautiful.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom lifted a delicate eyebrow at him, wondering why of all the other men who had greater blood than Tom Riddle, the Ravenclaw had chosen him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Ravenclaw, known for his intelligence, had read his mind in an instant, offering him a small smirk. “You’re going to be the Minister one day,” he said airily. “And I want to be by your side when that happens.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom, Slytherin that he was, lived for ambition. And the clear view of it in Potter’s eyes had amused him. And he would be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom had laughed charmingly and asked if the Ravenclaw was prepared for hours of work and endless galas, and Harry had squared his shoulders, looked at him straight in the eye, and said, “Ambition never tires, Tom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">And Tom had been stunned because he’d only seen that kind of determination from himself. He was mesmerized.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom marveled at Harry’s triumphant smile, when Tom agreed then just to humor the boy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A Potter heir, after all, would make a powerful enemy, but would make an even greater ally.</span>
