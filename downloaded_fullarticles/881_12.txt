  <b>Prologue</b>
</p><p><span><span>Lukas waved good-bye to his brother </span></span><span><span>Marvin</span></span><span><span> as he walked out of the visiting </span></span><span><span>room.</span></span> <span><span>Exiting the prison compound, he shook his head with an annoyed frown. How did Marv always get himself into these things? Of course, partnering up with Harry had been a new low in his spectacular career of less than bright ideas. Witness the name the duo gave themselves, the "Wet Bandits". Never mind that Lukas had suggested that in jest, trying to point out that they were both wet behind the ears and by no means ready for real crime. </span></span></p><p>And what had those two done? Thanked him and run with it.</p><p>Lukas very much wanted to bang his head off the walls of the bus he was riding back home. No way was he really related to this idiot, there had to have been a mistake, maybe the babies were switched at birth or something. Hey, it's been known to happen.</p><p>"Be sure to stay far away from little kids," Marv had told him, his wide eyes betraying his serious fear for his brother. "There's nothing worse than kids, you hear me?"</p><p>Lukas scoffed. Marv had been defeated by a child, why would Lukas take advice from that loser? Marv's story <em>had</em> given him some ideas, though. Obviously, Marv's mistake had been in dismissing the kid and going for valuable items in the house. But what if one focused on the kid in the first place?</p><p>

    <span>would easily pay a few millions just to get back their spoilt brats. And as his brother had so nicely pointed out, not all of them kept their eyes on their kids as much as they should. This was going to be easy. </span>
