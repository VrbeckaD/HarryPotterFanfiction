    <p>Draco strolled down the sidewalk, smirking like the devil incarnate. His hands were deep in his pockets and a cigarette perched from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>A passing pedestrian jumped as a shoe flew by him from above. The man turned his eyes up in alarm as Draco kept walking, humming a tune.</p>
<p>A shrill female voice scratched through the air from a fourth-floor window. "YOU! You get back here, or I swear to-"</p>
<p>He barked out a laugh as he paused to relight his cigarette.</p>
<p>“Come now, Jessica. No need for the dramati-"</p>
<p>"ELIZA."</p>
<p>"Excuse me. Eliza." He turned his amused, silver eyes to the topless woman who was hanging out of her flat window” She panted with rage. “I believe I paid fairly for your wares."</p>
<p>She sucked in an indignant gasp, her face turning a frightful shade of plum.</p>
<p>"How da<b>RE Y</b>-"</p>
<p>"I'll call you!" He cut her off and gave her a mock salute, continuing his strut.</p>
<p>The bewildered passerby jolted out of his trance and sprang into a run as a barrage of items rained from the sky. Everything from lamps, to mugs, to book ends and more shoes. Each missed their intended target as he continued to saunter along.</p>
<p>He restarted his tune to the beat of falling home decor and melody of piercing shrieks in the distance. A shit-eating grin spread across his face as he fingered the smooth vial in his pocket.</p>
<p>Today was going to be a good day.</p>
<hr/>
<p> To put it frankly, his life had taken a sharp turn into left field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meet Draco Malfoy: Purveyor of illicit magical relics, un-certified Potions Master, hitman for hire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Needed your boss sorted out? He could fix that. You’re in need of a specific trinket or bauble? Easy. Tired of dealing with your estranged husband siphoning money out of your bank accounts? Draco was your man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His clientele you ask? Muggles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was renowned through the undergrounds and the glittering heights as the one to go to no matter the problem. He always had the solution. Some thought he was a member of the mafia. Some called it black magic. Others flat out thought he was a con artist. Though, at the end of the day, they couldn’t deny the results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But for it, you had to pay. And pay they did.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seven years he’d been at it now, working tirelessly job after job. He’d done well for himself in Muggle London, considering. He imagined the young boy he was all that time ago wouldn’t be able to recognize him now, even with a name badge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, when it came down to it, it had all came out of bleak necessity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the events of the War, the repercussions of being on the losing side swiftly dropped on his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He spent his 18th birthday in a cage. Pureblood Elitist. Ex-Death Eater. War Criminal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em> He’s just a boy! </em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He would never forget his mother’s cries as he was dragged out of the room. The sharp stones of the floor had ripped mercilessly into his knees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The trials had dragged on for months. He held no concept of time behind those bars. The Aurors would come to interrogate him sporadically, leaving no hint of a schedule.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where was his mother? Was she okay? Had they hurt her?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Were they going to leave them there to rot? Would they not even send him to Azkaban? Was he worth so little?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Yes. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re a spineless piece of shit, you are.” The man’s breath was rancid. “Despicable. The lot of you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Yes. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You don’t deserve to breathe the same air as us. Terrorist. Murderer!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> I didn’t.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So many innocent dead because of you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> I couldn’t- </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> “ </em>Young lives. Good lives.” “Was it worth it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> I- </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman’s sapphire eyes held so much hatred, it burned him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We’re going to drain your head dry until there’s nothing left. Every last speck of information will be ours, and then we’ll throw you away with the rest them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She spat at his feet. The door slammed. They left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They kept their word. Never had he felt so empty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The truth elixir knocked down his carefully-built walls. Inch by painful inch they pulled the memories from him. His pristine childhood. His warm mother. His cold father. His taunting. His cruelty. His training. His rite. His failure. His shame. <em> His fear. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knew that at each wispy blue moment they pull from him, they would hiss an insult at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They wanted him to react. They wanted a reason. But he was so empty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Merlin, what have I done? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He saw those blue crystalline eyes again at his final trial, glowering at him behind a black fringe. If looks could kill, he knew he’d be a dead man ten times over by now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Loud buzzes of rage rolled into his senses as his cage rose into the courtroom on a pulley system. It was all white noise, the shouting. He swore he heard Potter’s voice at one point. His tone of righteousness bleeding through the static. On and on and on- he thought he might go mad. Until it stopped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And there was only her voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His gaze shifted to the witness podium where Hermione Granger stood. His flat grey eyes met her amber depths.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A searing heat burned in his sternum as he stared at her, his face slack. She seemed to speak for hours. He couldn’t register a word she was saying to the Wizengamot. She was still talking. Against him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“-did not. And I fully believe his omittance that night saved Harry, Ron and I’s life from being handed over to Voldemort .”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> For him. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The crowd erupted in outrage, the Wizengamot was ordering for silence.The heat grew stronger. And he knew what it was now. It was pure, unadulterated rage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tried to yell but it came out as no more than a soft hiss. His voice non-existent from disuse. Her eyes met his again and she flinched.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Stupid girl. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His father was sent to Azkaban with a thirty year sentence. Draco and his mother were released with a restrictive probation of ten years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Manipulated spouse and minor, they said. Brainwashed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Riots broke out in front of the Ministry after the final hearing. The first two weeks they were escorted by Aurors from the Manor to the Ministry for paperwork and legal admin. Their bodyguards smirked as they signed their names on the respective dotted lines, giving their government permission to neuter them of their rights as witch and wizard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They took away his wand. They snapped hers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Manipulated or not, they said, she was an adult of sound mind the entire time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the last day of legalities, they were escorted out of the Ministry. The crowd swarmed. Their so-called protectors did nothing. Feigning injury or ignorance. A couple disapparating on the spot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His mother was caught under foot. Draco couldn’t reach her, couldn’t see her, he couldn’t-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He woke up three days later in St. Mungos. They told him he was recovering from severe concussion. His mother…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy was dead. Dying of blunt-force trauma to the head. Internal bleeding that couldn’t be stopped or reversed by the time she was brought to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He broke down while taking the first steps into the Manor foyer. His house elf, Mipsy, fretted and cried as he shook on the marble floor. No amount of tea or frilly cakes could fix this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The riots started from the outrage of Lucius’s ‘short’ sentencing. They didn’t care that he would wilt away in that hell hole, leaving only his decayed mind. They wanted his life. They wanted to see them all bleed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stayed in the Manor for a month longer. The constant screaming from outside the stone walls dug into his brain like hot pokers. He felt like a caged animal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He once made the mistake of stepping out into his garden to check on his mother’s coveted hydrangeas. He thanked his quick reflexes as he flung himself out of the way of a nasty hex. It missed by barely an inch. The caster almost foamed at the mouth with feral rage at Draco’s very existence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was another part of his probation. The blood Wards on the family property lines were no more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No walls. No privacy. No escape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had played their part in ensuring Draco’s freedom from Azkaban. And he <em> hated </em> them for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had thought he knew what it was to hate before. Based on looks, class, blood status. No. He hated them for their short-sightedness. They’re stupid Gryffindor bravado. Their fucking hero complexes. Golden saviors that cared not of the consequences of their bloody help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the trial it had been revealed that the sentencing would have only been five years. Five fucking years. Draco knew now that was nothing. Fleeting. If they had only done their time in Azkaban, his beautiful mother would still be here, and breathing -- alive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could have been able to hear her soft singing voice one last time as it drifted through the air. Watched as she tended to her flowers in her bedroom bay window. He could’ve seen her smile. Kissed her cheek. Told her how <em> sorry he was </em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Potter had forced his way into the house one night. Draco had stared at his feet, his face blank. He hadn’t heard a word of what Scarhead had said. He thought he heard something about lost opportunity and doors closing and windows opening--honestly, what a load of <em> pygmy-shite </em>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had been about to walk away from his rambling, but then Potter had said something that forced Draco to look at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We didn’t know.” Harry’s eyes shone like glass. “We couldn’t have known.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His fucking face was practically dripping with sincerity. It made Draco sick. A sneer came easily to his features as he stook a stiff step toward the black-haired man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What is this?” he hissed. “Are you repenting?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry straightened his shoulders and looked Malfoy straight in the eye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am so sorry for your loss, Malfoy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s eyes flashed with barely-contained mania, his teeth bared, “Get out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry for the part we played in your loss.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Get. Out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Your mother… She didn’t des-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> CRACK. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stumbled back, gingerly holding on to his nose. No matter his fumbling, blood began to spill in angry red down the front of his shirt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You should’ve <em> fucking </em> known better!” Draco’s entire body was taut with tension. His fist was curled, knuckles red, ready to throw another hit to the Golden Boy’s stupid gushing face. <em> I hate him, I hate him, I hate him- </em>“You should have known she didn’t stand a chance.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had expected Harry to launch at him. Good. He wanted a fight. He wanted to take some of his pain and transfer it to him. He wanted to make him hurt. It served the idiot right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But instead, Harry stilled. He muttered apology after apology with his eyes clenched shut and his palm tight against his nose. Not moving from his crouched position on the marble floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next time Draco demanded he leave, Harry listened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mipsy cried over the small pools of blood leading out to the main doors. Draco ignored her as she scrubbed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two days later, he was gone. Leaving no more than a note and an old tie for Mipsy, proclaiming she was free to do as she pleased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He escaped to Muggle London with only a small pension of his fortune to his name, courtesy of Blaise Zabini.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Ministry had put a hold on the Malfoy vaults, refusing to leave a single sickle to Draco. Their reasoning for the hold was Draco needed to fully assimilate himself into working class society and earn his way for the duration of his ten year probation. This would ensure he had gained <em> loyalty, integrity, respect, </em> and more asinine nonsense that Draco barely listened to. He had been too busy envisioning his hands around the Ministry clerk’s neck as he prattled on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They had tried to access the hidden accounts abroad in France and Italy, but word had traveled, those were also closed to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thankfully, Blaise’s mother had a long standing relationship with the goblins of Gringotts. Sharp and prickly they may be, but when given the right, shiny motivation, they could be swayed. With the trade of a centuries-old goblet of goblin design, and the promise that no one would know of their transgression, Draco gained rights to a small pension of 500 galleons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pitiful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he exiled himself to the Muggle world, Blaise employed the help of someone unexpected: Luna Lovegood. Since she was known as a Pureblood muggle lover, it ruffled no one's feathers to find her exchanging the Galleons for British Pound notes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco chose not to comment on the connection. He wasn’t entirely sure he even wanted to know what was going on there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Luna sent the package to him, it was almost bursting. The tiny sliver of his fortune was worth five times as much here. His shock was short lived, however. Even in the Muggle world, it truly wasn’t much to live on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was an adjustment. A painful one. Everything he had been taught about Muggles was false. Well-- maybe not everything. They did roll around in metal deathtraps. They did slowly kill themselves with rolled up tar and herb. Most of them were incredibly uncouth in what they wore, how they spoke, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the longer he immersed himself in Muggle London, the more he couldn’t deny the similarities. He also couldn’t deny how miniscule this world made him feel. He was still alone. Only this time, it wasn’t him against the world. He was lost in a new world, completely ignorant of its ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merlin, how he missed his mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the end of the second month when Draco finally spoke to one of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stumbled into a pub, <em> Roscoes </em>, a place he frequented often to escape the cold of the night. He had spent several weeks on the street now, having worn down his expenses drastically by staying in motels. They hadn’t been gaudy or lush, but they drained his allowance just the same. He needed to ration. Food was the priority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had spent a lot of time berating himself for being so careless. But, the reality was he had never in his life had to watch how he spent his money. He was completely out of his element.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He met a man by the name of Geraint Barns, the owner of <em> Roscoes. </em> He was a gruff fellow, his age only showing from the gray in his hair and the way he favored his right leg. He had broad shoulders and a square, protruding gut. His salt-and-pepper chest hair always fluffed out of his v-neck shirts. His arms were riddled with various faded tattoos he had collected during his time in the British Army.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man was a tank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had had too many tequilas that night in an attempt to quell his nervousness of speaking to a Muggle. It definitely didn’t have anything to do with his fear that the Muggle could easily crush him with his pinky if he so much as looked at him funny.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Look at him. Cowering before a Muggle. A past version of himself would have cackled at the notion. Life without a wand definitely put things into perspective a bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He remembered Barns had barely said a word to him as he rambled about his predicament in his drunken state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco didn’t even know if he had made any sense, let alone if he had said more than he probably should have. Something about his dead mother, something about no money, no place to go. Probably sounded like nothing more than the jumbled nonsense of a drunken loser, telling the bartender all his life problems. <em> Salazar, he had been absolutely bottled. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the older man had simply nodded and grunted when appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the end of his spiel, Barns had stared down at Draco for a beat, before tapping the counter top.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tab’s on me, lad.” He refilled Draco’s drink. “You can have the studio upstairs. It’s run down, mind you. But it’s a roof over your head.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco blinked, frozen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then his pride reared its ugly head, covering his shame, his failure. He was always known for ruining a good thing. “I don’t need your pity,” he spat before storming out of the establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took him less than a full day to swallow his pride and returned to <em> Roscoe’s </em>, holding his head up as high as he could. Barns looked up at him as he paused in his cleaning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I apologize for my actions, I was incredibly rude and acted like a petulant child,” Draco bit his tongue. <em> Never in his life </em>- “Especially with such a generous offer to someone you don’t even know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The veteran grunted. He threw his towel over his shoulder and leaned against the counter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can pay for my stay. I don’t have much, so my stay won’t be long. But, my standards do not allow me to accept this for free.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How much you got?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco took out the carefully folded notes from his blazer pocket, showing him the thin stack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hn,” Barns took the stack and counted. He counted again. His eyes pensive on the cash before meeting Draco’s stare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is it sufficient?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He unfolded the money, took a fiver, folded the stack and handed it back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Done.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was, again, stuck in a position where his ego was bruised and he was ready to spit venom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Barns held up a hand, halting Draco’s forked tongue, “Listen, boy.” He stared at him hard. “You say you can’t take it unless you pay? There you have it, you’ve paid. It’s within my right to charge what I like, and this is the amount I want. The rest you can use for things you need. Like food.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know what it’s like to be cold and hungry with no where to go, alright? My saving grace was serving for Queen and Country. Twenty plus years of my life.” He spoke in a measured tone as his hazel eyes bore into Draco, his voice gravelly. “My son knew what it was like to be cold and alone too. But, he didn’t have no saving grace. He didn’t get out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The angry heat that had been in Draco’s belly fled with the confession.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You remind me of him,” Barns scoffed. “Christ, you even kinda look like him. Though the hair is way off.” He flapped his hand as if wafting something away. “He’d never stick his head in a barrel of bleach the way you obviously did, but to each his own.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco didn’t understand some of the terms, but he got the gist of it. He didn’t have the heart to argue that his hair was 100% natural.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My point is, I wish someone had been there to see when my boy was in need and did something about it. I wish I had-” He sighed. He pocketed the five pound note. “Anyway. It’s done. You’ll stay here. If you can’t find honest work of your own, you can help me with the pub. The pay won’t be much, but it’ll be something.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was floored. The only thing he could say was-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“...Thank you. For your kindness.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hn.” Barns went back to shining the counter. “Don’t mention it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And that was that. Draco had a place of his own. Barns hadn’t exaggerated that the studio was run down. The flooring was chipped, the late-70’s wallpaper was bubbling from water damage, and the bathroom, <em> Merlin’s pointy hat the bathroom </em>, was a travesty. But he made do. He had to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Roscoe’s became his stomping ground and where he found his first clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, it’s never that simple. He had to wheedle his way in, and give them a reason to believe. He attempted to seduce them with his charm. He told them he can bring results, for a price. They all told him to “Sod off, you freak” “Bloody hack.” “No one would be stupid enough to buy what you’re selling. Stick with cleaning tables.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then one day as he was leaving the bar for a food run, he saw him. The one that started his climb to fame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The forlorn husband that was crying into his drink about his wife. The wife that didn’t love him anymore. Like a bolt of lightning to his brain, the thought came to him. He could fix that!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco expected much of the same from him, anger and disgust at being <em> conned </em>. But this man was so desperate, so willing to do anything to win the heart back of his long lost love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately, he wrote a letter to Lovegood. He needed supplies to make this happen. He needed Neville Longbottom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Longbottom’s newfound position at Hogwarts as Professor Sprout’s assistant meant that he had a whole range of potions ingredients at his disposal. He also had access to the Potions room for study.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He definitely was not easy to convince. Draco for a time thought it was all for naught and his chance had flown by him, but Ms. Lovegood had a way with Mr. Longbottom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Never before had Draco Malfoy been so grateful for the schoolboy crush Neville had on Luna until then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once she took matters into her own hands, parcels were being sent to Draco weekly through the Muggle post. First the tools, a cauldron, then mortar and pestle, scalpels, everything. Then the ingredients. First basics, and then by Draco’s instructions, more specific. Moonstone. Ashwinder Eggs. Pre-plucked rose bulb roots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He let it slide that each one was tagged with a mini-Howler. They were all along the same line of <b> <em>You git</em> </b> and and <b> <em>I’m not your delivery boy</em> </b> and <b> <em>I don’t know what good Luna sees in you anyway</em> </b>. Truly, Draco didn’t mind. If this was the price for a constant stream of magical material in a non-magical world, he’d pay it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though the last one struck him. <b>I swear to Godric, Malfoy, if you are brewing a love potion I will personally find you and- </b>He shut the screaming letter into the cauldron and plopped down the lid, muffling the screeches. It exploded with a pop and clang of metal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He obviously needed to be more careful with the order of his requests it seemed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Potion brewing was Draco’s favorite. It calmed and focused him. He could spend hours without complaint measuring, cutting, stirring. He was meticulous and precise with his craft. And if he wanted this to play out the way he hoped, he needed accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Potioning water. Three frozen Ashwinder eggs for love’s flame. Rose roots, instead of thorns, for ties that bind. Six peppermint flowers, twelve of the leaves for a healing heart. A dash of moonstone dust for a calm mind. And the ripped off corner piece of the lonely, drunken man’s coveted love letter to his wife as the tether.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And after 10 long days- Viola! Draco’s very own version of Amortentia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco tells him it’ll only be temporary. All the potion will allow is for her to remember what she loves most in this world. He tells him it’s a real possibility that it won’t be him anymore. He made it to show her true feelings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The drunk doesn’t care. He said he’d do anything. He’ll pay, whatever Draco wanted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco thinks of him on quiet days. Thinks that maybe he took advantage and should have left well alone. He had paid him handsomely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without him, Draco would have had to start stooping down to ask Barns for food, and he refused to fall that low. Regardless of the fact that he knew the old brute wouldn’t have denied him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, occasionally he’ll see the forlorn drunk pass the window of Roscoes, sober and laughing, with a young vibrant woman on his arm, smiling prettily up at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And he remembers, no. He’s doing good. Even if it never started that way. It was never his intention. He was doing this world a little bit of good.</p>
