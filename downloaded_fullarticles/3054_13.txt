    <p>Albus Dumbledore stared at his friend and colleague in disbelief. "You? You actually did that?" He asked.</p><p>The man across from him who is Severus Snape, scowled. "I was bombarded by teachers and students staring at us," he said.</p><p>"You do realize if a student is seventeen, he/she is an adult? There is no rule at Hogwarts for a relationship between teacher and student, as long as the student is an adult," Albus said.</p><p>Severus gaped at him. Is HE encouraging this?! "Albus, you put the mistletoe right there at the entrance of the Great Hall! I have no choice but to kiss.… Harry Potter," he said in disgraced.</p><p>"You could have walked out," Albus replies casually.</p><p>"I'll be followed by students and teachers! Albus, you knew about my feelings for him and you're playing matchmaker!" Severus exclaims.</p><p>Albus snorted, "I've been busy as of lately as I've been going to New York. It must have been Minerva," he said as he was going to give something huge for Minerva as thanks.</p><p>Severus sighed, "I hate you at times," he muttered.</p><p>Albus smirked, "What are you going to do about Harry Potter now?" He asked.</p><p>"Nothing, the boy have looked at me in disgust," Severus said.</p><p>---------</p><p>"K-I-S-S-I-N-G, first comes love…." Draco Malfoy's voice sang out in a teasing voice as he walks past by Harry and his friends in the hallway. </p><p>"SHUT UP, MALFOY!" Harry Potter roared out angrily as Draco and his gang laughed as they walked away.</p><p>"Just ignore them, Harry," Hermione Granger said soothingly as she patted him on the back.</p><p>"Hermione, you aren't there in the dormitory, but the other guys stares at Harry in distaste. Neville Longbottom is the only one who speaks to Harry and I," Ron Weasley said.</p><p>"I find that hard to believe," Hermione said.</p><p>"Seamus didn't want to go near me," Harry replied.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth as she was going to say something but stopped as they have arrived at the classroom of Severus Snape.</p><p>"Seventh year and we still have to take defense class, we defeated Voldemort," Ron complained.</p><p>"You aren't taken potions with him anymore," Hermione said.</p><p>Ron sighed, "If only Slughorn wasn't here…."</p><p>The group of friends opened the door and saw their classmates were already there. Everyone was laughing at something but soon stopped when Harry and his friends walked inside.</p><p>"Hey Potter! I didn't know you liked to be bottom!" Draco's voice called out from somewhere within the classroom.</p><p>Harry looks up and saw the chalkboard had a crude drawing of him and Professor Snape. The picture was moving and he could clearly see that Severus was fucking him from behind.</p><p>Harry wanted to punch Malfoy even though he knew he might not be the one who've done the drawing. He was going to retort something back but a voice from behind him did it first.</p><p>"It's not a very nice picture of you and I, is it, Potter? Just sticks? Clearly someone needs to be more educated in art class," the voice said.</p><p>Harry didn't want to turn around as he was a bit nervous but he looked at Ron and Hermione and saw that the two of them were staring at him with eyes widened.</p><p>"The three of you, takes your seats. As for the rest of you, you will stay two to three hours after class until someone tells me who has done the drawing. If no one speaks up until the time ends, all of you has detention with Filch this Saturday," Severus said as he was in the front of the classroom making everyone groan except Harry, Ron and Hermione.</p><p>"And I don't care if you have another class after DADA, all of you are staying, except you three," Severus said looking at the Golden Trio.</p><p>Out off the corner of his eye, Severus saw that half of the students were glaring at Pansy Parkinson and Draco Malfoy, the others were looking at Harry angrily.</p><p>Severus smirked, this should be interesting, he thought.</p><p>---------</p><p>Harry was clearly pissed. He wanted to talk with Professor Snape but the only time that he could do it was before or after dinner.</p><p>Harry sighed as Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom came walking up to him. "Um, this is for you, Harry," Neville said giving him a gift wrapped box.</p><p>"From who?" Harry asked curiously.</p><p>"He said not to tell," Neville replies and Harry knew who it was from when he said 'he.'</p><p>"Is this why you broke up with me, Harry? That you're gay?" Ginny asked.</p><p>Harry blushed red in embarrassment as soon as she asked. Luckily there wasn't anyone nearby to listen in on their conversation. "I'm not gay, Ginny. We broke up because of our differences. I'm not sure what's going on between Professor Snape and I, he was the one who kissed me and now this," Harry said sighing as he showed her the gift, "if Professor Dumbledore finds out, I'm not sure what will happen," he added.</p><p>"It's the holiday's, Harry. I'm sure the two of you will be together by the end of the year," Neville said with a smile.</p><p>"That's just it, Neville. I'm neither gay nor bisexual, I just don't know what to do," Harry said shaking his head.</p><p>"Open the gift, Harry, maybe it will lift your spirits," Ginny suggested.</p><p>Harry looks down at the gift he was holding and he did what Ginny recommended. He tore the wrappings off and opened the box.</p><p>He stares in surprised and saw it was a few quills with bottle of inks. The quill that he was using was losing some feathers, and the black inks he had were almost gone. How did Professor Snape know?</p><p>The quills weren't ordinary quills either. It was customized as he saw his initials near the tip. The shop in Hogsmeade didn't do customization, so where did he buy them?</p><p>"See Harry, he loves you," Neville said with a teasing smile.</p><p>Harry frowned, the word 'love' was a bit strong as he still wasn't sure what this was between he and Professor Snape.</p>
