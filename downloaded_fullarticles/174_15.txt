    <p>Mrs Jones: So this afternoon, after lunch...<br/>
Fred: Woooooowwwwww.<br/>
George: We never knew the afternoon came after lunch.<br/>
All the students laugh. Harry and Hattie lean across the the table to give Fred and George high fives.<br/>
Mrs Jones: That's enough. We will be doing S.R.E. boys will be going next door to Mr Brown's classroom and girls will be staying here.<br/>
Sycamore: Miss where should I go? I'm non binary. <br/>
Mrs Jones: You need to go next door with the other boys.<br/>
Harry: Miss do you want to come up with a decent solution or are we all going to sit here?<br/>
Mrs Jones: Right I will be calling home to your parents tonight.<br/>
Harry: You do that. They're not going to care. I was sticking up for another student. If anything, they'll praise me.<br/>
Mrs Jones: I will call your parents, Sycamore, to see what they suggest. <br/>
Ash: They're at a conference in Australia for three weeks. Good luck reaching them.<br/>
Mrs Jones: Both of them?<br/>
Sycamore: Yep.<br/>
Mrs Jones: Well who do I call?<br/>
Fred, George, Harry, Hattie: Ghostbusters!<br/>
Mrs Jones: If you four will not be quite you will get after school detention.<br/>
Harry: We're getting the tube home Miss.<br/>
Hattie: You can't do that.<br/>
Fred: And we're going with them...<br/>
George: So you can't do that to us either.</p>
