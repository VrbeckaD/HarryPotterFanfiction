</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean I have to work with Snape?” Hermione Granger snapped at her boss, Dottie Murphy, while they lunched together in the Ministry’s overcrowded and loud canteen.</p><p>“Keep your voice down,” Murphy hissed from across the tiny round table.</p><p>“Is this why you were so insistent on having lunch here in the cafeteria?” Hermione seethed, her grimace displaying all of her teeth.  Yes, Hermione had been ignoring Murphy’s missives but to stoop so low to use the much-anticipated Pasty Cart Day against her felt like an unscrupulous attack.  Hermione found herself cursing her stomach’s demands for a cheese-filled pasty, and not for the first time in this lifetime either.</p><p>“What?  Of course not.”  Murphy’s blue eyes slid away from Hermione’s to study a spot on the wall intently.  “Can’t a boss just invite one of her charges out to -” Murphy sighed heavily, and grumbled something that was lost amongst the workplace chatter before crossing her arms.  “Fine!” she blurted out.  “Yes, I couldn’t count on you to not walk away -”</p><p>Hermione halted mid-rise.</p><p>“- nor could I trust you to not make a scene.”</p><p>“I don’t make scenes!” Hermione cried, gathering the attention of several other Ministry employees from the surrounding tables; their conversations and cutlery stopping abruptly.</p><p>“Sit your arse down, Granger,” Murphy scolded quietly.</p><p>Irritated, Hermione sat heavily and pushed her tray away suddenly losing her appetite.  She’d admit she has had a few rough months professionally.  If she were being honest with herself, it all started to go to pot after the heartbreaking outcome of the assignment in Lancaster the previous August.  She still hadn’t forgiven that harebrained Carr for not following protocol and losing a key witness for a week.  Since then, Hermione had little satisfaction from her work with the Department; it more closely resembling her idea of hell because it was one mundane errand after another. Worse, every partner she'd been forced to work with made her lose a little more faith in her fellow Wizarding kind, as she had no idea as to how such a string of muffin-headed ninnyhammers had ever been accepted to the prestigious Department of Mysteries.  <i>This</i>, though, felt like a punishment she hadn’t yet deserved.  Hermione whined, “I don’t want to work with him.  You can’t make me.”</p><p>A crooked smile slid across Murphy’s face.  “Oh, but I can.”</p><p>Hermione’s glare could have killed an Acromantula at twenty paces but somehow Murphy was peskily immune to it.  “I concede,” Hermione began slowly, “that while you <i>can</i>, because you’re my boss, you still wouldn’t do this to me.”</p><p>“And why not?”</p><p>Hermione’s voice became more shrill as she went on, “Because you - you - you’re my friend!  And friends don’t force friends to work with caustic bastards!”</p><p>Weary, Murphy sighed.  “Look, Hermione -”</p><p>Hermione cut her off harshly, “No, don’t do that.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Use my name.  I won’t do this.  No matter if you drop the Granger as if you’re asking me a personal favour.”  She leaned away from Murphy, distancing herself from the conversation the only way she could.</p><p>“Look,” Murphy repeated.  “This <i>is</i> a personal favour.  Nobody else will work with him.”</p><p>In any other circumstance, her admission would have made Hermione chuckle darkly.  Snape had developed quite a reputation for being completely insufferable to work alongside over the last several years.  “And how is that my problem?”</p><p>“Ever since the Windereme Kelpie Riot the Ministry has mandated that everyone must be accompanied in the field, you know that.”</p><p>Hermione shuddered, recalling the group of Unspeakables that they were unable to retrieve from the lake; presumably, they had been either drowned horrifically, or transformed into kelpies themselves.  Her ire began to deflate, the emotion draining out of her voice, “I have yet to see how Snape not working well with others is <i>my</i> problem.”</p><p>“Because -” Murphy leaned in closer and whispered, “Because nobody else is willing to work with you either.”</p><p>Hermione’s anger rebounded.  “WHAT?” she yelled as she stood straight up, attracting the attention of several more Ministry members than before.</p><p>“<i>Sit down</i>,” Murphy hissed, waving her hands at the others in a desperate attempt to clear the air of the attention that Hermione was bringing to their table.</p><p>Instead of returning to her seat Hermione splayed her hands on the surface between them and leaned down into Murphy’s space, her wild, curly hair sparking in a warning.  Hermione’s voice was careful but acidic when she asked, “And what exactly do you mean by <i>that</i>?”</p><p>“This,” Murphy responded simply, her gaze tired.  “Nobody,” she waved around the room before gesturing back to Hermione.  “Wants to work with all of <i>this</i>.”</p><p>Hermione took pride in her self-confidence, but the criticism stung.  She’d admit her patience had been considerably shorter for idiots disguised as colleagues, but certainly, she hadn’t exhausted the entire Unspeakable Employee Roster.  No matter if it was an exaggeration or not, Hermione didn’t like the implications of it.  She lowered herself slowly to her seat and then smoothed her hair down from its Medusa-like state.  Biting her thumbnail, Hermione asked, “And that’s relevant to me working with Snape because?”</p><p>Murphy was quiet for a moment as she planned her words carefully.  “You’re just as difficult to work with as Snape is.  Neither of you has received a decent partner evaluation for over six months.  You really need a good one - Bates is at the end of his patience now - and there isn’t anyone else available to give you this chance.”</p><p>Hermione sighed and rolled her eyes skyward.  Wasn’t the quality of her work enough?  Didn’t Hermione do what was asked of her and often times more?  Why was a bloody fucking evaluation about her compatibility as a team player so important?  And why did that matter at all to the Department of Mysteries Head Rowan <i>Fucking</i> Bates?</p><p>“And if I refuse to work with Snape, or <i>worse</i>, receive another bad evaluation?” Hermione asked sarcastically.</p><p>“It’s simple,” Murphy said, finally returning to her once warm cornish pasty.  “You’re fired.”</p><p>“<i>WHAT</i> -” Hermione yelled, standing up again, hair once more becoming unwieldy; the curls twisting into sinister-like shapes as it winded towards the woman sitting across the table.</p><p>“FOR THE FINAL TIME, <i>SIT DOWN</i>!” Murphy bellowed, attracting the attention of not only the Ministry employees on the far side of the room, who up to that point were leisurely enjoying their imported lamingtons and Tim Tams, but also the people in the conference space across the corridor from the canteen. Indeed, enough of a stink was being made that their workmates sitting at adjacent tables suddenly realised that they were all running late for important appointments, and were abandoning their trays in their haste to get out of the line of fire.</p><p>Hermione lowered herself back in her seat across from Murphy.  Her jaw cracked under the pressure of her gritted teeth and her hair flounced into belligerent compliance.  “Fine.”</p><p>“Fine?” Murphy asked surprised.</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione hissed.  “Fine.  I’ll do the blasted assignment with Snape.  However, I don’t believe he’ll give me any praise on my evaluation so I might as well start looking for work as a Flobberworm Milker, or something equally as important.”</p><p>Murphy took a bite of her pasty.  “I wouldn’t go that far, Granger.”</p><p>“And why the bloody fuck not?” she asked, annoyance blooming in her voice. </p><p>“Because Snape is under the same pressure as you are.  He also needs a good evaluation to stay afloat.  Odds are that he’d write you a good one if you return the favour.  That’s all I need to show Bates.  He doesn’t need to know that it was under duress.”</p><p>“So basically, your tactic to guarantee this success is to put your two most desperate people on a team together and hope we don’t kill each other?”</p><p>Murphy shrugged carelessly.  “Yes.”</p><p>“Your Hufflepuffian managerial style leaves a lot to be desired,” Hermione grumbled.  </p><p>“Interesting,” Murphy said as she stood with her empty tray.  “Snape said the same thing.  At the very least I can say that I am consistent.”</p><p>“And what did <i>he</i> think of this?”</p><p>Murphy began to walk away to dispose of her tray at the washing station.  Over her shoulder she said, “He actually took it better than you, if one can credit it.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione rapped on the door of the tiny conference room before entering.  This particular row of conference rooms was available exclusively for Unspeakables to privately analyse research, discuss covert assignments, and work on their incommunicable devices.  The only downside to the privacy was that the rooms were always in high demand, and therefore could only be reserved for fifteen minutes at a time. They’d have to make this little tête-à-tête brief.</p><p>Upon her admittance into the room she noted that Snape was casually standing behind the chair at the other side of the table.  His stance was surprisingly relaxed, one hand’s long fingers were curled loosely over the backrest as he watched her enter.  This was unexpected; Hermione had anticipated that he would be a bit more miffed about this working arrangement.</p><p>“Snape,” Hermione greeted evenly, unsure if this was a trap, as she shut the door behind her.  </p><p>“Granger,” Snape said with a small tip of his head as he fanned out some papers from a folder across the table.</p><p>Carefully, she began, “I suppose you already know that -”</p><p>“We are two of the most detested members of the staff?” Snape finished curtly, his shoulders suddenly growing stiff.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to go that far but -”</p><p>“And what dripping Gryffindor sentiment are you going to supply there?”  His voice rose an octave as he mocked her, “Let it roll off your back Snape, you’re still a hero?”</p><p>Hermione’s ire flashed through her.  “No.  I was going to agree with you, you giant git, and promise to write you a fair evaluation quid pro quo.”</p><p>Snape spun around, his outer robe billowing eerily similar to how it did at Hogwarts nearly two decades ago.  He walked over to the windows overlooking the Ministry’s inner courtyard.  Snape bent slightly, angling himself to better look up into the sky.  His dark silhouette cut across the glare of the sun filtering into the room. </p><p>Bewildered, she muttered, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Still facing the window, his hands gripping the sill, Snape uttered, “A Gryffindor not only agreed with me before I had to literally perform self-defenestration but also is willing to hoodwink an authority figure.  I was wondering if pigs had really started to fly.”</p><p>Without missing a beat Hermione said, “Only if you go to Ms Szimonetta’s Olde Fashioned Petting Zoo.  She enjoys porcine entertainment.  Dresses them in fairy costumes, I think.  Honestly, I try not to look out the window when she starts, I don’t want to give her the attention.”</p><p>Her words hung in the air for a moment without a reaction.  Slowly, Snape turned around to face Hermione again, an eyebrow raised. “I can’t tell if you’re being facetious and that unnerves me.”</p><p>Hermione felt a little powerful - a little more in control - because she had thrown Snape off by playing <i>with</i> him rather than against him.  Was that all that needed to be done to ensure a camaraderie with the man?</p><p>She shrugged and smirked.  “She’s my neighbour in Richmond.”  Before picking up a photograph on the table, Hermione lowered her voice and whispered conspiratorially, “To be fair, she only does costumes on the weekends.”  Hermione’s smile slipped away as she began to flip through several photos of familiar faces.  “Why are there headshots of famous Muggle actors in this file?”  Included in the photographs was a drawing by an Auror Sketch Artist that looked quite similar to one of the actors.</p><p>“People of interest,” Snape said without explanation as he folded his lean frame in the chair across from her.</p><p>“That’s a succinct way of putting it,” Hermione remarked.  She moved to slide the case file out of the folder laying on the table between them, but Snape snatched it away first.  “Haven’t you ever heard of chivalry?” her tone cutting.</p><p>“That would imply that you’re a lady,” Snape said snidely as his dark eyes danced across the form.  “<i>Ladies</i> generally don’t set people on fire, people - I’ll have you mind - that were attempting to save the pyromaniac’s best friend, nor do they ingest amateur potions made in a toilet, and they most definitely do not hex an acquaintance at a quarterly departmental meeting.”</p><p>Hermione huffed and leaned over the table.  With two fingers she plucked the paper out of his hands.  Ignoring his rising aggravation, she muttered, “Then, it sounds like you’ve never been in the presence of a <i>lady</i> before now.”</p><p>Snape snorted.  “I’m sure Narcissa would be insulted by that.”</p><p>“Good,” Hermione replied bluntly.  “She is a turnip toff of the worst kind and a…”  but she trailed off as she read through the case file’s details.</p><p> </p>

  <i><b>Request for Additional Support: Department of Mysteries, Ninth Floor</b><br/>
<b>Witness:</b> Madam Ophelia Price, Distinguished Gentlewoman of Elite class and of the Macmillan family<br/>
<b>Date of Initial Report:</b> 19 July 2018<br/>
<b>Nature of Complaint:</b> Public Disturbance<br/>
<b>Location of Incident:</b> Gracechurch Street, London (cross street Leadenhall)<br/>
<b>Description of Incident:</b> Price claims she saw someone dressed in Wizarding robes outside of Diagon Alley in the middle of London. [See enclosed sketch.] Price attempted to approach, to chastise the unfamiliar man for drawing so much attention to himself, but then a Muggle began to “follow him with a boxed lensed machine that displayed the image of the unknown man on a flat device being held by another man”.  Price fears that magic has been discovered and is concerned about the quality of the Fidelius Charm over Diagon Alley.<br/>
<b>Additional Notes:</b> After multiple stakeouts, it has been discovered that Price stumbled on to a Muggle film set.  There are several Muggle actors and actresses [see enclosed photographs] physically similar to key players of the Voldemort Conflict from 20 years ago.  An elaborate set resembling Diagon Alley and its shops has been reconstructed near the Elstree &amp; Borehamwood Tube Station behind moderate Muggle surveillance.  It is assumed other Wizarding locations have been replicated in a similar fashion.<br/>
<b>Reasons for Additional Support:</b> The repercussions of a breach in the Statute of Secrecy to this extent is unheard of and would cause panic amongst the Wizarding population.  I request a DoM investigation to flesh out specifics and the persons responsible.<br/>
