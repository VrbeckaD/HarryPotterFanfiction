    <p>He couldn't eat. It reminded him of the many dinners he had spent at the Weasley's. Only now he was told kindly, by Mrs. Weasley of all people, that he wasnt allowed over anymore. She had told him again and again that she didn't blame him for the death of her son, but that they needed space. But Harry didn't need space. He had too much space. Grimmauld Place was big and empty. He needed hugs and reassurance. But he didn't tell her that. He just agreed and walked away from the doorstep. He had caused those people enough pain.</p><p>He couldn't read. It reminded him too much of the times he found Remus and Sirius curled up with a book. Sirius, of course, wasnt reading. He was just listening to Remus read to him. And sometimes when Harry found them, Sirius would invite him over and Remus would read a little louder so Harry could hear. Harry missed those times. They were like a little makeshift family. But he had gone off and gotten them both killed. So that was the end of that.</p><p>He couldn't smoke. It reminded him too much of the nights he and Draco would sit on the edge of the Astronomy Tower,  cigarettes in hand, and tell each other stories. Some happy, some sad. Draco would tell all about his fucked up childhood, and Harry would do the same. Sometimes they shared quick kisses. Other times it was full makeout sessions in their underwear. But after his father's imprisonment Draco had cut things off. And Harry understood why. Who would want to be with him?</p><p>He couldn't sleep. His nightmares had become too much. Sometimes they were about his parents deaths. Sometimes it was about seeing Hermione get tortured. Other times thay were about Cedric. All of them were about things that were his fault. What was his death toll now? Like 40? He was 19 years old and he had gotten 40 people killed. He was nothing. Why did people keep insisting on dying for him?</p><p>He couldn't drink. It brought back memories from the Dursley's. Memories of Vernon drinking too much and beating Harry with the bottle. Memories of that alchohol drenched breath whispering in his ear. Memories he didn't want to relive.</p><p>But he needed a pastime. TV reminded him of Tonks and her obsession with the  picture box. Drawing reminded him of Sirius's uncanny ability to replicate any picture almost perfectly. Writing reminded him of Fred's oddly perfect handwriting. Remembering things was unsafe. Especially with his fragile mental health. Any little thought could push him over the edge. And he wasnt sure he wanted to go yet.</p><p>So Harry searched for things that didn't remind him of his failures. That turned out to be very difficult. It seems everything he found could somehow connect to his pitiful life. So he gave up. Like always. And went back into his pathetic routine of drinking copious amounts of Dreamless Sleep potion and passing out for most of the day. Hermione, the only person who would even come near him, constantly warned him that he would overdose if he wasn't careful. But he wasn't sure if he cared.</p>
