    <p>After father had apparated him from Platform 9 3/4, back to the Manor, Draco headed almost straight off to his room. Sure, it was probably a bit childish, but hey, he was a child, he had an excuse. Time had passed since his last confrontation with his father, and Draco felt less and less like having another. His father almost certainly was hiding a whole load of dark secrets regarding the diary and the whole mess with the Heir of Slytherin, and Draco didn't much fancy dirtying himself digging through them. He figured the information wouldn't be that much use to him anyway.</p><p> </p><p>He had to come down for dinner though.</p><p>"Draco! Come, tell us about your year!" his mother gushed as she saw him arrive, "We've not seen you for months, and you've been hiding away in your room all evening!"</p><p>"I've been unpacking, mother. And you saw me at Easter."</p><p>"You don't need to unpack. That's what we have elves for. And I'd barely call our meeting at Easter getting to see you properly. We didn't get to speak without my cousin being there after all."</p><p>"You'll have heard that he did get custody of Potter, I assume," his father interjected.</p><p>"Yes. Harry was most pleased. Thank you for your assistance with the matter," Draco replied, giving his father a stare to make clear his thanks were not sincere.</p><p>"I'm glad I could be of help."</p><p> </p><p>Mother brought the topic of conversation back to Draco and his school year. He gave them a brief and edited summary. When he got to the part about the Chamber of Secrets, he mentioned how Ginny Weasley had been possessed by a form of Voldemort via a diary, but did not mention where she acquired it. His mother sounded pretty horrified by it all, and seemingly naïve of the details she hadn't already heard about. Draco hoped that she had been completely innocent in the matter, that his father had been acting alone (whatever his precise involvement was), but deep inside he knew he might never know for sure. He'd always known she was better at keeping secrets than father.</p><p> </p><p>The next day at breakfast, mother brought up the subject of Draco's birthday. Last year the three of them had just spent the day together whilst in France. He'd had a cake and special tea (and of course gifts), but they hadn't made an especially big deal of it.</p><p>"You're going to be 13 this year darling! My little Dragon's growing up! We'll have to do something special to mark the occasion!"</p><p>"Can I have my friends round?"</p><p>"Yes, we could have a party, invite all your classmates round for tea!" <em>The wording of that seems… suspicious. As if she's thinking just Slytherins.</em></p><p>"Including Harry, Ron and Hermione of course? They are my best friends after all."</p><p>"I'm not so sure that…" father began.</p><p>"Of course darling!" mother interrupted. "It's your birthday after all. You can invite all your friends." <em>Has she finally accepted that I'm friends with the Gryffindors? Or is she plotting something?</em></p><p> </p><p>So in the end, invites went out to his three Gryffindor friends, as well as all the other Slytherins in his year. He didn't really speak much with all of them, but his parents seemed to want to invite most of them, and he didn't want to be seen as snubbing any of them by leaving them out. The combination of Slytherins and Gryffindors might end up being a bit… awkward. Draco just hoped no untoward incidents broke out between them. He'd settle for glares and muttered insults, as long as no wands were drawn. <em>I really need to start making some friends in other Houses to act as buffers</em>. He'd made a start at befriending Lovegood, he supposed, but he wasn't sure how effective a buffer she would be if he had known her well enough to invite her. He wouldn't be totally surprised if the girl had the ability to make tensions worse somehow.</p><p> </p><p>He received letters accepting his invitation from most of the Slytherins, and from Ron and Hermione (who was in fact the first to reply). However, after a few days, he received a letter from Harry saying that Sirius was not keen on Harry attending. It sounded like Harry had been trying to argue, but his Godfather wasn't budging. "I<strong><em>'ve been trying to tell him that you're my friend and I trust you, but Sirius is still quite paranoid. He doesn't trust your father, and says he doesn't think it's safe for me to go round to your house. I've told him he's being ridiculous, but I'm trying not to fight with him. He's been so kind to me, and living with him is great. I just wish he'd understand not all Slytherins are like his family were</em></strong>." <em>Has he forgotten that technically, I am a Slytherin who is his family?</em></p><p> </p><p>Draco decided the best person to discuss this with would be mother. Hopefully she might be able to resolve the situation diplomatically. Sirius seemed to hate her slightly less than he hated father anyway (they'd managed to meet without killing each other after all).</p><p> </p><p>He wasn't sure precisely what she'd said to Sirius, but a few days later she announced that Harry would be indeed attending Draco's party, and that Sirius would be accompanying him. It sounded like that was their compromise. It might well be a disaster waiting to happen, but maybe it would make the party entertaining.</p><p> </p><p>The elves were set to making sure the manor was in tip-top condition, ready for Draco's party (despite the fact his mother expected that of them all year round). They all seemed excited. They liked getting to show off their hard work to guests.</p><p> </p><p>Well, all except Dobby.</p><p> </p><p>Draco found the eccentric elf muttering to himself whilst supposedly dusting the library.</p><p> </p><p>"Good afternoon Dobby," Draco decided to open with (<em>What the hell has happened to me? I'm being polite to a House Elf!)</em></p><p>"Good afternoon Master Draco," the elf replied, sounding slightly embarrassed that Draco might have overheard him complaining.</p><p>"What's the matter?" (<em>Might as well at least try and deal with whatever the elf has a problem with, before he manages to cause more chaos</em>.)</p><p>"You is having a party."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And Harry Potter will be coming."</p><p>"Yes, amongst other people." He looked at the elf. He looked upset. "What's the problem? You like Harry. Don't you want to see him?"</p><p>"Dobby would be honoured to see Harry Potter. But Dobby wants Harry Potter to be safe."</p><p>"What do you mean? Why wouldn't Harry be safe?"</p><p>"Because…" the elf began, only to stop and start bashing himself over the head with a rather large hardback tome.</p><p>"Dobby, do you know of something? A threat to Harry? A threat at my party?"</p><p>"Not a specific threat, no…"</p><p>"Is this just about everything with my father and the diary and that whole mess at school?" Dobby didn't say anything, but he didn't deny it either, so Draco took that as a yes.</p><p>"I will make sure nothing happens to Harry at my party. I promise. He's my friend. Please don't go doing anything to try and stop him from coming. If you hear of anything that worries you about Harry, come to me.</p><p>"But Dobby might not be able to. Not if Master…"</p><p>"Not if father tells you not to say anything," Draco finished for him. "Yes, that's a problem. Leave it with me."</p><p> </p><p>It took Draco a little while, but he came up with a plan. Not necessarily a good plan. Not a plan he ever expected to make. But a plan nevertheless.</p><p> </p><p>"Father. I am going to be 13 this year," he announced over dinner, using his best 'child pretending to be an adult' voice.</p><p>"Yes, I am aware."</p><p>"I will be a teenager. Nearly an adult. I need to start knowing how to be an adult. I need my own House Elf. One that listens to me, and just to me."</p><p>"But darling, the elves listen to you," his mother interrupted. "Has one of them been giving you problems? Do I need to have a word."</p><p>"No. But one day I will run a household, and all the elves will answer to me. It's time I got to experience giving orders properly. I need my own elf."</p><p>"I can see what I can do," father replied, "but elves can be difficult to source, particularly at short notice."</p><p>"I want Dobby."</p><p>"What!?"</p><p>"I want Dobby?"</p><p>"Dobby? But he's not a very good elf. Maybe we could see about one of the other elves working for you."</p><p>"No, I want Dobby."</p><p>"But Dobby doesn't obey orders well. He's a bit… deficit. You won't get good experience of what it is like mastering proper elves."</p><p>"You think I can't do it. You think I'm a child," Draco pouted, giving it all he had.</p><p>"No, but…" his father began, only to be interrupted by mother.</p><p>"If you really want Dobby, then you can have him darling. But are you sure? It's not as easy it you might think, being a master of an elf. Particularly one like Dobby. You'll need to be able to give him strict instructions. And discipline him when he doesn't obey."</p><p>"Thank you mother! Yes, I'm sure. I know I am more than up to the challenge."</p><p> </p><p>And so that is how Draco acquired himself a House Elf. A deranged House Elf, who was obsessed with one of his best friends, and came up with crazy plans like nearly killing him with rogue quidditch equipment in order to "keep him safe". <em>What have I let myself in for?</em></p>
