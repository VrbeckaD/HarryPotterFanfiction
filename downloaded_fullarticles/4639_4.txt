  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>“Well, I can’t exactly take Jacob,” Queenie says. “Can I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The corner of Credence’s mouth flinches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” she says. “I didn’t mean it like that, Credence, it’s just… I don’t want to go by myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An invitation for Quintessence Deborah Goldstein and one guest sits on the table between them. Credence watches a little broomstick made of ink fly across the top left corner. The MACUSA seal glitters in a way that likely isn’t menacing to anyone else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And besides, it’s a costume ball,” she says. “No one’s gonna know that it’s you. You could be <em>anybody</em>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Credence says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A week later, Tina stops by his apartment above the bookshop where Augustus Worme’s sister-in-law employs him out of the kindness of her heart. Credence cannot imagine any other reason for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Tina says. “Any big plans for Halloween?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie invited me to something,” Credence tells her. The cup for his coffee doesn’t match the one in Tina’s hand. The percolator is borrowed from Beatrice Grimsditch, the owner of Grims Book Store and Credence’s employer as well as his downstairs neighbor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The store sees a lot of customers from MACUSA’s investigations department, and Tina’s regular presence raises no one’s suspicions. Even Seraphina Picquery counts herself as a loyal customer since her school days. All this Credence has heard from Mrs. Grimsditch whenever they are between customers and he has an open ear for her stories about America’s oldest magical families. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence often recognizes people from the back of the print shop — the sounds of their voices and the glimpses of faces — but pretends that he does not. He’s always been good at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina’s shoulders slump when she sighs. Credence glances down into his coffee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Tina says, “so much for that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only because she isn’t comfortable inviting Jacob,” Credence says. “Since it’s a magical event.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two years of knowing the truth about witches and wizards have not made the rules of this secret part of New York City any easier to understand — perhaps because Credence has spent much of that time anywhere but America. All the places he’s been, but he couldn’t find a home anywhere but New York.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure how it’s any safer to take you,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one knows me,” Credence says. “And I don’t know anyone but Queenie and you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina lifts her chin and gives Credence a hesitant smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true,” she says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence does not return her smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” she says, after enough silence, “what are you going as?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Going as?” he repeats.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Queenie would help you make any costume you wanted,” Tina says. “Or she’ll just pick one for you if you don’t. She did that to me the first year we were both invited.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did that go well?” Credence asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina’s mouth twists up for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” she says. “I guess?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next week, Credence heads to the 600 block of W 24th Street, to the bit of Chelsea that only exists for those with magic, carrying a stack of decidedly unmagical periodicals. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie invites him in for dinner and afterwards they sit with cocoa and talk lightly about Jacob’s bakery and the seamstress shop where Modesty has an apprenticeship, as though these aren’t names that make their tongues stumble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering if you could help me make a costume for the ball,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sets down his mug of cocoa. “If you still wanted me to go with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!” Queenie says. She brushes Credence’s concerns off with the wave of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s see what you’ve got.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picks up the magazines and looks at the cover of each, one by one. Credence sits with his knees together, watching her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” Queenie says, “this isn’t really the sorta stuff I thought you’d be into.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t know if that’s a bad thing or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just so solemn all the time,” she says, “so grave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The slight downturn of his mouth certainly proves her point, but Credence can’t help frowning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think I should go as something else?” he asks. “Is this too hard to make?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Queenie says. She drops the magazines onto her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you oughta be a masked hero if that’s what you wanna be,” she says. “We just gotta get you the right hat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grins at him, all teeth and pink lipstick. Hesitantly, Credence smiles back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the 31st of October, Beatrice Grimsditch asks Credence to close up the shop early. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” she says, “treat those Goldstein girls right, don’t go leading them on just because you’re a handsome young man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She fixes Credence’s collar while he tries not to swallow his own tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re friends,” he says, while Mrs. Grimsditch whisks a bit of book dust off his jacket with the wave of her wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nods her grey head and hums something in the back of her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have a wonderful time,” she says, “and a happy Halloween! I still remember the MACUSA masquerade of 1864.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence hears the whole story before he makes it out of the book shop. By the time he gets to Chelsea, the sun has already started to set. He climbs the fire escape and taps on the Goldsteins’ window with his knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re here!” Queenie says dragging the window open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reaches out to hug him with a dagger in her right hand. Credence hesitates, but still puts his arms around her. The gauzy fabric hanging from her headdress covers Credence’s face for a moment, turning the interior of the apartment a lovely shade of lavender. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you have a knife?” he asks, after she helps him into the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” Queenie says. “I never told you what my costume is, did I? I’m Juliet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lifts the dagger above her breasts in their laced-up, lavender bodice and feigns a sigh. For a moment, her pink mouth drops into a pouting frown. Her eyes shine with unshed tears. Then, just as quickly, Queenie lowers her hand and lifts her chin. She smiles and it transforms her from tragedy to beauty as she smooths down the skirt of her dress, which falls just below her knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look beautiful,” Credence tells her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiles. “You’re too sweet!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina comes out of her bedroom wearing an evening gown speckled with dull, metallic scales. At first glance, Queenie’s costume is the most beautiful and compelling. But after Tina’s hugged him, Credence sees the little wings stitched to the straps of her dress at the back. They flap slightly when she moves, to match the swish of the tail that hangs from the belt around her hips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a dragon,” she says, smiling. She draws a mask down from on top of her head and covers half her face in scales and spikes. For a moment, her dark eyes flash red.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she lifts the mask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it dumb? It seems kind of dumb.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Actually,” Credence says, “it’s a little frightening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” she says. Her hand goes to her belt and she picks at a metal scale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The most magical thing about Credence’s costume is how much it makes him look like someone else. The black fabric of his mask covers his hair and half his face — all except his nose and mouth. He didn’t shave in the morning, so stubble peppers his jaw and cheeks in a way that looks unfamiliar on him. The wide-brimmed hat perfectly matches the mask and the rest of his black clothes. Once night falls, Credence will just about disappear into the dark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie ties a red sash around his waist. He adjusts it a few times while she and Tina argue about turning a knitting needle into a sword.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s got to have a real one,” Queenie says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He could hurt someone with it,” Tina insists. “Or himself!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s not gonna do that,” Queenie tells her. “Besides, you’re the one who could have added some fire-breathing to her costume and didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I’m not a total lunatic,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, Teenie, some of us actually wanna have fun tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence tucks the hilt of the sword against his side using his sash like a belt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie slips a royal purple mask over her eyes and smiles at him. “Ready to go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence chooses not to apparate on his own, though there’s no need for a license here in New York City. He knows how. But there’s a moment in the darkness where he worries he’ll forget he has a body if he doesn’t have someone’s hand in his. Tonight, Queenie has his right hand and Tina, his left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both sisters hold tight enough to keep him from staggering forward into the couple who has just apparated in a moment earlier. The woman turns and looks at Credence disapprovingly; even the gaping maw of a jack-o’-lantern on her skirt turns into a frown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are going to be a <em>lot</em> of people here,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pretty much everybody who works in the whole Congress,” Queenie adds. “Plus their dates.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pinches the fabric of Credence’s sleeve and smiles at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got the cutest one,” she says, her nose wrinkling up from the force of her smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina sighs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Queenie hooks her arm around Credence’s elbow, he offers his other to Tina. She rolls her eyes slightly, but smiles as she puts her arm in his. This is, perhaps, the most popular that he can ever recall being — though he knows he is not either Goldstein sister’s first choice. He is the convenient option. The alternative slightly better than going alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop that,” Queenie says. Her elbow touches Credence’s side like a warning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Tina asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They follow the disgruntled jack-o’-lantern all the way into the Woolworth Building, where a towering suit of armor accepts the invitations from Queenie and Tina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And guest,” Queenie says, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The armor nods with the harsh sound of metal scraping against metal. It moves a massive glaive from the door and allows the three of them to pass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looks up first and then up and up and up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moon looks hung like a chandelier at the center of the ceiling with blazing, burning stars that glint in greens and purples swirling all around. His lips part as a dark cloud passes over the brightness of the moon and bursts into hundreds of bats. An owl swoops through the dark, chasing down one hapless bat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence’s lips part slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really something, ain’t it?” Queenie says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’ve reached a banquet table stretched twenty feet or more. She hands him a glass shaped like a cauldron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s cranberry,” she says, as the drink bubbles and smokes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Above the table, black candles float as easily as fireflies. The food looks almost frightening under the flickering orange light they cast. The moon casts a silver-white spotlight out over a dance floor populated with actual goblins as well as a few humans pretending. There are gossamer winged fairies and someone that Credence thinks is supposed to be Dorcus Twelvetrees — or else she simply has an uncanny resemblance to the portraits in the history books Grims carries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A couple perched on a broomstick take a low sweep over the dancers. Credence can see them kissing with their skirts tangled up. As astonished as he is by their elaborate pirate costumes — complete with shining cutlasses — he doesn’t think about the matter of two women kissing so passionately until they are long gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie sips her still smoking drink with a straw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t expect things to be this… wild already,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s Halloween, Teenie!” Queenie says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulls a pin from her hair then, one of the long ones holding her headpiece in place, and dunks it into Credence’s drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” he says, both confused and disgusted. Then she takes out her wand and the hairpin quickly turns into a straw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I find a blonde hair in my drink,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll think of me fondly,” Queenie says. “Isn’t that right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence can hardly hear her over the exuberant music, so he doesn’t try to respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A woman walks past in a glittering black gown that drapes low on her narrow chest. The man holding her arm has a shirt that hangs open even lower. Credence looks at the moonlight glancing off his skin as much as he looks at the pair’s massive bat-like wings that stretch up over their heads.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie!” someone shrieks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looks over to find a woman wearing a dress of white feathers. Her cloche has even more feathers and an actual chicken’s head. Credence puts his straw in his mouth and sips his bubbling drink so that he doesn’t ask her what butcher shop gave her all those feathers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jenny!” Queenie says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman kisses Queenie’s cheek and Credence sees the chicken’s eye open and close. The hat makes a soft crooning sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Brigid is around here somewhere too,” Jenny says. “She turned her favorite wool coat into a lamb for her Bo Peep costume, but now of course she’s lost it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie hides her laugh behind her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, who are you?” Jenny says. She doesn’t so much as glance at Credence, so he continues to sip his drink. It’s rather tart, but the fizz at the back of his tongue is pleasant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juliet!” Queenie says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And this is Romeo?” Jenny asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looks at Credence and he takes the straw out of his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he says. “Zorro.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Jenny asks. She tilts her head and her chicken hat squawks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence tries to withdraw his sword from his sash, but it catches and he nearly spills his drink on himself for his trouble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a No-Maj character from one of those pulp magazines,” Queenie says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Jenny says. “I don’t read any of the No-Maj pulps. They’re kind of boring, I think, the pictures don’t even move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Letting go of the hilt of his sword, Credence puts the straw of his drink back in his mouth and slurps up the last of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come dance with me!” Jenny says. “Both of you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabs Queenie’s hand, but Queenie does not grab Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bernard is here as the Green Knight,” he hears Jenny say as she pulls Queenie away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At a distance, Queenie looks over her shoulder and mouths, “Sorry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want another drink?” Tina asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looks over and finds her holding a small plate piled with oyster shells, tiny pies and a few sausages wrapped in dough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s actual food?” he asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at this table,” Tina says. “I just got back from the one over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gestures with her thumb, but all Credence sees in that direction is so many bodies in so many colorful costumes. He feels dizzy with the variety — or the flickering light from so many bobbing candles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The brightest of all the costumes Credence notices is a man all in red, from his hat to his cape to his stockings. Credence watches until the man turns and sees that his face is completely covered with a mask carved like a skull. The breath catches in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not accurate to the film, he thinks, it’s almost <em>more</em> impressive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina hands him an oyster on the half-shell and Credence tips it into his mouth without even thinking. He barely tastes it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, the man could simply be dressed as the Red Death from the story. But Edgar Allan Poe wasn’t a wizard, was he? Someone would have mentioned that, Credence thinks. Was Shakespeare a witch?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death turns with a sweep of his bright cape and disappears further into the darkness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to get something else to drink,” Tina says. “Come with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She offers Credence her bare elbow. Her eyes are brightly crimson behind her mask, but he can still see the shape of them change when she smiles at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Past the dance floor and behind the band performing on a massive stage decorated like a gallows, Tina leads him to a bar carved with knights and wizards who seem to gaze upward in judgment at the costumed partygoers drinking before them. Credence notes a woman draped in a spider’s webs of netting with a few extra pairs of blinking eyes on her cap. Beside her, a woman in a pink, feathered dress and matching casque speaks with a man wearing a suit made of crossword puzzles that fill themselves out while Credence watches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you feel like?” Tina asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Overwhelmed,” Credence says, after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Tina says. “Alright, fair. I’ll just get you some water then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nudges a few people out of the way, but Credence stands a step behind her. He glances this way and that, as much as he can without turning his head or staring. A group of men dressed like Puritans drink something that’s obviously alcoholic, given the ruddy flush on their cheeks and noses. Credence thinks there’s probably something humorous about that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina hands him a goblet filled with water. A piece of ice carved like a skull floats in the center of it. Credence carefully moves the straw Queenie made him from the empty cauldron to his new drink. Then he reaches over Tina’s shoulder to leave the cauldron where a barback can take it away. He doesn’t want to cause a hassle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I guess it would be stupid to ask if you’re having fun,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Credence says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sips his water from the straw and watches Tina knock back something from a glass the size of two of her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you having fun?” he asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really,” she says. “But it’s important to be here. I even went the Halloween after I got demoted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nods. Tina blinks her red eyes at him and smiles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Actually, that year was pretty fun,” she says. “Somebody from records drank too much and cast a leavening charm that got them stuck on the chandelier — it was a giant globe that year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could say they were sitting on top of the world,” she adds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence has to laugh just a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think anyone’s going to end up on the moon this year?” he asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, probably,” Tina tells him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both look up to the ceiling and silvery, but fake moon. The light of it catches on all the facets of the ice in Credence’s glass, bringing out every tooth. He takes another sip and feels the cold shoot up to the top of his own skull.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goldstein?” someone says. “Is that you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina turns and Credence follows her gaze. The person standing there in a high collar and top hat has large, dark eyes and a broad nose. She smiles a little crookedly and dark curls peek out from beneath the edge of her hat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rodriguez?” Tina asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The one and only,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rodriguez looks at Credence and her smile slides right off her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this your date?” she asks Tina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, no,” Tina says. “This is my sister’s date.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh,” Rodriguez says, staring Credence down. He doesn’t give her the satisfaction of making him look away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I heard from somebody that Abernathy’s whining about how she won’t give him the time of day now ’cause she’s got a beau,” Rodriguez says. Her eyes narrow. Credence doesn’t blink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Tina says. “What are you? I mean, besides handsome.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughs in a way that, to Credence, sounds uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rodriguez looks away, finally, and offers Tina a bright smile. It’s still a bit slanted to one side, Credence notes. Rodriguez reaches out and snakes an arm around Tina’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a cad, darling,” Rodriguez says, her voice dropped at least an octave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina’s eyes go wide and her mouth turns into a flat line.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But not really,” Rodriguez says. Her hand moves up to Tina’s bare back between her wings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, as you can see, I’m a dragon,” Tina says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I worry about getting roasted and eaten?” Rodriguez asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Tina says. “Queenie tried to talk me into fire-breathing, but I didn’t think that was a good idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at a bar,” Rodriguez says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what I told her, but she said I’m just…” Tina lifts and then drops her hand, “boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are anything but boring,” Rodriguez says with a smile. “So, what kind of dragon are you, exactly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ironbelly,” Tina says. “Ukrainian Ironbelly. It’s the largest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And the most ferocious, right?” Rodriguez says. “Morrigan’s wand, do you remember that Chinese ring bringing Fireball eggs in through Vancouver?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What a mess that was,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Woulda been a bigger mess without you,” Rodriguez says, and Tina smiles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence turns away as they continue to talk about work and Tina leans back against Rodriguez’s arm. There’s certainly plenty of other things for him to look at. Credence watches the riotous dance floor from a safe distance. Someone in a costume with wings like a cicada clutches desperately to their dance partner’s hand to keep from floating off into the air, their wings beating rapidly. He sips his ice water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glances to the left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death appears suddenly from between the man in the crossword puzzle suit and someone dressed as a penguin. Credence blinks. For a moment, the dark eyes of the skull mask seem to catch on Credence. He notices the Red Death carries a cane, shorter than the one from the film but otherwise identical. A red gloved hand clutches the handle just beneath the skull and the white body of a snake twists around the rest of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence wants to tell whoever it is that he likes their costume. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death turns away and goes up to the bar only a foot away from Credence. He could reach out and grab him by the cape, if he wanted to. He could snatch the feather from his hat and run for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, Credence watches the Red Death lift his mask. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bare teeth of a lipless mouth part. Credence cannot hear the man speaking over the music. He is amazed the man can speak at all, looking as he does. He has no nose and hardly any cheeks. But he has dark eyes, deeply creased at the corners, and Credence feels stricken.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He lowers his drink and turns just slightly towards the man. He’s certain he knows him. He must.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The barkeep places a curvaceous glass into the Red Death’s gloved hand. The Red Death puts his mask back in place, hiding the recreation of Erik’s misshapen face. Credence opens his mouth to say something — anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Credence!” Tina says. Her hand on Credence’s shoulder makes him jump.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he says, bringing his glass up in front of his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going with Tatiane,” Tina says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come with us,” Rodriguez says. “I mean, people get all intimidated around the president, but she’s gotta be totally blotto by now. It’s our old boss who’s actually scary.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina whirls around in Rodriguez’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s here?” she asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, doll, Picquery brought him as her date again this year — though who knows why,” Rodriguez says. “But I haven’t seen him for like an hour, so maybe he left already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Tina says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looks at Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” he says. “I was going to look for a washroom anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s in the back on the left,” Rodriguez says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should come up with a place to meet,” Tina says. “Later tonight. I mean, Queenie can always find me, but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can get home on my own,” Credence says. He moves his straw slightly. The skull in his drink has melted beyond recognition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re sure?” Tina asks. “I wanted you to have a nice time tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turns toward Rodriguez, “It’s his first time coming to the masquerade.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And your sister ditched him?” Rodriguez asks. “Damn, I thought she was totally gaga over this guy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go find Queenie,” Credence says, inspired by her words. He may be lying, and the way Tina draws her brows together lets him know that she suspects as much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be fine,” he tells her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Tina says. She reaches out and touches Credence’s arm. Then Rodriguez tugs on her and Credence steps back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks over, but the Red Death, Erik, the Phantom, whoever he is, has disappeared. Credence sips his water and heads to the left. He squeezes past the penguin, ducking under the costume’s beak, and passes a girl wearing a dress painted like Eiffel Tower. He almost stops to ask if she’s seen it in person. But what if she hasn’t? He would seem arrogant if he told her that he has. He keeps walking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As though waiting for Credence, the Red Death stands in a far corner of the massive banquet hall. A candelabra as bent and dripping as a willow tree illuminates the vibrant red of his costume and the bright white of his mask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death leans his cane against the table with its lopsided candle-holder and removes his mask. Credence watches him lift his glass to his lipless mouth and then pause. In the space of a blink, the monstrous face of the phantom is replaced with one that makes Credence’s heart leap into his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His first impulse is to flee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first time Percival Graves came into Grims Book Store, Credence was up the stairs before the bell had stopped chiming above the door. The second time, Credence had only heard his voice and Mrs. Grimsditch’s from the print room in the back. Even more memories return to Credence now — not only of ducking behind towering shelves of books, but also of cobbled alleys and park benches years ago. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival Graves, dressed all in red and holding his skull-shaped mask, sips from his drink without looking up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence reaches up with a gloved hand and touches his own mask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What does it matter if Credence isn’t sure that the man he knew was ever Percival Graves? He didn’t come to this party dressed anything like Credence Barebone, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thinks of Don Diego and Lolita Pulido. It really isn’t a thought that fits Credence’s own situation. Not exactly. Or, well, not at all. But Credence didn’t put on a mask and a shirt that only buttons to the center of his chest just to act like the coward he usually is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carefully, Credence takes his sword by the hilt and slips it free from his sash. It fits well in his gloved hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From his first step, people move out of Credence’s way. He walks with his shoulders back and his chin up, but people are probably more wary of his blade than his posture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he gets closer, he sees more and more details of Graves’ costume. He has breeches rather than pants, with bright red stockings that show the exact shape of his legs. Bright spats cover dark, blood red shoes and button all the way up to his ankles. Even the buttons are red. The only bit that isn’t red, Credence realizes, is a black piece of fabric ties over his waistcoat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This thought moves Credence forward. He knows just what he’s going to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don Diego,” the Red Death says, raising his glass. “Are you challenging me to a duel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence immediately forgets what he was going to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You recognize me?” he asks instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do,” the Red Death says. Percival Graves’ voice does not seem to be muffled at all by the mask. Credence can even hear it over the music.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would recognize such a man anywhere,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence blinks. Well, he reasons, if Percival Graves is the sort of man to dress as the Phantom of the Opera, there’s no reason he hasn’t seen other films as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re dressed a bit more like the magazines, the stories,” Graves says. “I'm not as familiar with those, but I've read a few.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence smiles and it doesn’t feel out of place on his face. Diego has many smiles for his Lolita, doesn’t he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your costume is better than the film,” Credence says. “I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Graves says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Though, you are too handsome to be Erik,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves laughs and lifts his mask away from his face. It has gone back to being lipless and sunken, but Credence is even closer than before. He can see the shape of every tooth in Graves’ jaw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must be joking,” Graves says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your eyes,” Credence says. “The most frightening part of the Phantom is his eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The illusion melts away, so that Credence is left face to face with Percival Graves. He tightens his grip on the hilt of his sword to keep his hand from trembling. Graves has a mouth that makes Credence think of paintings he saw in Italy. His square, handsome face reminds Credence of how large his own nose is and the way his ears stick out. A year ago, in the Punjab region, Credence let a friend of Newt Scamander kiss him on the mouth because Haseen’s heavy brows reminded him of Percival Graves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should try to think of something — anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I couldn’t commit to being without eyelids,” Graves says. “But at the same time, I can’t imagine actually showing my face in front of all these — pardon my language — fucking leeches.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence opens his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are they so awful?” he asks. He does not look behind him, where Graves stares out at the dance floor and the silvery light of an artificial moon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely,” Graves tells him. “If I did show my face, half of them would say I was someone else pretending to be me. That's how it went last year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would know it was you, Mr. Graves,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It is absolutely the most ridiculous and false thing that Credence has ever said in his life. But he likes the way that Graves looks at him afterwards. His voice didn’t even waver. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Graves says, his mouth perfectly forming the sound. “Would you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looks over at the candelabra. “Maybe I wouldn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Graves says. His voice is so firm that Credence’s eyes snap right back to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Señor Zorro is quite the investigator, quite the hero,” he continues, “I’m sure you’d find the villain in your midst.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence blinks. What’s left of the ice skull clinks against his glass when he tries to gesture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a villain,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Graves says, “thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He presses his skull mask over his heart and offers Credence a slight bow. “You’re too kind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean,” Credence says. “I don’t think Erik is a villain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That isn’t what Credence meant. Percival Graves probably knows that. But it’s not untrue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really,” Credence continues. Percival Graves stands up and looks at him. He leaves the sort of watchful silence that once made Credence talk about the way people treated him, the way —</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After all,” Credence says, “he just wants to be loved and he cannot imagine being loved for what he is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He chews on his lower lip after he speaks, which certainly isn’t what Don Diego would do. He lifts his drink and takes a sip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because what he is,” Graves says, as though it’s a question, “is a monster.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not,” Credence tries to say. He stops for another sip of water, his throat feeling tight and hot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Credence says. “Yes, he is a monster. He looks and acts like a monster, but… he is also a man. How he acts is shaped by the way he has been treated. It isn’t so simple to say that one knows the truth of a man by looking at him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence certainly doesn’t. Isn’t that point of his costume?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His face feels hot, especially under his mask. Sweat gathers on his scalp. His breath shakes slightly when he exhales.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An impassioned argument,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks down into his glass. The skull has melted into a concave shape, like the sliver of a new moon. Then he looks at the glass in Graves’ hand and finds it even emptier than his own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like another glass of…” Credence cannot determine what Percival Graves has been drinking from the last few drops of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pumpkin soda,” he says. “And yes, I would. Are you offering?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence attempts his best, heroic Zorro smile. “Of course I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves smiles back at him. He reaches over to set his glass on the table and pick up his cane. Credence frowns slightly. He sets his glass down only to tuck his sword back behind his sash. He doesn’t think he needs to worry about his hands shaking again. Surely that speech of his — what was he thinking — was the most nerve-wracking thing he could possibly do. He picks up Graves’ empty glass and finds a way to balance both glasses in one hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you need to do that,” Graves tells him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to create more work for someone else,” Credence replies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival Graves looks at him as though he has never considered that someone will have to come around and collect his glass after he sets it down. In the time that he stares, Credence strides right past him with his sword tapping against his thigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death stalks Credence right to the bar and no one gets in their way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The barkeep leans over, his face a blank slate of boredom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two pumpkin sodas,” Credence says. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he can reach into his pocket, a red glove sets two bronze coins on top of the bar. Credence looks over his shoulder at the white skull of Graves’ mask. He frowns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Credence looks back, both the empty glasses are gone — as well as the straw Queenie made him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A different barkeep brings them the pumpkin sodas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” Credence says. “May I have my straw back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This man only raises an eyebrow at Credence then turns to the woman beside him. Another man crowds in against Credence’s right shoulder, squeezing him out of the way. Credence grabs the glasses in front of him and turns around. He ends up with his nose nearly pressed against the Red Death’s mask. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves steps back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was the straw important?” he asks, as they walk away from the bar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A friend made it for me from her hair pin,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That seems unsanitary,” Graves says. “But I’m sure it won’t be the only hair pin lost this Halloween night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Red Death’s impassive face turns out toward the dance floor, which looks even more wild every time Credence glances at it. Someone hangs upside down from a flying broom and holds someone dressed as a butterfly in their outstretched arms. The pair of pirates zips past again — those Credence recognizes at least. A bat flits by overhead and Credence tilts his chin to watch it go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he looks back to Graves, he has taken his mask off. He shows his real face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence holds out the glass in his left hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You paid for it,” Credence says. “I should thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lifting the glass to his lips, Graves says, “Then thank me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes a sip and Credence watches his mouth, the way his eyes close as he swallows, the movement of his throat. He takes a quick swallow of the drink and finds it sugary sweet and spiced slightly with cinnamon. Despite the orange color, there’s barely any pumpkin taste to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was my pleasure,” Graves says. “Truly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The corner of his shapely mouth rises. Credence takes another drink from his glass. The sharpness of cinnamon climbs up the back of his throat into his nose, threatening to make him sneeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe something stronger for the next round, if you prefer it,” Graves adds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean alcohol?” Credence asks. He shuts his mouth with a sharp click of his teeth. Of course that’s what he means.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t drink,” Graves says. “But it’s a party. There’s better things for a handsome, young hero to do than drink soda and argue about No-Maj films.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t drink either,” Credence says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival Graves raises an eyebrow and something about being doubted has Credence lowering his drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a condition,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Graves says. He nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence wants to tell Graves that he likes talking with him about films. He wants to tell him that he’s the only one here who actually recognized Credence’s costume, but that fact thrills him so much his chest constricts. Who would have imagined?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Graves says, “if you care to join me, I intend to retreat back to the corner where you found me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence watches him set his mask back into place. He nods without knowing if the man even sees him. People move out of the way when the Red Death approaches. Credence follows a step behind him, careful not to step on his heels or tangle with the end of his cape. Between his collar and the brim of his hat, trim silver hair creeps down the nape of Graves’ neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only a few feet from the bar, Graves stops. He turns, the empty eyes of his mask peering over his shoulder at Credence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to walk behind me,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Credence manages to respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People will generally get out of your way when you’re armed,” Graves says, with the Red Death’s mask hiding whatever expression accompanies a statement like that. Credence wishes he knew. He might know what to say in response. Instead, he rests his empty hand to the hilt of his sword.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves touches his elbow and Credence looks to the red glove against his black shirt. He looks up and then feels foolish, because the mask offers him nothing at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Apologies,” Graves says, and his hand leaves Credence’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But when Graves moves forward, Credence walks beside him rather than behind. No one so much as brushes against Credence’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves must know where he’s headed from the surety of his stride, so Credence takes the opportunity to look at everything around them. That includes, of course, the details of the red lace tied at Graves’ throat and the carved buttons on the cuffs of his coat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally return to the corner with the candelabra, the lopsided thing has been knocked to the floor. The wax and broken candles seem to be the obvious result of a fight still ongoing. Well, it might not be a fight, but it’s certainly something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pardon me,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A goblin woman in a sparkling pink dress pins down a human-sized man dressed as a goblin. A bag of fake coins lies scattered amongst the candles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry fellas,” the woman says. “This area’s occupied.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabs the man by his exaggerated nose and yanks until he shouts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence glances at Graves from the corner of his eye. But Graves doesn’t move, so Credence doesn’t either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said, this area’s occupied, boys,” she repeats. “Find some place else to grab each other’s sacks. I gotta learn somebody some sense about how to treat a lady, even when she ain’t some high-class, high-pockets hussy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good luck with that, ma’am,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence actually turns his head to look at him for that. The rigid, white mask of the Red Death turns and looks at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” he says. “You heard her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves turns his back on the goblin woman and the unfortunate man, but Credence spares them a look over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna rip this charmed-up nose right off your face,” the woman threatens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Tienlim! I ain’t never been sorrier in my life!” the man pleads.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looks away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There won’t be many quiet corners left, I’m afraid,” Graves says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could,” Credence begins to say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They could go somewhere else. They could leave the party entirely. But the only place Credence can think to go is his room above the bookstore. He cannot imagine the two of them loitering in an automat dressed as they are. Or rather, he can imagine it, but he recognizes a bad idea when it crosses his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you have some Señora Pulido to entertain?” Graves asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Credence says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not even your friend with the hairpin?” Graves asks. If he feels something about that, Credence cannot hear it in his voice. He could be asking about the weather.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s probably still dancing with her friends,” Credence says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continues to look for answers in the blankness of the Red Death’s mask, but also in the different shades of red in lace, collar, waistcoat and coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not involved, if that’s what you’re asking,” he adds. “She’s seeing someone already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yet someone invited you to this ball,” Graves says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence’s tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. If he says that Queenie invited him, well… Credence can already hear the question in his mind: Then why didn’t she invite whoever she’s seeing? He could just say that he got his own invitation, but Credence doesn’t know what sort of questions that might invite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, “Did you bring your Christine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves laughs. The sound seems to echo out of his mask, a rolling chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” he says. “There is no Christine for me, not exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not exactly?” Credence asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At this, Graves reaches up and lifts his mask away from his face. The corners of his mouth pull his lips into a smile the shape of an archer’s bow — the sort slung over the shoulders of more than one partygoer tonight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not exactly,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence bites his tongue to keep from asking, “What does that mean <em>exactly</em>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, he takes another sip of his drink and Graves mirrors him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s somewhere we might go,” Graves says. “But I don’t mean to steal you away from the masquerade so early in the night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it early?” Credence asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For all of them, certainly,” Graves says. He turns and looks at the dance floor, offering Credence a view of the mole on his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll be like this until dawn at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds exhausting,” Credence says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree,” Graves says. He turns back toward Credence with his smile softened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if you don’t mind being alone with me,” Graves adds. He holds out the bend of his arm, his bone-white cane in one hand. Credence reaches out and touches the handle first, running his fingers over the curve of the skull and down the curling snake body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Graves’ dark eyes follow his hand as Credence puts his fingers against his wrist. It’s barely a hold of any kind and the sudden disappearance lasts less than a blink. But Credence finds his hand clutching Graves’ forearm when the darkness subsides.</span>
