    <p>The date was March 10th, 1971. Remus Lupin had opened the front door to find his Hogwarts acceptance letter, addressed to the correct name. A miracle, considering he hadn’t yet changed his legal name. Remus was absolutely ecstatic, running into his father’s study to show him the sophisticated green writing on the envelope and the red wax seal on the other side.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His father, Lyall, turned around in his leather desk chair at the sound of Remus excitedly calling out, “Dad! Dad! I got my letter!” Lyall took the envelope from his son and gently peeled back the seal on the front. He removed the letter and unfolded it, reading the familiar words out loud:</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Hope! Where are you?” Lyall called out to his wife, who poked her head through the doorway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Right here, love, what’s happened?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Remus just received his Hogwarts letter,” Lyall told her, beaming down at his young son who smiled widely back up at him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus wrote back to Professor McGonagall immediately to inform her of his confirmed enrollment, including a short thank you to the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, for allowing him entrance into the school even with his condition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first letter had arrived when Remus was ten, and his life had changed. Remus remembered two things about Dumbledore from that day: his glistening beard, and his kindness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He’d never expected to be allowed to attend school. But then, the letter, from the Headmaster himself, explaining that Hogwarts had a place for every magical child. Even him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus was a werewolf, having been bitten just before his fifth birthday. He hadn’t had much interaction with members of the wizarding world because his parents were worried for his safety, due to the negative stereotypes and prejudice against werewolves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Naturally they were wary of the challenges presented by attending school. How could their precious child be protected, surrounded by such uncertainty? Even so, Dumbledore’s calm voice was unwavering as he described precautions that the school would take and places where Remus could safely transform during the full moon, away from the castle and his fellow students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus shrank into the couch as he listened to this wizard paint a picture of his future before him. He watched his father looking down, his mother gripping her tea cup with white knuckles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Lyall finally nodded at the carpet, Remus almost fell off the couch. He didn’t remember if he had thanked Dumbledore that day because he had gone straight to his father’s study and pulled down the first book he could find about the place that would become his new home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hogwarts: A History, it was called.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And home it would be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">* * *</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">In August, Lyall and Hope finally took Remus to Diagon Alley for the first time to gather his school supplies for his first year at Hogwarts. The list was quite long, he thought, but he expected nothing less of an institution that taught all sorts of magic he had never even dreamed of.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lyall asked his son, “Remus, what’s the first item on the list?”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong> <em>Uniform</em> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>First-year students will require:</em>
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Three sets of plain work robes (black)</em></li>
<li><em>One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear</em></li>
<li><em>One pair of protected gloves (dragon hide or similar)</em></li>
<li><em>One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)</em></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Robes,” Remus answered after fumbling to pull the list from his pocket.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Great, we’ll stop in at Madam Malkin’s after we make a withdrawal from Gringotts.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s where the goblins are, right?” Remus asked, remembering what he had read in A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot. Lyall nodded, smiling to himself that Remus was so eager to learn about the world he belonged to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lyall led his family into Gringotts Wizarding Bank, knowing Remus might be startled by the goblins’ physical appearance. As they approached one of the goblins to make a transaction, Lyall glanced at his son to find not an expression of shock or disgust, but one of wonder. Of course his son would not judge magical creatures for what they were. Remus only wanted to take in as much of the magical world as was possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lyall and the goblin, Gornuk, exchanged pleasantries and completed the withdrawal. Remus turned around as they were walking out to wave goodbye to Gornuk, who raised a long-fingered hand grumbled a nearly inaudible “Good afternoon” back to the boy. Remus had better hearing as a result of his lycanthropy, and grinned. “Good afternoon to you too, Mr. Gornuk!” he replied as they disappeared behind the closing doors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As they were walking to Madam Malkin’s shop, Remus furrowed his brow as he realized something. “Dad, there are different uniforms for boys and girls, aren’t there?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lyall put his hand on Remus’s shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. “Yes, but don’t worry. They’ll have something that fits you properly here. No more shopping in the girls’ section at Muggle shops just because you’re a bit smaller than the other boys.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus let out a sigh of relief, and Lyall ruffled his hair. “Come on, let’s go inside.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">They entered the shop and were greeted immediately by Madam Malkin herself. “Good afternoon, you two! Let me guess--someone’s shopping for school supplies today?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Good guess,” Lyall laughed. He remembered receiving the same greeting thirty one years prior. “My son, Remus, here needs his first set of robes,” he told her proudly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The right corner Madam Malkin’s mouth twitched as her eyes darted to Remus and then back to his father. “Right, well, er--”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He’s a bit small, but that won’t be a problem will it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No, of course not. Let’s go get you fitted for some… trousers?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus smiled and nodded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lupins walked out of the shop thirty minutes later with all of the required uniform items, happily talking about how comfortable Remus’s new trousers were.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After purchasing a cauldron, a set of glass phials, a telescope, and a set of brass scales, Lyall led his son to Ollivander’s Wand Shop. A bell above the door rang as it swung open, and Ollivander swung into view riding a ladder, kicking up dust as he flew by shelves of old wands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Afternoon!” he said cheerfully. “I can only assume you’re here to purchase a wand, so let’s find you the right one, hm?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ollivander’s eyes flickered across the rows of wands to his right, and he plucked a dark brown box from the shelf. He slid down the ladder and landed with a thud.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He opened the box and held it out for Remus to see. “Perhaps this one, mister… .?” he questioned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Lupin,” Remus answered nervously.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ah, perhaps this one, Mr. Lupin. Cypress and unicorn hair, ten and a quarter inches. Very pliable, so no need to worry about breaking it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus looked at the wand, and then up at Ollivander expectantly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, give it a wave,” Ollivander instructed in a friendly tone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus gulped and took the wand. He glanced at his father, who nodded to give him the go-ahead. He waved the wand at the lamp on Ollivander’s desk, which, much to his astonishment, turned off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Fantastic! I rarely get it right on the first try,” Ollivander exclaimed. “This wand really likes you, Mr. Lupin.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The wand chooses the wizard, right? I read that in A History of Magic. It’s my favorite book,” Remus said proudly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Correct, sir.” Ollivander smiled down at the keen, young boy. “Well, Mr. Lupin, I wish you good luck during your first year at Hogwarts, and I hope you all have a wonderful afternoon.” He nodded to Lyall and Hope and turned on his heel before disappearing back into the maze of shelves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Are we done, dad?” Remus asked his father.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yes, I think that’s everything.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well… I saw an ice cream shop earlier called Florean Fortescue’s. Could we maybe stop there before we go home?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lyall chuckled. “Of course. You know how I love my ice cream.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">* * *</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">At 11 o’clock on the morning of 1 September, Remus Lupin found himself waving goodbye to his parents from an open window on the Hogwarts Express. He could hear his parents’ voices trailing off as they yelled things like “We love you!” and “We’ll write you every week!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He took his seat in an otherwise empty compartment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thoughts filled his head of what the castle would look like when he finally walked through the doors. He remembered reading about the moving staircases and paintings that could talk; about the floating candles in the Great Hall and the giant hourglasses filled with jewels to show the points each house accumulated over the course of the year; about the house elves in the kitchens and the neighboring village of Hogsmeade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus smiled as he looked out the window at the buildings flying by as they turned into fields of green and yellow, sprinkled with vibrantly colored plants and flowers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Suddenly the door to his compartment was flung open by a young boy with long, dark hair. He was wearing a black, long-sleeve Ramones shirt and jeans with holes in the knees. He appeared to be taller than Remus, and he was out of breath and holding a set of long black robes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Pardon me,” the boy wheezed, “but can I hide on your luggage rack?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus stared at him, absolutely bewildered. “Er, sure?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Brilliant.” The boy climbed onto the rack and wrapped the robes around himself as he settled in behind Remus’s trunk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus’s eyes darted from the rack to the door again as another boy with messy, brown hair ran by, grabbing the doorway to stop himself long enough to ask, “Have you seen a boy about my height wearing a Ramones shirt, whatever that is? He stole my robes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Er… No, sorry.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Right, well thanks anyway.” He darted off in the direction he was originally going.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first boy peeked his head out from under the cloak and hung upside-down slightly to look at Remus. “Thanks for that!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t mention it. So I take it those don’t belong to you?” Remus laughed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The boy hopped down from the rack and sat down across from Remus. “No, they belong to some boy I was sitting with a couple compartments down the train. I tricked him into closing his eyes while I was pretending to show him a Muggle magic trick, and then I nicked his robes and slipped out. Did you see the look on his face? Was he pissed?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A bit . He seemed to be having fun chasing you, though.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Good,” the boy chuckled. “I’m Sirius. Sirius Black.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Remus Lupin,” Remus replied, holding out his hand to shake Sirius’s. “Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sirius met Remus’s hand with his own, grinning widely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, you had my back just now, so I’ll find a way to return the favor.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s not-”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The compartment door slid open once more. “Anything off the trolley dears?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Er, I haven’t got any money,” Remus said, eyeing the Jelly Slugs that were wiggling in their plastic packaging.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ll get something and we can share!” Sirius offered. “What’s your favorite candy? Let’s see, they’ve got Bertie Bott’s, Cauldron Cakes, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s, Jelly Slugs, Liquorice Wands, and Pumpkin Pasties.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve actually never had any of them. I grew up with mostly Muggle sweets,” Remus admitted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh, have you had Werther’s? I love those. I always have some hidden in my room so my mum doesn’t see,” Sirius told him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I will have to move on to the next compartment eventually, dears,” the trolley lady gently interrupted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Er, what do you recommend?” Remus asked Sirius.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sirius turned to the trolley lady and asked for a box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. He handed her twelve Knuts and held out the box for Remus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Go on, close your eyes and try the first one you pick out.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus did so, and immediately cringed. “What the bloody hell was that? It tasted the way dirty socks smell!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sirius laughed. “Well, it was probably a dirty socks-flavoured bean.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re called Every Flavour Beans for a reason.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Eugh,” Remus shuddered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“YOU!” A voice shouted behind the door. The second boy was back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He opened the door and stood in front of Sirius, who extended the Bertie Bott’s box. “Bean?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The boy looked at him thoughtfully for a moment before responding. “Yeah, why not.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He took a bean and dropped down next to Remus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Peach. Nice.” He put his right hand forward and introduced himself to Remus. “I’m James Potter. I see you’ve already met this tosser,” jerking his head in Sirius’s direction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus shook James’s hand. “Remus Lupin.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s a bit repetitive, isn’t it?” James smirked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yeah, you’re right James. D’your parents just really like the moon or what?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Basically.” He knew it was funny, but the irony was not lost on him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three boys spent the rest of the journey discussing Quidditch and comparing it to Muggle football (“How do they only play with one ball?” “How do you play with four? And on a broom?”)</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">* * *</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">When the Hogwarts Express arrived at its stop in Hogsmeade, Remus stepped down from the train and found himself staring up at none other than Rubeus Hagrid, a very large, bearded man with a smile that stretched from ear to ear. He took the new students to an enormous black lake and ferried them across to the castle in enchanted rowboats. As they glided over the dark waters, Remus looked down to see glimmers of what looked like moonlight reflecting off of tails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After Hagrid dropped them off at the castle, Remus and the rest of the first-years were led by a slightly intimidating Professor McGonagall to the impressive double-doors of the Great Hall. The doors opened, and Remus instantly fell in love. He was positively awestruck by the enchanted ceiling, which was displaying the clouds and stars of the dark blue night sky currently outside the walls of the castle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">McGonagall walked with the new students to the opposite end of the Great Hall, where they were met by the welcoming, yet expectant stares of the rest of the Hogwarts faculty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Now, when I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she instructed the group of nervous first-years. She held up a list of names. “Peter Pettigrew.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A small, wiry-haired boy made his way through the crowd and climbed onto the stool. Professor McGonagall placed the Sorting Hat on Peter’s head, and the hat’s folds shifted to resemble a face.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nervous, this one,” the hat commented on the quivering boy beneath him. “Still, I can see he has potential. Let’s go with… Gryffindor!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peter let out an enormous sigh of relief and hopped down from the stool to join the older Gryffindors at their long table. A fifth-year gave him a friendly clap on the back and welcomed him to the house.</p>
<p>McGonagall continued down her list, the Sorting Hat placing James and Sirius in Gryffindor as well. Sirius was practically glowing as he took his seat in the sea of gold and scarlet. Finally, Remus was called up to be sorted .</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Remus Lupin.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He sat down carefully on the stool and awaited the hat’s decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh, this is interesting. You’ve got some secrets, eh?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Er…” Remus was starting to sweat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Not to worry, not to worry, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it just goes to show how brave you are--which of course, leads me to think… Gryffindor!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus’ stomach soared, and his chest felt like it could burst with happiness. He whispered a quick thanks to the hat before heading over to join his new friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">* * *</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">After a feast of a multitude of flavorful meats, potatoes, and vegetables, not to mention a wide assortments of rich desserts--which was an absolute dream for Remus, considering that his family only ever had enough to get by--the students were shown to Gryffindor Tower, on the seventh floor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Quid Agis</em>,” the Gryffindor Head Boy said to the Fat Lady, whose portrait guarded the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. Remus was astounded by the detail in her dress and facial features--she almost looked like a real person standing in an alcove.</p>
<p>“Fine, and yourself?” she replied, allowing her frame to swing forward and reveal a hole through which the Head Boy climbed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Come along,” he called back to the students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus and Sirius turned to each other, eyes wide, before following the other first-years through the portrait hole. Remus looked around the common room, familiarizing himself with the portraits, the fireplace, and the various books scattered around the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was exactly like he had pictured it based on what he had read in his father’s copy of Hogwarts: A History. There were intricate rugs covering the floor and soft armchairs scattered about the room. A few of the portraits said hello as he walked past them, and the welcoming warmth of the fire made him feel safe. He couldn’t believe how incredible the room was, especially compared to the small, dull home he grew up in. Still, his home was enough; he had his parents, and that’s all that ever really mattered to him.</p>
<p>“If you’ll all please ascend these stairs and get settled into your dormitories, I’ll bid you goodnight and good luck with your first day of classes tomorrow,” the Head Boy said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh no, Remus thought to himself. The school had done a magnificent job so far of getting his name right, but now it would all be ruined.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He walked up the stairs with the rest of the new Gryffindors and stopped on the landing between the two dormitories. Sirius noticed and hung back with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You okay?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I was just thinking. I read about the staircase to the Girls’ dormitory not allowing boys to go up, and I wondered if it was true.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh, try it!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know-”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Go on!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus took a deep breath and put his foot on the bottom stair. Nothing happened. He took a couple more steps, and then--</p>
<p dir="ltr">A rumbling noise came from the staircase, which suddenly turned into a slide, sending Remus toppling into Sirius.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus sat up. “Woah.” Heart pounding and head spinning, he felt a chill travel down his spine. He had no idea the castle would provide him with such strong acceptance and validation of his identity. It was hard to stay cool and collected in front of his friend, but he definitely wasn’t ready to tell Sirius yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sweet,” Sirius laughed. “Hey, let’s go unpack our trunks.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Yeah, okay.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus followed Sirius into the Boys’ dormitory, surprised to find his trunk resting at the foot of the bed directly across the room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He unlocked it to start unpacking when it opened on its own, a book rising out of it and floating around the room. “What-”</p>
<p>“Gotcha!” James said, laughing as he pulled something shiny off his head. He tossed the book back to Remus and said, “My dad gave this to me before I left for school. He said it’s been in the family for generations."</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What is it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“An invisibility cloak. It makes you, well, invisible.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Wow,” Remus said, his mouth hanging open.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Are you allowed to have that at school?” a quiet voice came from behind the bed in the corner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Technically there’s no rule against it,” James replied. “Your name’s Peter, right?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Y- yeah, Peter Pettigrew.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, Pete, you’re in for a wild ride this year. We Gryffindors have to stick together!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peter smiled weakly at James and then Sirius and Remus before getting ready for bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remus looked around the room at his new friends and grinned. This year was bound to be great.</p>
