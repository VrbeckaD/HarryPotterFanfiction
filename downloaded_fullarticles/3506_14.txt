    <i>Why am I getting a bad feeling?</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>Harry Potter bit his lip as he reluctantly left Ron Weasley and the now amnesic Gilderoy Lockhart behind. Thanks to the idiot blond's attempt in trying to erase their memories, he wound up causing a cave-in instead. Harry had dove forward, avoiding in being crushed by the falling rocks; but had been separated from Ron.</p>
<p>He was alone; again.</p>
<p>The small boy ran a thin hand through his dingy, dark locks; his green eyes disturbed. This had been a very stressful year. First, he missed the train when the portal closed early. Then, Ron had the bright idea in taking his dad's enchanted car to Hogwarts; something that Harry was reluctant to do (and he was right). In return, they got Arthur Weasley; Ron's dad, in serious trouble with the Ministry of Magic, after the car's invisibility booster failed and several Muggles saw them in the air.</p>
<p>After that, Harry got his first taste of a Howler; after Molly Weasley, Ron's mom, sent one to Ron and scolded him for what he had done. A Howler was definitely on his list of things to avoid. Hm, Harry supposed that it was a good thing tat his nasty relatives couldn't send him one. Then there was Lockhart's ridiculous first class. A stupid quiz about himself, and not on the subject; which was Defense Against the Dark Arts. He then had the gall to set loose a bunch of Cornish Pixies and the man expected the class to take care of it! Poor Neville Longbottom had been lifted by his collar and hung on the chandelier that hunt in the classroom. Thankfully, he wasn't hurt; just bruised his pride a bit.</p>
<p>Next came his detention with the blond idiot. Ron had gotten lucky that all he had to do was clean a bunch of trophies. And what did Lockhart have him do? Harry had to spend hours answering the man's bloody fanmail! Although, this was the first time that he had heard the raspy hissy words about killing someone.</p>
<p>And don't forget his first Quidditch match this year!</p>
<p>Harry winced, rubbing his right arm; silently cursing the blond's incompetence. He had broken his right arm thanks to an enchanted bludger. Harry tried to get to the Hospital Wing, but no! Lockhart tried to heal his arm, and instead; completely removed every bone. So, Harry was forced to spend the night painfully regrowing his bones; and he vowed to never let that happen again. Then, Hermione had the idea of brewing the Polyjuice Potion to see if they could learn on who the Heir of Slytherin was. Harry, at the time, was determined to clear his name and willingly went with Hermione's idea. He just never expected her to steal from Professor Snape's stores!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Polyjuice Potion was finished on Christmas. The trio had planned on disguising themselves as Victor Crabbe, Gregory Goyle and Millicent Bulstrode. Harry and Ron knocked the two boys out and hid them in a closet. They were able to infiltrate Slytherin; their rival house and did their best to trick Draco. Sadly, they learned that Draco wasn't the heir, but that the Chamber had been opened once fifty years ago. </p>
<p>As for Hermione...?</p>
<p>Turns out that the Polyjuice Potion was for humans only; and she had accidentally used <i>cat</i> hair. Low and behold, she had to spend a long time in the Hospital Wing, having Madam Poppy Pomfrey; the school nurse, reverse the affects of the potion. Don't even get him started on Lockhart's idea of Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>Or what happened with Tom Riddle's diary.</p>
<p>Then, you have the time when the Quidditch Match of Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff being cancelled. Turns out, that the heir had attacked two more people; petrifying Hermione and an older girl, Penelope Clearwater. It was after this, that his fellow students stopped accusing him of being Slytherin's heir.</p>
<p>But, that was a bit late on their part.</p>
<p>Thankfully, even after dealing with Albus Dumbledore being relieved of his position, Rubeus Hagrid being taken to Azkaban, Harry and Ron learned the location of where the Chamber of Secrets was. The entrance was right in the girl's bathroom where the spirit known as Moaning Myrtle, haunted. They were horrified to learn that Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, had been taken to the Chamber with the heir threatening her life.</p>
<p>That just wouldn't do.</p>
<p>The two tracked Lockhart down, finding that the blond was attempting to flee. It infuriated Harry that the man would leave Ginny to die, and even worse that Lockhart stole the work of those who really accomplished his 'works'. Apparently, the only thing that blondie was good at, was memory charms.</p>
<p>Hence the damn cave-in.<br/>
At least, Lockhart couldn't hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Hm?</p>
<p>Snapping out of his disturbing thoughts, Harry saw the shedded skin of a Basilisk. He couldn't believe how big the serpent was; as the shed skin was well over eighty feet in length and incredibly thick in girth. He winced, praying that he could grab Ginny before the Basilisk showed up. But, knowing his luck, that wasn't going to happen. Looking up, Harry saw an intricately designed door, with two large black marble snakes coiling around each other. Getting an idea, Harry took a deep breath and concentrated on his magic. <i>"Open..."</i> He hissed, his words coming out in the breathy hiss that was Parseltongue. </p>
<p>
  <i>"Asss you wisssh, little one..."</i>
</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Blinking owlishly, Harry watched as the marbled snakes eyes glowed a bloody red, before they started to uncoil themselves; moving away as the door slowly slid open. Shaking his head, Harry took one last look at the door before heading deeper into the Chamber.</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <i>I'm hearing things.</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>.-.-.-.</p>
<p>"Ginny!"</p>
<p>Running down the long tunnel, Harry ignored as water seeped into his pants; and was horrified by the sight that laid before him. There, laying so still and pale, was Ginny Weasley. She was still breathing, but her breathing was becoming more shallow with each breath that she took. The diary of Tom Riddle, laid innocently next to her.</p>
<p>"Please wake up," Harry pleaded, kneeling next to her as he looked her over for injuries. "Alas, she won't wake," A soft and silky voice said calmly. Tensing, Harry snapped to attention; only to watch as Tom Riddle came into view. Harry had to admit that Tom was handsome, tall and lithe; and with his wavy dark hair and almond shaped green eyes, Tom Riddle bore a similar appearance to Harry himself. Harry hadn't even realized that Tom had picked up his fallen wand, not until it was pointed at him.</p>
<p>Wait - what?</p>
<p>"Tom, what are you doing?" Harry asked slowly, his eyes never leaving the older boy's. Tom gave a cold smile, his eyes glittering with hidden malice. "As I said Harry Potter, she won't wake," He purred, looking the petite boy over and found him pathetic. "As we speak, little Ginny Weasley's life is draining, and soon," His smile widen. "I will become real once more."</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <i>What's he talking about?</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>"How is it," Tom began as he circled the confused boy. "That someone with little to no talent, could defeat one of the greatest wizards of all time?" Harry frowned, a chill going down his spine. Looking the boy over again, Tom smirked when he could only sense a small spark. "I see," He murmured. "You only survived thanks to your mudblood of a mother."</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <i>Oh hell no!</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>Harry's green eyes narrowed slightly, a suspicious idea nagged at him. "Why do you care how I survived?" He snapped, clenching a fist in anger at the insult to his mother. "Voldemort was <i>after</i> your time!" Tom's smile was making Harry very nervous, and were his eyes turning red?</p>
<p>"You see, Harry," He said smoothly. "Voldemort is my past, present and future." Harry could only stare in shock as Tom Riddle used his wand, and with a fiery flare; wrote out his full name: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE. With a flick of the wrist, the fiery words rearranged themselves, and Harry was left staring in utter horror, at the new, hidden name within the boy's own name.</p>
<p>
  <b>I AM LORD VOLDEMORT</b>
</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>"Y-You're Voldemort?" Harry asked weakly, swallowing thickly as he realized what was happening. "Yes, I am," The older boy admitted. "Now, I shall finish what my ancestor, Lord Slytherin, started," Tom continued. "And I'll start by removing you, Harry Potter!" However, before Tom could summon the Basilisk, something else happened. And neither of the boys were expecting this. </p>
<p>
  <b>"What isss the meaning of thisss?!"</b>
</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>The statue, which Harry finally spotted; which was of an old man with seemingly long features, twitch slightly. He stared with wide eyes, as the mouth of the bust slid open and a gorgeous man, walked out. The man appeared to be in his late teens to early twenties, tall but built like a swimmer. Wavy dark green hair fell around his delicate face; cat-like and yet, poisonous yellow eyes, a small nose and full lips, all which was accented by smooth, caramel skin. However, this was where his humanity ended.</p>
<p>Even with his poor vision, Harry could see that the man sported sharp nails, pointed ears which was revealed when his hair was brushed back, and of course he had to have fangs! Harry turned red, when he realized that the man was only in a pair of black sweats.</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <i>Who is this guy?</i>
  </b>
</p>
<p>Tom's now red eyes narrowed into slits, and he looked pissed. "Who do you think you are, by baring into Lord Slytherin's chambers?!" He snapped, his voice hissy and demanding. The man's bright yellow eyes turned in his direction, and the man snorted. <b>"My name, foolisssh human, isss Lord Animusss,"</b> The man said coldly, his voice low but silky smooth. Harry shivered, a pleasant feeling washed over him as he heard Lord Animus speak. He found that he could not look away from the older man, wondering why he was relaxing. Animus then stiffened, but made no other movement as a sweet scent of honey, milk and musk with a faint hint of tainted innocence, reached his nose. Keeping calm, Animus did his best to not allow his displeasure be shown, his gaze met the green eyes of the younger boy. Despite being small and thin, Animus could see that the boy could grow into quite the beauty; so long as he had the right guidance.  </p>
<p>Hm...</p>
<p><i>And that scent</i>, Animus thought as his yellow eyes darkened. The scent that the boy was unconsciously emitting was intoxicating, and the Serpent Lord found it quite enjoyable. When he saw that the young boy was gazing at him with slowly clouding eyes and appeared that he was longing for the Lord, and Animus realized just who this boy was to him.</p>
<p><i>Mate!Mate!Mate!</i> His mind screamed.</p>
<p>Animus knew then and there, that this tiny boy was his.</p>
<p>"How dare you!" Tom yelled, his temper rising when he realized that he was being ignored. Before the spirit; which he clearly was, could react, Animus was in front of him. The Serpent Lord's claws were digging into the boy's neck, threatening to cut off his oxygen. <b>"You reek of darknesss,"</b> Animus growled. -/"I will not allow an abomination to harm my mate."/- Tom, who was struggling with fury, froze; his red eyes bearing down into Animus' yellow ones. He then realized that he was in very big trouble, especially when the man looked down and saw his diary.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p><b>"Ssso, that'sss how you're maintaining your form,"</b> Animus growled, baring his fangs in a snarl. Still holding onto the spirit, Animus inched backwards; until the diary was at his feet. Tom could only stare, his red eyes reflecting his fear as the man drove his right foot; the sharp nails easily tearing into the vulnerable pages. At the same time, a dark greenish-black liquid began to drip onto the book. The pages started to smoke as they began to melt into a goopy dark pile. Almost immediately, Tom felt his energy draining as the ritual was reverse; and Ginny's life force was being returned to her nearly lifeless body.</p>
<p>The more his energy drained, cracks formed along his frame. Harry blinked, staring in dumbfounded amazement as Tom Marvolo Riddle disappeared in a brilliant flash of white light. So, his spirit was attached to the diary? And when Lord Animus drove his claws into it, and that odd liquid appeared, the diary was destroyed?</p>
<p>Wait, what about Ginny?</p>
<p>His vision swarmed, and Harry was left feeling weak as he plopped down; and looked up into Lord Animus' yellow eyes. The man knelt down, and caressed his right cheek; pleased when Harry leaned into the gentle touch. Realizing something, Harry struggled to speak; despite wanting to curl up with the man before him. "What did you mean that I wasss your mate?" His voice slipped slightly, the lone 's' being drawn out.</p>
<p>Lord Animus smiled.</p>
<p><b>"Asss I sssaid, little one,"</b> He told the dazed boy, lifting the boy's head up. <b>"You belong to me,"</b> Animus captured his mate's lips in a soft, sweet kiss; much to Harry's shock. The small boy didn't fight it, and instead, leaned in; a soft mewl escaping him. <b>"In mind, body and sssoul,"</b> Animus continued.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, his eyes becoming half-lidded and dark from the building heat; much to his confusion. Would it really be so bad, belonging to this gorgeous man? Looking up into Lord Animus' eyes once more, Harry decided that he wanted this. He had never felt so comfortable with someone like this, and he never wanted it to end. <i>"Yesss..."</i> Harry breathed, slipping into Parseltongue.<i>"I'll be yoursss, Lord Animusss..."</i></p>
<p><b>"Good,"</b> Animus said with a smile, running a clawed hand through Harry's dark locks. <b>"I'll be ssseeing you sssoon, little one,"</b> Animus promised. He then altered Harry's memory of the incident; ensuring that a certain old coot wouldn't discover him. He then returned to the statue, watching as Harry's eyes darkened then glazed over with the spell, and he smiled.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>.-.-.-.</p>
<p>That very same night, Lord Animus kept his promise. He was grateful when Hogwarts; the enchanted school that she was, placed everyone within her halls into a much deeper sleep. This way, he wouldn't be interrupted with his little mate. Animus calmly entered Gryffindor Tower through a hidden passage; again, this was all thanks to Hogwarts. Giving a delicate sniff, he scented his little one and proceeded to the boy's dormitory; to be more specific, the second year dorm. He simply ignored the other boys, and approached the bed that contained his mate.</p>
<p>There, curled up in bed, in a very peaceful sleep; was young Harry. The small boy breathed softly, little hums escaping his lips every so often. Animus bent down, breathing in his precious one's scent; and smiled with wicked delight. With the right guidance, Animus would bright out his mate's true self.</p>
<p>Hm...</p>
<p>
  <i>That's it!</i>
</p>
<p>Animus grinned a toothy grin, before a dark green slit appeared in the air next to him. He reached in, and plucked out not one, not two, but three particular items. The items in question, were worm-like creatures born from the darkest of demonic realms. They were specially bred for pleasure and 'awakening one self', or so they claim. Looking down, Animus found that his mate's trunk was unlocked; and his grin widen. This would be the perfect opportunity. And best of all, no one would ever find out. Keeping the worms in stasis, he slipped them into Harry's trunk; but not before casting a dark rune that acted as the equivalent to a Notice-Me-Not Charm.</p>
<p>
  <i>Enjoy your gift, love.</i>
