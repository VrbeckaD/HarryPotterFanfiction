  <span class="s1">“Come here,” Sirius beckons, his right hand reaching out to Remus. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sirius, no. This is ridiculous.” Remus attempts to stand his ground. Though he knows resistance is futile, their entire relationships success can be attributed to Remus’s predications to heed Sirius’s call at every turn. Not that he minds, loving Sirius Black and giving into his every whim, has always ended in Remus’s own carnal delights. That doesn’t mean he has to make it easy on him though. “I’m not doing it.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Remus, it’s just pictures.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, well if it’s just pictures, then you have no use for me.” Remus begins to re-button the baby blue dress shirt that Sirius had asked him to put on along with a pair of simple black briefs. “You take “just” pictures all day for work.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Stop.” Sirius grabs his wrists and pulls them away from the buttons. He’s already managed to make his way halfway up the shirt. Sirius begins unbuttoning again. “Why are you making this difficult.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because it’s more fun this way Padfoot.” Remus winks and grabs ahold of Sirius’s wrists now, attempting to pull them away from the buttons. Sirius, maintains his grip on the fabric and when Remus pulls, the buttons pop free, sending three small pearlescent white disks flying through the bedroom. “My shirt!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s my shirt actually,” Sirius corrects with a wicked grin, pulling the shirt more open, exposing Remus’s chest fully as he works his hands down to the hem. “You can tell because it’s too big on you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sacrificing your own clothes, how noble of you Mr. Black.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Noble indeed,” Sirius says, his hands leaving the shirt and moving to run up the planes of Remus’s back causing the smaller man to shudder under his palms. Those palms pull Remus flush to Sirius’s chest, who dips his head down slightly to kiss Remus languidly, his tongue demanding access, Remus immediately relents. His enthusiasm to comply to Sirius’s desires begins to rise between them and he feels Sirius’s lips turn up at the corners even as they’re pressed against his. Sirius pulls away from the kiss and throatily whispers, “The bed, now.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus turns and takes the three strides to the bed quickly, looking seductively over his shoulder. Sirius chases him down and tackles him onto the mattress, a low rumbling growl moves through him as he catches his prey. Remus feels that growl shudder between their bodies with Sirius crawling above him, kissing, licking and sucking his way from navel to neck to eventually catch him again on the lips. Remus wraps his arms around Sirius, pulling him flush to his bare torso. He bends his knees and uses his thighs against Sirius’s hips to increase the pressure and pull him further in, desperate now to feel Sirius all around him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Moons,” Sirius moans out into Remus’s neck, his hands nimbly removing what little is left of Remus’s clothes, the concept of pictures pushed back and put off for another time, again. </span>
