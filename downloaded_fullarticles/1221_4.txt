    <p>The day had had a horrid start and was simply getting worse by the minute. Of course, there were no easy days for the Headmaster of Hogwarts, but this was simply ridiculous.</p><p>In the morning, during breakfast, a fight broke out between two students that resulted in a food fight between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. Right after, Peeves had strung dead snakes all over the ceilings in the dungeons—of course, creating havoc among the 1st year Slytherin students who had been in their rooms at the time.</p><p>After all of that had been cleared up, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher—a small witch who Draco really shouldn’t have hired in the first place—had screamed that she was quitting because she really couldn’t handle the pressure. So now, before noon, he was already heading back to his office to try and send some owls to previous teachers, begging them to come and substitute until he could find a replacement.</p><p>Then, just when he thought it couldn’t get any worse, Draco entered his office and nearly walked straight back out. He sighed and closed the door behind him quietly, staring at the back of a too-familiar head. The messy hair was really in a rather appalling state today and Draco grimaced slightly.</p><p>The head turned and Draco took in the wide smile and bright green eyes, now behind a new-looking pair of black, rectangular glasses that seemed to suit the man much better than that other round broken pair he usually had on. Not that it matters, Draco thought as he walked up to his desk resolutely.</p><p>“Mr Potter, I was unaware that we had an appointment this morning,” Draco said politely as he sat down in his chair across from where Potter was slouching unprofessionally. The git. “Are the children all right? They seemed fine at breakfast this morning.”</p><p>“Nope, no appointment.” Potter grinned easily at him. “And it’s not about the kids either—although, I really hope James hasn’t started any more fires or turned any more kids into frogs.”</p><p>“Not that I know of.” Draco’s lips quirked slightly at the thought of the last time Potter had been called in because of his eldest son’s antics. “He’s been relatively quiet these last two weeks since his seventh year began. I do believe he’s finally trying to decide what to do with his life after he graduates and that leaves less time for, ah, other activities, like setting half the school on fire.”</p><p>“I thought for sure he was just going to go work for his uncle,” Harry said, rolling his eyes, but still smiling like the proud father he always was. “He does love the Weasley joke shop.”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but I did tell him that he had all the options in the world,” Draco said. He knew how intelligent the young man was, and often he would come into Draco’s office and ask for career advice, which Draco was always willing to give to his students. “He’s a smart one—as are Albus and Lily, of course.”</p><p>Potter sat up and stared at him with a pensive look on his face that made him seem as if he were finally as old as he really was. Draco was about to ask why he was staring, but then he spoke.</p><p>“You really care about them, don’t you? Your students. It’s hard to believe you have a heart, but you really do.” Potter smiled slightly, teasing.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes and bit the inside of his cheek. “Potter, I don’t have all day to sit around and speak with you. I do run a school here, you know. What, exactly, is the reason for your visit?”</p><p>Now the smile was gone and Draco felt childishly pleased in its absence.</p><p>“Well, er,” Potter started, scratching the back of his head as if he were really just seventeen again. “You might have heard this already, but I retired from the Auror force a few weeks ago.”</p><p>“Yes, and...?”</p><p>“Erm, I...” The man paused again and Draco was becoming rapidly irritated.</p><p>“Spit it out, Potter,” Draco snapped. Merlin, he rarely ever lost his patience anymore—trust Potter to ruin his gentle streak with his impertinence.</p><p>“I’m bored!” Potter said suddenly. “I thought it would be relaxing or whatever, so I retired on my 42nd birthday, but now I just sit around and do nothing but read, play with Skipper and watch porn and—”</p><p>“What, for Merlin’s sake, does this have to do with me?!” Draco asked, slightly horrified by Potter’s rant. “And what is a Skipper?!”</p><p>“Not what, but who. Skipper is our two year old crup.” Harry sighed. “I was just thinking, I mean, I heard that Professor Mayborn was thinking about quitting—Albus sent me a letter yesterday—and I just thought that maybe—”</p><p>“No!” Draco blurted out, very un-Malfoy-like. He had put two and two together to figure out what Potter was thinking. “There is no way.”</p><p>“Just think about it!”</p><p>“No, just no, absolutely not,” Draco said, his voice resolute. “I would never allow someone like you to teach here!”</p><p>“Someone like me?” Potter raised an eyebrow and stared at him with those impossibly green eyes of his. “What exactly is wrong with me?”</p><p>“You’re not only impertinent and disorganized, but you have a notable history of danger surrounding you! Plus, I don’t want children to just continually hear stories about your glory days instead of actually learning something.”</p><p>“Okay, first off, I don’t go around telling stories of my so-called glory days because they weren’t glorified for me. They were painful and the wounds of those who were killed still hurt me,” Potter spat out, his charming voice now full of anger. “I barely ever talk about the war, even when my kids beg me to tell them about it. Also, isn’t my notable history of danger the right reason to hire me? Who else better to teach kids about dangerous dark arts then someone like me or you, who have first hand experience?”</p><p>Draco and Potter sat for a moment and stared at each other.</p><p>“And I’m not impertinent. And only slightly disorganized,” the man finished, the grin coming back.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Draco had to remind himself to count to ten and breathe slowly. “I hate you, Potter. How am I going to stand being around you all the time?”</p><p>“I’ll keep out of your way, I promise,” he said cheekily, moving to stand up. “Look, just think about it. Who knows if Mayborn will actually quit? It’s just an option.”</p><p>Sighing and standing up as well, he could feel the Portraits all staring down at him as he faced his fate.</p><p>“Mayborn has already quit, Potter. This morning. I suppose, considering you’re probably the only one who’ll want to work here who is at least somewhat qualified and is already ready... I suppose I’ll have to hire you.”</p><p>With that, Draco headed out of his office, wanting to get away from the irritating man as fast as possible.</p><p>“And don’t you dare ask me for a raise!” He practically snarled at the man as he left.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>Draco clenched his teeth in preparation for the speech he was about to make. It was simply ridiculous that in only October, he was already replacing one of his teachers. He felt like a failure. Standing up, he watched as the whole student body in the Great Hall finished their desserts and looked over at him. He still had some respect, at least.</p><p>“Students, I hope your first month in classes has been going well. I know it’s getting somewhat hectic with upcoming tests and papers due, but I do hope you remember to enjoy your time here as well. Quidditch is off to an excellent start and our duelling club is doing wonderfully. Congratulations are in order as well, to our Wizard’s Chess team, which beat Beauxbatons earlier this week!”</p><p>Draco paused and smiled as several students who were on the Chess team blushed while their classmates cheered for them.</p><p>“And, now, I’m sure you’ve all noticed our recent change in seating arrangement at the head table. Professor Mayborn has decided that she would like to take leave, and we have a replacement who is, erm, eager to teach you all the fascinating subject of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Please welcome Professor Potter,” Draco couldn’t help but sneer, even though he really shouldn’t, “to our humble home, and remember that now, as your professor, you must respect him and treat him as you do the rest of your professors...no less, nor greater.”</p><p>A huge burst of applause went off as Potter—stupid, noble, prat—raised a hand and waved to his adoring fans. Draco noted that Albus, Scorpius and Lily clapped the loudest, while James seemed anxious and kept running a hand through his hair, almost exactly like his father.</p><p>“Now, off to bed, students. And remember the rules! I don’t want anymore trouble—including late night soirees or nicking snacks from the kitchens. The Elves do tell me what’s going on, believe it or not,” Draco said, his voice only slightly tinged with warning. Father was right; I really am going soft. But he did love the students, damn it all, even if perhaps they did annoy him sometimes.</p><p>There was murmuring among the students as they went back to their dormitories, but Draco tuned it out and headed down the stairs, towards the back door so that he could go back his own rooms and finish some paperwork. He knew he should sleep, he really was exhausted, but he needed to finish that damn letter to the Minister and those last few contracts with the Salem Academy, to prepare for the next Wizard’s Chess tournament...</p><p>“Malfoy! Malfoy, wait!”</p><p>Draco turned on his heel, the paperwork forgotten for a moment. “Professor Potter,” Draco snarled. “I am the Headmaster of this school. You will address me as Professor Malfoy or Headmaster Malfoy in front of the staff and students, understood?”</p><p>Potter quirked an easy grin and shrugged one shoulder like the idiot he was. “Yeah, okay. Anyway—I was wondering, where am I supposed to teach? The Elves showed me my rooms—which are fantastic, by the way, thank you—but they didn’t show me my classroom.”</p><p>Draco breathed in deep again. “I’m not a tour guide, Professor. Your classroom is on the third floor, where Professor Mayborn was teaching—we don’t want to confuse the students by having you acquire a different classroom.”</p><p>“But, see, I went there, and there are no windows! None, at all! That’s so boring. Plus, there’s hardly any room in there! Where are we supposed to practice and—”</p><p>“That is not my concern, Professor,” Draco responded irritably. “Just do your job and don’t bother me. Or else I’ll fire your arse.”</p><p>With that, Draco turned and felt a niggling feeling in his stomach. This whole thing was going to be such a failure—he just knew it.</p>
