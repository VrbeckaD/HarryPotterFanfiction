</p>
<p>Everly Leighton had always been an ambitious child. Ever since she was born, her parents worshiped the very ground she walked upon. In their eyes, she could do no wrong.</p>
<p>As a Pureblood, she received magical tutoring from the age she began to show her abilities, two. At age eleven, she received her Hogwarts letter, just like her parents always told her she would. By then, she was confident that she would be sorted into her family's house,<em> Gryffindor. </em></p>
<p>September 1st rolled around, and Everly was comfortably seated within the train, on her way to Hogwarts, wand in hand. A twelve inch, Elder wood, with a Basilisk skin and Phoenix feather core was gifted to her the day before. It was a family heirloom, her mother had informed her that it was more than eight hundred years old, and she had bonded to it, instantly.</p>
<p>Her father had been proud, so proud, that he had lifted her up and spun her around, something he hadn't done since she was very small.</p>
<p>Unlike other kids her age, Everly stayed in her compartment, by herself. She was anxious to arrive, and nervous about making friends. Ever since the war with Voldemort ended, Purebloods were not looked at too kindly.</p>
<p>It seemed that prejudice went <em>both </em>ways.</p>
<p>As the train rolled to a stop, she left her compartment and followed the other first years down to the shore to load into the boats. Having read <em>Hogwarts: A History, </em>around fifteen times, she wasn't too amazed at her surroundings.</p>
<p>Her mind was focused on the sorting, <em>Gryffindor </em>repeating within her mind, her own personal mantra.</p>
<p>Upon entering the castle, they were herded into the Great Hall. Where, one by one, they were all called to be sorted.</p>
<p>"Everly Leighton."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, and, bravely marched up to the stool. Upon sitting down, the large hat was placed atop her head, and her struggle began.</p>
<p>'Ah, quite a lot of ambition you have, Little One.'</p>
<p>'Lot's of bravery, too, <em>right?'</em></p>
<p>'Yes, yes, quite brave, but cunning as a snake, as well.'</p>
<p>'Brash as a lion, too,<em> huh?</em>'</p>
<p>'I've seen inside your mind, there's nothing you can hide. While bravery is a good thing to have, your cunning and your ambitions will get you through. Merlin knows, you'd even be great in Ravenclaw, the will for knowledge lies within you.'</p>
<p><em>'No! </em>Don't you do this to me, you...you..oversized scratching post! No one in my family has been anything but <em>Gryffindor</em> for <em>years.'</em></p>
<p>'You want to be the best, yes?'</p>
<p>'Of course I do!'</p>
<p>'Alright than, better be..'</p>
<p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p>
<p>As the cheers from her table bellowed, loudly, Everly nearly sank into herself to cry. Hands clinched into fists, she snatched the hat from her head and placed it on the chair to go find herself a seat.</p>
<p>Plopping down onto the bench, next to a couple other first years, she ignored the conversations around her, and settled upon a plan to deal with her next few years of studies. Once her timetable was in her hand, and she was led to the girls dormitories, she let her determination and ambition rule her for the next few years of her school life.</p>
<p>Each year came and went, all the while she studied away, dead set on topping Hermione Granger's own scores. By the time she graduated, she was labeled the smartest witch since <em>Merlin.</em></p>
<p>Her magical levels were off the charts, ranging at Mage as soon as she turned fourteen. She became adept at nonverbal and wandless magic, only using her wand when she didn't feel like concentrating quite so hard.</p>
<p>Most of the time, she left it in her hair, stuck within the bun she pulled her hair into, almost every day.</p>
<p>As she aged, she found herself being plagued with boys that she wanted nothing to do with. Her heart lie in academics, <em>not </em>with silly school boys who didn't even realize she was a girl until she developed <em>breasts.</em></p>
<p>At age nineteen, Everly was the most sought after witch in all of Britain. Her small frame was well endowed with womanly curves, and porcelain skin that seemed to radiate with an inner light. Her lilac colored eyes, odd but beautiful, made everyone stop and stare as she walked past. She was blessed with a heart-shaped face, and a set of delectable, full lips.</p>
<p>Her smile could brighten up any room, as easily as her glare could frighten even <em>Voldemort. </em>By the time she gained her Masters, and could be called a Mage, she had been named the <em>Ice Queen. </em>Probably due to her chilling nature, and the moonlight silver hair that flowed to her waist.</p>
<p>Every department within the Ministry wanted her, and soon she was neck deep in letters, begging for her to come by for an interview.</p>
<p>March 1st, the day of her twentieth birthday, she donned a pair of black skinny jeans, and a black tank-top, throwing a presentable, light blue, button down shirt, over it. Slipping into a pair of brown boots, she braided her hair and twisted it, sticking her wand through it to hold into place. Muggle clothing had always been more enjoyable to wear, for her.</p>
<p>With a deep breath, she apparated right outside the Ministry, and calmly made her way straight to the Department of Mysteries.</p>
<p>Her heels made a repetitive clacking noise as she made her way to Mr. Jones' office. Turning down a solitary corridor, she froze as the sound of a fight made its way into her ears.</p>
<p>"Sir, there's another Federation ship!"</p>
<p>"Destroy it too."</p>
<p>"Fire torpedoes!"</p>
<p>Confused, she followed the voices to a door almost halfway down the corridor. Leaning up next to it, she heard shots go off, and more speaking.</p>
<p>"Captain, they're locking torpedoes."</p>
<p>"Divert–"</p>
<p>Another loud <em>crash </em>rang out, and Everly flinched, reflexively yanking the door open.</p>
<p>As soon as it opened, she felt a pulling sensation along her midsection, and then she was airborne. Her mouth opened in a silent scream as she clinched her eyes shut while she fell.</p>
<p>Landing upon a surface with a resounding <em>thud, </em>she groaned as the impact didn't treat her body too kindly. Picking her head up, she pushed herself off the ground, mindful of her body.</p>
<p>"Holy shit."</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as she took in the view of some type of space craft that she had never seen before. As she glanced around, her eyes landed on some sort of prison where a man seemed to be held. He wore a red shirt, and he was an older man with greying hair, but a kind face. He appeared to be hurt, if the sound of his ragged breathing was any indication.</p>
<p>From her view point, she could see all the different levels of the ship, not that she knew what anything was. The sound of approaching footsteps had her back-peddling to the underneath of a desk, of some sort.</p>
<p>"As soon as we can, destroy Vulcan. Spock is here to see the loss of his planet, he even has a front row seat."</p>
<p>"What about Pike, Sir?"</p>
<p>"After this is done, kill him."</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain Nero."</p>
<p>While they spoke, she peaked over the side of the desk to see who was speaking to whom. The Captain, who she now knew as Nero, headed off in the opposite direction of the other man. From the conversation, she could tell that he wasn't someone she needed to deal with.</p>
<p>He was ordering people to do things <em>for </em>him, not doing them himself. Eyeballing the lackey, she watched him walk down to another level, below.</p>
<p>Waving a hand, she disillusioned herself, and followed him along. She didn't know where she was, but she was damn sure not going to let a whole <em>planet </em>be destroyed. She'd panic about her situation later, right now, she had more important things to worry about.</p>
<p>Creeping along behind the man, she watched as he stopped at some kind of futuristic console. She couldn't tell what anything meant, but she knew, as soon as the large object from the ship began to activate, it was <em>bad. </em></p>
<p>Sending out a silent stupefy, she grinned as the man fell to the floor. Scurrying up to the console, she glanced over everything before growling in frustration.</p>
<p>
  <em>What the hell am I supposed to do?!</em>
</p>
<p>Biting her bottom lip, she took a chance and decided to contain the <em>thing, </em>with her magic. At least, she reckoned, she knew how to control <em>that.</em></p>
<p>Holding both hands up, palms up, she began chanting in Latin, as her fingers began tracing runes within the air. Grunting at the amount of power she was using, she continued until she had constructed the best cage for it.</p>
<p>As the wisps of magic began to interlock around the weapon like a type of basket weave, she watched as it began to constrict the object, obliterating it in the process.</p>
<p>Loud ringing began to sound as all this was happening, an alarm of some sorts, she mused, and she sprinted back up to the level the prison was on.</p>
<p>"Alohomora.."</p>
<p>The door opened, and she took one look at the man on the floor and gasped. Leaning down by his side, she tried to wake him up as gently as she could.</p>
<p>"Sir? Sir, <em>please</em>? Hello?"</p>
<p>"W-Who are you?"</p>
<p>"That's not important, Sir. I need you to help me if you want to live, Sir, can you do that?"</p>
<p>"What do you need me to do?"</p>
<p>"Think of somewhere safe, picture it in your mind. I need you to do this for me, don't ask why, just <em>do it.</em>"</p>
<p>She so wasn't getting that job at the Ministry after this, she just <em>knew</em> it.</p>
<p>"Alright, I've got it."</p>
<p>"Sir, keep picturing it, and <em>do not </em>open your eyes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>
  <em>"Just don't!"</em>
</p>
<p>Grabbing onto the man's right arm, she closed her eyes and gathered her magic around them. Just as she heard the sound of yelling and screaming, they disapperated from sight and apperated on the floor of the bridge of the<em> USS Enterprise.</em></p>
<p>Disorientated, she opened her eyes as the silence rang out around them. Everyone there seemed to be staring at them, but none of them were helping the man within her arms.</p>
<p>"<em>Hello?!</em> Dying man here, I need help!"</p>
<p>When no one bothered to say or do anything, she brought out her wand and began to run some diagnostic tests. While she ran those, she healed the problems she could see, from the outside. As soon as the other tests were done, she set about fixing him on the inside, as well.</p>
<p>No one said a word, as she did so.</p>
<p>"Captain, we're being hailed."</p>
<p>"Bring it up, Uhura."</p>
<p>"Ah, Nero, to what do we owe the pleasure?"</p>
<p>Glancing up, she saw the man from earlier, on the screen in front of them. His face was set in a scowl, and as soon as he saw her he let out a few choice words that she knew were not flattering even though she had never heard the language before.</p>
<p>"You're the one who destroyed the Red Matter drill!"</p>
<p>She frowned, "Is that what that was?"</p>
<p>Even though she didn't know what he was talking about, she decided to play like she did.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, next time I'll try to watch what I'm doing."</p>
<p>He grinned, "Too bad for you, Kirk, that that wasn't the only one I had made. Say farewell to Vulcan, we won't be seeing her again."</p>
<p>The screen went black, and everything went to chaos. Everyone around her was screaming,and all she could do was watch as another one of those weapons was brought out by the other ship. As she saw it point down to the red planet in front of them, <em>Vulcan</em>, she cursed inside her mind.</p>
<p>"I have to get down there!"</p>
<p>Her voice couldn't be heard over the others, so she sighed, and began the process of apparating to a place she had never been before. This wasn't something she had tried before, but there's always a first for everything, <em>right?</em></p>
<p>With a distinct <em>pop, </em>she reappeared down on the planet, a little worse for wear. Staring up at the menacing space ship, she eyed the drill, and estimated where it was pointing. As soon as she calculated that, she sprinted past everyone to find the ultimate spot for a shielding spell.</p>
<p>"Okay, here goes <em>nothing.."</em></p>
<p>Standing in the middle of town, she began more complex wand waving and spell casting. Even if someone had stopped to listen to what she was saying, she was speaking so fast that none of it would be heard.</p>
<p>Just like with the other spell, as she worked, her magic weaved across the planet, encasing it within a protective shield. She continued to add layer upon layer, to make the weave as thick as possible.</p>
<p>For added protection, she sliced her inner arm, and added blood magic to her spell. As her time ran out, <em>everyone,</em> from the Vulcan's on planet to the cadets on the ships, watched as the Red Matter shot out and hit the planet.</p>
<p>For a second, nothing could be heard, no one dared to breathe.</p>
<p>Two seconds passed, and the entire planet <em>shimmered </em>as the Red Matter bounced back out of it and hit the <em>Narada</em>, pulling it into a black hole before disappearing from sight.</p>
<p>As Everly watched this happen, she smiled.</p>
<p>
  <em>Finally, I know I did something right.</em>
</p>
<p>With that thought, her body succumbed to the exhaustion she was feeling, and she collapsed to the ground in a mindless heap.</p>
