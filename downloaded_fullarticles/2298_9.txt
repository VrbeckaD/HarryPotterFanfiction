    <p>White. </p><p>That’s what she noticed first. A whole lot of white. </p><p>White ceiling, as it turned out. Her vision solidified as she came back to complete consciousness. </p><p>Her eyes travelled over the crisp paint, following the intricate design of the ceiling rose, along the crisscrossing coffers and out to the delicate cornices. This was not a ceiling she knew. </p><p>Her eyes continued down the walls (also white) to flow over the elegant furnishings of rich silk brocade and mahogany, finally landing on the large French doors and balcony beyond. </p><p>Ah. Right. She was in Paris. </p><p>An exceptionally expensive hotel in Paris. </p><p>Yay work! </p><p>Not that work actually paid for this, but it brought her here. A change or hotel and an upgrade was simple enough to organise, and Ginny felt like if she was ever going to enjoy a splurge, Paris was the place to do it.</p><p>Ginny Weasley pulled herself out of bed and strolled to the doors, taking in the breathtaking view before her. Elegant buildings stretched in all directions, divided by wide avenues and narrow, cobbled alleys. The Eiffel Tower soared over everything, stoically romantic in the distance. </p><p>There was a pleasant blue, summery atmosphere resting like a blanket over the town. It would be a warm day, but not too hot hopefully. Though, it was still early, so who knew. </p><p>She thought about Hermione’s odd muggle phone thing. It would know. Muggles really did come up with the most interesting ways to get by without magic. In many ways, at least from what she understood talking to her muggleborn friends, beginning to surpass wizarding society… which was a slightly unsettling thought. </p><p>She thought briefly about going outside, eyeing the elegant handle in contemplation, but eventually decided against it.</p><p>Instead, she shuffled to the bathroom, splashed water on her face, and dressed. </p><p>A pair of white capris (it really was the colour of the day, it seemed) and a light blue polo shirt later, Ginny grabbed her wand and purse before heading to the door. </p><p>*	*	*</p><p>Downstairs, Ginny was wolfing down a mammoth breakfast in the opulent hotel dining room, when she was joined by her friends.</p><p>Luna Lovegood glided down next to her, snagging a piece of melon. “Good morning, Ginny.” She chimed.</p><p>“Really, Ginevra, could you eat with any less decorum?” drawled Blaise Zabini, as he lowered himself gracefully into the chair opposite. “You have enough food here to feed an armada. And is that three sausages? Are you eating for two or something?”</p><p>Ginny, mouth full, rolled her eyes dramatically. They all knew very well she wasn’t eating for two. Ginny couldn’t remember the last time she’d gotten laid. The Stone Age perhaps. </p><p>“Ginny just has a healthy appetite, My Love.” Replied Luna. “You know that.”</p><p>Blaise hummed in disapproval. “Well, at least sit up straight. You look like you’re afraid someone will take it all away.”</p><p>Ginny swallowed, irritated. “If you don’t like my eating habits, don’t watch me eat. You can go somewhere else.” But she did adjust her posture. She hadn’t been intentionally hunching over. </p><p>Blaise grinned. “That wouldn’t be nearly as entertaining.”</p><p>Ginny went back to eating, grumbling about arsehole brunettes who ought to know when to mind their own business.</p><p>It had surprised Ginny, when she had realised that Blaise was not only her friend, but one of her closest. </p><p>They met six years after she graduated Hogwarts, at a Ministry benefit for Elfish rights. Ginny had demanded, absolutely irate, to know why he was there. After all, the event was organised by Hermione and he was a Slytherin, one of Malfoy’s lot too. Surely an event such as this was scraping the bottom of the barrel for him.  </p><p>Blaise had smirked, bowed, declared he was delighted to see her again too, and turned to address the person slightly to her left. </p><p>Hermione.</p><p>“Thank you for the invitation, Hermione.” He had said, perfectly at ease. “I’m more than happy to support such a worthy cause. Whatever is in my power, just let me know.”</p><p>Hermione had smiled, thanked him, glared daggers at Ginny, and returned to greeting guests. </p><p>Ginny had later found out that Blaise was one of the lawyers involved with the charity, though she couldn’t fathom why to begin with. She had spent that night trying to figure it out. Blaise, she now knew, had found it incredibly amusing to watch her try all her tricks to get him to spill. </p><p>He didn’t, of course. Instead, he had artfully directed their conversation to the other guests, despite her best efforts. </p><p>It turned out that he was one of the wittiest people Ginny had ever met. He knew all kinds of gossip.  He exclaimed over the International Relations Minister, Laurietta Pierce, and her affair with her secretary. He remarked on the Magical Games and Sports undersecretary’s penchant for Belladonna. He revealed the closely guarded secret of Mario Grug, the senior editor of The Daily Prophet, who happened to have a second family in Chiswick. </p><p>Ginny considered most of it to be fiction. She was in the information game, after all, and was quite sure that she would have heard of some of this at some point. Mind you, the Mario Grug story might be worth a look. </p><p>Ginny was the ‘star reporter’ for The Prophet’s sports section. She truly enjoyed her job, but often felt that she would like to transition into other areas of journalism. Something on Grug, though she would be loath to use it, might come in handy one day. </p><p>In any case, by the end of the night, Ginny had garnered no more information about Blaise’s presence. </p><p>She hadn’t given up though. She did what she always did in such a situation. She dug.</p><p>And all she’d found was that she enjoyed his company, and that he treated his own house elves with respect. His free, paid house elves. </p><p>The true solidifying of their friendship, however, had come when she discovered that he was dating Luna. Ginny had been a tad hurt that her friend hadn’t shared that fact earlier. But Luna had assured her it was very new, and she had had every intension of telling her if she thought it would surpass the constantly-shagging stage. </p><p>It never did quite pass that stage. They were still constantly shagging. But now, three years later, they were spending equal amounts of time with Ginny, often telling her far more than she’d like to know about said shagging. They were both terribly open. Luna, because she had always overshared with everyone, especially Ginny; and Blaise, because he knew she really didn’t want to know. </p><p>“We thought we’d go to the Louvre today.” Luna said, tactfully changing the subject. “Would you like to come with us?”</p><p>Yes, was what Ginny wanted to say. She’d love to go. She wanted to go. She even wouldn’t mind going with them. Blaise would probably have all kinds of stories (made up or otherwise) about the artists and the people in the portraits. Plus, the  wing in the sub-sub-basement was said to be the best collection of wizarding art in the world. </p><p>“You know I have to work.” Ginny replied, with a little rancour. </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous!” retorted Blaise. “What’s the point of a holiday in Paris if you don’t see Paris?”</p><p>“I’m not on holiday! I’m here for work. Yesterday’s Quidditch match, remember? I have an article to write. I told you this when you said you wanted to come!” God, he was aggravating. She didn’t know why she bothered. She’d said all this before. He never listened. </p><p>“Oh please, Ginny?” reasoned Luna, “You spent all yesterday evening on your article. It’s got to be almost finished now. We’re leaving tomorrow, and your deadline’s not until Monday. Surely you can take a break and enjoy Paris, just for today.”</p><p>Ginny groaned. Her friend was right, technically, her article was almost finished. She really could spend the day with them without endangering her deadline. She just really didn’t like to leave anything half done. What if she forgot something important? And they should know that about her! They’d crashed her work trip without asking, then expected her to just drop everything and go sightseeing with them? So not ok. Plus, what if Ginny had had her own ideas about what she wanted to do today? </p><p>Ginny had, despite logically knowing it was ridiculous, had the slightly romantic vision of herself wandering aimlessly through the city and running into the man who would turn out to be Mr Right. Her more realistic vision was finding a Mr Right Now. You can’t do that with your best friends in tow. </p><p>But, perhaps she could slip away from them at some point. Yes, maybe that would work. And she would get to see the Louvre. </p><p>*	*	*</p><p>Well, her plan had half worked. </p><p>The Louvre was amazing, both the muggle and wizarding sections. Blaise had a wonderful conspiracy theory going on whether or not other patrons were casing the place. It got more and more outlandish, as Ginny and Luna added to the story; Ginny in jest, Luna in some kind of mix of humour and earnestness. You never could tell with her. </p><p>Eventually, when it devolved into Blaise making innuendos about the guards, Ginny decided to see if she could slip away. </p><p>It was easy enough, as she just began wandering in a different direction. </p><p>The whole Mr Right Now thing, of course, never eventuated. In truth, it was no more realistic an idea as the Mr Right version. You don’t just bump into people, drag them into a closet and shag their brains out. That doesn’t happen. It’s ridiculous. Well, ok, she was imagining a slightly more complex scenario, including giggling and drinks between the meeting and the closet. But still. </p><p>So, Ginny ended up dawdling out of the Louvre and along the Seine. She stopped a few times, to take in the view or peruse some of the little souvenir stalls. </p><p>Ginny was a bit of a sucker for souvenirs, so it was no surprise that she came away with a painting, several post cards (muggles were brilliant!), and a few pieces of jewellery, and a couple of knickknacks for her friends. </p><p>Mid-afternoon found her at a little café, sipping coffee and nibbling at a pastry. She watched passers-by from over the top of her sunglasses (because that’s what an elegant person did in Paris, right?) and admired the new golden charm bracelet on her wrist. </p><p>She wondered at her stupidity. She could have been enjoying Paris with her friends, not sitting here on her own.</p><p>She knew (she knew!) that Prince Charming didn’t just drop in out of the sky. Life didn’t work like that. And besides, she was Ginny Weasley! She was The Prophet’s best sports reporter. She’d won awards! She was twenty-six years old and there was absolutely nothing wrong with her being single. It was perfectly natural in this day and age. </p><p>So what if her mum kept hinting that she’d love to see Ginny ‘happy and settled’ like her brothers (well, most of them… everyone had all but given up on Charlie). Molly Weasley had ten grandchildren already. She could wait for the next instalment. </p><p>And So what if she had a tiny voice in her own head saying that she wanted that too. She still had time. She still had almost a decade before the clock started slowing down, several years until she really had any reason to listen to its ticking. It didn’t matter that that ticking was getting just a teensy bit louder already. She’d be fine. </p><p>It wasn’t like she was the only one still single either, or the only one without kids. Luna and Blaise weren’t at that point yet, even though they’d been together so long. They weren’t even married. They weren’t even thinking about getting married. Plus, many of her other friends were single or wending their way through short term dalliances, just like her.</p><p>Well, not just like her. They hadn’t been single for the majority of their adult lives. Don’t get her wrong, Ginny had had boyfriends. Quite a few at Hogwarts. And she’d dated Harry for two years after school finished. Plus, there’d been that incredibly unfortunate few months with Oliver Wood while she was still playing for the Harpies. And a few one night stands here and there that she’d never told anyone about.</p><p>God, she was pathetic. </p><p>Pathetic, single, spinster Weasley, that’s what she was. She’d get to watch her nieces and nephews grow up, showering them with love and gifts (because she was the cool Aunt who bucked tradition). She’d be the one who hadn’t let a man define her life. She’d be the one with an amazing career that took her all over the world. </p><p>Ginny looked down at her pastry. She’d torn it to shreds without eating a bite. Great. Pathetic, single, and now pastry-less. </p><p>Ugh! Now Ginny felt pathetic for feeling so pathetic. Stupid vicious cycle. </p><p>No! Stupid Paris! That was it. It was this stupid romantic town filling her brain with stupid medieval visions of true loves and happily-ever-afters. It was all Paris’s fault! She wasn’t this soppy, starry-eyed woman longing for a man! She was a feminist, for Circe’s sake!</p><p>*	*	*</p><p>When she returned to her hotel, the receptionist gave her a message from Luna. She and Blaise had gone to some kind of show. They’d told her the address and to come if she wanted, but otherwise to enjoy her evening.</p><p>Ginny went back up to her room to finish her article. </p><p>Stupid Paris.</p>
