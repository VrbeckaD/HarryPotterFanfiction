    <p>It had been a three or four years since the war had ended and for that time the world had been quiet. Harry became a healer in that time, Hermione got a job at the ministry of magic and Ron opened a shop. Harry had not forgotten the great many misfortunes of his past but he had learned to move on with his life in spite of them. <br/>Harry had not seen Draco Malfoy since his trial after the war, Malfoy was found not guilty but he still disappeared the very same night of the trial and had not been heard from or seen by anyone since. People speculated that he may have ran off to some distant estate  in Ireland in shame of what he had done during the war but nobody had any real proof that that was the case. That was until he came back that is.<br/>It was a rainy evening in mid November. Harry had just gotten home from his shift at St. Mungo's and had changed out of his work uniform when he heard a knocking on the door. When he opened the door there stood Draco Malfoy drenched to the bone from the rain and looking tired and emaciated. Harry ushered Draco inside of the flat. <br/>“Merlin's saggy tits!” Harry said in a breathy tone “Where have you been these past few years, why were you out in the cold and rain? How are you? Why are you here?”<br/>Despite the many questions Malfoy had been berated with in rapid succession he only stood there shivering and dripping rain on the carpet. <br/>“You're dripping on my carpet, I'll go get you a towel.” <br/>Harry runs off towards some back room to get a towel and Malfoy just stands there in the same position, just shivering. Only when Harry came back a few moments later and handed him a towel did he snap out of his dazed, trance like state. <br/>“Oh, thank you… I'm sorry, I spaced out there for a moment, it all affected me more than I had expected it to.”<br/>“What all affected you?”<br/>“Seeing you again, being here, being back.”</p>
