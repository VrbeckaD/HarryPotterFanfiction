<p> </p>
<p>Hermione paced nervously, trying to determine how to explain the situation to her husband. A difficult task, indeed, since she didn't fully understand it herself. Pulling the cover over the top of the basket, she knocked on the Headmaster's door.</p>
<p>Severus looked up, one corner of his mouth tipping up upon seeing his wife.</p>
<p>Hermione carefully set her burden down on a chair. “I'm sorry to disturb you, love. But it seems we have a bit of a problem.”</p>
<p>His half smile turned into a frown. “Oh, what's that?”</p>
<p>“There's a delivery for Neville, but I can't find him anywhere.”</p>
<p>Severus relaxed visibly. “No problem. Have one of the house-elves take it to the greenhouse.”</p>
<p>With a grimace and shake of her head, she replied. “It's a rather... unusual... delivery. Not something that can safely be left unattended.”</p>
<p>Trusting her judgment, he called a house-elf to locate Longbottom and return him to Hogwarts. Soon, a knock came on the door.</p>
<p>“Severus?” Neville entered. “What's going on? Tiki implied there's some sort of emergency.”</p>
<p>“I'm not sure myself, but I expect Hermione is going to enlighten us.” Severus looked sternly at his wife.</p>
<p>“Of course...” Hermione reached for the bundle but was interrupted by a high pitched squeal.</p>
<p>“Sweet Circe! Is that a baby Mandrake? Cover your ears!” Severus drew his wand, but Hermione waved him off.</p>
<p>“No need, dear. It's not a Mandrake.” Lifting the bundle gently, she turned. “But you are half right. It is a baby.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Neville. I wasn't trying to pry, but I didn't know what else to do.” She handed him the note she'd opened. “According to this, she's yours.”</p>
<p>Neville gulped, eyes rolling back in his head, he slumped bonelessly to the floor.</p>
<p>She turned to Severus. “Do you think it was something I said?”</p></div>
