    <p>There had been times when the footsteps coming down the stone stairway had been, careful, measured, sober. Unfortunately that had happened only twice, early on in her captivity. All the more recent times, the gait heard was irregular, sloppy, punctuated with cursing and accompanied by whisky fumes. Those were the worst times, at least initially. The very worst she found, were when the Dark Lord accompanied Lucius, and left Ollivander broken and shaking. She had tried to soothe the frail wizard, traumatized within and without by the pain inflicted through and through. Lucius eyed her with contempt at those times when he was in the company of his master, but the Dark Lord was aware of Lucius' true thoughts regarding the girl.</p><p>The heavy door always opened by Lucius' command. On the occasions when he was alone, there was inevitably either a sneer or a leer upon his face depending on how much he had to drink. Even lacking a wand, he knew he could get her to obey, he didn’t need to use much force – a slap or a hard shove was enough to get her compliance. Ollivander had tried to defend her with shaming words hurled at their captor and once had even stepped in front of her to block Lucius, but that earned him a broken cheekbone and nose from the arrogant wizard’s fist, so he had only used words after that. </p><p>But now the familiar footfalls and drawled words coming down the granite stairs had a second set of steps mixed in, along with an unfamiliar voice. That voice made the hair on the back of her neck prickle from its icy harshness. The accent was firmly Scottish, not one often heard in Malfoy Manor, or in the social circles of the posh English wizard.</p><p>The enchanted door swung open and the conversation continued as the pair of Death Eaters stepped into the chilly dungeon. “You see Yaxley, when the Dark Lord paid his last visit to Ollivander here,” the words were accompanied by a nod in the elderly wizard’s direction, “he made it clear that any of us could have the wandmaker do some custom work. I'm having Ollivander’s stock of elm brought over tomorrow so he can select a piece to craft into a wand for me. He’ll be under close monitoring when he’s working on it.” He glared fiercely. “Ollivander!” The usual drawl was instead sharp and commanding as he spat out the name.</p><p>Luna watched from her shadowed vantage point as the elderly wandmaker got up from where he had been lying next to the wall. His thin face grimaced as he got up, from pain that was a remnant of the Dark Lord's previous visit. He moved in obvious discomfort, his left leg limping as he hobbled towards the two Dark wizards and greeted them in a voice that had become even fainter with significant hunger and thirst. “Mr Malfoy, Mr Yaxley, how may I be of service to you?”</p><p> With the wizards gathered in the portion of the large room where there was the best light, Luna could not help but notice that the gravelly growl that responded did not match up to the sartorial choices of the elegantly-clad wizard who had accompanied Lucius. The wizard’s bespoke suit, his heavy gold cufflinks and watch-chain, his meticulously placed Ministry of Magic tie tack and his well-shined shoes, all murmured vaults of old money and refinement. The wizard’s voice and face however, she thought, would not have seemed out of place for a bouncer at a dodgy tavern or something perhaps even more brutal and sinister. He was not one to be trifled with. He generated a silent sense of power, seeming that he would be at home in any setting. The fact that he held a lit cigar in one hand and a tumbler of single-malt in the other, gave a clue as to the source of his voice’s remarkable timbre. “Ollivander, I need you to craft a wand for me after you finish Malfoy’s. I want either alder or blackthorn with a dragon heartstring core.”</p><p>Ollivander nodded.  “My stocks of both woods are scant, Sir, but I will send for them and look them over.” </p><p> The young witch paid little attention to the wizards’ conversation as she studied the newcomer. The other thing which struck her about him was that he was grim. That was really the best word she could sum him up with at the moment. At no time had she seen a hint of good nature evident upon his craggy face. He wasn’t merely businesslike or intense. He was grim in a way that rejected pleasantries from others without a word being spoken. He wasn’t morose. No, the look on his face was watchful, calculating, as if assessing for weakness or hairline cracks of some form of vulnerability where pressure could be applied to make his target shatter. He was obviously a Slytherin, and a highly successful one at that. His demeanor made her shiver. She was sorry that Ollivander was of use to him, but thankful that she was of no interest. He looked like a wizard who enjoyed interrogating, probing, breaking his victims. She held breathlessly still.</p><p>As the two wizards turned to leave, Luna inched silently deeper back into the shadows, but the slight movement caught the eye of the older wizard who stopped and narrowed his eyes, gazing into the gloom in the girl's direction as he spoke to his host, “Spare piece, Lucius?”</p><p>The manor owner’s tone was contemptuous, “Not for me. The Dark Lord wants that shite rag known as The Quibbler shut down. Her father,” he gestured lazily with his glass, “is the owner. The idea is that if Lovegood stops printing, he might get her back at some point.”</p><p>Yaxley looked irritated, “Whose numpty idea was that?”</p><p>Lucius was clearly offended and his tone was haughty, “Draco came up with that idea.”</p><p>The old Death Eater let out a snort of contempt. “Your boy would choose the soft option. I’d be willing to say he had the idea of helping himself to her. If you really wanted to stop her father from publishing, you’d kill him. Bringing her here tells me somebody wanted something else and I’d bet it’s between her thighs.”</p><p>He vanished his cigar and crooked a finger at her, beckoning. She moved cautiously towards him, staring at his large gold ring with its black stone, not daring to look at his face. She was acutely aware that her hair was a tangled mess and her clothes were torn and grimy. Her disheveled state left her feeling very vulnerable. He raised his eyebrows as she stopped, just a bit out of arm’s reach. “Here, witch!” It was a voice that gave no room for even a hint of refusal. He pointed to the ground directly in front of him and a fear-driven tear rolled silently down her cheek as she moved to where he wanted her to be. He reached out his hand to push her tangled curls away from her face. </p><p> It all seemed to be happening in slow motion for Luna. She noted as his hand came towards her, that his nails were neatly manicured which seemed odd to her. His fingertips were soft against her cheek and she picked up the scent of his expensive cigar as he leisurely trailed his hand down her pale neck, pausing to feel the hammering of her pulse on the side of her throat. She was very aware that he was studying her. He found her so appealingly vulnerable with her wide teary eyes, torn clothes and trembling. So much more enticing than the ones he interrogated in his Ministry work with Umbridge – there were always too many officials around there for his interactions with the prisoners to be as enjoyable as possible. This situation offered an exceptional opportunity. Here was a differently delicious situation to exploit. </p><p> Luna saw his thin, predatory smile as he spoke to Lucius. “I’d give a guess that she was a virgin when she arrived here.” He suddenly chuckled as he continued to stare at her, “She has no Occlumency skills. It would seem that when your boy came down to give his tadger a thrill, he found you upon her, you old dog!” He elbowed Lucius who tried to maintain a semblance of dignity, despite being a disheveled drunk. His face dimpled with a smirk, “Tell you what, Lucius, I’ll go take care of that bit of business with her father, and I’ll take the girl for mine. Narcissa’s probably less than happy that you’re not even bothering to get much beyond earshot to land on some strange quim. I’ll get your wee blonde schoolgirl temptation out of here.”</p><p>Lucius blurted out, “Rodolphus and Rabastan said they wanted to pay her a visit this afternoon.  Wormtail must’ve said something to them.”</p><p>A shadow of disgust traced over the older Death Eater’s features which Luna would’ve missed had she not been staring intently at him. She couldn’t have said why he held her interest. Certainly, her safety, or lack thereof, had been under Lucius' control, so her focus should’ve been on the wizard who held her fate in his hands. It was the old, cold Death Eater who held her troubled gaze. He eyed her briefly before telling Lucius decisively, “I’ll take her home with me.”</p><p>Luna was surprised that Lucius acquiesced without another word. He had a look of tense annoyance at being told what to do as a sulky child might at being told it was bedtime, but knew better than to utter a word of protest against the decision handed down by this wizard. Luna was alarmed. She had understood Lucius to be among the Dark Lord's inner circle and thus very powerful and respected among the Death Eaters, yet this stranger was taking charge and Lucius did nothing to contradict him. </p><p> She felt pain as he swiftly clenched his fingers tightly onto her upper arm. He ignored her whimper. Luna realized that since he could’ve easily used magic to control her, but instead chose to use physical means, that he was more likely to be physical in his other interactions with her. This was not reassuring. As his grip impelled her towards the door, she cast a look back at Ollivander who looked nearly as pained at her being taken away by this Death Eater as he did after being tortured by the Dark Lord. </p><p>Since it was impossible to Apparate from the dungeon, Yaxley brought her upstairs. Lucius’ hand squeezed her bottom repeatedly as the three of them made their way up the stone steps. She did not hesitate on the way up, afraid Yaxley might hurl her down the long stone stairway if she annoyed him. There were too many unknowns for her, so she remained compliant and quiet, hoping that would help avoid some amount of suffering which she was sure he could easily dish out.</p><p>Draco stared in silent alarm at the sight of the young witch nervously standing next to the visiting Death Eater, fearing that his schoolmate's future was likely to be bleak, brutal, and brief. He hoped for her sake it would not be prolonged. Draco knew enough about Yaxley to have an idea what Luna's fate would likely be. Yaxley's reputation for enjoying the interrogations of prisoners at the Ministry of Magic was what was most widely known about his pleasures. Draco knew some of the interrogations were reviewed in detail at Death Eater gatherings since the Dark Lord derived amusement from hearing about such things. The Dark Lord himself voiced the thought, jokingly of course, that Yaxley's ancestors must have included a Dementor, as Yaxley enjoyed the suffering of others so very much.</p><p> Narcissa sneered at Luna, then glared at Lucius who slid his hand away from Luna's bottom. She addressed Yaxley cordially in her refined voice, “Borrowing or keeping?”</p><p>“Keeping.” His face was like stone, except for the glint of anticipation in his eyes. Narcissa was sure her husband would never have another chance to use Luna. Clearly, Yaxley had claimed the girl for his own purposes, and whatever those were, Narcissa did not care, despite the troubled look on her son's face. She had chosen to keep her drunk husband out of her own bed, but she'd be damned if she would tolerate his forays into the dungeon when he thought she didn't notice, or worse, didn't care if she knew.</p><p> “Good.”  The elegant witch turned heel and left the room, leaving Luna with Yaxley, Lucius, Draco, and Wormtail who openly leered at the prisoner as he rubbed his hands together. Yaxley’s glass was refilled by a house-elf. The old Death Eater spoke to Lucius, “I’ll check back in about two weeks to follow up with Ollivander. The Dark Lord may well convene us before then though.” He nodded at Draco and ignored Wormtail before grabbing Luna again. Lucius nodded in silent irritation. Then Yaxley and Luna stepped into the fireplace and departed.</p>
