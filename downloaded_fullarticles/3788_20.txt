—Allen Ginsberg</p><p><strike>Dearest</strike> Harry,</p><p>Scratch that. I’ll not bore you with introductions, not after all this time. I’ll skip the niceties, I know I’m inclined to ramble some.</p><p>This is for you. My <em>‘pretty words’</em> as I think you’ve often asserted; or something to that effect.</p><p>I’m flattered, really, but also slightly affronted. See, I wasn’t even <em>trying </em>to be pretty. I can’t give you pretty, but I can give you honest, certainly. I can give you sincere.</p><p>I’m an open book, Harry. For you, at least...</p><p>By all means, read honest, read pretty, read devoted. Read whatever you like, and I’ll do as most poets do and say nothing.</p><p>Nothing but this.</p><p>-</p><p>The sour taste of the envelope as I seal it closed<br/>
Is always so apt.<br/>
It is bitter like dark chocolate<br/>
Like a note off key.<br/>
I’m always afraid I’ll cut my tongue on the leaf,<br/>
Slice it open and bleed into you<br/>
What is already yours.</p><p>I shake myself<br/>
Drizzle the wax<br/>
And stamp.<br/>
Our mouths crash together<br/>
Like waves.</p><p>The foolproof vest<br/>
My chest<br/>
Potter, I am packed full<br/>
Of protections<br/>
Delicate like a porcelain teacup<br/>
But so large and open and<br/>
Ready to take in<br/>
Hold up all your love.</p><p>I’ve always been hoping for you, Harry.</p><p>Oh how you always outbloomed me<br/>
As hard as I tried<br/>
As poised as I was, you always found a way to see through me<br/>
These letters I fashioned<br/>
The flowers were fake<br/>
My words were real<br/>
But I liked them<br/>
Because they never died on me.</p><p>Look at me.<br/>
Even now, I’m still writing.<br/>
Even now, I know you still read them.<br/>
Even when I’ve got you close to my chest.<br/>
A splinter that I never could dig out<br/>
Scratching words I never could speak<br/>
Into you.<br/>
All over you.</p><p>That’s where they go, you know.<br/>
Merlin knows, every single word, it tattoos you.<br/>
That ghastly scar<br/>
<em>I must not tell lies</em><br/>
With every word of this<br/>
I know<br/>
I’ve written over it a million times.</p><p>Because Harry, you deserve the rehearsal<br/>
The planned and the perfected.<br/>
I’m a perfectionist and so I’m never satisfied.<br/>
You are like nothing I can express</p><p>I’ve been trying to find the right way to start.<br/>
Been trying to unstopper the cork<br/>
Like expensive champagne and fizzle out the lip<br/>
Fizzle all over you.</p><p>But it’s helpless.<br/>
My mouth flutters open and stops.<br/>
The rain beats a melody outside.</p><p>I remember you,<br/>
Yesterday.<br/>
How beautiful you looked in the rain,<br/>
The fat raindrops<br/>
That travelled down the nape of your neck<br/>
How they said things I never could.<br/>
I was so overcome,<br/>
The water rushed over the both of us<br/>
I held you<br/>
And that was enough.</p><p>I know I pick my flowers carefully<br/>
The things I want to say to you<br/>
And I wonder<br/>
Why I have this<br/>
Obssession with saying<br/>
With memorising every part of you.</p><p>Here’s violets to describe my gratitude<br/>
And red roses for everything else.</p><p>For when I held your letters up and breathed them in<br/>
There’s something of you in them<br/>
Something selfish and greedy<br/>
That I rather feel I’ve stolen when I write down the feeling of my lips against your neck.</p><p>And here’s the truth, Harry.<br/>
As flowers always do<br/>
I think I’m afraid, someday, you’ll outgrow me.</p><p>But it’s no matter.<br/>
Tonight is enough<br/>
Tomorrow,<br/>
Three weeks from<br/>
Now.<br/>
Every single day until then<br/>
It’s enough.</p><p>It’s blazing a storm outside now<br/>
And I know every beat of<br/>
Each branch<br/>
Approves of us, Harry.</p><p>I love you</p><p>I love you</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Yours, for as long as you’ll have me,</p><p>
  <em>D. Malfoy</em>
</p><p>(P.S. I hope you enjoy today’s quote. Do me a favour and don’t ask me why it’s one line long. Merlin, whatever you do, don’t try and fathom the rest of it out. I’m sure your mind will go the exact same place as mine did. Truly, I’m a heathen...)</p></div>
