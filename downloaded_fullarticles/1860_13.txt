    <p>
  <span>“I’m here,”  Harry announced his voice hard as he stepped into the entrance hall of Malfoy Manor.  He had had to push through the guards, he even killed some of them, maimed others, but there was no way he would allow them to claim that they had brought him in.  “Voldemort I’m here!” He yelled wishing to face his death with his head held high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you are.” The high pleased tone of the monster he had been fighting his entire life rang from the upper level.  He descended the stairs; his crimson eyes entirely focused on Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s attention shifted to the two prone figures floating just behind the monster, and his face hardened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Snap your wand, and I will free them.”  Voldemort smiled motioning to his two best friends.  “Be the martyr we all know you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to say goodbye.”  He said, the man at least owed him that much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you must.”  the Dark Lord sneered and with a wave of his wand the two sprang to life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched them struggle against Voldemort's magical hold but knew it was useless unless the man set them free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You only have a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry guys.  I can’t think of another way.”  Harry said and watched as Ron kept struggling.  Hermione was shaking her head, mouthing something he could not understand as Voldemort kept them silenced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pulled the two DA coins from his pocket and tossed one at each of them as he activated the portkey spell.  He would be sure they were safe before he took the last steps into death’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they were gone there was a silence as the dark wizard waited for Harry’s next move.  He looked down at the wand in his hands before gripping it in two fists and snapping it in half.  The feeling of loss almost made his knee buckle, but he would not give the Dark Lord the satisfaction of seeing his weakness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort started to laugh; it was a monstrous sound that vibrated directly down to Harry’s gut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t fight.”  He said dropping the pieces of his wand at his sides as he looked death in the face.  He could make this sacrifice now. With him dead, Voldemort would be mortal, and others could continue the fight.  “I won’t run.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The joy on the snake man’s face was something to fear.  He took the last few steps down to the main level and summoned the pieces of Harry’s wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You expect me to kill you? Now, why would I do such a </span>
  <em>
    <span>foolish </span>
  </em>
  <span>thing?”  He asked curiously, an all too knowing expression lighting his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s face suddenly floated unbidden before his mind’s eyes.  She was desperately trying to tell him something, and all too suddenly he understood her words.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t.  He knows.  Last Horcrux. Run.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The blood drained from Harry’s face as he was frozen in a fear unlike any he had ever known before.  He was ready to face death; he was prepared for this all to be over. He could handle letting someone else fight for once.  But that wasn’t the offer. Not if the Dark Lord knew the truth of what they were to each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kneel to your Lord,”  Voldemort ordered his expression hungry now that he was so close to what he wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” Harry squared his jaw and straightened his back; maybe there was still hope, perhaps he could incite Voldemort into killing him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Crucio!”  The man said the word slowly savoring the spell on his lips as Harry dropped to his knees in pain.  He did not cry out; he would not give Voldemort the pleasure of hearing him scream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held Harry in the state of agony as he approached at an almost lazy pace.  “Such a strong-willed beast.” He commented as he lifted the spell and started to circle Harry’s prone form.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the animal.”  Harry ground out even as his body trembled with the phantom pain.  “More </span>
  <em>
    <span>snake </span>
  </em>
  <span>than man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Long spider-like fingers curled into messy raven locks and pulled Harry’s head back with a snap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to see exactly how much of a man I am, </span>
  <em>
    <span>boy</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”  He asked as crimson orbs studied his face.  The fingers of his free hand brushed over Harry’s lips in a gentle stroke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Harry could think of a response to such a jarring question they were interrupted by someone moving quickly into the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Lord, Dolohov is dead!”  Lucius called as he came running into the room.  “Along with three snatchers. I think Pot…” He stopped suddenly, and Harry figured he noticed him in the middle of the hall for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you kill my servants Harry?”  The man asked as if he was a pet that whizzed on the rug.  The hand on his hair pulled at him more tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.  Bloodied more.”  He replied smiling at the man as Harry wasn’t going to show this man the guilt he felt about any life he took, not after all the people, the light had lost.  He could show no weakness now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll have to be punished.”  He informed Harry, but he seemed pleased with the idea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Lord?”  Lucius asked the bastard sounded confused, unsure of what to do after coming upon his leader in what must have looked like a twisted embrace with the enemy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have things well in hand Lucius.  I will want a report on the damage Harry caused within the hour.”  He said as he stroked Harry’s cheek like someone petting a favored dog. Harry jerked away from his hand and wondered if he could get a good kick on the monster’s leg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my Lord.”  The man said, and Harry could hear his footsteps rushing away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t kill me now, I will make sure you regret it,”  Harry said with all the menace in his soul.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, will you?”  Voldemort asked sounding delighted.  “How will you do that my precious little Horcrux?  What will you risk to bring me low?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will </span>
  <em>
    <span>never </span>
  </em>
  <span>stop fighting you.”  He said with every piece of conviction in his heart.  He would spend the rest of his life to strike whatever blows he could on the man he had made his life hell or so long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you tired of all that, my sweetling?”  He asked as if he cared about Harry. It was very unsettling to have Voldemort talking to him like this, but he shook it away.  “The Light has used you badly, but your Lord will make the hurt go away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will never give in to you,”  Harry said shaking his head what little he could in the older man’s tight grip.  “You have no power over me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have all the power here.”  He said leaning down so he could hiss into Harry’s ear.  “I will know your every weakness; I will discover every pain written on your soul.  We have all the time in the world, you and I.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry jerked his head free of the man’s grasp and used it to slam against Voldemort’s face.  His ear hurt, but he used the man’s surprise to get to his feet and out of the wizard’s grasp.  Harry was halfway to the door when his legs locked, sending him flying into the ground. He caught himself before his face made contact and rolled over to face his attacker once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will destroy you!”  He yelled as he tried to think of something to do about the binding on his legs without magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will be my willing slave or I will hurt those who you try so hard to protect.”  He promised, a cruel smile coming back to his face as he looked down on his prey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s gut churned, and his mind reeled over how much Voldemort already knew of his character.  He would do just about anything to keep his friends safe; he would sacrifice his own pride to prevent anyone else from dying for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t hurt what you don’t have.”  He said and worked his hardest to keep the fear from his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could take you down to the dungeon so you could see exactly what I have.  But if you force me to prove myself I will kill one of them in the most painful way I can imagine.  I have a very active imagination when it comes to pain Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s clenched his jaw because he was sure that Voldemort would kill someone just as he promised, he didn’t need to know the person’s name to care if they died by the Dark Lord’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My rules and punishments will always be very clear, Harry.”  He said as if that should be a comfort. “Nothing I do to you will ever be without reason.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Names?”  Harry asked trying to get something.  He didn’t want to think why the man was trying to manipulate him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Minerva McGonagall.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is dead,”  Harry said though no one had ever found her body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Has been in my dungeon for three months.”  Voldemort corrected. He tried not to show his doubt at the dark wizard’s words, he needed to be strong and tell himself it was all a lie, but in the end, he closed his eyes and nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked down at his knees and swallowed thickly.  “You won’t hurt anyone else if I do this?” Harry asked resigned to whatever fate had in store for him.  He could still fight, he just needed to stall until he could figure out his next move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will continue to defend myself, and my way of life.  I am not ending this war for the feel of your lips wrapped around my phallus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s head snapped up at the lewd comment, and he had a sudden realization of exactly what Voldemort would do with him.  He felt sick, and his heart raced in his chest. He could not keep his eyes away from the man crotch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if you are a good slave, I will be as merciful as I am able.”  The man promised. “I want your willing submission Harry, and I will pay much for it.”  He cooed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine.”  Harry snapped knowing that his will and pride were not too high a price for people’s lives.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good boy,”  Voldemort said as he slowly approached Harry’s prone form.  “Tell me what you are, say the words.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am your willing slave.”  He said and looked away from the man as his heart raced in his chest painfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will call me your Master.”  He ordered sounding pleased with his compliance; Harry didn’t want to see his expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Master,”  Harry said, knowing exactly what Voldemort wanted. He thought he might be sick at the man gently brushed fingers through his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good boy.”  The Dark Lord praised right before he stunned Harry with a wordless spell.</span>
