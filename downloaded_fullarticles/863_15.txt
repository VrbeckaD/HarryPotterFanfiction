  <p class="p5">

</blockquote><hr/><p class="p7"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1">It was always misty in the mornings on Long Island: the vapor clung to the branches of the trees and hung low on the grounds like bedsheets laid across a clothesline. The sight made Credence think of laundry days at Miss Barebone’s, which made his stomach twist uneasily. He didn’t miss the school at all—there hadn’t been anything to miss there for a long time—but the reminder of it was tempered by the peace of mornings at the estate. At Miss Barebone’s, mornings were either bitterly cold or sweltering, depending on the season, and always colored by anxiety: rushed splashes of water from a basin shared with the other boys, shuffling to morning services before choking down breakfast, which was always the same watery oatmeal and muddy coffee. By contrast, lingering over breakfast with Newt and Mrs. Esposito seemed like the most illicit luxury. There was a curious lightness in his chest at all times now that had unsettled him at first until the end of his first week when he realized that the sensation was freedom.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> To Credence, who had spent most of his twenty-two years in a tenement-turned-school, and whose own room had been little bigger than a closet, it seemed that he had moved into a palace out of the fairy tales he hadn’t been permitted to read. His bedroom was easily the size of their dining room back home, with large windows that let in the light and overlooked the grounds. He had his own office, with a desk of his own and bookshelves, which was adjoined to his new employer’s office. Although Mr. Graves was away in town, Credence didn’t dare intrude and treated the room as a whole as off-limits. A spiral staircase connected them to the library. There was a piano downstairs in the main parlor, a garage for the multiple cars, a patio in the back garden for entertaining guests.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “You should have seen the place in its heyday,” Newt told him over breakfast that first morning. They were eating in the kitchen, with the back door open to let in the morning breeze., and he had been kind enough to say nothing and wait when Credence crossed himself before he began eating. “I was barely your age of course, then, but it was like nothing I’d ever seen. So much color. All the flower beds teeming. There used to be rhododendrons by the main doors to match the red in the stained glass, but those died a few years ago. The Old Girl’s fallen somewhat into disgrace, I’m afraid,” he added regretfully. The Old Girl was how Newt referred to the gardens, which were at once his pride and the bane of his existence. As the groundskeeper, he spent six days a week at the house but lived independently off the property: arriving early enough in the morning for breakfast and staying late enough to eat dinner before returning home. There was always dirt under his nails and grass stains on the knees of his trousers. As much as Newt good-naturedly cursed them, Credence thought the gardens were beautiful just as they were now: sprawling and overgrown, barely contained. The whole house was like that.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you know when Mr. Graves is due back?” Credence asked. He sipped his coffee slowly, trying to make it last; it was far better than the watery stuff back at Miss Barebone’s, but he didn’t want to pour another cup and appear gluttonous. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Not until a few weeks from now, I expect,” said Newt. “He doesn’t stay here very often. A week here and there, and then he’ll be off again before you know it."</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “What’s he like?” asked Credence. He had never seen so much as a picture of him, and had only heard of Percival Graves by vague reputation: the owner of a shipping company, wealthy, certain intimations of lost glory.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “A good employer,” Newt said. “Exacting but not idiosyncratic. He was in the war, of course,” he added. “Got a D.C.M. for it too.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “It’s only that I have no idea what I’m meant to do until he arrives,” said Credence. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “If he left no instructions, then he probably expects you to rest and amuse yourself until he gets here. More coffee?” Newt held out the pot, and Credence panicked and shook his head. Newt poured more into his own cup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I shouldn’t worry. He’s a good man. Had the decency to take me in, and there’s not many who would do that.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence’s initial tour of the house had been given by Mrs. Esposito the housekeeper. Mrs. Esposito was a walking paradox; straight-laced but given to mothering anyone near her, she insisted on addressing everyone by their surnames regardless of how long she had known them, and swore blind that her job was to manage the household, not learn gossip about her employers. Despite this, she was a reliable source for all information on the Graves family stretching back roughly fifty years.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Why are so many of the rooms shut?” Credence had asked.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “A good portion of the furniture was sold off after the late Mr. Graves passed,” she explained.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Why was that?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I’d never be one to speak ill of the dead,” she said, lowering her voice, “but the late Mr. Graves made several financial decisions toward the end of his life which some later termed unwise. There were debts.” She said the word delicately, with the faintest hint of disdain. “But I’m not one to gossip.” </span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p3">With no obligations until Mr. Graves arrived, Credence had grown into the habit of walking after breakfast. At first it had been a task designed so that he would memorize the grounds and surrounding areas, but the layout was a quick study and soon he found himself walking merely for the pleasure of it. Gradually, his routes grew increasingly complicated and ambitious, until he could be away for hours at a time and not realize how long it had been until he saw the sky purpling overhead.</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He had fallen asleep beneath the yew tree in one of the fields about a mile and a half off the property and only woke when a raindrop splattered against his cheek. More drops fell with increasing speed as he sat up and wiped his face. It had been a bright and sunny morning, and so he hadn’t thought to bring an umbrella. There was no pointing in hurrying, he decided; with the speed of the ensuing storm, he’d come back drenched regardless. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> To Miss Barebone’s frustration, Credence’s hair grew very quickly when it was permitted to do so. In the three weeks he had been at the house, he had lost the severity of the haircuts that she had forced on him every two weeks. It now came just past his ears. Rain dripped from his forelock. He raked his fingers through it as the downpour quickened and set off down the road back the way he’d come.</span>
</p><p class="p7"><span class="s1"> He wasn’t aware of the motor car until it was almost upon him. Too late, he spotted the headlights swinging behind him and leapt out of the way just as the car swung past him and came to screeching halt in the fields beside the road several yards away.</span> <span class="s1">Credence crept toward it uncertainly.</span></p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Do you need any help?” he called, just as the passenger door opened, emitting not a person but a very large dog covered in shaggy black fur. The dog bounded past Credence, making for fields on the other side of the road. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Raffles!” A man followed the dog from the car, cursing as he slipped briefly on the mud in the road. Credence shook himself and lunged for the dog, who was now rolling happily in the wet grass. He grabbed her collar.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Damn the dog.” The man had reached them. He made an impatient gesture. “Give him here.”</span>
</p><p class="p7"><span class="s1">Credence hastened to obey. It was difficult work; the dog was excited and kept jumping from person to person. Finally, the man got a decent hold on the collar and tugged the dog toward the car again. “One of these days,” he told him, “you’re going to be the death of me.”</span> <span class="s1">The dog panted and strained to get at Credence, who followed helplessly. “The devil were you thinking?” It took him a moment to realize that the man was addressing not the dog, but him. “Can’t you hear?” He had to yell it over the roar of the rain.</span></p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Hear what?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Hear what, <em>hear the car.”</em> The man was wrestling the dog into the car again and having little luck at it. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I couldn’t hear anything over the rain!” Credence protested. The dog barked and made another bid for freedom. “Please let me help you with that.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> As quickly as it had come, the rain began to ease off.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I’d say you’ve done enough.” He finally succeeded in getting the dog into the car and turned to face Credence, who got his first good look at him. He was older, with thick brows and dark hair that must have been neatly brushed back once, but now hung in dripping disarray in his eyes. Credence was keenly aware of his stomach swooping. The man stared at him for a moment. Then he ran his hair through his wet hair. “Where’d you say you lived?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “At the Graves Estate.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re the secretary, aren’t you.” The man surveyed him with a calculating look, one thick eyebrow furrowed. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1">Credence frowned. “Yes? Yes, I am.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Percival Graves,” he said and held out a gloved hand.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence stared at it in growing horror.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Sir,” he said, “I am so sorry—”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves waved him off. “You’d better get in,” he said. Too late, Credence realized that he had been expected to shake his hand. He’d missed his cue. Graves stared at him expectantly. “Unless you’d prefer to catch your death and walk? You’re wet through already.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence shook himself. “Thank you, sir.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1">He slid into the backseat of the car, keenly aware of the water he was dripping onto everything. The inside smelled strongly of cigarettes, expensive cologne, and wet dog. Beside him in the backseat was Raffles, who immediately attempted to climb into his lap despite her size. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Are we giving him a lift?” asked the man in the driver’s seat as Graves retook his own place.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Jacob, meet my new secretary Mr. Barebone,” he said.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> The man in the driver’s seat twisted around to face him.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Jacob Kowalski,” he said and offered him his hand, which Credence made sure to shake this time, reaching awkwardly over the dog to do so. “I’m the chauffeur.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Credence Barebone.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Pleasure.” He faced forward again. “Let’s see if we can’t get ourselves out of here.” He put the car in reverse and gunned the engine. There was an unsettling rumbling noise, and then the car guttered to life and inched backward onto the road again.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Again,” Credence said, “I’m so sorry about—”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Not to worry,” said Kowalski. “If I’d have seen you, I’d have used the horn. What with the mist and the rain, it’s lucky Mr. Graves spotted you at all.” Credence glanced nervously at the back of Graves’s head, but his employer said nothing. The dog began enthusiastically licking Credence’s face; he craned his face away and gently pushed her aside. Kowalski glanced at him in the rearview mirror. “Just tell her ‘no’ if she gets pushy. Dog doesn’t know she’s half the size of the car.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Raffles,” Graves said ominously without turning around. “Lay down.” Credence could have sworn the dog gave him a much-aggrieved look, but she obediently flopped onto her belly and put her nose between her paws. “We’ll have to give her a bath,” he continued, more to himself than Kowalski or Credence. “Sorry about the upholstery, Jacob.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Not a problem, sir,” said Kowalski.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> They spent the rest of the drive in silence.</span>
</p><p class="p7"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves’s return home was accomplished with little fanfare, and he bypassed much of the welcoming by making directly for the library and motioning Credence to follow him. “Join me for a moment, please.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> <em>He’s going to fire me, </em>thought Credence as he followed. <em>He’s going to fire me, and I won’t even have technically started the job, and I’ll have to go back to Miss Barebone’s, and that’s if she’ll even take me back, and he won’t even give me a reference…</em></span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves led him through the library and up the staircase into the office that Credence had been eyeing in apprehension for the last week. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> The inside looked much like Credence’s own: wood panelling, windows with a good view of the grounds, a thick carpet underfoot, a large desk dominating the space. Graves sat down behind it. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “You’re the one from the school?” he said.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s correct, sir.” It was hard to talk, let alone look him in the eye. Graves eyed him for a moment, then opened one drawer of his desk and took out a leather folder, the contents of which Credence couldn’t make out. Then Graves pushed a piece of paper toward him. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Do you know that is?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence looked closer. “It’s a map of the house, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s right,” said Graves. “I need you to sell it.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “… the map?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “The house.” Credence bit his tongue. Anxiety was making him stupid. “Preferably within the year, if you please. I’m not here enough to do it, so I need an assistant. That’s where you come in. Keep track of offers, necessary repairs, etcetera, etcetera. What do you think its best selling point is?” he asked suddenly.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence blinked. “It’s beautiful,” he said without thinking. Graves raised an eyebrow. “No, really,” he said, warming to his theme. “It’s a little rough around the edges because it hasn’t been properly lived-in or cared for, but it has so much potential—honestly, I can’t imagine why you’d want to sell it.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Because it’s a damned eyesore,” said Graves. He went to the window and twitched back the curtain. “Half the time it’s covered in mist, and when it’s not you see how cut off it is from everything else.” With his back turned, he couldn’t see Credence wilting. “Still,” he continued. “I won’t deny it’s got a certain something. More wild rose than English tea, but something all right.” He turned back. “I’m glad you like it,” he said. “You’ve been shown your office?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence blinked. The question had come immediately, and he hadn’t been prepared for it. “I—yes. Yes. Mr. Scamander showed me.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Very good. And you have everything you need?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Very good.” He bundled up the folder again and handed it to Credence. “These are all the deeds, the floor plans, and so on.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Sir—” Credence broke off as Graves turned the full sharpness of his gaze on him. The words <em>I’ve never done anything like this before</em> lined themselves up on his tongue but wilted in his employer’s gaze. “I wanted to apologize for what happened out on the road,” he said at last.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves studied him for a moment. Then he grunted. “Already forgotten,” he said. “That turn’s a devil, especially in the mist.” He held out his hand. “Shall we be friends, Mr. Barebone?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He took his hand and shook it. His palm was warmer and rougher than Credence had expected.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “A pleasure to work with you, sir,” he managed.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “All mine,” said Graves. “Now, go and change out of those wet things before you catch your death.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence turned to go, but Graves called his name. He looked back.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Sir?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Don’t go mentioning this to the others just yet,” he said. “I’m breaking the news after dinner tonight.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Understood, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He let himself out.</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence took the folder to his office and locked the door behind himself. If someone had thought to tell him that his employer would look like <em>that</em>, he might have thought twice about taking the job.</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He could count on one hand the number of times he looked at Graves over dinner that evening. Mrs. Esposito had been planning the meal for nearly two weeks in preparation for Graves’s return, but for all the effort that had been put into it, Credence could barely eat. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> <em>I’m going to lose my job, </em>he thought. <em>He’s going to realize he made a mistake and that I can’t do the work, and then he’s going to fire me, and I’ll have to go back to Miss Barebone, and I really think she might kill me if she sees me again—</em></span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Across the table, Graves seemed lost in his own thoughts as well. He too only picked at his food. There was no conversation. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Finally, Graves wiped his mouth with his napkin and stood. His chair scraped across the floor. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I have to go and be the bearer of ill tidings,” he said. “If you go to my office, there should be a bottle of aspirin in the desk. If you’d fetch it and meet me in the library, I’d be grateful.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, sir. Sir—?” Graves paused at the door of the dining room and looked back at him. “Would you like me to be there with the others?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “No, that won’t be necessary,” he said. “Just meet me in the library.”</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He had an odd thrill as he opened the door to Graves’s office. His employer had only been home less than a day, but Credence still viewed the room as strictly off-limits. He peered around the edge of the door inside. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Nearly everything in Graves’s office was covered in a thin layer of dust, with the exception of the desk and one shelf of the bookcase behind it. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Searching someone’s desk, even with permission, felt intensely personal. Belatedly, he realized that Graves had not told him <em>where </em>in the desk the aspirin was. He was careful to replace objects properly after he had searched beneath them; everything was painstakingly neat despite the dust, and Credence wanted to minimize the perception that he had tampered with a space that was uniquely his employer’s.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He began to go through the drawers. The two on the right contained mostly spare pens and ledgers. The top drawer on the left contained an address book and a bundle of letters bound with string which Credence didn’t dare inspect closer. He opened the bottom drawer. Unlike the other three, which had been full nearly to the brim, this one contained only one small photograph, soft at the edges, of a soldier. He was too young to be Graves, even back during the war. Credence turned it over. There was no inscription on the back except for a brief, curt notation of the year: 1917.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence turned it back over. He thought the man might bear a passing resemblance to Newt, albeit more polished and unapproachable, and part of him was tempted to ask him about it, but the photograph’s lonely place in the drawer suggested secrets that he was sure he shouldn’t pry into. He replaced the photograph in the drawer and was about to close it when he noticed the gleam of glass at the back. Sure enough, there was the aspirin bottle. It was only a quarter full. </span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> When he returned to the library, he found that Graves was already there. He had sunk into one of the armchairs. A fire had been lit in the grate, the first time Credence had seen it used. Heat radiated from it, making his skin feel as though it glowed. Graves took the aspirin from him without comment, swallowed several pills dry, and opened the book on his lap with a cough and bleary blink, as though he had just woken from a nap. Credence shifted his weight. “Will there be anything else, sir?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves glanced up at him and blinked again, as though he had forgotten that Credence was there. “Sit down,” he said. “Make yourself comfortable.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence took a seat in the opposite armchair. He didn’t think he’d ever felt less comfortable in his life. Graves returned his attention to the book in his lap. Drumming his fingers idly on the armrests and feeling as though he were under interrogation, Credence found himself straining his eyes to see what titles were on the bookshelves, but he couldn’t make any of them out. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “You’ve been comfortable here, then?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence jumped, startled by the question. Graves had looked up from his book at least. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “And you’ve no questions for me?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Several sprang to mind, including <em>how do I sell a house </em>but Credence shook his head. “Not at the moment, sir.””</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Very good.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> They sat in silence for a minute or two. Finally Graves stirred again. “If you’ve something else you’d rather do, don’t let me keep you.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence shifted uneasily. “I was planning to have an early night, sir…”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Go on, then,” said Graves. “I won’t keep you.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence tried not to leave the library too quickly.</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Instead of going to his bedroom, however, he went downstairs, through the baize door into the kitchen. At the center table sat Mrs. Esposito, Mr. Kowalksi, and Newt. By the still-warm oven, Raffles lay curled up on the floor. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Credence, come join us,” said Newt. He pulled out a chair. Mr. Kowalski poured out a coffee and placed a few ladyfingers on a plate for him. At the sound of the plate on the table, Raffles rose from her spot by the oven and trotted over to Credence, looking up at him with imploring eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Newt snapped his fingers at her. “Stay. She’s named after the gentleman thief,” he added apologetically to Credence. “And rightly so.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Did you know?” Mrs. Esposito asked without preamble. “That he was going to sell the house?” To Credence’s relief, she didn’t seem particularly upset. None of them did. If anything, they struck him as resigned.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “He told me a few hours before he told you,” he answered. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> She nodded. “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised,” she said. “There’s a lot of history here, which I suppose I can’t blame him for wanting to distance himself from.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “What happened?” asked Credence. Raffles placed her head on his knee. He scratched her head.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Not for me to say,” she said, and for once she didn’t elaborate. “Still, it wasn’t always this way. He loved this house when he was a boy. And it’s been in the family for generations. That he’d want to give it all up is a shock.” She shook herself. “Eat those up, won’t you?” She gestured at the ladyfingers. “We can’t repeat desserts, and I don’t want them to go to waste.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence tried one. “These are good,” he told her. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Thank Mr. Kowalski, not me,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “My <em>babcia </em>was the best baker in New York,” Kowalksi said. “I was just lucky enough to inherit the recipes.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “How did you find Mr. Graves, Credence?” asked Newt. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Intimidating.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He smiled. “That’ll wear off soon enough. If he’s rude, it’s because he’s stressed.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “To be fair,” Kowalski put in, “he’s usually stressed. But he’s not a bad man. You’ll get used to him within a day or so, and then you’ll be thick as thieves, mark my words.”</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence woke twice that night. The second time the room felt stifling; his nightshirt was stuck damply to his back. He left the bed, opened the window a little bit to let in the night breeze, and returned to bed.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p6">Morning dawned unseasonably cool, and when Credence descended the stairs, he passed the breakfast room to find the door open and occupied for once.</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Credence,” Graves called from inside. “I asked them to set your place in here.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He entered hesitantly to find that the table had indeed been set with the good china and crystal. The sideboard was laid out with a fuller breakfast than Credence had ever seen at either Miss Barebone’s or the kitchen. Conscious of Graves’s presence, he poured himself a cup of coffee and buttered a slice of toast. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I usually take a walk before getting down to business,” said Graves. “If you’d like to join me and the dog, I wouldn’t be averse.” He spoke without once taking his eyes off the newspaper that sat beside his plate.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “If it’s all the same to you, I’d prefer to go straight to work,” said Credence. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves hummed. “As you please.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence sipped his coffee and didn’t touch his toast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Suddenly, Graves looked up from his newspaper. “Mr. Barebone,” he said, “this really can’t continue.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Sir?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I was very short with you yesterday, and I apologize for that. I don’t travel particularly well, and I was hardly expecting to meet you on the side of the road in the pouring rain. Now,” he continued, “if you’d genuinely prefer not to walk, that’s your prerogative, and I’ve no intention of pulling rank. But if you’re purposefully avoiding me under the delusion that I don’t like you and don’t want to get to know you better, I assure you you're mistaken.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> They stared at each other. It seemed almost as though he were as startled by his speech as Credence was. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I genuinely want to work, sir,” Credence said at last. “But I appreciate your thinking of me.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves considered his words for a moment. Then he nodded, more to himself than to Credence, and returned to his newspaper. He looked more polished than yesterday, but paradoxically, he seemed more relaxed: his suit jacket slung over the back of his chair, his collar loosened, no tie. As he read, a stray lock of hair fell into his eyes; he swiped it back immediately.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence took a bite of his toast.</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Half an hour later, Credence was beginning to regret his decision not to come on that walk. Cloistered away in his office, he glared at the floor plan of the house as if staring hard enough would force it to do his job for him. He didn’t want to help sell the house. In truth, he couldn’t even imagine why Graves wanted to sell it in the first place, for all the history it might contain. It was clear enough that he had money troubles—but to sell his ancestral home to right them? That spoke of something more. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Perhaps its style was no longer in fashion, and as a modern man, Graves wanted something to better reflect the times. Credence had spent the majority of his life in a glorified tenement; he didn’t know the first thing about houses. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Or how to begin selling them. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> His chair scraped across the floor as he rose from his desk and strode to the window. The early morning mist had evaporated, providing an excellent view of the back grounds, across which Graves was currently strolling, tossing a stick for Raffles, who bounded across the grass to retrieve it for him. He knelt down in the grass—surely it must still have been wet—and scratched her enthusiastically behind the ears. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He should tell him sooner rather than later that he was no good for this job, Credence decided. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves chose that moment to glance up directly at Credence, who took an instinctive step back. Caught. But Graves just lifted a hand in greeting, which, after a moment, Credence cautiously returned. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Not right now, he decided. Later. </span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Several hours and an ensuing headache later, he slipped into the kitchen, where Jacob and Mrs. Esposito were busy with dinner. As she dropped several dirty knives into the sink, Mrs. Esposito spotted him in the doorway.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “You look run-down,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I feel run-down,” Credence said. He sat at the kitchen table and put his head in his hands. “I don’t think I can do this.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Jacob wiped his hands on his apron and poured out a mug of cocoa, which had been heating on the stove. He set it in front of Credence and sat down across from him. “What’s the trouble?” he asked. “You should drink that,” he added when Credence sat back in his chair without taking the mug with him.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence sipped it. It was richer than he expected, not quite as sweet as he’d feared. “I’ve never sold a house before,” he said. “Let alone one on this scale. I don’t know where to start.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I grew up in a tenement,” Jacob said, “so my experience is limited. Hattie—” he turned to Mrs. Esposito— “you have any thoughts?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> She hummed and began doing the dishes. Credence jumped up automatically to reach for a dish towel, but she pointed sternly at him until he return to the table and his cocoa. “The house has been in the Graves family for years,” she said once he resumed his seat. “The present Mr. Graves is the first to even consider selling the place, so I couldn’t tell you anything specific. But Mr. Scamander and his brother sold off their family home back around wartime,” she mused. “I imagine he could tell you something about it.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Newt has a brother?” asked Credence.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Had,” Mrs. Esposito corrected. “He died out in France in ’17. What was his name? Mr. Kowalski, you remember, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Jacob shrugged. “Before my time.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> She made a moue of frustration. “Mr. Graves met him in France, and after he passed, he took on Mr. Scamander as a special favor to him. Theseus!” she added, triumphant. “That was his name. Theseus Scamander. You ask Mr. Scamander, he could probably tell you something about selling.”</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He went in search of Newt on the pretext of bringing him water and found him trimming the hedges near the front of the house. Newt wiped sweat from his forehead and drank the water in one go, and Credence asked about what Mrs. Esposito had said.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “That was about ten years ago,” Newt replied. “My memory can’t be faultless. But I seem to remember having to spend a great deal of money fixing the roof. And that was before we even considered getting an appraisal. It leaked,” he said in clarification. “You had to put a bowl underneath it when it rained.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “So I should see what needs repairs first?” asked Credence.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, I’d say so,” he said. “I’ll tell you one thing: the basement’s <em>always</em> damp. There’s problems every year with rot. You’re lucky it’s not the summertime,” he added. “It makes a dreadful musty smell in summer.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Excellent,” Credence said. “Anything else you can think of?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Nothing immediately comes to mind.” He put his finger against one of the leaves of the hedge. Credence peered closer in time to see a ladybug meander onto his nail. “The rooms would need to be aired out of course,” Newt continued, his eyes on the insect. “So much of them aren’t used anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then there’s furniture… Really you ought to get someone professional to come and look it all over.” He frowned and set the ladybug back on the branch. “Theseus and I didn’t, and I have a terrible suspicion we left our buyer with a mouse problem.” He smiled ruefully. “Probably overcharged them, but who’s counting a decade down the line?” He handed Credence the water glass. “You said it was Mrs. Esposito who told you?” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence blinked. “That’s right.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Did she tell you the rest?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He shifted his weight. “She said he—your brother—that he died in the war?” Newt nodded and picked up his clippers. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He smiled. “He was a pompous prig.” At Credence’s startled expression, his smile grew wider. “Really. Always better than me at everything and couldn’t make a secret of it. Except gardening,” he allowed after a moment. “He was rubbish at gardening. But he was a good brother. And a good friend, too. He and Mr. Graves were very thick during the war.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He began clipping the hedge again.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “The other evening I noticed that he has a photograph of a soldier in his office,” Credence began. “Was that your brother?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Newt didn’t turn around. “Yes,” he said. “I imagine so.”</span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Later in the day, after Credence had summoned up the courage, he knocked on Graves’s office door and resisted the urge to bob from foot to foot with anxiety. At the distant <em>come in</em> he cautiously opened the door. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves was seated not at the desk but at the open window, balanced on the sill with a sheaf of paperwork in one hand and a smoking cigarette in the other. He was in his shirtsleeves, and his collar was loosened. Incredibly, a pair of reading glasses were perched on the bridge of his nose.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Mr. Barebone,” he said. “What’s the news.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence realized he was staring without saying a word and shook himself into action. “I wanted your permission to hire an inspector, sir. For the house. It’s best if we make all the necessary repairs before we get an appraisal,” he continued, feeling something more was needed.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves took a drag on his cigarette and nodded. “Yes,” he said, breathing out a cloud of smoke. “Do that. Am I to assume you’ve found someone already?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, sir. At a reasonable rate, too.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Well done. And good thinking.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Momentarily, Credence considered admitting that some of the credit belonged to Newt and Mrs. Esposito, but just then he found he wanted to bask a little in the warmth of Graves’s praise. He ducked his head to hide a smile.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Thank you, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Do keep it up.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I will.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He had the curious sense of walking on air for the rest of the day. </span>
</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He joined Graves again for dinner that evening and afterward in the library. “Not making an early night of it tonight?” he said when Credence sat down in the chair opposite his own.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Not tonight, sir.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves lit a cigarette, then offered the open case to Credence, who hesitated for a moment, and then chose one. He leaned forward so Graves could light it—one large hand cupped around the flame and nearly brushing the bridge of Credence’s nose. Credence took a cautious drag on it. Immediately his lungs rebelled, and he suppressed a cough until Graves stood and went to the gramophone player to put on a Vivaldi record.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “So Mr. Barebone,” he said as the music popped and hissed to life. “Tell me about yourself.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> His voice was still hoarse from the cigarette. “There’s not a great deal to tell, sir.” He cast about for some detail. “I’ve lived here in New York all my life. Never been on Long Island until now, though.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Parents?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence shrugged. “They died when I was young. I lived in an orphanage until I was seven and then Miss Barebone adopted me and put me in her school.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Ah, yes,” said Graves darkly. <em>“</em>I had thought I saw that name on your resumé.” He took his seat again. “You can’t be more than nineteen, then, if you went through her school.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Twenty, sir. She took me on as a teacher after I was a student.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “And yet I recall in your letter that this is your first paid position,” said Graves.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I worked for room and board,” said Credence. “But yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves frowned. “If you don’t mind my asking,” he said, “how much do you have at your disposal? In all the world?”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence opened his mouth to reply but then hesitated. “Actually, sir,” he said, “I do mind.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> If Graves was surprised, he didn’t show it. “How ever did you escape from there?” he asked. “From what I hear, students who have the misfortune to be sucked into that school don’t often come back out.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I advertised in secret,” said Credence, trying to keep the pride out of his voice. “And when you responded, I told her—Miss Barebone—that I had found a position elsewhere, and that she could not stop me from taking it.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I can’t imagine she took it well.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> He had broached the subject at breakfast one morning. In response, she had beat him bloody in front of the students and shrieked a great deal about Judas Iscariot. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “She didn’t,” Credence said.</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “And you weren’t sorry to leave, I imagine.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence cocked his head to the side. “I was sorry to leave the students. I had been in their position, and I did what I could to help them. But I had to go.” He hesitated. “It was like I had a weight tied to my ribs, and wherever I went, I had to drag it all along with me. But the moment I left, I could walk unburdened. If you know what I mean.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves exhaled a cloud of smoke and then ashed his cigarette. “Yes,” he said. “I know exactly.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> There was a heavy but not unpleasant silence. Credence studied the smoke curling off his cigarette but didn’t attempt to try it again. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “May I ask <em>you</em> something, sir?” he said at last. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Of course,” Graves said. “Quid pro quo. It means—”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “—something given for something received,” Credence replied. “Yes.” Despite himself, his lips twitched, and he was gratified when Graves returned the look. His eyes looked warmer when he smiled, however briefly. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Credence looked away. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I wondered why you really meant to sell the house,” he said. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I told you. Because it’s an eyesore.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Mrs. Esposito said you didn’t always feel that way.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves arched an eyebrow. “Did she now. Well, Doctor Freud—” he looked pointedly at Credence— “I’ll admit it. Childhood casts a powerful glamour.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “I wouldn’t know, sir,” said Credence. He hesitated. “If you’d prefer I dropped the matter—”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “Don’t think of it. I’m glad that you’re curious. But just because you ask, doesn’t mean I’ll answer, Mr. Barebone.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> “With respect, sir, that’s hardly a quid pro quo.” </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Graves made a sound that may have been a laugh. Then he rose and took several books from the bookshelf nearest him, seemingly at random. “I’m going to read for a little while, and then turn in,” he said. “Feel free to stay.”</span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> The green glass lamp at his elbow clicked to life, and with no further words, he opened the first<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>book he had taken and began reading. No spectacles, Credence noticed: he wondered if he were embarrassed of them and didn’t like to wear them in company. The thought was strangely humanizing. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Realizing he was staring, he rose and went to the nearest shelf. He knew none of the titles, what few there were—like the rest of the house, the library gave the impression of having fallen from former glory—and so selected a novel at random. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Back in his seat, he glanced over the top of the pages at Graves. He was lost in his reading. </span>
</p><p class="p7">
  <span class="s1"> Warmth curled in Credence’s stomach. He forced his eyes back to the page. </span>
</p>
