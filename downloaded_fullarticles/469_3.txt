    <p>BRANCH WALKERS</p><p>In the cloudy sky above a lush forest, a young man was flying above the trees. He'd been traveling to his destination without break for nearly ten hours. Most of the journey had been over a vast sea. Now that he'd reached the forest, it was time for a much needed break.</p><p>He lowered his broom down, embracing the dropping sensation throughout his stomach. As he landed he took the goggles off his head and with a swift motion he fixed his wind swept white-blond hair.</p><p>"Almost there now. This will be a new start, it'll be a new beginning." As many times he repeated these lines in his mind, it had not settled the dread of what was coming upon him.</p><p>It was nice stretching out his legs after a long ride. He walked around the forest floor and listened to the birds sing a lovely song to each other. He noticed each of the trees had enormous groups of cobwebs covering some of the limbs.</p><p>While pondering over the mass of webs, his stomach gave out a large growl. He had never had been great at making himself a decent meal. Especially with magic. It was a good idea he asked his old house elf, Milo, to make him a few to-go meals for his journey.</p><p>He pulled the meal out of his travel backpack, opened it up, dodged the steam, and began to eat the enchanted meal.</p><p>Wishing the break could have been a longer one, he was expected somewhere, he had to keep on his way or be late. Taking one last look around the peaceful forest he mounted on his broom and flew up into the sky.</p><p>He flew over many muggle towns, over lakes and small ponds. Noticing the giant mountain ranges, he knew he was almost there. Almost to his new home. Anxiety washed over him like a blanket.</p><p>Remembering to fly towards the mountain with the highest sharpest point, he then flew downwards, seeing signs saying</p><p>"GO BACK" and</p><p>"CAUTION, BIOHAZARD"</p><p>This how he knew he had found the right place. Flying past the signs downwards towards the tree tops he felt the sensation of going through protection charms.</p><p>He flew on for a bit more, looking at his surroundings. While searching for where he needed to be he noticed a group of wizards we're flying toward him.</p><p>Suddenly he was surrounded by the group of wizards.</p><p>Blocked on all sides.</p>
