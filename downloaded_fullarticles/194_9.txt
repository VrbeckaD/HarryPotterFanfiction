    <p align="justify">It was a morning like any other after the restoration of Hogwarts. The students were sitting at their respective house tables talking about the weather, school related topics or the latest gossip. Draco tried to ignore the busy chatter to the best of his abilities. His friends were just as much part of the typical mornings at Hogwarts so they were not helping at all as they tried to involve him in their meaningless conversations. </p><p align="justify">“If they don’t bring back Quidditch soon, Hogwarts will fall apart quicker than the rebuild,” said Gregory Goyle getting a grunt of protest from Pansy Parkinson in response. <br/> <br/>“They’re definitely bringing it back. They’ve been working on that Quidditch field since the start of the schoolyear,” commented Theodore Nott. <br/> <br/>“So that means it will be back by next year? And of course, this happens during our last year.” Draco almost made a snide remark over Goyle’s non-existent sincerity. <br/> <br/>Goyle was one of many Slytherins that had been – for a lack of a better word – forced by the Ministry to go back to Hogwarts for their finals. Most of them weren’t exactly looking forward to returning. And most of the other students shared that sentiment and decided to show their dissatisfaction through malicious comments or simple disregard. Draco was quite glad that him and his friends were more feared than hated which kept them out of a lot of trouble but they were still cautious to not wander around alone in case they were to run into a group of students that had lost loved ones in the war. <br/> <br/>“Draco would definitely have been the Seeker again!” Draco tilted his head hearing his name being dropped. <br/> <br/>“You would have, right? You’ve always been a great player!” Pansy said now looking at Draco. <br/> <br/>“Well, it is completely irrelevant now that we don’t have a team this year anyway!” hissed Theo before Draco could reply. Pansy looked miffed but didn’t comment any further. <br/> <br/>Draco tuned them out again and looked over to the Gryffindor table. Potter and Weasley were laughing annoyingly loud for a Monday morning because of something Granger had said. Draco rolled his eyes. He really could have done well without this reunion of old classmates. <br/> <br/>Draco left the table a bit earlier than his friends and made his way to the library to return a book just before their first class would begin. As long as everyone was still at breakfast in the Great Hall, he was safe to walk around alone in the castle. He stayed in the library waiting patiently for most of the students to be in their classrooms before he rushed to his potions class. Tardiness was definitely not helping his reputation but as it was his strongest subject, he thought he could indulge in a little tardiness every now and then. <br/> <br/>Slughorn just commented on his arrival with a “Find yourself a partner and commence with the assignment.” Draco hurriedly looked around for an empty spot and was instantly filled with the desire to turn around and flee. Apparently, there was still one left. Next to Harry bloody Potter. Draco let his eyes search the room desperately hoping for another empty seat. But of course, there wasn’t one. This should not have come as a surprise to him with his luck lately. Letting out a frustrated sigh, he walked straight over to Potter’s table and stopped more confidently than he felt in front of it. <br/> <br/>Harry looked up and went still. “You are the only one without a partner so do not give me that look,” hissed Draco letting his bag fall next to him and eyed Harry warily. Harry shot a pleading look to his right where his best friends were discussing some ingredients. They didn’t notice the distress exuding of their friend from their left. <br/> <br/>Harry looked back to Draco. “Okay,” he said a bit too quietly. <br/> <br/>“Perfect. So, what are we making?” tried Draco to keep the conversation light. <br/> <br/>“Lucidum,” replied Harry and moved his open potions book over to Draco so he could see it better. <br/> <br/><em>When ingested, Lucidum heightens one’s clarity of consciousness and through training it can make neuropsychological functions such as perception, attention, sense of time and memory controllable. </em><br/> <br/>Draco looked back up at Harry. “Did you start already?” <br/> <br/>“Still getting all the ingredients,” replied Harry curtly. Draco nodded and made himself helpful by getting the rest of the ingredients ready. It was actually a quite easy potion to brew. The only difficulty was in adding and mixing in the ingredients with perfect timing. <br/> <br/>Harry wasn’t even half bad as Draco’s partner. He was smart enough to not get in Draco’s way and got all the necessary ingredients ready. The water was already boiling in the cauldron when they were done with the preparations. <br/> <br/>“Alright,” Draco rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. “You will give me the ingredients exactly when I tell you to, understood?” <br/> <br/>Harry frowned. “Why don’t you do that?” <br/> <br/>Instead of making a biting remark over Potter’s lacking potions expertise, Draco bit his tongue and ignored Harry’s question. <br/> <br/>“We are starting with the belladonna essence, get ready, Potter.” <br/> <br/>Harry rolled his eyes annoyed and exchanged a meaningful look with Ron, working at the table next to them, who shook his head in sympathy. Draco noticing the exchange cleared his throat impatiently drawing Harry’s attention back to the task at hand and was surprised to see that Harry even got the ingredient ready then. <br/> <br/>Both wizards got ready to brew the potion back to being focused again. Draco counted every second and every stir just so he could get the timing perfectly right. He wasn’t going to put his Outstanding at risk by messing up such a simple potion. <br/> <br/>“The Jobberknoll feathers and dirigible plums at the same time in three… two… one!” Harry quickly grabbed the ingredients and threw them into the kettle as he was told. <br/> <br/>“The Flobberworm slime now!” Draco yelled before realizing it was at the other end of the table. Harry dove rather gracelessly across table almost knocking over the cauldron onto Draco. <br/> <br/>“Damn it, Potter!” Draco grunted while he steadied the wobbly cauldron. Harry poured in the Flobberworm slime with a quiet “Sorry” and straightened up again. Draco gave Harry a quick dumbfounded look but let go of the kettle then. <br/> <br/>“Done.” <br/> <br/>Harry eyed the greenish blubbering liquid in front of him. “Did it work?” <br/> <br/>As if summoned, Slughorn appeared at their table. “Well that doesn’t look half ba-,” Slughorn who just dipped the ladle into the brew stopped suddenly as he noticed the brew changing colour. <br/> <br/>“What in the-,” started Draco taken aback but Slughorn interrupted him. <br/> <br/>“Did you perhaps forget the gingerroot?” <br/> <br/>Draco shook his head as if paralyzed looking over the list of ingredients. “That is not on the list, professor!” <br/> <br/>“That is correct, Mr. Malfoy. That is why at the beginning of class I pointed out to add it at step three in the book. Unfortunate, really unfortunate.” And with that Slughorn left to check on the potions of the rest of the students. <br/> <br/>Draco’s fingertips started tingling and heat rushed to his face. He turned to Harry dangerously slow. <br/> <br/>“Were you planning on mentioning that to me at any point, Potter?” Draco growled while he desperately tried to control his anger. Harry scratched sheepishly the back of his head and shrugged. <br/> <br/>“Sorry… sort of forgot.” <br/> <br/>“FORGOT?” yelled Draco. He didn’t even bother to keep his voice down. “It is already bad enough having to work with you but then YOU GO AND FORGET TO TELL ME ABOUT A WHOLE INGREDIENT. DO NOT FUCK WITH ME, POTTER. YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE DO-” <br/> <br/>“It’s not my fault that you were late!” Harry interrupted him also growing angry. <br/> <br/>More and more students started noticing the heated argument and as Slughorn noticed it too, he started making his way back over to them. <br/> <br/>“Do not dare to put this on me now! Just because you do not give a fuck about your academic performance, does not mean everyone else is like that!” hissed Draco pulling out his wand. Harry followed suit. <br/> <br/>“Don’t be ridiculous, Malfoy!” said suddenly another voice. Draco looked over to the table next to them. Instantly, his eyes narrowed. <br/> <br/>“Shut up, Weasel.” <br/> <br/>“Boys, boys, boys. Please settle down,” Slughorn finally said but ended up being ignored by everyone involved. <br/> <br/>“Ron is right. This is nothing more than ridiculous!” Harry spoke up again. <br/> <br/>Draco grabbed the still hot kettle next to him without thinking twice and threw the brew inside it in Harry’s direction. But due to it being hot he quickly let go of it burning his hands and let out a quiet hiss of pain. <br/> <br/>He heard a gasp, a crash and suddenly a burning hot liquid hit his face making him stumble. Distantly he could hear Slughorn’s voice taking off points of both of their houses and reprimanding them for their behaviour. <br/> <br/>A few seconds later the burning pain on his face subsided. Draco thought he tasted something salty. Draco looked around not able to process what had happened. The cauldron which he had thrown over was lying somewhere between all the staring students, Harry just got up and cleaned his glasses of a purple-coloured liquid and Slughorn waved his wand over another cauldron. The liquid, which turned out to be the potion Draco and Harry had just brewed, flew over and landed blubbering into the cauldron. <br/> <br/>Slughorn eyed Harry first, then Draco. “Did you ingest any of that potion?” he asked sternly. Draco looked at Harry who looked back angrily. <br/> <br/>“I don’t know, sir, I was too busy getting burned,” growled Harry still staring down Draco. Draco broke the staring contest to look at Slughorn. <br/> <br/>“I do not believe so, professor, otherwise it would have illuminated Potter’s mind and he would have realized that this was his own fault!” <br/> <br/>“That’s enough! Detention for both of you! And now get out of my class!” Slughorn ended the show.</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="justify">“You know how he can get. You shouldn’t have let him rile you up!” Hermione said decidedly leaving no room for discussion. <br/> <br/>Harry sighed annoyed. “He accused me of purposely sabotaging his work. I just defended myself!” <br/> <br/>Hermione just shook her head and murmured something that sounded awfully close to “childish”. <br/> <br/>“Forget about it, mate. Malfoy is just a bad omen, nothin' you can do about it,” Ron tried assuring Harry. <br/> <br/>The trio were now lounging in their common room. It was already evening but the events from the potions class were still at the forefront of their minds. Seamus Finnigan had joined them as well. He was absent that morning due to a headache and was very interested in what had happened. <br/> <br/>“And he really threw a potion at you? Isn’t that sort of dangerous?” <br/> <br/>Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. But if it is dangerous then he is as fucked as I am!” <br/> <br/>Hermione sighed. “Maybe we should let the topic be. You will survive detention just fine and, in the future, you just won’t work with Malfoy again.” <br/> <br/>Seamus grinned knowingly. “Why don’t you want to talk about it? Were you hoping to go on a late-night stroll with Ron instead?” Ron gaped and stared baffled at Seamus. <br/> <br/>“I have no idea what you are trying to imply but I am going to bed now,” said Hermione pointedly getting up and went upstairs without uttering another word. Ron glared at Seamus before hurrying after his girlfriend. Harry watched them amusement dancing in his eyes but then decided too to get a good night of rest.</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Bare walls and a long corridor stretched out in front of Harry. He looked around in confusion. How in the hell did he get here? It was cold, the walls were dark and everything was just… frightening. He looked down at himself. Besides black clothes and surprisingly pale skin there was not much to see. The need to lift his hand to inspect his sickly skin grew, however something kept him from doing so. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Instead, he suddenly started moving. He simply walked down the corridor. A combination of anxiety and nervousness started spreading inside of him. He didn’t understand. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Why couldn’t he stop walking? His legs were moving like they had a mind of their own and his steps echoed too loudly off of the cold walls. He noticed a door not too far from him. His steps slowed and he felt another wave of anxiety wash over him. These were not his emotions. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Why would he be afraid? Or what of? </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>He came to a halt in front of the dark door. His pale hand gripped the door handle and pushed it down in what felt like slow-motion. Harry’s curiosity joined the already present anxiety. Very slowly, way too slowly the door opened. Harry wanted to enter the room or at least get a peek inside but he did not move. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>“Draco!” he heard dull voice addressing him. At last he could look into the room. There was a long table at which a dozen black cloaked figures were sat at. </em>
  <br/>
  <em>At the end of the table though sat no other than Lord Voldemort. He opened his arms invitingly and seemed as if he was being welcomed. Harry felt himself shudder. Again, he was certain that those were not his own feelings. He must be dreaming. But why was he dreaming of Voldemort now again? The nightmares had just let up. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>He was forced to notice how his dream-self moved and made its’ way to an empty chair between two figures. As he got closer, he recognized Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. He thought he felt panic welling up in him. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>“Sit, Draco. Your services are needed here,” Voldemort’s voice spoke in Harry’s mind. Without hesitation Harry sat down. Although not completely out of free will. He fought with himself however his body didn’t obey him. In a goblet in front of him he saw his distorted reflection. Blonde hair, grey eyes, pale skin. Damn it. He was trapped in Draco’s body. But why? Dreams about Voldemort were not uncommon for Harry but being in Draco Malfoy’s body meanwhile had never happened before. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Abruptly the image of the Death Eaters and Voldemort got blurry in front of his eyes. Icy wind lashed at his face and he found himself riding a broom up over the familiar Quidditch field. In front of him was the Hufflepuff seeker Cedric Diggory who was looking around focused. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Harry almost laughed. The Gryffindor team was winning. Catching the golden snitch would just be the cherry on top. Nevertheless, Harry instantly noticed a golden shimmer next to one of the Hufflepuff goalposts. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Harry flew dead set on his broom straight to it. A bout of enthusiasm went up in him. He felt how Cedric followed him but got stopped by a bludger thanks to Fred Weasley. Harry grinned smugly without turning around and chased after the golden shimmer that was trying to escape him. He felt a surprising impatience in his stomach which almost distracted him. Harry quickly shook his head to rid himself of that strange feeling and before he knew it, he reached the golden snitch and grabbed it firmly. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Intoxicating cheering sounded from the towers and a whistle announced the end of the game. Harry flew over the heads of the spectators taking in the victory. He waved at Hermione between the other Gryffindors and then made his way down. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Just for a moment he threw a glance at the Slytherin tower noticing blonde hair and a green scarf. A feeling of shock like lightening shot through his whole body and it nearly knocked him off his broom. Harry furrowed his brows grabbing onto his broom and stilled in the air to take in Draco Malfoy a bit more closely. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>The feeling of unease, distrust and confusion mixed with his joy and alleviation of winning the game. He blinked in confusion. Something wasn’t right here. </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>He looked around again. Cedric flew closer to him and congratulated him on the win. A bit further away the Gryffindor team was celebrating with their fans. Fred and George were performing a choreography on their brooms for which they earned even more cheering. Fred? But Fred had died. Cedric too… so why were they here on the Quidditch field as alive as ever? </em>
  <br/>
  <em> </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Suddenly everything fell into place for Harry. He was dreaming. He was dreaming of Quidditch. </em>
  <br/>
  <em>The image around him grew blurry and darkness enveloped him.</em>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify">Harry shot up in his bed. He looked around nervously and tried to sort through his thoughts. He was in the Gryffindor dorms. In the bed next to him was Ron snoring softly. The sun just went up bathing the room in warm, red tones. Harry confusedly rubbed his forehead. He had dreamed of playing Quidditch. That wasn’t really unusual. The dream before that was strange. He was stuck in Draco’s body and had dreamed of Voldemort. However, it was quickly clear to him that he was dreaming. He couldn’t control it but he was just as lucid as he was now. Very different from the Quidditch one. That that one was a dream was only clear to him at the end of it. <br/> <br/>“Fuck,” murmured Harry into the room. He got up and went to shower. The others would get up soon too and he needed to compose himself first. </p><p align="center">* </p><p align="justify">“That is mad!” Ron replied after Harry had recounted the story of his dream at the breakfast table. Hermione furrowed her brows in concern and seemed to be thinking intensively about the meaning of all of this. <br/> <br/>“Well, it was a dream. Surely it isn’t that strange, right?” Harry asked uncertainly. <br/> <br/>“That is absolutely strange! I've never dreamed through someone else’s eyes. Let alone from that ferret’s!” Ron remarked looking at his best friend doubtfully. <br/> <br/>“Maybe it is somehow related to the potions… event yesterday,” mused Hermione out loud. <br/> <br/>Ron laughed. “I thought that potion gave one clarity of one’s consciousness, not making them dream out of the eyes of other people!” Harry looked confusedly from Hermione to Ron and then back to Hermione. <br/> <br/>“Would that be possible?” he asked tentatively. <br/> <br/>Ron looked at him like he lost his mind. “Mate, you can’t seriously think that! That has nothing to do with each other. You had a very strange dream. That’s it!” Harry shrugged looking over at Hermione again who was thoughtfully playing with her hair. <br/> <br/>“I’m not sure how but maybe you did ingest some of that brew.” <br/> <br/>Ron shook decidedly his head. “The potion wasn’t even brewed correctly so even if it had an effect, it would definitely not be safe and Harry would be lying in the hospital wing by now.” Harry grimaced at that thought. <br/> <br/>“You should still observe this. If this keeps happening something definitely is not right,” said Hermione decidedly and glared at Ron to shut him up as he opened his mouth to disagree. <br/> <br/>Harry paid no mind to them as he noticed the arrival of a certain Slytherin followed by his friends. Draco was speaking with Blaise Zabini. He seemed a bit out of it. Blaise kept shaking his head talking seriously. <br/> <br/>“Don’t tell me you’re witnessing the entrance of the Slyther-bitches.” Harry looked up recognizing the familiar voice. Ginny Weasley sat down next to him grinning. <br/> <br/>“Just don’t let Mum hear you talkin' like that,” commented Ron at his sister’s appearance. Ginny just rolled her eyes and turned back to Harry. <br/> <br/>“So, what is so interesting about the Malfoy Squad?” <br/> <br/>Harry shook his head. “Nothing. How’s Charms going?” Harry changed the topic quickly. <br/> <br/>Ginny started a boring conversation about her recent assignment on the topic of doing magic without a wand and only left just before breakfast was over. <br/> <br/>Hermione and Ron were arguing if the Quidditch results or the news were more important and they didn’t look like they were going to agree anytime soon. Harry used that opportunity to scan the Slytherin table for Draco Malfoy. <br/> <br/>Soon enough he was victorious and observed how Draco was sipping bored at a cup of pumpkin juice while Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were almost jumping at each other’s throats over Draco’s head, they were obviously fighting. Blaise seemed to find the whole situation uncomfortable but Pansy seemed like she couldn’t care less and kept bombarding him with arguments. <br/> <br/>Harry tried to recall last night’s dream. He remembered the anxiety and uncertainty. Draco didn’t seem like the anxious kind. And also, not really like the uncertain one. Harry observed how Blaise noticed him looking and whispered something to Draco before continuing his fight with Pansy. Draco looked up meeting Harry’s eyes. He furrowed his brows but then his look darkened and he attended back to his pumpkin juice. Harry turned away too and just now noticed that both his best friends were also staring at Draco. No wonder the change in demeanour. <br/> <br/>“This whole thing seems more than suspicious, Harry,” said Hermione honestly and eyed him with concern in her eyes again. Harry shrugged it off and let his thoughts go on about how awfully boring this school day would be. <br/> </p>
