She sees that each of the boys will be a different creature and will be very powerful.</p><p>Once the vision ends the Princess places Isis onto the ground and she quickly gets a slave to get some papyrus, multiple coloured minerals, something to crush the minerals with, several small pots and some brushes so that she may write down what she had seen in her vision.</p><p>Several hours later The Princess had finished writing and drawing everything that she had seen, once the papyrus had dried Nefertiri uses it to create a scroll, once it's created she uses a preservation spell on it to make sure that it is never destroyed but will age without being destroyed, she then walks to the chamber where the Bracelet of Anubus is hidden, the guards pay her no mind as she places the scroll beside the Chest before she orders the guards to never read what's written and to never allow anyone to ever read it either.</p><p>Later that night Nefertiri realises that the three boys looked exactly like her younger brother and two of his lovers.</p><hr/><p>One and a half thousand years later, in the city of Atlantis is a young male witch with several powers, one of his powers being, the power to see the future. The young man is walking through the city when he gets a vision, this vision shocks the young man so much that his other powers activate accidentally and he causes the city of Atlantis to be destroyed.</p><p>What the young man had seen will never be known to anyone in Atlantis as the entire city sinks to the bottom of the ocean, killing everyone in the entire city. This disaster is what spurred the Elders decided to found Magic School. Through the education of magic, the Elders hope to prevent destruction like this from ever happening again.</p><hr/><p>In the year 1069 A.D. the Angel, Raziel appears to Jonathan Shadowhunter and gives him the Mortal Instruments to begin the race of Nephilim. After Jonathan has done what Raziel had wanted he gets a vision from the angel, the vision shows three boys who will be of Nephilim descent but will have the powers of Wiccan Witches along with Creature Inheritances.</p><p>The vision confuses Jonathan as the only magic users he really know of are Warlocks, like the one who had helped him summon the Angel earlier. He also doesn't understand the Creature Inheritances.</p><hr/><p>What none of the three receivers of the vision don't know is that the three teenage boys they all saw will become The Shadowhunter Charmed Ones with Creature Inheritances.</p>
