    <p>“Mind if I just Slytherin?” You raised a playful eyebrow at your best friend who let out a little laugh as she scooted over in potions class. You and her had started this game the beginning of the year where you would find the worst pickup lines and use them on each other.</p>
<p>Stupid?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Entertaining?</p>
<p>Hell yes.</p>
<p>Next, to her, you heard a short laugh. Sirius Black and James Potter were laying out their ingredients for their potion and apparently, James had found your joke hilarious while Sirius was shaking his head rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>“What Black? Have a problem with our love?” your friend asked as she prepared her potion shooting a wink toward you.</p>
<p>“Yeah because it’s like diarrhea, it just can’t be held in.” Your comment caused Sirius to smirk leaning forward.</p>
<p>“I just have one question Y/N. Did you survive Avada Kedavra? ‘Cause you’re drop dead gorgeous?”</p>
<p>Oh, he was not about to try and play your game? Good luck kid. You're going to need it. </p>
<p>“You know a couple of nights with me and you’ll be moaning like Myrtle.”</p>
<p>“I have to warn you, girls call me ‘aguamenti’. Every time they hear my name, they get wet.”</p>
<p>“Black, Y/L/N please pay attention to your potions” Professor Slughorn reprimanded from the front of the class. You ducked your head giggling as you glanced over at Sirius who just smiled back.</p>
<p>“If you were a Dementor, I’d become a criminal just to get your kiss,” he whispered to you as he picked up a small bowl of finely chopped Willow root. James was about to warn him that they were supposed to sprinkle it in as the potion brewed but Sirius had already dumped the contents in.</p>
<p>The potion made a strange gurgling sound and the black haired boy turned to look just as a large cloud of purple smoke exploded in his face.  </p>
<p>Coughing he took a step back waving his hand, “What the… I don’t feel so…” Then he promptly crumbled to the ground. He would have hit his head on the desk behind him if you hadn’t acted fast catching him slowing his fall.</p>
<p>You both sat on the floor. His head in your lap as Slughorn rushed to get Madam Pomfrey.</p>
<p>“Man he’s going to be pissed when he wakes up.” James said looking down at his friend, “He spent all week coming up with those lines to impress you.”</p>
<p>“What?” you asked looking up at James. The boy was about to reply when Sirius gave a small grown, slowly opening his eyes.</p>
<p>“You literally fainted into her arms mate!” James said laughing as he looked over your shoulder at his best friend.</p>
<p>You smiled down at Sirius brushing a few strands of his black hair out of his face, “If you wanted my attention you didn’t have to go to such extremes” Sirius just stared at you for a moment then burst out laughing as the teachers rushed into the classroom. </p>
