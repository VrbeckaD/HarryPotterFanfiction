    <p>It’s not the sort of place he usually patronises. That bodes well, at least.</p><p>The club is dark, heavily Disillusioned, and the music blares painfully in Harry’s ears when he steps through the concealment charm. It pulses in time with the flashing lights, which set off the press of bodies on the dance floor and, more interestingly, what’s going on in the small alcoves that should perhaps remain hidden.</p><p>Harry wanders through the crowd, taking note of those who notice him, the wings that flicker as he passes, the growls that sound near his ear, the smiles that bare sharp teeth. He’s not in any danger — not from them, at least — but his heart thumps pleasantly at the illusion. </p><p>He orders a drink at the bar and looks around as he waits. The creatures seem to clump together, like to like, individually chatting up the odd human who ventures into their groups. Concentrating, Harry can sense the different brands of their magic: Veela, werewolves, vampires. </p><p>The younger kids, barely out of Hogwarts by the looks of them, seem fascinated by the Veelas. Harry understands the allure. Those pretty faces and the glimmering rustle of feathers are the most attractive, the least threatening — on the surface of things. The hardcore types, scarred and tattooed, seem to be drawn to the werewolves, even with their human visages in place. Perhaps they’re regulars and they know who to look for… Or maybe, like him, they can sense it, that hungry quality that promises a rough, uninhibited fucking. </p><p>Harry wonders if they can knot without a full moon. The thought has its appeal.</p><p>But it’s the vampires he’s here to see tonight. The bartender brings his whiskey and he sips it as he turns to study them. The mode of dress in the place is bizarre, with seemingly no rhyme or reason beyond personal preference: some wear traditional robes, some are wearing t-shirts and torn jeans. </p><p>His gaze lands on a man in a sleek suit, facing away and tossing a pale sweep of hair back as he chats with a vampire in more customary dress. Harry’s hand tightens until he feels the creak of glass against his palm.  </p><p>The man is tall and lithe and moves with an easy, lazy sort of grace, the slender muscles of his shoulders shifting under his fitted shirt as he gestures with elegant hands. He’s got a cigarette between two fingers and when he lifts it to take a drag, Harry catches a glimpse of the narrow cut of his jawline, sharp cheekbones and an even sharper smirk. Smoke rises in a curl of blue-grey as he exhales, and that’s when Malfoy turns his head and smiles — like he’s completely unsurprised to find Harry watching him.</p><p>Harry swallows his drink and sets down the glass before he breaks it. His feet are rooted to the floor and it’s <i>ridiculous</i> that here, in one of the few places he’s been assured his anonymity would keep without a Glamouring charm, he’s run into someone who would just as soon let him burn to death as piss on him. </p><p>Malfoy tips two fingers in a mock-salute as if saying hello, then holds up one — a curious gesture indicating he wants Harry to stay where he is. He says something to the vampire he’d been speaking with and turns to head in Harry’s direction. Harry’s breath stutters at Malfoy’s smooth, loping strides, an undisguised prowl as he weaves through the crush of bodies in his way. </p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy says over the din when he pulls up at Harry's side. “Fancy seeing you here.”</p><p>He elbows a woman at the bar, wedging himself in so he and Harry are practically chest-to-chest, and gestures to the barkeep. A tall glass appears, slapped down on the counter in a hurry, filled with a sparkling, twilight-purple drink.</p><p>“Why am I surprised?” Harry manages easily enough, raising his voice to be heard, though his throat has gone dry. Malfoy… He smells good, <i>looks</i> good, and Harry's not a little irritated to feel his cock twitching. “Seems like your kind of place if I'd thought to guess beforehand.” </p><p>“Come on,” Malfoy says, rolling his eyes as though Harry’s just taking the piss. He takes a sip of his drink and pulls away with an indecent lick over its long, skinny straw. “You're not even a little relieved to see a familiar face? Anyway, as you said, I’m not the one whose presence is shocking. How’d you find the place?”</p><p>“Someone told me about it,” Harry says, gaze on the crowd again — anything to keep from seeing another swipe of Malfoy’s tongue over his straw, over his thin, shapely lips. “Don’t let me interrupt you. I saw you with that, er… bloke, before.”</p><p>The toe of Malfoy’s shiny Oxford connects with Harry’s ankle. He gives Harry a sinful little smile when he glares. “S’rude to avoid eye contact while having a conversation.”</p><p>“Is that what we were doing?”</p><p>Malfoy snorts. “I don’t know. We’ve never done it properly before, have we?”</p><p>The witch behind Malfoy bumps him and he lurches into Harry with a huff. But his free hand lands on Harry’s hip and his body is a firm, lanky press, and Harry finds himself disinclined to move away, even if he could — which he can’t, a man of more indeterminate nature stepping up to the bar to box him in. </p><p>“Pretty sure you don’t come to this sort of place looking for a proper conversation,” Harry says. His voice comes out husky, wrong, lower than before now that Malfoy’s face is close enough for his hair to brush Harry’s forehead. </p><p>“We can talk about my reasons for being here another time,” Malfoy murmurs, the fingers on Harry’s hip tightening, one long thigh pressed between Harry’s legs. “I’m more interested in yours. Is this what you do on your mysterious holidays out of Britain?”</p><p>“It’s none of your business what I do, whether I’m here or gone.” Harry swallows, cheeks hot. There’s no way Malfoy can’t feel his swiftly hardening cock in the position they’ve got locked in.</p><p>Malfoy leans back a little, nostrils flaring. He plucks the straw out of his drink and brings the glass up, throat working with long gulps as he downs it, then runs his tongue over the moisture clinging to his upper lip. He takes another drag of his cigarette, almost burnt down to the filter now, and stubs it out in Harry’s empty tumbler. </p><p>“Maybe not,” he says in a voice that whispers like silk down Harry’s spine, “but it could be, if you wanted.”</p><p>“What are you on about?”</p><p>The thigh between Harry’s leg moves, a slow rub against his cock. Harry sucks in a breath.</p><p>“Well, what did you come here for?” Malfoy’s eyes glint strangely, the grey growing bright and glassy, almost fevered. “Not the Veelas. You didn’t seem overly impressed with them back in school. And I doubt the Weres, either, though I’ve been told that’s quite the experience; I’d wager you considered them. I’d guess the Boggart room — <i>brave, heroic soul</i> that you are,” he says snidely, quoting the most recent Potter article out in <i>Wizarding Monthly</i>, “but for some reason I don’t peg you for the type to get off on fear. At least not the sort you can dispel with a simple flick of your wand.”</p><p>“Oh, no?” It’s not Harry’s best comeback, to be fair, but he’s having a bit of trouble focussing, what with Malfoy’s thigh undulating slowly against his groin. “What type am I, then?”</p><p>“You want a vampire.”</p><p>“And what if I do?” Harry asks, tilting his chin up to meet Malfoy’s intense stare. He’ll be <i>fucked</i> if he lets Malfoy intimidate him out of the place with a sly smile and an eerily accurate summation of Harry’s needs. </p><p>The man at Harry’s back shifts away; with relief, Harry does too. Only Malfoy follows, spinning them so fluidly Harry doesn’t even realise it’s happening until it’s done, his spine trapped against the lip of the bar, Malfoy’s arms on either side of him.</p><p>“Well then, Potter, you’re speaking my language.”</p><p>In this position, Harry can feel Malfoy’s cock too, pressed high against his pelvic bone and equally hard. He huffs a disbelieving laugh. Malfoy’s eyelashes flutter, lower. He waits.</p><p>“What, did you want to introduce me to your friend?” Harry asks when Malfoy remains silent and expectant. “He’s not exactly what I go for, either. And you were doing so well guessing, before.”</p><p>Malfoy blinks. His biceps tense against Harry’s arms and his smirk flickers, fades, then breaks into a wide, incredulous grin. “Merlin, this ought to be more fun than I originally thought. You’re joking, right?”</p><p>Harry gauges him. Historically, it’s never been a good thing when Malfoy’s amused and he can’t figure out the source of it. </p><p>“I’m always joking,” Harry says warily. “I’m pretty much known for my sense of humour. Glad to live up to my reputation.”</p><p>Malfoy laughs, breath sweet against Harry’s face. He gives a tiny, exasperated shake of his head. Their bodies are plastered together from chest to knee, Malfoy covering him, and just the <i>feel</i> of his arousal is almost enough to make Harry worried he’ll come in his jeans. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>“You’re certainly living up to one of them,” Malfoy mutters. The humour has fled his tone and his gaze is hard and shuttered, but a smile still toys with his mouth. He shifts deliberately and, when the slide of his body wrenches a shudder from Harry, seems to come to a snap decision. </p><p>Wrapping cold fingers around Harry’s wrist, Malfoy tugs him up and away from the bar. Harry tries to shake off his grasp, but Malfoy’s grip is deceptively strong. Harry follows, an objection caught on his tongue — this was supposed to be recon, only — but too fascinated to actually voice it. Malfoy guides them quickly to a set of doors off in a corner, hidden until he taps the wall with his wand. </p><p>“Your hand is freezing,” Harry says… stupidly, as it turns out, because when Malfoy twists his head to look at Harry, there’s a flash of lengthening fang behind his retracted lip.</p><p>“Is that so?” Malfoy says.</p><p>Thunderstruck, Harry manages a brief glimpse of their garish surroundings — faded velvet tapestries and chandeliers flickering pink candlelight over dripping, dusty crystals — before they’re heading up stairs, carpeted treads almost worn through. A small hallway, then Malfoy slants off to the right, hustling them into the first door. He spins them again, shutting the door with Harry’s back as he presses against him. Over his shoulder, Harry spies a huge bed, done up with a heavy satin coverlet and gauzy bed hangings.</p><p>“You’re a vampire,” Harry says blankly. Now that they’re not surrounded by people, Malfoy’s creatureness is obvious, Harry can’t believe he didn’t sense it before.</p><p>“I always said you were unobservant.” Malfoy snickers again.</p><p>“But— You’re a <i>vampire</i>.” Harry shakes his head, a wild surge of anger rising in him at… at <i>something</i> and <i>everything</i>; Malfoy’s an arsehole to be sure, but he’s not supposed to be an <i>undead</i> one.</p><p>“Mind telling me something I don’t know?” Malfoy asks. He swoops in, icy nose running over Harry’s neck. He makes a small, aching sound and exhales. He murmurs, “Like what you came here for, for instance.”</p><p>Harry swallows, his cock gone painfully hard. Two things he most definitely <i>should not</i> be doing, wrapped up in a long, tight package moving against him with a teasing grind. </p><p>Malfoy lifts his head. His eyes are glazed but his voice drips with condescension. “Or you could just continue gawping at me. But watching me wank won’t necessarily be cheaper and I assure you wouldn’t be nearly as much fun.”</p><p>It takes a second for Harry to absorb that but when he does, his breath hiccups to a halt. That word — <i>costs</i> — shouldn’t come as the surprise it does. He knew what this place was when he came in, knew what went on here. Knew that, for the right price, he might find a resolution to his problems.</p><p>Malfoy strokes down Harry’s stomach. He slips Harry’s t-shirt up to trail his fingers against the slender line of hair between Harry’s belly button and waistband, then plays with the button of Harry’s jeans.</p><p>“You— You’re—”</p><p>“Yes, Potter. Me, I.” His voice deepens, roughens. “Catch up, would you? I didn’t think you were <i>that</i> thick.”</p><p>Fuck it. Harry takes a deep breath.</p><p>“And you call <i>me</i> unobservant.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes widen and grow dark. He glances downward, mouth twitching. “Fair enough. Well?”</p><p>“Let me see them.”</p><p>Malfoy rears back, a smug sneer pulling his upper lip. His teeth flash white in the dim, gleaming as his canines lengthen again. He pricks his tongue with the sharp point of one, then drags it over his lips before pressing them together and rubbing them. The gloss left behind smears across Malfoy’s mouth, messy like crimson lipstick after a round of snogging, and Harry’s breath leaves him in a rush. </p><p>It's <i>wrong</i>. So perfectly wrong that Harry has to check the snarl rising in his throat. He came for a reason and can’t think of anyone in the free world less inclined to extend him a favour. </p><p>But as it turns out, that doesn’t really matter.</p><p>Harry buries his hands in Malfoy’s hair and with a hard tug they’re kissing, just like that, the metallic tang of Malfoy’s blood cool against Harry’s taste buds. Malfoy growls, the sound muffled by Harry’s mouth, by the eager push of his tongue inside it. He strays to Harry’s flies again and the button opens with a soft snap, the zipper lowers with a quiet hiss. He slips his hand inside Harry’s jeans to grip his cock through his pants.</p><p>“Merlin,” Malfoy says hoarsely, jerking his mouth away. Some of his smooth confidence has unravelled with their kiss; he looks momentarily confused, but his hand doesn’t stop moving, fingers running light over Harry’s length, tracing the shape of it. </p><p>“It’s not what I’m used to you calling me, but I’m okay with it,” Harry says, feeling more than a little undone himself, shock rippling through him like an electrical current at the realisation of how much he wants this, wants… Malfoy. </p><p>Malfoy laughs, a surprised and surprisingly sweet sound. </p><p>“You should hear what I call you behind your back,” he offers with a wry grin. He presses the mound of his palm to Harry’s cock, then tugs Harry’s jeans down and hooks the waistband of his pants under his balls. Harry sucks in a breath at Malfoy’s touch against his skin, warmer now with borrowed heat. Malfoy bites his lip, fangs tucking over it.</p><p>“What do you want?” he asks again. His touch is light now, teasing, but his gaze is intense. “What would you like me to do, Potter? I think I want to hear you say it.”</p><p>Harry swallows. He stills Malfoy’s hand but Malfoy doesn’t move it away, instead curling his fingers around Harry’s cock to give it a hard squeeze. Harry looks at the shine of his fangs, feels his pulse throb in his throat. In his cock. With more force than is perhaps necessary, he pries Malfoy’s grip from him and pushes him back. </p><p>“Yeah?” Harry says. “Then shut up for once.” He lowers to his knees.</p><p>Malfoy makes a tiny, wounded noise. “Potter—”</p><p>But Harry shakes his head, adrenaline and instinct running hot through him the way they always do when he’s flying blind, when he’s confronted with any real threat. He finds and unclasps the thin, expensive leather of Malfoy’s belt. He leans his face in to rub his chin over the bulge of Malfoy’s cock, mesmerised by the small hitching breaths Malfoy’s taking above him, by the taut quiver of his thighs through his trousers when Harry places his hands on them. </p><p>“Take these off,” Harry says. He licks his lips. </p><p>Malfoy’s hands stray slowly to his flies. He undoes them wordlessly while Harry reaches up to unbutton the lowest buttons of Malfoy’s shirt, baring his stomach to just above his navel. Malfoy inhales sharply at the brush of Harry’s knuckles against his jumping muscles there. He pushes down his trousers, letting them pool around his knees. He hesitates.  </p><p>“Go on,” Harry says, gaze trained on the shape of Malfoy’s erection through his plain black boxer-briefs. </p><p>Suddenly clumsy, Malfoy obeys, hooking his thumbs into the waistband and trying to nudge them down. His cockhead catches on the elastic once, twice. Finally he simply jerks them down with a small hiss, cock popping free to bob in front of Harry’s face, impressively rigid, curving upward toward his belly. Saliva pools in Harry’s mouth at the thick bead of moisture that clings to the slit. He works Malfoy’s pants lower for him and rests his thumbs in the indentations under Malfoy’s pelvic bone, fingers spread around his hips. Malfoy’s arse flexes under his grip.</p><p>“Keep your teeth out,” Harry says, then slides his lips over the tantalising girth of Malfoy’s cock. </p><p>Malfoy curses breathlessly, cock jerking heavy against Harry’s tongue, precome spitting out. So Harry keeps going, mouth descending inch by inch until the head bumps into his soft palate. He finds his own cock with one hand, stifling a groan as he grips it, and peeks up. </p><p>Malfoy’s staring down at him, open mouthed, fangs bared in a silent snarl. His incisors have sharpened along with his canines, and his pupils have dilated so wide Harry can’t see a hint of grey around them. Harry takes a breath and relaxes his throat.</p><p>“<i>Potter!</i>” </p><p>Malfoy’s hands unfist and fall to Harry’s hair, clenching the strands so tight his scalp stings, but even that’s good — too good, Malfoy working Harry’s head back and forth at a quickly increasing pace, fucking his throat with a low whine of desperation. Harry widens his knees and tugs faster on his prick, drool starting to seep from the corners of his mouth, so turned on he can hardly bear it. He tongues at Malfoy’s tight foreskin, bunching it toward the base of his prick as best he can with his nose practically buried in Malfoy’s soft pubic hair. </p><p>Harry pulls in air through his nose when Malfoy finally cants his hips back and swallows around him after Malfoy’s next frantic, deep drive forward. His throat hurts and his balls <i>ache</i>, but he forces himself to slow his hand, not ready for it to be over yet. He pulls back against the resistance of Malfoy’s hands, teeth grazing over the ridge of Malfoy’s prick.</p><p>“Watch it,” Malfoy grits out, but when Harry glances up, his snarl has tilted up at the edges. <i>He liked it</i>. Harry snorts and pulls off, unsure what the pulse of pleasure in his chest means.</p><p>“No,” he says flatly. “You watch it.” </p><p>He ducks his head out from under Malfoy’s hands and swallows him down again. This time, he adds a suck. Malfoy groans, staring down at him, hands hovering in the air for a second as though tempted to hold Harry’s head again. Instead they fall to his sides and Harry lets his mouth slide back and forth over the hard length of Malfoy’s shaft, hot and wet with his saliva. The flavour of his precome grows stronger, not bitter like the other men Harry’s done this with, but sweet with an underlying hint of salt. He lets Malfoy’s prick pop free with a loud slurp to lap at it, Malfoy’s spit-soaked erection jerking up with every lick. </p><p>“I am,” Malfoy says heatedly. Harry glances up again to see lust cast tight across Malfoy’s face, and something softer too, something that makes <i>Harry</i> feel soft and a little bewildered. Malfoy’s chin tucks closer to his chest. “I am watching it, Potter. Watching you lick my cock. Do you know how good you look?”</p><p>“Oh, <i>god</i>.” Harry dives lower with a rumbling moan to take Malfoy’s entire sac into his mouth. He sucks Malfoy’s risen testicles away from his body, the delicate skin crinkling against his moving tongue as he swipes it around them. He knocks Malfoy’s legs wider with his hand and brings one hard knuckle up to massage his perineum. Malfoy’s wet there, too, Harry’s saliva dripping over his balls, down into the crevice of his arse. Malfoy grunts, rotating his hips with a tiny wiggle, hands coming up again and dropping, lightly this time, onto Harry’s head.</p><p><i>This is <b>Malfoy</b></i>, he thinks, a wild, inexplicable surge of pride tearing through him.</p><p>“I’m going to come, Potter,” Malfoy warns raggedly. Harry likes it, likes that half-mad note in his voice. It’s just so... <i>unlikely</i>, all of Malfoy’s posh swagger dissolving under Harry’s tongue.</p><p>The whole thing is unlikely, and not remotely what he came here for, but he can't bring himself to care.</p><p>Harry wants to smile, maybe does a little, heartbeat roaring in his ears like white noise, the swamp of shaky desire streaking through him making him glad he’s on his knees. He releases Malfoy’s balls and ducks down to push his face between Malfoy’s legs, parted lips grinding with soft, smacking sounds where his knuckle was. He reaches up and finds Malfoy’s cock, stroking it in a tight grip, and then Malfoy is bowing over him, cracking groans breaking free from his throat. He comes with long, shuddering pulses, ropes of spunk hitting Harry’s cheek and jaw and hair. He thrusts into Harry’s fist, fingers twisting in Harry’s hair again, gasping noisily until his cock is empty. </p><p>Heart still pounding, Harry rests his forehead against the cool, soft skin of Malfoy’s inner thigh and laughs shakily. His cock is as hard as it’s ever been and he needs to come, but he can’t shake the dreamlike fog engulfing him. He’s just sucked off Draco Malfoy in a seedy room upstairs a creature club. He should probably be ashamed; Merlin knows the people he loves would be appalled at the whole situation. But all he feels is maddened, delighted, <i>alive</i>, Malfoy’s spunk dripping down his temple, marking him. </p><p>He looks up to find Malfoy’s gaze on him again, dark with intent. Harry’s strange euphoria starts to recede but then Malfoy’s hand grips his hair to haul him up, to wrench his head to the side. Harry’s breath catches. </p><p>“Wait—” he forces out, gaze on Malfoy’s fangs. But all Malfoy does is mouth at him and lick off the long streaks of his own come with cool swipes, a mindlessly pleased growl breaking free from his throat.</p><p>“Let’s go to the bed.” He finds Harry’s dick, squeezes it. Harry groans. He can feel Malfoy’s smirk, and <i>fuck</i>, even that feels good, Malfoy’s smugness against his skin. “Take off your denims and have at me, Potter.”</p><p>“Are you always so pretentious?” Harry swallows, dropping his head to his shoulder as Malfoy latches his lips against Harry’s neck and sucks. “Call them jeans, why don’t you.”</p><p>“If you want someone who doesn’t give a toss how they sound, hunt up an American Muggle,” Malfoy murmurs, still stroking him with an indolent hand. “Come <i>on</i>.”</p><p>Harry’s gaze falls to the bed, a kernel of something ugly rising in him at the thought of Malfoy bedding other men there. </p><p>“Here,” he says, rolling his hips into Malfoy’s sly touch. “Just… Don’t stop.”</p><p>Malfoy does though, pausing for a fraction of a second and lifting his head. His pale brows furrow and his fangs shrink a little, points disappearing. His jaw bunches and he draws his head further back with a disconcertingly cool smile. </p><p>“Whatever you say,” he murmurs.</p><p>Harry looks at him, alerted to something by Malfoy’s tone. But before he can figure it out, Malfoy’s tugging on his cock, long fast pulls from base to tip, fist narrowing ruthlessly around the aching head. The loud, wet slap of it as Malfoy eyes him impassively might be mortifying if Harry could feel anything other than his swiftly rising climax, but as it is, it’s just excruciatingly hot.</p><p>“Kiss my… my neck,” Harry breathes. It’s an invitation to danger and an utterly daft one at that, but he bares his throat anyway and hears another faint growl as Malfoy’s grip on him tightens. “Just— don’t bite—”</p><p>“‘Course not. It’s not what we’re about, is it, Potter?” Malfoy pushes him flush with the door, unmindful of the <i>thunk</i> of Harry’s head against it, tongue running over Harry’s pulse. His cock twitches against Harry’s hip as he pulls blood to the surface of Harry’s skin with hard sucks, wanking him almost frantically.  </p><p>Then Malfoy does bite him, dulled teeth sinking against him painfully. Harry distantly hears his own cry as he fucks rough into Malfoy’s touch and starts to come. Shaking from the force of it, he clings to Malfoy’s shoulders, cock shooting warm semen over Malfoy’s fingers. Malfoy catches some with a twist of his hand on the downstroke and swipes it over Harry’s jerking cock, milking it with carelessly tight pulls until Harry sags against the door, arms falling to his sides.</p><p>Awareness returns to him slowly: Malfoy’s touch vanishing from his body; a flash of white teeth; a hand scraping tousled platinum hair back. By the time Harry’s reoriented enough to pry himself off the door, Malfoy’s tucked himself away and ambled to the middle of the room to drop into a burgundy chair, long legs sprawled out before him. He eyes Harry wordlessly and pats his pockets. He retrieves a crumpled pack of cigarettes and taps one out, letting it hang unlit between his lips.  </p><p>“I was right,” he says. “This was amusing.”</p><p>“Happy to oblige,” Harry says, belatedly moving to clean and cover himself up. His throat is pleasantly sore and his body feels watery, still thrumming with little shocks of residual pleasure, so he walks over to the opposite chair in green — ironic, that — and gingerly perches on the edge of it. Though Malfoy dragged him up here with barely a warning and looks just as unruffled as he had downstairs, Harry can sense his dissatisfaction. He clears his throat.</p><p>“What do I owe you?”</p><p>Malfoy rolls his eyes up to the ceiling, a smile flickering at the edges of his mouth. “It’s on the house. Satisfied a curiosity of mine.”</p><p>Harry blinks. “Which was?”</p><p>“How you’d be as a shag,” Malfoy says blithely, fiddling with his cigarette. He heaves himself up from his chair with a sigh. “Feel free to use the attached bathroom if you need before you leave. The door won’t allow you back out — you’ll have to use the Floo,” he says, gesturing to the small fireplace in the corner. He looks at Harry with slitted eyes. “Have a good night.”</p><p>“Wait,” Harry says as Malfoy strides toward the door. He stands. </p><p>“Is there something else?” Malfoy asks. “You did come, didn’t you?”</p><p>“About as well as you did,” Harry says. Malfoy looks at him, gaze veiled. He shrugs and opens the door, then turns back with a thoughtful frown.</p><p>“Don’t come back,” he advises. “The second you walked in, every creature within smelling distance of you got their hackles up. We’re low-profile for the most part, but accidents have been known to happen.”</p><p>Harry sputters, amusement edging out his confusion. “Are you threatening me?”</p><p>Malfoy snorts. “Please. If anything, I saved you tonight. And again,” he says pointedly, “I didn’t charge you for it. Good luck, Potter.”</p><p>The door closes behind him, the twinkle of heavy wards falling like a curtain over it before Harry  manages to snap his mouth shut. He sinks numbly back into his vacated chair and tries to process the whirlwind of the last thirty minutes — none of which he’d anticipated upon coming here. </p><p>That doesn’t happen to him very often these days. He considers busting through the wards but Malfoy’s little smirk as he’d shut the door stops him. </p><p>His neck is tender and he reaches up to probe the bruise Malfoy left on him, gently investigating the indent of teeth — human teeth. </p><p>The bastard didn’t even break the skin.</p>

  <p>~*~</p>
</center><blockquote>
  <p>There’s no real way to describe what Potter’s presence did to the club. I wasn’t kidding when I said I saved him. As soon as he arrived, everyone’s aggressive tendencies went on high alert — including mine, I suppose. It took me several minutes of posturing with the other creatures and a couple more of careful coercion with my own set before I could approach him.</p>
  <p>I meant to get him out of there; call it payback, of sorts. What I didn’t expect was to get so high off his scent in close quarters that the next thing I knew I’d be grinding him against the bar — or that he’d be just as turned on. But I did and he was, and I’ve never been one to let an opportunity pass.</p>
  <p>Trading in the bite was money easily made for me then. It was near-equal to sex — better than, for most — and saved on the cost of feeding. Blood can be pricey depending on your tastes, and mine always did lean toward expensive. The way Potter smelled, his blood wouldn’t even be stored top-shelf; he’d be hidden in the coolest, most warded depths of the cellars, behind the last two worldly bottles of 1694 Elfe Margaux. The Chosen One thing, I supposed, of course he’d be appealing. Still, I was rather proud of managing not to partake, though I’m not so noble to deny wanting to. I came far too close, really, the splatter of my come on his cheek mingling our scents, the milky sapphire of his carotid throbbing a fast tick under my tongue. </p>
  <p>The sex was bloody fantastic, <i>disappointingly</i> so, especially given his disinclination for a fuck. Trust Potter to be the only man in the world to come to a vampire renter and want to go on his knees. He looked brilliant doing it, lips pink and plumped and stretched around my cock, like every dream I used to insist I hadn’t had back in school: on his knees before me on the wet tiles of the Quidditch locker room, slurping quietly on my cock under a table in Potions class, pushing me into a dark alcove off the corridors after a fight and ducking under my robes; there’d been thousands of them, it felt like. To so perfectly personify them… Well, honestly, there had to be something wrong with him. </p>
  <p>Maybe that’s why I didn’t charge him. Yet another impulse I knew I shouldn’t have listened to, considering I was so hungry by the time I left that I ended up spending the rest of the gold I had on me on blood at the bar, before retiring to my flat — without recouping any of it.</p>
  <p>It didn’t matter, I told myself. My only real lie of the night. Well, that and one more.</p>
  <p>My curiosity was nowhere near satisfied.</p>

  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Nursing a dislocated shoulder in Venezuela the following week, Harry’s mind returns to the moment again and again: the tiny quirk to Malfoy’s lips as he’d closed the door behind him, the complicated heat from before. Harry resents the memory — it was supposed to be a one-off.<p>No, it wasn’t <i>supposed</i> to be <i>anything.</i> Certainly not something that would bring him back to the UK sooner than he intends. But old habits die hard, and in what’s <i>clearly</i> Harry’s worst, he lets Malfoy’s vampirism obsess him over the course of the next few weeks, until work becomes less of a mission and more of an excuse to not think about what happened. </p><p>So after a curse explodes at his back, he finds himself at Ron and Hermione’s door, Apparating there as soon as his Portkey lands him in London. There’s too much empty space when he goes too long without seeing them, anyway, despite the way they tend to fuss.</p><p>Hermione hugs him too tightly and he rests a hand in her floof of hair, grateful to be back, but her eyes are narrowed when she pulls away. She palpates the back of his ribs, a soft scowl on her face when he winces. “What happened?”</p><p>“I wasn’t able to funnel a curse in time,” he says, rolling his eyes when Ron hesitates to hug him. Harry wraps him up pointedly, pounding on his back until Ron coughs and shoves him away with a laugh. </p><p>“None of them have got him yet, though,” Ron says dryly, nudging Hermione with his elbow. </p><p>“How long can you stay?”</p><p>“A few days or so,” Harry says. “Hey, I missed you guys.”</p><p>Hermione sighs, expression softening. “You’re back sooner than last time,” she says as though it’s something, at least. Harry supposes it is; she and Ron have hated the danger Cursebreaking has put him in and how much he’s thrived off of taking such risks from the start. But they bear up under it as well as they can; the work he does is necessary, and even they agree he’s uncommonly good at it. </p><p>“Just in time, too,” Harry says, sniffing appreciatively. He lets them lead him to the kitchen, where the smells of Molly’s cooking are slowly growing stronger, warming under a steady charm. </p><p>Ron taps the warming charm to dissolve it and grabs a few plates, levitating them over to the table as Hermione unnecessarily helps Harry to sit. She tuts at him and sits down, shooting Ron a fond look as he carries over a casserole dish of shepherd’s pie and serves heaping portions. </p><p>“So, why so soon?” Ron asks as Hermione shoves a wad of napkins at him. He tucks a few of them under the collar of his shirt and pointedly takes a careful bite. Harry laughs. </p><p>“I wanted to talk vampires.”</p><p>Ron’s chewing slows. “I thought you said you didn’t need to research—”</p><p>“I said ‘not yet,’” Harry corrects. He looks at his plate, pleased at the rumble from his stomach. He never finds himself quite as hungry as he is when confronted with Molly’s cooking. He reminds himself to send her an Owl soon. He forks up a bite and groans delightedly, ignoring Hermione’s indignant little huff. </p><p>“I’m fairly certain your exact words were, ‘no chance in hell, thanks,’” she says smoothly, pairing it with a small smile to show she’s not angry. She’s probably right, too; she usually is.  </p><p>“That was then,” Harry says simply. “I’m taking on bigger curses now.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione fall quiet, the implications more clear than they’d obviously like. Harry forces himself to swallow, doggedly working his way through the meal as they finish eating in silence. </p><p>Dinner mostly done, Hermione pushes her plate away. “Okay,” she says brusquely. “You’ll need to start looking in the Public Creatures’ Register.”</p><p>Harry wipes his mouth. “The what now?”</p><p>“It’s like Hogwarts’ Book of Admittance,” she says. “Updated automatically whenever a witch or wizard living in the UK is changed or comes into their genetic birthright.”</p><p>“How is that different than what they wanted to do with werewolves?” Harry asks. </p><p>“Well, they asked for one,” Hermione explains in her pragmatic way. “It gives them a measure of protection and equal rights, which as you know they’ve not always had. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than it was. Even Teddy’s on it… Didn’t you know that? Harry, shouldn’t you know that sort of thing?” She gives him a speculative look.</p><p>“It’s possible I’ve missed a few things,” he says. Ron snorts.</p><p>“And why would he, anyway?” Ron asks Hermione rhetorically. “They’re not even considered Dark, anymore. Well, except for—”</p><p>“Ow! Hermione!” Harry glares at her and rubs his shin. She colours and darts a glance at Ron, stabbing into her last bite a little viciously.</p><p>“Sorry. Leg spasm.” She clears her throat.</p><p>Harry looks at her. “Except for Malfoy.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione exchange a glance.</p><p>“You know about Malfoy?” Ron asks. </p><p>“Of course I know about Malfoy,” Harry says blandly. “We went to school with him for six years.” </p><p>“But— you <i>know</i> about <i>Malfoy?</i>”</p><p>Harry shakes his head, a huff of irritated laughter escaping. “Emphasising words doesn’t really change the meaning of your question. Yeah, I know about him.”</p><p>“I’m shocked,” Hermione murmurs. Harry looks at her, then to Ron.</p><p>“See? She didn’t need to emphasise anything.” </p><p>Ron rolls his eyes. “She never does.”</p><p>“How’d you hear about…?” </p><p>“I ran into him,” Harry says. He takes off his glasses and scrubs a hand over his face. “What I want to know is why neither of you told me. And how long he’s been like that. And why he’s—”</p><p>“Well, it’s not as if we run in the same circles,” Ron says with a grimace. “Vampires aren’t considered Dark anymore, but they’re not exactly fit for— Uh, you know, polite society.”</p><p>Harry’s never given a toss about polite society but it’s interesting that Ron thinks it would matter. Even Hermione nods.</p><p>“Might be why they needed a registry,” he says bluntly. “Anyway, we got on. Sort of.” Heat climbs Harry’s neck and he wills it away. “Better than we used to, anyway. I thought— he might be able to answer some questions for me.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione exchange another look he can’t interpret, but thankfully all Hermione says is, “Maybe just check the Registry first,” before letting the subject drop. </p><p>It’s not a bad idea, so the following day Harry Glamours himself and makes his way through the winding catacombs of the Registrar’s office to find that Malfoy’s name is indeed listed under <i>Vampires, British Descent</i>. He’s been a vampire for almost two years.</p><p>The knowledge of that sits uneasy in Harry’s chest. He wants to know what happened. How. Wants to fill in the details beyond where his own story with Malfoy ended. But his name in elegant, flowing script gives nothing more — not how long he’s been pulling at creature clubs, not whether or not he feels ostracised by society. A sharp stab of sympathy hits Harry. It seems a safe assumption to make: Death Eater-cum-vampire rentboy, cut off from everything he once knew.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>In keeping with the tradition of being an epic pain in Harry’s arse, Malfoy manages to foil that safe assumption a mere two days later — laughing with Pansy Parkinson across the pub Ron and Neville drag Harry to. His eyes catch on the derisive tilt of Malfoy’s smile as soon as he follows Ron in, and Malfoy looks up with a shocked expression as Harry sinks into a booth, equally stunned. It’s like Malfoy can see right through the disguise of Harry’s lackluster features to the scar on his forehead.<p>Which, Harry realises, he’d not even need to. What had Malfoy called it? </p><p>
  <i>Smelling distance.</i>
</p><p>There are easily half a dozen tables between them. More than a little perturbed, Hary wonders what it says about his body odour that Malfoy can smell him from all the way across the room and keeps stealing resentful glances.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s Malfoy,” Neville says, craning his neck to follow Harry’s gaze. Harry drops his eyes and Neville shrugs. “He’s been keeping out of trouble, don’t worry.”</p><p>“Really?” Harry asks, picking at his thumbnail. “How so? What’s he been up to, anyway?”</p><p>“Well, he’s, uh—” Neville glances at Ron, who narrows his eyes.</p><p>“Harry…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Neville clears his throat again. “He’s, uh, changed a bit.”</p><p>Taking pity on him, Harry nudges Neville with his foot. “I know. I… saw him, recently.”</p><p>“Really?” Neville starts to swivel his head again to look, but checks himself in time. “He never comes out, really. Not like this. He’s sort of like you, these days; you get glimpses of him once in awhile, but— Well, I don’t expect a lot of doors open to him since he…”</p><p>“What, became a Death Eater or became a vampire?”</p><p>“Both,” Neville says uncomfortably. “I’m not saying I’d like to run into him, you understand, but that’s mostly because he’s… well, Malfoy. Though he does…”</p><p>“He does…?” </p><p>Neville’s cheeks darken and he takes another peek over his shoulder. Harry looks too; Malfoy’s staring at them, gaze flat. Neville shakes his head. “Nothing.”</p><p>He sighs and lowers his voice. “Anyway, no one sees him out much. I think mainly because vampires are reclusive. Gran always knows what people are up to and ever since he, uh, changed, even she has no idea. He’s not at the Manor, she knows that much.”</p><p>“This is a topic you guys discuss a lot?”</p><p>“Pureblood stuff,” Neville says dryly. “I’ll just go get our drinks.”</p><p>He heads to the bar and Harry looks over again to see Malfoy ducking his head to whisper something in Parkinson’s ear, gaze sliding to Harry once more. Parkinson flicks Harry a distrustful glance, her mouth pulling into a sour little bow of disapproval, and Malfoy rises with a small jerk of his chin in Harry’s direction. He makes for the loo.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Ron catches his arm as he gets up, grip steady and strong as his gaze. “Don’t do it, mate,” he says plaintively. “Not him.”</p><p><i>Why <b>not</b> him, if it’s got to be someone?</i> Harry doesn’t say it.</p><p>“Due diligence. Just going to say hi,” he says, shaking him off as Nev returns to the table carrying three pints. </p><p>“In the bathroom?” Neville says behind him. Ron grumbles something in response Harry’s glad to not make out. </p><p>When he pushes open the door to the loo, Malfoy’s lounging aggressively against the outside of a stall, arms folded over his chest. He looks good, if Harry disregards the scowl on his face. </p><p>“Stalking me never ends how you think it will,” he says.</p><p>“How do I think this is supposed to end?” Harry asks, adrenaline already pumping high. </p><p>“I don’t know, another wand fight in the bathroom?” Malfoy sniffs. “Have fun gossiping with your friends about me?”</p><p>“You’d know. You could hear everything, couldn’t you?”</p><p>Malfoy dips his chin, a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</p><p>“So what was important enough to interrupt my gossip session?” Harry asks. “I was riveted.”</p><p>He’s riveted <i>now</i> actually, a realisation that does nothing good for his peace of mind. Malfoy’s exaggerated lean against the stall does even less, showing off the sharp cut of his black trousers, one long leg crossed languidly over the other. It makes the material stretch across his crotch, highlighting the soft bulge there. He’s got the sleeves of his dress shirt rolled up to the elbow and though Harry only catches a glimpse of his oddly faded Mark when Malfoy shifts a little, he gets the sense it’s a deliberate reminder. </p><p>“I am rather fascinating, if I do say so myself.” Malfoy’s smirk fades. “I did it for your own bloody good, Potter.”</p><p>“Uh.” It takes Harry a second before he realises Malfoy’s not referring to sixth year or talking about wanking him off. “What’s that, now?”</p><p>“Banned you from the club. I’m not particularly known for my kindnesses, but believe me when I say that was one.” Malfoy peers at him, unclenching a little when Harry falters. “Isn’t that why you followed me?”</p><p>“People <i>go</i> there for the danger,” Harry points out, recovering quickly. “Worried about me, Malfoy? I can take care of myself, you know.”</p><p>“So says every wizarding publication since 1998. Have you really not come back?” Absurdly, Malfoy looks a little offended. Harry bites back a smile. </p><p>“You told me not to,” Harry says, like he’d been planning on cooperating. The pull toward Malfoy is inexplicable considering Harry’s immunity to hypnosis charms, but it guides Harry’s footsteps closer nonetheless. </p><p>Malfoy cracks a humourless laugh. “And now’s when you value my opinion. Alright. Good to know. You just fucking refuse to let me…”</p><p><i>Win</i>, Harry thinks he’s going to say. But Malfoy cuts himself off with a short, sharp exhale. </p><p>“Why’d you come in here, then?”</p><p>“I’d been beckoned,” Harry mocks. “Why did you? Do vampires need the loo?”</p><p>“Of course we do.” His throat works silently as he watches Harry drift nearer. “When we eat and drink.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you bite me?”</p><p>“You told me not to. And anyhow,” Malfoy adds with obvious relish, “I didn’t <i>want</i> to.” </p><p>Harry swallows the bubble of laughter that threatens. </p><p>“But you didn’t even think about it?” he says, slipping into Malfoy’s space, a direct reversal of their roles a few weeks ago. “I bet I taste as good as I smell.”</p><p>Malfoy sneers, sending a pleasant little jolt through Harry from the way his fangs flash. “That’s supposed to recommend it?”</p><p>This time, Harry does laugh. He lowers his eyes to study the growing shape of Malfoy’s cock pointedly and when he looks back up, Malfoy’s sneer has shifted to a glare.</p><p>“Seems like,” Harry says softly.</p><p>“Maybe that’s just a reaction to how easily I could kill you.” He snorts and lifts his wand, raising his eyebrows when Harry doesn’t move. A quick swish of it and Malfoy’s magic dissolves Harry’s disguise. “You looked stupid.”</p><p>Harry looks at him; there’s a compliment in there, somewhere. </p><p>There’s no part of him that can pretend this is a good idea, but he’s known he was going to seek Malfoy out again since that night in the club. And anyway, Harry doesn’t think he can bear waking up even once more with his dick so hard it <i>hurts</i> even though the inside of his pants is sticky, like he’s already come twice in his sleep. His stomach flips when their hips meet. Malfoy turns his head to the side.</p><p>“At least put up a fucking ward, if you insist on it,” he says under his breath, chest rising and falling against Harry’s. “And this one’s going to cost you.”</p><p>Harry flicks his fingers behind him, sealing the door. Malfoy glances over, a small knit high on the bridge of his nose, and finally looks at him again. His lip curls, fangs already sharp.</p><p>“We don’t have time for something that’ll cost me,” Harry says.</p><p>“<i>Any</i> of my time costs. What do you want, Potter?”</p><p>“What I didn’t get last time,” Harry says, heart skipping with nerves or desire, or both. </p><p>Malfoy’s eyelashes lower. “You mean, what you turned down.”</p><p>Nodding, Harry says, “Didn’t want it in a whorehouse.”</p><p>“Just with a whore?” </p><p>The word sends a shock of displeasure through Harry and he takes a step back, but Malfoy catches him, sliding his hands chillingly under Harry’s t-shirt, over Harry’s spine. He slips them down the back of Harry’s jeans, fingers digging in, and hikes Harry up an inch, fitting their bodies tightly together, rolling Harry’s hips against him. He’s just as hard as Harry is and their mouths are bare millimetres apart, lips brushing so lightly against one another’s Harry wonders if the intensity of his arousal is making him hallucinate it. But Malfoy’s breath is cool against him too, his fingers tight enough to bruise, and the duelling sensations centre him.</p><p>“Call this negotiation, then,” Harry says. “What else do you offer?” </p><p>“Quite a lot,” Malfoy murmurs heatedly. He wiggles his hands deeper into Harry’s jeans to cup his arse, massaging the cheeks apart. “I offer everything. I’ll kiss you, anywhere you like. I’ll suck your cock so sweetly you’ll not be able to have a wank without remembering it. I think I’d enjoy that. I could finger myself for you, put on a show. Maybe you’d be the one coming on my face, then.” </p><p>He pulls one hand out of Harry’s jeans to slide it around his hip. Harry shivers as Malfoy palms him boldly, investigating the swollen outline of his prick.</p><p>“And more,” Malfoy says, breath coming light and quick. He strokes down to tease Harry’s balls with barely-there touches for a few seconds, then moves back up to his cock. “<i>More.</i> What if I bent over for you? Yes, that’s it. I could hold myself open, let you watch as you shoved <i>this,</i>” he squeezes Harry’s erection for emphasis, “all the way up my arse. Anything you like, for a price. Though I have to admit, I never took you as the type.”</p><p>“But you take all types, don’t you?” Quick as a Snitch, he grabs both of Malfoy’s wrists and pins them to the stall above his head, gripping them with one hand. He reaches between them and quickly undoes their flies. Malfoy arches against him like a cat, eyes flaring hot as Harry pulls his prick out and wriggles his own jeans and pants down far enough to free his cock. He circles them both with his fist, hissing at the press of hard-on-hard. </p><p>“All of them,” Malfoy says, an unrepentant twist to his mouth. Harry surges forward to kiss it off, prising Malfoy’s lips open with his tongue. Malfoy’s wrists flinch in his grasp but his tongue slides readily against Harry’s, cool at first and then warmer. Harry licks over one elongated fang and Malfoy groans, wrenching his head back. “But I’ll charge you extra, just for the hell of it.”</p><p>Harry snorts. He strokes over them, seeking Malfoy’s mouth in another kiss. He’s so hard, his prick <i>drips</i>, foreskin sliding along Malfoy’s in his grasp. He thumbs roughly over the leak of moisture from their slits and Malfoy groans as Harry pushes his middle finger between their cockheads to rub against the tender underside of Malfoy’s glans. When Harry pulls away to breathe, Malfoy’s slender lips are pink.</p><p>“Still get off on a power-play, do you?” </p><p>“Hypocrite,” Malfoy says breathlessly. He closes his eyes, hair sliding against the side of the stall as he tilts his head back, his fangs peeking out from below his upper lip. He looks like a fallen angel, a rosy flush melting over the cut of his cheekbones, the high arch of his forehead creased. He fucks into Harry’s grip, cock throbbing. “<i>Harder.</i> Come on, Potter. Dirty me up a bit.”</p><p>A ragged little moan slips out of Harry as he complies, jacking them in tandem with faster, tighter pulls of their pricks, sweaty palm issuing small smacking sounds each time he drags it down. It doesn’t take much; he comes swiftly, groaning and spurting over his knuckles and Malfoy’s prick. Malfoy follows right after, eyes wide open and fixed on Harry’s as he shudders out his climax in Harry’s hand, his soft cry swallowed in Harry’s kiss. </p><p>Harry sinks against him, breathing heavily. He breaks the kiss and strokes over their softening pricks once more, then releases them to cling to Malfoy in an attempt at staying upright.</p><p>“I don’t really charge by the hour, but you’ll have to let go of me eventually,” Malfoy says, panting. His tone is wry and a still little throaty, and Harry glances up to see Malfoy’s gaze on his mouth, dark and oddly conflicted. </p><p>“How do you charge?” </p><p>The strange throb of uncertainty between them snaps at his question. Malfoy nudges him back with his hips. With a shaky exhale, Harry lets go of Malfoy’s wrists and pries his fingers off where he’s dug them into Malfoy’s ribs. He steps away, casting a perfunctory cleaning spell over both of them and pulling up his pants and jeans, the room still a little unstable around him. </p><p>“On a case by case basis,” Malfoy says after a brief pause. He fishes his wand out of his pocket and points it at Harry again, renewing his Glamour and, strangely, clearing the smudges their close proximity has made on his glasses. He pushes off the side of the stall, wandering over to the the sinks and turning on the taps. Washing his hands briskly, he meets Harry’s gaze in the mirror. “Fifty Galleons, in this one.”</p><p>“Is that all,” Harry deadpans. “I’m surprised you didn’t empty my vaults for what happened last month.” </p><p>Malfoy smirks and shakes off his hands, murmuring a quick drying spell over them. He turns and leans against the sink basin, raising an eyebrow. His hair is ruffled, but he looks remarkably unaffected for someone who just came so sweetly in Harry’s grip.</p><p>“Well, cough up. This has been fun and all, but Pansy probably thinks you’ve killed me in here by now.” </p><p>“Yeah, well, Ron probably hopes that’s what I did.” Harry rolls his eyes and digs in his pockets, finally pulling out a ten Galleon piece. Malfoy huffs a laugh.</p><p>“You’re joking, right? That’s pathetic, Potter.”</p><p>Harry flicks it to him and Malfoy snatches it out of the air so deftly Harry doesn’t see him do it — just the gold catching the light as it spins, then disappears. He knows somewhere deep down he should feel guilty, but it won’t come. It feels too much like a challenge neither of them can back down from, a game they might have engaged in if they’d known it existed, once upon a time. </p><p>“I can get you the rest,” Harry says. “Or—”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyebrow lifts higher. “Or?”</p><p>“I have plenty at home,” Harry says. “You could come there later. Do some actual work. Overcharge me again.”</p><p>Opening his hand, Malfoy looks down at the coin in it for a long moment. “Housecalls are a hundred. What’s your address?”</p><p>“12 Grimmauld Place. It’s—”</p><p>“I know where it is,” Malfoy says shortly. He tucks the Galleon in the pocket of his waistcoat. “Midnight. And take your friends elsewhere. We were here first.”</p><p>“We can’t share a pub?”</p><p>Malfoy straightens and approaches. “I don’t exactly trust that you won’t flatten me against the bartop and try to have me,” he says, voice low. An image flashes before Harry: everyone watching as he does just that, Malfoy’s long legs wrapped around his hips as his buttocks clench rhythmically. He swallows and Malfoy smiles. He drifts a light thumb over the side of Harry’s neck. “Use a freshening charm before you come out; you still smell like sex, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p>Touch dropping away, Malfoy heads to the door and hesitates, his hand on the handle. “Don’t mention the club to anyone.”</p><p>Harry inhales. Even telling him that much gives Harry leverage, which Malfoy’s got to understand.</p><p>“Got it.” He catches Malfoy’s free arm and Malfoy’s gaze flashes up to his. “I won’t.”</p><p>Malfoy looks at him, expressionless. </p><p>“A hundred and fifty,” he says, and walks out.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>“Fifteen minutes is a bit long to say hi,” is all Ron says, Neville discreetly looking away, when Harry rejoins them to hustle them out of the pub. But later, when Harry makes his excuses to leave, Ron claps him on the shoulder and leans in. “I don’t know what the bloody fuck you think you’re doing, but be careful, Harry.”<p>The reminder is unnecessary and Ron knows it, and the concern on his face seems unfair. But Harry just forces a smile and pats Ron on the back. “Aren’t I always?”</p><p>“Not funny,” Ron says but leaves it, though he gives Harry a significant look that makes him feel guilty.</p><p>He makes it home an hour early, body already primed for another go. Time enough for a shower, time enough for nerves to set in. Tidying up his bedroom takes almost no effort given how rarely he sleeps there these days. It’s best not to get ahead of himself, but he can’t resist the urge to check his watch as midnight nears, can’t help the disappointment that bleeds through as the hands hit twelve and there’s no accompanying knock on the door. </p><p>Can’t help checking the stoop at precisely five after, just in time to see Malfoy Apparate with an impressively soft pop.</p><p>“Oh,” he says, blinking innocently when he sees Harry. “Did I keep you waiting?”</p><p>“Not really,” Harry says, grinning at Malfoy’s quickly-hidden scowl. He withdraws the purse from his pocket and dangles it, heavy with gold, from one fingertip. Like a Muggle magician, Malfoy takes it with a flourish of his hands, hiding it away somewhere within his cloak without counting it. </p><p>“Well?” Malfoy looks past him. “Aren’t you going to invite me in?”</p><p>“Isn’t that a myth?”</p><p>“It’s common courtesy, Potter.”</p><p>“I thought we should talk, first.”</p><p>“Kinky.” Malfoy’s hand slides to Harry’s arm propped on the doorjamb, blocking his entrance. “But unnecessary. I can assure you that I can take whatever you’ve got to shell out.”</p><p>“And the reverse is also true.” Harry lowers his arm. Malfoy smirks and steps smoothly inside, taking care to brush their bodies close. Harry shuts the door. “But about the biting—”</p><p>He falls silent to see that Malfoy has halted, still half-facing him. His face is frozen, eyes wide, pupils dilating. His fangs are already out. </p><p>“Changed your mind?” Malfoy says roughly, coming out of his strange trance. </p><p>“Not— No,” Harry says, wanting to just from the compelling heat of Malfoy’s stare. “Just making sure we’re on the same page.”</p><p>“I won’t bite you, Potter,” Malfoy says, nose in the air like he’s scenting it, “but I’d never go so far to say <i>that</i>.”</p><p>Harry steps closer, but Malfoy’s hand stops him. He looks bewildered, almost like he doesn’t realise that his fingers are slowly sinking into Harry’s shirt, his pause turning into a grip. </p><p>“Are you okay? Malfoy?”</p><p>“Are <i>you?</i>”</p><p>Malfoy pushes him back, just slightly, eyes unfocused. His fingers twist in the hem of Harry’s shirt and he lifts it off Harry without any warning, knocking his glasses crooked as he wrestles it over Harry’s head. Harry’s breath catches as Malfoy finds the mostly-healed gash on the back of his ribcage, fingers following its jagged edges. </p><p>“What’d you have this covered with?” Malfoy murmurs. He doesn’t wait for a response, pushing his nose against Harry’s neck and inhaling, licking over the beat of his pulse. </p><p>“Meditape,” Harry says under his breath, hesitating only slightly before tilting his head back to allow Malfoy better access. Malfoy rumbles out something suspiciously like a purr, the cold tip of his nose sending chills down Harry’s chest as his thumbs find and flick his tightening nipples lightly. </p><p>Malfoy lifts his head, the soft pads of his fingers still circling Harry’s nipples insolently, grey eyes intent and oddly dreamy. “Cover anything like that up after your shower, next time.”</p><p>
  <i>Next time.</i>
</p><p>The assumption isn’t unwelcome. </p><p>Harry tries to take off Malfoy’s shirt as well, but buttons ping off and the collar tears in his attempt to wrangle the thing off over his head. Malfoy looks down with a throaty chuckle as it finally drops to the floor, then presses his palm around Harry’s nape, silently directing his head in another tilt. He lowers his head and takes Harry’s mouth in a deep kiss, spiked fangs skimming Harry’s lower lip, tongue fucking firmly against his. He tastes like mints, his mouth so hot and slick the kiss blots out Harry’s senses. When Malfoy finally pulls away, Harry’s jeans are open and shoved down around his thighs, the backs of Harry’s knees have hit the edge of the couch, and he has no recollection of getting there. </p><p>“Malfoy, what’s—? What are you doing?”</p><p>“Giving you your money’s worth,” Malfoy breathes, running hard knuckles over the underside of Harry’s exposed prick, which jumps at his touch. He uses his shoe to push Harry’s jeans and pants all the way off, then pushes Harry down onto the sofa. He shucks his ruined shirt, his trousers and loafers, discarding everything in a thoughtless heap on the floor, but leaves his black socks on, an absurdly sweet contrast to his pale skin. </p><p>Harry’s mouth floods with saliva. Malfoy’s body is lovely, tall and elegant and almost coltishly thin, the jutting angles of the bones in his hips and ribs just prominent enough to define the muscles in his legs and arms and stomach. His chest is sleek and mostly bare between his beaded nipples, but under his belly button a narrow line of hair runs down to the neat thatch of curls surrounding his cock, long and flushed and arcing, balls pink and full beneath. Malfoy climbs in Harry’s lap and fits his face into the crook of his neck again. </p><p>Shaking, Harry sifts hands through Malfoy’s silky hair and allows it. Malfoy’d only need to apply the slightest bit of pressure with his fangs and…</p><p>“Fuck,” Malfoy mumbles, muffled, tongue dancing light over Harry’s collarbone, over the tense cords of his throat. He brackets Harry’s hips with his feet, wedging them into the back of the sofa cushions and bending his knees to get closer. He humps against Harry clumsily, Harry’s cock skimming off his crease. “Put it <i>in</i> me, Potter.” </p><p>“Wait, for fuck’s sake, I want you wet, <i>wait—!</i>”</p><p>Malfoy hums into his neck, still blindly trying to fit Harry into him, awkward ruts pushing the stiffness of his cock against Harry’s stomach, precome trailing damply over his skin there. Harry takes a gasping breath and lets his head fall back, coasting his hand over Malfoy’s arse, fingers dipping in to soak his hole with lube. It flutters under his touch and Harry can’t resist pressing two fingers in, cock jumping with anticipation as Malfoy groans and sucks harder on his neck, fangs carefully covered with his lip. He rises, batting Harry’s hand away, and takes Harry’s cock in his grip, angling him. Harry holds his breath, heart stopping for a moment — a long, dizzying one in which Malfoy breaches himself on Harry’s prick, the ring of Malfoy’s sphincter stretching wet and tight around it. Harry pushes off against the floor in a bid to get deeper, hands gripping Malfoy’s hips as Malfoy continues to descend. </p><p>“<i>Fuck</i>, yes,” Malfoy breathes, lifting his head away. His pupils are blown, his unnaturally pale cheeks tinged pink. Settling, Harry’s cock lodged up deep, Malfoy blinks and tucks himself closer, his forehead against Harry’s. “I knew you had to be good for something.”</p><p>Harry’s unbidden laugh breaks off into a strangled moan as Malfoy starts to move. His cock is so deeply embedded that every tiny motion of Malfoy’s swiveling hips, every flinch of his inner muscles, sparks sensation down Harry’s shaft, lancing it up his spine, his balls already drawing up to hug his body. Malfoy plasters himself against Harry and works up a fast rhythm, softening inside, his cock dragging against the clenching planes of Harry’s stomach.</p><p>“Do you know what it’s like to get bitten as you fuck?” Malfoy asks, working Harry’s cock inside him with rough, grinding bounces. He leans back, one hand on Harry’s knee for balance, cock smacking indecently against Harry’s belly. It drives Harry impossibly deeper, and Malfoy’s tongue flicks out over his fangs — four of them, canines and incisors, all wickedly sharp. “The kind of orgasm it gives you?”</p><p>Harry slides his hands down, cupping Malfoy’s arse and spreading his cheeks. He can’t <i>think</i> beyond the maddeningly good friction around his cock. He exhales shakily. “Mine’ll be good enough. Just shut up and keep, <i>fuck</i>, keep doing <i>that.</i>”</p><p>“Wasn’t an offer, Potter,” Malfoy chokes out. </p><p>Malfoy’s lower lip disappears under his fangs. His eyes flutter closed and he allows Harry to speed up the pace of his hips, thighs trembling on either side of him, arse undulating over Harry’s prick. Harry pumps deeper, sweat trickling down his temples, glasses knocked askew on his face, and suddenly Malfoy’s back bends. “Fuck, <i>there</i>—!” </p><p>Harry bucks into him, control spiralling from his grasp. He can <i>feel</i> the swollen little nub of Malfoy’s prostate rubbing against the ridge of his cockhead on every instroke, can feel Malfoy’s deliberate clenches melt into the unintentional rhythmic spasms of his oncoming orgasm, and his prick aches as his own need to climax rises to a frenzy, breath bursting out of him in small, needy wheezes. </p><p>“Can I— Shit, Malfoy, I’m going to—”</p><p>Malfoy moans, taut and unmoving for Harry’s frantic thrusts upward, face tight with concentration. “<i>Yes,</i> I want it,” he rasps out. “Make me sticky with it.”</p><p>Harry shudders, yanking him down against his hips to hold him there, cock jerking inside him hard as he spills, flooding Malfoy’s hole with warm semen. The slap of skin on skin transitions into filthy wet squelches and Harry finds Malfoy’s leaking prick, pulling it from base to tip with graceless tugs as he comes. And then Malfoy’s coming too, a guttural shout tearing from his throat. His cock pulses in Harry’s hand, painting Harry’s belly with long, gleaming stripes as his body tenses and Harry fucks in and in and <i>in</i>, blindly forcing his cock past every clamp of Malfoy’s arse. He squeezes the head of Malfoy’s prick and it oozes out another gob of come into Harry’s fist as his orgasm finally starts to slow. </p><p>“<i>Why,</i>” Malfoy says, voice thready, chest heaving, “are you doing this, Potter? If not for the bite?” He wriggles his hips, wrenching another groan from Harry.</p><p>“I’m a very stupid man.” Harry slips his hand up to Malfoy’s waist and tugs him closer. After a moment of resistance, Malfoy comes, settling against Harry’s chest and bending his face into Harry’s neck, idly licking over the sweat gathered there. Harry shivers.</p><p>“I already knew that,” Malfoy says. “Why else?”</p><p>“Reckless, too, people say.” Harry sucks in a breath when Malfoy writhes a little, slowly working his inner muscles around Harry’s softening prick. He pulls back, lips pursed. His gaze slides downward, sparking on his own come over Harry’s stomach and chest, pausing to look at the way they’re positioned, his legs on either side of Harry’s lap. When he looks up, there’s something in his face that makes Harry’s calming heart skip a beat. </p><p>“Why, really?”</p><p>“Call it an experiment,” Harry says. Malfoy shifts a bit, blinking. Harry opens his mouth, but Malfoy interrupts him with a sardonic smile. </p><p>“To test what hypothesis?”</p><p>“Maybe I was just curious too,” Harry says.</p><p>“And?” </p><p>“And I think,” Harry says as Malfoy pulls further away, one patrician brow lifting, “it calls for further research. Why are <i>you</i> doing this?”</p><p>Malfoy licks his lips, fangs shrinking. He slides off Harry’s lap with a tiny grimace and stands.  </p><p>“Unspeakables pay a hundred Galleons a go for research subjects,” he says. “And while I think they get off doing it, it’s probably more mental stimulation on their part.”</p><p>Harry snorts and looks at him. </p><p>“Name your price,” he says.</p><p>“Depends on what you’re looking for,” Malfoy says, bending to grab his clothing. He pulls his wand from his cloak to cast a cleaning charm over himself and Harry regrets the loss of those shiny streaks down the insides and backs of Malfoy’s thighs, the way his cock suddenly looks unused. He starts dressing and tilts Harry a curious look. “You’re not often in town, as far as I know. Would you be looking for a quick bit of research whenever you pass through?”</p><p>“I’ll be back more regularly for awhile,” Harry says. He clears his throat. “Say, twice a week for… I don’t know how long.” </p><p>Malfoy jumps a little as he tugs up his trousers. He slips his shirt on, holding it closed in irritation when his tailoring charms don’t work. </p><p>“Simple enough. Two hundred. For something like this. Plus recompense for any damages,” he says with a mulish look. “Each time.”</p><p>“And what if I want something more?”</p><p>“More,” Malfoy echoes, brow furrowing. His eyes clear. “What more? I’d wager you don’t need to pay someone to stroke your...ego.”</p><p>It shouldn’t be charming, the flicker of perverse amusement around Malfoy’s mouth, but it is.</p><p>“And how much would get you to agree to that?” Harry asks</p><p>“Gringott’s doesn’t carry the amount,” Malfoy says. Harry snorts as Malfoy sits in a side chair to slip his shoes on. Malfoy glances at him. </p><p>“But you can Owl me,” he says quietly. “And we can work something out.”</p><p>“Done,” Harry says.</p>

</center><blockquote>
  <p>Pansy was livid after dinner, dragging me aside and pressing me until I explained what happened. </p>
  <p>“Potter can hurt you,” she said.</p>
  <p>That much, I already knew.</p>
  <p>I considered not going. I wasn’t that certain of my control, having given in so quickly in the loo, Potter pressing close and smelling the way he did. I could envision biting him so clearly: rivulets of blood seeping down the back his shoulder, hypnotic scarlet threads leaking from the soft inside of his thigh toward his arse. I’d never intended to have him at the club and already I couldn’t resist him, couldn’t look past his <b>wanting</b> of me. </p>
  <p>I wanted to see where it went. Potter’s unbridled desire and indifference to its context were the slap of a glove against my cheek. It required a response, didn’t it? For honour’s sake.</p>
  <p>“You don’t know what you’re doing, Draco,” Pansy said.</p>
  <p>When did I ever, where he was concerned?</p>
  <p>Potter’s home was its own sort of punishment for my curiosity, the world lurching around me as he shut the door — every bloody centimetre of the place was saturated with him. I could sense turmeric-tinged sweat coming from the kitchen, could smell lingering notes of his spunk from an afternoon wank Potter’d had on the sofa. Pheromones hung heavy in the air like ripe fruit and my cock lengthened brutally fast in time with my teeth.</p>
  <p>I barely remember the sex so much as the blur of chemistry and feel-good endorphins flooding my system, Potter’s heat sweltering against me, warming me up from the inside out. On the occasion a punter wanted a shag back when I did frequent bedwork, it was always in <i>addition</i> to the bite. They’d get off twice, and I’d be paid in money and blood. Better than when I was human, at least.</p>
  <p>That sex could be so devastating with Potter without the trade of being fed made him all the more dangerous. All the more tempting. But there Potter sat without an ounce of shame, shifting my centre of gravity once again by saying he wanted to make it a regular appointment. Saying, in effect, that he wanted me — no matter the cost.</p>
  <p>He was still naked on the sofa, relaxed and far too appealing, his cock wet and satiated against his thighs. I shivered looking at him, and his eyes narrowed. He held out a hand and muttered, “<i>Reparo</i>,” and the missing buttons from my shirt came flying up, threading into their proper places and slipping into their buttonholes. The tear near my collar mended with a whisper and the material of my shirt warmed all over. I shivered again at the blanket of heat around me.</p>
  <p>“Thanks,” I croaked. </p>
  <p>“You looked cold.”</p>
  <p>“I’m a vampire, Potter,” I said. “I’m always cold.”</p>
  <p>Potter looked at me for a long moment. </p>
  <p>“Not always,” he murmured.</p>
  <p>Pansy, I decided, would have to get over it.</p>
