    <p>Arcturus Black took slow deep breaths as he walked through the hallways of Hogwarts.</p><p>He stubbornly resisted the urge to lean against his cane. He may be nearing the end of his life but he was still a Lord and more importantly a Black, and he refused to appear weak or frail.</p><p>Arcturus had been told he only had a couple of months to live. The diagnosis had been delivered six months ago, and Arcturus stubbornly continued to fight his illness. He had contracted Dragon Lung a complication of dragon pox. His advanced age, and weaker body made it harder for his magic to fight off the illness. The thought of his death being caused by such a paltry thing was galling. However, it was the thought of leaving his House in the terrible state it was in that truly kept him going.</p><p>For a moment after hearing the news he had simply wanted to allow himself to succumb. The thought of being able to overcome the desolate state of his house seemed an impossible task with the little amount of time he had left. He pushed through though. Arcturus had worked too hard to build up the reputation of his House for it to all fall apart.</p><p>The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black had once been the most powerful, respected, and feared house in all of wizarding Europe. Their names had been on the lips of wizarding kind with fear and respect. They held powerful positions in the Ministry, and had been well known for their magical prowess. They had been unstoppable, their family growing and flourishing.</p><p>Then it all came crumbling down. Arcturus couldn’t pinpoint an exact moment where things all seemed to go wrong. However, it certainly seemed to all lead back to the so-called Dark Lord Voldemort. He had divided the Blacks once strong family connection, and had led to the downfall of several of Arcturus’s family members.</p><p>Voldemort had as good as murdered Arcturus’s grandson Regulus, leading to the death of Arcturus’s only son, Orion. Orion’s only other son Sirius was imprisoned, though Arcturus strongly suspected his innocence. The cousin he was closest with, Pollux, had passed a year prior. His cousin Pollux’s grandchildren also hadn’t escaped the devastation. Bellatrix was imprisoned, and Andromeda had fled their family, turning her backs on them. Narcissa was the only one who came out of the war relatively unscathed.</p><p>The Black family was decimated. The main line destroyed. Or at least Arcturus had believed so.</p><p>When he discovered he only had a few months to live. Arcturus had returned to England in order to access the Black family tree tapestry located in Number 12 Grimmauld Place. The house had been left vacant after the death of his daughter-in-law, Walburga. Arcturus had wanted to scan the tapestry for family members who might be capable of taking up the mantle as the Head of the House of Black when he was gone.</p><p>Arcturus was well aware of Narcissa’s boy. He’d met the boy several times at family functions, and Arcturus was willing to consider him. The boy was a Slytherin, and had done quite well in his first year at Hogwarts. Lucius Malfoy was a scheming snake, and Arcturus was wary of trusting him. He was cunning as was evidenced by the blonde wizard being one of the few Death Eaters to escape the arms of Azkaban despite it being known he was a follower of Voldemort.</p><p>Arcturus hadn’t exactly wanted his house to become subsumed by the Malfoy name, however, it would have been much more preferable to House of Black completely dying out. He knew Malfoy would take care of their investments and seat on the Wizengamot. However, Arcturus had still wanted to see if there were other options available before committing to making Draco Malfoy his heir.</p><p>A thorough look at the tapestry had Arcturus coming to the shocking realization that he had no choice but to entrust his house into Lucius Malfoy’s hands. However, it would not be for the son Malfoy believed.</p><p>Arcturus had discovered quite the scandal on the tapestry. Sirius had borne a son, and to his own shock Lucius Malfoy was the father of that son. Of course that shock could not compare to just who the boy was. Walburga must have known about it. Her hatred of Sirius no doubt influencing her decision to remain silent on the matter, something Arcturus would never forgive her for. If only she had said something sooner than Arcturus could have had years to prepare and pass on valuable Black family secrets. His only great grandson wouldn’t have been raised by muggles.</p><p>Now he would have to rely on Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy to properly educate his heir as his own time was drawing short.</p><p>Arcturus had gone to Lucius Malfoy to apprise him of the situation earlier in the year. The young Malfoy Lord had been stunned to say the least at the discovery, proving he hadn’t had the slightest clue that Sirius had borne him a son.</p><p>Once he had gotten over his shock of it, Lucius had been more than willing to accept Arcturus’s terms. Arcturus had been relatively satisfied that Lucius and Narcissa would properly raise his only great grandson to be a proper Lord for the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black. Lucius shared many of the same values and Narcissa herself had been raised as a Black. She would be able to share their secrets with the boy. The House of Black would continue on now that Lucius would have two sons, and each one would be able to carry on the names of both Houses without the need to combine them.</p><p>The last thing he would do in this life would be to see his great grandson safely into the hands of his father. No matter how much Albus Dumbledore tried to stall him at every turn. Arcturus would have liked to try and overturn Sirius’s conviction as well but sadly he didn’t have the time. It hurt him to know Sirius was rotting in Azkaban especially after going to see his grandson in the prison and the condition Sirius was in. Arcturus was on borrowed time already.</p><p>With Arcturus and Lucius working together Dumbledore could stall no longer.</p><p>The Chief Warlock had managed to put off the testing all summer in the name of not giving away the safe location of the Boy-Who-Lived. Now that Harry Potter was back to Hogwarts there was no reason to not have him officially blood tested.</p><p>Dumbledore had tried to stave it off by claiming he didn’t want to interrupt the boy’s schooling. Arcturus and Lucius had gone to the new Minister of Magic. Fudge had quickly caved, and without the excuse of keeping Harry Potter’s home a secret they had come directly to Hogwarts for the test.</p><p>Arcturus glanced to his left where Lucius and Narcissa walked beside him. Both were impeccably dressed, and showed not an ounce of what they were feeling on their faces just as nobility should.</p><p>In contrast Cornelius Fudge, the new Minister of Magic, looked a wreck. The portly man was sweating in his slightly ill-fitting robes. Arcturus barely contained the sneer from his face. The last of their party was Idess Ives, the Director of Inheritance in the Ministry, she was a no nonsense witch, and Arcturus quite approved of her being the one to conduct the inheritance test. She wouldn’t put up with Dumbledore’s antics.</p><p>Arcturus could feel the eyes of the Hogwarts’s students as they passed. Their group had arrived a half-hour early at his own insistence in hopes of catching Dumbledore off guard, and to keep him from trying to stall once more.</p><p>Minerva McGonagall was the first professor they encountered. The Minister commanded the stern and sensible witch to collect Harry Potter, and to meet them in the Hospital Wing.</p><p>Arcturus allowed himself to feel a moment of triumph as they settled into a private room the mediwitch, Madame Pomfrey, had set up for them. Everything was finally going according to plan. The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black would survive and thrive once more. </p>
