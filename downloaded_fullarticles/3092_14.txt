          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's 1972 and Andromeda has just fallen pregnant with Nymphadora Tonks.</p><p>Andromeda came running into the room squealing. "We're going to have a baby!"</p><p>Ted asked, "Are you absolutely positive?"</p><p>Andromeda beamed, "Yes, I'm pregnant."</p><p>Ted pulled her onto the sofa beside him and pondered, "I bet it's a boy."</p><p>Andromeda said, "Course you think that, but I think it's a girl."</p><p>Ted smiled. "Either way, he or she will be a perfect addition to the family."</p><p>Andromeda stated, "It's all so exciting, isn't it?"</p><p>Ted agreed, "It is."</p><p>Andromeda sighed. "It's crazy to think that a teeny tiny little baby is inside me."</p><p>Ted chuckled. "He or she won't be teeny tiny little for long."</p><p>Andromeda replied, "Yes I know, but it's amazing, isn't it?"</p><p>Ted told her, "Stop worrying darling, it's not good for the baby."</p><p>Andromeda cuddled into Ted and grinned. "I reckon we should start picking baby names now."</p><p>Ted smirked. "But he or she won't be born for a while."</p><p>Andromeda pointed out, "We'll need names at some point."</p><p>Ted gave in, "Okay, okay, let's say Orion for a boy."</p><p>Andromeda added, "And Nymphadora for a girl."</p><p>Ted said, "Nymphadora is a perfect name."</p><p>Andromeda answered, "You're perfect."</p><p>She gave Ted a quick kiss on the lips.</p></div>
