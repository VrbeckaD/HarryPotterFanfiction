    <p>Draco seemed different lately.</p>
<p>Not in a way that Harry had ever seen before.  It wasn't like when he lost a Quidditch match or got a bad grade in Potions.  Usually he would just glare a little more than usual and grasp at every opportunity to humiliate Harry, even more frequently than he normally would.  No, this time was very different.  It wasn't outright noticeable unless you paid close attention to Draco, which Harry was reluctant to admit that he did, but he knew it was the truth.  When Draco knew he was being watched his face always appeared perfectly stoic, his mannerism the same as always, even if it did seem a bit forced at times, even to other people.  But, when he thought no one was looking his eyes would take on a haunted look.  Sometimes he looked so unbelievably sad, at other times his eyes reflected such fear that Harry almost felt scared himself.  Harry noticed other little things as well.  Like when someone would throw a casual arm around Draco's shoulders his eyes would widen in fear and he'd flinch, but it was always gone the next second, so quickly that Harry was sure no one ever noticed.  Well, except for Harry himself of course.  Draco had also developed what looked to be nervous ticks.  He began to bite away at his previously perfectly manicured nails, he scratched at his arms, was almost constantly looking over his shoulder.  Harry knew some people had noticed the change's in Draco, his behavior a little too paranoid, a bit too quiet to go completely unnoticed.  But many people were acting different these days with news of the Dark Lord's return.  If Harry had been anyone else he would have dismissed Draco's behavior as understandable fear and nervousness for the likely upcoming war, but Harry knew Draco better than that.  Harry was almost positive he knew Draco better than anyone, except perhaps Draco's own mother.      </p>
<p>Harry wasn't exactly sure what to do though.  Rationally he kew he shouldn't care, Draco was his rival, the bane of his existence, a never ending thorn in his side.  Harry <em>knew </em>he wasn't supposed to care but he <em>did</em>.  Every time Draco walked by him without insulting him, just glancing at him with those sad eyes and putting his head down, Harry felt his heart ache.  His unusual, and typically unpleasant, interactions with Draco had always made him <em>so angry</em>, but now that they were gone he wanted them back more than anything.  He found himself thinking the one thing he never thought that he'd think, he <em>missed</em> Draco Malfoy.  </p>
<p>So, as Harry stared across the Great Hall during dinner that night, observing the ever darkening circles under Draco's eyes and his withering form, he resolved himself to find out what was wrong with Draco and help put him back together.  Harry knew that whatever it was that was eating away at Draco was going to be something awful, because even though Draco could be somewhat cowardly he definitely had a strong resolve, and nothing small would have broken that.  But Harry knew that he was prepared to deal with whatever was hurting Draco, because even though he vehemently denied it up until now, he cared a great deal for the git and he couldn't stand knowing he was in so much pain and he likely had no one to help him through it.  Harry was going to help Draco no matter what it took, now he just needed to figure out how he was going to get Draco to trust him.  </p>
