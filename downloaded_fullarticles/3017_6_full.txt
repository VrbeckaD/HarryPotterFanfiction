    <p>
  <em>My name is Kelly, I live in the land of Merah Xes. This a region filled with creatures of all shapes and sizes, and it is surrounded by a powerful psychic field keeping it isolated from the rest of the world, not that anyone minds, we all live fine here. But it wasn’t always like that.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> A hundred years ago, the males and females of our land were at war to determine who is stronger. However, that changed when the Master Council came to power. They brought peace to the land and developed the Master/Slave system. The Master/Slave system is a set of laws that make it legal to obtain beings as loyal slaves. In order to be accepted into the Master/Slave System, one must registered as either a Master or a Slave.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> Masters are normally those with strong and dominant personalities. Those who desire to be great and have the strength to prove it more often become Masters. It is also a matter of money, but it is mostly based on the being’s internal and external strength. There is of course other requirements to be a Master, mostly being able to provide good care for these slaves. Those that pass are given a special personalized item called the Masters Charm, a small item most often worn around the neck with a rainbow colored crystal in the center. These charms are locked with the Master’s DNA.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> As for Slaves, they serve their masters in many different forms. Most of the time, they are beings that desire to have a strong Master, and in turn omit themselves to becoming the slaves of these Masters. Slaves come in three variations – Originals, Replicas, and Customs. All Slaves wear collars with a pendant that is the same shape and color as their Master’s, but lacks the rainbow-colored gem in the center.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> Originals are just as they are called, the Original. They are the beings that were registered when they became either a Master or Slave. All Masters are Originals. Originals that become slaves are sold in glass displays where Masters would come in and buy them. Unlike Replicas, they cannot be modified as easily, so not many folks choose to obtain the Originals and instead go straight for the Replicas. They are also much more expensive to buy. However, unlike Replicas or Customs, they are the only ones that can have children with their Masters without the use of external items All of those registered under the Master/Slave System can have Replicas created of them, be they Master or Slave.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> Replicas are cloned versions of the Originals but they can have a plethora of variations. Ranging from physical features such as eye color all the way to Species, personalities, and even abilities, Replicas can be modified and sold in all sorts of ways. Their DNA is stored into small figurines which Masters can buy and using a special program, create their own perfect slave. Due to the easy production of Replicas, they are much cheaper and more sought out after. However, not all Replicas remain wanted.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> Customs are Replicas that have been sold off by their Original Master. Because of this, they lose the ability to be easily modified and are treated much more like Originals. However, they are still cheaper than Originals and in turn more sought after since while one person may not like their slave any more, another could. However, because since they are still also Replicas, Customs cannot have children with their Masters without the use of special, extremely expensive, pills.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> There is no limit to the number of slaves a person can obtain, however it all depends on how many they can afford care for. Mistreated or unhappy slaves have the right to report their Masters to the authorities. If the Master is found guilty of severe mistreatment or endangerment to their slaves, they will be arrested and the slaves will be either go to other Masters, put in Slave stores to be sold, or taken in by another Master that helped them. As for the arrested Masters, more often than not they are trained into being slaves themselves.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> Slaves are used for a variety of uses, the most common being either for work or for sex. However, another use for the slaves is for the Masters Tourney. The Masters Tourney was set where Masters and their slaves compete in a variety of challenges and competitions called Slave Clashes. The winner of each Slave Clash receives two prizes, a new slave and a special Emblem. Gathering 10 emblems allows for a Master to enter in the Master’s Tournament. This is the ultimate clash between Masters and their slaves. The winners of this tournament get a mysterious prize, one that the general public is left unaware about.</em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> I am a Master and have thought about entering the tournament, but at the moment, I am happy with my life.</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>A massive white castle stood over a lush garden and a wall of barracks as the sun rose beyond the cliff setting everything ablaze with golden light as the warm beams beaconed everything they touched to awaken.</p><p>In a large bedroom a king size bed sat draped in gold, silver, white and black silk sheets laid a male, sound asleep as his chest rose and fell with each breath he took. The black sheet pooled around him exposing his bare chest.</p><p>The door to the room cracked open slowly admitting another male into the room. Walking into the room, is a boy who is short in stature. His skin is tanned, and he has a faint, perpetual blush and freckles on his cheeks. His hair is an unkempt umber with green undertones, and his eyes are hazel, the main iris being forest green, with accents of burnt orange and yellow around the pupil. Another feature about him was the fact he was naked, not a single article of clothing on his body save for a black collar around his neck with a silver charm.</p><p>The boy walked towards the bed and placed his hand on the males chest. “Master, Master Kelly it's time to wake up.” He said trying to shake the male named Kelly awake.</p><p>Stretching his arms Kelly let out a jaw-splitting yawn as he swung around so his legs were on the edge of the bed, looking up he saw the bare form of Oscar, one of his more expensive purchases but when you had a fortune that never shrank price was no matter he supposed.</p><p>“I’m glad to see your awake Master.” Smiled Oscar, his blush making his smile look all the more adorable. “As you requested, I came to wake you up as you asked.”</p><p>“Is everyone gathered for breakfast?” Kelly asked standing up his morning wood bobbing in the air as he did so.</p><p>Oscar’s eyes trailed down his master’s body, no matter how many times he had seen him naked, walked into his room to wake him for breakfast, or the few times he had walked in on him bathing, he could never get tired of looking at it. “Of course master.” Smiled Oscar. “Everyone is gathered just as you asked and waiting for you.”</p><p>“Then let's go,” Kelly said strolling out of the room his hard cock pointing the way as he moved to the dining room closest to his throne room. As he entered the room his eyes surveyed his four other slaves each waiting patiently on him.</p><p>The first one sitting closest to the floor was a blonde young man sitting on his hands and knees. This was Kelly’s official pet Jaune Arc. He had a light lean build and very light skin. What made him stand out from the other slaves, however, was the set of black leather bondage that was strapped around his chest, crotch, and biceps. The leather wrapped tightly around his lean frame and was adorned with small white rubber spikes. His wrists and ankles were cuffed together by red shackles connected by silver chains, and covering his mouth was a mask that resembled the snout of what could be described as a demon dog that kept him muzzled. He also had a set of short black dog ears sticking out of the top of shaggy blonde hair, and like Oscar also sported a black collar with a silver crown charm. His azure blue eyes shimmered with excitement as he spotted his master, shaking his plump rear like it were a tail. He sported a large red pulsing 8-inch cock that was kept hard thanks to the silver ring that kept it like that, and a pair of swollen orange-sized balls. “Woof! Woof!” Jaune barked through the muzzled while he continued to shake his ass like the loyal dog he was.</p><p>Leaning against the wall was Kelly’s Nanite-filled slave Rex Salazar. Rex was about the same age as Jaune, standing fully upright with a confident grin on his face. He had a lean muscular build with well-defined muscles. He sported a head of short spiked black hair and brown eyes. A pair of perky brown nipples sat on his toned pecs, under them a hard set of six-pack abs, and hanging at full attention was an impressive 9-inch long shaft that seemed to already be leaking pre. Coursing across his body like veins were light blue lines, signs of his Nanite-filled bloodstream, all the way to his hard dick. Like Oscar, he wore nothing but the black collar with the silver pendant, as well as a pair of orange goggles. “Hey boss, good to see you’re up,” Rex said with a teasing salute.</p><p>“Course he’s up.” Came a voice from another seat down along the table. “And as we all know, when he’s up were all up~” The person speaking was a male, this was Kelly’s half human-half Devil slave Dante Sparda. Unlike the others before him, Dante was physically the oldest of Kelly’s slave, cocky grin on his face his feet kicked up on his corner of the table. He had shockingly white hair that is somewhat parted with his bangs brushed down with his bangs partially covering his eyes, which are a shocking crystal blue color-a trait he got from his mother. His physical appearance is what made him desirable when it came to being sold, as he has very angular and strong features and sharp cheekbones. He is a tall muscular male, having been hunting demons for most of his life had left him with the perfect chiseled and ripped body, a solid eight-pack of abs leading up to a pair of pecs that he loved to make pop for his master when he got the chance. The one thing that stuck out the most, however, was the fact that resting between his legs was not one, but two thick 12-inch cocks. “Sides, you love it when he’s up Rexy~” Dante said with a wink towards the dark haired teen.</p><p>“And like you don’t triple D,” Rex replied with his own saucy smirk.</p><p>Kelly chuckled at the banter as he moved to take his seat his eyes passing over the newest slave to join their family.</p><p>Sitting shyly in his seat eye’s downcast as he adjusted his glasses, was Kelly’s newest slave Harry Potter. Harry had been the latest of Kelly’s purchases of slaves, he was a small teen almost the smallest among the rest of Kelly’s slaves. He wasn’t as muscular as Dante, or Rex or Jaune or even Oscar, as Harry was lean with a somewhat athletic figure, he had a head full of messy dark black locks that seemed almost impossible to tame-and they had all tried but it seemed like Harry’s hair refused to be tamed- behind a pair of glasses Harry’s eyes were a beautiful shade of deep emerald green that seems to shine with so much emotion in them that anyone would lose themselves with in those emerald orbs. He didn’t expose himself like everyone else as he sat with his chair pulled up to hide his lower half but his upper half was exposed showing off his perky dusty pink nipples, and below the table, he crossed his legs to keep his 6 incher from being seen should someone peek under the table.</p><p>Making his plate Kelly let out a sharp whistle, calling Jaune to him as he asked: “Has Jaune had his morning treat yet”.</p><p>Dante hummed, rapping his finger’s against his chin. “If I remember, it was Rexy here who was to feed our resident pup.”</p><p>“What?! No way dude, it was your turn!” Rex said, his smirk turning into a snarl.</p><p>“Woof! Woof!” Jaune barked shaking his head. He pointed the snout of his muzzle at Rex. He looked back at his master with pleading puppy eyes and let out a small whimper. “Hmmm.”</p><p>“Well, It seems that answers that question doesn’t it Rexy.” Smirked Dante like the cat who ate the canary. “After all, the dog never lies.”</p><p>“Well then I guess I have to punish you Rex after I feed Jaune” Kelly said moving his chair back and spreading his legs letting his cock point up.</p><p>“Arf! Arf!” Jaune barked happily, excited to get his favorite meal. He quickly crawled over towards his master despite the chains until he was snout to face with his master’s hard shaft. Once he was close, the nose of the muzzle muzzle lit up and it split apart, revealing Jaune’s normal human mouth and nose. His tongue was hanging out and drooling like a dogs and he licked his lips as he got closer to his master’s crotch. However, before he got close, he stopped and looked up at his master, silently asking him if it was truly okay for him to eat.</p><p>Reaching down Kelly ruffled Jaune’s hair and said “Go ahead boy” while turning to Rex and thinking about who to use for the punishment, “Harry I have a task for you” Kelly said holding back a moan as Jaune eagerly sucked him off.</p><p>“Hmm! Hmm!” Jaune happily moaned as he sucked on his favorite bone. Using his tongue he lapped around his master’s meat, savoring the tasty musk. He went down to the base, licking and sucking all around as he made his way to the head. Jaune opened his mouth, slowly taking in every inch of his master’s tool into it.</p><p>“Ah” Harry said coming to attention as he adjusted his glasses that had slid down his nose. “Yes?..Master?”</p><p>“I want you to top Rex as his punishment, you get to fuck him and cum in him but he can not cum for the rest of the day” Kelly said smirking at the Latin teen.</p><p>“W-What?” Harry asked his face turning as red as cherry, he fidgets in place hands flying down to cover his cock.</p><p>“W-Wait Boss, what?” Rex said, nervously. “I-I mean don’t get me wrong, I’ll gladly ride the newbie, b-but can’t we talk about the no cumming thing?” Kelly’s flat expression while Jaune continued to suck him off told Rex there was no talking about it. Making him gulp while Dante let out a chuckle.</p><p>“Someone’s in trouble~” Smirked Dante as he leaned back in his seat arms resting behind his head. “You heard the boss man, Rexy you gotta let the newbie ride your ass.” He said eyes gleaming. “This is gonna be one good show, I just know it.”</p><p>Rex growled but turned to Harry who was still standing shyly. He turned back to his master who kept the flat look before letting out a defeated sigh. He walked to in front of Harry, making him pause before turned around, bending over, spreading his ass and exposing his entrance to the young wizard boy. Harry blinked in surprise while Rex looked back at him. “Come on dude. You heard the boss, give it to me. Show us you got some backbone.”</p><p>“B-But! I-I!” Harry was stammering over his words, his face was still red, but his body betrayed him as while Harry had never had sex, he had thought about oh how he had. But, now here in reality he wasn’t sure what to do let alone how to actually do it. Dante snickered seeing that Harry was literally a blushing virgin.</p><p>“Oh, Kid.” He snickered under his breath as he saw Harry try to speak, only for it to seem like he had swallowed his own tongue. “If it wasn’t breakfast I would have a bag of popcorn, cause this is better than anything I’ve ever seen.” He paused. “Well, almost anything I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“Shut it twin-dicks,” Rex growled. “Come on magic boy. Give it! You heard the boss. Just shove your little wand in me and make me a blithering slut. If you can’t do that then...”</p><p>Harry flushed brightly at Rex’s words, his ears burning to the point that Dante would swear on his two dicks he saw literal steam coming out of his ears. “I-I can.” Harry said standing up from his chair, as soon as he did his hard throbbing thick 8-incher. “I can do this.” He said again, mostly to himself. “Uh, s-s-shouldn’t you..er be prepared?” He asked, his face if it was possible got even more red than it already was.</p><p>“Heh, I think I’ll be fine,” Rex said, underestimating the hidden potential of the boy who lived.</p><p>Harry nodded, licking his lips placing both his on Rex’s hips he lined his cock up with his hole. ‘You can do it Harry.’ he thought to himself as he steeled his resolve. ‘Just line right, pull you hips back and push!’ With a mental shout he buried his 8-incher inside of Rex’s ass in a single thrust, letting out a small moan feeling the tan teens walls clench around his cock upon entering. “Merlin.” He gasped softly.</p><p>Kelly let out a moan burying his hand in the blond locks and thrusting into Jaune’s mouth as he watched the show.</p><p>‘Mmm…~Master~’ Jaune thought to himself happily as his sucked while his master thrusted his hips into his mouth. He was savoring the taste of his master’s pre and was desperately hungry for the main course soon to come.</p><p>“F-Fuck~” Rex said as he felt Harry’s shaft push itself into his tight hole. He knew the wizard boy was a good size, almost the same as his and his master, but he really should have considered prepping.</p><p>Harry was still, his mind trying to catch up with what he had done. When it did, he felt embarrassed, here he was literally having sex in front of the others and all for a punishment. While a part of him wanted to pull out, another part of him the part of him he had never listened to said otherwise, and before he knew it he was thrusting into Rex’s ass once again.</p><p>To Harry, Rex’s ass felt like heaven it was hot, warm, and felt oh so good around his cock feeling like velvet as it hugged his throbbing member each time he pulled out he slammed back in eager to bury his cock inside of Rex’s ass, each thrust had the walls of Rex’s ass grip his cock upon entering. Harry soon had a steady rhythm going, and once he did he didn’t stop he kept going and going, letting the sound of skin slapping skin resound off the walls of the dining room. “Whoo! That’s the spirit kid! Get in there! Lay into him and show Rexy’s who’s boss!” Cheered Dante, his words only encouraging Harry to go faster and Harder.</p><p>Kelly groaned his cock unloading a fresh hot batch of cum down Jaune’s throat as he gently rubbed the puppy’s head.</p><p>“HMM!” Jaune moaned as he felt his master’s seed flow down his throat and into his aching stomach. He happily guzzled every ounce down. The sheer pleasure of his master’s tasty cum would have been enough to make him cum himself, but the cock ring kept him from doing so, and good puppies did not cum until their master told them to.</p><p>“Gah! Fuck! AH!” Rex kept groaning and exclaiming. He didn’t think the kid with the lightning bolt mark had it in him, but he was actually fucking him hard and good now. The wizard’s fast and hard thrusting was slamming against his prostate with fast repetitive thrusts, driving his mind mad. He tried to reach for his own cock to pump himself, but Oscar was holding said hands in place so that Rex could not touch himself.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah.” Oscar said smiling at Rex-but the teen could see the joy and pleasure the smaller teen was getting from stopping him from touching his cock. “You heard what Master said.” He said, but it sounded more like a purr as he chuckled. “It wouldn’t be a punishment if you came now would it?” His smile seemed innocent enough, but Rex would swear he saw a devil’s tail waving behind the teen. Oscar, turned to look at Harry. “Go on Harry, you can go even harder he can take it.”</p><p>Harry looked up at Oscar, showing the only sign that he had heard him was a nod of his head. His grip on Rex’s hips tightened, slightly digging his nails into his skin as he went faster and faster, bending over to practically be on top of Rex’s back as he slammed into him from behind. “F-Fuck, soo good.” He moaned in bliss</p><p>Kelly smirked as he saw how horny the other’s were but he wanted to wait till the show was over before issuing more orders.</p><p>Once Jaune was done licking his master’s cock clean of any remaining cum, he slurped and licked his lips, happy for the meal he had received. As he pulled away from his master’s crotch, the nose of his muzzle lit up again and the sides closed up once more, covering the blonde’s mouth once more. “Bark! Bark!” he woofed, wagging his happy rump at having gotten his breakfast.</p><p>“Nga! Fuck! Gah!” Rex kept on crying out as Harry plowed his ass to town without remorse. He had lost hold of his hands and had fallen onto his chest, letting the black-haired boy thrust even harder and deeper into his rear. Oscar kept his hands from reach down with that false-innocent smile on his face, making sure that Rex could not cum. The nanite-infused male felt like he was going to go mad if he could not cum and/or from the newbie’s instense jackhammering of his arse. He wasn’t sure which would cause it first. He couldn’t even growl at Dante who just continued to howl at the scene.</p><p>“Oh man this is rich!” Dante chuckled like a hyena. “You had this coming Rexy~” Howled Dante as he slapped the arm of his chair. “You underestimate the kid and now you're paying for it!” He had his chair tiled back as he laughed loudly. “Oh man, you gotta be going nuts! I mean unable to cum! You so had this coming! Oh wait.” Dante paused and then laughed at his own bad pun. Harry didn’t hear Dante, all he could hear were the sounds of his thrust, he felt the skin slapping against skin, and his cock being hugged by Rex’s warm, tight ass, his emerald green eyes shined with lust and desire as he lost himself. He was drowning, drowning in a never ending abyss of pleasure and he loved it.</p><p>Standing up Kelly moved behind Harry and tilted the smaller teens head up giving him a searing hot kiss and mapping his mouth with his tongue.</p><p>Harry’s eyes fluttered shut, the sensation of pleasure from the kiss and Rex’s ass was slowly pushing him towards the edge, his body was singing in pleasure and he wanted to fall deeper into the abyss to be completely submerged so deep he never had to leave. He whimpered into Kelly’s mouth, his own tongue tracing along his lips as he shyly let Kelly’s tongue into his mouth and moved around, while his own tongue explored Kelly’s mouth as he slowly felt his first ever climax approaching his thrust getting more wild and harder as he was desperate to make the pleasure last even longer.</p><p>“Go ahead and fill him up then we will get you a reward” Kelly whispered into Harry’s ear.</p><p>Harry’s eyes widen, his hips jerked as he slammed into Rex’s ass one last time before he came undone and he came. With a loud long drawn out moan, streams of thick hot cum spray from Harry’s cock. Each shot of cum hit Rex’s prostate, staining his insides white, with every shot Harry melted a little more until he was a puddle of pants, moans, and whines as his first intense climax washed over him, as he relaxed against Rex hips thrusting lightly as he rode out his orgasm.</p><p>Rex made no sound as he gaped and felt Harry’s surging seed fill him like a geyser with a large balloon tied to the hole. His stomach expanded from the surprisingly intense and large load the wizard by had unleashed. He would have cum right then and there, but Oscar with his sadistic little smile had gripped the base of his cock, preventing the darker-skinned teen from reaching his own climax and simply whimper. His mind was a little clearer, so he could hear Dante’s howling laughter and even heard Jaune snickering through the muzzle like a familiar cartoon dog.</p><p>“Hot, Hot, hot!” Dante whooted as he clapped his hands. “God damn, who would have known you had it in you kid!” He said smiling. “Well, I think Rexy now knows you had it in you cause now its in him!” Crackled Dante.</p><p>“Indeed.” Smiled Oscar with his smile still in place. “You did amazing Harry, seeing as how this was your first time that is saying something.” he said tightening his grip on the base of Rex’s cock.</p><p>“Bark! Bark!” Jaune said in agreement, rubbing his golden hair against the wizard boy’s leg affectionately, while also taking moments to snicker more at Rex. ‘That’s what you get for not feeding me! Though, I did get a great breakfast anyways.’</p><p>“Very good Harry now about that reward, I want you to pick it can be a pet for yourself, something for your room, a new slave in particular, a new toy, a meal or anything of the like” Kelly said pulling Harry into his chest. “So Harry what will it be?” Kelly asked as he tilted the smallest males head up.</p><p>Harry laid against Kelly’s chest, slowly coming down from his pleasurable high. His mind starting to clear up, as he moaned softly. “A-a friend? A friend of my own?” he asked. “Can i..can i have a friend of my own?”</p><p>“Of course My little wizard, did you have a friend while you were in the Market?” Kelly asked as he stood there.</p><p>“I did.” Harry said pressing his cheek against Kelly’s chest. “He was, um he was a naga I think we would spend days talking to each other about what we would do if we got bought by the same person...but when i got sold he didn’t..I-I.” Harry’s green eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>Calming him Kelly said “We will go to the Market right now, Dante gather a large sack of money enough for five originals out of the vault, Oscar take Harry to get dressed, Rex look after Jaune” Kelly said moving to the doors to get dressed.</p><p>Oscar nodded smiling, “Of course Master, come along Harry.” Oscar said leading Harry back to his room to get him dressed. Dante nodded back flipping off his chair he landed in a squat. “I’ll get it done boss man.” He said giving him a two finger salute, shooting Rex a smile he turned and made towards the treasury to get the money they needed. For his part, Rex couldn’t really keep an eye on Jaune since he was still in a “fucked-stupid” state, but Jaune loyaly remained in place and kept an eye on Rex, especially making sure that if he did regain his senses he did not try to cum without their master's orders.</p><p>Kelly quickly slipped on his clothes, a White leather Trench coat with gold angel wings, black jeans, a grey shirt and black shoes before heading to the front Door of the castle, arriving outside, Kelly focused his power rising a crystal throne out of the ground with a second seat on the arm as he sat down waiting on Dante, and Harry his hand fingering his master charm a diamond crown shaped pendant.</p><p>“Got the cash boss!” Dante said walking out, five bags of gold-two under his arms and the third he was balancing on his head. “Was pretty easy to get.” Just then Oscar and Harry came out, with Harry being dressed. “As you requested Master, he is dressed and ready to go.”</p><p>“Woof! Woof!” Kelly heard Jaune bark. He turned and saw Jaune carrying the still dazed Rex on his back as well as the remaining two bags of gold. Jaune dropped the bags and Rex onto the ground, which caused the dazed teen to groan but nothing else. Kelly simply chuckled and petted Jaune.</p><p>“Good” Kelly said snapping his fingers making the bags combine into a single one that shrunk down to where it fit in his pocket.</p><p>“We’re really going to get him?” Harry asked as he and Oscar moved over to stand near Kelly. “I’ll get to see him again?”</p><p>“Of course” Kelly said smiling at Harry and sitting him on the arm of the throne as it started to rise into the air and move away from the castle the wind not as bad as Harry expected.</p><p>“H-How is this possible?” Harry gaped in shock and awe, “I-I’ve seen a lot of things, but I’ve never anything like this.” He had flown on a broom before, but this blew it right out the water.</p><p>“It is because of my power.” Kelly said explaining how the throne was flying as they made their way across the land.</p><p>“That’s amazing.” Harry said in shock, the fact that the man who had bought him-His Master his mind whispered- was this powerful was something he couldn’t believe. “How can anyone have that much power?”</p><p>“Power is earned my dear but take a look down there, we are here already” Kelly said smiling at Harry.</p><p>Harry followed his master’s gaze and gasped, there before them was the place he had been found in, the place he had met his friend, and then place they had been separated.</p><p>Down below them was a massive square-shaped two-story building with a large parking lot in front. The building was shiny grey with large window all across the the second story and several different satellites and devices sitting on the top. At the center of the top of the front of the building was a large red sign that said the words “Masters Market” in bright gold neon light. As they landed, they saw the entrance was a pair of automatic heart-shaped doors. All around they could see several masters and slaves coming in and out of the building. This was the Master’s number one place to buy, sell, and trade slaves.</p><p>The throne landed outside the building and Kelly stood saying “Come along and I will buy you a Cum Shake” as he started towards the doors.</p><p>Harry stood on shaky legs, nervous about being back in this place. “Uh...don't you mean milk shake?” Even if he had never had one, Harry was pretty sure that it was supposed to be Milkshakes.</p><p>“Normally, you would be right but here they sell Milkshakes made of cum, muscle milk and flavoring” Kelly said as they entered the building.</p><p>“O-Oh.” Harry said flushing brightly. “Uh...h-how do they flavor it?” he asked confused on how cum could have a flavor.</p><p>“I am not sure but I know Dante loves the strawberry shake” Kelly said as he saw the first of the originals it was a large muscular male with a thick cut body, that had scars littering his body, he was in a glass case putting him on display for all to see with a sheet stating his stats at the bottom and his price. His arms and legs were chained to the base to prevent movement, and an electric collar rested on his neck as he scowled at the outside.</p><p>“Somehow that doesn’t surprise me.” Said Harry looking around at all the other slaves that were waiting to be bought, some giving him envious looks and some looks that said they wanted to be in his place.</p><p>Moving to one of the workers Kelly said “I am here to purchase a certain slave. It is a male Naga” pausing Kelly turned and asked “Harry what was your friend’s name?”</p><p>“A-aladdin, his name is Aladdin.” Said Harry looking around for his friend, hoping that he wasn’t already sold.</p><p>“Aladdin, either bring him here or if he has been sold I want the name of his master” Kelly said as he stood before the worker.</p><p>“A Naga named Aladdin? I’ll check real quick sir,” the worker said as he pulled out a tablet and began to scroll through it. “Hmm...Ah! Here he is. Oh dear. It looks like the managers have decided to put him up for auction. A rare sight for customs like this one, but then again I guess the fact that Naga-styled Customs are a rarity to see, it makes sense. The auction is being held up on the second floor sir.”</p><p>“Come along Harry we have to go get your friend” Kelly said heading towards the stairs determination in his eyes as he moved his hand touching the bag of gold.</p><p>“We’re going to get him right?” Harry asked as they moved towards the second floor. “We’re going to get him before he’s been sold?”</p><p>“Of course I planned to contact his master if he was sold and ask the price to buy him” Kelly said as they arrived at the Auction sight and saw the Naga in center stage and a Manager near him, moving forward Kelly approached the manager and called him to him.</p><p>“And the bid is currently 5,000 munny. Repeat the current bid is 5,000 munny. Anyone bid higher? Anyone?” the manager/auctioneer declared as he gestured to the Naga next to him.</p><p>The Naga in question was an young man with his body from his waist up consisting of a lean muscular frame. Not too bulky, but not skinny either with deep tan skin and strong firm muscles. He sported a short mane of raven black shaggy hair and chocolate brown eyes that matched the colors of his nipples. From the waist down all that existed was a thick 10 ft long white scaly serpent’s tail that coiled around him as he sat on the stage. The only article he had on him was a black collar connected to a leash that the manager held in his hand.</p><p>“I bid 25,000 munny” Kelly said drawing all attention to him, at the amount of gold he was willing to spend.</p><p>“I-I-I-I-I…” the manager stammered, trying to make sense at what he just heard. Next to him the naga was in equal disbelief. “I-I-I” he slapped himself back to sense. “I’m sorry sir, b-but did you say t-t-t-25,000 munny?”</p><p>“Yes, so unless someone else wishes to bid more I would like you to say I win and hand over my Harry’s friend” Kelly said placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder bringing him to Aladdin’s attention.</p><p>“H-Harry?” Aladdin said in disbelief as he stared at the wizard boy, shocked to see him back at the market. “I-Is that really you? What are you doing here?”</p><p>“A-aladdin.”Harry breathed out a tearful smile. “W-we came to get you, K-My master he asked me if there was something I wanted.” He flushed. “I-I told him I wanted you to be with me.”</p><p>“So I came right away and I will be taking you with me” Kelly said turning his eyes to the Auctioneer.</p><p>The auctioneer stared at the large bag of munny Kelly had left. He looked around, but saw most of the buyers had all left once they heard the massive bid. Shrugging, he slammed his hammer onto the auction desk and said, “Sold. Here you go sir, your new slave,” the auctioneer handed the leash to Kelly. “I’ll just get the paperwork and we’ll finalize it all quick.” He attempted to take the sack of cash with him, but it’s heavy weight prevented the initial try. He spat in his hands before slowly dragging the sack away, leaving Kelly with his two newest slaves.</p><p>“Go ahead I know you two want to hug and chat, Harry explain the rules of the castle and about everyone else” Kelly said as another worker ran in with the paperwork.</p><p>“Wait..castle? You live in a castle?” Aladdin said in disbelief.</p><p>“Y-Yeah, trust me Aladdin my life has changed since i was bought.” Harry said with a slight pink in his cheeks. “I’ve met my master, and his other slaves they are all a little strange, but they are nice people! I am sure we’ll get along.”</p><p>“Well… if you say so Harry,” Aladdin said with a shrug before smiling. “I’m just glad to see you again. And I’m really glad we both got the same master. Seriously, before you guys showed up, there was a buyer that kept calling me a ‘street snake’. Really got my scales rattled, and I’m not even a rattlesnake-type Naga!” the joke caused Harry to snort and chuckle, which made Aladdin smile wider.</p><p>“I really did miss you Aladdin.” Smiled Harry. “Well, you and your jokes, they always made me laugh.” He said, as Aladdin smiled himself seeing Harry smile always made the Naga happy. “But, I should explain the concepts of My master’s castle and the others.” He said, as he began to tell Aladdin all about the castle and the other servants that lived with them.</p><p>Kelly made short work of the paperwork but kept making like he was busy as he smiled while listening to the conversation between the two.</p><p>“Thank you sir, that should be about it,” the worker said as he took the completed paperwork before handing Kelly a small booklet. “And here is the Slave Guide to your newly purchased slave. All the information about him since his creation is in there. Enjoy.” The worker waved before walking away. “Alright boys! Take ten then we’ll set up for the next auction!”</p><p>“How would you two like a cum-shake before we head home” Kelly asked smiling at Aladdin as he approached, pulling out a charm and placing it on the collar around the Naga’s neck.</p><p>“Thanks...Master,” Aladdin said, smiling at his new owner. Kelly noticed that the tip of Aladdin’s tail was wagging, similar to how Jaune would shake his rear to indicate he was happy. “I’ve seen people walk around with cum-shakes, but never had one myself. Slaves waiting to be purchased aren’t allowed.”</p><p>“Well then let's go get shakes then we can leave” Kelly said leading the way back downstairs to the stall selling shakes and stopping at the list of flavors he ordered his, “I want one fusion shake made with Death by chocolate, Peach, Strawberry and Cookies and Cream. What flavors do you two want?”</p><p>“Hmm...guess I’ll try a Mango and Orange combo?” Aladdin said.</p><p>Harry looked over the combos and bit his lip. “I-I’ll try the Chocolate Strawberry combo.”</p><p>Placing the order it only took a few minutes for three cups to be handed to Kelly which he passed the two slaves their shakes and took a sip of his own paying and making his way out of the market to where he left the crystal throne.</p><p>Harry looked at his smoothie, licking his lips as he thought to himself. ‘Over the lips, through the gums, look out stomach here it comes.’ He thought before taking a sip, as soon as the first few drops touched his tongue Harry’s eyes widen, as an explosion of flavors hit his tongue. He moaned hotly, cheeks burning, legs almost buckling under him. ‘T-This f-flavor! The chocolate and strawberries compliment each other so well! Merlin! It's so good!’ His cock throbbed in his pants, rubbing against the fabric of his clothes as he tried to keep himself upright. He took another sip moaning, his cock twitched and throbbed as pre oozed from the slit staining the crotch of his clothes with pre which only got darker as he drank more and more.</p><p>Complete unaware of Harry’s current state of bliss, Aladdin looked at his own smoothie with interest. ‘Well...can’t be that bad if Harry’s willing to give it a try.’ he thought before bringing the straw to his lips and taking a sip. The second he did, his eyes went wide as he experienced his own flavorful explosion. He let out an elated groan, his cheeks blushed, the end of his long white tail curling up and twisting. ‘H-Holy Ala! T-This is amazing! S-So Fruity! I-I didn’t think mangos and orange could taste so amazing together!’. From just under were his human and snake parts met, a large slit made itself known as a pair of thick rigid 10 inch cocks poked their way out and stood up to full attention, bobbing against each other while Aladdin did his best to keep himself onto the chair. A light trail of pre fell down from the top cock down onto the bottom one that leak just as much, creating a small puddle on the base of the throne as he drank more.</p><p>Soon the trio was on their way back to the castle the two slaves happily chatting until the throne landed and sunk back into the ground. “Welcome Aladdin to my home” Kelly said waving his hand at the massive castle that was bigger than anything Aladdin had ever seen.</p><p>“H-Holy Ala,” Aladdin said in awe, and arousal from the shake, at the massive castle that was now his home. “You guys live here? How the heck can you afford this?”</p><p>“I will show you the treasury later for now we better see what the others are up to,” Kelly said opening the door.</p><p>Inside of the castle, Oscar was standing there waiting for them. “Welcome Home, Master.” Smiled Oscar as he bowed to them. “I take it this is our new house guest?”</p><p>“H-Hey, I’m Aladdin,” the naga said. He would have waved had he not been still holding his smoothie in one hand and trying to cover his twin-cocks with the other. It was a failing on the later.</p><p>Oscar smiled at him, “Aladdin, I am Oscar one of the first to be bought by our Master, as such I welcome you to our humble abode.” he said with another bow. “I look forward to living with you.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Aladdin said with a smile, already liking his fellow servant.</p><p>“Where are the other’s Oscar?” Kelly asked feeling like he was going to have a headache in a moment when he heard the answer.</p><p>Oscar’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second. “Rex and Dante are….well Dante continued to make jokes about how Rex wasn’t aloud to cum and Rex being Rex got mad and well-” The castle shook and was followed by the sound of Rex screaming profanities and the sound of Dante’s laughter in the air and then another explosion. “You can guess what happened Next.”</p><p>“Yipe!” everyone heard. They turned and saw Jaune cowering under a table with his hands covering his eyes and his butt shivering in the air.</p><p>Kelly sighed and repeated “Welcome to your new Home Aladdin”</p>
