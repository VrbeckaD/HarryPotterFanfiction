    <p>“It’s for the best”, Hermione said, swallowing her tears.<br/>
Draco stared at the floor, and nodded forcibly, refusing to look anywhere but his shoes.<br/>
She slowly raised her hand to cup his cheek, gently running her thumb along the hard lines of his jaw and cheekbones, feeling goosebumps rise along his skin. Reluctantly, he leaned his head into her palm and kissed it, basking in her soft touch, the smell of parchment on her skin, the slight taste of ink lingering on his lips.  He held onto these final moments as long as he could. A chill went up his spine as he drew his eyes from the ground to met hers, soft, kind, determined, strong.<br/>
With a sigh, they pulled away and faced each other, raising their wands, both shaking.<br/>
As they drew in a breath, Draco watched as Hermione became undone, the moment before the word escaped both their lips.  Her voice weak as she gripped her stomach and allowed her tears to rush down her perfectly rosy cheeks.  Watching this brilliant, clever, revolutionary witch before him succumb to her emotions, he had never known such hopelessness and pain.  Yet, he would stay strong, for them both, so she didn't have to be.<br/>
“Obliviate,” they spoke in unison.<br/>
They stood there, wands pointing at each other, gasping as if coming up for air.  Such a daze rolled over them as confusion settled and they took in the image before them.<br/>
Hermione stiffened, wiping her face with one hand while moving her grip down her wand tightly, ready to defend herself.<br/>
“Wh-What do you think you are doing here?!”<br/>
Draco mirrored her stance in response. “ME!? You are the one ready to curse me you filthy mudblood!”<br/>
“Oh, of course I would. Brilliant conclusion, not that the situation seems to present itself as one in which I maybe defending myself from a racist pureblood who has apparently followed me into the girl's bathroom!” She spat, her voice cracking feeling as though there were still tears to be shed.  Shifting her weight from one foot to the other, ready to fire a counter spell any moment, she looked him up and down.  Something was...off. Though she didn’t feel as if she were in danger, logic dictated that she could not let her guard down. “You disgust me Malfoy.”<br/>
He looked around, only realizing where he was in that moment. His eyes darted as he licked his lips, unsure of what was going on. He seemed to have done exactly as she assumed though he does not recall any desire to do so.  What would cause him to be here, now, with...her!?<br/>
Realizing he was losing his composure, he stiffened his spine, raised his chin and straightened his tie before sheathing his wand.”Trust me, whatever brought me here, it was a mistake.”<br/>
The words echoed inside of him as he exited, and he knew them to be the most truthful thing he had uttered between them.</p><p>~•~•~•~•~</p><p>Draco’s words were the last he spoke to her in a week. Over and over, she tried to just forget everything but something felt wrong. He hadn’t called her Mudblood or even snarled ‘Granger’ under his breathe when they passed in the halls. In fact, he seemed to be elsewhere entirely in his mind. As strange as this seemed, no one else, not even Malfoy's friends, seemed to care.  It was like she was the only one in a room full of string instruments who noticed the completely off tune sound of an oboe screeching.<br/>
She hadn’t really been paying attention to Ron and Harry’s conversation when she interrupted.<br/>
“Have either of you noticed Malfoy...behaving strangely this past week?” She inquired, with narrow eyes fixed on the Slytherin table.<br/>
Both boys stopped speaking as they faced her, hands floating above the table. For a moment neither spoke and just shifted their eyes to each other.<br/>
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude.” Hermione said suddenly, breaking the silence. Why else would they be looking at her that way?<br/>
“‘Moine, he’s been like that all year.” Ron said.<br/>
Had he? She looked down, a little embarrassed.Had she just not really paid attention or, what? Malfoy was always on her radar, but for some reason she couldn’t recall even a slight feeling of concern for him in a while, at least not in a way that felt like she would be in danger. Maybe she was losing focus. With everything going on, Slughorn, Horcruxes, social pressures and of course schoolwork, maybe she was just taking on too much. But really? Not more than third year. Double course load and reliving entire days.<br/>
What was going on with her?<br/>
“I mean, yeah, the first part of the year, we were sure he was a death eater. But then at the Slug club holiday party…” she drifted. What had happened? She remembered going with Cormac, hiding from his creepy advances and watching Draco get dragged out by the collar by Snape. But after that, it’s as if nothing happened. The world went silent, almost...normal. Well, normal for them.<br/>
Harry dipped his head down, trying to look through the curtain of hair covering her face.”Hey, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” He asked as he put his arm around her for comfort.<br/>
She touched her face and felt the warm wet tears that ran down her cheeks. “I don’t know. I feel, confused. Like I haven’t been awake until now.”<br/>
“Well, you have been pretty busy with Mcgonagall and Horcrux research. Between all that and your prefect duties, you’ve been pretty much absent from everything else. Dumbledore told us that he had everything covered concerning Malfoy.”<br/>
“Really?” Hermione said, tidbits of these conversations coming back to her, clouded but there.<br/>
“I mean, not that we listened,” chimed Ron.  “But it was like Malfoy stopped going crazy after the holiday party. Maybe he really did get his shit together.”<br/>
“Maybe,” she said.  “But, something feels off.”<br/>
“Course, it's Malfoy” They said in unison.  The three of them laughed as Harry hugged her and Ron squeezed her hand.<br/>
“You sure you are gonna be okay? Even with Prefect and T.A. duties tonight?” Harry asked.<br/>
She smiled weakly “It's me, isn't it?” she replied.they all turned back to their tasks. It was about 15 mins later she realized she had not read a single line in her book, as her thoughts kept trying to come together.  Each thought a puzzle piece, all the pieces there but some missing pegs, mutilated, leaving out some details to the full image.  As hard as she try, she knew if she put it all together, it would be incomplete.<br/>
She glanced sideways to see if anyone had noticed to find that the boys had resumed their conversation. Releasing a breath she didn’t realize she had been holding, her attention was caught by a green lined robe rushing past her. That unmistakable white blonde head seemed to shine against the dim lighting of the great hall, as Malfoy moved forward hastily looking over his shoulder.<br/>
Without a second thought, she glided through the crowd of Ravenclaws entering, pursuing her curiosity as well as the nagging feeling that Draco had the answers she needed.</p><p>~•~•~•~•~•~</p><p>This whole week felt like he was was gasping to breathe through a thick fog, walking too fast towards the edge of a cliff.<br/>
When did it become April already?<br/>
The end of year was coming, but little did the rest of the school know, it would end in tragedy. This knowledge weighed on him and him alone. Snape knew, of course, the git. But he was more worried about breaking his unbreakable vow. He didn’t actually give a shit if he lived or died, just more so he didn’t piss off the magic promise he made to Mum.<br/>
Time. Always about timing. He had to appear a student- grades slipping and social life nonexistent but a student, until the moments his dark mark made him it’s bitch. He hated it.<br/>
Wait, he hated it?<br/>
Draco knew the dark Lord had tasked him with this mission to punish his father for his failings. But he had been determined to bring glory to the Malfoy name for so long, he was relieved when the duty of doing so was finally wrenched from his father's failing hands. Sure, the tasks weighed heavy on him, and he struggled, though he was not willing to admit it. And yet, he had never hated his tasks. Finding the room of requirement and bringing the Vanishing cabinet back to life were simple, almost enjoyable moments of quiet in the sea of useless dribble that assaulted his ears daily.<br/>
He sighed as he approached the corridor where he knew the Room would present itself. It was not his current task at hand but one that quickly seemed to be approaching him that had him on edge. It had to be just that. The hardest part had yet to come.<br/>
Of course, none of this was made all the more easier with Granger’s eyes on him constantly. He really didn’t have time to incorporate her into his plans. Avoiding her was the best course of action, however, her intelligence made manipulation of circumstances a more viable option.<br/>
Though his thoughts had drifted, he was acutely aware of her presence as he moved around the castle. Her attempt at discretion was admirable, however, she could not be labeled the stealthiest.  Huh, something she didn't excel at, a sharp laugh escaped his lips.<br/>
Well, he would have to deal with this himself, it was his fault, at least he thought it was? He still hadn’t figured out why he and Granger were in the girls room last week. Why would he be alone with a mudblood...ever!? He must have been caught on the way to the Room and detoured to throw her off. It was all that made sense, except, it still didn't feel right?<br/>
It was all bollocks, but it nagged at him constantly. Especially since he knew better than anyone how to utilize the abilities offered by the Room.<br/>
As he approached, Draco built the place he needed in his mind, but with some protective changes to shield him from Granger’s eyes. She would know where he went exactly, and follow. Nosey, filthy...<br/>
He sighed as he walked through the mountains of things forgotten. Man, he must be exhausted to not even feel the anger behind his words. Draco shook his head, rolled his neck, while hopping on the balls of his feet, flicking his wrists, anything to try and focus his mind and body. Wake up, wake up, he said to himself, looking to one of the many clocks surrounding him, he realized it was almost time.<br/>
“Hello?” A soft voice floated through the seemingly endlessness of the Room of Requirement. “Is someone here?”<br/>
Granger! He swore her name. She was drawing closer to where he and the cabinet were. And it didn’t seem that his guards were implementing themselves. He knew the Room had a mind of its own, but it had never resisted him before.<br/>
Steadily, he raised his wand, ready to stuplify her, leaning his back against the cabinet. Time was of the essence. Any moment, the sister to this cabinet at Borgin and Burkes would send the final live test subject through. He would have two mins to return it, and receive the confirmation for the final stage to begin, if all went according to plan.<br/>
Carefully, Hermione turned the corner, her hand brushing the table of clocks in an almost loving way. She breathed out a sigh, disappointed.<br/>
It seemed he had hidden well enough and that the cabinet, though only two feet away from her, had not caught her attention. She steadied herself, whispering something inaudible as she traced the circle of the clock's face in her hand.<br/>
Suddenly, a bang came from inside, followed by the tweet of a bird. Shit! He spun around from behind the cabinet, his wand at the ready, but Granger didn’t move. Her face still looked down to the table before her, smiling as they chimed 6 in unison.<br/>
She-she didn’t see him. The room had done...something that made her unable to see or hear him. He lowered his wand placing it in his robes and drew closer to her, slowly, an inch at a time.<br/>
It was like being a ghost. He could move near her, hear her and she had no idea. Such power would usually make him feel strong, but in this moment he just felt grateful. He closed his eyes and breathed her in, a calm washing over him.<br/>
“I guess I was wrong Cogsworth” Her voice woke him from what felt like an eternity under a bright summer sun. She walked away, taking the light with her.<br/>
What had just happened? Draco had never been so inclined to think of Granger, let alone be close to her.<br/>
Another thunk in the cabinet and he realized it was 6.05, long past his time limit. Damn it!<br/>
Quickly he opened and closed the door and waited, hoping his Aunt Bella would be so inclined as to forgive his tardiness. Lest he be the first cursed when- well, best not to let his thoughts spiral.<br/>
A moment later, he received a note. The note that he had waited for all year. And yet, at the moment of its arrival, he felt as if he would never see the sun again.</p><p>~•~•~•~•~•~•~</p><p>She was tired. A majority of her energy spent on a wild goose chase, but she had an obligation to Mcgonagall. It was a relief when she finally reached her office and knocked on the door. The next few hours would be spent sitting and grading. Mindless, easy work.<br/>
“Come in!”<br/>
“Hello Professor,” she said laying her books and robe across a chair and settling herself in across from her. Mcgonagall looked at her over the top of her half moon glasses.<br/>
“To what do I owe the pleasure Miss Granger?” She inquired.<br/>
Hermione tilted her head, furrowing her brow. “I'm sorry, isn’t today Thursday?”<br/>
“Yes, and a lovely day of the week it is. And as much as I enjoy your company, it seems I may have forgotten as to why you are here. Did we have a meeting?” Mcgonagall asked, concern on her face as the young witch looked at her, seemingly confused.<br/>
“I- well, I’m your teaching assistant.”<br/>
The young witch and the older sat silently for a moment, an air of questioning looming above them. Mcgonagall removed her glasses, set her quill down and interlaced her fingers together.<br/>
“Miss Granger, I’m not sure if you are struggling to recall or simply forgetting but, you relinquished your duties before the holidays ended, stating that prefect duties were proving more difficult than expected. Now, I believed that you were more than capable but you have also never expressed a feeling of being overwhelmed before such moments in the six years I have had the privilege of knowing you, so I respected your request.”<br/>
Hermione listened, everything she said flooded back. “Of course, professor, it’s just...Ron had mentioned earlier that I was to see you this evening. I assumed you were in need of extra help.  I apologize. I will leave you to your work.” She rose, her eyes fixed on an unparticularly astonishing corner of the desk when her Professor's voice seemed to snap her out of her thoughts.<br/>
“My dear,” choosing her words carefully, “it seems as though you have been struggling this past week to recall a multitude of details as of late.  Have you been feeling as though your mind sparks when trying to recall details but never seems to catch fire when trying to remember moments that should be one way but appear another when looked at under more careful light?”<br/>
Hermione could not find the word but instead shook her head, almost desperately.<br/>
“Hm.” Mcgonagall nodded sharply and then immediately stood, gripping her hand both gingerly and yet, with haste. “You must speak to Albus and quickly, there isn’t much time, come!”  Guiding her to Dumbledore's office.<br/>
She had never seen her professor remove her mask of calm before. The fact that she had spoken the thoughts and feelings she couldn’t name so accurately, frightened her.<br/>
“Lemon Drop,” her professor spoke as she released Hermione's hand, leading the way up the spiralling stairs to the Headmasters office.<br/>
“Minerva, I apologize, but Mr. Potter is on his way and-” Dumbledore stopped when he saw her. “Ahhh, Miss Granger, I had nearly forgotten. I need you to hold onto something for me.”<br/>
“Professor, I was hoping to talk to you about something.” Hermione stated, hoping she would be able to get an answer. Had she been spelled? Could he help her?<br/>
“I am terribly sorry my dear, but I need you to trust me. You have always been so patient and obedient, it has always been a privilege to have your trust,” he held onto her hands with one of his, the other behind his back. “Even now, I can see the wheels spinning and you, such a clever witch, holding back all those questions. My dear, you deserve them all.”<br/>
Hermione felt incredible sad as she looked into his eyes. Not because of his words but because of the tiredness she could see in them.<br/>
“Here, you will find so many answers for both you and another.” Dumbledore handed a small flask, inside a memory.<br/>
“Who professor?”<br/>
“If I told you, you would not believe me. But you are a brilliant witch Hermione, you already know. Even if you wanted to forget, you would know exactly how to remember.” He winked and smiled.<br/>
“Professor, please, I feel as though I’m losing myself. It’s like I’m in a fog and I can’t see the difference from where I was to where I need to be.” Hermione was desperate for answers.<br/>
“I am sorry I can not be of further assistance. I can only repeat the words you spoke to me a few weeks ago, ‘If it is right, it happens—the main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away’” He drew her close and pressed his head to hers, whispering, “You will do great things my dear.” Before walking past her towards Mcgonagall.<br/>
“Now, I know that look, but it is time Minerva, please escort our Miss Granger back to her common room and send in Mr. Potter.” Hermione stood for a moment, planted as she stared at Dumbledore, his back to her, facing his desk.<br/>
“Hermione?” Harry’s voice caught her attention as she was guided out of the room.<br/>
“Harry…” She responded as she passed by. But said no more.<br/>
It was as if a darkness was rising, a sense of unease growing stronger. She felt like she should warn him but from what?<br/>
She walked alongside Professor McGonagall, neither woman truly aware of where they were going, just seemingly gliding along a familiar route. Hermione chewed her bottom lip. Why did Dumbledore quote her John Steinbeck? It wasn’t an incredibly impressive piece of Muggle literature but the quote had always been one she kept in mind when she felt overwhelmed or anxious.<br/>
She had arrived, wishing her professor a good evening politely thanking her for her, um, help, they parted ways as she entered her House common room.<br/>
“Evening Hermione, everything okay?” Neville asked, almost scaring her. She hadn’t seen him, nor the entire groups of Gryffindors scattered throughout the room, playing games, reading, talking, just going about their lives.  She had just stood there, arms crossed, chewing on her lip.<br/>
“Oh, yes. Of course, why wouldn’t I be?” She said hastily, a smile pasted on.<br/>
“Well, to be honest, you don’t look okay. Like something is eating away at you.” Neville said as he drew closer to her, not allowing anyone else to hear. He had always been an intuitive and sensitive friend, always at the ready to help. And he knew the effect the Golden trio had on the rest of the school. If we were in trouble, it wouldn’t be long before other students panicked.<br/>
“It’s just some personal stuff I’d rather not talk about.” She deflected, glancing around the room. Her eyes rested on Ron sitting in a corner with Romilda. They hadn't started dating yet but everyone knew they would, even if they didn’t want to admit it.<br/>
Neville followed her eyes and gripped her fingers sympathetically.  “If it's meant to happen, it will happen.”<br/>
She smiled and gripped his hand back, “Thank you.” It really hadn’t bothered her, seeing Ron with her, but Neville’s words were kind, settling. She sighed and let go, continuing towards her private prefect chamber. In all honesty, her calm this year had come from her private library shelves, organizing and mixing her favorite books, muggle and magical in origin. She had so many, and it was like coming home to see a lover waiting for you when she opened her door to find herself surrounded by some of her best friends.<br/>
She strolled over and reached for “A Life in Letters”, paging through the book she had not read in some time, when an old invitation to the slug club holiday party fell out. Curious? She didn’t usually leave papers in finished books. Reaching down, she looked it over, flipping it from front to back, when she froze.<br/>
On the back was one name, written in her handwriting. Draco.<br/>
Dumbledore had obviously led her here to answer the question of who to share his memory with, but why him? Why her? Why them, together?<br/>
Today was becoming a cluster of thoughts and questions with more questions than answers. All she wanted was to sleep, too exhausted physically to push her mind any further. Just a few moments of rest and she would be able to continue on.<br/>
Lying on her bed, her eyes quickly closing, she felt herself melt to the mattress below her, sinking in. Quickly she drifted away, but not before she completely lost consciousness did it finally occur to her. Dumbledore had said Goodbye.</p><p>~•~•~•~•~•~</p><p>It was time. Any moment, the hammer would fall, and the end would begin. Once, he felt exhilarated at the thought of Dumbledore's fall. Now, he stood next to Snape, his wand in hand, trying to steady his arm.  They waited for Aunt Bella to arrive with the others, hoping something would happen-anything to prevent what was to come.<br/>
As the Vanishing cabinet shook, he knew his hope was for nothing. It couldn’t be stopped. He had helped put this into motion and he alone would be the one to finish it.<br/>
A shrieking cackle rang through the Room as he opened the door and he saw his Aunt’s murderous smile as she stepped out, followed by the Carrow brothers and Greyback.<br/>
“Draco!” She cried as she pinched his cheeks in a mockery of adoration, more so meant to hurt. He didn’t react, he knew better than that.  It would last longer as she relished in his pain. “You may make our Dark Lord happy yet!” The corner of his mouth twinged. She saw a smile, what he felt was fear.<br/>
Success was the only outcome for what was to come.<br/>
“Bella, go have your fun. Create some mayhem and distraction while we find Dumbledore”,Snape said looking down at the small but terrifying witch. There were not many who did not fear his dear Aunty. It has always been amusing to use her as a threat just to see the reactions of those around him. However, Snape held a sense of power and strength that didn’t seem to break in her presence.<br/>
He stood back and watched as Bella moved towards Snape, their eyes locked. Something like a hiss escaped her lips before she moved around his statuesque stance and began skipping, exploding piles of lost items as she passed by, the others following suit.<br/>
Turning towards him, Snape closed his eyes then slowly opened them again, readying himself.<br/>
“Draco, it is time. I know it is unnecessary but may I remind you-”<br/>
“The fate of both our lives rest in my hands. I know, believe me, I know.” Draco said lazily. Every muscle ached with tension and he was exhausted.<br/>
Snape looked at him, silently observing him as if he hadn’t seen him before, a mix of curiosity and pity in his eyes.<br/>
“What?” Draco asked when an awkward amount of stareing time had passed with no verbal exchange.<br/>
“You remind me of, well, me about your age”.<br/>
“Really? Exhausted. Frightened. Praying for whatever end is coming to just, be over with?”<br/>
“Actually, yes.”<br/>
Draco looked to his professor, and felt for a moment like he could help, he would understand. He opened his mouth to speak when mushroom cloud like explosion shook the chandeliers of the Room of Requirement.<br/>
“Damn it, Bella.” They both rushed towards the entrance. “She never understood the importance of subtlety. It’s time Draco. You will find him in the Astronomy Tower. I will be behind you shortly”.<br/>
“But you said I wouldn’t have to do this alone!”<br/>
Snape yelled, rushing the opposite direction. “And you won’t, but that crazy witch did not give us enough time. I must inform the Dark Lord at once of our time change for the port key.<br/>
And with that they took off. Draco felt as if his feet were on backwards, like each movement forward was unnatural and forced. But he continued, running up the staircase to the tower, slowing only when he heard the winds howl.<br/>
Begrudging every step forward, he began to pull out his wand. He licked his lips, suddenly chapped, and tried to swallow, his throat sore and dry. He saw Dumbledore facing out over the ledge, staring into the distance, eyes closed, hands behind his back. His wand in his hands, though more absent mindedly than at the ready.<br/>
“Expelliarmus!” He felt as if he shouted, but the words slipped through his lips, like a cry.  “I’m sorry, sir”.<br/>
Dumbledore turned towards him, a smile stretched across his face, his eyes alight as he looked at the wizard before him. “Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to have your company tonight. It seems that there is much to be done, alas, I think that there is little I can do.” He drew his left hand out from behind his back and raised it up, showing him the blackened, rotting flesh.<br/>
Many didn’t credit Draco as clever, but he was more intelligent than he led on.  He knew a curse when he saw it. Swallowing hard, his eyes watered.<br/>
“If I don’t do this, he will kill me”.<br/>
“You don’t want to do this Draco, I know you don’t”. His professor stated matter of factly. Draco remained silent, but shook his head quickly side to side in agreement. “If you, perhaps, have decided that your loyalty could lie with us, we would protect you. Your mother as well.”<br/>
“We?” Draco asked.<br/>
Dumbledore looked to the stairwell and muttered “Muffalatio” as Snape and Granger stepped out of the Darkness.</p><p>~•~•~•~•~•~•~</p><p>The blast woke Hermione from her sleep immediately. How much time passed? She looked at the clock and saw it was a little past 11 at night. She ran to the window to see the Dark Mark residue in the sky, like fireworks dying as they lose their spark.<br/>
She bolted from her room to see chaos erupting.Professors were evacuating dormitories and leading students to different exits in the castle, seemingly avoiding the courtyard, while scattering everyone.<br/>
A very familiar green point rose above the crowd of Gryffindor first years. She ran as fast as she could shouting for Mcgonagall.<br/>
“Professor! What’s happening?”<br/>
“Death eaters have found a way past the schools wards. I’m taking the younger years to safety, but you- you need to find Professor Snape.”<br/>
“Why? Shouldn’t I be helping you?”<br/>
The Professor took Hermione by the shoulders. “I need you to understand, I do not have all the answers to keep more safe. But you have an important role to play, larger than the Golden Trio. Your purpose, will do more than save lives. It will make a life worth living”.<br/>
Hermione stood, shocked. Speechless.<br/>
“Now go. GO! Snape will be waiting for you near the astronomy tower.”<br/>
Reluctantly, she backed away and began in the direction she had been led.  Every instinct in her body cried to stay, except one, that seemed sure that this was the direction she needed to be going.<br/>
“Miss Granger!” She skidded to a stop at the sound of Snape’s voice.  “Hurry, there isn't much time!”<br/>
Though Harry had always suspected Snape to be in Lord Voldemort's service, Hermione had never sensed that it was that simple. But in this moment, she ran straight towards him, trusting him as she followed.<br/>
As they drew closer to their destination, Hermione could hear the faint voices floating down the Tower as the ascended. Snape's arm halted her right before they reached the top.  She looked up to see his finger pressed against his lips, then pointed to his ear.<br/>
Leaning in closely, quietly, she heard Dumbledore state “You don’t want to do this Draco, I know you don’t”.  She tensed at his name and saw the unmistakable blonde hair as it shook side to side frantically, disheveled as his hair hung in his face.  Malfoy had never looked more vulnerable than he did in this moment.<br/>
“If you, perhaps, have decided that your loyalty could lie with us, we would protect you. Your mother as well.”<br/>
His head shot up when the Headmaster mentioned Narcissa, and like a child, being handed what he desperately sought, Draco snapped his head up to look at his saving grace.  “We?” He asked.<br/>
She saw Dumbledore look at her and knew to step out of the darkness.<br/>
“Muffalatio.” Dumbledore surrounded them in a bubble, separated from the world for just a few moments.  He needed privacy, and only the four of them were to know what was to transpire next.<br/>
“We don't have much time so I will make haste.  Snape has been aiding in the war against the Dark Lord for years and he is here to help you Draco, not just to protect you as your mother requested.”  Hermione stood, listening.  She was terribly confused but felt as though she needed to hang onto these words, they were essential for survival.<br/>
It was clear that Draco was shocked, as his eyes darted from face to face.<br/>
“There are many questions that I can not answer but what I need from you in my final moments is your trust, your forgiveness, and your attention.”<br/>
“Final moments!?” Hermione cried.<br/>
“He’s dying.” Draco said.  It almost seemed cruel how blantly he put it, but there was a catch in his throat as he spoke the words that cracked his facade. The Headmaster raised his left hand to show the blackened skin of physical curse, rapidly breaking down whatever counter magic was preventing it from taking it's hold “I was sent to assassinate our Headmaster but it seems it was unnecessary.”<br/>
Before she realized it, her wand was in her hand as she screamed “You murderous coward!” Snape held her back, on arm around her waist, his hand wrapped around the wrist of her wand hand, as she twisted and lunged trying to scratch, curse, anything at Malfoy.<br/>
He stood there looking at her, unable to say anything.  What could be said?<br/>
“Miss Granger, please, do not forget our conversation earlier.”  She settled, still flaming mad, but listened to the calm in Dumbledore's voice, drawing her back from her rage. If this truly were his last moments, she would respect his wishes. “You know what you need to do.  The Death Eaters are on their way any moment.  Draco, please, go with Miss Granger to my office.  Snape will take charge of your mission now.  There is a port key on my desk for when the time comes.  Quickly, before you are seen”.  He waved his hands before them indicating they needed to leave immediately.<br/>
With one more glance, she saw her Professor smile towards them, like an old man admiring the young, vibrant life before him, however also acutely aware of the struggles they will endure.<br/>
Absent mindedly, she took Malfoy, who did not seem capable of moving whether from fear or shock, she did not know, by the hand and led them down the stairwell. Rushing, her feet a blur between tears and speed, it took every ounce of concentration to move rapidly without falling to her knees.  She must not have heard the Death Eaters approaching but Draco did.  He pulled her back, pushing her into a nearby broom closet. Shocked, she wanted to curse his name, but his back was against her chest, arm drawn over her, protectively, listening for the sounds of footsteps as they moved further away.  Maybe, he really had switched sides.  This would be good, this could make all the difference in the War.  Both he and snape would be able to help them.  When he was sure they had passed, they filed out, continuing towards the Headmaster's office.</p>
