    <p>Perhaps it would have been better if Draco had stayed inside his dorm that day, but that wasn't exactly an option. Maybe it would have been better if he hadn't returned to Hogwarts for an eighth year in an attempt to better himself and his family's image. Or it may have been better if he hadn't gone to Hogwarts to begin with. </p><p>Yes. That would've solved everything.</p><p>-</p><p>Draco woke one Tuesday morning to the sound of his dormmates rustling around. It was early, a bit earlier than he typically got up, thus he was plenty aggravated that they were making such noise. He pulled the sheet up over his eyes and ears in an attempt to block out the day's disturbances, but to no avail. </p><p>"Draco," One boy said, whom Draco hadn't really bothered to get to know all that well but dealt with all the same. He had soft hair. His name was Brandon. "Draco, wake up!"</p><p>Soft hair or no, the boy was on the verge of meeting a proper stunning spell.</p><p>Draco spoke through the sheets. "What is it?" he said tiredly, still half asleep. Brandon giggled. "Blaise said to get up early and meet him in the Great Hall. He wants to have a go at the Potions equipment before the Gryffindors get in so we can get points."</p><p>The blonde groaned. "And why couldn't literally anyone else do this with him?"</p><p>"We are!" The other boy exclaimed. "But all of the eighth years from the house have to be there for the points, remember?"</p><p>Draco snorted, climbing out of bed. "You say that as if there is more than twelve of us from each house."</p><p>The boy shrugged. "Less people to count on, easier to pull together. Come on, now! We've still got to eat!"</p><p>Frankly, the former Death Eater wasn't all that excited about breakfast. He preferred to remain upstairs, but it wasn't uncommon for his housemates to force him to the Hall. He tried not to say much about it and remain good-natured, but sometimes, it was his worst nightmare. He could get away with skipping dinner a lot more easily, though.</p><p>He pulled on his robes, snatching up his wand from the bedstand and following Brandon out the door to the Great Hall. He almost walked away when he saw the whole eighth year Slytherin house sitting at the table designated for their year only. Yes, they were small, but that was worse, because they all practically knew everything about each other. Except Draco. He did his best to not get to know much of anybody more than he already had. Brandon sat down just as happily as always, and as Draco was made to sit next to him, he found himself wondering for the umpteenth time how the other boy had gotten into Slytherin rather than Hufflepuff. He knew better than to doubt him, though. It was what one couldn't see that had the value, he had learned.</p><p>His housemates were all in a weirdly talkative mood, and he was having little of it. He picked at pieces of fruit on his plate as a goblet was shoved in front of him. He looked up to see Theodore Nott grinning at him. "Here," he said amiably. "Drink it."</p><p>Draco took the cup politely, peering inside. It was the color of cranberry juice, nothing unordinary, but Theo offering it made it suspicious. "What is it?" he asked.</p><p>"Cranberry juice," the other boy answered cheerily. "We've all got some. I added just a wee bit of Felix Felicis, though. You know, for those points."</p><p>The blond cocked his head. "That's a bit of a waste of a potion, don't you think?"</p><p>"Nah," the other dissuaded. "It's really for the principle. Come on, now. Cheers, all! To winning the House Cup!"</p><p>"Aye!" the others mock-saluted. Draco smiled pleasantly, giving in to the charade. He pulled a swig from the goblet- after all, when doesn't one need a bit of luck?- and continued sipping at it throughout the meal. His companions kept glancing over at him, but Draco was fairly used to being stared at, so he didn't think much of it.</p><p>Then the Gryffindors came in. </p><p>Draco willed himself to keep looking at his plate, to not look up, but of its own volition, as usual, his body disobeyed, glancing towards the near side of the table where the other eighth years were settling themselves, including Hermione Granger and... Harry Potter. The black haired boy shoved into the seat, listening intently to his friend ramble about something passionately. Draco wondered what it was like to be on the receiving end of such intent curiousity, and then he realized he had been before, just never positively. He looked away, back at his plate, and focused on veering his mind away from things that were Potter-related. At the same time, said boy glanced over at him, and Draco could feel him looking, before hearing, "'lo, Malfoy!"</p><p>The Slytherin drew in a breath that was only a bit shaky before meeting the Gryffindor's eyes. He waved hesitantly, just like nearly every morning. "Hello, Potter." And just like nearly every morning, Harry Potter beamed at him, then returned to his conversation, and Draco was left to have next to zero appetite as his stomach erupted into butterflies.</p><p>Oh, sweet Merlin, perhaps if he had died, things would be better.</p><p>-</p><p>The Slytherins and Gryffindors had joint Potions, because that was the best combination, as history spoke, of course. Their professor just enjoyed giving points based on which house was early enough to clean out the cabinets and shutters, so Draco's part of the table rushed to the classroom to take their seats. The Gryffindors wandered in lazily as they cleaned and set up the room. Honestly, it seemed that the entire eighth year Gryffindor body distinctly lacked any sort of fervor that was usually so typical of the house itself. Draco scrubbed the inside of a cauldron and watched Potter come in, settling down in the seat beside his own. Draco bit his lip, looking away, pretending to be deeply engrossed in his task. The other boy peered inside the cauldron. "Why're you scrubbing it?" he questioned, and the blond blinked. "Um," he said stupidly, then mentally berated himself. "We're making something thin, apparently. So any residual material stuck inside could ruin it. Can't risk it," he answered, returning to the cauldron. "Would you mind flipping to 474?"</p><p>Harry did as told, but still asked, "Why?"</p><p>Draco looked back at him, staring. Then, "Because that's what the Professor's written up on the board."</p><p>The boy who lived looked up to confirm the other's statement, and then grinned sheepishly. "That, ah. Makes sense."</p><p>"I would hope so," Draco retorted. Harry elbowed him in his side, albeit gently, and all of Draco's nerves pinpointed to the spot where he'd touched. He turned to Harry, finished scrubbing but still with sponge in hand. The latter returned the gaze openly, with a wide grin still plastered on his face. He reached over and picked the sponge from Draco's fingers. "Don't need that any longer, no?"</p><p>Draco merely shook his head. Harry chuckled, and went to return it to the soap bin. Draco's eyes followed him, but he quickly turned to his textbook, sitting down in his seat and wishing quite hard that he was anywhere but here. Alas, he could feel Harry sit back down and lean slightly closer to read over his shoulder. "Pepperup Potion?" Harry read outloud, sitting back with a huff. "That's awfully boring. We always do the boring ones on Tuesdays."</p><p>Draco hadn't intended to, but he let out a small snicker. Harry seemed encouraged by this and kept going. "Do you think it's because the Professor is secretly some sort of party animal?"</p><p>The Slytherin raised a brow. "Nobody parties on a Monday."</p><p>"Aha! But that's where you're wrong! If one is a Potions teacher, who teaches a limited amount of different potions, and has a disproportionate amount of interesting and uninteresting potions to teach about, perhaps one drains oneself by getting crazy and starting off the week with an interesting potion, and then is too tired the next morning, so one teaches a properly uninteresting potion to make up for it."</p><p>"That is absolutely absurd," Draco responded, biting his cheek to keep from grinning at the stupid ranting. Harry shook his head. "Oh no," he disagreed. "I think it's quite possible. It's the sort of observation Luna would make me privy to. I've been learning the ins and outs of this school's theory, Malfoy."</p><p>Perhaps another year, Draco would've responded with a snark about Lovegood's concept of fact. But today, he only looks to Harry, who seems well pleased by his jousting, and he thinks about how well Harry treats the friends he has here. And speaks on such. </p><p>"You are awfully nice to all of them," he says, before he knows what he's doing. He doesn't dwell on it much, though, because it's innocent enough. Harry looks puzzled, though. </p><p>"All of who?"</p><p>Draco fiddles with his quill. "Your friends. Like... Luna."</p><p>Harry observes him for a moment, probably trying to see where the punchline is. When he finds none, the grin is back in place. "They deserve it. They're just as good to me. I quite like them." Draco nodded politely, but the other boy continued. "After all, I think this would all be infinitely boring without the lot of you."</p><p>The Slytherin froze. "Of us? What do you mean?"</p><p>Harry fixed him with an amused look. "My friends. The ones we were just discussing?"</p><p>He considered Draco a friend.</p><p>Friends. </p><p>This time a year ago, they'd wanted to kill each other. But today, they were friends. </p><p>What a blissful world to live in.</p><p>"Draco?"</p><p>He snapped back to the conversation, in which Harry was looking at him expectantly. Draco had no idea what he'd said before, if anything. "I'm sorry," he said. "What'd you say?"</p><p>Harry motioned towards the cupboard. "We need a snout."</p><p>Draco blinked. "A snout."</p><p>A solemn nod. "A snout" Harry made a gesture as if elongating his nose. "You know?"</p><p>Draco was suddenly laughing. Harry was as well, and they went to the cupboard together, retrieving their materials, as the headed back to the table, Draco felt eyes on him, and looked to see Blaise and Theodore watching him carefully. He knotted his brow together, and they waved, totally friendly. Draco waved back. Perhaps it was odd for them to see him laughing. They always gave him odd looks when he did.</p><p>"So," Harry prompted as they divvied up the necessary tasks. Draco was cutting a root, and looked over to his partner with a raised brow in lieu of an answer. "What're you reading now?"</p><p>Draco blinked, completely confused for a moment, before remembering that for whatever odd reason, Harry liked to hear about the books he'd been reading recently. So he began talking about it as he was cutting. "It's the History of Merlin, unadapted. Quite interesting, I think, although a bit dry- you see...."</p><p>As he went on animatedly, at one point waving the knife he was holding before Harry gently moved the hand back down to the table, Draco continued to focus on their work, only looking to Harry every so often to check what he was doing or to make sure he was still listening. He always was. Draco did not notice, however, his Slytherin friends glancing over at their table frequently, nor the way Harry was looking at him. It was a gaze of intent curiosity. </p><p>In this case, though, it was notably positive.</p>
