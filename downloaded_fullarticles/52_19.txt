    <p>Professor Albus Dumbledore paused at the start of Privet Drive when he saw the number of lampposts illuminating the street. “That won’t do”, he said quietly pulling out his deluminator and using it to remove the light from the lampposts. Now Privet Drive was completely in darkness save for the odd light here and there from porches and windows. It didn’t matter about those lights as it was dark enough so that no muggles would see Hagrid on his flying motorcycle.</p><p>A cat meowed, catching his attention. He glanced down and smiled at the feline whom he recognised as being Professor McGonagall in her animagus form. “I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore watched as the tabby cat grew, changing into the form of the transfiguration teacher “Good evening, Professor Dumbledore”, she said politely. They walked past a couple of doors before McGonagall spoke again “Are the rumours true, Albus?”</p><p>She heard whispers that You-Know-Who had gone to Godric’s Hollow to kill the Potter family, James, Lily and their son Harry. He’d managed to succeed in killing James and Lily but not Harry. The stories varied in what exactly happened to You-Know-Who after his killing curse rebounded when he tried to use it on the infant Harry. Some said he died. Others say that he was extremely weakened. While McGonagall had hoped the former was true, she had a bad feeling it was most likely to be the latter.</p><p>“I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad”, Dumbledore replied solemnly.</p><p>“And the boy?” McGonagall asked.</p><p>“Hagrid is bringing him”, Dumbledore replied.</p><p>The Head of Gryffindor looked at the wizard in surprise “Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” she questioned.</p><p>“Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life”</p><p>There was a roar of an engine sounded in the sky making both professors look up in time to see a large flying motorcycle descending. It lands on the street, skidding a little before coming to a halt. Its rider, Rubeus Hagrid, pulls off his goggles. “Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall”, he greeted as he got off the motorcycle.</p><p>“No problems, I trust Hagrid?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>The Keeper of Keys shook his head “No sir”, he answered “Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol”. Hagrid then carefully removed the infant from the sling that rested across his chest.</p><p>“Albus, do you really think it’s safe, leaving him with these people?” McGonagall asked quietly as they walked down the street towards number 4 where the Dursleys lived “I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are…”</p><p>“The only family he has”, Dumbledore said interrupting her.</p><p>“This boy will be famous. There won’t be a child in our world who doesn't know his name”, McGonagall pointed out.</p><p>“Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready”, Dumbledore said before he gently placed Harry down on the ground by the front door. He then places a letter on top of Harry. “Good luck...Harry Potter”, Dumbledore said softly after he stood.</p><p>Over on the Isle of the Lost, Maleficent stood by the large glass window, looking out at Auradon. “We have to get off this island soon”, she said to her husband who was sitting in a chair nearby, their baby daughter in his arms “Mal can’t grow up here”. Ever since their child was born, the two of them had been searching for a way to escape so that Mal could have a much better life than she would on the Isle. You’d think being a villain that Maleficent had another agenda for getting off the Isle of the Lost but genuinely she didn’t. It was like becoming a mother had flipped a switch. She was less mean…less evil to others. A complete 180 to what she was before.</p><p>Lucas stood up, careful not to jostle Mal in his arms as she was sleeping “We will find a way through the barrier. I’ve still got a few tricks up my sleeve. And once we’re free, I’ll show you both my world”, he said.</p>
