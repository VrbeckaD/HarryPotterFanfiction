    <p>Pansy Parkinson was a very clever girl, a very observant girl. <span class="hardreadability"> That said, as she stared into the compartment on the train, even a blind man could see how unwell Harry Potter looked</span>. Unwell enough for her to step into the train compartment and take a seat beside him. She watches out of the window at the Weasley matriarch giving her children loud goodbyes. A shameful display for a pure-blood family, blood-traitors or not. She glances at Potter to see dull green eyes looking back at her. She notices the flicker of a glamour around him and turns her eyes back to the crowds outside. The two dark-haired 4th years sit listening to the sounds of the lively train.</p>

    <p>“Pansy, there you are. You would think on a singular hallway you would be easier to find.” Daphne Greengrass pauses right as she goes to sit down, noticing Potter slouching in the corner. "Why are you sitting with Potter?</p>

    <p>He runs a trembling hand through his greasy lank hair and his mouth twists in what she could only describe as pain. “They’re very loud.” His voice is quiet and hoarse. Pansy goes to pat the hand that rests in his lap, but pauses when he flinches back. He scrunches his eyes closed before releasing a slow breath. </p>

    <p>“I spent it in France with my mother. Father had business over in the states. Plenty of pretty boys and girls to keep me from <span class="passivevoice"> being bored</span>.” Daphne crosses her ankles and begins to braid her honey blonde hair. She gets frustrated with it <span class="adverb"> quickly</span>. “Tracey is fine. When I saw her earlier, she was talking to her father about taking her O.W.L.S. early. She stayed with me a week and I toyed with the idea of burning her school books so she’d pay attention to me.”</p>

How curious. “Um, if you want I can braid your hair?” Daphne and Pansy both look at him in surprise. He blushes <span class="adverb"> faintly</span>. Daphne notices how shaky his hands are but makes Pansy switch seats with her anyway. <span class="hardreadability"> She and Pansy keep a steady flow of conversation even as the train begins to move and Tracey Davis finally finds their compartment</span>. <span class="hardreadability"> Tracey doesn’t ask why Harry Potter is adding blue butterfly clips whose wings flutter into Daphne’s very beautiful braid</span>. She does ask if he’ll braid hers too.  </p>

    <p>Potter sits with them in their carriage, pausing to pet the invisible thing pulling the cart. He seems confused when they mention they can’t see what he has his hands on. “It’s like a dark, boney horse with wings, I suppose.” He tells them when they ask for him to describe it. Tracey snorts at his horrible attempt, but nods anyway.</p>

    <p>“It’s called a Thestral. Don’t know why they have a symbol of death pulling the Hogwart’s carriage, but it’s fascinating to know it’s there.” Tracey explained once they begin moving. “Have to have seen someone die to be able to see it.” Her amber eyes bore into the face of the constantly moving boy across from her.  </p>

    <p>Pansy watches as Potter shifts before he shrugs. “I watched my mom die.” ‘as she <span class="passivevoice">was killed by</span> Voldemort’ <span class="passivevoice">was left</span> hanging unsaid in the air. Daphne hums in response and <span class="adverb">slowly</span>, as not to startle him, runs her fingers through his hair. She wants to flinch in disgust, but something tells her that his unwashed state is not his fault. </p>

  <p> He lets her pet his hair as long as she wants, and she pulls away only once the carriage has stopped. He gives her a kind smile and she squeezes his hand once <span class="adverb"> gently</span>. Slytherins are well aware that some things are much different behind closed doors and Harry Potter seems to live in a maze of closed doors. <span class="hardreadability"> She can already tell from the way Pansy watches the boy with a maternal glint in her onyx eyes that Potter was about to become a usual part of their lives</span>. The 9 hour trip with him had warmed him to her so she wasn’t going to complain. Something about that boy made her want to smother him in hugs and make sure he was wearing a scarf and that he ate. He pulled forth very mothering feelings from the three girls in the carriage with them. Plus, her hair looked lovely and she’d<span class="adverb"> </span>have to have him do it again.</p>

    <p>Pansy settled her eyes on the very boy that kept crossing her mind. <span class="veryhardreadability"> One such Harry Potter who looked as if he was going to throw up all over the Gryffindor table as Granger spoke rapidly in his face and the lanky Weasley stuffed his gob</span>. Lifeless green eyes lifted up to meet hers and her breath caught in her throat at the flicker in the glamour. <span class="hardreadability"> Pansy Polaris Parkinson was sure, as much as she didn’t want to be, that Harry Potter was hiding some very dark secrets under that perfect facade</span>.</p>

Breakfast continues calmly and as Snape passes out her timetable, she finds herself breathing easier as Potter smiles at her from across the hall. </span></p>
