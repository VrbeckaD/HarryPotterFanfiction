</p>
<p>“Ooo!” James’s eyes widened as he stopped outside Quality Quidditch Supplies, eyeing the latest Nimbus model in the window. Teddy laughed and grabbed him by the arm to pull him away.</p>
<p>“We’re under strict orders from your mum to get school supplies only, remember? You can haggle with your dad for a new broom later.”</p>
<p>James groaned but didn’t argue as Teddy pushed him towards Flourish and Blotts. Then he continued past the doorway and laughed when Teddy stopped, hands on hips, to frown at him.</p>
<p>“I know, I know, school supplies only,” James said, pulling his list out of his pocket. “But you can’t tell me you wouldn’t rather go see what new things Uncle George has at the shop.”</p>
<p>That was true, and the glint in James’s eye said he knew it, but Teddy wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of admitting it. “Look, we can pick up your stuff and then do some window shopping, alright?” he said, plucking the list out of James’s hands as they entered the bookshop. “How long could it– Merlin, James, how many O.W.L.s are you taking?”</p>
<p>James scuffed his heel. “Um. Defense, Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Care of Magical Creatures, Arithmancy, and History of Magic.” When Teddy stared at him, he flushed. “What?”</p>
<p>“Why so many?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what I want to do yet, so I need to keep my options open. You need five good N.E.W.T.s to get into the Auror Academy,” James said, taking his list back as he headed for the shelves.</p>
<p>Teddy trailed after him. “James, you know you don’t have to be an Auror because your dad and I are, right?”</p>
<p>James rolled his eyes, plucking a book off the shelf. “I know that. It’s not like you became an Auror just because your mum was one.” That had factored into Teddy’s decision, but he didn’t contradict James. He wasn’t sure when he’d begun to censor himself around James, but entering his last year in the Academy, he felt like he ought to act more like a role model than the older-brother-slash-cousin he’d always been before.</p>
<p>“Besides, I haven’t decided for sure yet,” James continued. “I’m keeping my options open. Taking things that might come in handy. Hold these,” he said, shoving a stack of books into Teddy’s arms so he could stand on tip-toe and Summon one from a top shelf.</p>
<p>Teddy should have admonished him for doing magic outside of school, if he were being a real role model, but James had been using his presence as a cover for underage magic for years, and Teddy knew it wouldn’t mean anything if he chastised him for it now. “In what world is a History of Magic O.W.L. going to come in handy?” He teased, as James added the book to his stack.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting,” James said, continuing before Teddy could protest, “the <i>topic</i> is interesting. Or would be, if Binns weren’t teaching it.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, Jamie,” Teddy said. He smiled, but it must not have reached his eyes because James stopped in his tracks, turning to face him with a slight frown.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright, Teddy? You seem kind of...down.”</p>
<p>Teddy opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again. “Everything’s fine, James. I’m just tired. Auror training is a lot of work,” he said, trying to lighten the mood, but James’s frown only deepened.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to come today if you needed to rest,” he said. “I’m sorry–”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? This is our tradition, James. I wouldn’t have missed this for the world. Now.” Teddy nodded towards the list in James’s hands. “How many books do we still need to get?”</p>

    <u>Chapter One</u>

  <br/>
  <i>March 2031<br/>10 ½ years later</i>
</p>
<p>James Potter had had a bad day.</p>
<p>It was a Wednesday – automatically a detractor. It was raining – not unexpected for England, but this wasn’t a drizzle, it was a proper downpour. By the time he got to his office, water had soaked through James’s shoes and into his socks because even though he was getting his Masters in Transfiguration, his Impermeability Charms were still a little bit shit. Al had cancelled on him for lunch, and his advisor, Tracy, had been running behind, which meant their meeting ran late and James hadn’t been able to pick up the new books he’d ordered before the shop closed. The meeting had been bad as well – he hadn’t made as much progress as he should have since their last meeting, he already knew that, and he didn’t need her to tell him so with such a disappointed look on her face.</p>
<p>By the time he left uni, his socks were damp and the sky was dark. He’d still hoped to salvage his evening – he could write a page or two, review his lecture notes, and reward himself for his productivity with a bowl of his favorite ice cream – but he didn’t have any left at home, and they were out at both the Tesco around the corner and the Sainsbury’s down the road.</p>
<p>James consoled himself with a frozen pizza for dinner, but he didn’t hear the timer go off and the edges were burnt when he pulled it out of the oven. He only got through half a page of writing before the headache he’d had since lunch went from <i>annoying</i> to <i>pounding,</i> and after it took him fifteen minutes to write one sentence he admitted it might be time to call it a night.</p>
<p>James glanced at the clock. It was past nine – that was late enough to go to bed, if one didn’t mind acting old and boring, which James didn’t, no matter how many times Albus teased him for it. He still needed to review his lecture notes – he was presenting on the history and properties of Animagus transformations the next morning – but he could do that under the covers of his bed rather than at his desk in the sitting room. Maybe he’d even wake up early and do it then. Right now all he had the energy to do was make himself a cup of tea and put on his pyjamas – perhaps he would take some headache tonic before bed to make sure his head was clear when he woke up.</p>
<p>As he waited for the kettle to boil, he washed and put away his dishes from dinner. His kitchen was small, but well suited for his purpose – making simple meals for one. The table shoved in the corner had only two chairs, so if both Albus and Lily were over for dinner they sat on the sofa. On the rare occasions when James baked, he dragged his desk closer to the kitchen door and used it as an extra worktop.</p>
<p>He prepared his mug on autopilot, and was halfway up the stairs when someone knocked on his front door.</p>
<p>James turned around, rolling his eyes. Albus <i>would</i> show up after dark as an apology for ditching James earlier in the day – never mind that he knew James had to be up early because unlike <i>some people,</i> he didn’t set his own hours–</p>
<p>“For fuck’s sake, Al,” he said, throwing open the door, and then blinked, because it wasn’t Albus standing at his front door.</p>
<p>It was Teddy.</p>
<p>
  <i>Teddy.</i>
</p>
<p>James was transported back to the last time he’d seen him, the end of winter hols his fifth year of Hogwarts. All the kids were gathering at the Burrow to leave for King’s Cross together, and Teddy had Apparated into the front garden to say goodbye. He’d been wearing the denim jacket they’d found in the attic at Grimmauld the summer before James started school, the one with the initials <i>R.J.L.</i> inked into the collar, and his shoulders were hunched against the cold because even with a jumper and a hoodie underneath, that coat wasn’t meant for January weather. That had never stopped Teddy from wearing it year round.</p>
<p>When he’d hugged James, the material had been rough against his cheek, and he remembered thinking Teddy smelled good and being embarrassed by the thought. Teddy had held James by the shoulders and told him to <i>kick arse on his O.W.L.s,</i> and that image, Teddy wearing a Hufflepuff scarf that clashed with his blue hair, eyes glittering in the early morning light, had been the one James returned to most often over the past ten years when he was feeling maudlin.</p>
<p>Less than a month later he’d been called into McGonagall’s office when his dad had come to school to tell them that Teddy was gone.</p>
<p>“James,” Teddy said. His voice was the same. His hair wasn’t – a sedate brown – but he wore that same jacket, so old by now it had to be held together by magic. “James, listen, I need your help–”</p>
<p>Which was all he got out before James slammed the door.</p>
<p>He slumped against it, pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes and trying to rub away the sight. His head was <i>throbbing.</i> He was more tired than he thought – the stress from his studies had finally gotten to him. No one had mentioned, when telling him how much work his Masters would be, that he might start <i>hallucinating.</i></p>
<p>A knock, right next to his ear, urgent and quick. The words were nervous, but pitched to carry. “James?”</p>
<p>Not a hallucination, then. He hadn’t really thought so, but it might have been easier to deal with.</p>
<p>He turned and re-opened the door.</p>
<p>Teddy was still there, and this time, James let himself look.</p>
<p>He hadn’t changed much. James himself had grown since he was fifteen and was closer to Teddy’s height now, but Teddy was still taller. He had on a jumper under the jacket, and a large rucksack over his shoulders. Ripped jeans, and ratty trainers, and a–</p>
<p>A baby in his arms. Wrapped in a blanket, mint green, that almost shone in the dark. As James watched, Teddy looked down, and a tiny hand appeared from the folds to grab his offered index finger.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Teddy looked at him, then down the street. James lived in an area that was residential, mostly Muggle. His neighbors were families with small children who viewed the young, single academic as an eccentric oddity. By this time of night, the street was deserted, save for Mrs. Banerjee down who was taking her dog out.</p>
<p>Still, Teddy looked nervous, as though he expected someone to be watching him.</p>
<p>“Can I come in?”</p>
<p>James wanted to say no, wanted to make Teddy answer all kinds of questions before James let him into his home. A not insubstantial part of him – the part that felt fifteen sometimes – wanted to have it out with him in the doorway, fuck what his neighbors thought, then slam the door in Teddy’s face.</p>
<p>But there was something in Teddy’s eyes as they darted away from James to the empty street, down to the baby, up to James. It was something fearful, and his voice trembled when he spoke. “Please, James?”</p>
<p>James stepped aside, letting Teddy pass by. He locked the door, and when he turned back around, Teddy was still hovering right inside the doorway. James knew the polite thing to do would be to invite him to sit down, but he was feeling too big for his skin, the familiar anger he hadn’t dwelt on in years rising within him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Teddy?”</p>
<p>The words came out louder than he meant them to, more forceful, and Teddy flinched. James felt instant regret, and then told himself he shouldn’t, but Teddy glanced down at the baby who was beginning to fuss, and shame suffused him.</p>
<p>“I–” Teddy swallowed, shifting on his feet. “I’ve left New York.”</p>
<p>James didn’t even know that that was where Teddy’d run off to, all those years ago. </p>
<p>“I can see that,” he said. The words were sharp, but he didn’t know how to soften them.</p>
<p>Teddy took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Can I stay with you for awhile?” he asked. “I– we don’t have anywhere to go. I wouldn’t– I know it’s a lot to ask, but I, I can’t face Harry or my gran right now–”</p>
<p>“Why are you back?” James interrupted. “I mean– ten years, Teddy. Ten years of <i>nothing,</i> and you show up at my door with– with a kid? And I’m supposed to help you?”</p>
<p>Teddy cradled the child a little closer to his chest. “I know, and I– I don’t think I can explain it all right now.” He let out a breath. “I couldn’t think of anywhere else for us to go.”</p>
<p>Those words, spoken so earnestly, landed deep in James’s chest. He’d lived with his anger at Teddy for so long, not letting himself think much about anything else. But truer than the anger was how much trust he'd put in Teddy. How Teddy had been the first one he wanted to talk to when anything bad happened, the opinion he’d valued most for all his big decisions. If he’d known how to reach him, James would have been on Teddy’s doorstep years ago, and there was no doubt in his mind that Teddy would have let him in.</p>
<p>The difference was that James had had no idea how to find him.</p>
<p>That was the question James wanted to ask – <i>why me, and anyway, how did you even get here?</i> – but the baby let out a soft cry and had Teddy’s attention in an instant. James nodded to the baby. “Is he yours?”</p>
<p>“She,” Teddy corrected. “And yes.”</p>
<p>James waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.</p>
<p>“What’s her name?”</p>
<p>“Dora,” he said. “Dora Lupin.”</p>
<p>Teddy looked up. His face was creased with worry. “So, can we stay with you? Not for– not for <i>too</i> long, I mean, I’m not sure, but, well–”</p>
<p>“Sure, Teddy,” James interrupted. “You can stay.” He picked up his now-cold tea from the coffee table. “Guest bedroom’s upstairs, unless you want something to eat first?”</p>
<p>Teddy shook his head and smiled. “Just tired.”</p>
<p>James’s guest bedroom wasn’t equipped for a baby. It was a small room, mostly taken up by the double bed and chest of drawers, with a built-in wardrobe and a chair crammed into the corner. There were floating shelves instead of bedside tables, and the duvet cover was hideous. When he’d moved in, James had intended to make the space his office, before he realized he was working downstairs most of the time because it had better light. He’d moved his desk and outfitted the room with spare furniture from his family, feeling quite pleased with himself for having a guest room at all. He’d never had any complaints from anyone who stayed there, but he was not prepared to house a baby.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “I don’t have a cot or anything– I can Transfigure something for you if you like.” He had an end table downstairs he wasn’t using. Well, it had his post on it at the moment, but that was more out of laziness than anything else.</p>
<p>Teddy shook his head. “That’s alright,” he said. “She usually sleeps in the bed with me anyway.” He looked around, seeming ill at ease in the room. “Do you mind if I put her changing mat on the chest of drawers?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” James said. The lighting in the guest room was better than on his front step or in his hallway, and it was clear that Teddy was exhausted, the circles under his eyes deep and grey. “Do you need anything else?” he asked.</p>
<p>Teddy shook his head. “No, this is plenty– <i>more</i> than enough. Really.” He laughed, dry and bitter. “I’m sure I don’t deserve it.”</p>
<p>James frowned. He didn’t like the tone of voice Teddy used, like he had taken it for granted that James wouldn’t want to help him, but he wasn’t entirely wrong. James was still upset about what Teddy had done, and wasn’t interested in trying to appease him or make it seem like he wasn’t mad.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a lecture at nine tomorrow, so I’ll be out of the house early,” James said instead. “Help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I don’t have– I don’t know what Dora’s eating, but I think there might be applesauce in the pantry if you’d like. Or there’s a Tesco just down the street if you need to go buy her something.”</p>
<p>“Tesco,” Teddy repeated.</p>
<p>James suppressed a bolt of annoyance – had Teddy been gone so long he’d forgotten what Tesco was? “It’s about a ten minute walk,” he said. “I’ll leave a spare key on the kitchen table if you want to go out.</p>
<p>Teddy nodded, exhaling a shaky breath. “Thank you, James. Really.”</p>
<p>“No problem,” James said, uncomfortable. He should have left it at that, but he couldn’t stop the next words that came out of his mouth. “I’m still mad, you know.” Teddy looked up at him, startled. “I want to help you, but I haven’t– I haven’t forgiven you.”</p>
<p>Teddy looked at the ground. “I...yeah. I get that.” He gave that bitter laugh again. “Well, thanks for helping me anyways.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Teddy did the shifty eye thing again, as though he thought something in the room might be watching him. “Listen, I know I’ve no leg to stand on when it comes to asking you for favors, but I was wondering if maybe you might – please, can you not tell anyone I’m here? Not yet,” he amended, as James stared at him. “I’ll tell them, eventually, but I– I can’t yet. I need some time to settle in.”</p>
<p>Teddy living in his spare room, no explanation of why he’d come back, and James couldn’t even Floo Lily to bitch about it. What had he done to deserve this?</p>
<p>“Fine.” James felt awkward and more than that, tired. Too tired to argue. He knew he wouldn’t be falling asleep anytime soon, but he needed to at least get in bed and try to rest his brain. He had a big day tomorrow. “Maybe we can talk more after I get home tomorrow, then.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Teddy said. “Goodnight, Jamie.”</p>
<p>The old nickname ran a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>When James went to check in with Tracy, who had been sitting at the back of the classroom where he’d been lecturing, she gave him an odd look and told him they’d talk tomorrow.<p>“I can tell you’re distracted,” she’d said. “Unless you want to talk about it, I think it would be best if we debriefed tomorrow?”</p>
<p>James didn’t want to tell Tracy about his long-missing godbrother showing up at his door the night before any more than he thought he’d be over the weirdness by tomorrow, but he knew an escape route when he saw one, so he thanked her and left. He was thinking of what he wanted to have for lunch – maybe he’d eat out for once, he needed a little time to himself before the prospect of facing Teddy – and jumped when Albus threw an arm around his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Al!” James said, spinning out from under his shoulder and pushing him off the footpath, which would soon be crowded with students. “What are you doing here?” Albus, even more so than Lily, found James’s pursuit of academia mind boggling and boring and rarely stepped foot onto his campus out of protest.</p>
<p>“I felt bad about cancelling on our plans yesterday, so I thought I could take you out today!” Albus grinned. “I’ll buy. We can even go to that weird tapas place you like.”</p>
<p>“Tapas isn’t weird,” James argued automatically. “You’re just uncultured.”</p>
<p>Al laughed. “Is that a no on the tapas?”</p>
<p>“It’s a no on lunch,” James sighed. His thoughts had been revolving around Teddy all morning, questions and hypotheses distracting him from reviewing his lecture notes and pulling his focus during class. He’d promised Teddy he wouldn’t tell anyone he was back in England, and he wanted to hear more about <i>why</i> he was back before he considered breaking that promise, but he knew that if he went to lunch with his brother, he’d be telling him everything before they even got their food.</p>
<p>Albus frowned. James felt guilty.</p>
<p>“I appreciate you coming all the way out here,” he said. “Maybe we can do it next week? I’m really tired, and so swamped with work...I’ve got lectures every week now to prepare for, and I’m supposed to have a draft done by the end of the term…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just give one of those lectures?” Al asked, and James cursed his brother’s memory. “Lunch won’t take long – don’t you deserve a little break?”</p>
<p>“I can’t right now, Al. I was up way too late last night, I want to go home and take a nap.”</p>
<p>Albus furrowed his brow, suspicion clear on his face. James was asleep by eleven every night, and Albus knew it; even if he wanted to stay awake, his body shut down at a certain time of night. Once, on New Year’s, all the cousins had decided to stay up the entire night, and despite taking a nap in the afternoon in preparation and drinking three cups of coffee, James fell asleep before two in the morning.</p>
<p>“If you’re sure, James. But we should do something this weekend.”</p>
<p>James nodded. “I’m sure. And maybe? I’ve had a few new books come in, and I want to spend a good chunk of time with them.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t a complete lie – two texts he’d ordered last week had arrived, and James wanted to read them over the weekend to determine if he’d be able to use either of them in his thesis. But normally he gave himself some rest time on the weekends, and one of his favorite ways to spend that time was with Albus and Lily. Al knew that.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Al said. “I guess– owl if you need anything, yeah? And good luck with the writing.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” James said. He let Albus pull him into a hug, squeezing him tightly. “And thanks for coming by, Allie Cat. I really appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, don’t call me that,” Al said, pushing James off him. “I’m not a little kid anymore, gods.”</p>
<p>James reached out to ruffle Albus’s hair and laughed when he ducked away. “Alright, Albus Severus.” Al stuck out his tongue as he walked away. “Say hi to Scorp for me!”</p>
<p>“Fuck you, Jammy!” Al called, turning around.</p>
<p>James hefted his bag higher on his shoulder and stepped onto the footpath, heading for the one building on campus with a functional Floo. Al was worried about him, and James didn’t want him to be. He wanted very much to tell Albus everything that had happened and ask him what he thought James should do, but in their short interaction the night before, Teddy had been so jumpy that James was reluctant to do anything to break his trust, even if he was still upset with him.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>For the first time ever, when James stepped out of the Floo and into his living room, his house wasn’t silent. He hadn’t forgotten that Teddy and Dora were staying with him – he’d thought of little else all day – but he’d expected they might be out when he got home after taking himself out for lunch, or maybe holed away in the guest room.<p>Instead, the sight that greeted him when he stepped off the hearth was of Teddy sat on the floor with Dora in his lap. She was holding what James recognized as one of his metal measuring cups, and was banging it on the coffee table repeatedly, squeezing her eyes shut and scrunching her nose up every time it resulted in a loud <i>bang!</i> Teddy laughed as he watched her, but stopped when he noticed James, who’d gone to the front door to hang his jacket.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Teddy said, grabbing Dora’s hand to stop her from banging the cup again. He tried to take it out of her grasp, and she pulled her arm away, babbling at him. “I gave it to her to keep her occupied while I was making lunch, and she decided it’s her new favorite thing–” he winced as she evaded his reach and leaned forward to hit the cup against the table again.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” James said, dropping his bag on his desk chair and kicking off his shoes. “I know it’s not like I have toys, or anything for babies.” He looked at his living room, seeing all of the sharp corners and small alcoves. “Fuck, this place isn’t baby proofed at <i>all,</i>” he said, and then, “Shit, I need to stop swearing so much.”</p>
<p>Teddy laughed, shaking his head. “I went around and did the infant protection spells in most of the house this morning, I hope that’s alright,” he said. “And honestly, Dora picking up a few swear words is the least of my worries.”</p>
<p>James smiled. It was weird how normal it was, talking with Teddy, even when he hadn’t done it for years. It had always been like that before, but he’d thought the time that had passed might have changed things. Teddy looked the same as he had last night, with bags under his eyes and the brown hair that James still wasn’t used to, and he was wearing the same jeans, combined with a blue t-shirt advertising an American Quodpot team. Dora was wearing a t-shirt with a butterfly pattern on the front tucked into stretchy blue leggings, and as James watched, her hair went from strawberry blonde to sunshine yellow.</p>
<p>He sucked in a breath. “Is she a Metamorphmagus?” he asked. Somehow, even though Teddy had shown up carrying her, it hadn’t quite settled in James’s mind that she was <i>Teddy’s</i> – he hadn’t explained anything, after all, and it was a lot to wrap his head around. But Dora’s cheerful yellow hair, which Teddy was now running his hand over, put more weight behind that assumption. She had to be Teddy’s.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Teddy said, wrapping one hand around her torso. She’d grown tired of banging the measuring cup and was now sucking on the handle. Teddy gently pulled it out of her grip, replacing it with a bright green rubber ring. “She’s mine.” He looked up at James from his spot on the floor. “I know that’s what you’re wanting to ask me.”</p>
<p>James sank down onto the couch, bending one of his legs underneath him so he could face Teddy. “It’s a reasonable question, Teddy. No one knows what you’ve been up to for a decade, and then you show up at my door with a baby.”</p>
<p>Teddy nodded in acknowledgment. He ran his hands through Dora’s hair once more, pushing it back off of her forehead. She slumped against his chest, drool collecting at the corners of her mouth as she sucked on the toy.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to put her down soon,” he said. “It’s almost time for her nap. At the Portkey office they gave us a tonic for the jet lag but I’m trying not to get her too far off schedule so she can adjust.”</p>
<p>James noticed that Teddy had side-stepped his almost-question but decided not to push the issue. “How old is she?”</p>
<p>“Seven months,” Teddy said. “She was born in August.”</p>
<p>Dora pulled the toy out of her mouth and waved it up at Teddy, who took it. She sighed and rubbed her eyes, and Teddy laughed.</p>
<p>“It’s time for your nap, isn’t it,” he said. “And we’re sitting around talking about you like you’re not here. Very rude of us.” He Banished the toy and lifted Dora into his arms, standing up.</p>
<p>James stood too. “Look, if you’re going to be staying here for awhile, you probably need more stuff for her, right?” He ran a hand through his hair. “I mean, I don’t know what you brought, but I don’t have anything for kids here. Louis and Adrianna’s daughter just turned three, and I know they haven’t gotten rid of any of the baby stuff yet, but they’re not using it right now.” Teddy shook his head, opening his mouth to interrupt, and James raised a hand to stop him. “Can I ask him to borrow it? I won’t tell anyone else you’re here, I swear, and I know Louis won’t either, but if you’re going to be staying here...I at least want you both to be comfortable.”</p>
<p>Teddy seemed torn. His face creased with worry, and he looked down at Dora’s buttercup-yellow head for a long moment before he met James’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I guess that’d be okay, yeah. As long as he doesn’t tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>“I know he won’t,” James promised.</p>
<p>Teddy shifted Dora in his arms. “I need to get her down for her nap.”</p>
<p>“Right! Of course. Sorry.” James gestured behind him to the desk. “I’ll just be reading, but– you can do whatever you like, of course. Don’t let me be in the way.”</p>
<p>He rather thought Teddy might come back down after he got Dora to sleep, but he must have stayed in the guest room, because James spent the afternoon reading undisturbed. He eventually got up to make dinner, enough for two, figuring Teddy would want to join him and if he didn’t, James would just have leftovers.</p>
<p>Teddy came back down a while later, a newly-rested Dora in his arms, and thanked James for cooking. Dinnertime conversation was limited, with most of Teddy’s attention focused on feeding Dora. He offered to do the washing up, but James waved him off, and he disappeared upstairs to clean Dora’s face and didn’t return. As he fell asleep that night, it occured to James that, despite having had two polite, civil conversations with Teddy that day – a situation that had felt impossible last night when his anger had been so close to the surface – he still had no idea what or where Teddy had been during the last ten years.</p>
<p>Except that he now had a daughter.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Friday found James at his postponed meeting with Tracy, dodging her questions about what had had him so distracted the day before. He got a sandwich for lunch and spent the afternoon working in his office, unwilling to return to his house and put up with more of Teddy’s evasion. Although he’d gone to bed last night pleased about the conversations he and Teddy’d had, he’d woken up angry again. James was letting Teddy and his <i>infant daughter</i> stay with him for an undetermined amount of time, the term when he going to start his thesis, after ten years of complete radio silence from one Edward Remus Lupin.<p>It had broken James a little bit when Teddy left – he’d been fifteen and fearless, until his best friend in the world disappeared and taught him there was something to fear. Considering that, he thought it was pretty fucking big of him to let Teddy stay in the first place, although if he were honest with himself there was really no chance of him saying no. Still, he thought the least he deserved was an actual explanation from Teddy. The questions that were circling around in James’s mind wouldn’t have been that difficult to answer.</p>
<p>
  <i>Where have you been for the past ten years?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Why did you leave?</i>
</p>

  <i>Why come back now?</i>
</p>
<p>The living room was empty this time when James exited the Floo. The kitchen was dark, and he could hear footsteps on the first floor; Teddy must have been in the guest room with Dora.</p>
<p>James dropped his stuff on his desk and flicked his wand towards the kitchen, turning on the lights. He didn’t feel like cooking, but he should since he’d gone out for lunch. He wondered if Teddy would come down and eat with him again, and wished he’d stayed at the uni for longer instead. Avoiding Teddy was immature, no doubt about it, but less immature when James hadn’t done it first.</p>
<p>He was standing in the kitchen, contemplating the vegetables in his fridge, when the Floo roared to life and two familiar voices filled the living room.</p>
<p>“–never Flooing with you again!” Lily was saying, and there was a muffled <i>thud</i> that might have been her kicking off her shoes, but could have been her kicking Albus.</p>
<p>Albus raised his voice above their sister. “You <i>pushed</i> me, Lils,” he said, and then grinned when James appeared in the doorway. “James!” he said, coming to wrap his arm around James’s shoulders. “Surprise!”</p>
<p>“We brought dinner,” Lily said, holding up two plastic takeaway bags. “If it survived the trip through <i>someone’s</i> shitty Floo connection.” She dropped the food on James’s coffee table.</p>
<p>Albus rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you guys doing here? I told you I was busy…” James trailed off, eyes darting towards the stairs.</p>
<p>“We know you’re nervous about your thesis, but holing up in your house to write isn’t the way to deal with that!” Lily announced. “You can spend the rest of the weekend being boring, but tonight you’re getting Thai food and our company, and you’re going to like it!”</p>
<p>James frowned. He was touched by the thought and he wanted to tell Albus and Lily they could stay, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“You’re not allowed to make another excuse,” Al said. “You have to eat dinner regardless. We can leave right after.” Then he turned to Lily and pointed to James like he wasn’t there. “See what I mean?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “You’re right, he is acting weird.”</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Teddy appeared at the top of the stairs, pulling off a set of headphones. “James?” he said. “I can help with dinner tonight if you– oh.”</p>
<p>He stopped walking, staring down at the three of them. For a short, blessed minute, there was absolute silence.</p>
<p>Lily broke it. “What the <i>fuck</i>? What the actual fucking fuck!” she cried, turning to glare at James. “Did you know about this?”</p>
<p>“I–”</p>
<p>“Why is Teddy in your house!” Lily yelled, pointing. “What is he <i>doing here?!</i>”</p>
<p>“Is this why you wanted us to leave?” Al asked, arms crossed over his chest. “Because you didn’t want us to know?”</p>
<p>Trust Albus to always hit the nail on the head. James flushed.</p>
<p>“Teddy is staying with me for a bit,” he said, but before he could explain anything else Lily was talking over him.</p>
<p>“You left, don’t you remember?” she said, crossing her arms and glaring at Teddy. “Don’t you remember leaving with no note?” Teddy took a few halting steps down the stairs, opening his mouth, but Lily didn’t give him the chance to speak. “Dad cried when he came to school to explain it to us. And Andromeda cried at Christmas. For <i>years.</i> Don’t you–”</p>
<p>“Lily, <i>stop,</i>” James said. Teddy’s face was cracking open, and James couldn’t let it get any worse, even though everything Lily was saying was true. Her words reminded him of those terrible months when nothing made sense, when he wished every night that Teddy would come back; and the softer, sharper despair that settled in when he realized Teddy wasn’t. Teddy looked cut open, and Lily’s face was red with anger, and there wasn’t time for James to think about the past right now.</p>
<p>“Well, this is lovely,” Albus quipped. He’d sat down on the sofa and had one leg crossed over the other, watching the others like they were actors in a film.</p>
<p>“Sarcasm isn’t becoming, <i>Albus,</i>” Lily bit out.</p>
<p>Albus scowled. “Neither is yelling, Lillikins.” He turned on James. “Neither is keeping the fact that our <i>godbrother</i> is <i>staying with you</i> a <i>secret</i>–”</p>
<p>“This is why I didn’t tell you,” James said, even though it was a lie and he knew it would upset them. What was the good of being the oldest if he couldn’t play that card every once in a while? “Because I knew you would react like this–”</p>
<p>“Oh, sod off,” Lily said, throwing herself onto the sofa next to Al. “You can get off your high horse and stop pretending you aren’t just as pissed off at him–”</p>
<p>“Lily, really,” James said, trying to sound disapproving, even though his little sister was right. “You’re overreacting.”</p>
<p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake, James,” Al said. “Don’t be such a prick.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I should go,” Teddy said, the first time he’d spoken since he’d seen Lily and Albus. “This seems like–”</p>
<p>“Teddy, you’re fine–”</p>
<p>“Go where? Fuck off for another ten–”</p>
<p>“Yeah, James has some explaining–”</p>
<p>All three Potters fell silent when Dora began to cry.</p>
<p>Teddy pinked, a sight James couldn’t ever remember having seen before. Usually it was Teddy’s hair that changed color in response to his emotions, or at least it had been before he got too good at controlling it. But there was no mistaking the blush on his cheeks, while his hair remained that same stubborn brown.</p>
<p>“That’s–my daughter,” he said, the words falling clumsily out of his mouth. “She must have woken up. I should…” he cast a stricken look at James before turning and running up the stairs.</p>
<p>It was Albus who spoke first this time.</p>
<p>“He’s got a daughter?” Al and Lily were staring at James as though he had the answers, but he really didn’t. He never had, to be honest, even though he’d gotten good at faking it over the years.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” James said. “Her name is Dora. She’s seven months old.” He paused for a moment. “She likes to have yellow hair.”</p>
<p>Despite her anger from a few minutes ago, Lily was now frowning at James, face sympathetic. She gestured him over to the sofa and he sank down between his siblings.</p>
<p>“He showed up Wednesday night,” James said. “I thought it was you, Al, coming to apologize for missing lunch, and there he was, standing at my door with a fucking <i>baby</i> in his arms.” Albus squeezed his shoulder, and James smiled. “And he asked if he could stay with me, and told me not to tell anyone, and…” he sighed, tilting his head back. Lily rested her head on his other shoulder, and her hair tickled his chin. “He hasn’t told me anything about where he’s been, or what he’s been doing, or anything about Dora except that she’s his. I don’t even know how he found my address. But what was I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>Albus snorted. “Well, obviously you weren’t gonna tell him no. We know you better than that.”</p>
<p>James frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“You’re ride or die,” Lily said. “And you’ve always loved Teddy. That means something to you.” She reached an arm around his chest and hugged him. “You’re better at people than us, Jamesy.”</p>
<p>James blinked back the tears that wanted to well up. “Well, I was in Gryffindor,” he said, which at least made them laugh.</p>
<p>Lily propped her foot up on the table, pushing at the bags with her toe. “Are you gonna kick us out now?” she said. “Because I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>“That depends, are you gonna yell at Teddy again when he comes down to eat with us?”</p>
<p>Albus muttered. “Does he have to?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s called being polite,” James said. “And dinner last night was awkward as fuck, so if you could just refrain from screaming and hang out for a bit, I’d appreciate it. And don’t tell anyone Teddy’s here.”</p>
