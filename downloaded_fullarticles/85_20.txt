I'm hiding in plain sight, thought Harry with a little huff of amusement, his glamoured fingers curled squat and hairy on the muggle newspaper resting on his lap and his memories winding back to countless daring exploits when he was anything but in plain sight, unseen beneath his invisibility cloak back in the days of Hogwarts and Voldemort.</p><p>Regent's Park was a tranquil oasis, with a gentle trickle of people strolling or jogging along the wide path; it felt a million miles away from the bustle of the city streets and the crowds pouring in and out of London Zoo. It was an unlikely place for a stake-out, but if Harry's informant was correct then there just might be a glimpse of elusive potion smugglers making a trade. It was a long shot at best and the itch building at Harry's hairline told him his disguise was close to disintegration. It seemed he would have to return on another day.</p><p>He folded the newspaper in a deliberate manner in keeping with his current staid appearance and sat forward, directing his gaze idly at the benches spaced along the path. His upright position brought into view a figure seated a couple of benches further down, previously partially obscured by a young mother and the vast, cushioned sides of her state-of-the-art stroller. Something about the man caught his eye; perhaps it was the black leather jacket, cut in a style that had often tempted Harry to part with a fair few galleons, or perhaps it was the general air of depression somehow conveyed by the man's posture, sitting forwards as he was with his elbows resting on the knees of his long jean-clad legs, hands hanging loose and the curl of smoke from a forgotten cigarette rising up past his lowered head. More likely though, it was the colour of his hair, so blond it was almost white when the sun peeked through the leaves and danced across it, seeming to set it ablaze with a silver-gold fire.</p><p>Despite its physical beauty, that pale hair caused a cold shiver to run down Harry's spine, bringing to mind the smooth slide of Lucius Malfoy's blond mane against his cloak, and the slicked back shine of the younger Malfoy's head on that very first day at Hogwarts. "You don't want to be making friends with the wrong sort." Those words had been the start of years of enmity that sputtered out in a molten puddle of confusion and fear around about the time of the fiendfyre.</p><p>Harry shook himself mentally; Malfoys didn't wear jeans and boots and slouch on park benches in the middle of the day, not even in Royal Parks.</p><p>The man's shoulders moved uneasily, almost as though he felt the weight of Harry's stare. He took a final drag on his cigarette before dropping it to the floor and crushing it beneath the sole of his boot. Long fingers ran through wind tousled hair and the man stood, the gracefulness of the movement blurring as he hunched his shoulders and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. He walked slowly past the bench, the gaze from his silver-grey eyes drifting over Harry's false facade of portly middle-age and moving on, uninterested.</p><p>Harry caught his breath, surprise clenching in his chest. The gaunt teenager who had been the bane of his student life at Hogwarts was no more. Bony shoulders that had held promise now showed the strength and breadth of a man, and legs that were long and skinny now revealed a play of lean muscle beneath denim. The haggard, exhausted face of war had filled out and smoothed, jawbone stronger, with the symmetrical facial curves of the young boy on the steps of Hogwarts still visible but now honed into the elegance of adulthood. It was unmistakably Draco Malfoy.</p><p>For a moment Harry was frozen, with the shock of the unexpected encounter stealing strength from his limbs. Then his thoughts were tumbling; how, why was the boy...man... here? Was it a coincidence? Was Malfoy involved with the potion smugglers? It seemed unlikely he would need to stoop to such activities, but who knew what an ex-Death Eater did for a living.</p><p>Pushing himself to his feet, Harry strode after him, remembering to walk with a ponderous gait and fervently wishing that the legs of his disguise were as long as his real ones. Malfoy drew steadily further ahead, until the path twisted and turned through some bushes and he disappeared from sight. By the time Harry got to other side of the leafy screen, the arch-enemy of his school years was gone. He dashed through a wrought iron gate onto the street, cursing, only to be brought to an abrupt standstill by the harsh blatter of a big motorcycle. Malfoy swept past him, curled over the handlebars so he appeared as one with the machine. He rode like he flew, thought Harry, full of arrogance and natural grace and thumbing his nose at the world.</p><p>...</p><p>2 days later. </p><p>Draco walked quietly, keeping to the shadows, their darkness matching his mood of prevailing depression. He had sensed he was being followed at the station, picking up two faint ripples of magical energy as he stepped onto the platform. It was enough of a trace to be certain they were wizards, but weak enough that they were quickly lost in the bustling hum of humanity in the concourse.</p><p>It wasn't Potter, of that much he was sure; he always knew when it was Potter. After all, the Gryffindor had spent years following him around, and the familiar vibration of his magic that announced his presence was individual and unmistakable. It was a vibration he hadn't felt for a long time and had thought he would never feel again, until two days before when he'd suddenly become aware of the familiar ripple trailing behind him. </p><p>Now, Draco moved cautiously along the street, not sure if he'd shaken off his pursuers. It was becoming more frequent, this deadly dance of pursuit and threat. Day by day it wore him down, stress chipping away at his fragile defences and combining with the exhaustion of nightmare-ridden nights to drag him ever deeper into despair. He had no real means to protect himself, not with his wand seized and a ministerial ban against his use of magic. So Draco slipped through the night, avoiding the circles of light beneath the street lamps, feeling alone and vulnerable, no longer sure why he was bothering to run from a fate that seemed inevitable.</p><p>Ahead of him lay one of the civic buildings that were common in that area of the city. It was closed for the night and shrouded in darkness apart from the artfully angled pools of light that illuminated fancy curlicues of stone and pillars carved in the style of Ancient Greece. The shadows that lay between and behind the pillars were dense and it was to these that Draco headed. If he could reach the far side of the building, it would be possible to cut across the dark swathe of grass that lay at its rear, scale a low wall and lose his pursuers in the rabbit warren of streets beyond.</p><p>He moved swiftly, had reached the top of a short flight of stone steps when he heard the scuff of a shoe against pavement behind him, much closer than expected. There was no time to react before the curse hit him between the shoulder blades, its impact so great that he was thrown forwards and down. His natural agility, honed by years of Seeker training, enabled him to tuck into a defensive position as he fell. If it hadn't been for the pillar at the bottom of the steps there was a fair chance that he would have rolled, recovered himself and attempted an escape. As it was, although he threw himself as much to the side in mid-flight as possible, the tip of his left shoulder slammed into the upright structure, and in turn that physical impact altered his trajectory enough that his temple met with the stone with an audible crack. Without making a sound, he sprawled onto the cold slabs behind the pillar, limbs splayed in a boneless manner and only the glimmer of his pale hair visible in the shadows. </p><p>There was a whoop of excitement in the street and the sound of running feet that had no further cause to be stealthy. </p><p>"You got him!" </p><p>The taller of the two men took the steps in a hurry, the faint light emitted from the end of his wand showing Draco's crumpled figure.</p><p>"You bastard!"</p><p>He poked his victim none too gently with the toe of his shoe and addediin a venemous tone, "And now you pay!" </p><p>"What you going to do to him, Al?"</p><p>His companion's voice was high-pitched with nerves, as though his enjoyment of the pursuit had been spoiled by the capture of the prey.</p><p>"Give him this...and this!"</p><p>A dull thudding accompanied Al's words as he set to with feet and fists.</p><p>The nervous grin on the second man's face gradually faded, replaced by an uneasy frown. He stepped forwards cautiously and sent a small ball of light to hover over the proceedings. When the ferocity of the attack was revealed to him, he shuffled anxiously.</p><p>"Hey mate, I think he's had enough there." </p><p>Al snarled, bloodlust in his eyes.</p><p>"I haven't even started yet. Remember what his lot did to my Abbie?"</p><p>"Wasn't him though."</p><p>The shorter man took a few hesitant steps away.</p><p>"They're all locked up in Azkaban." </p><p>His companion ignored him and pawed at Draco's prone figure, rolling him face down on the slabs. Blood gleamed dark and wet in the pale hair and the shorter man abruptly extinguished the ball of light, his voice wavering. </p><p>"I don't want to get involved in this."</p><p>He waited apprehensively a minute or two longer, until the muffled sounds coming from the shadows drew nauseating pictures in his mind. Then, with a final sound of protest, he withdrew.</p>
