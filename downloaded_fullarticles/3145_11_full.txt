    <p>
  <span>Witch Weekly’s building sat on a street that crossed the Diagon Alley, overlooking a store of Quidditch supplies. The giant window on Rita Skeeter’s office made it so that her involuntary backdrop was filled with the latest models of brooms and the Quaffles with the softest leather. Lily always observed them every time she sat on the uncomfortable chair, waiting for a verdict.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watched anxiously as her boss’ long fingernails drummed on the parchment sheet, scratching the words she had carefully written. Rita’s nails were always the same colour as her glasses, which she kept fidgeting with as she read Lily’s article. Today, they were bright pink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, Lily, dear…” Rita started, giving Lily a tight-lipped smile that did nothing to warm her features, her deep-set eyes looking at the younger woman with impatience. “You know that I respect your work as journalist. You are a gifted writer, I have told you that, and a success with our readers,” she continued, picking up the pieces of parchment scattered at her desk that Lily had handed to her moments before, always foolishly hoping that maybe, </span>
  <em>
    <span>this time</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Rita would consider publishing them. “But I have already explained to you. Our readers here at Witch Weekly are not interested in the sort of content you want to write about,” Rita finished, just as someone who gives the same speech over and over, and handed over the stack of parchment to Lily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what about this one, though?” Lily asked, frantically pulling a piece of parchment from the stack and putting it back on the table in front of Skeeter. “It’s about Fashion!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rita frowned and picked up the parchment, skimming through it quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s about the meaning behind the details in Wizarding robes and their similarities to Muggle clothing,” Rita said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, yes,” answered Lily. “Don’t you think it’s interesting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think, as I have said before, that our readers </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t care.</span>
  </em>
  <span> They just want to know what’s on trend,” Rita sighed. “Now, can I trust you to get back to writing your new column, Lily dear?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Lily answered, casting her eyes down as she stood up, feeling defeated once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as she stepped out of Skeeter’s office, Marlene was waiting for her just outside the door, arms crossed as her tall frame leaned against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So…?” Marlene asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No luck. Again,” Lily answered. “Witch Weekly readers are not interested in any journalistic pieces about politics, society, economy, education, Wizarding vs. Muggle issues, or even culture. At least according to Skeeter, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course!” Marlene repeated as she rolled her eyes, her disdain for their boss clear in her tone of voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you didn’t wait outside the office just to see my articles get rejected again. So what’s going on?” Lily asked, knowing her friend had an ulterior motive for seeking her out like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marlene made a face, biting her bottom lip. Guilty as charged. “Sorry, darling,” she admitted it, and Lily smiled and nodded for her to continue. “It’s Alice. I think it was that Elian bloke? You’re the only that knows how to deal with her properly when she’s like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily nodded again, grabbing Marlene’s hand and walking purposefully. “Men’s room, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Marlene answered, her voice slightly out of breath as both women’s heels clacked noisily on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Witch Weakly hadn’t had a male reporter in the last four years, which turned the men’s bathroom into a lounging area for females in crisis. Lily and Marlene both had only used the space once - Lily after getting a  rejection letter from a newspaper, and Marlene after getting into a fight with an old colleague - but sadly, Alice was a frequent presence in the little room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Lily and Marlene arrived at the door, they found Alice sitting in a comfortable chair, her tear-streaked face illuminated by the sun rays that entered through the small window and upturned chin, her wand hand raised high as she conjured up plates and either broke them with a silent </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bombarda</span>
  </em>
  <span> or threw them at the green tiled wall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hi, Lily dear!” She said, smiling softly when she noticed the two women at the door. “I see Marley went to get you. So silly. Just cause I am letting off some steam here. I told her not to bother you at your big meeting!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t a big meeting, Al. Just the same old stuff, don’t worry. Marlene only called me cause she was worried about you. What happened?” Lily asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span>, really…” answered Alice, but then she hurled another plate at the wall. Lily sent a look Marlene’s way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice, it’s okay, darling. You can tell us,” Marlene assured her, looking her in the eyes as Lily ran her hand in her friend’s pixie’s locks in a soothing manner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just thought we were such a good couple! I thought we were doing so well!” Alice started, burying her face in Marlene’s stomach. “Then… </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘too bloody domineering, won’t give me space, thinks she’s so smart and powerful, redecorating my house.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>- All I did was buy him a Wiggentree, by the way!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long were you two together?” Marlene asked? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Around three weeks?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Marlene said.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Alice snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think what Marlene meant is that not all men can be this intense early in the relationship? I know it’s stupid, sweetheart, but it scares them,” Lily tried to explain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, I scare them away alright!” Alice swallowed bitterly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Al, that’s not what I meant! You’re amazing! Maybe you’re just not showing yourself in the best way. If these guys really knew you, not one of them would be able to stay away,” Lily said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re saying that because no guy would ever stay away from you,” Alice replied pointedly. “I mean, look at you!”she added, jabbing her chin at Lily’s face and following the trail down her body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about? You’re so beautiful! If we weren’t like sisters, I’d definitely date you,” Lily answered, earning a soft laugh from Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep, me too,” agreed Marlene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, it’s all just silly things. If it happened to me, you can bet those guys wouldn’t be with me either. And they’re stupid anyhow,” Lily continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Crisis averted?” Marlene asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay,” Alice smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yay!” Marlene celebrated. “Great, cause we have the staff meeting in ten.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James wasn’t sure if he’d rather take a stunning spell from Sirius for commandeering his precious bike that morning, or from his own wand for having to listen to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bertha Jorkins </span>
  </em>
  <span>drone on and on about the latest Witch Weekly article.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he had taken the job at Cuffe and Company, a broomstick designing and manufacturing corporation, he strongly suspected that Barnabas Cuffe (the man who took over the company years before after his father had passed) had purposely shoved Bertha in the back of the office on the day of his interview, for she was the only con James could possibly think of for working for the establishment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“- it’s important that we hit </span>
  <em>
    <span>all </span>
  </em>
  <span>demographics. Quidditch isn’t solely for the male gender, and we should make sure that we are advertising correctly to our female audience as well as the male when it comes to our brooms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And </span>
  <em>
    <span>Witch Weekly </span>
  </em>
  <span>is going to help us do that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James knew better than to engage - </span>
  <em>
    <span>ought </span>
  </em>
  <span>to have known better than to engage - but he couldn’t take a magazine seriously that had the title </span>
  <em>
    <span>10 Spells To Get Your Man Hot and Bothered </span>
  </em>
  <span> practically glaring at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, </span>
  </em>
  <span>James,” sighed Bertha. She was</span>
  <em>
    <span> always</span>
  </em>
  <span> doing that. Sighing after she said his name as though he were an ignorant child. “Women are </span>
  <em>
    <span>different. </span>
  </em>
  <span>More </span>
  <em>
    <span>complex -”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“About </span>
  <em>
    <span>Quidditch?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“About </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything. </span>
  </em>
  <span>And you don’t know the correct way to advertise to them, the correct way to </span>
  <em>
    <span>target them - “</span>
  </em>
</p><p>

    <span>“It’s Quidditch!”</span>

    <span>Holyhead Harpies,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>countered Bertha, popping him on the nose with the rolled up magazine as though he were a dog. James thought fleetingly that it smelled strongly of flowery perfume, causing his eyes to water slightly. “The only </span>
  <em>
    <span>all witch </span>
  </em>
  <span>Quidditch team in the league.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that got to do with anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s got </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything </span>
  </em>
  <span>to do with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James inwardly groaned, his features twisting and scowling in a way only </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bertha Jorkins </span>
  </em>
  <span>could accomplish. Ever since they had landed the Holyhead Harpies’ account, the witch had gone practically bonkers at the thought of heading the project. Insisting that she was the </span>
  <em>
    <span>only one </span>
  </em>
  <span>with the capability to do so, being as she was the </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> woman at Cuffe and Company. James wondered, perhaps ignorantly so, what </span>
  <em>
    <span>gender </span>
  </em>
  <span>could possibly have to do with something as universal as Quidditch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I was </span>
  <em>
    <span>saying - </span>
  </em>
  <span>women are different. The way we straddle a broom, the way we take to the air, the way we </span>
  <em>
    <span>fly </span>
  </em>
  <span>is different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“How?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t understand,” sighed Bertha dramatically, though James suspected she herself didn’t fully understand. “You aren’t well versed when it comes to women.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>plenty </span>
  </em>
  <span>versed when it comes to women.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bertha arched a perfectly crafted eyebrow up at him. “When’s the last time you went on a date, James? You’re always stuck in here. Designing and testing brooms into the early hours of the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t that make me </span>
  <em>
    <span>more </span>
  </em>
  <span>qualified to head this account?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That makes you qualified in </span>
  <em>
    <span>brooms,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>smirked Bertha. She shook her head up at him as his hand twitched to run itself through his hair in frustration.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “Not </span>
  </em>
  <span>in women.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James wanted to ask if there was really a difference, but thought better of it as he took in the rolled up magazine in her right hand. Bertha may be rubbish with a wand, but she had a mean Beaters arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is </span>
  <em>
    <span>mad,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he said instead. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Completely mad!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Bertha grinned, twisting a blonde curl around her finger. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Women </span>
  </em>
  <span>are mad. In a beautiful sort of way and you simply wouldn’t understand. We have our meeting with Cuffe soon. Leave the account to me.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>All the reporters had to help each other up the floating seats in the circular meeting room, the taller girls lending a hand to their shorter colleagues. They were terribly inconvenient, these seats, but Rita thought they added to the </span>
  <span><em>ambiance</em>, so there was no getting rid of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, dears. Who’d like to start?” Rita prompted, starting the meeting. A bouncy girl with dirty-blonde hair raised her hand high in the air, causing Lily, Alice, and Marlene to trade looks and stifle a laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, lovely, miss Talkalot! Please, begin,” the older witch nodded, giving the other permission to talk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve got some wonderful articles this week!” Lucinda Talkalot, features editor and the biggest kiss-arse Lily knew started talking. “We have one about a facemask potion that promises to reduce 10 years of your face! It’s very upbeat. There’s an interview with that amazing author, Gilderoy Lockhart. He’s such an upbeat person, and</span>
  <em>
    <span> so dreamy!</span>
  </em>
  <span> There’s also one about how household  spells can go horribly wrong and cause permanent damage if you don’t perform them correctly. It’s a bit scary, but surprisingly upbeat!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t wait to read </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” mocked Alice in a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Personally, I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>dreaming </span>
  </em>
  <span>of reading Gilderoy’s interview! Lucky Lucinda!” teased Marlene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about you, Allie dear?” Skeeter asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry?” Alice asked dumbly, realizing they must have missed her wrapping things up with Talkalot in their teasing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your story this week? For the fitness session?” Rita said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I-I haven’t-” Alice fumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice has had some romantic problems,” Lily intervened. She hated to expose her friend’s private life like that, but she knew it was the only thing Rita would accept.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I am so sorry, Allie dear! But you know what, you can use it! Write about </span>
  <em>
    <span>that!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rita enthusiastically proposed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rita, I’m sorry. I can’t,” Alice replied, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s okay, I understand” said Rita, pushing her platinum blonde hair away from her face and crossing her legs. “Who wants to write about Alice’s love life?” she continued, promoting Lucinda Talkalot to raise her hand even more enthusiastically than the first time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll stun that woman someday, I swear,” Marlene uttered under her breath, just as Lily shouted </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ll do it!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> causing all the heads to turn to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll kind of do it. I mean, let’s look at Alice. She’s a smart, funny, talented witch. Very beautiful. But she’s always having trouble with men, why is that? We all make silly mistakes when dating that scare other people off, our readers surely do too -</span>
  <em>
    <span> that’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>what I’ll write about. It’ll be a guiding hand. Sort of a dating manual, but backwards,” Lily explained. The idea had come to her suddenly as she was speaking, and she embraced it with all her heart. It was a welcome reprieve from all the mind-numbing </span>
  <em>
    <span>How to Curl Your Hair with 10 Different Spells </span>
  </em>
  <span>articles she usually had to write, and exactly the sort of thing her boss would love. Maybe,</span>
  <em>
    <span> just maybe</span>
  </em>
  <span>, if she played this right, she could get into Rita’s good graces and one or two steps closer to writing what she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> to do,” Rita added, with a glint in her green eyes. For the first time, she seemed absolutely ecstatic about an idea Lily pitched her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Just the basic stuff you shouldn’t do at the start of a relationship!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you be dating someone in real time? I think it’s important for us to actually test these theories…” Rita asked, with a hint of challenge in her voice and Lily instantly felt like rising to it. It was only ten days, she would drive him crazy before he ever felt anything close to attraction for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely! I could start by dating a guy and then drive him away, but only using the classic mistakes most witches make early in the relationship,” Lily said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How to lose a wizard in ten days!” her boss announced gleefully with a big hand gesture, as if showing a big sign.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, hm, sorry, why ten days?” Lily asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, a week is too short and we go to press at eleven,” Rita answered. “What about you, Claire, tell us what you’ve got,” she continued, closing the subject and sealing Lily’s (and some poor wizard’s)  fate for the next ten days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was that okay?” Lily whispered to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you kidding me?”her friend answered. “We are gonna have so much fun.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“- let me get this straight, </span>
  <em>
    <span>she </span>
  </em>
  <span>wants to take the lead? Bertha? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bertha Jorkins? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Who can’t even get a broom off the ground?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who can’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>mount </span>
  </em>
  <span>a broom because she’s always wearing a pencil skirt underneath her robes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who only got hired here because her legs are longer than a broomstick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, Sirius.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who can’t even -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Yes, Sirius!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James paused, the snitch that he was playing with moments ago fluttering inches in front of his face as he pocketed his hands in his robes. Annoyed and a bit more than put off about the whole situation, he had immediately dragged Sirius into his office with him to formulate a plan. Or perhaps a prank. But the only person more dramatic than James himself was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius Black. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, what are we going to do?” huffed Sirius. “This is a big account. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Huge. </span>
  </em>
  <span>We can’t lose it to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jorkins.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know that, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius.” James groaned, removing his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose. “We need a plan. Or - or </span>
  <em>
    <span>something.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have a couple Dungbombs in my desk.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That could wor- </span>
  <em>
    <span>no, no! </span>
  </em>
  <span>We need to actually be </span>
  <em>
    <span>smart </span>
  </em>
  <span>about this and find a way to get that account.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius snorted. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Smart? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Us? I don’t normally associate that word with us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>plenty </span>
  </em>
  <span>smart-“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clever, conniving, ambitious-“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just describing it another way!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Handsome,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>said Sirius before his eyes flicked quickly over James. “Well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>one </span>
  </em>
  <span>of us at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you my best mate? I could do so much better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius grinned. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Could </span>
  </em>
  <span>you though?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been taking a page out of Jorkin’s book?” James eyes narrowed. And then they brightened. “Maybe we </span>
  <em>
    <span>should </span>
  </em>
  <span>take a page out of her book.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius quirked an eyebrow. “What are you on about, Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long do we have until the meeting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About an hour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect, hand me some parchment and a quill.” James rubbed his hands together, something he often did before he turned chaos to creation. “I’ve got an idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dungbombs later?” asked Sirius hopefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dungbombs later,” agreed James with a grin. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meeting for the Harpies’ account was well underway by the time James burst into Cuffe’s office with enough force to cause a portrait of Cuffe Senior to crash to the floor, cursing all the while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ hands, all the way up to his forearms were smudged with ink from leaning over his desk. Something that often happened when he suffered from a breakthrough. He called it suffering because he had charmed his ink not to disappear after a prank gone wrong with Sirius during the </span>
  <em>
    <span>broom brigade of 2007, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and he hadn’t been able to produce a counter charm leading to tons of previous good shirts being tossed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ink would fade with time, but no matter how hard James scrubbed his body down each night a faint black tint would remain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoops,” he cringed, looking down at the doorknob that was smudged with ink. “Sorry about that. It’ll come off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t a </span>
  <em>
    <span>total </span>
  </em>
  <span>lie. It would. As soon as James could put down broom designing for a spare second to figure out the counter charm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Never mind that,” coughed Cuffe, though he eyed the smear with disdain. “Sit, sit! Both of you! The meeting started ten minutes ago! Bertha was just telling me about an idea she had.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grinned, the motion of it spreading upwards and tickling his eyes. “Was she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he wasn’t out of the game.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> was,” said Jorkins, her eyes cutting to the parchment in James’ hand and narrowing. “I was just telling Mr. Cuffe how as the </span>
  <em>
    <span>only female </span>
  </em>
  <span>staff member at Cuffe and Company, the Harpies would likely be delighted to have a fellow female in charge of their brooms for the next Quidditch season.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh really?” asked James. The familiar feeling of incredibly stupid Gryffindor bravery was pounding in his chest, threatening to burst through at any moment. “So what was your idea then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That - that </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>my idea,” said Jorkins, though she turned to look at Cuffe as if she wasn’t sure. “That I would lead the account with my design team.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, brilliant. So I haven’t missed too much then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jorkins made a sound akin to a snarl that caused her features to twist and curl, the nails on her fingers digging into the silk fabric of her robes and James suspected they had to be a bit painful since she had just gotten them done. They looked a bit sharp, being waved underneath his nose as they frequently were.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Down boy,” scolded Cuffe, though a laugh followed, booming and bouncing around on the walls of his office. “Bertha has a fine point. The Harpies may be more comfortable with a woman taking the lead, but let’s hear what you’ve got to say, Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not so much what I have to </span>
  <em>
    <span>say </span>
  </em>
  <span>as what I have to </span>
  <em>
    <span>show </span>
  </em>
  <span>you,” said James, handing over the parchment to Cuffe. His leg was jiggling with such force that it was vibrating his seat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this?” Cuffe’s interest was peaked. James could tell by the way he stroked his beard and leaned against his desk, taking the glasses from the top of his head and adjusting them in front of his eyes for a better look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jorkins’ head craned painfully around to try to catch a glance, her long neck doing nothing to support her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a broom,” said James. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cuffe snorted. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Clearly. </span>
  </em>
  <span>I can see that, boy. But tell me about her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She doesn’t have a name just yet,” said James, lifting himself up to stand by Cuffe. His fingers traced the features. “She’s sleek, </span>
  <em>
    <span>slimmer </span>
  </em>
  <span>that any model we’ve ever had before. Able to be easily moved into any dive or round any curve that’s thrown at her. The rest for the rider’s feet sits down lower than any model I’ve ever seen so that the rider is able to lean down closer to the broom, guiding every movement with precision and ensuring that we aren’t sacrificing safety for speed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cuffe made a sound of approval and James grinned as it echoed around the walls and rattles around in his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s got a dip just </span>
  <em>
    <span>here,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>James pressed on, allowing his finger to dip for effect “on the broomhandle to allow for a more effective grip while leaning so low. The handle itself is made of mahogany, while the twigs are hazel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well need to work on her speed charms,” considered Cuffe. He was teetering. The slightest little </span>
  <em>
    <span>push</span>
  </em>
  <span> was all James needed. Jorkins’ face was bright red. “She’s gotta have momentum behind all that glamour.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’ll have speed,” said James. “No doubt about that. She’ll be unbeatable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She sure is a beauty,” admired Cuffe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s pretty </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>effective. Just like the Harpies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seemingly unable to take it anymore, Jorkins let out a howl that caused both men in the room to jump. Standing so quickly that she sent her chair toppling over, she rounded on James.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You!” She pointed her finger accusingly, waggling in right in front of James’ nose as he crossed his eyes at a now chipped nail and smirked. “What do </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>know about women and what they want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, when it comes to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Quidditch,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>said James, smuggly, “I assume everyone has the same goal in mind. </span>
  <em>
    <span>To win.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think that’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>all </span>
  </em>
  <span>women care about? The Harpies can win </span>
  <em>
    <span>without </span>
  </em>
  <span>the latest model broom-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t our job </span>
  <em>
    <span>to </span>
  </em>
  <span>design them the latest model broom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“- because they have </span>
  <em>
    <span>pure talent. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Have you actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>talked </span>
  </em>
  <span>to a woman about this broom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, no. I was too busy </span>
  <em>
    <span>designing </span>
  </em>
  <span>it.” James noticed Cuffe’s gaze turn towards Jorkins who noticed it as well as she gestured towards James with an angry arm while looking at the older man as if to say, </span>
  <em>
    <span>see! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Teeter, teeter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James felt the sale tilt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No </span>
  <em>
    <span>actual </span>
  </em>
  <span>woman’s input,” huffed Jorkins. “How very </span>
  <em>
    <span>shocking. </span>
  </em>
  <span>When’s the last time you actually talked a woman, James?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>talk </span>
  </em>
  <span>to women!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Your mother </span>
  </em>
  <span>doesn’t count!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright,” boomed Cuffe. He stretched his arms out between the two of them, James’ nameless broom fluttering in front of his face. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>both </span>
  </em>
  <span>have a point. James, this is a fine broom, but Bertha is right. You ought to get a woman’s opinion on it -“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jorkins smirked triumphantly. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Exactly! </span>
  </em>
  <span>And I would be more than happy to -“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, hold on there Bertha.” Cuffe took another look at the parchment. One last beard stroke. “I think James might benefit from a woman’s opinion, but a woman on the </span>
  <em>
    <span>outside, </span>
  </em>
  <span>you see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“The outside-“</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“The outside-“</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Jorkins glared at each other for voicing the same thought at the same time. Though perhaps two different branches of it. Jorkins no doubt was furious at being cast aside, and James wasn’t sure if he actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew </span>
  </em>
  <span>any women outside of Jorkins and his mother. Not that he would ever tell Jorkins that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you would be a fair eye, Bertha my dear,” said Cuffe. He handed the parchment back to James, who took it in near defeat. “So here’s my proposal. We don’t have to put this broom into design until after Christmas. Potter, I want you to go out and find a woman, an </span>
  <em>
    <span>opinionated </span>
  </em>
  <span>woman when it comes to Quidditch, and I want to see her alongside of you at our annual Christmas party-“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James’ eyes went wide. “But -“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to hear </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>opinion on this broom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our Christmas party is in ten days!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s plenty of time to find a woman,” said Cuffe, smacking James across the back and nearly causing him to stumble forward. “Plenty of time, my boy! Now off! Both of you! I have my morning afternoon meeting coming up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Jorkins walked out, silent and matching each other’s paces, the clicking of Jorkin’s heels the only sound down the corridor. Cuffe’s afternoon </span>
  <em>
    <span>meeting </span>
  </em>
  <span>was with the loo, otherwise James was certain Jorkins would have had more to say on the whole matter. They were nearly to their adjacent offices when she rounded on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think you’re so </span>
  <em>
    <span>clever,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>she sneered. “Don’t you, Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When it comes to Quidditch, </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James folded the parchment, placing it along with his hands in his pockets as Jorkins craned her neck upward at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cuffe made a deal with you, but I have one of my own.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what would that be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This girl - this mysterious girl that you’re somehow going to find in ten days. When you bring her to the party, I want you to bring her as </span>
  <em>
    <span>your date.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>James quirked an eyebrow. Easy enough. “Okay? Done. Deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not all. When she comes, I want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>see it.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“See what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The </span>
  <em>
    <span>spark. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The look in her eyes.” Jorkins huffed when James still didn’t understand. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Love, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Potter. I want you to make her fall in love with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James scoffed. “How in the bloody hell am I supposed to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Make </span>
  </em>
  <span>it happen. And I’ll hand the account over to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jorkins held her hand out to James as an offering and James’ own fingers twitched to take it. The thought of toying with a woman’s feelings conflicting with his desire to design a broom used for professional Quidditch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jorkins seemed to sense his hesitation and her lips twisted into a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do it,” she said. “Make this girl fall in love with you and the Harpies account is yours. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yours. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Imagine - </span>
  <em>
    <span>your broom </span>
  </em>
  <span>used by one of the league's top Quidditch teams.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James was certain that he heard an audible </span>
  <em>
    <span>snap </span>
  </em>
  <span>inside his head at her words and then next thing he knew he was gripping Jorkin’s hand tightly. “Deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t until the had shaken on it, Jorkins digging her nails into James’ palm with such force that he felt tears prickling at his eyes, that he realized what he had just done. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t an Unbreakable Vow, but as James watched Jorkins disappear into her office, stopping to smirk at him before she shut the door fully, he knew that this bet would have similar repercussions if lost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James ran a hand through his hair, ruffling it as he stepped into his office where he found a very bored looking Sirius Black throwing a Quaffle around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” inquired Sirius when he noticed James. The Quaffle, forgotten by his mate, crashed unceremoniously onto James’ desk, knocking over a photograph of James’ Quidditch days at Hogwarts. “How did it go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The good news is we’re still in the game,” sighed James. “The bad news is that the rules have drastically changed.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, fuck,” Marlene pronounced eloquently, shamelessly looking at Lily’s cleavage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know!” agreed Alice. “I told her she should let them out more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello to you too, Marley,” Lily said, rolling her eyes and stealing a sip of Marlene’s butterbeer. The Three Broomsticks was packed tonight, magical bodies with mundane thoughts on a common, busy Friday night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just figured that since I’m going to spend ten days with this bloke, I should make sure he’s fit,” she pointed out, adjusting the strap of her dress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I also managed to convince her not to fly here tonight, which means her hair isn’t a tangled mess!” Alice added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ladies!” interrupted a young man from behind the counter. “You two finally arrived. I was beginning to think Marlene here was flying solo tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Benjy!” Lily smiled, bending over the counter to kiss him quickly on the cheek. As Alice did the same, Marlene answered with a quick wave “Oh please, Benjy. As if I would need to drink alone. We’re here for Lily tonight. Completely focused on a mission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so? Do tell,” asked the young wizard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Merlin…” Lily grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The usual first, please, Benjy,” Alice asked sweetly. “We need to be prepared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coming right up!”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Sirius had first brought up the idea of going to the Three Broomsticks to both celebrate getting the account early with a few drinks while also scouting for a woman for James to woo, James had outright refused.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt as though they were jinxing themselves since they hadn’t even landed the account just yet, and he had a horrible headache from dealing with </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jorkins</span>
  </em>
  <span> all day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had a war waging daily between them, he and Bertha Jorkins did. Each day that he walked out of the office, he had a mental tick mark that he placed in either his box or hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And today he wasn’t honestly sure </span>
  <em>
    <span>who </span>
  </em>
  <span>had won between the two of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She certainly hadn’t landed the account, but then again, neither had he. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But more than that - more than the account, more than Jorkins, more than the blasted </span>
  <em>
    <span>deal </span>
  </em>
  <span>he had going with </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> Cuffe and Jorkins - James was afraid to go out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because Jorkins was right about one thing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He simply wasn’t well versed when it came to women, and he wasn’t sure that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be well versed in the type of women that hung out at the Three Broomsticks on a Friday night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as he adjusted his glasses, flattened out his red v-neck shirt for the hundredth, and patted the pocket of his jeans where the design of his nameless broom rested, he knew that he had no real choice in the matter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready?” asked Sirius, leaning against the door frame with a sort of ease that James could never master. He was wearing a leather jacket, and James thought he looked like a bit of an arse in it. “It’s honestly not going to get any better the longer you look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready,” sighed James, running his hand through his hair.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about the one on the end of the counter?” pointed Alice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, cute,” agreed Lily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And </span>
  <em>
    <span>married,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> thwarted Benjy. “How about green shirt over there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Meh. He’s okay looking. Terrible fashion sense though. And very loud. Not very polite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about the blond one on the big table there?”Alice proposed again, laughing this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now you’re just fucking with me. Which is terribly rude, cause I’m doing this for </span>
  <em>
    <span>you,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Al.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spectacles,” said Marlene, bumping Lily on her shoulder, a little smirk in her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily blinked. “Sorry?”</span>
</p><p><span>“Spectacles,</span><em><span> I-just-had-sex-hair</span></em><span>, red t-shirt on that booth by the wall. Next to </span><em><span>I’m-hot-and-I-know-it,</span></em> <em><span>wears-a-leather-jacket-inside</span></em><span> dude. You’re welcome.”</span></p><p>
  <span>Lily's eyes got a bit wider, which was how Marlene knew she had gotten it right this time. The redhead took a sip of her Firewhiskey, tasting it in her mouth and letting it burn as she looked at the guy in red shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, he's fit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “Hes exactly your type!” said Alice excitedly. “What do we know about him, Benjy?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, other than the fact that he's fit and has a fit friend? Nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? You always have the scoop on everyone that comes here,” Marlene said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I've never seen him here before.” Benjy shrugged, before turning towards Lily with a hint of a dare in his tone. "Guess Lily will just have to walk up to his booth and find it all out on her own, won't she?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? You think I won't?” Lily answered, tilting her chin up in defiance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He's looking right at you, too,” Alice added.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He's</span>
  <em>
    <span> eye-fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> you, that's more accurate," corrected Marlene. "You really should go over there."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily lifted her glass, changing her weight from one leg to another as she contemplated her options. Men didn't come fitter than this very often. He was </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> her type. And judging by the way he was looking right at her, she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>type too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright," she said, turning towards her friends and running a hand over her body as she smoothed her dress. "Wish me luck," she asked, as she downed the last sip of her whiskey and walked towards the booth by the wall.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James wondered if, perhaps, his sanity ought to be questioned, because there he sat in a booth across from Sirius, cursing something as simple as a red t-shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But really, </span>
  <em>
    <span>honestly, </span>
  </em>
  <span>when the most gorgeous bird you’ve ever seen in your life approaches you wearing the tightest dress you’ve ever seen, a bloke really ought to be wearing something nicer than a random t-shirt he picked up off the floor without much thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last time he came to the Three Broomsticks girls like </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>hadn’t been hanging around at well after midnight. He had noticed her right away, her hair catching his eye first. It was the deepest red he had ever seen, and when she flicked it over her shoulder it fell back into place perfectly, making James feel as though he was watching one of those slow motion scenes in an old muggle movie his mum was obsessed with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But when she had turned towards him - </span>
  <em>
    <span>fully </span>
  </em>
  <span>towards him - he felt as though he had suffered from a lightning strike. Which, honestly, would explain his hair. But his awful mop had been like that long before she turned her eyes on him. Eyes as green as he had ever seen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he watched, struck completely dumb, as her red painted lips parted slightly, wishing desperately that he had wrestled that damned jacket off of Sirius before they left the house so he could look more like James Dean rather than </span>
  <em>
    <span>James-I- own-just-this-one-shirt-Potter. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But then she had started crossing the distance of the bar, closer towards him, and he couldn’t focus on anything other than how he had never really appreciated that a woman’s legs could be longer than a broomstick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could vaguely hear Sirius calling his name, but he appeared to have tunnel vision, only able to see the red head coming closer to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She arrived quicker than he could avert his eyes from her legs, sliding into the seat next to him, and smelling nothing like the magazine Jorkins had smacked him in the nose with just earlier. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cinnamon and honey, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought, his mouth completely dry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” he managed to choke out, feeling rather like an idiot and then clearing his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hi,"she smiled sweetly. "You see, my friend over there who works at the bar? Curly blond hair? He asked me to come in here and check if everything was up to your standards. Is the Three Broomsticks treating you okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fairly well,” said James, feeling his chest swell. “Though there is one thing you could do for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah? What would that be? I'm happy to help," the redhead said. Her grin was teasing and James felt rather like he were participating in the most interesting game of Quidditch he’d ever played. "You don't mind if I sit, do you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not at all,” said James. He couldn’t imagine a better position for her to be in. “But I was just wondering about your name, actually. I would be a whole lot better if I could have your name.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Lily, Lily Evans. Now, why would my name help you, Mr…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter, </span>
  <em>
    <span>James </span>
  </em>
  <span>Potter,” he said extending his hand and grinning broadly as she took it. Her hand was small, but a perfect fit, and the smoothness of her skin contrasted against his own calloused fingers. If her looks were like lighting, her touch was like a static shock. “And it helps me because it is the first step to getting to know you. Which I’d very much like to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Pleasure," Lily said, her lips curling up as she pronounced the 'p' in the most lovely way. Her features dissolved as she turned to Sirius in a friendly, yet much more dismissive manner, and added, "And you are?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Completely ignored, apparently,” scoffed Sirius, and James could tell that he was both miffed and amused by the situation. “But please, do go ahead. I think I’ll just go chat up a few birds by the bar. Perhaps one of your friends would actually be interested in my name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James watched as Sirius stood, giving James a wink that he was certain Lily caught too before heading over towards the bar. He only felt </span>
  <em>
    <span>slightly </span>
  </em>
  <span>guilty. After all, this had been their mission, hadn’t it? To find a bird that he would be comfortable taking to the Christmas party. And he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>more </span>
  </em>
  <span>than comfortable with the thought of Lily Evans being on his arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or </span>
  <em>
    <span>anywhere </span>
  </em>
  <span>else with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So James, now that your friend has oh so graciously left you all for myself, how do you propose we get to know each other better?" she asked, her elbows on the desk as she leaned forward towards him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, how about a round of </span>
  <em>
    <span>truth,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he said, before taking a swig of his Firewhiskey for confidence. When he spoke next his voice sounded gruff from the burning of the alcohol. “Single?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Very."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same,” he grinned. “Your turn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All is fair in love and war. True or False?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James paused for a brief moment, swirling his mug around as he thought. “Hmm, </span>
  <em>
    <span>true.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good answer," she said smiling. "I'll give you one more question. Make it count, James Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more, eh? Okay, now think over this carefully because it’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>important,” he said, pausing for dramatics and draping an arm across the back of her chair. “How do you feel about Quidditch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled fully, and it was the brightest damn thing he’d ever seen. "You mean the greatest sport in the world? I feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>fantastic</span>
  </em>
  <span> about it. Don't need to think over it very much."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James grinned. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked </span>
  </em>
  <span>this girl. “Lily Evans, would you like to head back to my place?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I think I'd like that very much.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she stood, making her way out of the booth, and pausing to take his hand in hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And when their fingers intertwined he forgot momentarily about the nameless broom in his back pocket. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tunnel vision, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought, allowing her to lead him into the night. </span>
