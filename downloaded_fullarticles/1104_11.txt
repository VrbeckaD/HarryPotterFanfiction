          <div class="userstuff"><p>“You made what?!”</p><p>“It’s called elephant toothpaste, Pansy.”</p><p>“Why would an elephant use toothpaste?” Pansy was making wild hand gestures, trying to accentuate her point.</p><p>“It’s not actual elephant toothpaste, Pansy. It’s just called that because of how it looks.”</p><p>“Oh.” Pansy sat back down in the chair which was now covered in the foamy mixture. “Gah!” She jumped back up, her clothes now soaked. Hermione held back a laugh.</p><p>“Here. <em>Scourgify</em>.” Hermione cast her wand at the darker haired girl, who was now clean.</p><p>“Thanks. Anyway, what was that spell called?” Pansy brushed a bit of foam off of her hand.</p><p>“Spell? It wasn’t a spell Pans. It was a chemical reaction. I mixed yeast with soap and hydrogen peroxide, and it does, well, that.”</p><p>“Hold on.” Pansy cast her wand at the chair and sat down once it was rid of the soapy mixture. “It’s a <em>what </em>reaction? And you mixed <em>what</em> with <em>what</em>?” Pansy furrowed her brows, obviously confused. Hermione chuckled.</p><p>“Pans, it’s simple <b>chemistry</b>. Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical. When you mix it with yeast and soap, you know what those are, it reacts. Then it explodes as you saw.”</p><p>“Oh. Cool. I guess.” Pansy dipped a finger in the substance that covered the substance on the table, feeling the stickiness of the soap. “What’s chemistry though?”</p><p>“You don’t know?!” Hermione exclaimed, mouth dropping open. “Well, I guess you wouldn’t. It’s a muggle thing. Basically…”</p><p>“No, Mione, it’s okay, really-“ Pansy’s protests were cut off by Hermione continuing on with no regard to the other girl's disinterest. Pansy sighed but listened to her girlfriend ramble on excitedly.</p></div>
