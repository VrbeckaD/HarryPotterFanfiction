    <p>001. “Pull over.  Let me drive for awhile.”<br/>“I’m fine, Granger. We’ll get to the next rest stop and catch a nap until morning.” Draco grumbled, as his eyes blinked rapidly to try and clear the exhaustion from them.<br/>The witch frowned, and reached out to gently lay a hand on his shoulder, “Please, Draco.”<br/>With a huff, the young man switched on the hazard lights and slowed the automobile, and once he’d pulled to the shoulder and stopped he leaned back and rolled his head to look at her, “At the next stop, we’re sleeping. We can finish the trip tomorrow, it’s not like London is going anywhere.”<br/>“I know.” she smiled.</p>
<p>002. “It reminded me of you.”<br/>Hermione eyed the novel collection in awe, sparing a curious glance to the man in the chair beside her.<br/>“No, really.” Draco chuckled, smirking, “A grand fantasy tale? By an old Muggle author? Honestly, Granger, how could I pass it up.”<br/>She grinned, setting the box down beside her in the couch in the Ministry’s lounge, her eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief, “You honestly expect me to believe the Heir of Malfoy, the Pureblood Draco, went out to a Muggle shop and just happened to find and pick up a set of books specifically for me?”<br/>“What? I’m not my father, Granger.” he sneered, but his own eyes twinkled back at her, “Besides, I read them already. You spend so much time in the archives, I merely assumed you’d prefer used over new.”</p>
<p>003. “No, no, it’s my treat.”<br/>Frowning, Hermoine shot Draco a narrow look before allowing him to take the tab. They’d sat for tea, discussing one of his recent cases which tied into her own research, and she’d been about to pay for her cup and scones when he’d laid his hand over her bill.<br/>He chuckled, “Honestly, with that look, you’d think I was trying to buy your firstborn.”<br/>She rolled her eyes, smirking, “As if you’d want a Muggleborn for a child.”<br/>Something changed in his smile, but it was gone in a moment as he laughed.</p>
<p>004. “Come here.  Let me fix it.”<br/>“It was supposed to be a simple observation mission. Watch the bloody git in case he was smuggling Dark Arts artifacts.” Draco spat, shuffling over to the bed in St.Mungo’s, “How was I to know he’d set up wards?”<br/>“Maybe if you’d thought to check?” Hermione frowned, and began casting diagnostic spells, “Well, at least he only hit you with simple hexes. You’ll be running after criminals again by morning.”<br/>“Bloody brainless git, I doubt he would’ve passed fourth year, let alone our fifth and sixth.”<br/>Pausing in her healing, Hermione laid a hand on his shoulder. When he looked up, annoyed and curious, she whispered, “Many didn’t.”<br/>Shamefaced, Draco turned his gaze downward.</p>
<p>005. “I’ll walk you home.”<br/>With a blink, Hermione turned to the voice and found Draco standing tall–and, annoyingly, lacking in any signs he’d been drinking–with his arm out and waiting. “I’m tipsy, Malfoy, not an invalid.”<br/>“Which means no apparating, and the bar doesn’t have a fireplace so no floo home.” he smirked, “If nothing else, I could at least walk you to where the Knight Bus will pick you up. As the Heir of a noble Pureblood House, it’s my duty as a gentleman to make sure the lady of the hour reaches home.”<br/>Annoyed, but unwilling to spoil the evening by arguing, she linked her arm in his, “So you’re a gentleman now, are you?”<br/>“I’ve always been one,” he smirked, before it softened, “I merely needed to be, what was it, more open-minded about things.”<br/>“I suppose ‘better late than never’ is an improvement.”</p>
<p>006. “Have a good day at work.”<br/>Draco paused in going over Hermione’s report on the body his partner had found the previous week, glancing up to watch the young woman’s retreating back as she left his office and set out, “And you as well, Granger.”</p>
<p>007. “I dreamt about you last night.”<br/>Hermione paused, looking up from her drink to glance at Draco. They, along with most of the old DA, were in the Three Broomsticks celebrating another year of having survived the War. He was looking across the room, brow drawn down and a scowl marring his face.<br/>“It was about… when you were being tortured.”<br/>She shivered, taking another sip of Firewhiskey.<br/>“I kept trying to stop Lestrange, but I was frozen. Couldn’t move, couldn’t scream out. Just frozen as she kept hitting you with the cruciatus…” finally he turned to her, and the hurt in his eyes pulled at her, “I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>008. “Take my seat.”<br/>Draco blinked, and glanced over at Hermione only to find her staring at the man in the next seat over. “Why? Don’t you work with him at Mungo’s?”<br/>“He’s a git, Malfoy.” she shot him a look, “He makes you look like saint.”<br/>“Ouch, I’m wounded, Ms. Granger, positively hurt that you’d imply I was anything but a true gentleman.” he smirked, moving to sit between the two as requested.<br/>Besides, it let him snub Shacklebolt and the seating arrangement. Who was he to care if it put a Muggleborn above a Pureblood, he mentally snickered.</p>
<p>009. “I saved a piece for you.”<br/>“You didn’t even know I’d be stopping by.” she countered, but still picked up the plate with a slice of cake on it. The Auror department had had a party, she thought it was about some promotion or some such, and she’d disappointed at seeing the crumbs of a chocolate cake on the table in the lounge outside the offices<br/>“You always swing by on Fridays, in case we have anything for you check over the weekend.” Draco shrugged, continuing to flip through files and sorting them into folders.<br/>“Well, thank you.”</p>
<p>010. “I’m sorry for your loss.”<br/>“Thank you, Hermione.” He sighed, uncertain how he should feel at the death of his father. Lucius had been a terrible man, but his mother had loved him and he was still his father. Draco shook his head, going back to paperwork. <br/>“If you need to talk…”<br/>He paused, finally glancing up to meet her gaze, and offered a grateful smile, “I might… perhaps we could share tea at Madam Malkin’s?”<br/>“Sure.” Hermione smiled back, before turning to leave, “I’ll meet you around seven.”</p>
