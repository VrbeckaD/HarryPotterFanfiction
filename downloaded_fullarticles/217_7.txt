    <p>All I feel is pain. Emotional and physical. Emotional because my family was dead and it's my fault, physical because emotional pain wasn't enough for him. He wanted to destroy me. It worked.<br/>
I laid somewhere in the dark hurt and cold. I closed my eyes and waited for darkness to get me. But it didn't come. It felt like my consciousness tried to punish me for my mistakes. I don't know how long I laid there until the sound of footsteps came closer to me. ''You think she's alive?'' ''She certainly doesn't look okay to me,'' Voices near me said. </p><p>I opened my eyes and saw red hair. ''Ginny,'' the word came out of my mind before I could stop it. Instantly I regretted it because the girl didn't even look like the woman who welcomed me into her family, and who was dead now. I started to laugh so much, that tears come out of my eyes. I knew I looked insane, laying on the ground, badly hurt and laughing like crazy because in front of me stood Lily, freaking, Evans.</p><p> '' Am I dead?'' came out of my mouth before darkness finally took me over.</p><p>.......</p><p>What can I say? I'm in really deep shit. Not every day you see soon-to-be a dead person standing next to you with a friendly smile. I got to admit, it was really strange and if doctors wouldn't have given me so many pain killers, I would be in a full panic mode by now. The Evans family hadn't left me alone most of my recovery time, even if it was me being unconscious. Then I woke up I was told that my injuries were quite bad and it will take time for me to fully recover, which is fine because I needed to figure it out what to do next. because let's be real here, my situation is fucked up. I don't have any money, family or home, hell, it wasn't even my timeline. </p><p>After seeing my struggles not to panic, Mr. Evans told me that I could live with them for a while. ''Don't worry about me, there is no need to burden yourselves,'' I said even though I knew some help would be nice. </p><p>'' Nonsense,'' exclaimed Lily ''We have room for you to stay and I could help you to recover. Besides, don't you think Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore should come to see you, maybe he could help to find those people who did this to you or even enroll you into the school. If so, you won't need to worry about where to stay for a whole year, then.'' </p><p>'' Of course, you will spend your summers with us,'' interfered Mrs. Evans. </p><p>I thought about it for a moment. Lily's idea was perfect. If I went to Hogwarts then its library would be available for me to search for some useful information about time travel or even alternative dimension, because I know for sure that time-turner wasn't near me in the attack. ''Alright, I will stay with you. However, next summer I will find a job so I could pay back all the money you had spent on me,'' I held up my hand when the Evans family started to protest. ''Please? I don't want to live off your money or to be a burden,'' When they finally agreed, the elder couple decided to go to the Cafe. </p><p>'' Do you, girls, want something?'' I could feel myself getting a bit tired, so I told them no, Lily asked for coffee. </p><p>While they were away, I asked a few questions. ''Hey, how old are? And what year are you going to be now at Hogwarts?'' Maybe her answer will help me to figure out what year I was in. As far as my knowledge reaches, Harry's parents started their education in the 1970s. ''I'm fifteen, and in about month I will be the fifth year student. How about you? You never told us anything about yourself,'' </p><p>I smirked and said ''Yet, you still want to live with me,'' We both laughed '' My name is Violetta Blackheart, fifteen years old from Ireland.'' </p><p>'' What school did you go then?'' inquired Lily</p><p>'' Er, I was homeschooled most of the time. Truth to be told, basic magic isn't my cup of tea,'' I said with a wry smile. </p><p>'' What do you mean?'' girl demanded perplexed. </p><p>I didn't answer her. Instead, I closed my eyes and instantly felt myself to heat. I held my palm up and a ball of blue flame escaped through my skin. Lily gasped and stepped away from me surprised</p><p>'' Wow,'' that's all she could say. </p><p>I let out a small laugh and extinguished the fire before asking ''Could you please don't tell anyone about this? I kind of want to keep my powers in secret,''</p><p> I knew I could trust Lily. Don't know why. Maybe because I knew her son Harry, or maybe, she doesn't seem like a person, who would go babbling about it to anyone. After Lily promised to not tell my secret, even to her friend Severus, we spent time talking about general things like Hogwarts, hobbies, and interests, until I fell asleep.</p><p>.........</p><p>'' This room is nice'' I said when Lily showed my room. Walls were painted with a light shade of blue, one wall was the white color. Next to the window, which had a nice view of the back garden, stood a medium-sized bed. The room also had a desk and a closet.</p><p>'' It might be a little empty- looking, but I'm sure you'll be able to decorate it whatever you want,'' reassured Lily. '' Mom also found some clothes that could fit you. And by found, I meant she had me and Tuney go through the contents of our closets. I hope you don't mind?''</p><p>I sighted. Oh, how much I hated to be in this situation. It seems that I always find myself being pitied over. It makes me feel so bad about myself. And even my pride has a lot of suffering from lack of any belongings. I don't want to be someone's charity case. ''No, it's okay, Besides I don't have any choice, right?'' I asked.</p><p>Lily gave me a warm smile and hugged me. I tensed but hugged her back. ''Don't worry, Violetta. I'm sure that soon, you will be able to stand on your own feet again. For now, let us take care of you''</p><p>I couldn't help but think about how much those words resembled the ones that were said in my past. Ironically, it was Lily's son who told them to me. My eyes started to burn, as the memories of the dead bodies of the family, who rescued me and gave me a home, flooded my head. I couldn't help myself but hug Lily harder, as the guilt threatened to drown me. We stood there for God knows how much when the snarky voice interrupted our hug.</p><p>'' So, this is the girl you and Snape had found in the park?'' asked horse-faced female in the doorway. My mood dropped even more when I saw Petunia Dursley (or maybe she hasn't married that whale yet?) standing there, looking like she would rather be somewhere else than here. She never came with her family to see me. Probably because Petunia couldn't be bothered to see some strange girl in the park. Mentally, I was rolling my eyes so hard they would have stuck at the back of my head. Out of sheer politeness, I said ''Hi, my name is Violetta'' with a forced smile on my face. Petunia only glared at me like I was some kind of disease and looked back at her younger sister.</p><p>'' Yes, Tuney, this is the same girl. Don't know if mum or dad told you, but she's going to live with us until Hogwarts starts.'' I almost laughed when Petunia gave me a disgusted look. ''So, it's a freak just like you''</p><p>Did she just call me ''it''? Well, our opinions about each other are pretty much the same, since I couldn't and wouldn't justify, or even refer nicely to the child abuser. Especially, if it's her nephew.</p><p>'' If I were you, darling, I wouldn't call a person who can turn you into the horse with a wave of their magical stick, a freak, or any kind of the insult,'' couldn't help but retort coldly. God knows how much I want to do just that, however, the teenager in front of me didn't do anything yet, so that only would be me being a dick. Also, I don't have my wand.</p><p>Petunia scoffed at me and walked away. I looked at Lily who was amused but at the same time ashamed. ''I'm sorry for talking to your sister like that,'' I said</p><p>Lily only shrugged ''Don't worry about it, my sister didn't have a right to talk to you like that,'' We stood there for a moment in the comfortable silence, until redhead spoke ''Yesterday, I wrote to professor Dumbledore about you. He wants to meet you and probably ask what happened. Is that okay?''</p><p>'' When he will come?'' I asked with a nod<br/>
'' Tomorrow at noon,'' That's good, enough time to think of the credible story.<br/>
Suddenly, we heard a doorbell. I looked at Lily ''Waiting for someone?''</p><p>'' It must be Sev. We agreed to meet today. You can also come. I'm sure he wants to meet you,''</p><p>I declined Lily's offer because I was sure that Snape didn't give a damn about me and I felt exhausted, to be honest. I said to Lily only about my tiredness. Luckily, she understood and after a few reassures that I was fine, Lily left to greet Snape. A sigh escaped me as I closed the doors. A look at the clock showed that it was 2 pm. Mrs. Evans told me they have dinners usually at 5 pm, so I have a few hours of a nap and to think of some story about how I got here. Fun.</p>
