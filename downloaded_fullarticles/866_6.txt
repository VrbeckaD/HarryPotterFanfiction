    <p>At ten, Lily was a bright but reserved girl who adored her thirteen-year-old sister Petunia almost to the point of worship. Lily had long red her, which shone like bronze in the late summer sunlight. She wanted to be just like her sister, and they did everything together. But there was something about Lily which was different. Sometimes, she could make things happen without meaning to, like pushing a book off a shelf or smashing a plate when she was angry. She could also make flowers and butterflies and other beautiful things. Petunia didn’t know how Lily did it, and had told her to stop. Lily had tried, but she just couldn’t help it. Sometimes, she thought maybe Petunia was jealous, but that was a mean thing to think and she decided it probably wasn’t true anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When Lily had turned eleven, she’d received a strange letter in the post from a school called Hogwarts. It wasn’t a normal school: it was a school of magic. Lily’s parents had been shocked but pleased. The school was prestigious in certain circles, so they said. But Petunia has scoffed. She’d said it was a load of nonsense and that Lily had made it all up. That was the first time Lily had thought maybe she didn’t want to be exactly like Petunia after all.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of eleven Lily had also made a new friend. His name was Severus and he could do magic. He could make birds and butterflies out of leaves, and could make the wind blow so that it whipped at their hair as they laughed together. Severus had told Lily all about magic and about Hogwarts, about how they could be the best wizard and witch to ever attend the school.</p>
<p>One day when Lily came home from the park after spending the afternoon with Severus, she found Petunia sitting on the front step with her arms crossed. ‘You like him more than me.’ The words had hurt Lily. ‘I don’t,’ she had protested. And she didn’t. Severus was just different. ‘You’re both freaks,’ Petunia had said. Then Lily had decided it was Petunia who was different, not Severus.<br/>
<br/>
Lily had gone to Hogwarts. She went on the train which seemed to travel for hours and hours, and she’d seen the majestic towers of the castle pointing straight up into the sky. She’d entered the Great Hall and had been sorted into Gryffindor, the house of the brave. Severus had been sorted into Slytherin, but Lily didn’t see why them being in a different house would matter at all. That year Lily learned about potions and charms and magical creatures she’d never known before. When she’d come home for Christmas, bursting with news, Petunia has made fun of her and then ignored her. ‘You’re different now,’ Petunia had said. Lily thought it was Petunia who was different, not her.<br/>
<br/>
When she turned twelve, Lily was in her second year at Hogwarts. She was top of the class in Potions, along with Severus. She was also very good at Charms and Herbology, but there was another Gryffindor, a boy called James Potter, who was just as good as her, sometimes even better, especially in Transfirguation and Defence Against the Dark Arts. But unlike Lily and Severus, he was never in the library, and didn’t seem to do any work at all. Lily found his smirk both irritating and amusing, but Severus didn’t see anything amusing about the boy at all.<br/>
<br/>
Severus and Lily had their first argument when Lily was thirteen. James has given Lily a birthday present: a Potions set, wrapped a little haphazardly, but filled with tools and ingredients and an instructions book which Lily fell in love with at once. The book had illustrations and useful annotations to learn from. When Lily had thanked James for the present, he had smiled, not his usual smirk, but something different. Lily liked that smile. But Severus had been angry. He had frowned and complained and glared at James. Lily recognised those frowns as the same ones Petunia wore: Severus was jealous. But why? Lily could have more than one friend, right?<br/>
<br/>
At fourteen, Lily found herself torn. Severus had other friends too, in Slytherin. But they didn’t like her. And Severus didn’t like the Marauders - James and his friends. Lily didn’t like the way the Marauders treated Severus either, but she wished Severus wouldn’t antagonise them all the time. Lily also had other friends, Martha and Alice. They didn’t understand why Lily spent so much time with Severus. Martha fancied one of James’ friends, Sirius. But Sirius wasn’t interested in her. Or at least he didn’t seem to be.<br/>
<br/>
Lily was fourteen when Severus had invented the spell ‘levicorpus’, which could turn people upside down and hang them by their feet.  Severus had a certain talent for inventive magic. The Marauders too had mastered it soon enough, and things got so chaotic in the corridors that Professor Dumbledore was forced to ban the spell for an entire term until people learned to control themselves. Snape and the Marauders didn’t learn to control themselves though. Instead, they learned how to jinx each other without being seen.<br/>
<br/>
When Lily was fifteen, she went on her first date. He was a boy from Ravenclaw called Robert Marks, and he had said lots of nice things to Lily. And then he had kissed her, just for a second, on the lips. Lily had felt fireworks explode in her stomach. But they never kissed each other again. Lily had liked Robert a lot, but he hadn’t liked Severus. He hadn’t even liked James, even though everyone liked James. The Marauders were Lily’s friends now. Somehow they had all grown closer together. Lily liked Peter, who seemed to have a way of talking to anyone and understanding them; she liked the way Remus listened to her and worked with her on difficult charms, and she did the same in return; Lily liked to laugh at Sirius and his antics with James; and she liked James a lot too, although she couldn’t put her finger on precisely why. But James was sometimes distant. Sirius would pounce on Lily at odd moments and ask what she was doing, with a twinkle in his silver eyes as though he knew something she didn’t. He asked her about James a lot, though she didn’t really understand why. Rumours spread that James fancied Lily, but other girls laughed. What would the most popular boy in the school want with a girl who spent most of her time in the library with that creepy Slytherin?<br/>
<br/>
Lily and Severus fell out when she was sixteen. Severus had called Lily a ‘Mudblood’ in front of their whole year after an OWL exam. Lily was hurt and angry. She’d thought he wasn’t like the other Slytherins. When they were apart, Lily noticed Severus spending more and more time with the other Slytherins, like Ant Dolohov and Will Alexander. Sirius said they were going to end up as Death Eaters. But Sirius was just angry because his brother Regulus liked the Slytherins more than he liked Sirius. Sirius had run away from home that year and gone to live with James; Lily admired them both for that.<br/>
<br/>
When she was sixteen something had happened between Severus and the Marauders, although Lily didn’t understand it. Severus kept his distance from them after that, and things seemed icy between the Marauders for a long time, although they tried not to show it. All of them were silent when Lily questioned them on the matter, even Peter.</p>
<p>Now Lily was seventeen. And the war had started. The war about which there had been whispers for months, years even. It did not take long for the war to come to Hogwarts – or had it always been there? When the war had begun, Dumbledore had made a speech about unity and acceptance, but the war changed things. As Lily would learn, she would no longer be able to cross between one side and another. At seventeen, Lily would be torn between the friend who had first accepted her when her sister had not, and the ones whom that friend hated. The war was much bigger than Lily and her friends, but to Lily the one in her heart was just as agonising.</p>

<p>Severus Snape was eleven when he met Lily Evans. She could do magic, and she was everything Severus had imagined a witch to be: clever, talented, pretty. And she liked him. Nobody had ever liked him before – not his mother, who had no time and no love for him; not his father, who cared more for his work than for his son. But then Snape was sorted into Slytherin and Lily into Gryffindor. Lily said it didn’t change anything, but she didn’t understand. For Severus knew this changed everything. One day, he knew, he would have to make a choice. He should have made the choice straight away, as his father would have instructed him if he’d shown enough interest in Severus’ life to even know he had a friend in Gryffindor. But unlike his father, Severus cared too much for Lily Evans.</p>
<p>At twelve, Severus had first jinxed James Potter. It had been after a Herbology lesson, and behind the green houses he had found James and Sirius laughing and joking together. In the lesson, James had corrected Severus when he’d got the name of mandrake wrong. At the time, he had been distracted by the particular shade of bronze which Lily’s eyelashes had taken on in the beam of sunlight which had shone through the greenhouse windows. And so when he saw James laughing, he hexed him without a second thought. It had only been a leg-lock hex, and Sirius had instantly retaliated with a hex of his own. Lily never found out about the incident; or if she had, she hadn’t said anything.</p>
<p>When he was thirteen Severus was reminded again that he would one day have to make a choice, and that Lily would never choose his side. James had given Lily a birthday present, and even Severus had to admit that it was perfect. And it had lit a perfect smile on Lily’s perfect face. But the smile was for James and not for Severus. James had snatched Lily from Severus just as easily as James could snatch snitches on the Quidditch pitch. When Severus had said as much to Lily, she had shouted at him for the first time ever, and Severus thought maybe they were finished and the choice had been made for him. But Lily was forgiving, and Severus was drawn back to her once more.</p>
<p>Severus was no fool though. And so he began to make other connections (he refused to term them friends) within his own house. He didn’t like them exactly, but he did admire them. Certainly Ant Dolohov was talented, and Will Alexander knew how to duel beautifully. They taught Severus all they knew, and in return Severus taught them. One day, to impress them, he had invented a new spell, ‘levicorpus’. He had meant it to be a private showing, used on Peter Pettigrew at a particularly opportune moment. After that, the hex spread like wildfire across the school, until even the headmaster had to step in to control it. But by then it was too late: such a spell, once created, could never be controlled, not even by its maker.</p>
<p>By the time Severus turned fifteen, he had begun creating many more spells, which he recorded in his Potions book. Dolohov and Alexander were not the only ones who paid attention to Severus now within the Slytherin house. He called himself the Half-Blood Prince, a pompous and dramatic title which he thought Lily would have found funny, except he never told her about it. He told her less and less these days, because he was afraid that if she really knew him then he would lose her. Severus earned acclaim for the first time, but not from teachers. He was introduced to a brother and sister duo called the Carrows, who both terrified and enthralled him. They taught Severus about a kind of magic which Hogwarts had never spoken of. He knew it was Dark magic, but it enticed him because it was different, because it was something the Marauders didn’t have.</p>
<p>Severus was sixteen when he hurt Lily. He called her a ‘Mudblood’, and regretted the word as soon as it had slipped from his lips. Lily’s eyes had flashed with hurt and anger, and she’d turned to James for comfort and protection. Severus had made his choice, in Lily’s eyes at least.</p>
<p>Severus was sixteen when he was almost killed by Remus Lupin. Lupin was a werewolf. Severus hadn’t believed Sirius when he’d told him, but he’d gone to the Shrieking Shack anyway just to be sure, and only James’ quick action had saved him. He hated being indebted to James. Why James Potter of all people? He hadn’t told anyone, of course, but he knew from the way Lily watched him that she was aware something had happened.</p>
<p>And now he was seventeen. Severus would make his choice. It would be made final the night when he cursed Sirius Black. Or maybe the night when Lily confronted him about it, and he realised he had lost her. Severus would find the edge of Lily’s forgiveness, and he would plummet into the abyss beyond. Now there was a war, and Severus could fight only for one side.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>When he was eleven, James Potter went to Hogwarts. On the train, he met a boy called Sirius Black, but Sirius wasn’t like the other Blacks his father had talked about. Sirius was different, and the two boys became friends at once. They would be the best wizards in the school. James and Sirius were good wizards and they knew it; they also knew that they were beyond control, for they knew how to rebel without being punished…at least not too severely.</p>
<p>James was twelve years old when he decided he loved Lily Evans. He didn’t even tell Sirius, because Sirius made everything into a joke, but James wanted this to be real. James had realised this during Herbology one day, when the sun had been shining through the glass of the greenhouse directly onto Lily. It had made her bright hair glow like fire and her green eyes gleam like emeralds. And then Snape had hexed him. Because Snape loved Lily too. James couldn’t understand what Lily saw in Snape, and so he prodded and pushed the Slytherin boy, trying to find out what made him tick. For Snape fascinated James.</p>
<p>At thirteen, James had dared to give Lily a birthday present. He thought long and hard about his gift, for he knew that Potions was a particular talent of Lily’s, and that she enjoyed it very much. The smile which Lily had given James when she’d opened the present had been worth all the waiting and the nerves. He realised she didn’t need the sun in order to glow. Sirius had mocked him endlessly for favouring Lily with a gift, but that had been worth it too.</p>
<p>James was thirteen when the Marauders had been formed. First Peter Pettigrew, a boy who seemed nice enough and was liked by most people, but didn’t have anyone to call his own friends. James and Sirius rescued him from Snape and the other Slytherins when they had hexed him with a new spell. Peter adored Sirius, and they found him funny. He was a good look-out for their pranks. And then there was Remus Lupin. He was quiet and reserved, keeping to himself most of the time, working in the library for so long that sometimes he seemed more exhausted than was right for any thirteen-year-old. But he was also clever and witty and surprisingly good at Defence Against the Dark Arts. And he had been drawn into the orbit that was James and Sirius.</p>
<p>Within a year they had cracked Remus’ secret. He was a werewolf. Sirius and Peter thought it was cool. James thought it was cool too. But he also saw the bags under Remus’ eyes and the scars across his face, and knew that the fact haunted his friend. This didn’t push James away as Remus expected though, but instead it drew James to keep Remus closer. They made a pact, the three of them, to always protect Remus, not matter the cost, and to make his life better in any way they could. That night when they made a pact was also the night James began to research the process of becoming an animagus. If Remus had to transform, the other Marauders would learn to transform with him.</p>
<p>By fifteen the Marauders was a name known across the school. As was the hex ‘levicorpus’, invented by none other than Severus Snape. The Marauders gave as good as they got, and so Severus found himself swept into the air by his ankle just as much if not more than James or Sirius. They had only relented the constant hex battle when Lily had begged them to stop. Dumbledore’s ban was meaningless to James, but a request from Lily was one he could not ignore. James had watched from a distance as Lily dated Robert Marks, and for the first time he understood something of what Snape felt, for he wanted to glare at Robert in the same way Snape did. But he knew Lily was free to love whomever she chose, even if the thought of it broke James a little inside every time he saw them together. Sirius knew, though. And Sirius, like always, would fight for James. Remus and Peter too. For they were a team.</p>
<p>When he was sixteen, James tore Lily in two. He hated Snape for calling Lily by that slur, but he knew full-well that he had goaded Snape into it. James and Snape might have been on different sides, but neither was innocent.</p>
<p>And James too had watched as Sirius was torn in two, for the Black family rejected one son while praising the other. By sixteen James and Sirius had been brothers for years, but now they shared a home too, and James would never forget that terrible summer night when Sirius had arrived on the Potter doorstep, face coated in tears and torso coated in bruises, when James had stepped forward to wrap his arms around his best friend and whisper, ‘welcome home’.</p>
<p>But another person had almost been torn apart that year too, for Sirius had told Snape about Remus in the Shrieking Shack, and James had only just reached him in time. It took weeks for trust to be rebuilt between the Marauders. Snape was not worth the loss of their friendship, though, and in time they healed. James saw from the way Lily watched them all that she knew something was wrong. He knew Lily would accept Remus, but Remus was not yet ready to trust anyone else.</p>
<p>So now James was seventeen. And there was a war. And James’ mother was dying. And James needed to do something. But his need for action would put his friends in danger. Sirius especially. Even worse, he would drag Lily into the fray. Or had Snape done that? He just hoped Lily would be as forgiving of him as she had been of Snape for so many years. Because he still loved her – and he thought maybe she loved him too.</p>
