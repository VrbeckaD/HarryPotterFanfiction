    <p>If there was something that was happening to you lately, then you would say you are seeing visions more often. You didn't just see visions about the Cursed Vaults or Jacob, also other visions could be seen. These other kinds of visions surprised you more than you liked to admit, not knowing when they would happen. It would catch you off guard most of the time. People around you thought you were daydreaming, but you knew that wasn’t the case. The visions would often wake you up in the middle of the night, showing you horrible things that were going to happen. You often recognized places and the people were familiar whenever you had a vision.</p><p>More students were getting stuck into paintings and you sometimes saw it happening before it had actually happened. You didn’t know what you should do. Should you inform someone about this ability or keep it to yourself? Who would believe you when you say you had foreseen Beatrice getting stuck in a painting. You didn’t know who did it, but you had seen her get stuck before it actually happened. Maybe if you talked about it, you could have done something. However, who would believe you about this?</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Y/N Y/L/N</em>, are you all right?”</p><p>You slowly looked towards Tulip. That’s right, you had your Defence Against the Dark Arts class now. Spacing out during class seemed to happen a lot more often and you knew that wasn’t a good thing. “I’m fine, Tulip.” You quickly told her.</p><p>“Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>, may I have word with you after class?” Professor Rakepick said when she passed you.</p><p>“Yes, professor.” You said. You could tell Rakepick was suspecting something. The look she gave me was giving that away.</p><p>“I wonder what Rakepick wants from you.” Tulip said. “I know she chose you, Merula and Bill as her Apprentice Curse-Breakers, but it doesn’t seem like she is asking Merula to stay after class as well.”</p><p>“Beats me, I guess I will just have to find out after class.” You said, yawning softly.</p><p>“Seriously <em>Y/N Y/L/N</em>, are you sure you are okay? You have been acting strange lately.”</p><p>“It’s nothing Tulip.” You snapped.</p><p>Tulip looked taken aback by you.</p><p>You ran a hand through your hair. “Really, nothing is wrong.” You said, sounding calmer.</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds to me like you are slowly losing your mind, <em>Y/L/N</em>.”</p><p>You gave Merula a look. Of course, that was a typical thing she would say. Although, she was getting less on your nerves lately. Sometimes she is nice to you, which still surprises you. Maybe it had to do with the deal you made when you, Merula and Bill became Rakepick’s apprentice Curse-Breakers. “Very funny, Snyde. Definitely something I don’t hear often.” You muttered, rolling your eyes.</p><p>“Look, <em>Y/L/N</em>. We are supposed to keep each other informed about the Cursed Vaults.” Merula pointed out.</p><p>“If <em>Y/N Y/L/N</em> doesn’t want to talk to you about it, she doesn’t have to Merula.” Tulip said, looking slightly annoyed.</p><p>“Stay out of this, Karasu.” Merula hissed.</p><p>“You were the one who butted in on our conversation, Snyde.” Tulip said, frowning a bit.</p><p> </p><p>You were about to tell them to shut up when you suddenly froze.</p><p>Another vision was happening. You could see you were in the Forbidden Forest. Someone was wearing a black cloak, hiding their face from you. It was like the person was standing right there in front of you. Did this mean the vision was about you?</p><p><em>“Your eyes are valuable, Y/N. They are testing your abilities by doing bad things to the people around you.” </em>The guy said. said. “<em>You were probably aware of seeing me here today</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Why are you warning me about this, Jacob</em>?” You heard yourself say. <em>Jacob</em>? The guy under the cloak is Jacob?</p><p>“<em>Because they want you as their personal seer. You have the ability to see bad situations happening in the future, something they want in order to succeed.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Then why did I see you in my vision?</em>”</p><p>“<em>You see, I’m not the same person anymore, Y/N</em>.” He said, raising his wand at you. “<em>It might take a while before they will find you again after this. Don’t go looking for me.”</em></p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>.”</p><p>You shook your head a bit and blinked when you saw Rakepick standing in front of you. “Yes, professor?”</p><p>Rakepick narrowed her eyes at you, probably wondering what is going on. She looked at the other students who were in the classroom. “Class is dismissed.”</p><p>Most students seemed to be leaving, except for your friends and Merula.</p><p>“I said ‘<em>class dismissed</em>’, I need to talk with miss <em>Y/L/N</em> alone.” Rakepick said.</p><p>“But Professor-”</p><p>“No, Miss Khanna.” Rakepick said.</p><p>Your friends and Merula slowly seemed to be leaving the class and you were left alone with Rakepick</p><p> </p><p>“Good. Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>, I thought this would be a good moment to talk to you.” Rakepick told you. “I have noticed you haven’t been as attentive as you normally are… You seem to space out a lot and you seem to be tired.” She pointed out. “Is there something you need to tell me?”</p><p>“I just haven’t been able to sleep well, that’s all…” You lied. Sure, you have been awake because of your visions, but it wasn’t the only reason.</p><p>“Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>, maybe you could fool Professor Kettleburn with that excuse, but you definitely can’t fool me.” Rakepick gave you a serious look. “What is the real reason? If you were just daydreaming you would have responded to me when I placed a hand on your shoulder.”</p><p>You knew Rakepick wouldn’t let you go before she had an answer. You knew you would have to tell her the truth. “I had a vision.”</p><p>“A vision? About what?”</p><p>“About Jacob.”</p><p>“And how often do you have these visions?”</p><p>“Quite often lately.” You said honestly.</p><p>“And they are all about Jacob?”</p><p>“They used to be only about Jacob in the past I think…? At least most of them.”</p><p>“In the past? You mean you have had vision before this year started?”</p><p>“I think I have had visions as long as I can remember, they just weren’t really strong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who knows about this ability of yours, Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>?” Rakepick asked.</p><p>“Jacob knows… I think some of my friends are aware of it, like Rowan.” You told her.</p><p>“Did you have any visions about the students who got stuck in paintings?”</p><p>“…Yes.” You looked away when you admitted it. “I saw Beatrice Haywood in a vision.” You frowned. “I thought it was just a nightmare, but before I knew it we found her there in the painting…”</p><p>“Did you see more students in your visions?”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“And you didn’t want to mention it, because…?”</p><p>“Because people won’t believe me when I tell them such things.” You muttered, looking away. “Look, I have never asked for this ability and I’d rather don’t have it all.”</p><p>“Being a Seer has its advantages and disadvantages.”</p><p>“I’m not a Seer.”</p><p>“There is enough evidence you are one, Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>. I think even your Headmaster knows about this.”</p><p>“Try growing up with people who think Divination is <em>rubbish</em>.” You muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah yes, I have heard quite some things about your parents. They work at the Ministry of Magic, right?” Rakepick said.</p><p>“Yes…” You muttered.</p><p>“They seemed to be very unhappy with the fact both you and Jacob are rule-breakers in school. Very traditional people they are.”</p><p>“They are very… <em>organised</em>.”</p><p>“You are not so fond of your family, are you?”</p><p>“As harsh as it seems, I don’t see them as a family. My family only cares about their image. Jacob and I have rebelled a few times and it didn’t work out.” You mumbled. “I see my friends more like family.”</p><p>“I can imagine.” She said and then she sighed. “Let’s talk a bit more about those visions of yours, all right? They might be helpful for your search for your brother and the Cursed Vaults.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“What do you think Professor Rakepick is talking about with <em>Y/N</em>?” Rowan asked.</p><p>“Obviously, they are talking about <em>Y/L/N</em>’s even more unusual behaviour.” Merula said.</p><p>“I don’t know why you are even waiting out here, Snyde… If you are just here to insult <em>Y/N Y/L/N</em>, you should just leave.” Tulip said, glaring at Merula.</p><p>“I have every right to be here, Karasu.” Merula muttered. “Besides, I can’t help it but to be concerned about her as well.”</p><p>“You are concerned about <em>Y/N</em>?” Penny asked, looking surprised.</p><p>“You better don’t tell her that.” Merula hissed.</p><p>“Hey Rowan, did you notice other unusual things about <em>Y/N</em>?” Charlie asked.</p><p>“Well, you know she has been quite busy with her Prefect duties, her homework, her search for the Cursed Vaults, and she has been in detention a lot.”</p><p>“She seemed to be exhausted. Her duelling is a little off as well.” Barnaby pointed out.</p><p>“She seems to be avoiding me outside the classroom…” Penny said, looking down a bit.</p><p>“Also, she is moody and not up for any pranks.” Tonks said, shaking her head a bit.</p><p>“What about the fact she nearly fell off her broom during Flying Class this week?” Andre pointed out.</p><p>Charlie grimaced. “That was pretty dangerous…”</p><p>“Last week she nearly got burnt during our Care of Magical Creatures class.” Liz said. “She was very distracted by something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you see anything unusual, Ben?” Charlie asked, noticing Ben hadn’t said anything yet.</p><p>Ben blinked when everyone was looking at him. “Well… I saw her leaving the Owlery in anger.”</p><p>“In anger?” Rowan asked.</p><p>“What was she doing in the Owlery?” Andre asked.</p><p>“Well… She ripped a letter there. I think it might have been one she received from her parents.” Ben said softly.</p><p>“How do you know it was from her parents?” Rowan asked, narrowing her eyes a little.</p><p>“She muttered something and I heard her say father and mother.” Ben said honestly.</p><p>“Why would she rip a letter she received from her parents?” Charlie asked.</p><p>“<em>Y/N</em> doesn’t have a good relationship with her parents.” Barnaby said.</p><p>Everyone looked at Barnaby surprised.</p><p>“What? She told me that once when we were drinking Butterbeer in the Three Broom Sticks.” Barnaby said. “You guys didn’t know?”</p><p>“She refuses to talk about her parents, so I thought that might have been the case… She just never told me about that though.” Rowan said.</p><p>“Actually, I don’t know a lot about <em>Y/N</em>’s family besides Jacob…” Penny admitted.</p><p>“<em>Y/L/N</em>’s parents work in the Ministry, I heard they are pretty strict.” Merula said seriously. “Before you ask, I did a little research about <em>Y/L/N</em> after the whole Rita Skeeter thing.” She muttered, rolling her eyes a bit.</p><p>“I think my parents mentioned them once.” Tulip said.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly the door opened and Rakepick and you walked out of the classroom. Everyone was staring at you.</p><p>“What?” You asked, raising your eyebrow.</p><p>Rakepick shook her head. “Come, Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>.” She said, leading you away from your friends and Merula.</p><p>“Where do you think Rakepick is taking her to?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I have no clue…” Rowan said, frowning a little.</p><p>“Whatever is going to happen might not be good.” Tulip muttered.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>“I got a letter from my parents yesterday.” Barnaby said before taking a sip from his butterbeer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Barnaby and you decided to grab a butterbeer together after a duel. You actually lost to him, but it was a really close call. You knew Barnaby was getting better at duelling and it was hard to keep up with him when you were so busy with other stuff.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Was it a nice letter?” You asked him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, I think it is always nice to hear from them when they are so far away from home.” He admitted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I guess that makes sense.” You said, giving him a small smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That makes me wonder, how is your relationship with your parents?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You honestly want to know?” You asked, raising an eyebrow.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s just that I never hear you talk about your parents.” Barnaby pointed out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, since you have told me about your parents, I guess it would only be fair if I told you about mine at least once.” You said with a sigh.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You don’t really seem to be okay with it.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You gave him a small smile again. “My parents and I don’t get along at all. They didn’t get along with Jacob and I ever since we were small.” You said honestly. “There isn’t really a relationship between my parents and I.” You summarised.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Is it that bad?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It is pretty bad, but nothing I can’t handle. I just have to get out of there once I’m old enough.” You said with a shrug. “I’m just glad to be at Hogwarts the majority of the time.”</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Y/N, you should step away from the Fire Crab, if you don’t want to get burnt.” Liz said when she approached you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You shook your head and jumped back. That was indeed a close call. “Thanks for warning me, Liz.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No problem. You seemed to be a little distracted, so I thought it would be a good thing to help you out.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah, I was pretty distracted I think…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Try to stay focused.” Liz said with a smile. “If you are not feeling too well, I guess I could help you out this lesson. Keeping you focused on the task.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That would be great, Liz.”</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Woah! Y/N!” Andre shouted when you nearly fell off your broom because of a vision. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Charlie had flown beside you and steadied you. “Are you all right, Y/N?” He asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You blinked a bit and then you gave them a smile. “Yeah, I’m fine. I think I lost my focus for a moment.” You said when you slowly landed on the ground again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Charlie and Andre landed beside you and looked concerned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You could have got seriously hurt, Y/N.” Andre said honestly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You were pretty high up after all.” Charlie said. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I know, it’s just that I haven’t slept really well last night. I’m sorry for scaring you two.” You said.</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ben was about to send a letter to his parents and went to the Owlery. He blinked when he heard someone letting out a cry of frustration. He peeked into the Owlery and saw you standing there.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Thanks for being so bloody supportive, father and mother….” You muttered while ripping the letter in pieces. “I swear… As if I don’t have enough to deal with…” You muttered to yourself. Once you were done you stormed out of the Owlery, not even seeing Ben when you passed him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ben hesitated if he should say something to you, but seeing you so angry let him know you weren’t up for any conversations now.</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“What you are telling me, is that you have foreseen the students getting trapped in paintings?”</p><p>You were in Dumbledore’s office with Madam Rakepick. She helped you with explaining the situation. The ability was quite useful in her eyes, but since you are an underage witch she can’t just decide things for you.</p><p>“Yes, I have foreseen it happening sometimes. I don’t know how it happened, but I have seen them in the paintings.” You said honestly.</p><p>“If I may, Headmaster, I would like to make a deal with miss <em>Y/L/N</em> to tell me about her visions so we can figure out how to prevent it from happening again.” Madam Rakepick said.</p><p>“That would be a good idea indeed.” Dumbledore said. “However, this doesn’t mean I want miss <em>Y/L/N</em> to break the rules again…” He said seriously.</p><p>“But Professor…” You spoke up, wondering if you should tell him about Jacob. “… Never mind.” You mumbled, looking away.</p><p>“If there is something else you need to tell me, you may tell me.” He said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You hesitated for a moment. “It’s about Jacob.” You began. “The vision I had in class wasn’t about a student getting stuck in a painting. It was about Jacob.”</p><p>“What was it about?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>“He was there in the Forbidden Forest, talking to me. He said my eyes were valuable and that people were testing my abilities.”</p><p>Dumbledore frowned a little. “Go on…”</p><p>“He said something about them wanting me to become their personal Seer, in order to succeed. Also, as much as I don’t like the thought, Jacob doesn’t seem like himself anymore… I’m not sure if he can be trusted at this point.”</p><p>“That could mean the students who are trapped inside the paintings aren’t a part of the new curse that was released by the Cursed Vaults.” Madam Rakepick said. “Although, these people might be after the Cursed Vaults.”</p><p>“That is a good point, Madam Rakepick.” He said.</p><p>“Perhaps it would be a good idea miss <em>Y/L/N</em> actually follows through with that vision. Of course, these visions aren’t set in stone if she can change the situation herself, but I think it would be a good idea if miss <em>Y/L/N</em> meets Jacob <em>Y/L/N</em> in the Forbidden Forest.” She said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“You want me to meet up with Jacob?” You asked, confused why Madam Rakepick wanted you to meet Jacob in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>“Why do you want that, Madam Rakepick? You must have an idea if you want that vision to happen.” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>“You see, it might give us more information about who are trying to hinder anyone who is directly and indirectly involved with the Cursed Vaults. Perhaps Jacob <em>Y/L/N</em> could tell us a lot more.” Madam Rakepick explained.</p><p>“It’s an unusual request. However, I agree it might give us more information about the things that are happening in Hogwarts lately.” He said. “I also think it is about time we learn the truth about Jacob <em>Y/L/N</em>’s disappearance.”</p><p>“So, you both want me to go into the Forbidden Forest when he is there?” You asked, wondering if you heard them correctly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, miss <em>Y/L/N</em>, I will be somewhere close when it happens. Although, you probably don’t even notice me when my help isn’t needed.” She said with a smile.</p><p>“What do you say about it, miss <em>Y/L/N</em>? Do you want to do this?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>You wondered if the world around you became mad. Nobody seemed to make sense at the moment. You didn’t understand why Dumbledore suddenly wanted you to go into the Forbidden Forest to meet Jacob, even though you told him you weren’t sure if you could trust Jacob. You also were told you would have less detention during the year. It would give you an opportunity to rest a little more, which was something you needed. It didn’t mean you wouldn’t have detention anymore.</p><p>You weren’t allowed to talk about your plans in the Forbidden Forest. Rakepick ordered you not to tell Merula and Bill either. She said it was for your own good. It wasn’t like you were planning to tell them, after all, you didn’t want to talk about your visions. It wasn’t an ability you wanted to have. You didn’t want to foresee things happening to other people. Your parents made it clear the ability was just rubbish.</p><p>‘<em>You probably just dreamt it, Y/N</em>.’ ‘<em>That is called coincidence</em>.’</p><p>You could already see the look on your parents face when they figure out you still deal with those ‘<em>visions’</em> of yours. They probably would be disgusted when they find out your teachers encouraged you to tell them about it.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Y/N</em>…”</p><p>You stopped walking, seeing Penny was standing there in front of you. If there was someone you were avoiding lately, it was definitely Penny. It wasn't because you didn’t like being around her, you just felt guilty about what happened to Beatrice. If you didn’t make yourself believe the vision was just a nightmare, you might have prevented it from happening.</p><p>“<em>Y/N</em>, what is going on? Everyone is worried about you… You are acting differently lately. I… I just want to know how you are doing.” She said.</p><p>You gave Penny a small smile. “It’s nothing, Penny.” You told her and you were about to walk off again.</p><p>Penny grabbed your hand, preventing you from walking away. You looked at her and noticed she was crying. “Stop lying to me!” She said seriously. “I want to know the truth! Why are you keeping everyone in the dark? We are your friends!”</p><p>“You don’t want to hear the truth, believe me… The truth is very ugly… It’s better if you don’t get involved.” You said seriously, looking down at your feet.</p><p>“But why?” She asked. “Why can’t you tell us what is going on.”</p><p>“Because it’s too dangerous.” You said honestly, pulling your hand away. “I can’t talk about it, I’m sorry.” You quickly walked away from her.</p><p>No, you couldn’t tell her. Especially not about tonight. You knew it was the night you would meet Jacob in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Bill blinked when he saw everyone, except you, comforting Penny in the Great Hall. She was sobbing softly. Tonks had wrapped an arm around her, Liz rubbed her back gently and the others were trying to talk with Penny.</p><p>“What is going on?” Bill asked.</p><p>“Penny decided to ask <em>Y/N</em> about why she is acting differently.” Tulip said.</p><p>“And apparently, <em>Y/N</em> told Penny it was better if she didn’t know the truth.” Andre continued.</p><p>“S…she said it would be too dangerous….” Penny said softly.</p><p>“I don’t know what <em>Y/N</em> is planning, but it doesn’t sound too good…” Charlie said, frowning a little.</p><p>“I didn’t know it was this bad… I mean, I noticed <em>Y/N</em> was acting differently, but it sounds like she is up to no good.” Bill said, wondering what could be going on.</p><p>“She did have a long conversation with Professor Rakepick and Dumbledore.” Ben said honestly.</p><p>“Wait, did you say she went to Dumbledore?” Charlie asked.</p><p>“Well, I saw her walking out of his office with Professor Rakepick. She seemed to be troubled by something.” Ben continued.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“How about we spy on <em>Y/N</em>?” Tulip suggested.</p><p>“What?” Everyone said.</p><p>“We all want to know what is going on with <em>Y/N</em>, right? She is definitely dealing with something and she is refusing our help for a reason… We just have to figure out what is going on.” Tulip explained.</p><p>“As much as I don’t like the idea of spying on one of my best friends, I think it is the best option we have.” Rowan said honestly.</p><p>“If we can help <em>Y/N</em> with it, I suppose I’m in.” Andre said.</p><p>“Count me in as well.” Tonks said.</p><p>The rest also agreed to spy on you to figure out what is going on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Definitely a good idea, Karasu.”</p><p>Tulip frowned and shot a look to Merula, who walked up to the group. “What do you want, Snyde?”</p><p>“I want to join your little activity. Rakepick wouldn’t tell me anything about it when I asked her.” Merula said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“Why should we let <em>you</em> join?” Tonks asked.</p><p>“To help <em>Y/N</em> out. I have to work with her and the oldest Weasley, remember?”</p><p>Tulip sighed. “What do you think, Bill? Can she be trusted?”</p><p>“So far she hasn’t done anything bad to <em>Y/N</em> whenever we had to work together.” Bill said honestly.</p><p>“I guess that means you can join us.” Tulip muttered. “I will keep a close eye on you though.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Karasu. I won’t betray you.” Merula said, making Tulip grimace.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The gang and Merula were pretty good at spying on you. At least, they thought they were doing a good job. Rowan had woken everyone up when you had left the common room. They were all in time to follow you before you would be out of their sight. It didn’t take too long before they realised where you were headed to.</p><p>“Really? She is going to the Forbidden Forest on her own?” Charlie muttered to the others.</p><p>“Is that really a surprise? I thought she went to the Forbidden Forest alone multiple times.” Merula mumbled back.</p><p>“No, she never went alone. At least, I think she never went alone.” Charlie said.</p><p>“I’m not so sure about that, Charlie.” Rowan said honestly.</p><p>“What make you think so?” Charlie asked.</p><p>“Well, <em>Y/N</em> has snuck out of the castle more times than you think.” Rowan answered softly.</p><p>“Can you please be quiet, Charlie? We have to focus.” Tulip muttered. “We can’t let <em>Y/N</em> out of our sight.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They blinked when you suddenly grabbed your wand, pointing it to a certain direction. They were worried you had seen them, but you weren’t pointing it to their direction.</p><p>“I know you are there.” You said seriously, still pointing your wand at the same direction.</p><p>They could hear someone chuckle. “I can’t fool you, can I?” The voice said.</p><p>“It would have been easier to fool me if I didn’t know I was going to meet you here.” You said honestly.</p><p>“You have a good point, <em>Y/N</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does she know this guy?” Barnaby asked, wondering who was under the black cloak.</p><p>“Apparently… I don’t have a good feeling about this…” Rowan said.</p><p>“Do you think <em>Y/N</em> has gone bad…?” Penny asked, looking concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“Jacob, instead of wasting time, how about you tell me what you are doing here?” You asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Jacob? The cloaked guy is Jacob?” Charlie said.</p><p>“Shh!” Tulip quickly shushed Charlie, wanting to hear what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>“You have become quite serious, <em>Y/N</em>. Then again, I can’t blame you for that. The way we were raised didn’t allow us to fool around after all. Or is it the fact you haven’t slept well in a long time?”</p><p>“It beats me, could be a combination of both.” You said, rolling your eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Very well, let’s get to business.” Jacob began. “Your eyes are valuable, <em>Y/N</em>. They are testing your abilities by doing bad things to the people around you. You were probably aware of seeing me here today.”</p><p>“Why are you warning me about this, Jacob?” You asked, knowing the answer.</p><p>“Because they want you as their personal Seer. You have the ability to see bad situations happening in the future, something they want in order to succeed.”</p><p>“Then why did I see you in my vision?” You said, not wanting to chance the vision.</p><p>“You see, I’m not the same person anymore, <em>Y/N</em>.” He said, raising his wand at you. “It might take a while before they will find you again after this. Don’t go looking for me.”</p><p>“Let me guess, you are going to use <em>Petrificus Totalus</em> on me? That’s not very creative, Jacob.” You mumbled.</p><p>“I have heard stories about that.” Jacob said. “You want me to do something else?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>.”</p><p>Suddenly, Jacob was on the ground and Madam Rakepick stepped out of the shadows.</p><p>“I guess it has become a family thing now, mister <em>Y/L/N</em>.” Rakepick said with a smirk. “Good job distracting him, miss <em>Y/L/N</em>.”</p><p>“I just did what I had to do.” You said with a shrug. “Who is going to move Jacob back to the castle?”</p><p>“I will, with the help of another teacher.” She said. “Also, I think it would be time for the other students to reveal themselves.” She said, looking to the spot where your friends and Merula were hiding.</p><p>You raised an eyebrow when they revealed themselves. “What are you guys doing here?”</p><p>“They have been following you, miss <em>Y/L/N</em>. To be honest, I only noticed them when you arrived here.” She said, giving your friends and Merula a stern look.</p><p>“In our defence, we just wanted to know what was going on with <em>Y/N Y/L/N</em>.” Tulip said.</p><p> </p><p>“You can all explain it during detention with Professor Rakepick tomorrow.” Dumbledore said when he appeared with Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape.</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore?” Rowan said surprised.</p><p>“Minerva, could you escort the students out of the Forbidden Forest?”</p><p>“Of course, Albus.” Professor McGonagall said before she looked at your friends and Merula.</p><p>“Miss <em>Y/L/N</em>, we still need your assistance here.” Dumbledore said.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Have you seen <em>Y/N</em> this morning?” Tulip asked Rowan when everyone was on their way to detention.</p><p>“No, I haven’t seen her all day.” Rowan answered with a sigh.</p><p>“I can’t believe I thought <em>Y/N</em> became a dark witch for a moment.” Penny mumbled, feeling bad about what happened.</p><p>“I think most of us were worried about that for a moment.” Charlie admitted.</p><p>“Actually, I was wondering what they are going to with Jacob.” Tulip pointed out.</p><p>“They have captured Jacob, so that means they will probably question him.” Andre said.</p><p>“What if they contacted the Ministry of Magic?” Bill questioned. “They probably want to know how Jacob got a new wand…”</p><p>“Man, this is probably going to suck for <em>Y/N</em>.” Charlie mumbled.</p><p>“Hey, isn’t that <em>Y/N</em> in front of the Defence of Dark Arts classroom?” Barnaby pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>Your friends quickly walked over to you.</p><p>“<em>Y/N</em>, what are you doing here?” Penny asked.</p><p>“I wanted to see you all before you have detention.” You told them.</p><p>“Look, <em>Y/N</em>… If this about us spying on you… It was my idea. If you are angry about it, you can blame me.” Tulip said.</p><p>You shook your head. “It’s not about that. Although, I’m not too happy about you guys spying on me.” You admitted. “Anyways, I wanted to tell you I will be gone the rest of the week.”</p><p>“What? Where are you going?” Rowan asked.</p><p>“To London. I have to be there during Jacob’s hearing at the Ministry.” You said honestly.</p><p>“They are holding a trial against Jacob?” Bill asked.</p><p>You nodded. “I have to be present during the trial, since I was involved last night.”</p><p>“Who else have to come to the trial?” Rowan asked.</p><p>“Madam Rakepick and Dumbledore also have to show up for the trial.” You told them. “They were aware of the situation, because I informed them about Jacob.”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t answer all the questions though…” Tulip pointed out.</p><p>“Tulip, this might not be the right time…” Penny mumbled.</p><p>“No, this needs to be asked.” Tulip said seriously. “What did Jacob mean with ‘<em>they wanted to test your abilities</em>’ and ‘<em>they want you as their personal Seer</em>’?”</p><p>“I think you already figured it out, Tulip.” You said with a small grin.</p><p>Most of your friends seemed to be confused and looked at Tulip.</p><p>“That means you are a Seer.” Andre pointed out for the others.</p><p>You nodded. “An ability I have ignored for quite a while to be honest. I suppose I can explain it to you better once I get back.” You said, looking away a little. “I especially need to explain things to you, Penny.”</p><p>“To me?” Penny asked surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, I owe it to you.” You said seriously. “Sorry, I have to go now. I promise I will be back before you know it.” You said before you waved goodbye.</p><p> </p><p>Before they could even say something, Madam Rakepick opened the door to her classroom.</p><p>“Let’s begin, shall we?” Madam Rakepick said.</p><p>Your friends took one more glance at you before they entered the classroom for detention. They knew they would probably learn more about it once you came back.</p>
