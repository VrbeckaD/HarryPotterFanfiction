  <u>After the Final Battle at Hogwarts</u>

</p><p>Harry looked around. In the area near him he saw Ron and Hermione lying on the ground, their eyes blank as they lay together. He moved towards them and saw that Ron was partially on top of Hermione as though protecting her to the last, even in death. Harry carefully closed the eyes of his adopted kin.</p><p>He saw movement out of the corner of his eye and looked up sharply, only to see Luna rocking back and forth with tears rolling silently down her cheeks. Neville’s body held tightly in her arms as she cried.</p><p>The only thing Harry could truly focus on was the pain on her face as he knew it echoed his own. Almost all of those that they loved were dead. For him it was the brother and sister of his heart and a good friend. For Luna it was a beloved betrothed and her friends.</p><p>Upon reaching her Harry pulled Luna into his arms, trying to offer what comfort he could though his own pain. Luna wailed, “I had just found out I was pregnant! I was going to tell him after the battle. It would have been something to celebrate beside the war being over.” Sobs shook her body. Harry felt the numbness spread. Something that should have been good news was now overshadowed by loss.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Luna. I know how you loved him. He would have been so happy to be a father, especially with you as the mother.”</p><p>Harry knew that the two weren’t soul mates, but they had loved each other fiercely, and they magic was compatible enough to ground them both. Even if they had found their true mates, they would have been happy to be a part of each other’s lives and still loved the other,  but in a different way. A child would have only been something else to love about the other.</p><p>“It’s not fair! After everything that has happened, why could we not have the chance to live? Did he not earn the chance to have seen his child?”</p><p>“I do not know Luna. I wish we could all be together and happy again. Ron had asked Hermione to marry him, and I know they wanted a large brood of children. Neville had talked to me about asking you to marry him. He felt that despite not being soul mates that you could be happy together, and if either of you found your mates then a part of the marriage contract would make it so the marriage could be dissolved. He would have loved your child. I wish we could still be happy.” As the last sentence finished leaving his mouth a white light shone around them and the battlefield faded out of focus.</p><p>Harry and Luna were worried but couldn’t bring up the energy to attempt to defend themselves. They could tell that they were in another place, but could still see that which had been. In fact it was like there were many places they could almost see, yet it was just sight.</p><p>“Do not worry children.” A voice said. The voice seemed male yet female, young and old, quiet and loud. “No harm will come to you here.” As the voice said this, the two survivors slowly relaxed. It was like they were being calmed but their own emotions weren’t removed. “We are the Valar, and we heard your wish. We have seen your lives, the joys and pain, the friendships and betrayals. We have decided to grant your wish. There is a price though. Since you will never have the peace that you need in the wizarding world, we will send you to a new world. You will be sent to a world of Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits. There you will become children again. You will have the chance to grow without the hardships that you faced in this life.</p><p>Do not fear, young Luna, for the child you carry. It will still be with you. The True Mates for you both are in this world. Once you have found them and are ready, we will place the child in you again. It will still be your Neville’s child so fear not that you would lose that part of him.</p><p>Both your memories will remain, but the intensity will be lessened, so that you can heal from that which has been done to you.</p><p>Be wary though, for despite the peace in the world, there is also suffering and death. Wars wills come in the future, but you will have the choice on whether to join or not. There is no destiny for you follow now, only your own hearts desires. Live your lives as you want.”</p><p>With their fears being addressed before they could fully form, Luna merely asked, “What can we bring with us?”</p><p>“You will have all that is on you as well bottomless bags with clothing, food and money. When you arrive you will be sleeping for during that time we will be giving the languages that you need to know as well as the geography and history of the world, so you will not be lost amongst the different peoples.”</p><p>“What about our magic? Will we still keep that?” Harry asked a thread of worry in his heart. What was being offered felt too good to be true. Rarely had someone helped him because they could without asking for something in return.</p><p>“Your magic is a part of you. To remove it would leave you diminished. In the world we are sending you to, there are five wizards called Istari. Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, and the two Blues Alatar and Pallando. We will need to change your magic as it is connected to the power of your old world. The change will connect you to the Earth, Sky and Stone. You be known as the Emerald Istari and Luna the Bronze for she will be connected to Fire, Water and Metal. Because of the change in your power, you will need to train it. You will be the youngest of the Istari.”</p><p>“Let us go, Harry. There is nothing else for us here.” Luna said hope in her voice. Harry nodded, for he too was beginning to hope that this new life would be all that he could ever want and more. Just the chance at meeting his soul mate was something that decided him.</p><p>“Then close your eyes children, and when you wake you will be there.”</p><p>Sleep pulled them under and their last thought was that they were glad they could be together in this new life.</p>
