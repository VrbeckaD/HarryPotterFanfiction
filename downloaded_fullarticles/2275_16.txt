    <span>I do believe,</span>

    <span>You are mine enemy</span>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’s not the same as he used to be. Nobody is. All empty shells of themselves wandering the castle so hollowly it’d be easy to mistake them for one of the many ghosts haunting the premises anyway. But that’s the last thing Hogwarts needs. More ghosts. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s been a week. Maybe two. Maybe even three, but Draco knows it hasn’t been a month yet. If it had been a month, he’d already be hearing the hype over Halloween which seemed to flood through the most enthusiastic students from even as early as the first of October. But maybe it has been a month and he’s just not listening for the autumnal buzz. Maybe nobody is buzzing at all, nobody can bring themselves to buzz only a few months after such a bloody battle. He hasn’t been very good at listening lately. All sounds seem to meld together, all muted and fuzzy as though he were underwater, constantly suppressed by the weight of an ocean. Or sometimes the noise is drowned out by the steadily growing crackle of a fire until it consumes him whole and he’s shaking and all he sees is red, despite the chill everyone else feels.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s hell being back here. Not the same kind of hell he’d been living through for the past few years of his life. But it’s hell all the same.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He does well not to dwell on that though, reminding himself that there are so many people here who have gone through worse, because of him. That some people are not even still here to wallow in the hell they’ve been put through.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>He doesn’t think it’s fair, but nothing really is. He’s a Malfoy. Suppose to carry that name with pride, it promised him a fruitful life, one that would warrant respect. Now it’s spit at him like poison at his feet. Where was the fairness in that?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There is none.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d done everything he was suppose to in order to protect the name. Been sorted into slytherin, excelled at everything he put his mind to, sans maybe killing Dumbledore, kept his icy eyes on his enemies-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Taken the dark mark. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d done everything that promised would bring righteousness to him. It didn’t. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>When his mind dares to claim that he had been fighting for the wrong side all along, that muggleborns were just as worthy, and that he deserves everything that’s come to him, he shuts it out. Drowns it along with the rest of the muffled world. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Right now he can’t handle that. Handle that everything that’s been spoon fed to him since infancy is wrong and a lie, because if that’s true then he doesn’t know who he is, and that’s the only thing that’s keeping him from slipping away and joining the real ghosts that haunt the castle. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>That and maybe the thought of the whispers that would follow of ‘coward’ and ‘weakling’. No sense in worrying about disgracing the Malfoy name when it’s nothing but shambles now anyway.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco doesn’t know why he’s here. Back at Hogwarts. Obviously to take his N.E.W.T.S, but what good will that do him in a world that sneers in his face. Something about his trials but he’d sat through them a million miles away, like if he’d dropped the memory into a pensive but the pensive was a lake and he sat suspended in the water. Draco had been there physically but not there enough to feel like the ‘yes’s and ‘no’s coming out of his mouth were his own, not enough to hear what they’d decided on for him and the rest of his family and nobody bothered to fill him in. Just packed up his bags, handed him his now restricted wand- which wouldn’t bloody work that well anyway because the unicorn hair that always supposedly represented the ‘good’ deep down inside him (Draco scoffed at that) had found its allegiance mishandled and was on its way to dying (they warned him about that but he never thought he’d lose his wand to Harry Potter)- </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Draco takes a deep breath.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wand core needs replacing, or maybe he needs a new wand entirely. But the ministry likely won’t care for such frivolities. He’ll cross that bridge when he gets to it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His wand can handle simple spells like accio and incendio, but anything beyond that is a lost cause. Not like the teachers would have asked him to perform such spells in class anyway. He neglects to volunteer and they neglect to call on him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sliding into an empty seat in the back, Draco sets his things down without flourish, knowing it will be pointless if he tries to focus on the lesson. Ever since he got back, ever since the battle really, things felt farther away and harder to concentrate on. He wants to pass his exams but he’s not desperate to the point where he’ll ask for help. Not yet anyway. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Pushing a strand of hair out of his eyes- it’s grown out again, not unlike third year and he’s too lazy to cut it, unless it gets to being reminiscent of his father- Draco sets his resolve on taking notes, letting the words come into his ear and guide his quill. Hopefully it’ll be enough for him to study from later, when he’s not feeling so restless, but that’s almost always. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When the other students pick up their wands, he lets his quill fall, and lets out a quiet sigh. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>More people had returned than he expected. It seems that, just like him, there was no better place to be. This place was home, despite all that had fallen upon it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And of course he watches Harry. And Ron and Hermione. It’s not as bad as before. He’s not stalking, no prying or eavesdropping. Sometimes he even has the willpower to turn his eyes away from the three. But not now. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>While his mind is away, pondering what exactly he doesn’t know, Draco feels a jolt of fear rip through him as Harry turns around and catches him staring. After all this time he still seems to know. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Averting his gaze, Draco twitches and picks up his quill again, underlining important notes, his other hand shoved into his lap curled tightly into a fist. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s not enough. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Care to try and join the rest of the class?” Harry asks, with no particular tone but it’s still restrained. Like he’s not sure whether he came over to pick a fight or be a good classmate. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t,” Draco simply answers. He pulls his wand out of his robe and discards it on his desk. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The other picks it up, giving an experimental wave and uttering the incantation that should be more familiar but isn’t. And he frowns. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why haven’t you told anyone your wand is broken? Why don’t you get a new one?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“People like me can’t just waltz into a wand shop and get a new one,” the blonde answers, only a little bitter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry falters. “Still,” he leans in and lowers his voice. “You sitting around and moping isn’t doing anything to help and is making everyone here a bit uncomfortable.” He slides the wand back onto Draco’s desk. “I’ll mention it to Mcgonagall.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wants to have some kind of comeback. Words like ‘don’t you ever stay out of other people’s business?’, laced with venom like their old rivalry used to warrant. But he knows better. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Turning away, he can feel green eyes burning into him, and the next moment they’re gone. But Harry Potter’s got this thing about him that makes Draco’s skin crawl. He tries to manage it, fidgeting slightly but that’s not enough. Serpents glide under his arms, eye twitching, he pushes his hand up his sleeve and brings his nails up to his inner forearm and attempts to soothe the prickling. Scratches his arm until it’s raw and red and blood gathers under his nails. It’s the Dark Mark. He can feel it like it’s still undulating. It’s long dead. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Everyday Draco skips dinner, ignoring the way it makes his head spin, opting to study in his room instead. Chugging smuggled firewhiskey seems to help with the ache, even though he knows he really shouldn’t be giving them anymore reason to lock him up, it’s a vice all the same. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s been four days since the incident with Potter and his wand- he keeps going back between calling him Harry and calling him Potter because some days he wants to slink away and pretend nothing ever happened, and some days he wants to wake up and hurl ‘Potter’ across the room like no one else ever could- when Draco is making his way down the hall to the library to fill in the gaps of information his notes are missing. Stumbling along as well as he can, Draco’s too busy focusing on the cracks in the stone and not falling over that he collides into someone’s shoulder. It sends him back a step and he’s about to open his mouth to apologize or maybe retaliate when his eyes and brain work together to register one word- Potter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Got somewhere so important to be that you’re finally crawling out of your room, Malfoy?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he spits. “The library. Got someone so important to stalk that you’d skip dinner?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s mouth pulls into a fine line, his eyes flaring before he replies. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t flatter yourself.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Save it, you git.” Draco attempts to maneuver around him, to continue on his path, but not before leaning down to emphasize his point, hot breath shallow against the lenses of Harry’s glasses. “Didn’t I tell you to mind your own business?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His robes billowing behind him, Draco thinks he’s managed to escape when a hand enclosed around his wrist, yanking him back and sideways into the wall. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you drunk?” Harry asks lowly, accusingly, of some scent on Malfoy’s words. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not enough to deal with this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And he’s gone. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> He’s on his way back to his room, tucking parchment away, when Draco feels eyes on his back. Potter. Not even being subtle about it. Of course there doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>appear </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be anyone following him, but Draco had put together that there had to be some way Harry followed him all sixth year without being seen. To the untrained ear, there’s no accompanying set of footsteps or restricted breathing. But the blonde hears it well enough, either unaware or hyper focused on the world around him. He’s hyper focused now, everything seems to be amplified, which means he’s not nearly inebriated enough.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Nothing a quick trip to his dorm won’t fix.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco swears silently, hoping that once Potter realizes he isn’t up to anything, he’ll screw off and leave Malfoy to drown in his sorrows. Fat chance.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He slips into the eighth year common room, into his own space, and tucks a bottle of firewhiskey into his robes. And instead of resigning to his bed, the floor, or the bathroom, he finds his legs haphazardly carrying him to one of the last places he would logically want to be while drunk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>The astronomy tower.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s not until he’s leaning over the edge does he realize it, the bottle half empty, and he wonders if he’d be doing the rest of the world a favor by pitching himself off of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Giving a haughty, but quiet laugh, Draco shakes his head and takes a step back. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Come here to gloat?” Potter spits, and suddenly Draco finds himself against the cold stone ground, pushed down by none other than the savior himself, and struggling to keep his bottle from spilling entirely, he lets out another pathetic laugh. It grows and grows until he’s cackling, holding onto his side with his free arm, something red and warm dribbling down his temple.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Harry is pissed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh get up you blithering idiot! Fight back!...” Harry seethes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not a chance” is all he gets, with an amused grin. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What happened to you? To that attitude?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What happened to that attitude? What happened to that attitude was it lead me down the wrong path and people died,” Draco hiccups, sitting up his brows furrowed and suddenly it’s not as funny as it was twelve seconds ago. “People died and I sat idly by regardless of whether I thought they deserved it or not, so now I’m facing the consequences! If I so much raised my eyes to you, let alone a fist or an insult or merlin forbid, my wand, I’d be in Azkaban before you could count to ten! So sorry if I refuse to entertain your childish games and schoolboy fights anymore Potter. Not everything is about you- not everyone can cater to your every whim!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes flicker with something fierce.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“There it is. Knew you had it in you, you snake.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not there,” Draco deadpans, lifting the bottle of alcohol to his lips and chugging whatever is left. “You could point your wand at me and I’d do nothing about it”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’d let people kick you while you’re down?” Harry breathes with some incredible disbelief, like the boy slouched before him is but an imposter</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh absolutely,” Draco nods. “If you let them kick you while you’re down, no matter how bad you are, you’ll know you’re at least above them.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco tilts his chin up, the point of his nose catches in the light and suddenly Harry remembers the time on the train, where he laid petrified and Draco’s foot came down stomping on his nose, the crunching of bones, and he questions the validity of his statement.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You should have kicked me while I was down,” the blonde continues, unsure of why but it’s probably got something to do with the mixture of firewhiskey and brandy in his system. “All bloodied out and draining.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I would never-“ Harry starts but Draco replies with ‘exactly’ and he thinks he can start to understand. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s why you and I are so different.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There’s a heavy silence, then Harry sighs.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“What are you doing up here then, if you’re not celebrating that night in some odd way?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Celebrating?” Draco breathes, wrinkling his nose. “Honestly I knew you were dense but this-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I could do without the insults-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t want to do it, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Swallowing thickly, the blonde looks at his pale reflection in the glass, not recognizing the face staring back.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“I didn’t want to kill him. Surely you must have been able to tell. You-” he narrows his eyes, head swimming, trying to recall the testimony he sat through yet so far away. “You were here that night. You said you saw me lowering my wand. I didn’t want to do it, you must have known, so why would you think I’m celebrating?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I said you wouldn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>be able </span>
  </em>
  <span>to do it. Not that it made you good, it just made you-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A coward,” Draco finishes for him. “Just like my father.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There’s another silence, both boys- no, men- staring out into the eerie room. Then he’s reliving that night all over against, green flashing behind his eyelids and he’s worried he’s about to heave up the alcohol in his stomach all over the floor. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well you’re right. Couldn’t even throw myself off this tower.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Dra-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You need to go!” Draco yells, struggling to stand, terrified of the first syllable that had come out of Harry’s mouth and too afraid to hear the second, afraid of what it might mean. He stumbles to the wall, holding himself up. “Get out!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re absolutely pissed, aren’t you?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I said go away Potter!” His chest is heaving, up and down up and down, getting heavier by the second. Nobody can see him like this. Especially not Potter. It’s weak and he’s already weak and everyone knows it but this is a final blow he almost can’t handle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pupils blown and his body trembling, Draco glances around the room, to the empty bottle in his hand, and then to Harry. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He slams the bottle into the solid wall, glass shattering in sprays to the floor, until he’s left only with the jagged bottleneck and he holds it out, a weapon. It’s shouldn’t be threatening in the slightest, but he knows he can’t do any damage with his wand. The dazed look in his eye, and rigid stance seems to have instilled </span>
  <em>
    <span>something </span>
  </em>
  <span>into Harry though.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Go on and run to your little Gryffindor friends, get out and go away and let me suffer on my own! Go on and tell the world! But leave me my last shred of dignity. Fucking Saint Potter. Always needs to be somebody’s hero.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy, you’re pissed and bleeding and-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And what? He shouts “And pathetic? And mental?”</span>
  <span></span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you need to put that down.” Harry gestures to the glass with his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Or else you’ll do what?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Or else I might suggest to someone that you’re not coping as well as your grades would suggest. That between all that alcohol and those skipped dinners and bloodied fingernails and talk about pitching yourself off towers that you might need a mind healer before you’re even allowed to pick up a wand again.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The room is spinning.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why can’t you leave me be?” Draco whispers, the words coming out crooked and trembling. “Is no amount of stalking enough? How many of my life debts do you </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span>? You’re not my </span>
  <em>
    <span>friend, </span>
  </em>
  <span>you made that absolutely clear.” The bottleneck in his hand is faltering, lowering just like it did that night. “So let it go.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At his hesitance, Harry makes his move, snatching the broken glass from Draco’s hand and sending it to the floor, to join the rest of the shards that crunch under his feet when he steps forward, pinning Draco to the wall. He’s too drunk to stop it, processing it only too late and by then there’s nothing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know more about you then you think,” Harry murmurs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, that I like being pushed into walls and floors?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That, and-” He mutters </span>
  <em>
    <span>accio dittany</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and a small vial comes flying out of Draco’s bag from across the room. “You keep this with you for that arm of yours you can’t seem to stop scratching.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Paling, the blonde says nothing as Harry soothes the cut on his forehead away, then slides the vial into one of Draco’s pockets when he’s done. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The third silence of the night overtakes them, the taller of the two looking down and breathing heavily, trying to will himself not to see stars and wishing the world would stop moving like it’s suppose to. Saint Potter doesn’t seem eager to let him go.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I-” Harry starts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco wheezes, shutting conjured images out of his mind of what might have happened next if he were braver, but he’s a slytherin and more interested in self preservation. He pushes Harry’s arms off him, mutters “bugger off,” staggering to his bag and beginning his descent of the stairs. Not before they lock eyes, and Draco hisses “I hate you.”</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The next time it happens, again, is entirely Harry’s fault. He’s stalking much like before, no doubt, because when Draco is on his way back to the eighth year dormitory, it’s like Harry knows his steps. He gets pulled into an alcove, but not without struggle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you bloody mind?!” he spits, wrestling the hands off of his body. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I do.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is taller, but he’s also weaker. His system running on not much else besides booze and sometimes bread, he can hardly put up might of a fight with Potter, lean but not so scrawny anymore. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want?” he resigns to going still. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“To talk. I want to know what the hell is up with you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Seems you know well enough from what you told me that night.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Green eyes meet grey, swimming with questions and panic and-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yknow I talked to Mcgonagall-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You told her?” Draco breathes, his eyes widening and a hand coming up to protect the mutilated mark on his forearm. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no. Not about that. About your wand. She said she would make arrangements with the Ministry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A slow breath in, a sharp exhale, and Draco is shaking his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>do that</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m- Pardon?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You can’t do that!” Draco shouts, as quietly as one can shout not to draw attention to their location. His hands are shoving Potter without permission, backing him to the opposite wall. “You can’t go around pushing me into floors and walls and making me bleed, and then being nice to me! It’s infuriating!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You like it.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No I don’t!” He screeches. “I want you to leave me the hell alone!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine,” Potter drawls, his gaze warm and challenging. “Then walk away.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Draco knows he has to. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He spins on his heel, smoothing out his robes and almost proud of himself for resisting the challenge. Sure, his past self would have loathed him for walking away from a chance to get under Potter’s skin. But now it seems to be the other way around, as faintly as he hears it, it’s still there. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s all you’re good at doing.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What did you say?” Draco’s nostrils flare as he turns around again, red heat rising up his neck. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I said, that’s all you’re good at doing. Walking away.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Malfoy is on him before he has time to blink, a nasty right hook that sends his glasses to the floor, where the blonde steps on them with a sickening snap. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry responds with a jab to the gut, knocking the wind out of the other boy, then unsurprisingly into the wall. His vision is blurry, oh so blurry, but he manages to get his hand around Draco’s neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is still taller, so his feet never dare to leave the ground, but he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>choking</span>
  </em>
  <span>, fingers clawing at Harry’s own trying to pry them off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Silver eyes search frantically, mortified, hoping that his weak flailing is enough to indicate this is a little beyond the line of what’s right and wrong and it’s definitely wrong so why does it feel so </span>
  <em>
    <span>right? </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry gives a little squeeze, watching satisfied as the red creeps up from the other’s neck into his face, and then he decides to let go. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The blonde is coughing, sputtering, rubbing the sore spots on his neck while he desperately tries to regain air. He sinks down, crouching, licking his wounds until the immediate shock has subsided. And he’s hoping the tightness in his pants will subside too, and that it’s just a side effect of the fighting, because anything else is too weird to process. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That you definitely can’t do,” he chokes out, voice raspy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And why not?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Instead of answering, Draco reaches out, grabbing the remains of the broken glasses into his palm. He stands, pressing them into Harry’s hold, before pressing his own body against the other boy’s. It’s enough to give a hint about the current state of his being- shaking and stiff with both anger and arousal. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“See how you like it,” he breathes against the shell of Potter’s ear. And with that he’s gone again. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He has to retire back to his room after that. Even though all the eighth year’s share a dorm now, Draco doesn’t want to be giving Harry anymore excuses to happen upon him. It’s obvious Potter has his routine down like the back of his hand, but maybe if he’s studying in bed instead of the library it’ll warrant some peace and more importantly, alone time. They can’t keep meeting like that. It’s imperative Draco takes every precaution necessary to prevent it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It makes his head spin to think about without any drinks helping him along. Neither is dignified but one would certainly cause more of a scandal than the other. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco can only take thinking about Potter like that up until a certain point and he’s not quite sure what it means. He guesses he should have figured it out before he went mental and pressed his erection against Potter’s leg, leaving the poor git all confused, and now he’s paying for it. He likes to think of the fighting, spit insults, punches and kicks and scratching while he’s leafing through his notes from the day. It’s when that turns to choking and teeth on his neck and being pressed into walls and floors, and anything beyond that makes him queasy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Although he had been busy with </span>
  <em>
    <span>familial affairs</span>
  </em>
  <span> and others such as </span>
  <em>
    <span>keeping himself and his parents alive</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco had had his fair share of interaction with people at one point. Enough for him to know he isn’t repressed, sexually, never was, so this revelation about Potter isn’t as surprising as it should be. He couldn’t have afforded to give much thought to pursuing a bloke, since his family name wouldn’t allow it. But now that his family name has gone to rubbish, he’s allowed to consider it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco bites back a sigh, tossing his parchment and books to the side. He isn’t sure what he wants, but that’s probably something he should figure out before the next time he runs into the gryffindor bane of his existence. Preferably he’d never have to run into him again at all. But that’s not likely. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After closing the curtains, letting his head fall back and shutting his eyes, it’s only a few moments Draco can handle of figuring things out before he gives up. An indignant huff, he stands dramatically and loosens his tie. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And suddenly he’s hungry. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It’s not by much but it’s more than anything he’s felt for the past few weeks. Dinner is still happening in the great hall, so maybe he can sneak some fruit from the bowl in the common room without any human interaction. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No longer alight with frustration, Draco makes his way to the common room, almost guiltily, and snatches a green apple from its place. They started appearing there a week ago, and Draco tries not to think about who might be behind it as he bites into the apple with a sickening crunch. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, so he’s alive.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco swallows thickly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Zabini.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Shit. The place had seemed deserted enough when he entered, Zabini’s presence had totally eluded him, albeit he’s tucked into the corner with a book. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Blaise studies him for a moment, then sets the book down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You look different.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” Draco’s frowning. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t get me wrong- you still look like shit. But it’s a different kind of shit than it has been.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you mean.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I think you do.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They’re staring each other down, still quite a bit of space between them but Draco is not eager to get closer. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’ve been drowning yourself in that swill,” Blaise continues. “But you don’t look plastered now. Even in class you seem like you’re high out of your mind. Right now though-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve never been </span>
  <em>
    <span>high out of my mind</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Draco clarifies distastefully. “And I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> drunk right now, thank you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. You ought to keep it that way.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But you said I still look like shit?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yes,” Blaise stands and crosses the room and Draco realizes he’s still holding his apple midair. “In the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ive stopped repressing my thoughts and Im finally doing some thinking, </span>
  </em>
  <span>kind of way.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The blonde’s gaze steels, but he says nothing at first. Instead, opting to set his apple down on the table before his palm goes all sticky, accepting that he’ll just have to eat around the bits that go bad. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be at dinner?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Having nothing but the truth to tell, Zabini tilts his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She put me up to it.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“P-“ Draco falters, his stony visage crumbling. “Pansy.” It’s not a question. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She misses you, you know.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know.” He’s unable to meet the partially judgemental stare, unwanting to admit he misses her too so instead he tries hopefully. “Is she doing alright?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d rather you be able to ask her yourself.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You know how she feels about alcohol.” Blaise tenses, his voice curt but then warm. “You know her dad and what it does to him and how he gets. It’s not unreasonable she doesn’t want to be around you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t act like that! Not like her father! I need it to-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You need it more than you need us. You made that clear.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Blaise!” Draco hisses. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not being sympathetic.” God Draco hates how </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost </span>
  </em>
  <span>cool and collected Blaise is. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No- you’re not being sympathetic! You know how difficult it is being back here! You deal with it your way so why don’t you let me deal with it my way!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Because you’re not dealing at all, Draco.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Blaise turns on his heel, scooping up his book, then just as he reaches the doorway, he looks over his shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You think you’re alone but you’re not. Get it together. At least for her, or maybe your mother if you could stand to feel guilty about that.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is shaking. Shaking with </span>
  <em>
    <span>rage, </span>
  </em>
  <span>as it happens to be. His jaw is so tightly clenched, hands formed into fists, white hot anger so loud in his ears he almost doesn’t catch Blaise say ‘Oh, hey Potter,’ as he exits the common room, and the returning ‘Hey Zabini’.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Potter is the last thing he needs right now. The way his eyes light up slightly at the bitten apple on the table, until his gaze makes its way up to Draco’s face then he flickers with confusion and concern and panic and-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Everything… okay?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco doesn’t bother answering. He flees up to his room, slamming the door angrily. He doesn’t have a functional wand to perform destructive, or reconstructive spells, for that matter. All this pent up frustration and he doesn’t know what-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He spins around, seeing Potter idling hesitantly in the door frame. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You will cast a Muffliato charm around me,” Draco answers, his tone dangerously even. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do it Potter.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He takes in the familiar wand movement, glad for once Potter has the common sense to follow through without questioning. Turning, he inhales sharply through his nose, and lets out an entirely too strained yell. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The scream goes on for what feels like ages, and it’s the first time he’s had real clarity in his mind for the past few weeks as the stiffness and aggression drains away from him. He gives a kick to the bed for good measure (but without shoes, it hurts more than he’ll admit). Nothing muffled, nothing dazed, and it’s quite frankly very painful. By the end of it his back is hunched, face flushed, and throat raw. He wouldn’t be surprised by the suspicion of his appearance. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Turning back around, he gives a half hearted wave, and Harry lifts the charm. Staring pensively, unsure if he should broach the room or not, he settles on “So, are you going to tell me what that was about?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t see why I should,” Draco chokes out, coughing a few times. “It’s not any of your business.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, but I thought-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You think too much.” He quickly cuts the other boy off, not wanting the conversation to turn to what ignored issues meant. “It’s Pansy. And Blaise,” he supplies, crouching down in front of his trunk and opening the lid. “They’re refusing to talk to me until I can function normally.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Normally?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Without this,” he pulls out a bottle of whiskey, holds it up in the air swirling its contents, before bringing it to his lips and taking a swig. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So you’re resolving that by… drinking more? I fail to follow the logic. And honestly, they’re not wrong. You’re a right wanker when you’ve had that stuff.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m a right wanker all the time.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shakes his head and steps over, plucking the bottle and vanishing it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey-!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s for your own good, if you want your friends back.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Not finding the will to rise, Draco stays sitting on the floor, letting his legs slide out from underneath him. His head thunks dully on the wood of the bed frame. He’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired. </span>
  </em>
  <span>So tired and every part of him wants to lash out, to send Potter reeling, but he’s not doing it, so there must be at least one part that doesn’t want to repel the company. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“If you’re done being my little savior you can run off,” he says, no bite.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Actually, I wanted to talk to you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The feeling isn’t mutual.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But Draco-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Malfoy pulls his weight off the floor and stands to his full height, which is being taller. “Spare me. I like to fight you and that’s something I know for certain. Whatever else you think this is, well then that’s your problem.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah! It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, you’ve </span>
  <em>
    <span>always </span>
  </em>
  <span>been my problem!” Harry grits. “Even before Voldemort came back- everyday it was you, doing something to make my life hell or say something against me or my friends. It’s always been you, you prat.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not my fault you’re obsessed with me.” Malfoy smirks.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I think the obsession goes both ways.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The desire to start a fight is there, not as pronounced, but definitely there. It’s a good outlet, but there’s only so many times the two can tussle before they run out of steam and then what will be left?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“When will I be able to get a new wand?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry deflates slightly at the question, his words no longer having an edge.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“McGonagall says there will be two Aurors sent up to the school this weekend to escort you to Diagon Alley.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Excellent.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Wincing slightly as he puts pressure on the foot he’d used to kick out aggression earlier, Draco returns to his bed. He’s hoping the dismissive tone will clue Harry to bugger off so that he can get more studying done. Partially immersed in loopy penmanship, there’s a few moments and he’s still not alone. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I really did want to talk to you,” Harry offers, closing the distance between them and tugging the bed curtains fully out of the way. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And I really don’t care.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But we can’t just-“</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Look,” Draco deadpans, marking his page and closing the open textbook. “If you’re going to keep stalking me and initiating things, I reckon I’ve got the right to defend myself. Just stay clear of things like pinning me to walls and floors and choking me, and we won’t have any more problems.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Problems? Is that what we’re calling it?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Grey eyes flicker up, warningly. The glare is matched and not looked away from. Out of his peripheral. Draco can see Harry’s hand moving, reaching down and it’s wrapped around </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>tie. Green and silver contrasting against Harry’s warm skin, tugging slightly and Draco’s eyebrows shoot up.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re a nutter,” he breathes, coming out more quiet and fearful than he intends.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The silk around his neck tightens, little by little until his breathing is strained and he can feel Harry’s stare trained on him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You said something about choking?” Harry smirks, then suddenly it’s a lot harder to breath and his knee is coming up onto Draco’s bed like he’s got the idea to get in </span>
  <em>
    <span>with </span>
  </em>
  <span>him, and Draco panics, ripping the other’s wrist away and sending him stumbling back with a kick.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You plonker,” he wheezes. “Doing the opposite of what someone asks you to, climbing into someone’s bed with your </span>
  <em>
    <span>shoes on</span>
  </em>
  <span>- where were you raised?” And he’s trying so earnestly to ignore the flush on his face, or at least pretend it’s out of vexation. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“In a cupboard,” is the answer.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They don’t sit and talk it out. Not like Harry claimed he wanted to at least, before rushing head first into things like a bloody Gryffindor. It’s silent nods and mutual understanding, that something is changing between them, that they should accept it, not deny it. It’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t get me wrong, I’d still love to beat the shit out of you, but you’re not so bad all the time. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And Potter?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Malfoy?” Harry lingers in his spot.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Vanish the rest of the rest of the alcohol in the trunk before you go.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Yeah. Definitely different. </span>
</p>
