    <p>Sometimes I wished I had a time turner. Of course,it was confiscated by the ministry after the war and I was left with utterly nothing when I returned to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>And I mean it.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>I stared at myself in the mirror before muttering. "What a hopeless case."</p>
<p>The water cascaded down my cheeks as my fingers numbly held onto the sink before I let out a throaty cough.</p>
<p>"Ugly and worthless, little mudblood- that's what you are."</p>
<p>My eyes felt blank and invisible and the word feels like air to me-I simply don't give a <em>fuck </em>about anything at all.All I wanted was to get the 7th year done and over with. Pass my exams. Avoid everyone. Get a job at the ministry. Simple and easy.</p>
<p>I was not one meant for relationships of any sort. Time has been a teacher to me and I have learnt to understand that not all people are to be sociable.</p>
<p>Yes,I have become a sort of a social pariah.I don't talk to anyone anymore. It was more of a 'I'm required to answer you so I talk' of a situation and everyone seemed to accept it gradually.</p>
<p>Molly has tried talking to me and tried to owl me but I ignore her and just drink my whiskey and get along my way in my tiny flat in Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Opening the door and sauntering along the hallway, my shoes being cushioned down by the soft carpet,I stare straight into the air and make my way back to my compartment where I had it all to myself. </p>
<p>
  <em>Begging for a fist around it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Choking on my pride.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>There's no use crying about it.</em>
</p>
<p>Suddenly my chest makes contact with something hard.</p>
<p>And my vision swirls as my skull pounded as if I was being thrown a million rocks.</p>
<p>"So there's the irresponsible <em>mudblood.</em>" His icy voice drawls. "Thought my day wouldn't get better,would it?The bookworm of the golden trio literally below my feet. How sweet."</p>
<p>I don't respond but only to bore into his cold grey eyes,making myself get up and shove past him- purposefully brushing my skin against his.</p>
<p>He would love to get himself cleaned up after that.</p>
<p>Malfoy has somehow escaped the wrath of Azkaban-probably with the testimonies I gave to the wizengamot. Guess he had probably forgotten that, like how Harry and Ron did to me. </p>
<p>He was the same usual Draco,condescending and cruel. What can I expect?War has no effect on him whatsoever. After all on both sides, he has been seen as a living embodiment of God,regardless of his sickly Pureblood ideologies and whatnot.</p>
<p>And I should not care about him but like what the old Ginny said . "He's only just a cruel disgusting death eater. That's all that is left to Malfoy."</p>
<p>His voice lingers behind me. Irritated. Harsh.</p>
<p>"What's wrong,mudblood?You sad that nobody here cares about you?Are you going to cry and go back..."</p>
<p>And I tune him out as I shoved the door shut,marching back to the compartment where eyes of colour, glared back at me.</p>
<p>Nothing comes out of me before a blonde girl turns her head and snarls."Do you have any idea what is going on,idiot?"</p>
<p>My mouth opens and I gap,only for the dreaded voice behind me to answer. "Get dressed in your robes quick. We're reaching Hogwarts soon.I expect it would be in half an hour so hurry. Prefectorial duty schedules will be owled to every each of you. Meetings are compulsory for all on Wednesdays ,don't be late or points will be deducted from the houses."</p>
<p>If only I just gave the girl a snarky remark, it wouldn't be worse than Malfoy answering for me.Getting hatred was better than gathering humiliation.</p>
<p>The rest nodded, walking out of the compartment while sending me dirty glares and snickers.</p>
<p>"I wish we hadn't have a slut running for head girl."</p>
<p>"Probably all that sluttying around has gotten into her head."</p>
<p>"Good job,<em>mudblood</em>." His voice sarcastically has came close to my ear. "I just hope you won't fuck up things,like you always do."</p>
<p>And I know I won't fuck up things again because how will I do that,when I know life's at its end too?</p>
<p> </p>
