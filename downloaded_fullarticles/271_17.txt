    <p>Marigold Evans blinks up at the doctor at the end of her hospital bed and tries to parse out what he’s saying beyond the <strong>wah wah wah</strong> that she hears like a child in a <em>Peanuts</em> cartoon.  Her eyes keep watering at the too bright lights until they dim partway through the trombone noises coming from the doctor and her gaze flits to the doorway.  A nurse offers her a comforting smile.  Mari returns it out of reflex.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“—co-ma—”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Mari croaks, “what?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The doctor frowns at her, while the nurse brings her a cup of ice chips to suck on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ve been in a coma for the last ten years, Miss Evans.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh,” Mari says, instead of the questions running through her mind like: What are you talking about? – or – Why did you call me Miss Evans?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can you tell me the last thing you remember?” the doctor asks in a gentler tone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari thinks on the last thing she remembers and immediately discards that level of honesty in favor of running through what she knows about comas from daytime television.  She decides to play the usual amnesia card and resists the urge to sigh in relief when this move proves a success.  Wherever she is and whoever they might think her to be, she would rather get a better idea of her situation before revealing too much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The doctor asks her not to worry too much about her memories and reassures her that they could return in time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s a medical miracle that you’re awake right now,” the doctor confides with a note of pride that suggests he had a hand in it.  “I’ve already devised a comprehensive plan for your recovery.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My recovery?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, yes, Miss Evans,” the doctor says with a note of amusement, “I’m afraid that a decade in bed does little for muscle development.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari decides to wait until the doctor leaves to take a peek beneath her bedcovers.  She fears that her reaction might be more extreme than she’d like with an audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But let’s not worry about that just yet,” the doctor almost reprimands, as if he didn’t bring it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari tries not to let her growing resentment show.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We’ve called your sister and she should be arriving soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Okay,” Mari says with relief she can’t hide, hoping that one of her sisters will be able to fill her in on what’s going on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This woman is not one of her sisters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A thin brunette woman in a floral dress with a pinched face and glistening pale eyes stands in the doorway to her hospital room, wringing her hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do—Do you remember me?” the woman asks in a shaky voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari stares at this woman so clearly on the brink of tears, who expected to find her recently awakened sister in this bed, and tries to think of anything she could possibly say to not make this any worse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Petunia?” Mari blurts instead because, 1) she always had trouble leaving questions she didn’t know the answers to blank, 2) she is a Potter nerd through and through and the resemblance is uncanny, and 3) her restraint, despite what she likes to believe, is not ironclad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman bursts into tears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Shit.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One moment the woman’s thin frame is heaving with sobs across the room, and in the next, Mari stiffens as she finds her face pressed into a bony, floral patterned shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, Mari,” the woman whispers into Mari’s hair.  Her next words slip out low enough that Mari doubts they were meant for her.  “I knew <em>you’d</em> never forget me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari’s gaze flits around the room before landing on the bouquet of white lilies<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> on the table beside her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Double shit.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s 1985, and Mari is Marigold Evans, the younger muggle sister of Petunia Dursley and the late Lily Potter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At least she isn’t dead anymore, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mari peeks beneath her bedcovers at her toothpick thin legs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She bursts into tears.</p>
<p> </p>
