  <strong>Love at First Sight</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Molly sat down beside Arthur on the couch.  They smiled at each other in the way people who have spent their lives side by side do, communicating entire paragraphs in the blink of an eye, a half hidden smile.   </p><p>“I was only eleven when I first saw Arthur,” she said.  “We were in the same year at Hogwarts but I didn’t see him during the Sorting.  I was sitting at the Gryffindor table the next morning beside my friend Emily.” Molly turned to Arthur beside her and looped her arm through his. “And this man” she leaned her head on Arthur’s shoulder, “walked into the Great Hall, headed for our table.  I turned to Emily and said ‘You see that boy? I’m going to marry him.’”  </p><p>Arthur smiled down at Molly’s head, fondly.  </p><p>“Two weeks after graduation we were married.”  Molly continued. “I lost my two brothers in the first war.” Her eyes began to fill with tears.  “We lost our son in the second war.”  </p><p>Arthur’s eyes became glassy with his own unshed tears.  </p><p>“But I never lost Arthur.” Molly said, her voice thick.  “Over fifty years we’ve been married, bless him.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>Draco</strong>
</p><p>If Draco had to watch Potter manhandle his girlfriend for a moment longer he was going to sick up.  The stupid Auror had the Weaselette pushed up against the train platform wall, snogging as though oxygen was a luxury and not the very basis of life.  It was disgusting. Uncouth. Draco wouldn’t be caught dead in such an unseemly position, in public no less.  </p><p>Merlin, if they stayed here any longer, clothes would start coming off and imagine the papers, then.  “Auror Potter Attempts Procreation at Kings Cross.” Draco bit back a smile. As much as it would serve the tosser right, Draco couldn’t afford to miss the train.</p><p>He coughed politely. They ignored him, naturally.  Draco’s eyes darted around the platform. The Ministry’s platform was just crowded enough that most people ignored him.  Only a few scathing looks were pointed his direction, upon recognition. Fifteen minutes until departure.  </p><p>“I’ll miss you, Harry.” Ginny Weasley said, her breathy voice set Draco on edge.  </p><p>“I'll miss you too.”</p><p>Merlin, it was only a one day transport.  It’s not as though their trip would take Potter from his girlfriend for months.  Draco tapped his foot loudly.</p><p>“I love you.” she said.</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>Draco felt nauseous.  Something had to be done.</p><p> </p><p>Potter whirled around.  “Did you just hit me with an apple?”</p><p>“I most certainly did not!” Draco said.  </p><p>The Weaselette hid her laughter behind her hands. Potter glared at Draco.  </p><p>“It was a pomegranate.” he said primly.</p><p>Potter was briefly flummoxed by this.  “Who eats pomegranates?”</p><p>“I do, obviously.  Besides, pomegranates themselves are not eaten, only the seeds.  But that’s another matter.”  </p><p>This information did not appear to penetrate Potter’s thick skull.  “We’re late, Potter.” he drawled.  </p><p>Potter glanced at the watch on his wrist.  Potter had never accessorized before and Draco didn’t recognize it.  He must not have worn it at Hogwarts. Though, he may have worn it during the Battle of Hogwarts by the look of it.  Scuffed and tarnished, Draco would never wear such a dreadful thing. Were those scorch marks?</p><p>He summoned the pomegranate back to his pocket with the flick of his wand.</p><p>Potter threw an angry glance over his shoulder at Draco before swiftly pecking the Weaselette on the cheek. </p><p>She smirked at Draco before turning back to Potter.  “And you’re sure you don’t need me for protection? I know a wicked hex or two.”</p><p>Draco was well aware of her bat bogey hex.  Blaise described it with such admiration Draco suspected the man had fallen a little in love with her sixth year.  Before everything turned to shit.</p><p>“That won’t be necessary, I assure you.” Draco said.</p><p>“Nervous, Malfoy?” She taunted.</p><p>He looked down his nose at her, “Of course not.” </p><p>“If he becomes a problem, you’ll be the first to know.” Potter said.  “I’ll await your daring rescue.” his hands were in her hair and he was nuzzling her again.  </p><p>“I’m quite the hero, you know.” she quipped.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>And they were snogging again.</p><p>“I really must insist we depart.” Draco interrupted.</p><p>The Weaselette shot Draco a scathing look.  “I’ve got to go, anyway. My portkey’s in five.” </p><p>“I will miss our time together, Weasley, brief though it was.” </p><p>“Oi.” Potter shot a warning glance at Draco.</p><p>She smirked at him, deliberately made eye contact with Draco and pulled Potter into a passionate kiss until he couldn’t see her behind Potter. Draco looked away and ignored the turning in his stomach.  Then she released Potter and strutted away. Potter watched her tight fitting robes retreat until she was out of sight.  </p><p>“Alright, let’s get on with it.” said Potter, turning to Draco. “Hand me your wrist.”  Potter slid his wand out from his sleeve and tapped Draco’s wrist. He felt a cool tingling settle into his skin where Potter’s wand touched.  Potter unfurled a roll of parchment and read out the terms of Draco’s voluntary surrender. Years spent in litigation before his case finally went to trial before Wizengamot led Draco here, turning himself in. He tried to ignore the small crowd gathering around them.  Potter took longer to notice, but once he did, he put a stop to it. </p><p>“Oi, you lot!  Bugger off!” he yelled at the onlookers.  </p><p>“Very professional Auror Potter,” Draco sneered.</p><p>“I’m serious!” Potter shouted.   They seemed to wilt under his fiery gaze.  “Honestly” he muttered, once they started dispersing.  “Sorry about that, Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco’s cheeks tinged.  Why on earth was the man apologizing to him? “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Still,”  Potter glared at the people in the station again. Then he waved his wand and said something under his breath that Draco couldn’t quite make out.  After that no one around them seemed to hear anything they said. They got a few curious looks but no significant interest. Potter squared his shoulders and finished reading from the parchment</p><p>“And you, Draco Malfoy, shall acquiesce to a tracing charm being placed on your person for the duration of the journey until such time as the DMLE is able to carry out the sentence given at the time of your trial.  This, given in good faith that...” </p><p>Draco tuned him out.  He knew what he was about.  He also knew he had Potter to thank for his leniency in the sentence.  Two years on house arrest, the first of which was to be served without a wand.  Potter had to deliver him from London out to Azkaban where the tracing charms would be placed.  From there Draco was on his own. Wandless for an entire year. Not allowed out of his flat for two.  The idea of being so vulnerable for so long made him ill. He didn’t see why they couldn’t just place the charms on him after he’d been sentenced at Wizengamot.  Draco strongly suspected the trip out to Azkaban was strictly for intimidation purposes. A test, of sorts, to see how far he was willing to prove his good will. He couldn’t prove it though, and he was in no position to make a stir.  </p><p>“Got it?”</p><p>Draco blinked a few times.  “Pardon?”</p><p>“Do you agree to these terms, Malfoy?  Were you listening at all?”</p><p>Draco flicked his hand dismissively. “Yes, of course.  Get on with it, would you?”</p><p>“Right.”  The intensity of Potter’s stare was overwhelming.  Draco felt as if he were an insect pinned to the wall for scrutiny.  “Sign here.”</p><p>Potter handed him a self-inking quill.  Draco signed the parchment in mid-air and then Potter tapped it with his wand.  The parchment went slack again and rolled up into a scroll of its own accord. Potter snatched it out of the air and tapped it with his wand again.  A clump of purple wax appeared while a small ribbon tied the scroll in place. Draco saw the ministry seal form inside the purple wax. Potter tied it to the leg of an owl Draco hadn’t even noticed was there and sent it off.  </p><p>Draco held out his arm, the unmarked one. Potter glanced at him, questioning, and Draco nodded.  Potter gave a firm nod back and held his wand to Draco’s forearm. A rope of blue light slid out from the top of the wand onto his arm. Draco tried not to flinch at the near (but not quite) burning sensation it left.  The light wrapped itself around Draco’s forearm twice and then into the shape of the ministry seal over them. He hissed through his teeth as it sunk into his arm, glowing brighter for a moment before the light dimmed to a barely there glow.  </p><p>“Alright?” Potter asked.</p><p>Draco looked down his nose at him, haughtily.  “I’ve had worse.”</p><p>“Don’t I know it.”  Potter said. “Come on, then.”  he indicated the vibrantly magenta car two down from where they stood.  The Aurors posted at the entrance nodded to Potter, who nodded back.  </p><p>“Parney.  Stolls.”</p><p>Of course he knew them personally.  Potter had probably told them loads of humiliating stories about Draco and they all had a good laugh at his expense.  Naturally. Draco noticed the way their eyes wouldn’t meet his, the slight curl of the lip when he passed. He threw back his shoulders and put on the most contemptuous look he could summon to precede Potter into the private car.  Draco ignored the set of seats with shackles built into them. He strode to the back of the car where there were bench seats and sat by the window. Potter did some checks along the perimeter and spoke briefly with the other Aurors.  </p><p>He sat on the bench seat across from Draco just as the train started moving.  </p><p> </p><p>“Grapes?  What are you eleven?”</p><p>Potter merely shrugged. “Ginny packed them for me.  Besides, who brings pomegranates as a snack? At least you don’t need a knife to eat grapes.”</p><p>“A knife?” Draco shook his head.  Muggleborns. He slid his wand out from his pocket.  He tapped the pomegranate and it split in half. He conjured a bowl and flicked his wand.  The pomegranate seeds flew in a perfect arch into the bowl. A knife indeed.  </p><p>They sat in silence, that Draco was more than willing to cultivate.  Potter, it seemed, couldn’t manage it.  </p><p>“So tell me about yourself, Malfoy.”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>“You know” he gestured with his hand, “What have you been up to?”</p><p>“Is that meant to be a sarcastic remark?” Draco narrowed his eyes. </p><p>Potter had the good grace to realize he’d stepped in it.</p><p>“I just meant-”</p><p>“I haven’t been up to anything.”  Draco interrupted, his temper rising.</p><p>Potter scratched the back of his neck.  “Shit. I didn’t think-”</p><p>“No, you didn’t.” Draco spat.  “I haven’t been up to anything.  I haven’t been rebuilding my father’s nefarious network of followers.  I haven’t been harassing muggles in the streets. I haven’t been up to a bloody thing.”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“I’m trying to move on, you know.  Why do you think I’m doing this?” he raised his right arm to Potter where the blue ministry seal was glowing mildly under his skin.  “I’m turning myself in for sentencing. I could have fucked off to France with my mother, you know. But I’m trying to do the right thing here.  I’m trying to start over. And you come in with your accusations!”</p><p>“I wasn’t accusing you of anything! Jesus!” Potter shouted back at him.  “I was only making small talk.”  </p><p>“Small talk.” </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“<em> Small talk </em>?” Draco said, incredulous.  “In what world could you and I ever make small talk?”</p><p>Potter shook his head slowly and looked out the window.</p><p>“We’re not friends, Potter.  We’re not even acquaintances.”</p><p>“I suppose you’re right.  We could never be friends.”  </p><p>Draco paused.   He thought Potter sounded a bit remorseful, but that couldn’t be right. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em> I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Here they were: another train, another offer of friendship.  And Draco had rejected it without a moment’s thought. Hadn’t Draco just said he was trying to move on?</p><p>“I-” Draco bit his lip.  “I suppose I’m a bit on edge, Potter.  We could be friends, couldn’t we?”</p><p>Draco hated the way it sounded coming out of his mouth, the waver in his voice.  Self loathing curled about his stomach, settling in like a heavy meal.</p><p>“Not a chance.” Harry spat a grape seed into the bin by the door.  “You were right the first time.”</p><p>Draco had anticipated the answer was the same now as it was at age eleven. It still hurt to hear out loud.  He turned to the window.  </p><p>“I’m an Auror and you’re turning yourself in for war crimes.” Potter went on, completely unnecessarily.  A simple “no” would suffice. No need to add insult to injury with further details. Draco hated Harry Potter, though not as much as he hated himself for still wanting the man’s friendship.  The stupid oaf spat another grape seed into the bin. </p><p>“Revolting.” Draco sneered.  </p><p>“What?  How is that any worse than your pomegranate seeds?  Both seeds, aren’t they.”</p><p>“The difference is how uncouth it is to spit food into a bin.  I think you’re right, we could never be friends. I do have standards, after all.”</p><p>Potter snorted, further proving Draco’s point.  </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>Harry</strong>
</p><p>They watched suburbs of London fly past the windows.  If Malfoy was so determined to be a prat Harry would leave him to it.  They could sit in silence for the remainder of the journey for all Harry cared.  Draco Sodding Malfoy and his complete misunderstanding of one of the greatest films in existence.   </p><p>“You’re wrong.”  Malfoy couldn’t let it go.</p><p>“Sod off, I am not.”  Harry snapped. “He wants-”</p><p>“I can’t believe how wrong you are.  You’re muggleborn. Doesn’t that grant you some better understanding of how they work?”</p><p>“He <em> wants </em> her to leave!  Jesus. That’s why he puts her on the plane.  He’s trying to keep her safe!”</p><p>Malfoy shook his head.  “She doesn’t want to stay, Potter.”</p><p>Harry had always known Malfoy was an idiot.  He was only proving Harry right. “She absolutely wants to stay.  I mean look at them. Wouldn’t you rather stay with Humphrey Bogart than whoever that other tosser was?”</p><p>Malfoy arched his eyebrow at Harry.  “Potter I never knew you so light in the loafers.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.  </p><p>“I would certainly never spend the remainder of my life in a war torn country with a man who runs a bar.  How foolish do you have to be to entertain such a notion?”</p><p><b>“</b>You'd rather be in a passionless, political marriage than live with the man you've had the best shag of your life with?”  Harry wouldn’t put it past Malfoy, he was a Slytherin after all. “Just because of his job? Because he runs a bar? What? That’s not posh enough for you?”</p><p><b>“</b>Obviously.” Malfoy was incredulous.  “Do you think pureblood marriages happen because of physical intimacy?”</p><p>Harry’s hackles went up, “So it’s bigotry, is that it?  What happened to moving on?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean- that’s beside-”  Malfoy took a breath and said more calmly, “What I mean to say is that this is what I’ve been groomed my whole life to do. Most traditional marriages in the wizarding world are built on strategic matches, not love matches.  Puting obligation above passion. Any rational person would do the same.” Malfoy went on. “People are very practical, even Muggles like Ingrid Bergman.”</p><p>Harry shook his head in disbelief.  Malfoy was more messed up than he thought.  </p><p>“Which is why she gets on the plane at the end of the film.” the blonde concluded.  </p><p>Harry would never give up the passion he had with Ginny for some political alliance.  Her fire and wit, he couldn’t live without it. Just the thought of her sent his heart racing, the soft curve of her arse, the taste of her skin. The way she- Harry blinked.  That was it.  </p><p>“You’ve just never been shagged properly.” Harry practically shouted, pointing a finger.  </p><p>Malfoy’s eyes widened, nearly apoplectic.  His cheeks tinged pink.  </p><p>“Potter!” he hissed.</p><p>Harry shrugged.  “What? We’re what?  Twenty? Loads of people don’t get laid until their twenties.”</p><p>“I’ve had relations, Potter.” Malfoy looked around to ensure they were still alone.  “If you must know.”</p><p>Harry quirked his eyebrow, “Relations?  Afraid of the word sex, are you?”</p><p>“I cannot believe we are having his conversation.” Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose.  </p><p>“Let’s get something to eat.”</p><p>Malfoy eyed the bin where Harry had been spitting his grape seeds.</p><p>“Something substantial.” Harry said.</p><p>“Fine.  Anything to end this conversation.”</p><p>Malfoy followed Harry through the carriage doors to the dining car.  </p><p> </p><p>Harry indicated an empty table for Malfoy to sit at. The car was about three quarters full.  Harry grabbed them sandwiches and a couple of butterbeers and sat down across from Malfoy.  </p><p>“Where were we?” He asked as he slid into the seat.  He began unwrapping his sandwich. “Right, you were just telling me you were a virgin.”</p><p>Malfoy shot him a glare and unwrapped his own sandwich.  </p><p>“I will have you know I have been laid plenty.”</p><p>Harry pointed a finger at him as well as he could with his hands full of sandwich.  “But not well.”</p><p>“I have been laid often and well Auror Potter!” Malfoy said loudly.  The noise in the dining card stopped entirely, all heads swivelled in their direction.  </p><p>Harry himself choked on his food.  He coughed a few times and took a sip of butterbeer.  “What’d you do that for?” he said </p><p>“To remind you of the impropriety of asking a detainee to disclose his sexual history.”</p><p>“Oh come off it, Malfoy.  It’s only me. We’ve known each other since we were eleven.”</p><p>“You have no sense of decency, do you?”</p><p>“Don’t see the point.” Harry shrugged. </p><p>“Indeed.”  </p><p>They finished their meal in silence. </p><p> </p><p>Once they arrived at the DMLE station Harry led Malfoy to the Portkey centre.  Harry nodded at the Portkey Officer and took the offered empty crisp packet.</p><p>“Next one’s in a quarter hour” he told Malfoy.  “Hold out your arm?”</p><p>Malfoy looked as though he would vomit for half a moment before he blinked himself into composure.  “The one with the Ministry tracer?” he asked faintly.</p><p>Harry nodded and Malfoy seemed to relax a little.  He held out his right arm. Harry tapped it with his wand and the Ministry Seal glowed more brightly.  It turned from a blue violet colour to a dark glowing plum. Instead of the light diminishing as it had when Harry put the tracer on it remained vivid, glowing beneath Malfoy’s pale skin.  </p><p>“Well.”  Malfoy said when Harry lowered his wand.  Harry watched him tug the sleeve of his robes down.  “This is the part where you leave.” Malfoy said pointedly.</p><p>“Technically I can’t leave until you’ve taken the Portkey.”</p><p>“Have it your way, then.” </p><p> There was a small waiting room looking over the ocean where they sat on a bench.  Harry watched Malfoy’s reflection in the window. He’d changed since Hogwarts, since his trial even.  The pale blonde hair looked healthier than Harry had seen it in years. His fine features made a cutting profile. Somehow Malfoy had grown up when Harry hadn’t been paying attention.  He found himself oddly captivated.  </p><p>“You’re not bad looking, you know.”  Harry blurted.  </p><p>Malfoy turned and stared at him.</p><p>“You’re quite fit.” Harry said.</p><p>“Are you having a stroke?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Because I cannot fathom a reason why you would try to chat me up as you are both an officer of the law and romantically involved.  With a woman!”</p><p>Harry felt his cheeks get warm. He ran a hand through his hair, “That’s not what I was doing.”</p><p>“Wasn’t it?” Malfoy said, his voice haughty and disdainful.</p><p>“No!” </p><p>“Please enlighten me.”</p><p>“I just-” Harry sighed.  “I never noticed it before.”  Harry lied. Dreams didn’t count, really.  “You looked a bit.. sad. I was trying to be encouraging.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes narrowed.  “So you pity me.”</p><p>“I don’t!”</p><p>“You pity me and you feel the way to save poor wretched Draco Malfoy is to come onto me.  Despite the fact that you’re in a heterosexual monogomous relationship.”</p><p>“Forget it.”  he said. If Malfoy was determined to misunderstand Harry’s every word there was no point in trying to explain himself.  </p><p>Malfoy tutted beside him and folded his arms across his chest.  Harry continued to watch him in the window reflection, unable to look away.  The light was dimming and the horizon was slashed with deep oranges and reds.  On top of which Malfoy’s reflection hung, spectral and beautiful. Harry sighed again.</p><p> The crisp packet began to warm in Harry’s hand signalling the two minute warning.  He looked to Malfoy and they stood facing each other.</p><p>“Ready?”  </p><p>Malfoy’s lips thinned and he nodded.  </p><p>“When you get to Azkaban, they’ll activate the dampener to replace the tracer I put on you.  They won’t give you any trouble.”  </p><p>Malfoy looked doubtful.</p><p>“It will only be a year without magic.” He tried to sound bracing.  Harry clapped him on the shoulder. “You’ll be fine.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes went to where Harry’s hand touched his shoulder and narrowed his eyes.  Harry sighed and let his hand drop.  </p><p>They held each other’s gaze steadily.  Harry’s heart sped up for no reason he could discern. </p><p>“See you around Malfoy.”  </p><p>He could have sworn Malfoy’s eyes dropped to his lips for half a second before he disappeared.  Then he was gone and Harry felt as though he missed the last step on a staircase.  </p>
