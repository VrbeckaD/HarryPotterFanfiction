          <div class="userstuff"><p>Out past the great big looming castle<br/>
And the whipping, whomping willow tree<br/>
There is a body in the forest<br/>
Deep in the roots and the loam and the dead leaves<br/>
With his weary bones<br/>
And his pale skin<br/>
He lies scarred and fragile and only mostly dead<br/>
This boy has died from living<br/>
(The worst way to go)<br/>
And in the night<br/>
When creatures rise<br/>
And fog swallows the woods whole<br/>
The stars reach down to kiss him<br/>
Bright light touches paper thin skin<br/>
(Love so bright it drowns out the fog)<br/>
He glows in the shine of the night sky<br/>
A full moon killing him softly<br/>
And when she sinks back down<br/>
(Traded for the sun)<br/>
He will rise<br/>
Dead boy<br/>
So tired<br/>
Barely more than a ghost<br/>
In echoey halls and rooms with high ceilings<br/>
He haunts a castle<br/>
And he finds himself almost living<br/>
Held in the hands of the night sky<br/>
Every month he dies once more<br/>
A spirit<br/>
A ghost<br/>
A ghoul that goes thump in the night<br/>
People say they are scared of something like him<br/>
(Ignorance kills)<br/>
But he is the one who finds himself most frightening<br/>
Like sudden fog in windy darkness<br/>
Or voices in the night<br/>
The things that steal away children<br/>
Or suck the breath out of dreams<br/>
But in the dark eyes and nimble fingers of a starry sky<br/>
There is no fear<br/>
No terror<br/>
Only love and devotion and the brightest star in the whole night sky<br/>
Speaking gentle words to the forests most beautiful beast<br/>
But the boy who cries wolf must be cautious<br/>
For on stormy nights<br/>
(Pounding rain, angry thunder, the ignorant safe and shaking in their beds)<br/>
The stars can not hold him<br/>
Can not kiss him or keep him or love him<br/>
Stars bring the clouds upon themselves<br/>
Mistaking dead boys for sick jokes<br/>
(A thunderclap rips through the sky)<br/>
Rain and lighting and the fear of another<br/>
Can make the dead, who fear themselves, turn to beasts<br/>
The watchful eyes of a man who plays monster<br/>
Cannot trust the night sky<br/>
No, he could never trust the moon<br/>
(She killed him)<br/>
And, no, he cannot trust the stars<br/>
(No matter how warm they seem to shine)<br/>
Love<br/>
The boy often forgets<br/>
Is the most terrifying thing of all<br/>
Worse than silent nights filled with voices unknown<br/>
Hands that grab ankles that stick out from bed sheets<br/>
Or nightmares that steal your breath away and hide it<br/>
For love patches scars and moves the clouds from the stars<br/>
It makes the night sky shine bright and a dead boys face look alive again<br/>
Through haunting halls and nights in the forest<br/>
Love will creep through<br/>
(Clear the storm from the sky)<br/>
And the boy who cried beast and the glowing stars in the night<br/>
Will haunt this place even after they've gone<br/>
Hatred and love can run chills through a strangers body<br/>
Even once the dead have stopped living<br/>
(Stars shine so long after they die, beasts will never forget the night sky)</p></div>
