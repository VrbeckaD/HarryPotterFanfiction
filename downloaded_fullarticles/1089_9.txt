  <strong>Chapter 1 The beginning</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Harry's Backstory</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry's past was not the best to say the least. His parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort when he was only a year old and, in that time, he instantly became an orphan. He was taken to live with the only relatives that he had left so he remained feeling like an orphan. Aunt Petunia found him in the morning when she was leaving out milk cartons and shrieked. </p><p> </p><p>She muttered to herself. “What in the world is a baby doing on our front step.” She then looked down and noticed the letter that was laying gently on top of the baby, again she muttered to herself. <em>*Oh no why would they bring him here? </em><em>Vernon is not going to be happy when he finds out who this baby is.</em> <em>*</em></p><p> </p><p>Vernon came running, well as much as he could run for a man of his size which was pretty much the size of a whale. “Petunia dear what is the matter?” </p><p>Petunia just looked at him with a frightened expression and just pointed at the basket with the baby inside.</p><p>Vernon looks at the baby then back at his wife. “Who in the world is that baby and how in the hell did it get here?” Petunia just looked at her husband and he immediately knew the answer to his own question. </p><p><em>*Oh, great we have a baby freak on our doorstep. What in the world do they expect me to do with it? * </em>“Well what do we do with him?” Vernon just looks at his wife with a questioning gaze. “I don't want anything to do with their kind.”</p><p>Petunia looks at her husband. “I know that but Vernon, we have to at least take him in. I know that I have hated my sister for what she was but, in the end, she is still my sister.”</p><p> </p><p><em>*I will never think of this little freak as my son and I will personally make sure he knows that as he grows up. He is freak and will be treated like one. * </em>Vernon sighed but nodded to this none the less. “Okay fine but I refuse to treat him as my own son because I know what he will turn out to be.”</p><p>Petunia knew that this was true especially if he was anything like his father and she knew deep down that he would be and that one day he would be extremely powerful and influential in their world.  “I would never ask that of you, but we do need to keep him alive, we don't need any of those freaks showing up at our door.” They both silently nodded in agreement with each other and took the baby in.</p><p> </p><p>This is how Harry James Potter's life began and so did the hell that came with it. He was forced to learn how to cook at the age of three and then he was given the tasks of taking care of all the chores around the house. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Harry was their slave and had to do whatever they told him to do unless he wanted to be punished severely and his punish could be a variety of different things. Mostly it was starvation and emotionally abuse but occasionally it was physical as well depending on how mad Vernon became. Harry never even knew his real name until he went to primary school, his aunt, uncle, and cousin always called him freak. He never knew how his parents really died that they were wizards, meaning he was one too until a big half giant came to him with a letter on the day of his thirteenth birthday. This was the first time he ever heard about the wizarding world and at first, he denied that anything the half giant named Hagrid said.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shakes his head and fights an internal battle with himself. <em>*There is no way that any of this is actually true. That would mean that I really did come from a loving family and I’m special and not a freak. Wait what am I thinking, there is no way I would be that lucky. * </em> “There is no way that I could possibly be a wizard there is no such thing, they are only in fairy tales.”</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid as the half giant was called just shook his head at him. “Of course, there is young Harry, you're a wizard and so were your parents, where do you think that you learned it all?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stammered at this comment and struggles to find the words. “Th- that can't be true my parents died in a car crash and what do you mean where do I think I learned it all from?”</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid looks at him very livid at the fact that the Dursley's have lied to this boy since he was old enough to talk. “I don't ever want you to think that your parents died that way because it's not true, they died as hero's who tried everything, they could to protect you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry saw the expression on Hagrid's face and listened to his words and made the informed conclusion that his parents really hadn't died in a car crash.  He could also sense some extreme anger coming from him. “But I realize now that my parents didn't die in a car crash.” </p><p> </p><p>Petunia finally took some pity on Harry and decided to tell him the truth. “Of course not. Your parents didn't die in a crash, but we had to tell you something, they were murdered by a mad man.”</p><p>Harry was again shocked and hurt by this comment. “Why would you guys lie to me all this time when you knew what really happened?”</p><p>Vernon just sneered at his unwanted nephew. “Do you actually think that we wanted you? We told you a story, so you would stop asking what happened to them.”</p><p>Vernon then turns his attention to the half giant that was currently sitting on the couch in front of the fireplace. “He will not be going to that crazy school.”</p><p>Hagrid just smirks and looks at Vernon. “Oh, and I suppose a muggle like yourself is going to stop him.”</p><p>Harry looks at Hagrid confused. “What in the world is a muggle?”</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid smiles a little. “It just means someone who doesn't have any magic in them or someone who doesn't have enough magic in them to be considered magical.”</p><p>Petunia puts a hand on her husband's shoulder. “Vernon let him go, just think we won't have to deal with him again until the summertime.”</p><p>Vernon grins evilly. “Fine you can take the freak with you. I would prefer that he never come back at all, but I guess we can deal with him for just the summer months.”</p><p> </p><p>Looking back on that moment, Harry knew he made this best decision in following Hagrid and he thanked fate or whatever deity that was looking down on him for finally giving him break and allowing him a chance to have a better life. His life has changed for the better. He has two amazing best friends that he considers his honorary brother and sister, along with a small core group of friends that he also likes to think of as his extended family. Harry was finally able to find somewhere that he felt like he belonged with people who would accept him for who he is, basically a place a he could call home.</p><p> </p><p>However, because he is Harry Potter and fate seems to always want to play tricks on him, his life hasn't been easy even while he has been at Hogwarts. Not everything that had happened to him while at school had been a bad thing either, he has had both good surprises and really bad surprises that almost led to his death and the death of his friends.</p><p> </p><p>During his first year he met a prick that insulted his first friend that ever made, so in turn he made his first enemy as well or least he thought he did. Then he becomes the youngest seeker in a century to make a house quidditch team. After that he had to face a fully-grown mountain troll with Ron in order to save Hermione, who was hiding in a bathroom after Ron the idiot had made fun of her in charms class. Then during his first quidditch match ever, someone tried to kill him, but Hermione because of her quick thinking successfully stuffed that attack, thank Merlin for that.</p><p> </p><p>The grand finale of his first year was getting past a three headed dog who ironically was named Fluffy, then getting through a Devils Snare and out flying a key with a broken wing and also trying not to get attacked by the other flying keys. After that they had to get past a life-sized wizard's chess set and having Ron get knocked out in the process with Hermione staying behind with him. The final kicker was finding out that Professor Quirrell was working for Voldemort and them trying to kill him again.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's second year wasn't much better. His horrendous year started during the summer when a crazy house elf  named Dobby came to his “house” and tried to get Harry not to return to Hogwarts by stealing all of his letters from his friends which of course he refused and chased that crazy elf downstairs. When Harry still refused this caused the house elf to drop a cake on the head of one of Vernon's clients. Dobby the crazy elf then left making everyone in the room think that Harry had done this. He was furious and of course Harry was blamed for this and received heavy punishment which resulted in iron bars being put on the outside of Harry’s bedroom window.</p><p> </p><p>One night he was rescued by Ron, Fred, and George and they took him to the Burrow in their father’s flying car. The same crazy elf tried to prevent Ron and Harry from getting to Hogwarts by blocking the path to the Hogwarts Express at King’s Cross. He learned he could talk to snakes which was seen as a sign of being evil; kids were being attacked and petrified and the entire student body thought Harry was one the one doing it until Hermione became one of the victims. Ginny almost died after being taken down into the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry had killed the Basilisk living in the chamber and almost died himself, however he was saved by Dumbledore’s pet Phoenix called Fawkes.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's third year was relatively quiet compared to the past two years but that didn’t mean he was able to relax and enjoy it. There was another so-called mad man after him. By the end of the year he found out the Sirius Black was the supposed mad man trying to kill him and he was also his godfather. He also found out that Sirius hadn't betrayed his parents but that another one of their friends had, Peter Pettigrew, the dirty rat. On a good note he was able to be caught and given over to the proper authorities and Sirius was deemed a free man.</p><p> </p><p>His fourth year can be summed up in four words: The Tri-Wizard Tournament. No other words need to be used because within these four words all hell had broken loose, and Harry's world was turned even more upside down than it already was.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <strong> <em>The Present</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Cedric managed to make it back to the school after being sucked into a portkey that led them to an old graveyard. Dumbledore came flying over to them. “Harry, Cedric what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was still in utter shock at the events that just took place and was holding his arm close to his chest while Cedric's arm was wrapped protectively around Harry. “I'm sorry headmaster but I would like to get Harry to Madam Pomphrey before he is bombarded with questions.” With that Cedric looked towards his father and Sirius and they both followed him to the medical tent.</p><p> </p><p>Amos Diggory and Sirius Black entered the tent a few moments after the boys did and they both had to restrain themselves from asking too many questions to soon. Surprisingly Severus Snape also walked into the tent to examine Harry.</p><p> </p><p><em>*Is he trying to give everyone a heart attack with his stupid hero complex? I would prefer not to lose my mate due to this one’s early death. Although I suppose he is much braver than most adults are and that is something that no one wants to change. * </em>“Mr. Potter what have you gotten yourself into now?” Snape asked Harry as he began to examine him.</p><p>Harry chuckled slightly at Professor Snape's antics. “Oh, you know the usual trouble, the only thing I know how to do according to you and everyone else.” Then Harry got serious and whispers quietly but loud enough for Sirius and Amos to hear. “He came back and I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus stopped his movements and just stared at Harry and Cedric for a moment before continuing his examination. “I know I could feel it and it’s not your fault, so don’t you dare blame yourself.”</p><p>Sirius and Amos came running over when they heard this.</p><p> </p><p>Amos went over to his son and started to inspect him. “Are you alright son, did you get hurt?”</p><p>Cedric just smiles and tries to shrug off his father's hands. “I'm fine father. Harry saved me.”</p><p> </p><p>Amos turns his attention to Harry. “Thank you for saving my son Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Harry shook his head as he was also trying to keep Sirius at bay. “You don't have to thank me Mr. Diggory, your son means a lot to me and please call me Harry.”</p><p>Amos raises a questioning brow to his son, expecting a clarification to this statement made by Mr. Potter. </p><p>Before anyone could answer Dumbledore walked into the tent. “What is the verdict Severus?”</p><p> </p><p>Severus turns to look at the headmaster and just leaves the tent not before whispering something to Harry. “You need to tell him everything, no hiding anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods and then looks up at Dumbledore. “I'm fine headmaster, they just cut me which they used my blood to bring him back. Professor Snape was able to heal my cut for me though.”</p><p>Sirius shakes his head. “Before we get too sidetracked can we get back to what the hell are we supposed to do about the mad man that was brought back to life?”</p><p> </p><p><em>*I fear that this is much more complex than anyone thinks it is. We need to figure this out quickly before we have another full-blown war on our hands. * </em>Dumbledore smiles sadly. “I do not have a plan yet, but we all need to be guarded and ready for anything.” He turns his attention to Harry. “You will have to go back to your relatives to keep you safe.”</p><p>Harry turned white as a ghost at this comment and Cedric just held onto him tighter. “With all due respect sir but there is no way in hell that I will let Harry go back there.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius raises an eyebrow and smirks. “And why won't you let my godson go back there Mr. Diggory?”</p><p>Cedric just looks at Sirius Black intently and doesn't let his voice waver. “He is my boyfriend sir, I'm sorry that I did not ask for your permission first.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius just smiles fondly at him. “It is alright I already knew, I just wanted to hear it from you.” Sirius then turns his attention back to the headmaster. “I conquer with Cedric's statement. You know full well what kind of treatment he receives at the horrible house and I will not allow him to go back there especially since I am now considered a free man.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore just shakes his head. “I'm afraid there isn't much you can do about it because you are not listed as his guardian.”</p><p> </p><p>At this point Amelia Bones walks into the medical tent. “I'm afraid that is where you are wrong Albus. Harry is now under the guardianship of Lord Black here.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry's eye lit up for the first time since before the third task started. “I am?”</p><p> </p><p>Madame Bones smiles at him. “Yes, you are Lord Potter and I am making strict instructions that you are never to go back to that house again.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry wiggled his way out of Cedric's grip and ran over to his godfather hugging him tightly. “Thank you, thank you, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius just hugs his godson back and smiles. “We can finally have the family we wanted, you, me, Remus and Severus.” Sirius then turns his attention Cedric simply ignoring the fact the Dumbledore is still there. “Cedric you are more than welcome to stay with us at any point during the summer break.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric's eyes lit up and looked over to his father with a hopeful expression. “Dad can I stay with Harry this summer?” Cedric was completely expecting his father to flat out deny his request, but he had to ask anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Amos Diggory stands there and thinks about it for a moment then smiles and nods. “Yes, you may stay with Harry and Lord Black this summer, but you must be on your best behavior young man.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric smiles so big and hugs his father for the first time in what felt like forever. “Thank you so much dad, I promise I will be on my best behavior.”</p><p> </p><p>About a month later after they have all gotten settled in for the summer holidays Harry is in the study reading some books when Cedric walks in.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey baby.” Cedric kisses Harry on the cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks up at him “Hey. So, what did Dumbledore want?” Cedric sits down in a chair next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Well he wants me to come back to Hogwarts this year to apprentice under Professor Flitwick since I want to become a master of Charms.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry is extremely happy. “That is great news love!” Harry kisses Cedric and is about to continue but he stops himself when he gets a sudden urge to puke. Harry runs to the bathroom, then he throws up in the toilet and groans. He thinks to himself *What in the world is wrong with me, I can't keep any food down and I'm more tired than usual. *</p><p> </p><p>Cedric gets up with a concerned expression on his face and follows him to the bathroom. “Harry, baby what's wrong?” Cedric rubs his back.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shakes his head and shudders a little from the nasty taste in his mouth. “I don't know I have just been getting sick lately I think I just have a stomach bug.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric is not impressed by this answer. “How long exactly have you been getting sick for?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think about a couple of weeks or so.” Harry cringes at the expression he was receiving from his boyfriend. “Maybe Sirius can get poppy here and she can check me out.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric nods in agreement. “That sounds like a good plan to me. I will go talk to him and you should go lay down on the bed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright Ced I will go do that.” He kisses him and goes to lay down on the bed. Cedric goes downstairs to find Sirius. “Sirius, are you down here I need to talk to you about something?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah I'm in the kitchen.” Sirius says.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric follows his voice and walks into the kitchen. “Do you think you could get Poppy here Harry says he has been sick for several weeks?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius raises an eyebrow at him. “What do you mean he has been sick for several weeks?”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric shakes his head. “Please don't shoot the messenger. I don't know any more details than that to be honest this is the first time I am hearing of this. As you know I just got back from meeting with Dumbledore and I want up to tell Harry about our meeting and we kissed then he stopped and bolted out of the room towards the bathroom and puked.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius nodded. “He tends to not tell people when something is wrong with him unfortunately. But yes, I can get her here. Anything for my godson.” Sirius fire calls Poppy. </p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Black how can I be of service?”</p><p> </p><p>“It's Harry he is not feeling well and whatever it is, it's not getting any better.”</p><p> </p><p>She internally sighs and thinks. *What in the world is wrong with that boy now? We aren't even at school yet and he already needs my attention, that boy is going to be the death of me. * “Okay I will make my way through, then I will check up on the troublesome Potter.” Poppy makes it through the floo and heads to where Harry is.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what seems to be the problem Mr. Potter?” Poppy asks.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks up at the Matron. “I have been feeling lightheaded and have been getting sick for about three weeks now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay then Mr. Potter let's look at you. Mr. Diggory and Mr. Black please leave the room, so I can check Harry.” Poppy runs some tests and find's something that surprises her. “Mr. Potter are you sexually active with Mr. Diggory?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushes completely taken off guard by the question. “Um yes I am. Why?”</p><p> </p><p>She just shakes her head. “Well it would appear that you are pregnant.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry just sat there until he was finally able to put a sentence together. “Pre-pregnant? Are you sure? I didn't think that was possible for male wizards.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes Mr. Potter I am absolutely sure you are four weeks along to be exact, and yes, it is completely possible.” She says will complete confidence.</p><p> </p><p>Harry thinks back to four weeks ago.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Flashback:</strong> </em>

  <strong>Start of lemon (you have been warned, if you don't like it skip to the next words in bold.)</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It's a couple of days after the dreadful events of the Tri Wizard Tournament and Harry and Cedric are making out in Harry's room at Grimmauld Place and Cedric has just put up a locking and silencing charm on the room, so no one can walk in on them.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric is rubbing his hands everything that he gets to without crossing the invisible boundary that he and Harry have. "Baby if we don't stop soon, I won't be able to control myself anymore."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry mumbles into Cedric's shoulder. "Maybe that isn't such a bad thing."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric shudders and thinks. *Did he just say what I think he just said. * "Harry can you please repeat that before I lose my mind completely."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry chuckles at his boyfriend's shock. "I said it wouldn't be a bad thing if you were to lose all control."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric looks at his green eyes shocked and at a loss for words. "Harry do you know what you are saying. I need you to make sure that this is you what you are implying."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry kisses him quickly before pulling back just as fast. "Yes, I want my first time to be with you and I want it to happen right now, otherwise I'm going to be really upset with you because I know you want it to." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric loses all control as soon as the words leave his boyfriends mouth. Then he starts kissing Harry back before moving down to his neck while his fingers start to work on Harry's shirt buttons. The more buttons Cedric takes apart them more of Harry's skin he kisses down. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry is moaning and runs his fingers through Cedric's hair. "Keep going please." Cedric continues to kiss him all over then he puts his fingers inside Harry's underwear and grabs his thighs.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric looks at Harry with a questioning look and Harry nods, so Cedric pulls Harry's underwear off. After he does this Cedric can't help but stare at his boyfriend's toned body. "My God you're gorgeous love."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry blushes. "Oh, stop it. Now it is your turn to take your clothes off Ced". Cedric laughs a little but then does as Harry says and takes his clothes off.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric prepares Harry by inserting one finger and moving it around slowly.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry arches his back and pushes against his boyfriend's finger. "Ced, mhmmm, please keep going, it feels interesting but in a good way."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric smirks then nods. "Good, I’m glad you are enjoying this and don't worry love I'm not going to stop." He continues his ministrations by adding another finger. Then he starts to scissor his fingers inside Harry trying to stretch him as much as possible.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Oohhh Ced that feels so good please don't stop." Harry can only shake his head back and forth and wiggles on the bed as the pleasure runs through him.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric smirks and continues for a few minutes then he removes his fingers.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry whines at the loss and looks up at Cedric pleading with him to continue without actually saying any words.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Don't worry love it will only get better you just have to wait a minute, I promise you." Cedric leans back and mutters a charm to prevent pregnancy just in case Harry is a carrier then he lines himself up with Harry's entrance before looking at Harry for permission. Harry just nods at him unable to speak any actual words.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry is growing impatient after he nods to Cedric with a silent okay and he doesn't have to wait long because Cedric slowly starts to push his length inside of him and Harry winces at the slight discomfort. To try and avoid as much pain as possible Cedric pushes himself inside in one long motion until he is at the hilt.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Pain shoots up his spine after this action and Harry thinks to himself. "Oh, fuck that kind of hurts." So, he tries to control his breathing to get over the pain that is currently running through him.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Am I hurting you? I will stop if you need me to." Cedric says with a worried expression written on his face.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry shakes his head with tears in his eyes. "I just need a minute love." Cedric stops moving while staying inside of Harry. After a minute Harry gets used to the feeling of Cedric inside him, then he looks up into his boyfriends' eyes. "You can move Ced."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric nods and pushes in and out of Harry slowly at first, but it is all too much for Harry and he wraps his legs around Cedric's waist. "I need you to go faster please love."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric doesn't need to be told twice, so he picks up the pace. "Shit baby you feel so good." He continues to ram inside of him loving the feeling of being there.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry is having a hard time keeping himself composed. "Ced....Don't stop please...Oh God." He trails off because he can't form any other words.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Damn it, baby, I don't think I'm going to last much longer." Cedric's breathing has increased to harsh pants at this point. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry's breathing is matching his boyfriends. "I won't either."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric grabs Harry's length with one hand and starts to pump him in sync with his thrusts. Harry finishes first and not long after that Cedric releases inside Harry and collapses next to Harry on the bed.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry rests his head on Cedric's shoulder. "I love you Ced."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Cedric kisses the top of his head. "I love you too Harry."</em>

</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't even know that was possible.” Harry stated still in shock.</p><p> </p><p>“Again, I will tell you that it is very possible. For someone as powerful as you, it is not unheard of. There have been a few cases in the past but not a lot.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry is still a bit confused. “But I still don't understand how come if it was possible that no one ever told me?”</p><p> </p><p>Madam Pomphrey shakes her head. “That I cannot answer you, that is something you should ask Mr. Diggory or your godfather, preferably your godfather.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods. *I will have to remember to ask them later. * “I will thank you Poppy.”</p><p> </p><p>Madame Pomphrey gives Harry a small smile. “You are welcome Harry. Meanwhile I will go get Mr. Diggory and you can tell him the news.” Madam Pomphrey leaves to go get Cedric. A few minutes later Cedric comes into the room.</p><p> </p><p>Harry noticed that Cedric look very frazzled and laughs a little. Madam Pomphrey puts a silencing spell up, so they can have their privacy without any peering ears listening.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey baby what's wrong?” Cedric asked Harry then sits down next to him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks up at his boyfriend as he walks into the room and immediately dreads the conversation that they are about to have. “Well it's not a stomach bug like I thought it was.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well that's good....” He notices that Harry wasn't excited, so he stops and gets concerned all over again. “Well if it isn't then what is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm pregnant.” He whispers so quietly it almost impossible to hear. </p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry I didn't quiet catch that can you repeat that please?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks up at him with tears in his eyes. “Madam Pomphrey says that I'm pregnant!” Harry looks away as soon as he says this fearing the worst.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric stands up. “You're what?”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm pregnant Ced! I'm sorry for ruining everything.” Harry then breaks down into sobs that wrack is whole body.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric couldn't even believe what he was hearing right now, and he wasn't even sure which thing he should respond to first, the fact that his Harry was pregnant or the fact that Harry just apologized for thinking he ruined everything.</p><p> </p><p>Harry manages to get himself to stop shaking before he looks at his boyfriend again. “Cedric, are you okay? You're scarring me because you aren't saying anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric shakes his head and finally comes to his senses and he walks back over and sits down next to Harry. “Yeah I am just shocked that's all and I don't ever want to hear you say something like that again do you hear me? You haven't ruined anything; in case you haven't noticed it takes two people to create a new life. I'm not going anywhere we are in this together every step of the way.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was so worried that you would leave me and not want anything to do with me ever again.” Harry looked down at his hands while the tears continued to stream down his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, baby look at me please.” Harry looks up and Cedric wipes the tears off of his face with both of his thumbs. “I would never ever think of leaving you no matter what. I love you with all my heart.”</p><p> </p><p>Tears are continuing to fall from Harry's eyes but this time they are happy tears. “I love you too Ced more than I ever thought I could.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric leans down kisses him then gets serious again. “However, I believe now it is time to tell Sirius.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gulped but nodded in agreement. “Yeah we should not sure how he is going to take it though.”</p><p> </p><p>“We will never know until we tell him.” Sirius walks up. “Do the two of you mind if I take down the privacy and silencing charms?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shakes his head. “No, we need to talk to you anyway.” Sirius takes down the wards and comes into the room and takes a seat in an empty chair. “Alright you two what did she say?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Cedric look at each other. “Well I don't want you to get upset Siri but um there is going to be a new member to the family in 7 to 8 months.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius isn't dumb in the slightest. “Cedric what did you do to my godson? Didn't your father teach you the proper charms when having intercourse?"</p><p> </p><p>Cedric feels like he should be running away at this point but is able to stay put. “Um yes he did, and I did use them I swear.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius shook his head. "I had a feeling that this might happen you are way too powerful and your heritage probably makes it, so charms and spells won't work."</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks at his godfather confused. “What do you mean my heritage?”</p><p> </p><p>“You being a potter you are part of a very old magical family part of the original families as am I our magics are different than the normal magical family...I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you sooner I wasn't aware that you two had gotten that far in your relationship.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I'm sorry Siri I should have told you, but I'm not used to having someone care about me as a parental figure.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius and Cedric were both surprised to hear this and they happened to say at the same time. “And you won't have to worry about that ever again.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, you're not mad than?” Harry asked him.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I can't say that I'm entirely happy about it but no I'm not mad and once Remus finds out you know he won't want to leave you out of his sight.”</p><p> </p><p>The next month right after Harry's birthday Remus came to stay for a few weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius walks up to him and gives him a big hug. “Hey Remmy, why don't you come with me we have some things we need to talk about with the boys.”</p><p> </p><p>Immediately Remus gets worried. “Is everything okay? No one is hurt I hope?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius shakes his head. “No, it's nothing like that just come with me.” Remus nods and follows Sirius into one of the sitting rooms where he finds Harry and Cedric cuddled up together on a settee.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright you two what is this all about Siri already has me worried sick as soon as I get into the house.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shoots Sirius a look. “I'm sorry that he did that to you he should know better however using his brains for smarts isn't always his strong suite.” Remus and Cedric both look at him then they burst out laughing.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I take offense to that!” Sirius then pretends to pout.</p><p> </p><p>“Padfoot you really aren't attractive when you pout like that.” Remus manages to say between laughs.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius just sticks out his tongue and sits down across from them.</p><p> </p><p>Remus then sits down as well. “Okay boys really do you mind telling me what's going on please?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods. “Well a month ago, Poppy came down to check on me because I wasn't feeling well, and Cedric caught me getting sick, so I finally decided to get checked out.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus starts sniffing and growls. “Something smells different, Moony smells it. Cub you wouldn't happen to be carrying your own cub, would you?”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone in the room is shocked. Cedric finally speaks up. “How did you figure that so fast? And yes, I take responsibility for not taking better precautions.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus shakes his head. “It's a wolf thing and I don't blame you I'm sure Sirius told you, but contraceptives don't work on males of the Potter line especially those that are carriers.” He saw the confusing look coming from Harry. “Cub all that means is that some males are born with the ability to bear children we in the wizarding world call them carriers.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry just sits there for a second while he processes what Remus just told him.” Oh, okay I didn't know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn't expect you to since you were raised by those terrible muggles.” Again, Moony starts growling as he gets very protective of Harry. “All I can say is that I expect you to take care of him Cedric and I am glad that you are taking ownership of your actions but if anything happens to him...”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius and Harry both shout at the same time “Moony!!!!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don't scare him to death please.” Sirius gives him a look after seeing Harry's pleading expression.</p><p> </p><p>Remus gives them a sheepish look. “Okay I'm not trying to you know how my wolf gets mixed in with my personality sometimes I can't control it.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric speaks up. “It's okay Remus I understand, and you have my promise that I will do everything that I can to protect him.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus smiles. “Good that all Sirius and I can ask from you.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>The next month flew by very quickly and before Harry knew it his fifth year was about to start. They were all saying their goodbyes at Kings Cross.</p><p> </p><p>“If you need anything let me know.” Then he looks at Cedric. “And you better take good care of my godson and honorary grandson or I will find you then I will release Moony on you too.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric gulped but nodded. “I will sir I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay Siri don't worry I will let you know I promise and trust me Cedric will take good care of me.” Harry hugged Sirius and Remus then they both got on the train. He found Ron and Hermione and Cedric walked in and sat down with them.</p><p> </p><p>“So, Harry how was your first summer with Sirius?” Hermione asked him.</p><p> </p><p>“It was great, but I have to tell you guys something and it might come as a pretty big shock.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay then what is it?” Ron asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Well Cedric and I are going to be parents. I'm pregnant.” Harry then cringed a little in case shouting would come from his friends.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and Ron were shocked, but Hermione was the first one to speak. “I didn't even know that was possible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah me neither but Madam Pomphrey said that someone as powerful as me is able to and that there have been a couple of cases in the past. Also, both Sirius and Remus said that some males are born as what they call carriers meaning they are born with the ability to carry children.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron was next to speak. “Well mate we are here for you, but I don't think Ginny is going to be too, happy about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks Ron and Mione that means a lot. I know not everyone is going to be supportive.” Ron turned to Cedric and said. “You better not hurt him or you're going to wish you were never born.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Hermione said together “RON!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry then shakes his head in embarrassment and groans. “Why did you have to say something like that?”</p><p> </p><p>“What I'm just saying it's my job as your honorary brother.” Ron just looked at them.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric smiles. “You won't have to worry about that because I don't plan on hurting him.”</p><p> </p><p>A couple hours later and they finally all arrive at Hogwarts. Everyone gets off the train and goes inside to the great hall and all the students watch as the first year's gets sorted. “I hope Poppy knows a concealing charm because in a couple of months I won't be able to hide my condition.” Harry stated.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry don't worry about it and I'm sure she does.” Hermione told him.</p><p> </p><p>“I know I just don't want the whole school to know at least not yet anyways.” Harry said and looked down. Cedric grabbed his hand and just held it tight. “I'm just glad you guys are all still here to support me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it's the least we can do since you saved our asses more than once.” Ron said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah we are with you through thick and thin and till the end.” Hermione smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiles big. “Thanks guys it really means a lot to me I wasn't sure how this was going to but now I don't have to worry about some of our other friends either as I have a feeling, they will be supportive too.”</p><p> </p><p>Snape walked over to Cedric and whispered in his ear. “Dumbledore wants to speak to you in his office.” With that Snape walks away.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at him strange. “What was that about love?”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric redirects his gaze to Harry after Professor Snape walks away. “Dumbledore wants to see me in his office, I guess. So, I will see you later okay love?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah that's fine.” Harry kisses him and Cedric goes to Dumbledore's office.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric knocks on the headmaster's door. “Come in Cedric” Dumbledore says. So, Cedric walks into his office. “You wanted to see me sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I did Cedric my boy. Please sit down, would you like a lemon drop?”</p><p> </p><p>“No thank you sir, but if you could please tell me why you summoned me here that would be great.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well, it has come to my knowledge that you and Harry are going to be parents is that correct?”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric blushes. “I'm not sure how you manage to figure everything out but yes that would be correct.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I would like to have Harry live with you this school year while you are apprenticing under Professor Flitwick.”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric was shocked and was having a hard time forming complete thoughts in his head. “Are you, serious sir that would be amazing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes I am. I want the best for Harry, and I know he loves you more than anything, he even told me himself last year.” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye.</p><p> </p><p>“Well thank you very much sir this means a lot I won't let you down.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah it is Harry that I hope you won't let down and don't forget to meet with Professor Flitwick about setting up a schedule between the two of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will never let that happen sir I can promise you that and thank you very much again sir, I will make sure to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, good. Now then your room will be on the sixth floor next to the prefect's bathroom and the password is 'quidditch' and your things have already been moved.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, sir, I will let Harry know.” Cedric turns around feeling as if he was on cloud nine and leaves to find Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric doesn't have to look very hard as he finds Harry in the Great Hall right where he left him. “Harry, I have to tell you something very important and I hope you will like it just as much as I do.”</p><p> </p><p>
