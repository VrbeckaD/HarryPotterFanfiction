    <p>    “Don’t,” she whispered, but it was too late.</p><p>    Hermione fought against him, struggled to close her eyes, but she was helpless, and he was relentless. He tore through her memories. His magic burned, suffocated, smothered her shields and attempts to hide behind them. He ripped open her mind. He saw the Horcruxes. She heard herself screaming.</p><p>     He didn’t even hesitate.</p><p>     It was daggers through her skull. Her skin was on fire. <em>He didn’t stop! </em>She thought wildly. Her eyes rolled back. Darkness threatened to overtake her, and she welcomed it, but he wasn’t through. <em>Why didn’t he stop?! </em>Wasn’t that what he wanted? Didn’t he want to find out what the Order knew, what they planned?</p><p>     No, he was searching for something else. Something quieter. Something buried in the depths of her mind. The first time she’d explored herself, the first time she’d shattered and come undone at her own touch.</p><p>     <em>She was alone in her bed. Through the wall, there was moaning. Grunting. The frantic screech of springs and lips and hinges as the lovers drew closer to completion. Something slammed against her wall, slammed again. </em></p><p>
  <em>     Hermione rolled over in her bed. There was an unfamiliar sensation spreading through her body, centering between her thighs. Curious, she let a hand slide down her body…</em>
</p><p><em>     </em>Fantasies, imagined in moments of weakness as her body hurled toward climax, were being scrutinized. Memorized. Dark, shameful thoughts that had left her feeling embarrassed and filthy, but somehow fulfilled and alive. Kinks and fetishes she had never admitted to anyone, not only herself.</p><p>     He withdrew. She staggered and collapsed onto her knees. Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>     “How interesting,” Voldemort said. The Death Eater behind her wrenched her head back by her hair, forcing her to meet the Dark Lord’s mocking, serpentine gaze. It was torture, but she would not beg. She would not humiliate herself by pleading with him to let her go, to stop...</p><p>     “No, I don't believe you will,” Voldemort chuckled. “In fact, I don’t think you’ll beg for us to stop at all.”</p>
