</center><p>“It should be blue.”</p><p>“No, pink.”</p><p>“BLUE!”</p><p>“PINK!”</p><p>With a swish and flick, the formerly silvery gown was now a soft shade of blue. “Blue is subtle and dignified. Pink is insipid and will make her look sallow and haggard,” Narcissa had accepted that Hermione’s coloring was darker, but the curls made up for it. Oh, her grandchildren were going to be adorable cherubs.</p><p>Andromeda shot a spell at the dress, just missing Narcissa, and it turned a delicate shade of pink. The underskirt was the bright, bubblegum pink that Nymphadora had favored. “Pink is for love and tenderness, the color of contentment and softens frustration. Perhaps, it will help you get over this disappointing obsession with blue."</p><p>The door banged open, a shocked Hermione and enraged Pansy stood at the threshold. “I swear to Salazar if you spoiled the fabric with your spells, I will end you both. Do you know what I had to do to get this much Acromantula silk, <em>for fuck’s sake</em>?”</p><p>Both Black sisters both turned to her and shouted, “LANGUAGE!”</p><p>Pansy took advantage of their momentary distraction to return Hermione Granger’s wedding dress robes to silvery white the witch had requested. “This is why I need a shop,” she muttered as she pushed Hermione to the mirrors. She looked over her shoulder at the glaring sisters, “Her cake won’t bake itself, nor will the flowers arrange themselves, spontaneously. Come on, witches. We promised this bride the wedding of a lifetime. The full fairy godmother treatment.” Both sisters left the room with a huff. Pansy was sure she heard Narcissa say, “Bippity Boppity -<em> Bitch” </em> as she breezed past. Pansy shot a hex at her backside. The yelp and the basilisk glare were totally worth it.  </p><p>Hermione wiggled into the gown for her final fitting. She really did look like Cinderella, just as promised. All those hours of watching the 'movie' as Hermione called it had paid off. Pansy dropped to her knees to work on the hem. “You would think it was their wedding. You must be sick to death of their fussing. They aren’t even family. How do you tolerate them?” Pansy looked up and saw Hermione had gone still and tight. She sighed; she’d stepped on Hermione’s feelings yet again. Anything to do with family or Hermione’s lack thereof turned her fierce friend into a lost, little kitten. “Hermione, I didn’t mean it. Fuck. I’m sorry.”  </p><p>“No it's just - when I imagined my wedding, I thought it would be different. I certainly didn’t think that we would get kicked out of Twillfitt and Tattings.” Hermione smiled down at Pansy.</p><p>Pansy nodded. Watching Andromeda hex the shopkeeper into a parrot after he had called Narcissa '<em>Death Eater whore' </em>had been one of the more satisfying moments in the last year, which had seen high highs and low lows. It was yet another reason she couldn’t wait to open up Pandora’s Box. Owning her own robe shop had been Pansy’s dream since she was a little witch. She’d thought she would have to give up between the War, then the disastrous betrothal with the ancient hunchback from Trier her mother had tried to affiance her too. It had ended in her disownment, not that there had been much left anyway.</p><p>She had swallowed her pride and taken a shop witch position at Madam Malkin's. Pansy had tried to hide when she saw Hermione, but one of the designers had convinced her an absolute fashion don't would be perfect for her. <em> No one</em> looked good in paisley. They had been trying to move that putrid set of robes for months. Pansy couldn’t help herself when she said, “Patterns with that hair? People will hex their eyelids shut to avoid seeing it. ”</p><p>Hermione had turned red. The designer hissed "Quiet Death Eater Whore," and jinxed Pansy’s mouth away. Hermione was shocked at her treatment and immediately applied the counter-jinx. She took off the obnoxious set of robes and stomped out of the dressing room, grabbing Pansy’s hand on the way. She threw open the door with a crash and loudly informed Madam Malkin that she would not be purchasing any robes today, the only reason she had stopped in was to meet her <em>very good friend Pansy </em>for lunch. Pansy was pulled down the street by the 'Brightest Witch of Her Age' and found her self sitting in a small tea shop around the corner from the sweatshop she had just escaped from with a cup of tea and a lavender biscuit.  </p><p>Hermione plonked down across from her a bit out of breath, but flushed and triumphant. “The War is over. It’s time to move on, don’t you think?” Pansy nodded, but six years of animosity doesn’t fade quickly. They had an awkward tea, the weather was a safe topic, but their health was too fraught with painful reminders. When they parted ways, Pansy thought 'that was that.' </p><p>Then Hermione appeared the following week - Madam Malkin fell over herself to let Pansy take an actual break. Everyone loved "The Brightest" as the <em>Prophet</em> had dubbed her. They did a bit better that week.  They talked about Ginny’s tragic photoshoot with <em>Witch Weekly</em>. Hermione told her that Molly had sent three Howlers about the tawdry robes they had put her in.</p><p>Pansy rolled her eyes; the Weasley matriarch was a peasant. It explained so much about Ron. “They should never have put her in yellow. The Harpies have two colors, yellow and blue. Besides, the cut was all wrong.” Pansy conjured a pencil and started sketching on the napkin. If she had designed Ginny’s robes, they would have been a short A-line to show off her legs and see-through sleeves with her arms peeking out in a lighter shade of blue to contrast against the bodice of the bright blue that would make her hair shine. It was her best feature, even if she didn't like the bint. She looked up to see Hermione staring at her.</p><p>“Pansy, these are really good. Really, <em>very</em> good." Hermione cast a <em>muffliato</em> and an array of other privacy wards, half which Pansy wasn't even sure what they were guarding against. Then Hermione leaned in, "I have a confession. I hate the robes from Madam Malkin’s; they never fit me right.” She gestured to her bust. ”I am afraid to go into Twillfitt and Tattings. I can’t wear muggle clothes, because I get hate mail. Did you know when I appeared in jeans in <em>Witch Weekly?</em> I got twenty howlers. Twenty! Who cares about stupid clothes. But this is beautiful.” She touched the drawing on the napkin with a finger tracing the skirt. She looked up at Pansy with big kitten eyes. It was the most vulnerable she had ever seen the Great Hermione Granger. “This is like something a princess would wear. D-d-do you think you could make me this?”</p><p>Pansy was caught back-footed; this was not how she expected today to go. “I don’t have my sketches with me. What if I bring them next time?” Hermione smiled and nodded, looking relieved - another thing she had never seen from Hermione Granger. This was very odd, almost like being in an alternative universe. </p><p>When they met up next, Hermione explained to Pansy how Harry had given her proxy over the Black and Potter Wizengamot seats. Hermione was so full of ideas but frustrated because she was thwarted at every turn. The silly fool thought having a vote was enough. No one was taking her seriously. Pansy knew that as a Muggle-born, Hermione was making a dozen little mistakes that would set the Old Guard off, like being photographed in muggle clothes. By the end of the meal, Pansy had talked herself hoarse on subtle social cues and dressing for success, as her mother had called it. Iris Parkinson was a complete and utter cow but a cow that had started at least two enduring fashion trends - moving embroidery and a bust holding charm that did away with corsets or brasseries.  Hermione commissioned six new robes from Pansy that day, including a much more stylish take on her Wizengamot robes in a light crepe.</p><p>The weekly teas became twice a week. Then every other day. When Pansy had the first of the robes for fitting, they couldn’t do at the shop or in Hermione’s tiny flat. This is how Pansy found herself outside of a pretty cottage in the Cotswolds.</p><p>Pansy had known Narcissa Malfoy most of her life but was surprised when she met Andromeda Tonks. The sisters looked very similar, black hair, grey eyes, broom straight backs, but they couldn’t have been less alike. Meda, as she insisted Pansy call her, was warmth, elegance, and sly winks. The way she wrangled little Teddy, it was hard to believe she was his grandmother and not his actual mother. Hermione was Teddy's godmother and occasional babysitter. Pansy started working at Andromeda’s house a few nights a week. It was like having an aunt that she wanted to visit, even little Teddy was growing on her. Pansy would let him sit with her if Andromeda needed to run an errand. </p><p>When the new robes were finished, Hermione had paraded around the Cottage in them, twirling and giggling like a little girl. Pansy was proud of her work. “I have a surprise for you,” Hermione said. The Floo flared, and a photographer stepped out followed by Lavender Brown. “I asked <em>Witch Weekly</em> to take pictures.” They posed and talked for hours. The idea was Pansy and Hermione would both be featured in the article talking about moving on from the War and doing bigger better things. Pansy tried to play it off casually, but she was so excited. Finally, her life was starting. She was on her way. </p><p>Pansy had forgotten just what a bitch Fortuna was. She shouldn't have been surprised when her luck ran out. It always did. When the <em>Witch Weekly</em> article appeared, three things happened. First, Madam Malkin fired her. She didn't even get severance. She had precisely five galleons and 30 sickles to her name. Second, because part of her pay was a room above the shop, she was now homeless and her pitiful savings she would get her exactly one night at the Leaky Cauldron. Crying, she apparated blind and was surprised when she stood in front of the Tonk's Cottage. She collected herself, but when Meda opened the door, the tears welled up again. The older witched wrapped her in a hug then poured cup upon cup of sweet, hot tea into her. She listened to Pansy fret about what she would do. No job, no roof over her head. Most of the money she had earned from Hermione's commissions went to fabric, notions, and the tools she needed to make the robes.</p><p>She was staring at her empty cup, contemplating how much she had in common with the dregs, then the third thing happened.  Meda reached out and grabbed her hand, “Pansy, why don’t you move in with us? We have a room. Your sewing kit is already here. Teddy loves you. And I, well, it’s good to have you here.”</p><p>Pansy was shocked. Since her disownment. She had seen her mother exactly twice, and both times she had looked through Pansy like she was a stranger. It had chilled Pansy to the bone, even though it was summer. “You would really want me?” She hated how small her voice sounded. </p><p>Meda smiled and patted her hand, “I miss Nymphadora. I know you aren’t her. But before you came, I was talking to the air, Pansy. Having you here has been a balm for my soul.” Both women started crying. It had turned into a Celestina Warbeck song; the only good thing was her familiar hadn't died nor had Gringott’s taken her galleons. They probably would have continued hugging and crying, if there hadn’t been pecking at the window. Meda used her wand to clean up Pansy's tear-stained face, a charm she had seen her use on Teddy dozens of times. The simple action warmed the cold place in her heart left by her mother.  </p><p>A majestic eagle owl swooped in and dropped a letter in front of Pansy. But it wasn’t the only one. Four other owls followed it in. She opened up the letters. The first was from Narcissa Malfoy. She had seen Pansy’s work in <em> Witch Weekly, </em>and she wanted to know if Pansy could accommodate designing a gown for the upcoming Imbolc festival. She opened the others, and there were a total of 8 different commissions. Pansy sat back gobsmacked.    </p><p>The commissions had tailed off as the year went on, but with careful planning and saving, she had gathered enough to rent a small storefront near Twillfitt and Tattings. She planned to open after Hermione’s Wedding. <em> The Dress </em>was her gift to Hermione. And as the most photographed and talked of garment this year, so help her Salazar, it would give a boost to her business, she was a Slytherin, why not kill two doxies with one curse? It needed to be perfect down to the last tuck, gather, and stitch, even if she had to get the damn Acromantula silk herself.</p>
