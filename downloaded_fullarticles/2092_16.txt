  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>The battle of Hogwarts has reached its culmination. At last, the Dark Lord Voldemort, Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr. at the hands of the Chosen One. A new era was to be ushered. Harry glanced at the Elder Wand, here he was, a true Master of Death.</p><p><br/>
He slowly stood up from the ground and watched as the crack of the dawn began to rise. The light was slow and creeping as it reached him. Its warmth filling his body with a feeling he had forgotten. Surely, this was the end of it. He has fulfilled his role, the very reason so many believed in him because no matter how powerful another wizard was, it ultimately came down to him being the only one that Voldemort’s demise will come. His walk back to the Great Hall felt anticlimactic but proper. The stillness and silence were not deafening but rather welcoming. There was no applause or anything grand that signaled his victory. He has done it, he had rid of the one thing that prevented him from living a life that was solely his. He made it to the Great Hall entrance walking ever so slowly, witnessing all that was lost and all that he has managed to salvage. He was not the savior here however, he merely did his part, he thought of how everyone sacrificed so much more than what they had. He was destined to either sacrifice himself or die but all the friends and family he had made along the suffered far more.</p><p>Hermione walked towards him, with Ron right behind her. Without a word, they knew the battle was over.</p><p>“It’s…it’s over,” said Harry breathlessly, unsure how to feel in the victory they had rightfully earned. Hermione hugged him very tightly and Ron joined in as he struggled to keep the tears from flowing from his eyes. Hermione’s hold of him felt like she was scared he’d suddenly be taken away from them all too soon. It felt like they were hugging for ages before Hermione broke off the contact and hit Harry in the chest.</p><p><br/>
“Ouch! What was that for Hermione?”</p><p><br/>
“We thought we lost you…Ron tell him,” said Hermione as she went to hug Harry again but this time a bit shorter and more relaxed.</p><p><br/>
“Mate, we couldn’t believe it. The feeling was…just don’t go running off again without saying goodbye next time. I’ll hit you harder than Hermione,” he managed to say at last as he put his hands on his shoulder in acknowledgment. Harry’s shoulder felt a weight for a moment as if his friend managed to put all his worry and own fears in that but he relaxed and patted Ron’s shoulder in the same manner.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to say goodbye. I’m sorry,” Harry stated solemnly. His face was filled with apology and sadness. He truly did not know how to say goodbye to the two friends he had from the beginning. He was uncertain if he was going to live but he did not want to burden them. It was his destiny, his only task to ultimately sacrifice himself and he had done it.<br/>
“Walk with me?” he added as he felt unready to face everyone else at the moment and led them to the Black Lake. Hermione kept close as did Ron as if to tell him that they understood what he needed to do.</p><p><br/>
They stood together in silence looking at the Black Lake. Harry then took out the Elder Wand and Hermione took out Harry’s older wand from her purse in silence.</p><p><br/>
“Reparo” Harry whispered as his old wand presented itself to him again, brand new.</p><p><br/>
“Amazing,” was all Hermione could say as the old Holly wand glowed in front of them.</p><p><br/>
“Which one will you be using Harry?” Ron asked as Harry moved to tuck both in his tarnished jacket.</p><p><br/>
“Both,” Harry replied simply. “I can’t just leave it anywhere. Someone is bound to challenge me for it and my chances are better if I have it.” His gaze was still fixed to the lake as Ron and Hermione stood and nodded in response.</p><p><br/>
“What now?” Hermione asked breaking the silence. They all laughed at the simplicity of the moment. What he would give for this moment of peace to have come sooner.</p><p><br/>
Today, a new promising dawn awaits them.</p><p>========================================================================</p><p><br/>
“That’s good, Mr. Potter, very good. Time will tell if you will prove to be a formidable opponent, or a fraud.” said a voice, elsewhere.</p>
