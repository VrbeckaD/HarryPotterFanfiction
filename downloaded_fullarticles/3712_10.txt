    <p>Greta Blackburn wishes for a lot of things. She wishes her knack for mixing downers with alcohol (<em>double downers</em>, her best friend Lacie Parker would say) didn’t make her vomit her insides out but alas, it’s how things are. <br/> To achieve a certain level of zen, Greta needed just the right mix. Ten shots to a fourth of a tablet. Ten bloody shots of brandy laced with cheap cinnamon. <em> It’s not that bad if you don’t think too much about it, </em> Greta caught herself explaining to Lacie her choice of poison time and time again. <br/> Having said this, Greta wished she chose a classier taste in liquor but with her bills and rent to pay, really bad brandy with sub-par spices was all that she could afford. <br/>The next question lies on how she got the downers anyway. She nicks them from her roommate, Priscilla Waters, who leaves her medication lying around.</p><p>Not so long ago, Greta was piss drunk, aimlessly looking for an Advil when she stumbled on a crisscrossed tablet on the kitchen table (or was it the medicine cabinet above the sink?). And the rest was history. At least, the fragments that she remembers of it. </p><hr/><p><br/> Greta Blackburn wishes people would understand. One thing that irks her is when an inconsiderate person would barrage her with nonsense before she was awake. Mind you, she would already be dressed and made up but not a single drop of coffee was to be found in her system. <br/> She would haphazardly walk to the nearest (preferably, very affordable) coffee shop, get her Americano and face the day with determination. At least, that’s how she pictured it. <br/> She demanded respect from those around her about her No Coffee, No Greta rule. Simply put, you can’t get Greta Blackburn to do shit if a single drop of caffeine was missing from her body. <br/> Unfortunately, as reality would put it, not everyone was knowledgeable of the No Coffee, No Greta rule. <br/> So when some git asks her to pass him <em> some Stevia, not Splenda nor that white sugar shit, </em> she was ready for cold bloody murder right there and then in the yellow-lit hipster third-wave coffee shop. <br/> “For the love of god, get it yourself you stinking-,’’ She was about to go full-on with her lashing out when she noticed the said git was well, somewhat close to beautiful. Or whatever. <br/> Without missing a beat, the beautiful-or-whatever git replied, “For your information, lovely miss, I showered this morning. It’s patchouli.” <br/> For some reason, Greta’s brain was knocked off-balance. Maybe his face was a bit too chiseled (oh, that jaw – that bloody freaking jaw), or his cocky man-bun of jet-black hair or shit, whatever the fuck is patchouli? <br/> “Whatever. You still stink and get your sugar yourself,” Greta always had the last say and with that, she stomped her way from the coffee shop that seemed too small now that the git occupied the same space as she did. </p><hr/><p><br/> Funnily enough, Greta was never late for her classes in university. She’d like to thank the coffee for that. <br/> She’d power walk her way through ten blocks (or more, depending on which coffee shop she chose that day) and would sit in the middle T-Zone of each class she was in. <br/> You see, Greta values the T-Zone of learning very much. The theory states that the most learning a student could get is if the student is seated in the T-Zone – the front and right across the middle of the lecture hall, in the direct line of sight of the professor. <br/> Greta didn’t bother with going away from her beloved T-Zone because well, the T-Zone is the key to her funding her scholarship. <br/> There are two things Greta Blackburn values in life: first, is a good shag and second, it’s making sure her grades touched the sky. <br/> So when a certain git sits at the very front and middle (the star seat, Greta would call it), she was aghast. Or whatever. <br/> He’s just a git in a coffee shop who happened to be in her Introductory Economics class. <br/> No. Big. Deal. <br/> // <br/>Professor Nickletwerp was somewhere between a raging monster on steroids and a raging monster on insane amounts of Coca-Cola. The second assumption was because he never started a class without a can of Coke on his table. By the end of the class, he’d crush the tin can, give their homework and reading list, and on good days, he won’t shout at the latecomers before they left the room. Why he does it at the end of the class, Greta didn’t know and won’t really bother knowing. It was just amusing seeing him turn tomato-red with rage and calmly dismiss them with, “See you tomorrow, you insufferable lot.”</p><p>Greta was having a bit of difficulty with the graphs but she was too proud to admit it to anyone. <em> Jesus, it’s just a supply and demand curve. Come on, Greta! Pull your tiny head together! </em></p><p>Greta wishes she wasn’t too hard on herself. But she’s read the first few chapters of their Economics book and she’s pretty sure what she’s missing is the easy stuff. Easy stuff. How <em> pathetic</em>.</p><p>“Your graphs are wrong.”</p><p>A tall shadow obscured her view of her notebook.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Greta looks up and she sees <em> him. </em>How dare he look at her notes without asking?</p><p>“It’s fairly easy, you know. Some factor affects supply or some factor affects demand, some movement then an easy, straightforward graph.”</p><p>Greta starts to purse her lips. He was unnerving and possibly, very insulting.</p><p>“Well, my graphs aren’t your problem so bugger off.” She starts to angrily put her things into her backpack.</p><p>“It could be. I could tutor you.” He says the last sentence with a confident grin.</p><p>“How about…” She pretends to stroke her chin in thought. “<em>No</em>.”</p><p>Then she marches angrily from the classroom, embarrassed or whatever.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Please say your day is going better than mine.”</p><p>Lunch break always meant Greta had time to catch up with Lacie Parker who was far smarter than she was and was at the top of their class. She might as well give the valedictory speech now than wait two more years for it. For simplicity’s sake, Lacie Parker was the girl your grandmother was proud you were friends with. And for Greta Blackburn, not a lot of things impressed her nan but Lacie Parker did. Lacie Parker impresses everyone.</p><p>Lacie had platinum blonde hair (she claims it’s natural, Greta might as well believe her) and steel gray eyes. She was also a tiny little thing. How such a brilliance can fit in such a petite figure, Greta could only guess.</p><p>“Well, there’s nothing much that happened today except for that one time I saw this really dreamy guy in the hallway. Oh wait! There he is! Look!”</p><p>Greta had to stop Lacie from pointing at - well, damn. It was the Patchouli guy from the coffee shop.</p><p>“Oh shit.”</p><p>“What? You don’t think he’s an angel?”</p><p>“That he fell from the heavens? Well, he might as well be Lucifer reincarnated.”</p><p>Lacie widened her eyes in shock. Greta wonders why Lacie even puts up with her perpetual sour mood.</p><p>“What did that guy ever do to you?”</p><p>Greta gave a sly smile. “He’s annoying and conceited. Trust me on this. Best to stay away. The man-bun is a clear warning.”</p><p>Lacie gave a confused look at Greta, looking for an explanation but all Greta did was take a bite from her sandwich and glare at Patchouli guy who was surrounded by three other guys who were probably from their year, too.</p><p>
  <em> Wow, he even has friends. Pity. </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next day wasn’t any better.</p><p>Patchouli guy was waiting for Greta at the coffee shop and before she could even shrug him off he handed a coffee cup to her.</p><p>“Americano. <em> Black</em>. You’re welcome.”</p><p>“Can you stop that?”</p><p>Patchouli guy straightened up from where he was leaning against the wall. “Stop what? Being devilishly handsome and making you swoon?”</p><p>“Gross. What have you got in that pig head of yours?”</p><p>He smirked. “Best drink your coffee to lighten up the mood, Greta.”</p><p>Greta nearly spat out her drink. “How did you know my name, you stalker?”</p><p>“Your notebook has the name Greta Blackburn in bold. Doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to read that.”</p><p>She was just about done with this conversation, even if the coffee was just starting to kick in. Maybe the rule No Coffee, No Greta has exceptions.</p><p>“I’m Sirius,” He said it with practiced confidence. Like she was supposed to know his name already or something. “My offer to tutor you still stands, among other things.”</p><p>With that, he winked at her and walked away without a second glance, leaving Greta fuming and maybe just a little bit flattered that he knew her name.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>They had a dreadful quiz that day in Introductory Economics.</p><p>Sure, Greta knew all about land, labor, and capital as well as rent, wages, and profit. She sure as hell knew the <em> theory </em>of supply and demand but as the factors increased, she saw herself sinking in her seat in a cold sweat.</p><p>It didn’t help that Sirius was directly in her line of sight and he boastfully turned his paper in first.</p><p>As he passed his paper, he gave a smirk at her direction much to her derision. Damn, why was she even looking?</p><p>She was one of the last students to turn her paper in and much to her dismay, that always meant no good.</p><p>Another sign of her day worsening was Sirius waiting for her outside their classroom.</p><p>“Tut, tut. Last to turn in? Greta, you’re losing your touch. But you know, you can touch me instead while I tutor you.”</p><p>Greta stopped in her tracks and glared at him.</p><p>“Tut, tut,” She replied. “Oh Sirius, is that the best you’ve got?” She rushed across the hallway without a second glance. Laughter from Sirius’ friends echoed as she stepped out of the building.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The week passed by as dreadfully as it came.</p><p>By Friday, Greta found her way to the supermarket to replenish her stash of awful liquor when she bumped into the messy haired boy with the hipster glasses that always hung out with Sirius.</p><p>“Oy, James! We need more Stoli!” Sirius’ voice rang out from the aisle next to theirs.</p><p>“James! Stoli and more of that shit Peter likes - the one with the cinnamon.” Greta could hear a murmur of approval from the lanky boy called Peter. He seemed to shrink compared to the sullen-faced sickly looking friend of theirs who by no surprise, was quite good-looking as well.</p><p>“James! James, the liquor won’t find itself in our trolley if you don’t - oh, hello there. What have we got here?” Darn lizard guts, he saw her.</p><p>“Oy, Peter! She likes the same shit as you do!”</p><p>Almost like clockwork, Peter and Remus (she overheard James telling him that he didn’t look too well to drink), appeared beside James and Sirius.</p><p>“Good taste in liquor,” Peter quipped, seemingly pleased that someone else appreciated his favourite drink. “Shots, I suppose?”</p><p>“No other way.” Greta found herself replying without thinking first. She didn’t want to associate herself with these weasels much less talk about liquor with them.</p><p>“Got any plans tonight, pretty miss?” Sirius snaked his arm around her shoulders which Greta tried to shrug off but to no avail.</p><p>She raised the bottle of brandy, “Shots. Lots of them then who knows what comes next?” Actually, she did know. She’ll be spending the night with a double downer and sleep until 1 o’clock in the afternoon the next day.</p><p>“Mmm, how about this - since you and Peter like the same <em> shit </em> -,” (“It’s not shit, Sirius! It’s brandy with a cinnamon aftertaste! It’s spicy goodness!”), “you might as well join us for some welcome drinks.”</p><p>Remus piped in, “And who are we welcoming, Sirius?”</p><p>“Greta, of course! She’s been such a doll this whole week, hasn’t she?” He flashed her a toothy grin, the kind that needed to be punched off such a beautiful face. Or whatever.</p><p>“Do come, Greta! I always drink the liquor alone since no one seems to like it. Shots! They’re meant for shots, James!”</p><p>At that moment, James started to imitate what appeared to be a drunken Peter.</p><p>The din on the aisle caused by the four boys was deafening and all Greta wanted was to get her liquor in peace and double down the evening. But for some reason, she was pretty inclined to go with them.</p><p>With a sigh, she put down her bottle of liquor in their trolley. “Best to buy me pizza if you’re kidnapping me for the night.”</p><p>Sirius punched a fist into the air and said, “That’s the spirit, doll! That’s the spirit!”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was safe to say that Sirius was pretty fucking loaded. His flat was all glass, white, and obviously very expensive. Greta could see her reflection on the floor-to-ceiling glass window. Her dark brown hair was struggling to get away from the bun she hastily put it in. Her lounge pants and jumper were obviously <em> (not) </em> attractive. She was just going to the supermarket after all.</p><p>As the night wore on, the drunker they all became, Greta noted how much she missed getting sloshed without a pill helping her sleep. Sleep came rarely to her nowadays which was probably why she drank a bit too much and a bit too often.</p><p>At this point, James said some sort of joke and everyone was laughing. Greta had half a mind to join in but stopped herself when she saw Sirius looking sideways at her from the massive couch they were both sitting on.</p><p>The lounge chairs were occupied by Remus and Peter while James occupied the floor for some reason (“It’s a much better view for when those two start snogging! I’ll warn you lot when it happens, don’t worry for a second! I will warn you!”) James slurred his proclamation while Remus, quite embarrassed for the rest of them berated James, “James, we can pretty much see the two from here. And if any snogging happens, the rule applies. We get the hell out of here.”</p><p>They talked about Greta and Sirius snogging so nonchalantly that she was starting to believe it was indeed going to happen.</p><p>As the night wore on, more bottles littered the glass table and the counter and the floor to James’ dismay. He was running out of space to “guard the snogging teenagers.”</p><p>By 2 o’clock in the morning, Peter was passed out near the counter, Remus was asleep in his chair, and James was singing made-up songs that were just gibberish.</p><p>“So...why did you come here?” Sirius turned to look at Greta.</p><p>Greta wasn’t sure if she was blushing or whatever. Probably whatever. “You invited me, you nitwit.”</p><p>“No, but <em> why </em> did you?”</p><p>Greta gave a rueful smile and gave him a short summary of what happens during a double downer.</p><p>“Wow, that sounds...”</p><p>“Boring. I know,” Greta was slowly realizing how uninteresting her life was outside school when Sirius cupped her chin and began to study her.</p><p>“What... what are you doing?”</p><p>He was silent and turned her head slightly to the sides, somewhat like how Greta’s mom picked out cabbages from the supermarket.</p><p>“You look nice when you’re not scowling.”</p><p>This time, Greta was sure she was blushing. “Erm - <em> okay </em>. Sure.”</p><p>He then proceeded to highlight her face slowly with the tip of his thumb, as if he was going to break her if he pressed too hard.</p><p>Then out of nowhere, without anything warning, Sirius asked, “Can I kiss you?”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Greta wasn’t sure what happened next.</p><p>The shuffling of feet going out the door when James woke the whole neighborhood up with, “It’s happening! They’re snogging! Get up! Snogging! Then you know what’s next! Oy, Peter. Get up!”</p><p>Then Greta vaguely remembers Sirius hoisting her up, lips still attached to hers and rushing towards his room (which was massive just like - well, Greta soon found out that Sirius’ room wasn’t the only massive thing he owned).</p><p>She remembers the kisses being hurried, quite sloppy and their clothes seemed like they were being taken off by magic. Or Sirius probably ripped hers off and ripped his off and <em> oh god</em>, he was beautiful.</p><p>Greta doesn’t remember much, just that, she woke up sore and hungover the next morning with a sleeping Sirius Black beside her.</p><p>When it all dawned on her - the night before, the snogging, the shagging - she let out a piercing scream, “<em>WHAT THE FUCK! </em>”</p><p><br/> </p>
