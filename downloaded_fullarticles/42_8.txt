          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus Lupin’s world shattered twice…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time he was 21</p>
<p>Three of his closest friends lost to Death</p>
<p>The last to a fate far worse to endure</p>
<p>And far harder to stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His world faded to gray</p>
<p>Left alone to pick up the broken pieces</p>
<p>Not even allowed to raise their legacy</p>
<p>What had he to live for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he <em>survived</em></p>
<p>On the fringes for 12 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally a trickle of color enters his world</p>
<p>A sharp emerald green</p>
<p>But with it the painful loss of familiarity</p>
<p>With each “Professor Lupin” instead of “Uncle Moony”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that trickle gushes into a flood</p>
<p>With each inky footprint and long dead name</p>
<p>As the full picture of that dreadful night</p>
<p>Comes into focus with blinding clarity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dull black fur gives way to pale flesh</p>
<p>No longer that glossy coat that shone with deep purples and blues</p>
<p>No longer a rosy pink flush blooming in those cheeks</p>
<p>As if <em>He</em> had faded to gray too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But those eyes unchanged</p>
<p>A sharp steely gray</p>
<p>That piercing glance goes straight to his soul</p>
<p>His heart frozen for 12 years began to beat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each new moment treasured</p>
<p>Nothing taken for granted</p>
<p>With each new golden sunrise</p>
<p>Eyes grew brighter, Cheeks grew fuller, Moments grew warmer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The world blossomed again for them both</p>
<p>Harder than the first time</p>
<p>But neither minded the effort needed</p>
<p>To mend those broken shards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They <em>lived</em></p>
<p>No longer just survived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second time he was 36</p>
<p>His hope that had been restored</p>
<p>His lifeline that had begun to heal those old cracks</p>
<p>His <em>Star </em>that brought light back to his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lost in a flash of green</p>
<p>Stolen by a mad woman with a grudge</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His <em>heart</em> stopped</p>
<p>Two years before his body.</p></div>
