    <p>“Bellatrix, please” Albus sat down his glass and shifted in his seat, leaning to one side and holding the bridge of his nose. </p><p> </p><p>“Albus, this boy. If what you say is true, then he is the answer. And you left him in the hands of a bunch of disgusting muggles!” She dropped her hand harshly to the wooden table, the glasses and cutlery making a metallic sound. </p><p>“Bella, those muggles you hate so much, are his family. And yes they have some” he paused, trying to choose his words carefully. “Characteristic that are less than appealing. But they are what will mould him into what he needs to become”</p><p>Bellatrix sat back down, a butter knife now in her hand and digging into the old wood of the chairs armrest.</p><p>Albus stood, taking a last sip of his drink and placing the glass back down with out a sound. “There is another matter to discuss. Severus” the quiet man at the end of the table took to attention. He sat straighter than what looked comfortable and looked around the room.</p><p>“There has been a child born” a scoff from bellatrix, a mumbled ‘of course there has.’ A pointed look from Albus made her go quiet. “This child is a blood relative of The dark lord.” Bellatrix sat up, the knife in her hand had gone still.</p><p>“The child is Voldermort’s biological sister, they share a muggle father. The has girl revealed some magical abilities. But she is currently in a muggle monastery and being cared for by nuns”</p><p>Bellatrix stood, her chair flying from behind her and the knife that was once keeping her quiet now dug deep into the table. “You, plan to.” Bella couldn’t wrap her head around the concept. “You plan on creating another dark lord” Bella spoke slowly, trying to understand something she obviously wasn’t seeing, “you’ll let this child grow to hate muggles” her voice grew with anger. Albus walked to his desk, grabbing a small parchment.</p><p>Albus understood where Bellatrix’s concern was coming from, fear. Fear of another war that they all would be stuck in. Fear that this time things would go less favourably.</p><p>“There was a prophecy. Read by our own Sybill Trelawney.” Albus spoke, returning to the table with a rolled parchment. Placing it in front of bellatrix.</p><p>Anger still running through her blood, she gripped the parchment too hard. “Unless it says the child won’t be a psychopathic mass murderer, I don’t see how it will help” she pulled open the parchment, in Albus’s own handwriting it read;</p><p>Born through blood and mud<br/>
Seen as less<br/>
But made for more<br/>
The one who will save us all<br/>
Will be marked for all to see<br/>
Magic that ends will never know<br/>
Owned by the one with the blackest heart<br/>
Keeper of the blackest heart<br/>
Born of mud and blood but will surpass the purest</p><p>“This means nothing.” She tried to make sense of it. Tried to see an argument that would help her cause, but she quickly came up blank.</p><p>“This child may be the key to ending the incoming war” Severus almost looked as if he had the exact same conversation with Albus.</p><p> He was right, it didn’t exactly mean this child was good nor bad. But she would save people. But on which side. “It also says she will have power to no end. And if the prophecy is wrong and she chooses her brothers side. Then?”</p><p>Albus let out a sigh, his former student had always been a thorn in his side, but he didn’t realise that this thorn would follow him this late into his life.</p><p>The main reason bellatrix left after the death of her lord was his plan for Muggle Born. She had found his writings and his plans to eradicate the muggle born and the witches and wizards in relationships with muggles. She didn’t want to blame the child for the sins of her blood, but a single apple will spoil the barrel.</p><p>But in Bellatrixs eyes this child, The child they want to let live and to end up in the exact same place they are now in a few years, this thing wasn’t innocent, it was like a tumour. They were only letting it grow.</p><p>“Severus, can you give us a moment” Albus asked as he dusted off the wood chips that had been flung form Bella’s chair onto his robes. Severus stood silently and left the room, the obnoxious creeks from the door leaving the two in an thick silence.</p><p>Albus sat back down into his chair, taking a few moments to get comfortable. A huff from the witch standing before him gave him the impression he should hurry. “I made you a promise. The night you came to me. I promised you that he wouldn’t murder thousands of innocent people, do you still trust in me enough to believe in that promise”</p><p>Bellatrix tried wanted to scream no, she wanted to leave the room and find this child and end any thought of another uprise of a fanatic. But she did believe him.</p><p> </p><p>_/\_</p><p>The energy on the bridge was electric, excitement filled each crevice and each student watch with child like glee. Every few minutes a new school would arrive in an extravagant fashion and led to more excitement.</p><p>But as kids screamed and yelled at the flying horses and the boat rising out of the water Hermione was quiet, still excited but a figure wandering across the field near the lake caught her eye. A dark mass of shadows in the middle of the day, flowing so gracefully across the expansive green of the grass, Hermione didn’t understand why she was so captivated at this figure, but she couldn’t look away.</p><p>The bridge began to clear once people figured the boat was the last thing to happen. “You coming Hermione?” Harry stood waiting with Ron. Hermione pulled away and watched her friends.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry” she looked back at the now empty field. A odd feeling in her stomach made her grimace, she didn’t understand what was occurring at this moment, Or why it effected her so much.</p><p>—</p><p>The reveal of the Tri-Wizard tournament being hosted at hogwarts left everyone in an overly excited mood for the rest of dinner.</p><p>Boys boasting how they would easily win the tournament, ‘all I need is a wand and I’ve already won’ Hermione heard one of the Slytherin boy yell out through the chicken in his mouth. </p><p>But Hermione felt off, like a part of the universe had been shifted and everything else had to quickly move back into place. She was on edge, her mind wouldn’t slow down, and if she hadn’t learned long ago how to keep a straight face in any situation she would be a mess.</p><p>A faint pain began to climb up her hand, discreetly she pulled up her sleeve to see nothing. No bite or scratch was anywhere to be seen. Hermione didn’t know what was happening. Before she could stand and go to her dormitory or ask a professor the doors once again opened.</p><p>This time no large collection of students, but a single woman strode through the walk way with such confidence and authority as soon as her presence was realised almost all students went silent.</p><p>The witch was dressed in complete black, a long black dress that looked as if it was once peak fashion in the 1800s and a black corset that seemed much too inappropriate for a school that held children. Her hair alone could be a characteristic, it sat long, curled and jet black. It looked crazy and untameable yet elegant and so so captivating.</p><p>Hermiones breath was struck out of her chest, the mere presence of this woman was enough to strike a room full of insolent children silent, god knows what she could do with real intention.</p><p>The woman looked towards Hermione, eyes never directly meeting her. Dark black scanned over the crowed, seemingly intentionally missing the young Gryffindor.</p><p>“That’s Bellatrix Black” Neville said quietly, Hermiones mouth went dry. Rumours about this woman were spread around the school, from her being cursed to serve the dark lord to her being a vampire. The last one was obviously false Hermione thought the first time she heard of it, Vampires lived on strict laws and a registered one would have to live in certain parts of England.</p><p>But the one that hurt her the most was that Bellatrix Black murdered any muggleborn she met. The feeling of disgust and shame ran though her as she watched the woman walk down the rows of students, She in all of her dark allure had killed more people than Hermione had probably met.</p><p>Dumbledore finally realised of the newcomers presence, he made his was to the podium, “students, I’d like to introduce your new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher” he paused as Bellatrix made her way up the stairs and stood next to him, no expression on her face. “Miss Black, will be join us here at Hogwarts” the room stayed silent.</p><p>Dumbledore looked to bellatrix who still stood there expressionless and dictating with no words. Draco Malfoy began to clap, slowly the whole row of Slytherins then the Hufflepuff then the whole room was in a state of confused applause.</p><p>Miss Black stood at the podium, Dumbledore just behind her as the applause died down, she scanned the room quickly, this time setting on the younger witch. Sitting under the woman’s gaze was excruciating, honour and guilt ran though Hermione as she began to speak.</p><p>“Thank you Albus” she paused and looked back at the older man who gave a small smile in return, “I’m eager to get into class with you all” her eyes returned to Hermione and a feeling in Hermione as if she was speaking directly to her, “see whether the standards of this prestigious school had gone down since my years here” she stated, a smile graced her lips. It wasn’t a happy smile, nor a face one. Hermione didn’t know what it meant but it left a sick feeling in her stomach.</p><p>Bellatrix walked away from the podium, striding to the table of Professors and sitting at the furthest seat next to Professor Snape. Dumbledore returned to his seat and continued his usual conversation and observations of the students, but his eyes seemed to get stuck on a certain young Gryffindor girl too often to be coincidence.</p><p>Once dinner was done and everyone headed to their rooms or to showers, Hermione walked back slowly. Ever since Bellatrix walked into the room just an hour or so again she had been wondering about her parentage and her up bringing.</p><p>she looked down at the scars across her knuckles. Being raised by strict old women and a schizophrenic pastor didn’t generally lead to a shining childhood. But as she inspected the various scars on her hands and fingers, she was given the sight of a mark that annoyed her beyond belief.</p><p>a small spiral seared deep into her skin, she didn’t remember getting it, she didn’t even remember when it showed up, but the silver of the skin against the tanner skin made it obvious that something had happened.</p><p>“Miss Granger” an older voice ripped her away from her thoughts. Dumbledore stood in his light blue robes, a slight smile sat on his face.</p><p>“Headmaster” Hermione turned fully to face the older wizard, he held a vibe of caring uncle and loving grandfather mixed into a skinny Santa box.</p><p>“If you wouldn’t mind accompanying me to my office I have some things I would like to discuss with you” </p><p>Hermione accepted her teachers request, re thinking her last few days if she had done anything wrong and she came up blank. What ever reason she was getting in trouble or what ever reason she is getting a personal escort to the headmasters office probably wasn’t a good one.</p>
