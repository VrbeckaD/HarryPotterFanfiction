    <p>
  <span>Everyone on planet Earth has a soulmate. You can’t be born without one. Some have multiple, and some choose not to stay with theirs. Some soulmates die. But everyone on Earth has a soulmate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every person also has a soulmate mark. On each person’s forearm, from birth to death, are the first words you hear your soulmate say to you. Some are lucky— they get things like names or specific times and dates, but others get nothing but a vague statement. But every person has a soulmate mark. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That, unfortunately, includes Addie Salem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Addie Salem was not one of the lucky people. Addie’s soulmate mark is dangerous knowledge and dark information. Addie’s soulmate mark causes her entire life to be sideways; a little less than one.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Addie's soulmate mark is nothing more than a simple statement, but it is an awful one.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I can’t believe Dumbledore dies.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>From the moment she was born, Addie was cursed with knowledge. Her mother cried when she was born for two reasons: her birth, of course, and the awful information tattooed on her forearm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Addie grew up confused. She knew nothing for a long time of who this </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dumbledore </span>
  </em>
  <span>was or why his death was so shocking. It was only when she picked up a book in the library entitled </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone </span>
  </em>
  <span>that she began to realize that drastic nature of her soulmate mark. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the entirety of her life, Addie was ridiculed and shamed for her soulmate mark. She was shut out and hated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for this, she began to resent her soulmate, whoever they were. She vowed that whoever it was, she could never find a way to love her soulmate. Not after how they’d harmed her life so much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Addie promised herself that her soulmate, whoever they may be, would never, ever be together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not if Addie had anything to do with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she had everything to do with it. </span>
</p>
