          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus smiled at me from across the illuminated candlelight dinner is his quarters. "Are you happy here with me, Bella?"</p><p>"Yes." I smiled.</p><p>When I look into your eyes</p><p>It's like watching the night sky</p><p>Or a beautiful sunrise</p><p>Well, there's so much they hold</p><p>And just like them old stars</p><p>I see that you've come so far</p><p>To be right where you are</p><p>How old is your soul?</p><p>Severus smirked. "There is something of crucial significance I have been meaning to ask you..." He looked at me in apprehension. "I love you, Bella..." The Potions Master drew in a deep breath and blew it from his lungs loudly.</p><p>"Calm down..." I soothed. "You're far too anxious, Severus."</p><p>Well, I won't give up on us</p><p>Even if the skies get rough</p><p>I'm giving you all my love</p><p>I'm still looking up</p><p>Severus gave me a thin smile. "It has been six years. I have made many mistakes. However, you have always been there to guide me through the darkness. I would be greatly honored if you would be my wife."</p><p>I heard him inhale deeply into his lungs and exhale it quickly from them. All the while boring his obsidian orbs into me.</p><p>And when you're needing your space</p><p>To do some navigating</p><p>I'll be here patiently waiting</p><p>To see what you find</p><p>"I want to say yes, Severus." I said softly. "I don't know if we're ready yet for such a big step. I still have a year left at Hogwarts. And what if I have to leave you for the Ministry? I don't know that I want to be a professor yet."</p><p>Severus gave me a doleful look. "We could make this work, Bella. I can wait for you to graduate. I...I have never been as happy as when I am with you."</p><p>Cause even the stars they burn</p><p>Some even fall to the earth</p><p>We've got a lot to learn</p><p>God knows we're worth it</p><p>No, I won't give up</p><p>I could tell this wasn't easy for him.</p><p>"I know." I told him. "I want to be with you, too. But it's not that simple and it's not fair to you."</p><p>Severus sighed. "Do you love me as well, Bella?"</p><p>I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily</p><p>I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make</p><p>Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use</p><p>The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake</p><p>And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend</p><p>For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn</p><p>We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in</p><p>I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am</p><p>It wasn't easy for me to hear the sadness in his rich, baritone voice.</p><p>"Of course, I do." I assured him. "This is just a bit too fast for me."</p><p>I won't give up on us</p><p>Even if the skies get rough</p><p>I'm giving you all my love</p><p>I'm still looking up</p><p>I'm still looking up</p><p>Severus looked hurt. "Six years is too fast for you?" He stood up, walking over to the corner of the room.</p><p>A shaky breath was blown from his lungs.</p><p>"If you're trying to make me sorry, I am." I replied, coming up behind him and wrapping my arms around him. "Ok, you win. We'll wait a year and see how it goes. Stay engaged for the time being."</p><p>I won't give up on us</p><p>God knows I'm tough, he knows</p><p>We got a lot to learn</p><p>God knows we're worth it</p><p>Severus turned to face me. "Very well. You shall need this."</p><p>He handed me a silver and green box. Inside was a silver and emerald serpent engagement ring.</p><p>"Oh, Severus." I gushed. "It's beautiful."</p><p>"Not as beautiful as you." Severus replied. He pulled me into a fiery kiss.</p><p>I won't give up on us</p><p>Even if the skies get rough</p><p>I'm giving you all my love</p><p>I'm still looking up[?}</p></div>
