</p><p>Acheron appeared in Devon, the freezing wind blowing about him, but he ignored it in favour of the hunched form on the hill ahead of him. He hadn’t asked many questions when she had come to him, knowing he would sense what she had done, he should have known better than to trust her promise. She had promised not to make any more Dark Hunters and not even a century later she had broken that promise. All he could see of his newest Hunter was incredibly messy black hair and a hunched back…his shoulders were not very wide at all. He took a step and the younger male turned and Acheron was startled to see dark green eyes instead of the expected black.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you Acheron?” the boy asked, standing up…and he really was a boy.</p><p> </p><p>Acheron fought down the rage at Artemis for daring to make such a young Hunter. It was odd, she had a type and this young man definitely didn’t fit it. He wasn’t over six foot; in fact he was a bit under it, and on the scrawny side. “The sun will rise soon, we need to leave,” he offered, and the boy nodded, glancing back once before walking over to join him and Acheron looked at the valley, seeing the burnt remains of a building, likely a house.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry walked down the street; eyes peeled for his prey. The night streets were busy, full of tourists, which made the area prime hunting territory for Daimons. Sometimes he wondered how the magical world hadn’t known of them, or if they had, how they had kept it from the general population. Not that he could ask anyone, there was no government in Britain anymore and as far as the magical world was concerned, Harry Potter had been dead for two years. Harry Evans was his name now, he didn’t want the reminder of his old life, but he couldn’t totally cut his ties to the past like some did, taking on a single word as their name.</p><p> </p><p>It was the way it had to be, and he didn’t care. All the magical world had done was take everything he had ever loved. Even if he could, he would never go back. Besides, his life wasn’t bad, he was still fighting evil, just differently to how he’d been told at Hogwarts to do it. There were days, when the nightmares came, the people he had loved all condemning him for being a killer now. He killed to save human lives, yes he pitied the Apollites, to condemn them all for the actions of a few had been wrong, but so was turning Daimon. Everything he had learnt of the old gods made him sick, they were so petty. And he’d gone and sold his soul to one, what had he been thinking? Honestly? He hadn’t been. Once again his temper had gotten the best of him though at least he’d been the only one to pay the price.</p><p> </p><p>He’d been in Rome for six months now and he had adjusted to the city, though it wasn’t home. He doubted anywhere would be home ever again. He’d gotten used to having friends, people he could turn to, while at Hogwarts, but he’d spent his childhood isolate and alone, so it wasn’t hard to get used to that again. He had refused a Squire, not wanting to have the responsibility or risk of having someone so close. He was used to taking care of himself.</p><p> </p><p>He had one advantage over his brethren, like Acheron he couldn’t be possessed by spirits or souls or anything. in a city as old as Rome, that really came in handy. He had to admit, he liked the shocked loo on Daimons faces when he followed them into cemeteries and catacombs. He may not have been given powers like others were, but it didn’t bother him when he had his own.</p><p> </p><p>He glanced at his palm pilot and the tracking program on it. Apparently, he went through more than any other hunter, but it wasn’t his fault his magic didn’t play nice with them. this one hadn’t died yet, so he thought that maybe he had finally gotten the hang of shielding it from his magic, hopefully. It was his only connection to the outside world, outside of the phone whose number only two people knew; Acheron and the head Squire in Rome. He had no computer, no TV, nothing, he preferred it that way.</p><p> </p><p>He smirked when he spotted three Daimons nearby. He had to admit, the program was handy, picking up the traces of the Daimons' elevated neuron activity that came from their psychic abilities. Time to get to work.</p><p> </p><p>Harry found them with two tourists trapped in an alley, drawing the throwing knives Ash had trained him to use, lining them up before letting them fly, taking out two of the Daimons before they even knew he was there. The third spun to face him, smirking when it got a look and Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. Even after training with Acheron he was still barely five foot eleven and rather slender. He just didn’t have the body type that would bulk up with muscle, he was a Seeker after all. It made things harder, Daimons just didn’t find him intimidating at all. No one really had his whole life, except those who feared the legend and popularity of the Boy-Who-Lived. He drew the short sword he carried under his coat and the Daimon hesitated. Harry lunged in, ducking under the clumsy grab and drove the blade into its heart, freeing the souls it had consumed and turning it to so much dust.</p><p> </p><p>“How….” The male tourist choked out in shock.</p><p> </p><p>“Obliviate,” Harry whispered, wiping their memories and sending them on their way to their hotel.</p><p> </p><p>Once sure they were safe he got back to his patrol.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry sat on his balcony, stargazing as he sipped at his hot chocolate. He had a top floor apartment in a nice historic building with a very good view. Even without the outrageous pay Artemis delivered every month, he had a lot of money. He’d had the presence of mind to raid Gringotts after everything and there had been a lot of precious metals and jewels there. He owned the whole building and rented the other apartments out to those in need, not caring about making money from the rent.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing the dawn approaching he moved inside and locked the doors behind him, closing the light proof shutters even as a flick of his hand lit the candles. He made sure the apartment was secure and then settled in to read for a while before heading to bed. It hurt to lie there alone, to not have the other side occupied. Not that anyone had ever known, as much as the Weasley’s had loved him, they would have killed him if they’d known Ginny had shared a bed with him a few times once they were engaged. They’d never gotten the chance to exchange their vows, for a honeymoon, any of it. Those few nights were all he had, not that they’d done more than just sleep, they had wanted to wait for the wedding night but had needed comfort after the war ended.</p><p> </p><p>He tossed and turned for a few hours before finally falling into a fitful sleep.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry pulled out his phone as it rang, pressing it to his ear as he walked down the street. “Hi Ash,” he greeted as he dodged a group of rowdy tourists.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, I’m sending a Squire over to your place with some equipment.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s time you had a computer little brother,” Ash sounded far too cheerful about that for him.</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to have a computer? The guy who kills a palm pilot a month?” he demanded in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>Ash responded by chuckling. “The handbook is fine for standard information, but you should be checking immediate updates and the message boards.</p><p> </p><p>“Ash…” he didn’t want to know the others; he didn’t want to make friends. Acheron was different, he was his boss yes, but…he called him little brother and Harry couldn’t help feeling good about that, wanting to have someone he could trust, to talk to. “Okay…but don’t blame me when it blows up or something.”</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry glanced at the note and then slowly followed the directions, typing in his username and password, watching as the website came up. So far, so good. He watched as messages appeared, other hunters talking together, comparing the fights of their night, complaining, just blowing off steam. He moved away from the busy boards, finding games that he had no clue about, smaller chats…it was overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>He found a group with only two members and hesitated, torn. He took a deep breath and typed. ‘Hi.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Hi,’ the answer came back after a minute. ‘Who’s this?’</p><p> </p><p>‘Harry,’</p><p> </p><p>‘Sundown. Mr Silent is Zarek. Heard we had a new DH. Where are you stationed?’</p><p> </p><p>‘Rome, you?’</p><p> </p><p>“Reno.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Alaska,’ Zarek answered for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>He could do this. He could talk to them online and it would be fine.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry sat on the roof, watching the fireworks as the world celebrated the beginning of the new millennia. He watched for a few more minutes before standing and stepping off the roof and dropping down to the alley before walking out into the crowds, it was perfect Daimon hunting tonight with all the drunken revellers.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry frowned as he read Zarek’s message about baking. Little comments the older hunter made when put together did not paint a pretty picture. He’d done some research on Alaska as well, and he couldn’t imagine being posted there for a year let alone centuries. How did he survive the summers when he couldn’t leave his home? He was totally alone up there, and it was cruel.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had also seen the comments and warnings about Zarek, but he had ignored them. He didn’t know what had happened, but the man he talked with was not an insane killer. He didn’t believe Zarek had slaughtered a village he had watched over for years. If he’d done that, he would have been more than exiled which meant something else was going on there, he just didn’t know what. At least Zarek had Jess and now him to talk to now.</p><p> </p><p>Harry just wanted to do more for him which was why he was finishing packing up the box, putting Zarek’s mailing address on it, getting that had not been easy. Inside the box were simple household objects, all heavily enchanted. Blankets and coats to keep him warm in the winter, rune engraved stones to keep his food from freezing, others to cool set areas down in the summer, and a letter with instructions.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Zarek opened his door to find Sharon had made a delivery earlier. Along with some magazines was a box and when he checked it he found it had been sent from Rome, the senders initials were H.E….Harry Evans. He quickly brought everything inside and cautiously opened the box, finding a letter on top. He read it, eyes narrowed in confusion, and then pulled out the stones for cooling. He set them around the room and saw the engraved marking glow briefly, the temperature dropping a good twenty degrees. Why would he do this for him?</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry picked up his phone, silencing the ringtone. “Acheron?”</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, how are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Harry answered, lunging to save his toast from burning. “What can I do for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being transferred,” his boss answered.</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked, wait…what? “Pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“One of the hunters in New Orleans got his soul back, Kyrian of Thrace. You’re taking his place.”</p><p> </p><p>“America?” Harry asked in surprise. “Alright, when do I leave?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be picked up in three days and flown over in one of the modified helicopters.”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood, what about lodgings?”</p><p> </p><p>“A temporary place will be arranged unless you want to give a list of what you prefer, and something can be purchased ahead of time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Temporary is fine. I’ll be ready.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good hunting little brother,” Ash offered, and Harry smiled slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Ash?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why me? I haven’t even been here five years.”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you are the only safe option. It was originally going to be Valerius,” he explained, and Harry winced. He’d read the handbook, so he knew who Kyrian and Valerius were, and their link, that would not end well.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>“Understood, who else is stationed there?” Harry answered him and Ash smiled slightly at how quickly Harry caught on, he was young, but he was very bright. He had enjoyed training Harry, though it hadn’t been easy, he had no previous training. He was quick on his feet though and didn’t quit, no matter how many times he was knocked down. Ash knew little of Harry’s past, just that he’d been orphaned as a toddler and raised by his aunt and uncle, that he’d been engaged despite his young age. He’d lost her and everyone else before being killed himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Talon. When Mardi Gras comes you’ll receive temporary backup as well,” he explained. He wouldn’t mention how hard it had been to convince Artemis to assign Harry rather than Valerius to New Orleans. He thought the younger male would like the city; he could even attend university there, online anyway. Harry was too isolated; he didn’t communicate with anyone except Ash by phone, Sundown and Zarek online. He knew that technically he should have stopped that, but he was happy that they had reached out to Zarek and that the ex-slave hadn’t pushed them away.</p><p> </p><p>Artemis had refused to tell him why Harry hadn’t been given any powers, the only others she did that with were the Romans and a very few others who she didn’t like. Then again, Harry seemed to have his own powers, unlike any he had seen before. He had asked but when Harry clamed up he hadn’t pushed.  Without those powers he would be stationing the teen somewhere Daimons never went for his own safety since he couldn’t beat them with brute strength or skill like his older brethren. He wondered how Talon would react to Harry and he hoped the two would become friends since they would be stationed there together permanently.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you be ready by then?” he asked, and Harry chuckled.</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, I’ll see you when you arrive,” Ash hung up and sent a message to Nick to arrange temporary accommodation for Harry. Maybe he could convince Harry to take Nick on as his Squire, if they got along. Nick was only two years younger than Harry and that may make things interesting.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry packed the last of his belongings and looked around his apartment. He put the keys in an envelope which he pocketed before heading out for one last patrol which ended at the Squire HQ where he slipped the envelope into the mail slot. Whoever was assigned in his place could use the apartment or the Squires could if they needed it for something, but the building would remain in his name.</p><p> </p><p>He’d never been to America and he was sort of looking forward to it. He’d heard of New Orleans, and he’d borrowed some library books on it after Ash’s call, it had a very rich history. He was also looking forward to seeing Ash again, he hadn’t seen him since his training had ended and he was posted to Rome. He was stern but also patient and kind. Learning to fight had been hell but Ash had always patched him up after, had never hurt him for the sake of it. He’d taught him so much and Harry felt a bit bad over the secrets he kept, Ash kept a lot too, but Harry knew some of them, not that he’d admitted it. He would keep Ash’s secrets, they weren’t his to tell, and he only knew them because of how becoming a Dark Hunter had affected his magic.</p><p> </p><p>He shrank most of his things, taking a single bag with him as he headed out to the helipad where the Squire flown helicopter was waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry?” the man waiting asked and he nodded. “I’m Alex, your pilot for the trip. We’ll be landing just after sunset in New Orleans. It’s an almost fourteen hour flight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Will it be dark enough to have the windows clear? I’ve never flown over so far before.”</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>“We can for a few hours,” Alex agreed, still shocked by how young the Dark Hunter appeared. He’d read the update when he joined, knew the Harry Evans was the youngest physically as well as being the newest. It was still a shock to be confronted with a teenager. That could make life difficult for him in some situations. His entry was tiny, born  July 31<sup>st</sup> 1980, in England, date of death December 26<sup>th</sup> 1997. No mention of how he died or why he became a Dark Hunter, which was odd. He opened the compartment and Harry climbed in, Alex showing him how to strap himself in for safety and then he went to the cockpit to start it up. Fourteen hours was a long flight but at least he had the autopilot so he could nap on and off.</p><p> </p><p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</p><p>Harry looked out of the windows as the sea passed by miles beneath them. He loved the enhanced vision being a Dark Hunter gave him, he’d never need glasses again and he could see better in the dark than he ever could have dreamed of. Would have made Quidditch so much better. He was becoming excited for seeing America, though he was also worried. The MACUSA was very much a presence and a threat should they realise he was still ‘alive’. Places like New Orleans were as much magical tourist sites as non-magical. Should he have warned Ash that there may be people there who could recognise him? Would anyone? He may not have aged, but he had changed since his Hogwarts days, he’d filled out at least a bit and his hair was longer, helping get rid of some of the Potter messiness, not to mention the infamous scar was gone and his eyes were no longer the same shade of green as his Mother’s. That would hopefully be enough. Not like he had a wand they could trace.</p><p> </p><p>He hit the switch to darken the windows and settled in to meditate, the last thing they needed was him bringing the helicopter down accidentally with a nightmare if he fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>
