</p><p>The year is 2010. Summer is approaching. The air is floral. Insects flit about and tourism is booming just west of Geirangerfjord. Resorts overlook massive waterfalls and the mountains were breathtaking in every direction. Sharply dressed men and women chatter among one another on the suspended deck of a towering hotel, speaking of the news, the fashion, and the scandals that all seemed the epicenter of their own universes. Not a single one of the crowd is aware of the struggle going on below.</p><p> </p><p>A slender blonde was narrowly avoiding being mauled by a chimera-like creature. One might think it some manner of grotesque lion, however the proud mane around the creature’s neck seemed made of steel spikes, and the flowers wilted under it’s breathe. Unbeknownst to those above, this was known as a Nundu. It’s very presence in Norway would have the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures all aflutter.</p><p> </p><p>You see, a Nundu is native only to East Africa, and is not known to swim, fly, or apparate. The Nundu’s breath is fatal, and the Nundu itself is incredibly aggressive. Seasoned magizoologists across the world wouldn’t risk attempting to corral one with a specialized team, let alone solo.</p><p> </p><p>Yet, this was no ordinary magizoologist.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, I am terribly sorry to have disturbed you, I simply speculated you might perhaps be lonely or hungry or a fair bit lost, and I reckoned I’d help you center yourself.” Chirped the creature’s believed opponent as she readjusted the muddy bonnet upon her platinum locks.</p><p> </p><p>As melodic as the woman’s voice was, it was hardly a comfort to the displaced legend. Without a sound, the creature began to readjust it’s footing, clearly preparing to pounce. The most profound sign of intelligence in the lion-esqe creature was it’s silence. Nundu’s lacked a war cry, proving fatal to those that relied on their ears to warn them of danger. Whilst facing off against a Nundu, a witch or wizard’s only chance at success was to read body language. Luckily, for the sake of our story anyways, our heroine’s insight was extraordinary.  </p><p> </p><p>The slim figure in question sighed sadly, as one might when a dear friend fails to respond via post once again. She pulled a slim stick of oak from behind her ear. With a few murmured words, the Nundu was restrained, a portkey fixed to it’s mane, and the creature sent spiraling through the ether to the Ministry’s secure holding.</p><p> </p><p>Pale eyes fix on the ground, disheartened. She twirls the wand expertly between her fingers, a series of spells ridding her attire of the mud. And there stood Luna Lovegood, the strangest of the six that saved the world a decade before. The event was doubly a failure. Rumors of a strange beast stalking the Norwegian countryside has drawn her out of her seclusion in Ottery St. Catchpole. All the same, it had proven to be merely a common creature in an unexpected place. And Luna hadn’t even managed to make friends with the confused cub. Because, ultimately, that’s what it had been. The Nundu had been half the size it was meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>As she contemplated her next move, the voices of the none-the-wiser muggles floated down to Luna’s ears. “Oh, it was quite the...<em>rare</em> specimen. Certainly worth the price of the experience. I can’t say I’d do it again, but I do think it was the perfect pre-wedding trip.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a gasp and a giggle from, presumably, the tourist’s companion. It seemed a pair of women were recounting their experiences in Norway as of late. “Where are they keeping him?” The companion inquired.</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, Julia, don’t refer to<em> it</em> as ‘him’. It makes me feel dirty. But if you <em>must</em> know, it’s up in the hills two valleys over. The area is very secluded and I’m glad for it. I like a little privacy in my… <em>zoo</em> experiences.” The muggle woman choked on her own laugh, half embarrassed for whatever reason.</p><p> </p><p>Luna was listening intently, recounting the landscape and paths. A specimen? Did they have some new species of creature imprisoned? That simply wouldn’t do. All beings deserved freedom. It half killed her spirit to send those she couldn’t tame back to the Ministry to be retrained.</p><p> </p><p>The years had passed, but little had changed in Luna. She was still bright, empathetic, and incredibly odd. Above all, she was still very, very kind.</p><p> </p><p>If there was a mystery being poked fun of in those hills, she would find it.</p><p> </p><p> And she would free it.</p>
