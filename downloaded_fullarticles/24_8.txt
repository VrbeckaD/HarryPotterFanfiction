          <div class="userstuff"><p>All our memories are tainted, not a single one is pure<br/>Each remark was bit by hatred, when to love had been the cure<br/>Hatred, prejudice and envy always clouded up my mind<br/>Had I ever stopped to listen, maybe then you'd have been kind</p>
<p>But now, given our history, I guess it's too much to ask<br/>So each day I face you, hate you, each day put on my mask<br/>I should consider myself lucky that you are rather dense<br/>It's obvious to everyone with simple common sense<br/>What a disgrace, I must admit, for me to fall for you<br/>A lie I must believe, I don't, but what else can I do?</p></div>
