          <div class="userstuff"><ul>
<li>There’s a saucer on the counter but no cup to be found</li>
<li>She stares at it with its stained rings from spills and leaks over the months they’ve had it</li>
<li>She can’t bring herself to get rid of it</li>
<li>Can barely bring herself to move near it</li>
<li>Her feet feel glued to the floor</li>
<li>Her limbs are heavy</li>
<li>Have been heavy </li>
<li>So she just stares and lets her mind wander to days better than this</li>
<li>Days where she actually felt awake </li>
<li>And alive</li>
<li>And not wrapped up in the dark veil that had plastered itself to her skin</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<em>The last time she touched that saucer I had placed it there</em>, she thinks</li>
<li>It had been weeks since that moment</li>
<li>Since her voice seemed so soft, so casual</li>
<li><em>‘Your tea is ready’</em></li>
<li>It had been weeks since she said that </li>
<li><em>Do I even have a voice anymore?</em></li>
<li>She wasn’t sure</li>
<li>She hadn’t used it since she lost it</li>
<li>Since her screaming had left her throat raw and hoarse</li>
<li>She felt no need for it now</li>
<li>She couldn’t bear to take up all the air in the last space <b><em>she </em></b>had been</li>
<li>There had to be remnants of her left here</li>
<li>In <b>their </b>house</li>
<li>In what was supposed to be <b>their</b> <b>home</b>
</li>
<li>And she wanted the pieces of her that drifted through here to stay as long as possible</li>
<li>Because the smell in her pillow had gone</li>
<li>And half of her sweaters were losing the rose of her skin </li>
<li>And the light that seemed to radiate in each room had dimmed</li>
<li>Like the house missed her</li>
<li>Almost as much as Marlene did… <em>almost</em>
</li>
<li>She had been trying to run herself ragged</li>
<li>She tried drinking but the taste reminded her of school</li>
<li>Of the first time they had kissed</li>
<li>Of the way her lips peppered the column of her throat</li>
<li>She tried sleeping draughts </li>
<li>But the dreams of her face were more vivid, more colourful, <em>more red</em>
</li>
<li>She woke up screaming with nothing but blood and curses and hollow cheeks in her memory</li>
<li>So she stood and stared and thought of things like tea stains and the tears in the couch cushions from when they moved in</li>
<li>But now</li>
<li>Now even those brought her fragile heart to break </li>
<li>That was the last time they had kissed</li>
<li>The last time she had said <b>I love you</b>
</li>
<li>Right before a night raid</li>
<li>On a night just like any other </li>
<li>Giddy and foolish and butterflies in her stomach</li>
<li>She tried to wipe her lipstick off Dorcas’ mouth</li>
<li>But Dorcas had gripped her hand and whirled her in close</li>
<li>‘<em>Leave it, it reminds me of you</em>’</li>
<li>One more kiss</li>
<li>Barely anything to remember</li>
<li>Something she had done so many times it was going gray in her head</li>
<li>But now she clung to it</li>
<li>The way her hand had comfortably rested on her waist</li>
<li>The way she could see the reflection of herself in Dorcas’ eyes</li>
<li>Not five hours later she was opening their door, wand blazing, fear in her eyes</li>
<li>
<em>Something’s wrong</em>, Lily had barely been able to say</li>
<li><em>He was there</em></li>
<li>She had escaped the battle with cuts on her cheeks and bruises on her ribs and pieces of curses oozing from her skin</li>
<li>Nothing more, nothing less</li>
<li>But when the door slammed open and struck the wall beside her</li>
<li>When she entered their home she found Sirius</li>
<li>Tears streaming down his cheeks</li>
<li>On his knees, in her living room</li>
<li><em>‘I’m so sorry</em></li>
<li><em>I’m so sorry</em></li>
<li>The memory of that moment is vague now</li>
<li>The shock trapping her mind in the world before this moment</li>
<li>In the world of tea cups and lipstick and the sweet smell of honey that are Dorcas</li>
<li><em>That <b>were </b>Dorcas</em></li>
<li>Lily tells her she spent the whole night screaming</li>
<li>And she thinks that’s why her throat hasn’t felt the same since</li>
<li>Why her knees are still sore, and her elbows are still sore</li>
<li>She had curled up against the hard wood begging to wake up</li>
<li><em>‘Just have some tea love’</em></li>
<li>Dorcas would have said</li>
<li><em>‘You’ll feel better’</em></li>
<li>But tea won’t give her amnesia</li>
<li>Won’t pick her heart up from where it shattered all over their floors that day</li>
<li>Tea won’t take the weight off her shoulders, off her mind</li>
<li>Won’t stop Marlene from thinking of the body, <em>her body</em>
</li>
<li>Of how it was heavier than she remembered when they brought it home</li>
<li>Shrouded in the white cloths that lined the cupboards of the House of Black</li>
<li>
<em>Like a goddes</em>s, they had said</li>
<li><em>More like a ghost</em></li>
<li>But Marlene held her close</li>
<li>Cold fingers pressed against her cheek</li>
<li>‘<em>Wait for me</em>’</li>
<li>One last kiss on a cold, sharp cheek bone</li>
<li>And then she rescinded herself to a world without colour</li>
<li>Without shine</li>
<li><em>‘I should never have let you go’</em></li>
<li>Being in the house makes her ill now</li>
<li>Memories of their life tainted by death and cruelty and hate</li>
<li>The house is no longer the place Marlene thinks of as home</li>
<li>No longer a kitchen where they were meant to cook</li>
<li>Where she would drag her kisses along Dorcas’ neck just to hear her soft laughter</li>
<li>No longer a bathroom where the mirrors should be steamy</li>
<li>Where the bath was filled with flower petals after a long day</li>
<li>A place where Dorcas ranted about the silliness of her day when she was brushing her teeth</li>
<li>So Marlene sits outside</li>
<li>On the small stone bench next to the wilted flowers</li>
<li><em><b>The sky is too blue, the grass is too green, the sun is too bright for you not to be here</b></em></li>
<li>
<em>You would love today</em>, she thinks</li>
<li><em>You would have loved today</em></li>
<li>But now its just another day</li>
<li>Just another month</li>
<li>Just another year</li>
<li>And there’s a war to be won</li>
<li>An evil to be overcome</li>
<li>But, for a little while, Marlene thinks, the darkness has taken root inside her</li>
<li>And, for a little while, that’s where it has to stay</li>
