    <p>It was a winter morning in New York. The city was busy with people going on with their daily lives and in a small house not far from downtown Violet Glass was preparing for her day for this was going to be an important day for her. <br/> She had worked hard to get this far in her life to become an auror just like her father had been. Now she can finally join the ranks and go after dark wizards like Grindlewald. <br/> The Glass family weren't a powerful wealthy wizarding family but her parents had been happy from what she saw anyway but her older brother was a mystery to her.<br/> She had been pampered by her father growing up after their mother died from dragon pox before she went to Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>But her father had planned for her to marry into a wealthy wizarding family as a political alliance in order for the Glass family to make a name for themselves.<br/> But she rebelled that idea with everything she had and thanks to Tina Goldstein who knew her father by association made it happen for her to become an auror.<br/>  Her brother Eric was already an accomplished auror and he was on Tina's team. He loved his sister like she loved him but she doesn't understand why they aren't close like the Goldstein sisters. <br/> She snapped out of her daydream when she became aware she was staring at the article about her father Conrad Glass who was killed an year ago by Grindlewald himself while he was in Europe.<br/>  He had been a respected auror at Macusa and everyone mourned him. <br/> She rushed out of the door and made her way to Macusa. <br/> She knew her brother was already busy since they were moving Grindlewald today to Europe to answer for his crimes. <br/> She soon arrived at Macusa and was greeted by some fellow witches. It wasn't long until Abernathy approached her "Violet I'm on my way to the prison and since I was responsible for you during your training I thought that you might want to join me." <br/> Violet had a bad feeling overcome her as he seemed off today but she decided to ignore it for now. "I will be happy to help you sir." <br/> Abernathy nodded "Madame President is already there and we are running late so we better get going." <br/> They made their way from Headquarters and head to the prison of Macusa.<br/>  At that moment Erik and Madame President were already there for the prime minister was personally escorting Grindlewald himself. "We had to cut out his tongue for he is a silver tongue we had to change his guard twice." <br/> Madame President told the prime minister. <br/> Abernathy and Violet arrived and Abernathy checked the spells himself "He's ready for transport."<br/>  Violet saw her brother "Be careful." She still felt like something was going to happen and Erik was one of the escorts for the dark lord.<br/>Eric nodded at his sister. “Of course, and good luck on your first day, Violet.” Violet bit her lip and resisted the urge to hug her brother. It would break the seriousness of the moment and they were at work after all. <br/>Eric could tell his sister was holding back and he smiled just a bit. “Let’s meet up after you’re through? We can celebrate,” he added after a beat.</p><p> </p><p>Before Violet could answer the prime minister was ready to go. “Hurry up, Glass we need to transport the prisoner,” Madame President urged. </p><p> </p><p>“Right, Ma’am.” Eric lifted his hat to Violet as he climbed into the carriage and it flew off into the air. </p><p> </p><p>Violet sighed and turned away ready to begin the rest of her day. “Alright Abernathy, Sir. I’m ready to get started.” She was met with silence. Violet blinked. “Abernathy…?” She spun in a circle but the man was no where to be found. Could he have headed back without her?</p><p> </p><p>Then suddenly a blast erupted from the carriage that her brother had just taken off in. </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Eric Glass couldn’t believe his eyes as the guise of Grindelwald melted away to reveal Abernathy bound instead of the dark wizard.<br/> It was a split second and suddenly his own wand was pointed at his throat and then dissolved as well as his fellow aurors. <br/>The prime minister scrambled to get to Grindelwald’s wand in the case he held, but alas it held a spiny little beast instead and quite nasty as it set to attacking him. <br/>Then they were sent down into the water, the compartment filled with water threatening to drown them. It was a free for all, until Grindelwald finally appeared inside the carriage, breaking the glass and sending everyone but the Prime Minister and Eric flying out into the clouds.</p><p> </p><p>As Eric struggled to regain his breath, he watched the prime minister struggled with the creature clamped down hard on his throat. </p><p> </p><p>“You have joined a noble cause, my friend,” Grindelwald spoke to Abernathy as he took the strange sliver necklace from his mouth and regrew his tongue.<br/> Grindelwald then took the creature from the prime minister’s neck and petted it before throwing it out the window. <br/>The next was the prime minister but Eric found his strength in adrenaline then, he charged at Grindelwald and nearly tackled him to the side, but Abernathy punched him in the jaw and sent him sprawling to the ground. <br/>Eric’s vision blurred just as the Prime Minister was dropped from the carriage mid air.</p><p> </p><p>“How dare you touch, Grindelwald! Piece of trash!” Abernathy growled and proceeded to lift his wand, a green glow began to emanate from it and Eric knew his time was about to run out. He used his last ounce of strength to spit in Abernathy’s face and kick him in the groin.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” came Grindelwald’s order. Abernathy gave Eric a murderous look, but instantly dropped his wand. The dark wizard came to Eric and grabbed his face in a tight grip so hard that his nails dug in.<br/> Eric glared back at the mismatched eyes of Grindelwald defiantly and the dark wizard smirked. “Such pain and hatred I see in you, come to my side and I would give you all the means to prove yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would rather die,” Eric spat but Grindelwald just chuckled as he drug Eric to the open door of the carriage and held him out. The wind felt like blades scraping across his face.</p><p> </p><p>“I sense we will meet again, in that time think for yourself what Macusa’s love of rules and expectations have really given you. Join my cause and be free to choose a future for yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Then Eric was sent into a freefall and everything turned dark around him as his consciousness slipped.<br/>The prime minister instantly saved Eric's life and he knew now that Grindlewald just escaped. <br/> He had to get this auror back to Macusa and tell Madame President what happened. <br/> He apparated both of them to Macusa which he yelled for help as he helped Eric inside. <br/> Madame President came up with Tina than and Tina helped the Prime Minister take Eric to her office. <br/> Before Madame President could asked what had happened the Prime Minister spoke up "Grindlewald switched by using polyjuice and Abernathy was in on it."<br/>  Tina shocked for Violet had just finished her auror training under him and she couldn't help but feel responsible for teaming them up now. "Madame President I want the mission to bring back Grindlewald." <br/> Eric was coming to at the moment "I want part of the team that captures him."<br/>  Madame President "Goldstein I'm not sure you are fit for this mission you to Glass."<br/>  Eric 's tone turned serious "With all due respect Madame President we are the perfect team for the mission. Tina had already encountered Grindlewald once and we will bring him to justice." <br/> Tina actually had another reason to go to Europe for Queenie had left after their fight and took Jacob with her. <br/> She needed to track them down and also her guilt over Credence was eating away at her conscience. <br/> Madame President thought it over than came to a decision. "We need Grindlewald brought down and if he continues his mission there will be war with the non majs. You two will leave for Europe immediately." <br/> Tina and Eric both felt this was personal for both of them. "Yes Madame President." <br/> They turned to the Prime Minister "I will grant both of you access to my country's resources and aid." Eric and Tina thanked him than they left Macusa with a new mission and on their way to Europe. <br/> Later on Violet returned to Macusa not knowing what took place and was looking for her brother. <br/> She made her way to Madame President's office "Excuse the interruption Madame President but I was looking for my brother." <br/> Madame President glanced up from her paperwork "They are on a mission and you are just a junior auror Violet." <br/> Violet looked up to her brother and he didn't say that he was on another mission and it was normal for him to leave word on his whereabouts. "<br/> Madame President I passed the test and I am ready to join the ranks. I have every reason to go after Grindlewald like my brother does." <br/> Madame President met her gaze "I mourn your father Violet just like everyone here but your brother is an auror and I have one of my best with him." <br/> Violet sighed a little for this meant a lot to her "Yes Madame President." She left the office and she had a plan to leave the country for she will prove herself. <br/> Her family had some money and she will use a port key to go to Ministry of Magic in London to start there.<br/>  It was late when she finally arrived in London, England and she felt tired but she had to find her brother and Tina. <br/> Soon she saw an unusual creature go by her and a red head approaching her location. She got her wand ready just in case she needed to use it to defend herself. <br/> Than she heard a spell "Accio."<br/>  The creature lifted in the air and she felt her heart race as footsteps approached her. "Hello I'm Newt Scamander."<br/>  He noticed her wand in her hand and met her gaze "I'm Violet Glass an American Auror." <br/> Newt gave her a warm smile "I will not harm you." She had a feeling that she could trust him. <br/> He saw she needed rest and food. "Follow me."<br/>  She didn't know why but she did and soon they arrived at a house. <br/> He did a spell and walked inside. She felt on edge but she was tired from her journey and hungry. <br/> He offered her a seat and did a spell to make tea and put some fruit in front of her. "Sorry." <br/> He felt like he should really take care of himself better. She grabbed some fruit and ate it than took a sip of her tea. Newt than spoke up "Why are you in London?" He asked. <br/> Violet whispered "I'm here looking for my brother and I need help from the Ministry of Magic." <br/> Newt knew that Theseus was Head Auror at the Ministry and might be able to help her. "In the morning we will go to the Ministry of Magic together. I know someone who can help you. I also have to go there for business."<br/>  Violet than understood this was no ordinary wizard who was helping her. "Why are you helping me?" <br/> Newt could see something inside of her that reminded him of Tina. "You remind me of someone I met and I never turn down anyone who needs my help."<br/>  Newt gave her a smile which she was glad she met a potential ally. "You can sleep in the guest bedroom if you need anything my assistant Bunty will be happy to help." <br/> Violet thanked him and went to the guest bedroom. She hit the bed and was out. <br/> Newt meanwhile went down to feed his creatures and told Bunty about Violet his guest when all of the sudden there was noise coming from upstairs. He told Bunty to check on Violet than go home.<br/>  Within minutes he was upstairs there stood Queenie and Jacob. "Newt." <br/> Newt was shocked "You were supposed to be obviated." He told Jacob. He only hoped that the noise didn't wake up his guest. <br/> Jacob laughed "I had no bad memories and Queenie filled me in on the rest." <br/> Newt ran to the door "Tina."<br/>  Queenie turned to him "It's just us, just me and and Jacob. How about I make us some dinner?" Newt had a weird feeling that Jacob wasn't acting like himself.</p><p>“By the way, congratulations on your engagement, honey,” Queenie continued happily. Newt paused.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry?” He really had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p> </p><p>“We saw it in the paper, to Leta Lestrange, right?” She prompted. Sudden realization dawned on Newt.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, that’s my brother’s engagement, not me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh dear,” Queenie frowned, “Tina was pretty upset when she found out and she’s started dating someone else, oopsie.”</p><p>Newt gave Queenie a look, but she just smiled and began waving her wand and making them all food. </p><p> </p><p>“Newt, pal, we’re getting married!” Jacob burst out suddenly, giggling. Newt gave his friend an awkward smile but the thought that crossed his mind was: ‘You’ve enchanted him.’</p><p> </p><p>Queenie faltered in her magic. “I have done no such thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then you won’t mind if I-” Before Newt could finish his sentence Queen dropped everything to shield Jacob from his spell. “Now Queenie there’s nothing to fear if Jacob really wants to get married.”</p><p>She stepped aside and Newt broke the spell. “Surgito!”</p><p>“Where am I?” Jacob asked looking dumbstruck.</p><p> </p><p>“In London, congrats on your engagement by the way,” Newt answered for him. </p><p> </p><p>“My what-?” It suddenly settled on Jacob like a bomb. He looked right at Queenie, furious. “Queenie when were you going to wake me up? After we had five kids!?” He demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“Well one of us had to be brave, I don’t see why me loving you is wrong!” Queenie shouted back as she stormed out of the house. Jacob gave chase and the door banged on it’s hinges as they disappeared outside. <br/>Newt had sinking feeling in his chest but what Queenie had done was definitely not right. He had no choice but to break the enchantment.</p><p> </p><p>“Is everything okay, Newt?” Came a wary voice from the direction of the stairs. He turned to see Violet there looking ruffled from sleep or lack there of.</p><p>“So if I woke you Violet, I’ve some rather unexpected visitors. Friends from America,” he told her. “They’ve had a bit of a disagreement.”</p><p> </p><p>Just as soon as he’d left, Jacob came back in, looking upset. “Boy I’ll say, I’ve got to go after her,” he said but then his eyes fell on Violet and his eyebrows climbed towards the ceiling. “Hey pal, did we come at a bad time? Didn’t know you had...company.”</p><p> </p><p>Both Newt and Violet turned a bit red at the implication.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no this is my friend Violet, she’s an American auror looking for her brother,” Newt quickly corrected him. </p><p> </p><p>“I just needed a place to stay since I came on short notice, by the way,” Violet was eager to change the subject, “I couldn’t help but overhearing, did you mean Tina Goldstein? That’s the auror my brother’s working with. If you want we should check the Ministry of Magic in Paris—that’s where they should be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah yes, exactly—the postcard Queenie dropped says so too,” Newt exclaimed. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, looks like we’re going to Paris!” Jacob said thankful to have some lead on seeing Queenie again.<br/>In Paris Tina and Eric just arrived at the Circus for they had a lead on the obscurial Credence of being there. <br/> But things turned quickly on them when the animals were set free and they lost the boy. <br/> Tina asked where Credence was going and all the answer they got was he was looking for his mother. <br/> They were also met by Yusuf a wizard who promised Tina and Eric some help.<br/>  Eric didn't like this at all for this felt like a trap laid by Grindlewald. "I don't feel like we are in control here." He spoke up.<br/>  Tina understood where he was coming from for he just barely escaped Grindlewald with his life. "We just need to keep our heads on the mission." <br/> Eric couldn't help but feel like this mission might be their last and he didn't even tell his sister where he went. <br/>He almost felt regret for not being a better brother but his own demons about his birth and life were his own and he had to protect Violet from them at all cost. Her life and happiness only mattered even if he acted cold at times. <br/> Tina turned to him "I'm sorry for putting your sister in danger Eric. If I would had known about Abernathy I would had trained her myself." <br/> Eric knew Tina carried the guilt now "Tina listen you didn't know and I didn't know. I'm her brother I should of known something was off about him. It's my duty to protect her after all. But she's alive and as long as Grindlewald stays away from her by us capturing him again than I will rest easy at night. It wasn't your fault and neither is what had happened with Queenie." <br/> Tina nodded and gave him a small smile "Thank you." They continued their hunt. <br/> At the same time Newt, Jacob and Violet arrived in Paris. It was now morning and Violet was hungry and quickly summoned her and the boys some food.<br/>  Newt just shook his head when she gave him a grin. They ate as they walked and Violet spoke up "What is the plan?" <br/> Newt turned to her "Jacob you can't come inside the ministry but you can keep an eye out for us and Tina out here if she shows up asking for Queenie. There is a park nearby and we won't be long I promise." Jacob nodded for no one would suspect a muggle being in a park after all. <br/> Newt and Violet arrived at the entrance which Newt quickly did polyjuice potion. <br/> Violet curious "Who is that?"<br/>  Newt sighed "He's my brother Theseus and he's a hugger." She only hoped that her brother and Tina had stopped by the ministry here in Paris. <br/> They entered and all of the sudden they hear someone yelling "Newt." <br/> Violet turned to see another red head "Is that him?"<br/>  Newt "Yes we have a difficult relationship." <br/> Theseus yelled "Enough." Newt at this point had turned back to normal and they both stopped his spell by deflecting the boxes.<br/>  Newt grinned and he could tell his brother was not happy for his face being used "Hello Newt." <br/> Newt didn't meet his gaze "Hello Theseus we came to talk to you. This is Violet Glass and she's an American Auror. Please Theseus we need your help." <br/> Newt than met his gaze and Violet could see the love and a hint of concern in Theseus's eyes and she felt a hint of jealously and sadness. <br/> Newt concerned "Violet are you alright?" <br/>She nodded "I'm fine."<br/>  Theseus sighed "If I have to pull you out of trouble again Newt.." <br/> Newt smirked "Not this time Theseus." <br/> Violet spoke up "Is there a place we can talk?" She asked Theseus. <br/> The older brother nodded slightly "Follow me I know where we can talk without being interrupted." <br/> They started following the older brother back to an office. They opened the door to the office and Leta Lestrange was standing there. <br/> Theseus surprised "Leta this is a nice surprise." <br/> Leta smiled at her fiancee "I just came to give you these. Hello Newt."<br/>  Newt smiled "Hello Leta nice to see you again."<br/>  Violet smiled at their connection "I'm Violet Glass. I'm an American Auror." <br/> Leta smiled at the girl "Nice to meet you."<br/>  Violet liked the girl immediately "You too Leta hope to see you again."<br/>  Leta nodded and turned back to Theseus "I will leave you to talk." She gave him a quick kiss which Newt just smiled that his friend from school found someone even if it was his brother. <br/> She left and Violet sat down which Newt sat next her.<br/>  Theseus sat across from her "So what is so important that you two had to sneak into the ministry using my face? How can I help?" He asked. <br/> Violet felt a wave of emotions for Theseus being Head Auror of the Ministry of Magic on assignment in Paris she knew that he could contact Macusa and have her returned to New York. <br/> Violet knew that her job now might be lost but she was doing this for her brother. "First off I need you to promise Theseus that you will not contact Macusa. Do you promise?" She asked meeting his gaze. Newt wondered what his brother would do now.<br/>“That depends, but if it’s nothing concerning national security then you have my word,” Theseus told her. Violet nodded, really she could expect nothing less.</p><p>“I need to know if auror Eric Glass has been here, he was with his senior auror Tina Goldstein, he’s my brother and usually he would let me know where he was going. We were supposed to meet after work but he just disappeared,” Violet explained and as she did she felt the worry she felt digging deeper into her bones, the words making it more real in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Just disappeared...?” Theseus gave gave her startled look. “Do you have any idea what his last mission was?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>“He was guarding the transport bringing Grindelwald back to Europe, so that’s why I came here looking for him.” Violet stopped abruptly when she noticed the look Theseus was giving her.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss, do you really not know..?” He ventured. </p><p>“Know what?” Violet turned to look at Newt but he was looking down and wouldn’t meet her eyes. Panic started to claw it’s way up her rib cage. “Will somebody please tell me what’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>“Grindelwald escaped on his way to Europe. Only a few survived the attack. If you brother was inside the coach then I’m afraid his chance of survival is quite slim,” Theseus told her. Newt glared at his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Theseus!” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry Newt, but it’s the truth. Of course I will check my records here at the ministry to see if he or Goldstein came by, but you must understand the situation,” Theseus continued. Violet felt her worst fears drop like lead into the pit of her stomach. That couldn’t be the truth when she hadn’t been able to mend things with her brother yet. To uncover the truth of why they had grown so far apart over the years. She was supposed to fix things. He couldn’t be...gone.</p><p> </p><p>It was a few minutes later that a secretary came back with the news that neither Tina or Eric had checked in at the ministry.</p><p> </p><p>“No...Madame President told me he went on a mission. Could that have been a lie?” Violet put her head in her hands. She suddenly felt a weight on her back. It was Newt’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t give up yet, Violet. There is another way...if you come with me I can find Tina and if your brother is with her we can find out what really happened,” he told her. Theseus stood up.</p><p>“Now this I have to see. Not to mention I want to know the details on Grindelwald’s escape from a first hand witness, I’m coming with you guys on official ministry business,” Theseus decided. Newt sighed.</p><p>“That’s just great, Theseus really,” he muttered.</p>
