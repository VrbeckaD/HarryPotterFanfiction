    <p>“Potter,”</p>
<p>“Malfoy,”</p>
<p>To anyone else, the greeting would have seemed forced and laced with an underlining of distaste and hatred. But to the former Gryffindor and Slytherin, it was something familiar. Harry gave Draco a genuine smile as he proceeded to make himself a cup of coffee. “Long time, no see,”</p>
<p>Draco scoffed, standing beside Harry as he brewed a fresh cup of tea. “Two days is hardly a long time. Besides, I’ve been so buried in paperwork, I’m surprised I was able to find my way into the office today,”</p>
<p>Harry laughed, it was still something Draco was trying to get used to. Sure, he’d heard the man laugh before, but never because of him. Harry has laughed <em>at</em> him plenty of times, but never with him. “Robards has been sure to keep us pretty busy,” he said, leaning against the counter in the break room. A couple other members from the ministry were gathered around, drinking coffee and sifting through paperwork. It was early Monday morning, a typical day in the Auror department, and the group was waiting for their morning meeting to begin.</p>
<p>“So, ready to start real training today?” Malfoy asked with a slight smirk.</p>
<p>They'd been in the program for just under six months now, most of it being a lot of filing paperwork and attending ministry classes on what it takes to become an auror and passing all of their written exams. It was how the two had become friends in the first place. Their class was quite the largest the Ministry had seen, which had to be a given now that the war was finally over. But once people were accepted in, and others were either weeded out or dropped out entirely, their class had dropped down. It was still a larger group than ever before, but the competition was high, and everyone was competing to stay at the top of the chain. It was clear among those high ups was none other than Malfoy and Harry. Ron was there too of course, but there was just something about the Gryffindor and Slytherin that never seemed to go away, even after school. They'd started studying together, simple as that, Harry sat on one side of the table, Draco on the other. No talking, just working. But then one day, Harry had asked to look at Draco’s notes on <em>Apparition and Aspiration</em>, and from there the two had been working together to make sure they were on top of whatever they needed to be to stay in the game.</p>
<p>Funny how the two most competitive trainees were helping each other succeed, but in all honesty, they needed each other.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Harry said, stretching out his limbs as he finally began to wake up. “No more papers!”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, “You do realize we'll still have reports and records to archive, right? As well as daily check ups and check ins?”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “Yes, but a significant amount less of it will be pilling up on my desk,”</p>
<p>Draco was going to reply, but then Robards stuck his head in, motioning to those inside to get a move on. Most grumbled, but they followed behind the man in charge as they prepared themselves not to fall back asleep again during his lecture.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It seemed like only yesterday they had graduated Hogwarts and got accepted into the Auror program. Ron had been over the moon, and Harry was just happy they were treating him like a human being who had to prove himself like everybody else, and not as the Saviour who could have whatever he wants. In all honesty, he was probably working twice as hard as everybody else. He wasn't exactly in shape for this kind of rigorous training. Quidditch could only do so much. And if it hadn't been for Draco, he wasn't sure he would have passed his written exams, not with the high marks he had received anyways.</p>
<p>But he knew this was one area he could excel in where Malfoy would have the disadvantage. Maybe he was bragging, but Harry was excellent at defense, especially in Dark Arts. He'd led the DA, and had gotten high marks in the subject on both his O.W.L.S and his N.E.W.T.S. He felt confident, and he knew he would pass through his practicals with flying colors.</p>
<p>Malfoy on the other hand, wasn't so confident. He was good with writing things down, memorization, and putting it to use when the time came. But actually attempting those things? Performing wand movements and remembering the difference between Bombarda and Confringo was a whole other thing.</p>
<p>Lucky for him though, he had Harry to help him out along the way.</p>
<p>“I guess now I’ll start have to repaying <em>you</em> for teaching me,” Malfoy said one day as they sat together in the ministry cafeteria.</p>
<p>“Seems only fair. Afterall, I did buy you all those cups of tea while cramming for exams,”</p>
<p>“So, what do you want then, Potter?” Malfoy asked with a slight smirk.</p>
<p>Harry looked up from his notes then and smiled. “Go on a date with me,”</p>
