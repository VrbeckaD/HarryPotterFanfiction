    <p>The sound of flesh hitting flesh can be heard quite loudly and not only that, even the sounds of things been thrown against a wall can be heard as well.</p><p>"Come on! That's ALL you can do?" The girl spat blood to the floor. Her eyes twinkled with unkindly.</p><p>"You will regret this, bitch!" The man roared, as he tried to punch the girl square in her face. She caught the man's hand and twisted it until the man's screamed painfully. He screamed even louder when his bones started to crunch. You could clearly tell that the girl had twisted it enough to make the man's hand dislocate, from his shoulder.</p><p>"Let him go, you bitch!" Another man roared from behind the girl. Her composure was calm, however, it was enough to make goosebumps rise.</p><p>Fear gripped the man who was trying to bully the girls, without thinking anything, he lifted his hand to punch the girl from behind, but before he could raise his hand, the girl lifted her leg and kicked the man's head as hard as she could.</p><p>"You bitch! Let me go!" Screamed the man that she was still holding. He hollered to her but she only gave a bone-chilling chuckle.</p><p>"I'm a bitch? Or are you?" The girl twisted the man's arm even more, which only made the man scream even louder. "Only a bitch will scream like that you know" The girl gave another bone-chilling laugh and again started to crush the man's hand bones again without a care in the world.</p><p>As she saw the man's tears start to trail down his face, she let go of his hand and kicked him in the gut as hard as she could. "Who's the bitch now? Bitch! I've had enough of being your fucking punch bag!" The girl screamed and kicked him again hard in the gut.</p><p>Without wasting her time, she walked to the back alley, knowing that she will have to deal with more of those at home.</p>
<hr/><p>Right after she returns to her home, she is glad to see there is no one inside, but then that relief comes crashing down like a tidal wave, when suddenly she can feel a punch to the side of her face and she lands on the floor, with a loud crash.</p><p>"Where the fuck have you fucking been?!" Her so-called father grabbed her hair and sneers in her face. She feels like she wants to gag upon the smell that comes out from her father mouth, just seeing those rotten teeth is enough to make her stomach roll.</p><p>"Let her go, Felix!" a woman slowly came up to the man, with a sway in her hips. The girl felt a little bit of relief, but then again it turns sour when the woman accused her. "Maybe, she goes to have some fucking. Who knows? We do need some money in this house."</p><p>"I will never go and fuck like you, bitch!" The girl sneers, but then the woman slaps her face hard enough to make the girl's lip split. The woman holds the girl's face hard enough to make her nails embed in the girl's cheek. "Listen here, you little whore, this fucker's money is the one who raised you and this fucker's money is with what you have been eating, so you had better watch your fucking mouth."</p><p>The woman let go of the girl, but before the girl could go, the woman slaps her face which makes her long nail leave a scratch on her face, like cat's claw.</p><p>"Oh no, my nail is broke. What should I do Felix?" The woman whines to her so-called husband.</p><p>Meanwhile, the girl sneers and touches her cheek. She can feel that the nail of her so-called mother is stuck in her cheek, without wasting her time, she took out the nail from her cheek and before she could walk to her room, the woman starts to grab her hair.</p><p>"Go and fucking make food for us you bitch! You broke my nail! So you will not have any food, if I found that you ate our food, I will make sure you will pay for it! You hear me?" The woman screamed - in sing song on the last part- before she let go of the girl's hair, and without waiting for the girl walked into the kitchen.</p><p>The woman that calls herself mother starts to straddle the so-called father and starts to fuck without a care in the world, that their so-called daughter is there. The girl looks on with disgust and wishes so much that she could kill them with her own bare hands.</p>
<hr/><p>The girl woke up and looked around. Slowly she tried to stand up, but then a flashback comes crashing to her brain.</p><p>
  <em>"You bitch! I asked you to cook us food, not dog shit!" The woman shrieked and started to take the plate and throw it at the girl's head.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You damn ungrateful wench! We should have killed you from the very start!" The man yelled, and then-started to choke the girl as hard as he can. Right after he let go of her neck, he started to kick and stomp the girl.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The girl could hear a sound of her own broken bones countless times, yet not a single sound she let out except laughter. "Is that all you can do! You hit like a fucking sissy!" The laughter from the girl only came out a little bit, but then everything stopped when she felt something on her chest.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Slowly she looks down to her chest.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was a knife. It was embedded into her chest by the woman that was her own mother. The woman looked at her own hand and trembled, but the girl's face broke into a wide grin, slowly she holds the woman face and murmured to her. "Look at my face, let this face hunt you until the day you die"</em>
</p><p>The girl looks over the ceiling right after she remembers everything. "So I die, well that sure is fucked up. Well, aren't I supposed to be in hell or something?"</p><p>Right after she finishes, she hears a knock at the front door.</p>
<hr/><p>"Ms Pierrot?" the girl looked at the woman with a frown and looked at the woman up and down.</p><p>"Yeah, and who the heck are you?"</p><p>"My name is Minerva McGonagall. May I see your parents?" The woman with pointy hat look at the girl with a blank face, but then started to frown, as she can see the house is quite in shambles with things everywhere. She started to wonder as to how did the girl able to live in this place, for so long?</p><p>"Sorry ma'am, I don't have parents. So, may I know why you come to my <em>house</em>?" Pierrot quirks her brow but at the same time, she is panic internally as she knows where the fuck she is. She's in the fucking Harry Potter story, but somehow it can't be true.</p><p>Her brain internally is in a jumbled mess and before she was able to hear the pointy hat woman answer her question, darkness starts to creep on and engulf her. Again, she internally curses herself for forgetting that she been bit senseless before she woke up here.</p>
<hr/><p>"Albus, I can't just leave her like this. She's all alone and thanks Merlin if Pomfrey hadn't come. We would lose her. Haven't you heard what Pomfrey said? She has broken ribs, a concussion, and a few cracked bones. Merlin, whoever would do such a thing to such a small child? " Minerva holds her hand to her chest upon seeing Pierrot, laid on the broken sofa in her house.</p><p>"I agree with you, my dear. But doesn't she have any relatives? You know we can't keep children that are not our relatives…"</p><p>Before Dumbledore can say anything, Pierrot groaned and started to reply. "I don't have any relatives, they all left me to drop dead in here and please don't you dare to hide my bruise. I don't care if you wish to heal my other injuries but let the bruise heal itself."</p>
<hr/><p>"Excuse me sir but can you tell me where platform 9 ¾ is?" Pierrot looks the raven-haired boy with a smirk, it seems that she has meet Harry Potter. Without wasting her time, she taps his shoulder.</p><p>"You want to go to that platform?" The raven-haired boy look over the girl with a nod, but then he saw the bruise that littered over her face and every part of her skin but Pierrot just ignored it.</p><p>"Yeah, can you show me?"</p><p>"Sure, come on. I know where it was, by the way, the name is Pierrot, only Pierrot. And how about you?" She held out her hand while waiting for Harry to shake her hand. Harry's eyes turned wide upon hearing what Pierrot exclaim. "Harry, Harry Potter. It is quite to know you too Pierrot"</p>
<hr/><p>Harry looked over Pierrot nervously, it is his first time seeing a girl with so many bruises. He uses to have it, curtsy by Dursley. "You know it's quite rude to be staring like that."</p><p>Harry jumped upon hearing what Pierrot had just said, but then again jumped when the compartment door opened.</p><p>There wasa bushy haired girl and a plump boy, looking at them around. "Hello! -. Did any of you see a toad that belongs to my friend here?"</p><p>"No. " Harry replied while looking over at the bushy haired girl and the plump boy.</p><p>"Nope, but may I know what his name is?" Both bushy haired girl and the plump boy looked over at Pierrot, but then gasp upon seeing her. She knows that she has bruises littered all over her skin, but she ignores it.</p><p>"T..T... Tre…Trevor." The plump boy said which she knows his name is Neville Longbottom, while the bushy hair is Hermione Granger.</p><p>"Okay, how about the two of you have a seat,-" Pierrot grins when both of them compiled and sat near Harry. "Well, here goes nothing. Accio Trevor,." Right after she said those words, Trevor was there in her own hands.</p><p>"Here you go," Pierrot gave the toad to Neville, but then looks at both of them. Just to show that she is just like them, a new student. "So, what's your name, if you don't mind?"</p><p>Both cuties eyes turned wide and started to blush upon seeing them that they forgot to tell their name.</p><p>"Merlin, I forgot. I'm Hermione Granger."</p><p>"Ne…Nevi...Neville Long...Longbottom."</p><p>Pierrot smile inwardly but then starts to introduce herself. "Pierrot, just Pierrot. I don't have last name."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
