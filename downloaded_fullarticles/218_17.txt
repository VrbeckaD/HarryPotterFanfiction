    <p>In Lind, they had two seasons of harvest. Once for the spring, and once more for winter.</p><p>Harry remembered clearly the pre-winter planting that came after his birthday, the memories even now so vivid. If he closed his eyes, he could remember the smell of the ground, fertile and warm, and the sounds of the farmers tilling the earth and planting the seeds.</p><p>Those memories were all he had now.</p><p>In Lind, they had two seasons of harvest. And then there was the <em> other </em> Harvest.</p><p>It came every seven years, and Harry was only four when he experienced his first. He hadn't understood then, had only stayed silent and behaved as his Aunt Petunia had ordered him to. His aunt’s face had been grim and drawn, his cousin Dudley clasped tightly in her arms. His uncle had stood beside her, his hand on her shoulder as they both stared, silent and solemn at the center of the square.</p><p>Harry remembered watching as their village leader, Cornelius Fudge, called out the name of another boy, one he did not know, and he remembered the hush that came over the crowd. The moment of silence seemed to stretch on forever before the chosen boy had risen up, expression determined and steely. Harry remembered the way the boy’s mother had wailed, the way the father’s stoic expression had cracked.</p><p>And then Fudge called out another name, and then another, a boy and a girl. Three children in total, their mothers and fathers crying. Harry watched as the three were brought to Dumbledore and the old man took them away.</p><p>He remembered the confusing mix of feelings thick in the crowd. The families whose children had been spared had hugged each other with what Harry didn't know yet was relief and joy. Those who had lost theirs could do nothing but cry.</p><p>Harry had tugged on his aunt's hand that day, his face round still, childhood clinging to his cheeks.</p><p>He had asked her then with just the barest lisp, "Why are they crying?"</p><p>His aunt had turned her head and looked at him then. For once, her face hadn't held the usual irritation that it did when she usually looked at him. The lines of her face hadn’t been so hard.</p><p>Harry remembered it clearly because she had never looked at him like that again.</p><p>"I'll explain when you're older," she had said.</p><p>In the end, she hadn't needed to.</p><p>Seven years later, Harry's own name was called.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>“Harry Potter.”</p><p>From the village center, Fudge met his gaze as Harry stood up, Fudge’s eyes assessing. He felt like he was being measured, and worse, was found wanting.</p><p>Harry bowed his head. He stared at his hands, at the fine tremble that ran through them. He didn't cry. He didn't even make a sound.</p><p>Two more names came after him: Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. </p><p>Harry watched as their parents cried. He could barely believe the number of redheads that clasped Ron tight, the boy's face pale. He looked like he was about to pass out. Hermione looked no less afraid, her shoulders tight and her eyes sightless as she stared into the distance. All three of them so young and fearful.</p><p>He left his aunt, his uncle and his cousin behind him without another glance. He was old enough now to see the first, instinctual relief in their faces when his name was called instead of Dudley's, and then the mild guilt that came after. Not from his uncle, no, but his aunt had looked at him then with something approaching compassion. Something else, too, that Harry didn't quite understand.</p><p>Harry walked past the crowd, their pitying gazes following him. His skin itched under the collective weight of it, and it got no better as the three of them joined Fudge in the center. They glanced at each other, momentarily meeting each other's eyes before they looked away.</p><p>Harry said nothing to them, his lips pressed together, his hands clutched in front of him to stem the shaking. He said nothing even when Fudge led them to the House, all the way at the very outskirts where the village was about to end, and the forest was about to begin. An in between, in some way.</p><p>They were brought inside, past the main sitting area into the rooms where no one but their village leader and his most trusted stayed. He chatted inanely all throughout, seemingly oblivious to the way Harry, Ron, and Hermione held themselves, tense and tight. Ready to run but nowhere to go.</p><p>Harry had always wondered how the inside of the House looked like. It had been a source of unending curiosity just a few days ago, but actually seeing it now, his attention was frayed at the edges. He didn’t care.  </p><p>"I'll hand you three off to Dumbledore. He's in charge of you tributes," Fudge said, the careless air as he waved his hand making Harry bristle.</p><p>He led them to another room, and behind a desk, an old man sat. His hair was long and white, his beard possibly just as long as it reached his waist. There was a grim expression on his wrinkled face, his shoulders slumped.</p><p>Dumbledore motioned for them to sit across from him, and Harry settled into the rightmost chair, his hands twisting and turning. Harry squirmed at the weight of his stare even as Dumbledore directed his gaze to Hermione and Ron too. Beside him, Ron leaned back as he played with the hem of his shirt. On his other side, Hermione straightened up, her chin lifting attentively.</p><p>Finally, Dumbledore murmured, "Do you understand, my children, what this means for you?"</p><p>Harry swallowed. He looked beside him at Ron and Hermione and watched as they both quietly nodded. Harry’s chest ached, and his gaze flicked from them to Dumbledore, the understanding all three of them seemed to share and that he wasn’t a part of. </p><p>Harry cleared his throat. "No," he rasped. "No one has ever explained it to me."</p><p>Dumbledore looked at him silently, and Harry's eyes raised up to take him in. Harry was struck by just how <em> old </em> he looked. He was an old man with even older eyes, weariness dragging at his features. He looked immeasurably and bone-deep tired. Most striking was the dullness in his features as he gazed at them, that pity in them mixed with a drawn sort of kindness.</p><p>"There is a god who lives in our forest," Dumbledore started, voice low and solemn, and Harry straightened up. "Every seven years, he asks for a sacrifice. A tribute pure of heart so he may consume it."</p><p>Harry felt the blood drain from his face, and when he tried to breathe, it came out as a hitching gasp. He steeled himself and stuck out his chin, even as it wobbled.</p><p>"That's us, then," he declared. He understood now why this morning's breakfast had been tense, as if a formless monster had shaped itself into something almost visible that breathed down their necks. He understood the tight atmosphere, thick enough that Harry had to wade through it as his aunt and uncle let him accompany them to the village square for once.</p><p>He had been called for his death. Harry was going to die today.</p><p>"No," Dumbledore said quietly, eyes tracking his features. "Not yet."</p><p>Dumbledore cleared his throat, and then gently he called out, "Cedric?"</p><p>Another boy entered the room and Harry's breath caught in his throat. He stared, stunned speechless, as the boy from seven years ago gave him a small smile.</p><p>"As he desires a tribute pure of heart, the stories say that only one pure of heart can defeat him," Dumbledore murmured. Beside him, Cedric only nodded, his hands clasped in front of him. He held a calm acceptance, a serenity about him in the face of what he had been raised to do.</p><p>Harry wondered if he knew how his father had become a bitter drunk, crying for his son every night. He wondered if Cedric knew his mother was dead.</p><p>"What happened to the other two, the ones chosen with you?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Dumbledore rested a hand on Cedric's shoulder. It looked solid, firm, and Harry swallowed down his nervous fear.</p><p>"Cedric showed himself worthy. The others are serving the village in a different way."</p><p>It was better this way, Dumbledore told them as he gently explained. Rather than a Harvest, and then a Sacrifice to the god all in one day, they spaced it apart. They prepared their tributes, kept them pure of heart and raised them with the hope that someday, somehow, they'd triumph over the forest god.</p><p>Then, at the end, they picked once more. Their Champion of the Light, pure, and powerful.</p><p>Harry, if chosen, only had seven years left to live.</p><p>As there were times for planting and times for harvest, there was also the time in between. The period of waiting, before the crops grew and were ready.</p><p>(But the better metaphor, Harry supposed much later once he was old enough, was that of lambs raised for slaughter.)</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>At the edge of the forest Cedric Diggory stood, proud and tall. </p><p>He was dressed in white, his robes clean and pressed. Looking back, Harry couldn’t help but think how young it made him look; Cedric’s handsome features made cherubic, angelic in their youthful curves.</p><p>Cedric wavered, a boy of only fourteen caught in between life and death, but still he went. His expression was steely, determined, and he held his dignity tight around his shoulders.</p><p>Harry had wondered if he’d have the same dignity if he was chosen.</p><p>They met gazes. It was only a moment, insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but Harry was struck. Drawn in by the serenity of Cedric, the lack of fear on the other boy only exemplifying the own fear that was making Harry’s hands tremble. </p><p>Cedric smiled at him. Harry straightened up, a brief burst of hope filling him. Maybe Cedric would make it. Maybe Cedric would be the one to end this.</p><p>To his side, Hermione clasped her hands to her chest and made a soft sound, gaze locked onto Cedric. Ron looked like he’d rather not watch at all, and yet something kept his eyes on Cedric. Harry understood. It was the kind of horrifying where you couldn’t bear to look, and yet it would be worse to look away.</p><p>Harry could do nothing but watch as Cedric disappeared into the forest, a figure of white slowly disappearing into the endless shadows. A muted sense of horror was heavy in his gut despite the earlier hope. It was only stirred the more he thought about the monstrous god that Cedric had to face all by himself, and of how Harry himself might have to do the same.</p><p>They waited until the sun came up, until Harry’s own eyes drooped no matter how hard he tried to keep them open. The light of dawn shone through the leaves overhead, bathing them and the ground in a gentle glow. It was beautiful. </p><p>Cedric didn’t return.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>They followed Dumbledore back into the House.</p><p>Harry was numb. Grief and loss, confusion and a new anger battled inside him. He was barely aware as they sat him down for breakfast in the main dining hall, a muted and quiet affair, all of them ruminating on what and who they had sacrificed. Harry had only known Cedric for so little time, and yet he felt raw, scraped open inside.</p><p>Why did they do this? Why was this normal?</p><p>Hermione sat across him, and with a brief hesitation, Ron took the seat beside him. Hermione looked to be on the verge of tears; she didn’t meet his eyes. </p><p>Even as they put the food down in front of him, the scent of it making his stomach growl and his nostrils flare, Harry couldn't muster up the appetite. It looked better than anything he had ever had, the cut of meat juicy and dripping a grotesque red, the vegetables fresh. Yet all Harry could do was push his food around his plate.</p><p>Ron, on the other hand, had no such qualms. Harry stared at him as he shoved spoon after spoon into his mouth, a seemingly bottomless pit. Harry and Hermione gave each other disbelieving looks, both of them smiling, even if it was strained and short-lasting. A moment of amusement even in the solemn mood. </p><p>It couldn’t last. His mind was still caught on the sight of Cedric's back, the image practically branded into Harry's mind. Even the color white itself made him flinch, reminding him of the firm set of Cedric's shoulders, the determined, hard line of his jaw. </p><p><em> Had it been quick? </em> he wondered. If it had been, then that meant that Cedric hadn't even stood a chance against Voldemort, even after seven years of whatever training Dumbledore had given him. His eyes slid towards Hermione and Ron, his heart a steady, low pounding in his chest. He wondered which one of them Dumbledore would deem worthy.</p><p>
  <em> Had it hurt? </em>
</p><p>His hands curled around his utensils, his knuckles white. He didn't want to know the answer.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Harry found sleep hard that first night, unable to do anything but toss and turn. It wasn’t that the bed was uncomfortable. Far from it. It was the nicest bed that Harry had ever slept on, but his mind was still caught.</p><p>The tense breakfast with the Dursleys already seemed as if it was years behind him rather than just a few hours ago. Harry felt weary and restless.</p><p>He looked to his side and eyed what appeared to be the sleeping form of Ron. He wondered if he was pretending like him, or if Ron had already put the day’s events past him.</p><p>Harry tilted his head up towards the roof and closed his eyes.</p><p>The sight of Cedric draped in white as he entered the dark forest replayed over and over in his mind, until the dark shadows seemed to grow bigger, big enough that they overwhelmed and moved past the boundary of the forest, its tendrils reaching up over Cedric’s feet. The trees seemed taller, more imposing, Cedric smaller and smaller, the white of his attire dimmer and dimmer with each replay. The ground at his feet seemed to writhe, a shapeless mass that Harry couldn’t make out even as it curled and slithered over Cedric’s legs. The face of the other boy seemed to morph and change, a dizzying flux, until Harry started with shock and horror at the sight of his own face imposed upon Cedric’s. </p><p>His mirror image stared back at him. There was no fear in his face, just the same calm acceptance that he had seen in Cedric. Harry found that this scared him more than anything else had.</p><p>He watched himself, Harry-in-Cedric’s-body, as Cedric walked into the forest once more.</p><p>It was only when he woke up, gasping and sweaty, the sheets tangled around his knees, that Harry realized he had been dreaming.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Harry, Ron and Hermione formed a tentative, not-quite-friendship the next few days. No one else could understand the inevitable horror the three of them felt. </p><p>But still, Harry wasn’t sure if he could call either of them friends. He got along with the both of them well enough, but Harry had never had a friend before. Maybe this <em> was </em> what having friends was like. His only other basis for comparison was Dudley and his gang, and Harry could do without the bullying and the mean-spirited competition that Dudley’s gang partook in.</p><p>This casual… whatever they had, was good enough for Harry. He didn’t think that he’d get anything else.</p><p>He took to his new life more easily than Hermione and Ron did, far too used to being locked in and unable to leave. Despite Harry’s possible fate as a sacrifice, he found himself enjoying life in the House. They had no chores aside from keeping their rooms clean, and the meals were just as hearty and delicious as they had seemed that first night, even if Harry hadn’t eaten then.</p><p>Life was good, or as good as it could be, and Harry found it much better than living with the Dursleys. And so Harry was lulled into a sense of complacency. </p><p>He didn’t think much of it when the three of them were called one morning, exactly a month after the Harvest, and dressed in white. They were brought to the edge of the forest, exactly where they had seen Cedric off.</p><p>Harry frowned. There was something about this place, in-between forest and civility. He felt as though he was being watched. He couldn’t do anything but force it out of his mind, reaching out to accept the plates filled with meat handed to them.</p><p>As Ron made to take a bite, a hand stopped him.</p><p>“That’s not for you,” a voice scolded, and Ron immediately dropped the slice of meat. The tips of his ears turned red and he ducked his head, scuffling his feet. Harry blinked up at the girl. She looked older than them, her hair long and her face pale.</p><p>“Sorry,” Ron mumbled. As the girl turned away, Ron discreetly picked up a stray slice of meat and popped it into his mouth. They met eyes and Harry covered his mouth as they both snickered.</p><p>“Proceed.” Dumbledore’s voice was calm and clear, drawing attention in the way it did.</p><p>The three of them straightened up, and with a sense of unease, Harry realized that it was only the three of them who had the plates of meat. The others gathered a bit further off, nearer to the shade of the House and in a loose semi-circle. They were empty handed, simply watching Harry, Hermione and Ron.</p><p>Under Dumbledore’s guidance and watchful eye, they bent down and placed the plates on the ground.</p><p>“As tradition calls,” Dumbledore continued.</p><p>The same girl who had reprimanded Ron stepped to stand in front of him, and Harry straightened in attention. He raised his head and their eyes met but her gaze quickly skittered away.</p><p>In her hands was a knife. It was small, nothing bigger than what they used for meals. She pressed it into his hands.</p><p>“Cut yourself,” she whispered. “Just a bit, over the food.”</p><p>“Why?” Harry asked, bewildered, his hands tightening over the knife. She shook her head, still avoiding his eyes, and Harry looked up to see Dumbledore watching him expectantly.</p><p>That unease from earlier felt more insistent now. Still, Harry obediently pressed the sharp edge over his thumb until a bead of blood welled up. He held it out over the plate and squeezed his thumb until a single drop fell into the meat.</p><p>In the next second, the girl was already reaching out and taking the knife away from him. Harry let go of it; his hands felt empty. He clasped them close to his chest, squeezing again at the tiny cut over his thumb. Another drop of blood rose to the surface, just as Ron cut into his own thumb.</p><p>Ron did the same as him, a single drop of blood into the plate, and then Hermione, her sharp eyes darting back and forth over Dumbledore, to the people gathered around them, to the plates on the floor in front of them. There was an energy to her. She seemed to almost be vibrating out of her skin, but as Harry shot her a questioning look, she simply shook her head.</p><p>They stood there in silence. No one moved, no one talked. Harry would think that no one was breathing if he couldn’t hear his own breath. He didn’t know what they were waiting for until—</p><p>Harry straightened up. There, low on the floor, was a glint of scales. They were dark green, almost black from where Harry stood, and he let out a surprised breath as he realized it was a group of snakes. Not one, not two. Harry couldn’t count how many snakes came, both from high, the branches of the trees, and low, from the undergrowth. He couldn’t tell where one snake started and where the next one ended.</p><p>Beside him, Ron shuddered in visible disgust. He looked pale, his freckles standing out stark against his sheet-white skin. His eyes were glued to the mass of snakes as they swallowed down the chunks of meat and fought amongst themselves.</p><p>A sick thought rose without his consent. Was this their fate in the future? The image of snakes writhing over him, ready to devour him, their bodies stretching—Harry covered his mouth and looked away.</p><p>When he managed to look again, the plates were empty. The snakes abandoned the plates, uncaring now that there was nothing left. The white of the plates looked out of place now on the forest ground, the dark red juice of the raw meat the only remnants of the sacrifice.</p><p>With no other words, Dumbledore dismissed them.</p><p>“It’s just another sacrifice,” Hermione finally hissed out once the three of them were alone. She had been red with the effort to restrain herself, and now that she didn’t need to, she was almost tripping over her own words. “Meat and blood—our blood, of course our blood, who else’s blood would it be?”</p><p>“And it was just us,” Ron said. His voice sounded strange. Harry said nothing, his index finger swiping over the wound that had already stopped bleeding.</p><p>It was practice, he realized. A taste of what was to come.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Harry dreamt that night once more. He watched the image of himself stare back at him, pale and wide green eyes. And no matter what he did, or what he said, he could do nothing but watch as Harry turned, walked into the forest, and didn’t look back.</p><p>And in the darkness, the glint of scales. Black in the moonlight, shiny and clear, wrapping around Harry as he disappeared into the cover of the trees. Soft and tender, almost as if it were welcoming him home.</p><p><em> Wake up </em>, Harry told himself. It’s just a dream.</p><p>Harry’s eyes shot open, and he could see nothing but dark shadows, the image of clawed hands reaching out towards him.</p><p>He screamed. He stumbled backwards and fell, landing on the dew-wet grass of the boundary that separated the forest from the village. He pushed himself away, staggering to his feet. His heart pounded in his chest.</p><p>A cold sweat made its way down his back as Harry looked around himself frantically. He had no clue how he had ended up here in front of the forest, when he was sure he had fallen asleep in his bed.</p><p>He swallowed. He felt clammy and lightheaded, barely able to breathe. His heart was still beating frantically in his chest, uncontrollable despite how he grasped at his chest in an effort to make it calm.</p><p>He adjusted his glasses, looking back at the dark shadows, the clawed hands, and felt a hiccup escape him as he realized—those weren’t hands. They were branches from the trees. Harry laughed, inappropriately loud from the surprise. He covered his face, hunching over his knees.</p><p>They were just branches.</p><p>He straightened up, his heartbeat finally beginning to slow down. It still didn’t explain why he was near the forest rather than in bed, but it wasn’t the first time Harry had sleepwalked.</p><p>It was just because he kept dreaming of the forest, he told himself. That was it. He gave the dark shadows one last look, his eyes passing over the reaching branches, the shifting of leaves in the darkness, and turned back to make his way home to the House.</p><p>Behind him, the glint of scales shifted, before it disappeared.</p>
