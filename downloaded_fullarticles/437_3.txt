    <p>Severus wasn't sure of his feelings, not entirely. His cock twitched as he eyed Potter before him, his body coated in sweat, his chest heaving. He felt hot and cold at the same time, the cold metal of the chair he was secured to fighting against the heat of the magic pouring off the other man. He clenched his fists, flexing his arms slightly against the ropes that bound them to the arms of the chair.</p><p>He was trapped, with no means of escape. His wand had been tossed somewhere in the room, beyond his reach, out of sight. He briefly wondered if this was what it was like to come across an unmated dragon during mating season. Potter wasn't facing him, his attention focused elsewhere, yet his magic was trying its damnedest to burn Severus to the core.</p><p>Not that he minded. No amount of mental shielding was going to save him from a dragon's magic. It only did so much when the magic triggered physical responses in one's body, as evidenced by his straining cock.</p><p>Bloody hell, he wasn't even getting the full exposure yet. Potter was still veiled. He feared for his sanity.</p><p>A deep growl pierced through the room, like distant thunder. It took Severus a moment to realize that the sound was coming from the man before him. Finished with his dressings, Heri slowly turned to face his prey, the flames from the fireplace dancing across his deep, umber skin. Piercing green eyes scorched over him, leaving pieces of him feeling like ash in their wake.</p><p>This was so unlike the Potter he had watched grow up over the years. Severus wasn't even sure if they were the same person anymore.</p><p>Full lips parted to reveal glistening fanged teeth. His beautiful face twisted into a sneer. "Are you ready for your detention, Professor?" The question came out rough - it sounded almost like a threat. If Severus was a bit more coherent, he would have taken it as one.</p><p>He was not, and therefore, he didn't. Instead he nodded, his voice failing him. The sneer on Potter's face twisted into a wide grin that spoke of pain yet to come. He exhaled a small cloud of smoke and his magic flared. Severus was sure the temperature in the room has increased.</p><p>"Then let's start," Potter replied, black scales sprouting slowly across his skin. Severus choked on his heart. Let's start, indeed.</p>
