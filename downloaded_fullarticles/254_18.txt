    <p>From the sky, a blazing light falls into the surface. Screams were heard by hell as suddenly it awoke and connected to its King.</p><p> </p><p>The Light hits the ground causing the entire dimension of hell to shake as pillars arise and fire spreads from his body only to turn to ice and back in some places. Water was created in hell as well as Fire. The King's wings the burned materials fall from the sky and from there hit different parts of hell creating things. Bright lights follow and hit the ground nearby each of them out cold. Lucifer awakens and sees everything feeling Hell awake and immediately prepares his Kingdom while Creating Mansions for his siblings.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From the area came shadowy figures all given shapes by Lucifer. Lucifer frowning at this at all of them the same focuses and change each of the demons creating billion different types. Lucifer frowns at the fact they only had one form so changing that he Created multiple forms for each one some could shapeshift into other creatures. Lucifer turns toward his siblings seeing all of them awake but looking at him in anger then knowing none of them were powerful enough to fight him fly away.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer sighs in anger then understanding decides to wait to know that some of his new creations will fight under his brothers but others will attack his family and with how weak they were they would be forced to seek help. Lucifer shakes his head knowing that they need a reason to unite after Losing so completely in heaven even though Lucifer didn't cause a war. Michael started one unable to see how Lucifer didn't get destroyed by God and Beliving that God would destroy him.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer shakes his head enraged at the thought of Michael turns back turns his new Kingdom sighing as he orders hell to create chambers for souls to be punished in. The Demons start getting restless so Lucifer sighs and waits for the Demons to attack and the moment they decide to Lucifer just snaps his fingers causing the demons who were planning to attack to burn to ashes in front of them.</p><p>All around them he hears the demons gulp as Lucifer yells '' ENOUGH BOW TO YOUR KING ''. All-around him he sees his demons kneel in to him making his power grow. The remaining angels that stood with him bow to Lucifer making him smile and say '' I want each of you to take a portion of the demons and head to a manor the surrounding areas our yours to command and I will tell you which souls will go into your area ''.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Angels smile at Lucifer and say'' We will meet you back once we have to change the area to our Liking ''. Lucifer smiles at his generals as they head to start building their kingdom. Lucifer froze feeling Hell send information into his head at his ability to control hell and its workings. Lucifer smiles at the fact that he is the god of hell he can even leave hell as long as systems were set up. Lucifer shakes his head at the fact that he would only be forty percent less powerful on earth then in hell ,Lucifer starts focusing and then thinking he needs material for the castle creates hell wood and Metals and then using them creates an eight-story castle then he creates soil for hell and makes one everywhere then creates materials for Funiture. Lucifer using his power creates furniture for the castle then places it inside each of the Mansions and Castle sighing turns</p><p>back at the remaining demons and says who was awe at the changes already made with a few salivating at the thought of being close to their king with others planning to betray him already. '' I want each of you to head to my castle so I can't give you further orders'' The Demons grunting head in confusing as towards the castle as Lucifer sighs as he flys toward the information of the traitors downloaded into his head. Lucifer thinking for a moment decides that he needs to stop the traitors before they become a problem but he needs the other demons to serve him even though some of them won't like it and he needs his brothers and sisters to join under him before the monsters destroy their souls turning them into lords of monsters</p><p>and increasing the power of the monster. Lucifer landing in his bedroom walks in and sees his room was huge with Red and Black furniture made of Slik like substances with a Bed fit for ten kings Lucifer focuses and feels the castle has the king's chamber bathroom and Study the entire area was a story tall with mistress rooms nearby with one right next to the king's which was the queen bedroom was on the eighth then lords chamber which was on the sixth floor and had grey and white furniture. The Barracks which was outside could fit thirty thousand demons which were plain. The Knight chambers were the</p><p>third floor and held the armory for the knights and they were Red the Color of his knights. then the Servants quarters which was the first floor the kitchen and dining room the second floor with the game room and library on the fourth floor. and on the fifth floor was the king's armory. Lucifer sighs and using his connection connects the water with essences of his burn wings connecting it to every mansion and the castle so they would have a steady supply of water. Lucifer walks to the second floor where the throne room and war room lays and enters the throne room seeing his demons Lucifer walks to his throne made of stone, wood, and fire and sits in it facing the crowd who all feels there power grow again and causing each of them to kneel. Lucifer sighs looking at the demons who were standing confused suddenly Lucifer summons two of his brothers who stay with him and had them beat the demons still standing which took only a minute and then Lucifer says '' Bring the</p><p>demons to stand at the base ''. The angels drag each demon then dump them making each of the demons realize that Lucifer knew. Lucifer thinking stands and says '' My subjects these demons are guilty of treasonous thoughts Know that does not allow for the crime of treason there are three punishments one Death to Exile and three-sentences to the hunt. The demons murmur to each other till one gets up and looking him in the eye asks '' Hunt ''. Lucifer seeing the female demon says '' what is your name Demon ''. The Demon stands straight and says '' My mother name me Mazikeen of the Lilm ''. Lucifer smiles and says '' A Lilm interesting and if I remember Lilm demons are the most powerful demons because you were the first and you</p><p>have the power of an angel and the ability of your mother the first succubus Lillith. Mazikeen nods at her King when A beaten demon yells '' The Bitch ... '' The Demon head was cut off by Mazikeen who freezes realizing that Lucifer didn't give the command Lucifer looking at her slowly smiles and says '' Once we are done stay here with ten of your siblings ''. Mazikeen and the other Lilm think what could this be he wasn't killing them because he would do that in front of them. Lucifer says '' Now to answer your question Mazikeen the Hunt is where I order the demon hunted down by demons ''. Mazikeen and the others were bright eyes at the thought hoping this was the case. Lucifer looking at the thousand treason demons says '' I call</p><p>for the hunt''. The Demons cheer as The angels laughs as Lucifer snaps his fingers and yells '' go to my lands they are hiding don't let them escape. The Demons run cheering at the thought running after them. Lucifer and the angels look at the remaining Lilm and listen as Lucifer speaks '' I ask you here to stay to serve as My demon Generals ''. The Lilm all smile kneeling to their King as Lucifer holds his hand up and says '' Now only two of you will serve as general of the army '' They nod at that Listening as Lucifer says '' Two will serve as Bodyguards for Me personally ''. Mazikeen eyes wide nodding at that thinking that would be her. Lucifer seeing Mazikeen's face smiles and says '' Three will serve as Asmassbors to the other</p><p>lords of the realm ''. the two more will serve as spies for me personally the last will serve as the mayor of hell ''. everyone confuse as Lucifer says '' The Mayor is responsible for the small stuff making certain laws are followed keeping the people happy the lands. Making certain demons do their jobs and they serve as the one who takes care of the staff for the castle ''. The Lilm nod at the fact one of them will have that much power when they were crushed when Lucifer says '' that will be your mother ''. Lucifer seeing it says '' The Last one of you will help your mother ''. Mazikeen stands and asks to become his personally Bodyguard. Lucifer nods as the Lilm claims their duties and how they will work. Lucifer sighing leans back into the throne and says '' Leave me '' Everyone leaves the Throne heading to their quarters except the mayor and Maze. Lucifer</p><p>seeing that sighs and focuses and creates a manor for the mayor to live and govern. Maze looking at the king in awe watches as Lucifer deflates and he says '' go to the top floor pick a room and it shall be yours '' Lucifer watching the two bodyguards nods and walk to pick a room. Lucifer watches Lillith look at her lover and King and says'' My king I know we ...'' Lucifer looking at Lillith sighs at her and says '' We will discuss more when Hell is function at top capacity ''. Lillith sighs nodding leaving to begin her duties. His five Angels generals look at Lucifer and ask '' is something the matter brother ?''Lucifer sighs and says '' Yes I feel if I had fought against our father instead of talking we may have gotten what we wanted instead I order no war and Michael attacked us and kicked us from heaven ''. Ramiel looking at his brother says in sadness '' It would have been worse we could quite possibly be dead or worse but don't ask yourself what if ''. The others nod at Lucifer making him feel like less of a failure. But one of the Angel generals was seething in rage at their king planning to lead his siblings to true glory. Lucifer nodding at his brothers says '' I must reward you all for staying near me so step forth ''. They do. Lucifer says ''</p><p>Ramiel you have always been a scholar, not a fighter I name you hell's Librarian and Historian ''. Ramiel with a smile on his face bows to his king in gladness. Lucifer turns to Beelzebub and says '' You were my greatness Leader I name you my master of war ''. Beelzebub's face doesn't change except his eyes which show his delight as Lucifer turns to the next '' Asmodeus you are my supplier you love being able to keep our forces from rebelling and being the only one being able to get it I name you the master of coin and delights ''. Asmodeus bowing smiles then frowns asking '' Delights '' Lucifer smirks and says '' Yes I</p><p>want you to keep the morale up with hunts and sports but I also know that there will be those who try to force themselves on others you are to make establishments dealing with the flesh but keep the employers safe and happy and most of all willing ''. Asmodeus nods with a smile he says '' I am The Angel of Lust and wealth '' Lucifer smiles at him and says '' If that what</p><p>your title is then yes it is perfect each of you finds one and I will give you a power accordingly ''. The angels nod and leave knowing that they were dismissed. Lucifer sighs as he begins concentrating on hell trying to make it where he has everything taken care of. Lucifer focuses his attention on the food situation although most demons don't need food Angels and a few</p><p>races of demons do. Lucifer using his burnt feathers in the air creates soil type foods. Lucifer than creates animals for hell using the structure of the animals his father created makes a hell's version for each that has ever been created then he notices that the soil and some animals need a light source so Lucifer spreading his wings pulls out a few undamaged feathers causing him to scream in agony making Maze run in who upon seeing what he's doing watches him. Lucifer breathing deeply uses his feathers to create stars which he combines and throws into Hell's sky causing a blue star to appear creating a light source but it strangely healed the Angels and Demons with the burned feathers still falling he uses each one to create stars</p><p> </p><p>each one connected to one giving the star power. Maze looks up in amazement as for the first time in hell there was light. Lucifer breathing heavily stands from his throne causing Maze to stand at attention. Lucifer says '' I need to sleep have Mammon teach the staff how to do their jobs ''. Maze nods and follows Lucifer as he goes to his room close to the blinds and falls asleep.</p><p> </p><p>14 Hours later Lucifer awakes up to clouds in the sky which makes him confuse until he realizes he got the idea of the sun from the earth which means rain from the waters rose to create clouds. Lucifer sighs and puts his clothes back on growling at</p><p> </p><p>the fact that he has to wear the same clothes. Lucifer pauses in thought thinking '' Why do they have to wear the same clothes. Lucifer stands and heads to his study and writes a message for Ramiel to write a book on clothes and then have the forge angels train demons to make weapons made from hell metals. Lucifer frowns knowing that the hell-beasts can't be</p><p>killed by the demons bare hands the only problem Lucifer doesn't know what metal will kill the hell-beast or if it the metals will work on any being of hell nor his brethren. Lucifer frowns and using his connection to hell summons Balthazar. Lucifer using his connection sees if he can teleport like his father.</p><p> </p><p>Balthazar pov</p><p> </p><p>I was sitting listening to our siblings who were bad-mouthing Lucifer causing a frown to cross his face in realization as he realizes that they are complaining because they were kicked out of heaven. I went to speak when a poke hits him and he feels Hell speak to me causing a smile to cross my face as I walk out and fly towards the king's castle. When he crosses the border he was awe at the site this may be hell but Lucifer can apparently make their hell better than heaven. I fold my wings in and</p><p>walk into the castle only to realize I have no idea where the throne room is when a servant says'' Follow me '' I nod as the servant takes me to the throne room waiting for Lucifer to appear I taking in the room ( picture temple of utu throne room ) when black flames surround the flames and out steps Lucifer who smiles at the look of disbelief on my face. I take a deep breath and say'' so teleportation is that a gift for us all or ...'' Lucifer shrugs and says '' I know you will have to accept me as King '' I nod and ask '' Why did you summon me ''. Lucifer looking at me and says '' I want you to accept training some demons in forging and I want you to become the master of smiths and make armor and clothes for hell ''. I nod and say<br/> '' I will need to go to earth once a century but done. Lucifer snaps his fingers and I feel something change within me and I feel the earth again so I nod at Lucifer in acceptance as Lucifer waves me away. I already started on training and seeing</p><p>what materials hell has.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer sighs on his throne starting his job as King he feels loneliness at ruling alone. Lucifer sighs and leans back against</p><p>the throne to begin his rule as King.</p><p> </p><p>for the next thousand years, Lucifer has ruled with only Fifty rebellions he advances hell into a kingdom with fifty years</p><p>advancement on earth. Lucifer has had many Lovers but none of them were able to hold hell. Lucifer has found some that became his mistress but nothing more.</p><p>Lucifer leans back seeing problems with the human's hell. Lucifer thinking summons the Lords of hell his breathen and the</p><p>Demon Lords and waits for their arrival. Lucifer sits in his throne wearing an obsidian leather jacket with silk pants and leans against the throne as he sees flashes of yellow, blue and green wings flick into the throne room when lightning and flames appears in the room as Demons and angels appear in the room. Lucifer was just watching on as the angels nod and the</p><p>demons kneel in front of him. Lucifer stands from his throne and says '' as you know god has declared that all souls too dark and damned for heaven are damned to hell so we must put systems in place so I have decided that the angels lords will get the souls of those who will be willing to gain forgiveness within the next thousand years but the guilty and those needing</p><p>punishments are the demons as such I am creating doors for each guilty soul which will stay unlock but they won't be able to escape until they no longer feel guilty but those who either committed, Treason, Murder, Rape, child abuse or genocide, and</p><p>Kin killing they will be the demons personally playtoys '' The demon lords smile in joy at the thought of the torture they can inflict. Lucifer sighs in sadness and says '' Father has made Suicide hell bound so they will be protected unless they committed a crime worthy of punishment''. The demons frown for a moment but nod thinking those souls weren't worthy. Lucifer snaps his fingers and every being connected to Lucifer feels hell shift as Columns rise from the ground and a fire lake</p><p>and torture chambers appear as the mansions were section off every section of hell was changed as cell doors and walls appear to show where one section ends and the other begins. Lucifer yells in a demonic voice '' GO FIND YOUR SECTION DO NOT HEAD INTO ANOTHER SECTION WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR I WILL SHOW YOU MY WRATH ''. Every lord of both kinds pale and nods as they go to leave when a guard runs in and whispers to the king. Lucifer face enraged his burned form and</p><p>yells '' GATHER YOUR ARMIES THE HELL BEASTS HAS MADE THERE ATTACK ''. All the inhabitants yell in freight as Arazzel says '' What have they done '''. Lucifer says angrily '' They have capture our siblings ''. The Angels wings flare and they fly out of</p><p> </p><p>the room at top speed the demon teleport away. Lucifer snaps his fingers which summons his armor and weapon then flaps away. Then Dagon smiles laughing at this shakes his head which shows the glamour of Dagon being the king of all hell beasts. Dagon transforms into a huge red skin beast ( I don't know how to describe will give picture ) Dagon laughs as darkness gather around him and goes into a shadow disappearing to his army. Sadly a servant saw it all sent a message to Lucifer.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer was flying to the outskirts of hell the lands where nothing but hell beasts reigns when Hell sent the data to Him</p><p>making him snarl then pause seeing how he can end the fight in one move killing as many hell-beast as possible. All around him he notices his forces start creating command bases and Lucifer says '' You know we do need to expand some so after the battle I will give these lands to our brothers ''. Arazzel nods and makes a note as Lucifer generals walk into the royal tent. Lucifer standing in the center as they all walk in. Lucifer using his new power connects to all his generals except Dagon and explains the circumstance when they start getting angry Lucifer sends an image of them tricking Dagon into leading his forces to death. Amusement comes from them as they understand. Lucifer turns back to the map and points to the ten</p><p>landmarks on the map and says '' Okay here's the plan ( I am horrible at writing war plans so use your imagination ) Lucifer says '' Okay each of you goes ''. Dagon leaves with a smirk as Lucifer sent the real plan to their minds.</p><p> </p><p>Asmodeus was smiling as his men creep up on the campsite and nods at his demon mages who cast illusions spells having the enemy get into position. Asmodeus smiles as he has his mages turn him invisible and then moves toward the heaven water Asmodeus walks up the cliff looking down at the assemble hell-beasts with a smile as he sees the other cliffs become</p><p>occupy. Asmodeus sees the illusion angels run at the demons and starts the fight when those hidden goes out and attacks. then they see Dagon strike Lucifer's illusions which disappear causing Dagon eyes to go wide as Lucifer nods and the angels descend. Dagon's eyes wide with shock yells retreat and disappears breaking for the earth. Lucifer yells to his men to find their siblings he was going after Dagon when Arazzel shakes his head following Dagon causing Lucifer to nod.</p><p>Lucifer pov</p><p> </p><p>I see Arazzel and Dagon fly out of hell and turn towards the fight. Lucifer turns his body into light and shocks the ground where ten thousand Hell-beasts lies causing them to disintegrate. Lucifer bringing up his Dark longsword runs at the demons and bringing out his wings slashes and stabs with his blade while his wings were cutting the hell beasts heads off and ripping them apart. Lucifer ducks as a blade cut one of the heads of a monster when the head grows back causing Lucifer to</p><p>growl and lights up his blade and cuts the head off causing the head to smoke and turn to dust. The head stump was dissolved as Lucifer starts hacking the heads when he stabs the beast killing it. Lucifer looking around seeing his army make quick work of the enemy and rippling them apart when suddenly leviathans appear with pure black eyes and black goo coming from there head with Darkness coming from them and started using the darkness to slash and stab the angels causing them to fall. Lucifer seeing that Stabs the earth causing Light to spread and cause cracks to appear and the light hits</p><p>the leviathans making the darkness recede. Lucifer yells charge at the enemy who seeing it flees.</p><p> </p><p>Hours later Lucifer has made it into the hell beast camp and was swinging and twirling his blades killing the beasts. Lucifer cuts the bonds holding the angels who cry in joy at being free and instantly beg for forgiveness. Lucifer nods and says '' Ramiel have the other lords divide them up I want only ten percent of them the rest is you'll ''. Ramiel nods as Lucifer flys to earth searching for Dagon. unknowing that he was followed by two leviathans who both go to create monsters on the earth.</p><p> </p><p>Earth 20000 BC Egypt</p><p> </p><p>Fishermen were fishing on the Nile when suddenly Light erupts from the water and out flys a man with wings racing in the air. The Fishermen pale look at each other than race to their Sherman and chief.<br/> The fishermen pale seeing black liquid race and hit the other boats destroying and they see the people shake as they are turned into something.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer was flying when he feels Arazzel fading for a moment moving at top speed he sees Dagon kicked a blade into Arazzel who screams as he feels his body being destroyed Lucifer throws a ball of light healing Arazzel body but seeing Arazzel back to hell to heal completely Dagon seeing Lucifer disappears turning into black smoke with Lucifer giving chase.</p><p> </p><p>What will at one point be called Germany</p><p>The Chief of a village looks up as the sun was blocked looking they saw a black smoke moving over the earth drops of black hitting the world as it goes. Suddenly a beam of lightning hits it causing it to disperse for a moment then reappear as thunder hits the world and a hammer hits it where lightning hits it. then a man with sword shining brighter the sun hits the smoke which scatters making the Man scream in rage and cracks to appear in the earth and fire to come from it than the man flys after the black smoke. The People which the black smoke drop on starts shaking as they were each gifted with powers.</p><p>The Black smoke separate starts traveling after humans planning to make monsters before it was trapped in hell.<br/> Lucifer growling chases after the one on the way to what will be called Russia.</p><p>Up in Heaven God feels Lucifer chasing a beast which was making others but then he felt Hell-beasts which was the darkness he ever felt so he ordered his archangels to gather 10000 angels each and go after the Hell-beasts and aid their brother under no circumstances would they fight Lucifer. The Archangels look on and see and feel the evil that was spreading Michael pales and says '' What about the infected ''. God sighs and says '' Like it or not right now they are innocent so I will send Castiel and Ariel and give each of them a choose and a soul hopefully that's enough but they won't be human ''. Michael and the others nod in fear as Michael paling at the thought of what his brothers and sisters are fighting in hell. God seeing it frowns and sends them off. God leaning back against the throne tries to rule it all but with the amount of creativity in the world it was becoming too much. God growls then frowns seeing Lucifer having hell in hand decides to speak to him on how to fix the problems he was dealing with.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer flies to India following Dagon as he infects ten percent of the world population. Lucifer yells enraged as Dagon flies back to Lucifer hitting him in the chest causing him to fly off course falling through the air hitting the earth bouncing off the ground twice and destroying two villages before landing in a field.</p><p> </p><p>The nearby two villages see the Black smoke hit the wingman and watch as the man was thrown into the two villages nearby then they see him fly into a field.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer grunts in pain as a piece of wood goes through his Chest causing Lucifer to groan and slowly stand with the piece of wood shove inside his chest. The Nearby farmer sees that and yells watching Lucifer grabs the wood and pull it out grunt again and then toss the piece of wood to the ground unknowing that the piece of wood turn white and the area became super fertile and the piece of wood started regrowing a white tree becoming the first white oak tree but it was completely indestructible. Lucifer flaps his wings gaining altitude flying through the air chasing Dagon who was pure smoke then watches as Dagon stops and turns to dust which falls and spreads over the surrounding cities. Lucifer stops in confusing feeling Dagon just killed himself for some reason shrugs and watches the humans and their clothing and how they make and sell things frowning seeing it flies back toward hell.</p><p> </p><p>Three years have passed since Lucifer was last in hell when Hell feels its king return all of hell felt its joy.</p><p>Lucifer reconnects to hell feeling his full power return then shakes in pain as his wounds heal and blood drops to the ground in hell which lands in the lake of fire-making a new creation start.<br/> Lucifer landing in his throne room summons Balthzazar and Asmodeus as well as Lillith then sits in his throne.</p><p>It took five minutes for all of them to enter when Lucifer sends the information into their minds making them bow in understanding Asmodeus with greedily eyes asks '' Can you make money for Hell''? Lucifer sighs nodding then creates a version of gold and silver and copper. Asmodeus frowning looks at the Black gold asking '' What is this ''? Lucifer says '' The Black one is Black gold it will be worth 100 silver and 1000 copper the Red Sliver will be worth 500 copper and the Yellow copper will be worth the lowest .. I want Clothing and weapons and clothing to be worth sliver, Food to be worth Copper and Armies and Lords and such to be paid in Black gold. Asmodeus eyes wide nods beginning to sort the money in his mind then frowns asking '' Where do we get more ''? Lucifer snaps his fingers and says '' I made every part of hell have a thousand mines you must fine them I have given you enough for every worker to have thousand black gold the rest you must find ''. Asmodeus smiles and nods heading out seeing his a dismissal planning to start on his duties. Balthazar says '' I assume you want us to start markets in hell everywhere and train them how ''. Lucifer nods saying '' Yes that will be all''. Lillith bows when Lucifer says '' Wait I have need '' Lillith smiles hungry and glad that she will finally be fed again. Lucifer holds his hand up when Lillith went to start as Lucifer says '' I must clean myself first ''. Lillith nods and says '' I know you have Maze aid you but I ask to join ''.Lucifer nods and has Lillith follow him into the bathroom and has Maze clean his body while Lillith cleans his Wings.</p><p> </p><p>Ten weeks later</p><p>Lucifer was laying in bed with Maze and Lillith on either side of him calming down from rounds of sex when Lucifer feels his father summoning him to earth. Lucifer frowning stands and has a servant clean him once done he gets dress and summons Arazzel and Ramiel. Lucifer meets them outside and says '' God is summoning me so I ask you'll to follow me '' They both nod and follow him as he flies to earth and continues toward Greece where he feels his father with Arazzel and Ramiel following him. Lucifer sighs in pleasure feeling winds on his wings being there weren't any in hell. Arazzel smiles and says '' You know you can create wind for hell''. Lucifer frowns then turn towards Ramiel gesturing to make a note. Lucifer turns toward the palace in the sky seeing runes on it making it only god and those chosen can see, touch or land on it. Lucifer frowning says '' Brothers be prepared for anything ''. Arazzel nods and multiplies himself to a million times than flies landing on the platform. Lucifer frowning heads to the throne room feeling pure Light coming from the room than his mother comes out and Lucifer face becomes enraged and he ignores his mother who walks over pleading to listen too when Lucifer yells '' You abandoned us, mother, to be thrown into hell for all of eternity ''<br/> Mother of all angels or Goddess cries and says '' I stood by because your father was angry deeply angry he wanted to lock you in the pits he only cast you'll out after I convince him to be lenient ''<br/> Arazzel and Ramiel grunt at their mother, and says '' If what you say is true then we need prove ''.<br/> Lucifer nods at that as Goddess looks at her children and says '' What must I do ''<br/> Lucifer shrugs and says '' That we don't know but we know you must choose what you care more Father or Your children ''.<br/> Goddess nods thinking leaving so that Lucifer can meet with his father.<br/> Lucifer frowning at that and says '' Arazzel send ten of yourselves to earth I want constant spies on earth so that we can always be 50 years ahead''.<br/> Arazzel nods and sends 20 out saying '' Ten of those I sent back to hell '' Lucifer nods</p><p> </p><p>God sitting in a throne room frowns seeing humans deal with their new gifts watching as those with powers start building cities and fighting wars to gain more power and lands then the doors open and Lucifer walks in.</p><p>Lucifer apprehensive looks at his father and with a feeling of rage yell'' Why did you summon me ''.</p><p>God's hands clenched then taking a deep breath looks at his son and says '' I want to see if you had any ideas on how I will rule ''<br/> Lucifer frowning and says '' Really I okay I know you have billions of realities to rule so I would create domains ''. God Frowning says '' Domains '' Lucifer nods and says '' They should be just under or me and Michael power-wise and each of them would have a domain or element of the universe that he is in charge of they will serve as immortal protectors and rulers of the domain and they will be charged with duties they must do with laws they must follow and they should be essential to the world so that people don't kill them all the time ''. God nods slowly and says '' Okay I will do so '' God starts to shine when Lucifer says '' You need someone to watch over them to make certain they follow but they can't insult them or they will rebel and '' God scoffs and disappears. Lucifer yells '' sooner or later you will need me to watch over them would that day comes I have two demands you must create a throne for the earth which no one will sit on but chosen few and the earth chooses not you or anyone and allow me to have my full power on earth and hell '' the palace trembles telling Lucifer that was kicking them out causing them to fly back to hell.</p><p>Lucifer feels hell's anger at God trying to create a domain that would command them both making Lucifer laugh as the Being was headed towards the bottomless pit of. Lucifer focuses and summons the being who appears in green flames. Lucifer leaning back looking at the being who says '' My name is Tartarus why have you summon me '' he said rudely. Lucifer growls his eyes flashing red says '' Watch your tone '' in a low voice. Tartarus pale nods as he feels Lucifer a thousand times stronger than him. Tartarus says '' I am the embodiment of hell '' Lucifer frowning says '' No I rule and hell has a mind what if you are the embodiment and ruler of yourself ''. Tartarus confuse '' Huh'' Lucifer smiles and says '' What if you're where Monsters and hell-beast go upon death '' Tartarus frowns and says '' As you know I can't keep them '' Lucifer nods and says '' Agree you know you will have multiple of beings with you so they could be their own but you could be the Monster and Hell-beast prison as well as the gods ''. Tartarus eyes wide nods as he realizes that he gets to fulfill his duty ''. Lucifer sighs and says '' As you know more will be created so I am making you Tartarus Lord of Punishment of Beasts and monsters and domains''. Tartarus' eyes glow green as power floods into him. Lucifer says '' Go to your domain ''. Tartarus bowing flies to the bottomless pit where he spreads out and welcomes the others that will rule alongside him becoming a prison for them ''</p><p>Two hundred years later Lucifer was frowning seeing Oceanus call himself a god and banish his children to Tartarus. Lucifer leans back knowing sooner or later God would summon him.</p><p> </p><p>Three thousand years later Oceanus was ripped apart causing Lucifer to feel as Monsters were created as result Air creatures were created making Lucifer frown. Lucifer growling feels God make mistake after mistake hearing from his brothers and sisters who go to earth that the Primordial domains were challenging God causing God to ignore them.</p><p> </p><p>Five thousand years later Lucifer sees A domain reeking of the sky enter Tartarus freeing his brothers taking the fight to the titans. Lucifer shrugs as he feels one of them being an Afterlife domain Lucifer feeling something different and remember that those creatures go to Tartarus but some doesn't deserve it so Lucifer makes a cut in the world and then expands it to serve as the domains afterlife for Demigods and Monsters either undeserving of Tartarus or working for the gods and it would take them ten years to be reform if so while they would be waiting they could be in there ''. Lucifer made it so the domains rule side by side then leaves them to it. Three years later Lucifer feels Hades come to hell and seeking an audience where Lucifer makes him a Lord of the underworld and Creatures. Hades nods and Sets up his kingdom to his liking as other domains come and start setting up alongside them. Lucifer sighs noticing that different monsters were appearing that need there own home so God in all his wisdom creating realms for each of them making the world go off balance. Lucifer sighs at his stupidness and focuses back on hell.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer was summoned because God and his Mother started Fighting and bits of them both came off becoming Fourteen different beings so Lucifer made them the endless each one serving a part of the universe Commanding the larger sense of the dominions in the billion realities freeing God a little so that he has Michael and the others Watch the Domains .</p><p> </p><p>Three hundred years later the Gods Revolt and Michael and the others were trapped and Block from God so Lucifer was summoned. Lucifer looking at his enraged Father says '' Why should I help you '' God yells '' I will destroy you '' Lucifer chuckles saying '' I will just be brought back in hell Leaving you to deal with this '' God taking deep breathes says '' Your Mother with the dominions have captured your brothers will you help''. Lucifer smiling says '' Will you give in to my demands ''. God growls as Lucifer turns to leave yelling '' Yes I agree to your demands ''. Lucifer glows power at 100% percent nodding to God saying '' Per Agreement either I or someone I choose will watch over them'' God nods disappearing waiting for him to fail when only ten minutes later they were freed and his wife was Banished from heaven becoming Mother nature.</p><p>God frowns as his children go to earth to see their mother staying for a week then continuing. It starts getting bored so has Magic give people a connection creating new versions of creatures and Making Magic real for Humans. Then Bans Magic users from Heaven making Magic frown until they Agree to give Lucifer them.</p><p>Lucifer being told of the agreement growls and creates a section ruled by the Hundred Angels who wanted to rule peace so Lucifer orders Magical users and Creatures into that plane giving them their place.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer feels Dagon reunite feeling Dagon start gathering the Army of Monsters on Earth flies after him with One-third of his army.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer landing in an open field billions of Monsters on all sides. Dagon laughs and says '' The great King where's your Army now ''. Lucifer smirks as on all sides The Monsters starts falling Dagon screams in frustration goes to leave when Six Lights come to earth and Lucifer joining them Sends a Beam of Light at Dagon Making Dagon scream as he was unmade then they turn their attention to the Monsters and sends multiple beams of light to each monsters causing screams to be heard as they fall to death.</p><p> </p><p>Hours later the last Monster fell and Lucifer nods at his siblings who disappears with Lucifer gathering his dead and returning to hell where their bodies were placed in stasis waiting to heal.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer sighs in pleasure as he spends himself inside of Aphrodite making her moan and roll over exhausted for the first time Lucifer smiles at the fact for the first time he was sweating Lucifer leans back taking deep breathes waits as Aphrodite falls to sleep. Lucifer looks on either side of them where Maze and Lillith lay sleeping from exhaustion. Lucifer shakes his head falling to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer sighs as days later he was back to a ruling which is when it started becoming too much so he has the lords get together a rule somewhat in his absences then goes to earth where he ends up creating a kingdom and getting followers who were chosen to rule when Amendiel finally took him back to hell after a thousand years. Lucifer every hundred years takes a break which lasts anywhere from 10 to 100 years Lucifer shook his head just watches human children playing around making him frown and sleep peacefully after 24 years he returned to hell with more followers and a wealth of Human lovers who were dead but now in hell because God was petty Lucifer making them his mistresses walks to the throne becoming King once more.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer was walking hell when he feels heaven summoning him so intrigued he heads to earth where a Cult tries to enslaved him Lucifer laughing at their attempts frowns as they throw holy oil and light it Lucifer laughing harder waves the flame away and walks to them and tortures them to the brink then heal them and summons his new pets hellhounds and has them all killed and dragged to hell not knowing there was three left alive who started spreading stories of the devil being evil''</p><p>Lucifer on hearing that was both amuse and enrage deciding to have Arazzel watch and any that commits a crime with the excuse that the devil gets it without drugs or someone making him send them to Hades who puts them in the fields of punishment. Lucifer sighs as he has a few of his male lovers train him in human martial arts and weaponry with the other demons training as well. Lucifer was frowning as Luke flips him to the mat. Lucifer laughs and says '' Good don't stop until we learn all you know ''. Luke nods and trains to become a Bodyguard of the mayor in about a thousand years.</p><p> </p><p>Lucifer was present over a trial where a demon lord tries to rebel with an army of 400000 Lucifer orders another hunt.</p><p> </p><p>After 220 years there were 12000 demons left from the traitor demon lord and Lucifer laughs giving the angels a chance to work off their anger where they bring it down to 200 in 120 years. Lucifer laughing says '' The rest is mine ''. The Demons and Angels watch in delight as Lucifer rips his enemies apart and burns them it took a week but the demon lord was back in chains where Lucifer order him an eternity of torture to be passed around forever. So every five years he has somewhere else and gets torture in new ways as they advance new tortures were created making the Demons fear Lucifer even more while Loving him more.</p><p>Maze was given the next hundred years off to torture the demon where she becomes the greatest torturer of hell.<br/> After a decade of watching the gods, Lucifer ordered Arazzel to take over the task who does so with glee.<br/> and Lucifer has become bored with being a ruler so Lucifer told hell and its lords that he will be gone for at least 1000 years and Flies to earth taking a magic tent which had the ability to duplicate itself which he used to make one in the desert duplicate enough for every inch of the desert can be found and Lucifer stock it with Supplies enough for Thousand of himself than made it bigger on the inside than the outside then he spent the next 800 years finding any people wandering the deserting and dying giving them Food and water than giving them enough food and water to last anywhere from a month to a year than he handles them money with about 100000 and sent them out.</p><p>Legends spread of a Man giving what was needed in times of need.</p><p> </p><p>It has been 900 years since then and Lucifer has been calm thrust far he just sent the latest soul out when Arazzel walks in. Lucifer groans asking '' what is it '' Arazzel hands a folder to Lucifer who reads it and pales and says '' I want you to do what I've been doing until I return. Arazzel nods and sits as Lucifer flies away and heads for his seven elemental brothers upon landing in a clearing Lucifer sees they have Arazel's blade Lucifer begs '' Brother no this please ''.<br/> Brachial smiles at Lucifer and says '' Don't worry brother this won't be the last you see us ''. Lucifer shakes his head as Brachial chants and the others pick it up while Lucifer tries to get to them but something was blocking him making Lucifer scream as they each stab themselves and erase themselves. Lucifer yells as tears well in his eyes and then watches as they dissolve leaving their power and Grace which started to fade. The grace enters Lucifer who feels that their bodies were breaking so now they wish that he has seven humans become their to host and since Humans age and die they will make it where they won't until the humans want to die. Lucifer sighs and nods and spends the next hundred years finding humans worthy of his brothers taking 10 years for each he finds one lord a farmer a soldier a merchant a warlord and two scholars then heads back to the tent where Arazzel turn the tent thing global and says '' This is relaxing you know I can take that job you just did as well ''. Lucifer nods as Arazzel has the job of watching over their brothers vessels and when needed chose new host than Lucifer spends the next 23 years as the traveler after that Lucifer wonders the earth with Arazzel taking over while Lucifer looks at the humans and finds ways to improve hell after 6 years Lucifer returns to hell.</p><p> </p><p>Upon entering Hell he feels hell trying to reconnect when Lucifer shakes his head at Hell and decides to sleep for the next three days before retaking his duties.</p><p> </p><p>That was the last time he returns before his half brother was born then Lucifer spent his half-brother lifetime watching over his brother and return after he went to heaven.</p><p> </p><p>Arazzel watches on earth as Magical creatures were created and each of them has a mythology counterpart but the magical creature was smarter and had a soul the mythical creature had a spirit. Arazzel shakes his head at the damage magical were doing because they didn't know how to control themselves.</p><p>400 years later<br/> Arazzel watches in anger at a King declaring war against an element of the universe so he Watches over soccerers and Makes Kingdom of magic for each and has The new King search for Emrys.</p><p> </p><p>120 years Later</p><p>Magic returned in full force and Emrys was immortal and created Focuses for Magicals giving them away to control themselves. Arazzel smiles at this and Asks Emrys to come with him in his duties as a Spy for Lucifer. Emrys accepts and with the Knights and Arthur follows Arazzel in creating wards.</p><p> </p><p>Thousand years later</p><p>The Wards were known as the wards of Aiblion which had to conquer 85 %of the world and each Magical death 5% of the magic from them power-up the wards making the wards as powerful as Gabriel able to stop Fifty Nuclear bombs before it needs to recharge. Merlin created the Wards and Rituals for Magicals and even gather noble families and gave them family magic giving them the job of watching over Magic and Ruling as Lords of the kingdom creating a council that grew from there. Emrys was crown the King of Magic with Morgana and Freya as well as Nimueh his Queens. Arazzel sighs as they spilt ways so each of them may go to Avalon to rest for a millennium while their bodies were healing from any diseases and Damages hiding them in a pit in hell.</p><p>Arazzel sighing as he sees A Group of Witches and Wizards capture Six siblings and Turn them into Blood-thirsty Monsters the Original family Vampires when he notices the Wolf gene in one of them causing Arazzel to smile at them all.</p><p> </p><p>Arazzel Pov</p><p>I watch as Mikael learns that Klaus wasn't his and speeds off. Arazzel knowing how Mikael works shakes his head and knocks Klaus's siblings out Klaus jumping to his feet pales seeing a shadowy figure. I said '' Hello Hybrid '' Klaus kneels knowing who that was saying '' Yes My lord '' Arazzel smiles and says '' Rise I have much to do ''. Klaus's eyes are wide as I snap my fingers sending a future version to his mind causing Klaus to groan and stand and growl. I look at him and say'' You know to play this right you'll get the girl and your army as well as your family and your kingdom ''. Klaus nods excited as I said '' Oh and your Clan lives go I change the pass Henrik live but Mikael was the cost ''. Klaus smiles and laughs as I say '' By the way Your father's pack lives I would go ''. Klaus's eyes are wide as I say '' I have given you an upgrade go'' Klaus speeds off not knowing that flames were on the ground as he runs. I turn to the others and Hit Esther with a spell causing her Magic to serve Lucifer then having Esther drink a drop of the original blood turns her into the first Vampire Witch hybrid then Looking at the others I gave each of them there deepest desire each of them has there Magic and they could have children but only Three each then I took away their weakness to white oak and change it to Black Silverwood a Metal in hell that most be used to cut their heads off or it will only do like the dagger then I made it so after their head comes off they heal in a year unless their body is burned and they are sent to Helheim I made it so if they are killed there someone in their bloodline dies instead. Arazzel sighs knowing this will cause problems creates four types of vampires the daywalkers which are those from Finn's bloodline the Succubus which was from Rebekah the Twilight Vampires from Henrik, The True blood vampires from Elijah and the other vampires were Klaus's from Mikael was the Angel vampires. Arazzel smirks as he disappears wondering how much that will change the world. Arazzel snaps his fingers and wakes the others up disappearing.</p><p> </p><p>Mikael kills Esther this time in front of the others then turns and disappears yelling '' That he Will kill everything ''.</p><p>Klaus watching it all with a smirk looks startles as Esther wakes up and They give her blood.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>History happens mostly the same except Katherine Marry Elijah and Klaus became King of Supernatural ordering Hunts of the Hell-beasts on Earth and Monsters. Rebekah got together with Stefan in the 20s Finn and Sage were Rich Doctors who cast Glamours on themselves. Damon and Stefan were turned by Katherine when Elijah and she were on a break and then Elijah and the others began a weird family. Henrik was just Hunted Monsters having flings. The Earth Tech was the same except the Magic world was on the 19th instead of the 17th. A King was able to used wards to Create Magical cities and towns making it where they didn't need to go to the muggle world.<br/> Humans knew about The supernatural world creating Organization to deal with it causing Many wars until Henrik took over and train them.</p><p> </p><p>Voldemort Made a Deal with an escaped Dagon and his army taking Dark wizards from hell causing Lucifer to get involved.</p><p> </p><p>Chloe Decker was Born a Miracle but of Magic Parents giving her Angelic magic and Wizard Magic.<br/> At the age of 24, she joins the Supernatural Force and Rose to a Detective.</p><p> </p><p>The Gods were fighting against their enemies once a decade. Having Children and stuff.</p><p> </p><p>A Prophecy was made</p><p>A Child of Magic A Child of the Sea A Miracle join forces for eternity as The Barriers are destroyed and Darkness reigns The King of Hell comes to Earth and Shall Join them as King and take the throne Forevermore while Light falters and replaced taken by brighter.</p><p> </p><p>God hears the prophecy sighs preparing for war. God pausing uses his power to look at Lucifer's Queen sighing he awakens her power completely. God growling as he was forced to make it where Lucifer isn't mortal near her.</p><p>God shook his head as the angels look at their father '' My children an evil is coming as of now the dominions are about to face their enemies the titans but we have never face this an enemy capable of rivaling my powers with children equal to your so prepare and prepare''. Bowing every angel leaves as his right hand asks'' And Lucifer ''? God sighs '' We need him on our side ''. Amenadiel breathes deeply as he stands and leaves God's Throne room flying toward earth to gain his evil brother back where he belongs. God frowning groans as Michael stands next to him '' Father Amenadiel will just make ... God yells '' I know but when I gave you free will each of you makes your choices what am I to do ''. Michael frowning says '' Let us do stop him ''. God nods and says '' No this is you ''. Michael bows his head as he goes to stop Amenadiel flying after him. God frowns as he realizes that his children couldn't be trusted so teach them he strips them of their vessel on earth forcing them to use a human but it must be consent. God leans back only to frown as he realizes Lucifer was considered a god because of the deal so all he did was give him a power boost if he uses Sam as his true vessel. God groaning he makes it only Demons with permission and serving Lucifer can be without a vessel then he leans to let it play out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lawrence, Kansas<br/> 22 years ago<br/> These scenes are definitively dated to 2 Nov 2005.<br/> Crickets chirp.
