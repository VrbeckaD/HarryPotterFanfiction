    <p>Ch. 1<br/>
"Albus, you can't be serious!"</p>
<p>"I agree, is there truly no one else?"</p>
<p>"He said he would teach? He's really coming?"</p>
<p>Albus smiled a conciliatory smile at the conflicted staff. "Filius, Minerva, I am indeed serious, and you do not give Mister Lockhart enough credit. I assure you his resume speaks for itself. He will make a marvelous defense teacher for the upcoming year."</p>
<p>Minerva scoffed and had she a tail, it would no doubt be twitching in agitation.</p>
<p>Severus wondered if it was the result of her animagus, or if her inner cat was born from her innate characteristics. He quickly grew bored of that train of thought as well. He did not know who this Lockhart was to cause such a stir at their typical mid-summer meeting, but to be frank he did not give a damn. That was the third time that series of questions had been posed to the Headmaster. A brain dead hufflepuff would be able to answer that, yes, whoever Lockhart was, he was coming to teach, and no there were obviously no better candidates.</p>
<p>He stood from his seat just two chairs down from the Headmaster. "If this is to be the entire contents of this meeting, I humbly ask to be excused. I believe there is grass growing outside in much greater need of my attention."</p>
<p>If Albus noticed his tone, he did not show it. "Of course, Severus my boy, the chlorophyll is in fine form the afternoon! That will be all for today. Remember to send your text and supply lists to Minerva by the first week of July," he called after his exiting faculty members. A handful strode out angrily while some of the more youthful, feminine of the professor tittered eagerly among themselves.</p>
<p>Severus quickly swept out of range, already looking forward to the inevitable departure of Hogwarts' newest, and as yet unknown, professor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus' first indication that said new professor would be more trouble arrived as a letter from one of his more academically inclined seventh years. She had forwarded him a copy of the mandatory texts list for Defense.</p>
<p>"Magical Me...by Gilderoy Lockhart, Waltzing with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart, Seducing Sidhe by Gilderoy Lockhart, Vanishing Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart, Bedazzling Bowtruckles by Gilderoy Lockhart, Holidays with Harpies by Gilderoy Lockhart. Oh, and what is this? Debating Darkness with Dementors by none other than Gilderoy Lockhart." A quick Incendio proved the ridiculous list to be very much flammable.</p>
<p>He almost pitied Miss Jiggers who was no doubt thrown herself into a tizzy at the prospect of another year with incompetence, her NEWT year at that. While he himself had seven different professors of defense during his time in Hogwarts, none of them displayed this level of… self-absorption, even if they were supposed masters in their field.</p>
<p>He grabbed a quill from his desk and began to write. It seemed his syltherins would require supplemental tutoring, once again. His history as head of the snake house extended back for nearly seven years, and standing faculty for roughly two before that. Lockhart would hardly be the first imbecilic defense instructor his precious time must be spent to compensate for, and he'd be damned before he let any student disgrace his house with a Troll.</p>
<p>He signed the letter with imposing flourish and cast a duplication charm.</p>
<p>"Ollam, come," he called his owl. The creature was abnormally old and had a habit of glaring and snapping unprovoked. He and Severus got along well.</p>
<p>His customized Defense list went into the envelopes with the Slytherin prefect badges before he sealed them up and sent Ollam off to their recipients. They'd know to further distribute his note among the younger years. Severus only hoped this year would be less tiresome than the last.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Naturally, it would not. Dragging two students behind him by the ear – one an incorrigible red-head, and the other a bespectacled menace – he swept into the great hall, black robes snapping behind. A wave of silence descended in his wake. A nervous looking blond fainted to his left. The feast had just finished as he swept passed the house tables commanding, without effort, the attention of the room of previously sleepy, satiated students. Severus spared a challenging glance at the third member of the troublesome trio, who fidgeted in place. She was no doubt debating whether her know-it-all brain could get the two out of trouble for their most recent bout of life endangering mischief. He'd like to see her try.</p>
<p>Severus approached the Headmaster with a cool, unruffled mien. Inside, however, he cackled with glee. Underage driving, underage magic, breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Expulsion – suspension at the very least – was imminent, regardless of the Boy-Who-Lived's fame.</p>
<p>"Headmaster, I have found our missing miscreants. Perhaps we should--" What in Avalon was that pink monstrosity? It was so bright even from the corner of his eye it nearly blinded him. A man set next to Hagrid bedecked in a soft pink robe over an ensemble of fuchsia pants and a fashionable magenta vest. Severus, with all his expertise in distinguishing color tones for brews, could not begin to name all the shades of garishness the man draped about his person.</p>
<p>That was Lockhart? He could finally comprehend his colleague's horror earlier in the summer. He composed himself before his verbal stumble could become a full choke. "—should retreat to my office to discuss disciplinary measures."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Severus," the Headmaster said greeting the missing second-years with more amusement than the severity of the situation deserved. "Minerva, are you finished.</p>
<p>"Yes." Her tone at least was clipped. She drew herself up from the table, and the glare she leveled on her two lions almost brought the anticipation back to his heart. Alas, he was distracted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the highly disappointing meeting that followed, the boys were set free with nary a slap on the wrist. After their departure, Severus shut himself in his quarters in desperate need of a drink. It was embarrassing to be outmaneuvered by gryffindors. He should have been able to get them a semester of detentions and sent the lion house into the negatives with that stunt. Instead, they were to be bustled to Madame Pomfrey then sent to the kitchens for a late dinner.</p>
<p>"Growing boys need to eat, Severus." He snarled and threw back the rest of his drink at the memory of the Headmaster's words.<br/>
It couldn't be helped, he defended. A vial of Sober-Up was placed on the bedside table as he settled in for the night. Severus allowed himself a small reprieve from the castigation. After all, it was difficult for one to assemble effective pro-expulsion rhetoric when attempting to blink spots of pink from his vision.</p>
