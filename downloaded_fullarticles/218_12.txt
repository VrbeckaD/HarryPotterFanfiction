    <p align="left">The sound of the fine, misty raindrops is blasting the roof of their balcony this early Saturday morning. She curls herself against him seeking for the warmth of his bare broad torso. As soon as their bodies glued together, he stretches his hand to her waist, embracing her tight and gently. He loves to spoon her and feeling her tall slim body in his arms. They both love the weekends because there is no fuss over who gets to shower first, who has to be the one who has to prepare the breakfast before they both off to work separately until the dusk of night or who has to leave the other’s apartment. Right now, his bed is the only square surface that matters the most. She can feel his left hand roaming around her body and stops at her nipples, caressing them gently. He peppers kisses on her shoulder and the back of her head and neck. His erection is slowly growing against her back so she turns around to face him only to hear his low grumbling voice pairs with his sleepy eyes and dopey smile on his face.</p><p align="left">“Good morning,” she said while caressing his face.</p><p align="left">“Morning, love.”</p><p align="left">Newt kisses her tenderly at first before deepening it when she tangles their feet together. He then moves on top of her and begin to discard her shirt. Tina motions for him to remove his pants as quickly as possible, as they bask in each other’s stark-naked presence. They explore each other as soft moaning comes out from both of their lips. They couldn’t have this everyday as their lives are so hectic with endless works and expectations from their top undisputed bosses who only want to make their lives a living hell. They would probably be ‘crucified’ if they found out that one of their best associates is sleeping together. What’s worse is that both of their companies are rivalries who currently share the same spot of the top publishing firms in the state. Their dalliance is most definitely forbidden and unprofessional. They love each other for three years now but they couldn’t afford to lose their job at the moment as both needed the money and at the same time, love the challenges that come with the job. Not to mention, it is kind of hot to sleep with the enemies. At least, that’s what they think.</p><p align="left">The sound of their skin slapping each other echoes in the room, muting the sound of the heavy rain outside. Tina lies on her back as Newt pounded her deep and hard. She can feel his cock penetrating every inch of her pleasure as she squeezes him closer with her arms and legs. He plays with her nipples with his mouth, causing her to panting as his thrusts grow deep and erratic. She came hard and loud but that does not stop Newt from chasing his own bliss. He kisses her as she pushes her feet against the bed to allow him even more access inside. He moans her name as he came and she caresses his face when they kiss passionately one more time. He falls on top of her and peck her nipples while resting his head against it. The rain is still pouring heavily when Tina strokes his hair as their bodies are tousled together in the afterglow of their sex.</p><p align="left">“Tina, we have to tell them someday. I’m tired of hiding you away from my life.”</p><p align="left">“I know. But today is not the day.”</p><p align="left">“Are you scared?”</p><p align="left">“Of Picquery? Not at all. Are you scared of him?”</p><p align="left">“Not as my boss. I’m just scared that he might not accept you in our lives. Theseus IS my brother. I don’t want to lose you Tina.”</p><p align="left">“I don’t want to lose you too.”</p><p align="left">They lie together that way for the whole morning, staying in their comfortable cocoon. Acknowledging their relationship to the public will cause a disastrous result for them both professionally and personally. Those are the concerns that they have been avoided for the past three years and they know that one day, they eventually have to let people know the nature of their relationship. But as they lay in each other’s arms enjoying the serenity of that rainy Saturday morning, Newt knows that Tina is right. Today is not the day.</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="left">That night, they decide to go out from the city to enjoy each other’s company, avoiding their colleagues’ prying eyes. Newt is wearing his favourite long dark blue coat paired with the deep brown vest that Tina gifted him on his birthday. Before that was the yellow tie that she also got him for his previous birthday. By this point, anything that she gifts him will eventually be his favourite thing in the world. He tries to keep his tousled brown hair intact with numerous hair products but nothing seems to work as it keeps flaunting down, nearly blocking his right eye. After almost thousands of attempts at fixing it, he gives up and let them be however they want to be. After all, Tina adores him that way. She’s currently in the bathroom, getting ready as well. He peeps at the door and is mesmerised by how the curve of her body is popping out by the black skintight dress she chooses to wear. Suddenly he feels a tight sensation inside his pants. He looks down and sees his proportionally huge girth protruding against his zippers. <em>Fuck.</em> He said in his mind. He is trying to cover it up by stretching his pants as if that would make it any difference at all.</p><p align="left">“Newt?” Tina is looking at him through the mirror. She has done her makeup and hair, opting for a simple look that she usually wears. She also feels like letting her hair down that night. She knows that Newt likes to play with her hair when they cuddle. It doesn’t matter if she stylised them because they don’t need to reach home before the hair will fall down first. He tends to let her hair loose when they start making out in the cab or in the park on date nights. Right now, she looks at him curiously after hearing him curse by the door. It’s adorable how surprised he looks at her everytime she catches him unexpectedly looking at her.</p><p align="left">“It’s everything okay?” she asked him.</p><p align="left"><em>Shit. Did he say it out loud? </em>“Yes. Just some issues with the zipper.”</p><p align="left">“What wrong with it?” she walks to him now, eyes darting straight to where the zipper supposedly be, only to find his hands cupping his erection. “Owh. Mr. Scamander that is a hugeee problem right there.” Her eyes do not leave where the thickness is currently occupied. Instead, she licks her own lips and lies back at the sink, enjoying the view in front of her as she watches him slowly unzips his pants.</p><p align="left">Newt takes his large erection on his hands and begins to pump himself gently. His blue eyes stare at her with passion and fire while each thrusts project soft moans of pleasure from his mouth. Tina’s wicked smile makes his movement erratic and his whimpers turn into a primitive grunts that he sometimes let out everytime she lets him fuck her from behind. She doesn’t even need to say anything to him. Her physical appearance is enough to make him feel like this.</p><p align="left">“Don’t you dare cum,” she says while scooping herself up to sit on the bathroom counter. She lets the shoulder straps down and plays with her hard nipples. She doesn’t even bother to put on her bra, knowing it will come out few hours later.</p><p align="left">“Newt. Come here.”</p><p align="left">His body doesn’t move but his hands never stop. She lifts up her black dress to show him her wetness underneath. Without waiting for another invite, he lunges himself at her. Pants already discarded, he takes off her underwear in one swift motion. He leaves the dress on though. He wants to see her come undone in that close-fitting dress. His erection goes inside her deep, that she feels his presence occupying her fully without space. Their lips touch as he stays buried inside her. When she deepens the kiss, that’s when his hips moves, slapping their skins together. His movements are wild and her needs are catching up fast. He grabs his nipples with his mouth as she the sound of her loud moan breaks the silence of his apartment. He comes undone right after she does. It warms her heart that he always put her needs first. That’s one of the reasons why she loves Newt. He looks at her with longing and adoration. She flutters him everytime she catches him in an uncompromising situation. He doesn’t need to feel ashamed of himself whenever he’s with Tina. She accepts him the way he is. That’s why he is head over heels for her.</p><p align="left">They dress themselves and look at one another afterwards, smiling until it reaches their eyes.</p><p align="left">“Is it too late to go out now?” he asks her.</p><p align="left">“It’s never too late for anything, Newt,” she answers landing a peck on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">           </p><p align="left"> </p><p> </p><p>           </p>
