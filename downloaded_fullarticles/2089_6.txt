    <p>January 27th, 1927</p><p>What had happened? Everything was so...blurred out. Immense pain pounded inside my head as the bright sunlight entered the room, which was quite big now that I noticed with slightly more opened eyelids. As my eyes adjusted to the light, they also adjusted to take in my surroundings. An infirmary. What in the hell happened to me to end up in such a place?</p><p>"I see you have woken. How are you feeling?"</p><p>A man's voice came from my right side. Slowly, I turned my head over ever so slightly, eyes making out what at first was a blurry image of a man, but now after adjusting, he sat there clear as day. Worried blue eyes stared into my squinting grays. The man had a full beard, well kept, and wore a grey vest with matching trousers. Who exactly was this man? Perhaps he knows what happened to me.</p><p>"Too bright. All of it. May I ask...who are you exactly?", I asked with quite a raspy voice. I clear my throat in hopes of sounding a bit more kept together.</p><p>"Albus Dumbledore. I am a professor here at Hogwarts. That is quite an interesting accent you have. Just where are you from Miss...well, now that I have told you who I am, please do tell me who you are. Fair trade, wouldn't you agree?", he asks with a cheeky smile, elbow on his crossed leg, chin in hand.</p><p>"I'm Farah. What is a Hogwarts? I'm sorry, but, that sounds like a disease If I'm to be honest.", I answer with a clearer voice this time. He lightly chuckles, then sits up all the way, tilts his head to the side and looks at me with the warmest eyes. Perhaps I just find them warm because no one has looked at me with kind intentions in ages. </p><p>"Oh dear, Hogwarts is not a disease. It is a school, more specifically a school for witchcraft and wizardry. Now may you please tell me where you are from to not have heard of this school?"</p><p>"Oh, I see. And, ehm, I am from everywhere really. I travel a lot. I grew up amongst the stars. My accent is due to speaking so many languages and dialects. It is somewhat in my blood to know them all.", I say in upmost honesty. His amused expression jumps to confusion, then right back to amusement. When I only stared back at him with a look that said 'I am seriously serious', his face goes right back to confusion.</p><p>"You did hit your head earlier...this must be an aftershock.", he said with a sigh, mumbling the last part to himself. I open my mouth to argue back, however he beats me to it. "No no, you get rest now. I want your mind to be in the right place when Mcgonagall and I talk to you later. Rest well Miss Feera.", he says, then gets up to leave. As he is walking back, I notice a small green...creature on the back of his shoulder.</p><p>"Dumbledore!", I call out for him, and he stops just before going out the big doors, turning his head and looking at me with a raised brow. "There is a...twig looking creature on you." He looks confused at first, then looks down at his shoulder and his eyebrows rise in surprise, then relax with the smile forming on his face.</p><p>"Ah yes, thank you. Newt must be looking for this little fella. You rest now. I will be back in an hour.", he responds, then leaves out the big doors. What was that little creature? Who is Newt? Also, who is Mcgonagall? I realize my headache is only getting worse as I ask myself too many questions, and so I shut my eyes. I suppose resting for a bit will do some good. </p><p>________</p><p>18:00 </p><p>I find myself slowly being awoken from my deep sleep by a soft voice, soon able to hear the words clearly.</p><p>"Come on Farah, I need you awake for me."</p><p>"Perhaps she needs to sleep for the night."</p><p>"It is only six in the evening. She must eat soon anyways."</p><p>The two voices went back and forth for a bit. I knew one was Dumbledore, however, the other was unfamiliar. A woman's voice. My eyes finally decided to open, although not struggling as much as last time due to the room being less lit up. A groan escapes me as a sharp pang of pain attacks my head, eyes squeezing shut. Firm hands grab my shoulders, and I slowly open my eyes, only to meet them with those same blues.</p><p>"Are you alright? Is your head bothering you?", he asks with concern very clear in his tone. </p><p>"Yeah.", is unfortunately all I could mutter at the moment. He looks down as if thinking deeply, then let's go of my shoulders and holds out his hand.</p><p>"Albus, are you sure she can walk? Oh, I am sorry dear, I must introduce myself. I am Professor Mcgonagall.", the young women turns to me with a smile. I manage to nod in acknowledgement and smile back, words not being able to properly leave me.</p><p>"I will help her arranged room, and then the dining hall later. You must be hungry, yes?", he asks as I grab his hand. He helps me up to my feet. It is just now that I notice what I have been wearing. I am dressed in soft white pijamas with matching slippers. Since when was I stripped out of my clothes and put into these? Still so many questions I have.</p><p>"Ehm, yes. I guess I am. Thank you.", I say as he puts a hand on my back, guiding me to walk towards the doors along with him. He hums in acknowledgement and we soon make our way out of the doors and into a big hall. I see some children and teens in these long black robes lounging around. Witches and Wizards is what I'm guessing they are. "Is this a cult school?", I ask out of curiosity, but mostly humor. </p><p>"Heavens no. That's not exactly my taste. Trust me, you will love Hogwarts after I show it to you.", he says with a reassuring smile. I nod in agreement and speak no more. We make our way to a smaller door, compared to the ones of the infirmary at least, and he leads me inside. It is what seems to be a dormitory, however, quite grand even though from the outside it would have seemed to be small. "In the closet is clothes I arranged for you. I took measurements earlier, so no worries about the fitting. I will be outside your door in an hour to escort you to dinner. Till then.", he says, then takes his leave.</p><p>Â </p><p>He...took my measurements?<br/>
______</p><p>19:00</p><p>He may be a cheeky man, but I have to admit, Dumbledore's got style. He had arranged on the right side of the closet what seemed to be white button-up blouses and grey skirts. Was he expecting me to study here? I'm far too old to pass as a student, perhaps just a seventh year at most.</p><p>On the left side were beautiful gowns. One in particular caught my eye, and so I pulled it out and my eyes went wide. A long, deep navy blue, satin gown with a long cape attached. Simply stunning. He really does have taste. However, I put it back and remember that it is just dinner, not a banquet, and so I look in the middle rack of the closet towards the more casual clothes. After some peeking here and there, I choose what seems to me as appropriate.</p><p>A long wide-sleeved blouse in a beautiful deep maroon, and a loose black chiffon skirt that fell to my mid-calf. I topped it all of with little black flats that were on a bottom shelf along with other shoes.<br/>
I would have to thank Dumbledore for treating me, a complete stranger, with such kindness and consideration. Perhaps a gift from Diagon Alley?</p><p>I refresh my face and give my teeth a quick brush in the bathroom, then brush out my hair. I really do need a hair cut. This long nuisance has been going on long enough. Someday soon. I whip up a quick charm that braids my hair down my back.</p><p>After my hair, I examine my face. My under-eyes are just...horrendous. I don't see any makeup anywhere, although I don't really expect to since Dumbledore said he was the one that arranged everything, however, a small object does catch my eye. Sitting on top of the drawer is what seems to be a lipstick tube. I pick it up to examine, and then twist the cap off, revealing a deep brownish red. Perfect.</p><p>__</p><p>About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and so I went to answer. There stood Dumbledore in what was now a deep purple set of trousers and a vest, along with a black shirt underneath. His smile, cheeky as ever, put me at ease, and so without a word, I leave the room and walk with him down a random hall of the school. </p><p>"I don't know if you have done this, so it may seem a bit odd, but just trust me.", he says this while holding out his hand. I look down at his hand, then to his eyes with a raised brow. I sigh and take his word for it. The moment I placed my hand on his, I felt an intense gust of wind and in one second, we are outside these grand doors. Feeling a bit of whiplash, I close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose, hoping for some comfort.</p><p>"Never do that again.", I say in the most serious tone I could muster, but fail miserably when a light-hearted laugh leaves me. </p><p>"Hm, I think not. You'll get used to it, I promise.", he says with his cheeky-as-ever smile and leads me to the doors. They automatically open as if on queue, magic of course, and my eyes go wide at all of it. Lit candles float from the ceiling, long tables filled with various types of dishes, and beautiful decor as well. If only I had the chance to attend such a school as a child. Although, I don't remember any of my younger years. The thought turns my face from fascination, to stillness and sadness. Dumbledore must have noticed because he pulls me to the side into a corner, also letting others pass by.</p><p>"What's bothering you?", he asks, with now the most serious expression I've seen from him all day.</p><p>"Small thoughts. They don't matter much. Let's sit?", I answer, in hopes that he won't push anymore questions. He raises a brow and hums in disapproval, but gets the hint at my discomfort and holds out his arm. I interlock mine with his, and soon we are sitting at one long table at the very end of the dining hall, facing all of the students. Feeling a bit self-conscious by being front and center of so many strangers, I look down at my lap, avoiding any awkward eye contact. </p><p>"Chin up, they don't bite, and neither do I. What would you like to have this evening Miss Farah?", he asks while leaning his elbow on the table, chin in hand facing me. </p><p>"Well, I don't eat meat. So anything that isn't that will do."</p><p>"I see. A vegetarian are we?"</p><p>I chuckle lightly and nod. At least he hasn't judged me, like so many others have. </p><p>___</p><p>Soon after dinner is over, the students have gone off to their house lounges or some already off to bed. Dumbledore and I take the long way by walking back to my room. Thank gods; I wouldn't want whiplash two times in one day. Dumbledore suddenly stops in his tracks. and turns to me with a rather serious expression.</p><p> âFarah, I know you most likely do not have anywhere else to go, but I feel a great potential in you that I cannot explain, so I am asking, will you stay and learn here at Hogwarts? I know that you are some years in age over the eldest students here, however, I can make it work for you. I just have this feeling."</p><p>"Dumbledore, I-"</p><p>"Albus. Call me Albus for now, however, in class, you must address me as Dumbledore.", he says teasingly with that smile of his. "What do you say?"</p><p>"I'm willing to try. Thank you, Albus."</p><p>He took a deep breath in, perhaps as a sign of relief in my answer, and his smile couldn't possibly get any wider, but it did. </p><p>"I will make sure that Hogwarts treats you right. Tomorrow, we will see just how much magic you know. Meet me at my office at eight in the morning."</p><p>"Eight? In the morning? I'm sorry Dumble-, I mean Albus, but I can't possibly wake up that early."</p><p>"Then I will come to you. Good night Feerah.", he says all too fast and gives me a small wink, then apparates away. This man, I swear...</p>
