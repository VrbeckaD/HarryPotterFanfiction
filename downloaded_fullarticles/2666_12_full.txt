  <strong>
    <em></em>
  </strong>
  <em></em>
</p><p>
  <em>The first time he sees him the first frost of the year has touched the ground but melts away from the flowerbeds at high sun.</em>
</p><p>A knock on the door pulls Draco from his work. He’s written almost half the day already and his fingers are cramping but he’s <em>nearly </em>done. One romantic, heart-shattering installment left to submit before his novel series is complete. Waylon leaps from the desk as soon as he hears the offensive ring of the doorbell followed right after the knock, sloshing cool, forgotten tea all over his parchment. Draco rolls his eyes as tea blends the words <em>frost </em>and <em>flowerbeds </em>together. He shakes his head and stands, wringing the tension from his shoulders with two hard rolls of his neck and back.</p><p>“Just a moment,” Draco calls to the door.</p><p>Instead of spelling away the liquid, Draco gently lifts his parchment and pushes his quill aside. He takes a bit of crumpled napkin he’d used as a plate for his biscuits and dabs at the spreading tea, catching any droplets before they can smear any more of his ink. He’s done this enough to not let it bother him anymore. Anyway, these are merely Draco’s drafts. He’s due to meet with his editor later in the coming months to go over any revisions before his book is submitted for publishing. From there, someone else will be given the task of transcribing every single word, anecdote, and metaphor to a high class, leatherbound book in which they’ll be sold in muggle bookstores around the world.</p><p>Large yellow eyes flick to him with disinterest before Waylon, his spoilt, unmagical - but you'd better not breathe a word about it, and entirely too self-important cat blinks at him from his feet. The slinky, tea-spilling black feline is hot on Draco's heels all the way from his desk, across his plush carpet, down the hall, to his front door. He lets out an impatient chirrup when Draco doesn't get his hand on the knob of his dark oak door fast enough.</p><p>“Careful, Way,” Draco coos, using the toe of his shoe to gently wedge himself between the door and Waylon. “What have I told you about strangers?”</p><p>The man standing at Draco’s door when he opens it, well the back of the man, is clad in a dark khaki green uniform that almost reminds Draco of a soldier. He’s got on black combat boots and a matching khaki hat is so snug over his head that black curls spring out angrily from under it and for a moment, Draco wracks half his brain for any of his past offenses that would have brought the muggle armed forces to his house. The other half he allows to stow away the tight pants grip the man’s firm arse in just the right ways, perhaps for a future novel. He glances to the left and right where he finds both neighboring houses quiet before he clears his throat.</p><p>“I apologize for making you wait,” Draco says calmly. “How can I help you?” He keeps the door cracked just enough for him to stick his upper body out while keeping Waylon at bay with his lower half.</p><p>The man turns and Draco has to think quickly before the man notices Draco’s jaw on his fucking doorstep because standing right in front of him holding a small package with the words <em>Amazon </em>written all over it is Harry <em>fuck</em>ing Potter.</p><p>While Draco tries to remember how to breathe, in and out, he thinks, Potter meets his eyes briefly before gesturing with about as much disinterest in Draco as Waylon after he’s finished dinner to the package he’s holding. “Morning, you’ve got a package.”</p><p>With about as much elegance as a fish out of water, Draco snaps his mouth shut with a click before nodding with too much enthusiasm and not enough composure. They stand there looking at each other long enough for Draco to see that no, he isn't crazy and yes, Harry Potter is standing on his doorstep waiting for him to take his newly ordered desk lamp. Shoving his arms forward with as much indifference as he can possibly muster, Draco accepts the package.</p><p>“Thank you,” Draco says, keeping his eyes trained on Potter’s face. Surely he hasn’t forgotten Draco? Draco annoyingly hasn’t forgotten Potter. Well, he had compartmentalized Potter to somewhere at the back of his brain and sat him happily at the top of the stack of other <em>things </em>that reminded Draco of a life he could never partake in and caused him to grind his teeth at night. The truth was, Draco hadn’t actively thought about Potter in years and the sight of him in a post delivery uniform, staring oddly at Draco as if he is about to raise a hand to feel the temperature of Draco’s forehead bothers him more than it really should. But then Potter isn’t looking at him anymore, isn’t squinting his emerald eyes at him anymore, is turning to walk back down Draco’s porch steps and back to his boxy truck. <em>Wait</em>.</p><p>“Uh,” Draco blurts with enough ineloquent to make him cringe. “Good day.”</p><p>Fucking “<em>Good day</em>?” Who the hell is he? Mary Poppins?</p><p>Potter turns and quirks his thick eyebrows at Draco. “Bye,” he waves awkwardly before gripping the rail on the side of his truck and trapezing in. He’s down the street before Draco can recover.</p><p>
  <em>The next time he sees him the days have become shorter and winter’s chill has become insistent. He’s nervous but he isn’t afraid. This time he’ll make an impression that’ll last a lifetime.</em>
</p><p>When the knock comes Draco is expecting it so he snatches he tea up before Waylon boomerangs from his desk. Only one piece of parchment falls to the floor. He smooths his robes, grey and smart, while he stands and makes his way down the hall to the foyer.</p><p>He has no idea whether Potter will be the one to deliver his second lamp today, a lamp he absolutely does not need, but he's hopeful. He'd lasted an entire month before caving and placing another order. Really, Draco can't be surprised. He'd hoped that he'd be able to neatly tuck away the image of Potter in his stupid uniform and stupid truck away for good and simply forget about it. The problem is, nothing ever comes simply to Draco. So here he is, opening his front door to swing wide this time, keeping Waylon at bay with the back of his ankles, clutching a half-full cup of tea, and staring at Potter's unbothered face.</p><p>Waylon meows at Potter, happy to see a new face for Draco’s lack of company.</p><p>“Is that your cat?” Potter asks, ever obviously, craning his neck to take a closer look at Waylon. Draco shifts on his feet so that Waylon can squeeze along the doorframe and out onto the porch. He steps out carefully and sniffs the cold air before deciding it isn’t overly offensive and paws over to Potter. His paws leave perfect little melted prints with each step he makes towards Potter.</p><p>“He is,” Draco replies, smiling a little with the corner of his mouth when Waylon coils himself between Potter’s legs and rubs his silky black cheek into Potter’s khaki pants. Draco lets the lopsided smirk linger momentarily just as he would have the characters in his novels do, knowing the air of confidence it portrays. The air of confidence Potter’s so easily robbed him of.</p><p>He placed his order earlier in the week in hopes of proving to Potter, though he’s got nothing to prove to anybody, that he isn’t actually completely pathetic as he’d appeared on their last run-in. The bottom line is, the last time Draco had really <em>seen </em>Potter had been one of the lowest times in Draco’s life and he wants to show Potter that he’s doing better. <em>Actually </em>doing better. Potter had been the Auror to pick Draco up after another wizard, the one who’d busted his lip and cracked his ribs, reported a badly beaten wizard in an alleyway in the heart of muggle London. Somewhere he’d presumed to be safe. He’d been working as a tailor in a muggle suit shop at the time, unable to find work in the wizarding world. He’d closed up shop quite later than he normally would due to a couple of leisurely, cigar-smoking businessmen.</p><p>The fact that Potter had limped him to St. Mungos with an apparition that'd made Draco vomit as soon as they'd landed had not been what had humiliated Draco the most. It was that Draco, after a year of being so careful, after being as kind as he could, after writing apologies so long his hands were blistered from the quill, it still wasn't enough. It would never be enough. He would never be enough. He'd known that deep down after the war. But he'd let himself forget and let his guard down. An investigation into Draco's attack hadn't even taken place. Draco hadn't needed another hint to get the message.</p><p>Draco wanted to prove to Potter that he was okay, even if he was living full time on the outskirts of London as a muggle author. Even though <em>he </em>wasn’t the one delivering the post in muggle neighborhoods.</p><p>“He’s so soft,” Potter smiles, bending forwards to pet the purring cat. Draco notices that his hat is missing and looks down to see if the man even has gloves on in the nipping weather. He doesn’t. Potter doesn’t even have a proper jacket on. Only the long sleeves of his uniform cover his arms. <em>Idiot</em>, Draco thinks, <em>but an opportunity</em>.</p><p>Draco takes the package from Potter’s hand so that both are free. Potter immediately rubs both hands into the long fur of Waylon’s back and Draco chuckles politely. “He likes you,” he smiles. Potter looks up and returns Draco smile warmly as if he’s forgotten all the horrible things Draco’s done, as if he doesn’t even <em>remember </em><em>who Draco is</em>.</p><p>Or perhaps Draco’s made a terrible mistake and this isn’t actually Potter. Well, he certainly can’t just ask “Are you Potter, Potter?” can he? He doesn’t want to seem completely barmy. Potter interrupts before he can wrestle a decision from his mind.</p><p>"I like you too, er, well I don't know your name do I?" he stutters, looking at Waylon, and actually scratches his head. Draco can see the exact moment Potter realizes he's spoken before thinking.</p><p>“Waylon,” Draco provides, using this moment to look at Potter again, hard this time. Messy hair is there, browned skin, thick eyebrows, a slightly confused yet carefree expression worrying his face, thin lips, broad shoulders, green orbs. Yes, everything is there. Except - Draco bends down slightly and tries not to be too obvious as he peers up from Potter through his eyelashes. <em>The scar</em>. It hides dubiously behind a stray curl that dances over Potter's forehead. This man is clearly Harry Potter or polyjuiced.</p><p>“What a pretty name you’ve got,” Harry coos and Draco just about loses his mind because it’s just so <em>not on</em>. How is it that Potter hasn’t even acknowledged, been so utterly oblivious, to Draco and is now standing on his porch delivering his useless second lamp, petting his cat, and complementing its name.</p><p>“Would you like to come in?” Draco blurts, desperate to ask the questions swirling in his head he’s been raised to politely ignore. “Tea’s on.”</p><p>Potter is taken aback. Draco sees right away confusion etch itself into Potter's features, his eyes growing comically wide. If this wasn't so absurd Draco might laugh and then hex his own mouth shut for lack of control over it. Potter stands back up straight now to gaze at Draco levelly. Draco supposes it isn't every day that homeowners on Potter's mail route ask him in.</p><p>In fact, Draco’s not really sure why <em>he’s </em>asked Potter into his private space besides the incessant need to know just what the hell is going on with Potter and why on earth he’s even delivering packages on Draco’s street. And it is only polite to interrogate a fellow bloke when his bollocks aren’t turning into ice chandeliers in his pants.</p><p>Something flashes in Potter’s eyes but is gone before Draco can quite catch it. Then he’s speaking again. “I have a route to get back-”</p><p>“Of course, forgive-”</p><p>“But that is really nice-”</p><p>“It was highly inappropriate of me-”</p><p>“No, I’m on a tight schedule-”</p><p>“You just don’t have the proper clothes-”</p><p>Potter stops. “What?”</p><p>Draco’s cheeks flame momentarily before he pulls himself together and gestures to Potter’s clothes before he turns his nose up slightly. “Well, it’s hardly the middle of summer and you’ve got no coat,” he points out. When Potter narrows his eyebrows at him Draco tries again, lowering his chin so that he doesn’t look like <em>such </em>a pompous arrogant git. “I thought you might be a bit cold.”</p><p>“You thought I…” Potter begins and if Draco has to hear Potter repeat the mortifying explanation again he thinks he might hurl.</p><p>“Never the matter,” Draco attempts to smooth himself. He draws his tone so that it is one of complete indifference and conceals the utter embarrassment that he’s feeling because <em>of </em><em>course </em>Potters got a route because he’s <em>working</em>. "I'm sure I'll be in need of something else delivered. Perhaps then." And with that, Draco scoops Waylon up as he meows loudly in irritation, digging his nails painfully into Draco's shoulder where he's been slung and turns on his heels so fast his head spins. He slams the door behind him and leans against it breathing heavily. He looks a mess really. He's got tea sloshed over his right hand - dripping - where he spun too quickly, a package clutched to his hip, an and angry cat mewling unhappily atop his shoulder. His breaths come out in annoyed huffs at his own brashness.</p><p>He remains against his heavy oak door for a long while and bathes in embarrassment, repeating the conversation. Several long minutes pass before Draco groans in frustration and looks at Waylon who’s dove from Draco’s shoulder to his feet.</p><p>“Yes, you don’t have to tell me,” the blond says. “I know I’m an idiot.”</p><p>Waylon chirrups in what he can only assume is agreement.</p><p>Draco is startled by the protesting heave of an engine starting up just outside his house. Daring to peek out the curtains of his foyer he sees Potter’s delivery truck winding once again down his street before coming to the halting realization that: Potter was there the whole time.</p><p>
  <em>Third time's the charm, they say. Whilst he lacks not in charm he only hopes he can be enticing enough to steal the attention of a man who’s overlooked him for so long.</em>
</p><p>Two weeks pass before Draco orders his next lamp. But it isn’t until that afternoon that his doorbell rings.</p><p>“You’ve gotten quite a lot of packages lately,” Potter greets with a, <em>Merlin</em>, teasing smile when Draco answers the door.</p><p>“Going through my mail are we?” Draco raises an eyebrow. Potter doesn’t need to know about that Draco’s already cleared away space in his spare bedroom to make room for his new lamp. Right next to the second one that’s still in its box. Right next to Draco’s brain because he’s clearly misplaced it the way Potter laughs at his snipe. “On the contrary, I can hardly believe you find three packages excessive?”</p><p>Potter considers this and Draco almost misses the way Potter's green eyes move over his body. He pats himself on the back for his choice in attire. Form-fitting brown trousers coupled with a cashmere sweater. He's left the top button undone to expose the dip in his collarbone. The brown tones of his clothing make the glittering blue and yellow flecks in his grey eyes stand out and Draco knows this. Apparently so does Potter, who's now looking at his face as if seeing it for the first time.</p><p>Draco doesn’t know what he, Draco, is playing at but it seems to be working. He just needs to butter Potter up a bit, tease him a little, soften his edges and then he’s going to fucking <em>pounce </em>and finally get some answers.</p><p>"No," Potter allows. "However, three within two months, when you've never ordered anything prior, seems - suspicious."</p><p><em>Of course</em>, Draco thinks. Potter, an Auror, has been sent to spy on him. That is the only reason Potter’s been driving up and down Draco’s street. He’s trying to get dirt on him. Well, there isn’t any dirt to be gotten and suddenly Draco feels a bit led on.</p><p>“Is this an investigation then?” Draco bites coldly and moves towards his door.</p><p>Potter’s eyes widen then narrow at him. “No!” His hands come up as if to halt Draco’s assumptions physically. “It was a joke. Just a joke.”</p><p>“Ah,” Draco hums and feels the air go a bit awkward and stiff around them. “It wasn’t very funny,” he says because he can. He wants to fuck with his head, make Potter squirm, for embarrassing him. Potter’s always been so good at fucking with Draco.</p><p>Potter shuffles and his eyes shift to the package he's holding on to his hip. Draco notices the man has again forgotten to bundle himself up properly. He wonders if Potter is using warming charms.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I made you upset.”</p><p>“You didn’t.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Draco's front porch is so quiet and the space between them seems so small and cozy yet so charged and distant. They are mere feet away from each other but it feels like miles. Like it's always been. He takes a small comfort in that. At least if Potter was going to pretend he didn't know Draco and their very rich past <em>didn’t </em>happen he couldn’t deny the way their current encounter has settled them gently back into the throes of their long written incompatibility. They just can’t get on. They just can’t.</p><p>He steps forward slowly so that he doesn’t provoke Potter and extends a hand for his third lamp. “Best have that.”</p><p>“Right,” the other man concedes. He meets the blond in the middle and pushes the package into Draco’s waiting arms before stepping back. A hand smaller but broader than Draco’s own sweeps Potter’s curls from his forehead in haste giving a small glimpse of his faded scar. It makes Draco’s stomach twist in guilt for being so snarky with the man. “Where’s your cat, Waylon, was it?”</p><p>This surprises Draco and he’s sure his own eyes are wide now. “He’s just inside,” he motions halfheartedly towards the door.</p><p>“So, I’m coming in then?” A smile curves charmingly at the corner of Potter’s lips as he asks like he knows already he’s throwing Draco for a loop.</p><p>This is the part where Draco smooths everything over with his mask of calm and collectivism and replies with something witty. “Oh.”</p><p>“Tea?”</p><p>“It’s my bloody house!”</p><p>Potter really laughs then, deep and warm, his head tilting back as he leans into it. “Best put the kettle on then.”</p><p>So the kettle goes on and somehow Draco has prodded and poked just enough to get Potter into his living room. The specy man sits on Draco's leather loveseat as he owns it and Draco can't help but admire and wretch a bit at how quickly he's settled in. He almost looks like he belongs.</p><p>Draco is thankful that his manuscripts hide in his office because he's just realized that he hasn't decided just how much he wants to share with Potter. See, in his head, he'd never thought he'd get quite this far. But now that the kettle is just about to squeal Draco feels as though he's about to as well just out of his own sheer idiocy. Really, did he expect to pry information from Potter without sharing a bit of his own?</p><p>So Draco begins as politely as he can. “How long have you been a postman?”</p><p>Potter’s eyes roam around Draco’s living room as he answers the question and somehow Draco isn’t quite convinced that this isn’t an investigation. “Few years, two or three? You?”</p><p>“I’m not a postman,” Draco smirks because he’s an arse, that’s why.</p><p>Green eyes roll dramatically before, “You know what I mean.”</p><p>Draco thinks Potter is purposefully not saying his name because he was half expecting <em>Malfoy </em>to follow but it doesn’t. “I write.”</p><p>“Write what?”</p><p>"Books," Draco says cooly. The kettle finally does squeal then and Draco is saved from elaboration to prepare their hot drinks. He makes Potter's tea the way he'd seen Potter make it at Hogwarts many years ago. A splash of milk and just enough sugar to rot one's teeth out. Whoever thought all his years of watching, envying, the man from afar would pay off?</p><p>When the raven-haired man receives his tea from Draco he slurps it lewdly before letting out a contented groan. "I haven't had a cuppa this good in years."</p><p>Pleased by Potter’s excitement over a mere mug of tea, Draco smiles. “Oh?”</p><p>If the blond squints a bit it looks like Potter’s smirking. “Yeah, not since school.”</p><p>It is in this moment Draco knows he’s being baited. Potter stares at him intently as if he’s daring Draco to ask the question that’s threatening to escape his lips. Of course in a normal conversation, this would be the part that Draco continued their small talk with ‘which school did you attend?’ but now, faced with the opportunity to get some answers, he finds his lips cemented shut. Because if Draco asks then this facade is all over. The rouse is up and Draco will be Draco again and Potter with be Potter. And Draco isn’t quite ready for that. Part of him feels like he’s being given a second chance impression on Potter and he absolutely cannot budge it up this time.</p><p>So instead Draco says, “Well, I’m happy to treat you to a proper cup, then.”</p><p>The slight frown is wiped from Potter's face when Waylon bounces onto his lap and he has to raise his teacup in the air to keep it from spilling over. "Watch that, or you'll end up wearing English breakfast," he coos to the cat.</p><p>“An ungodly amount of tea has been spilt upon this floor,” Draco admits, not that one could ever tell.</p><p>"You'd never guess. The carpet is spotless, like magic," Potter laughs when Waylon begins kneading his thigh. Draco pauses mid-sip just as a small piece of the Potter puzzle nuzzles itself into place. He hums in response because apparently, they're going to continue this waltz without either of them saying what they really mean. "So how long have you lived here?" Potter gestures around Draco's living room with his khaki-clad arms and teacup.</p><p>“Few years, two or three?” Draco echos Potter’s exact answer from earlier boldly earning a sidelong glance from the other man. He’s just taken an unforeseen step in their dance.</p><p>The tension in the air grows too thick and Draco can almost see Potter trying to string together a proper response. “You’re very vague,” he settles with a sigh.</p><p>The tea isn’t as appealing on Draco’s caught tongue. He’d been bold but he didn’t expect Potter to be so outright about it in return. “And you’re quite interested,” Draco reminds.</p><p>"Fine," Potter amends, suddenly impassive and inscrutable. Then, to Draco's surprise, he stands and dislodges Draco's cat. "I didn't mean to pry."</p><p>He knows his eyes are about as wide as dinner plates when he sputters, “You’re leaving?”</p><p>He feels as if they’re just getting started. His palms are sweaty and his heart is beating fast because this is absolutely <em>not </em>the Potter he remembered and he doesn’t know if he can take it. He knows without a shadow of a doubt the old Potter would never be able to resist a blatant challenge from Draco and now he’s just leaving?</p><p>Potter sets his teacup down on the coffee table next to the loveseat. "I have to finish my route but the tea was lovely," he grins softly before adding, "And the company."</p><p>Draco would’ve likely fallen over if Potter hadn’t been speaking to a purring Waylon who winds around his ankles.</p><p>They walk to the door slowly. Potter's still in his uniform, of course, reminding Draco that they both have a job to get back to. Draco's job does not include being a sleuth, unfortunately. The khaki material is as thin as ever but covers Potter's browned skin all the same. He seems unbothered by the gust of cold air that wafts in when Draco opens the oak door. Waylon meows in protest at the fleeting visitor.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you,” Potter bends down to scruff the fur around Waylon’s neck. “If your dad here keeps his ordering up I suspect you’ll be seeing me again.” Waylon purrs and purrs and purrs. “Hopefully he’s gotten you plenty of nice treats.”</p><p>Something twists funnily in Draco’s chest at Potter’s words and he’s smiling before he actually realizes. The whole thing is oddly domestic.</p><p>“Until next time?” Draco asks when Potter steps over the threshold.</p><p>“Until next delivery,” Potter laughs with a nod.</p><p>Potter turns and steps down the front porch while Draco watches, his chest suddenly clenched tight. It doesn’t seem right having to wait and <em>pretend</em>. Draco’s so fucking tired of waiting and pretending. Right now he just wants, and that’s the only thing holding him to the spot right now, watching Potter’s hand grip the handle to his truck.</p><p>“Wait,” Draco blurts into the quiet night. A soft breeze ruffles Potter’s hair when he turns. He raises an eyebrow. “Have dinner with me.”</p><p>“I don’t know if that’s a good idea,” Potter says, his tone gentle in a way that makes Draco feel he’s being let down easy.</p><p>“We can talk then, properly.” The desperateness in Draco’s voice makes him wince. But hasn’t he always begged for Potter’s attention?</p><p>Potter sighs and gives Draco a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Okay.”</p><p>
  <em>Dressed with his heart on his sleeve he unravels in ways he’s never done before, opening to the man before him with the surprise and ease of an unforeseen kiss.</em>
</p><p>The next time Potter is over Draco hurriedly deposits his fourth lamp in his spare bedroom and trampolines back into the kitchen before his noodles boil over. The doorbell rang just as Draco had cracked the uncooked strands, sending odd bits of pasta all over his countertop.</p><p>Potter eyes the stove warily with a look of disbelief and amusement as Draco stirs and sniffs and sifts and spoons. Draco hasn’t said as much as a rushed greeting to Potter before whisking his lamp away. That’s because his nerves are doing a funny little thing where they just sit in his throat and threaten to choke him every other sentence. He doesn’t know what he was thinking, perhaps he isn’t, and that’s why he’s bent over his stove making Potter dinner.</p><p>He's not sure what's ensnared his attention with Potter but something about it feels incredibly familiar and it's almost like he's coming home. Except for this time he doesn't want to punch Potter, he just has the inexplicable urge to be near the man and figure out this perfect conundrum. And seemingly so, making dinner is the best strategy to be in Potter's presence just a bit longer.</p><p>"Forgive me," Potter smiles when he catches a whiff of alfredo sauce just as Draco lifts the lid of the saucer to give it a stir. Steam seeps out and wafts around his small but smart kitchen. "I would have brought wine but I can't really have that on the truck without looking like an alcoholic."</p><p>Mustering up as much bravery as he can, which shouldn’t be that difficult considering he’s a grown fucking man, he lifts a shoulder before turning his chin towards Potter. “You’ll just have to help me finish this then,” he says casually. “To make up for your utter uncouth and disrespect towards alcoholics everywhere.”</p><p>Potter laughs at this before stepping over to Draco’s sink, rolling his khaki sleeves, and washes his hands. “What do you need, chef?”</p><p>Draco snorts. "Chop the chicken in that pan just there," he points with his wooden spoon. Potter does as he's told, nicking a utensil from Draco's rack without asking. He sets to work, strong hands looking suddenly delicate and careful as they cut into the savory chicken.</p><p>“So,” Potter begins with an air of nonchalance. “First tea, now dinner? Someone might think you’re a man after my heart.” He stops slicing to look sideways at Draco with a thick black eyebrow raised, damn him. He shakes his head, dislodging the curls obscuring his vision just to have them flop back down. “Or you’re just exceptionally hospitable to your postmen.”</p><p>Draco watches Potter’s eyebrows quirk up at him again waiting for an answer. “Garlic cloves. Second cabinet to your left. Third shelf,” he orders. “There’s a step-ladder in the pantry if you need it to reach.”</p><p>Potter scowls.</p><p>They take their dinner in the dining room where Draco’s sat at the head and Potter claims the seat adjacent. Plates are filled and wine glasses are emptied as Waylon takes turns winding through and around their legs.</p><p>“This is great,” Potter smiles, twisting his fork to gather more noodles. “You’re an excellent cook.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Draco sips his wine and places his hand on the table so their fingers brush. Potter stares at his hand for a long moment, his eyes going a bit wide before they meet Draco’s again. “Four times you’ve been to my house now. I had to express my appreciation for all your hard work in some way.” He removes his hand to pick up his fork again. The contact was minimal and fleeting, but there nevertheless.</p><p>A beat passes between them and Potter’s visibly flustered, perceivably caught off guard by Draco. After a minute Potter rights himself. “So?” The man looks as though he’s waiting to ask Draco why exactly it is that he’s been invited to Draco’s house for dinner but he also looks as though he knows the answer already.</p><p>Draco swallows but nods, pushing his plate further away from him. “Go on then.”</p><p>“Anything off limits?” Potter asks. “Anything we can’t talk about?”</p><p>Draco racks his brain for a moment. The problem is the number of unsafe topics they could discuss while delving back into their offensive past far outweigh the safe topics. Potter is unsafe and everything about him that is related to Draco's life is absolutely unsafe.</p><p>“Perhaps adolescence?” Potter frowns briefly but nods anyway. That effectively closes off a large chunk of crossover in their lives. But Draco’s suddenly aware that he doesn’t really care to discuss the past too much; he likes who he is now far better. “And perhaps we should take this to the drawing room?”</p><p>Potter wastes no time in making himself comfortable on Draco's large sofa. He's sat at one end, leaning against the armrest.</p><p>“So, what do you do for a living?” Potter raises a hand when Draco goes to say he’s already answered that question. “And just saying ‘write books’ doesn’t count.”</p><p>“I write romance novels,” Draco concedes and continues when Potter’s eyebrows raise and disappear behind his fringe. “I never saw myself as a writer growing up but after I found myself a rather difficult time fitting in elsewhere I decided to give it a go. Plus, the list of things I <em>didn’t </em>want to do was much longer than the list of things I did. It started out as an escape, a stress reliever if you will. I rather enjoy it."</p><p>Seemly satisfied with his answer, Potter shifts sideways on the sofa where he’s sat next to Draco and nods. “How many novels have you written?”</p><p>“Two. I am in the middle of the third now.”</p><p>“So is it a series then or three different plots completely?”</p><p>"I suppose you could call it a series," Draco nods. "It's become more than I expected if I'm honest. It started out as a simple story I wanted to tell and quickly became an all-consuming project. Do you like to read?"</p><p>"I might be interested," Potter puts a finger to his lips and the right corner lifts minutely. "Though I've never been good at reading. I enjoy it sometimes but prefer something to the point. Yours must be a long love story. Three books you said?"</p><p>“Indeed.” Draco regards Potter with curious eyes, not quite able to picture him reading leisurely. “Sometimes it just takes people a while to find each other.”</p><p>The next silence that passes between them is tangible and causes Draco’s stomach to twist inside him.</p><p>"You don't seem like the type to write romance," Potter says finally after a drawn-out breath.</p><p>“And you presume to know what type I am, do you?” Draco drawls.</p><p>“No,” he admits. “It’s just your suave when I delivered your first package didn’t scream new age romantic to me. But after being wined and dined tonight, I’d consider myself pleasantly surprised.”</p><p>Its Draco’s turn to blush now, and he does behind the wine glass he lifts to his lips. “That’s me told, then.” Potter’s laugh rings out loudly now and bounces obnoxiously off of Draco’s walls. He finds himself smiling at the man’s shaking shoulders and aims to make Potter laugh again sometime soon. Once Potter’s regained a shred of his dignity Draco asks his own question. “Have you always been a postman?”</p><p>Potter settles back into the cushions now. He stares contemplatively at Draco for a long moment and something gives. Draco isn’t sure what until Potter speaks again.“No actually, I used to be an Auror. Mostly low profile undercover work.” Something passes over Potter’s face and Draco watches his whole body tense into a grimace. “I quit after two years.”</p><p>Draco finds that he can relax a little now that he and Potter aren’t participating in this strange waltz of divulging pertinent information whilst ignoring the erumpent in the room.</p><p> He sits forward a little and angles his body toward the other man. “Why’d you quit?”</p><p>“Too much bigotry.”</p><p>Draco asks the question he already knows the answer to. “In the Ministry?”</p><p>“Especially in the Ministry. Too many people unwilling to move on, unwilling to forgive.” Potter sighs. “Justice doesn’t play favorites. At least not for me.”</p><p>Draco can't hold in the small snort that escapes his lips - maybe it's the wine because that sounds so much like something Potter would say and it's the first thing he's said that actually sounds like the Potter that Draco knew so well. The familiarity it brings is almost comforting.</p><p>Potter is looking at him so oddly he wonders if he’s got a red mustache on his face from the wine. Potter’s eyes are narrowed slightly as if squinting at Draco will make things clearer somehow.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Draco puts a hand over his mouth to hide his lingering smile. “That wasn’t funny. Just so heroic. And profound. Mind if I use it in a story?”</p><p>Potter rolls his eyes and stands. “Alright, you wanker, you’ve had your fun.” The grin on Potter’s face is warm and genuine, like joking around with Draco comes as natural as breathing. “I best get going,” he says, regret clear in his voice. “Early route in the morning. I’m sorry I can’t stay longer. I feel like I barely got to ask you anything.” He frowns at his bulky boots.</p><p>Draco stands too, facing Potter. “I’ll be sure to order something soon if that’s what it takes to see you again,” he pauses and has the sense to add, “to quench your thirst for knowledge of me of course.” He’s being a bit clingy but for Merlin’s sake, this, being with Potter feels <em>so </em>nice and Draco hasn’t had someone enjoy being in his company for so long. He doesn’t want this to be the last time Potter is in his house, drinking his wine, eating his food.</p><p>“How about I just owl you?”</p><p>“Oh, thank fuck,” Draco exhales. “I’m running out of space for desk lamps.”</p><p>Potter laughs loud and deep causing a grin to tug at Draco’s own lips.</p><p>“You think I’m joking.”</p><p>Potter extends his calloused palm for the second time in as many weeks for Draco to take.</p><p>The world feels like it's tipped on its side ever so slightly, just enough for Draco to notice the shift, before it rights itself. And when it does it's like he's seeing Potter for the very first time. Blazing green eyes that look like pools, light dusting of freckles over his cheeks and nose, a faint scar just at his cupid's bow, hair that curls wildly around his face, framing it like a black halo. Draco doesn't know what passes between them then but it's something Draco will never forget.</p><p>The other man looks at Draco as if he's all he sees at that moment and Draco's heart stutters in his chest. As if Draco is special, important, as if he cares. His eyes burn into Draco with earnest. "Thank you for dinner and a wonderful night. It was really nice talking to you."</p><p>Draco extends his own hand. He grips Potter’s hand gently in his own, warm and strong. “Likewise.”</p><p>Potter’s blushing when he takes his hand back and begins walking down Draco’s front steps. On the last step, he turns back to regard Draco with one last look before hoisting himself into his truck and careening down the dark street.</p>
