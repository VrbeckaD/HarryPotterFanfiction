Until Kingsley introduced her to the Doctor. When they touched hands, the two immediately were attracted to each other.</p><p>She liked the distinguished, older-looking man at the controls. They had become friends with benefits as she taught him her magic, and he let her go through his library. They become close, and Hermione was afraid that one day they would grow apart from one another.</p><p>The Doctor looked up and saw Hermione was thinking hard about something. He went over to her, wrapped his arms around her, and kissed her. "Hermione, you can stay with me for a long time if you want to! There is an entire universe out there to see!"</p><p>"Really?
