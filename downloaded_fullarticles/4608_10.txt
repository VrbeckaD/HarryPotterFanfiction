<p> </p>
<p>When Harry opened his eyes, he had no idea where he was for a moment. He lay in the bed, covered in sweat, tangled in the sheets, and listened to his own ragged breathing as he tried to get his wild heart under control. It was so dark in the room that when he raised one hand in front of his face, he couldn’t even see it. The only light, in fact, was a blurry sliver.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He pushed his damp, sweat-slicked hair away from his forehead and realized that the reason the light was blurry was because, of course, he was not wearing his glasses. As he fumbled around on the table beside him, flashes of the dream that he had just been wrenched from bubbled up to the surface of his mind, fleeting but terrifying all the same. Voldemort had been there, certainly; and Nagini. And someone else, someone familiar. At the thought of this shadowy figure, fresh fear filled him, but it had a different taste to his own fear; it was bitter, smoky, and deeply weary. He was not afraid of that familiar figure, but afraid for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The glasses slid onto his face, slightly crooked on his nose. He straightened them, and looked around, and felt silly. He was in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, of course. He could see that now. The slight crevisse of light was coming in through a crack in the curtains the two pieces didn’t quite meet. It was so bright that it must be nearly a full moon. Now that his eyes were adjusted, he could see the contours of his bed and the other furniture in the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sat up, and yawned. Downstairs he could hear voices, the creak and thud of people walking about. Was there an Order meeting? At this time of night? What time was it, anyway? He slid his feet out from under the covers and placed them on the floor, which felt blessedly cool. Reaching around on the table again, he found his wand and cast <em> lumos </em>. The clock said it was five in the morning; so not so late at night, at all, but very early in the morning. The light coming through the curtains must not be the moon after all, but the first glimmers of dawn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stood and stretched. He needed to use the loo. Opening the door to his room as quietly as he could, he tiptoed across the landing to the bathroom; did what he had to do, then just as soundlessly returned to the landing. He paused near the bannister. The noise of people had quietened. The meeting, if that’s what it had been, must be over; the sounds he’d heard were probably everyone leaving. He wondered what it had been about?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suddenly he was desperately thirsty. He wondered if everyone was truly gone from downstairs; could he creep down to the kitchen and get a glass of water? After a long moment of listening for any sign of a presence, he decided to risk it. Anyway, this was his godfather’s house; he was allowed to go and get some bloody water if he wanted to, wasn’t he? Still, he felt a bit as if he were trespassing as he stole down the stairs, skipping the fourth and ninth ones because they always, without failed, creaked like a dying cat when you stepped on them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The kitchen was indeed empty, but showed signs of recent habitation. Empty glasses, with traces of what smelled to him like liquor, were by the sink. Mrs. Weasley clearly hadn’t been at this meeting, or she would have done the washing up, he thought, and smiled. He opened the cabinet and removed another glass, then turned on the tap and filled it with cold water. He was so thirsty that he tipped it back and drank it all at once. Then, as he was bending over to fill it again, he glanced out the window over the sink -- and that’s when he saw Snape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His potions professor was in the back garden, lit only by the stray glimmers of rising sun over the horizon, pacing back and forth. Harry watched him, frozen, for a moment. What was he still doing here, lurking around the grounds? Why hadn’t he returned to Hogwarts? What was he up to, anyway?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry put the glass he’d been drinking from on the counter. He felt for his wand, where he’d shoved it inside the waistband of his pajama bottoms. Then he turned and fled the kitchen. In the hallway by the front door, he found his trainers where he’d kicked them off, damp with snow and mud, last evening. He put them on over his bare feet, shivering a little bit at their coldness. Then he grabbed his jacket and pulled it on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the back door, he paused. What was he doing, exactly? Snape was a trusted member of the Order -- well, trusted by some, he supposed. He had a right to be here, as much as it begrudged him to admit it. But -- this was peculiar behavior without a doubt. He had to know what he was up to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carefully, he turned the doorknob and pulled it open, then slid through and immediately ducked down behind one of the bushes that bordered the house. To his great relief, Snape -- who was standing only ten or so feet away, near the far border of the garden -- had his back turned and didn’t seem to hear anything. Harry curled up in a ball, braced his back against the side of the house, and tried to be as still as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape turned back towards the house, and walked aimlessly in that direction. He looked as though he were waiting for something -- or someone. When he reached the center of the garden, he sighed, then reached around inside his robe and removed something from an internal pocket. It took Harry a moment to recognize what it was, because it was simply so unexpected: a packet of cigarettes -- Lucky Strikes, to be exact. Snape slid one cigarette out of the packet with practiced ease and returned the rest to where it had come from; placed the single cigarette between his lips, cupped his hands around it and muttered something out of the corner of his mouth. A light flared between his fingers and he withdrew one of his hands, inhaling deeply, before taking the cigarette between two curled fingers and letting out a long breath, and with it, a stream of smoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now Snape began to walk a circuit around the garden, punctuated with long draws on his cigarette, the embers glowing like a deep, red gem. He rolled his shoulders and sighed; looked at the horizon, cursed, and shook his head. He walked over to the stone wall that bordered the garden, leant his elbows on it, and hung his head. And then he was still, waiting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was nearly ready to fall alseep at this point, the sooty smell of cigarette smoke both disgusting and oddly comforting at the same time. And then the door next to him -- the one he had just quietly exited -- opened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He almost shouted, but bit his lip in time, so hard that he tasted blood. A figure emerged from the house, shrouded in the darkness of the house’s shadow, and then stepped out into the garden. In the dim light of early morning, Harry quickly recognized him: it was Kingsley Shacklebolt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape looked back, and also recognized him, but did not look as surprised as Harry felt. Still leaning on the stone wall, he turned away again and said, a little reproachfully, “You took long enough.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley smiled. “Sorry. Albus had a lot to say on the matter.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape snorted. “I’m sure he did.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s only because he cares, you know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And he knows you know that I should know it, I’m sure.” What on earth did that mean, Harry wondered. Why couldn’t Snape just talk like everyone else?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley approached him, hands in his pocket. “Those’ll kill you one day,” he said. It took Harry a second to realize that he meant the cigarettes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape chuckled darkly. “I should be so lucky.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reaching out one hand, Kingsley placed it, heavily, on Snape’s shoulder. Despite the lack of contact, there was something so weirdly intimate about the gesture that it made Harry’s face burn hot, and he wasn’t sure why. “None of that, now, Severus.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape turned his head to one side, away from Kingsley. Harry could see his face very clearly at this angle. His eyes, dark as always, looked truly bottomless. Maybe it was just an effect of the light, but Harry thought they looked -- sad, almost. There were dark circles under his eyes, and Harry wondered when he’d last slept. Then he wondered why he cared. It was only that -- well, in this moment, Snape looked almost human. Living, breathing, exhausted, vulnerable. He looked like Harry felt nearly all the time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But Snape closed his eyes, pushed away from the wall, and stubbed the cigarette he’d been smoking out into the stones. “There,” he said, and turned to face Kingsley. “Are you happy now?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kingsley grinned. “Not yet,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then --</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, Kingsley Shacklebolt leaned in and -- and <em> kissed </em> Severus Snape, right on the lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stared at them, those two interlocked mouths, as unlikely, it seemed to him, as Snape giving fifty points to Gryffindor. It could not be real. Perhaps this was another dream, and he’d never risen from his bed at all; or maybe he had in fact fallen asleep, crouched here in the bushes, and Snape was still pacing aimlessly around the courtyard, and everything else that had happened -- including this, especially this -- was a product of his own weird imagination. Severus Snape, the terrifying spectre he knew, could not possibly be kissing, with apparent abandon, fine, upstanding Kingsley Shacklebolt, who was kissing him back as though his life depended on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry blinked. He pinched himself profusely. He closed his eyes and counted to ten, and when he opened them, they were still standing there, in the dead, winter garden of Grimmauld Place as the sun rose, embracing. Their mouths had parted, at last, but their faces were still close, very close. Snape was saying something, so softly that Harry could barely pick up on it, but he thought it was something like, “And are you, now? Happy, I mean?” And Kingsley replied. “Yes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He took one of his Snape’s hands then, and shook his head. “But you -- you’re freezing. Like ice!”<br/> </p>
<p>“It’s your fault. You’re the one who kept me waiting,” Snape replied archly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, then,” Kingsley said, and pressed his face close to Snape’s ear, and said something Harry couldn’t make out, but which made Snape smile, in a way he’d never thought Snape’s face was capable of -- a little shy, a little amused. He let his head fall forward and rest against Kingsley’s shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All right, I suppose,” he said, and Kingsley laughed, full-throated, and wrapped an arm around Snape’s thin shoulders. He led him along the wall and through the gate towards the path beyond, that led along the side of the house, to the front garden. As they passed by the bushes, Kingsley turned his head and stared straight at the spot where Harry was hiding, and then, carefully, so that Snape wouldn’t notice, raised one finger to his lips and winked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, frozen with shock, waited as they disappeared around to the front of the house, until he heard the telltale <em> pop! </em> of Apparition, signaling their exit. Then he let out a tremendous sigh of relief and relaxed, bonelessly, against the house. Instantly, he swore and stood up, brushing off the prickly brambles of the bushes he’d been hiding in. He fought his way out, then wandered over to the wall where Snape had been standing moments before. There was the cigarette, half-smoked and stubbed out, still giving off a whiff of nicotine. It was real. That had actually just happened. And he’d been seen -- though he hoped, based on Kingsley’s light-hearted wink, that Snape wouldn’t find out, or there would be hell to pay. As it was, just the thought of speaking to either of them made his face flame with embarrassment. Classes with Snape this spring would be awful -- and oh Merlin! Occlumency lessons! What if Snape saw that he had seen? He clenched his fists and squeezed his eyes shut, and willed the memory away, pushing it far into the back of his mind. He’d just die if Snape knew. He was positive. He could never know.</p>
