          <div class="userstuff"><p>The stepstool gave a slight lurch forward as Harry tried to reach the last apple on a branch. </p><p>A whizz of a spell stabilized the falling wooden contraption just as a worried voice called from behind him.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing, Potter?” Severus was standing right behind him, his wand drawn. “Ever heard of spells?”</p><p>Harry smiled guiltily and turned to face Severus, the golden yellow apple clutched in one hand. </p><p>As the stepstool wobbled again, strong arms grabbed his waist and pressed him to Severus. Harry looked down at Snape.</p><p>“Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?” He showed Severus an apple which almost caused his downfall. </p><p>Severus just sighed, looked up at Harry with a disapproving smile and held him tighter. </p><p>Harry smirked. “Now I can kiss you without craning my neck”. Staying on a stepstool Harry was several inches taller than Severus. </p><p>“You certainly can.” Severus said softly. </p><p>The sunny apple fell into the grass.</p></div>
