    <p>James made his way down the train corridor with Remus and Sirius, looking for Lily. Since he met the redhead four years ago he had been enamoured with her. He did everything he could think of to get her attention but nothing seemed to work. She had zero interest in him and it showed in every way. Maybe now that he had his classification she would be more interested. That's what he hoped anyway. The summer gone, he'd presented as an Alpha. He was delighted, so were his parents. </p><p>The summer going into the fourth year of school was hard for every teenager. It was the year that fifteen, going on sixteen-year-olds got their classification. There was some science behind it but what James put it down to mostly was: puberty. September was always an exciting time for fourth year Hogwarts students because they got to find out what classification their friends all got. There was five main classifications, Alpha, Omega, Beta, Cargiver and Little. Beta's were the most common out of the five but Omegas and Alphas were tying in for a close second. Caregivers and Little's were a bit less common but for that reason they were more important. Caregivers were a lot like the other three classifications in that they progressed normally through puberty and had normal relationships that lead to marriage and even kids if they wanted. Little's were a different story. When Little's get their classification they instantly become more protected. The ministry has a section dedicated to looking after Little's and their needs. James wasn't sure what the actual process of finding out how someone was a Little but he heard, from his Dad who had an uncle that was Little that they have to do the normal classification test that everyone gets and then they have to do another test to see what age bracket they were in mentally. It was a long process James had heard and while he didn't think there was anything wrong with being a Little, he was glad he wasn't one. He just hoped Lily wasn't one either because if she was then they'd never be together. </p><p>Rushing down the corridor James glanced in every window before seeing a glimpse of red shining hair. That must be where she is, he thought, pushing the door open with a huge smile. The smile fell from his face though when he saw who she was with. Snivellus. James was nearly sure that he was the only thing standing between him and Lily. She hated when James teased him, but it was just too easy sometimes. James never considered himself a bully but with Severus he just couldn't help himself. He was about to let out a sarcastic comment before he saw the dried tear tracks on Severus' face. He was crying? Why? Lily was glaring at him and stood up to block his view of him. James was too shocked to say anything though. Why would Severus be crying? The thought was at the forefront of his mind and he ended up blurting it out. </p><p>"None of your business! You leave Severus alone!" Lily said fiercely, not wanting James's words to hurt Severus any more than he already was. </p><p>"Why do you care if Snivellus is crying James?" Sirius intoned sarcastically, earning a warning growl off of Lily and a small sob off of Severus. Well, it was obvious what Lily was now, only a protective Omega would make a noise like that. </p><p>"Sirius shut up. Lily, What's wrong with him?"  Lily shot her glare to James, not liking how Sirius's comment hurt Severus more. </p><p>"Seriously Lily, I've never seen him cry. What's wrong?" Something must be seriously wrong if Snape was crying.</p><p>Lily huffed out a displeased breath but allowed it. She could smell the sincerity off him. Being an Omega did have its perks. </p><p>"Severus is a Little and his parents haven't taken it the best. The ministry have told him he's being taken out of their care but he's afraid that they'll put him with someone worse than his drunken father." Lily explained in a clipped precise tone, glaring at each of the boys. If one of them made fun of him for his classification she would show the true meaning of a protective Omega. </p><p>Luckily all three of them were wise enough not to say anything. James looked like he was upset at what he was hearing while Sirius just looked gobsmacked. Remus looked like his usual calm self, which reassured Lily a lot more than she was willing to admit. She wasn't sure how to comfort Severus and was trying to come up with something to say when James and the other two stormed into the carriage. She made eye contact with Remus, who looked at her kindly before pushing gently past James and her to get to Severus. All three watched on to see what he was going to say to Severus. Severus was looking up at him with tears still in his eyes. To everyone's shock he sat down beside him and pulled him into his arms. </p><p>"There we go. You're okay cub. Just let it all out." He soothed, running a hand through Severus's greasy but baby fine hair. He'd need a bath when they got in, Remus thought. After learning about his drunken father it was no wonder Severus wasn't the most clean cut. </p><p>Severus, for his part held himself stiffly on the other teenagers lap before sinking into the warmth and comfort offered. It was the first hug he'd received since finding out his was Little. The official from the ministry said he was touch starved, and Severus was feeling the effects of what that meant right about now. He unconsciously cuddled into the larger boy, for once happy that he was a bit smaller than every other boy in his year. </p><p>James watched on as Remus cuddled up with Severus. It was clear to see that Remus was an Alpha-caregiver right then, with the way he was handling Severus. Of course James friend would have to be in the one percent of the nation that was a cross over in classifications. </p><p>"So Remus is a caregiver?" Lily asked, breaking the silence as they watched Remus bounce Severus slightly, trying to get him to calm down. </p><p>"Alpha-caregiver." James corrected absently, staring on at his friend, unsure about how this was going to affect everything. </p><p>Lily whistled, "Whoa, they're super rare right? I heard that they generally imprint on a Little and take them as their own a lot of the time." James nodded his head in the unspoken words, wondering if that was what was happening right now. Unsure on how to proceed, James wracked his brain trying to come up with something helpful. Then a thought stuck him.</p><p>"Hey, isn't Lucius Malfoy an Alpha-caregiver as well? He'd be able to help!" James spun on his heel before Lily or Sirius could respond in any way and took off running down the corridor to the unofficial slytherin carriages. He got a lot of glares as we wandered down them from distrustful slytherins but he didn't care. He wasn't sure why but he wanted to help Severus. After hearing what Lily had said about his parents, James couldn't help but feel bad for the other boy. Finding out you're Little is hard enough. Finding out you're Little and your parents not accepting it was the worst. If James could help in any way then he would. He wasn't some Little abuser like Severus's no good father. It also helped that this would get him in Lily's good books once again. </p><p>Finally reaching the carriage he wanted, James flung the door open without so much as knocking, making all the year sevens jump in their seats. All besides Lucius that was who looked at James coolly. </p><p>"What's a little Gryffindor doing down here?" Goyle sneered, or was it Crabbe? They always looked the same to James. Shaking his head to get back on track James ignored Crabbe, Goyle and the others that were in the carriage and instead focused on Lucius. </p><p>"Malfoy, I need your help." And if that didn't kill James's ego, he didn't know what would. </p><p>One elegant brow rose, "Oh? And what would you need my help for Mr. Potter?"  Lucius asked.</p><p>"Yeah," James looked around at the other curious faces, staring back at him. "Can we speak privately maybe?"  </p><p>Interest piqued, Lucius found himself agreeing. "Everyone out." James watched unbelieving eyes as everyone got up and left without a word of protest. Just how much sway did Malfoy have?  Once the last person filed out and closed the door behind them Lucius raised a gracious arm.</p><p>"The floor is yours Mr. Potter." James found himself fidgeting under the intense gaze of Lucius. </p><p>"Uh, well, you see. We got our classifications this year." James began, not really sure where to go with what he wanted to say.</p><p>"I'm sure Mummy and Daddy are very proud." Lucius commented when James took too long in between pauses. </p><p>"Shut up. Anyway. We go out classifications this year and well, I'm an Alpha, and Sirius is an Omega weirdly enough, not that there's anything wrong with being an Omega that is." </p><p>James found himself rambling and unable to stop. That was until Lucius put a hand up and the words died on James lips. </p><p>"Are you going to get to the point at all Mr. Potter." </p><p>"Yes well, you see, my other friend, Remus? Well he's an Alpha-caregiver like you, and Lily was telling me that they imprint on Little's and see them as their own if they do. I know your an Alpha-caregiver. Is it true?" </p><p>Lucius inclined his head in agreement, "Yes, it is. I am curious Mr. Potter, as to why you want to know this." </p><p>"Well you see. Severus Snape? He's a Little." James paused when he heard Lucius' sharp intake of breath. When it looked like that's all he was going to do, he continued. "Uh, well. I went into the carriage to see Lily and Severus was crying. His Dad is an ass apparently and a drunk. The ministry is taking him away from them and he's scared he's going to end up with someone worse. So Remus went in and now Severus is cuddling him on his lap and Remus called him his cub and we're not sure if he's imprinted or not. Can you help?" </p><p>James voice got faster and faster as he spoke, rushing the last sentence out.</p><p>Lucius sat staring at the Gryffindor for a long moment before agreeing. He always had a soft spot for the small Slytherin. It made a lot more sense now why he would, seeing as the boy was a Little. </p><p>"Okay, show me to where they are." James was delighted he agreed. Rushing out of the carriage and all but running to the one with Severus and Remus in it. Lucius walked at a more leisurely pace, ignoring the incredulous looks he was getting off of other students as James shouted at him to hurry up. Honestly, Gryffindor's were so loud.<br/>
James rushed into the carriage and saw that Lily and Sirius had taken a seat across for Remus and Severus, talking quietly together. Severus was clutching tightly onto Remus, with his head buried into his neck as Remus bounced him slightly, whispering words of comfort into his hair. </p><p>"Hey guys. I'm back." James said, when he rushed in. Lily jumped from her seat. "Well? Is he coming?" She demanded. </p><p>Her question was answered seconds later though, with Lucius sweeping into the room. Remus' nostrils flared when he came in, his pupils dilating. He looked sharply to what the amazing scent was and noticed that Lucius was looking at him the same way he must have been looking at Lucius. The smell was intoxicating. It smelled like his, just like Severus smelled like his. </p><p>Lucius tried to clear his head as the smells assaulted him. He'd hadn't been overwhelmed by smells in years so this was a shock to his system. Trying to get over the smell of his mate, Lucius focussed on his cub. Whipping his head to the side he snarled at the other occupants in the room. "Get.Out." All three of them ran with haste to the door, James stopped for a second as if to argue but Lily pushed him the rest of the way out. No way was she getting in the way of an Alpha-caregiver when their eyes were amber like that. She read up on what to do in a few different books, all of them had the same answer: don't look them in the eyes and run. When their eyes glowed like that they were in defensive mode, trying to protect their Little and/or mate. Lily was surprised that Lucius was able to get words out to warn them instead of just attacking. </p><p>Once satisfied that the others were gone and the door was shut, Lucius made his was confidently to his mates and Little's side. He dropped down beside them and ran a hand through Severus's hair. The baby needed a bath, he thought, unaware he was in the same line of thinking as Remus. </p><p>"Hello little one." He murmured, Severus's nose scrunched up in confusion. Whose voice was that? It didn't sound like anyone that was in the carriage already. He peeked out from Remus's neck, shocked to see Lucius Malfoy staring back at him. </p><p>"He's a little bit shy at the moment." Remus commented from over his head. Well of course he was shy! He was cuddling on Remus Lupin's lap with Sirius Black across from him. He was afraid if he came out that Sirius would make fun of him. He couldn't mentally handle that right now so it was better if he stayed right where he was. He also liked the sound of Remus's voice and it was easier to listen is he was that close to him. That was his excuse and he was sticking to it.</p><p>"Hmm, well it's only the three of us here. So what do you say to coming out of your little hiding spot and saying hello?" Lucius coaxed, rubbing a hand down Severus's cheek.<br/>
It took a bit more coaxing but eventually they got him out of Remus's neck and sitting up straight. He was still on Remus's lap but he no longer had a death grip on him. His tears had dried up slightly as well.</p><p>"Well there's those pretty brown eyes. I thought they were gone forever." Lucius smiled at the Little as he blushed. He was obviously unused to compliments. Lucius noted down to give him as many as possible. </p><p>Remus smiled at the endearing baby on his lap before looking to Lucius. He was willing to ignore the scent of Lucius if Lucius was but he wasn't going to walk out of Severus because Lucius was here. The cub was his. </p><p>"Just so you know Mr. Malfoy, the cub is mine." Remus remarked, trying to gage the response he would get. </p><p>It was not what he was expecting. Lucius' eyes went amber and he glared back at Remus. "Both of you are mine. I'll wait until you're ready but don't think that you or the cub aren't mine." Lucius' voice got a ferocious note to it, making it hard to ignore. Remus found himself nodding dumbly at Lucius unsure of what to say. </p><p>Severus broke it though by speaking for the first time all day. "D-does that mean I have two daddies?" He asked, unable to help the quiver in his voice. </p><p>"Yes cub. That means you have two daddies. You may call me Papa if you want." Lucius smiled at him, swiping at the tear that rolled down Severus's cheek. </p><p>"Hold on, I have something I was keeping for the Little I imprinted on." Lucius fished around in his pocket for a second before taking out a little box. Opening it Remus could see it was a plain pacifier. With a little incantation, Lucius spelled it so that it had a doe on it with big brown eyes similar to Severus's. Severus looked beyond delighted with the gift, never having gotten one before now. He took the pacifier eagerly off of Lucius and suckled hard on it, closing his eyes as he took comfort from it. </p><p>"Little one, Can you look at me again." Lucius asked after a few minutes of him and Remus watching the Little happily suckle his pacifier. Severus's eyes popped open but they were sleepy now instead of the wildly alert he was earlier. </p><p>"Can you tell me what age you are little one?"  He asked gently, wanting to get a gage on what age he had to get supplies for. Severus's brow crinkled in thought again before lifting one finger. </p><p>"You're one?" Severus nodded, happy that Lucius understood him. </p><p>"Thank you, angel. You can close your eyes again." Severus was only too happy to obey, still suckling on his pacifier. He fell against Remus and within minutes was letting out little snuffles. Sleeping peacefully for the first time since the start of summer when he went back to the house.</p><p>"So what happens now?" Remus asked in the quiet, once he knew Severus was deeply asleep.</p><p>"Well now we have to go to the headmaster and get separate quarters for the three of us. Little's have to have a caregiver with them anyway and since the both of us imprinted on him they'll have to let both of us into the quarters." Lucius explained. </p><p>"How do you know we imprinted on him?" Remus, who had only found out he was an Alpha-caregiver the summer gone was still learning what he needed to know.</p><p>Lucius took Severus's wrist lightly and pulled the sleeve up. On the inside of his wrist was a small script that stated both Lucius and Remus' name. Turning his own wrist he showed Severus and on his inner arm, Remus. The same was on Remus's arm and wrist. </p><p>"Ah, so that's what that tingling sensation was." Remus had gotten two tingling sensations when he first saw Severus and then again with Lucius. It made a lot more sense now. </p><p>"Yes. He's a very young Little and a very fragile boy. We're going to have to be careful with him to let him heal. The first thing we need though is his file from the ministry. We have to register ourselves with them to make this official and then we'll be able to get the information we need. There might be a small bit of trouble but nothing we can't handle." Lucius was talking to himself more than Remus by the end of his little speech, trying to anticipate what was to come. Nothing good he was sure. Looking up into Remus's kind eyes though put it out of his head. He'd deal with that once they got to Hogwarts, right now he'd enjoy having his mate and cub beside him for the rest of the train journey.</p>
