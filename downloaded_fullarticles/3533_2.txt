    <p align="center"><br/> Thursday 28h May 1998</p><p align="center">In which Chris Rennard discusses various<br/> matters with Kate Pemberly and Paul Banks</p><p>    It was close to ten o’clock in the morning when Chris Rennard, curator of Steyning Museum, cycled down the High Street of that small market town in West Sussex and turned left into Church Street. Further down on his right, scaffolding obscured the timber-framed building which was part of Steyning Grammar School, its stone-clad roof damaged in a recent storm. On his left he passed the Model Bakery, so essential to the Museum for the supply of buns and sandwiches. The former were the particular favourites of Kate Pemberly who, along with Paul Banks, came in to help on Thursdays when the Museum was closed to the public. The sandwiches Chris bought for his lunch.<br/>      Passing Saxon Cottage on his left, Chris dismounted at the top of Church Lane, a short slope that led down to that part of the town known as Shooting Field. At some point during the previous Sunday night, a storm resulted in not just damage to buildings but to a large part of the town being flooded and Shooting Field, being low-lying, had been particularly badly affected. Steyning Grammar School had been closed owing to the fact that the senior school was situated on Shooting Field and the damage to the junior school roof in Church Street gave the Head, Mr. Erison, no option but to close the school.<br/>      What interested Chris particularly as he looked down Church Lane was the amount of water that still covered the area at the bottom of the hill. This was where before the floods a small stream flowed underneath the road, visible only through a metal grille on a patch of grass between the road and the pavement. Remounting, Chris continued on past the Library and turned right into a small car park that served Museum, Library and Steyning Grammar School staff. Beyond the car park lay the playground in front of Bennett’s, one of the school’s three boarding houses. Dismounting, Chris unlocked the door to the Museum, wheeled his bicycle into the foyer where he propped it up on its stand before disabling the alarm. He then pushed open the inner door and entered the Museum proper. Looking around anxiously for any sign of change and relieved to see that everything appeared to be as he had left it the day before, he made his way to the office.<br/>      Chris’s anxiety stemmed from the fact that a Saxon Skeleton known as ‘Steyning Man’ had mysteriously disappeared from the Museum one night towards the end of April. There had been no sign of a break-in and no one had seen or heard anything of it since: and there was something else, a sense of unease and foreboding he had felt at the time of Steyning Man’s disappearance and since. He had mentioned this to John Sayles, senior county archaeologist, when he had visited him in Chichester on the Thursday following the disappearance. The main purpose of the visit had been to show him some photographs of a grave slab in the porch of St. Andrew’s church, just across the road from the Museum. Kate Pemberly had remembered there was a snake design on it which she felt might be similar to those found by some of John’s team during an excavation up on Chanctonbury Ring, a Bronze and Iron Age fort on the South Downs, a mile or so to the west of Steyning. Chris had told John about the disappearance of Steyning Man and about his sense of unease, a feeling that something was happening, that the past was awakening. He had felt a great sense of relief when John had not said he was being stupid, that facts should be considered in their line of work and not feelings. He had remained silent, nodded sagely and they had then gone on to talk of other things.<br/>      Half an hour after Chris had entered the Museum, Kate Pemberly and Paul Banks turned up and found him, mug of black coffee in hand, staring intently at one of several maps showing Steyning through the ages.<br/>      “Morning Chris, what are you up to?”<br/>      “Morning Kate, morning Paul. You know, the one good thing to come out of this flood business is the insight it may give us into where St. Cuthman’s port was situated. Have a look at this.” Chris pointed to the map in front of him. “This is what we think Steyning may have looked like in the early Middle Ages. That’s where we think the Port might have been, just behind the church and on an arm of the River Adur. I had a look down Church Lane just now and although the flood waters have gone down across Shooting Field generally, they are still quite deep along Tanyard Lane and across into Gatewick Park which suggests some sort of channel may have been there.”<br/>      “Yes, I see what you mean.” Paul was peering at the map. “Remind me again, Chris, why did the port disappear in the later Middle Ages?”<br/>      “The main reason seems to be the silting up of the River Adur. This may have had something to do with movement of its mouth eastwards due to longshore drift. Water would not have been able to flow in and out so easily. As you know, the Adur is tidal and if there was less movement of water up and down the river, this may have caused silting up. Whatever the reason, by the middle of the 14th century, the port had virtually ceased to exist and Steyning declined in importance.”<br/>      “And now it’s been clobbered again!” This came from Kate.<br/>      “That’s true. It’s almost…”<br/>      “Almost what, Chris?”<br/>      “Nothing really. It’s just that…”<br/>      “It’s Steyning Man again, isn’t it?” Paul sounded gleeful, as though he had hit on something nobody else had thought about.<br/>      “Well … yes. I can’t help thinking something’s going on and I know it sounds daft but I wonder if this flood has something to do with it.”<br/>      “Hang on a moment Mr. Curator. Are you seriously suggesting that the disappearance of Steyning Man and this flood are somehow connected?”<br/>      “I don’t know, Kate. Of course it makes no sense at all, linking the disappearance of a Saxon Skeleton with weather conditions. It’s as silly as saying the storm down here in Steyning is connected with the various disasters happening up and down the country at the moment. Mind you, Salisbury and Worcester both experienced violent storms at much the same time and several buildings in Durham caught fire a few days ago.”<br/>      “I read about the Durham fire,” added Paul. “They thought it was due to a gas leak, didn’t they?”<br/>       “Yes, they did, but I sometimes wonder if when the authorities don’t know the cause of a fire or an explosion, they put it down to a gas leak.”<br/>      “I know what you mean but it’s odd that these three towns have been affected.” This came from Kate.<br/>      “Why? I mean it’s not just them, is it. Other places have suffered damage. A bridge collapsed somewhere in the West Country recently and power lines have been damaged all over the place.”<br/>      “That bridge was in Exeter, Paul.”<br/>       “Yes, and it just shows all this is pretty random.”<br/>      “Some of it looks that way, but Exeter, Salisbury, Worcester and Durham?”<br/>      “Like I say, all over the country - no connection.”<br/>      “They’re all cathedral towns.”<br/>      “That’s true, now you come to mention it; but what about power lines and bridges collapsing?”<br/>      “I know what you’re saying but I still think it’s a bit of a coincidence that four of our major cathedral cities have been damaged.”<br/>      “You know I hate to say it, Paul, but Kate may be on to something. Hang on.” Chris headed for the office and returned with a newspaper. He turned over a few pages before he found what he was looking for.<br/>      “It says here there was a fire in Canterbury Cathedral Close yesterday afternoon. Two houses were badly damaged. The blaze was quickly brought under control by the fire brigade. A spokesman for the Cathedral staff said a gas leak was a likely cause of the fire.” Chris looked up at his two friends. “Looks like someone has it in for the Church of England!”<br/>      “Yes, but what about all theses other things,” persisted Paul. “Targeting cathedrals is one thing but if you had it in for religion, would you also want to go and bring down power lines and destroy bridges all over the place?”<br/>      “That may simply be coincidental or maybe...” Kate looked at Paul and Chris conspiratorially, “…maybe whoever’s doing this is using these other disasters as a cover, trying to disguise the fact his main target is religion.”<br/>      “His, Kate? His? How do you know it’s not a woman causing all this trouble?”<br/>      “Come on, Paul. You know as well as I do that pretty well all the trouble in the world is caused by blokes - with the exception of you two, of course!”<br/>      "So kind but it’s still your turn for the bun-run!”<br/>      “You’re right, it is. Caramel doughnut, Chris?”<br/>      “That’d be lovely, thanks.”<br/>      “Paul?”<br/>      “Not for me; got to keep in trim. I’ll have a cup of tea, though. I’ll go and put the kettle on.”<br/>      “You do that and while you’re at it, would you get the scrapbooks out for me? Oh, and the pile of local papers I left in the back room. There may be articles on Steyning events to cut out.”<br/>      “No problem and talking of newspaper articles, I was shopping down in Shoreham earlier this morning and noticed there was something in the Shoreham Herald about a grave in a churchyard at Hangleton.”<br/>      “That’s where graves usually are.”<br/>      “Yes I know but in this case the vicar apparently knew nothing about it. It wasn’t a scheduled burial. The grave seems to have just appeared overnight.”<br/>      “That’s weird.”<br/>      “It is. Anyway, it’s a police matter now. They think a crime may have been committed and there might have to be an exhumation.”<br/>      “I wonder what they’ll find.”<br/>      “Don’t know but I can see the headlines: Large hole appears in local churchyard. The police are looking into it.”<br/>      “For Heaven’s sake, Paul!”<br/>      “Have you heard the one about…”<br/>      “No, and I don’t want to!”</p>
