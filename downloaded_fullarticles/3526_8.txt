    <p>Draco was an exceptional being. So he thought.<br/>  <br/>    "Top in potions. Expert in dark magic. Fast learner in spells and magic. And extrodinarilly smart."<br/>   <br/>    Everything about Draco was great except for a few 'tiny' issues.<br/>   <br/>   "Hates and absolutely despises Harry Potter. The savior. And a malfoy. Which would include the slytherin part too."<br/>    <br/>    There was nothing wrong with being a slytherin. Nothing really. They were sly and cunning, ahead of everything. They had the ability to get themselves out of practically every situation.<br/>   <br/>    But that was exactly what shouldn't happen. And with Draco Malfoy as a part of their plan. It'd be incredibly difficult. ...<br/>  </p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Dumbledore was in a mess. He had to figure out how to execute his plan without it failing. And the most important fragment of this plan included Draco Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy's son.</p><p>  "So how do we get him to work with us?"</p><p>   Dumbledore rubbed his beard..in a stress like manner. And when the lightbulb finally turned on, his eyes twinkled with delight.<br/>   <br/>    "Harry Potter," He says.<br/>   <br/>    "<em>The</em> Harry Potter?"<br/>   <br/>    "Yes, <em>The</em> Harry Potter will help get Draco Malfoy on our side!"</p><p>   The other looked unsure. Did Dumbledore really think this as a good idea??<br/>   <br/>    "They...they hate each other!"</p><p>   "You know as they say, there is a thin line between love and hate~~"<br/>   <br/>    "Love? Where did LOVE come into this!!??"<br/>    <br/>    Dumbledore smiled yet again. And to the other, it almost looked a little creepy. As if he was finally having a dream come true.<br/>  <br/>    "Harry Potter will make Draco Malfoy fall for him. And convince him to the light side."<br/>   <br/>    "Again! They <em>HATE</em> each other!! There is no <em>love</em> in this!!! Even you said they hated each other!"<br/>   <br/>    Dumbledore, however, pretends to not hear the others words at all. He puts his hands together in delight and spins around in his chair squeeling.<br/>   <br/>    The other obviously creeped out, slowly got out of his chair and started to tiptoe his way back to the door.<br/>  <br/>   But just as the other was about to leave, Dumbledore swings his arm around the others neck and pulls him back in.<br/>  <br/>   "It's time for a celebration!!"</p><p>   "Why...why would we need a celebration??"</p><p>   Dumbledore took his arm of the other and grabbed the bottle of good ol' muggle beer that lay on the shelf.</p><p>   "For this obviously good plan, ofcourse."</p><p>   "ITS NOT A GOOD PLAN!!!!"<br/>  <br/>   Dumbledore payed no heed go his words and proceeded to down the beer. Today was a day of celebration. Today was the day of victory. Today Drarry would finally become a cannon. TODAY HIS OTP WOULD FINALLY BECOME ONE!!<br/>  <br/>   Dumbledore couldn't be happier.</p>
