    <p>
  <span>“You lied to me,” Harry gasped, staring into the eternity beyond the soil beneath his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a great rage and panic threatening to overtake him, drag him down into the depths of sorrow or perhaps bloodlust. His body ached still, falling apart as he stood there and contemplated the horrible truth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man that he’d trusted above all else, his refuge of the past years was truly…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Truly--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A villain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps not Voldemort in scale, but he may as well have set a barrage of </span>
  <em>
    <span>crucio</span>
  </em>
  <span> curses rummaging through his insides. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could Albus have done this to him?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus found that he had nothing to say to that. How had they reached here? How had his perfect plan, years of undercover work and manipulation fall apart? How is it that the martyr he’d chosen stood before him though Dumbledore himself had been disarmed by this same student. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, do not--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glared at Albus Dumbledore, raising his wand dangerously. How he was managing to hold that wand given what he’d gone through in the last twenty-four hours was amazing. The blood was still staining his clothing from wounds that wouldn’t close. The only thing they could do was to get the antidote to him and keep him on Blood Replenishing Potions for now. He looked about ready to collapse right then. His arms shaking even as it held it out, green eyes bright with tears and fury. There was something sparking nearby that barely caught his attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed that no matter how furious Harry was, he didn’t have full control of himself. Perhaps a lingering side effect of having a piece of Voldemort attached to his soul? If he played his hand right, he may have a salvageable tragedy on his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived driven mad by Death Eaters?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Yes, Rita Skeeter would spin it perfectly to have all of Wizarding Britain demanding the safety and security of a new leader, a leader that would lead them to the IWA as he had led the Order to the IWA.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay away from me, Professor,” he said shakily. “I-I am going with Sirius for the rest of the summer and I... When school starts again, I don’t want to talk to you for quite some time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus stared at the young man, breaking to pieces before him. Something told him that he should feel guilty, ashamed maybe, but it wasn’t there. He couldn’t make himself feel it. There was just the dominant urge rising up to make Harry bend to his will. After all, there was no mistaking what Harry was just like his mother with those bright green eyes. He couldn't afford to lose control of Harry right now. Not to incorrigible Sirius Black in any case. Things had been going so well until </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> opened her mouth to the Aurors, to Harry--</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Curse</span>
  </em>
  <span> that muggleborn menace!</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione Granger, </span>
  </em>
  <span> the name felt like poison, burning in his mind and the taste of tar in his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d pay even if he managed to salvage the damage done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” he tried gently. “Surely you can see how rash this is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>care,” Harry gritted out, sparks dripping onto the ground as it shook, mixing with the blood that still dripped. “Y-You’ve lied to me all this time! About Voldemort, about the stone, the Dursleys, about Sirius--about everything! Was anything you said true?! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Anything?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus swallowed looking at Harry’s wand before opening his mouth. There was no telling what spell was on the tip of his tongue, no telling how wrong it would go. It could kill them both--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s wand went flying out of his hand and into Hermione’s hand who stood several paces away wearing her International Wizarding Alliance robes and looking every bit the junior operative that she was. Albus almost wanted to glare at her, but kept his composure. It was her fault after all. Hermione had seemed like a good pawn--Muggleborn, clearly submissive, struggling to make things come together, to make friends. She should have died when Dumbledore let that troll loose in first year. Should have died on that quest to get the Sorcerer’s stone. He'd made the mistake of underestimating her intellect. Then, there was the Time-Turner that truly should have been the end of her as Time magic was the most addicting and corruptive next to Dark magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She'd bested that as well, seeming to not even have aged with her time traveling. Perhaps, somewhere in her family line, there had been a natural time turner. There was no telling with muggleborns unless you tested them really. He should have known that she would be trouble when Remus transformed last year. He should have killed her. Werewolves went after powerful wizards first by instinct to try and convert them--but she'd lived and she'd kept Harry alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Professor Dumbledore, I have a few questions about all of this…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes narrowed just a bit remembering that almost beguiling voice, innocent as she held Harry against her, trying to bind his wounds as close to closed as could be managed with Nagini’s venom in him.  He should have told her no then and perhaps he wouldn’t have gotten himself into this mess. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, it isn’t in anyone’s best interest to point a wand at the Headmaster,” she said gently coming towards him as he shook. She took him by the shoulders, wrapping an arm around him. “I have orders to escort you to Sirius. Are you ready?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded quickly, clinging to her robes. Albus opened his mouth, but she turned a fierce glare at him, the magical discharge that came with it echoed strongly rushing towards him like a hissing Sphinx. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned her kind gaze back to the shaking Harry. Given the events that had led to Sirius’s escape and Voldemort’s defeat, he should have expected Harry to be shaken up, but he hadn’t ever considered that perhaps Harry would have learned more than he first thought about Dumbledore. He kept his mouth shut as they left the small village towards a viable floo point and vanished in a blast of green flames. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grit his teeth. This just wouldn’t do… to be undone by one small blip in his plan--especially not Hermione Granger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor,” Ron started coming towards him. “Where did Harry go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He regarded Ron for a moment and smiled kindly, “He only just left with Miss Granger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He flushed and turned, “Thank you Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is wrong, dear boy? Were you meant to go with Harry for the rest of the summer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the 10th century, when wizards began to realize that they weren’t alone in the world and didn't have to assert dominance over each other, they created the International Wizarding Alliance. Among the many benefits of the Alliance, the International Quidditch League and World Cup were created. It began as a game to bring countries of wizards together in friendly rivalry and continued on to this day to remind all wizards of the beauty of peace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Around the same time, the wizarding populace began to notice a divide in character. There were people who thrived on taking care of other and those that thrived on obeying. Rarely, were there those who straddled the line between the two. In order to facilitate a higher quality of living for wizards and a better chance for wizards to have long, healthy relationships, the IWA began to institute dynamic testing. At an age determined by each country, each witch and wizard would be tested an officially declared a Dom, a Sub, or a Switch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the 15th century, Britain and several other wizarding countries began the persecution of Switches. They broke over a hundred wands, killed thousands of witches and wizards, and very nearly exposed the wizarding world to muggles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As such, the countries involved in what is now called the Switch Purge were removed from the IWA. All Switches who had survived were take in as refugees and though they were protected, the horrors had left such a mark on them that eventually they seemed to have died out leaving the population forever changed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the 18th century, after several centuries of reforms and treaties, the Britain and the original collection of countries, including Albania, were offered a chance to return to the IWA, but because of various disagreements with how the IWA was run, how Britain would be represented, and the stipulations that came with membership, they denied it and all of its protection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They of course lived to regret that in the 19th century with the rise of Gellert Grindelwald and again in the 20th century with the first rise of Tom Riddle. After the first fall of Voldemort in 1981, Britain begged for sanctuary from the IWA to avoid the return of another dark wizard like him, for though they had their Auror’s, the most powerful secrets of the wizarding world were in countries firmly in the IWA. The IWA offered them the same demands as before and they refused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In 1991, after three Hogwarts students uncovered the return of Voldemort, the group known as the Order of the Phoenix went to the IWA on behalf of Britain to ask for aid. The IWA agreed to roll-out one program as a tether to Britain, rolling it out in Britain as they had done in other countries that had once refused to join but eventually did so. They created a small training program, a task force of IWA operatives that would train students and adults alike in IWA procedures, magic, and ability. The tests were difficult, but well worth it when one of those three students managed to get accepted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the Order asked if there was more they could do, the IWA said that until the British Ministry was prepared to agree to IWA terms, there was nothing they could do. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus knew then that a great tragedy would have to befall Britain in order to get them to do it, something so horrible that no one could deny that Britain needed help. In the mourning and sobbing, he could rally all of Britain behind him and get rid of the current Minister of Magic with little to no campaigning. It had been a perfect plan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If only he hadn't included Hermione in that plan. In her mind, no matter what her dynamic turned out to be, that was his greatest mistake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wailed, falling out of the fireplace and she kneeled to pull him close and keep him grounded. Thinking that she was a pawn and being willing to sacrifice Harry had been his greatest mistakes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clinging to Hermione, sobbing into her pristine robes, Harry wasn’t in a position to register their surroundings.  The scent of fresh cream, butter, and cinnamon filled her senses. It seemed that Sirius was making cinnamon rolls for breakfast, the gooey kind that Harry had first tasted with his godfather. The small French cottage felt like a home even with Harry’s hysterical wailing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sunshine,” she whispered, squeezing him to her, stilling him. “We're here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here in a house owned by the Potter family. Another place that Harry had not known about. It, among so many other things, had been hidden from him, taken from him from years thanks to Albus. Sirius appeared only seconds after the first distressed wail. He scooped Harry off the ground. Harry let Hermione go in favor of the strong, clean scent of Sirius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had read about the scent that Harry was clinging to, the feeling. Sirius was a Dom, one that Harry recognized as familiar and safe. After a lifetime of being denied that presence, Harry’s instincts clung to it every time he was near.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's okay, Harry,” Sirius soothed, rocking him. “I'm here. You’re safe.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry just whimpered, clinging to him, silent and shaky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve sent word to the Dursleys,” Sirius said,looking at Hermione with a wry smile. “I suppose you’ll be escorting him there to pick up his things too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She chuckled, “More to keep you from murdering them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How about to the World Cup?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gave him a flat look, “I don't think you'll need an escort for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled and nodded, stroking Harry’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S-Sirius?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There we are,” he said gently. “Just breath, Harry. Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shuddered, letting Sirius rock him as Hermione went about taking his trunk to his room. She wasn’t sure how long it was before Harry stopped sobbing, but he remained curled up in Sirius’s arms as he did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the War over, Voldemort dead and Harry more traumatized than any near fourteen year old should have been, it was hard to celebrate anything. Despite that, Hermione smiled seeing Sirius and Harry together. It had burned her to no end when she asked Albus that questions about Sirius’s incarceration, read up on Wizarding Dynamic Law and so much more. The network of lies that Albus had weaved around Harry and Sirius, the paths that his lies created all leading to somewhere far darker than Voldemort’s reign.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had been denied love for fourteen years because of Albus’ greed and arrogance. He's been prepped as the ultimate sacrifice for the Wizarding world and a catapult to Albus’s political career. Given the chance, Albus could have set off another Great Wizarding War or worse. It was hard to be sure who was the true dark lord anymore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt her communication mirror wiggle in her pocket and reached in to answer the call as Sirius pointed her silently towards the private balcony. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry heard nothing besides the sound of Sirius’s heart beating beneath his ear as he sat wrapped up in a thick blanket, surrounded by the clean smell of Sirius. He thought it was interesting that he could faintly remember his scent like a lost memory from the time of his parents. It was a far nicer half-memory than flashes of green light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” Sirius ventured. “Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sniffled and shook his head silently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I made cinnamon rolls and Hermione is making dinner if you’re hungry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked up as Hermione came back with two bowls of soup and a cinnamon roll on a plate. Harry managed to wiggle his hands free to eat. At least he hadn't lost his appetite. Hermione had a feeling that the comfort of something sweet and his godfather’s presence had more to do with it than anything. Regardless, he finished the bowl and the entire cinnamon roll without prodding before falling asleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So Hermione,” Sirius started as a bit of color started to return to Harry’s face. “Anything to share with the class?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned, “Nothing much. Though I highly suggest arranging Harry some counseling outside of love, World Cup, and being alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled and nodded. He was pretty sure that he could do that. He took the next three weeks to get Harry settled and checked up in between going to the IWA headquarters in Paris to finish up the interrogations, the trial, and get himself absolved of all crimes. Harry was given his first calming potion the day Britain reinstated Sirius’s lordship, his fortune, and his rightful title as executor of the Potter will and of course Harry’s guardian.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked out of the British Ministry of Magic together and to Diagon Alley for ice cream. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later that evening, Albus received the letter and the news one right after another. They turned to ash in his hands as he fumed in his office. It seemed that everything He planned was crumbling to dust around him, but he breathed in remembering Ron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though he wasn’t of a pureblood family of the caliber as the Malfoys, he was still a pureblood and that carried a good deal of weight in the wizarding world. In him, Albus saw an opportunity: Ron wanted Hermione.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was a powerful witch, that much was clear, but she was muggle-born and without a wizarding name backing her she wouldn’t get terribly far. Not to mention she was a submissive, a spirited one for sure, but a submissive nonetheless. Come September, she would be required to be tested and officially declared and from there Albus had a chance to recoup his losses not only from the war, but from her very clever puzzling out of his schemes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He'd marry her off to the highest bidder in a pretty gold and red bow to match her brown skin and get back on track to his end goal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps he would marry her off to a Malfoy or some equally cruel family as punishment for sticking her little brown nose where it didn’t belong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps he’d marry her off to Snape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He chuckled at the thought. She and Lily had more than enough in common after all. With the war over, he would need to keep Severus as close as possible. He'd lost him to Voldemort once and regained him through the prospect of revenge and keeping Harry, Lily’s only son, alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Viktor!” She called, but he’d already taken to the sky, kicking off hard and sending himself rocketing into the sky, tumbling it seemed. She sighed and sat out on the porch, to watch him disappear into the clouds above her home and try and think about how she would phrase this when he finally came back down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She breathed in and looked at the paperwork in her hands. She’d known it since he was a child, known it with every fiber of her being. It was more than just a familiar look at him. She rolled up the scroll and swallowed, waiting for Viktor come back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t return on his own, but slumped, exhausted on his grandfather’s broom that carried him back to her gently. She opened the door and let it float up to his bedroom, lowering gently to deposit him in bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced to the World Cup Trophy sitting on the mantle and sighed, turning back to get things done. She pulled up Sergei’s paperwork and began to fill it out along with the letter to the owner of the team. By the time Viktor woke up, he was a shaking, shuddering mess beneath his long, inky hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“B-baba…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shushed him, beckoning him to come sit on the couch with by the fire. She called for a house elf to bring food and a blanket before wrapping him up and setting a plate of food in his hand. He was so… tense despite flying until he was exhausted and the deep sleep he’d fallen into. He picked at his plate, twitching a bit and she felt her stomach turn in guilt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shouldn’t have told him to get on a broom whenever he couldn't sit still, when his skin felt too tight. It had been to help since Viktor had been so averse to appearing weak. It had served him well, thrusting him into more fame than his parents could have hoped for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But at what cost?</span>
</p>
