    <p> </p>
<p>It was an unusual mild evening for the season and especially so far up north. A silent "plop" flicked through the air and nothing visibly changed… Under the invisibility cloak Alastor Moody walked along the sparsely illuminated main road of the tiny village towards the slope of a steep mountain. On the brink of the village he turned around and scanned the scene ever watchful and ensuring that no unwanted pair of eyes watched the way he planned to take. For a moment he held his breath to hear every noise in the clear night, but all there was to hear were the tiny waves hitting the shore of the loch beneath the village. Moody breathed out slightly more relaxed and turned around to continue his way up the steep path. Against the moonlit horizon the ruin of a manor throned over the vale and the lake which, even though it was abandoned since a century had a bad reputation around here. The family who once lived there was said to be involved with the devil and after they left no one dared to enter the house for decades. One bold young lad had once climbed the slopes of the mountain and entered the house to impress his sweetheart. When he failed to return the terrified girl called upon the police to retrieve her fiancée, but all they found was a mangled old man cowering in the shadow of the old stone walls who was unable to remember his name nor the year he lived in. However he wore the exact same clothes the girl described her betrothed to be wearing when he left. After weeks of fruitless searching, the young man was declared dead and the villagers’ fear of the old house grew even stronger. No one since had set foot through the front gate or dared climb up the mountain.</p>
<p>Alastor Moody did not believe any of those stories, mostly because he had spent much of his life living in just that ruin. But of course for him it was no such thing. He knew exactly how to pass the defensive charms and curses and how to enter the house which was in perfectly good condition once the illusion was penetrated. Without the hint of a noise he walked through the gate and unlocked the front door with a rusty silver key. The entrance hall was dusty and cold and even the golden light, that sparked up after a swish of Moody's wand could not completely vanquish the eerie atmosphere. Moody dropped his invisibility cloak over a shillelagh walking stick in an umbrella stand beside the door and groaned tiredly. He walked up some creaking stairs, through another large parlour into an old bathroom. Another swish of his wand illuminated the white tiled room and he looked into the mirror.<br/>
"Another one…" he growled slightly amused and traced a fresh red scar in his face.<br/>
"If you're not more careful this is the least you have to worry about...damn Inferi." He added and splashed his face with a handful of ice cold water. It burned, but he did not take much notice of it so tired he was. Four days had passed since he had allowed himself some sleep…and even then it had only been a brief nap on the cot in his office. With a deep longing for some hours of rest he approached his bed in the large bedroom, studded with sneakoscopes, secrecy sensors and other dark protectors. All he managed to do was to take off his shoes and the jacket before falling into the sheets and drowning in sleep.<br/>
After what felt like mere seconds Alastor opened his eyes with a squint due to a bright light hovering above him. It didn't take him long to realise that it was a patronus. While shielding his eyes from the brightness he sat up with a yawn and shook his greying blonde mane. As though the charm had waited for just that moment it took the shape of a Lion and began to speak with the voice of none other than Rufus Scrimgeour.<br/>
"Alastor, we need you back in the office. Please come as soon as you can for a matter of the utmost urgency. Meet me in Barty Crouch's office." Once the message was issued the charm dissolved into silver steam. Moody got up with an exhausted groan and looked at his pocket watch. Five hours had passed. More sleep than the last two weeks added up. He reached for a bottle with a turquoise potion in it while his cloak put itself around Moody's shoulders. He shook his head and slapped himself several times as the strengthening solution began to kick in. With another yawn he made his way downstairs, out the front door and the gate. The moon had set and the sky took a silver grey tone in the quickly approaching dawn. After scanning the surrounding area thoroughly Moody vanished with a "plop".</p>
<p>The empty atrium had become a familiar sight to Alastor. He usually was one of the first to arrive and the last to leave…that is if he left at all. During the past months his office had become more of a home than his actual house… With burning eyes he crossed the dark hall and entered the lifts at the other end.<br/>
"If only my eyes could ignore the absence of proper resting…" He thought and closed both while the lift rattling changed floors. "Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement incorporating the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters and-" but Alastor did not wait to let the cold female voice finish her announcement. He knew it all to well and instantly made his way to the office of Barty Crouch, head of Magical Law Enforcement. He knocked twice, didn't wait for an answer and entered only to find the room empty.<br/>
"Mister Moody, Mister Moody!" sounded a high and somewhat trembly voice behind him. "I'm so glad you are here, the meeting was relocated to Minister Minchum's office." Moody turned around and arched a brow. For a moment he wanted to question the young secretary about this change, but in the end he felt to leached out and that whippersnapper would probably not know the answer anyway.<br/>
"Aha." He growled with a nod and walked back to the lift to enter the first level.<br/>
Three people looked up when Moody walked into the opulent office of the Minister. Harold Minchum, minister for magic, Barty Crouch head of magical law lnforcement and Rufus Scrimgeour, head Auror.<br/>
"Ah, Moody at last." Said Crouch.<br/>
"We've been keenly expecting your arrival." Moody nodded to each of the three men<br/>
"I only received your message twenty minutes ago Scrimgeour, what's the matter?"<br/>
It wasn't Scrimgeour who answered<br/>
"Nott one of his followers, whom you captured last week. I questioned him this night and he has revealed some…extremely worrying information." Said Barty Crouch with a lithic face.<br/>
Moody looked at the trio with arched brows in keen expectation, but no one looked as if they actually wanted to speak the news out loud.<br/>
"Well?" He asked after a moment.<br/>
"What is it he revealed or am I to guess it out of the blue?!" Asked Moody visibly annoyed by this dramatic secretiveness. "He," said Minister Minchum, his face buried in both hands due to fatigue or horror.<br/>
"He-who-must-not-be-named is planning a…a massacre. We suspected this for a while but, this new information puts in perspective just how powerful he really is."<br/>
Moody closed his eyes in growing impatience. He loathed this behaviour. All three leading members of the opposing force to Lord Voldemort knew of some imminent danger and yet seemed to hold off the point of the matter for mere dramatic effect.<br/>
"Tell me what is going on, I haven't got the energy to play the guessing game this morning." For the first time Scrimgeour spoke.<br/>
"Sources report that routs of trolls are moving in from the continent. Sightings of known Werewolves have flown in since days around Dover; a full moon is approaching and we were notified of several Dementor attacks close to the city. All kinds of dark creatures are gathering around and a massive storm front has built over the north sea during the last night. This isn't a coincidence, we are certain they will strike somewhere around there within days. Nott has confirmed most of our assumptions. We need to act immediately." Something caught Moody's attention during this report and he frowned visibly.<br/>
"How can you rely on Nott's information? Might be a simple diversion to focus our attention to the wrong place."<br/>
"We know for certain that he told the truth." Said Scrimgeour dryly and his eyes scurried over to Crouch.<br/>
"How can you be so sure unless…you used Veritaserum?" Asked Moody sceptically.<br/>
"No, not Veritaserum." Said Crouch stiffly and took a breath before handing a scroll of parchment bearing three Ministry seals to Moody.<br/>
"I have issued a decree which allows the Aurors and selected members of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement to use the unforgivable curses. Nott testified under the Imperius curse around three o'clock this morning."<br/>
Moody's frown deepened and his eyes scanned the scroll.<br/>
"Hm." He growled and chewed on his lip for a moment.<br/>
"Alastor…we have to stop him." Said Minchum with trembling voice.<br/>
"We can't let him massacre an entire town." The Minister's face looked like he was about to burst into tears and his skin had taken the colour of parchment. After a while Moody straightened his back and cleared his throat.<br/>
"So…what's our plan?" The minister looked at Barty, who in turn looked at Scrimgeour.<br/>
"We thought to place you in command of the operation." He said.<br/>
"Half of the Aurors who are currently in the office are yours, in addition we will mobilise the magical law enforcement patrol as well as our best Hit Witches and Wizards."<br/>
"And we have almost all the wizards of the Being division and the best of the Beast division of the Department for Regulation and Control of magical Creatures." Added Crouch with grim seriousness.<br/>
"Permission to kill is granted to every member of the operation. We need to prevent this catastrophe at all costs." As Crouch spoke Minchum nodded in agreement.<br/>
"We need this victory Alastor." He said desperately.</p>
<p>The ministry of magic was notorious for its slow bureaucratic processing of any kind of information, but under Barty Crouch at least one of its Departments had undergone a severe transformation into an effective apparatus. Within mere hours the Head of Department gathered trustworthy employees who thoroughly investigated every single member of the operation before briefing them. Unfortunately this scrutiny caused several cuts in numbers. Moody agreed to that in order to keep the operation as secret and safe as possible. The Department for Magical Law Enforcement sowed subtle rumours, that it concentrated its forces on Scotland to prevent a threatening revolt of Banshees. Barty Crouch ordered many members of sub departments of magical law enforcement and regulation and control of magical creatures northward around Glasgow and Edinburgh under the code name "Operation Demiguise" while the true focus was set on the coasts between Dover and Ramsgate.</p>
<p>Alastor Moody yawned and leaned so far backwards over his chair that his back cracked loudly. After letting out a tired but somewhat relieved groan he straightened up and finished a brief letter, sealed it and handed it over to a large golden-red bird. "Off with you before someone notices." He growled and gestured to the phoenix before it disappeared with a fiery flash. At least the order knew what was going on now although he didn't expect anyone to show up. In fact he didn't want anyone, because it was a very dangerous mission and the ranks of the order shrank by the day.. If he was bluntly honest with himself, he didn't feel up to the task. His fatigue gnawed on him since a week now and the constant consumption of strengthening solution and invigoration draughts began show their long term effects, but it was simply impossible to refuse command of this operation. It was too important and if he showed the slightest sign of weakness the death eaters would wonder if the ministry's most reliable Aurors were breaking down and in turn become even bolder. Not even five minutes had passed when another fiery flash sparked through Moody's office and and small scroll adorned with a red feather dropped onto his desk. He opened it and read:</p>
<p>
  <em>Thank you Alastor, unfortunately we have almost no one to spare at the moment, but I believe Frank and Alice are under your command.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Albus</em>
</p>
<p>Moody took a deep breath and looked up just as a scarlet memo flew through the open door and unfolded itself on his desk:</p>
<p><em>To A. Moody:</em><br/>
<em> Marching order for operation Demiguise. 25th of May 1978, 7:30 pm.</em><br/>
Signed:<br/>
H. Minchum, Minister for Magic<br/>
B. Crouch, Head of DMLE<br/>
R. Scrimgeour, Head of Auror Office</p>
<p>"So…off we are.." growled Moody and sighed heavily.<br/>
"I wonder how many will return." He pointed his wand to one of his cabinets and about one hundred memos left the office heading for every member of Operation Demiguise.</p>
