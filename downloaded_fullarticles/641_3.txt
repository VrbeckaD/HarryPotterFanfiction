    <p>Hermione Granger unlocked her door and stepped inside her empty apartment. She was tired after a long day at work. It was a busy time of the year and she didn't know whether to regret or not that she had planned to use her week off to visit her cousin. Hermione might of been a busy woman but she was stuck on never leaving her muggle life nor her muggle family out. Which was why her apartment looked like a typical muggle apartment and why there were a plane ticket lying among old papers on her table. </p>
<p>It had taken Harry, Ron and the rest of the Weasley family months of convincing to make the brown haired gryffindor agree to take some time off. Hermione hadn't really wanted to. There were far too many tasks left unfinished and she hated the mere idea of leaving with incomplete work. She didn't really know why she eventually caved. Maybe it was Mrs Weasley's pleading look, or her own parents obvious approval of the idea that caused it. A bit of both. </p>
<p>Truthfully, they did have a point. She desperately needed it. After becoming an auror, she could basically count on one hand how many days she had taken off. And it was usually around Christmas she would force herself to leave work a day or two. </p>
<p>She was exhausted. Just a constant state of exhausted. There were always so much happening and they still hadn't located every Death Eater, and certainly not all of those that been secretly working for Voldemort. </p>
<p>Her cousin, Jill, lived in the United States. Of course Hermione could floo over the sea or use any other sort of magic ways to get her ass across the ocean but it had been far too long since the last time she used the muggle way and somehow she found herself missing the horrid airports and the tight space on a airplane. It was funny that way. It would probably sound obscure to anyone else but for Hermione it sort of peaceful. Beside, for once no one knew her. After the war, especially, Hermione Granger had rather little privacy left. No matter where she went, someone always wanted to speak with her. Sometimes it was nice to be able to be out in public but still maintain her privacy.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Visiting her cousin proved to be good for her worn out self. She felt her spirit lift up as they were using the days to relax and just do fun things. Muggle things, fun things, tourist things. All of which Hermione dearly missed. Beside her cousin didn't roll her eyes or groan when Hermione would spew out facts about everything they went to see. It felt nice to refresh her muggle knowledge as well. Obviously most of her attention went to the wizarding world. It was a part of her job as an auror but it was also something she just couldn't let go off. The urge to read, to learn, and of course to teach. Even if she had politely turned down the offer, she had been delighted when McGonagall wanted her to teach at Hogwarts. Maybe when they were finally finished cleaning up the scrambles the war had left. </p>
<p>Even now, five years after Voldemort's defeat, the aftermath of the war was strong. Families had not only lost loved ones, but some had traumas which would never vanish, some families had lost all they ever had. Voldemort might of lost the war but the pain he had forsaken caused people to wonder sometimes. How much of a victory was it really? </p>
<p>In the midst of Hermione's brain falling into the dark pits within her mind, Jill spoke, and the curly haired woman blinked confused. Jill only shook her head with a light smile. While she had no knowledge of what had happened, Jill could see that something had hurt Hermione, killed some of her spark.</p>
<p>"I only wondered if you wanted to go see a movie. Apparently Princess Diaries is playing in a couple of hours. If you can stomach watching a girl's movie." Jill laughed gently and Hermione lit up. By a witch's standard, Hermione was good at doing muggle activites but the truth was that there was only so much she had time left for considering her busy work schedule. "I'd love to, Jill. I haven't been to the cinema in ages." She couldn't actually recall which movie she last saw, but what she could recall was the magical feeling from it. How weird that may sound. </p>
<p>To no surprise the cinema was crowded, both with adults and a great deal of children. Hermione shouldn't be surprised as they did chose to attend a family showing. Her and Jill was busy collect exactly what candy they wanted to bring and perhaps it was due to Ron and Harry, but over the years Hermione had grown into a bit of a sweet tooth. She found herself eating far more sweets than her parents recommended. Hermione, however, was obviously pretty good with dental hygiene and didn't really suffer any issues with it. <br/>"I just can't choose." the curly haired witch sighed laughingly. Jill snickered, while having her arms filled with a particulary large amount of sweets. Maybe being a sweet tooth was a matter of family trait. </p>
<p>"Hurry, dad! We need to get candy before it's too late." a young child, perhaps four or five, shouted ecstatic. Hermione couldn't help but smile at the sight. The little girl was wearing a princess dress, a crown on her long blond hair. In her hand she was frantically waving one of those children's wands. The type with a plastic star at the top. She was an absolutely adorable little girl and the witch could only giggle at the wand. Twenty years ago, she could of been the exact same kid. A wand in her hand, certain that she actually could perform magic, wearing huge princess dresses. She had to admit that those gorgeous blond locks of hair most likely were a little more charming than her own bushy brown hair. </p>
<p>The pair went to pay for their sweets, and Hermione couldn't keep the smile from her lips. She really lit up at the sight of that little girl. She recalled when she first discovered magic. No matter the hardship her magical abilities had brought into her life, Hermione treasured her magic far too much to ever consider that maybe it would of been for the better if she never had been a witch. During the war, the gryffindor had encountered more than one muggle born witch or wizard which almost seemed to curse their own magic. Had they never been born like this, they would never have to endure the war. </p>
<p>After they both paid, they made their way to the correct screening hall. Hermione and Jill chattered, reminding each other of all sorts of mischief from their childhood days. Jill had been the type of cousin that had brought out the mischief in Hermione. They would always have a great time and their parents would sigh and secretly laugh at the two kids. <br/>As they entered the hall, and found their seats in the far back, Hermione spotted the little girl once more. This time she was pulling on a hand. Probably her father. </p>
<p>Hermione gasped. Loudly.  <br/>As the person holding the girl's hand came in view, Hermione found herself in utter shock. <br/>Those cool grey eyes. There was no mistaking it. The apparent father of that adorable young girl was Draco Malfoy.</p>
