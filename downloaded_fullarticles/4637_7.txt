      <p>"There's room for two, budge up, love," Antonin Dolohov muttered to the love of his life. Alecto Carrow smiled at him as she moved her legs from the end of the settee so Antonin could sit down. Once he sat, he pulled her legs back onto his. Alecto smiled as she went back to the book she was reading on animagi. She had been directed by the Dark Lord to learn how to become an animagus. Alecto was always good with Transfiguration and Antonin grinned when he thought of the accolades Alecto would get from the Dark Lord once she succeeded.</p>
      <p>Antonin focused on his own book on charms. Antonin was very good with charms and had even been studying to become a Charms Master before the Dark Lord called him to his service. His Charms Mastery was put on hold to become a Death Eater. And here he was all those years later with a delightful witch and fellow Death Eater to share his bed. He was startled out of his when the book he was holding was shoved to the ground and he had an armful of witch instead.</p>
      <p>"Get off me, Witch," Antonin growled. But he didn't push her away, instead, he began kissing down her neck and suppressed a grin when she giggled. She loved having her neck kissed and claimed his beard always tickled her. He delighted in making her laugh.</p>
      <p>"Only if you get me off," Alecto panted as Antonin tweaked one of her nipples. He smoothed his hands down her sides and flipped their position so she was lying under him on the couch.</p>
      <p>"Even better," Alecto mewed as she wrapped her legs around his hips, cradling her to him.</p>
      <p>"Do we have time for this?" Antonin purred. He began unbuttoning her blouse and soon her breasts were free.</p>
      <p>"Always," Alecto hissed as the cold air hit her nipples.</p>
      <p>"Good, you are so very good," Antonin told her as he tasted her left nipple. He glanced up to watch her back arch and felt his already hard cock harden to steel. He couldn't wait to be inside his witch.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait, Antonin," Alecto whimpered. And Antonin found himself naked. He grinned, his witch was so very good at magic.</p>
      <p>As he slid inside her slick warmth, Antonin felt as though he had reached nirvana. Everything about the woman lying under him was perfection. Her dark hair, spread in a halo on the arm of the couch behind her. Her small, pert breasts that begged for his hands and tongue. Her cunt that gripped him so tightly, Antonin never wanted it to end.</p>
      <p>He slammed into her body as she clung to him, she began an unending litany of mews, "Antonin, Antonin," over and over again. They soon turned to shouts and then screams as Antonin loved her and drove her to orgasm. Watching her fly apart with his cock buried to the hilt inside her was enough, her tight pussy milked him and soon he was collapsing on top of her.</p>
      <p>"Get off me, Wizard," Alecto murmured as she pushed at his shoulders.</p>
      <p>Antonin chuckled and rolled to the side, bringing Alecto with him to cuddle.</p>
