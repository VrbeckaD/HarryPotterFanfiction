    <p>Lily Evans was unhappy.</p><p>Currently she was sitting in the library with charms textbooks laid all around her. Opened books were lounging carelessly around the table, closed books were sitting on chairs around her, waiting for their turn to invade the tabletop. Books were piled on top of each other, opened hazardously, and scattered around. It was complete book anarchy.</p><p>Sitting amongst this literary chaos, Lily was notably alone. Her loneliness was pointed, charged, and felt slightly threatening to those walking past her table.</p><p>This was not the calm loneliness of a midnight walk nor the desperate loneliness of being shunned. This was weaponised angry loneliness, made clear by the books that had been placed over the table in a way that would make it impossible for anyone to join her, or even worse, try to strike up a conversation.</p><p>It was September, so it was unusual to see student so engrossed in books. Usually the study marathons started approximately two weeks before the end of the year exams, when the library was taken over by students frantically trying to stay awake with the power of pure will and shady potions.</p><p>But Lily Evans was not really studying, as much as she was making a point. This was <em>their</em> table. <em>Hers and his</em>. And by sitting on it at Friday afternoon, she was making a point that it wasn't <em>her</em> that had given up <em>their</em> table.</p><p>From year one, Lily and Severus had spent their Friday afternoons together. Completing their weekly homework, gossiping, playing games, talking, imagining, and generally being friends. This was Their Table in the Corner.</p><p>But Severus was not here now, as he had not been any Friday since the star of this year. Their fifth year in Hogwarts, and apparently the year when Severus no longer wanted to have Friday Afternoons.</p><p>Lily pointedly was at their table, no matter what Mary or Marlene any of the other Gryffindor girls said. Every Friday she hoped that Severus would see her at their table and feel guilty. He would have deserved it. Sometimes Lily even hoped that he would come over, apologetic and sorry, and that she could leave the table in a huff and see Severus squirm.</p><p>That hadn't yet happened. Lily had seen Severus once or twice, always accompanied by his new Slytherin friends. They had their own table, where they had their own study group every Friday afternoon. The most threatening study group you would ever see in your life. They sat there, at the table nearest to the forbidden section, with their expensive robes and sharp smiles, doing homework.</p><p>At least they said that they were doing homework, Lily wouldn't have been surprised if they actually studied dark arts.</p><p>Lily had spied them from between the shelves, feeling like a creep, and hoped that she would have had the courage to walk up to them, and say something witty and cutting. It had been weeks and she still hadn’t came up with anything witty nor cutting to say.</p><p>She couldn't think of anything that wouldn't have made her sound like a jealous five-year-old, so she always glided silently back to her (their) table and continued with her “project”. (Her project was very complex as even she didn’t know exactly what it was aside from seething at Severus).</p><p>It was fine. She was having fun. She didn't even miss him. Her study project was much more interesting.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, she was having as fun as she had had the whole summer.</p><p>Petunia had been nasty to Lily ever since she went to Hogwarts, (to be honest sometimes even before that), so that wasn’t what had made this summer any worse than all the others. It had started gradually, Petunia’s escalating hate. The first summer holiday had been almost like all the others before Hogwarts, but then it had started to get worse. Petunia undermining Lily bit by bit, downplaying her experiences and making ‘jokes’ that she could always explain away as innocent enough, playful enough that she could explain them away as sisterly banter. However, from holiday to holiday she had turned worse and worse till Lily no more wished to spend time with her own sister. She felt vaguely guilty about this.</p><p>If her parents noticed the growing tension between their children, they had decided to ignore it. Anyone would say that Lily’s parents adored her, and anyone saying that would be right. They did. That didn’t change the fact that Lily had always been the odd one out in their family. Her parents did not act natural around her in the same way that they did with Petunia. Their love towards Lily was underlined and pointed, like they had to put extra effort into showing how much they loved Lily. Like they were always in danger of getting an inspection from the bureau of Loving Your Youngest Daughter. Getting her Hogwarts letter had only made things worse, as the odd one out had turned into the witch one out.</p><p>sometimes Lily felt like that after Hogwarts, her parents had started to adore ‘their witch’ more than their daughter, relieved that there was a good excuse to treat her different from Petunia. Like she was an exotic guest staying at their house, instead of a daughter.</p><p>When Lily came home, her parents wanted to hear everything she had learned, all the magical hijinks that had happened to her. All the new things she had discovered in the magical world. Every June she had to give an introduction like she was a foreign exchange student introducing her culture to the excited host family.</p><p>Never did they ask about her friends, whether she had any friends, whether she was interested in any boys at the school, if she was being bullied, how she felt being so far away from home all the time. She had turned from a daughter into a curiosity.</p><p>And then there had of course been the night her life had shattered. The trip to see grandmother in Cornwall.</p><p>(The hot summer air in Grandmother’s living room. The cold glass of lemonade in her hand. Mother drinking her third glass of gin. Father pacing the room, showcasing more emotions than Lily could ever remember. Petunia’s smug look as she had turned to look at Lily whose life had been yanked away from her, with father’s angry accusation.)</p><p>(The numbness that hadn’t even allowed her to cry.)</p><p>“This is all your fault”, Petunia had whispered that night, passing her on the hallway, in her nightgown.</p><p>After that, she had started to tick of days from her calendar till she could return to Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Even spending time with Severus wasn't as it had once been. While as children they had been inseparable, now even Severus was distancing himself from Lily. After returning from Cornwall, Lily, distraught and confused, had first sought out Severus, only to find a pale and hostile boy who turned her away from his door and was snappish and irritable at the best of times. The words that she had came to confide to him had died on her tongue, lodging in and leaving an unpleasant lump. Severus hadn’t noticed, or even worse, hadn’t cared.</p><p>For the rest of the summer, they couldn’t seem to find anything to talk about that wouldn’t anger the other. When you censored their friends at Gryffindor/Slytherin, their families, the dark arts, and the case against dark arts, there was not much left. Their silences were no longer comfortable.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, Lily’s summer had turned into long stretch of avoiding people she used to love and feeling like she was nothing more than an unwanted burden in everyone’s lives.</p><p>Now that she was at Hogwarts, she was as lonely as she had been the whole summer. She had never managed to make close friends amongst the other Gryffindors, who liked her well enough, but did not showcase this liking by actively spending time with her. In the beginning she hadn’t felt the need for other friends, because she had had Severus, and later the cliques had already been formed and Lily had been left out.</p><p>Her loneliness might have been her own fault, or it might have been because she was surrounded by treacherous and self-centred pricks, but she was not going to show how much it bothered her to anyone. That would have been pathetic. Instead she was leaning hard on her mother’s old adage: if you ignore a problem long and hard enough, it will eventually cease to exist.</p><p>Speaking of problems that did not seem to cease to exist, a shadow fell over her. As she looked up, her day went from bad to worse. James Potter was leaning on her table, smirking.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Severus Snape was anxious.</p><p>On the one hand, he had secured a place in the Slytherin créme de la créme study group. On the other hand, he wasn’t spending time with Lily.</p><p>He reasoned his sacrifice of Lily-time by remembering that his summer had been textbook definition of horrific and if he didn’t do something his schooldays might follow the pattern. The marauders were not getting any kinder and his housemates were not getting any more tolerant. If he wanted to survive, he had to start making connections. The summer had killed many things, including most of the tenderness from his heart.</p><p>Father had been worse than ever this summer. He had been recently unemployed and as a consequence had now even more time to get drunk. While Severus had gotten accustomed to his father as a spectral figure in his life, who left at the break of dawn and came back at sundown smelling of alcohol and falling unconscious at the sofa, now he was a constant, unpleasant presence.</p><p>He and mother fought more and more, the distance between them previously keeping the peace no longer there. The fragile truce of their marriage had now cracked. (cracked like-Merlin no he could not think of it, not again.)</p><p>He had been angry at mother for taking all of those insults and threats without answering with her own. She was a witch, she didn’t need to take this.</p><p>(And why, why hadn’t she done anything that solstice night)</p><p> </p><p>After the summer solstice, after mother had walked away, (expect-)</p><p>After she had walked away, it had been Severus alone with his father and it had terrified him. Father hadn’t hurt him, not really, aside from smacking him around a little and calling him names, but that wasn’t anything new to him. But still, he had been more afraid than he had ever been before, the terrible possibilities of his father’s rage without mother there to protect him clouding his mind as he tip-toed around the house.</p><p>When Lily had showed up at Spinner’s end, back from her family-holiday, he had turned her away, unable to deal with her. From then on, trying to spend time with Lily had turned more and more awkward each day.</p><p>When one censored one’s Slytherin housemates, dark arts, and one’s hatred for Lily’s Gryffindor housemates, there was not much of a conversation left. He couldn’t get the words concerning the terrible night of the solstice from his mouth and he couldn’t admit to the fear he felt deep in his bones. Not to Lily, who was made of sunshine and flowers and pretty things.</p><p>So instead of forcing his presence on Lily, he had spent almost all of his summer holed up in his room, creating curses on the edges of his notebooks, each nastier than the other.</p><p>Sectumsempra was his newest baby, and his pride and joy. Unlike Leviocorpus, which had been stolen from him the first day of this school year, sectumsempra he had kept all to himself. And he would keep it that way. He might not have anything else to be proud of, but he did have that curse.</p><p>Leviocorpus had taught him his lesson to not to try and boast about curse-making skills in the slytherin common room, lest his spells be spread around the school immediately, eventually looping back to be used against him. Sectumsempra was just for him and he would learn to use it silently, and it would keep him safe.</p><p>But the curse would not be the only thing keeping him safe this year, if he succeeded in his mission. Said mission was currently gathered around the round library table near the restricted section, with their expensive quills and calculating smiles. The Black sisters, Bellatrix and Narcissa, seventh and sixth years respectfully, sat next to each other looking beautifully bored. Severus had thought that spending all these years with Lily would have made sure that he wasn’t uncomfortable around girls, but these two aristocratic pure-bloods were like from another planet when compared to Lily. They were intimidating, but in a glamorous way. </p><p>As a complete opposite to the girls were Avery and Mulciber, two muscles with mouths attached to them, who only got passable essays done if Severus was holding their hands through the entire process. Mulciber was slightly redeemed by his face, which could have been lifted from a Greek statue, and curls of blond hair that almost begged someone to card their fingers through them. Avery had broad shoulders and nothing else, which ensured that Severus ended up spending more time pressed next to Mulciber, proof-reading his essays, than with Avery. This meant that Mulciber was currently getting slightly higher marks than Avery. It didn’t however matter much, as both of them had enormous piles of money under their name, and both treated school as a bit of a hobby to indulge in before starting their lives as heirs to old and noble houses.</p><p>Then there was Regulus Black, a boy year younger than Severus and the only one in the group who Severus might tentatively call a friend. Or maybe not a friend but an ally. Someone who did not openly despise him. It was as close to a friend that Severus was capable of making, besides Lily.</p><p>These people sitting with him at this table were all children with money and influence in high places and if Severus wanted to survive in this world, he needed their approval. From an early childhood Severus had been a survivor and survivor he had decided to continue to be. He would suffer Avery’s hatefulness, and Mulciber’s general stupidity, and the Black sisters’ patronizing dismissals, and Regulus’ casual racism, if it meant that he would be able to secure himself a future that was even slightly better than his reality right now.</p><p>Did he regret that he had to give up his Friday afternoons with Lily? Yes, but he also understood that surviving was at best unpleasant business and that he had no choice. Lily would hardly miss him anyway. she was probably happier with her Gryffindor friends.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>James Potter was restless.</p><p>He had had a pleasant summer as always, filled with sleeping in, lots of desserts, and naps in the warm sunlight of the garden. Aside from the casual bouts of boredom, it had once again been a perfect summer.</p><p>His school year had started with the same mischievous note as always. The joy of getting away from his parents, re-uniting with his mates, and setting off a dung-bomb in a train compartment full of slytherins.</p><p>Still, there was an undercurrent of anxiety in everything he did. James had known that they lived in dangerous and tumultuous times, with the war picking up speed around them, but somehow when he had been younger it hadn’t ever crossed his mind how dully unpleasant it would be to live through a time where a war was picking up speed. Stories had lied to him, failed to mention the agonisingly slow march of time, and the mundanity of the little announcements of deaths in the newspapers. There weren’t heroics being done by courageous aurors, and the enemy refused to be a visible and easily recognised threat that you could point out on the streets. Instead they insisted on hiding behind the visor of everyday people.</p><p>When James had been eleven, and there had been whispers of a war in the horizon, he had hoped that the war would still be going on when he would graduate Hogwarts, so that he too could catch some death eaters, become famous, and bring honour to the Potter name. These days his opinion was starting to tentatively change.</p><p>There was something about this summer and James’ trust in stories. His mother’s soothing voice came to mind, as did the image of her kneeling in front of the fireplace.</p><p>But at least at home the war stayed on the pages of the newspaper, and you could choose not to read. In Hogwarts it was different.   </p><p>Just this morning, someone had painted the words “blood purity” into the second-floor corridor wall, next to the charms classroom. There wasn’t anything to be done, expect for Filch to scrub the words out. It was a little evil that managed to bring down everyone’s mood for the rest of the day, for which no one would get punished.  </p><p>The world seemed to be full of little evils that made your days slightly more unpleasant. Evils that you couldn’t fight against; and James didn’t handle well situations that he couldn’t solve by fighting against them.</p><p>The helplessness was starting to eat away at James, making him even more eager to prank the slytherins in ways that started to slide further and further away from what his parents would approve as harmless fun.</p><p>But what else was he supposed to do? It was clear that no justice would be given to the slimy snakes from the authorities, so he had to take justice in his own hands. He was practically doing what heroes in all of those stories did, right? His best friend was suffering in his own home, Remus had to live in fear because of his condition, and Evans had looked miserable since the start of the term. They deserved justice and James was here to deliver.</p><p>(And mother would at least approve of that. Of delivering justice? Because mother said that he was a hero, and especially good-hearted boy, and would grow up to do great things. she wouldn’t lie to him? She wouldn’t. The thing by the fire-place had been a misunderstanding-)</p><p>James found his much-needed distraction in a form of a familiar red mop of hair hunching over a table in the corner of the library. It must have been destiny that had brought him to return his transfiguration book today, at this exact time.</p><p>“Hi Lily!”</p><p>Lily looked up at him like he had personally spat on her breakfast juice. James would never do that; if he slipped something into someone’s drink the results would be hilarious not crude.</p><p>She returned back to her book like if she ignored James hard enough, he would disappear. But James was not going to give up that easily. They were conveniently alone and Snivellus was nowhere in sight.</p><p>“How was your summer?”</p><p>Lily lifted her head up again and the corners of her mouth went down. “Fine.”</p><p>“Really? Because you have been looking pretty down this whole month- “</p><p>“I said it was fine. It’s just your ugly mug that is bringing me down.”</p><p>“Oi! I have it in good knowledge that this is one of the most handsome faces in- “</p><p>“Go away.”</p><p>“What-?”</p><p>“Go away. I don’t want to play your games today Potter.”</p><p>“I’m not playing any game- “</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>James felt his own mouth slip into a frown. Lily had hidden herself behind her book again. She was usually witty and easily riled up. Her angry blush was an attractive one, and James missed it. Evans had been a complete wet blanket this whole September and no matter how much James had prodded and provoked, she had not risen up to the challenge.</p><p>“So did you finally ditch snivellus like a sane person?”</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>“You know what would cheer you up, going on a date with me. Next Hogsmeade trip, what do you say?”</p><p>“Are you fucking with me?”</p><p>“C’mon. You, me, butterbeers, having fun.”</p><p>“You set my notebook on fire just yesterday.”</p><p>“What?! it was ugly! And you spend too much time studying. And I wanted you to talk to me. I wouldn’t have to set your notebooks on fire if you paid attention to me.” James ruffled his hair and smiled his patented Charming Smile.</p><p>“That notebook was a gift from Severus.”</p><p>“Well no wonder it was so ugly! No need to thank me, I’ll happily burn all the “gifts” he’s forced on you. I’ll buy you a new one. A good looking one, with golden trim. Not cheap and terrible like that one was.”</p><p>She did not blush attractively, nor start a tirade against James, which James could tune out while looking at her pretty face. Instead something just shuttered behind her eyes, making the green in them a bit duller.</p><p>James frowned again. She looked hurt. That had not been James’ intention.</p><p>“Look I’m sorry all right! It was just a dumb notebook, I’ll buy you a new one. Exactly the same as that one was. I won’t burn any of your stuff again if you go out with me.”</p><p>Nothing. Her face slipped back behind the book.</p><p>“What do you want me to do Evans!?”</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>James was just about to say something clever and charming, that would wake her from her hibernation, when a scream tore through the otherwise silent library.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Sirius Black was angry.</p><p>Sirius had been angry for a long time now. Sometimes Sirius wondered if he had been born angry, if his first cry had never truly ended. There must have been a time when he had been happy in Grimmauld place, but for the life of him he could not remember such time.</p><p>The parcel in his hands was heavy, heavier than its physical weight. Heavy with dreams burned to grey ashes.</p><p>Clutching the package against his chest, Sirius rushed towards the library. Remus and Peter followed by his heels, but Sirius could not make sense of what they were saying. He was sure that they were saying something sensible, so he did not mind missing it.</p><p>Against the image of Hogwarts’ comforting stone walls Sirius could see another dream-like image of faded red wallpaper with its twisting vine motifs surrounding him, pushing closer and closer.</p><p>There is no red room at Hogwarts, he kept thinking to himself. There is no red room.</p><p>“Sirius, <em>where</em> are we going”?! Remus sounded faraway, even if he was only few feet behind him.</p><p>Regulus. It was Regulus. Sirius thought with anger and betrayal burning in his gut. He told <em>mother</em>!</p><p>Regulus is at the library, he is there cuddling with the other hopeful death-eaters, Sirius continued his line of thought and headed towards the library. His footsteps were now half running, Remus having to stride faster and Peter having to half-run to keep up.</p><p>That traitorous slimy snake! How could he!?</p><p>(But of course he could. How many times had he stood there, watching as the door slammed on shut on screaming Sirius.)</p><p>When Sirius entered the library, he had only one target in mind. Usually a target would mean a target for a prank, but this time his plan was much more straightforward. He needed to find his dear little brother and air some dirty matters.</p><p>This morning Sirius had noticed the small story tucked into the corner of the Daily prophet, entirely by accident. The column was so short, and the picture accompanying it so small, that it was impossible to notice the story by anything but accident. A muggle corner-store burned down by magical means. It wasn’t particularly interesting and even the writer of the story had sounded bored by it. </p><p>Sirius had recognised the place and gone cold.</p><p>(Mr. Abidi pressing notes on his hands, realising that Sirius hadn’t counted them, that Sirius didn’t know how to count them, and then teaching him. Never treating Sirius like he was stupid for not knowing. The ever-present sharp smell of cleanliness, the electric lights that <em>hummed</em>, so different from the magical candles of home, the crinkling plastic wrappers. All so alien, so wicked, so<em> cool</em>.)</p><p>For once in his life he had had something for himself. A way out. A hope that he could step out of Grimmauld place and never step back in. A real tangible feeling of muggle money in his hands, and a possibility to get something for himself that didn’t come with strings attached.</p><p>(A gentle hand on his shoulder, promising not to call the cops, and that there were places he knew for kids who needed to lay low. Sirius didn’t know what the muggle had been offering exactly, but it had made him feel something embarrassing.)</p><p>It could have been an accident, but he had known that it hadn’t been. It would have been too much of a coincidence.</p><p>The package that had arrived from his mother via owl during lunch had confirmed everything Sirius had suspected.</p><p>Tears had been threatening to burn through his eyelids as he had stared at mess spilling from the opened package.</p><p>Sirius had swallowed the tears and buried them under boiling anger that needed to be unleashed to someone who deserved it.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus Lupin was worried.</p><p>Sirius wasn’t listening to him, hadn’t really been listening to anyone the whole day. He had been irritable, snappish and hex-happy. He had made a Hufflepuff first year cry and then gotten angry at Remus for pointing out that this wasn’t what the marauders did.</p><p>Apparently, this was what the marauders did these days.</p><p>James had shrugged the whole thing off, saying that the Hufflepuff had just overreacted. Peter had been in agreement that she would see how funny the whole thing had been once she calmed down.  </p><p>Remus had said nothing after that. He was becoming a champion of saying nothing.</p><p>He told himself that he was just overreacting too. That they were his friends and this anxiety gnawing deep in his bones was an insult to the generous friendship they had offered to him.</p><p>(They knew that he was a werewolf. What if they would grow tired of him, of his anxiety and complaining and the way he was always there to ruin their fun and how they always had to go the extra mile because of his condition and and and- what if one day they would decide that they didn’t want to be his friends anymore and told everyone that he was a werewolf and he was kicked out of the school and the ministry would take him and they would degree that he had been such a bad friend that there was nothing else but the silver axe-)</p><p>The marauders were the best thing to ever happen to Remus, he was not going to be the one to ruin them. Things would get better, everyone was just going through bad time at the moment, with the war looming in the horizon and the atmosphere darkening even in Hogwarts.</p><p>One would think that after the summer holidays everyone would be relaxed and ready to face the school-year, but this summer had seemed to do nothing but wound everyone tighter. Remus could feel the simmering tension even in the Gryffindor common room. Evans haunting the place like a ghost of an angry, clenched fist. James talking about how they all <em>needed to do something </em>until everyone grew annoyed and started to give him poisonous looks that James himself seemed to be oblivious to, and Sirius… well Sirius was worrying Remus.</p><p>Sirius had an explosion locked behind his beautiful dark eyes, and the shudder that went through Remus every time he looked into them was no longer a pleasant tingle of excitement.</p><p>The marauders were drifting apart, and Remus was terrified of it. It seemed such a cruel irony that they had finally all became animagi only to be ripped apart by the rising tensions in the school.</p><p>Or maybe they would just drop Remus out. Sirius, James and Peter still seemed to be happy with each other.</p><p>Maybe next September Remus would walk this same hallway and watch as his only friends laughed and had fun and were happy without him.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time that someone he loved would have grown tired of him.</p><p>(And who was he to complain about the tension everyone had picked up from their summer holidays, when he himself could still picture so clearly the day he had gone to London with his father, eating ice-cream in st. James park, only to feel tears gather at his eyes looking at the family playing frisbee on the grass, caught between the desire for the pony-tailed woman to turn around and see him and the desire to escape and never come back.)</p><p>Sirius turned sharply around the corner, trails of grey ash fluttering to the floor from the parcel he was gripping tight against his chest. Remus knew that it had came from Sirius’ family, but he did not know the significance of the ashes. Maybe if he did, he could have helped Sirius, instead of uselessly following him around repeating platitudes.</p><p>Around the corner was the library. Sirius slammed through the doors like a man on a mission, which he was.</p><p>“Do you think he’s going to start a fight?” Panted Peter from beside Remus, where he had finally caught up with them.</p><p>“Undoubtedly.” Remus answered and hurried after Sirius. He would be there for him. Whatever it was he decided to do.</p>
<hr/><p> Regulus Black was irritated.</p><p>Snape was walking him through an arithmancy problem and doing it in the most condescending way possible. Snape was brilliant, there was no way around it, but where his brilliant mind easily danced through arithmancy equations, potion formulas and spell theory, it completely failed to decipher this to a level comprehensible for anyone else.</p><p>Avery was happy snarling and unsubtly intimidating Snape into writing his homework for him. Mulciber was happy achieving the same result with his clueless friendliness and oblivious smiles. Regulus actually wanted to learn, to understand his schoolwork. He didn’t want to be a fool and he didn’t want to be treated like a fool.</p><p>“Can you walk me through it one more time.”</p><p>If there had ever been a situation where his good breeding was being tested, it was now. Glancing across the table, he could see cousin Narcissa hide a snigger behind her hand. Regulus glowered at her, and Snape sighed like a martyr.</p><p>Cousin Bellatrix was unabashedly staring. She, like most of in the Slytherin house, found Snape to be terribly exciting, if from a safe distance. His half-blood savageness and complete lack of good breeding was a source of morbid fascination to many. The wizarding side in him shined through when it came to his intelligence, but his muggle-blood was eminent in his manners, looks and general bearing.</p><p>Right now, Regulus wished that he could be instructed by a well-bred, proper wizard, instead of having to deal with a mudblood.</p><p>“You are not listening! It doesn’t matter what the numerical values of the <em>letters</em> in a spell are, what matters are the <em>phonemes</em>. Look here. you have to separate the nucleus and coda, before you can start working out any mathematical model. Are you using the Agrippan or Chaldean method for the equations?”</p><p>Regulus knew that as a pureblood he possessed the superior mind, but sometimes it was not an easy truth to remember.</p><p>“Yes, do try to keep up dear cousin. With such <em>superb</em> tutoring-“ Bellatrix didn’t get to finish her clever jab that insulted both Regulus and Snape in the same breath. Narcissa had kicked her underneath the table, her face staying perfectly serene.</p><p>Snape didn’t seem to even notice, as he was busy crossing over what seemed to be over half of Regulus’ work, rolling his eyes in despair at the work Regulus had been quite proud of.</p><p>Regulus however didn’t get the change to find out exactly what percentage of his calculations were rubbish, as suddenly there is a presence behind them. He first notices the presence via the alarmed look that Narcissa adopts, a split second before he is showered with something grey and flaky.</p><p>“And what do we have here?! A group of slimy, <em>traitorous,</em> snakes!”</p><p>The ashes float in the air, stick into his throat, burn in his eyes, burrow deep into his hair and make him cough. In front of him, he can see burned edges of muggle money swirling and floating around.</p><p>Sirius’ secret stash. The one he had seen him fill underneath the loose floorboard. The one he had promised not to tell mother about.</p><p>The one he had told mother about, because it wasn’t right.</p><p>(And how could Sirius ever think that it was right. How could he ever justify <em>working for a muggle</em> to himself. The heir of the family, sneaking off to play cashier in some muggle hole! Whoring would have been preferable as far as mother's opinion was concerned!)</p><p>“Sirius-“ Regulus spat flakes of burned paper from his mouth.</p><p>“Don’t you even dare say my name. Not now. Not after this.”</p><p>“Why, you seem agitated, dear cousin.”</p><p>“Shut up Bella, or I will shut you up.” The wand in his brother’s hand trembled. Regulus knew enough of his brother that it was not a good sign.</p><p>“Black, out of all the miserable-“ Snape’s tone would have been easier to take seriously if he also hadn’t been showered with ashes and was now sporting a look of white-haired fury.</p><p>“Shut up Snivellus, real wizards are talking.”</p><p>“Bold of you to accuse your brother for being a traitor, when you yourself associate with known bloodtraitors every day,” snarled Avery. “And I’m being kind not calling you a bloodtraitor yourself!”</p><p>Narcissa gasped, as did Regulus. He had his disagreements with Sirius, but to accuse him of such-</p><p>“Well maybe I am. Maybe I would rather be a bloodtraitor than endure even the same air you breath, you inbred fuckwits!”</p><p>“Who is in bread?” Mulciber cocked his head and blinked confusedly.</p><p>“Aren’t you an inbred fuckwit yourself-“ Snape started, but was interrupted by Avery’s angry “Shut up Snape!” Snape shut up.</p><p>“You were the one who went against mother’s word! She told you not to mess around with muggle things! If you weren’t so wicked!-“ Regulus floundered. A memory of mother dragging screaming and struggling Sirius into the red room flashed in his mind. Mother accusing Sirius of being such wicked, <em>wicked</em> child-</p><p>(a memory violently avoided the whole summer, of going into the red room with Kreacher, opening the ornate chest in the corner-)</p><p>Sirius also went pale, before his dark eyes flashed dangerously.</p><p>Regulus found himself blasted against a bookshelf, ears ringing, and mouth wet with blood from where he had bit his tongue.</p><p>Somewhere above him, all hell had broken loose.</p><p>Struggling to his feet, Regulus caught a glimpse of cousin Bellatrix standing on the table, shooting a hex and laughing like this was the most fun she had had in years. His brother was exchanging quick wand-work with Snape, who would have been victorious if the rest of the marauders hadn’t somehow found themselves by Sirius’ side, like they always seemed to be.</p><p>Cousin Narcissa blocked one of the spells flying around, looking very uncomfortable in a clear contrast to her sister.</p><p>Finding his own wand, Regulus tried to assess the situation and decide where to aim.</p><p>The situation was beyond chaotic. Snape was on the ground, spitting out something bubbling and his mudblood friend had also materialised from somewhere and was trying to help him up. Snape seemed to be resisting her efforts, while trying to gather himself at the same time.</p><p>Mulciber was lying unconscious on the floor, but Bellatrix was flinging hexes quick enough for two people. Narcissa seemed to be caught between desire to disappear and having to block Potter’s attack. Avery, being nowhere to be seen, had apparently not been caught between such problem and had simply opted to disappear.</p><p>Lupin had his wand drawn, but looked hesitant to use it, hanging behind Sirius like an anxious shadow. Pettigrew was flinging hexes, but his aim was either tremendously bad, or he was simply excited to add to the general mayhem without any higher goal.</p><p>Before Regulus could take aim, a loud bang rang through the air, and the shrill whistle that followed cut straight to the eardrums, making everyone drop their wands on instinct and cover their poor ears.</p><p>Madam Pince was standing before them, wand raised up and face like the wrath of god.</p><p>“What-! What is the meaning of this <em>hulabaloo</em> in my library!”</p><p>Well- well fuck.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Peter Pettigrew was inappropriately giddy.</p><p>Dumbledore was staring at all of them from behind his chair and he had not even offered anyone any candies. His eyes were not twinkling from behind his half-moon spectacles. It was all very un-Dumbledorish of him, who usually treated the marauders as unexpected but welcome guests in his office every time they ended up there.</p><p>Even so, being summoned up here gave Peter a sense of a rush, which he so enjoyed.</p><p>Most people believed that Peter was a bit of a coward, and sometimes even openly questioned how he had ended up in Gryffindor. Sometimes those people were Peter himself.</p><p>But while Peter would readily admit that he was not as brave as James or Sirius, there was the rush that he enjoyed more than anything. Pulling off a prank with the marauders and not getting caught. Getting caught but charming their way back to the teachers’ good graces. With James and Sirius, everything was just a bit more exciting, bit more glamorous.</p><p>James and Sirius were the antithesis to Peter’s dull and uninspiring family. The small house in the muggle suburbs. Wizard parents who had taken the easy way out and settled amongst muggles and found their life to be a disappointment, but instead of taking any action they settled into their disappointment.</p><p>James and Sirius never settled for a disappointment, they always took action and Peter adored them for it. He loved the way he felt like part of the pure-blood elite solely by hanging around Sirius and James, both heirs to families that were not trapped amongst muggles. He loved the thrill of sneaking around with a werewolf, the rush of being so close to a dark creature.</p><p>He loved to feel like he mattered. That Blacks and Potters and other important people <em>saw</em> him. Dumbledore wouldn’t even know that he existed if he weren’t part of the marauders, but here he was now, looking straight at peter with familiarity.</p><p>This was not a life that would end like his father’s, forgotten and unimportant. Peter had friends in high places.</p><p>“Might someone share some light to what just happened in the library?” Dumbledore asked the group. The marauders were lounging around like they were in Dumbledore’s office every Wednesday. In truth, they almost were.</p><p>Snape and Evans were standing next to each other, but in a very hostile manner. This made James look at them with satisfaction from time to time. The Evans-Snape paradise was finally starting to have troubles.</p><p>The Black sisters looked indignant to be dragged to the headmaster’s office, like common trouble makers.</p><p>Regulus just looked lost.</p><p>“And why aren’t Mulciber and Avery here. Seems to me like they are getting away without any consequences, again.” James pointed out. Peter preened a bit at the tone. It wasn’t any student that had the guts to stand up to Dumbledore like that.</p><p>Avery was not part of the fight that Irma had to break apart, and Mulciber was found stunned on the floor. Being unconscious is a good argument against him having participated to the fight to the effect you all did.</p><p>James snorted loudly and derisively. </p><p>“And as a headmaster, it is my discretion to choose who serves detention for this incident and who doesn’t, not yours Mr. Potter. Otherwise there would be nothing tethering you four trouble-makers.”</p><p>The headmaster winked at the marauders.</p><p>“By Irma’s account, I have decided that everyone who was at the scene with their wand in their hand, will be serving detention tonight with Hagrid.”</p><p>“With the <em>gamekeeper</em>!”</p><p>“For how long?”</p><p>Said both Black sisters simultaneously.</p><p>“As long as it takes for your group to do the task that Hagrid will give you.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Dear Miss. Black, this is not a negotiation.”</p><p>Bellatrix kept staring at Dumbledore as if she wanted to skin him but did not say anything more.</p><p>“detention <em>with</em> the Slytherins?” Sirius took up the objections, eyeing his brother in a way that made everyone know where his main problem lay.</p><p>“Indeed. Maybe some hard, manual labour together will bring you together. Now, I suggest that you go spend the rest of the evening out of trouble and are ready and prepared by midnight.”</p><p>Everyone looked very displeased by Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes that suggested a joke at all of their expense.</p><p>“But we do have classes tomorrow morning,” Narcissa tried to reason.</p><p>“And maybe tomorrow you will be too tired to create more trouble in my school.”</p><p>In a mutinous silence, the students filed out of the office, the marauders already bent close together.</p><p>“Detention with the Slytherins, are you thinking what I’m thinking?”</p><p>“Sirius please. Can we at least serve this detention out of the way before getting new ones?”</p><p>“Remus don’t be like that. This is a perfect opportunity, Peter what do you say?”</p><p>“I’m game.”</p><p>Peter was always game.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Narcissa Black was resigned.</p><p>She was resigned to many things, the detention of tonight in the end being the least of them. She was resigned to the fact that her cousin would never come back to the good graces of the society, no matter how much Regulus might wish otherwise. She was resigned to the tension in the school, to the whispered conspiracies in the corridors and the creeping way politics made its way into every conversation.</p><p>She was resigned to mother locking herself into the library to cry where no one could see, after Andi had left.</p><p>She was trying to be anything but resigned to the news of her engagement.</p><p>Sitting on a recess in the common room, Narcissa let her forehead rest against the glass window, staring at the greenish water of the lake. She thought that she might have seen a figure of a mermaid pass by in the distance but could not be sure.</p><p>It was calming, letting her eyes rest on the dark waters beyond the glass. You could almost imagine being submerged, floating in the gentle darkness.</p><p>She fingered the expensive parchment in her hands, with its expert cursive script declaring words of love. Words picked carefully, flowing easily in their compliments and tender allusions for future. They were pretty and skilfully chosen, and devoid of any real emotion.</p><p>Passionate love was the death of sensibility and any chance of true happiness, Narcissa knew this, had witnessed it first-hand this summer, and it wasn’t any silly romanticism that was making her so uneasy. It wasn’t that she doubted Lucius Malfoy’s character, or that her heart would have been set on anyone else. And She didn’t think herself to be difficult girl who liked to be contrary just for the sake of it.</p><p>Her mother was a modern-thinking witch, who had promised to all of her daughters that they would be allowed to finish their education in Hogwarts before their weddings. No modern wizard wanted a wife who was stupid or couldn’t hold an interesting conversation. The days of wives being hidden in their chambers when visitors came over were gone and not missed.  </p><p>Narcissa’s wedding would be almost two years off, and still she wished that the letter had not arrived.</p><p>Truth to be told, there had been a certain enjoyment in uncertain future. She hadn’t known where she would move after her studies were over. Who she would marry. What future would bring. For many, this uncertainty was a source of anxiety, and for girls coming from lesser houses it might have been different. Narcissa never had to doubt that her match would be impressive, only to dream of the different shapes it might take.</p><p>Now the mystery was gone. Now she knew that she would become the mistress of Malfoy Manor, dining on peacock, walking the gardens with Lucius Malfoy, signing her letters as Mrs. Malfoy, giving birth to (Merlin bless her) several little Malfoy heirs.</p><p>Surely, she couldn’t have imagined a life more splendid, more blessed than that.</p><p>(Expect that she could. They were girlish fancies, but she couldn’t help them. Because all her fancies were unlimited, easy to dispel or built on, inconsequential and hazy like vapours. Silly daydreams that didn’t bind her to anything.)</p><p>She was afraid that this was the same uneasiness that had driven Andromeda to her folly and consequently mother to her despair and father to his anger. Had not driven Bellatrix to much of anything that she hadn’t already always been, and wasn’t that even more scary.</p><p>Young witches should be careful to keep their flighty emotions hidden and guarded, for modesty in both actions and thoughts was the best ornament a witch could ever own. Narcissa knew this and she was trying as hard as she could. Despite her best efforts, emotions were wreaking havoc in her mind.</p><p>Fear of the future. Not the modest nervousness of a maiden, but deep-seated dread of being trapped in a life that would turn against her. Unexplained loathing that from time to time would grip her as she thought of the courtship before her. Bouts of wild passion as she gazed at the Forbidden Forest and the inappropriate thoughts the dark paths, the twisting branches, and the wild animals running untethered underneath the branches, kindled in her.</p><p>“Hello Cissy.”</p><p>She was also resigned to the presence of Bellatrix in her life.</p><p>“Hello Bella.”</p><p>“Aunt Walpurga is right, Dumbledore has lost any respect for proper wizardkind that he might have ever had. Serving detention with that half-breed servant. And with mudbloods and bloodtraitors, as if they hadn’t been the ones to attack <em>us</em>.”  </p><p>“Indeed.” Narcissa answered and hoped that her sister would leave. Narcissa was in one of her moods and didn’t wish anyone to notice it. She couldn’t stand it if mother started to watch her the same way she had watched Andi the last few months before she eloped.</p><p>“I hope that <em>he</em> can get rid of the old fool soon. This school is losing all of its dignity with Dumbledore in charge.”</p><p>“I quite agree.”</p><p>“Well, hopefully <em>he</em> can fix things up.”</p><p>“Bella please, you know how politics bore me.”</p><p>Bellatrix huffed in disgust. “You are such a little<em> flower,</em> Narcissa. One would think you are still stuck in the last century. <em>He</em> wants young witches to join the cause just as wizards.”</p><p>“Well, I’m glad that you and Rodolphus have something to do together.”</p><p>“You know that I’m not talking about Rodolphus.”</p><p>She did know. She was just trying to avoid the subject.</p><p>“No matter. We are going to take action soon. Very soon.” Bellatrix smiled so happily that Narcissa’s blood immediately ran cold. She remembered that smile, in all of its girlish glory. Could remember Artemis, and the dirt under her fingernails, and Bellatrix smiling through the whole ordeal.</p><p>She didn’t ask what action. She just rested her forehead back against the glass and watched from the corner of her eye as Bellatrix went away, with a little skip on her step.</p><p>Suddenly she felt less resigned for their detention and more scared.  </p><p> </p>
