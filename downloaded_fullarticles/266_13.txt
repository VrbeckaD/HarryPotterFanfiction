    <p>                                                                                                             <u>CHAPTER 1</u></p><p>     The first thing Harry noticed as he regained consciousness was the pain. His head, wrists, shoulder, stomach, and jaw. There may have been more, but those hurt enough that he couldn’t notice others.<br/>He cracked his eyes open and took in the sight before him. He was surrounded by black stone walls on four sides, ceiling, and floor. His arms were chained over his head to the wall. His shoulder was obviously dislocated out of the socket. He was further exploring when he noticed his stomach, it was slightly bigger than he remembered. He was already very skinny due to his family’s abuse and starvation. You could see every broken and bruised rib.</p><p>
  <em>     Great. I am bleeding into my stomach. How long have I been here? Where am I?</em>
</p><p>    His thoughts were soon interrupted by the door opening. A man stepped inside. He looked completely normal except for the dark, blood red eyes.</p><p>   “Hello, Potter. How is my tadpole doing?”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to respond but no sounds emerged.</p><p>“Oh, that’s new. Cat got your tongue?” the man laughed. “Well, Potter, no issue, I’ll just send in the healer to check tadpole for you.”</p><p>With that he turned and swept out of the room, robe flapping behind him.</p><p>
  <em>     What is happening? Why can’t I talk. I have got to get out of here.</em>
</p><p>He pulled at the chains around his wrist. Already bloody and raw from prolonged exposure to the chains. After an hour of no progress he dropped his hands. He felt hopelessness seep in. One thought kept pulling at the back of his brain.</p><p>
  <em>     What is a tadpole?</em>
</p><p>He flopped his head back a little too hard. The blackness pulled at his vision. The door opened and black clad feet appeared just before the darkness took over.</p><p>He didn’t know how long he had been swimming in the darkness when he heard the voice pull him back.</p><p>     “Potter. Potter, you need to wake up. Potter. Harry?”</p><p>Harry’s eyes crack open, but immediately snap closed. The lights cause his head to flair in pain. He grimaced in pain.</p><p>    “Could you dim the lights? Okay, Harry the lights are lower. Can you open your eyes? I need to check you over.”</p><p>His eyes flutter open and he looked for the source of the soothing voice. Severus Snape sat next to him on the bed.</p><p>    “Okay, Harry, I'm going to look you over is that alright?”</p><p>Harry gulped hard then nodded and Snape took off to work. Healing his shoulder, wrist, legs, chest, and other injuries. While that was happening he took in his surroundings. He was at the hospital wing in Hogwarts.</p><p>
  <em>     Where are all the other students? The term does not end for another four months.</em>
</p><p>“Harry, what do you remember?”</p><p>      Harry tried to speak yet again, but no sound emerged from his mouth, so he shook his head. He couldn’t remember anything from after he was taken. He could remember talking about a study schedule for next years N.E.W.T.S. with Ron and Hermione while walking back to his dorm. Then could only remember the one conversation with that man.</p><p>    “Okay, Harry, you were kidnapped approximately six months ago. The Dark Lord had a spy in the school who saw an opportunity to gain level with Him. He has yet to be caught or revealed. I on the other hand revealed myself as a spy to free you. We will find a way to restore your speech. There seems to be no physical reason. Maybe a spell, maybe not. I promise we will find it.”</p><p>
  <em>     Oh sweet Merlin. What the hell happened? Where is my wand?</em>
</p><p>Harry made a motion with his hand to signal his last thought.</p><p>    “Your wand is here. You must have dropped it when you were grabbed.” He reached over to the side table and picked it up. Handing it to Harry he said, “Good thing we made you master nonverbal magic.”</p><p>Harry nodded and wrote in the air, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?</p><p>     “You had several lacerations, all of which I healed. Unfortunately most were too deep to not scar, like the ones on your wrist. Many bruises, all gone. Dislocated shoulder, broken femur and tibia, several broken ribs, concussion, and broken jaw. I have healed almost everything.”</p><p>WHAT ABOUT THE BLEEDING INTO MY STOMACH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALMOST EVERYTHING?</p><p>     “Well there was no internal bleeding, which leads to the next question. Harry, the reason you were kept alive is because you possess a very rare magical ability the Dark Lord took advantage of. He planned to keep you longer then kill you.”</p><p>Harry’s mind is zooming.</p><p>    <em>What is wrong with me? I am already a freak, what else is there? Please don’t give people another reason to stare at me.</em></p><p>“Harry you are eighteen weeks pregnant. With the Dark Lord's baby.”</p><p>    <em> Tadpole?</em></p>
