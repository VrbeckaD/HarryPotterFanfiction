    <p>Since they were adults, they received their own rooms at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Returning to the school which always was their home was like an embrace from an old, familiar friend. Even with some damages to its structure, it was a place of their childhood, unchanged.</p>
<p>Yet, they personally couldn't have been any different. </p>
<p>Ron, the trickster in many ways grew up so much he rather didn’t return to school but split his time between helping out George and his parents. George couldn’t manage the store alone, and their parents lost the Burrow, their family also grieving.</p>
<p>Hermione also finally stopped nagging people about the marks they got on every homework, essay, and test. Instead, she submitted the DADA club officially for approval and begun teaching everyone, even magicals as young as first-years. She also worked at the Library part-time, helping out Madam Pince. Harry supposed it was her way of finding a cause that was worth fighting, as Ron’s support of his family was a showcase of his strength. Harry wished he had something like that.</p>
<p>It’s not because he didn’t count on surviving the war that he didn’t have any concrete plans where he should go with his future. Even before, saying he wanted to become an Auror was just a choice of convenience since he was good with DADA. And he was only good because he had practiced a lot with Remus.</p>
<p>He picked up Quidditch again, true, and trained the team of Gryffindor, even if he no longer participated in games because of his age which could be considered an unfair advantage. It was a good way to get out of his head, yet it was supposed to be a thing that he did when he didn't pursue his goals in life, not the only thing he did.</p>
<p>So when acting Headmistress McGonagall was calling after him on the corridor, he turned the corner quite quickly, pretending not to hear, avoiding her. She was like a mother to him. How could he disappoint her so when she told him she was looking forward to talking to him about his future again?</p>
<p>It felt like the whole Wizarding World was waiting for his answer on the topic, and he was used to it, but it certainly didn't help. What was he supposed to do?</p>
<p>If fate existed like Dumbledore and Voldemort led everyone to believe with the prophecy, why didn't it pull Harry in one direction or another?</p>
<p>Of course, the answer might have been in the question. He was Dumbledore’s man throughout. Dumbledore was his guide on the other side, his mentor. A light that you can follow in the dark, much like Ron’s Deluminator. Yet, Dumbledore also controlled Harry, as a puppet master would a toy.</p>
<p>Making Harry just run away to get a shower after a gruesome practice, oblivious to the real reason why Minerva wanted to talk to him.</p>
