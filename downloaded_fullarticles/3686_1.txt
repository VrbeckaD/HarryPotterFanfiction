    <p>“No!” Sirius Black half-sobbed half-cried, choking on the word in a vain attempt to deny the horrible truth. It couldn’t be. It was the worst of his worst nightmares. His best friend… his brother! He couldn’t believe James was dead. And Lily too. “No! No, no, no…” His voice was pleading now. He closed his eyes, but he couldn’t stop the image of their dead bodies to pop on the screen of his mind. The more he tried not to think about it, the more vivid it was.</p><p>It was driving him insane.</p><p>As was the knowledge that he had killed them as surely as if he had cast the spells himself.</p><p>If he had gone through with Dumbledore’s plan, if he had become the Potters’ Secret Keeper as he was supposed to be, James and Lily would still be alive. Harry wouldn’t be an orphan. He would still be the happy and laughing one-year-old baby Sirius had bounced on his knee every time he had visited with his friends. Sirius would never, ever, have given away their location to anyone. He would never have done anything that could arm James and his family. They were the only true family he had ever had and he would have died to keep them safe. But, no, he had to be the one to tell James it would be safer to have Peter Pettigrew as their Secret Keeper instead. He, Sirius, was the obvious choice, which wouldn’t do to keep them safe. He had done his best to persuade both James and Lily, and in the end, they had believed themselves that his plan was brilliant. They had even agreed that Albus Dumbledore didn’t have to know. No one had to know, not even Remus. It would be safer that way. Though no one else did, the Marauders knew Peter’s true colors. He had managed to become an Animagus - albeit rather slowly and with Sirius’ and James’ help, but he still had, in the end – which was no small feat after all. The idea was that Voldemort and his minions would never suspect Peter was the Potters’ Secret Keeper, he had always been the one people dismissed as insignificant at first sight. But Sirius, James, and Remus knew Peter better than anyone else… or so they had thought.</p><p>Sirius had been wrong, terribly, horribly wrong. He had been so proud of his own plan - no one would ever know, and they would be the end of Voldemort and his Death Eaters! He wasn’t a coward – that wasn’t why he had switched with Peter. He knew he would have kept the Potters’ secret to the grave. And then, what…?</p><p>The question had haunted him, night after night, after Albus Dumbledore had come to talk to him about the Fidelius Charm. That’s when his dilemma started - he could keep the Potters safer than anyone else, but everyone knew he was James’ best friend and as soon as they would all disappear, he’d become the most wanted man in the Wizarding world. He would have to be very careful not to make any mistake or he would be caught. He hadn’t been afraid to die, but of the consequences of his death.</p><p>Sirius had been unable to sleep until he’d finally known what had to be done.</p><p>Peter had been scared the first time he’d approached him, but he too had been convinced by Sirius’ arguments. Nothing would change, after all. The Death Eaters would still try to find Sirius, thinking he was the only one who could lead them and their master to the Potters. Sirius would act as a decoy, and he would do so gladly. He was a Marauder; he would lead them on a merry chase - literally -, a chase they would never forget, he would make sure of that.</p><p>Sirius barked out a mirthless laugh that sounded like the death call of a crow and hissed, “Peter, you son of a bitch!”</p><p>Peter had sold the Potters to Voldemort. He had betrayed them without the slightest hesitation. He was a coward and a traitor, and his weakness put a stain of shame to the name of the Marauders.</p><p>In their first year at Hogwarts, James and Sirius had befriended Remus Lupin, who himself had befriended Peter Pettigrew, the short and plain boy who had been sorted in Gryffindor against all odds. Peter had been happy to have friends and he’d started making progress. He would never have become the wizard he was today if not for James Potter. And Lily… Lily had always been an angel. As fiery as her temper could be at times, she had always been nice to Peter. She would talk to him whereas she made a point to ignore James.</p><p>Sirius let out a strangled sob. Thinking about them, he felt like his heart was ripped out of his chest all over again, still beating, and then replaced by an anger so hot it was like a living thing clawing at his flesh and bones - he’d find Peter and he would make him pay! He didn’t have anything to lose anymore.</p><p>His rage was the only thing that kept him from drowning in his own despair.</p><p>Sirius couldn’t believe what had just happened!</p><p>As he was trying to catch his breath, he told himself he should have known that a cornered rat would do anything to escape… even fake his own death.</p><p>Sirius was angry… at himself. Now the Wizarding world would believe he’d killed James and Lily Potter as well as Peter Pettigrew and a few Muggles. Except Sirius hadn’t cast the spell that had blown the whole place to bits, even though he’d been in a rage, he knew he had not. So it had to be Peter himself.</p><p>Sirius knew he didn’t have much time left before he was caught by the Aurors. The shock of being bested by Peter had been like a catalyst. He could try again to catch Peter to expose him - because he knew Peter was alive – or he could make everything right again.</p><p>He might be caught trying, but he was a Marauder and so he would try nevertheless. If he died, he knew the Death Eaters would probably finish what he’d started and kill Peter, whom they thought was responsible for Voldemort’s death.</p><p>A few seconds later, he apparated as close to the Ministry of Magic as he could.</p>
