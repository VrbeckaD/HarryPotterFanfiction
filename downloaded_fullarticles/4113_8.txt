  <em>“Bad timing on my strike.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’ll get better. It still died, didn’t it? Your venom’s working.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I need to be faster.”</em>
</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but laugh. <em>“Eriss, you hatched a </em>month<em> ago. You probably shouldn’t even be eating a mouse that size.”</em></p><p>Eriss, for being a snake, was surprisingly expressive. Or maybe that was just that Harry hadn’t really talked to anyone else in the last month and a half, which resulted in knowing her quite well. Either way, when she lifted her head, he could easily tell she was glaring at him.</p><p><em>“Don’t choke this time</em>,” he said innocently.</p><p>Alekta <em>kree</em>ed at them both and tore into her own dinner, a pigeon, leaving Eriss to huff at them both before she cracked her jaw open and started working on the juvenile mouse Alekta brought back for her. Harry knew from experience Eriss would spend five or so minutes eating and then sleep for a day or two—she could get very pissy if you woke her up after she’d eaten—so he left her to her business and went back to his reading.</p><p>One of the odd things about wizarding literature was the lack of a decent selection of fiction books. Harry figured it had something to do with population sizes. Nonfiction books there were in abundance, but fiction books were either terrible, thinly veiled plagiarism of Muggle books, or moving-picture graphic novels that held his interest for a few days before he got sick of the clichéd dialogue. Harry had gone back to Muggle fiction within two weeks of coming home from school and found, to his delight, that there was a bookstore only a fifteen-minute walk away. He’d written Gringotts, had thirty or so galleons changed to pounds, and spent an entire day there. It was another two days of work to configure his trunk’s library compartment to have a separate storage-and-display section for fiction novels. Between those and the books he periodically ordered from Flourish and Blotts, he had plenty of reading to keep him occupied this summer. He opened the one he’d left out on his desk before his measly dinner and happily escaped back to someone else’s problems. </p><p>Alekta’s irritation distracted him around midnight.</p><p>Harry looked up. Several other owls were perched on his windowsill or flying towards it. Most had letters; a few carried packages. He couldn’t stop himself from grinning like an idiot. He had <em>friends</em> who remembered his <em>birthday</em>. He’d been writing them all summer but that didn’t make the happiness any less.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Happy birthday! I know you’re keeping letter writing to a minimum so you don’t irritate your relatives with owls all over the place, but honestly, I wish we could write more. I’ve been reading about wandlore this summer in light of what you and Theo told me about Neville’s wand. My allowance only covered three books and I’ve read them all cover to cover, of course, and it’s actually quite fascinating, I really wish I could order more but I suppose I’ll have to wait until we get back to school and use the Hogwarts library. </em>
</p><p>Harry laughed. It was so Hermione.</p><p>
  <em>The point is, Neville really ought to be using a wand that chose him! Some family wands choose a descendant, I read, but it’s fairly rare, and one book hinted it had to do with magical inheritances, but there wasn’t anything else on that subject. I will definitely be researching magical inheritances this year, too. (You should. It may have something to do with why you’re a Parselmouth but no one else in your family is.) Using the wrong wand for too long when your magical core is developing can even cause problems with your magic—make it either harder to call on, because using the wrong wand means you never properly learn how to access your magic, or more volatile. One author seems to suggest the volatility or lack thereof is due to your magical core being semi-sentient, which frankly seems like rather a load of tosh to me, but I suppose it’s not impossible. Stranger things have happened with magic. If you have any books on these subjects, would you be willing to loan them to me? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ve been over at Neville’s and Blaise’s houses a bit with the others, practicing spellwork and such. It’s a bit frustrating that I can’t do magic at my house, but I’ll manage, I suppose. </em>
</p><p>Of course she would, Hermione was one of the most gifted students in their entire school, as far as Harry could tell.</p><p>
  <em>Blaise’s mum’s wedding sounds like it will be terribly exciting. I’ve never seen a wizarding wedding before. My mum and dad were a bit hesitant to let me go, but I showed them the pictures of Casa Zabini and assured them Blaise’s mum has staff around so we won’t be unsupervised. They don’t really understand that wizarding children tend to be more independent.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Do you know if you’ll be allowed to leave your relatives’ after the wedding? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Hermione</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry scowled. He didn’t need the reminders that Dumbledore, apparently, thought the wards needed “repairing” so Harry had to spend as much of the summer as possible at Number 4, Privet Drive. He had no plans of going back after the wedding, but he hadn’t put up a fuss about losing two-thirds of his summer. He was twelve—thirteen now, actually—and that meant he had no chance of going toe-to-toe with Dumbledore and James Potter either legally or not.</p><p>Yet.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Happy Birthday, Harry! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hope the Muggles are treating you all right. I know you said you were going to scare them with your tricks but—if the Trace picks up on anything, it’d be bad. I mean, I know you know that, but still. Be careful, all right? I don’t want to be stuck with your brother next year. (At least Hermione and the twins make Gryffindor bearable.) </em>
</p><p>Harry smirked. Neville didn’t need to worry. A few subtle threats, a few things subtly moving without anyone touching him, and Dudley had quit bothering him entirely. Vernon still hadn’t caught on and Petunia could never disguise the disgust in her eyes when she looked at him, but their truce had held for almost two months. She fed him meager rations; he went for walks and supplemented them with trips to the grocery store; they didn’t try to force chores on him and he stayed out of everyone’s way.</p><p><em>Speaking of Hermione—she’s been on me about getting a new wand. Very unsubtly, actually. She wrote me saying “Neville, you really must get a new wand” and proceeded to list all the reasons why. I think I’ve been spending too much time with you Slytherins if I’m actually expecting subtlety from my friends</em>! <em>But I guess she made some interesting points… do you really think I ought to get a new one? Gran’s been easier this summer—I tried to channel you and she was shocked the first few times I did something sarcastic, but she actually seems to find it funny—but I don’t know about the wand? She’s so touchy about my dad…</em></p><p>
  <em>See you at Countess Zabini’s wedding! Hermione’s been talking about dueling you for weeks, she thinks she can win since she’s gotten to practice this summer and you haven’t. Oh—Merlin, that was tactless of me—well, whatever, now you know. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Neville</em>
</p><p>True, Harry’s pleasure at reading his friends’ letters was diminished by the reminder that he couldn’t practice magic… but he’d memorized loads of new spells and from there it wouldn’t be <em>too</em> hard to transfer it to practice. Except charms. He was getting better at charms, but unlike transfiguration and curses, he had a difficult time casting charms the first few times he tried.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Happy birthday from Theo and me—he still refuses to sit down and write letters. He won’t tell me what he got you; let me know when you write back. Especially if it’s interesting. Are you the one who got him started reading Muggle novels? He wouldn’t shut up about them last month, and I finally agreed to try one—I must admit, this Conan Doyle is an admirable writer. I suppose wizards haven’t got as much time to sit around and come up with fictional worlds and people and write about them; there’s too few of us. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m not sure if Daphne wrote you this, but Tracy’s parents are moving—they’re sending her to Ilvermorny in the States from now on. Something to do with her dad’s job.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>So. Before you come to Mum’s wedding… my uncle Matteo is going to take you and Justin out for a day in Venice. Not tourism. There’s a small wizarding community here—not quite on par with Diagon Alley, but some of the wizarding world’s finest tailors. Matteo’s going to make sure the both of you have a full wardrobe with two-year growing charms befitting the heir to a Noble and Ancient house, and a Muggle-born who nonetheless represents one of Muggle Britain’s most successful families. (Hermione looked up the Finch-Fletchleys and I’m highly impressed. His parents may be Muggle but they are exceedingly clever businesspeople. He even told me he suspects his mother would’ve sorted into Slytherin, imagine!) At any rate, I understand they can afford the expense. Matteo’s also going to ensure the both of you know all the manners and etiquette that will be expected of you. I know you think you’ve done quite well with integration, Harry, and you have, for a Muggle-raised wizard who has learned mostly from books, but there’s only so much books can teach you. Don’t argue with me on this. And before you ask, Daphne and her mum are taking Hermione out for a similar trip, except in London before we all leave. Daphne’s parents own a clothing line and I convinced Daphne to outfit Hermione as a gift. </em>
</p><p>Harry winced. That was as likely to end with Hermione burning all the clothes just to get back at Daphne as it was to be helpful.</p><p>
  <em>Don’t worry, I warned Daphne to tone down her usual Ice Princess thing and make an effort to be tactful. It’d help if you hinted at Hermione to just shut up and go with it—not that she’s ever shut up and gone with anything in her life, I doubt she really knows how, but if both of them try I think it can result in something other than literal flames.</em>
</p><p>That elicited a genuine smile. He and Blaise knew each other—and Daphne and Hermione—well. The smile faded quickly, though. Harry <em>had </em>thought he was doing well with managing to appear as a properly wizard-raised child, but Blaise had a point—there were things you couldn’t learn from books. As Harry had no intention of having anything to do with Muggle London aside from bookstores once he no longer had to come back to the Dursleys’ every summer, he supposed it would be a good thing to accept social tutoring from a Zabini.</p><p>If this Matteo even was a Zabini. Probably not. Harry suspected a family acquaintance. Matteo must be one of the rare men who could resist Countess Zabini and therefore last long enough to get close enough to the family for Blaise to call him ‘uncle’ and trust him with this task. He just hoped the man wasn’t too hard on Justin.</p><p>
  <em>Justin’s mum’s agreed to pick you up—he said he’d write you with the details. August 10<sup>th</sup>. Be prepared. He told Neville and me last week his parents ranted about your uncle’s nastiness for the whole “car ride” home from the station and hinted Mr. Finch-Fletchley plans to do something dramatic when he comes to get you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Blaise</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The letter left Harry extremely curious about Theo’s gift; he set aside the letters from Daphne, Pansy, Justin, Fred, George, and Ginny, and several other students from his year and the one below in school who he was friendly enough with to exchange birthday well-wishes to open the parcel Blaise’s owl had brought.</p><p>Harry’s smile came back, full force. <em>Maybe you’ll teach the Quidditch boys a thing or two yourself this year</em>, Theo had scrawled on the inside of the brown wrapping paper. Harry flipped through the book inside and strongly suspected he would be. These spells were not Light. In fact, he strongly suspected James might turn caught his older son with this. It was darker than anything Harry’d managed to find in the Potter library and <em>definitely</em> darker (and more useful) than anything you could buy at Flourish and Blotts.</p><p>He’d heard there was a bookstore down Knockturn Alley that sold much more interesting tomes. Harry really had to try sneaking down there sometime, if he could get away—it wasn’t the sort of place he could afford to get caught, not while he was trying to stay below James’ sight and out of Dumbledore’s crosshairs.</p><p>Blaise had sent a silver ring carved with runes that, according to the card, would detect most common poisons in one’s food or drink and heat up to warn the wearer. Harry wondered if it was a long-term thing or if he should be worried about poison in the wedding toast. The others sent a combination of sweets, a specialty broom-care kit as a collective gift from the Weasley children he was on good terms with (Ginny’s note hinted that Evalyn and Natalie had helped out, while the twins’ said it outright; Ginny really was getting to be a good Slytherin), books from Justin, Hermione, and Pansy, and a well-tailored summer robe from Daphne that was accompanied by a vaguely threatening command to wear it while he went shopping with Blaise’s ‘uncle’. Harry snickered at the note—so classically Daphne—and sat down to write replies.</p><p>He was halfway done when another owl arrived in an irritated flurry of wings. Alekta shrieked again, which resulted in an enraged bellow from Vernon’s room and a fifteen-minute fight about <em>that ruddy bird</em> wherein Harry deliberately provoked his <em>uncle</em> so the man was too angry to register the gifts and letters hastily and badly hidden under Harry’s desk.</p><p>When he finally left, Harry scowled at the new owl. “And who sent you?” he muttered, stroking the bird’s back and offering it a treat before picking up the parcel it had dropped on his desk.</p><p>Jules. Of course. If his brother ever managed to do anything on time, Harry would be shocked. The gift included a polite note from Jules, a pair of Quidditch gloves—honestly, did he ever think of anything else? Or notice that Harry couldn’t exactly have gone an entire year on his House team without getting a pair on his own? —and a terse note from James expressing obviously insincere regrets that Harry hadn’t been able to come to the Boy Who Lived’s birthday gala that year. Harry’s scowl deepened. He barely noticed when the Potter owl took off. He’d sent Jules an autographed collection of Seeker drills written by the legendary Brazilian Seeker, Davi Cardoso, and written perfectly warm and polite letters to both his brother and his father, though he nearly ground his molars down to stubs while he did so. <em>He</em> at least had put in an effort.</p><p>James’ letter burst into flames.</p><p>Harry jumped and put it out hurriedly before the smoke set off the detector in his ceiling. He hadn’t lost control of his magic like that in… a long time.</p><p><em>Spend more time on Occlumency exercises tonight</em>, he told himself firmly. Trust his infuriatingly Gryffindorish father to manage to break Harry’s self-control, which was excellent for a twelve—thirteen-year-old.</p><p>
  <em>Thirteen. I’m thirteen now. Only four years left till my majority. </em>
</p><p>Harry did Occlumency breathing exercises. The Occlumency books he’d managed to get his hands on described a state of meditative calm, in which the emotions were present and could be examined but didn’t affect you, as the next step after you were good at clearing your mind. He’d started attempting that meditative state a week into the summer even though he thought he wasn’t quite ready as a way to distract himself from Dudley’s table manners, which rivaled Ron Weasley’s in their power to turn Harry’s stomach. It was a great way to stay quiet at the dinner table but he couldn’t attain the state with less than forty minutes of meditation yet. Breathing exercises would have to do.</p><p>Once he had himself firmly under control again, he shoved the remains of James’ letter behind him with the gloves and Jules’ note, where he didn’t have to look at them, and went back to responding to his acquaintances and his <em>actual</em> friends.</p><p><em>“Your family?” </em>Eriss said sleepily.</p><p><em>“Yes,” </em>Harry said.</p><p>Eriss slithered over near his feet, and he picked her up to put her on his desk—the juvenile viper didn’t like climbing when she was full. She coiled herself up around the base of his desk lamp. <em>“Can I bite your brother when I meet him?”</em></p><p><em>“I’m pretty sure that would land him in the hospital,” </em>Harry said, amused.</p><p>
  <em>“Hospital?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Where wizards go when they get sick, or hurt. Healers work in hospitals and make you better.”</em>
</p><p>This seemed to please her. <em>“So if I bit him, he’d have to go there to be cared for?”</em></p><p>
  <em>“You’re a Loharian viper. Hanna’s book said your venom’s really dangerous. You’re too small to kill him with one bite… probably. But it would still make him sick.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I definitely want to bite him.”</em>
</p><p>Harry choked on a laugh. Eriss had quite a bloodthirsty streak that reminded him she might be his familiar, but she wasn’t human, and snakes and humans had different ideas about morality and killing. <em>“If you kill him, I take the blame, and then they’ll kill you.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“Not if I’m sneaky about it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“He’s my brother, I don’t want him dead. He’s just irritating.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Snakes don’t care about killing their nest-mates once we’re grown.”</em>
</p><p>Harry tickled her head where she liked it, and Eriss leaned into his hand. <em>“It may have escaped your notice, Eri, but I’m not a snake.”</em></p><p><em>“I should hope not,” </em>she said sleepily. <em>“Then you wouldn’t be able to warm things up for me to sleep on.”</em></p><p>A few seconds later, she was obviously asleep again. Harry was careful not to disturb her as he finished off his replies, which included telling Daphne to stay in line, asking Hermione as kindly as he could manage to at least try to listen to Lady Greengrass, and requesting that Justin bring the most impressive car his family owned.</p><p>He sent them off with Alekta and yawned. One in the morning. He automatically woke up around six most mornings, but it was his tradition to stay up until midnight so he could watch the clock tick as he turned a year older. An old habit from the days when the only person celebrating his birthday was himself. Maybe he could convince his brain to let him sleep in for once if he stayed up beforehand.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, the Dursleys just had to go and ruin Harry’s birthday.</p><p>Dudley had his eyes glued to the television when Harry came downstairs at seven-thirty—he’d managed to sleep a full hour past the time Petunia had conditioned him to wake up, which he considered progress—and a newsman was warning about a highly dangerous criminal on the loose. Harry ignored it, as Muggle news didn’t really concern wizards, and helped himself to a piece of toast. Then, with a sly glance at Petunia, who was paying zero attention to him, he slipped another two under his shirt. He’d gotten to keep his trunk this summer, and he could add these to his food stash, which lived in the potions compartment and stayed fresh thanks to top-of-the-line preservation charms. Harry’s trunk contained pretty much his entire life, and he hadn’t spared a knut.</p><p>“What’s the sense having a telly in the kitchen if it only shows news?” complained Dudley, who was the reason they had a television in the kitchen at all: he’d come home from Smeltings complaining about the long walk between the living room sofa and the fridge. Harry had sorely wished the Trace was on wands and not on wizards so he could use the ash wand and charm the fridge shut. It was disgusting—both Dudley’s behavior, and how Vernon and Petunia allowed it.</p><p>Vernon started ranting about how “these useless layabouts” could only be dealt with by hanging. Harry thought about Occlumency and ate his toast as quickly as he could without Petunia glaring at him for leaving crumbs on the counter.</p><p>“—and Marge’s train gets in at ten—”</p><p>Harry’s Occlumency shattered. “Aunt Marge?”</p><p>“Yes, boy,” Vernon said nastily.</p><p>Harry’s heart thumped. The Dursleys already knew about magic. Under the Statue of Secrecy, they were ‘exposed Muggles’—he could talk about magic around them, technically, if not perform it until he was of age, and then under very, <em>very</em> stringent restrictions. Marge wasn’t. Which meant the Trace would be more sensitive in her presence. Which meant he’d have to be ten times as careful, <em>and</em> he wouldn’t be able to shove Petunia’s chair out from under her if she made any nasty comments about him.</p><p>“She’ll be here for a week,” Vernon continued. His expression was ugly. “And while we’re on the subject, there’s a few things we need to get straight.”</p><p>Dudley managed to tear his eyes away from the telly. Watching Vernon rip into Harry was one of his favorite pastimes. Unfortunately for all of them, Harry had grown teeth in the last few years.</p><p>“Like how she’s been tormenting me for years?” Harry said coldly. “Dogs that attack people can legally be euthanized, <em>Uncle</em> Vernon.”</p><p>As he’d predicted, the family title made Vernon’s red skin get redder. “You’ll keep a civil tongue in your head while you talk to her.”</p><p>“If she does when speaking to me,” Harry agreed pleasantly.</p><p>Vernon kept going as if Harry hadn’t said anything. “Marge knows nothing about your—your <em>abnormality</em>. There’ll be no <em>funny business</em> while she’s hear or I’ll—report you to that Ministry of yours!”</p><p>“As if they’d take the word of a filthy Muggle,” Harry sneered, partly because it was true and even <em>if</em> anyone decided to do something he could always excuse the Dursleys’ lies with <em>oh, I’m so frightfully sorry, but they—they just treat me so horribly, ma’am, sometimes my magic slips out, I can’t </em>help <em>it, but when they go on about how I’m a freak and my mum was a useless drunk and tell me I don’t get food it’s so hard to control</em>, and partly to discourage Vernon from that course of action. This time Vernon had actually struck on a threat that gave Harry pause. Not that Harry’d let him <em>know</em> that.</p><p>“And thirdly,” Vernon said, face purpling now, “we’ve told her you’re attending St. Brutus’ Home for Incurably Criminal Boys.”</p><p>Under the table, Harry’s fists clenched.</p><p>His magic roiled, searching for a target, even as his face stayed perfectly blank. Harry decided right then it was good he didn’t have a wand on him. He might well have cursed Vernon into an unrecognizable lump of goo.</p><p>“And you expect me to go along with this charade?” he said. “How about I tell Mrs. Sorrel—” the neighborhood gossip— “about our old school’s inquiries into Dudley’s bullying? I know you bribed someone and they swept it under the rug… but I’m sure she’d enjoy getting to tell the PTA mothers Petunia Dursley’s son was nearly expelled for essentially running a juvenile gang…”</p><p>“You’ll say no such thing!” Vernon bellowed, standing up so fast the arms of his chair got stuck on his hips for a second. It clattered to the floor behind him. Harry magically shoved it into the backs of Vernon’s knees so his uncle fell back down into the chair.</p><p>Harry grinned unpleasantly. “I certainly won’t, as long as you sign this form.”</p><p>He held the Hogsmeade permission form, delivered by owl that morning along with his school books, out to Vernon.</p><p>Petunia, who’d been watching the Harry vs Vernon Show with rising horror and fury, snatched the paper. “He’ll do no such thing,” she hissed.</p><p>“Legally, you’re still my testamentary guardians,” he said as lazily as he could manage. “I’d forge your signature but they have ways of magically checking if it’s genuine.” He hid the satisfaction that coiled in his stomach at the horror on her face when he used the M word.</p><p>Petunia folded the form with jerky movements. “We’ll sign it if you’re on your best behavior while Marge is here,” she said icily. Harry decided cold anger must run in his mother’s side of the family. Definitely James had a hot anger and Jules seemed to have inherited it. Thank Merlin Harry took more after his mother.</p><p>The bargain was unpleasant, but he was nearing the edges of the wandless magic he dared use in the summers. Fire and ice were both harder to conjure, and burning anything bigger than a piece of paper was too risky. Moving things and locking and unlocking doors was about as far as Harry was willing to push it. He couldn’t frighten them into signing the form, then. And once the week was up, he’d only have three more days with the Dursleys before Justin and his dad came to get him, and they left for Italy.</p><p>He supposed if nothing else it would be a good exercise in self-control.</p><p>“Agreed,” he said stiffly. “I’ll play along with the school charade and be polite. <em>If</em> you keep her from physically harming or interfering with me in any way, which includes siccing the dog on me.”</p><p>“Fine,” Vernon growled.</p><p>Harry smiled at them. “It’s been such a pleasant family breakfast, as always. Thanks for making my birthday <em>ever</em> so enjoyable.”</p><p>He stalked out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Dressed in his best Muggle clothes, which wasn’t saying much, Harry responded to Aunt Petunia’s screech for him to come down and greet their guest. At least they weren’t trying to make him act like a bloody house-elf anymore. Vernon had tried to order him to clear the table once. Harry wandlessly smashed the remainder of Petunia’s treacle on Vernon’s head and left the table without a word. None of them had tried since.</p><p>“Get the door,” Petunia hissed, shooting him a look full of disgust and fear.</p><p>Harry pasted a pleasant expression on his face and hauled the door open.</p><p>Marge really resembled nothing so much as Vernon’s badly cross-dressing younger brother. Her face was the same red color and she was just as grotesquely large. She even had a mustache, though not as bushy as Vernon’s. “Where’s Dudders?” she roared. “Where’s my neffy-poo?”</p><p>Harry had to choke back a laugh at the sight of Dudley waddling down the hall in his suit with his hair slicked back and a bow tie valiantly supporting his multiple chins. Harry would’ve labeled a photograph of him as “baby walrus stuffed into human clothes and a wig”. Honestly, as he watched them hug, he thought Marge’s hatred and abuse was worth never having to deal with her hugs. Hugs from people he <em>trusted</em> made him cringe. Although Dudley was well-paid for it. Harry saw the crisp twenty-pound note in his cousin’s sweaty hand when he broke away from his aunt.</p><p>Petunia and Marge greeted each other while Vernon came the rest of the way inside, hauling Marge’s second suitcase and glowering at Harry, who just smiled back sweetly.</p><p>“Tea, Marge?” Vernon said jovially. “And what will Ripper take?”</p><p>The bulldog under Marge’s arm twisted around to bare its teeth at Harry. Hidden from Petunia and Vernon by Marge’s bulk, he bared his right back at it and let the damper on his eyes go completely. The dog stopped growing and flinched back.</p><p>Huh. He should’ve tried that years ago.</p><p>Smirking, Harry followed them down the hallway.</p><p>“If you want that permission form, you’ll take these upstairs,” Vernon hissed, shoving both suitcases at Harry.</p><p>Harry almost refused on principle of not letting them order him around, but any excuse to stay away from Marge was welcome, so he just started hauling them up to the guest bedroom without a word.</p><p>By the time he got back down to the kitchen, Ripper was lapping water in the corner, spraying drool everywhere (Harry almost grinned at the pain on Petunia’s face) and Marge was working on her tea and fruitcake.</p><p>“Who’s looking after the other dogs, then?” Vernon said.</p><p>Harry slipped into the kitchen and quietly got a teacup and saucer.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster watching them. He’s retired now, gives him something to do. But I couldn’t leave Ripper, he pines without me,” Marge boomed.</p><p>Ripper whined as Harry sat down, drawing Marge’s attention to him for the first time. “You’re still here, are you?” she said.</p><p>With a great deal of effort, Harry kept himself from sneering <em>obviously</em>. “Yes.”</p><p>“Don’t you say <em>yes</em> with that ungrateful tone,” Marge growled. Harry, who knew his tone had been perfectly neutral, had to fight to keep his expression pleasant. The Gryffindors taunting him as a murderous Heir of Slytherin hadn’t made him lose his temper but his <em>family</em> managed to get under his skin with not even twenty words. Typical. “It’s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself. You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d been dumped on <em>my </em>doorstep.”</p><p>Harry was vividly reminded of what the shade of Tom Riddle had said about an orphanage. It was an unpleasant reminder that he bore some distinct similarities to a Dark Lord, if you were objective about the comparison. Although, frankly, an orphanage would be preferable to living with Marge. He did his best to duck his head and look grateful.</p><p>“Don’t you hide your smirk from me,” Marge boomed. “I can see you haven’t improved a bit. I was hoping school would knock some sense into you.” She drained her teacup and wiped her mustache. “Where is it you send him, again?”</p><p>Harry was sorely tempted to spit out <em>Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry</em> just to see her face, but the prospect of the Dursleys’ rage while he was so restrained held his tongue. Plus there was the Statute of Secrecy to consider.</p><p>“St. Brutus’ Home for Incurably Criminal Boys,” Vernon said. “It’s a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.”</p><p>“I see,” Marge said, glowering at Harry. “Do they use the cane at St. Brutus’, boy?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry said promptly. “All the time, I’ve got some bruises still…”</p><p>“Excellent! But if you can speak about your beatings so casually, it’s clearly not having the proper <em>impact</em>. Vernon, you must write and tell them not to be shy with the cane. Make it clear you approve of the use of extreme force in <em>this</em> one’s case.”</p><p>By this point, Harry was gripping his fork so tightly he thought it might bend, and his fruitcake sat untouched because he was afraid if he opened his mouth he’d insult them all.</p><p>Petunia, perhaps wanting to avert disaster—she’d always been quicker on the uptake than her husband, who was denser than cement—asked Marge about the escaped prisoner. Harry ate his fruitcake and blended into the wallpaper until he could reasonably (and politely, dammit) ask to be excused.</p><p> </p><p>Three days later, he was seriously considering homicide.</p><p>His usual you-stay-out-of-our-way-and-we-leave-you-alone truce with Petunia and Vernon didn’t seem to apply to Marge. She wanted him under her eye <em>all the time</em> so she could watch him. That he stayed on perfect behavior the entire time—face bland, tone polite, hair somewhat neater than it had been last summer—seemed only to enrage her more, as did Ripper’s sudden and out-of-character refusal to be anywhere near Harry. Marge made snippy comments about his clothes, gave Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, lamented that child protection laws kept parents from using <em>appropriate</em> levels of force—Harry was pretty sure this was the excuse Vernon and Petunia used to explain why they’d stopped hitting him or letting Marge hit him—compared him to Dudley while singing Dudley’s praises, and when none of that worked, she turned to comments about him as a person.</p><p>“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” she said darkly over lunch. “You see it all the time with breeding. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pups.”</p><p>Harry’s silverware didn’t falter. His mum—well, he’d never known her, had he? And while he had her to thank for his existence, she’d had the bad sense to marry James Potter, which was not a point in her favor. But he still didn’t like hearing her insulted. James, Marge could go after all she wanted.</p><p>“If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing you can do about it,” Marge finished.</p><p>Her wineglass shattered.</p><p>“Marge!” Petunia squealed. “Marge, are you all right?”</p><p>“Fine, fine, Petunia,” Marge said, mopping herself down with a napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard, I did the same thing at Colonel Fubster’s just the other week. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip…”</p><p>Petunia and Vernon were both looking at Harry suspiciously. He decided he’d better skip dessert and go to his room.</p><p>In the hall, he leaned his head on the wall. <em>Can’t lose control. Can’t get in trouble. </em></p><p>He was not <em>rotten</em>. He was not <em>sick.</em> He was a <em>wizard</em> and magic was the <em>opposite</em> of being rotten. How <em>dare</em> she—</p><p>Breathing hard, Harry stalked upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>After that, he combined Occlumency with reciting lists of potions ingredients. He tried hexes the first day—he’d been paging through the book from Theo—but that only left him wanting to try a few of them on the Dursleys. Marge chalked his blank look up to him being “mentally retarded” (his hand went for a wand he wasn’t carrying at that point) and laughed at him.</p><p><em>Finally</em>, the last day of her stay arrived. Harry kept his head down and his mouth shut. Vernon bored them all by talking the entire way through their dinner about his drill company, Grunnings, and then Petunia brought out coffee and Vernon the brandy.</p><p>“Can I tempt you, Marge?” he said.</p><p>Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was even more flushed than usual. “Just a smide,” she said. Vernon poured, paused. “A bit more than that… a bit more… that’s the ticket.”</p><p>
  <em>And you mocked my parents for supposedly being alcoholics…</em>
</p><p>Dudley was on his fourth piece of pie. Petunia daintily sipped coffee and eyed Ripper, curled in the corner, with distaste. Vernon drank brandy a little slower than his sister, but not much. Harry really wanted to disappear to his bedroom. One look at Vernon told him he had to sit it out or risk his stupid form. Honestly, was Hogsmeade even worth this?</p><p>“Excellent nosh, Petunia,” Marge said, pouring more brandy. “It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after…” She burped and patted her stomach. “Pardon me. As I was saying… it’s wonderful how you feed us, I always like to see a healthy-sized boy.” This was accompanied by a wink at Dudley. Harry managed not to roll his eyes. “You’ll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, just like your father… Yes, I’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon—</p><p>“Now this one here…”</p><p>Marge jerked her head at Harry. He lifted his head and stared blankly back at her and very slowly let a bit of the unnatural green seep back into his eyes. The wandless magic that dulled their color was a constant and nearly unnoticeable reflex after years of using it. Without the damper, his eyes didn’t exactly <em>glow</em>—and most people wouldn’t even be able to peg what it was about him was so unnerving. But there was <em>something</em>. He knew this from experience.</p><p>Marge scowled at him. “This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that one with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.”</p><p>Harry took steadying breaths. <em>Powdered spine of lionfish. A stabilizing agent used in many potions with acidic properties. </em></p><p>“It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. Bad blood will out. Now, I’m saying nothing about your family, Petunia, but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best of families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s the result right in front of us.”</p><p>Honestly, Harry couldn’t even get mad about the <em>wastrel</em> part. As far as he could tell, James clung to the Head Auror position thanks to talented underlings and his son’s fame.</p><p>“This Potter,” Marge said. “What did you say he did for a living?”</p><p>“He didn’t work,” Vernon said, glancing at Harry. “Unemployed.”</p><p>“As I expected!” Marge said, while pouring yet more brandy. Harry raised an eyebrow slightly as she knocked it back. “A no-account, good-for-nothing lazy scrounger who ran about imposing himself on decent folk…”</p><p>Harry ate another bite of pie.</p><p>“Probably a good thing they went and got themselves killed in a car crash,” Marge went on. “Drunk, I expect.”</p><p>“It’s amusing that you mock them for being alcoholics while quite inebriated yourself,” Harry said, and remembered one of Blaise’s comebacks. “Does that much hypocrisy leave an aftertaste or is it covered by the brandy?”</p><p>“Boy!” Vernon snarled. Petunia’s face was white.</p><p>“You nasty little shit!” Marge said, outraged. “Your parents left you to be a burden on your decent hardworking relatives—exactly what we all would’ve expected.”</p><p>When this failed to get a rise out of Harry, she leered at him. “And of course—look at you, no better than they were! Three years at that school Vernon found and you still sit there sullen and ungrateful as you please! Probably can’t comprehend what I’m saying, can you, boy, you’re such a nasty, thick little freak—I’ve heard all about those nasty things you did to Dudders growing up—”</p><p>Harry’s anger had woken at last and it ran cold and heavy through his veins. He dropped the rest of the damper on his eyes and looked at Marge consideringly, not even hearing her words as she kept right on ranting about him.</p><p>Then he let his magic go.</p><p><em>Technically</em>, it was accidental magic. <em>Technically</em>, it was within the bounds of the Statue of Secrecy—at least within the clauses that would keep him from getting expelled, as he didn’t have a wand and memory would prove he’d been provoked. <em>Technically</em>, he hadn’t been trying to do anything specific with his magic.</p><p>But in practice—well. In practice, he was thinking of a certain curse he’d seen.</p><p>Marge stopped midsentence.</p><p>Her little eyes started to bug out. She seemed to be swelling with anger, but the swelling didn’t stop. Fury turned to fear and then panic in her expression and Harry drank it all in without moving an inch. Her face stretched, her eyes bulged, her mouth grew too wide for speech—then several buttons popped loose from her tweed jacket and rebounded off the walls—she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, fingers turning into salamis, stomach tearing the seams of her slacks—</p><p>The ice had taken over nearly Harry’s entire body now. He didn’t feel anything other than cold rage.</p><p>Her body began to rise off the chair. He raised one eyebrow. That was unexpected. Seemed his magic had actually gone off on its own a bit.</p><p>“MARGE!” Vernon and Petunia screamed, lunging for her—they were too slow. Marge bumped into the ceiling and shrieked again as she bounced slightly. Harry leaned back in his seat. Vernon grabbed her ankle and tried to drag her down again; he was lifted clean off the floor himself.</p><p>Petunia turned on Harry with fury and terror in her eyes.</p><p>With precise movements, he ate the last three bites of his pie while Vernon tried to drag Marge down from the ceiling. Then Harry looked up, smiled politely at Petunia, and walked out of the room.</p><p> He made it upstairs before the first bellow of <em>“BOY!”</em></p><p><em>“What’s going on?” </em>Eriss demanded, popping out from her preferred hiding place near the radiator. “<em>I felt your magic.”</em></p><p><em>“We’re leaving,” </em>Harry said grimly. <em>“I’ve had enough of this place.</em>” He started throwing his things in his trunk.</p><p>
  <em>“Finally.”</em>
</p><p>Harry looked at her, still jamming things into his trunk. He could organize them later.</p><p>
  <em>“What? They’re not nice to you. I don’t like seeing you unhappy. Can I bite any of them before we go?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, I’m in enough trouble as it is without one of them dying. Besides, they’d probably taste nasty.”</em>
</p><p><em>“I don’t have to </em>lick<em> them, I don’t taste things with my fangs.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“But you’d have a bit of them in your mouth.”</em>
</p><p>Eriss considered this. <em>“True. Okay, no biting. Did you magic them, at least?”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I blew up Marge.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh good.”</em>
</p><p>Harry found himself smiling, impossibly, as she wound up his arm and curled around his waist beneath Dudley’s saggy clothes. She liked riding there, he’d found, and often went with him on his walks or trips to the bookstore, hiding warm and close to his skin.</p><p>Harry checked around his room and then in his trunk one last time.</p><p>His holly wand sat in his holster, on top of the Slytherin team Nimbus 2001 and his broom-cleaning kit.</p><p>It didn’t even take a second to make the decision. Harry pulled out the holster and held it to his arm; the straps did themselves and the sensation of it magically faded away.</p><p>He slammed the trunk closed, shrunk it, put it in his gray pack, threw the pack over his shoulder, and shoved the door open. </p><p>Vernon stood at the top of the stairs, trouser leg in tatters. Ripper, probably. “BOY! GET BACK DOWN THERE AND PUT HER RIGHT!”</p><p>
  <em>“I changed my mind, I still want to bite him.” </em>
</p><p>“She got what she deserved,” Harry said, laying a hand over Eriss’ head through his shirt. “If you’re smart, you’ll get out of my way.”</p><p>“YOU WILL NOT ORDER ME ABOUT IN MY OWN HOME!”</p><p>Petunia appeared, face white with rage. “How <em>dare</em> you,” she hissed. “Working your—your <em>freakishness</em> in our <em>normal</em> house—you’ve contaminated this entire place after we took you in, gave you a <em>home</em>—”</p><p>“This is not my home,” Harry said. He was never coming back here. Never. He shouldn’t have had to come back in the first place, he didn’t give a <em>damn</em> about the wards—as if this was any better than the centuries-old wards around Potter Manor anyway. “This has <em>never</em> been my home. You’ve made sure of that since I was one year old. Now for the last time, <em>get out of my way.”</em></p><p>Vernon took a threatening step forward, face purple.</p><p>With a <em>bang</em>, he hurtled backwards, tipped over the railing, and fell to the front hall. He landed with a thud and a groan.</p><p>Eriss hissed a laugh too quiet for anyone but Harry to hear.</p><p>Dudley let out a squealing scream from somewhere downstairs.</p><p>Harry walked forward.</p><p>Petunia took a trembling step to one side. She seemed speechless.</p><p>Harry went down the stairs. He paused by the front door. Vernon was moving; his massive body seemed to have cushioned him somewhat, at least from a head injury. He was conscious enough to let out a bellow of pain. Anyone who could yell that loudly didn’t have a punctured lung, so Harry put it out of his mind, opened the door, and left Privet Drive for the last time.</p><p>If he had to, he’d hop a broom to Italy next summer and hole up in Blaise’s house for three months.</p><p>He was not coming back.</p>
