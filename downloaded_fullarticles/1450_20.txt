    <p>Sirius Black pulled at the torn edges of his thick grey coat, wrapping them tightly around his torso and glancing warily at the sky and the moon that hung there. He rushed through the deserted cobblestone streets of Diagon Alley and turned onto the bustling chaos of Knockturn Alley. In the depth of night, the shady street transformed into a hub of illegal activities, steeped in dark magic and carried out by the worst wizards and witches you could imagine.</p><p>The fact that Sirius found himself here more often than not caused an uneasy knot of anxiety to form in his stomach, he’d spent nine years trying to detach himself from the Black family dynasty and its unhealthy obsession with the dark arts. It seemed, however, their interest in darkness did not extend to that of dark creatures.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>“They’re filthy, disgusting half-breeds, the lot of them” Walburga Black had spat across the dining table one evening, seemingly unprompted, “why on earth the Dark Lord insists on keeping<span class="apple-converted-space">mongrel </span>werewolves for company eludes me” her lip curled in disgust as she took a sip of wine from her goblet “blood as corrupted as those filthy mudbloods, if you ask me”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius had ignored his mother’s rant, biting back his remark that when it came down to it, no one really had asked her, and obediently ate his meal. Orion Black had merely murmured an agreement before returning his gaze to the parchment before him, deeply engrossed in the workings of the ministry and the laws he was trying to pass, aimed at preventing those without pure blood from being taught magic.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Keeping his gaze focused on the ground, Sirius tried not to catch the eye of anyone else wondering through the street, it would do no good to start a fight, not in his state, and certainly not so close to the -</p><p>“Excuse me”</p><p>Sirius looked up from the dusty cobblestones, thankful that the voice that had spoken was not one he recognised. Before him stood a tall, slim man, mousy brown hair appearing grey in the moonlight. He tried to ignore the way his attention was drawn to the sharp jawline and soft waves of hair that fell across his forehead and answered the man with a harsh grunt in way of response.</p><p>“It’s just, I’m looking for a shop you see, quite new to the area and I don’t really know my way around, could you point me in the right direction?”</p><p>The man’s voice was deep, and he had an accent Sirius couldn’t quite place - welsh perhaps? He toyed with the idea of helping the handsome stranger find his way; he didn’t seem like the Dark Arts type, but Sirius took a moment to glance over the man’s shoulder and realised no one looking for something in Knockturn Alley was up to any good. Whilst he seemed friendly, Sirius couldn’t get pulled in by a pretty face, not when they were frequenting one of the darkest areas of London. He sneered at the man, hoping to draw on his aristocratic upbringing and the good looks he was just barely holding on to in order to create an imposing figure. The worn clothes and unkempt stubble across his jaw did little to aid in the air of indignation he was trying to give off.</p><p>“Piss off,” he finally grumbled, pushing his way past the shocked man and trying again to avoid eye contact, he picked up his pace, keeping his sight set on the faded blue door up ahead that he knew held his destination, and his lifeline.  </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>Exactly nine days after his fourteenth birthday, Sirius Black had broken the rules. This wasn’t unusual and for the most part practically harmless, but that night as he snuck down the staircase of Grimmauld Place, what waited below was not the usual meeting of ministry officials and pureblood aristocracy, but a whole lot more sinister gathering.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The grating voice of his mother could be heard from the dining room, but after a sharp slap of skin hitting skin, Walburga Black remained silent. Tonight, the Black’s dining room held host to a meeting called by the wizard known as the Dark Lord. If his mother’s shrill words were any indication, he’d bought along some of his werewolf allies to the meeting, and she was evidently not happy at having her home soiled by the likes of their kind. In retrospect Sirius has often thought to himself, if he had not wandered so far down the staircase, if he’d remembered that the eleventh step always moaned in protest when someone stepped upon it, maybe the events that followed could have been avoided.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The bell chimed as he pushed open the door and a pungent smell filled his too-sensitive nose. His eyes adjusted to the dim lighting that frequented most of the shops lining this particular street and he picked his way through the disorganised chaos of the shop floor. Once he reached the dusty counter, Alastair waved him towards the curtained separation at the back wall, barely paying attention to his only customer and tinkering idly with a stout cauldron emitting purple smoke. Pushing aside the heavy curtain, he found himself in a familiar corridor, panelled in dark, heavy wood and lined with doors of a similar nature, he chose the first door to his left and entered.</p><p>The low ceiling of the room created a claustrophobic atmosphere, only furthered by the cramped shelves hosting a variety of jars filled with gruesome ingredients and the hazy mist of fumes radiating from the cauldron hanging inside the lit fireplace.</p><p>“Ah yes, Sirius, right on time as usual. Only the one dose again?” A frail man perched atop a three-legged stool sat attentively regarding the boiling cauldron; he didn’t look up from the fireplace but greeted Sirius as he often did.</p><p>“That’s the one” his response was short and tinged with a frantic energy, being in this part of London put him on edge, and the sooner he was gone from here the calmer he would be, he couldn’t risk losing control.</p><p>“You know, Sirius” the man said rising from his place and slowly walking to one of the many shelves, “You could always take a few batches and reorder when the time calls for it, I certainly have a few in stock” He turned to gaze at Sirius’ tattered robes “I could set you up for about three months” his long shaking fingers reached out to extract a small shimmering silver potion from amongst the bottles. With a furrowed brow he regarded the potion maker bitterly.</p><p>“You know I don’t have the money to do that.” It didn’t escape Sirius when the man’s lip curled slightly in a smirk. Many people relished in the fall of a Black, a reluctant one or not.</p><p>“Ahh yes, very well, here you go then,” he handed over the potion, reaching out another hand palm up “4 Galleons.” Sirius grimaced while exchanging the dirtied pouch, heavy with the sickles he had gathered to pay for the small vial and avoided looking at the old man, turning to leave once he’d gotten what he’d come to find.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>“Well, what’ve we got here?” A heavy, dirty hand grasped at Sirius’s shoulder, long nails crusted with mud dug into his flesh as he struggled to move away, but the other hand came down like a vice across Sirius’ face, covering his mouth and pressing tight.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Young master Black want’s listen in on the Dark Lord’s plans? You’ve got a nerve. Everyone knows you’re on the way to becoming a blood traitor, just like those muggle-loving Potter scum” the voice in his ear was gravely and harsh, the laboured exhale of words pushing warm wet air across his face, it smelt like rotting meat and damp.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh,” he took a deep breath, “but you do smell nice, don’t you?” Sirius struggled angrily, aiming to step on the feet behind him or to elbow the man wherever he could reach, all efforts were fruitless however and only seemed to further the man’s enjoyment of his power over the Black heir.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You know, I really don’t think they’d miss you, I think I’ll be doing them a favour…They always liked the other one better, Regulus isn’t it?” he paused to laugh and moved his head closer to Sirius’ face.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m sure he’d happily take your place, that way everyone gets what they really want.” Sirius began to struggle more violently, a sarcastic remark ready to be thrown at the man who dared speak to him like that, but the fingers tightened, and the man’s jaw stretched into a wide grin before opening.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>As he moved to push aside the heavy curtain separating the dark hallway from the shop floor Sirius paused. Voices could be heard; one was most certainly Alastair’s and the other he recognised as the man who’d asked him for directions not moments before, his accent couldn’t be too common around these parts.</p><p>Anxiety overrode sense and a whirlwind of thoughts clouded Sirius’s view. Was he being followed? There were too many options for culprits… Voldemort, the Black’s, Malfoys, even the Ministry. None meant anything pleasant for him in the future. He struggled to control his breathing, fingers curling into a fist and nails biting into the soft flesh of his palm. He leaned in to listen more carefully, heart beating fast.</p><p>“And you’re sure?” the stranger asked, voice careful, calculating.</p><p>“Mr Lupin, even if I were to know anything about which you ask, there’s a certain element of discretion one must uphold within this area of business.”</p><p>“Customer confidentiality?” he barked a laugh “I may be new here but I’m not naïve, this area of London is certainly not one with any type of moral compass, you’re not beneath selling your customers out I’m sure, you’re looking for the right price, aren’t you?” Sirius heard the soft jingle of coins as they were taken from the man’s pocket and placed on the wooden countertop. The reply from the shop owner was more wistful now, a hint of regret evident in his voice.</p><p>“No. We do not give away our customers information, Sir.” A sigh, “take your bribes and leave – “</p><p>“They’re here, aren’t they?” a pause followed Lupin’s shocked words.</p><p>Alastair’s response was a soft croak, “What?”</p><p>“The only reason you would have for refusing this gold is if you could lose more by taking it. You’d certainly lose out if the werewolf you’re hiding knew who’d sold him out, and how might he know, unless he’s here?”</p><p>There was a sharp intake of breath Sirius realised had come from his own mouth. Who was this man – Lupin – working for? He tried to recall what he’d looked like, only being able to bring to mind the softness of his hair and curve of his lips, he couldn’t distinguish who had sent him from that alone.</p><p>Choosing to ignore the rest of the conversation, not trusting Alastair to successfully divert Lupin’s attention, he looked to plan his escape.</p><p>Many doors left off from the panelled corridor behind the curtain, he knew some contained more brewing stations, more were store rooms lined with ingredients, others stock rooms stacked high with boxes of glass vials and cauldrons. The last door to the right however, led to the flat above the shop where old Alistair lived. The pain in his shoulder pulsed as he hurried forward, breath laboured, with only one thought in mind. <em>Escape.</em></p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>He didn’t really remember any pain, not physically anyway. After being found in the hallway by one of the Dark Lord’s followers, he didn’t remember much else except fear and a scream he embarrassingly thinks might’ve belonged to him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he woke it was to the ceiling of the Black Family dining room. He awkwardly lifted himself up on one elbow and surveyed his surroundings. He’d been placed on one of the many plush velvet sofas’ that lined the walls and his eyes found Walburga and Orion Black standing by the door. His mother looked flustered and most of all disgusted, his father looked as stoic as ever.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What have your animals<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>done<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>to him?” Walburga screeched. “This cannot be happening; the Black family line is<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>pure.” She was growing increasingly louder and more hysterical “You have<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>ruinedus” she finished, raising a clawed finger at the Dark Lord.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Unanimous hissing and cursing arose from the dozen or so people Sirius hadn’t at first noticed, but his eyes were now drawn to the man standing beside him. He recognised him from numerous covers of the Daily Prophet, he was handsome and tall, cloaked in a green robe so dark it was almost black, and he was looking down, right at Sirius.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Noticing he was awake, the Dark Lord ignored Walburga’s hysterics and knelt next to the weak teenage boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Sirius” his voice was quiet and compelling. “You have been gifted by one of my most trusted followers, he believed that with this gift you will be a<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>great<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>asset in the upcoming revolution.” The Dark Lord smiled at him, but he knew it wasn’t sincere, nothing about this man was, his good looks, his charm, none of it was sincere, it was a mask he paraded to win admirers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You will join me, won’t you Sirius.” He paused, looking up towards Walburga “I do not believe your mother will be so accepting of your new gift, you may not be safe here,” he looked pointedly back at Sirius, letting him follow his gaze back to his mother, and saw only the truth reflected in the blazing anger on her face.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“But you can come with me child, I can look after you, you only have to help me.” Sirius took a moment to reach for his shoulder and the source of his pain, pulling his hand away he gazed, almost numbly, at the sticky red blood coating his palm. Without looking up, and without thinking, he nodded.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He ran, pulling out his wand and unlocking the door to his right only a moment before he heard the whoosh of the curtain behind him being yanked back.</p><p>“Stop!” the man’s shout didn’t register with Sirius as he thundered up the staircase, he scrambled through the rooms looking for an exit. He could hear the footsteps behind him, but he was faster and better adept at escaping than his pursuer was at chasing it seemed. Finding a slightly parted window on the second floor he flung it open, the force snapped the frail hinges and the glass pane fell to the street below. He could see the bustling alley, a sea of dark cloaks, concealing identities and illegal purchases.</p><p>Not for the first time Sirius thanked the layout of Knockturn Alley and its narrow streets and pushed himself from the windowsill and onto the tiled roof of the building opposite. He didn’t waste any time wondering why no spells had been fired from behind him, and only proceeded to run as fast as he could, clutching at the small vial still in his hands and praying to Merlin that whoever was looking for him didn’t want to catch him too badly.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Remus Lupin stood breathing heavily and bathed in the moonlight from the open window. Or, he amended, the broken window. Before he could catch sight of where the man was headed, he was tugged back violently by the back of his shirt collar.</p><p>“Get out of my shop.” The man behind the counter had followed him and began to push him towards the door leading downstairs, he made no attempt to argue with him. Really, he chided himself, losing his control like that and charging through someone’s house was highly unprofessional. He began to apologise but the man only grunted, marching him through the shop and pushed him once more towards the front door,</p><p>“I’m keeping this money” he said holding up the bag of gold Remus had previously offered him “for the window upstairs.” Remus began to argue that one quick <em>reparo </em>would have that fixed almost instantly but decided against it after man withdrew his wand and raised it, a curse on his lips.</p><p>He returned to the Leaky Cauldron feeling defeated and worn out. As he’d chased the man, he’d caught sight of his face in profile and realised he’d been speaking to him only minutes before in the street. He sighed heavily, thinking that it<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>was </em>just his luck to speak to the very werewolf he was looking for before he knew who he actually was. He decided to resign to his room to continue his train of thought, nights when he was on the trail of a big mission were never ones that involved sleep. The cogs in his mind turned endlessly, sleep escaped him like clockwork and until his job was complete, Remus knew his mind wouldn’t shut down. Tomorrow, he thought, he’d visit an old friend living in the area and see if they’d heard anything about the werewolf roaming around West London recently.</p><p>Whilst the soft light from the burning oil lamp was comforting, this generic room was no match for the comfort of his own home. Remus would give anything to be back in his own room at Godric’s Hollow, living only a few doors away from his childhood friends. Jobs such as this kept him away from home far too often, and despite dreaming of a career in journalism since his Hogwarts days, it so far wasn’t living up to the expectations he’d created.</p><p>With a wave of his wand, his bag, settled in the corner of the room, lifted itself off the floor and floated towards him; once stationed at his desk he opened it up and pulled out the newest edition of the Quibbler. Resentfully he thought that this was actually a publication he could get behind. Straightforward and honest, whilst some turned their nose up at the small publication run by Xenophilius Lovegood, Remus loved the quirky editor and his outrageous stories. Littered between stories about magical creatures Remus had never even heard of, there were clever and well thought out debates and articles regarding the war, the state of politics in the ministry and the relationship between muggles and wizards. The Prophet had their own agenda, and often the stories he was given to work on evaded any mention of the war currently raging around them. He knew there were higher powers than him pulling strings to conjure up the stories he must follow like an obedient pawn, if this time he had his own agenda, why was it any of their business?</p><p>Taking out a fresh sheet of parchment, Remus held the quill between his fingers and dipped it into the inkpot to his right.</p><p>
  <em>Dearest Lily…</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>It was only two days after the incident in the dining hall, the one that had foolishly seen Sirius Black agree to join Voldemort and his Death Eaters. He’d been ordered to remain at the Black residence until further arrangements could be made, and his parents had been informed they must treat the newest member of the revolution with respect, or else face the wrath of the Dark Lord. His mother was eyeing him with distaste from the opposite end of the table, as far as she could possibly get away from her first child. Calling over Kreacher, her most devoted House Elf, she spoke into his paper-thin ear and Sirius watched as the Elf walked the length of the table to deliver a message from his mother.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Mistress demands that you finish eating your dinner before you return to your room Master Black” a loud, and extremely fake cough emanated from Walburga’s direction. “Mutt.” Kreacher corrected with a slight smirk.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Instead of responding to the House Elf, Sirius looked up at his mother and spoke to her directly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I might eat it, if I were able. I can’t eat this,” he stabbed his fork into the raw meat on his plate and held it up, watching the blood drip onto the white china. He cared very little for how much he wanted to rip into it, how the smell of blood flooded his mouth with saliva. He wasn’t giving her the satisfaction of showing off his newly acquired taste for raw meat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You can and you will.” She hissed at him, slapping her palm against the table, “We are not wasting anymore time or money on an animal like you, eat what you have been given or go without.” Without giving him chance to reply she waved a hand and he watched as his plate of food smashed against the wall, blood running down the floral wallpaper and china scattered around the floor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Go.” Were the last words Walburga Black ever spoke to Sirius.</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius returned to the house he shared with the unassuming and slightly dim-witted Peter Pettigrew and headed straight for a shower. The building was slowly falling apart, leaks occurred more and more often, and the crumbling floorboards had taken hostage at least three shoes, all of them from his left foot. Sirius really couldn’t afford to lose anymore shoes; the life of a werewolf didn’t offer much in the way of employment, he’d once believed he’d finish Hogwarts and become and Auror for the ministry. He laughed at himself whilst stripping off his clothes and turning the faucet. He hadn’t even completed his Hogwarts education, leaving before completing his fourth year. He’d spent the last nine years teaching himself all of the necessary spells to stay alive.</p><p>It’s why it was extremely possible that the Ministry of Magic were sending people after him, a Black family heir turned werewolf Death Eater, with a history of underage magic, sneaking about London in the middle of a war. Standing under the stream of water Sirius hung his head letting his shoulder length hair hang forward, exposing the serial number branded at the nape of his neck, and watched the droplets run down and into the water at his feet. Even if he was no longer a Death Eater, there was no future for him. Werewolves’ rights were virtually non-existent, and at this time they were even more untrusted than ever before. He recalled the moment, only four years ago he’d escaped from the Dark Lord’s grasp.</p><p>During a raid on a small out-posting of wizards from the militant group known only to them as the Order, the Death Eater attack had caused enough chaos that Sirius had been able to slip away, unnoticed into the strange city. Finding a secluded alley, Sirius apparated to the only place he knew. London had been his home ever since, moving from room to room and job to job, evading capture on all fronts. He’d been here nearly five months now.</p><p>The small vial of smoking silver potion he’d hastily put in his bedside table would help him keep his humanity the following night, when his bones would break and crack into place, he’d be The Wolf, but he’d also be Sirius.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He stared at the derelict looking building before him, wondering how Pete could be living in such a tiny, run down place. He knew his friends’ job at the Owl-Post Office didn’t pay well, but surely there were better places than this to spend your life. Pushing any judgement aside Remus made his way up the stone steps to the door, dirty white paint chipped and peeling, he knocked on the cleanest area available and waited.</p><p>“Remus!” Peter exclaimed when answering the door, “Why didn’t you send an owl?” he flushed at the accusatory tone, “I don’t mean, not to mean, I… just… come in Remus, it’s lovely to see you” He moved aside to let Remus pass and they shared a quick one armed hug in the doorway,</p><p>“Just passing through really, Pete, wanted to check in and see if you knew anything about any werewolves round these parts”</p><p>“Werewolves?” his eyes widened ever so slightly, fear entering his voice.</p><p>“Yeah, there’s been some stories about one in the area, pretty tame it’s been said, assuming they must be on wolfsbane, I wanted to interview them but they seem pretty hard to get hold of,”</p><p>“Don’t blame ‘em really, not during these times.” Pete grumbled whilst offering Remus a seat in the living room, “want a drink?”</p><p>“Tea if you don’t mind,” as Peter left through a different door Remus raised his voice to be heard “Nearly got a chance last night but I – “ he stopped mid-sentence as the door they’d just entered re-opened, and his runaway werewolf entered.</p><p>“<em>You</em>.” The man growled. “<em>What are you<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></em><em>doing </em><em>here</em>?” he shot over to where Remus was sat and pulled him up by the collar of his coat, pushing him against the nearest wall.</p><p>“How did you find me? Who are you working for?” a wand tip was now pressed firmly against his throat; the werewolf had its teeth bared in a grimace and Remus struggled to gather his thoughts.</p><p>“What the hell is going on in… Sirius, what are you doing?” Remus was quickly dropped from Sirius’ grip, but the wand stayed firmly to his throat.</p><p>“Hello Peter. Good morning. If you could turn around and walk away that would be brilliant for everyone. Next time don’t answer the door.”</p><p>Remus raised his eyebrow at the man in front of him and turned slightly towards Peter.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I can handle this, I know him” he smiled in what he hoped was a reassuring manner.</p><p>“Oh, brilliant, well then, I’ll be... going” without another word needed Peter apparated out of the room.</p><p>“It is honestly mental how he was sorted into Gryffindor y’know?” he laughed, “Remus Lupin, I believe we’ve met” he extended a hand towards the man he now knew as Sirius and waited for a response.</p><p>“Who sent you?” the wand tip pressed harder.</p><p>“The Prophet, I guess?”</p><p>He saw the shock register on his face before his eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“And what would the Prophet want with me?”</p><p>“An expose.” His reply gained a disbelieving look from Sirius, “I wanted to write a story, about how the war was effecting werewolves during this time, I know not every werewolf has to be working for Voldemort, right? I wanted to find one that wasn’t, I wanted to interview you.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“But –“</p><p>“I’m not giving you an interview. I’m not giving anything to the Prophet, especially not some sad story about my life,” he glared at Remus, his face reddening “I don’t want pity, and I wouldn’t get pity. Do you know what kind of attention a werewolf would get from an interview with the Daily Prophet?” Remus shook his head, although he could probably guess. “Death threats,” Sirius continued, “Death threats, and howlers and dungbombs through my letterbox, probably a few cursed letters here and there to liven things up, you can take your grand expose and shove it up a nifflers arse.”</p><p>Desperate not to lose his only chance, Remus tried again, “No, look, it can be anonymous, it doesn’t need to be a sob story at all, just an honest opinion on life as a werewolf. Surely you’d like people to know that not all werewolves are working for Voldemort?”</p><p>“How do you know I’m not?” Sirius growled getting in his face, almost nose to nose.</p><p>Choosing to ignore the fact the werewolf smelt of mint body wash, Remus smiled,</p><p>“All of the werewolves working for Voldemort are known by the Order of the Phoenix. They’re not shy in letting people know who’s side they’re on, they don’t feel like they can be touched. You’ve be sulking around this part of London for months, there have been no werewolf attacks or murders in that time, if you were one of his, there most certainly would have been.”</p><p>Sirius snorted and moved to sit on the yellow paisley sofa, it sunk under his weight as he rested his elbows on his knees, letting his chin fall into his hands.</p><p>“You should go. You probably already know what tonight is, I’m unpredictable at best on these days. I’d like to be left alone” Sirius did not give the impression that he wanted to be alone; he looked lonely, lost and angry.</p><p>“How do you know Peter?” changing tactic Remus sat across from him and leaned in expectantly.</p><p>“I found this place and posted an ad, in the Prophet actually,”</p><p>“Not really my area”</p><p>“Thought not, I was looking for someone to house share with, this place is cheap, as you could guess, but not cheap enough for a werewolf, Peter applied and here we are.”</p><p>“So, what have you been doing these last few months, on full moon nights I mean? Most werewolves on wolfsbane choose to sleep it off, not venture into the city.”</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow at him and shook his head, “I’m not an idiot, Mr. Lupin. I’m only an animal once a month, otherwise I have the general human capacity to know when I’m being played. You can pretend this is a normal conversation all you want but you’re not getting an interview.” Remus swore he continued on to mutter “<em>fucking journalists</em>” under his breath, but he really couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Remus leaned towards Sirius, ignoring the smell of his body wash and ignoring that now that he’d had some time to look at him, he was exceptionally handsome underneath the tattered clothing and unkempt hair. “Sirius, I’m not being completely truthful with you about why I’m here.”</p><p>“Of course you’re not,” he muttered haughtily.</p><p>“I’m here to recruit you.” He felt the air still as the werewolf stopped breathing.</p><p>“For<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>who</em>?” he asked, anger evident in his voice.</p><p>“The Order” and with that, the werewolf before him blinked, wide eyed and sat up fast, almost head-butting Remus in the face, he saw his hand curl around the edge of the sofa.</p><p>“The Order of the Phoenix? That Order?” Sirius seemed slightly breathless now, eyes wide but slightly more alert.</p><p>“The very same,” he smiled warmly, trying to seem inviting.</p><p>“I have a letter, from Dumbledore himself, if you want to - “ he rummaged through his bag to find the crumbled envelope and held it out, it was instantly snatched away as the man ripped open the seal and began to read.</p><p>“Why would the Order want someone like me?”</p><p>“Because you’re not one of them, Voldemort has succeeded in winning over nearly the entirety of the werewolf population in Europe, you’ve managed to escape that, we want to know how and we want you to join us,” he paused, enjoying the look of wonder on Sirius’ face “if you want to?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Lily looked up after reading the short letter that had moments before been unceremoniously dropped into her bowl of cereal by a rather rude tawny owl.</p><p>“James! James, he’s done it” cereal forgotten, her chair scraped nosily against the kitchen tiles as she rushed to get up, her red hair swaying as she moved quickly up the stairs.</p><p>“Who what?” James’ head peaked out from behind the doorframe of Harry’s room and as she entered, she saw her husband struggling to place a tiny maroon sock onto their toddlers waving foot.</p><p>“Remus, he’s found Sirius. He got away, but he’s got a lead, he knows he’s in the right area, he’s found him”</p><p>Joy spread across James’ face and he let out a breathy laugh, “The bastard did it!” he leant his head against Lily’s shoulder letting out another laugh.</p><p>“<em>Bastarrr</em>’” Harry giggled, pudgy feet moving wildly, only one decked out in a garish maroon and gold sock.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius was still wary, but he looked at Remus Lupin and couldn’t help but smile. It might be a set-up, or a hoax but right now a situation sat before him, where he could not only be accepted, but become a member of a community aimed at fighting dark wizards, not becoming one.</p><p>After over an hour of frantic, hopeful questioning, Sirius warmed up to the idea that Remus might be telling him the truth, he may have to wait until he sees Dumbledore for himself before he starts to celebrate, but his excitement was growing.</p><p>“If you’re agreeable then we can begin to set everything up, paperwork, training, and actually get you initiated” Remus told him, “you’ll need to undergo some questioning by Moody, one of our Auror’s, it’s procedure I’m sure you understand, people who we don’t exactly know can’t just be let in on Order knowledge.” Sirius nodded, he did understand, there was just one issue.</p><p>“It will have to wait a few days, you know…”</p><p>“Of course not, it has to be as soon as possible, there’s no time to waste” Remus was on his feet looking decidedly energetic, he faltered though, looking quickly ashamed as he added “actually I’m sorry to say this but I might still need that interview, I do still work for the Prophet, that wasn’t exactly a lie, and you see there is a deadline, I could possibly get fired which would be a nightmare I…”</p><p>“Remus you do realise the full moon is going to rise in under two hours, don’t you? You need to spend a lot less time talking and a lot more time getting away from here.” He stood up too; remembering that if he didn’t take his vial of wolfsbane potion soon its effects may not take hold by the time his transformation occurred. He hurried upstairs leaving Lupin in his sitting room and rummaged in the draw for the bottle.</p><p>
  <em>No.</em>
</p><p>His searching became more frantic for every second he failed to find the vial of potion; he turned his room upside down and checked relentlessly throughout the bathroom. “Lupin,” he called helplessly, “we have a problem.”</p><p>After further searching and explaining that he had most definitely not <em>lost </em>his wolfsbane potion, Sirius gnawed at his bottom lip, missing the way Remus’ eyes were fixated on the movement, before he turned away, his hands clutched anxiously into tight fists. He paced, and in his worry missed the silver-blue wisp emanating from Remus’ wand, followed by hurried murmurs and the wisps sudden disappearance.</p><p>“Sirius look at me,” he placed his hands firmly over Sirius' shoulders, "I have a place, in the countryside. A basement, we can spell. Come with me” his warm chocolate eyes looked imploringly into the pale grey of Sirius’ own, “please.”</p><p>Sirius was beginning to feel weak, like his bones were aching for the change and he only nodded before taking Remus’ hand in order to be apparated alongside him. He found it far less easy to ignore how handsome the man was with panicked wolf instincts raging and their hands intertwined, but he managed, grimacing as his already queasy stomach was wrenched inwards in apparition.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius’ hands burnt his skin with their heat; the moon was already beginning to affect him, more so than usual due to his lack of wolfsbane. Remus slid an arm around the man’s waist and led him up the path to the Potter residence. The door opened before they made it halfway.</p><p>“James"</p><p>Remus could tell that Sirius was hardly paying attention to their surroundings anymore, pains taking hold of his body and sending him into jolting spasms. James had rushed to their side, putting an arm around Sirius, holding him up.</p><p>“I need help getting him to mine, the moon, it’ll be up soon.”</p><p>“Sirius – <em>fucking</em> – Black” James smiled despite the tense situation, the grin threatening to split his face.</p><p>“Don’t call me that” Sirius snarled, trying to sound intimidating, failing when he swayed weakly against Remus. “You tell him, Remus, that that’s not my name anymore.” Sirius turned away from them both to rest a hand against a lemon tree shading the path, breathing heavily. Getting himself under control he turned to Remus and gasped “take me to the basement, <em>now</em>.”</p><p>Apparated once more Sirius couldn’t reign in his nausea as he dropped to his knees on the garden grass. The sky was purple as the remaining pink hues of the sunset bled into deep blue of night. Remus pulled Sirius into his home with the help of James, dragging him down the steep stone steps into his damp basement, Remus conjured link by link a set of silver chains, wrapping them across the other mans wrists.</p><p>“I’m sorry Sirius”, he ran a hand over the werewolf’s forehead, removing droplets of sweat, apologising once more as he backed up towards the door where James was casting defensive and protective charms. James nudged him aside and pulled out a key.</p><p>“We’d better actually lock it” he smirked but it fell as Sirius let out a choked sob and the snap and crack of bones echoed on the stone. Both faces pale, they retreated upstairs, casting more silencing spells across the whole house. As they reached the top step a howl tore through the house and Remus turned quickly to help, mostly out of reflex. A hand pushed against his chest firmly.</p><p>“There’s nothing you can do for him,” James said, sadly, “we just have to wait it out.”</p><p>“I… I know” he replied warily, taking a seat and placing both elbows on the dining table, fingers running through his hair, “it’s hard not to want to help though, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I know. I’m staying with you tonight. Lily and Harry are safe at the cottage, she knows not to come here just yet.”</p><p>“How are they?” He asked, smiling as James became animated, talking about his wife and their small son. After a while though they fell into silence and James stood beginning to make them tea.</p><p>“He doesn’t remember me from Hogwarts, but that’s unsurprising. You though…” Remus frowned, trailing off as he looked at his messy haired friend.</p><p>“I’m willing to chalk it up to the transformation, but if that prick has forgotten about me after four years of friendship, I’m going bat-bogey hex the hell out of him” He laughed but it didn’t reach his eyes as he handed over a steaming mug to Remus.</p><p>“Maybe he wanted to forget, thought I’d forgotten about him, so he forgot about me too”</p><p>Remus put a reassuring hand across James’ arm but said nothing. Remus didn’t know how long the Order had been looking for Sirius. He’d only joined after finishing Hogwarts, but it seems the Order had been looking for him a lot longer than that, he’d been missing for so long.</p><p>“The file Moody gave me, said he was with the Death Eaters for five years, I’d want to block that out too if I were him. I don’t think you’re the problem here mate. You were a kid, we all were, what were we going to do about it? I doubt he expected his schoolmate would up and leave Hogwarts to storm a Death Eater werewolf pack”</p><p>James nodded, running his hands through his already messy hair.</p><p>“I wish we could’ve found him sooner”</p><p>“Yeah, me too.”</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius woke to some of the most excruciating pain he’d felt in years, looking down at his arms he noticed fresh claw marks and could feel the sting of bite marks hidden by bandages. No broken bones though, not anymore, he could feel the ache of where his collarbone had been set back into place. Remus Lupin sat beside his bed and Sirius watched him closely, instead of moonlight, sunlight now shone on his hair, turning it gold, and Sirius noticed freckles across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose; his skin seemed almost translucent, blue-green veins crossing beneath it. This was the man who had chased him down then turned up at his door. The man who had offered him something he’d always dreamed of having. Having Remus following him had turned out quite well for him, so far at least. If this all turned out to be a horrible joke, at least he’d gotten to look at a pretty face for a while.</p><p>“You’re awake” the book Remus had been reading was put aside in favour of leaning towards Sirius, “Seems like you had a rough night,”</p><p>“I’ve had worse, when I was younger it was harder to control.”</p><p>“That must’ve been tough for you, I can’t even begin to imagine it." he made a movement to touch Sirius' hand but thought better of it and placed it on the edge of the bed beside him, "you were fourteen, right?” Sirius nodded, “we were at Hogwarts together, I remember when you didn’t turn up after Christmas break” he reddened slightly “We didn’t know each other though, I was in Ravenclaw”. Remus didn’t say anything else, waiting for Sirius to speak, when he didn’t, he continued.</p><p>“Last night, do you remember where I bought you?” Sirius frowned, wincing as the movement opened a small wound on his forehead.</p><p>“This is your house, isn’t it?” he asked warily.</p><p>“No, before that, I bought you to the Potter’s”</p><p>Sirius tried to sit up, excitement evident across his face “Euphemia and Fleamont Potter? Why – “</p><p>Remus pushed him down gently “Stay, you need to rest. No, James and Lily Potter, do you remember James?”</p><p>Sirius didn’t say anything for a short moment before laughter overtook his body, ignoring the obvious pain he was in, Sirius continued to laugh. After a short, confusing moment James pushed open the door, obviously eavesdropping on the other side.</p><p>“What in Merlin’s name is so funny?” he glared angrily at the man who’d once been his best friend, but Sirius abruptly stopped. He stared up at James in awe for a quick moment before asking, a laugh still in his voice,</p><p>“Did <em>Lily Evans</em> really marry you?”</p><p>“You, bastard!” James tackled him into a hug, momentarily forgetting Sirius had recently undergone an extremely painful werewolf transition. Remus noted how the scruffy man clenched his teeth in pain but said nothing to deter the overexcited James. Remembering himself, James pulled away.</p><p>“I’m sorry, mate. After last night, I thought you’d forgotten who I was, I was ready to hex you into next week for that –“ he pushed nervously at the glasses that had slipped down his nose before smiling “But yeah, finally came around, like I always said she would.”</p><p>Remus recognised this as the best moment to take his leave, letting the two friends catch up on the last nine years. Remus had only known James in the years following Sirius’ disappearance, he’d heard a lot about him though. He wasn’t entirely sure if carefree prankster was a persona that could still be attached to the worn-out, beat up werewolf lying in his bed, but after only two minutes in the presence of James Potter he seemed to have smiled and laughed more than in all the hours Remus had spent with him so far. Maybe all hope wasn't lost. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
