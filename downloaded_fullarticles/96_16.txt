    <p>Geralt almost missed it as he strode quickly through the ruinous old town, heading straight towards the Princess's crypt. He would have missed it altogether if it had not been for the vibration of his witcher's pendant. Amongst the crumbling old town stood a single stone-built house in excellent condition. With window frames painted red or gold, smoke leisurely coming out the chimney and two small, but well-tended gardens of different flowers on either side of the doorstep let him know that other than the striga, there still lived at least one other person in Old Vizima.</p><p>Looking at the house with his pendant still vibrating, Geralt couldn't help but wonder if perhaps he'd been wrong about who had cast the curse on the unborn Princess. Whoever lived within the house obviously was able to wield magic, and had clearly lived in the centre of the striga's territory for an extended period. Maybe the one who cast the curse lived within the house and stayed to ensure that the curse remained unbroken.</p><p>Unsheathing his steel sword, he walked towards the house and pounded heavily on the thick wooden door.</p><p>"Just a minute," called a young male voice, "I'm in the back garden."</p><p>Once again, Geralt found himself a little discombobulated from the casual response. Usually, when he knocked on a door in such a threatening way, he had to chase after whoever was inside when they run out the back door. The sound of footsteps reassured him that this would not be a repeat of his previous experience.</p><p>With a click of the lock turning, the wooden door swung open to reveal a short gangly teenager, with black hair and thick glasses covering emerald green eyes staring up at him.</p><p>"Ah yes, how can I help you?" the teenager asked nonchalantly while wiping dirt off of his hands with a wet rag, paying no notice to the long steel sword in Geralt's hand.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Geralt asked demandingly, his low growl in covering the confusion in his voice.</p><p>"Presently? Well, I'm currently pulling the weeds out of my pumpkin patch to prevent them stealing the nutrients my growing pumpkins needs. Why?"</p><p>"You are living in the centre of a striga's territory, and you aren't dead. Very convenient location if you want to maintain the curse over her." Geralt blatantly accused the younger man, getting ready to move at the slightest provocation.</p><p>"A striga?! So that is what she is!," the strange kid exclaimed with a hint of frustration, "I've been trying to figure that out for ages."</p><p>Without saying a word, he spun around and walked into the next room with Geralt quickly following behind.</p><p>"For the past year, I've been trying to confirm what type of species she is. A striga never crossed my mind," he exclaimed as he picked up a thick book of bound paper and began to scribble in it with an ink pen, "would have never of thought of a striga."</p><p>Geralt examined the stranger before him and knew that this wasn't the person guilty of casting the curse. He was obviously too insane.</p><p>"Why has she not killed you yet?" he asked curiously while sheathing his sword.</p><p>"Oh, she dearly wanted to at the start. Spent most the night howling at my door trying to come in and rip me to pieces," the stranger fondly recalled as he finished writing in his little book before placing it back on a beautiful ornate desk. "Over time, she started getting used to my presence. She just visits now and again to huff at me. I think it annoys her that I'm not scared of her."</p><p>"You didn't answer the question."</p><p>"Oh, sorry. What was the question again?"</p><p>"How are you still alive? The striga kills everyone else who enters the village on a full moon."</p><p>"Ah, yes. Well, I think she is scared of me. She hisses every time she sees me unexpectedly before running away."</p><p>Geralt was speechless; it was a novel feeling for a man who had never been so before.</p><p>"So, are you here to try and kill the striga as well? I recommend against it. No-one has gotten so much as a scratch on her before."</p><p>"Have many tried?"</p><p>"A couple a year will give it a go. Usually wake me up with their screams before she finishes with them."</p><p>"You don't try to help them?"</p><p>"Nah, I don't do that anymore. Trying to save people from themselves gets tiring after a while. If people want to walk into a town where a man-eating beast lives on the one night she is out; then they deserve what they get."</p><p>Geralt suddenly felt a little bit warmer towards this strange kid.</p><p>"Oh, forgive my rudeness. I'm Harry Potter. A pleasure to meet you..."</p><p>"Geralt. Geralt of Rivia."</p><p>And that was how Geralt of Rivia, the renowned witcher, met Harry Potter, a strange and unknown teenager. It was a meeting that caused a number of people no small amount of pain.</p>
