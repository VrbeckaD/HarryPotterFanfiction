    <p>Traditions, he would argue, are dubious little things. Ready for bending, evading and repurposing whenever the need for it intertwines with the opportunity to get away scot-free. Traditions are amendable, some are even unnecessary.</p><p>Not this one.</p><p>Rodolphus doesn’t care if the whole goddamn world is ending: <strong>on Wednesdays, they have dinner.</strong></p><p>The entire past week he has continued his suddenly uneventful existence. Projects and essays a welcome - albeit boring - distraction from all the murdered mudblood murmur. Slightly more silent days came as unappreciated, but peace nonetheless.</p><p>And as he walked through the halls with Lucius a step further away than he usually stood; as he sat in the library only to look up from the book and see Lucius snap his own shut, storming away without saying a word; as he downed potion after potion alone because Lucius refused to participate in activities ‘wasteful and irresponsible’…</p><p>Rodolphus’s life still felt the same, but<em> a little bit to the left.</em></p><p>Delicate fingers find their way onto a hangar, twisting it to the side for coldly inquiring eyes to scrutinize, then move yet another shirt along the rail in dismissal. <em>Not good enough</em>. Their usual cashmere sweater routine - wearing things as trashy as they could find in their closet and getting messy in the kitchen only to give up and let the elves cook - is abandoned in an act of defiance.</p><p>The pristine suit laid out on his bed - slit pockets, tightly fitted slacks, a trim waist in the jacket - is a silent<strong> fuck you</strong> in retort for the entire week. The dinner is happening, but hell if I’m throwing flour in fits of giggles and pretending everything is the same.</p><p>Except on some level, Rodolphus wants to. <em>Of </em>course he fucking wants to. But instead, he picks up one of his favourite custom-tailored burgundy shirts, and moves away from the closet. The whiffs of their shared cologne - same brand, same series, different odours each complementing the other - tangle together as his and Lucius’s shoulders brush past.</p><p>The rotation of the earth stills.</p><p>And they go on without as much as an acknowledging look. Rodolphus nearly opens his mouth in an impulse to spit out something acidic, but bites the insides of his cheeks in an act of self-restraint. He wonders when the tender flesh will finally start to bleed under the weight of all the venomous, unspoken words.</p><p>They say patience is a minor form of despair, disguised as a virtue.</p><p><em>Perhaps that applies,</em> Rodolphus thinks, inner voice dry and unimpressed as it ricochets off the walls in his own head. Lucius not ditching this dinner is maybe the only thing that solidifies the horribly shaky ground under his feet.</p><p>Is he being paranoid? May be so.</p><p>But he knows - knew for many years now, confusing years of existing alongside his father - that some arguments and misunderstandings don’t go away no matter how hard he wishes for it. No matter how pretty he makes himself look. No matter how many scolding comments he ignores; no matter how many things he’s willing to do to calm the anger in the eyes of someone he finds important.</p><p>Yet as he tightens the knot on his tie and exits the room, he <strong>hopes.</strong></p><p>
