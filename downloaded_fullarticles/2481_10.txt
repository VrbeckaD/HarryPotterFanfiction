    <p>He is dead.</p><p>
  <span>This isn’t as uncomfortable a revelation as he thought it would be. Perhaps for someone else, but for him, it came more of a relief to know that he finally died.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he isn’t depressed. Nor is he suicidal, even if he has every reason to be. After all, having an abusive childhood and being at the top of an insane Dark Lord’s hit list does do considerable damage to one’s psyche.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is just...tired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bone chillingly tired. Tired of running, tired of fighting, tired of </span>
  <em>
    <span>trying so hard to not burn what bridges he had left.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that’s all over now. He’s dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord is also dead, he made sure of that, saw the terrible flash of unnatural green hit the disfigured serpentine form of what used to be a man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The same flash of green hit him as well, seconds after the Dark Lord perished. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They say that one has to have the intent to kill behind the casting of the Killing Curse, he didn’t understand, still doesn’t quite understand. But he did know that when he cast it, there was only the tiredness and the all consuming desire for everything to just end.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death is the end of all things, no?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps that is why it worked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t think of himself as one who’d commit murder...but that was what he did, wasn’t it? Even in his first year...Professor Quirrell, that was his fault. The man died because of him. Although, it was Voldemort’s fault too...just like the final battle. He killed someone again, and it was also the Dark Lord’s fault.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Funny how the Dark Lord is partially responsible for his own demise, especially with how the man flinched away from the all-pervasive pull of Death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except…none of that matters now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death is the termination of all things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’ll get to see his family again, the thought rouses a few sparks of happiness and contentment, though they fade soon after to confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Where is his family? His friends? The ones that perished with him at the Battle of Hogwarts?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why doesn’t he see anything?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is no answer to his frantic questions flurrying like freshly disturbed ash. And yet, he already knows why. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>The Stone. The Wand. The Cloak.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>The Three Brothers.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Master of Death.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>How could Death be so cruel, it is supposed to be fair, is it not? Could it not spare its Master the pain of Life?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry could only sigh and close his eyes as Time began to flow in reverse, pulling him along with it in swirling eddies of half formed eternities. It gifts a fully formed one to him, He doesn’t want it, but Time is insistent that he take it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he does, too tired to argue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least now he has the ability to literally sleep forever, though true death may be denied to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The breath is knocked out of his lungs as Time drops him off, colors bursting into existence, banishing away the golden sands as Time nudges him forward in what could pass as a farewell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s hard to tell with the Elder Entities, they do not concern themselves with human customs or behaviors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stands up unsteadily, the few tendrils of golden sand pulling him up with what might be worry, they poke and prod him gently, as if examining him for injuries. Seemingly satisfied, they fade away as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Time has its duties to attend to with Life and Death, it has completed its job of bring Harry to wherever this is supposed to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stands still for a few more moments, pondering over his next choice in actions. The fact that Time was the one to bring him here most likely means that he’s no longer in 1998. He should find out more about where he ended up before coming to conclusions. The startling truth of his new appearance only drives the point further home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s short, unnaturally so for someone seventeen years of age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s more like….seven? There is a flash of gold in the corner of his eye that quickly disappears as the number is supplied to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah, Time seems to be still watching over him...that is unusually charitable of an Elder Entity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head to clear his musings, Harry moves from where he had been placed, taking in the sights around him. Nobody seems to have noticed anything unusual. It figures, from what he can tell, these are all Muggles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Time would not be so sloppy, the Entity is quite particular about paradoxes and disturbances in its flow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How does Harry know all of this?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does not know, perhaps it is a part of being the Master of Death. More thought on the topic puts his unusual calm about the entire situation under the same category.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wonders if Time would be so kind to tell him the date—another flash of gold, barely perceptible:</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>August 6th, 1934.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, that’s a predicament to find himself in, sixty four years in the past with no way to fend for himself. Harry rearranges his previous statement, he is </span>
  <em>
    <span>mostly</span>
  </em>
  <span> helpless, he still has magic. Alright, so having magic basically equates him to not being helpless at all, but still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry has his work cut out for him.</span>
