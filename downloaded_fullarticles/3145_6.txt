    <p>Flashes of memory were all he got, all that pulled him away from the scene in front of him. He heard her first-year voice on the train, before she’d gone and met the people who would become her lifelong friends, saying, “I’m Hermione, Hermione Granger. Aren’t you eager for classes to start?” She had extended her hand to him, and he had responded with, “I’ve never heard of any Grangers.”</p>
<p>He saw chocolate brown eyes widen when he’d called her a mudblood for the first time in second year, clouded with confusion. He knew she didn’t know what the word meant, but she was smart enough to infer from his tone.</p>
<p>He saw the rage coloring her cheeks just before she had hit him in the face third year. No one – male or female – had ever stood up to him that way, and when she turned her back and left him clutching his cheek, his heart had raced.</p>
<p>He saw her coming out of that lake in fourth year, in the arms of Viktor Krum. Her hair was wet and stuck to her face in spots. Her cheeks were pink, and she was shivering. Couldn’t someone get her a bloody blanket? She was going to freeze…</p>
<p>He saw her betrayed face coming out of the Room of Requirement in fifth year, as he did Umbridge’s bidding. How could she manage to look so betrayed when they weren’t even friends? In fact, they were the furthest thing from friends. When he grabbed her arm to lead her to Umbridge, though, he felt the strangest fleeting urge to slide his hand down from her bicep to her own hand, to guide her gently instead of forcibly. Of course he didn’t listen to the urge.</p>
<p>And then, the last time he’d seen her, before today. Sixth year, fleeing the school with Snape. They were all duelling. He didn’t see her anywhere – he didn’t even realize he’d been scanning the area for her – until they were in the entrance hall. She came running up the hallway from the dungeons, breathless, and looked at he and Snape. She trusted Snape, he realized in that moment, because she lowered her wand, eyes fixed on his own gray ones, and nodded, as though giving them permission to go. She didn’t know what they’d left upstairs, didn’t know that Dumbledore was dead, didn’t realize that there were Death Eaters up there waiting for her. He couldn’t explain it to himself, but he had the strangest urge to tell her to run with them. She never would have though.</p>
<p>That’s what had gotten her here. She wouldn’t look out for herself at the expense of others. She was always so bloody noble.</p>
<p>A thin sheen of sweat now covered Draco’s face as he watched her writhing on the ground as his aunt tortured her. He winced every time she screamed. Potter and Weasley were in the cellar, and Granger was up here, very much alone.</p>
<p>Except, of course, for Draco.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what made him do it. It certainly wasn’t a conscious decision. It was as though his body was leading him, acting of its own accord. Wordlessly, he stalked toward Bellatrix, who was so focused on her prey that she didn’t even notice. It all happened in the span of a few seconds, before his father could even get out the words, “Draco, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>In those few seconds, Draco had muttered the spell, and green light had shot out of his wand, causing his aunt to crumple on top of Granger, who whimpered in confusion and pain. Draco reached down, grabbed Granger’s arm, and turned around to the faces of his shocked parents.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Mother,” he said, before turning on the spot and apparating he and Granger away. Malfoys, of course, were the only ones who could apparate in and out of Malfoy Manor, owing to the blood wards.</p>
<p>When his feet hit the ground in the Forest of Dean, the reality of what he had done washed over him. Granger was crumpled at his feet, much as she had been at the Manor, and Draco began hyperventilating, his breathing coming in ragged pants. He sat down on the ground next to Granger, who was sobbing, and put his face in his hands. Tears fell unbidden from his eyes.</p>
<p>He had left his parents. He had betrayed the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>He was dead.</p>
<p>“Malfoy?” Granger whimpered hoarsely.</p>
<p>He removed his hands from his face and looked over at her. She was pale, deathly pale, and trembling. Her hand was covering her left forearm, and blood was running beneath it. Deciding he needed to see how bad the damage was there, he reached for her hand to move it away from her wound. When he saw what the wound was – what Bellatrix had decided to carve into his schoolmate’s flesh – his eyes glassed over with tears once again.</p>
<p>He’d called her that word, hadn’t he? Time and time again. But seeing it carved into her soft skin…it was too much. He closed his eyes, his hand still resting against her hand that he had removed from her own forearm.</p>
<p>What could he do for her? How could he take care of someone freshly tortured?</p>
<p>He thought bitterly, <em>Potter would know what to do.</em></p>
<p>His eyes snapped open. Of course. He needed Potter, and, he supposed by extension, Weasley.</p>
<p>“Bibsey?” he asked, seemingly into the abyss. Granger must have passed out because she didn’t even ask him what he was doing.</p>
<p>A loud crack. A house elf in a neat white toga appeared.</p>
<p>“Master called?” Bibsey asked.</p>
<p>Draco tried hard to keep his voice even, to keep his breathing calm. At least he had a plan now, that was something. He didn’t know where this plan would lead him, but it had to be better than crying on the floor of a forest he’d traveled to with his father as a child.</p>
<p>“Bibsey, please go into the cellar at Malfoy Manor and apparate Harry Potter and his friend, Weasley, here.” He paused. “Bring the others too. The Wandmaker and the Lovegood girl, and the goblin and Dean Thomas.” If he was going to be a traitor, Draco reckoned, he might as well do it correctly.</p>
<p>Bibsey disapparated and was back within a minute with the first two of the bunch: Ollivander and Luna Lovegood. Before Lovegood could ask some off-kilter question about where they were, Bibsey was gone and back with the goblin and Dean Thomas. Draco had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Of course the hero, Potter, had waited to be the last one taken to safety. Finally, after one more trip, Bibsey arrived with Potter and Weasley.</p>
<p>Weasley immediately launched himself at Granger, taking her hand and saying her name over and over.</p>
<p>“I think she passed out,” Draco said quietly.</p>
<p>“It may be better that way,” Lovegood supplied. “Her body might be avoiding the pain.”</p>
<p>Potter was standing back a bit, glancing between Draco and Granger, mistrust etched on his features. Finally he said, “What are we doing here, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Draco’s stomach dropped. He knew he was going to have to explain himself, but he wasn’t sure how he could. He didn’t even realize what he had been doing until it was already done.</p>
<p>“I camped here with my father as a child,” he said. Potter’s eyebrows rose. “Oh, don’t look so surprised. We don’t always stay in fancy manors. It was one of our fishing trips, actually. This is the Forest of Dean.”</p>
<p>“Forest of Dean?” Weasley asked stupidly.</p>
<p>“That’s what I said,” Draco responded coldly.</p>
<p>“Hermione brought us here a few months ago,” Potter said, cutting over Weasley’s voice. “She had also been here with her parents. Pretty big coincidence, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. “I guess.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy, you know damn well I didn’t mean what are we doing <em>here</em> in the woods. I meant what the hell happened back there? Why did you get us all out? What the hell is going on?” Potter’s cheeks were red with anger.</p>
<p>“I…” Draco began. He didn’t know what to say. He glanced around at everyone. They all had wands in their hands, though not raised. They didn’t trust him, but they weren’t hexing him either. He decided he would do his best to tell the truth. “I was standing there watching my aunt torturing her, listening to her screaming her head off. You heard her. I couldn’t take it. I don’t know what happened, okay? I didn’t plan it. Before I knew what I was doing, I had killed my aunt and apparated Granger out of there.”</p>
<p>“No one could apparate,” Potter said, voice full of suspicion.</p>
<p>“The blood wards only allow Malfoys to apparate,” Draco said. “And…house elves.” He nodded at Bibsey, who was watching the proceedings with wide eyes. “This is Bibsey. She is my personal house elf, bound to me by blood, so before you even ask, she answers only to me, not to my parents, especially now that I’m of age.”</p>
<p>“Okay…” Potter said, still holding his wand. “That explains <em>how</em> you did this, but it sure as hell doesn’t explain <em>why</em> you did it.”</p>
<p>Draco looked directly at him then, meeting his green eyes with his own gray ones. He had no idea how he was keeping his voice level when all he wanted to do was cry out. “I don’t know why I did it,” he said. He glaced over at Granger, who was stirring. Weasley reached out and grabbed her hand, rubbing soothing circles into her skin, and Draco felt a hot swoop in his stomach. Without knowing why, he realized he wanted to be the one to soothe her.</p>
<p><em>It must just be because you are the one that rescued her,</em> he reasoned with himself. Of course. Clearly he just wanted to see his job out.</p>
<p>Potter was watching him watch her. Draco could feel his eyes on him. He glanced back at Potter, who had a peculiar expression on his face, somewhere between confusion and understanding. He kept glancing back at Granger, who had started to cry again.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to get our tent,” Potter said after a moment. He apparated away and was back within a few minutes. With a few waves of his wand, he erected a magical tent. This must be where they’d been living on the run the last few months.</p>
<p>Potter glanced at Draco but seemed to decide there were more pressing matters as he levitated Granger into the tent and lowered her gently onto the bottom bunk. He gingerly covered her with a blanket and tucked her in, whispering, “You need to rest, Hermione. It’s the only thing that will help.”</p>
<p>Draco watched all of this from the mouth of the tent, not feeling like he was allowed to enter. He watched as Potter began magically extending the tent, turning it from what had essentially been a studio flat into a three-bedroom house. Begrudginly, Draco had to admit to himself that he was impressed by the magic.</p>
<p>“Right, Luna, you can share this bunk with Hermione,” he said, gesturing unnecessarily to the bed Granger was lying in.</p>
<p>“Oooh, I’ve always loved a top bunk,” Lovegood said, as she climbed the little ladder to the top and plopped herself down. Draco rolled his eyes. How could she seem cheery at a time like this?</p>
<p>“Mr. Ollivander, you can have this room,” Potter said, pointing to one of the small bedrooms. The white-haired man nodded and headed off, closing the door behind him. “And Griphook, you can have this one.” The goblin grunted and went to his room. Like his neighbor, he also closed the door.</p>
<p>“And Ron and Dean, the three of us can share this room,” Potter said, pointing to a large room at the end of the tent. Without being invited in, Draco walked over to look at the room, his curiosity about the magic getting the better of him. Weasley, Thomas, and Potter were already inside. There were three twin-sized beds in there. The blankets were red and gold, and there were Gryffindor banners on the walls around the beds. It looked like a little dormitory.</p>
<p>Thomas cleared his throat. Draco hadn’t realized that he had been looking at him, but now Potter and Weasley were too. “Er, what about Malfoy?” Thomas asked.</p>
<p>Potter was looking hard at Draco now. Not wanting to appear fearful, Draco lifted his chin up, glancing around at all of them in turn.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Malfoy doesn’t plan on staying with us,” Weasley said, looking at Potter for backup.</p>
<p>“Where else would he go?” Thomas asked. Potter shifted uncomfortably, staring at his feet.</p>
<p>“Harry, think about it,” Weasley said, striding across to Potter and grabbing his arm. “He could just be spying for the Death Eaters. He could go and report on us immediately, tell them where we are.” Weasley released Potter’s arm and listened, waiting for the group’s clear leader to come to a decision</p>
<p>Potter looked up from his feet, studying Draco again. Draco’s stomach turned over, wondering where in the hell he would go if Potter told him he had to leave.</p>
<p>“He killed his aunt, Ron,” Potter said finally, with a sigh. “One of V—er,” he paused, clearly remembering the Taboo that had gotten them into this mess in the first place. “One of You-Know-Who’s top servants. I don’t think there is really any coming back from that.”</p>
<p>Draco nearly sighed with relief, but he held it in. He still hadn’t been invited to stay.</p>
<p>“Okay, but that doesn’t mean he’s on our side, and it doesn’t make him our problem,” Weasley argued.</p>
<p>“No, not necessarily,” Potter agreed. Draco furrowed his brow. “Malfoy, do you want to stay?” Potter asked him finally.</p>
<p>Draco paused and then said, “Thomas is right. I’m not sure where else I would go,” Draco answered honestly. “The Dark Lord is going to hunt me to the ends of the earth once he hears what I have done.”</p>
<p>“He’s already heard,” Potter said, almost casually.</p>
<p>Draco’s brow came together once more. “How do you know that?”</p>
<p>Potter hesitated, clearly wondering if he should share the information, but he apparently decided Draco was stuck enough that he could. “I get flashes of his mind sometimes, especially when he is particularly angry.”</p>
<p>Draco winced. The Dark Lord was very angry then. Of course he would be. Draco was willing to bet Bellatrix had been his most loyal follower, and Draco had not only killed her but also deserted him and helped his arch nemesis escape.</p>
<p>“Malfoy stays,” Potter said suddenly. “There is no way he will survive otherwise.”</p>
<p>Weasley looked like he was going to put up a fight, and Potter continued, “Leave it, Ron. He saved Hermione. That’s something, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Weasley’s face was red as he looked at Draco then. After what appeared to be some sort of internal struggle, Weasley gruffly said, “Thank you, for Hermione.”</p>
<p>Potter waved his wand, and wordlessly, a fourth bed appeared, but this one had green and silver blankets, and the hangings on the wall around it were for Slytherin. Potter sat down on the bed closest to Draco’s apparently deciding that Weasley couldn’t be trusted in such close proximity to Draco.</p>
<p>Draco looked at Potter, raising an eyebrow at the décor. Potter shrugged. “Everyone deserves to feel at home. Even a Slytherin.”</p>
