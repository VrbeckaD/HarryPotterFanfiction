  <em> The presence of all eighth year students is required in my office at seven thirty pm this evening. Please bring your own parchment and quill. </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em> ~Headmistress McGonagall. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <strong> </strong> </strong>
</p><p>Well if those words didn’t make your stomach drop out your arse then Hermione didn’t know what would. Not that she could actually read the note any longer, her clammy fingerprints having seeped through the obsidian ink, leaving a trail of destruction across the crumpled parchment. <strong> </strong></p><p>Hermione desperately tried to swallow the lump in her throat. There could only be one reason why they would all be called into her office needing quill and parchment. This had something to do with their N.E.W.T exams… but then, surely the seventh years would be involved too? Unless they’re testing them separately. Hemrione had never considered herself a religious person before now, why would she when seeing the wonders and terrors of this world, but she would happily worship any deity she could think of for this not to be happening right now.<strong> </strong></p><p>The only separate meeting they had received with the Headmistress was upon arrival, when given their class schedules (mixed with the seventh years) and told that because the eighth years were now classed as adults they would be granted later curfew, which of course Hermione was thrilled with. Now she could study in the library in blissful peace, a god send considering their exams are fast approaching. ‘<em> Or perhaps starting now!’ </em> They were also granted more Hogsmeade trips, which meant she had been able to see Harry and Ron during term time. Not that they had much free time themselves whilst in auror training, but they managed a couple of trips, which meant more to Hermione than she could express. It’s weird not having them here, although she had become closer to other Gryffindors this year, frequently seek out Neville and Dean’s company. Hermione’s dorm mate Fay Dunbar had also returned, and even Parvati had become easier to talk to since Lavender didn’t come back, and of course there's the firecracker that is Ginny Weasley. <strong><strong> </strong> </strong></p><p>‘<em> Couldn’t escape her if I tried.’ </em></p><p>Things had become much simpler. Easy, almost. This was how it was meant to be- not assisting a supposed mass murderer on the run, being hunted and petrified by literally one of the most terrifying creatures to ever exist, or helping to save her best friend from a self entitled, elitist, slit nosed mad man. Not that there was anything remotely human about Voldemort, ‘fiend’ was probably a more suitable term.<strong>  </strong></p><p>Hermione missed Harry and Ron, truly she did, but day to day life has become <em> so </em> much easier without them at school. Now all she had to concern herself with was her class schedule, oh- and let us not forget about Ginny’s gruelling exercise routine. A few mornings a week Hermione had somehow submitted herself to the sheer joy of burning lungs and wobbly limbs from the redhead’s various running routes around the castle grounds. Although the physical activity seemed punishing, there was something freeing about having a clear head. Every mind boggling rune, and ridiculously scrupulous homework project they had been set seemed to slip away with each ragged breath without a second thought.<strong>  </strong></p><p>That was before McGonagall decided to throw a Grawp sized spanner in the works and start testing them early.<strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘Damn it I should have known. Stupid. Stupid. STUPI-’ </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“Hermione?” <strong> </strong></p><p>She blinked a few times, noticing Dean standing in front of her. Concern etched across his face, although his lips quirked with amusement before taking her arm and guiding them to the rest of the group already seated. ‘<em> When did they get here?’ </em> Judging by the blank stares at the table, Hermione was not the only one baffled at being summoned here. <strong> </strong></p><p>“You’re starting to wear a hole in the carpet. I highly doubt the entire eighth year is in trouble, don’t panic.” <strong><strong> </strong> </strong></p><p>Trouble? He seriously thinks that she would believe she <em> of all people </em> had done something wrong? Hermione stared at him incredulously. “What if it’s a surprise test?” She hissed, gaining a few head snaps their direction, worry flitting across their paling faces.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Then honestly?” Dean snorts as they take their seats besides Neville, “you’re probably the only one here that isn’t screwed. Besides, I know McGonagall likes to crack the whip and throw us a shit ton of work, but even <em> she </em> can’t be that cruel.”<strong> </strong></p><p>“Thank you for that rather astute observation, Mr Thomas.” A hush fell over the eighth years as the tight lipped Headmistress strode from her chambers to stand before her desk. Dean winced as he locked eyes with McGonagall’s piercing gaze, unable to hold it for long. <strong> </strong></p><p>Hermione was pleased to see that after taking the role of Headmistress, McGonagall seemed to have had a hard time steering away from her house pride. The circular office was much the same as when Dumbledore had occupied it; somewhat house neutral decor- except for the large circular table they now sat at, taking up the centre of the room. The chairs a deep crimson with gold filigree across the arms and legs, chairs which had Malfoy and Zabini’s eyes rolling as they took their seats across from her with their fellow Slytherins, looking for all the world as if this meeting was the greatest inconvenience to them all, no sign of internal panic Hermione currently felt. <strong> </strong></p><p>Once everyone had sat down McGonagall cleared her throat, finally taking her eyes off the wilting Gryffindor beside Hermione. <strong> </strong></p><p>“Thank you for joining me this evening. My apologies if my note was a bit vague, I want to ensure that what we discuss in this meeting will not be shared with the other students just yet. You see it has come to my attention that in past years, Hogwarts is perhaps lacking some <em> excitement </em> .” McGonagall gave a brief pause, taking a deep breath as if it physically pained her to reveal why they were here. “So this year I am proposing an event- <em> after </em>your N.E.W.T’s of course, that every seventh and eighth year can take part in should they wish to. Something to look forward to before leaving the school forever, and perhaps an event we could potentially carry on as an annual tradition.”<strong> </strong></p><p>“Leaving the school forever.” <strong> </strong></p><p>Hermione didn’t notice that every student at the table sat up straighter, a mixture of shock and excitement adorning their faces, as those words landed in her chest like a dead weight. Even after being on the run for a year and all that happened in this castle last March, she couldn’t help but feel eager and honoured to return to her studies. Hogwarts would always be her home, the thought of leaving for good… <strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘No. Do not think about it, enjoy your time while you can.’  </em>
  <strong>  </strong>
</p><p>Dean had begun nudging her side, eyebrow quirked and sporting a huge grin. ‘<em> Yes ok, he was right. Damn my paranoid mind!’ </em>Hermione released a long breath, returning her friend’s smile.<strong> </strong></p><p>“What sort of event Professor?” McGonagall hesitates again, trying to mask her sceptical appearance.<strong> </strong></p><p>“That’s where you come in Miss Greengrass, I want ideas from you all. You will vote for your favourites which I will then take to the other staff members and ultimately choose the winning idea.”<strong> </strong></p><p>“So.. we can suggest <em> anything </em>?” Dean sounded like Christmas had come early. It was hard now not to latch on to the excitement in the room.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Yes Mr. Thomas, so long as it isn’t <em>dangerous</em> <em>or inappropriate.</em>” She gave the students a pointed stare. “We do <em>not</em> need a repeat of your fourth year.” <strong> </strong></p><p><em> ‘Yes, let’s keep fire breathing dragons, Grindylows and a death trap maze out of this please </em>.’<strong> </strong></p><p>It took all of two seconds for the table to erupt with chatter and ideas being thrown back and forth. Some, Hermione had to admit were intriguing. Like the panic room that challenges your practical and mental skills in order to escape. Or the timed scavenger hunt and team building obstacle course. Other ideas weren’t <em> too </em> awful, but the rest? Well.. she would rather be put in a pit with a blast ended skrewt. ‘ <em> Sayonara! It’s been fun </em> . <em> ’ </em><strong> </strong></p><p>“What about a dance?” Parvati squeals. Her question sparking instant chatter from Susan, Hannah, and Sue. Even Neville’s eyes light up whilst the rest of the table collectively groans. <strong> </strong></p><p>“You seem to be forgetting that the event is supposed to be <em> fun, </em> Patil.” Theo drawls.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Well what <em> great </em> suggestion do you have?” She retorts. The Slytherins up until this point had remained quiet. Seemingly happy to observe but call out the outlandish ideas. Not for the first time this evening Hermione found herself praying, praying that <em> someone </em> would come up with something better than either a ball, catch the Niffler- <em> Merlin’s beard </em> - a wizarding version of dodgeball, (which brought back unwelcome memories of year six PE when Jamie Bradshaw had hit her square in the face, rendering her 10 year old self unconscious with a bloodied nose), football, or and Merlin save them all, the floor is lava… <em> Hogwarts style </em> . Suffice to say that idea was out faster than Tracy Davis could say <em> ‘Are you fucking insane’ </em>.<strong>  </strong></p><p>A grin split across Theo’s face as Parvati crossed her arms, waiting. “Broom race!” <strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘Oh gods help us all.’ </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“We make it a relay, throw in some obstacles, first house to get all their players through, wins!” To her utter horror, multiple students exclaimed their intrigue at his suggestion, including Dean. Hermione looked to her left and as suspected, Neville’s pallor somewhat reminiscent of a vampire with a serious case of the runs. She gave his arm a squeeze, it was no secret he hates flying, something Hermione could empathise with. <strong> </strong></p><p>“What kind of obstacles? OH! How about bludgers? And we have to fly through hoops for checkpoints! If you crash you’re out the game!” <strong> </strong></p><p><em> ‘Damn it Dean!’ </em>  <strong> </strong></p><p>Theo’s eyes lit up at the suggestion and Hermione had absolutely no remorse for slamming her heel down on Dean’s foot, glaring her best ‘<em> are you out of your damn mind’ </em> look, tilting her head in Neville’s direction for extra emphasis. <strong> </strong></p><p>“What?” He asked innocently, “It was just an idea..” He trails off with a defeated sigh, clearly Neville is sporting the same horrified expression, along with half the table. Rubbing her eyes with the palm of her hands, Hermione allowed herself a few steadying breaths. They needed another good idea fast or this is going to be a long night.<strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘Think, Hermione.’ </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“Something wrong, Granger?”<strong> </strong></p><p>Her eyes snapped up to meet a <em> grinning </em> Malfoy. She really hadn’t been all that subtle in her distaste for brooms over the years. His silver eyes pin Hermione to her seat. <em> ‘Damn myself to hell, I can’t help but drink them in.’ </em> It unnerved the crap out of her that his hostility just somehow dissipated after the war. Hermione was not equipped to handle a relaxed, dare she say pleasant Draco. Even going so far as to crack jokes during class, and shooting grins that completely threw certain girl’s off kilter. But not Hermione. <strong> </strong></p><p><em> ‘Nope. No… never.’ </em>  But as the days went by where she rarely interacted with him, she found her eyes wandering, searching, betraying. <strong> </strong></p><p>‘<em> So yes Malfoy, I’d say something is </em> very <em> wrong with this situation.’ </em> He raises an eyebrow at her. How long had she been staring?<strong> </strong></p><p>“We have Quidditch for those of you who are broom crazed lunatics! Why are you all so eager to bloody everyone up?” Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline, although his insufferable smirk decides to make an appearance. Merlin, it could make even the most withered of ovaries explode. “Can we maybe come up with something that involves being on the ground? And <em> no </em> bludgers.” Relieved nods were shared between Hannah and the Patil twins. Neville released a long breath beside me, some colour coming back to his pasty cheeks. <strong> </strong></p><p>“Because you know you don’t stand a chance against us in the sky…” His gaze flitted to Neville for a second before fixing on her again. It wasn’t even a question, given where they currently stood in the Quidditch leader board- much to Ginny’s chagrin. <strong> </strong></p><p><em> ‘Ok I take it back, he’s still an arrogant prick.’ </em>  <strong> </strong></p><p>“We can fly just fine, thank you very much,'' Hermione did her best to ignore the smug disbelief on his face. “But surprisingly enough, we aren’t all hell bent on <em> killing </em> ourselves in the process. You heard Professor McGonagall, nothing dangerous!” Looking to her left to where McGonagall was observing the debate, she noticed the Professor’s looked tired, the choice of including the eighth years in this was evidently a regrettable decision already. <strong> </strong></p><p>“That is correct, Miss Granger.” She confirms. ‘<em> Suck it Malfoy </em> . <em> ’ </em> Hermione threw him a sweet smile which only seemed to make his shit eating grin more prominent. “I’m sorry but I must insist that bludgers, and whilst we’re on the subject, broomsticks too, are to remain <em> solely </em> on the Quidditch pitch. It would certainly save Madam Pomfrey and I an awful lot of stress.”<strong> </strong></p><p>Theo huffed dramatically, throwing his hands up in defeat. “<em> Fine </em> , can’t blame a guy for trying!” Then turned his attention to Hermione. “If we aren’t allowed to have any fun then would you care to jump in and grace us with that spectacular brain of yours?” He made a mocking half bow, revelling in her scowl. “ <em> O golden one. </em>”<strong> </strong></p><p>Blaise and Malfoy snicker and she had to suppress the urge to smack the grins straight off their faces, it’s not like she hadn’t done it before, but perhaps not the smartest move in front of their Headmistress, even if she was sharing Hermione’s scowl at the three of them. <strong> </strong></p><p>“While a dance would be fun- <em>for some” </em>I add at Theo’s scoff, “it’s not exactly challenging is it? And-” she held up a hand to stop Dean’s interruption, “as much as football would demonstrate some physical skills, it’s a Muggle game with a player limit.” Not to mention boring as hell. “We should be using this event to show what we have learnt over the last seven, or in this case, eight years of school. Why not combine Muggle and magic? You want a final shot at winning glory for your house… We need to be thinking bigger.”<strong> </strong></p><p>An idea formed in her mind, it could be mad, but if this works.. She met Malfoy’s gaze, daring him to protest the idea of a muggle influenced event. He’s still amused, but sensibly refrains. Again, she’s unsure how to process that. <strong> </strong></p><p>“Suspense is really killing me here, Granger.” Sarcasm really does seem to be a required trait of Slytherins. Usually Hermione would be all for the idea of bringing people together, but not this time.<em>   </em><strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘Oh no. It’s on.’  </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“Capture the flag.” As soon as the words were out of her mouth Dean latched onto her arm, shaking it back and forth, a huge grin plastered on his face.<strong> </strong></p><p>“That’s brilliant! I used to play that in primary school!” It takes her a second to realise that the two of them are perhaps the only ones at the table who know what the game is, it would explain the blank stares, especially from the purebloods. <strong> </strong></p><p>Blaise interrupts the confused silence. “Uh- how exactly did you play that in muggle school without a broom?” <strong> </strong></p><p>“What do you mean?”<strong> </strong></p><p>“Well, that’s a wizards game we used to play as kids. You each wear a belt with flags strapped them, and whoever has stolen the most flags at the end of the allotted time, wins..” Blaise narrows his eyes as if this was the most obvious answer in the world, and Hermione couldn’t contain her snort at the fact they have unknowingly been playing a version of a Muggle game since childhood.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Would have been a great idea too”, Theo grumbles. “If Granger hadn’t have banned flying.” She would have felt guilty, she truly would have, but she really didn’t. “Admit it, everything is better on a broom.” A laugh escapes her. <strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘You’re preaching to the wrong choir mate.’ </em>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>“The <em> original </em> game is on the ground and involves some stealth and subterfuge. Not the blind chaos that you just described.” Blaise leans back in his chair, eyebrows raised, and motions for her to continue. <strong> </strong></p><p>“So, each house gets their own flag which they need to defend. We each have an area where we hide our flag. The aim is to cross over into enemy lines, or in this case house bases, to steal your opponent's flags. Usually it’s one on one and whoever is first to steal a flag and bring it back to their base, wins. But we could modify it so that we need to take two house flags and bring them back into your own house territory. If you come across an enemy and grab them, they are removed from the game until someone from their team can free them. To eliminate the risk of sounding too boring, instead of touching someone to take them out the game, we can use magic. Just nothing harmful of course.” Hermione rushed to add, glancing at the headmistress. <strong> </strong></p><p>“And where did you envision this would take place, Miss Granger?”<strong> </strong></p><p>“Originally I had thought of somewhere in the castle, but it would most likely have to be an area on the grounds. The castle is too compact, It would be hard for spectators to watch and we would need people to check that players are abiding by the rules.” Hermione chose to ignore Theo’s eye roll at that. <strong> </strong></p><p>McGonagall’s expression turned pensive for a moment, mulling over the idea, and Hermione had a horrible feeling that this might just be the most ridiculous thing she’s ever said to her Professor. But just as she starts to regret intervening at all, McGonagall slowly nods in her direction.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Make sure to write down all the rules before you leave, feel free to discuss amongst yourselves incase anyone else has any thoughts."<strong>  </strong></p><p>Once the initial shock had worn off, Hermione frantically grabbed for her parchment and quill, jotting down everything she knew about the game and listening to everyone’s input- the sensible ideas anyway. And that’s how the next hour flies by, the excitement growing with every discussion on the games. Hermione hoping they vote for this idea to go through to the other Professors. It would certainly be something to look forward to. Besides, if the wide grins are anything to go by, it seems the thought of being able to jinx their fellow students is just too tempting to pass up. Again, this could be a <em> very </em> bad idea.<strong> </strong></p><p>Once all of their ideas were written up and finalised, McGonagall asked each student to write down their top three choices- besides our own- and passed around a bowl to place the votes in. It’s a tense wait as the headmistress tallies up the small bundles of parchment.<strong> </strong></p><p>“The top three are as follows. With 16 votes, the panic room. With 18 votes we have the scavenger hunt.” The entire table seemed to collectively hold their breath.<strong> </strong></p><p>“And with 21 votes, capture the flag.”<strong>  </strong></p><p>Hermione’s jaw nearly hit the mahogany table as her quick head count proved very single student had voted for her idea. This wasn’t something that usually happened to Hermione, <em> at all. </em> Always used to being singled out for her choice of extra curricular activities, she now worried she had gone too far. Hermione thought how Harry and Ron would react to her slightly impulsive idea, they would have loved to play had they been here… but surprisingly enough, that brought little comfort to Hermione, because nothing those boys ever did was considered sensible. She tried her best to focus on the delighted grins and chatter across the table, whatever the outcome of the staff vote, at least they won’t have to run around the castle after a Niffler or plummet to their deaths from a broom race.<strong>  </strong></p><p>After their celebrations died down, the headmistress bade them all goodnight, informing them to not share any details of this evening until the event is announced in the next few weeks. Realising they were now well past curfew, Hermione only just managed to drag herself up the stairs to the Gryffindor dormitories before exhaustion hit. But as she dove under the covers, Fay started excitedly whispering all the jinxes she would love to use on her fellow eighth years, casting a muffliato to hide their laughter over the thought of Theo doing the Can-can whilst his head is encased in a pumpkin. Suddenly it’s as if they weren’t tired at all, and when Parvati joins the hysterics explaining in great detail what she would like to do to Anthony Goldstein, (something which is <em> definitely </em> unsuitable for the younger years- or anyone in fact, to witness), that Hermione can’t help but realise how much they resemble the Muggle stereotype of cackling witches, plotting their victims demise through the late hours of the night. Yes, this will <em> definitely </em> be an event for the books.<strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p>***<strong>  </strong></p><p>Turns out Professor McGonagall didn’t make them wait the few weeks she had previously estimated. That Friday, only four days after their meeting, she stood up to address the great hall after dinner. <strong><strong> </strong> </strong></p><p>“If I may please have your attention. I have some exciting news to share with you all.”<strong> </strong></p><p>The chatter in the hall died down as every student looked towards the front, all except the eighth years who were sharing knowing, excited looks with one another, Hermione all of a sudden feeling quite ill.<strong> </strong></p><p>“We have decided to host an event for the students who will be leaving the school after their N.E.W.T exams this year. This idea, along with many others was created and voted for by our eighth years.” <strong> </strong></p><p>Ginny whirled back around in her seat and looked incredulously between Hermione and Neville. ‘<em> Yikes.’ </em> <strong> </strong></p><p>“Myself and the rest of the staff have chosen the winning idea. This event is not by any means mandatory but is open to all seventh and eighth year students.”<strong> </strong></p><p>Whispers and murmurs could be heard over the hall from disgruntled students. Catching on to the palpable disappointment of the younger years, McGonagall adds that they will have an end of year ball, this time more satisfactory chatter erupted from the tables. <strong> </strong></p><p>“And when were you going to tell me about this?” Ginny hissed in her ear. Truth be told, Hermione had been expecting this. Ginny was not one who liked being kept in the dark about, well, anything really, but Hermione still felt a little guilty at keeping this secret from her.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Sorry Gin, we were told not to mention anything.” Her huff was the only response.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Besides” Neville piped up from across the table, “we don’t even know what event they’ve gone for yet, we just got to pick our top three.” <strong> </strong></p><p>“So what idea did you come up with?”<strong> </strong></p><p>Before they had the chance to reply, McGonagall’s voice broke out amongst the hall once more. “I am delighted to announce that our new annual event will be Capture the Flag! Game rules will be sent to your tables momentarily, please read them <em> carefully </em>-”<strong> </strong></p><p>The rest of the Headmistress’ words couldn’t be heard for they were drowned by the roar of victorious cries that erupted in the hall. All Hermione could do was stare completely dumbfounded at Neville and Dean, her name being called- no- <em> chanted </em>, from multiple tables. Ginny bursts out with a maniacal laugh as Hermione is pulled from the bench and lifted into the air by a pair of strong arms. She was definitely going to be sick now.<strong> </strong></p><p>“Guess that answers my question then?” She shouts over the crowd.<strong> </strong></p><p>“DEAN!” She squealed, kicking out unsuccessfully. “Put. Me. Down<em> .” </em> His grip only tightened as he grinned from ear to ear. All attempts to break free were futile as she now clung on for dear life as Dean span them round. “ <em> Now!” </em><strong> </strong></p><p><em> ‘No, no, no.’ </em>  Well isn’t this just fantastic, the whole school being witness to her inevitably throwing up all over my housemate. <em> ‘Watch out people, everyone in the front row is in the splash zone.’ </em><strong> </strong></p><p>Mercifully he stops spinning, and from this vantage point Hermione’s eyes travel over to the furthest table from us, and land on a set of grey ones. His lips split into the most terrifying grin she had ever seen on his face. Theo, Blaise and the rest of the N.E.W.T level students around him drumming their fists against the table. A noise between what can only be described as an anxious laugh and a gag escapes Hermione at the sight. <strong> </strong></p><p>
  <em> ‘What have I done?’ </em>
