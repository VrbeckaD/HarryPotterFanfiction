  <b>Chapter 1: Return to the Chamber</b>
</p><p>Harry was nervous as he sat waiting for Dumbledore to return to his office. He had been asked to go to his office after the welcoming feast, but Dumbledore had had to talk to one of the professors before meeting him. Harry was worried that he was in trouble over what had happened with Aunt Marge, or it had something to do with the dementors or, knowing his luck, had something to do with Sirius Black. Harry’s eyes widened with the realization that he was already troubled by so much and classes hadn’t even start yet.</p><p>A soft trill caught Harry’s attention as Fawkes flew over to land on the back of the chair Harry was sitting in. He relaxed in his seat as he let the phoenix’s sing take away his worries, even if it was only for a moment. That is probably why he was so startled when he heard Dumbledore clearing his throat from his seat at his desk. Harry hadn’t noticed as the headmaster had entered his office or taken his seat right in front of him. Fawkes flew back to his perch in a huff.</p><p>“Headmaster, I’m not in trouble, am I?” Harry began to ask.</p><p>“No Harry,” Dumbledore said with a twinkle appearing in his eye. “I actually called you here to ask a favor.”</p><p>“A favor?” asked Harry confused. He wondered what he could do for the headmaster.</p><p>“Yes. You see, I wish to explore the Chamber of Secrets. Make sure Tom didn’t leave anything down there for one, but also it’s the first opportunity we’ve had at Hogwarts for centuries to learn more about the founders. We don’t know what else Slytherin might have left down there.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said simply. He had never really though about what else might be down there. Of course, having the little sister of your best friend be in mortal danger while being in mortal danger yourself with a huge basilisk after you just might drive any other concerns or considerations from your mind.</p><p>“Of course I’ll open it,” Harry offered.</p><p>“Great!” Dumbledore said cheerfully, the twinkle more pronounced in his eyes than Harry had ever seen before. “Is it alright if we do it now? Or do you wish to settle in for the night?”</p><p>“Now is fine, Sir,” Harry said softly while standing up. Truthfully he didn’t want to go to bed while he was still bothered by what had happened earlier with the dementors.</p><p>“Some of the other professors will be joining us,” explained Dumbledore as he wrote out some letter before enchanting them to fly. “I already asked them if they would be willing to help if you agreed. They’ll meet us in the bathroom as soon as they receive their notices.”</p><p>Harry simply nodded unable to think of anything to say and led the way to Moaning Myrtle’s haunting place. When they arrived it was to discover the resident ghost having a fit in front of Severus Snape, who seemed very annoyed. Harry watched in awe as Snape reached new heights in volume and anger before Myrtle lost control and attempted to slap Snape. Harry’s eyes widened as her hand went through Snape’s head. Myrtle escaped into her toilet as Snape turned blue and reached for his wand. Harry wondered for a moment what exactly Snape thought he could do to a ghost.</p><p>“Severus,” Dumbledore said sternly.</p><p>Snape spun around, startled, “Headmaster. Potter.”</p><p>Harry watched as Snape took on the appearance of civility, with a slight sneer. Harry bit his lip as he tried to hold back a decidedly non-masculine giggle. It just wasn’t intimidating in any way with Snape so blue. Harry spared a moment to ponder if it was because ghosts are just really cold or if it’s because of the amount of time Myrtle spends in her toilet. Harry almost jumped as he realized Snape was glaring at him.</p><p>Anything else that might have been said wasn’t as other professors arrived, one by one. Soon the bathroom contained not only Harry, Snape and the headmaster, but also professors McGonagall, Lupin, Flitwick, Sprout and lastly, Madame Pomfrey. Seeing his shocked gaze she gave a slight chuckle, “I don’t limit myself to treating students, Harry. I can also treat professors. And when they’re insisting on going into unknown places that are most likely very dangerous I insist on being nearby.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said softly, surprised.</p><p>“Is everyone ready?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>A bunch of affirmatives followed.</p><p>“Harry, if you would,” Dumbledore said looking at Harry.</p><p>Harry nodded, turned to the opening and hissed, “Open.”</p><p>Soon the professors began carefully entering the Chamber of Secrets. As Harry prepared to join them, Madame Pomfrey grabbed his arm. “What do you think you’re doing?” she demanded. Without letting him respond she continues, “You’re staying here, where it’s safe.”</p><p>Snape, the last of the professors to go, sneered, “Did you think that you were needed beyond your ability to open this passageway? You’re such a foolish boy.” Snape seemed almost proud of his last dig before going through the opening.</p><p>Harry, who was feeling somewhat annoyed, frustrated, or something similar, turned to the school healer and asked, “How are we supposed to know what’s going on?”</p><p>“That’s what we have this for,” she said revealing a mirror in her hand. “We’ll be using this and its counterpart, which is with Professor Lupin, to communicate. See? It’s already active. SONOROUS,” she said with a wave of her wand at the mirror.</p><p>Harry blinked as he could suddenly hear the professors as they explored the chamber. Harry sat down on the floor, soon joined by Madame Pomfrey. They sat comfortably leaning against the clean bathroom walls as they listened to what was going on in the chamber. She explained various spells the explorers were using. Harry paid rapt attention. He never knew when he might need to know something so he mentally filed away the spells he didn’t know, such as how to lift, vanish and shrink objects.</p><p>“That’s the rockslide that Lockhart caused,” Harry explained to the nurse.</p><p>The two sat in silence while the professors’ footsteps echoed out from the mirror as they explored the chamber beyond where Ron had reached.</p><p>“Potter killed that!?” came the shocked voice of Severus Snape.</p><p>The professors’ voices overlapped as they each spoke their amazement at the sight of the huge, dead, basilisk that Harry had almost died killing. Harry blushed, almost embarrassed, at the attention he was receiving, if only vocally.</p><p>Madame Pomfrey reached out and drew Harry into a sideways hug. She’d had some idea what had happed down there, since she’d finished patching Harry. Hearing exactly what had caused it made all the already overprotective instincts she had for Harry go into overdrive. Harry relaxed into the nurse’s embrace. To be held in the arms of someone who was concerned about him was something he had always dreamt of in his pre-Hogwarts days. Harry relaxed as he allowed the voices of those below them to flow over him.</p><p>Harry jerked awake as he heard Professor Lupin’s voice shouting out to the others, “You won’t believe this.”</p><p>Harry blinked his eyes to realize that he was sleeping on a cot in Myrtle’s bathroom that Madame Pomfrey must have summoned. As he sat up he realized that the night must have passed them by as the light from the early dawn was starting to flood the room.</p><p>“Oh my,” McGonagall said after apparently joining Lupin. “It’s a bedroom. This must have been Slytherin’s private rooms.”</p><p>“It’s getting late, or rather early,” Dumbledore said, speaking for the first time as far as Harry could remember since going into the chamber. “We’ll have to come back after the students go back to bed. They’ll be getting up anytime now.”</p><p>“Alright,” came the voices of the others, each sounding either tired or regretful.</p><p>“Wait,” Lupin called out before even a dozen footsteps could be heard through the mirror. “I see something.”</p><p>“Is that a portrait?” asked Flitwick.</p><p>“It looks like it’s a painting of Hogwarts,” Lupin said as he apparently took the painting down for a closer look.</p><p>“What’s that?” came McGonagall’s voice.</p><p>“It looks like a couple of plaques, I can’t tell what the one on the side says,” Lupin murmured after a moment. “Oh my! The center one… it… it says ‘The Founders’.”</p><p>
  <b>Ch 2: Onward from the Chamber</b>
</p><p>Harry waited impatiently at the opening to the chamber. Madame Pomphrey was waiting a little more patiently by his side. They were both anxious to see everyone return, though they could hear odd sounds from the mirror they weren't anything worrisome. Harry had hissed open the passage several minutes ago and was worried about what was taking so long. The passage began to close but returned to open after another hiss from Harry. Harry furrowed his brow when he considered that the doorway apparently closed automatically every 15 minutes. Harry straightened up as he heard the professors in the passage. He and Madame Pomphrey stepped away from the opening as the professors flew through it. Harry looked on as Professor Lupin and Snape, on brooms, carefully carried a painting between them. The others used their wands to help, by levitating rocks under the frame. This must have been what took them so long to return from the chamber. Harry rushed forward and took brooms from the professors as they landed so they could slowly lower the painting to the ground.</p><p>Madame Pomprey frowned as she realized how much strain the professors had been under while carrying it. "Couldn't you have just used a lightening charm?" she asked in concern as she began running diagnostic spells on them to make sure they were alright.</p><p>"No," Flitwick explained, "the painting has more protections cast on it than I've ever seen before. Neither Dumbledore nor I recognize most of them. It's very impressive." His eyes were wide and gleaming.</p><p>Harry had the disturbing though that they looked a lot like Dudley's when he was about to eat. Harry turned away not liking where his thoughts were going when he caught sight of the painted image. He stepped closer to it as he took in the beautiful landscape. It was Hogwarts and the Forbidden forest. The stones on the castle were gleaming and the landscaping was very different from what he saw when on the grounds.</p><p>"Is, is this?" Harry tried to ask.</p><p>"I believe it is Hogwarts when it was first built," Dumbledore said as Lupin and Snape leaned it against the wall. Even Snape was impressed with the detail, not that he would say anything. He and Lupin came to stand with the other professors taking it in in the light of the day. None of them had ever seen or even hear of a large magical painting like it before.</p><p>Harry blinked his eyes as he took in the details before he noticed odd details in the frame. Harry leaned in to look closer at the oddly dust free frame. "What are these?" he asked, his hand running over the strange markings.</p><p>*POF*</p><p>"Master Bumblebee," said the house elf that appeared before them, "Tizzy is here to inform master that it is time for breakfast."</p><p>"Ah," Dumbledore allowed a twinkle to enter his eye. "Let us take this painting to the great hall for the students to enjoy." Dumbledore turned towards Harry, "Will you be alright, my boy? This cannot have been a restful night for you."</p><p>"I'm fine Headmaster," Harry said with a smile.</p><p>"I made sure he slept," Madame Pomphrey said as she gently poked Lupin's arm with her wand. "Though someone else I could name overexerted himself a little."</p><p>Lupin gave her a soft, but wide grin, "I'm fine Poppy. I do know my limits."</p><p>She gave a little harrumph that was full of doubt as she moved on to Professor Flitwick. Harry grinned at this, it was nice to know he wasn't the only one she acted like a mother hen towards. Lupin, noticing his smile, smiled at him, Harry smiled back as he turned to look at the painting again, never noticing the sadness in Lupin's eyes.</p><p>Harry helped as they lifted the painting up to take it to the great hall. Harry knew the Hermione would be very excited to see the painting and tell him all sorts of facts from 'Hogwarts a History' that he wasn't really interested in but would pretend he was for her sake. It wasn't easy but with all the extra hands they were able to carry it all the way to the great hall and place it so it was leaning up against the wall of the entrance. Several students gazed at it in confusion as the teachers, and Harry, took their normal seats. Although Dumbledore stood up for a few extra moments to explain that they'd found a painting done when Hogwarts was first built.</p><p>Harry kind of tuned him out as he already knew this and was soon bombarded with questions from Hermione asking where he'd been and where the painting had come from. Harry explained shortly, without great detail as he grabbed one of the plates Ron had made for himself and claimed it for himself. Ron looked up about to protest as he realized that Harry wasn't going to be able to make himself a plate without interrupting Hermione. Ron shrugged and made himself another plate. It was only about 15 minutes into eating breakfast when there was a disturbance.</p><p>"Oh!!" cried out a seventh year girl from Hufflepuff who had been seated near the door. "There's movement!"</p><p>Several students came to join her as she rose to get a better look at the painting. They chatted loudly to each other as they examined the large landscape. As their voices rose higher it caught the attention of someone unexpected. Silence filled the great hall as they heard a voice coming from the painting.</p><p>"Rowena! I was right, we've been moved," the soft voice was surprising loud as the students stared at the painting in shock.</p><p>"I'll go get the others!" came a more commanding female voice as the student saw a small figure running towards the painting version of Hogwarts.</p><p>The teachers, as this point, had come down to join the students and so had an excellent view as a beautiful woman appeared in the frame. She smiled shyly at the gathering before her.</p><p>"Hello," she said softly, the students identified her as the first speaker from the painting. The newly risen sun in the background made her hair look like shimmering gold. Her hands were nervously clasped at the pendant she was wearing around her neck. "I am Helga Hufflepuff, it's nice to meet you all. We haven't met anyone new in so long. Not since Sal moved the painting into Salazar's chambers."</p><p>"You're Helga Hufflepuff, the founder of Hogwarts?" Dumbledore asked as he came closer to the painting, the children moving out of his way without being asked.</p><p>"Co-founder, yes," Helga nodded her head in agreement or in greeting, the others weren't sure.</p><p>"Helga," called out the woman rushing towards them. She came to a stop beside Helga. Her face was flushed, probably from running. Her long red hair flowed down to her waist. Neither she nor Helga wore traditional robes Harry quickly noted as he came to stand next to Dumbledore. They wore long dresses with robes over them. The robes were light blue and green respectively. Harry noticed several of the older male students checking them out.</p><p>"Oh, hello," the second woman called out with a light gasp, the running must have tired her Harry realized. "I am Rowena Ravenclaw. I'm glad to see someone finally moved us out of Salazar's chambers. The others will be joining us shortly," she said smiling at the confused students in front of her.</p><p>"Others?" stammered Neville, who was the first student to regain any control of his speech. Admittedly he probably had the most restful sleep of all the students since he'd been in the hospital wing sleeping off the dreamless sleep potion he'd been given after the Dementor attack.</p><p>"Of course! Godric, Salazar and Anne."</p><p>"Salazar?" several students said in unison.</p><p>Even more said, "Anne?" in unison.</p><p>"Of course…" Rowena's voice trailed off. "Oh! Yes! I'd forgotten how much has been forgotten about us. Anne is Salazar's wife."</p><p>"But this painting is from the time of the founding of Hogwarts," one student's voice was heard over the strange lull in sound.</p><p>"Yes it is."</p><p>"I think he means why isn't she considered a founder as well, Rowena," Helga said softly. "Anne was very busy helping to set up Gringotts while we were setting up Hogwarts. I believe she is probably the only human to reach such heights in the magical banking industry. Most of the original contract work they did was designed by her. She did get us a great deal of financial aide in setting up Hogwarts. Things like accounts for teachers, student scholarships. She's always been a demon where money is involved."</p><p>Rowena let out a loud giggle when she heard that. The students were staring at them both in amazement. Some let out slight gasps as three figures approached them in the painting. An older gentleman wearing glasses, a young man and another woman. All three weren't wearing robes, indeed the two younger people didn't even appear to have on nearly as many clothes as the others, in fact they looked like they'd dressed in quite a hurry.</p><p>Rowena turned to them with a large smile. "Isn't it wonderful? We're out of your chambers, Salazar."</p><p>"It is indeed," Salazar, the young man said with a small smile. "How I wish we'd enchanted the painting to remain in the great hall. Even I can get sick of my private chambers when I don't get to meet anyone new."</p><p>"Private chambers?" Harry asked.</p><p>"My grandson Sal renamed them my secret chambers, like everyone hadn't know where they were until then. He even converted the entryway into a bathroom."</p><p>"What about your basilisk?"</p><p>"It was kept in hibernation until Sal accidentally turned it off when leaving the chamber the last time. There wasn't much I could do for her inside this painting."</p><p>"You wouldn't believe the nonsense he started spreading about me. … Well actually I suppose you would since that's probably all you've ever heard about me."</p><p>"You mean things like being a blood purist?"</p><p>"That would be quite hypocritical of me," he said with a lopsided grin.</p><p>Harry's eyes widened as he caught the meaning of what he'd just said and blurted out, "You're not a pureblood?"</p><p>Salazar leaned forward, his hands resting on what was the inside frame of the painting, with a slight smirk he announced, "I'm not even a wizard."</p><p>Those gathered around the painting were all in various stages of surprise and shock, though some hid it better than others, *cough*Dumbledore*cough*</p><p>"That's part of why my house trait is cunning. It takes a lot of cunning to make it in the magical world without a drop of magic within you."</p><p>"But, but," stuttered Draco trying to right his rocked world.</p><p>"If it makes you feel better," Anne said coming forward and wrapping an arm around her husband, "I am a pureblood… Although I suppose you would call me a blood traitor what with my marrying a muggle and all."</p><p>"And the rest of you," Draco demanded.</p><p>Rowena and Helga exchanged looks before Rowena spoke up, "I'm muggleborn, to my knowledge there has never been another witch or wizard in my family. Helga is a half-blood, she inherited her magic from her mother."</p><p>"I'm a mixed blood," Godric said speaking up for the first time. "Various members of my family have been magical for centuries, but we didn't care that much about keeping our blood pure, as long as those we married were accepting of magic."</p><p>"But what about being a parseltongue?" Hermione asked. "How could you have the magically inherited ability to talk to snakes without any magic?"</p><p>"The ability to talk to snakes was part of a curse gone wrong," Salazar explained with a frown. "Magic has always acted odd around me. Rowena has a lot of theories about that."</p><p>"What kind of curse can give someone that kind of ability, I've never heard of anything like the happening before," Hermione asked, her eyes focused intently on Slytherin.</p><p>Harry coughed gently, "It has sort of happened before Hermione."</p><p>Hermione's focused gaze moving away from the painting to Harry.</p><p>"I wasn't born with this ability you know, it's a side effect of surviving the killing curse."</p><p>Hermione blushed slightly at having this pointed out to her.</p><p>"Then perhaps you're one of my descendants," Salazar said turning to focus on the young boy standing next to the man he knew had to be the current headmaster.</p><p>"Your current heir is Voldemort," Harry said simply as he ignored the many shudders around him.</p><p>"That doesn't mean you aren't my descendant. Anya and I had four children. Each one of them chose to be the heir of one of us," Salazar gestured to the others in the painting. "Just because the descendant from our oldest, Daniel, chose to follow the dark arts doesn't negate the children who chose to be the heirs of the others."</p><p>"Indeed," Godric said softly while cleaning his glasses, "I might be mistaken but you indeed look like young Alexander. His eyes were most distinctive, just like his fathers'."</p><p>"My mother was muggleborn."</p><p>"Alexander's sister was a squib. You could be a descendant of hers."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"My daughter, Hailey, was Godric's heir. She had two children, Alexander and Rose. Rose had no magic. She eventually fell in love with a muggle and left the wizarding world. She made the decision to cut all ties from magic. We respected that."</p><p>"But wasn't it weird letting your children be claimed magically by others, even if they cared for them?" Hermione asked as she tried to process in all this new information.</p><p>"But we are family," Godric explained. "My daughter became good friends with Salazar and Rowena when we moved into their village."</p><p>"Godric became like a father to us," Salazar interrupted. "My own father was the town drunk and Rowena's father was a doctor who was rarely home."</p><p>"After my daughter, Elizabeth, died," Godric continued, "we all came here and I adopted both Salazar and Rowena as my children."</p><p>"Which is why," Salazar concluded, "we had no problem with our children being labeled heirs to the others."</p><p>
  <b>Chapter 3 – More on the Founders</b>
</p><p>Severus Snape glared at the painting, he could feel his students confusion over what was being revealed and he did worry about them. He did his best to make sure that they'd think for themselves as much as possible and hopefully not make the mistake he and many of their parents had made, following a dark lord, without letting on about his own disloyalty to him. But Salazar Slytherin being a muggle was something that wouldn't fit into their beliefs at all. Besides, how did they even know about the stuff that supposedly happened since they were in the chamber. The Dark Lord would never have told them this and he was the only one to enter the chamber since then.</p><p>"How do you expect us to believe this?" Snape drawled out as he stalked forward, his snakes moving out of his way and crowding in behind him, as if his presence could stop their foundations from crumbling. "If you've been locked away from everything for so long how do you even know how this supposed grandson of yours even re-wrote history."</p><p>Salazar raised an eyebrow as he took in the man before him. "Rowena is brilliant, one of the most brilliant people I have ever known, you think this painting is like those portraits you see hanging around this castle, you're wrong. This… This is beyond what you could possibly be imagining. We spent over a decade working on this, enchanting it. Rowena insured that as long as Hogwarts stood we'd be kept up to date. Every book brought into the library, every publication, all of it, we would have as part of our own library. Why do you think that we speak 'modern' English? Though, if you like, we could talk with 'thee's and 'thou's."</p><p>"That's not really all there is to it," Anne said speaking up.</p><p>"But it's all they need to know now," Salazar said, his own piercing gaze moving from Snape's to Anne, his eyes softening. Anne smiled lovingly up at Salazar, several older girls thought it was sweet that they were still so obviously in love after spending centuries together.</p><p>"What kind of charms are on it?" Flitwick asked, he was far in the back and no one could really see him, but they knew his voice.</p><p>"Many of our own creation," Godric said putting his glasses back on. "We'd rather not share that as fools could use it to damage us, the consequences could be far reaching."</p><p>Dumbledore frowned, "You truly are dissimilar from any portrait I've seen. Most of them don't go beyond what they did in life."</p><p>"Magical portraits were designing by one of my heirs, before we were sealed up, she found this," Godric gestured around him, "fascinating and made her own version, but those painting are simply impressions magically sealed onto canvas. We're really in here."</p><p>"You're a Horcrux?" Dumbeldore's voice couldn't withhold the disgust he felt on that idea. He'd begun to suspect that Tom might have made at least two of them to ensure his immortality, the diary Harry had destroyed the year before being one of them.</p><p>"A Horcrux! A Horcrux is a bloody perversion of what this is!" Godric said in outrage. "This," he continued softer," this is a failsafe."</p><p>"A failsafe?"</p><p>"My daughter died because some idiot thought it would be a great idea to rip a hole through dimensional barriers. It created a doorway, if you will, one that allowed beings that could only be described as demons to walk the Earth. We five were the ones to hold back the tide of invaders." Godric turned away, Salazar reached over and rested a hand gently on his shoulder.</p><p>Rowena continued the explanation, "Because the doorway was so new we eventually found a way to essentially plug it up, but we knew that it wouldn't hold forever. So we created this painting, where the five of us would remain until it breaks. So far it's holding strong, stronger than we ever thought it would. If it remains the way it has it'll be several thousand years still before it breaks."</p><p>"Even if it's not a Horcrux," Dumbledore said staring at Rowena, "to create something like this costs a life, possibly five."</p><p>"And those lives were our own. When Salazar's youngest child graduated we," Rowena looked at the young audience before her and chose her words carefully, "entered the painting."</p><p>Dumbledore looked around the great hall, as if really noticing for the first time all the young eyes and ears paying attention to what was going on before them. "Students! To your dormitories, classes have been canceled for today." When most of the students just stared at him, he spoke again, "Prefects, guide your classmates."</p><p>A couple of the prefects snapped out of it and started by getting their other prefects to help guide their classmates back to their dorms. A couple of the more calculating ones started to plot out how to use what they'd just found out to their advantage while others, the ones who could still think, wondered how they'd tell their family outside of Hogwarts about this.</p><p>"Can I stay?" Harry asked quietly from beside Dumbledore.</p><p>"My boy, I think you should let us deal with this."</p><p>"You should let him stay," Salazar interrupted. "If he's anything like I was at that age he'll find out about whatever you want to talk about anyway. And most likely not in the way you wanted him to find either."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Godric asked Salazar, the students filing slowly past them, some lingering for a chance to listen to them some more. Harry stayed put.</p><p>"Remember when all of you wanted to leave me behind on the vampire hunting because I was the normal one? The one without magic, which isn't fair because my ex-girlfriend was still involved with you all and no one knew she was going to become a seer. I end up showing up and saving you all from zombies, while you were dealing with the evil sisterhood you hadn't told me about."</p><p>Snape frowned as he moved closer to the painting, his students leaving him, knowing he'd tell them anything important if they wanted to know. He crocked his head a little to the side, most people wouldn't have even noticed it was so little. "So you hunted zombies, vampires and," Snape sent a quick glance from the corner of his eye to one of his fellow teachers, "werewolves?"</p><p>"Vampires almost always, zombies usually, werewolves rarely," Salazar said softly. "Most of the vampires we dealt with were evil. We only let a couple of them go."</p><p>"Sometime I regret not killing HIM when I had the chance, no matter how my daughter felt about him," Godric frowned fiercely.</p><p>Rowena had spent this time slowly moving her hands to her hips and stalked forward until she was centered in the painting, "And what do you have against werewolves?" She glared at Snape. "You think they wanted to be bitten? Oh sure there are some that enjoy being werewolves, but that is no way to treat them all like second class citizens! They're human almost all the time!"</p><p>Helga came forward and gently wrapped an arm around Rowena's shoulders, "It's alright Row. He didn't know."</p><p>"I was almost attacked by a werewolf!" Snape said furious. How dare she act like it was just a blind hatred.</p><p>"So was I! The evil werewolf that wanted my boyfriend! He!…" Rowena's voice trailed off. She might not have been in love with him anymore, but she still thought of him fondly.</p><p>"Rowena used to be in a relationship with a werewolf. She was there for him after he was bitten, she was there for him when he killed another werewolf to protect her," Salazar explained softly, watching Rowena softly. "Daniel was an incredible man, his being a werewolf didn't matter to us as long as he wasn't out attacking people during the full moon. After he killed the werewolf that was after Rowena he left us all. He didn't want to accidentally hurt Rowena. By the time he'd found the peace he'd looked for Rowena had met Helga, and had found peace of her own."</p><p>BANG</p><p>Harry jumped slightly as the doors to the Great Hall closed.</p><p>"You dated a werewolf?" Lupin asked in the silence that followed.</p><p>"I loved Daniel, he broke my heart when he left. I didn't care if he was a werewolf or that he'd killed another werewolf to protect me. It took me awhile to get over it. Helga was guiding light," Rowena gazed into Helga's eyes. They smiled at each other as the people gathered around the painting suddenly realized why they'd each taken one of Salazar's children as their heirs instead of having some of their own.</p><p>"I know it hurt him so much when he came back and I'd moved on. He'd spent so much time meditating, learning herbs to stop himself from transforming, that he learned to control the wolf only to loose me forever."</p><p>"He could control the wolf?" Lupin asked as hope filled his heart.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Can you tell me how?" Snape asked giving Lupin a quick glare. "I'm trying to find a cure."</p><p>Rowena smiled softly. "Of course. I'm sure Daniel would be happy to know that all his work helped others."</p><p>
