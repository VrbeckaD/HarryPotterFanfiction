          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in the cells below The Ministry of Magic, intimately close siblings Alecto and Amycus Carrow are awaiting their transfer to Azkaban.</p><p>Alecto scowled. "We switched sides, we shouldn't be here right now."</p><p>Amycus sighed. "We have to face up to what we did, Ally. We hurt many people during our time at Hogwarts and before it."</p><p>Alecto glanced at him through the cell bars and muttered, "I am aware of that fact, but I didn't expect it would come to this."</p><p>Amycus reminded her, "We told The Minister that we would accept our sentence if it meant we could be good."</p><p>Alecto frowned. "Azkaban has driven many witches and wizards mad, Am. I don't want that to happen to us."</p><p>Amycus said, "I don't want it to happen either, but we have to face up to our crimes."</p><p>Alecto grasped his hands through the bars and asked, "Will they let us stay together in Azkaban?"</p><p>A familiar deep voice interrupted their conversation, "You will not need to worry about that. I have had a change of heart, Carrows."</p><p>They turned towards the entrance to the cells, Kingsley Shacklebolt was standing there smiling at them.</p><p>Alecto gasped. "Are you being serious?"</p><p>Kingsley beamed, "Deadly, I have been eavesdropping."</p><p>Amycus smirked. "Oh, look at that. The Minister For Magic eavesdropping on his prisoners. Bit of a new low, Shacklebolt."</p><p>Kingsley ignored his jibe and told them, "Before I overheard your conversation, I was coming down here to acquit you both of all charges anyway."</p><p>Alecto inquired, "After all of the pain and suffering we caused, you're just letting us go?"</p><p>Kingsley stated, "No, I never said that I was letting you go. I'm changing your sentence."</p><p>Amycus insisted, "Go on please, Minister."</p><p>Kingsley responded, "Your sentence is now five years serving as Defence Against The Dark Arts Professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."</p><p>Alecto mumbled, "You want us to return after what we did?"</p><p>Kingsley nodded and simply said, "It's that or Azkaban, it's your choice; Carrows."</p></div>
