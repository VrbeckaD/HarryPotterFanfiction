    <p>"Morning Weasley, Potter, Ginny, Granger," says Draco as he breezes in through the door. Potter is the one holding it open; the other three are obviously waiting to pass through it. They can wait a touch longer.</p><p>"You coming to McGonagall's meeting?" Potter asks.</p><p>Draco glances at him, tilts his chin up and sniffs. "It's Monday," he says, mouth on autopilot. "I have eight minutes."</p><p>"Seven now, mate," Weasley says, clapping him on the shoulder as he breezes past.</p><p>"See you then," Potter says, disappearing through the door.</p><p>Draco knows that he won't be late. It takes him five minutes to "settle in" and at most two to climb the stairs, allowing him to avoid the early morning elevator rush and leaving him with a full minute to get his breathing back under control before he has to actually talk to anyone. He sits down at his desk, eyes his coffee in its disposable cup, pulls out his laptop, and eyes the cup again.</p><p>"They didn't add the pump of caramel you don't admit to this morning?" Blaise asks, appearing beside his desk. Draco glances up from his contemplation. Blaise looks resplendent as always, today in a rich burgundy suit that really shouldn't work in their incubator-like office and yet somehow does. His eyes are lined in a subtle, shimmering black. Draco suspects Blaise would look similarly at home wearing that outfit in the bottom of a coal mine, or on Mars. It's obnoxious. He might secretly be magic but so far no one has managed to prove it.</p><p>"I think the barista spiked it," Draco says forlornly. "I hate being betrayed by my coffee. And McGonagall's meeting is in three minutes so I don't have time to get another one."</p><p>"It started three minutes ago," Blaise says agreeably. "What did they spike it with, peppermint?"</p><p>"Some sort of reality-altering drug," Draco replies. He takes a sip to see if he can taste it. "But it doesn't taste any different. Here."</p><p>He holds the cup out to Blaise who looks slowly between it and Draco’s face. "You want me to drink your allegedly spiked coffee." Blaise's mouth is smiling as he speaks but it somehow doesn't quite reach his voice. "Really Draco, I thought we were friends."</p><p>"Oh, right," says Draco, taking another sip as he opens his laptop before remembering the potential contamination. He puts the cup out of reach; when it comes to morning routines he finds muscle memory incredibly hard to break.</p><p>"What makes you think it was spiked?" Blaise asks as he makes space on Draco’s desk in order to lounge more effectively.</p><p>"It looked like Potter had eyeliner on when I walked past him at the elevator," Draco's mouth says, causing him to start and look at the coffee again. He hadn't meant to say that out loud. If he'd needed any further proof that the barista had put something unusual in his drink he had it. What had he done to deserve this? "Just a trick of the light, I'm sure."</p><p>"Well, we can confirm when we get to McGonagall's meeting," Blaise says, kicking himself back upright and shaking out the invisible creases in his jacket. Draco always feels there should be a swelling soundtrack as he does so. Some people had all the luck. "Come on, it's not like you to arrive fashionably late. Can't have you stealing my thunder."</p><p>"What do you mean fashionably late?" Draco asks. "We've still got... Shit."</p><p align="center">***</p><p>McGonagall raises her eyebrow at them when they walk in. On any other day this alone would have been enough to make Draco want to shrivel up and disappear from the surface of the planet. Today he hardly registers her disapproval because Harry Potter, wunderkind of the coding world, has raised an eyebrow too. Underneath his eyebrow is one of those horrendously unfair bottle-green eyes, and between the two is… is…</p><p>Draco has to exercise quite a lot of self-restraint not to crush the coffee in his hand. There's a small huff of surprise from Blaise so it <em>can't</em> be the coffee's fault that Draco is seeing what he's seeing. Potter's eyes are lined with a passable version of smokey eyeliner, the darker colour serving to highlight the green of his eyes. There's something <em>shimmery</em> involved too, up just under his eyebrow and dabbed in at the corners by his nose. It's striking. It's very striking.</p><p>For the next hour Draco looks very very pointedly at the projection screen set up at the front of the conference room. Words and graphs pass in front of his eyes along with a couple images that are probably proof of concepts, or mockups for their newest client, but somehow none of it makes it to the part of his brain that deals with actually thinking. That section's undivided attention has been devoted to one problem and one problem only:</p><p>Why, <em>why</em>, is Harry Potter wearing eye makeup?</p><p>The thing is, Draco muses, trying not to chew too hard on his lower lip, the thing is, Potter, by himself, is bad enough. Potter by himself is an absolute whiz with the computer, and while he might not be as good as Hermione Granger or Percy Weasley when it comes to sheer day to day production he has flashes of insight, intuitive leaps to problem solving, that leave the rest of them in the dust. He's electric, magnetic, with his heart on his sleeve and unabashed about the strength of his feeling on any topic. There's this glint in his eye he gets right before he settles in to a good long argument. Draco knows it well. It makes him a tiny bit weak in the knees.</p><p>And today, Draco realizes with a growing horror, today they have code review, and so he'll probably see that glint coming from between darkly-lined lids.</p><p>"You weren't wrong," Blaise says when McGonagall finally lets them out.</p><p>"I figured," Draco snaps.</p><p>"He pulls it off quite well, don't you think?" Blaise says, nodding in Potter's direction. Draco can't help but look, and to his horror Potter is looking straight back at them over Weasley's shoulder. They make eye contact. Draco fervently hopes for the sprinkler system to malfunction as things have suddenly become very warm. "Don't you think?" Blaise prompts again, as if he can't feel the weight of Potter's gaze.</p><p>"Ngrl," says Draco.</p><p>"It's a shame he's not upgraded the rest of himself to go with it."</p><p>"Erg?"</p><p>"His hair's still a mess," Blaise says, and Draco can't make his arms move fast enough to stop Blaise from pointing, there, in full view of at least half their team. Harry's nudged Weasley and Granger, who have joined Potter in staring at Draco and Blaise. "And look, ratty sweater, tatty t-shirt, ill-fitting kakhis, and are those <em>tennis shoes</em>? My my my, how gauche."</p><p>"He'll <em>hear</em> you," Draco hisses.</p><p>"He <em>has</em> heard you," says Potter, flatly. "Thanks for the fashion tips, Zabini."</p><p>"My pleasure," Blaise says, sweeping a low bow and tipping an imaginary hat. "I live to serve."</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The rest of the day is no better. Draco has three more meetings with Potter, for a total of two hours, seven minutes, and thirty nine seconds spent awkwardly trying to avoid Potter's gaze. The few times anything feels remotely close to normal occur when Potter questions his decisions on any particular section of code and they quickly fall to arguing. The second time this happens Blaise, now serving as the project sponsor representative, does nothing to stop it. He <em>does</em> mime eating a bowl of popcorn however. Draco decides on the spot to take his afternoon coffee break with Pansy instead.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>As it turns out going on his coffee break with Pansy is a horrible idea. "Blaise says you've completely lost your marbles because Potter put on makeup," she says as they stand in the queue.</p><p>Draco's groan in response does nothing to deter Pansy. "Eloquent as always, my dear," she agrees. "And because it’s clear what the topic of conversation is going to be, you are buying my coffee <em>and </em>a pain au chocolat."</p><p>Her pronouncement is enough to shake off some of the stupor Draco has sunk into. He doesn't manage it fast enough to avoid paying for her order however, and then reasons that if he's buying her a pastry he may as well buy himself some lemon loaf.</p><p>"He's wearing <em>eyeliner</em> Pans," Draco sighs as they settle at one of the small tables set outside.He hasn’t even had a sip of coffee yet. "Everything else is the same: ratty clothes, ratty shoes, floppy hair, and then his <em>face</em>."</p><p>Things can't be too bad yet because Pansy merely begins tearing her pain au chocolat into bite-sized pieces and passing them in between her expertly made up lips. If anything the lack of reaction is unnerving - he can't tell if he should try and wait her out or plunge ahead. He hesitates, opens his mouth, and-- "Are you about to wax more rhapsodically than usual about the virtues of his eyes, and the way their new shape highlights his cheekbones or some rot like that?"</p><p>"No!" Draco says guiltily. "No! Definitely not. I was, uh..."</p><p>"You were."</p><p>"I was <em>going</em> to say it was unsporting of Blaise to say anything to you," Draco speaks over her, feeling the blush rise in his cheeks and hearing the way his voice rises horribly higher. Despite his denials, he <em>might</em> have thought that exact phrase earlier in the day, and others such as "his eyes are now the green that represents life itself" and "his eyelashes have to be at least an inch longer, possibly a mile, and every time he blinks they kiss his cheek softly and I want to feel them blinking against my neck" but he has enough self respect to not voice them aloud.</p><p>"Because you knew I would find out anyways since you wouldn't shut up about it? And now you've missed my reaction at the news?"</p><p>"Yes! Oh, no, no, because it just, er…." Pansy leans back and crosses her arms, clearly settling in to wait. It's unfair, really, how she's always right. "Oh alright, fine. But he looks <em>so good</em> and I've had to sit in three meetings with him and-"</p><p>She dismisses his concerns with a flick of her fingers before separating another piece from her pastry. Draco realizes his own is still on his plate, untouched, and he hasn't even tasted his coffee. He hastily takes a sip and thankfully does not burn his tongue. "It's probably a one time thing. He was experimenting on the weekend for who knows what reason and forgot to wash it off."</p><p>That is not a visual that Draco needs: Potter in front of a mirror, staring at his own face as intently as he stares at his screen when there's a bug he's cracked and he only needs to make a few quick changes. Potter biting his lip as he tries hard not to blink, leaning over the counter… "Hmm?"</p><p>Pansy sighs. It sounds like she says something like "oh my god" under her breath which Draco magnanimously chooses to ignore. Instead he finds himself glaring at his lemon loaf as though <em>it</em> is the reason Potter has taken all leave of his senses. "I <em>said </em>he will probably decide it's too much effort tomorrow and go back to his normal, slovenly self."</p><p>Draco clings desperately to this prospect. The alternative is not worth contemplating.</p>
