    <p>
  <span>Neville sighed as he stared at the letter in his hands. His cousin finally got back to him. Walking into the dorm room to see that it was just him and Harry, he smiled, "Hey Harry, you remember that conversation we had at the beginning of the school year?" He asked as he walked over and sat on his bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry sat up and looked at Neville with a thoughtful expression, "You mean the one where I would do anything not to go back to my aunt and uncle’s?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah," Neville said with a nod, looking at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I remember it. Why?" Harry asked confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I think I know how to get you away from your aunt and uncle," Neville said hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you mean?" Harry said, sitting up properly as he looked at Neville shocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, how much do you know about both of our families?" Neville asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not much I am afraid," Harry said hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Really? No one has taught you anything?" Neville asked shocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, it's kind of hard when I am stuck with my magic-hating relatives, Neville," Harry said with a little sass in his tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're right, sorry. Well here are the basics. Your family is just as old as the Black Family. My family is your family's vassal but our families basically treat each other as cousins. When the two family's Heirs are born together, they are raised together. You with me so far?" Neville asked looking at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So basically you're my cousin?" Harry asked, a little confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something like that. The Longbottom family have a duty to keep your family safe. Since you told me what your life is like back home, I can remove you from there. I told Grandma and she already has the paperwork done. But she wants us out of the Country until school starts. In fact... she wants you to do an inheritance test and a medical test." Neville said but was quickly interrupted by Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What is an inheritance test and a medical test?" Harry asked confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh God... Okay. An inheritance test is a test that determines who you are, who you are related to, what titles you can claim and have, what properties you have and your overall net worth. Gran says that the last she heard, the Potter Estate had a net worth of at least three hundred billion on just properties alone. The Medical test is, well, just that. Someone scanning your body completely and documenting everything that has happened to your body since you were born. They should be doing it at school but Dumbledore doesn't enforce it as he should," Neville explained, "But we are getting off topic. After we get those done, I have cousins in Japan that Gran fully trusts, she said if it's bad enough, she would be willing to put in the transfer to Mahoutokoro, their version of Hogwarts, only a lot better and a lot stricter."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So what does this mean?" Harry asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It means you have an escape if you're willing," Neville said looking at Harry. Harry bit his lip before getting up and going over to Neville's bed, crawling in it. Neville's eyes softened, it was rare to see Harry with his defenses down. Not moving or making a sound, he let Harry curl up next to him and cling to him. This year, he and Harry got close since Ron and Hermione seemed to be ignoring Harry because of the Tournament. "Harry, you don't have to decide now," Neville said looking at the male.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Could I...Could we contact Sirius? I...I don't want to decide this without including him," Harry said nervously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're still in contact with him?" Neville said surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. He wasn't th-" He was cut off by Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh we know he didn't do it, Harry, Gran's been trying to get him a trial. His status as godfather is proof enough that he would never put you in danger. Gran was there for that ritual, since your mum and dad used that same ritual to become my godparents," Neville said trying to calm Harry down. "My mum was your godmum. With my mother being your godmum, Longbottoms’ Vassel status to the House of Potter, and Gran being a Potter herself, we have the ultimate claim of you. We could even fight Sirius for his claim over you and win." Neville claimed seeing Harry relax with him saying that. "So, how are we contacting Sirius?" Harry seemed to get up and hurry over to his luggage and pulled out a hand mirror. Closing it and making sure it was put back, he hurried back over to Neville's bed. Harry crawled into the bed before Neville closed the curtains and warded around his bed, making sure no one could hear inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, call him," Neville said nodding to the mirror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Padfoot," Harry said clearly. It took mere moments before Sirius picked up on the other end.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pup! Oh! Hey, Cub!" Sirius said with a smile to Neville. Neville blinked confused and Sirius just laughed. "You and Harry both loved playing with Uncle Paddy and Uncle Remmy. If my godson gets a dog-related nickname, so do you, Longbottom. I swear if it wasn't for your father, I would have snagged your mum."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sirius, who are you talking to?" A voice called from a bit off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The cubs, of course!" Sirius said with a beaming smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harry and who? Ron?" The voice said getting closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, Neville! You know Frankie’s boy?!" Sirius said excitedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What!" The voice got closer and soon both children saw the face of Remus poke over Sirius's shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey Moony," Harry said with a weak smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you, Cub? We heard about the Tri-wizard Tournament. I'm sorry I couldn't come. Neville, how are you? Still getting into the greenhouses?" Remus said broken-heartedly to Harry and then in a cocky tone with Neville, which made him blush a little.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm fine," Neville said before letting Harry speak.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I won... But Cedric is gone...I...I killed Voldemort again... I..I'm not sure if he's gone...but," Harry looked at Neville who gave an encouraging nod. "Sirius, Neville told me about how his family is a vassal of the House of Potter."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, your father and Frank were thick as thieves, almost as close as us. But the bond James and Frank had was more of a big brother looking out for a younger one. Whereas Me, Remmy and James all became brothers in all but blood. What about it?" Sirius said looking at Harry and Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You remember that conversation we had about my aunt and uncle?" Harry asked weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, you just mentioned that you didn't feel safe in that house and that you wanted to stay with me. Harry, what's going on?" Sirius asked worriedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harry you didn't give him the full details?" Neville asked patiently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everyone else was around, Neville," Harry said weakly. Neville nodded and looked at Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sir-" Neville was cut off by Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"None of this ‘sir’ stuff, Uncle Paddy or Snuffles," Sirius said correcting Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Snuffles, Harry's aunt and uncle beat and starve him. He told me about it and I've contacted Gran," Neville said in a no-nonsense tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shit," Remus cursed and Sirius sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, what is this call all about then? Augusta will probably claim Harry as her ward which would be good for Harry. She would fill in the blanks for him," Sirius said his face tightening a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Neville brought up that his gran might transfer us to Mahoutokoro School of Magic," Harry seemed to be hyperventilating a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cub spit it out, you'll feel better, I promise," Sirius said looking at his godson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I want to go but I don't want to leave you here alone. Please come with us, I can't do this alone." Harry quickly said the words sounding like one giant word as tears welled up in his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took Sirius a moment for the words to process in his brain before he smiled weakly. "You’re sure Cub?" Harry just simply nodded his head before Sirius sighed. "Remmy, what is Japan's view on Weres?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They are actually the most tolerant. I wouldn't mind living in Japan," Remus said with a cheeky grin. "If I'm not mistaken, James had family in Japan too."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He did?" Harry asked surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course! They live under a different name though, but they are still family. I am sure you would love them. I know I do!" Sirius said with a smile. "Remus and I will make our way to Longbottom Manor. We'll see you when you get there, Cubs. Nev. You're older, make sure Harry gets there," Sirius said with a pointed look which made Neville laugh</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only by a day! But sure, I'll make sure," Neville said with a nod of his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you think you'll be okay, Pup?" Sirius asked looking at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. Thank you, Sirius." Harry said weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are siriusly welcome, my little cub," Sirius said with a teasing smile. Harry just shook his head before ending the call.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Want to go see the other schools off?" Neville asked curiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I already said my goodbyes to Viktor and Fleur. I already got how to owl them to where it's not blocked," Harry said weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright. Want to take a nap?" Harry nodded his head and Neville chuckled. "Want me to stay?" Another nod was his response and he chuckled as he wrapped his arms around Harry, making him freeze for about twenty seconds before he calmed down. "Alright." Neville responded before pulling the smaller male into his arms and passing out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The day they got on the train, Harry sat with Neville and Luna. Harry seemed relaxed and content just being around both of them. The ride seemed to go smoothly until the last hour or so. Ron and Hermione </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span> found him and both of them demanded to sit with him. Harry ignored them and cuddled Luna, who he was relaxing with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you two don't stop, I will have to request you leave. We are trying to relax." Neville said in a firm tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you going to do, Longbottom?" Ron asked in a tone that clearly screamed that he was superior to Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As a member and vassal to the House of Potter, Gran has taken custody of Harry," Neville said in a cold tone. "Your demands do nothing here and for once, Harry finally feels comfortable. Like bloody hell, I will allow you to ruin that," Neville growled out. "In fact, leave. You are no longer welcome in here." Before Ron and Hermione could protest, Neville got up and shoved them out before closing the door behind them. Locking it and warding the room, he sighed as he sat down. "So Harry, let's go over this again so I know what to tell Gran."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay," Harry said softly as he opened his eyes looking at Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You haven't gotten any bank statements about your accounts," Harry nodded his head. "You have never done an inheritance test before," Harry again nodded his head. "You haven't gone to Mungo's to get vaccinated." Harry nodded again, lowering his head. "You didn't know your father had any titles." Again Harry nodded although it was much weaker. "You didn't know about the vassal thing until I told you about it." Harry nodded his head weakly. "And you don't know how to carry yourself in society." Harry nodded his head weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harry, may I offer a suggestion?" Luna asked with her head tilted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What is it, Luna?" Harry asked weakly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My father owns the Quibbler. He was wanting to get an interview with one of the champions but Rita Skeeter took the spot for Reporter. I am sure if you want I can interview you and put your story out. It should surely clear up some issues that people have with you," Luna said with an airy tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nev?" Harry looked at the male worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It can't be anything but good at this point, Harry. The Lovegood family are a long term family friend to both of our houses. You can trust Luna." Neville said looking at Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded his head and looked at Luna. "W-When do you want to do this Luna?" He asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We can do it now if you want, Harry," Luna said calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes please," Harry said as he got comfortable. Luna nodded before going into her purse and pulling out her notepad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you wanting this to go, Harry? What do you want from this article release?" Luna asked calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I just...want everyone to understand, I guess," Harry said as he pulled his knees up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you wish to just release your whole life and let them decide?" Luna asked looking at Harry and then Neville.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you think Nev?" Harry asked looking at the other male.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think that would be the best option," Neville said with a nod.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed as he nodded, "Alright, it all started the day I was left on the doorstep of my aunt and uncle's house..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The train ride lasted for about another hour before the train pulled into the station. Neville stood up and cancelled the wards. He looked at Luna, "I'll owl you when you can publish that, Luna. It shouldn't be too long. We might even have more information for you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luna nodded her head, "It was a pleasure hanging out with you two. It's almost as if we are friends," Luna said with an airy tone. Harry stopped her before she could leave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Luna, we are friends...I mean... If you want to be, that is," Harry said hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luna smiled happily towards Harry. "See you this summer, Harry." She leaned over and kissed his cheek before skipping off to where she saw her father.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wonder what she meant by that," Harry said hesitantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, I see Gran..." Neville asked shocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You do?" Harry asked turning and looking at where Neville's grandmother was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville quickly grabbed Harry's arm and pulled him back. "Before you run off to escape the Dursleys, help me with the luggage."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right. Sorry, Neville." Harry said apologetically. Neville shook his head with a soft smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once they had their luggage, they made their way over to Augusta. "Hello, Gran. I brought Harry as I promised." Neville said in a polite tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come along boys, We have a meeting to get to. You'll see your fluffy friend there, Harry. Neville, did you get that information I asked you to get?" Augusta asked as she led both Neville and Harry down to an area they could use for travelling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I did, Gran. But it should be told in a private area." Neville suggested walking along with his grandmother but on the other side of Harry so the male was in the middle of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Augusta nodded her head and led both boys along. Once they got to the apparition spot, she offered a dog collar to both of them. Once they both grabbed, it Augusta cleared her throat and spoke loud and clear. "Chew toys," Harry snorted before they disappeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once they appeared at Gringotts in one of the private chambers, the two goblins bowed their heads. Augusta and Neville did as well before Harry's head was forced down by Neville's hand. Once they all stood up, Harry rubbed his neck as they started walking after the guards. "So Neville," Augusta prompted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harry knows essentially nothing, Gran. Weasley and Granger know that we have custody of Harry though." Neville stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This is upsetting. Harry," Harry quickly looked up at her nervously. Augusta saw this and she practically melted. "You're not in trouble. This isn't your fault. Will you be able to do the inheritance test and the medical exam today?" She asked looking at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yes," Harry said timidly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Augusta nodded her head and led them to an office. Letting the goblin announce her presence. They walked in and bowed again before Augusta spoke. "Ragnok, may all your enemies fall at your blade and may your gold ever flow," The goblin nodded in greeting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you here today for, Lady Longbottom," Ragnok asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My ward needs an inheritance test and a medical exam," Augusta said, looking at Ragnok.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If any shocking information is revealed, I suggest a lineage test," Ragnok said as he pulled out the items for both exams.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We should probably do that too," Augusta said looking at Ragnok and the Goblin nodded as he got the things out for that test too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once it was all out, Ragnok looked at Harry. "Come along. 3 drops for each goblet," he said, motioning to the three Goblets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded his head hesitantly and did as the goblin asked. Once the blood was in the goblets, Augusta healed the cut and Harry sat down next to Neville. Once the first test was done, Augusta picked it up and looked it over before handing it to Harry. "Do you wish to claim your Lordships later on? Between me and Sirius, we can teach you what needs to be done," Augusta stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry bit his lip before looking at the test.</span>

  <span>"Could we come back to the Lordships later? I...I don't feel comfortable being in charge of anything right now." Harry admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door opened and in strolled Sirius who looked so much better than the last time he saw the male. "Cub, you can always put someone as Regent while you are away. So how many houses do you have claim over?" Sirius said excitedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seven, or well six and I'm Heir to one," Harry said making Sirius sober up and hurry over. Looking it over he started chuckling before he full belly laugh. "This looked about right. Looks like Lady Magic favors you, Cub. Your mother did say she had some titles but she didn't flaunt them around. I'm Lord Black so it's natural that you can't claim it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So should I claim them, Sirius?" Harry asked nervously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You should. Augusta is actually your grandfather's sister on your father's side. So you know she will hold the Potter House standard. The Longbottoms have pretty much the same standard. It's why they become vassals to the Potter house," Sirius said with a chuckle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How did they decide that?" Harry asked confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well naturally they had a duel and your ancestor won," Sirius said looking at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh," Harry muttered before turning to Ragnok. "Um sir, I've invested into a business that's just starting. I've urged them to come to make an account with Gringotts and they said they would."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Names of the business owners?" Ragnok asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fred and George Weasley," Harry said looking at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I see it. How much did you give them?" Harry told him how much and Ragnok nodded his head "We shall call them in and get a contract drawn up. What do you wish to happen?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Harry could answer Sirius did, "At least one-third of the company should be his. He's basically funded them after all." He said in a firm tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Duly noted, Lord Black," Ragnok said writing it down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now let's move this meeting along. We can ask our questions after everything is looked over, alright." Sirius said looking at Harry who nodded. Augusta grabbed the next paper and she looked it over before giving it to Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can the goblins help us heal Heir Potter?" Augusta asked Ragnok.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They could. For a price." Ragnok said with a smirk. Harry took this time to look over the paper.</span>

  <span>"I have family that's not the Dursleys," was the first thing Harry said. Sirius didn't hesitate to wrap his arms around Harry and hugged him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shh Cub. I have you." Sirius said calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Who do I go to?" Harry whispered worriedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are still under my guardianship, Harry. No need to worry about that." Augusta said in a kind tone, instantly calming Harry down some.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I...I'm sorry," Harry muttered under his breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You’re fine, Cub," Sirius reassured as he held the small male in his arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Knowing what Harry probably needed at this moment, Neville spoke up. "So how are you going to heal Harry?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We have a couple of options. We can just heal him the normal way. Or we can do something experimental on our part. There is a ritual we can do along with a time chamber if there are things he needs to learn. He would be able to keep his memories, but we can revert his body to what it was like before he was attacked, remove all the binds, spells and scars before letting his age in the time chamber in a healing coma with one of our mind healers helping him heal his mind and teach him the things he needs to know until he is 14 yet again." Ragnok said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which one will have the best effect for what I want," Harry asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Probably the ritual. It will seem like a long time to you but it will be nothing more than an hour in regular time whereas the normal way would be forever." Ragnok explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How experimental is experimental?" Harry asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We did the same ritual on your godfather here," Ragnok said motioning to Sirius. "He came out fine. He was a little out of it but he came around."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at Augusta with a questioning look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's up to you, Harry. I won't make this choice for you. I'm here to guide you not tell you what you should and should not do. That's your godfather's job." Augusta stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I say do it, Pup. I felt so much better after I came to. Nothing hurts. I don't even feel the Dementor's presence anymore," Sirius said with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, I'll do it. Sirius...Could you look over the finances for me?" Harry asked hesitantly. "If it helps, I have only ever taken out 1,000 Galleons. And I only authorized Moony to take any money out," Harry rambled off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I got it, Pup. You go heal. Have them teach you Japanese as well. It will be useful in Japan," Sirius said in a teasing tone before kissing Harry's forehead. Harry nodded and walked off with one of the goblins. Sirius looked at Ragnok, "Can I have the account folders?" Ragnok nodded his head and handed Sirius the folders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius picked up the oldest folders which happened to be the founder's folders. He picked up Slytherin's folder before he looked over the file and sighed softly before grabbing a quill and started to circle things that didn't look right to him. Setting that folder aside since he wasn't sure what Harry wanted to do about Voldemort just yet, he then turned his attention to the Gryffindor one. He quickly went through it before placing it on the desk. He did the same with Ravenclaw and the Peverell files as well. Picking up the Potter Folder, he sighed as he looked at the folder. He remembered a lot of the transactions because of the last time he had helped James catch everything up. Yes, James had let him help get the accounts back in order before they went into hiding. James wanted things simplified just in case they did end up dying. It was one of the smartest moves Sirius could say was all James's idea. Opening the folder, he paused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something wrong, Lord Black?" Ragnok asked looking at Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No. Nothing wrong." Sirius said as he caressed a spot in the folder. Neville got curious and looked over his shoulder</span>

  <span>Neville saw his and Luna's names and he blinked confusedly. "S-Sirius, why are Luna and I on the front page of this. Isn't it only reserved for families?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius chuckled, "Well you see Neville, James being the Head of House, accepted Frank, Alice, Pandora and Xeno into his family. Thus making you and Luna cousins of Harry's," Sirius stated. "Your father was protective over his own and your parents and Luna's parents proved time and time again they were always in our corner. Thus, when he adopted the Marauders he adopted them too." Sirius muttered as his mind looked over the first page. Harry had a lot of work to do to properly get the House of Potter back to the way it was. Sirius shook his head and focused. Once he found where he and James had left off, he started to look at the newer transactions and he growled. "Dumbledore is barred from the Potter Accounts. In fact!" Sirius stood up and started to pace around the office before looking at Augusta. "I, Sirius Orion Black, Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, hereby decree Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore an enemy of the House of Black, so mote it be!" Magic swirled around the office but Sirius wasn't done yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, Sirius Orion Black, hereby banish Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore from any and all properties of the House of Black, so mote it be!" Again, magic swirled around the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, Sirius Orion Black, hereby Ban Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore from all business of the House of Black, so mote it be!" Magic started to swirl violently reacting to Sirius's own magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, Sirius Orion Black, hereby lay claim to Harry James Potter as his Magical Guardian, so mote it be!" Magic seemed to slowly start calming down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, Sirius Orion Black, hereby ask Lady Magic to judge this illegal marriage between Harry James Potter and Ginevra Weasley and to punish the people involved of their wrongdoing, so mote it be!" Sirius sat down once he was done panting the magic swirling around lazily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-" Sirius tensed looking at Augusta who seemed to just have a soft smile on her face, "Approve of what you just did, Sirius." Sirius relaxed hearing Augusta giggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was so worried you would negate my claim to Harry," Sirius whined to the elder female.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I can clearly tell he trusts you, Sirius," Augusta stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gran, could Sirius and Remus come along with us to Japan?" Neville asked hesitantly.</span>
