    <p>“Okay, Dray! ‘S your turn.” Harry watches as Blaise slurs messily, throwing a flushed arm over Luna’s shoulder. “Tell us something you've never told anyone before.”</p><p>The outline of Harry's faded, lighting scar is illuminated in the dim light as he throws his head back and guffaws, “Oh please! You know Draco couldn't keep a secret to save his life.”</p><p>"Just because you see an open book, doesn’t mean that’s all there is to see, Potter,” Draco says sharply, pointing a slender finger towards him. He then lifts his elbow onto the sticky bar table and scratches his chin. “Now, let’s see. Oh! Well er… it's been a while but… should I tell them?” The blond turns his head to the left, lifting an eyebrow to the redhead sitting next to him.</p><p>“What's Ron got to do with this?” Ginny asks before consequently downing the rest of Blaise’s Firewhiskey. It’s because he's more drunk than anyone else at the booth anyway, Harry supposes.</p><p>Ron looks looks around for Hermione, who’s taking her time in the restroom, and shrugs helplessly. Despite his doubt in his blond friend’s inability to keep a secret, Harry cocks his head and listens on inquisitively.</p><p>“Well it's kind of <i>our </i>secret, if you catch my drift.” The redhead explains.</p><p>Their table falls silent; bustling sounds of comradery and the sharp, sweet scent of alcohol fill the old tavern around them. Draco absently brushes a but of invisible lint from his deep blue robes.</p><p>“Weasley and I dated during our eighth year.”</p><p>A mouthload of rum sprays the already viscid bar. Pansy squeals, “Harry!” before standing, arms akimbo, petulantly pulling a lip.</p><p>“You two? Dating?!” He exclaims, confounded.</p><p>Ron beckons a waiter to vanish the mess and refill all of their glasses. He speaks as he busies himself with handing out the drinks. </p><p>“Er, yeah. We did.” He responds, “We kept it secret because, well, we’re us, mate. It's one of the reasons I pushed you guys to give Draco a chance. I think it started right after the battle, ‘idn't it?”</p><p>Draco scoffs, taking his vodka martini, “I'd be offended that you forgot the start of our year-long relationship but, honestly, what am I supposed to expect from you?” He takes a savouring sip of the drink, sanctimonious in a way only he could.</p><p>The edge of his lips curl up slightly, but of course he's always found Ron’s antics amusing. Now Harry just has context as to why. The knowledge makes the inside of Harry’s mouth sour.</p><p>It's the rum, he tells himself.</p><p>“No, we first started talking after the battle,” Draco continues, “I<i> was </i>looking for Harry, but I found Ron instead. I guess Fred had… and Hermione…”</p><p>Harry’s heart sinks at the mention of the battle, of all that happened. He buries his nose is his third rum and inhales the sharp, spicy scent that intoxicated all of his post-war memories. The glass slides discreetly across the table.</p><p>“I didn't know you were that torn up when Hermione rejected you, Ron.” Luna says, doughy eyed. The Slytherin sitting next to her slips an odd, red something in a glass into her cupped hands.</p><p>“How could I not be? I left and came back because of her. I was absolutely in love with ‘er. Then Draco showed up…”</p><p>The blond snorts into his drink and waves a hand over his collarbone purposefully while everyone in attendance listens raptly, “He collapsed on my shoulder and cried for like hours.”</p><p>“I did not!” Ron squawks indignantly.</p><p>“Did too. You were all awkward during the reconstruction, too.”</p><p>“W- w- bu-” Ron splutters. “Well, it was embarrassing!”</p><p>Draco snickers apathetically.</p><p>“I'm sorry!” Harry says, throwing his hands in the air, “But am I the only who thinks this is completely bonk-”</p><p>“-So when <i>did</i> you two start dating?”</p><p>Harry drops his head on the table, nearly spilling a drink into his matted hair.</p><p>“I think around September of that year?” Draco contemplates, “Let's see, Weaselbee asked me to help him study because Hermione wouldn't, but when the time came and I refused to just do it for him he got mad, yelled at me, and then kissed me.”</p><p>“Kinky.”</p><p>Ron turns a bit pink, looking back and the restroom door again, “Shut up, Ginny. It wasn't like you think. He was just kind of… <i>there.</i>”</p><p>“Nice description,” Draco glares, “I'll remember that the next time I reminisce upon our relationship. ‘He was just… there’ ”</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Do I?”</p><p>“Well, yeah. I couldn't stop thinking about you after the battle and then everything that happened during the reconstruction-”</p><p>“-a Lot of talking”</p><p>“And then you were just… there. After all that time.”</p><p>“It wasn't that long a time.” the blond mutters.</p><p>“It felt like forever” Ron runs a hand through his hair. The ice in his drink clinks against the glass.</p><p>“Then why’d you break up?” Luna asks. Ginny and Blaise take each of her hands into theirs. Despite her being very sweet, Harry notices that Luna still does tend to ignore certain social cues.</p><p>Draco shifts uncomfortably in his seat as if pondering the least offensive way to place his two cents. “We just… didn't work out. We were madly in love when it began but Ron wasn't completely over Hermione, no matter how much he insisted that he was, and by the end of the year he realized he still had feelings for her and I didn't feel anything real for him.”</p><p>Ron frowns and leans forward, his fringe falling over his eyes, “Hey, don’t say that. I was over her, at first. Then stuff happened.There were bad circumstances. Hermione was with her parents and she was always so distressed. And she went to Harry, and that just… I am not drunk enough for this.” he laughs deprecatingly, downing his drink.</p><p>“And we- uh- never really got to...” Draco makes a suggestive hand gesture, attempting lightening the mood, Harry thinks, “That kind of puts a damper on things”</p><p>Pansy snickers loudly, earning a glare from Ron, “How would you even get around to do that?”</p><p>Harry shoots Ron an accusing look as he side-eyes him under hooded lids. “Er, I kind of stole your invisibility cloak, mate. Draco was all in shock, talking about how he knew there was something because you're too much of a bumbling Gryffindor to get anything done on your own.”</p><p>Shivers running up and down his clothed arms, Harry thinks back to all the time spent searching for that damned cloak eighth year. All that when in reality his <i>best friend</i> stole it to go shag Draco sodding Malfoy. The taste in his mouth is so revolting he thinks he might puke.</p><p>Draco stretches his hand across the table, “Oh darling, you remembered.”</p><p>Ron lays a hand over his, “Well how could I forget? You only complained the whole night long.” Ginny slaps his arm and he retracts as Hermione approaches the table, a butterbeer in hand. Harry releases a hot breath he didn't realize he was holding.</p><p>“What’d I miss?” the glassy-eyed girl asks, pulling down her skirt and slipping in next to Ron.</p><p>Draco sniggers, “Your boyfriend is a bottom.”</p><p>“What?! <i>You </i>were the power bottom!”</p><p>Hermione grips Ron’s arm tightly, “I'm sorry, what?!” The redhead’s cheek’s tinge pink as he promises Hermione a ‘later’, but Draco seems relatively unruffled. Ginny mutters something about ‘trouble’.</p><p>“Key word ‘power’,” Draco smirks, annoyingly coy, “Just because you wanted to be shagged and I wouldn't do it does not mean you can insult me for it.”</p><p>Harry’s sure he’ll sick-up now.</p><p>“And with that we’d better be off,” Hermione stands abruptly, rubbing her temples and walking to the nearest exit. Ron smiles impishly and waves the gang off.</p><p>“Next Friday,” he promises, Blaise and Ginny wolf-whistling after him. </p><p>“Okay, why is nobody as freaked out as I am?” Harry demands a few minutes later as their conversation lulls unto a rut. “This is bloody fucking weird! I never wanted to know that much about my best friends.” </p><p>Draco takes another sip from his drink, “Calm down, Potty. Why are you so freaked out, anyway It's not the craziest thing in the world, you know. I thought we were being obvious, what with Ron’s sudden obsession with me.”</p><p>Harry looks into the blond’s deep grey eyes as they narrow with suspicion. The world blurs out around them. He shakes his head and turns away, massaging his neck.</p><p>“Er, I think I've just drank too much. I'd better go.” He whispers. Draco stares after him as he leaves.</p><p>“Well don't splinch yourself, bloody ponce…” his pale eyebrows knit together.</p><p>When he turns back around three out of the five at the table are caught in their own events while Pansy is giving her full attention to her friend.</p><p>“What?” he demands. The girl shakes her head, chuckling.</p><p>“Nothing, Draco.”</p>
