That perhaps if the war hadn't been looming over our heads, if the world was still the same world in which we argued like cat and dog, I wouldn't have succumbed to temptations. Maybe I'd have taken up a hobby instead - I've always fancied myself an excellent public speaker. I could've stood up for a few good causes, had my name splashed across every front page in England <em>just</em> to irritate him. I certainly, most definitely, would not have found myself running around killing off pieces of a madman's soul in an effort to rid the world of him for good. </p><p>Except, that's just what I did. Spent a whole summer, best part of a year, apparating from place to place. Searching for randomly dis-guarded soul parts and listening to Ronald Weasley's crappy radio. It didn't happen on purpose, obviously. It's not as if I <em>threw</em> myself at them that night of the wedding. Merlin forbid, I have <em>some</em> dignity. We camped out in woods most of the time (I <em>hate</em> the woods, if you didn't know, and yet I didn't complain once: medal, please?) and wondered <em>what the hell</em> we were doing with ourselves, but it was plenty better than spending the year at the manor. At the end of it all: the war, the running, the fighting: they gave me an Order of Merlin, so I suppose the dirty woods were worth it. Do you know how easy it is to get free gift baskets from <em>all</em> the best places when you own an <em>Order of Merlin</em>? First Class, no less. </p><p>Of course it couldn't just stop there. Life would be <em>far</em> too easy if it had just stopped where everything was<em> finally</em> working out for me. </p><p>Lily and James Potter popped up. Yes, you read that right, <em>Lily and James Potter</em>. <em>Long</em> dead parents of the one, the only, Harry James Potter. Turns out they'd been hiding away in Australia somewhere with orders from Dumbledore to stay hidden. Merlin knows why, I never found the time to ask, but the papers say they thought it in Harry's best interest. </p><p>Harry did <em>not</em> find it was in his best interest. Harry was pissed, more pissed than I have ever had the privilege of seeing in all the years we've been at each others' throats. It was a right treat to watch him flip out at someone else for a change. The only person who was possibly more mad about the whole thing was Molly Weasley; who couldn't, and still can't, for the life of her understand why any parent would thrust that kind of pain on their child. Remus Lupin was terribly, terribly hurt by the entire ordeal.</p><p>It only escalated when the Potter's dragged Sirius Black out of hiding too. </p><p>Merlin almighty, the fit Harry threw over that is one I shall relive for the rest of my days. Finally he grew a backbone and told them all to go fuck themselves. Hallelujah. </p><p>It was this event that tipped the iceberg and damned us all to a sinking ship. Harry Potter went on a week long pub crawl before the inevitable happened. </p><p>He found his way into my bed. Yes, my bed. I am well aware of the implications that has, and I encourage you to bestow yourself with the knowledge that Harry Potter and I indeed had a tumble in between the sheets. He had been in one of his rare sober states, his mother had come to visit again, insisting that they have a conversation and I kid you not when I tell you that his reply was '<em>I'm a little busy right now, Lily, Draco and I would like to be left alone</em>'. I know! The nerve of the guy! I'd had half a mind to yell at him, even if it had gotten me kicked out of his house, but he'd made good on his accusation soon enough. </p><p>So, that is how I ended up still here, in Grimmauld Place, almost two years later. No war, no fighting, no life threatening situations - just the book on my lap, the coffee in my hand, and a nice warm blanket to keep out the cold. It's homely, much more homely than the manor ever was - especially after all the remodelling. Courtesy of me. Who else could have such taste? Really, though, the living room looks so much better with the cream marble fireplace. It's a beautiful piece, I couldn't pass it up. It squares out the rough edges of the old fireplace without having to get rid of the structure. The same log pit sits in it, but the surrounding décor is completely different. The marble makes the fireplace seem moderner, all the while keeping the traditional sense to it. An ingenious idea on my part, truly. The flat-topped surface of it leaves room for photo frames and glass sets. There's a splendid set of glass candles on the left hand side of it and a few photo frames with pictures of Granger, Weasley, Harry himself and I in them on the other side. </p><p>Obviously changing the fireplace meant I had to have the walls repainted too. Gone are the days filled with peeling wallpaper and damp smells. A lovely <em>repose grey</em> paint decorates the walls of the living room instead, bringing out the cream in the marble fireplace. The new paint called for new bookshelves (you absolutely <em>cannot</em> have <em>pine oak</em> bookshelves with <em>repose grey</em> walls): the old ones were quickly replaced with this wonderful pair of rustic cream bookshelves that push against the far wall, either side of the door, and have no back to them. It's a great design, allowing the wall behind it to bring colour to the bookshelves. </p><p>The sofas followed. Honestly, the previous sofas stank of wet dog and had endless amounts of animal hairs woven into the seams of the leather. They were horrid. I replaced them with a small, light grey corner sofa that sits a few feet away from the door, over by the window and two light grey arm chairs to match. All three pieces of furniture have cream cushions placed in the corners. They're fabric, as well: none of that leather crap the Black's clearly favoured. In the middle of all three of the seating there's a nice, marble-topped coffee table. </p><p>The curtains were swapped from the dreary drats that'd been there for centuries to a floor length grey pair. All the skirting boards were glossed over in white and Kreacher now cleans the chandelier twice a week. Honestly, for people with a wide fortune you'd have expected them to have made these changes years ago, wouldn't you? Anyone with taste could have told you the house needed updating. </p><p>As you can probably tell, I had a lot of fun redecorating, which is most likely why I redecorated the whole house instead of just that one room. Yes! I'm an addict! I'm aware. It's a deep, dark secret I shall take with me to the grave. The results really are fantastic though, and I have a brilliant excuse! </p><p>I had to baby proof <em>everything</em>. It was a nightmare. Who knew the Black's were so fond of their booby traps? Not me, that's for sure. It took me months to trap-free the house in order to prepare it for a baby. </p><p>And that brings me to the final, vital inkling of information to round off my horridly bad luck. That little '<em>Draco and I would like to be left alone</em>' turned into a week full of fucking that left me up the duff. <em>Me</em>! Of all people! I don't regret it of course, how could I? My beautiful son hasn't a flaw on his whole being and I fell in love with the little brat the moment I held him in my arms. </p><p>So that gives me the beautiful baby, the wonderful home, and the everlasting comfortability you'd expect for a war hero such as myself. What else is missing?</p><p>Other than, you know, <em>Harry fucking Potter</em>. The guy gets the shock of his life (what with his parents - and Sirius Black - <em>not</em> being dead and all), drinks his way through England, sleeps with his childhood rival, and then fucks off to who knows where to do who knows what. </p><p>Typical. </p><p> </p>
