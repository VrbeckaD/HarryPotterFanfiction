  <em>Gryffindor Common Room<br/>Friday 1<sup>st</sup> May 1992</em>
</p><p>“Listen to me, Harry,” said Ron Weasley, smugly “I’m undefeated for almost an entire school year. It’s simple really. I’m a chess master.”</p><p>Harry sighed as he repositioned the pieces for another game. He’d spent the better part of the year getting comprehensively trounced by Ron, although he was at least in the good company as everyone that had challenged his red-headed friend had suffered the same outcome.</p><p>“In fact,” Ron continued, really getting into his stride, “I bet you I remain undefeated for the entire time we’re in Hogwarts.”</p><p>Harry paused as he went to replace the black Knight, instead choosing to roll it between his palms. He looked up at the self-satisfied expression on Ron’s face. “What are you betting?”</p><p>Ron pondered this for a moment. “Well, how about whoever beats me can set a forfeit that I <em>have</em> to do. In fact…” he stood and cleared his throat, before addressing the packed common room pompously. “Oi! Listen up! I hereby declare that if anyone beats me at chess before I leave Hogwarts, I’ll do any forfeit of their choosing.”</p><p>“<em>Any</em> forfeit? You’re that confident ickle-Ronniekins?” Fred shouted back from the other side of the room.</p><p>“What can I say?” Ron replied arrogantly. “I’ve spent the year pummelling anyone that’s taken me on. I see no reason why that’s not going to continue for the next six years.” He dropped back into his seat, looking very pleased with himself.</p><p>Harry shared a glance with Hermione who shook her head and returned her concentration to her book. He offered his hands to Ron, a different coloured pawn secreted in each fist and spoke. “Your choice.”</p><hr/><p>

</p><p>“Checkmate,” Ron smirked over the board at Dean Thomas, who stood up and wandered off to talk to Sheamus. “That’s 3127 games in a row.”</p><p>“Are you honestly still counting Ronald?” Hermione said, looking up from the table she was sharing with Harry and taking a break from her Potions essay.</p><p>“Of course! Undefeated in almost 5 years of school – why wouldn’t I be counting?” Ron reset the board. “Harry – you playing?”</p><p>Harry sighed and pushed his essay aside. “Hermione – would you mind?” he pointed his quill at his essay, asking his friend to proof-read and smiled in thanks as she pulled the parchment toward her. “Come on then, let’s get this over with.”</p><p>“I’m feeling generous tonight Harry. You can start.” Ron turned the board so the white pieces were in front of Harry and sat back, awaiting the first move.</p><p>After 15 minutes Harry was surprised to find he was still in the game. He looked over at Ron who was smiling complacently and he realised he was being toyed with – Ron was deliberately stretching the game out to make his inevitable victory that much sweeter.</p><p>“Here you go Harry,” Hermione said. “It looks good, I’ve made a few minor corrections but it should get you an Exceeds anyway.”</p><p>“Yeah right,” scoffed Harry. “As if Snape is going to score a piece of my work that highly.”</p><p>“Honestly Harry. <em>Professor </em>Snape.”</p><p>Harry grinned at her sheepishly. “Thanks, Hermione. You’re a lifesaver.”</p><p>Hermione sighed, rolled up her own essay and dropped down into the chair next to Harry to watch the remainder of the game.</p><p>10 minutes later, Ron had decided he’d allowed the game to go on for long enough. “Oh Harry,” he said after his friend had played yet another seemingly random move. “Have you learnt nothing from me after all these years?” He looked around the common room, pitching his voice so everyone close by could hear. “I guess this’ll just have to be win number 3128.” Ron reached his hand toward the board but stopped suddenly, peering down at the pieces.</p><p>“Ermm… Harry.” Hermione said, sitting forward abruptly. “Isn’t that checkmate?”</p><p>Ron sat stationary as a rush of people joined them around the board. “Fred!” called George excitedly. “It’s happened!”</p><p>“The reign of Weasley is over!” Fred announced to the surrounding masses. “Long live King Potter!” A small party broke out behind the players consisting of everyone that had taken a pasting at the hands of the youngest Weasley son – in essence, the whole occupancy of Gryffindor tower.</p><p>Ron, who had turned a funny shade of puce, was muttering to himself and staring at the board in disbelief. He slowly looked up at Harry who appeared bemused by the entire proceeding but had his hand out ready to shake. “Good game mate.” Harry said.</p><p>“But… what…” Ron stammered, flicking his gaze between the board and Harry’s hand. “<em>HOW?”</em></p><p>“No idea.” Harry beamed. “Nevermind though, I had to get lucky eventually.”</p><p>Ron finally reached over and shook Harry’s hand. “Yeah… well then… I’m just gonna go to bed.”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Hermione spoke firmly enough that the party initiated by Harry’s victory stopped unexpectedly as the participants waited to hear what she had to say.</p><p>“1<sup>st</sup> May 1992.” She began, looking directly at Ron. “You stood up in front of the entire common room and announced that if anyone beat you at chess before you left Hogwarts, you would do any forfeit of their choosing.”</p><p>“Yeah, but Herms,” Ron began “That was 4 years ago. You can’t hold me to that…”</p><p>“For the last time Ronald, my name is Hermione – not Herms, not Hermy, <em>Hermione.</em>” She glared at the red-head who was currently trying to make himself as small as possible under her stare. “You aren’t going to let the whole school think you’re backing out are you?”</p><p>“You’re not chicken are you, Ron?” Fred piped up.</p><p>“Actually,” George interrupted, “we’ve got a product in the works that will turn you into a chicken – maybe we can name it after ickle-Ronnikins if he doesn’t see this through. Immortalised for all to see!”</p><p>“Alright!” Ron glowered. “Name the forfeit Harry.”</p><p>Harry glanced over at Hermione and jerked his head at a corner of the room. They made their way over together and, upon arrival, Hermione placed a silencing charm around them. The entire common room watched with bated breath as the pair’s conversation went back and forth before a nod of agreement saw the charm dropped and the pair retake their seats in front of Ron.</p><p>“Well?” He said, anxiously. “What am I going to be doing?”</p><p>Harry grinned at Hermione who smirked back. “As we’re almost at the end of the school year, we thought it only fair that those outgoing students – “ Harry nodded now at the Weasley twins and the other seventh year students “- get to witness this. So before the end of the school year…” Harry paused for dramatic effect.</p><p>“Oh come on!” Ron shouted. “Just tell me!”</p><p>“You have to kick Professor Snape up the arse.”</p>
