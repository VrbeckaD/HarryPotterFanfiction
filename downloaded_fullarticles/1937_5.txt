    <p> </p><p>“Fortescue’s! We can’t go to Diagon Alley without going to Fortescue’s!”</p><p>“Klaus-”</p><p>“I thought you were traditional. This is breaking tradition!” Klaus draped dramatically in the doorway, blocking the group from leaving, though they both knew Luther could easily move him. The shop was a crowded little place just off Diagon Alley, with two windows looking out onto bustling streets. It was toned in dark brown wood with touches of a caramel-colored paint and filled by long, wide, booths. They were even big enough to fit all seven of the Hargreeves children.</p><p>Luther gave a heavy sigh, looking around to see Ben quietly cheering, “Ice cream! Ice cream!” Reginald had sent them off alone, with only Luther in charge (Mom wasn’t allowed to leave the house, Pogo would be a fright in public, Reginald couldn’t be bothered to chaperone them himself), and of course, Luther took his job far too seriously. Well, at least in Klaus’ opinion.</p><p>“Allison needs a new owl,” Luther said. Klaus stood his ground.</p><p>“Do you think she’s going to get kidnapped on her way to the shop by sea-faring criminals? Swept away in the two seconds she’s out of your sight? We are <em> feminists </em> in this household!” The rest of their siblings weren’t even paying any attention, not bothered by the holdup as they went back and forth betting on Quidditch teams. Diego was betting a Galleon on the Chudley Cannons, which was utterly ridiculous, and Five was happy to tell him so.</p><p>“I don’t know, Klaus,” Ben said, the only one listening in on their debate. “Pirates are a real threat around here. Did you hear about the parrot kidnapped while their owner was buying quills-”</p><p>“Are you going to disappear on me?” Luther cut in. Klaus could sense that he was giving up.</p><p>“No!” Ben chorused with him.</p><p>Klaus’ protest was ruined by a family of redheads entering behind him, piling into the shop one after another. He swung out of the way, letting them march past him and weave between their own group. “Look at how we’re inconveniencing these poor families just trying to get their food,” Klaus said.</p><p>Klaus looked at Luther, Luther looked at him, Klaus stared, Luther stared- “Fine,” Luther conceded. It was met by cheers. Only from Ben and Klaus, but still, cheers.</p><p>They had just finished their lunch and everyone was eager to start checking off items on their lists. And with seven of them all trying to get their own supplies, it was bound to be chaos no matter what Luther tried. He seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Klaus, because he called all the group’s numbers out until they all looked at him.</p><p>“You all have twenty minutes to get whatever only you need, then we’re meeting up outside of the Emporium so we can get quills and textbooks together,” Luther said. His siblings nodded their assent.</p><p>“Ben, don’t forget your bag- and Diego, you left your knife stuck in the table,” Klaus added, sparing a moment to mother-hen them. Ben and Diego darted back to the table to collect their things while the others rushed out the door, making their own personal blob on the street. “Geez, we take up the entire Alley.”</p><p>“Hmm, better get out of the way, then,” Ben said, holding up his bag as he returned. “Do you think Fortescue’s is a sufficient destination?”</p><p>“Why, of course.” Klaus grinned, swinging open the door and calling over his shoulder. “Thanks for lunch, Gerry!”</p><p>Diego brushed past them without a word, disappearing into the crowd. The air outside was rather stifling, considering that they were forced to wear their ‘Umbrella Academy’ uniforms all the time. It was ridiculous, really, because since they’d enrolled at Hogwarts most of their learning came from the actual institution rather than Reginald Hargreeves’ power-training.</p><p>Ben slung his bag across his body, stuffing his blazer into it as they turned towards Fortescue’s. “Gerry? You know that’s not his name, right?”</p><p>Klaus laughed. “Right, right, we just have a thing going, Georg and I. It’s all in good fun! I like to keep him on his toes.”</p><p>Ben shook his head. “Whatever you say, Kevin.”</p><p>“Thanks, Brett.” They continued going back-and-forth on their way to the ice cream shop, then through the first ten minutes of the wait. It was the weekend, the only day they were allowed time off from training, which also meant they had landed in the middle of the busiest day of the week. Klaus watched little Pureblood brats run by, noses in the air. Of course, three of his own siblings were Purebloods as well, but they were Luther, Allison, and Five, which made perfect sense to him. “How long is this going to take!” Klaus dragged out the last word as long as he could in one breath.</p><p>“Longer if you think about it too much,” Ben said, reaching up to rap his knuckles on Klaus’ head. “Wastes brain cells, you know, and I don’t think you can afford that.”</p><p>Klaus wrinkled his nose, but resolved to pout, leaning back and forth to look up the line. Too many eleven-year-olds around. He remembered his own first year- it’d been a shock, really. They’d universally believed that there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell Reggie would let them go. Born and immediately gained, they’d never known life outside of the Umbrella Academy. Klaus had gotten ahold of one of the many letters sent to them, stuffed it into his shorts and ran out onto the front lawn to read it.</p><p>Hogwarts. . .it had seemed too good to be true. Not to mention completely fantastical- all made up. But then, they all had powers beyond the ordinary, so it wasn’t such an impossible thing to believe. When he told the others about the school, a school for kids just like them (though they weren’t, not exactly, as he had learned), they agreed it was a dream that would never come true. It was only when a large, friendly, man had come pounding on their door that they tasted freedom.</p><p>Another set of uniforms, another set of training, but with so much more freedom to be themselves. And that was all Klaus had ever wanted- to be himself and. . .to love who he loved. If Reggie knew about his little crush, he’d find a way to get approved for homeschooling, and Klaus would never see the light of day again. He didn’t like to think about that. Better was the thought that as long as he kept everything inside his own mind and heart, he’d stay in the Wizarding World. He’d stay where charms could keep the ghosts at bay, where there were people just as strange as him.</p><p>“Oh, hey guys.” Klaus almost didn’t recognize Hazel’s voice. It’d gotten even deeper over the summer. He froze in place, knowing full well that wherever Hazel was, his whole crew was rarely far behind. They went everywhere together- to meals, to the library, to Hogsmeade. . .to Diagon Alley. . . Klaus took a deep breath, steeling himself against whoever was going to be there.</p><p>“Agnes!” Ben exclaimed. Klaus finally turned around, seeing Ben practically jumping into Agnes’ arms and babbling into her shoulder. “How was your summer? Mine was great- hectic, but great- what did you do?”</p><p>Agnes giggled, hugging Ben back and throwing a friendly wink Klaus’ way. She was a dainty girl, with bright blonde hair and even brighter blue eyes. A little badger was pinned to the collar of her shirt, a moniker almost as ever-present as her smile. “Oh, mine was wonderful. I wish you could’ve come to that picture with us, it would’ve made things even better.”</p><p>“Picture?” Klaus said, ungracefully as <em> always </em>because Ben winced in return.</p><p>Hazel- a boy taller and larger than Klaus, but far sweeter- gave an understanding smile, wrapping an arm around Agnes’ shoulders when Ben finally released her. “It’s alright,” he said amiably. “We know you’ve got a big family and a lot going on. I read it in the Daily Prophet! Everything you did in Romania.”</p><p>“Fascinating!” Agnes continued, “I mean, between seeing a picture and getting to live one of them. I know what I’d choose- I mean, dragons! Catching rogue dragons. . .that’s what they should be making pictures about.”</p><p>Klaus looked between Hazel and Agnes, who were acting unreasonably friendly about whatever topic Klaus didn’t know they were talking about. He felt a tap on his elbow and stepped up in the line accordingly, waiting for Ben to make eye contact with him. “You were invited too, Klaus. They were going to see a muggle movie in London. I just didn’t want to tell you only for you to know we couldn’t go. . .”</p><p>“Because of dear old daddy,” Klaus finished. Ben nodded grimly.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Hazel said, but Klaus hated pity.</p><p>He clapped his hands, letting his arm brush against Ben for some small comfort while he changed the topic. “What brings you both to Fortescue’s? Taking a break from buying all those golden gobstones? You know, I tried using some of that gold wax they sell now instead of shaving- let me tell you, biggest mistake of my-”</p><p>“Hey, Klaus.” His existence was a curse- a crime against humanity- why did he have to be born? Was it necessary? Was it <em> really? </em>There were a thousand other ways this could’ve gone- more than a thousand. An infinity of other gene combinations and parents and situations, so why did it have to be him? Gangly, rambly, Klaus whose parents sold him off to some rich old squib, and for what? Only for him to be standing in Diagon Alley a month before the start of term, staring his impending doom in the face. He’d never see the front end of sixteen.</p><p>“Da-aaave!” Klaus greeted, voice high and tight. He cleared his throat. “I wasn’t expecting to see you here!” It didn’t help.</p><p>Ben gave him an odd sideways look, one eyebrow twitching upwards. Mission. ABORT. They moved one measly step up in line. There were still four people trapping him in. At least they’d made it into the actual shop, in an air-conditioned or somehow magically regulated room with wide, sun-letting windows and minty blue walls. Klaus finally chanced a look at Dave, at least relieved that the boy was also exchanging pleasantries with Hazel and Agnes.</p><p>“-I did! We should go again next summer-” Dave wrapped up what he’d been saying to Agnes, and all too soon his eyes were on Klaus again. “-You didn’t answer my letters.” Damn those Gryffindors. Always straight to the point. “Are you alright? I was getting a bit worried-”</p><p>“We all told him you were fine,” Agnes said, shaking her head fondly. “Dave, you know the Hargreeves family always have a lot going on.”</p><p>“I’m sure Klaus didn’t mean to ignore you,” Hazel assured him.</p><p>Klaus narrowed his eyes. “Can I <em> please </em>speak for myself?” Dave had an earnest look in his eyes that made Klaus’ gut twist. Dear Reginald didn’t let them send out owls, and though there were certainly ways around it, if he was being honest with himself. . .he didn’t want to answer. He’d been holding onto some fleeting hope that if he tried to cut off contact and block Dave from his mind, just for the summer, those butterflies would eventually find another home. Realize that he didn’t want them, thank you very much, and that someone like Allison would be perfectly happy to take them on instead!</p><p>“I get it,” Dave said.</p><p>“Look, I’m <em> sorry-” </em></p><p>“No, seriously, Klaus-”</p><p>“I just couldn’t answer! I couldn’t. It’s not allowed,” Klaus said, flapping his hands around in a physical representation of his floundering. He forced them down to his sides. Klaus opened his mouth. . .then closed it again. . .then- oh, he just didn’t know what to say. Especially with those. Puppy. Eyes. Dave was a problem, a real problem, and he needed to stop!</p><p>“Our father’s very strict,” Ben picked up. “We can receive letters, but unless it’s coming from the Ministry of Magic, we’re not allowed to send anything back.” The moment he stopped talking, Klaus noticed how quiet it suddenly felt.</p><p>There had been a little bubble around them where they had been carrying on separate from all the other groups, but now there was only everyone else’s bubble and the silence in between. Klaus wasn’t even concerned in the slightest about the other crew knowing about their father’s rules. That was a secondary problem, because now that Klaus had said it, out loud, put it in the air, there was simply no way Ben <em> didn’t </em>know that Klaus had deliberately been abiding by the rules to not owl Dave- because when had he ever done that? Every one of them, even great and mighty stick-up-his-arse-half-the-time Luther had the other side of him that snuck out to send letters.</p><p>And he knew this for certain, because Klaus had gone with Allison to steal their neighbour’s owl before, and Allison often went with Luther. He was apparently diligent in responding to every letter his Hufflepuff friends sent. . .so, back to the matter at hand. There was no way Ben didn’t know, which means he’d sleuth out the reason why, and any of the siblings knowing was a terrible, terrible, idea because none of them could keep a damn secret. Klaus was not ashamed to say that ‘none of them’ included himself. He would absolutely fess out everything if Ben kept asking, and that was just the truth of the matter. Plus, Ben was just as much a master of the puppy eyes as Dave.</p><p>So that meant that Ben was going to know, then the whole of the Hargreeves family, and that put him at a much higher risk for Dave finding out- and basically, it was going to be a mess. <em> And </em> Agnes was looking sad- sad! Agnes, sad! It was straight-up unnatural (not that many things were <em> straight </em> about his life, which made this quite the oddity). The silence had been weighing down on them for far too long, and silence made Klaus ramble- either externally or internally.</p><p>“The celebrity life,” Agnes said finally. Her voice was a forced sort of chipper, but it worked. “Hey, isn’t the full family supposed to be here?”</p><p>“Mmm, Luther says he’s <em> ‘too old for that’ </em>,” Klaus drawled.</p><p>Agnes giggled. “That sounds like him.” The safe little bubble returned.</p><p>“It’s great to see you,” Ben said slowly, smiling as Dave bumped his shoulder in greeting. Klaus watched something shift in Ben’s expression. “Actually, I didn’t know you were friends with Klaus. Funny he never mentioned that you two knew each other-”</p><p>Klaus jabbed an elbow into Ben’s side, ignoring his squawk of protest. “Big family. Seven people! A lot going on. Besides, Dave and I aren’t <em> that </em>close.”</p><p>Dave gave him a funny look. “Right,” he said. Klaus flinched internally.</p><p>“Not that I don’t like you, you’re great- you’re great! The cherry on top of my chocolate milkshake!” At least that last bit made Dave laugh, a low, warm chuckle- like a drizzle of honey. Klaus realized that he’d been too tied up to even notice how Dave had changed voices too, seemingly dropping an octave lower in the sparse months since they’d seen each other.</p><p>“Speaking of chocolate milkshakes. . .” Dave said, gesturing towards the counter with a grin. Klaus jumped around, perhaps a <em> smidgen </em> too enthusiastically, and hurried to order his ice cream alongside Ben. And of course- <em> of fucking course- </em>like the annoying bastard of a handsome gentleman he was, Dave offered to pay for all of them.</p><p>“We should be the ones offering,” Klaus protested. “Reggie doesn’t mind where the money goes- he just throws it at us and says-” Klaus hunched over and squinted his eyes, straining his voice in his best old-man impression. “-<em> Get whatcha need, kiddos.” </em></p><p>“Lucky!” Agnes said, before popping back out of the conversation to thank the server.</p><p>“That is <em> not </em> what dad sounds like,” Ben said, though he laughed all the way. He hunched over even more dramatically than Klaus had, and made his words but a raspy wisp of sound. “ <em> Get your damn school supplies, you unappreciative children, and get out of my office.” </em></p><p>“That’s him! That’s it!” Klaus cheered, clapping his hands in a circle. Ben took a little bow, scooping up his ice cream and managing not to drop it throughout one of the wide sweeps of his arm.</p><p>“On the other hand, mine tells me I have exactly one Galleon, four sickles, and two knuts to spend, and says I better buy all my new robes and textbooks with it- he’s ridiculously cheap,” Dave said. The group laughed, Klaus poking fun at the tattered vest Dave was wearing, but apparently, “It’s all part of my style!” And then it was too late for any more protests, because Dave had already handed the server behind the counter the money for all of them.</p><p>“Such a sweetheart,” Agnes said, and Klaus could’ve sworn she was itching to pinch Dave’s cheek. “Why’d I pick this one when I could’ve picked you!”</p><p>She jerked her thumb at Hazel playfully, and he caught her wrist with a laugh. “Oh, wait a minute!” Hazel said.</p><p>“Wait- Agnes? Hazel and then Dave? What about me? I thought we had something,” Klaus cried. “Was it just a lie, all that time. Us eloping into the Forbidden Forest, or leaping off the astronomy tower like Romeo and Juliet. Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?”</p><p>“I thought <em> I </em>was your Romeo,” Dave countered. Klaus’ heart stuttered in his chest as Dave grabbed onto his arm, pressing a kiss to the air inches from his hand. There was a smirk on his face, a mischievous look rare on Gryffindor’s golden boy.</p><p>Klaus gave him an unimpressed up-and-down. “Hmm, I think I’ll stick to our fair princess,” Klaus said.</p><p>Dave gaped. “Agnes? What say you? Have both my lovers rejected me?”</p><p>“Sorry, buddy,” Hazel answered for her, sweeping Agnes into a kiss. Klaus made fake gagging sounds off to the side as Ben cheered the end of their Shakespearean play. Dave was laughing beside him, and Klaus wished he could sweep him into a kiss too. Those lips were so pink and soft. . .</p><p>“Klaus,” Ben said quietly. He looked apologetic, gesturing to the clock across from them. Klaus’s thoughts immediately fired up: <em> Thank God, thank Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour, thank the old gods and the new, thank you even to Zeus- actually, no. Fuck Zeus. Wait, that was probably the wrong thing to say too- </em></p><p>“<em> If </em> I was going to date a girl, I promise it’d be you,” Dave said. <em> Wait, what? </em></p><p>“Klaus,” Ben said again. Klaus slapped himself internally, trying to focus back on the stream of nonsense coming out of everyone’s mouth until it was. . .somewhat coherent. “Are you high again?”</p><p>“Why would you ask that?” The words tumbled out of his mouth, a little hurt, before he could stop them. Dave was looking at him, all concerned- and that. That wasn’t how this was supposed to go.</p><p>Ben cringed. “Right, sorry- I didn’t- Klaus. . .Hey, Agnes?” She turned from talking to Hazel to him. “We’re on a bit of a schedule. Sorry, we’ll see you at school?”</p><p>“Oh, you’re leaving already!” Agnes said. “I’ll be sending chocolate, plenty of chocolate.” They weren’t allowed to eat chocolate, but it was a nice sentiment, Klaus supposed. “Come hither, dears.”</p><p>It was definitely a sweet sentiment. Klaus smiled despite himself when Agnes wrapped him into a hug first. “We have five other thieves in our house, you know.” Her hair tickled his nose as she laughed.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ll be sure to send extra then.” Agnes kissed his cheek, then moved on to hug Ben, leaving Klaus face to face with Dave.</p><p>“I’ll find you at Kings Cross,” Dave said.</p><p>“Oh, please don’t,” Klaus groaned. “You don’t know my family well enough to know that’s a bad idea, and I promise you, you don’t <em> want </em>to know them.”</p><p>“They can’t be that bad-” Klaus’ eyebrows shot up- “If I see you, I see you, no promises.”</p><p>Klaus sighed, settling for his answer. He already knew what was going to happen, because Murphy’s Law was his best friend. And then Dave hugged him. He was the polar opposite of Klaus. Muscle where Klaus was all bones, stockier, stronger limbs where Klaus was gangly and thin. Warm skin where Klaus was cold. Dave pulled away, and Klaus searched for his breath- searched for his voice. “Bye.”</p><p>What the hell else was he supposed to say? Dave smiled, oh-so-softly. “Bye, Klaus.”</p><p>Klaus backed away with as little awkwardness as he could manage, and immediately spun around and walked out the door with a backwards wave. “See you at Hoggy Hoggy Hogwarts!” And then- “Hazel! Bye!”</p><p>The bell chimed as he left, and Klaus could almost sense Ben right on his heels. They walked a few paces away from the shop, the weight of Ben’s gaze on him all the way. He wanted to say something, even to tell him to stop, but Klaus knew that wasn’t what was going to come out of his mouth. If he said anything, Ben won. It was a game. And Ben was patient. . .</p><p>Klaus stared ahead resolutely, forcing one foot in front of the other until they were past the line and back into the heart of Diagon Alley. He pressed his lips together, refusing to speak. Ben’s stare somehow became more pointed. “OH- what do you want, huh? What do you want me to say? I don’t have anything to say, I don’t have an answer. What the hell was I thinking? I don’t know! I don’t think anything! It’s all just a jumbled mess up here, is that what you wanted to hear? I’m a jumbled mess and I just melt and short circuit when he comes around and- what? What?”</p><p>Klaus rounded on Ben. His brother’s face was a mask of calm, one eyebrow raised casually.</p><p>“So,” Ben said. “Dave, huh?”</p>
