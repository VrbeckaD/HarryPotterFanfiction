    <p align="justify">It was impossible to deny that Draco Malfoy was beautiful. No one would dare say that the aristocratic elegance of his movements, the slender and proportionate nimbleness to his fingers as he sliced potions ingredients, nor the exquisite lines of his face were anything but angelic: pale skinned, blonde haired and storm-coloured eyes, Malfoy was every inch the nobleman he had long professed to be. But even though Harry had initially found it more than difficult to face his feelings for his former enemy, he had no trouble admitting to himself that the boy seemed sad since his return to Hogwarts.</p><p align="justify">In a way, Harry was surprised he <em>had </em>returned. Very few Slytherins had - instead choosing to help rebuild their families, reputations or take a break from the continuous and relentless investigations of the new Ministry for Magic as they hunted for Death Eaters that had thus far avoided Azkaban. Maybe that was the reason Draco had strode into the Great Hall that evening, the welcoming feast pausing slightly to watch him sit at the incredibly depleted far table - because his trial had already been done. Lucius was already in Azkaban, although only for the next few years; his mother under house-arrest for the next eighteen months and Draco had been titled as both 'The Boy Who Had No Choice' and 'Death Eater' by the Prophet as various writers each got hold of his story and the verdict of <em>not-guilty</em>.</p><p align="justify">Harry, of course, had already known Draco's story - he had been there for some and had heard the rest in the trial, where he had repeatedly, vehemently, denied the claims that Draco was a willing participant in Voldemort's plans, and that Narcissa should follow her husband to prison for her part. Kingsley had told him afterwards that it had been his testimony that had kept Lucius alive, Narcissa relatively free and Draco cleared of all crimes. Harry had felt good, until he had seen the reaction of the press. Their understanding of a boy forced into an awful position turning quickly into vitriolic hatred for what they thought was a family that had not been sufficiently punished. His thoughts that they had been bad during his fifth year faded into obscurity. Suddenly Draco was Public Enemy Number One. </p><p align="justify">It had only been the wise, and pacifying, words of Hermione that had stopped him from acting out against the perceived injustice, bashing against the Prophet as he had done years previously. Ron, however, had simply declared that the Pureblood had deserved everything that had been given to him. Harry had walked away at that point.</p><p align="justify">But Draco stayed with him.</p><p align="justify">Wherever the Boy-Who-Lived looked, <em>he</em> was there; a ghost in the form of a siren, a blonde haired wrath of a boy unintentionally haunting Harry's every waking thought - and some non waking ones too. The teenager no longer baited the Gryffindors, he no longer smirked at them, nor used the frightful words he had once directed at Hermione. He had, much to their surprise, offered her a thank you when she had passed him ingredients in Potions before retreating to his seat and working quietly, alone, and with barely so much as a glance up. It unnerved Harry to see the boy so subdued, but there was something else too. Because it was in those moments: relaxed, sleeves rolled up, without the pretence of anger plastered across his face or the mocking sneer, that he saw <em>Draco</em> and not <em>Malfoy</em>. He looked young, world-weary and desperate to move on from what he was sure was a horrifying experience. After all, Harry hadn't spent months trapped inside Malfoy Manor with Voldemort and his ghastly followers because his father had thought that joining the dark was the right idea. It was bound to take a toll. </p><p align="justify">It was perhaps for that reason, and of course the growing pit of writhing warmth that tugged at his stomach, that saw Harry ditching his friends one cold, winter's afternoon in November and making his way through the castle, eyes glued on the Marauder's Map until Draco's name vanished from sight. He knew instantly just where the blonde was going and hesitated only for a split second before hurrying through the corridors and finally standing before the Room of Requirement, thinking desperately to see Malfoy. Thinking desperately to see <em>Draco</em>. </p><p align="justify">The door appeared moments later. Beckoning him forward with a temptation that not even he - the supposed Chosen One, the supposed most powerful wizard of his generation, the Man-Who-Lived-Twice - could withstand. He was helpless... as he always was concerning Draco, he thought. He had never realised just how much of his life had been focused, intertwined, tangled with the other's. They were the same: two boys with little choice and a destiny forced upon them by Fate, their families and an evil man with a penchant for torture. </p><p align="justify">Would Harry have shook Draco's hand all those years ago had he <em>not </em>been the Boy-Who-Lived? He would have probably wanted to more. Maybe because he would have understood just what Draco was forced to endure, what he had to live up to - he was Sirius, but without a James to pull him from the inky blackness. </p><p align="justify">His hand was twisting the handle and pushing forward as soon as it formed. He didn't even pause.</p><p align="justify">The room he walked into was nothing at all like Harry expected. Someone like Draco would have surely been at home in the green silks and silver drapery of Slytherin; the finest materials and nothing but the best for the boy who had, until only a couple of years previously, been the target of envy - the person that every young Pureblood wanted to emulate. He was proud, prim and proper and Harry had been sure that his room, or at least the room that Hogwarts would show him, would have been the exactly that. He couldn't have been more wrong. The deep brown cottage flooring had been covered in numerous rugs - some gold, red and yellow, others cream and brown, others just a block of colour but tasselled, the kind that you would stand and drag your toes through. They ran the length of the room, overlapping and bunching in that unstated rustic, messy way. Furthest away were two, oversized armchairs, plush and deep, one a green, yellow, cream and brown tartan, the other a deep red hue. They flanked a coffee table that looked hand carved and were sat before a huge stone fireplace, bigger than that found in the Gryffindor common room, it would look more at home in the Great Hall, Harry thought. Pillows and blankets were piled up on the chairs, and on the nearby sofa, pushed underneath a huge window that looked out onto... <em>the forest</em>? Woodland stretched as far as he could see and Harry found himself stumbling forward, past a towering bookshelf that spanned the wall, and towards the glass. He could smell it: leaves and grass after a rainstorm, the faint scent of parchment and old books and...<em>coffee</em>? He turned on his heel, dropping his bag on the floor and looking past the chairs. The Room of Requirement seemed to have separated the room into four: the main living room that he stood in, but Harry could see a large, double bed tucked underneath another large, bay window, and beyond that, a glimmer of an en-suite. And, he thought, from the increasing smell of coffee, there was some sort of kitchenette too. Was Draco <em>living</em> in the Room of Requirement? </p><p align="justify">It wouldn't be a surprise, Harry mused, given the less than welcome reception he had received and that none of his friends: not Parkinson, Zabini or Nott, had returned for their second attempt at seventh year. His fingers were running over the top of the armchair absentmindedly and his eyes fluttered closed as he stood and enjoyed the warm glow of the fire flickering behind him.</p><p align="justify">He couldn't remember the last time he felt so relaxed, so free. The Gryffindor common room just wasn't the same any more - not with the notable absences, the curious looks from his friends on <em>how he survived</em>, and the awed gazes of underlings. It was too much: too many eyes and not enough space. But here, in this strange, homely room summoned into life by a boy he was equally obsessed with and confused by, he felt at home, he felt <em>free.</em></p><p align="justify">It didn't last too long.</p><p align="justify">A clatter of something hitting the floor had his eyes open. Draco, mouth hung open and slack with a mug shattered at his feet, was stood before him. "Potter," he said, finally finding his voice, although it was little more than a hoarse croak.</p><p align="justify">Harry felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him and felt a blush rise in his cheeks because he had no, <em>no</em>, reason to be in the haven that the blonde had created. "Sorry," he muttered, waving his wand and reassembling the mug quickly. "I -" he paused, because he knew the words that were next about to leave his lips would be a lie. He didn't want to lie to Draco. "I was looking for somewhere quiet," he confessed, tucking his wand back into his robes.</p><p align="justify">"Right," the blonde replied, still clearly shaken; too unsure to react, too wary of Harry and the repercussions of fighting to do anything. It was clear that he didn't want to draw his wand first.</p><p align="justify">"Do you mind if I join you?" Harry pressed, mouth moving without any permission from his brain. He found himself incredibly reluctant to return to the common room, the numerous eyes and, of course, the circus of Ginny's infatuation with him, urging him to find another place to hang his hat. No one seemed to remember him breaking up with the younger girl and he had given up trying to explain himself without confessing the words: <em>I'm-obsessed-with-Draco-Malfoy</em> to anyone. He was pretty sure that, as far as the school, Ginny and his surrogate family were concerned, they were a couple. It was only Harry himself that had a problem with such a development... not that they listened to his problems with the situation. </p><p align="justify">"You already have," the Slytherin griped. Harry chuckled softly, almost nervously, but shrugged and powered through the feeling. Eventually the blonde sighed, too weary to fight him. "Do what you want, Potter."</p><p align="justify">"<em>Harry</em>," the messy haired boy corrected instantly as he kicked off his shoes and dropped into the plush, red armchair and pulled a nearby blanket over him, settling down as though he owned the place. Manners be damned, he was too happy to be in the space to think much of proper guest etiquette. He glanced back over to the stunned expression on Draco's face. "What?" he asked gently. </p><p align="justify">"What are you <em>doing</em> Potter?" Draco snapped, still standing, and looking at the green eyed boy as though he were mad. </p><p align="justify">"Harry," he corrected again, "and I was sitting by the fire, if that's okay?"</p><p align="justify">"No," Draco replied, setting down his reformed mug on the table and stepping forwards. "Why are you <em>here</em>? What's the game?"</p><p align="justify">"No game," Harry murmured, eyes turning back to the fire.</p><p align="justify">"So you just turned up? What, no taunts Potter? Aren't you here to fight me?" His voice was rising and suddenly he was the sneering, childish Draco that Harry had known all his years at Hogwarts. And suddenly it became inherently clear that his attitude was nothing more than a defence mechanism; a mask he wore to keep people out, and to keep himself safe.</p><p align="justify">"No," Harry whispered, shaking his head but still not looking at the blonde. "I'm not here to fight you, Draco."</p><p align="justify">"<em>Why not</em>?" the Pureblood hissed.</p><p align="justify">The Gryffindor did turn then. "Because," he said, meeting the beautiful, stormy eyes he'd slowly spent his last few months drowning in, "aren't you <em>tired</em> of fighting?"</p><p align="justify">The boy stopped as though shocked and his fire drained out of him like a balloon leaking air. Confused, defeated and unsure, the boy was suddenly soft, vulnerable and, <em>Merlin</em>, how had Harry not seen it before then? How could he have missed the beauty of him? All those times he had grappled with the boy, punched him, wished he would fall off his broom, and now he wanted nothing more than to run his hands through his hair and hold him close. Why? - he didn't know. He didn't know how deep the urges went, or why he had them. He had considered everything from love potions to hexes, until finally landing on a conclusion that he had not yet fully accepted: it was because he had <em>feelings</em> for Draco. More feelings than he ever had for Ginny - he <em>had </em>broken up with her after all, although she would say differently - and more so than Cho. It was confusing, scary and made him want to run away, but in Draco's presence, in the warm, red, red room, he felt peaceful.</p><p align="justify">He felt at home.</p><p align="justify">And then Draco sat down heavily in the armchair next to him, nursing his drink with a world-weary resignation on his features. Harry's eyes flickered over to him and the blonde snorted before starting, as though surprised at himself for doing so.</p><p align="justify">"If you think you're getting coffee too, Potter, you're fucking insane," he muttered finally, gaze not leaving the fire.</p><p align="justify">And for the first time in a long time, Harry threw back his head and laughed genuinely, and laughed <em>hard</em>.            </p>
