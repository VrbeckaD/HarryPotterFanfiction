    <p align="JUSTIFY">Ginny laughs as Harry rolls his Firebolt over and almost falls off his broom. He easily rights himself and circles the orchard upside down.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Alright! Stop boasting, Potter!” she calls after him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He lands gracefully next to her, a cheeky grin on his face. “I think that would be two beans, Weasley.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“<em>One</em> bean! We said one bean if you fly over one lap of the pitch upside down,” she reminds him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Yeah, but I flew over <em>two</em> laps so that two beans,” he smirks, extending his hand.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">She huffs and reluctantly gives him two beans from her Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans bag. She looks inside her bag, there's only one bean left. Harry's is still half full, the lucky git won most of their bets. Of course, he did. Unlike her, he has a Firebolt; he can do almost everything with that thing. It doesn't stop Ginny from coming up with crazier challenges every time, though.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">It's a game they have invented over the summer. They call it 'Bet-a-Bean', it's exactly what it sounds like.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“I hope they're both vomit flavour,” she grumbles.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry gladly takes his prize and pretends to hoist a toast. “To my victory over the novice Ms. Weasley, who should really learn a thing or two from me.” Ginny glowers at him as he bites in the first bean. “Chocolate,” he sighs in delight.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He raises the second bean up in the air. “And to my legendary skills. Shame that Ms. Weasley seems to have none.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">This time, Ginny does try to punch him, but being taller than her, Harry easily dodges her fist. “Strawberry,” he grins at the furious redhead.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Now you've really pissed me off, Potter.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Oooh, I'm so scared.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Ginny stands right in front of him, glaring daggers, and pulls herself to her full length. Harry tries –but fails miserably– to hide his smile. She barely reaches his chin and looks more like an angry kitten than a dangerous tiger. It's adorable, really.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“I bet you one bean that I can stand up on my broom for ten seconds and not fall off.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Two beans.” He lifts an eyebrow as her cheeks flush brightly. “What? You don't have enough beans left?”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Sod off!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Someone's cranky.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Someone needs to shut up!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry grins. “Fine. One bean.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Determined to win, Ginny mounts her broom. She kneels carefully and slowly stands up, her feet firmly set on her broom. She hears Harry whistle but she doesn't look at him, her eyes are focused on an invisible point straight ahead of her. Harry starts counting to ten. Her feet are trembling and she's beginning to tire but she refuses to give up.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Finally, Harry announces, “Ten!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Beaming, she jumps off of her broom. “I won!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Congratulation.”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">He gives her a bean and she eats it, happily sucking on the sweet, when... Ginny suddenly turns slightly green and spits it out.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“Phlegm!” she cries.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry bursts out laughing. “How fitting!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p> </p>
