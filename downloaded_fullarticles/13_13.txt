  <b>REMUS </b>
</p><p>“Ugh, he acts like I’m going to get kidnapped or die or something on this trip,” Remus exclaims as he buckles his seatbelt in the passenger seat of Lily’s car. He bends forward and checks his backpack for probably the tenth time since he finished packing it just mere moments before Lily arrived in the Lupins’ driveway. </p><p>Truth be told - though he’s been unfathomably annoyed with the fuss his father has been making over him since he booked this impromptu trip to Paris - he is admittedly a little bit nervous. It’s nothing he can’t handle, and it’s not like he’s never gone anywhere before, but this is the largest trip that he has ever taken solo. And he’s not one to admit that maybe booking a cheap flight to Paris while grieving the death of his mother wasn’t necessarily the best idea. </p><p>“He just worries, Remus,” Lily says calmly. “And can you even really blame him?”</p><p>“No,” Remus sighs. “It’s just…” he pauses and tries to collect his words. “I’m not a child anymore. Far from it, and he treats me like one. Always fussing and giving unwanted advice and input. It sets my teeth on edge. He needs to let me just be.”</p><p>Lily reaches her hand across the center council and gives Remus’s shoulder a conciliatory squeeze. “I know,” she says. “But you’re all he has left and you have to admit, this trip did come a little bit out of left field.”</p><p>“Fine, it did. But he could’ve acted a little bit less like I was dying as I left.” </p><p>“Maybe the <em> Remus </em> he knows is dying,” Lily says, her eyes set and focused on the light traffic in front of them. </p><p>Remus turns and looks at his best friend. She’s always been insightful, especially at times when it will have the most impact. “That’s probably the most poignant thing you’ve ever said.”</p><p>She turns her head just enough quick enough to give him a wink before she places her eyes back on the road. “It’s true though, you’re changing a lot, Remus. And the death of your mother has only sped those things along.”</p><p>Remus frowns, his brow furrowing. “Why do you always have to be so right?” </p><p>“It’s my charm, I guess.” She shrugs her shoulders and chances another glance at Remus. “So,” she says slowly as her eyes move forward again, “are you going to tell him when you get back?”</p><p>“I think he already knows. Mom probably told him for me. It would explain some of the awkwardness.” </p><p>“Or, some of that awkwardness could be there because he’s waiting for his son, who he loves dearly by the way, to tell him himself that he’s gay.” Lily says all of this without sparing a glance at Remus. She does however have an annoying smirk on her face that Remus is glaring at. “I can feel your look, Remus. And it’s because you know I’m right.”</p><p>“Fine. I’ll tell him when I get back. Can we change the subject now?” Remus asks as he reaches forward again to check the location of his passport in his bag. </p><p>“Of course,” Lily says amiably. “How about you promise to send me pictures of all the hot guys you meet over there! And find me a French husband while you’re at it.”</p><p>Remus lets out a laugh. “Okay Lily, I’ll find French husbands for the both of us.”</p>
