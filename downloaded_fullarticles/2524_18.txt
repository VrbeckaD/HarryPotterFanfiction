    <p>Petunia squealed with giddy delight as she glanced over the brochures in her bony hand. Vernon, her fat husband, huffed over and looked over her shoulder.<br/>"What is it, Pet?" he asked. Petunia squealed once more, and spun to meet her husband's' gaze.<br/>"We won a trip for a Costa Rican Cruise! I entered at the grocers, but I never thought we'd win!" She yelped. Vernon laughed.<br/>"Well, what are we waiting for? Lets pack up and go!" he bellowed. The two smiled and laughed, but became somber almost immediately.<br/>"What about...him?" she hissed. Vernon looked at his wife. He kept his gaze hard.<br/>"We'll drop him off at a sitter's of course. We won't let that...abomination, ruin a family trip." he gruffed. PEtunia sniffed.<br/>"Very well. I'll go get Dudley ready, oh! this will be so much fun!" She ran up the stairs to begin packing. Vernon smiled, but sneered hatefully at the cupboard under those steps.</p>

<p>Harry Potter, age ten sighed as he was dragged to a cabin on the ship. Vernon basically threw him inside, and waddled in. HIs horrid aunt and that fat pig he was forced to call cousin were up on the decks, enjoying the southern american air.<br/>"Now you listen here boy. Any funny business, ANd I'll have the captain throw you in stocks. DO you understand?" he growled. Harry nodded his head.<br/>"Yes Uncle Vernon." pleased at the result, The whale of a man moved and left the cabin. Harry let out a breath and sat on one of the four beds. He smiled and rolled around on the soft sheets. For two weeks, the Dursleys and Harry were on a cruise through the Southern American islands. He even convinced his aunt to buy him swim clothes for the numerous pools on deck. He locked the cabin quickly and redressed. He sighed happily as he placed on a brand new green tank top on over a pair of black and gold swim trunks. PLacing his glasses back on the bridge of his nose, he left the cabin to explore. Taking a left, he came to a flight of stairs and went up. He was awed in admiration as he gazed over the sweet blue waters of the sea.<br/>"So pretty." he mumbled to himself. A man to his left chuckled. HArry looked up. The man was old, about in his 70s, with white hair and a cane with an odd yellow stone with a bug inside on top. He was dressed in all white, and had a youthful energy around him.<br/>"First time seeing the ocean, boy?" he asked. Harry nodded, his black hair wild from the sea breeze.<br/>"It's amazing." The man smiled and placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. Harry relaxed, sensing no ill will.<br/>"Why don't we get some lunch at the decks." The man smiled, his grey eyes twinkled with easy mirth.<br/>"Okay." He followed.<br/>"What's your name?" THe man asked.<br/>"Harry sir. WHat's yours?"<br/>"Hammond, John Hammond."</p>

<p>"Mummy, I'm bored!" Dudley whined. Petunia sighed and tried to mellow out her son. Dudley let out a scream and kicked her hard in the shin.<br/>"OW! Now, Dudders, There are many games on board, why don't you go play one?" She simpered. Dudley huffed.<br/>"I want my games from home. I want my gameboy! and my pokemons." he whined. Petunia sighed.<br/>"We left your games at home so we can enjoy the cruise."<br/>"THen I want to go home!" He screamed and threw himself on the floor, initiating a tantrum. Petunia paled and flushed as she notice several other tenants give her looks and some even began to whisper behind their hands.<br/>"Look at the horrid child..."<br/>"So spoiled."<br/>"Why doesn't she do anything?"<br/>"IF that were my kid, he'd be picking himself off the floor by now."<br/>"Now there's a kid who need a good spanking." were some of the whispers. Embarrassed, she grabbed her squalling son and hurried towards the buffets.</p>
<p>Vernon found his wife and son at one of the local buffets. His strapping boy eating plenty of chicken and chips. While his wife seemed cowed.<br/>"Petunia, what's wrong, pet?" he asked. Dudley let out a loud fart and continued eating. Several other diners glared at the family and even moved away. Vernon ignored them.<br/>"Oh, Dudley had a bit of a fit on the deck, So I took him down to eat. He seems much calmer now." she sighed and picked at her own food. Vernon huffed and got himself a few plates.<br/>"He's just a bit bored. We'll take him to the pool and he can burn off some of the energy." PEtunia smiled.<br/>"If you say so."</p>

<p>Hammond and Harry were enjoying a dish of chicken fingers, chips and ranch dressing. Harry took a sip of the soda his new friend bought him.<br/>"THank you for the meal!" he praise.d Hammond smiled.<br/>"It's nothing to worry about, but you seem to eat as if you haven't eaten in awhile." too caught up with the kindness of the man, Harry replied.<br/>"Well, Aunt Petunia says I have to earn my food, But she gives me so much chores I can't." He took a few chips and devoured them, enjoying the seasoning on the potato spears. JOhn Hammond gaped. This poor young lad, was abused by his family.<br/>"I see. What does your uncle do?" he asked. Harry nibbled on a chicken finger.<br/>"Well, sometimes he hits me if I'm in the way, But mostly just cuffs my head and ears and calls me a freak. Dudley is the worst though."<br/>"How so?" Harry washed down the remainder of his meal with the soda.<br/>"He made up a game called 'Harry Hunting' and has his friends chase me around and if they catch me, they beat me up. BUt I'm fast, so they don't catch me a lot. SOmetimes DUdley kicks me down our stairs and shoots me with his BB gun until he broke it." JOhn Hammond was seeing red now. HOw dare they treat such a sweet child so horribly. He began to form a plan.<br/>"Harry, would you like me to take you away? I know of a place so amazing, you'd love it." Harry gasped, his face breaking into an enormous smile.<br/>"ReallY?" Hammond nodded.<br/>"Yes. ANd you'll never have to see your family again." Harry smiled and without warning, hugged the man.<br/>"Thank you!" he exclaimed. Hammond chuckled.<br/>"You are very welcome. BUt I must go contact someone. Can you wait here for me?" Harry nodded.<br/>"I'll won't leave the deck." John smiled and stood, his legs giving a bit of a creak as he stood. He waved the boy off and hurried on his way. HIs lawyer was going to have a field day with this case.</p>
<p>Harry leaned slightly on the deck walls and hummed to himself as he looked at the wonderful ocean. He squinted. He thought he could see and island. Cool.<br/>SMACK! Turning around, he glared as a ornery Dudley sneered at him.<br/>"Hello freak! Want to play a game of Harry hunting?" he sneered. Harry turned his back on his cousin.<br/>"NO, In fact. I'm not playing one more game with a fat brat like you anymore!" Dudley saw red,a nd with a great shove, threw his much smaller cousin overboard. HArry, too shocked to saw anything, fell into the churned waters, unnoticed. Dudley smiled and walked away.</p>
