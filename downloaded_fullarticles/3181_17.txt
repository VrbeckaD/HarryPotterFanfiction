    <p>James stared at his phone, trying to come up with a good idea (or at least something that wasn’t completely pathetic; he did have a reputation to uphold). He knew that Peter’s birthday was coming up in a week and that he, Sirius, and Remus needed to come up with something great. Usually he was the one who came up with party ideas, but he had been stumped for the past two days. The only thing he had come up with was throwing Peter a surprise party, but he wasn’t even sure if that was actually a good idea or if he was just desperate. He couldn’t let this turn out like the fiasco of fifth year, though, so he quickly opened his messages and clicked to make a new chat. He added Sirius and Remus to it and quickly gave it a name.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Operation: Wormtail’s Surprise </strong>
</p><p>[2:00 am] <u>Good evening, Gentlemen. I guess you’re wondering why I’ve gathered you here.</u>James laid back in his bed, impatiently waiting for one of his friends to respond. It wasn’t until he was about to give up and go back to sleep that he heard his phone buzz. He quickly threw on his glasses, looking at the message.</p><p>[2:08 am] <strong>Prongs, it’s literally 2 in the morning. Why the bloody hell are you up?</strong></p><p>[2:08 am] <u>I had an idea for Wormtail’s birthday</u></p><p>[2:09 am] <strong>2 AM JAMES! WHAT PART OF THAT DON’T YOU GET?</strong></p><p>[2:13 am] <strong>well don’t just leave me hanging you wanker</strong></p><p>[2: 14 am] <u>A surprise party. I thought the title of the chat made that pretty clear</u></p><p>[2:17 am] <em>Are you two morons trying to tell me that I was woken up in the middle of the night to talk about Wormtail’s birthday party?</em></p><p>
  <em> can’t this wait until—I don’t know—it’s not 2 in the morning?</em>
</p><p>[2:18 am] <strong>MOONY</strong></p><p>
  <strong>WE’RE SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US</strong>
</p><p>[2:20 am] <em><u> </u></em><u>Sirius, what did I tell you about texting in all caps?</u></p><p>[2:21 am] <strong>but I want remus to know how happy I am</strong></p><p>
  <strong>It’s been far too long</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I thought I would die</strong>
</p><p>[2:22 am] <em>we literally saw each other four hours ago</em></p><p>
  <em>and I’m in the bed right next to yours</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The chat went silent for a few minutes and James huffed, assuming that his two friends had fallen back asleep. He was just about to return to sleep himself when he heard a gasp followed by “Sirius, what are you doing?” He couldn’t hear what Sirius responded and he cursed his friend’s ability to be unnaturally quiet at the worst times. He was, however, able to catch what Remus said: “Just because I acknowledged the location of our beds does not mean that I was looking for you to come into my bed!”</p><p>“But you were implying it, right?” Sirius shot back, and James couldn’t tell if he was angry or not.</p><p>“No. I was merely stating a fact to ease your worry over our lack of interaction since this evening.” At this point, James felt like he probably should have stopped eavesdropping but he quickly decided against it.</p><p>“Oh…” Sirius said, and James knew that he was most definitely giving Remus the puppy dog eyes that he had perfected over the years. Remus sighed, opening the curtains surrounding his bed and gesturing to the one next to his.</p><p>“Fine…You can stay,” Remus sighed, attempting to sound annoyed. “Get your own blanket, though. You’re always freezing and I really don’t feel like having your cold nose, feet, or anything else touching me all night.”</p><p>Sirius jumped off of Remus’ bed, quickly grabbing the blanket from his own bed and jumping back into Remus’, immediately latching himself to the taller boy.</p><p align="center">
