    <p>It had taken years of study, and experimentation, but Hermione had finally made a breakthrough. The Veil of Death wasn’t a Death sentence but an escape route. At least, that’s what Sirius Black used it for, and now Harry Potter will be using it as such. Hermione gathered her notes and made plans to visit Gringotts, as she thought about why her best friend needed an escape. After the Blood Wars, Harry had become the Master of Death and underwent a magical change of some kind. Not in personality, or looks, or anything like that. His magic itself changed, becoming so vast in power that he stopped aging. The public whispered of Dark Magic. They didn’t see the tears Harry tried to hide when Molly’s red hair grayed.<br/>Hermione had once found Harry talking to a shadow, or through a shadow, she should say, to a little girl in America who wanted to befriend the scary but lonely monster under her bed. On another occasion Harry had suddenly jumped through a nearby shadow in a panic, only to return with the little girl he had befriended over the past nine months near death in his arms. Learning that the girl had been kicked out of an orphanage after the drunken Matron had beaten her had Hermione torn between rage and tears. Hermione had gotten the girl’s official papers for the Muggle world and had helped Harry through the adoption process. The girl’s physical injuries healed with time and proved herself to be a Squib and a Witch in terms of magical strength.<br/>Teddy loved having a little sister, the eleven-year-old whose letter never came, often spent his time finding new ways to entertain the younger girl. For all of Teddy’s Metamorphmagus abilities, he didn’t have the external magical abilities required for spells. When Cassie showed signs of True Sight, Luna happily began the little girl’s meditative education before providing Harry with all the books he’d need for raising and teaching a Seer. Over the past eleven years, the public had branded Harry a Dark Lord, who stole magic from children and corrupted it for his own immortality. Due to the fact Harry still looked seventeen even if it’s a healthy seventeen, he’s supposed to be in his late twenties, and that makes it hard to convince people Harry isn’t using Dark Magic.<br/>It all came to a head this past summer when Teddy didn’t get his Hogwarts letter. The public wanted to execute Harry for his crimes as a rising Dark Lord. They had been preparing themselves for the worst case situation for years. Molly had been brewing all the potions she could think of, with the help of Percy, Percy’s wife Penny, Charlie, and even Fleur helped. Bill had given them a Traveler's Trunk, with five magically made and protected compartments. Lavender and Ginny had taken Harry, Teddy, and Cassie shopping, stating that they needed fresh air. Lav and Gin disappeared into Muggle London and Diagon Alley with three Potters. While they were gone, Molly filled the trunks Freezer with pre-made potions and a potion-making kit with Cauldron. She filled the Cupboard compartment with food and ingredients, all under stasis. By the time the shoppers returned to fill the Wardrobe compartment with newly bought clothes, the library had been filled with all the books Hermione and Luna believed would be useful.<br/>Harry had been making plans with the Goblins in his free time. Getting his two kids ready for the move, and filling the spare compartment of his trunk with whatever he felt was important enough to take with them. They didn’t have very much time left before the public would be ready to burn Harry at the stake. None of their friends wanted to lose Harry again or see Teddy and Cassie orphaned for the second time, so they had to act quickly.<br/>Hermione dragged herself from her thoughts as she walked up the steps of Gringotts bank. She ran a hand through her wavy brown curls as her heels clicked on the bank's tiled floor. She smiled sadly remembering all the times Harry had done the same thing when stressed. With a glance at the papers in her arms, she strengthened her resolve. Harry was always the one facing the wrath of the public by himself. The one time Hermione had become a target in their fourth year, Harry had found lawyers to sue the Daily Prophet. When the Daily Prophet was put under the waves of public opinion they quickly sought to appease The Boy Who Lived and in their next newspaper apologized to Hermione Granger and Harry Potter for the defamation of their characters. Harry had asked Hermione if he should still sue them, and she had said he didn’t have to. She regretted it now, but hindsight is forever twenty/twenty. This time though, she’d be giving Harry the escape he so desperately needs. A new start someplace without the mindless sheep of the Magical Public. Where he can raise his kids without getting killed for a genetic quirk, hopefully.<br/>She walked into the Potter’s Account Manager’s office where Harry and the two kids sat with the Account Manager.<br/>“Each ring offers protection then?” Harry asked as he looked at the eight rings on the table.<br/>“That is correct.” The goblin replied briskly.<br/>Harry nodded before he slipped two rings onto his right hand, the silver and gold bands twining around the black band of the resurrection stone. Hermione stood silently by the door as Harry passed a ring to each of the kids.<br/>“Lord Potter-Black, Heir Black, Heiress Potter, thank you for using Gringotts bank. Your gold is much appreciated.” The goblin commented. Harry nodded then shooed the kids over to Hermione. She listened as Cassie excitedly showed off her new ring, the seven-year-old having sat as silent as a statue to get it. Hermione watched over her shoulder as Harry pocketed the other rings before he followed them out of the office.</p><p>Hermione stood across from Ron by the Veil as Hagrid protected the door to the Death room within the Ministry. Harry had the trunk shrunken in his pocket and one of his kids on each side of him. He held their hands and the three stepped to stand before the Veil. Hermione sent a wave of formless magic at the runes written across the Veil’s archway, Ron following a short second later.<br/>“We love you guys,” Harry whispered as he and the kids walked towards the veil.<br/>“I’ll miss you.” Teddy agreed.<br/>“Bye Bye!” Cassie cried softly.<br/>Hermione felt the Veil feeding on her magic and whispered her own farewells to the trio.<br/>“We’ll see you again one day.” She promised as they faded through the Veil.</p>
