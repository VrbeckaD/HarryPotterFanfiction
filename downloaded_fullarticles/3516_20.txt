    <p>1995<br/>It was almost 8 P.M. when Severus Snape entered the staffroom. He had only just closed the door behind him when Minerva began to chuckle. The entire staff was surprised to see that Severus’s robes, hair and eyes where an almost fluorescent pink.<br/>“The Weasley twins.” He grumbled, walking in front of his laughing colleagues.<br/>“They really are the Marauders’ heirs, my dear. Pink has always suited you.” Minerva said, contemplative.</p>

<p>1976	<br/>It was 7.30. A.M. when Minerva McGonagall came into the Great Hall through the small door behind the staff’s table. To her surprise, in this cold and dull winter morning, the main colour in the Hall was… Pink. She only needed a few seconds to notice the Marauders, the only students wearing untouched robes. She really tried to keep a serious face, she was Head of Gryffindor house, after all. She was not supposed to laugh about school robes but to punish the culprits.<br/>Unfortunately she had an inevitable and uncontrollable fit of giggles the moment her eyes fell on Severus Snape. Indeed, the Marauders had successfully dyed everything that was black in an awful shade of pink -which meant mostly the students’ robes-, and the unfortunate Slytherin’s hair had endured the same fate. He looked like a marshmallow with way too much food colouring in it. From her place on the platform where her table was she could see him trying each and every spell he knew to try and undo the spell, but he had no luck.<br/>They had to wait for the late arrival of the Headmaster for him to break the spell and for all the student to got their original colour back.</p>

<p>1995<br/>This time, Severus had successfully changed his hair and eyes back to their usual black, but he had no such luck with his robes. A quick glance at the old clock on the wall told him he only had 6 minutes left before his first class of the day. Feeling his distress, Minerva waved her wand his way and his robes got their jet black colour back. She felt thankful she had thought useful to ask the Headmaster the counter-curse of the spell 30 years before. At the time she had been sure she would need it one day in the future. She was obviously right. Severus glanced at her, clearly annoyed and left the room quickly and silently to go back to his dungeons.</p>
<p>The other professors were still laughing and, after one last amused glance, they all left to go to  their respective classes.</p>
