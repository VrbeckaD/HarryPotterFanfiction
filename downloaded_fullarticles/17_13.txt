    <p>He knows this one. He remembers it well. He flies through the air, gliding in a strange black mist, a spell he created with Regulus Black. Reg was a genius when it came down to it. A complete mad man at times, but a genius none the less. Especially when it came to creating new spells. A spell heading towards him caught his eye and he ducked, tucking into a roll as the ground hurtled towards him. Oh yes, he remembers how this goes.<br/>
<br/>
Severus stood up from his ungainly heap, turning to look up at the laughing boys standing above him. He had known them too long not to know them now.<br/>
<br/>
“Because of you, my Lily had to die. Because of you Snivellus, my boy grew up with no parents. He grew up beaten and starved. I had her and you couldn’t stand it. You gave us up to the Dark Lord because you couldn’t stand knowing that I made Lily happy. You deserve to die!” The youngest man, little more than a child himself, fired a bright red stunner towards him that withered and died as it hit him. His body reacted but he felt nothing.<br/><br/>

“You should have listened to Harry. You should have listened to the children. They told you what to do. If it hadn’t been for you, I would have lived, and Harry would be happy. If Harry was happy, he would have been able to help save everyone else.  No one else needed to die. Just the Dark Lord. Because of you, hundreds are dead.” The second man flicked his hair out of his eyes before sending a jet of purple spell fire at his chest. He flinched, looking down as his shirt stained with bright red blood. His eyes widened in fear as he began to twitch.<br/><br/>

“You wasted your life on both sides of the war. Now you are alone, and no one wants you. No one trusts you. Everyone wants you dead. No one will mourn you. Even the Dark Lord didn’t care. He wanted you dead. He was willing to do it.” The scruffy, sandy haired man shuffled and giggled nervously before firing a sickly yellow spell at him. Severus reached up to his throat, his voice bubbling as he tried to scream through the blood now spilling between his fingers.<br/><br/>

The fourth man, the quietest, the last to die, sighed and stepped forward sadly. “You are hearing absolutely nothing new from us Severus. You know what we deserved. We were good people. You were not. You are not. You don’t deserve to live when we all died. You chose the wrong path, the wrong Master. You know where to go.” Remus Lupin raised his wand and cast Imperio, forcing Severus to turn and walk towards the Shrieking Shack. He had learned years before to fight it off but, with his blood flowing from wounds in his neck and chest, he just wasn’t strong enough. His mind felt heavy as he walked into the dusty old building, the scene of too many of his nightmares, too many of his worst memories.<br/>
<br/>
He walked into the Shrieking Shack, the smell of dust and blood assaulting his nostrils. He walked towards the snake-faced man in the corner, forced to continue his journey by the Imperius curse. The man turned, looking at him, his eyes flashing bright blue, twinkling at him.<br/>
<br/>
“For the Greater Good!” The words were wrong, all wrong, as a bolt of sickly green light, headed towards Severus, the snake Nagini leaping at him at the same second.<br/>
<br/>
He sat upright in bed, his legs wrapped in his sheets, his breath coming in soft pants, a sheen of sweat on his skin. He wretched, leaning down to vomit off the side of his bed onto the cold dungeon floors. He closed his eyes for a second, collecting his thoughts. He picked up his wand with a shaky hand and Vanished the remnants of his previous night’s dinner.<br/>
<br/>
“Just a dream. Only a dream.” He whimpered softly to himself. Every night they came. Those Stupid Dreams. </p>
