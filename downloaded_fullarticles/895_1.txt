    <p>Greetings and well met everyone, my name is Clover Phipps, and this is the start of a compilation of my notes as an apprentice in the ways of Divination, and my guides in this matter are Prof. Trelawney and Prof. Firenze.</p><p>At this time only Prof. Trelawney has agreed to let me publish my notes and running projects to the public of both Muggle and Wizard-Kind alike, understandably so, Prof. Firenze wishes me to keep our notes private until such a time that he feels everyone is ready for learning from a centaur like himself. Of course I personally think that he is just nervous of not being accepted by everyone, he keeps telling me that not everyone is as kind, considerate and open minded as Prof. Dumbledore was, and still is through his portrait.</p><p>Well, anyways, Iâ€™m getting off topic, perhaps a side effect of spending so much time with Prof. Trelawney. Well, this first installment of my notes will be about one of the most basic tools of Divination: Tarot. I have developed a way to let the cards speak. Please enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. I must admit it might take me a bit to read your notes due to having to travel to Hogsmeade each time I wish to add and see anything on here, due to the whole muggle mechanics acting up around Hogwarts. Well please enjoy.</p><p>A - The Fool - 5 of Pentacles - 3 of Wands<br/>
