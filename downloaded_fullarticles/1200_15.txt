          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus knew he probably shouldn't have listened to that sylph. Sure, as a spirit of the air she supposedly had a good overview of the area, but thinking back to their conversation he was pretty sure that she'd been a trickster.</p><p>He'd been following the direction the sylph had pointed him for hours now and still there was no end to the forest surrounding him. If he'd stayed on his way, he would have reached his destination close to dusk, but the promised shortcut had only led him deeper into the mess of trees, moss and occasional stone formations he carefully avoided.</p><p>If she'd really been a trickster, what had she had in mind when she sent him the wrong way? Remus was no god, there'd be no grand effect by troubling him. Yet he couldn't think of anything great he'd be able to achieve either. So maybe she'd just been in the mood to stir up some trouble.</p><p>It wasn't that much of a surprise to run into a trickster in the Woods of Ank'luÄ‘osh, there were many creatures and spirits living here. From gnomes to ogres and from unicorns to centaurs, the variety of living beings was huge. Remus had even encountered a hippogryph in the outer parts of the forest. But he wasn't too fond of spending the night here, especially since the dark of the night typically rose beings far more dangerous and devious.</p><p>The bit of sunlight that managed to get past the thick foliage above him started to get less and with a heavy sigh Remus summoned a small flame into his hand in order to avoid stepping into any of the faery circles he knew were spread throughout the whole forest.</p><p>"That really is a very stupid idea, you should put that out again."</p><p>Remus jumped and turned around; his staff raised at whoever had just spoken behind him. But there was no one. Slowly he turned, making the flame a bit bigger to lighten a bigger radius and hopefully spot the being.</p><p>"Are you doing that on purpose? I said 'out', not 'bigger'. My, are humans really that daft?" Whoever was speaking chuckled.</p><p>"Show yourself!", Remus shouted, still turning around and trying to catch a glimpse of the body that belonged to the voice.</p><p>"Fine. But put out that flame, honestly, you'll end up burning down the whole forest." And while it spoke, it revealed itself. Drifting down from almost right above Remus' head was a pixie, not much bigger than one of Remus' hands. Its little wings were fluttering animatedly, leaving a trail of glittering dust hanging in the air. The dark green clothes clung tight to its body and its ears poked through the curls of black hair framing its face. Around its neck hung a tiny silver necklace.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I'll tell you if you put out that fire", it said, swaying as if it was listening to a tune only it could hear.</p><p>"I won't be able to see very well without it", Remus stated, fascinated by the little being.</p><p>The pixie snorted. "Summon a ball of cold light then, or put it in a vial. I'll have you know that no one would appreciate it if you accidentally set everything on fire. Except maybe the goblins."</p><p>Remus hesitated a bit, then he willed the fire to lose its heat and only keep the light.</p><p>"There you go, much better", the pixie chirped. "I'm Sirius, nice to meet you." And it held out a little hand.</p><p>Hesitantly Remus shook it with just his thumb and his index finger. "I'm Remus Lupin. Are you a boy or a girl?" He hadn't really meant to ask that question; it had just slipped out.</p><p>"Are you a boy or a girl?", Sirius asked back. "It's been a while since I saw any human in this forest. Years, decades actually. No one dares to walk through here. It's gotten hard to tell the difference."</p><p>"I'm a boy."</p><p>"Great! I'm a man." Remus could see Sirius' little chest swell, before he let out a little laugh about how well he'd set Remus up. "Anyway, I've been trying to figure out where you're headed since you passed by my hammock at Euphemia's River Birch and it seems like you're a little lost, otherwise you wouldn't head straight for Narcissa's Cave."</p><p>"I- have to admit I don't know where either of these two are located", Remus confessed. He'd been thinking about getting out his compass and just head straight northward until he left the forest, but he wasn't sure if any magical fields would have influenced the needle.</p><p>"They're both ingroup names, you wouldn't know them, but trust me, you don't want to get anywhere near Narcissa's Cave, a dragon family has their nest there. And before you say 'dragons aren't that bad', well my mighty witch, those are. And they're frequently visited by Tom." Sirius shivered. It sent a whole cloud of glittering dust to the ground. "He's an incubus. I can't sleep whenever he was within earshot. And I've got incredible ears."</p><p>Against better knowledge, Remus asked the same question he'd already regretted asking earlier that day. "Which way do you suggest I go?"</p><p>"Ohh that totally depends on where you wanna go. You can go east, west or south. But not north, not from here."</p><p>Remus sighed. Not north. So it was a more complicated route ahead of him.</p><p>"I know my way around here pretty well though, even a few hours outside the forest. Are you maybe looking for that village on the outskirts of it? The one with the pumpkin shaped church?"</p><p>A feeling of relief flooded through Remus. "Yes! That's exactly where I'm headed."</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow. "To the pumpkin shaped church?"</p><p>"No." Remus laughed. "That village!"</p><p>"With the pumpkin shaped church."</p><p>"Yes, it's got a pumpkin shaped church. But I live comparatively far away from that."</p><p>"Well that's good." Sirius grinned. "If you were living in a building that's pumpkin shaped, I'd let you run straight to Narcissa's Cave. But knowing that you don't-", he flew a lap around Remus's head, "-I can show you the way."</p><p>It was a tempting offer. But it had been made by a pixie. A being rumoured to not only cause some distracting mischief, but also to lead people astray into swamps from which they never return. As Remus pondered over his decision, he recognized the way Sirius was looking at him. How someone with such an open face should try to scheme the death of a witch who was visibly wearing iron tools was a mystery to him.</p><p>"I'd be honoured if you lead the way." If he hadn't based part of his job on reading people, Remus might not have noticed the slight blush that crept onto Sirius' cheeks.</p><p>"We'll head west first then", the pixie announced and took off in that direction, leaving a trail of sparks in his way.</p><p>Remus readjusted the strap of his bag and started following the line of pixie dust. Not only did it reflect the light of his flame, but it also had its own soft glow, which helped immensely to not lose his way. It didn't take long before Sirius returned to him.</p><p>"Sorry", he mumbled, his cheeks crimson with embarrassment, "I forgot it takes longer for humans to walk than it takes for a pixie like me to fly. Wouldn't be of help if I arrived at your village without you, would I?" He let out a laugh, adjusting his pace so Remus could keep up. "James used to warn me that that would happen. Said it's part of why our reputation sucks."</p><p>"Terrible speed judgement?", Remus asked, an eyebrow raised in amusement. "Don't worry, I was following your trail just fine."</p><p>"My tr- oooh, right, my trail!", Sirius exclaimed. He turned to look at the wobbly line of pixie dust he left behind. "Yeah, that. To be honest I kind of forget about that from time to time." He shook out his hair, watching with fascination as a tiny cloud of the sparkling stuff puffed up around him. "It's pretty, isn't it?"</p><p>Remus hummed in agreement. "And since it's fluorescent it makes it quite easy to track you. Doesn't that bother you? I've heard there's a group of hunters out to catch magical beings."</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "Never met them. But if they ever found me, I'd give them hell." A mischievous glimmer flared up in his grey eyes. "I've got some tricks up my sleeve. Also, the sparkling fades after a few hours", he added. "Can you imagine if it wouldn't? The whole forest would look like a hoard of pixies hosted a dance night." He chuckled. "The goblins would hate it."</p><p>Despite the seriousness of the topic, Remus found himself smiling. There was no way around the cheerfulness of the pixie, it was outright contagious.</p><p>"You know, most animals would feel threatened when you bare your teeth like that, but I think it's quite charming."</p><p>The odd compliment caught Remus off guard. Next to him, Sirius kept flying on as if nothing happened. Remus was still fascinated by him. Where most of the pixies he had the luck to meet had looked naturally impish with 'creature of mischief' written all over their face, Sirius' features were not only very human and handsome, but he also could easily have been a member of an aristocratic family if it hadn't been for the tell-tale signs of a pixie. He didn't really fit into the textbooks and it sent Remus' thoughts spinning.</p><p>"Stop!" The shout was impressive for someone with such small lungs and Remus halted abruptly. He'd been so absorbed by his study of Sirius' appearance that he had almost walked straight into the ring of mushrooms he became acutely aware of now.</p><p>"Hey, why did you warn him?! He was supposed to be Georgia's wedding gift!"</p><p>It took Remus a while to spot the tiny head poking out from a nearby bush. It looked angry, but also unbearably cute.</p><p>"Sorry, Lilith", Sirius called back, shooing Remus around the circle, "but I promised this one to bring him somewhere. So keep your hands off him, he might become faery fodder someday, but not today."</p><p>"Thanks", Remus whispered, as Sirius kept urging him away from the faery circle.</p><p>"I should have known they sowed a circle there", he inveighed, "everyone kept talking about their marriage these last few days, damn it."</p><p>"Hey, it wasn't your fault, I wasn't paying attention to where I was walking", Remus assured him, taken aback that Sirius wasn't blaming him, but himself. People tended to put the blame on witches, especially on Remus, and as much as this was an interesting change of things it was also entirely misplaced.</p><p>"What was taking up all your attention then?" There was no other way to describe Sirius' expression than suggestive and Remus knew that he'd noticed him staring earlier.</p><p>"Uhm, well..." He rubbed at his neck. "Remember when you said how you haven't seen any humans in Ank'luÄ‘osh in years?"</p><p>"Duh, I might have a smaller brain than you, but my memory ain't shorter."</p><p>"Woah, no offense."</p><p>"None taken."</p><p>"Good." Remus fiddled with one of the little iron tools that hung from his belt. "Well, most of the books about magical creatures are therefore very old. I've read many of them, about gnomes and werewolves and of course about pixies as well."</p><p>"I guess that's where I come in."</p><p>"Exactly. I've come across a debate, where different authors have different opinions about you and your folk. Naturally I've been wondering, which of the pixie origin stories is true? Did you die and were too average for the afterlife, or were you shrinked into Christianity?"</p><p>Sirius snorted. "Did your mother throw you head first into the shredder or did you fuck someone with knives for hands?"</p><p>"I see your point. Personal question"</p><p>Sirius nodded, absentminded. "I like the scars though, just so you know."</p><p>"Oh..."</p><p>"Can I ask you a less personal question?"</p><p>It was probably only fair, since Remus had started with quite an insensitive one. "Sure."</p><p>"You mentioned what I said about no humans coming through here anymore. Sure, you're no ordinary human, but why did you come here?" Sirius sounded genuinely interested and so Remus started to open up about what had led him into the depths of Ank'luÄ‘osh.</p><p>"It's a shortcut."</p><p>"Are you shitting me right now?"</p><p>"No, it's the truth, I swear."</p><p>"You literally risk your life just to get home early?"</p><p>"Well, if you put it like that..."</p><p>"What the hell kinda job do you have that you have to get home so badly? Or is someone waiting there for you?" The second question came out a little quieter and faster, like an afterthought Sirius actually didn't want to think about.</p><p>"No one's waiting for me, I'm a witch, that's not a lifestyle many would want to have to deal with. I travel a lot. All over the country people have problems they want me to help them with. Natural problems, like birth and dying crops, magical problems, like a cursed well, or problems of the creature kind, usually gnomes and spirits. " Remus paused. Usually people pointed out their problem to him after this. The silence he was met with felt weird.</p><p>Finally, Sirius spoke. "You sounded like you were trying to advertise yourself and read off of a script." He laughed. "Or told your mum why you're still single." He wiped away a tiny tear. "Sorry, sorry, that's a really cool job, Remus. Honestly, I'd love to just wander through the world and do that. But this still doesn't explain why you went through the forest and not around it. Especially so far off the ideal path. Sure, you're a badass, I knew that from the moment I laid eyes on you, but...why?!"</p><p>"I'm just collecting some ingredients I need for a few specific potions."</p><p>Sirius' face lit up with something that could only be described as mischief. It almost completely superseded the human touch to his features, as if the pixie magic within him reacted to the prospect of causing chaos. The lines it carved suddenly made him look older than he should be. "Which things do you need for what kind of mixture?" There was too much thirst for details in this one question to have it seem like innocent curiosity.</p><p>Remus hesitated for a second. He knew his plants, but he feared he might get tempted to try whatever Sirius was gonna suggest to him. All for the sake of getting better, of course, even though you should stop reaching for impossible things at some point. "Some lavender for a Calming Draught, for example. It's quite popular with people with anxiety, therefore I have to stock up on it pretty regularly."</p><p>"Lavender. Now that's one common plant." The mischief retreated as quickly as it had come and Remus couldn't deny feeling a bit relieved.</p><p>"Why don't we rest for the rest of the night?", he suggested. "I don't know about you, but I've had quite the day and keeping this light shining isn't really helping."</p><p>"Of course, of course, why don't we..." Sirius looked around for a bit, his features back to normal. "Why don't we make camp by that tree over there? Get a real fire going, eat a bit, all that."</p><p>"Aren't you afraid I'll burn down the whole forest?" Remus could hear his own amusement.</p><p>"Nah, it'll be fine, we'll make a static one, secured with rocks", Sirius waved the question aside.</p><p>"We?" Before Remus could say any more, he spotted a neatly prepared fireplace that hadn't been there before.</p><p>"As you can see all you gotta do is light it on fire. If you can."</p><p>The teasing smirk sent a shiver down Remus' spine. With a few mumbled words he lit the pyre on fire with his left hand and let the one on his right hand die as the flames started licking into the cool air.</p><p>Next to him, Sirius settled down onto the moss covered ground. Seeing him sit there, with his tiny feet stretched out towards the fire and holding himself up with his hands propped behind his back, Remus felt like seeing for the first time just how small Sirius really was. Flitting around him at almost eye level had given him the advantage of seeming bigger in proximity. But now, down on the ground, with his height almost halved, he was just so damn small, an uncareful step by Remus could deal some serious damage.</p><p>Before that could happen, Remus set down his bag next to his staff and settled onto the moss as well.</p><p>"That made more noise than I expected", Sirius remarked, "are you wearing chain underwear or something?"</p><p>"I'm carrying more tools and vials on me than you'd expect, that makes for a good amount of rattling and clangour." He rummaged through his bag and pulled out some bread, dried meat and cheese. "Midnight snack?"</p><p>"Oh hell yes!" Sirius reached for the food, chuckled as he realized he wouldn't be able to hold onto any of it and proceeded to tear tiny chunks off of everything he was offered. "Thanks", he added, before he started to eat it to the last crumb. In a graceful way.</p><p>It was mildly confusing, because no one Remus had ever seen had been even remotely able to eat with their fingers while keeping up an elegant appearance. But he didn't ask about it, pixies were full of mysteries.</p><p>When he had finished his snack, Sirius stretched with a yawn. Not only did it crack very loudly, it also revealed part of a faded scar on his lower back that Remus could only see because he'd leaned back to stretch his legs.</p><p>"Did something attack you from behind?", he asked, gesturing to Sirius' back.</p><p>Sirius' answer was surprisingly neutral. "You mean the scar down there? I've got a couple of those on my back, probably got too close to a few twigs a few decades ago." He shrugged. "I usually forget about them. It gets too chilly here to fly around shirtless all the time. I mean yeah, scars are badass as fuck, but if you can't see them, who will be attracted to you because of them? No one."</p><p>"Try convincing other people of that", Remus sighed. "They always pity the hell out of me."</p><p>"You know my opinion, why would I pity you for looking like you took on some horrid beast and won?"</p><p>"You're making me look like some unsung hero." Remus chuckled. "It's the story behind them, I suppose. I've moved a few times, but someone always gets me to tell it and then it happens again." He paused, contemplating. "Wanna hear it? You're the first not to flinch when they see me for the fist time."</p><p>"Only if you feel comfortable telling me", Sirius said seriously.</p><p>"I was actually still pretty young, no godlike powers et cetera. Would that bother you?"</p><p>"Many things happen to kids that shouldn't happen to kids. Orphaned, attacked by a dragon, all the shit. I've seen and heard of a lot, I don't mind it."</p><p>Remus took a deep breath. "Alright.</p><p>My dad was...less open about magical creatures, especially about those who live in villages and cities among us. And one day he pissed one of them off. Cut to twelve hours later and the guy he attacked verbally attacks me physically.</p><p>I'd left our house to visit the dryads in the woods a few minutes from the outskirts of the city. They were really nice, always talked with me like I was an adult and not a child. But I couldn't find them that day.</p><p>The angry guy found me, though. Let himself drop from a tree and just...went for it. I thought I was gonna die. Later I realized that he wanted payback for what my dad had done, always being reminded of what he did when he looked at me. He was a cruel, sick bastard. The guy, not my dad.</p><p>When he'd left a few dryads found me and stitched me back together as good as they could and believe me, dryads are really good at fixing people."</p><p>Remus shrugged half-heartedly. "Since the guy was a werewolf I was lucky he didn't bite me, but the scars are irremovable. I guess that's when I started putting together all kinds of stuff for wound treatment and skincare, which became a slippery slope to becoming a witch.</p><p>Got the scars, got the job, that's apparently my origin story."</p><p>Sirius whistled. "That's quite the origin story."</p><p>Somewhere in the dark something made owl noises.</p><p>"I don't remember." It was less than a whisper, but Remus had heard it. "I don't remember how it happened. I'm pretty sure I had a different life before...this." Sirius gestured to himself. "Before I woke up in Euphemia and Fleamont's nest, wearing James' clothes. They'd found me by the river, half-drowned and naked."</p><p>Remus kept silent, the crackling of the fire the only sound for a while.</p><p>"I was happy with them, you know?" There was a quiver in Sirius' voice as he continued. "I had a family, a house. But a house is not a home, and when the only thing that held you there is gone, wiped out by a fucking incubus", he took a deep breath, tears were twinkling in his eyes, "you start wandering through the forest, questioning your existence and wishing for this damn hell of a journey to end." He was wiping at his eyes furiously.</p><p>Remus woke from his stunned state at the sudden motion and pulled his handkerchief from a pocket of his coat. Realizing that he could wrap the pixie twice with it, he tore a small pice off of the fabric and handed it to Sirius, who stared at him wide-eyed at the gesture, before taking it and blowing his nose.</p><p>"Shit, I never thought it'd be good to finally tell someone about this", he laughed. "Fuck." He dabbed at his eyes, sniffing. "Can I hug you?"</p><p>Without hesitation Remus opened his arms. "Come here."</p><p>With the softest of thuds and a relieved sigh Sirius floated up against Remus' collar bone. Supporting him there with his hands, so he didn't have to keep fluttering with his wings, the witch was reminded of what it was like to hold a stuffed animal close as a kid. Only that Sirius wasn't a stuffed animal, he was a breathing being with a heartbeat. Small, yes, but sturdier than cotton fluff.</p><p>"Mmh, you smell like vanilla and lavender." Sirius suddenly sounded sleepy. "And parchment and fire." Yet he made no move to fly away from where he was huddled against the crook of Remus' neck.</p><p>This, right here, was crossing an invisible line, Remus could feel it. It was one thing to share your trauma and nightmares, which was a pretty private move already. But if Sirius was to fall asleep on Remus...he wasn't sure if he deserved that kind of trust. So before the first snore could reach his ears, he gently lowered the pixie onto a patch of moss, where he curled up and muttered something under his breath before drifting off to sleep.</p><p>For a long while after that Remus sat there, watching the dark around the campfire and listening to the noises of Ank'luÄ‘osh, before sleep overcame his guard.</p><p>*****</p><p>When Remus opened his eyes as the sunlight was already filtering through the foliage above, the first thing he saw was Sirius, who was lying just a few inches from his face. He blinked a few times, but stayed put.</p><p>There was a smile on Sirius' face and before he did anything else he reached out and booped Remus on the nose, right where Remus knew a nasty scar was sitting.</p><p>"Sexy."</p><p>Remus smiled, the word seeping through the haze of sleep still clinging to him and comfortably settling in his stomach area, before detonating. "What?"</p><p>But Sirius just smiled at the way he scrunched his nose in confusion and stood up, stretching and shaking off the sluggishness of sleep. "I'll be back in a bit, just stay here." And with that he was gone.</p><p>Rubbing the last bits of sleep from his eyes, Remus finally sat up and stared at the still smouldering remains of the campfire. It was bizarre, wasn't it, to share so much with a stranger. And yet he hadn't been stabbed in his sleep. It dawned on him that not only Sirius, but any other being of the forest could have killed him while he'd carelessly dozed off. Shaking his head in disbelief at his own carelessness he checked if all his things where still where they were supposed to be and - seeing that they were - he helped himself to the last bits of his provisions and relieved himself in a bush.</p><p>"There you are, we've got to get going if we want to make it to your pumpkin-church-village before dusk",  Sirius greeted him as Remus returned.</p><p>"I'm ready to go." Remus hoisted his bag onto his shoulders and grabbed his staff. "Lead the way."</p><p>With Sirius taking the lead once more, they picked up a comfortable walking pace and after a while they came upon a creek that was cutting through the forest.</p><p>"We're pretty quick, this creek is one of the most memorable landmarks that'll lead us into a less dense part of the forest", Sirius explained. "Do you see the huge, dark fir tree ahead? That's when we've got about half the way from where we started today." He was smiling, but the prospect of their journey coming to an end seemed like a shadow over his bright mood.</p><p>"Well that's still quite a bit of way there, but if we keep our pace up we should have time for a little break right now, what do you think?", Remus proposed innocently. "I need some water weed and horse mint anyway, and if I'm not mistaken that's lavender over there."</p><p>The joy in Sirius' eyes sent a little flutter through Remus' stomach. He set down his bag and staff and started to untie his boots.</p><p>"I'll get you the lavender!"</p><p>Before Remus had even started rolling up his pant legs Sirius had already crossed the creek and was rummaging through the cluster of lavender plants Remus had spotted. With his legs exposed to the knees, Remus pulled three empty vials from his bag and waded through the fresh water. While cutting himself some horse mint and water weed, he kept glancing at Sirius, who was animatedly picking strands of lavender.</p><p>Neither of them were in a hurry to get this over with, so when they had finally filled all three vials it must have been noon already. It was hard to tell the passing of time with a foliage so thick still above them, but as they had dried themselves completely from being absolutely drenched and continued on their way to Remus' village, the trees stood further apart and more sunlight filtered through the leaves.</p><p>They had just passed the huge fir tree without mentioning it, as they heard laughter from ahead and someone barking "Be quiet!"</p><p>Remus started limping.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"Shh, get in here", Remus whispered and held open his coat, revealing a big pocket on the inside. "We can't let them see you."</p><p>Sirius did as he was told, but not without shooting him a last questioning look.</p><p>Remus closed his coat and limped on, actually using his staff to support a lot of his weight. Not a second too late, as a group of seven humans got into his view, who were also travelling along the creek, but in the other direction.</p><p>Most of them were openly carrying weapons and what seemed to be nets. Upon seeing Remus they slowed down and came to a stop in his way.</p><p>"Hey man, you seen anything out of the ordinary?", a burly woman asked, pointing at the woods around them with a heavy crossbow. Her voice sounded like gravel scraping over stone.</p><p>"Like what? Fae folk?"</p><p>"Anything abnormal; unicorns, pixies, witches and the likes. So yes, fae folk as well."</p><p>Remus was sure Sirius could feel his heart rate accelerate. Witches, too. That was one of the more recent additions to what the hunters considered prey and he was glad he'd emphasized his staff's purpose as a cane. "I'm sorry, but out here it's pretty rare to see any magical beeings. And I haven't gotten far in since..." He lifted his staff a bit and gave it a meaningful nod.</p><p>The other hunters murmured in agreement. It seemed quite possible that someone littered with scars would have kept a limp from whatever happened to him.</p><p>"Well, sometimes pixies do make their way out of the thick of the forest, you sure you didn't see any? They're small, but nasty."</p><p>She was eyeing Remus attentively and he could feel Sirius tense in his pocket.</p><p>"I've heard they're hard to spot, so maybe I passed one without knowing", the witch shrugged. "And if I did it didn't cause me any harm."</p><p>"If you see any, you let us know, hm? Help us clean the country." The woman gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder that carried enough force to almost send Remus to his knees. Her face split into an ill-fitting grin. "Have a good day, Sir."</p><p>Remus forced himself to smile back. "You too. And good luck." He kept an eye on them as they continued past him. The guy on the far right staggered a little.</p><p>As soon as the still quietly chattering group was out of earshot, Sirius piped up from his hiding place. "Why didn't you fight them?"</p><p>Remus opened his coat to let the pixie out. "Maybe you should face them next time, it'd cost your life, but then you'd know."</p><p>Sirius stayed uncharacteristically quiet for a moment, not climbing out of the pocket just yet.</p><p>"I didn't know they were also hunting witches." His face was so serious, Remus almost mistook it for someone else's. With a stunning display of upper body strength and arm muscles, Sirius pulled himself out of the pocket and flew onto Remus' shoulder.</p><p>"They won't be able to hunt anything today." This time the smile on Remus' lips was real. He could feel Sirius' curious gaze on him, but he kept watching where he was going.</p><p>"What did you do?"</p><p>"Oh, just a simple spell, really."</p><p>"What was it?"</p><p>"Do you really want to know?"</p><p>"Come ooon, tell meee."</p><p>"Okay, okay, here we go, are you ready?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"It was an insomnia spell. The first symptoms of sleep deprivation should have kicked in by now and they'll last for twenty-four hours. They won't catch shit."</p><p>"Remus, you sly bastard!" The admiration was evident in Sirius' voice and he gave Remus a small kiss on the cheek. "If we're lucky, maybe they'll come by Narcissa's Cave! That would be a win either way." He didn't seem to notice the blush that crept onto Remus' face, instead he started to ramble about how every being in the forest would give the hunters hell.</p><p>Slowly, the trees around them became more and more familiar to Remus. He could tell which correction of their direction Sirius would tell him before he did. But he didn't say anything, only tried to quell the dread that was starting to rise in his chest. Normally he'd be happy to return home, but parting from Sirius was a thought that didn't sit right with him.</p><p>Sirius stopped in the middle of how the fifth hunter would fall for the faeries as Remus came to a halt at the edge of the forest. They could see the village with the church in all its pumpkin glory. It was only a few hundred metres to the first house.</p><p>For a few moments, they just stood there, not saying a word and overlooking the area from their slightly elevated point of view. The setting sun didn't touch the horizon just yet, but soon the sky would be painted red.</p><p>Remus could swear he felt how Sirius prepared to hop off his shoulder and fly back into the depths of Ank'luÄ‘osh, never to be seen again, so he beat him to it. "Wanna tag along and see the pumpkin church up close?"</p><p>"I'm not really that big on religion..."</p><p>"Me neither, we could just skip that part and I invite you over for tea now?"</p><p>The amount of relief that can wash over a pixie, not much bigger than your hand, is indescribable. Sirius relaxed more than imperceptibly. "I'd love that." And after a short pause: "Does that mean I have to hide in your pocket again?"</p><p>Remus shook his head. "We - the people in this village - have been living so close to Ank'luÄ‘osh for so long, the occasional magical being isn't that much of an odd thing. Besides, not everyone is a hunter."</p><p>Sirius was beaming. "What are we waiting for, then? Let's get you home."</p><p>The dread that had been coiling up in Remus' bowels dissolved as he finally stepped out of the shadow of the woods with Sirius still sitting on his shoulder. The sight of his home seemed welcoming once more. As he walked past the first few people and none of them seemed to react to the pixie on Remus' shoulder, Sirius' nervosity made room for his excitement.</p><p>"I've never seen the houses of your kind up close, they're so big! And your clothes look funny, you probably put a shitton of work into those. Is that a dog?!"</p><p>The butcher's dog was stretched out in front of his store, lazily observing the street through eyes that were starting to whiten.</p><p>"Can I pet him?"</p><p>Remus crouched down next to the dog. "Hey Ted, can I introduce you to a new friend of mine?"</p><p>Ted lifted his head from his paws and made a little "Borf?" sound as he caught Sirius' scent. Curious he heaved himself up and got closer to inspect the tiny being that sat on the shoulder of his first mum's son.</p><p>The squirrely energy seemed to have left Sirius as he sat still, eyes wide in amazement. Carefully he reached out to pet the old dog's snout, burying his hands in the grey fur. He felt like someone had finally opened the door to an experience he'd been craving for so long.</p><p>It smelled different from the people who came to get food from his dad, but also not entirely like the other people, who only came very rarely. At first Ted had thought it would be another of the other people, but beneath that it smelled so very human.</p><p>Sirius had taken flight and was now ruffling the fur behind Ted's ears. "Can we keep him?"</p><p>Remus almost laughed, but the love in Sirius' eyes made him a little softer than he had intended. "He belongs to Doug and I'm pretty sure he wants to spend his last days with him. But I've been contemplating getting a dog at some point in the future, so if you wanna drop by..."</p><p>"You're right", Sirius agreed after a while. "And you can bet I'm gonna...visit if you do get a dog. I love dogs."</p><p>"Have you ever met any others than Ted?"</p><p>"I don't think so, but love at first sight is a thing, isn't it?" The tentative smirk on his face made Remus want to agree.</p><p>"Maybe. We should keep going, it's not that far anymore, but I think Ted here wants to go to sleep."</p><p>With a last smooch on the nose Sirius said his goodbyes to his dog love and reclaimed his place on Remus' shoulder.</p><p>Not long after they stood in front of a small house with a little garden all the way around that contained more herbs than flowers.</p><p>"That's it, home sweet home", Remus declared and unlocked the door.</p><p>Stowing his travel things away he kept an eye on how Sirius was flying through his house, curiously peeking through open doors and windows. After the time it took to properly arrive and prepare a little bit of dinner, Sirius returned to Remus and stated: "I like it."</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>"You have so many witch things in here."</p><p>"Well, that's the job. You want some?", Remus asked, gesturing to the food he had prepared himself.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Basically soup. Uhm, some mushrooms, garlic, onions, thyme and other herbs and spices."</p><p>Sirius sat down next to the bowl on the table. "When did you find the time to make this?"</p><p>"While you were busy snooping around I just threw some things together", Remus said, summoning the tiniest wooden spoon he owned.</p><p>With a face of high concentration, meaning with his tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth, Sirius managed to manoeuvre the still too big spoon into the soup and taste it.</p><p>"Remus, if becoming a witch hadn't worked out, you should have become a cook."</p><p>"Are you serious?"</p><p>"Always am."</p><p>Remus groaned, but left it at that and started eating as well. A well-spent moment of silence followed, as they both ignored the near comical attempts of Sirius doing his best to eat the mushroom soup.</p><p>"Alright, I'll just clean this up here and head to bed. It's been an exhausting journey." Remus stood up, gathering the things from the table and carrying them to the sink.</p><p>"Is there any way I can help?"</p><p>"No, just let me- fucking hell!" The dishes cluttered into the sink as Remus jerked his hand away from the still way too hot pot on the stove. "Shit! Bloody bastard! I should have fucking gotten the other damn pot. Motherfucker..." The spot on his hand was glowing red where it had been burned by the pot.</p><p>All of a sudden Sirius' hands were on the burn and a cold sensation rushed over Remus' arm. "There we go, that's better. I've never seen air so blue."</p><p>"I had it under control", Remus grumbled. Sirius was still holding his hand.</p><p>"Let's leave those alone and head to bed. That is, if you let me stay the night."</p><p>Before he knew it Remus found himself nodding and getting dragged to the bedroom by a pixie. But sinking into the sheets he knew it had been the right decision. His body was aching from his longer-than-planned walk and he was just tired.</p><p>"Sharing a bed, how scandalous." Sirius wiggled his eyebrows as he tucked himself in next to Remus.</p><p>"That depends on whether or not you plan to make a move", Remus mumbled, pulling the blanket up to his ears.</p><p>"Do you think I could stay for a while?" Sirius was staring at the ceiling, looking thoughtful. "Just a few days or something like that. I really do like it here."</p><p>The question pulled Remus from the edge of sleep. He thought about it. Maybe inviting a pixie in wasn't the best of ideas, but it was too late for that anyway. And Sirius seemed to be honest about it. He altogether didn't display any evil intentions. "Yeah, sure, stay as long as you want." And after a second he added a tiny confession. "I like having you around."</p><p>"I like being with you."</p><p>They fell silent again.</p><p>"Remus?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"Mhmm."</p><p>The tendrils of sleep were softly pulling him in and soon, he was asleep with nothing on his mind but happiness at the prospect of not being alone for a while.</p><p>*****</p><p>As Remus woke in the morning, he startled. There was a lot of black hair in his face and a grown person in his arms. As he tried to slowly pull away, they mumbled something incomprehensible and only held him tighter. There was a grown man in Remus's bed. And where was-</p><p>"Sirius?", Remus whispered.</p><p>The man stirred and grey eyes blinked up at him. "Hm? 's the matter?" He frowned. "Remus, why are you so tiny?"</p><p>Remus couldn't help but stare. He was holding what could only be a fullsized Sirius. How was that possible?</p><p>"Wait, did you shrink as well? Do you remember me?" Sirius was suddenly completely awake, eyes wide open in shock. "What the hell happened?"</p><p>"I didn't shrink. I- I think you grew", Remus managed to get out.</p><p>"Bullshit, if that happened my wings would..." Sirius craned his neck to look at his wings. They were gone. Slowly he turned back to face Remus. "They're gone", he whispered, as if he couldn't believe it and a single word would shatter what could only be a dream.</p><p>"And you're not glittering anymore."</p><p>"Did you do that?", Sirius asked carefully, feeling for his ears, that were no longer pointed.</p><p>Remus could only shake his head.</p><p>"Does that mean I'm- I'm not a pixie anymore?" Sirius sounded breathless. The possibility of this seeping into his consciousness.</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>With a sound of disbelief Sirius disentangled himself from Remus and jumped out of the bed to look at himself in the mirror that hung on the opposite wall of the room. "Holy shit", he kept muttering, before turning back to Remus. "I'm a full-grown, real human!"</p><p>"And naked", Remus added, sitting up and feeling himself blush a little at the sight.</p><p>"Doesn't seem to bother you though." Sirius grinned, not ashamed in the slightest. "I mean, you held me pretty close this morning if I say so myself."</p><p>With a huff, Remus crossed his arms. "You were the one who wouldn't let go."</p><p>Sirius didn't stop smiling as he climbed back onto the bed. "Instinct of someone who finally found someone to keep him company." He got even closer to Remus.</p><p>"Maybe", he agreed, his gaze flickering to Sirius's lips and back to his eyes.</p><p>"Or finally found a home", Sirius murmured, weaving his fingers into Remus's hair, their lips almost touching.</p><p>"Mhmm."</p><p>"Reached their destination."</p><p>And with that they kissed, pouring their warmth and affection into this gesture that sealed away the past and marked the beginning of something wonderful.</p></div>
