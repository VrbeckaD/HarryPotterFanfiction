<p>Gryffindors were arrogant and presumptuous, they always believed they were the best and had the highest sense of justice.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more false.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuffs were far too good, perhaps even devoid of personality.</p>
<p>The Ravenclaws were all "know-it-all".</p>
<p>Even towards people in her own house, she generally didn't feel sympathy.</p>
<p>The Slytherins knew how to be mean, hypocritical, infamous and evil. She was not.</p>
<p>Irene was sure of herself, was ambitious and devoted herself to her study with deep commitment.</p>
<p>She despised injustice, stupidity, arrogance and conceit. She knew how to be vindictive.</p>
<p>She knew why the hat had put her in the Slytherins: she was the black sheep of Hogwarts, even her own companions avoided her.<br/>_</p>
<p>Severus was exhausted.</p>
<p>He couldn't wait to finish his studies and run away as far as possibile from that school.</p>
<p>He hated Gryffindors, hated Potter, hated Black, hated all their friends. He had done nothing wrong to any of them, yet those morons did not stop tormenting him with their stupid jokes.</p>
<p>The fourth year was about to begin and more than anything else Severus wanted to spend his time in peace, together with Lily, who however seemed to forget him more every day.</p>
<p>He held onto his potion book as he boarded the train to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He hoped to spend a peaceful journey, reading that volume given to him by his mother: it was the new school potion book.</p>
<p>He hoped to meet Lily and spend time with her, he hoped to get to know something about her summer vacation.</p>
<p>Most of all he hoped to avoid the Marauders.</p>
<p>As soon as he thought of them, as if it were a curse, he saw them get on the wagon behind him.</p>
<p>"Look! There is Snivellus!" Potter exclaimed to his friends.</p>
<p>It was the end.</p>
<p>Severus began to run along the wagon, pushed all the girls and boys he found in his path. He was scared. He didn't want to start the new year like that.</p>
<p>He kept running away, hearing the threatening footsteps of the other boys who were chasing him.</p>
<p>Soon Black would have transfigured into a wolf and would smell her. He could no longer hide.</p>
<p>He reached the end of the wagon and, desperate, entered the last cabin of the train.<br/>_</p>
<p>Irene knew where to sit in order to safely spend the outward journey to Hogwarts. The last cabin on the train was her favorite. It was always silent, not too hot and never crowded.</p>
<p>She had just started reading her favorite Muggle novel when, suddenly, she saw Snape stumbling into her cabin.</p>
<p>She saw him fall and lose his book, which slid to the floor. He looked at her. Irene heard distant cries.</p>
<p>"Come on Snivellus, come and play with us!" Potter was screaming.</p>
<p>She detested Potter, detested his flea-covered friend, the lousy rat and the other strange and silent guy who was always with them.</p>
<p>She knew they loved to torment that boy. She didn't know them, but she always saw them around school.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry" she whispered to him, before casting a transfiguration spell on him: "Lapifors" she whispered. Then she grabbed the book and the rabbit and sat down composedly leafing through the potions book that Snape had dropped.</p>
<p>On the first page of the volume he read the writing left by the boy: "Property of the Half-Blood Prince". Interesting.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter Potter entered the cabin, followed by the dog.</p>
<p>"Hey you, freak, have you seen Snape?" Irene looked up visibly annoyed.</p>
<p>"Good morning to you, Mr. Potter. You are always very polite."</p>
<p>"Don't complain, I've been all too kind to you. Tell me where the brat is."</p>
<p>"I don't know, Mr. Potter. If it's a brat you're looking for then you'd better look in the mirror."</p>
<p>"You'll pay for this Crystall. Eat slugs!"</p>
<p>"Protego!"</p>
<p>Irene had time to defend herself and the spell bounced off the boy.</p>
<p>Immediately Potter vomited a disgusting snail and ran away embarrassed. Black growled at her.</p>
<p>"Ah tà tà tà" she replied to his snarl, showing her wand "you'd better walk away, my dear wolf, if you don't want me to turn you into a glass of water". The dog went away resorting to his friend.<br/>_</p>
<p>Irene took the rabbit, placed it on the armchair opposite her and transformed it back into human form. Severus shook his head and grabbed the book she held in his hands.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't touch what doesn't belong to you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<p>"I didn't ask for help!"</p>
<p>"However, you needed it. The next time you want to face your enemies on your own, don't run away from them like a coward. Anyway, now you owe me a favor, Mr. Prince."</p>
<p>"My name is not..." Severus tried to reply, but she didn't give him time to do it.</p>
<p>"You are free to leave" she replied. Severus said nothing. He took his things and went out, without noticing the amused smile on his companion's face.</p>
<p>Feeling calm at last, Severus found a free seat on the train where he could study his potions.</p>
<p>When he opened the book a surprise shocked him.</p>
<p>With a small spell Irene had signed the first page. She wrote: "The Prince's first mudblood knight, Irene Crystall."</p>
