  <span>Hallow’s Eve is supposed to be for trick or treating. John Dawlish considers it somewhat poetic that he ends up in Godric’s Hollow, at the scene of a murder that would have potentially been a more disastruous multiple homicide.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As it is, he seems to have landed in some sort of twisted fairy tale.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A deer,” he says brusquely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James Potter looks at him evenly. “A stag,” he corrects.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dawlish looks up from his notes and stares back at this man, a man who seems to have rolled out of bed and not bothered with his hair at all. Over yonder, holding a small toddler is Lily Potter, who seems perfectly calm for all that a Dark Wizard had invaded her home with the intent of murdering her entire family, herself included.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James Potter is, also, the picture of calm. He’s lost his wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, this stag,” says the new recruit that had come along. Babbitt, or something; Dawlish had only known the lass for a whole two hours. She’s fresh, dark-haired, and has enough potential to go on and do great things. “The stag just...charged at You-Know-Who.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Precisely so,” says Potter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nods and scribbles. “Did you see where it came from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where it went?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any idea why it would run at You-Know-Who and gore him straight through the eye?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter chuckles. “Who am I to question mother nature.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mother nature, all right. Dawlish has been an Auror for twenty years now, and James Potter has chosen a bad time to be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>terrible</span>
  </em>
  <span> liar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks again at Lily Potter. Shacklebolt is in charge of her questioning, not that he seems to be having any more success at getting a straight story out of her either. Granted, she had been upstairs with her son and would have seen little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Godric’s Hollow is a nice neighbourhood. Enough wizards and witches have settled here to make it fall under the ministry’s supervision, though that still makes it a hassle to deal with considering it is still very much a muggle neighbourhood. Legend states that Godric Gryffindor had been born here, not that any conclusive evidence has ever been found.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Potter house is also nice. It’s an older structure, but has enough room to house a family of three, with space to spare for another child and a half if the Potters are so inclined. The littlest Potter must be about a year now; Dawlish wouldn’t put it past the Potters to try for another wildly curly-haired sprog.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hopefully that one </span>
  <em>
    <span>wouldn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> catch the attention of an evil wizard set on making everyone’s lives miserable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least the house is intact. Mostly. The coroner has already removed the corpse, but through the opening where once had been a door, Dawlish can see the ransacked sitting room. The door itself has been blown off its hinges, likely the only way He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named could have gotten in, only to face James Potter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or, a stag, as it so happens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’d never seen this stag before?” his new partner—Boffett? Something with a B—asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could have,” says Potter. “I mean, they all look the same, right? Big, angry, antlers…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Barley-or-Barr nods along. “Perhaps a bit confused as to why they’re inside a human residence?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter smiles charmingly. “Exactly! You understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dawlish sighs. “We sure do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shacklebolt approaches, looking weary. Lily Potter goes to stand with her husband, who leans down and kisses the crown of their son’s head. The babe is awake, wide green eyes and mess of curls marking him as the perfect combination of his parents. In ten or so years, he’ll be starting Hogwarts, and Dawlish prays to God the child’s nothing like either of his parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except, Sirius Black is his Godfather, isn’t he? Well, there go Dawlish’s hopes and dreams. They were good while they lasted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lily! James!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And speak of the devil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius Black storms unto the scene. His motorbike is parked somewhere nearby; Dawlish spots it after a second. He motions for his men to let Black through, if only to save them all the trouble of a black eye and one arrested Black scion. He doesn’t need the headache today. Or ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you all right?” says Black. “Is Harry all right? I can’t believe—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re fine, Sirius,” says Mrs Potter. “It’s been a long night, Here, hold Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That seems to calm Black some, and his Godson—Merlin help them all, his Godson is </span>
  <em>
    <span>happy</span>
  </em>
  <span> to see him, smiling and giggling as Black tickles him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill</span>
  </em>
  <span> that rat—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter eyes Dawlish and Battle? Batts? “Best not to say that in front of the Aurors, Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To hell with that, Prongs, you could’ve all </span>
  <em>
    <span>been killed!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Prongs, eh? Well Dawlish is not going to dwell on that, and Barrett-Barnet-whathaveyou is looking a bit too keen-eyed over there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are their Secret Keeper, are you not?” says Barlow-Bennet-whatitis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Black sighs. He looks angry, too, which is never a good sign. “No, that’s the thing. I thought that would be too obvious. I asked Wormta—Peter to do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pettigrew?” she asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That rat, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now even the Potters look unhappy. They mustn’t have known, then, which probably had been thought best before all this had come crashing around them. It’s one hell of a way to root out the traitors in their ranks, certainly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’ve heard enough.” Dawlish beckons his minions. “Shacklebolt,” he looks at the girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Longbottom,” she provides.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right! Alice Longbottom. He narrows his eyes at her. Hadn’t she and her family survived an attack from Death Eaters some months ago? She, too, has an infant son, although for the life of him, Dawlish can’t recall the name. Her husband is still at St. Mungo’s with some injuries, but is otherwise unharmed. Apparently some giant black dog had appeared out of nowhere and flown at the assailants, not that anyone had ever figured out where the dog had come from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No wonder Longbottom has so many questions. The animal kingdom sure seems to have a vested interest in ruining You-Know-Who’s plans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A black dog. Dawlish throws a glance Black's way. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Padfoot</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Potter had called him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, he’s going to walk away. He’s going to walk away quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re done here.” he motions for them to come along. There’s only so much madness he can deal with in one evening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shacklebolt still looks pensive. He’s a bright lad, equally as fresh out of Hogwarts as Longbottom. Dawlish remembers being that young, so round-faced and full of ideas. Those ideas are exactly what had saved his arse a good couple of times over the years, paired with a good gut instinct for when to let things lie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clearly, Shacklebolt isn’t there yet. “Deer aren’t native to this area,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Longbottom throws him a look. “Kingsley, who are we to question the man who has quite literally murdered You-Know-Who on All Hallow’s Eve?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right. Dawlish smiles. They still have a ‘rat’ to go catch.</span>
