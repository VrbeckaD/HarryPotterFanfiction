    <p>Hello,<br/>          My Name Is Lily Jane Granger and I just recently graduated from Ilvermony School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. My Birthday is on April 11th, 1999 making me eighteen years old. I was born in New York, New York at St. Louise Hospital for Magical Persons. I have curly light brown hair that hangs down to the middle of my back and my eyes are a deep emerald like my father's. Have you ever heard of Hermione Jean Granger? Well she’s my mom and she’s raised me on her own (with help from my grandparents, of course) for the last eighteen years. I’ve never known my father. Mom says that he saved the world when he was barely my age, but she doesn’t go into much detail about him. She just gives me a small smile and tells me that they were the best of friends once and that she had to leave the UK right after she found out she was having a baby and she came to the United States with my Grandma and Grandpa Granger.</p>
<p>            I remember finding out that my mum was a witch when I was five years old. I had been playing dress up in my mom’s closet when I noticed a brown box tucked away in the far back corner of her closet. I have always been a rather curious child, so I decided to open her box and I saw a weird stick laying in the bottom of the box along with what looked to be a brown picture book of my mom and a couple guys I’ve never seen before. AND THE PICTURES MOVED! On the cover of the album there was a picture of a young girl and two boys, whom I assumed were a couple of friends of hers, they were smiling broadly, and each boy was on one side of the girl. When I looked closer at the picture I concluded that the girl in the picture was in fact my mom!  I saw the resemblance of what she looked like then and what I had started to look like. I never knew how much of my mom I resembled until that very moment. I looked at the two boys and I noticed that the boy on her right had short red hair, fair skin that had freckles laying across his face, and was slightly taller than my mum and the other boy. Then I looked at the boy on the left and instantly I felt drawn to the young boy who had raven black hair, a scar on his forehead and the same color eyes I have. I froze once I saw his eyes, but after a couple seconds I ran out of my mom’s room and told her what I had found. Surprisingly, she wasn’t shocked like I thought she would be. She took me by the hand, led me upstairs to her room and sat me on the bed while she went into her closet and brought out the box.</p>
<p>     “I think it’s time you learn the truth about your mom and dad.”, She had told me as she sat on the bed and began to explain everything to me. Long story short, she told me she had received a Hogwarts letter when she was eleven and that she had met my father and their best friend, Ron, on a train while she was looking for a toad named Trevor for a rather lonely boy, Neville.  She explained that the stick that was laying on the bottom of the box was a wand that produced magic when you uttered a spell. As an example, she pointed the wand at her pillow and uttered ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ and the pillow levitated in the air! It was at that moment, that I realized how much I wanted to be a witch. Each night my mom would tell me stories of the adventures she and her friends endured at Hogwarts, and no matter how many times she would recite them to me, I never got bored.  </p>
<p>            When I turned eleven, I received my letter of acceptance to Ilvermony School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and that’s where my journey began as a witch. I was sorted into the house of Pukwudgie where I met my two best friends, Oliver and Candace. Candace Lovell has dirty blonde hair that falls just beneath her shoulders and blue eyes that look as deep as an ocean while her skin is a light tan. She is a little taller than me, but shorter than Oliver. Oliver Carmichael has fair skin with freckles across face while his eyes are a light brown with a hint of gold in them and his hair is a red that you would see at dawn. He stands about 6’0”.<br/>But even though I have graduated (top of my class) I still feel like a part of me isn’t whole. Every day I look at the photograph of my father that mom gave me the day I found her box, and I can’t help but wonder what happened between him and mom nineteen years ago that caused them to separate from one another. Maybe, just maybe, it’s up to me to find out on my own.</p>
