    <p>“...why do you like Papa so much?”</p><p>Eva paused, her soft scratching of pen on parchment coming to a standstill.</p><p>“Oh?” She turned to the little boy sitting cross-legged on her desk. “Are you saying you don’t like your Papa?”</p><p></p><center>

</center><p>“NO!” He hugged his plushie as his eyes went wide, looking as horrified as a six-year-old could manage. “I LOVE Papa! But...you love Papa lots more, right? How come?”</p><p>Eva set down her pen, her playful smirk giving way to a patient smile. On the days he kept her company, V did his best to be polite, tempering his usual curiosity to watch her work in silence so as not to interrupt; however, the quiet only helped him stew in his thoughts, the unspoken questions bubbling and rising within him until one of them managed to surface.</p><p>“Well,” Eva started, folding her hands, “I love your father because he’s a wonderful person. He’s kind, and loving, and thoughtful. He works very hard at the Ministry, and here at home, but he always finds time to spend with us and make us laugh and smile. He cares about me as much as I care about him--he sits and listens to all of my stories, and he tells me all of his stories, too. He hugs me when I’m happy...but especially when I’m sad.”</p><p>“But you and me do that, too.”</p><p>“‘You and <em>I</em>.’”</p><p>“You and I.”</p><p>She hummed. “Vitale, do you remember when we read that story about the two princesses, and how we learned about different kinds of love?”</p><p>He paused for a moment, scrunching up his face in thought before nodding.</p><p>“It’s like that. I don’t love your Papa <em>more</em>, but he and I have a different kind of love. A grown-up love.”</p><p>“Like the princesses.”</p><p>“<em>Just</em> like the princesses,” she beamed, picking up her pen and turning back to her work. “And one day, when you grow up, you will love someone that way, too. Whoever that is will be a <em>very</em> lucky person.”</p><p>V buried his smile into the giant, cuddly head of his drake, knowing she was giving him a compliment even if he didn’t know exactly what it meant. A few moments later, and his expression had faded again into confusion, his brows wrinkling as they always did while he was trying to piece something together.</p><p>“If you and Papa are like the two princesses,” he puzzled, “which one of you turns into a dragon at night and which one moves the moon?”</p><p>It took every ounce of maternal restraint to keep herself from laughing.</p><p>Instead, Eva quirked an eyebrow, leaning in to whisper as if telling him a secret. “Would you like to read the story again and see if we can figure it out?”</p><p>The way his eyes lit up never failed to have her heart respond in kind.</p>
