  <span>Smirking, Ginny turned away towards the lake, kicked of the last of her clothing, bright purple knickers that made her bum look fantastic, according to Pansy, and then looked over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, joining me?” she asked coyly, starting to walk into the lake.</span>

  <span>Pansy was already pulling off her clothes.</span>
