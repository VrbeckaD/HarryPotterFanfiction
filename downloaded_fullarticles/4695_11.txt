    <p>“Are you <em>sure</em> you’re comfortable with side-along?” Scorpius’ mother leant in close to him, worry etched into the subtle lines of her face as she repeated the question he’d heard countless times over the previous week. “Absolutely certain?”</p><p>It took immense self-restraint not to roll his eyes and huff.</p><p>Scorpius settled for an exasperated sigh, reassuring his mother once more that side-along apparition would be perfectly fine. He knew that her concern was not without good reason, as this type of apparition required the strength of a powerful wizard and had devastating results if not performed correctly. He had heard enough stories of the horrors of splinching to understand what was going through his mother’s mind.</p><p>Despite the fact that his parents would endure the task without complaint for his sake, Scorpius was unwilling to put them through the agonising tedium of automobile travel. For them, he would deal with the discomfort of side-along.</p><p>Astoria Malfoy nodded in a resigned manner, straightening and calling to her husband. Draco appeared after a moment, fastening the buttons on his dark coat up to his throat as he descended the stairs. His posture and appearance were befitting of royalty – a habit no doubt formed in his youth, where cracks in one’s façade had had deadly potential. However, his facial expression showed support and affection as he gazed down at his son, silently asking the question already voiced by Astoria – giving Scorpius one final chance to change his mind.</p><p>During weary evening talks, her guard its most tenuous, Scorpius’ mother had hinted to him the kind of man Draco had once been. A few years his junior, at Hogwarts she had found him intimidating, cold, and closed off. She had only been convinced otherwise after giving voice to concerns about her sister, Daphne, being friends with the man. It appeared that Daphne had been privy to a more humane, benevolent side of him.</p><p>Scorpius suspected that a combination of entering into fatherhood and the loss of Draco’s own father had contributed to a change in his demeanour. Never had he been exposed to a disposition such as the one of which his mother spoke. To him, Draco was simply a loving, warm father. He never lied to his son and was firm when necessity required it, but his heart was open.</p><p>Travelling to platform nine and three-quarters was neither as terrifying nor as painful as Scorpius' imagination had predicted, though it was by no means pleasant. For the briefest of moments he felt suffocated: his father's arm was the only tangible object in existence as darkness pressed impossibly in on him and some incorporeal force attempted to squeeze him into a vessel in which no human could fit –</p><p>The feeling passed promptly when he felt solid ground beneath his feet, though a certain breathlessness remained. Scorpius gingerly released his father's arm, only just resisting the urge to feel for his limbs and instead deciding to visually confirm their continued attachment to him.</p><p>Draco gave him a fond, knowing look as Astoria appeared next to them with Scorpius' luggage in tow. It had been decided that friends of his parents would bring his beloved Barred Owl with their family to the platform, rather than risking apparition with him or tasking him with a flight halfway across England. Scorpius knew that neither of the latter options would find favour with the irritable owl.</p><p>They had arrived early, on a far corner of the platform, to ensure that there would be ample space for their safe travel – even if the particulars of their journey had not gone to plan. After lifting his suitcase onto the train, Scorpius waited in companionable silence with his parents, idly observing families streaming onto the platform and delighting in the reactions of excitable children who had evidently passed through the wall for the first time. He was entranced by the thick white steam that poured from the scarlet Hogwarts Express, imbuing the entire platform with a dreamy quality. In time, it rendered the surrounding occupants of the platform as mere indistinct figures, seeming to float through the air.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Scorpius noticed a flash of bright red hair bouncing through the vapour. He turned slightly, aware that his father had had the same reaction to the sight, and his eyes fell on two families he knew to be the Potters and the Weasleys: four adults – two with red hair vivid enough to be seen even through the mist – and five children, three of whom had matching red hair. The movement of the child who had caught his attention appeared to already be dressed in her Hogwarts robes. Scorpius strained his ears to listen to the group without drawing attention to himself.</p><p>“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” he heard Mr Weasley say loudly, “but no pressure.”</p><p>Scorpius’ eyebrows furrowed minutely, hoping that the man was joking. He had briefly spoken to his parents about his wish not to be sorted into Slytherin, as he felt that the House’s values didn’t suit him. They had understood, and welcomed his desire to be true to himself.</p><p>For a moment the steam thinned, and it became clear that the group were staring at Scorpius and his parents – his father in particular. His eyes flickered to his father’s face in time to see an unnamed emotion flit across it, which would have been undetectable if not for their proximity. Draco nodded curtly to the group standing some fifty yards away and turned to his son.</p><p>“Don’t try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!” Mrs Granger’s voice drifted through the mist, and Draco momentarily shut his eyes at the statement. Opening them, he stared into his son’s eyes in a way that always made Scorpius feel as if his father was reading his mind. Astoria silently moved to stand beside her husband.</p><p>“Scorpius,” Draco began in a low voice, “I want you to promise me that you won’t let anything anyone says get to you.”</p><p>“Of course I won’t, Dad. They're just words.” Draco’s piercing stare did not lift, but his face softened a little at his son’s words.</p><p>“If there’s anything you need, anything at all, send us an owl and we'll do what we can, okay?” Scorpius frowned at his father’s uncharacteristically grave face and his mother’s mute nod of agreement.</p><p>“I know, thank you.” Scorpius smiled a little in an attempt to lighten the mood, though he was all too aware that the train's departure was imminent.</p><p>Astoria’s lips twisted into a watery smile before she reached out to hug her son. “I love you, Scorp,” she whispered into his hair. “Don’t forget to write, won’t you?”</p><p>“I promise,” he replied, releasing her.</p><p>Draco bent a little to embrace his son. “You’ll have the time of your life, Scorp,” he said soothingly, sensing Scorpius’ nerves. “You’ll flourish there.”</p><p>“Thanks, Dad,” Scorpius muttered in return.</p><p>Within minutes Scorpius had stepped onto the train, feeling an exhilarated fluttering in his stomach as he waved goodbye to his parents. Once their figures had faded into the distance, he turned to search for an empty carriage, with unbidden curiosity regarding a redheaded fellow first-year rising in the back of his mind.</p>
