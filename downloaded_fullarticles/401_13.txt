    <p>Chapter 1: The Safe House</p>
<p>Some days, Severus Snape could barely muster the energy to erase his footprints in the snow.</p>
<p>There were too few of their clan to patrol an area this large, too few to try to keep Hogwarts invisible for another day, another month. Another year. Powerful they each might be in his or her own right, and even more powerful together, but the task was large, the threat from without larger still.</p>
<p>He ducked inside the barrier, shaking the snow off his cloak, and made his way to the safe house, one of Albus’ last and greatest gifts to the Order of the Phoenix. </p>
<p>Only now, the safe house protected the Protectors. Powerful witches and wizards willing to devote everything, every ounce of their energy, every second of their time, to keeping the magical enchantments protecting Hogwarts in place and to working around the clock to keep it out of the hands of the new Magical Properties arm of the Muggle Ministry.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic itself was no more. The source of the dissention, the misplaced trust, it had crumbled soon after discovery, splitting into a small faction that transitioned over to the Muggle government and a much larger faction that went underground, quickly breaking apart into working groups bent on protection and survival. Working groups small enough, agile enough, to strike and disperse quickly, to disappear and avoid detection.</p>
<p>“Severus – good. Come in and warm up – I’ve something to discuss with you.”</p>
<p>Snape hung his cape in the vestibule and turned to face Minerva McGonagall. She was their de facto leader, the heart of their clan, as strong and determined mentally as she was physically feeble.</p>
<p>The years since discovery had not been kind to her. Had not been kind to any of them. Winters were particularly hard, and the winter weather had taken an arctic turn these last few years. </p>
<p>He followed her through a narrow corridor, closing his eyes as they navigated the three quick ninety-degree turns with the reverse enchantments. Accustomed as he was to it, he still hated the feeling that he was walking on the ceiling. He opened his eyes as soon as they stepped out of the enchantment vector, and ignored the three doors with bright brass handles. Instead, he leaned against a portrait and passed into the tiny antechamber to the first of a half dozen secret meeting rooms inside this already secret house.</p>
<p>Minerva, bent forward over her three-footed cane, paused before a plain paneled wall and said “We need a place to discuss the Seeker Clan.”</p>
<p>An ornate door appeared with a handle dead center, but it was Minerva’s words, not the appearance of the door, that made Severus tense up. He followed her through the door, slid into one of the four chairs around the small table, and waited silently, on edge, while she sat, adjusted her glasses and leaned back, studying him silently.</p>
<p>“You need more sleep, Severus.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. He could argue, but what was the point? She was right – he did need more sleep. </p>
<p>She sighed and pursed her lips, looking through him as she gathered her thoughts.</p>
<p>“You’ve spoken with Potter, then?” he asked, impatient as the silence lengthened. </p>
<p>She nodded distractedly. “Harry was here today – earlier. You were on patrol.”</p>
<p>The discomfiture he’d felt since hearing her speak the name of Potter’s clan increased. The clan leaders seldom made direct contact. That Potter had come here – this close to Hogsmeade – told him that something major was afoot. Like all the others here, he knew Potter was a clan leader, knew the basics about his life, but hadn’t set eyes on the man in a decade.</p>
<p>“What the – ” He paused, reconsidered the expletive he’d been about to utter and held his tongue. Minerva doted on Potter as she always had, and he wouldn’t risk offending his friend and mentor. He folded his hands on the table and focused again on Minerva. “Why did Potter come in person instead of using the usual channels?” he asked.</p>
<p>She looked at him as if to say <i>Think!</i> and he frowned as he understood.</p>
<p>“He didn’t want his next-in-command to know,” he said. “But Granger and Weasley – surely….”</p>
<p>Minerva held up a hand, shaking her head. “He wants to send the children here,” she said. </p>
<p>“No.” Snape’s fisted his hands but managed to refrain from pounding them on the table. </p>
<p>“I believe that would be my decision, not yours,” Minerva stated, her voice level as she eyed him over her spectacles. “Though I do agree with you and told him the same. However….”</p>
<p>She paused, removed her glasses, and folded them on the table beside her, gazing across at him with clear blue eyes pale with age. </p>
<p>“Stop drawing this out – please,” he all but begged. “Just tell me what you want from me.”</p>
<p>What Minerva told him was not what he wanted to hear.</p>
<p>“You need to go to the Seeker clan, Severus. They need you – rather desperately – and we’ve kept you here to ourselves too long already.”</p>
<p>It was a scolding, a reproach, but a gentle one. They’d have let him go had he made the request. His skills as a Potions Master were needed elsewhere, but his value as a powerful wizard and a spy guaranteed him a place here. He schooled his features, forcing down the panic. He hadn’t been outside of Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest in fourteen years.</p>
<p>“Severus?” Minerva reached across the table and placed her hand atop his. “Hear me out – please. I know this is difficult.”</p>
<p>“Difficult?” He laughed, though there was no humor in the sound that escaped his damaged throat. He coughed, cursing the scarring that had left him with only half a voice. “I know nothing of Potter and his clan – nothing but the name. I don’t even know where they <i>are</i>, Minerva, or what they do. I can’t – I cannot <i>leave</i>.”</p>
<p>His fingers were white beneath hers, and she placed a second hand atop his.</p>
<p>“Listen – hear me out, as I asked, and I will consider your wishes at that time.”</p>
<p>She crooked a finger, and a tea tray lifted off a small corner desk and spun its way over to them. He gaped at the act. Even here, behind wards so strong they endured after Albus’ death, they thought about each act of magic before casually flicking a wand, and performed as few as possible. </p>
<p>“Minerva – I hardly think this occasion warrants the use of – ” </p>
<p>“Shhh.” She poured then placed a cup at his elbow. “We are English, Severus. Sometimes we cannot wait for our tea.”</p>
<p>He sipped his. He didn’t remember the last time he’d had tea like this – the perfect temperature, the perfect strength. He supposed he was just imagining it, but allowed himself the luxury.</p>
<p>“They cannot detect magic they cannot see,” Minerva said. She nearly whispered, as if speaking the words aloud might somehow negate them. “We are just being cautious – we can allow ourselves an occasional treat.”</p>
<p>Hearing her words, no matter that he trusted her as he trusted no one else, did not ease his worry. “Tell me about Potter – about this clan of his. Where they are. Who’s with him. Why they need me.” Severus looked over his cup at Minerva, prepared to listen. He looked suspiciously at his cup then, and Minerva laughed.</p>
<p>“No, Severus. There is nothing in the tea except for echinacea. It’s soothing your throat and putting you in a marginally better mood.”</p>
<p>Severus sighed. She was right, but he didn’t like admitting it.</p>
<p>“Talk, Minerva.”</p>
<p>“You know I can’t tell you where they are or who is with him,” Minerva said. “You know the clan’s name already, and that Potter is its leader. That much all of us here can know. You guess at his second-in-command, but I can’t verify that yet, either. To know more, you must be bound to the clan.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me why they need me,” he insisted. The thought of being marked, yet again, was off-putting despite its necessity.</p>
<p>Minerva pursed her lips, considering. “The children,” she said at last. She spoke carefully, cautious lest the spell which bound her to each of the clans react to the information she shared. “There are problems with the children.”</p>
<p>Severus stared at her in confusion.</p>
<p>“There are problems with the children you believe <i>I</i> can resolve?” he asked. He threw his hands in the air. “You ask the wrong person, Minerva, as you well know. I am certainly not equipped to solve problems with children, least of all <i>Potter’s</i> children!”</p>
<p>“Oh – but you are, Severus.” She leaned back in her chair and regarded him steadily. He toyed with his teacup, refusing to meet her eye. </p>
<p>“Severus, you know I wouldn’t ask this of you unless it were important – very important.”</p>
<p>He swung his gaze upward at last, away from his potion-stained fingers. “You favor him, Minerva. You always have. Even more so than the rest of the Gryffindors. Even now – even now when houses mean <i>nothing</i>. When it is more dangerous to move about the Muggle world than it has ever been. When we dare not even utter the name of one of our founders outside of the strongest of Fideliuses. I am needed here, Minerva. There are too few of us as it is.”</p>
<p>His voice lost volume the longer he spoke, and he cleared his throat and took a swallow of tea, settling the cup shakily in its saucer and glaring at his friend.</p>
<p>“Yes. You’re needed here, Severus. We all are. But you are needed more there. Not forever – just until you are able to assess the situation and help resolve it. That’s all I can say now. If you agree to try – if only for two weeks – I can bind you, and I can lift the binding when you return, if you would like.”</p>
<p>“If I would like?” He stared at her, incredulous. “Of course I would <i>like</i>.”</p>
<p>Minerva sighed, but the look in her eyes was as fond as it was frustrated. “You’ll go, then? You’ll try to help them?”</p>
<p>“You know I can’t refuse you,” he nearly spat out. He turned over his wrist, the mere act indicating that he, too, was bound to a clan, to do what it required of him. “But you’ll need to cover my watches while I’m gone. The loch is particularly resistant to the Muggle repelling charms. We’ll soon be having squid for dinner if that beast doesn’t begin to behave himself and stay down out of sight.”</p>
<p>“Then we shall have a feast when you return,” she said. She held out a hand. “Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Will you at least tell me who besides Potter is in this clan?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I can’t Severus – you know that. But you know how the clans were formed. There will be members you expect, and some you don’t. But every single witch and wizard has the same goal as you do, Severus – to get back inside Hogwarts. To bring our children home. There are no enemies among our clans. Now please, give me your hand.”</p>
<p>He hesitated only a moment more, out of habit more than true reluctance, but finally, with another sign, extended his right hand. She cupped both of her own around his. There was power there still, in those aged, feeble hands, power he could feel like a vein of liquid sunlight warming his wrist, his elbow, his bicep. Her eyes were closed, her face serene. He could almost see through her papery thin eyelids. When had she grown so old? So careworn?</p>
<p>He felt the brand take form, a pinpoint of fire on his palm just below his thumb and when Minerva squeezed his hand and released it, he immediately turned it over, watching the tiny emblem – a Snitch, of <i>course</i> it would be a Snitch, fade from angry red to pale white to nothing, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Merlin he hated brands, but as brands went, this one, at least, would remain invisible forever, never to be seen again unless Minerva, or her successor, elected to undo the binding, and then, only briefly.</p>
<p>He would know now, every time he met another branded, when they shook hands, that he was in the presence of another like him. And he would know his own clan members at the first touch of fingers. It was a deceptively simple plan, so very Muggle-like in nature, to greet with an outstretched hand and in so-doing know the magical status anyone encountered.</p>
<p>“Harry is in Cokeworth,” Minerva said without preamble as Snape continued to stare at his hand. “The clan has apartments in a converted factory building near the river.”</p>
<p>“Cokeworth!” he spat, looking at her as if she’d just told him she was expecting triplets in the spring. “Cokeworth is hardly hidden, Minerva! And it’s full of people – and not the sort who would have an academic interest in magic! It is dirty place – polluted and crime-ridden. Why would Potter choose to locate his clan in Cokeworth? It is miserable there – for Muggles and Wizards alike. There are far more appropriate places for a wizard to hide.”</p>
<p>Minerva stayed silent while Severus ranted, pleased enough that they’d got this far – that he’d agreed to the binding, that she was free to tell him more. </p>
<p>“You hate the place so much, Severus?” she asked. “Your childhood home? Lily’s?”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to speak of it – of that hovel at Spinner’s End. </p>
<p>“Severus – it is not the rich or the powerful among us that need the protection the clans offer. It is the weak, the vulnerable. And those are the ones Harry seeks to protect. Those gifted with magic but who struggle to use it. Those without families to support them. Those who are most likely to falter if suspected, if questioned by the Ministry of Equality.” She paused as a look of horrified comprehension passed over his face, and lowered her voice. “It’s easier in Cokeworth, Severus. The British government overlooks it – in this, as in all things. In staying hidden all these years, you’ve been removed from life as most magical families in Britain have known it this past decade.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” he growled out. “I am no village idiot, Minerva. I see. I observe. I read the same sources you do. I see what has become of Hogsmeade. It is akin to the Native Americans, or the remote peoples of the Amazon, or even some tribes in Africa. They become caricatures of what they really are as they struggle to survive, to preserve their ways against the onslaught of humanity who ogle them from caravan windows.”</p>
<p>She looked away, pained, as always, when forced to think about Hogsmeade. About Diagon Alley. She eyed the tea tray, picked up a triangular piece of shortbread, and regarded it without interest before placing it on her saucer with a sigh.</p>
<p> “See Filius for the currency and documents you’ll need, and I’ll ask Kingsley to find you something appropriate to wear. You’ll have to Apparate down – several jumps, I suggest – you don’t want to walk into Hogsmeade and buy a train ticket – strangers don’t just walk into Hogsmeade unless they arrive there first by train, though the automobile thoroughfare may be finished within a year, Merlin help us. Poppy has a list of safe-houses you can use for brief recalibration stops. You know you cannot be seen Apparating by a Muggle.” She gave a sad sort of smile, and looked at him almost fondly. “I know it’s been a long while since you’ve undertaken such a long journey, Severus – and times have changed. Muggles won’t think they’re imagining things if they see someone pop into existence out of nowhere. If you are seen, you are likely to be reported. And if you are found to not be registered….”</p>
<p>“I will not be seen,” Severus stated flatly. “When does Potter expect me to arrive?”</p>
<p>She laughed though there was no humour in the sound. “He fully expects you to refuse, Severus. He is not <i>expecting</i> you at all.</p>
