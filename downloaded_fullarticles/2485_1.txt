    <p>The horses wouldn’t calm down. Credence had barely avoided being knocked down by large silver lined hooves several times, but finally he got ahold of the stallion's halter, and pulled his great head down firmly to lead him back into the stable. The door banged loudly against the wooden walls, its heavy iron bolt almost bent double from the strength of the gale that had blown it open, and released the great beasts into the field.</p><p>As he finally forced the lock into place, securing the horses inside, he felt the wind kick up again – an icy blast that foretold hail was on the way. The morning sun had tinged the thickly clouded sky a bold blood red. It made Credence’s stomach flip, so he hurried back inside. The horses' terrified screams and angry kicking were easily swept away with the winds.</p><p>“Wrap up warm, this storm's a bad one,” his grandmother sighed as she looked out of the window over the sink, bright yellow gloves sunk into the soapy water as she scrubbed at his grandfather’s breakfast bowl.</p><p>Credence grunted a reply, trying to fasten his freezing fingers around a mug full of fresh coffee without inadvertently burning himself. The timbers of the house groaned threateningly under the strain of the wind, the windows rattling in their panes. Even the fire crackling in the fireplace was struggling to warm the house, fighting against an unpredictable gale that kept forcing its way down the chimney.</p><p>Credence wrapped a thick scarf around his neck and pulled on an even thicker fleece, doing up the zip with aching hands before kissing his grandmother's cheek goodbye. She warned him not to take his bike, but the wind had suddenly died down and been replaced with a steadily growing assault of hail. If he cycled fast enough to the bus stop he might just avoid the next gale.</p><p>The farm path from his house to the main road was thick with wet, churned mud, and the hail beat down onto his exposed face and hands like needles.</p><p>When the wind kicked up again it gave a single vicious blast, the thin rubber grip on his bike tiers standing little chance as they skidded in the silt, shredding his knees as Credence found himself on all fours in the filth. He sat back on his heels with a pained whine. He felt himself pause for a moment, reflecting the damage he’d done to his hands when they’d slapped down to the ground in his fall. He took deep breaths to calm his mild shock, and looked around at the dense woodland that surrounded the path.</p><p>The heavy drum of the hailstones against the trees was almost hypnotic, and the deep red of the sky made Credence feel as though he’d fallen through into a different world, where no one else existed besides himself.</p><p>Maybe this was what it felt like to be some kind of ghost.</p><p>And then the strange isolated calm that had washed over him drained almost as quickly as it came on, and took the colour from his face with it.</p><p>A pair of large golden eyes were fixed on him from the depths of the trees. Predatory. Dangerous.</p><p>Almost human.</p><p>They were fairly far away, but their gaze was clearly fixed upon himself. He stood hastily, making sure not to look away; his heart hammering in his chest, his blood rushing through his ears, suddenly realising how very, very cold he was, the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck standing up.</p><p>But he’d risen too quickly, a jolt of pain shooting from his bloody knees making him keel over, a sound emitting from his throat like a wounded animal.</p><p>When he looked up the eyes were gone.</p>
