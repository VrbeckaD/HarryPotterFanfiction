    <p>”Morning Professor Potter, “ a familiar voice behind Harry said. He had been on his way to breakfast in the Great Hall, when he turned around on the stairs to face his colleague.</p>
<p>”Professor Longbottom,” he smirked. Neville grinned back and stepped beside him.</p>
<p>”Will we ever get used to this?” The Herbology professor sighed and looked dreamily to the charmed sky in the Great Hall which they just entered.</p>
<p>“I doubt it. Maybe if we reach Dumbledore’s age. Or Nicholas Flames’.” Harry looked up as well to the blue, white clouds patching it up. It was a very good day for flying.</p>
<p>Next to him, Neville snorted. ”I doubt you reach high-age with all the rubbish you eat.”<br/>
As a response he got an elbow to his ribs. ”I exercise enough!”</p>
<p>”Oi!” Neville hit Harry’s shoulder playfully. ”As if I wasn’t aware already.”</p>
<p>They both grinned at each other. Both were thinking of the time Neville nearly passed out the first time he had seen Harry in swimming shorts. Well, the first time since the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
<p>He even accused his friend every other day to have spelled the six-pack and muscle mass on with some charm. </p>
<p>They had mainly spent the first weeks of summer holidays after their first year of teaching at Hogwarts, only to take full advantage of their new status as Professors.</p>
<p>Neville had spent three years at a Herbology research farm somewhere in Asia - Harry couldn’t remember where exactly- before getting his mastery.<br/>
Harry on the other hand had travelled through a few countries, trying to learn more about wizard culture. </p>
<p>He had left Ron to Auror training, Hermione to her study-addiction and Ginny to find the love of her life during her stay in France with the Holyhead Harpies as a professional Quidditch player. His name was Laurent and if Ginny had not fallen in love with the handsome french wizard, then Harry probably would have. </p>
<p>Instead, Harry James Potter had released all the frustration and over-flowing energy he possessed after defeating Voldemort during his travels.<br/>
He had studied under the eyes of Masters of Defence in Japan, Thailand and South-Africa, had worked with course-breakers in Canada or had helped Charlie in Rumania with his Dragons. </p>
<p>When he came back after four years he felt no desire anymore to catch Dark Wizards, merely to settle down at the only place he ever called home. The headmistress McGonagall had been delighted to have him back as a teacher and refused to let him take over the Quidditch lessons.<br/>
Now, he was Professor for Defence against the Dark Arts and is was not even after his first week that he felt to have found the perfect job for himself.<br/>
As if there had ever been any other choice.</p>
<p>But not only had DADA Professor Sturlum left Hogwarts that year to take care of his younger sister, but Professor Sprout had finally given in and said ”Yes” to the wizard who had been courting her for several years. They were probably living on the countryside somewhere with the biggest garden anyone could have.<br/>
Harry had not minded in the least when Neville’s job application had been approved by McGonagall.</p>
<p>”I feel like something is going to happen today. It is too quiet.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. ”You will regret to have said that in not less than fours days. It as quiet as the last weeks and I would recommend to enjoy the days before the brats come back on Monday. I can’t believe the holidays are over already. Felt like a blur.”</p>
<p>Neville looked back at him and nodded in affirmation, as they approached the table, where only few teachers sat. McGonagall, Professors Sinistra, Flitwick, Grubby-Plank and Madame Pomfrey. The rest would have to join them later for the teachers conference. </p>
<p>“I know what you want to say, Harry. Not what I meant. I can feel it in my stomach. It is almost as if Snape is going to appear any second to scowl and take points for my abysmal potions.” Although Neville’s tone was light, Harry heard the slight worry.</p>
<p>”Dude, Snape is neither here, nor has he been your boggart for years. It’ll be fine, uncle Harry is here to protect you if anything happens,” teased the DADA Professor and patted the head next to him.</p>
<p>”Shut up, Scarhead.”</p>
<p>Harry inhaled sharply and obviously feigned to be hurt.<br/>
”That insult cut deep into my heart, love. It now lies shattered on the ground.”</p>
<p>The other teachers chuckled at Harry and Neville’s show and exchanged morning pleasantries with them. They were occupied soon enough, because even at breakfast the teachers could not let go of their passion for their subjects.<br/>
While Neville was involved in a discussion with Madame Pomfrey about healing plants and also Filius Flitwick, who sat beside Harry, started a conversation immediately.</p>
<p>”Good morning Harry. I must be forward with you and say that this new robe suits you very well. Green has always been your colour.”</p>
<p>”Thank you Filius. It was a present from Neville. Since I told him I had nearly been a Slytherin back as a student he can’t seem to stop making a laughing stock out of me. But at least I have these formidable new robes, so I am not complaining.”</p>
<p>Filius patted his hand. ”Well, well, if that isn’t a revelation. Oh just imagine Professor Snape’s face the moment he would have realized he had to counsel you!” Professor Sinistra giggled with them, having listened into their conversation.</p>
<p>”Severus has always been obvious about his animosity towards Harry, even after the battle. There hasn’t been a week without complaints about you, dear,” she said to Harry.<br/>
Then she sighed with an expression that showed how much she hadn’t been sharing the sentiment.<br/>
”I had no classes with you, Harry, but even I am sure you were no more an attention-seeking liar than today. He was surely exaggerating every little misbehavior. And he talks for hours!”</p>
<p>Feeling like she had been rating about her former colleague, she suddenly stopped. </p>
<p>Harry smirked. He knew full well how fast one could get angry with that man.<br/>
”I take it you were friends then?”</p>
<p>”Friends? Severus never had very good friends, I think.” Aurora Sinistra shook her had and smiled sadly. ”Although no one could ever say ’no’ to his tea. I do not know how he does it, probably due to his knowledge in potions and spying, but once you taste his tea, every other cup is only passable.”</p>
<p>While she spoke, Harry noticed, how Filius and Minerva, who had joined their conversation, nodded with a melancholic look on their faces.</p>
<p>Filius’ quirky voice squeaked: ”It is a pity he has yet to return from his research project. I do hope to taste his tea one day again.” </p>
<p>Harry noticed how Minerva smirked knowingly. In the end, if he hadn’t been in his vacation-mode and had spent a single thought more on this, he could have connected the dots. Neville had revealed his psychic abilities rather often in the past after all.<br/>
_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>”Before we begin with the ever so intense discussion of the schedule, I would like to speak about the most recent changes in our staff.” </p>
<p>Everyone from the round table looked up from their papers and focused on the headmistress. The teacher conference took place in a small room that severed as the teachers lounge, but was still rarely used.</p>
<p>”I am sure, he will be arriving soon, he was always a bit too dramatic. You all know the potions position had to be filled again, as Professor Moria’s application for Beauxbaton has been finally accepted. I wish her all good luck, because we all know how she missed her home country.”</p>
<p>A tiny knot in his stomach made Harry remind him, that he missed her greatly. She had been a friend of Fleur and they had often gone to Hogsmeade together to play Chaperone for the students. She promised to visit and had kissed him goodbye, knowing full well he was gay, but not minding in the least. French people.</p>
<p>A knock on the door of the staffs room brought him out of his sentimentality. </p>
<p>“Come in,” McGonagall said and not a moment later Harry nearly jumped to the ceiling.</p>
<p>Of course HE was the fill-in for the potions profession. His robes billowed as dramatically as ever behind him and Harry was reminded of Minerva’s comment earlier. It was true, Severus Snape always loved a dramatic entrance.</p>
<p>”Please excuse my tardiness, Headmistress. I got hold up by a house elf.”</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence in which nobody said anything, everybody merely stared, perhaps reminded of the absurdity of discussing the tea-making skills of their now-again colleague only earlier this morning. </p>
<p>Then he felt Neville and himself burst out into laughter at the same time, unable to hold back or take control over any of it.<br/>
Snape, startled, sneered at them, before he sat down at the empty seat next to the headmistress.<br/>
The sneer and the befuddled but also amused expressions of their colleagues made the youngest Professors laugh even harder and they both had to wipe away tears before excusing their behavior. Neville did not look at Harry lest they start again.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry, Professor Snape. We had no means to be rude. It was merely that we are very surprised by the fact that Neville here seems to have developed a sense for your presence, Sir. We were not told you were coming, yet Neville felt as if you would be with us shortly,“ Harry explained, trying to be as polite as possible. </p>
<p>Snape had hardly spoken with him after the battle and still shown how low he still thought of his student. Still, Harry had no intentions of picking a fight, knowing that they had to work at the same place, probably for the next years.</p>
<p>Severus Snape only nodded, his gaze shifting over the other Professors as if to dare them to comment, before resting on the headmistress.</p>
<p>McGonagall took the sign and continued her introduction.</p>
<p>”Thank you for joining us, Severus. I was just about to inform everybody of your come back.” </p>
<p>As she went on to the schedules as if nothing had happened at all, Neville leaned over to Harry, whispering:</p>
<p>”At least he can’t take points from Gryffindor if he catches us after curfew in the corridors.“<br/>
Harry grinned and snorted quietly. Winking conspiratorial at his best friend. </p>
<p>Still, Professor Longbottom might had slain a snake with a sword, but Harry could see his best friends hand tremble slightly, when Snape commented on the odd hours for Herbology lessons.</p>
<p>”I doubt the students need to be at the Herbology houses that early in the morning. Isn’t there another time for the Second years? They would benefit greatly with potions in the morning hours, because then during the lunch break they can cool down.”</p>
<p>Harry squeezed Neville’s twitching hand under the table for a second to give him strength.</p>
<p>”Y-yes, Professor Snape, surely there are also many benefits to have potions in the morning. H- however it is crucial to for the second years this term, because we will cover Mandrakes, who are most interesting in the morning. I would regret to take this opportunity away from the students as we won’t get them very often due to the ministry regulations.”</p>
<p>Harry smirked slightly, as did the other teachers. Filius even showed his sharp goblin-like teeth. Neville was a true Gryffindor after all.</p>
<p>”Well, then we must look for another possibility.” Snape turned to Flitwick, who immediately thought of several solutions.</p>
<p>After their staff meeting Harry felt Neville beside him relax immensely when they went down to the kitchen for a night snack.</p>
<p>”It won’t be that bad, Nev.” Neville shot him a look.</p>
<p>”I know. Still, it would have been nice to have a Snape-free Hogwarts for more than a year. Or at least a warning from McGona- I mean Minerva.”</p>
<p>Harry asked for extra marshmallows for Neville when they arrived, which gave his best friend a bit of a smile back. There were only two house elves working at the moment, the others took up other Hogwarts related duties over the holidays or simply cleaned parts of the castle that were not used very often.</p>
<p>”So do you feel okay? I mean, it must be very weird with your mother and him- you know,” Nev sipped his chocolate.</p>
<p>Harry put his mug down and frowned. He had not yet thought about the consequences.<br/>
”I don’t know. I guess we won’t talk much and he probably won’t want to speak about it. You know, when I gave him his memories back he had this look on his face… I just don’t know if he’ll ever like me.” He felt a knot in his stomach once again. The whole situation did not bode well.</p>
<p>”Yeah, mate I get it. I mean, it’s Snape. That bat is going to be in the Dungeons most of the time anyway and I doubt we’ll see him more often that we did as students.” Neville tried to cheer himself up. </p>
<p>Harry nodded. ”You’re right. School term will probably be nearly the same as last year.” He saw that Neville was also finished with his chocolate. When they had thanked the house elves for their late night work, Harry couldn’t help but feel much better.</p>
<p>”Race you to your quarters!” Harry shouted, before he started a sprint up the stairs. </p>
<p>Neville had him only ten feet away from the finish-line-door and was once again the winner.<br/>
They slid down the wall on to the floor to catch their breath from running, laughing and shouting all the way up. Several portraits had complained about the noise, but everybody knew they enjoyed seeing people having fun in the corridors every now and then.</p>
<p>”I’ll miss this, as soon as the students are back,” Harry grinned towards Neville, whose face slowly became less red from the strains and who had his eyes closed. The Herbology obsessor was too exhausted to answer, instead, he only hummed in affirmation.</p>
<p>”Well, good night then, Nev.” Harry slowly stood up, smirking when Neville hardly moved, still feeling weak. </p>
<p>”Night, Thumper,” said Neville before Harry turned around the corner and reminded him again of his abysmal nickname. He still smirked.</p>
