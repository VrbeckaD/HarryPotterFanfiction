    <p>'Do we have any milk around here?'</p><p>Remus turned the page as he reached the final sentence, continuing his reading onto the next. 'Finally following my advice and giving your liver a rest?'</p><p>Dakota grinned at him. He was a scruffy youngster, barely old enough for the peachfuzz he proudly sported on his pockmarked cheeks. He took teasing with equanimity, a quality that served him well in a den of pointier tempers. And he had a liking for Remus, which was more than anyone else could say. Remus was quite alone in his corner, most nights, with only the comfort of whichever book he'd managed to scrounge from their runs. Dakota had brought him his current one, a stolen library copy of <em>O Primo Basílio</em>. Remus didn't read Portuguese, but it occupied the brain, to pretend he was somewhere with nothing but a scholarly pursuit to fill his time. Nothing more urgent than a bit of summer reading.</p><p>'Might make a run, then,' Dakota said. 'Take a few of the boys.'</p><p>'Do what you like,' Remus told him shortly. He turned a page. 'Be back by nightfall.'</p><p>'Know the drill, guvnor. In't my first moon.'</p><p>'Might be your last if you don't leave me in peace.'</p><p>Dakota laughed. Only one brave or stupid enough to do that. Remus had put others in their place for less. Had to, to maintain control of the unruly packs. This close to so many tempting Muggle targets. He turned a page. His hand shook. 'For what do you need milk, anyway?'</p><p>'S'not for me, s'for Greyback.'</p><p>'Greyback?'</p><p>'Well, s'not for him, really, either. The little nugget he picked up.'</p><p>Remus raised his head at this. 'What?'</p><p>Too late, Dakota smelled trouble. He shifted guiltily. 'Thought you knew, sir,' he said, more respectfully, angling his head down and his eyes away. 'It was a few days ago.'</p><p>'Where is he.' Remus abandoned the book and stood, scanning the yard. His accustomed seat under the cloister gave him a vantage on the garth, and he made a swift head-count. Forty-six, forty-seven-- He took off at a ground-eating pace, Dakota reluctantly dogging at his heels. A raucous game of cards abruptly went silent as he passed, and whispers followed him, sensitive to trouble brewing. They'd had plenty of experience in it. By the time Remus clattered down the crumbling steps into the shade of the fallen arch on the south wall, every eye in the yard was on them, he and the man who sat on a ledge dandling a child on his knee.</p><p>Child. A black-haired child of three or four, thick spectacles perched on his runny nose.</p><p>'Think I might keep him,' Greyback said, giving the boy a little tickle. The child flinched away from his poke, fresh tears escaping down pale cheeks. 'Been a while since I had a young'un about.'</p><p>'Moony.' Peter. At his side, hand on his elbow, exerting cautionary pressure. Remus could barely feel it. The pounding of his heart was an overwhelming drumbeat in his chest, his ears. 'He wants you,' Peter said. 'The delegation's arrived.'</p><p>'See you for the moon,' Greyback smirked. 'Boss.'</p><p>'Moony.'</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked away. It was the hardest thing he'd ever done.</p><p>The monastery was somewhat worse for the wear since they'd taken it over three weeks ago. There was little reason to care for it, as it would be abandoned soon enough. The Muggle groundskeeper had spent a few nights locked in a cabinet before Tom had decided he preferred having a cook on staff-- Dark cohorts had many skills, but they hadn't added an ally who could competently fry fish as of yet. The old man shuffled about in the kitchen, blank-faced as he drained a pot of haricot verts into a sieve in the sink. A dead chicken lay on a cutting board, severed neck dripping red. Peter stopped long enough to pick up the decanter of wine, carrying it with him through to the dining room. Remus made it as far as the door, stopped there by the weight in his stomach, in his heart.</p><p>'There you are, Moony. Honestly I don't know where you get to. But good you're here now-- come meet our guests.'</p><p>He did as he was bid. Peter had already taken his seat, having poured wine for those of their 'guests' who could imbibe. Remus sat at Tom's right, settling with a creak of leather jacket against the uncushioned wood. The jacket was the sort of absurd costuming that appealed to a teenager, though not nearly so bad as what Tom had chosen for himself. Every self-serious teenager in the world had a penchant for black at some point, but Tom had taken it to an absurd length, swathed in a velvet cape, tied to the chin with a black silk ascot, even his pale fingers decorated with rings of rare black stones with, so Tom claimed, mystical powers. The black sapphire, posed on Tom's right pointer finger where it cast a six-point star whenever it caught the light, had been the first acquisition, retrieved not long after they'd escaped the Chamber of Secrets with Tom newly repossessed of a body. Then they'd gone about the business of repossessing things that had never belonged to Tom at all, seeking treasures to steal whether it had to be done by stealth or by force. The black diamond pin in Tom's ascot and the opal eardrop had come from a dragon's hoard in South Wales. The dragon had met a grim fate, not being open to negotiation: they had a hoard of rare potions components, now. The groundskeeper's first assignment had been cooking the heart for Tom to consume, as he'd read doing so would grant him all the tongues of man and the gods. It had given him dyspepsia for the entire weekend.</p><p>At least the vampires appeared to share Tom's sense of the dramatic. There were four of them seated at the table, and five more scattered to cover the exits. The one nearest to Tom on the left came by his costume genuinely: he and his clothes were at least three centuries old, his justacorps of rotting damask giving off the mouldering scent of a creature that rarely emerged from his den. His companions were little better, all of them mildewed, thin and wan, weeks or even months from their last meal. Tom was getting better at identifying an audience who'd welcome his recruitment call.</p><p>'We do not meet with his kind,' lisped the vampire at Tom's left, glaring at Remus with blood-red eyes.</p><p>Tom covered Remus's hand with his. 'I understand the historic divisions between werewolves and vampires. But the time when there were resources enough to allow us to thrive in separation has gone. The Muggles and Wizardkind alike have destroyed the hunting grounds and consumed our resources like a plague of locusts stripping a corpse. Our corpses. For too long we've allowed our internal divisions to stop us from the one thing that might make us strong enough to rise against them. If we join together, join all our powers, we can strike at our enemies and bring them down.'</p><p>The culmination of Tom's impassioned speech was the groundskeeper arriving with a large tray. Slack-jawed, he set the tray in pride of place on the table before Tom, bending in an awkward bow before retreating. He didn't get far. Tom squeezed Remus's hand, nodding. Remus turned his head away as Peter stood. His wave summoned the groundskeeper back to the table. The Muggle tilted his head when ordered to, exposing his throat.</p><p>'But we can save the rest of this discussion for after supper,' Tom said urbanely. 'Please, don't stand on ceremony. Eat whilst it's warm.'</p><p>The vampires exchanged long looks of longing. 'Very generous,' said the leader, lisp strengthening as his eyeteeth responded to his hunger.</p><p>'Generosity between friends,' Tom replied sweetly. 'Moony, help yourself. You'll need your strength for the moon tonight.'</p><p>The vampires were surrounding the Muggle, who awaited his fate with no sign he understood what was happening to him. He went down without a sound. Remus closed his eyes.</p><p>'Eat your vegetables,' Tom said brightly, spooning a large serving of beans onto Remus's plate.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>'I wish you'd at least pretend to enjoy yourself, Moony,' Tom murmured, stroking tenderly through the hair over his temple.</p><p>Remus shifted his head on Tom's thigh to check his watch. 'It's nearly time,' he said.</p><p>'So impatient.' Tom pressed him back down and resumed his caress. 'You're always so eager to leave me. I'm inclined to pout about it. If I pout, will you scold me?'</p><p>'Whatever you'd like me to do, Tom.'</p><p>Tom released a heavy sigh somewhere above his head. 'You vex me,' he complained, leaning back against the headboard. 'With such a victory tonight I wanted to celebrate. Our army is growing! Soon we'll be strong enough to strike, and then it's only a matter of time. Won't you be happy then? I'd do anything to make you happy, dearest Moony.'</p><p>'I'm happy with you,' Remus said by rote.</p><p>'So sweet.' Tom threaded his fingers through Remus's hair. 'Greyback's been pushing his limits, Wormtail says.'</p><p>'He was alpha for a long time. He won't be content kneeling to another.'</p><p>'He'll content himself kneeling to me.' Tom's hold in his hair tightened. Then relaxed, and soothed, gentle once more, curving down the nape of his neck to the chain of the Moonflower Opal. 'You're contented,' Tom said. 'Sweet Moony.'</p><p>'It's nearly moon-rise. I need to go.'</p><p>Tom blew out a noisy sigh, and shoved Remus off his lap. 'You can be so tiresome. Fine. Go.'</p><p>He rose from the bed, already unbuttoning his shirt. Tom slouched back against the pillows, chewing a thumbnail as Remus undressed, tossing his clothes at the hamper. He shed his watch and, with a moment of hesitation, the gold band he wore on his right wrist. He dragged his fingertip over the scratched surface, but let it go decisively. He shrugged into the loose robe that awaited him, tying it at the waist. He picked up the smoking goblet that stood on a pewter tray-- the communion chalice, thanks to someone's idea of a joke. Or, who knew. It might have been meant as an honour. He stood at Tom Riddle's right hand, and at least some of their growing army took that seriously. He drank the Wolfsbane to the smoking dregs, gagging down the bitter syrup and bracing himself against the edge of the bureau, pulse pounding in his ears.</p><p>'What is it like?'</p><p>'What do you want me to say?'</p><p>'I only asked what it's like for you.'</p><p>'There's nothing to tell. It is what it is.'</p><p>'I only--'</p><p>'It's hell. That's what it's like. What the fuck do you want me to say?'</p><p>Tom paled. He picked at his fingernails, then abruptly yanked the jewellery from his fingers, his neck, flung his diamond cloak clasp to the carpet. Remus stopped him when he tried to rip out the opal eardrop, smearing away a bead of blood and enfolding Tom to his chest. 'Shh,' he said, 'don't do that. There's no good being upset.'</p><p>'You vex me,' Tom mumbled tremulously. 'I don't know why you vex me so much.'</p><p>'I'm sorry. I won't do it again.'</p><p>'I just wanted--'</p><p>'I know.' He picked up the gems scattered on the floor, pocketing them in the robe as he sat on the edge of the bed. He wrapped his arm about Tom's shoulder, and Tom shuddered against him. Remus soothed him, staring at the wall.</p><p>'You should go,' Tom whispered. 'The wolves will be waiting on you.'</p><p>Some may have already begun their transformation. The moon was visible in the sky, out the window. Full, yellow, low on the purpling horizon. A menace making its way towards the stars, where it would watch them ride out to commit their horrors. And then they'd be gone tomorrow, off to a new hide away by some unfortunate village, waiting for the next opportunity to strike.</p><p>'Wait,' Tom said, as Remus stood. 'Kiss me good night.'</p><p>Tom's wrinkled forehead smoothed under his thumb. 'Sleep well,' Remus told him, and bent to brush his mouth over the same spot. 'I'll see you again in the morning.'</p><p>'I'll have your favourite breakfast for you.'</p><p>'You fed the cook to the vampires,' Remus reminded him, and rose to go. 'Good night, Tom. Rest easy. You're another night closer to your dreams.'</p><p>Peter loitered waiting in the corridor. 'You want me with you?' he asked, looking up from his watch. 'There's getting to be too many for you to watch them all at once.'</p><p>'Two was too many for me to watch all at once,' Remus told him shortly, turning right up the corridor towards the cloister. Already he could hear the screams of men and women gripped by the curse. Those screams would be howls shortly. 'How long before the Aurors track us? A group this large can't hide forever. All it takes is one Auror who follows a werewolf home to its lair instead of killing it on sight.'</p><p>'They know where we are,' Peter said. 'We're allowed to exist. There have always been those in the Ministry who turn a blind eye, for money or favours. Some even believe.' Peter trailed him, scurrying to keep up with Remus's longer legs. 'I know this isn't the way you want to do it--'</p><p>'You don't know me,' Remus told him tightly, lengthening his stride even more. 'You know nothing about me.'</p><p>'Moony.'</p><p>He whirled with a fist raised. Peter flinched, throwing up an arm to protect himself. Coward, Remus thought, but even as he thought it the fire died, and he let his hand fall. What did it matter? Nothing. Nothing at all.</p><p>He touched the jewels in his pocket. Tugged a loose thread free from the pocket's seam, wrapping it tight around his finger till it numbed. The moon was calling.</p><p>'Get inside,' he said dully. 'And make sure they ward the doors properly. I don't want a repeat of the last moon.'</p><p>Peter swallowed hard. 'I'll take care of it myself.'</p><p>He stepped through an arch into the moonlight. Silver on his skin. It burnt like ice. Another step, on legs gone rubbery, into the shelter of an old elm that shielded him just a moment longer. He set his shoulder to the thick trunk, let it hold him up as the moonlight thrummed through him, re-weaving him into something else--</p><p>He fumbled the ring from his pocket, the black sapphire. The rest he left in the robe as he shed it to the grass. He drew a few deep breaths, for courage, unable to stop himself, sucking at air gone soupy in his lungs. One minute more. One minute more--</p><p>But then the moon took him, and there was nothing more he could do but wait for the sunrise.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>**</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The tawny owl that tapped at the window startled the man sleeping on the bed into a snort and a cough. Sirius rolled to bury his face in a mound of pillows, hurling one of them at the window. It took out a pair of empty bottles on the nightstand on its way to the carpet, and the clatter elicited a groan from the bed.</p><p>Regulus left his seat on the chair by the fire, stopping first to right the bottles and then to open the window. The owl delivered its letter, accepting a stale biscuit from the plate that had sat abandoned since Dobby had left it there for tea hours ago. Satisfied its task was complete, the owl winged away into the rising sun.</p><p>Regulus overturned the envelope, checking the return address to guage its urgency. It was the third letter from Albus Dumbledore in as many days. It had been as many days, however, since Sirius had left the bed. It didn't seem likely that would change today. Regulus set it on the pile with the rest of the post that had gone unopened during this most recent bender.</p><p>A rap at the door interrupted him as he was seating himself again. 'Come,' Regulus said softly, finishing his downward motion and taking up his book. The door creaked, just slightly, and there stood Harry, sleepy-eyed, hair mussed, in his terrycloth housecoat, feet bare in the summer warmth. Regulus patted the arm of the empty chair beside him, and Harry shuffled in.</p><p>'Dobby would bring you tea,' Regulus murmured, folding the book closed and letting it rest in his lap.</p><p>'I don't think he's awake yet.' Harry rubbed a fist at his eyes. Without his glasses he could do little but squint, but there was nothing new to see in the bed, anyway. A drunk who snored away another morning. Harry's youthful features wore a look too old for a thirteen year old boy. His fingers twitched towards the bed, then curled in a fist on his knee.</p><p>'Our father drank,' Regulus said. He rubbed the pages of the book against his thumb. He could feel such sensations only intermittently, his imperfect nerves that had been dead for nearly as long as the boy beside him had been alive. When he did it again, there was nothing but the faintest sensation, barely a tingle. 'Sirius is more like him, our father, than I am. I'm more like our mother. I feared that, growing up. I would lie awake at night wondering how the madness would come on me-- so slowly I'd fail to notice, or so quickly I'd never stand a chance against it. Sirius... he was a comfort to me then. He'd tell me we had a choice. That if we were strong we could choose, and it was the choice that mattered. We wouldn't be like them if we didn't want to be.'</p><p>'He'll be better when school starts,' Harry said. 'Won't he? He'll have to teach classes.'</p><p>'Maybe.'</p><p>They sat in silence for a time, watching the fire burn low. 'Ron said I could come over today,' Harry said, after several minutes had passed like that. 'Do you want to come? We'll play Quidditch. I know you were on your House team.'</p><p>'I don't think the Weasleys are very comfortable with me,' Regulus replied quietly. 'But thank you for the offer.'</p><p>'They just need to get to know you. You hardly leave the cottage.'</p><p>'Harry,' he said. 'You don't need to care after all of us. It's not your job.'</p><p>There was no answer to that. Harry had perfected selective deafness over the course of the summer. And, Regulus thought, the rest of them had perfected a selective blindness of their own. Harry looked careworn, in the growing light of day. He looked like he hadn't slept in a fortnight. He didn't look thirteen, not even the thirteen of a boy who'd done what he'd done at eleven and twelve and survived to see another birthday. A summer full of tutors and training had left little time for recreation as simple as a Quidditch game with friends. Harry's world was too much adults, these days, adults who told rather than listened. Adults who thought they knew best and weren't soliciting opinions. Regulus remembered that, in the hazy way he remembered his living years. He'd never been rebellious, like Sirius; he'd never fought his parents, never dared to tell them no. He'd imagined he respected them, loved them. Loved them enough to live with them, to die for them.</p><p>I don't wish that for you, he thought, looking at the boy who'd brought him back and given him another life to live. And maybe Harry was right, anyway. There was more than this.</p><p>'Do you think the Weasleys would let all of us come?'</p><p>Harry's head rose from contemplating the ashes. A tentative smile came over his mouth. 'Maybe we could bring a picnic?' he suggested. 'We have time to bake a cake. Well, for Dobby to bake a cake.'</p><p>'That's a good idea.' He set his book aside, and rose. 'Go wake Lyall. I'll take care of Sirius.'</p><p>'Okay.' Harry stood as well, and leant forward, squeezing Regulus tight enough for him to feel it, and holding long enough for Regulus to return it carefully, patting Harry's back gently. Harry left him with more skip in his step than Regulus had seen since July. Yes. This was good.</p><p>He palmed his wand, wrapping it carefully in his grip. His spells still tended to go wonky, but he had worked on this one only just the other day, a first-year spell he'd always had a particular propensity for-- an irony, given how he'd died, that his element had always been water.</p><p>'<em>Aguamenti,'</em> he cast, and a spout of water erupted from his wand, fountaining downward to drench his unfortunate victim. Sirius shot upright with a yell, vainly trying to fight off the water that was swiftly soaking him and his bed. He spluttered and gurgled against the current of it til Regulus decided he'd had enough, and cut the flow. Well, tried. It took a few extra <em>Finites</em>.</p><p>'The hell,' Sirius moaned at him, wiping his bedraggled hair off his face and sluicing water in all directions. 'Merlin's tit, did you dump half the Black Lake on me?'</p><p>'Not quite. I'd be happy to finish the job.'</p><p>'No!' Sirius flung out a hand to stop him, scrambling awkwardly in the soaked sheets to leave the bed. He hit the floor and kept on sinking, holding his head. 'Ohhh, bugger.'</p><p>'We're going out,' Regulus told him. 'All of us. That includes you.'</p><p>'Why, did we run out of Firewhiskey?'</p><p>'Good idea. Dobby,' Regulus called, and the house elf answered the summons as he always did, though he forgot himself enough to squawk his indignation when he saw the mess Regulus had made him. 'Er, sorry,' Regulus said. 'I'll clean that. I only meant to tell you to dump out all the liquor. Oh, and we need a cake. We're all going to the Weasleys' today.'</p><p>Dobby hid his grin behind his long ears. 'At once, Mister Black. Will Master Potter be needing soap for his bath?'</p><p>'He will,' Regulus answered on brother's behalf, since Sirius only glared. 'I suppose we could leave it up to him to decide whether he wants it here or in the actual tub.' The gesture Sirius made was not fit for polite company. Regulus bared his teeth in a grin of his own. 'Here it is, then.'</p><p>'No, damn you,' Sirius growled, hauling himself upright, swaying for a moment before he made good on his own two feet. 'Out of curiosity, which is admittedly not all that easy to feel past this raging headache, why are we doing this now instead of some other day?'</p><p>'Because your son deserves a good day.' Regulus considered his brother, wondering at him. 'That still means something to you, I see.'</p><p>'You're not holier than me, Reggikins.'</p><p>'Prove it.'</p><p>Those two words had been enough to spark battles between them from their infancy. Good for an invitation to raid the pantry, to prank their old house elf Kreacher, to read from the forbidden grimoires in the library. To duel, once they'd been on opposing sides at Hogwarts. That familiar belligerence was there in Sirius's face, summoned in a heartbeat, but just as quickly it faded, and a look he was becoming more familiar with these days replaced it.</p><p>'Don't be sorry,' Regulus cut him off. 'Just be there for him. For me.'</p><p>Sirius dug the heels of his hands into his eyes. 'Dobby,' he said quietly. 'I could really use one of your hangover cures.'</p><p>'Dobby will bring it, Master Potter,' the house elf promised. 'And a pot of coffee and some stale bread.' Dobby raised a hand, and lowered it. 'Mister Black swears he will clean the bed?' he asked Regulus.</p><p>'Mister Black swears,' Regulus promised, cocking an eyebrow at Sirius.</p><p>'Mister Black swears,' Sirius repeated glumly. 'After a bath. A real bath, you unbelievable wanker.'</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>'Can I ask you...'</p><p>Regulus let the wind drag him to a natural stop, relaxing his grip on the broom to flex his tingling fingers. 'You can ask,' he replied.</p><p>Ginny Weasley sat her broom with the ease of someone born to fly, and far too skilled to be relegated to defence, but that was the fate of the littlest Weasley and the deadest Black. Regulus shaded his eyes to watch Sirius and Harry battling it out over the Golden Snitch, before it escaped them to zip away. 'Do you get sunburnt?' Ginny blurted at him, and he turned his head towards her. 'Only I get a terrible sunburn too, my mum says I'm to stay in the shade one hour for every hour I'm out in the sun.'</p><p>Regulus smiled. 'I don't know,' he answered honestly. 'It's possible. I couldn't heal it, if I were to be.'</p><p>'So you're... you're really dead?'</p><p>'It's complicated,' he said.</p><p>'Oh.' Ginny sat back on her broom, cocking a freckled knee on the handle before her. 'It seems like everything is complicated, when it comes to Harry.'</p><p>'Harry would be the first to agree with you.'</p><p>'Gin.' It was Charlie Weasley, swooping down from the treetops to greet them with an easy grin. 'Mum's got lemonade and cake for everyone, if we call a time-out. Hi, Regulus.'</p><p>'Hi,' Regulus said, surprised to be directly addressed.</p><p>'Good time to show Harry the barn,' Charlie suggested to his sister. 'You know the Weasley boys and food-- everyone'll be distracted. Have him all to yourself for a private tour.'</p><p>Ginny's radiant blush answered well enough what was meant by that. She hurriedly removed herself, landing at a gallop and headed for the crowd of gingers at the impromptu lawn party. The ginger nearest Regulus, however, lingered in the air, apparently in no rush. Regulus waited on him, sensing an interrogation in the offing, wondering if it would be as sweet-natured as Ginny's. Suspecting it wouldn't be.</p><p>'You still consider yourself nineteen?' Charlie asked eventually, turning his chin up to a bit of errant breeze.</p><p>'I hadn't thought about it.'</p><p>'Suppose it's a long list you've got, things to think of now.'</p><p>'Suppose so.'</p><p>'You wanna go for a walk? There's a little lake nearby. We could fish for dinner.'</p><p>'I've never fished,' he said slowly. 'I think, anyway.'</p><p>'No time to learn like the present. Not that hard with magic, anyway, to be honest.'</p><p>'My spells are a little--'</p><p>'Not according to Sirius.' Charlie grinned, white teeth in a tanned face. He had Ginny's freckles, too, a scattering across his long nose and broad cheeks. 'We'll do it like Muggles, then, and you won't be any worse at it than I am.'</p><p>There was nothing for it but to follow Charlie down to ground. They left their broomsticks propped up against the shed, and Charlie made a quick run to his father's garage, returning with two long poles. He propped them both on a broad shoulder and nodded towards a footpath headed into the trees. 'Too bad you don't drink,' he added off-handedly. 'Fishing's better with beer.'</p><p>'I didn't drink before, either.'</p><p>'No? Never stole a sip from your dad's stash or paid an older student to get you a bottle from Hogsmeade?'</p><p>'I saw enough of it at home.' See enough of it, he thought, and did not say. Maybe Sirius would change. Maybe Sirius couldn't, and it wasn't his fault anyway.</p><p>'Look,' Charlie said suddenly, grabbing his wrist. He pointed, and Regulus turned his head, following the finger guiding his sight. He didn't resist when Charlie dragged him into the shelter of a shrub, knelt clumsily beside him and tried to see what he was meant to see.</p><p>'Perce and Oliver,' Charlie murmured against his cheek. 'Sneaking off to snog.'</p><p>Ah. He could see it, now he knew what he was seeing. Two boys sat together in the shade of a tree, twined in a loving embrace. They broke for air, to whisper sweetly to each other, hands clasped, lips seeking. Charlie whuffed a laugh, and tugged him away, and Regulus followed him back to the path.</p><p>'Nice to see someone happy,' Charlie commented, when they had left the boys behind out of earshot. 'Been precious little of that around here, since Bill.'</p><p>'Your brother?' The one who'd died in the Chamber. Regulus remembered.</p><p>'Sorry. I try not to be maudlin.'</p><p>'There's more than enough to mourn.'</p><p>'That's maudlin,' Charlie said. 'There's the lake, just up ahead. See the pier? We're headed for that.'</p><p>The 'pier' was only a few planks of wood jutting out over a weedy shoreline. Charlie led the way, and Regulus followed. He followed, too, when Charlie shed his shoes to the pier and sat so his legs hung off the edge and dangled his feet in the water. Regulus sat beside him, pleased to discover he could feel the cool lake water quite well, peculiar though it looked to see his pale flesh dragging little eddies through the wet as he swung his legs. Charlie set bait on the hooks, little plastic worms in unlikely neon colours. Regulus took a pole, and they cast the lines into the lake.</p><p>'You don't mind?' Regulus asked then. 'About your brother.'</p><p>'Bill?'</p><p>'Percy.'</p><p>'Nah.' Charlie shrugged. 'Take love where you find it, that's my motto. What about you? You mind?'</p><p>'Percy?'</p><p>'Sirius.'</p><p>'I would have once.' Sirius never talked about the past. Not even deep in drink. It could be that what Regulus remembered of their childhood was incorrect, or only half the truth, which would be more dangerous. Little of what he remembered was good, but he remembered Sirius, remembered the worship he'd felt once for his older brother, who had been everything handsome and resilient and wild, unbowed, when everything in their lives had striven to force them to kneel. 'But only because I would have believed love makes you weak.'</p><p>'And why would you have believed that?'</p><p>'It did make me weak. I loved our family. They didn't deserve it. I knew, but I loved them anyway.'</p><p>'I can't decide,' Charlie said. He tugged experimentally at his line, but left it in the water. 'If you're the most tragic person I've ever met, or just the most confused.'</p><p>Regulus considered that. 'Does it make much difference?'</p><p>Charlie whuffed another little laugh. 'No,' he said. 'No, not really.'</p><p>'Why are you talking to me?'</p><p>'You looked like someone interesting to talk to.'</p><p>'Am I, then?'</p><p>'Passing fair.'</p><p>Regulus suspected this was a weakness, too, but he could no more help than ever. He smiled. And then he laughed, for the first time since his return from the dead.</p><p>They never did catch any fish.</p><p>The Quidditch game had never resumed, it seemed, but the picnic had been suspended, too. Their return garnered no attention, as there was no-one left outside to see them coming in from the lake. Charlie shrugged it off, stowing away their poles and taking Regulus round the back to the kitchen. He nabbed himself a pudding from the pan that had been left to stand on the stove, offered one to Regulus and winked before retracting it. They proceeded towards the voices raised in argument in the Floo hall.</p><p>'You're not going,' Sirius was telling Harry. He was throwing on his coat, running a hand through his hair-- Regulus knew it for a sign of nerves. Sirius caught sight of him over Harry's head, but the sight of his brother brought no relief. 'Reg, take Harry home,' he called. 'Now.'</p><p>'I want to go with you!' Harry shouted. For a boy with a rather shy nature, Harry could make himself heard when he wished to. The Weasleys nearest him were wincing.</p><p>'What's going on?' Charlie asked his father. Mr Weasley stood watching with a troubled expression, his arms crossed over his chest, but he moved then, to take Harry by the shoulders.</p><p>'We'll watch him here,' he offered. 'He can stay as long as you need.'</p><p>'Thanks, Arthur, but he's safest at home. Scrimgeour's sending an Auror team to shore up the wards.' Sirius took Harry by the chin. 'Listen to me-- listen to me, Harry. You're to go straight inside and stay there. No peering out windows, no using the Floo, no asking Dobby to carry messages anywhere--'</p><p>'Sirius, I want to see him!'</p><p>'Get him home, Reg.'</p><p>'All right,' Regulus agreed, just to preserve the peace, but Harry threw him a look of betrayal that said he'd chosen wrong. 'I'm sorry, what's happened?'</p><p>'It's RJ,' Lyall said. 'They've found him.'</p><p>'And I want to see him!'</p><p>'They found Remus?' Regulus repeated dumbly.</p><p>'I'm going to the Ministry now,' Sirius said, taking the Floo powder pot Mrs Weasley extended. 'I don't know when I'll be back, there's bound to be questioning for hours, days--' His hand shook too much, and the first attempt at flinging the powder scattered it across the hearthstone instead of tossing it into the flames. Harry took his hand. He reached, this time, and threw in the powder for him. Sirius pulled him close, hiding his eyes in Harry's wild hair.</p><p>'Go,' Regulus told them. 'Go see him. You both-- all of you need to see him. Harry will be safest at the Ministry, and I'll-- I'll wait for you.'</p><p>Sirius nodded. His eyes were wet when he raised his head. He gripped Regulus's elbow, short and hard, and then guided Harry into the flames. 'Da, follow us, we'll wait on the other side,' he said. 'Reg--'</p><p>'Go,' Regulus urged him.</p><p>'Percy, I need to borrow Errol,' Ron hissed, not at all quietly, and the tense silence that had gripped the house vanished into chaos.</p><p>'No sending owls til we know whether we can talk about this,' Arthur warned his sons en masse, but went ignored, as they were disappearing in all directions, one fetching parchment and quill, one headed outdoors to the roost, the twins rampaging up the stairs already intensely conferencing. 'No telling any of these details to that not-so-secret society of yours!'</p><p>Regulus helped Lyall into the Floo, throwing the powder for him. 'You're going to the Ministry,' he reminded the old man. 'Say it when you're ready. Sirius will be there.' He stepped back, feeling the flash of heat as a momentary warmth on his skin, fading nearly too quickly to be sure it was real. Then Mr Weasley was politely bumping Regulus out of the way, kneeling on the stones to Firecall Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>'Dobby can go see to the cottage,' the house elf told Regulus, tugging at his shirt sleeve. 'To secure the wards.'</p><p>'Thank you, Dobby. Can you take me as well?'</p><p>'I'll take you,' Charlie said, appearing from the kitchen with their shoes and coats. 'We can Floo through as soon as Dad's done.'</p><p>'I can sit in an empty house by myself.'</p><p>'Can, but won't be,' Charlie said, but though he was smiling he was quite serious. 'If Remus is back, who knows but that Tom Riddle's out there somewhere striking whilst we're all distracted. You're a target. And I'll be standing guard til we get those Aurors in place.' He put Regulus's shoes in front of him, pointed outwards ready to slide into, and slung his coat over his shoulders. This time Regulus was sure of the warmth, as Charlie's hands settled onto his shoulders, pressing lightly. 'Say "thank you, Charlie, you're a scholar and a gentleman."'</p><p>'I don't need protecting.'</p><p>'You're welcome anyway.' Charlie gave him a gentle squeeze. 'You look like you've seen a ghost. And I don't just mean your skintone.'</p><p>If he had a heartbeat left to thunder, it might have been thunder in his ears just then. As it was, there was something unhappy in his gut, worry and guilt and the sudden urge to go looking for a cupboard to hide in, as he'd done whenever Mother had gone on one of her ravings. He curled his hands into fists.</p><p>'If Remus is back... if Remus is back, they don't need me anymore,' he breathed.</p><p>'I promise that is not true.' Charlie met his eyes, so sincere that even that smallest of comforts seemed reasonable, as if Charlie had the power to promise anything at all and order the universe at will. Charlie squeezed him again. 'And more's the pity, Remus isn't really back. You know how it'll happen. They won't just release him from custody. Questioning's only the start. They'll need you more than ever, because they'll be absolutely wrecks, all of them. You'll be the one they can lean on.'</p><p>He pressed his hand to his stomach. To his chest, where the ache seemed to be, that impossibility. He managed a nod, though it felt like moving marble. 'Thank you.'</p><p>'Good man,' Charlie said. 'Let's get you home then.'</p><p> </p>
