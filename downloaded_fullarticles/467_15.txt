    <p>If you asked Molly Weasley, she would tell you it all started with a spoon, but I can assure you it did not.  If you asked George Weasley, he would probably disagree with his mother and helpfully point out it started with the final battle.  Shows how much he knows. I was there, this story is about me after all.  And I can assure you it started with the Inquisitorial Squad.</p><p>I was making my rounds on the fifth floor, charms corridor, when I stumbled upon a Mr. Fred Weasley putting the finishing touches on what I assumed to be the prank of the century.  I am frequently correct in these matters.  Less so than Granger, but Granger has never proclaimed to have the sight, so sometimes I do have a slight advantage.  </p><p>“Shouldn’t you be studying for NEWTs or something?” I ask, crossing my arms over my admittedly flat chest.  </p><p>“Shouldn’t you be off studying for OWLs?”</p><p>“It isn’t ladylike to get above average grades, I’ll manage an A or E on everything without losing any beauty sleep.”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I heard that real ladies never get an O in their life,” he sniggers, amused at the dirty joke of his own making.</p><p>“So, what are you and George planning?   This is rather elaborate, even for your track record.”  I gesture to the large number of glowing glass bottles placed along the corridor.  </p><p>“Who’s to say I’m not George?” he asks, quirking an eyebrow.</p><p>“Me.” I reply.  It’s an odd talent, but I can tell the twins apart no matter the time or place.  One of them happens to kick my heart into high gear, while the other is simply… like everyone else.  One of them lights up a room and pulls all of the oxygen from my lungs, and the other… might as well be Ron Weasley.   Who is decidedly less attractive than his twin brothers.  </p><p>“I’m surprised.  Well…. Just as a heads up, I wouldn’t touch any of those, and I’d avoid this area in the future.  You might need a nice little workaround if you need to get to Charms Class this way.”</p><p>“Noted,” I quirk an eyebrow at the green glowing orbs.  “Well…. Since you’re technically not breaking any of the rules…”</p><p>“We’re starting a shop,” he blurts out.   “It’s going to be a joke shop.”</p><p>“Bully for you,” I snort.  “I’m surprised you have the capital for it.”</p><p>“We’ve got quite the owl order business going already.  Don’t pretend you haven’t heard.  And a silent investor who has contributed to our nest egg.  We found the perfect spot just off Diagon.”</p><p>“Everyone knows you have to be on Diagon if you want to make it,” I sneer, hating myself just a little.   “You should save up to have the real deal.”</p><p>“Our products will speak for themselves, draw people off Diagon,” he protests.</p><p>“Sure…  I’m sure.” I say.  “I’ve always wondered what the two of you would do after graduation.”</p><p>“We aren’t waiting until then,” he says suddenly.  “Why do you think I’m not worried about NEWTs?”</p><p>“Wait, what?” I frown in confusion, snapping my eyes to his blue ones.  “You’re leaving?”</p><p>“Yup,” he brags, rocking back on his feet.</p><p>“When?” I gasp.</p><p>“Tomorrow,” he laughs. “This place is getting suffocating.”</p><p>I feel like I’m suffocating.  He’s leaving?  He’s leaving?  There is the very real possibility I will never see him again, which is… frankly… terrifying.  I want to change his mind, but I know that stubborn Weasley look on his face.  “Well, I hope I get to see you off,” I say instead.  “I’m sure it will be something to see.”</p><p>“You bet,” he winks at me. </p><p>“So… ummm…. Where’s George?” I ask after a beat.</p><p>“I think he’s off in the great hall?” Fred answers absently.  </p><p>“Well… um… best of luck… I’ll stop by that shop of yours… If it’s on Diagon, I suppose,” I finish awkwardly.</p><p>“What?  No detention?  No loss of house points?”</p><p>“What’s the point?  You said you’d be gone tomorrow,” I shrug.  He smiles at me.  That half grin with the dimple on the wrong side.  </p><p>“You know… you’re almost alright.  For a slytherin.”</p><p>“You can return the favor later,” I suggest with a scrunch of my nose and a turn on my heel.  </p><p> </p><p>I never make it to the great hall to see George.  I end up getting pulled into a mess with some third years, and being a prefect I can’t just back out and say, ‘you’re on your own, later suckers.’  Although, that would be rather nice in that sort of situation.  Instead, I help them to the hospital wing and pretend to be a good person while I’m seething and biting my nails on the inside.  </p><p>I never do get that last chance to see George Weasley off from Hogwarts.  The last I see of him is his (very sexy) behind riding off into the distance over the lake on his broom, high fiving his twin.  I sigh, hoping my next schoolgirl crush isn’t so intense, or heartbreakingly painful and embarrassing at the same time.  Hindsight being what it is, I can assure you it isn’t, but only because I don’t ever truly get over that gryffindork George Fabian Weasley.  </p><p> </p><p>I break down a mere week into summer.  I send my owl off with a  request for their catalog.  Their picture is right on the front, standing back to back wearing purple robes, their orange hair matching the orange of the magazine.  It’s annoying when the moving letters of WEASLEY’S WIZARDING WHEEZES scroll over his face every few minutes on their trek around the cover.  He’s so handsome.  I immediately remove the cover and pin it to my wall like a glorified quidditch poster.  My cover wizard winks at me and his brother sends me an irritating finger gun.  I spend a few days flipping through the catalog, wondering if I placed an order, if they would notice the name on the package, or think twice of me.  I daydream about him hand delivering it, saying he wanted to say hi, because he’d always secretly noticed me.  Daphne snorts and asks me what I would order in this scenario, because none of it is very romantic, or anything she can see me ordering without having completely lost my mind (which she points out in fairness that I apparently already have considering who I’ve been crushing on for the past year).  </p><p>It’s pathetic really, mooning over a guy two years older, in a rival house, who is so completely out of your league he doesn’t even know your name.  I’d be better off with a thing for Ron, who at least knows who I am.  George has never looked my way once.  Daphne laughed that I could dance naked outside his window, and he probably still wouldn’t notice me.  Which is unfair considering not all of us hit an early puberty like she did.  Or that horrible girl he took to the Yule ball last year.  Alicia Spinnet.  And her stupid hair, and her stupid boobs, and her stupid stupid lips.</p><p>I send off for some of their trick sweets and Fred actually sends me a little personal note with them, snarky as always.  "Didn’t know you were into this sort of thing.  I thought you preferred to eat slugs." </p><p>Must have heard about that one from Ron.  I wonder if George had heard as well.  That story doesn’t exactly put me in the best of lights, but I was very young.  Being friends with Draco has always gotten me in trouble as it were.   I owl back.</p><p>"There isn’t much in your catalog to catch the eye of a young witch, but I wanted to support your little endeavor. "</p><p>The reply I receive is rather rude.  "Sorry we don’t sell anything that catches your eye.  George would probably pimp himself out if he knew it was profitable."</p><p>I gasp.  He knows.  Instead, I decide to ignore the jab.  Instead, I mail one of my experimental potions back.  Serves him right.</p><p>Three days later, presumably when the effects have finally worn off, I get a reply.<br/>
"I spent two days infatuated with Miles Bletchey.  You’re a genius.  Have a business proposition for you."</p><p>And that’s really where this all started, because going into business with the Weasley’s is just one step away from getting into bed with one of them.  Just ask Potter.  He’s their other silent investor.</p><p> </p><p>Fred wanted to meet in person, and so we met for ice cream.  A muggle shop, not nearly as good as Fortescues, just outside of London.  He asked me what kind of experimental potions I had messed about with, and if they were all as clever as the one I had sent via owl.  Before I realized what was happening we were discussing an entire line of products, I was sketching out packaging on the back of a napkin with a conjured quill and pink ink.  </p><p>“This is brilliant, appeals to the mums in the store with their kids, the older girls too sophisticated for pranks.  It’s that oomph we needed to really expand our market into an entire physical shop.”</p><p>“What are you going to tell George?” I ask.  </p><p>“What do you want me to tell him?” he asks.</p><p>“I… I don’t want him to know it’s me.  I don’t… It’s not exactly the way I want him to notice me.  That love potion girl.”</p><p>“Fair enough.  Although I suspect your motives might be since you plan to use them on him at a later date?”</p><p>“FRED!” I protest, slapping his arm.  “No… it’s just… I don’t want to be that girl.  I want to be… I don’t know… the girl he sees walking by on the street and just has to say hello.”</p><p>“Umm… you have met my brother right?” asks Fred.</p><p>“In a manner of speaking.”</p><p>“You’ve met Ron though,” prods Fred.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“George is almost as dense as Ron about some things.  Took ages for him to notice Alicia had a thing for him.”</p><p>“Of course… I… Well… I’d just as soon be a silent partner.”</p><p>And that was how my line of Wonder Witch products started.  Fred took half the profits, and owled me the rest monthly, which to be honest was soon a pretty hefty sum.  My parents would say commerce is menial, and below us.  I would tell them the Malfoys have been in it for years, and while my family’s traditional place has been in the ministry either politically or with the department of Mysteries, my experiemental potions and charms are rather clever.  Besides, it’s not as if I put our name on it.  Although, the girl on the box does look a bit like me.</p><p> </p><p>I spent a couple hours every Hogsmead weekend going over the books with Fred in Madame Puddifoot’s.  We liked to go there for the frilly pink inspiration and the scones.  It was there we came up with Everlasting Lipstick, and it took me the rest of the semester to develop.  </p><p>We’d catch up, and I’d pass along the latest batches of product. I insisted on making it all myself, but I did allow him to package things for me.  He’d go over the books and give me a cheque for the latest of my shares.  It was all rather businesslike.  It wasn’t until the war really started that things became difficult.</p><p>The following summer, when the war broke out, my parents had decided to remain neutral, but we had close ties to people who were not.  Dad’s always been at St. Mungo’s and mum’s never worked a day in her life.  My older brothers who work in the ministry were told to keep their heads down and their ears on alert and to head home in case of danger.  Grandad finagled them foreign assignments within the first few months of the war, and soon, half my family was abroad, and I was headed back to Hogwarts.  </p><p>WWW switched over to OWL order after a close call raid in Diagon.  I owled everything to Fred, who owled it out.  We rarely met.  The first few Hogsmead weekends of the year, but then, those were canceled.  There were four arranged visits in the castle that he managed via the forbidden forest. He of course kept me up to date on the war at these visits.  I knew that everyone could tell him apart from George as easily as I could now.  </p><p>“I’m afraid,” he confided to me.  It was late April, and we were sitting in Hagrid’s hut.  It was unused since the teacher had left at the end of last term, following a blow out fight with the Carrows over the mistreatment of one of his creatures.  He’d gone off into the forest, and hasn’t been seen since.  But it made for a convenient place for Fred and me to meet.  </p><p>“Me too.  I… I can almost see what’s coming.   It isn’t good.”  My dreams had been filled with blood and green curses.  The most familiar thing about it all was that all of my dreams happened at Hogwarts.  Which at the time didn’t really make sense.  The dreams were a mix of reality and nightmare, and I wasn’t able to make heads or tails yet.  The worst were the ones of bodies, lined up in rows, mangled and faceless, wands still clutched in dead lifeless grasps.  I would wake up gasping for air after Millicent tossed a pillow my way.  Madame Pomphrey was getting suspicious about all the dreamless sleep I was asking for.  </p><p>Fred and I were good friends at this point, so he was familiar with my visions.  I’d gotten him out of a bind or two with them.  </p><p>“Well, for what it’s worth, Wonder Witch is still flying off the shelves.  You’ll be a very rich woman when this is all over.”</p><p>“Hell with that.  I was a rich woman before this all started.  My dowry is probably more than your rich old Auntie Muriel’s net worth.”</p><p>“Sometimes I forget you’re one of those.”</p><p>“So are you.  Your mum had a dowry.  Spent it all feeding your overgrown family, but she had one.”</p><p>“Hard to think of mum like that.”</p><p>“Your sister should have one too.  You’ll have to provide it as the well off brother,” I suggested. </p><p>“That’s a laugh.  Ginny would spit on the idea.”</p><p>“She’ll just end up marrying perfect Potter.  Their babies will be as reckless as they are,” I said, not fully acknowledging that I had indeed seen a vision to match that.</p><p>“If I survive the war, might find a nice girl, settle down, have a few brats.”  It was inevitable that we eventually came to this conversation.  We usually did.  I called it, what we’d do after the war. But tonight, it led somewhere new, somewhere… darker.  It might have been the whiskey, or the moonlight peeking in the window, or the fact that his entire family had recently gone into hiding, and mine was slowly pulling out roots and preparing to head for Europe as soon as I graduated.</p><p>“I’ve never seen that far for you… or me… I don’t tend to see things close to me.”</p><p>“So… you’re saying I’m going to die a virgin,” he complains into the whiskey he had found in Hagrid’s cupboards.  </p><p>“No….” I laugh into my drink.  </p><p>“There’s only one way to prevent this.” He announces.  He waves his arms in a grand gesture, and I worry he’s going to knock over our sole candle.</p><p>“My Wonder Witch Love products specifically don’t motivate people that far,” I point out helpfully.</p><p>“No… just pretend I’m George.  I’ll make it good for you, and I can go into battle knowing the love of a beautiful woman.”</p><p>“Stop being ridiculous.  I’d know it was you.  I always know it’s you.  And as much as… no… you’re… I’m not that drunk,” I protest with a giggle as he makes kissing noises.  </p><p>“It might be your only chance to get your hands on a Weasley twin, and I am the more intact model.  I’ve always had a thing for girls with dark curls.  And your tits have really worked their way from Acceptable to Outstanding this year.”  I look down at my chest, covered in several layers, but much more prominent than it was in previous years.  I have finally blossomed as my mother pointed out over Easter Holidays.</p><p>“Merlin, is this all wizards think about?  Tits and sex?” I scoff before tilting my head and looking at him with a calculating look.  He’s very handsome, and his hands are rough and calloused from his work, and his shoulders broad under the dark sweater.  His hair falls over his forehead in that attractive way men with messy hair always seem to manage.  He looks like George, but I know he’s not… and there isn’t that fluttery in my stomach when I look at him.  Just a nice comfortable attraction.</p><p>“Sometimes I think about killing you-know-who and what’s for lunch,” jokes Fred.  “Just to keep things interesting.”</p><p>“You’re terrible, but… I do really hate the idea of my first time being with some arse that my father finds for me overseas.  That’s the plan you know… marry me off to some Russian to get me away from this mess.  My brother works in the Ministry there as an ambassador.  He’s looking for someone who will suit.”</p><p>“So that’s a yes?” Fred’s eyebrows practically hit his hairline.</p><p>“Why not?  We’re friends after all.  Might as well muddle through this with someone you can laugh about it later with.”  I set my drink on the table, decision made. </p><p>“What about your thing for George?” he asks, stunned.</p><p>“What about it?  Nothing will ever come of it.”</p><p>“But… if it did, wouldn’t it be awkward?” he is red and uncomfortable as I pull my sweater over my head.</p><p>“But it won’t.  And besides, it isn’t as if we’d ever tell him that I shagged his twin and pretended it was him the whole time.  We both know you’re going to be pretending I’m my cousin the whole time.”  </p><p>Fred has confessed long ago he has a thing for my cousin, Hyacinth Bletchey who was in his year.  I joked that it was too bad I couldn’t set them up, but Hyacinth is overseas right now.  Her parents<br/>
managed to send her to South America to pursue a masters in Herbology.  They were worried about the Dark Lord’s return, and rightfully so.   We look a bit alike, both taking after our mothers.  We have the Selwyn looks.</p><p>“I don’t keep secrets from George,” Fred laughs nervously as I unbutton my blouse.  </p><p>“It’s not a secret if he never asks,” I whisper in his ear.  Somehow… I know that both of us aren’t going to survive this war, and I have a heavy feeling it’s going to be me.  There’s been a tone to the visions lately… a darkness.  As if some of the future I’m viewing through a veil.  My family has many unspeakables.  I’ve heard whispers of the veil.  I know what that means.</p><p>His freckled hands are tentative as he pulls away the rest of my clothes and lies me down in Hagrid’s giant bed.   I close my eyes and I can pretend it’s his brother, and he pulls my hair to his face and cries when it’s over and I know we needed this.  This one night to forget everything, and hold each other.  Because tomorrow isn’t a sure thing.  </p><p>We leave just before dawn, the magic of the night gone, replaced with our usual friendship.  I kiss him on the cheek, tracing my fingers over a few freckles along his brow. </p><p>“See you after graduation,” I say with a grin.  </p><p>“I’ll owl you the details, love,” he smiles back.</p><p>I hurry back to the dormitory and don’t think much of the whole thing until much later.  Because losing one’s virginity in the middle of a war to a good friend isn’t something you lose sleep over.  It’s something that reminds you you’re alive, but you don’t really think much on the consequences.  Being a seer, I should have thought more about how this would affect my future, but I’m typically more concerned with other people’s futures.  Like Harry Potter’s the night of the final battle.  Which I fled by the way, the slytherin that I am.  The opportunity presented itself, and I scurried away as quickly as possible, because the Dark Lord is great and terrible, and not really someone I’d like to ever meet thank you very much.  Let alone face down in a war.</p><p>I heard two days later.  And I cried for weeks.  Cried for the friend I had lost.   Cried for the brother he lost.  But mostly for me.  </p><p> </p><p>It was high summer by the time I realized what was going on.  Because I typically don’t keep track of that sort of thing.  There’s never been any reason to, and honestly, who looks forward to something that inconvenient.  And it’s always an inconvenience.  </p><p>So I didn’t really miss anything until I realized I’d been sick for two weeks, and could barely keep anything down, and yes… had missed my period.  And my tits were sore.  At that point, there wasn’t really a point in a pregnancy test.  When they say Weasleys were fertile, they weren’t kidding.  Which is rather… inconvenient.  Especially when said Weasley is dead.</p><p> </p><p>It was even more convenient that I had to be ‘tried’ for war crimes.  The ministry on a good day is bad enough, let alone a day where you’re dehydrated and nauseated, and haven’t eaten anything except pickles in three days because, for some reason that’s all you can keep down right now.  Luckily, I was quickly exonerated and able to escape the ministry mostly unscathed.  </p><p>Bastard children in pureblood society are frowned upon, but if the child is pureblooded… well.  That still pacified my parents after the war, although I knew to expect condemnation from the rest of the world.  I had my dowry, and my Wonder Witch profits.  I bought a townhouse off of Diagon, down on Horizant. Daphne came by frequently to complain about Theo, and Draco to complain about Potter, and Millie to complain about her cat.  But I no longer had my friend Fred to complain about his business, and his brothers, and his mum.</p>
