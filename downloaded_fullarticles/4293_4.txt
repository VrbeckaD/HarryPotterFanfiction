  <strong> <u>Mission 1.</u> </strong>
</p><p>This morning Draco had no idea he was going to end up in an office swivel chair in a dimly lit super-secret underground floor of the CIA, researching – well hacking really – anything this widely talented agent might need while conducting his mission. He’s already pulled up some background information on the target including current bank accounts, credit history, real estate holdings, analyzed the building blueprints, accessed the security systems, and planned three escape routes for him.</p><p>He’s doing this all in front of a large, state-of-the-art 3x3 set up of sleek touch screens all to monitor said agent’s point-of-view, aerial-view, immediate-surrounding-view, and further north-east-south-west-views, you know, depending on which direction the agent might turn. It really is a nice set up, much better than the single monitor he has, what, 6 floors up?</p><p>Draco looks up dubiously and realizes he probably should have paid more attention on where he was going when a scary armed man in all black and dark sunglasses plucked him out of his office and told him he was required “below.”</p><p>Oh, and there was an extra screen left over that he had decided to pull Grey’s Anatomy up on because McSteamy is appropriately named and he thought the agent was going to be doing boring things and America has such <em>great</em> scandalous shows.</p><p>Except the agent isn’t doing boring things at all.</p><p>Draco tries not to be impressed as the agent disarms three security guards with his bare hands all the while disassembling the guns he snatched from them in seconds, bullet cartridges clinking quietly on the tile floor as they’re emptied. This agent probably doesn’t need three escape routes. He’s following Draco’s directions to the T.</p><p>“Turn right, go down a long hallway, turn left, and the first door is a secret elevator that opens with code 80085, it’ll take you to the top floor where the target is.”</p><p>“80085?” the agent asks with a laugh, “you serious?”</p><p>“Yes, like BOOBS, don’t be so immature about it,” Draco responds snidely, ignoring the fact that he himself had snorted when he first deciphered it.</p><p>“Think the next code I run into will be 69?”</p><p>Draco checks, and dammit. It actually is.</p><p>“Why don’t you try it and see if it blows up on you?” suggests Draco.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re supposed to let me do that,” the agent says dubiously, casually using a silencer as quickly and efficiently as if it was a machine gun on six unsuspecting guards.</p><p>“Well, I’m not actually a handler so I wouldn’t know the rules,” Draco replies briskly, “and duck into this doorway right ahead. A patrol is passing through and they won’t be able to see you from their angle.”</p><p>The agent ducks into the doorway as instructed, and when the patrol passes by with a quick glance, seeing nothing, the agent murmurs “how the hell did you know that?”</p><p>“I coded your measurements into surveillance and overlaid it with all the eye-lines of the guards, and then mapped out all the different routes to your target to see which was fastest and which was safest and included the timing of the patrols,” answers Draco.</p><p>The agent whistles, “Where have they been keeping you?”</p><p>“I’m just a grunt hacker a couple floors up, all financials,” answers Draco, eyeing the north-view screen, where this agent was going to be in – he estimates how fast the agent is moving through the halls and checks the distance – 23 seconds.</p><p>“In 23 seconds you’re going to run into this big guy with knives he’s spinning around like batons, you want to detour or take him?” asks Draco.</p><p>“Which route did you pick?” asks the agent.</p><p>“What?” asks Draco, still eyeing the guy with knives, “20 seconds.”</p><p>“You said you mapped out my route, fastest and safest,” answers the agent, seemingly unconcerned that Draco was counting down to a potentially lethal situation, “which one did you pick?</p><p>“The fastest obviously, you don’t seem the type to need to safest,” answers Draco, realizing he’s answered the question himself.</p><p>15 seconds later the agent has made quick work the knife guy, and even slips two of the glinting blades into the cuffs of his impeccably tailored suit. The agent is wearing a dark cap, so Draco can’t make out the top part of his face, but can still see the glint of a cheeky smile when the agent raises his head and gives a security camera in the back corner of the hallway a little wave.</p><p>Draco imagines that when the building reviews the security footage (because unfortunately the system has been wired to be un-wipeable and the most Draco can do right now is just lock everyone out while he’s on it) after this fiasco it’ll seem like a taunt. Or an insane murderer saying I’m coming for you to haunt your nightmares.</p><p>“So what kind of time am I going for?” asks the agent, reaching the room with the elevator.</p><p>“It was 8 minutes, including 2-and-half-minutes of elevator time, but after you stopped to pick up souvenirs and wave at me so it’s now up to 10 minutes,” responds Draco, wondering if the agent was actually going to try 69 on the code inside the elevator. One code to open the elevator, one code to get it to the top floor.</p><p>Draco zooms in on the keypad with the camera in the elevator. Confident bastard doesn’t even hesitate and punches in 69. Doesn’t even flinch when it flashes a dangerous red and Draco briefly wonders if he’d seen it wrong and he’s killed this spectacular agent, before the elevator obediently starts climbing upwards.</p><p>“You know that was rigged to explode,” says Draco dryly, but thinking <em>this is fucking exciting</em>.</p><p>“Well, I didn’t think you were going to let me die,” the agent peers at the watch on his wrist, “after 6 whole minutes of hard work trying to keep me alive.”</p><p>Draco glances at the timer at the top of his screen.</p><p>It has been 6 minutes.</p><p>“Especially since you called my handler a complete imbecile and implied he was leading me into a death trap,” says the agent pleasantly, “If you’re just a grunt hacker how’d you end up on floor B12 anyways?”</p><p>Ah, B12. So Draco wasn’t 6 floors down. He was 12 floors down. The elevator probably moved twice as fast and he had miscalculated the trajectory.</p><p>How <em>did</em> Draco end up on floor B12?</p><p>Through a series of unfortunate, or fortunate events, depending on how you looked at it.</p><p>A couple years ago he’d been a bored aristocrat-in-training drinking $100 glasses of champagne from $1,000 crystal glasses in $10,000 suits attempting to avoid small talk with heiresses with $1,000,000 trust funds. He’d graduated from Harvard with a major in business and a minor in computer science. Business was dreadfully boring, but his father had insisted it was the only respectable degree for British nobility. His mother, bless her soul, had told him to study something he wanted to.</p><p>So Draco learned he liked computers and hacking. Especially when he realized he could skip all of his snooze-fest business classes by getting the exam questions off his professor’s desktops and just show up to ace finals to pass. After graduation he hadn’t thought to use his less-than-legal skills on anything else, until one of his father’s business partners got too drunk at one of the aforementioned dinner parties and tried to fondle him under the table. That had lost Sir Dolohov $5,000,000 from his account in the Cayman Islands, $1,000,000 for each of the fingers he had dared put on Draco’s leg.</p><p>In retrospect, Draco probably shouldn’t have donated it all to the CIA. He’d been a little drunk when he took the funds after tinkering with his iPhone, and had been alerted to a CNN article that said the CIA budget was being slashed due to transparency concerns. He had liked the time he spent in America, at Harvard. So much more than England and its stupid rules and responsibilities that came with being a Malfoy. So on a whim, he found some hidden accounts that had CIA written all over it and had dumped the money in under the transaction title “Thanks for the good memories, Amerrrrica” (give or take a few r's).</p><p>In retrospect, Draco had probably been completely wasted because he hadn’t even bothered to dispose of the iPhone after doing this, or cover any of his tracts. He’d just thought “let’s get in” forgetting about “without getting caught.” In fact, he’d woken up the next day remembering he had taken the money and had promptly forgotten where he had placed it – at least until 3 hours later when he was grabbed by 4 suited men and stuffed into a nondescript white van at the corner of his favorite coffee shop.</p><p>He’d then been taken on 8-hour plane ride before being led into an interrogation cell. He had first tried to explained what had happened, but then settled on just showing them how he had done it. After 3 psychiatrists came in and determined that Draco was not actually criminally insane, just lacking in self-control due to an overly pampered childhood, Draco was offered a job in their international financial crimes division.</p><p>“I don’t think my parents would approve of me working for the CIA,” Draco had said, secretly thinking that the job sounded interesting, realizing it would get him away from the tedium of dinner parties.</p><p>“Still doing everything mommy and daddy says,” one of the interrogators had sneered at him.</p><p>Draco blinked innocently at the idiot, “Considering I’m poised to inherit about oh, 50 million dollars, yes I generally try to keep up appearances.”</p><p>The woman who had offered him the job had promptly slapped that interrogator in the back of the head. Draco liked her immediately.</p><p>“We can get you in with a cover as an ambassador and base you in DC, especially because of your background.”</p><p>
  <strong>Awesome.</strong>
</p><p>Draco’s father would definitely approve. He’d accepted on the spot.</p><p>The job at the international financial crimes division wasn’t that challenging, so Draco spent most of his free time after finishing up his assignments just poking around everything he had the clearance to get into. Unofficially, he also poked into things he didn’t have the clearance to get into also, but nobody had to know that. Draco wasn’t going to forget “without getting caught,” at least when he was sober anyways.</p><p>Today he’d had one assignment, with a “Top Priority” stamp on it – indicating that he needed to get some financials on some shady conglomerate in Spain. It took him an extra couple minutes to get in and pull those but had sent it off without a second thought.</p><p>A couple hours later, the scary armed man in all black and dark sunglasses had entered their floor, held up the file, and commanded the “grunt who did this” to follow him. Draco had tried to duck behind the water cooler, knowing this couldn’t be anything good, but his traitor office mate had eagerly pointed him out. So he’d been unceremoniously hauled down to this floor, B12, and told to sit next to a tall thin man that honestly resembled an old twig and probably didn’t consume anything besides the hordes of energy drinks piled under and around his desk.</p><p>Draco did notice the man had a pretty sweet setup. Turns out, the man needed help getting into the conglomerate’s system and noticed Draco had gotten the financials pretty easily. Their security had been sent to locate him. The man was a handler for a real life CIA agent, directing said agent on what was rapidly unfolding into what had to be an assassination mission.</p><p>Draco was 100% sure he was not authorized to be anywhere near this but wisely kept his mouth shut until he realized this man was a complete imbecile and doing absolutely nothing efficient. The agent, bless his soul, didn’t seem to care and was willy nilly barreling through the building with no trouble at all – but still, the complete inelegance of the operation was causing Draco heart palpations until he couldn’t handle it and started barraging a ton of criticisms.</p><p>After Draco started shrieking “WHY THE FUCK DID YOU TELL HIM TO TURN RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT, <strong>LEFT IS CLEARLY THE BETTER OPTION</strong> HOW ARE YOU EVEN QUALIFIED TO DO THIS” right into the handler’s ear, the handler had thrown his headset at Draco and said “YOU DO IT THEN, I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS WHEN GRANGER ASKED ME TO DO THIS ONE MISSION.”</p><p>Draco had promptly plopped on the headset, told the agent he needed a minute to reconfigure everything, and then began re-directing the agent in a majorly superior way.</p><p>Over the course of 6 minutes, a couple people on B12 had gathered behind him and from the corner of his eye, he saw the glass doors of the overseeing office open, followed by sharp clacks of stilettos that promptly disbursed the crowd. Draco heard the shoes stop behind him and when his fingers stilled momentarily, was told “don’t stop on my account.”</p><p>Which brought him to this point, watching a lethal agent, Codename: Black, if the murmurs around him were anything to go by, relax in a 2-and-a-half-minute elevator ride before he’d have to avoid a barrage of actual machine guns poised on the elevator doors to get to the target, a man cowering behind what Draco recognized as a $50,000 gold-gilded armchair.</p><p>Draco thought he should probably say something.</p><p>About the chair that is.</p><p>“Your target’s hiding behind a $50,000 chair, any chance you can avoid riddling it with holes?”</p><p>Draco thought he heard the stilettoed woman behind him snort.</p><p>“No promises,” the agent responds. And just because of that, Draco doesn’t tell him about the machine guns until just as the elevator dings its arrival.</p><p>“Also you might want to duck.”</p><p>“FUCK!” blares through the headset and Draco winces. But, like he’d assumed but wasn’t actually <em>sure</em> would happen, the agent ducks to the side and completely avoids all the gunfire. Is it bad that Draco secretly wondered how the agent would handle a gunshot wound?</p><p>The agent tosses a flash grenade and then, almost as if to spite Draco, aims the gun right at the center of the beautiful armchair, shoots, leaps over the armchair, shots at the target again, and then, without missing a beat and before Draco can even tell him the best escape route, jumps through the glass windows.</p><p>Draco notices he jumped through the west-side windows, and feels the need to point out the south-west windows were the better option, closer to better landing ground.</p><p>“You didn’t think to tell me that earlier?” the agent asks darkly, twisting his body to avoid some gunfire trailing behind him.</p><p>“Sorry, not trained as a handler,” answers Draco, completely unapologetically.</p><p>“Who <strong>are</strong> you?” the agent asks, voice laced with admiration, interest, and humor again. The agent also finally peels off his cap so Draco can see his entire face from the drone camera flying dutifully besides him.</p><p>Draco freezes.</p><p>
  <strong>HOLY SHIT. </strong>
</p><p>Agent Black is <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter. </strong></p><p>Golden Boy extreme from boarding school. They’d gone to high school together. The guy had FUCKING BROKEN DRACO'S ARM and Draco had just helped him assassinate someone.</p><p>
  <strong>THIS WAS NOT HAPPENING.</strong>
</p><p>Draco tears off his headset and scrambles off the swivel chair. He barely notices the smile on the lips of a very stern and intimidating looking woman that has her grey hair pulled up into a severely tight bun in his haste to get off floor B12. At least someone was happy about what had just transpired because he was seething.</p><p><strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong>.</p><p>“Bye guys, let’s not <em>ever</em> do this <em>ever</em> again,” Draco announces, heading to the elevator only to be met with an unresponsive up button. He sees a panel to the side, flashing, taunting him with the swipe access he knows he doesn’t have.</p><p>He pulls out his keys and flips open the attached pocketknife. He makes quick work of the hidden screws on the sides and pulls off the metal overlay and is greeted with a mess of circuit boards. He considers whether he wants to do this elegantly, glances up and sees a room of serious looking people watching him, decides against elegant and just stabs the main circuit board until it sputters, sparks, and dies and cuts through some striped wires he guesses are the correct ones. Lucky the door slides open. Draco thanks the gods that are watching over him, straightens his back, walks in and heart pounding – punches the door close button furiously, even though he knows they don’t actually do anything.</p><p>Just before the doors close, he calls out –</p><p>
  <strong>“If anyone tells Black who I am I will destroy your credit don’t think I won’t!” </strong>
</p><p>No one follows him, <em>thank god</em>. </p><p>When the elevator reaches the floor for the international financial crimes division, Draco realizes he just threatened an entire floor of handlers for <em>CIA assassins</em> with credit scores and begins to wonder if the psychiatrists were wrong, and he was actually, criminally insane.</p><p>Nothing happens the rest of the day.</p><p>His traitor office mate nervously asks what happened and Draco replies nothing. No one from floor B12 comes up to his office. He dares to hope the nightmare is over.</p><p>If he doesn’t have to see <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> ever again Draco could die happy. </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Mission 1 + 1 Day.</u> </strong>
</p><p>Draco isn’t stopped when he flashes his badge the next morning. He isn’t pulled into any dark corners and murdered because he threatened floor B12. His computer boots up normally. He pulls out his phone and scans the room. His office space isn’t bugged. Well, it isn’t bugged any more than usual. There’s still a camera in the corner that doesn’t record sound. He has his usual stack of assignments delivered to his desk 10 minutes after he settles down. It’s turning out to be a completely regular normal day, and he has just finished his sigh of relief with it all gets shot to hell.</p><p>“Hey, who was on the line with me yesterday?” an unwelcome but yet now-unfortunately-familiar voice calls out through the room.</p><p><strong>FUCKING HELL</strong>.</p><p>“This place has grunt hackers that do financials right?” that same voice calls out again. “I didn’t get your name yesterday and Hermione says it’s confidential so I snuck up here to meet you.”</p><p>Draco is not ashamed to admit he dives under his desk. His sees his traitor office mate stand to motion <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> over when Draco throws a pencil at him, makes eye contact, and drags his index finger slowly, deliberately across his throat. <em>I will kill you.</em></p><p>Luckily his traitor office mate takes this threat seriously and sits back down.</p><p>“Who are you? How’d you get in?” Draco hears his boss call out. Bless her soul, kick <strong>that</strong> <strong>bastard</strong> out of here.</p><p>“Oh nobody, you know, a regular cog in the wheel, got some support yesterday and wanted to give my thanks.”</p><p>A regular cog in the wheel, <em>yeah fucking right</em>. Based on yesterday Golden Boy was a lethal killing machine that could execute this entire floor effortlessly with his pinky and eviscerate Draco in less than a second.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re in the right office? That sounds like IT support down the hall,” Draco hears his boss say.</p><p>Draco prays that <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> takes this as his cue to leave.</p><p>“Our security guard isn’t outside the door, what’s going on?” Draco hears the voice of one of his coworkers call out from where Draco thinks is the entrance to their office space.</p><p>Holy shit. Did <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> kill their security guard?</p><p>Draco hears said lethal killing machine chuckle, “oh I told him to take a break,” but it’s laced with a clear edge of danger and the implied statement is: <em>I’m in the right room, tell me where that person I’m looking for is… or else</em>.</p><p>Draco swallows nervously. Oh god, his traitor office mate has stood up and glances down at Draco hiding nervously. Draco nervously mouths “don’t you dare.” Too late. He hears footsteps head over and a bright “Wow, you look different that I imagined, can I buy you coffee-” and he sees his traitor office mate start to lift his arm to point at Draco’s hiding place, so when Draco sees <strong>Harry FUCKING</strong> <strong>Potter</strong>’s legs pass by his desk, his survival instincts kick in and he pushes his chair roughly, as hard as he can, to knock the lethal killing machine off balance. Draco vaguely registers the man topple forward and knock his groin into the corner of a desk. <em>JESUS, FUCK</em>. But there’s no time to enjoy that yelp of pain because his adrenaline is pumping and he flees from under his desk, ignoring that his entire office is frozen still, and throws open the door to escape into the hallway.</p><p>Seeing as a CIA assassin would be bursting out of said door any second now, because Draco personally knows how fast <strong>that man</strong> can recover and move, he finds no place close enough to hide but does spot an individual wearing a nice black CIA cap pass by him. Remembering how well a single cap had <em>deceived</em> him into thinking Agent Black was worth admiration, Draco lunges for it and crams it onto his head. He brushes his hair forward as best he can to cover his face.</p><p>Right on cute, the door bursts open and immediately Draco can feel the lethal killing machine’s eyes lock on him. Draco holds up both his hands.</p><p>“OH MY GOD PLEASE DO NOT KILL ME!” Draco shrieks.</p><p>This, thankfully, causes the man to falter in his determined steps. People milling about the hallways turn to stare, and the man Draco stole a hat from even backs away nervously.</p><p>“What? I’m not – I’m just trying to say thank you for yesterday,” <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> stammers out, as if Draco hadn’t just seen (and helped him) kill like twenty people yesterday.</p><p>Draco hears the clack of stilettos on the tile floor and recognizes the grey-haired lady from yesterday.</p><p>“Move along everyone, nothing to gawk at,” she commands sternly, and it’s a voice to be followed as people hasten to reach where they were going. Draco turns to go to, but the woman reaches out and <em>grips </em>his shoulder so painfully Draco almost cries.</p><p>“Not you, young man. I tried to keep your identity confidential as you… politely requested,” the woman says seriously, “but you made the mistake of telling him your actual job, Agent Black isn’t our best just for his good looks you know.”</p><p>“Obviously, he’s <em>hideous</em>,” is what Draco spits out, knowing this is a complete and utter lie since even though Draco absolutely hates <strong>this man </strong>and the fact that Draco is probably an entire foot shorter than him and <strong>this man</strong> could snap Draco like a fucking twig if he wanted to – <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong> would be easy on the eyes if Draco hadn’t seen him kill like twenty people yesterday.</p><p>From behind his bangs Draco can see <strong>Harry FUCKING Potter</strong>’s face twist in confusion. Hah! Draco had said the quip in a pretty convincing manner. The woman gripping his shoulder loosens her hold and actually lets out a genuine laugh.</p><p>“Brilliant! There’s your answer, your <em>hideous</em> face is what scared him away yesterday,” she says.</p><p>“Exactly,” agrees Draco trying to inch away again.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hand on his shoulder tightens again.</p><p>“Now that we’ve established that, and he’s found you anyways, you can’t possibly think we’re letting you go after that spectacular show you put on yesterday,” she says.</p><p>Draco almost preens, because well, he did put on a spectacular show yesterday. But then registers the rest of that message. <em>What did she mean they weren’t letting him go?</em></p><p>“You’ll be my handler right? Yesterday was <em>fantastic</em>!” <strong>this man </strong>(Draco resolutely decides he’s not even going to deign to call <strong>this man</strong> by his name, and was going to distance himself as far as possible, even if it was just mentally) says, clearly delusional.</p><p>“I’m not trained,” protests Draco.</p><p>“As you said yesterday, but <em>come on</em> that was the smoothest mission I’ve ever had it was like a walk in the park you clearly don’t need any training. Except when you almost forgot to tell me to duck in the elevator that part was a bit dicey -”</p><p>Draco feels the need to defend himself.</p><p>“I didn’t <em>forget</em>, I just wanted to see how fast you could dodge.”</p><p>“<em>How fast I could dodge?”</em></p><p>Okay, maybe Draco shouldn’t have said that. <strong>This man</strong> could certainly take this the wrong way and decide to just kill him right here right now.</p><p>“Oh my god I have to have you.”</p><p><em>WHAT? </em>Is <strong>this man</strong> crazy? Draco had just admitted to experimenting with him in a life or death situation and <strong>this man</strong> liked it?</p><p>“Not the appropriate place to discuss this, Agent Black, lets head back down,” says the woman, ushering them both into the elevator that would surely lead Draco to his death.</p><p>Draco is careful to face away from <strong>the man</strong> at all times and crosses his arms resolutely to make sure everyone in the elevator knows he is not following them willingly.</p><p>The moment the elevator door opens people are crowding him.</p><p>“Black you found him! That’s him!”</p><p>“Were you seriously just wasting away hacking financials, that was amazing what you did yesterday.”</p><p>“You have to show me how you input those measurements.”</p><p>“You know you left us stranded down here for a good 10 minutes after fucking up that panel, you are a complete legend.”</p><p><strong>The man</strong> is getting some hearty slaps on the back from some other men that Draco doesn’t recognize from yesterday. Big scary looking men.</p><p>“Saw the footage man, your new handler is <em>sick</em>, can I borrow him for a spin.”</p><p>Oh dear lord there are other CIA assassins here. Floor B12 wasn’t just for handlers, it was for their lethal killing machines too.</p><p>One man throws his arm around <strong>the man</strong>’s shoulders and Draco would recognize the shock of disgustingly red hair anywhere. Oh dear lord <strong>Ron FUCKING Weasley</strong> was a CIA assassin as well. Draco faintly remembers the name Granger from yesterday, and Hermione today. <em>Was the entirety of the Golden Trio working at the CIA? </em></p><p>“Some space please,” the stern looking woman commands and everyone abruptly backs away.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>This woman, that Draco has learned right now you do not ever want to cross because CIA assassins defer to her immediately, ushers him and <strong>the man </strong>into her office.</p><p>“My name is McGonagall, you can call me M (Authors Note: Sorry, it fit too well, I couldn’t resist the Bond reference!), welcome to my division. We operate solely on Basement level 12, which officially does not exist seeing as how official blueprints only go down as far as B10. I think that adequately explains what we do.”</p><p>Actually it doesn’t.</p><p>But if yesterday is anything to go by, Draco has more than enough information to know he should get the hell away.</p><p>“I respectfully, but wholeheartedly decline, but thank you for the offer I really should be going now,” Draco says, rising and praying he’ll be allowed to leave and won’t have to fumble with another stupid panel to escape again.</p><p>“<em>Sit down</em>,” M says.</p><p>Draco sits down.</p><p>“If you can provide an adequate reason, you may decline,” M finally says, her gaze serious but not unreasonable.</p><p>If Draco had any sense of control, the next few minutes probably could have gone better. Draco really <em>really</em> should have responded in a calm and reasonable manner. But he doesn’t. He really doesn’t (he donated $5,000,000 to the CIA when he was absolutely wasted and did nothing to cover his tracks so is anyone really surprised when he gets too emotional and makes the mistake of saying...) “I REFUSE TO WORK WITH <strong>HARRY FUCKING POT - </strong>”</p><p>Several things happen at once. M hits a button and the entire room goes red. From his right-side, peripheral vision he can see M with a small silver pistol aimed straight at Draco who is no longer in his chair but on the floor. Because <strong>THE MAN </strong>has tackled him, pinned his arms above his head, and has a very cold something that has a 99.99% chance of being a gun pressed to his forehead. <strong>THE MAN</strong>’s eyes are completely murderous, lips tight, body completely coiled like a viper and Draco is realizing he physically can’t move any single part of his body. Not his arms, and not his legs. Even better, his left-peripheral vision reveals an entire room of CIA assassins bathed in red training their guns straight at him.</p><p><em>HOLY FUCKING CHRIST THIS WAS IT</em>. His death. Draco was going to die right here, right now.</p><p>Draco’s cap is still on, and his face is mostly obscured by his long bangs but he can see <strong>the man</strong> lean forward and open his mouth, teeth glinting – <em>oh my god <strong>the man</strong></em> <em>was going to tear his throat out like a wild animal</em> – and tear the cap from his head. Draco feels his bangs fall to the side and sees the exact moment <strong>the man</strong>, FINE, Potter, realizes who he has pinned. Might as well die with the name of his murderer in his thoughts.</p><p>
  <strong>“MALFOY?”</strong>
</p><p>The red disappears instantly, and again several things happen at once. M’s gun disappears, the CIA assassin’s guns disappear (they’re still watching through the glass though), and M clears her throat. Draco realizes the red light indicates some kind of “danger – may need lethal force” trigger.</p><p>“You know him, good.”</p><p>“Malfoy?” Potter repeats, his voice strangled, confused, and surprisingly not disgusted. Maybe Draco was going to get out of this with all his limbs intact and unharmed. A man could hope. Then again, Potter’s gun is still pressed into his forehead.</p><p>“Get off of me you bastard, or just shoot me and put me out of my misery,” Draco snarls, hating the fact that he still couldn’t physical move anything. How the hell was Potter pinning him down so thoroughly?</p><p>Thankfully the gun leaves his forehead and Potter, in one fluid motion, releases and hoists Draco back into the seat he had been tackled from and settles back into his own chair as if the whole hellish thing had never happened.</p><p>Draco glances through the glass and sees a room full of handlers and assassins gaping. And yes, that is Weasley’s stupid face peering at him through the glass. Weasley’s eyes widen and is pointing directly at Draco when the glass shifts darkly opaque and the three of them are suddenly sitting in privacy.</p><p>“You two know each other,” says M, calm as can be. As if she hadn’t leveled a silver pistol at him mere seconds ago. What was wrong with these people?</p><p>“I wouldn’t say that,” says Draco taking a deep breath, “We two hate each other.”</p><p>“Ah, a childhood rivalry?” asks M, with an infuriating smirk.</p><p>Potter snorts besides him and Draco glares at him.</p><p>“Potter broke my arm in four fucking places in high school for no good reason,” Draco grits out, and adds “it was my dominant arm I could don’t do anything for months, <em>anything</em> Potter, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t write, I couldn't even fucking wank properly.”</p><p>“Please refrain from using Agent Black’s birth name in any capacity here, ever. For security reasons all birth names of our active CIA agents are confidential,” says M, “as you saw, the use of a birth name is reason to suspect an active kidnapping or blackmail situation is about to unfold and will be dealt with appropriately.</p><p>“Right, well since you all can easily find out my birth name since I use it upstairs I’m completely ineligible to work here right?” asks Malfoy hopefully.</p><p>Potter shakes his head, “you’re not an agent, you’re a handler – you don’t go out on missions and you certainly don’t know how to kill people so it doesn’t apply,” Potter peers at him curiously, “right? you don’t secretly know how to kill people right?”</p><p>“If I knew how to kill people you’d be dead by now,” responds Draco.</p><p>Potter, that bastard, grins, “Oh I’d like to see you try.”</p><p>“Boys,” M says sternly, “behave.”</p><p>Draco motions between them desperately, “this is an adequate reason right? you said if I had an adequate reason I could decline.”</p><p>M is looking at her computer and projects a file onto a screen behind her.</p><p>“I realize now I shouldn’t have done the background check on you separately, it really was my mistake that I didn’t catch you went to the same high school, but I’ve done a side-by-side background check and compatibility match just now and this is what we have.”</p><p>The clearly faulty compatibility match pronounces a 94% green lit score. There’s even a fucking exclamation point at the end, and small font that says “positive recommendation.”</p><p>Potter grins beside him, “I knew I felt something click into place yesterday, we were on the same wavelength.”</p><p>
  <em>Why was Potter even agreeing to this? </em>
</p><p>“Does it take into account that he broke my arm in four fucking places for no good reason?”</p><p>Potter snorts besides him.</p><p>M clicks on a small text box floating in the bottom right corner.</p><p>“It says you allegedly rigged a chemical bomb to explode in his hood during the chemistry lab midterm,” says M.</p><p>“Allegedly,” repeats Draco.</p><p>“It blew up in my face and if my godfather hadn’t been training me to duck from flashes of light my face would have burned off. I could have gone blind,” states Potter matter-of-factly, “and I heard you say <em>how did it miss I know I timed it </em>right after.”</p><p>Draco only picks up on the “godfather” and “training” part.</p><p>“Are you telling me you broke my arm with your lethal killing machine skills? That your godfather Sirius Black taught you? Who I am now assuming is some kind of CIA assassin because you used the word training as if you were training to become a CIA assassin back in high school?” asks Draco incredulously. </p><p>“Shit,” says Potter.</p><p>M sighs. “Agent Black, please refrain from sharing any more personal information before Mr. Malfoy gets confirmed as your handler.”</p><p>“Look,” says Potter, “you know you pissed me off back then because that wasn’t like the usual harmless pranks we pulled on each other. You almost completely derailed my entire future career at this agency.”</p><p>M makes a disapproving noise, but Potter, that brave bastard, shoulders on.</p><p>“So yes, I broke your arm when I twisted it, but you’re really fucking fragile you know that? I didn’t know that would happen since I grappled with Sirius all the time and nothing like that ever happened so it was an honest mistake even though you knew exactly what that chemical bomb could burn off. But you know what? I really don’t care about that stupid shit anymore, we’re doing really important work here, people’s lives are being threatened, <em>innocent people are dying every day</em>, and if you can help me, and <em>I know you can</em>, then I want you to be my handler.”</p><p>Well shit.</p><p>Draco remembers Potter’s sweeping heroic speeches about destroying class structure and his involvement in all those stupid advocate groups that Draco honestly gave zero fucks about. The impassioned speech being directed at him is new though.</p><p>Thankfully, Draco feels no compulsions to protect those innocent people Potter cares so much about.</p><p>But Draco does like the 3x3 screens on B12 and likes the idea of getting to boss Potter around and also likes the idea of getting carte blanche to hack into anything he wants to like he did yesterday with a bevy of nice equipment and tactical support all at his fingertips.</p><p>So Draco weighs the pros and cons for a few minutes, and then remembers M saying “before Mr. Malfoy gets confirmed as your handler” because he’s not an idiot and realizes he’s not <em>actually</em> being given a choice.</p><p>“Fine,” Draco says and is disgusted to see that Potter brightens, “but not to protect those stupid innocent people because I want a completely new 3x3 set up with all my personal specifications and a better headset and secure line set up because the static yesterday almost killed my hearing.”</p><p>M nods and reaches out her hand.</p><p>“And,” Draco adds, “and I want my traitor office mate upstairs fired because he <em>betrayed</em> me to Agent Black (this correct use of name earns Draco an approving look from M which oddly makes him feel proud, damn M).”</p><p>They shake and M replies “done and done, anything for our best agent.”</p><p>Potter grins.</p><p>Draco wants to explode another chemical bomb in Potter’s face but makes do with knowing Potter’s likely going to be shot at in the near future and Draco gets to watch the entire thing. Draco closes his eyes and also thinks of his new shiny toys. A whole extra screen to watch Greys Anatomy and McSteamy.</p><p>
  <strong> <u>Mission 1 + 2 days. </u> </strong>
</p><p>Things move quickly on floor B12. Weasley, no, <em>Agent Red</em> must have been ordered to keep his distance because although the redhead glowers at him from a distance he doesn’t approach. Handler Granger does though, as she’s been assigned to get him up to speed, train him up a bit, and make sure he knows he can’t refer to any of them by name. Apparently Granger and Agent Red are married and no one else in the office knows except for M, Agent Black, and now Draco.</p><p>Draco has no fucking idea how he feels about that. He literally has the power to leak the name of Agent Red’s wife, which could set in motion a horrific blackmail situation that leads to Agent Red murdering the entirety of CIA to protect his wife, except of course, Agent Black could probably stop him because, as everyone keeps point out, Agent Black as <em>the best</em>.</p><p>Handler Granger laughs when Draco describes this particular situation.</p><p>“We’ve all gone through a thorough vetting process to ensure our loyalty to the agency in all situations,” she says. “And if you’ve been hired then I trust their decision you’re not going to leak names or purposely get Agent Black killed.”</p><p>Draco doesn’t really remember this "thorough" vetting process but does remember a hazy dream of getting pricked by a needle last night and being asked various questions he can’t really remember. He remembers saying “I honestly don’t care about the American government or the British government I really just don’t want to get married to some stupid heiress and sit in a stupid estate all the time so this is probably the best job ever and I would never jeopardize that” and “What would I do with more money? I could hack into the Cayman Islands and take millions in seconds, but only if I got tired of waiting to inherit the $50,000,000 that’s already earmarked for me.”</p><p>Draco’s not sure what this says about the agency if those ludicrous, but true, answers were enough for them to entrust him with the life of their <em>best agent</em>.</p><p>After Handler Granger passes him off to someone that’s supposed to show him how to use the pre-set programs designed to redirect traffic in almost every country in the world, and said someone expresses his admiration that Draco’s been assigned to Agent Black, Draco can’t help but resist telling him “I almost burned his face off with a chemical bomb.” This someone chuckles nervously.</p><p>When Draco gets sent for a physical and to get a special tracker injected into his arm, he tells the nurse who also gushes about Agent Black (apparently Potter is a huge charmer with the ladies) “I almost burned his face off with a chemical bomb.” This nurse looks concerned and goes to make a phone call.</p><p>Draco is about to tell the big scary man that most likely is an agent, who popped in to tell him to take care of their best agent, clearly referring, yet again, to Agent Black, that he almost burned his face off with a chemical bomb when Handler Granger rushes in and shoos everyone out.</p><p>“Handler Malfoy, stop telling people that. People are actually concerned you might have a vendetta against him.”</p><p>Draco looks at him like she’s crazy.</p><p>“I <strong>do</strong> have a vendetta against him,” Draco says.</p><p>Handler Granger gapes at him, pulls herself together, and bites out “he told me you might act like this and I promised to not make any judgements until I’ve seen you work together, which coincidently is scheduled for tomorrow, he’s already on a flight to Moscow, and if he dies I am going to stab you a million times until you wish you’d never fucked with any of us.”</p><p>Draco resolves to have a little more self-control and reminds himself he is in a pit of highly trained and high strung vipers and shouldn’t poke any more beasts just for the hell of it. Draco tries to see if Handler Granger can explain why M is even allowing Draco to "handle" their precious agent, and Handler Granger just explains that Agent Black gets anything he wants. This doesn’t seem fair until Handler Granger tells him that Agent Black always takes the most dangerous missions that no one else wants to touch. If a man is that willing to put his life on the line, well the CIA can damn well give him anything he wants. Plus, apparently Potter can more than take care of himself. Draco remembers the hack job the handler he'd displaced the day before had been conducting and concedes this might be true.</p><p>Still, as Handler Granger stalks away, Draco actually worries whether he can avoid any major fuck-ups tomorrow. What if the first time had been complete luck and he actually got their best agent killed tomorrow because he hadn’t paid any attention to anything anyone had said today.</p><p>Draco does not want to get stabbed a million times by Handler Grander.</p><p>FUCK.</p><p>He spends all night at his flat going through the plans, re-writing code, re-checking access points, re-doing vantage points, and trying to get any and all information he can about the Moscow group members that are suspected to be there. Draco knows that plans are made to be broken and he’ll have to be on his toes to get new information once Potter’s on the ground. </p><p>
  <strong> <u>Mission 2.</u> </strong>
</p><p>It’s pretty jarring to be woken up to a stream of people in his flat, people who can only be described as a full suited SWAT team.</p><p>Handler Granger takes one look at him, the notes he'd fallen asleep on, and his kitchen table filled with other scribbles and plans and softens immediately.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“Come on Handler Malfoy, Agent Black is scheduled to jump in about 30 minutes and you’re supposed to be at the office already.”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Handler Granger motions to everything on his table, “Gather all this up and let’s go-”</p><p>Draco puts up a hand to stop them.</p><p>“It’s fine, I have everything I need in here,” Draco says, tapping his head.</p><p>Handler Granger looks down at the complex sheets, “if you say so, it’s your show today.”</p><p>Draco lets himself get hauled to his feet and escorted down the hall. Except instead of heading down they’re heading up.</p><p>“Helicopter,” Handler Granger says, handing him a steaming cup of his favorite coffee – a pumpkin spice latte and it isn’t even fall.</p><p>He doesn’t even want to ask how they know he likes these and how they got what tastes like an honest-to-god Starbucks pumpkin spice latte in the middle of summer.</p><p>They get down to B12 in record time, and Draco’s almost completely awake when he sees his perfectly new touch screen set up. There’s a nervous energy buzzing about the room and he knows it’s directed at him. Handler Grander has her own station set up and running behind his station, and Draco realizes that she’s backup – if Draco completely fucks up she’s ready to take over. He grits his teach as he starts up his own screens and gets on his knees to double check that everything is securely in place. His chair is already positioned at the perfect level to his desk so he can’t even nervously adjust that.</p><p>When Draco slides his headset on he can hear some banal chatter through the head piece.</p><p>“This controls the airlock right, and this is the autopilot button right?” Potter is asking.</p><p>Draco clicks on the agent point-of-view cam. Potter is at the front of a plane in front of a large panel of hundreds of blinking buttons that Draco doesn’t know anything about, but a couple keystrokes later and he has the plane’s make and model from the mission reports, downloads the original plane blueprints from the company’s backlogs, scales it to size, and their functions are overlaid onto the screen.</p><p>He zooms in on what Potter is pointing at. </p><p>Potter is attempting to name all the tiny buttons in the bottom right, all identical except for their position – for random lights scattered about the plane.</p><p>The pilot is nodding along to everything Potter is pointing at and naming, which currently has all be correct.</p><p>“Actually, that one is for the back right light not the back left light,” says Draco when Potter finally makes a mistake.</p><p>Potter snaps his head up even though Malfoy is clearly not on the plane. “Malfoy! Hey! I heard you were running late like,” Potter checks his watch, “15 minutes ago.”</p><p>“Lies,” says Draco, ignoring Handler Granger’s huff from behind him, “that would be really irresponsible of me.”</p><p>Potter laughs and considers the panel of buttons again, “thanks for the catch Malfoy, I think you’re right about the side.”</p><p>“Of course I’m right Black, I’m have the blueprints with me.”</p><p>“You want to quiz me before I have to jump of this plane and plummet 30,000 feet?”</p><p>“No,” says Draco, “I want to drink my coffee in peace before you go on a murdering rampage.”</p><p>Draco hears some indignant noises behind him “disrespectful,” “did he actually just say that,” and his personal favorite “I would kill for the chance to quiz Agent Black.”</p><p>“Also, it’s not 30,000 feet. It’s 30,015 feet.”</p><p>“Just seeing if you would catch that,” says Potter.</p><p>“Well if I didn’t, I wouldn’t know when to tell you to release the chute and you’d crash and die and then Hermione would stab me a million times,” says Draco, a little spitefully.</p><p>“Well we don’t want that do we,” says Potter.</p><p>“<strong>No, we don’t</strong>,” says Draco forcefully.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I know my way around a chute and will release it when I release it,” says Potter, “if I die it won’t be your fault.”</p><p>“If you don’t release that chute exactly when I tell you I’m going to lead you into a <em>death trap on purpose</em> just to make you fight your way out and you know I’m not kidding,” says Draco.</p><p>There’s now a fair amount of chattering going on behind him but no one has ripped him out of his chair and Handler Granger has remained silent during the whole exchange so apparently Draco threatening to lead Potter into a <em>death trap</em> is completely kosher.</p><p>“You’re almost over Moscow, Black, you ready?” asks Draco, remembering in his manual that this is something he’s supposed to tell his Agent.</p><p>Surprisingly, Potter’s vitals tick up in a way that indicates stress.</p><p>Draco pulls up some of Potter’s mission histories and quickly does a search on any parachuting accidents. He finds a minor one and skims it quickly, some type of mistimed jumped that resulted in Potter having to go catch an agent on his way down.</p><p>Diagnosis: anxiety leading up to (but not during) jumps.</p><p>Recommendations: none, does not affect actionable skill set.</p><p>So it won’t affect Potter’s performance. But the stress ticking higher and higher is annoying Draco. Draco decides he may as well experiment again.</p><p>“So, I made a mistake,” lies Draco, “it’s all these damn clouds causing the GPS to glitch but good thing I double-checked because you still have a little bit further to go, just wait by the airlock and I’ll tell you when you’re actually almost over Moscow.”</p><p>Potter’s stress plummets.</p><p>Interesting how Draco making a mistake causes no stress, but just the announcement that it’s almost time to jump does. The chattering behind him intensifies, because Potter is, actually, directly over Moscow and should be jumping in about 10 seconds. Draco can hear someone murmur “um” behind him as his screen flashes 2 seconds.</p><p>Draco sits up straighter in his chair.</p><p>“Okay I lied, you need to jump right now, like don’t even question it, <strong>just jump right fucking now</strong>.”</p><p>Potter, to Draco’s delight, doesn't hesitate and ends up jumping exactly when Draco’s screen flashes 0.</p><p>Draco looks at the vitals, stress level: none.</p><p>Score.</p><p>It’s like a video game.</p><p>Potter doesn’t say anything so Draco doesn’t say anything.</p><p>After double checking Potter’s speed, the wind speed, and factoring the little draft for Potter’s freaking coat he forgot to zip all the way up, Draco times the release down to milliseconds.</p><p>“<strong>Now</strong>.”</p><p>Potter releases the chute.</p><p>A couple minutes later Potter drops silently into a pitch back camp of sleeping Russians, right behind a large stockpile of wood as planned.</p><p>Potter steps on a twig.</p><p>“Can you be any louder, are you trying to wake up the whole camp?” asks Draco, bored about just how professional he had managed to be in the past 10 minutes.</p><p>“You’re fucking louder than the twig Malfoy, shut up,” answers Potter.</p><p>“No, I’m not. This earpiece is configured precisely so only you can hear unless someone in that camp has superhuman daredevil levels of hearing and is standing right next to you.”</p><p>“When I have to answer you, <em>I’m louder than the fucking twig</em>.”</p><p>“Then don’t answer me and just listen.”</p><p>“I’m not going to let you just insult me and not respond.”</p><p>“Well that’s your choice and if that’s what wakes up all the sleeping Russians than that’s entirely your fault.”</p><p>Draco delights in the heavy breathing that indicates that Potter is not pleased but has chosen to shut up.</p><p>This is amazing.</p><p>Draco can literally say anything he wants and Potter can’t yell back at him. <em>Why hadn’t Draco wanted this job from the beginning?</em></p><p>“<strong>Stop</strong>,” commands Draco.</p><p>Potter stops. Oh my god. Exactly like a fucking video game. This. Was. Awesome.</p><p>“Okay there’s a pretty shitty computer set up in front of that tent at your 3, approximately 12 yards away, but I think that’s what I’m looking for. There should be a USB port on the left side of the laptop, just stick in whatever the tech guys gave you.”</p><p>Potter carefully heads in that direction. For such an imposing figure, Potter is deadly silent. The coms are rigged to pick up the tiniest bits of noise but there’s absolutely no noise beyond a few tree leaves being rustled by the wind.</p><p>However, just for good measure, Draco adds “and don’t step on anymore twigs.”</p><p>Potter grunts his displeasure but doesn’t say anything. Draco takes a long sip of his pumpkin spice latte. Potter inserts the USB and hides behind a nearby tree like a good little video game character, probably waiting to hear what Draco finds. He skims through the unprotected files, the Russians certainly weren’t expecting anyone to drop into their camp in the middle of the night to see what kind of weapons they were moving, and almost spits out his coffee when he realizes they’re not moving weapons like the CIA thought.</p><p>Well, not weapons like guns.</p><p>These Russians have weapons like <strong>bombs</strong>, stored in metal vats.</p><p>“Um,” says Draco, “so you might think I’m joking but I’m really not.”</p><p>“What,” says Potter in a low tone, “what did you find?”</p><p>“I promise,” says Draco, slightly hysterical, “I promise I did not set this up because I have a vendetta against you, <strong>for the record I did not set this up</strong>.”</p><p>There goes the chattering behind him. Handler Granger must have also combed through the USB files too because she lets out a snort.</p><p>“Malfoy,” says Potter, “what are you talking about?”</p><p>“So they don’t have guns like we thought,” says Draco taking a deep breathe, “they have giant chemical bombs all rigged up to explode and they’re planning on selling them in just a few hours.”</p><p>Complete silence. </p><p>“And the best course of action is to just blow all the bombs up intentionally <em>really carefully</em> without blowing up your own face, and then because I think they’re located right in the middle of camp because the tents are set up in a circle about 400 meters away from the blast radius, you know, which is smart because it means <em>they won’t get blown up</em> if the bombs blow up but it does mean you won’t be able to kill anyone with the bomb before they wake up and realize something has gone wrong. They’re probably armed in their little tent beds and this will certainly wake them up and that’s why there aren’t any guards awake because seriously, who would put themselves in the middle of a <em>death trap</em> for a couple of measly chemical bombs?”</p><p>Complete silence. </p><p>“I know I said I wouldn’t lead you into a <em>death trap</em> if you released the parachute when I said to... Which you did, that was great by the way.”</p><p>Complete silence.</p><p>“Sorry,” says Draco, unapologetically.</p><p>Complete silence.</p><p>"They really do have chemical bombs, and I swear this is the best course of action, and not just because I've been wanting to blow up another chemical bomb in your face," says Draco.</p><p>Complete silence.</p><p>“Good luck Agent Black,”says Draco, and then adds “again, sorry about the <em>death trap</em>.”</p><p>“Stop calling it a fucking <em>death trap</em>,” hisses Potter, finally. </p><p>Draco checks his no-longer unresponsive video game character’s vitals. Still no stress. Jesus. Agent Black was like a locked playable with god-levels of stats.</p><p>“Okay well, get to the bombs into the center and let’s take a look at what they have rigged up, I’m an expert on these things you know,” says Draco, grateful his vitals aren’t hooked up to any readouts because his own levels of stress were likely sky high.</p><p>“I know,” says Potter forcefully. That does result in a tiny uptick of stress. Which serves Potter right for being so calm in the face of a <em>death trap</em>.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” says Draco, “I also have it on good authority that you are an expert on dodging these things.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” adds Draco.</p><p>Draco is delighted to hear Hermione make a choked sound behind him.</p><p>Potter doesn't respond. </p><p>It goes pretty well all things considered. Potter grabs the Russian laptop chock full of useful data, their primary objective, sets off the bombs following Draco's directions, and uses his super agility to get the fuck out of the blast radius, their secondary objective, and gets a good scan of all the weapons that are shooting at him, their third objective – since gathering more intel on what weapons Russians have access to is always an objective.Those Russians, always getting their sneaky little hands on dangerous weapons. There’s so much smoke and gunfire and angry Russians shooting that Draco is pretty much useless the moment the bombs go off since there aren’t any cameras like back in the evil conglomerate building Potter had been in a couple days ago. There’s only the cams on Potter.</p><p>Potter displays what he does best, dodging bullets, incapacitating men, all while making sure the laptop is tucked securely under his left arm to avoid any damage from stray bullets that might compromise the data.</p><p>So essentially Potter fights off an entire camp of angry Russians with one arm. And the whole thing comes off as a trailer for the title of the deadliest man on the planet. It’s impressive, but Draco makes sure to note that Potter had the advantage of being hidden in a cloud of smoke which results in a lot of the angry Russians not knowing there was just one Potter rather than an entire invading group of CIA agents (it wouldn't be good to let himself get too impressed by Potter after all).</p><p>In fact Draco adds it to the report he's supposed to turn in at the end of the mission. "Agent Black is assisted by a cloud of smoke." Then tags "cloud of smoke" as an ally, adds it to the list of Black's friendly associates, and makes a note that says "ally was imperative to success of mission."  </p><p>When Potter gets clear of the camp, panting hard, he finally addresses Draco again.</p><p>“How’d I do?” Potter asks in a bright and proud tone.</p><p>Draco mentally goes through his original timeline. Potter should have been out and headed to extraction point 4 minutes earlier. To be fair, that hadn’t taken into account deliberately exploding chemical bombs and fighting off a camp of angry Russians (by Draco's estimated that should have added at least an extra 15 minutes), but he wasn’t going to tell Potter that.</p><p>“Well you’re 4 minutes behind schedule and your extraction team is just waiting for you and wasting valuable CIA dollars so you better get a move on, and do better next time,” answers Draco flatly. </p><p>Handler Granger bursts out laughing from behind him, there’s huge amounts of chatter around him, and lots of hands patting him on the shoulder. Jesus, what was wrong with these people. Draco had just made their best agent blow up giant chemical bombs, fight himself out of a clear <em>death trap, </em>and then told him to do better.</p><p>“I love you,” says Potter, laughing. And Draco’s heart stops.</p><p>
  <strong> <u>Mission 2 + 1 day.</u> </strong>
</p><p>“You two make an exhilarating pair, I get why Agent Black demanded you,” Handler Granger tells him during Draco’s solo debrief, all smiles and friendliness now, “I knew you were smart in high school but didn’t know you were hiding all that!” </p><p>“I wasn’t sure if I should put the already too-volatile Agent Black in the hands of someone also too-volatile, but together you seem to be able to control the resulting chaos,” M tells him during Draco’s solo debrief, approvingly, “perhaps a little less deliberate provocation of your agent next time.”</p><p>God, Potter was now <em>his agent</em>.</p><p>"Also what is this about Agent Black having a new associate named "cloud of smoke?"</p><p>Draco fucks out of the room immediately without answering. </p><p>“Are you sure you don’t have any childhood trauma or military training? You have an extremely high tolerance for violence and have an alarmingly low regard for human life,” says the shrink that’s supposed to evaluate whether he’s psychologically sound after going through two pretty bloody missions.</p><p>“Do video games count?” asks Draco.</p><p>The shrink frowns disapprovingly. </p><p>“I’m just a horrible person,” supplies Draco.</p><p>The shrink writes something down and Draco later hacks the security feed to read <em>uses humor as a defense mechanism, appropriate response considering the missions, clear</em>.</p><p>Draco honestly couldn’t care less about angry Russians dying but if the shrink thinks that he was joking about being a horrible person, well, if it gets him cleared he wasn’t going to complain.</p><p>When Draco is done with his solo debriefs, Handler Granger tells him that Agent Black is in the medical wing of B12, and that they have one last quick debrief with M together before they’re done for the day. As Draco heads over to the medical wing to pick up <em>his agent</em>, he’s not sure what he’s supposed to say. It was one thing to make fun of Potter over the comms and just imagine he was a lethal killing machine video game character, and another to face him in person. The last time they’d been face to face, he’d been pinned down, completely immobile, and Potter had ripped his hat off with his teeth.</p><p>Draco would be lying if the thought of getting <em>pinned down</em> against wasn’t getting his blood plumping in a dangerously thrilling way.</p><p>Potter is lying shirtless on the medical examination table like a wet dream come to life. Eyes closed he doesn’t look so menacing, but Draco knows there’s at least 250 lbs of pure lethal muscle lying there, especially from the scattering of healing scars littered across his chest and arms. There’s also a couple of fully healed wounds that have to be bullet holes from their circular shape and puckered edges. Draco can’t help himself and reaches out to trace the one on Potter’s right hip.</p><p>The moment his index finger touches the warm skin, Potter’s body springs to life, his hand engulfing Draco’s skinny wrist, locking it in place.</p><p>“Draco,” says Potter. Potter’s been calling him Malfoy all day, why the sudden change? Feeling daring, Draco says, “Harry.”</p><p>Potter freezes and Draco yelps in pain when Potter squeezes his wrist too hard.</p><p>“You can’t call me that here,” says Potter, tensed.</p><p>“Black,” Draco concedes. But makes note of the fact that Potter said "can't" and “here” instead of “don’t.”</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Potter glances down at what Draco’s index finger is touching.</p><p>“That’s old,” says Potter, “a couple years ago.”</p><p>“Obviously,” says Draco, “I’m not stupid.”</p><p>Potter smiles. “Obviously.”</p><p>And because Draco isn’t stupid, he finally understands why Potter <em>honestly </em>doesn’t seem to hate him at all anymore. It would be impossible not to, seeing all the old scars and bullet wounds that just scream about all the times Potter has thrown himself into a mission for his country. A stupid high school rival was nothing compared to the people he was fighting against now. Draco almost feels disappointed that he hasn’t left a big impact on Potter. And Draco feels this need to also be responsible <em>for leaving a scar</em>. Jesus fucking Christ. He had some serious problems.</p><p>Draco inspects the rest of Potter’s torso.</p><p>“What are you looking at?”</p><p>Draco pulls off the sheet covering Potter’s legs and there’s a couple bandages on his right leg.</p><p>“Think those will scar?” Draco asks.</p><p>Potter nods, “yeah I got nicked by a couple bullets but nothing punctured.”</p><p>Draco isn’t sure what face he’s making but something makes Potter <em>reassure him</em>. “Really, it was completely my fault I didn’t notice some guys I knocked down were still conscious and holding their guns.”</p><p>“Oh please,” says Draco, “you got those on our official first mission together so those are <strong>my scars</strong>.”</p><p>“<strong>Mine</strong>,” Draco repeats, hoping they turn out to be giant, ugly scars.</p><p>Potter is just staring at him, and Draco sees something flicker behind the intense green eyes. What? <em>What?</em></p><p>“We have to debrief together with M, so don’t just lie there let’s go,” says Draco.</p><p>Draco turns to go but Potter still has a tight grip on his wrist.</p><p>“I’m supposed to let these bandages set for a couple more minutes,” says Potter.</p><p>“Fine,” says Draco, making no move to free his wrist. Draco ignores the fact that Potter doesn’t free his wrist either.</p><p> <strong><u>Mission 3, 4, and 5.</u></strong></p><p>Missions 3 and 4 go smoother. Potter and Draco fall into a comfortable banter and Draco knows he’s not saying as mean things as he could. <strong>Except</strong>. <em>Of course there’s an except</em>. Because he’s Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Mission 3: the assassination in Southern France goes fine.</p><p>Except Draco “forgets” to turn off the sprinkler system in Southern France and Potter has to fight through a crowd of security guards drenched and vision obscured by water that Draco knows is almost freezing. Draco knows the water is almost freezing because he made sure to set the water that cold when he discovered the system the day before. He likes to think it’s the water that causes Potter to get punched in the face and has to sport an impressive black eye on B12 for the rest of the week.</p><p>Potter doesn’t say anything about it.</p><p>Mission 4: another reconnaissance mission in Moscow goes fine.</p><p>Except Draco “forgets” to tell him about the dog the Moscow camp has and Potter gets bitten on his left ankle. Potter will be fine because Draco made sure to sneak in an extra shot of rabies vaccine in a routine physical two days before so Potter’s white blood cells are primed to fight off the infection <em>if</em> Potter gets bitten. But who is Draco kidding? Of course Potter gets bitten, Draco led him right to the owner of the dog’s tent on purpose. Draco also slipped in an extra case of pain medication into the tech pack that was handed off to Potter the day before he flew out on the mission.</p><p>Potter doesn’t say anything about it.</p><p>Mission 5: rescue of British agents from Shanghai goes <strong>not fine</strong>.</p><p>Draco doesn’t get the chance to pretend to have forgotten to tell Potter that his target in Shanghai that has a girlfriend tasked with keeping the high tech keycard safe, actually has three girlfriends. Because Potter figures this out almost immediately when he enters the hotel. The high tech keycard that opens the cell with British agents is on one of three women. And the cell is unfortunately very un-hackable from offsite and Draco isn’t trained to go onsite to missions yet. So Potter has to discreetly figure out which girlfriend has the key.</p><p>Draco thought it would be a harder dilemma, except Potter apparently has tons of experience of being a honey-trap.</p><p>Potter easily seduces the first with a charming smile, sweet words, and the two scramble into the coat closet and moments later Draco is greeted by a front seat view of a gasping and moaning brunette woman writhing under the touch of Potter’s hands. The woman’s dress slips to the ground, and Potter’s fingers slip into her like he’s done this a million times.</p><p>Draco analyses the noises the woman is making and compares it to fake patterns commonly found in porn. No match. The woman is responding honestly to whatever the hell Potter is doing with his fingers.</p><p>Jesus Fucking Christ.</p><p>No key card either.</p><p>Potter easily seduces the second with a flinty grin, wicked dirty talk that Draco didn’t even know Potter could say with a straight face and sound like he means it, and the two scramble into the same fucking coat closet and moments later Draco is again greeted by a front seat view of a different gasping and moaning brunette woman writhing under the touch of Potter’s hands. The woman’s dress also slips to the ground, and Potter’s fingers also slip into her.</p><p>Draco doesn’t need to analyze anything this time to know the woman is orgasming to whatever the hell Potter is doing with his fingers.</p><p>Jesus Fucking Christ.</p><p>By now Draco is so hard it’s painful. And he literally can’t do anything about it because he’s at work, supposed to be “handling” Agent Black who clearly needs zero direction on anything that involves seducing women. A couple agents stop by to leer at the screen, <em>Agent Black never fails to get the woman</em> they say. Handler Granger shoos them away disapprovingly and tells Draco he shouldn’t let them linger too long.</p><p>“It’s just for the mission but we shouldn’t take pleasure in taking advantage of people, especially sexually,” she says.</p><p>Draco thinks this is hypocritical because everyone crowds around to watch when Potter completely lethally decimates criminals but apparently sex is where they draw the line? But if it gets people away from his desk, and away from noticing that Draco might come in his pants imagining Potter’s fingers inside of him then he wasn’t going to say anything.</p><p>Draco is regretting a lot of his choices right now. Like not taking the time to figure out which girlfriend had the key card so he doesn’t have to sit through this.</p><p>No key card again.</p><p>“Third times the charm,” says Potter through the comm, “I didn’t think it would be the hot one because that’s such a cliché.”</p><p>The third one <em>is</em> the hot one, a leggy blonde with blue eyes, slim frame, and a generous bust size. She doesn’t fare much better when Potter starts to lean in and enchant her with sharp compliments laden with innuendo.</p><p>“I’m taking her into my room to make sure I get the card,” Potter whispers into the comm, “I can probably find it and slip it in under the door and distract her while someone else frees the agents from the cell. If they can slip it back under within an hour I don’t think she’ll even notice I’ve taken it.”</p><p>Draco scrambles to get the directions off to some other agents outside, almost forgetting he has a job to do too with all this sexual activity occurring on his screen. As a completely homosexual man usually grossed out by heterosexual sex, Potter was proving to be an unfortunate exception.</p><p>Potter leads the blonde into his room and she falls easily onto his bed. Draco is literally frozen in his swiveling chair as Potter peels off his own shirt and pins her to the bed. Draco swallows. The blonde says something stupid about Potter being a bad man with all his scars and bullet wounds, and is almost grateful that Potter chooses to kiss the woman to shut her up. But then there’s sounds of moaning and groaning and kissing flooding through to Draco’s headset and Draco cannot believe that his job requires him to <em>watch and listen to Potter fuck this woman</em>. Seeing Potter's fingers work is entirely different from seeing Potter's cock. Potter carefully slips the dress off her and Draco spots something shiny tucked into her bra.</p><p>“The bra,” Draco points out, relieved his voice doesn’t betray any of the attraction he feels at the moment.</p><p>Potter leans up to kiss the woman again, and from the room’s corner video, Draco can see Potter’s fingers unhook the bra and carefully catch the keycard before casually getting off the bed and claiming he has condoms in the bathroom.</p><p>Draco tells the agent standing outside the door to get condoms immediately to exchange for the keycard. The exchange happens in under 30 seconds, and then Potter is climbing back into bed and legitimately fucks the woman in at least 5 different positions, confidently, expertly, fluidly, and she orgasms at least 3 times. Potter comes once also, at the end, and the soft moan and grunt of pleasure almost makes Draco pass out from want. <em>Does Potter fuck men like that? Would Potter fuck Draco like that? </em> </p><p>This had made it impossible to ignoring just how fucking hot Potter was. Especially since Draco doesn’t hate the man anymore (when did that happen?), and possibly likes him a little because doing missions with him is exciting and fun. And watching Potter fuck someone for almost an hour was like watching personalized porn tailored to his fantasies. Draco had always been even more turned on by the sight of a thick cock thrusting, usually in rhythm going in and out of his ass, but depending on the angle of Potter's self-camera...well... And the woman was blond for fuck’s sake and when her back was to the camera’s...Draco knows he’s about the same height and he’s just as if not slimmer than this woman.</p><p>It’s a complete disaster but miraculously Draco keeps it together just enough to facilitate the rest of the mission before sneaking off to the bathroom to wipe the cameras so they don’t even record his entrance into the bathroom so he can rut against his hand until he comes, hard, and quietly. Cleanly, because Draco has to do his fucking solo debrief now.</p><p>Again, Potter doesn’t say anything about the mission and acts business as usual.</p><p>Except Draco can’t stop fantasizing about Potter now and it <em>pisses him off</em>.</p><p>
  <strong> <u>Mission 5 + 1 day.</u> </strong>
</p><p>Draco takes a look at the upcoming missions and sees there’s one penciled in a week to rescue more stupid British agents that have been captured and there’s another stupid fucking criminal that is rumored to have given another fucking keycard to another fucking girlfriend and they’re supposed to be at a giant hotel opening in a week.</p><p>Draco immediately signs up for onsite mission training and because he’s brilliant with firearms with no hesitation when firing (they’re blanks he’s told later, when he asks why none of the men in bulletproof vests seem particularly scared, but then they do look slightly alarmed when Draco lets it slip he thought they were real bullets) he’s passed in a couple days even though he’s absolute shit at hand to hand combat. His instructor said Draco just didn’t have the frame for it, but that he thought if Draco always carried a knife he would be okay.</p><p>Potter, that traitor, protests and suggests that Draco is not at all prepared to go to onsite missions but Draco threatens to blare nursery rhymes over the comms on their next mission and Potter, wisely, chooses to shut up.</p><p>
  <u> <strong>Mission 6.</strong> </u>
</p><p>So Draco goes to the onsite rescue mission and instead of seducing the girlfriend, Potter is tasked with getting a USB into any desktop terminal in the facility holding the British agents so Draco can onsite hack it open through bluetooth.</p><p>“Is this really more fun than the other way?” asks Potter skillfully ducking into more corridors to avoid detection, “I thought you enjoyed the view last week.”</p><p>Draco doesn’t dignify that with a response but “accidentally” leads Potter to dead end.</p><p>“I know I heard you gasp a couple times,” says Potter when he realizes he needs to make a U-turn because Draco has directed him to go straight through a wall, “was it one of the brunettes or the blonde that you liked? I can’t remember.”</p><p>“The terminal is in the room to your right,” says Draco, regretting he hadn't been able to find another dead end to lead his agent into. Potter slips into the room and slides the USB in quickly on the console. Draco makes quick work of the security and has the British agent’s cells sliding open in just a few moments.</p><p>“Get out now,” says Draco, “don’t trip over your over-inflated ego on the way.”</p><p>“It’s coming back to me,” says Potter, “I’m sure it was the blonde... but that’s weird Malfoy, she kinda looked like you from the back.”</p><p>
  <em>And the fact that Potter had noticed the blonde looked like Draco from the back?</em>
</p><p>Malfoy checks the cameras and sees the British agents are safely on their way out. He also checks and sees that Potter’s exit is clear as well. He then checks to see if there is a sprinkler system. The water isn’t almost freezing but it would have to do. He isolates it to go off <em>only</em> in Potter’s exit path and then promptly tells Potter, “go fuck yourself,” before disconnecting the line.</p><p>Draco waits patiently in the back of the van for a soon to be pissed off Potter. He locks the van doors for good measure.</p><p>A couple minutes later, there’s pounding on the doors.</p><p>“Fuck. Did you lock this Malfoy? And the sprinklers? Again? Why are your comms off? Are you okay? <em>Why is this locked?</em>”</p><p>Draco flings open the doors and hears a satisfying crunch when one of the doors hits Potter's nose. Of course, Draco also loses his balances and falls on top of a shirtless very wet and very concerned looking Harry Potter.</p><p>Who is rapidly looking angrier and angrier realizing that there is nothing wrong with Draco or his equipment in the van.</p><p>“Usually it’s cute when you sabotage something small because it keeps me on my toes because there’s actually a lesson to be learned about how I can’t always rely on you to be perfect, but <em>this time</em> I know I didn’t set anything off so <em>I know</em> you just turned the sprinklers on yourself. Directly on my path because I saw all the hallways that didn’t have <em>any sprinklers on</em>.”</p><p>Angry Potter is hot. Wet, shirtless, angry Potter is even hotter. So despite the fact that Potter is very angry, which usually just delights Draco, Draco also just wants to <em>lick him</em>.</p><p>“Oh did I say something to piss you off? You can’t act like a princess about this because you’re the one always insulting me on missions. I decide to make fun of you this one time and you just let loose the sprinklers I know you know I hate?” is what Potter is raging from beneath him.</p><p>Potter is just letting Draco <em>sit on him </em>on top of gravel, right outside of a very armed facility they had just broken in to and out of, like it was completely normal for Potter to be laying on top of sharp rocks like it was the beach. Draco is straddling his agent’s lap while his agent’s bare back was just lying on top of gravel and his agent wasn't making any movement to throw Draco off of him.  </p><p>And Potter doesn’t seem to be in any pain at all, even when Draco leans forward and presses Potter’s shoulder deep into said gravel and grinds down on the lap he's sitting on. Draco can even hear the gravel crunch under Potter's body.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Maybe Potter was a masochist, which would explain a lot.</p><p>“Are you listening to me?” asks Potter, as if he’s only just realizing that Draco has paid absolute no attention to anything Potter has just said.</p><p>“Fuck me,” is what Draco says, staring into his agent’s eyes. Because Draco has <strong>no self-control</strong> and it’s gotten him this far in this very dangerous and exciting life so why not.</p><p><strong>“FUCK ME,” </strong>is what Draco says again, making it very clear he’s not saying it in a flippant “what kind of situation have I have found myself in” euphemism.</p><p>“Do I need to turn on my comms to get you <strong>fuck me</strong> because I will if I have to,” is what Draco says, again, to the rapidly gaping agent being sat on. </p><p>Unfortunately, he doesn’t get an answer because this is when the British agents finally exit the building, spot them across the street, and speedily make their way over. Like it’s an unwritten rule that nondescript white vans are always secret government agencies.</p><p>Potter finally pushes himself off the gravel, and because he’s strong, is hauling Draco to his feet too. Draco is stuffed immediately back into the van and the group of other British agents soon follow. Potter of course, hauls ass to the driver’s seat and soon they’re making impossibly good time through the streets. Draco can see that Potter’s shoulder are tense through the metal grating separating the front seats from the back of the van and he’s also stressed as indicated by the increasingly high bars of his vital signs that Draco can spot on his portable laptop on the floor of the van.</p><p>Well it’s about time.</p><p>The British agents of course, have no idea what has transpired between Agent Black and Handler Malfoy so they’re in good spirits with their thanks and compliments.</p><p>One even tells Draco he’s the prettiest thing he’s seen all week.</p><p>The laptop is on silent now, but Draco is <em>extremely pleased</em> to see that Potter’s vitals spike right after the comment is made and are veering towards the red zone of high stress.</p><p>No time like the present to experiment with his Agent’s stress levels.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” purrs Draco, “I don’t believe I know your name, agent.”</p><p>“You single?” asks the agent boldly.</p><p>“Does it matter?” responds Draco, “I’ve actually just been rejected so I’m in a particularly daring mood tonight.”</p><p>The other British agents are whooping, high off adrenaline from the escape, and delighted one of their own is successfully hitting on a CIA handler.</p><p>Draco eyes the laptop and it’s happened. Potter’s vitals are 100% in the zone of high stress. Before Draco can even think about what’s going to happen next the brakes are slammed and the van comes to complete stop.</p><p>“Out,” barks Potter.</p><p>The British agents are confused.</p><p>To be honest, so is Draco.</p><p>“Your extraction point is a quick 4-and-a-half-mile jog to the north and I’ve just been notified of another urgent assignment so I can’t transport you there,” says Potter. And the British agents are well trained and they debark immediately to be on their way.</p><p>Well this is shocking actually. Draco didn’t expect Potter to lie, because he knows there isn’t an urgent assignment - their comms are still linked and nothing has come through from headquarters. And being stopped in the middle of a street still pretty close to the facility in a nondescript white van is dangerous, even more so than either of their too-volatile natures would normally allow. Naturally, Potter then drives off the road and straight into the trees before switching off the car.</p><p>“Update headquarters, tell them we’re fine, but we’re getting off the grid until we resurface back in DC,” barks Potter</p><p>“Off the grid?” asks Draco, terrified. Off the grid means everything off. Off the grid means disposing of his laptop, his comms, his iPhone, his other iPhone, and shutting down their trackers. But Draco does what he’s asked because he’s never seen Potter so commanding, well so commanding directed at him before and Potter’s vitals are still peaking at high stress levels when he kills the laptop which can not be a good sign.</p><p>Potter throws open the back doors of the van.</p><p>“Draco,” says Potter, “Draco, we need to talk.”</p><p>“Harry,” says Draco.</p><p>Harry doesn’t tell him not to use his birth name, and when Harry’s shoulders finally relax, Draco feels his own tension dissipate too. God. When had Harry’s state bled into Draco’s state. <em>When?</em></p><p>Draco doesn’t want to talk, he wants <em>to take</em> so he steps out of the van and pushes Harry onto the grass. Harry, just lets him.</p><p>Harry, staring at him with clear green eyes, still shirtless, still very wet, and still a little bit angry just lets Draco push him onto the grass and straddle him. When Draco leans down to kiss him, well, compliant Harry evaporates and Draco is immediately pinned to the grass, <em>not gravel thank god</em>, and his shirt is ripped off. Harry lowers his face until their noses are touching, and Draco swallows nervously, his earlier bravado fading in the face of a very commanding and a very experienced Harry Potter. <em>What’s next?</em></p><p>Everything. Everything is next. Watching Harry fuck on a computer screen is nothing like experiencing it in real life. Draco feels consumed. Harry has fingers that coax him open and leave him trembling for more. Harry has lips that burn against Draco’s throat and sweep across his shoulder. Harry has a tongue that licks across everything, his chest, his teeth, his tongue. Harry has hands that wrap around Draco’s cock and stroke harder and harder. Harry has a thick and heavy cock that makes Draco quiver in anticipation when he feels it press against his hip.</p><p>And lastly, Harry has a voice that’s a bit shaky and betrays that this is maybe different from the honey-traps he’s known for setting, for being, because he asks if it’s okay.</p><p>“Can I...do you want to?” Harry is murmuring into Draco’s mouth, “we can wait until next time.”</p><p>Next time sounds good. But Draco also wants <strong>now</strong> so he says “Please.”</p><p>Draco thinks he’s going to be spun around and fucked from behind, like the blonde was during the last mission. But Harry surprises him and finds an angle that might work while they’re still face to face, almost chest to chest.</p><p>“I <strong>love</strong> how well you fit against me,” is what Harry says when he finally enters Draco carefully, taking his time to make sure Draco has time to adjust because fuck, Harry is <em>big</em>. Still, it’s too slow so Draco hisses “faster” into Harry’s ear and can actually feel Harry’s cock twitch inside him when he says it.</p><p>Still, Harry just says “take it easy” and doesn’t make any move to go any faster and it infuriates Draco, who really wants <em>now</em>. Draco presses down hard, almost all the way, and almost screams because it’s half pain and half pleasure but <strong>loves </strong>that it makes Harry gasp and groan out “god Draco you feel so good” that it makes it worth it.</p><p>This definitely isn’t Agent Black laying a honey-trap. It can’t be. Because every time Draco says <em>Harry</em>, Harry thrusts harder and then tries to slow down. Until Draco finds a nice spot on Harry’s shoulder where he can bite down and it draws blood which almost seems to convey the message he wants to convey. <em>Don’t treat me like I’m fragile</em>.</p><p>“If you,” Draco starts to say but then gasps when Harry hits something that makes him see stars, “if you break me while fucking me I will suck you off every day for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Harry laughs, “you threw a chair at me while hiding under a desk because I broke your arm on accident 10 years ago, I think I need to be careful.”</p><p>Draco growls, “this is different, I want this.”</p><p>Harry meets his eyes, “you were asking for it back then too,” he says, but complies and finally, <em>finally</em> start fucking Draco like he means it. It’s hard and fast and Draco is whining because it’s so good and everything he imagined it would be. Draco wishes he had enough energy so he could prop himself up and also watch what he can feel is a thick, heavy cock thrusting in and out of him, his ass clenching tightly around Harry. Harry is too good at the rhythm, and reading Draco’s body, and knowing what angles make Draco see more and more stars. Draco comes hard and clutches, scratches, at Harry’s back when he does. Harry doesn’t seem to mind, but then slows down the pace. Draco is baffled because has no idea what Harry likes and wants Harry<em> to lose control, </em>not liking this now calm and measured pace.</p><p>But Draco knows how to find out because he’s Harry’s handler and knows how to experiment. Draco tangles his fingers into Harry’s hair and pulls his lips close to his ear so he knows Harry will hear.</p><p>“Harry,” says Draco, which only elicits a pleased sigh in response now.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” gasps Draco, which elicits a much deeper thrust that makes Draco's ass burn.</p><p>“Harry Potter,” gasps Draco and also tries to meet Harry’s thrusts deliberately, squeeze around his cock, and yank on Harry’s hair all at the same time.</p><p>Draco watched Harry fuck someone for an hour and knows that Harry knows how to get someone to come. He also knows Harry knows how to get himself to come. But he doesn’t want that. <em>He</em> wants to make Harry come.</p><p>So Draco experiments and discovers that Harry does like it when Draco gasps out his full name.</p><p>Harry likes it even more when Draco throws his head back and bares his pale neck because Harry always groans and reaches to kiss his neck but because Draco’s so much shorter, if Draco bends back too far then Harry has to reach too far and bend too far down to kiss his neck, which causes Harry to lose the rhythm of his thrusts. And then when Harry’s cock <em>almost </em>slips out, the head poised at the rim of Draco's ass, Draco pushes back as hard as he can on to Harry's cock, as deep as he can, and Harry <em>finally</em> loses it with a few erratic thrusts.</p><p>Harry comes and Draco can feel the power behind it as Harry groans and shudders pulls Draco tight against him.</p><p>“You,” says Harry, “are amazing.”</p><p>“I know,” says Draco, smugly, “you’re welcome.”</p><p>Harry sprawls onto his back beside him.</p><p>“This was... highly... unprofessional,” sighs Harry, still panting.</p><p>“I don’t think we’ve ever been professional,” says Draco, “not since you pinned me down on the floor of your boss’s office and pressed a gun into my forehead.”</p><p>“Ah,” says Harry, “I forgot about that. Did that turn you on?”</p><p>Draco reaches over and tries to slap him but Harry, lethal killing machine that he is, catches his arm like it’s nothing.</p><p>“Don’t hit me,” says Harry, “I already let you bite me and scratch me.”</p><p>“Or what,” says Draco, “you’re going to twist it and break it like in high school?”</p><p>“Fuck,” says Harry rubbing his eyes, “this is extremely inappropriate.”</p><p>“Whatever,” says Draco, “nobody has to know.”</p><p>And then because Draco wants to make sure they’re doing this again, says “my place or your place next time because I am not fucking in a forest again like an animal.”</p><p>“Mine,” says Harry.</p>
