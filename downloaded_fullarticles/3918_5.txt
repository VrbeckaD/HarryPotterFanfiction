  <span>Harry grinned as she felt the cool wind rush through her hair as she speed through the sky; keeping mostly to the clouds to avoid risking being spotted by a muggle, just as an extra precaution. But she was so lost in the pure joy she felt when flying that she failed to spot the person--persons--in front of her, and barreled right into them. Shaking her head to clear her mind; she opened her mouth to apologize, but seeing that the person wasn’t on a broom or anything shocked her and instead all she said was, “what the fuck!? How!?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You bumped into us...er lady--” the one actually doing the flying started to say.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean how!?” His (obvious) brother interrupted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry sighed, used to people being confused about her gender. “You’re flying </span>
  <em>
    <span>without </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span>. How. The. Fuck. Are. You. Doing. It? A levitation charm or something?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re talking nonsense. Talk sense.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And with that I’m even more confused.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The three of them just stared at each other for awhile in confusion, before Harry speed off.</span>
