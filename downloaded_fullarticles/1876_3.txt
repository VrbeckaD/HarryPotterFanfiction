  <strong>12:57. Saturday 22nd June 1991 – Bristol Zoo Reptile House.</strong>
</p><p>It is Saturday morning, I am in Bristol at the Zoo and, as far as I am concerned, everything about the day as it has so far progressed has been random chance - but was it?</p><p>Following a whim, and to celebrate my 23rd birthday, I’d decided to take advantage of the summer weather, leave London for the day, and visit Bristol Zoo. With hindsight I think it was the West Country drawing me back as the Zoo was one of the few places I have memories of going to on childhood trips with Mum. While I was growing up she hadn’t got a car and in consequence, therefore, we didn’t go to many places outside the village; the Zoo had been one of the few regulars as the church, and several other local groups, organised coach trips.</p><p>You often hear, or read, the clichéd phrase “life changing moment” used to describe incidents in which other people have been involved. However, to experience one yourself is an extreme rarity, such that when one does happen it comes as a total surprise.</p><p>It was hot outside, so I’d not long entered the vivarium, or Reptile House. Although I didn’t know it yet, for me, Edgar Huntspill, the next few minutes were going to change my life forever.</p><p>
  <strong>13:02. Saturday.</strong>
</p><p>The disappearance of the glass was undoubtedly my first surprise of the day, the boa constrictor emerging and appearing to talk to the boy with the scar was an even greater surprise; discovering that I could understand the conversation was the total shock. It was entirely unexpected, how could I understand a snake? It had never occurred before, but then again as I didn’t keep a snake as a pet, they weren’t something I came across that often.</p><p>A few seconds later, even with my brain still spinning thoughts like a Catherine wheel in full burn, rational thought broke through: as rushing up to random creatures and trying to emulate Dr Dolittle by talking to them is generally the way of madness, even if other creatures also speak in whatever language the snake was speaking in, how would you know you could converse? Was it speaking in snake tongue or just a general animalese? I began to rationalise and a bit of clarity began emerging from the initial shock and it dawned on my sub-conscious that snakes obviously don’t speak the same language as dogs and cats. People, including me, do talk to dogs and cats and similar pets all the time, but they don’t talk back, what communication we get back from them is definitely non-verbal. Clearly therefore either dogs and cats don’t speak at all, or it isn’t in a language that humans can hear or, weirdly, something else very unusual was occurring here.</p><p>The family with the fat boy were yelling and making a fuss, that started a general outbreak of screaming and rush for the doors. I was not panicking, well not that much anyway, I was just struggling to make sense of the scene. I am sure the Zoo’s alarms regarding escaped livestock would have been silent to avoid panic amongst the public but someone in the crowd must have activated a fire alarm. Possibly banging open the crash bar on the Fire Door had triggered it. That door was now open and the boa constrictor was quietly gliding towards it, with the public backing away and giving it as much room as they could whilst still trying to get their own groups together.</p><p>Once my brain stopped swirling, well maybe not stopped exactly, but, like an old analogue record player definitely notching back from 78rpm to a stately 33, I followed the snake towards the Fire Exit door. This is stupid I’m thinking, well the rational side of my brain was thinking that, but at the same time also irrationally knowing I have to help it, have to talk to it. I have never conversed with a non-human creature, there isn’t really a choice, I simply have to learn more.</p><p>The loudspeaker announcement shortly afterwards “Will all visitors to the Zoo please proceed immediately to the exits.” seemed overkill, the snake was harmless, but maybe I was the only one who had heard it say it was harmless and just wanting to go home. Well it is a big snake, and boa constrictors have a bad reputation, I have to grant the management that, and unfortunately the panic created by the incident was spreading.</p><p>Time passed in that weird way it does in an emergency and whether it was one, five or ten minutes later I couldn’t tell but the snake and I were outside the snake house hiding in some bushes.<br/>
“You heard me, didn’t you”, it said.<br/>
Without thinking such a thing was impossible, I replied “Yes, you want to escape to Brazil, but first we have to get you out of here without you getting caught.”</p><p>The irrational brain was taking over again, the rational screaming - you’re talking to a snake, getting involved. The half brain beginning to evaluate ways of getting a giant snake unnoticed out of the Zoo compound and, for that matter, myself too given that the booming loudspeakers were telling us we were all supposed to be going to the exits, and going now! The rational brain again, how can you be talking and understanding a snake? How does the snake know it needs to go to Brazil anyway, it’s Zoo bred, the sign said so, born here in Bristol? I spied the Zoo security team making their sweep so squatted down, getting as close to the ground as possible, hiding behind a clump of bushes and the ice-cream concession hut.</p><p>I had no idea why I was hiding, or why I was getting involved.</p>
