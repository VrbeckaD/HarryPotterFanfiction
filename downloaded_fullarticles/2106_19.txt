    <p>This is a choose your way story, there are multiple endings and different routes you can take.<br/>
Of course, my main character is Harry Potter because I think he’s a little cinnamon roll, so take your pick and let’s begin.</p>
<p>Harry as an incubus : Page 1 (if you're using the chapter select, then it is chapter 2) <br/>
Harry as a catboy : Page 2 (chapter 3 on chapter select) <br/>
Harry as an omega : Page 3 (chapter 4 on chapter select) </p>
<p>Warnings:<br/>
There will be some explicit scenes in this story, some are pretty not-vanilla so if you're not into alien sex and oviposition, there are some story lines for you (which will be marked) but some are not, so be aware of that. </p>
<p>Also, I do not run a daycare nor am I able to moderate who is reading this, I only ask that if you're under 18 you do not read it. Of course I can't stop you if you do, but if there are any parents that might start coming at me for this - which is purely a piece of fictional art - don't. </p>
<p>There will be ABSOLUTELY NO suicide or blood or anything of the sort, so if that is your trigger than don't worry about it.</p>
