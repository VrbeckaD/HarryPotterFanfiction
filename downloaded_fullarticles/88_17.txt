    <p>“Morning, Weasley,” shouted a tall, pudgy man by the name of Neville Longbottom from the harshly lit breakroom. Ginny Weasley halted in the middle of the narrow hallway, only for a moment, to flash a smile and a nod towards DC Longbottom. It was going to be one hell of a day, and there wasn’t a molecule of time to spare.</p><p>Ginny continued down the cheaply carpeted hall that led to her office at an abrupt pace. Her hair, marmalade in color, was pulled back into a tight ponytail that swished to the motion of her fast moving steps. A few stray strands of baby hairs were stubbornly harassing Ginny’s nude lipgloss. Her tailored pantsuit, a charcoal color, matched the thundering October skies outside that were heavy with rain.</p><p>She reached her office at the end of the hallway on the right. She opened the heavy oak door, slipped inside, and flicked the light switch. The light panels overhead hummed to life as she sank into her generic desk chair. Her office was a mess -- files strewn about, stacks of old papers in need of shredding sitting sadly in the back right corner of the room. Ginny often swore to herself that she would tidy up her office. However, on this morning, the thought didn’t cross her mind.</p><p>Sitting in front of her was a fairly thin manila file. Ginny opened it hastily, and the front page bore back at her. Clipped to it was a photograph of a middle-aged gentleman with thinning white hair that barely graced his shoulders. Wrinkles and creases of various depths and sizes riddled the man’s face: crow’s feet bursting from the corner of his pale eyes, three parallel lines rested on his forehead, and his mouth, which was stretched into a grin, was surrounded by a pair of pruney parentheses.</p><p>Ginny turned from the photograph to the information given on the first page. There listed everything she needed to get started, she hoped. As she carefully scanned the page, she quickly realized that she would be consuming copious amounts of coffee in the near future.</p><p>Xenophilius Lovegood, age 45, was last seen on the 2nd of October 2009. His adult daughter, Luna Lovegood, reported him missing. There was a pool of blood found at the bottom of the staircase, and DNA was being tested for a match. There were no notes or text messages insinuating a holiday or any mention of relocation.</p><p>Ginny let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding and shut the file. The information given was minimal. She did, of course, need to take into account the fact that Lovegood had only been reported missing three hours ago. But still.</p><p>Ginny stood up, her fatigued muscles already protesting her leaving the chair, and stuffed the file in her leather briefcase. It was time to visit Luna Lovegood.</p><p>***</p><p>Luna Lovegood’s flat, according to the GPS, was roughly thirty minutes from her office building. As Ginny wove through the London traffic, sheets of cold rain drops were finally being relinquished from the clouds’ grips up above. Ginny was quite good at tuning out the sound of rain. Mulling over the most logical theories, she nervously drummed her dried out fingers on the steering wheel — a nervous habit. No one liked meeting with family members.</p><p>She arrived at approximately 8:30. The rain was now coming down in great lashes, and she used her briefcase as a shield over her head. The building the flat was located in wasn’t in the best condition -- weather worn, the smell of mildew on the front steps, but Ginny wasn’t surprised. Hardly anyone could afford London those days.</p><p>After entering the dank building, Ginny located the flat number of said Luna Lovegood on the second landing. As she walked through the building, she noticed the walls were particularly thin. The sounds emitting from each flat she passed was different on this stormy Saturday: the television, a cat meowing, sex, perhaps more television. As Ginny reached number 111 at the end of the hall, lights flickering up above, a feeling of nostalgia hit her. She, herself, had grown up in a rickety house her parents had built in the countryside. They simply couldn’t afford anything else, especially considering the fact that Ginny was the youngest of seven. Her parents still lived there. She supposed she ought to visit them soon.</p><p>Knocking on the door, a wave of adrenaline hit her. Ginny didn’t know what she was going to get with the daughter: a sobbing mess, closed off, or hostile. It was always a variation of one of those three options. Ginny heard light footsteps, and the door creaked open. A woman, roughly her own age, stood before her. Her hair, the color of wheat at the end of summer, fell in waves down to her elbows. The woman’s eyes were bloodshot, presumably from crying, and her deep grey irises looked strange against the microscopic red veins surrounding them. She was dressed oddly -- a fuzzy blue sweater, a long paisley skirt the color of a burnt sky, and two tall, mismatching socks. Ginny, observing these things in a matter of seconds, gathered herself together.</p><p>“Luna Lovegood? I’m DC Weasley. I know some of my colleagues were here earlier, but I’ve been assigned your case. I’m here to follow up with any more questions I have. May I come in?” asked Ginny in her professional, monotone voice.</p><p>“Yes, of course. I’m sorry the place is a bit of a wreck. I was in the middle of preparing for an art show when...well...” Luna’s voice trailed off at the end, and Ginny glanced around the flat as she stepped inside. The walls, painted the color of an off-white eggshell, were hardly plain. Paintings, sculptures, potted plants, and a variety of candles left little exposure to bare surfaces. A sand colored couch was pushed against the left living room wall, and in front of it sat a paint stained tarp, an easel, and several canvases strewn with paint. The paintings were peculiar -- it looked as though they were depicting orbs of light, and on the largest canvas, these orbs were painted over what seemed to be a swirling river. Ginny didn’t know anything about art, but even she could tell that the paintings were breathtaking.</p><p>“Please, have a seat. It’s not a very comfortable couch, I’m afraid. Shall I put on the kettle?” offered Luna, and Ginny graciously took up the offer. While Luna busied herself in the kitchen, Ginny took another opportunity to glance around the living room area. The space seemed both very personal and detached at the same time. While there were personal artifacts, Ginny was very quick to notice that there were next to no photographs. And, when she’d come in, she hadn’t spotted any in the hallway.</p><p>Luna came back with tea and biscuits. Ginny took the tea thankfully. Luna sank into an armchair across from the couch -- a somewhat awkward but appropriate distance away -- and waited for Ginny to go to work. The storm outside was getting louder, and Ginny could hear the building’s drain pipe dripping with rain water.</p><p>“So, Ms. Lovegood, can you tell me about this morning?” asked Ginny, taking out a notepad and ballpoint pen. Luna shifted, and her eyes slightly watered.</p><p>“Of course. Um, well, I was supposed to have dinner with my dad last night, but he never showed. I was concerned, of course, but it wasn’t unusual for him. He’s...flighty. He runs a magazine, The Quibbler, so he’s constantly going off to do research for articles. I had stayed up -- I always do when he doesn’t show -- and began to panic. Whenever my dad goes off, he always texts or calls after a few hours,” Luna sniffled and then continued, “anyways, this was at about 3 a.m. I arrived at his cottage in Snodland at around 4:20. The door was unlocked and not fully shut. I went in, hoping I wasn’t going to find him dead. Instead, at the bottom of the staircase, I saw a pool of blood. There was...a lot. I quickly searched all of the rooms in the house, but he wasn’t there.That was when I called the police on my mobile. I don’t know exactly what time that was. I’m sorry. Local Police got there around 5, I suppose,” Luna sighed and wiped a silent tear that was rolling down her cheek. She looked exhausted. As Ginny made notes, her heart ached for her. She knew what it was like to have a family member go missing. Fred, one of her many older brothers, disappeared when she was in her late teens. His body turned up three months later, but they never caught the killer. Fred’s case motivated Ginny to pursue this line of work. She didn’t want other families to go through what hers had experienced.</p><p>“Alright. I appreciate you going through all of that again, Ms. Lovegood; I know that wasn’t easy. I’m going to be driving to your father’s cottage later this afternoon. Now, your mother has passed. Is that correct?” Ginny asked. She always hated this part -- talking.</p><p>“Yes. She died when I was nine. She was a scientist. I saw her die. There was an explosion,” stated Luna, trying to pull herself together.</p><p>“And I’ve noticed that you don’t have many photos of friends or family. Why is that?” Ginny prodded further.</p><p>Luna looked confused, but she did answer the question. “Well, I’ve never had many friends. I was always bullied at school. People called me ‘Loony Lovegood.’ I tried to not let it bother me, though. Life is so much more than us. We’re but small specs on an ever stretching planet.” Luna shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>“Did your father have any enemies, Ms. Lovegood?”</p><p>The questions were all routine, but it was Ginny’s job to ask. She flipped to the next page in her notebook.</p><p>“Well, I suppose. His magazine is quite controversial. He’s not afraid to expose the government, you see,” Luna answered.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Ginny was, quite frankly, not sure what kind of family she was dealing with.</p><p>“The government is being run by an underground gang called the Death Eaters. No one knows this, and my father has been trying to expose them. He gets threats regularly in the mail, but that’s been going on for years.”</p><p>Ginny internally groaned. She was dealing with conspiracy theorists. Great. Ginny had heard of the Death Eaters, but no one had properly looked into it, as it was simply a crock of shit.</p><p>“Right. Well, I’ll be looking into all possibilities. I’ll keep you updated.”</p><p>And with that, Ginny stood up. Luna followed suit, and they walked towards the door. There was an empty, awkward silence between them as Ginny’s heels clacked against the scuffed hardwood floor. Luna pulled the door open for her.</p><p>“Thank you, DC Weasley. I appreciate all your help. If you need anything, please let me know,” Luna said.</p><p>“Of course. Thank you for your cooperation. We’ll be in touch.”</p><p>They shook hands, and then Ginny was on her way.</p><p>Once she was back in her car, she leaned her head on the steering wheel and let out a low, audible groan. The angry black clouds were growling, and an occasional flash of white light hit the sky. This wasn’t helping Ginny’s mood. The family was strange, no doubt about it, and the pool of blood at the cottage certainly provided a mystery of sorts. She sat upright, rubbed her eyes, and started the car. The motor rumbled to life, and Ginny began her hour and a half journey to Snodland.</p><p>***</p><p>Ginny arrived at Xenophilius Lovegood’s cottage at one o’clock, having stopped on the way at a local sandwich shop for lunch. When she heard about the case, she dashed into work so quickly that she had forgotten to grab breakfast.</p><p>The cottage sat alone on a small, grassy hill near the River Medway. The first thing Ginny noticed when she walked up to the house, which blended into the grey colored sky, was the odd amount of wind chimes hanging from the front porch. There must have been at least twenty, and they were all making god-awful clanging noises as the wind aggressively blew them. There were large ones, small ones, and ones that didn’t even look like wind chimes but seemingly were. A rocking chair sat on the white painted porch, and it moaned with every breath the wind took. There was yellow crime scene tape angrily taped over the navy blue door. Ginny let herself in.</p><p>The place was a mess. Ginny turned on her torch and hesitantly stepped through the doorway. Her beam of yellow light caught flecks of dust floating through the air as she walked past the entryway and into the living room. Mr. Lovegood certainly wasn’t a tidy man. There were stacks of newspapers strewn about the place, and a cork board with photos of people in Black robes pinned in lines hung above a desk that sat under the living room window. Ginny inspected the cork board further. Each photo, all black and white, had names written under them: Tom Riddle, Luscious Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange, Fenrir Greyback, Barty Crouch Jr., Igor Karkaroff, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Vincent Crabbe Sr., Gregory Goyle Sr., Antonin Dolohov, and Severus Snape. Each photo was clearly candid -- the subjects blatantly unaware that their photograph was being taken -- and yet each face seemed to naturally rest in a stone cold snarl. Ginny took out her pad of paper and quickly made note of these names. Those who were first on the scene would have taken photographs of the house, so she would collect a photo of the cork board from that division back at the office. It was now time to move onto the pool of blood.</p><p>Ginny located the staircase off of the kitchen. There was a splatter of blood on the bottom of the banister, almost as though Lovegood’s head had been smashed against it, and there were small droplets on the bottom step. The curious -- and nearly out of place -- thing was the pool of blood on the floor, a deep crimson red. It had dried at this stage, but the effect was nothing less. Ginny hypothesized that Lovegood had been cut in some manner. With this amount of blood loss, he would either be critically injured or dead. She hoped it wasn’t the latter. Ginny made her notes and moved on to his bedroom, which was located upstairs.</p><p>There was a box on top of the dresser, and Ginny pulled it down in hopes of finding something more about the so-called Death Eaters on the cork board. However, what she found was the complete opposite: old enveloped, at least fifteen years old from the looks of them, with messy handwriting scrawled on the front. She opened the envelope at the very back, feeling nosy, but she reminded herself that this was her job. A clue could be lingering in these envelopes.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Pandora, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hello, my love. Today was your funeral. I still cannot fathom your loss. Luna and I have been filling the house with candles each night in honor of your beautiful spirit. She’s having a tough time, as are we all. I don’t know if she fully understands what has happened. Perhaps her mind is protecting her from what she saw. She wore the black tulle dress with the large bow in the front that you made her for Christmas to your funeral -- along with her different colored polka dot socks; our girl certainly takes after you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I must get dinner ready. I’ll write soon. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I love you with everything I’ve got and more,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Xenophilius </em>
</p><p>Ginny was shocked at what she’d come across  -- an entire box of letters to his dead wife. Lovegood must have certainly loved her. She moved onto the next letter, which was dated the following month.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Pandora, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry for not writing sooner, darling. Luna has been a handful. The kids at school have been calling her names whenever she tries to play with them. You were always better at this than me. I’m not quite sure how to help her, other than to tell her that she’s perfect just the way she is. I remind her that her mum wouldn’t want her to change, and that seems to cheer her up a bit. I’ve also bought her some paint by number kits. I think those will be good for her. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I miss you, my love. The nights are lonely without you. I always go to bed thinking that you’ll be there, and yet you aren’t. Your side of the bed is cold, and your water glass is still on the bedside table. I don’t think I can move it. I don’t know if I ever will.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> I love you with everything I’ve got and more, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Xenophilius </em>
</p><p>Ginny let out a heavy sigh that was pregnant with heartbreak. She lugged the enormous box downstairs, careful to avoid the blood, and loaded it into the car. The rain had finally dwindled down into a soft, silvery mist.</p><p>The drive back to the office was silent. Ginny mulled over everything she’d discovered at Lovegood’s house: the board, the blood, and the letters. She felt, somehow, that they were all connected. Perhaps she could find out more about the peculiar family through the letters. And, with that, discover the significance of the Death Eaters. She still didn’t know why Lovegood was so determined to catch them. Ginny didn’t even know if the conspiracy was real.</p><p>***</p><p>Back at the office, the rest of the day was rather monotonous. Ginny filled out crime scene paperwork until six o’clock, at which point she declared it time to go home. There was a strong wind blowing, and the car slightly swayed with it on the motorway.</p><p>Ginny’s house was located right outside of London. It was a fine flat -- it was home, anyways. Unlocking the door, she couldn’t help but feel excited to go through the letters. As she entered the flat, she immediately headed towards the wine stained couch and plonked the heavy box on it. She then crept slowly towards the bedroom.</p><p>Ever since her breakup with her long term girlfriend, Parvati, the bedroom was painful to enter. The bedroom held so many memories and emotions. Ginny had needed to purchase new sheets, as the old ones had been slept in by Parvati. They had even smelled like her rose perfume.</p><p>Parvati had cheated on her with a woman named Lavender. She was a co-worker of Parvati’s. They were apparently very happy together. Bitterness filled Ginny’s body. She looked around the room and was reminded of everything she no longer had. They had scrimped and saved so they could purchase a beautifully hand carved wardrobe. It sat in the corner of the room, mocking Ginny’s heartbreak. She shook her head, trying to empty her mind of the ghosts, and stood up to change out of her work clothes. She pulled out thick flannel pajamas from the dresser and got dressed. She angrily threw her shoes onto the floor. She then walked into the bathroom located just outside the bedroom and stripped herself of makeup. Slowly the clusters of freckles covering her skin emerged.</p><p>Ginny walked quickly out of the bathroom, anxious to get away from that part of the flat, and heaved herself onto the couch. Completely forgetting to fix herself dinner, she dove into the box. The wind howled as she pulled out the third letter.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Pandora, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s nearing Christmas time. The entire town is lit up in twinkling lights. You always said it was the one time of year that the stars landed on earth. I make a point of driving Luna around to see the decorations. It’s almost like you’re here. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I love you with everything I’ve got and more, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Xenophilius </em>
</p><p>Tears slipped out of Ginny’s eyes. She remembered the first Christmas without Fred. It was bleak and miserable. No matter how many years had passed, it never felt the same.</p><p>Ginny fell asleep on the couch, a letter clutched tightly to her chest. The rain had picked up again, and the wind rattled the living room window. There was an occasional flash of lightning which illuminated the room, if only for a brief second. Somewhere off in the distance was Xenophilius Lovegood.</p>
