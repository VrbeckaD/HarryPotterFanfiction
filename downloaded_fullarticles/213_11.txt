</p><p> </p><p>           “Hermione! Hermione Granger-Weasley, you are not going to <em>believe</em> what I just found out!”</p><p>            “Angie?” Hermione called from upstairs. “I’m in the loo! Hold on!”</p><p>            “Can’t wait!” Angelina Weasley yelled back, dropping her bag at the front door and taking the stairs two at a time. “You’re sitting down anyway, yeah?” Harry followed his sister-in-law up the stairs at a more sedate pace. She still hadn’t acknowledged his presence in what was—no, really, it<em> was</em>—his own house.</p><p>            “Oh, for heaven’s sake,” Hermione grumbled loudly from behind the door. “I’m on the toilet. Can’t it wait?”</p><p>            “You’re always on the toilet these days,” Angie scoffed. “And if I don’t tell someone about this right bloody now, I am going to explode!”</p><p>            “You could tell me,” Harry finally offered.</p><p>            Angelina waved an impatient hand. “No. You won’t care enough.”</p><p>            “Hello to you, too, Angie,” Harry mumbled in return, sipping at his lukewarm Yorkshire Gold. He grimaced; it just didn’t taste good at room temp.</p><p>            “Fine,” Hermione sighed. “What is it?”</p><p>            Angie’s face lit up with slightly manically glee. “Astoria Malfoy is pregnant.”</p><p>            There was a confused beat of silence on both sides of the loo door. Then Hermione said, “Well, that’s... lovely. Scorpius must be excited.”</p><p>            Angie’s smile spread impossibly wider. “The baby,” she enunciated carefully, “is <em>not</em> Draco’s.”</p><p>            “What?!” Hermione screeched.</p><p>            “What?” Harry repeated, stupidly.</p><p>            “I know!” Angie cried, her hands clasped. “Can you believe it? I heard it from Pansy Zabini just today. Apparently, she’s leaving Malfoy to<em> marry the illegitimate baby’s father</em>.”</p><p>            “No!” Harry and Hermione both gasped.</p><p>            “Yes. Yes. A thousand times <em>yes</em>.” Angie was in raptures of unholy glee.</p><p>            The toilet flushed. “You need to explain,” Hermione called as the sink turned on. “From the beginning. You heard it from Pansy?”</p><p>            “She would know,” Harry nodded, wide-eyed.</p><p>            “She definitely knows,” Angie agreed. She practically vibrated. “Heard it all directly from Astoria. It’s not really a secret; they won’t be able to keep it out of the papers.”</p><p>            “Bloody hell,” Harry said, swiping a hand across his gaping mouth. “Damn. Poor Scorpius.”</p><p>            Angelina’s smile dimmed a little. “Merlin, yeah. Poor kid. Can you imagine doing that to your child?”</p><p>            The bathroom door opened, and Hermione waddled out. Her pregnant belly preceded her into the hall. “Well, if there’s another baby on the way...”</p><p>            “Pansy said she’s nearly three months.”</p><p>            “Bloody hell,” Harry said again with a wince.</p><p>            “Malfoy’s known for over a month, but the divorce proceedings are underway and Pansy figures it’ll hit the press within the week.”</p><p>            “Oh no,” Hermione murmured. “Just in time for Scorpius to return to school.”</p><p>            “It’s a bloody awful mess,” Angie said. Hermione led the way back down stairs toward the kitchen. “Pansy insists it’s all amicable, but that has to be a lie. She said Astoria’s been carrying on the affair for <em>four years</em>.”</p><p>            “My god,” Hermione said. “And Draco had no idea?”</p><p>            “Who the hell knows?” Angie shrugged. “Those Malfoys have always had weird marriages. Lucius and Narcissa were the picture of Death Eater propriety, but his grandfather had a mistress he kept better than his wife.”</p><p>            “But they always seemed... solid,” Harry remarked as he fell into a chair at the kitchen table. “Happy, even.”</p><p>            Hermione tapped the kettle with her wand and pulled out the tea. “It’s impossible to imagine Draco as a cuckold. He’s so incredibly sharp.”</p><p>            “You’ve been working with him, yeah?” Angie asked. “Have you seen him in the last month?”</p><p>            “Not in person.” Hermione shook her head. “Owls. A few Floo calls, but none recently. I haven’t noticed a thing. Have you seen him at work, Harry?”</p><p>            “Not at all. He always goes through Ella Flint when we need a consult.”</p><p>            “Ron has,” Angie frowned. “George says he sees him all the time.”</p><p>            “Yeah. Well.”</p><p>            “Harry avoids Draco,” Hermione snorted. “Hasn’t taken a meeting with him in ages, even though they ask for his help on all kinds of cases.”</p><p>            “Oi!” Harry objected. “It’s not like I’m <em>avoiding</em> him. I just don’t need to meet with him directly. He has a rapport with Flint. They’re both Slytherins.”</p><p>            “Astoria isn’t,” Hermione said thoughtfully. “She Sorted Hufflepuff. First in the family, I believe.”</p><p>            “Malfoy married a Hufflepuff?” Harry said, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>            “A Pureblood Hufflepuff,” Angie said, “from a long line of Slytherins. And she raised another one without any problem, didn’t she?”</p><p>            “So did I,” Harry smiled and shrugged.</p><p>            “Ha. True.”</p><p>            “I just can’t believe Astoria would do that to Draco,” Hermione puzzled. “For four years? I know she respects him. I would’ve bet Galleons she loved him, too.” She rubbed her belly with one hand while she poured boiling water into the waiting teapot.</p><p>            “Well, according to Pansy, she does,” Angie said, tossing her Charmed-blonde bangs to one side. “She said the affair wasn’t really an affair at all. That Malfoy knew about the other man all along, and they’re only splitting because of the baby.”</p><p>            “That makes no sense,” Hermione said. “If he knew about the affair, why wouldn’t they divorce before now?”</p><p>            “Scorpius?” Angie said. “People stay together for the kids all the time.”</p><p>            “I suppose.”</p><p>            “I’ve never heard one word about Malfoy having affairs,” Harry offered. “Have you?”</p><p>            Angie shifted a little in her seat, as if she were suddenly uneasy. “Rumors. Nothing but whispers, and everyone’s always talked <em>around </em>it. If you know what I mean.”</p><p>            “I really don’t,” Harry frowned.</p><p>            “Well...” Angie accepted a cup of tea from Hermione, and the look they exchanged was loaded with meaning. “Like I said, nothing but rumors.”</p><p>            Harry looked back and forth between them, still frowning. “What rumors?”</p><p>            Hermione sighed, sinking back in her chair. “When Draco and Astoria got engaged, there was a—well, a—”</p><p>            “Rumor?” Harry deadpanned.</p><p>            “Right. Yes. A rumor that Draco... played for the other team, as it were.”</p><p>            Harry blinked at her. “Draco Malfoy is gay?”</p><p>            “It’s been said,” Angie nodded. “Apparently, he never dated at Hogwarts. Not for lack of interest.”</p><p>            “He was a bit <em>busy</em>, as I recall,” Hermione remarked.</p><p>            “True, which is why these are only rumors. Just because a bloke turns down offers doesn’t make him bent.” Angie sipped her tea and shot Harry a sharp, knowing look. “For that matter, accepting offers wouldn’t make him straight, either.”</p><p>            Harry’s ears and cheeks heated. “Shut up.”</p><p>            “But Draco never dated <em>at all</em>. He simply announced his engagement to Astoria, and that was that.” Hermione leaned back in her chair, wincing a little. “The Sacred Twenty-Eight are strange about courtship, anyway, but Draco was famously unavailable. It was considered quite a coup when Astoria landed him, no matter the Mark on his arm.”</p><p>            “He’s rebuilt the Malfoy fortune single-handedly,” Angie agreed, smiling a bit wickedly. “An odd looking bloke, isn't he? But he's good on a broom.”</p><p>            Hermione laughed. Harry scowled.</p><p>            “I thought he dated Parkinson in school,” Harry said.</p><p>            Angie tugged on the cuff of her robe. “No, they were never together. Pansy carried a torch for him for years, I reckon, but they were never more than friends.”</p><p>            “Good thing, I guess,” Harry said. At the women’s raised eyebrows, he snorted. “Well, she married Zabini. That’d be awkward, don’t you think?”</p><p>            “Oh, I don’t know. Her husband might like the idea. Blaise has a very Parisian attitude toward sex.”</p><p>            Harry shook his head. “I’ve no idea what that means.”</p><p>            “Oh, <em>Harry</em>,” Hermione laughed.</p><p>            “We’ll tell you when you’re older,” Angie smirked. Then her wand began buzzing, and she cast a quick <em>Tempus</em>. “Ah, damn, I’ve got to go. Meeting with the Irish Quidditch Commission, and then George needs an extra hand with shipment tonight.”</p><p>            “Do you want me to come by?” Harry offered.</p><p>            She waved him off. “No, no, we have it well sorted. Teddy already promised to work overtime.”</p><p>            “I won’t wait up for him, then,” Harry said. Angie hopped to her feet, planting a kiss on Hermione’s cheek and a pat on her round belly.</p><p>            “Ta for the tea, dears,” she called as she hurried back to the front hall. “Tell Ron I want an update on the business with the cursed broomsticks. Sooner, rather than later.”</p><p>            “No problem,” Harry yelled back. The door opened and closed, and there was the distinct <em>pop</em> of disapparition.</p><p>            “Poor Scorpius,” Hermione said again, with a firm rub of her stomach. “Do you suppose Albus knows?”</p><p>            “If he does, he isn’t saying anything to me.” Harry lifted his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. “Not that it’s unusual, mind. He’s locked up tighter than a Gringott’s vault these days.” Hermione made a small humming noise, and Harry sighed. “Go ahead and say it.”</p><p>            “Well, it’s just that you tend to express your opinion of Draco rather... forcefully.”</p><p>            “Malfoy and I are fine,” Harry said, sending her a flat look.</p><p>            “Perhaps,” she hedged, “but you and Ron both tend to cut him up whenever we mention the subject of our school days. Lee and George join in, though heaven knows why—they barely knew him then. It must be difficult for Al, to think you all hate his best friend’s father.”</p><p>            Harry let out a long breath and hooked his hands behind his head. “You’re right, of course.”</p><p>            Hermione quirked a small smile. “Of course.”</p><p>            “It’s habit, at this point,” Harry admitted, and winced. “God, that sounds terrible.”</p><p>            “Draco was a big part of your life during school. You devoted so much attention to him.” Catching his withering glare, she only smiled again. “Really, Harry. You always were a bit obsessed.”</p><p>            “I <em>hate</em> it when you say that.”</p><p>            “And yet...” She shrugged. “Draco is a very different man than he was as a child. And, in point of fact, I’m not sure he was exactly who we thought he was. Even then.”</p><p>            “Why does it matter?” Harry said, a bit petulantly.</p><p>            “Because Scorpius is important to Albus, and Draco is Scorpius’s father, so you’re going to have to see each other, now and again,” Hermione replied primly, raising her brows. “Besides which, you’re 39 years old and this all feels a bit juvenile, don’t you think?”</p><p>            “Tell that to your husband.”</p><p>            “I have. But I’ll make sure he hears me, this time.” Hermione sipped her tea, then wrinkled her nose. She tapped it, and a wordless charm returned the cup to steaming. Harry never remembered to do that. “Anyway, I did have a reason for invading your house first thing on a workday morning.”</p><p>            “A reason? Do you lot need one? I’m fairly sure Angelina wouldn’t have minded if I’d been away from home, actually. I think the password on my front door is <em>Weasley</em>.”</p><p>            “<em>Potter-Weasley</em>,” she retorted. “And yes. A reason.”</p><p>            “All right then,” Harry said agreeably. “You want some toast while you tell me about it?”</p><p>            “Cinnamon-raisin?”</p><p>            “Sure.” Harry pulled the loaf from a cupboard and popped two thick slices into the shiny Muggle toaster. “Go on then. I’m on the edge of my seat.”</p><p>            “Well, all the memorials last year got me thinking...”</p><p>            “Yeah?”</p><p>            “It’s just… twenty years since the war? It doesn’t seem possible, but it really has been twenty years. Twenty-one now. Rose had all these questions about the Order, and Dumbledore’s Army, and the Battle of Hogwarts. At school, her Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is the only professor who will use Voldemort’s proper name.”</p><p>            “Hestia Jones is a treasure.”</p><p>            “She really is. But she isn’t a history professor, and she’s planning to retire soon—apparently, she’s just welcomed her first grandchild, and she wants more time at home.” Hermione drummed her fingers against her belly with a sigh. “The special edition of the Daily Prophet, with all the essays and articles about the war, seemed so <em>incomplete</em>, don’t you think? Almost fantastical. They made you sound like some sort of mythical knight, with a helm and a magic sword.”</p><p>            “The sword was Neville,” Harry joked, and Hermione laughed.</p><p>            “That’s exactly my point! History is being rewritten, twisted into some kind of fairy story. That shouldn’t happen. People should know precisely what Voldemort did, and to whom, and why.” She was animated now, vibrant in her fervor. “They should know what we sacrificed to stop him, so they can prepare themselves. So no one like him ever comes to power again.”</p><p>            Harry put the toast, well-buttered, down in front of his sister-in-law. Her skin was pink along the edges, and she tapped a toe restlessly. “I agree,” Harry said, sitting back down. “So, what’s your plan?”</p><p>            She shot him a narrow look. “My plan?”</p><p>            “Hermione, you always have a plan.”</p><p>            “Ron’s the strategist,” she argued, but she looked pleased as she crunched her toast.</p><p>            “Where do you think he learned it?”</p><p>            “Well—” She took another small bite, swallowed, and met Harry’s eye squarely. “I’m going to write a book.”</p><p>            Harry blinked back at her. “A book?”</p><p>            “Yes. A complete history of the Battle of Hogwarts, with necessary background information and as many first-hand accounts as I can accumulate.”</p><p>            “That’s—that’s <em>brilliant</em>, Mione. Truly.”</p><p>            She quirked a nervous smile. “You think so?”</p><p>            “Of course! You’re the best person for the job. I can’t believe no one thought of it before.”</p><p>            “I did,” she admitted, after another bite. “But it was too—too raw, you know? It felt too soon. And I’ve been so busy at work, and with the children, I couldn’t fathom taking time away for a project like this.”</p><p>            “Rose and Hugo will be so excited,” Harry said. “Their mother’s name on a <em>book? </em>In the <em>library? </em>You’ll be the coolest mum ever.”</p><p>            “Stop it,” she scolded, flushing.</p><p>            “Have you told Ron?”</p><p>            She nodded. “Of course. He thinks I should have done it ages ago, but I don’t think he realizes how long the project will take.”</p><p>            “Months? Years?”</p><p>            “At least a year, I should think. I’ve never written a book before.”</p><p>            “Are you sure?” Harry teased. “Some of your essays for Professor Binns were long enough.”</p><p>            “Shut it, you.”</p><p>            Harry reached out to clasp her hand. She wasn’t wearing her wedding ring today—her hands had been too swollen for weeks. “It’s a good idea, Hermione.”</p><p>            “I’m glad you think so,” she said, squeezing his fingers. “Because you’ll be one of my first interviews.”</p><p>            “Merlin,” Harry grunted, releasing her hand.</p><p>            “I’ll schedule some time in with your secretary. What’s the new one’s name, again?”</p><p>            “Auror Morris.”</p><p>            “Morris, then. How long has she lasted?”</p><p>            Harry gave a self-deprecating shrug. “Two months. She seems competent.”</p><p>            “Has she hit on you yet?”</p><p>            “Not too much,” Harry blushed, gulping tea.</p><p>            “I can’t understand why you don’t get a male secretary, Harry.”</p><p>            “I did. Franklin.” Harry ruffled his hair and sighed. “Asked me to dinner on day three.”</p><p>            Hermione giggled. “Merlin save us from the Potter charm.”</p><p>            “It wasn’t like this when Ginny was—” Harry stopped, swallowing something thick. His tongue, maybe. Hermione’s eyes were soft.</p><p>            “Ginny was a force of nature,” she said. “Nobody would risk her temper.”</p><p>            “Including me,” he smiled. It didn’t feel wholly honest, smiling like that, but he gave it his best. “Now the nutters are coming out of the woodwork.”</p><p>            “The Wizarding World’s most eligible bachelor,” Hermione said. She finished her toast in two crisp bites.</p><p>            “Widower, not bachelor,” he reminded her.</p><p>            “Yes. Of course. I am sorry, Harry. It must be awful.”</p><p>            “It’s fine,” he lied, still smiling. “No one’s sent me a love potion in ages.”</p><p>            “Just like being back at school, eh?”</p><p>            “It is that,” he agreed, finally grinning with teeth.</p><p>            “You know, there’s a very effective antidote potion on the market now. You can take it preemptively, which is quite clever. We’ve been stocking them in the women’s shelters. Tastes like almond cake.”</p><p>            “Really?” Harry perked up. “Can you get me some?”</p><p>            She finished her tea and climbed carefully to her feet. “Sure. We order in bulk from the supplier.”</p><p>            “Mulpepper’s?”</p><p>            “Yes. But you’ll never guess who developed the formula.”</p><p>            Harry frowned. “Who?”</p><p>            Hermione grinned at him, a bit impishly. “Draco Malfoy, of course.”</p>
