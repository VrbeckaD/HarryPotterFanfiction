    <p>Hermione hadn't been sure if she should go back to Hogwarts for her eighth year as the Ministry had sent her a letter saying they'd be happy to have her work for them, with or without her NEWT qualifications. But when she realised what a bad state her best friend was in, she was glad she had accepted Professor McGonagall's invitation.

Ron wasn't there. He'd gone straight into Auror training, as a way to distract himself from his brother's death. The last time they had spoken, Hermione could tell it was helping him, as he sounded much happier.</p><p>The same could not be said for Harry.</p><p>There had been a long break before term started again, as the castle needed to be rebuilt to its original glory. When the letter for that news had come through, Harry had ignored it. Well, he hadn't even read it. The post from all of his 'fans' had begun piling up at the door, but the chosen one could simply not bring himself to read them. So, instead, he went to bed and never got up again.</p><p>It was only when Hermione got back from Australia after getting her parents that he even ate anything.</p><p>Hermione remembered that morning well. She had managed to restore her parents' memories, much to her relief, and had sent Harry an owl to tell him she was coming over. After apparating to a small clearing near 13 Grimmauld Place, expecting to have the place reveal itself to her, but to her surprise it was already there. The charms that all the Order members have placed seemed to have disbanded as each of them died.</p><p>She rang the doorbell Arthur Weasley had installed, waiting patiently on the doorstep for her best friend to open the door. Several minutes passed, and, simply assuming Harry had fallen back to sleep, Hermione nudged the door. To her surprise, it wasn't locked. She nudged it again, this time with her shoulder and after another minute or two, the door flew open, hundreds and thousands of letters flew through the air and landed on the floor.</p><p>"Harry?" she had called, wading through the river of paper, "Aren't you up yet?"</p><p>She had a look around the place. All the hard work Mrs Weasley had put into it was gone, as every surface was coated with dust.</p><p>"Harry, I'm going to come upstairs, okay?" she said, loud enough that her voice would carry up to her best friend's room. She was hoping not to awaken the unpleasant portrait that was permanently stuck to the wall.</p><p>She walked up the steps and opened the door to Sirius' childhood bedroom. The room didn't smell very refreshing. The stench of sweat and dust clutched the air, making Hermione wrinkle her nose. There were a couple of empty glasses on the bedside table. In the bed, curled up in a ball, was Harry James Potter.</p><p>"Harry, love, are you okay?" she asked him, perching on the edge of the bed, "I don't think you've left here in a while, have you?"</p><p>"Can't," he muttered, rolling over, "It's- it's all my fault. The war."</p><p>"It's not your fault. It was You-Know-Who who started it all, and perhaps Dumbledore's fault too," she said softly, trying not to cry.</p><p>When she got no response, Hermione knew that what she was saying wasn't going through to her best friends’ head. She decided to try something else.</p><p>"Hasn't anyone come around to check on you?" she asked, not expecting a coherent reply.</p><p>"Ginny won't talk to me. Neville and Luna don't know that this place exists."</p><p>Ah, Hermione had forgotten about the breakup. </p><p>"I'm sorry I didn't come over sooner. I didn't know how bad the aftermath hit you," she said sadly, running a hand through his unkempt hair.</p><p>"'s okay, Hermione. You didn't know." the boy muttered. Hermione didn't know what to say to that, because it was her fault. Ron had left and she had left, and Harry must've felt like he had no one.</p><p>"Are you going back to Hogwarts this year?" she urged, needing him to speak. To be the Harry she knew and loved, not this shattered shell of a person barely holding on. She wanted him to be better, she wanted him to be happy. </p><p>"I didn't know we could."<br/>
"You must've missed the letter," she said, "I'm going."</p><p>Harry perked up a bit at that. "You are?"</p><p>"Yeah, the ministry offered me a position, but I thought I should take a break before jumping headfirst into a job."</p><p>"I don't know what I want to do."</p><p>"Why, Harry?"</p><p>"It's always been 'defeat Voldemort'. That's all I needed to do. But now-"</p><p>He didn't finish.</p><p>"You can do anything you want, Harry."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yes, of course. But perhaps you should take a year, make new friends. Build yourself back up again."</p><p>Silence. Then,</p><p>"I'll only go because you are."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Hermione smiled. "Let's get packing."</p><p>-</p><p>“What do you think of the castle, Miss Granger?"</p><p>"It's certainly...different.”</p><p>The turrets, once made of old stone, were now pure gold. What had been Dumbledore's tower before he died also had a new look, now coloured rainbow. It even appeared to sparkle.</p><p>"That was Mr Longbottom," Professor McGonagall told Hermione, after watching her examine it with a bewildered expression on her face, "I let him paint it, and he was feeling... creative." She sounded like she deeply regretted her decision.</p><p>"IT'S BECAUSE HE'S GAY!" screamed Theodore Nott, Neville's boyfriend.</p><p>"Yes, thank you, Mr Nott," McGonagall sighed, "Though his method of revealing that information seemed rather corrupt, he is not wrong. Mr Longbottom is, in fact, gay."</p><p>"That's cool, Neville!" Hermione called out to where the boy had been standing, but he was gone.</p><p>“Do not go looking for him,” the professor warned, “You will not like what you see.”</p><p>Hermione had a feeling there might’ve been a story behind that. She didn’t ask, though. Perhaps McGonagall had walked in on Neville and Theo doing something she deeply wanted to forget.</p><p>“The eighth-year dormitories are down in the dungeons, next to the Slytherin ones.” she continued. “There was an odd number, so one of you won’t have a roommate. I’m not aware of the pairings, so you’ll have to go check the list.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Thank you, Professor,” she said, grabbing Harry’s arm, “We’ll see you at the feast.” </p><p>McGonagall nodded in acknowledgement. “Goodbye, Miss Granger. And you, Mr Potter.”</p><p>And with that, she walked away, her heels making a loud clicking sound against the cobblestoned floor.</p><p>“Harry?” Hermione pulled his arm again. “We have to go check our dorms now.”</p><p>Harry was staring at the astronomy tower with a vacant expression on his face. It wasn’t distraught, exactly, more empty. Like he didn’t know what to feel at all. Hermione turned to look at it too, leaning her head on his shoulder.</p><p>“He fell from there.” The boy said finally. </p><p>“Yes. He did.” Hermione joined her hand with his. They stayed like for a while, staring up at the sky. The sun was beginning to set now, a pretty peach colour. She wondered if it was controlled, like the Great Hall. In this little bubble of protection, away from the rest of the world.</p><p>She tapped his arm, tugging him slightly. “We’ve got to go, now.”</p><p>People were going to wonder where they were, and turning up late would give Harry and unnecessary amount of attention.</p><p>This time, Harry did not resist.</p>
