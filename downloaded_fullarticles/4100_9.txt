    <p>Chapter One</p><hr/>
<p align="left"><strike></strike><u></u>Hermione swore under her breathe as she carefully picked up the shards of broken phials off the floor. Parents really shouldn’t leave their children alone while in the apothecary, it’s filled with glass for Merlin’s sake! Glass bottles filled with potions that could be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Having only opened its’ doors three months ago Witch’s Brew, Hermione’s new business, was still earning its place in wizarding London. She wasn’t sure how she was going to swallow the lost of 20 gallons worth of potions soaking into the once clean floor.</p>
<p>Hermione had taken all of her award money for saving the world from evil and spent it on her small, lovely building in Hogsmead and the supplies to start her own apothecary. While she was slowly building a clientele list, Hermione wasn’t turning enough profit to handle such a large lost. The mother of the rambunctious child had not even offered to pay for the damages and continued to browse just stepping around the mess.<br/>
‘Just keep your head down and take big breathes,’ Hermione thought to herself, ‘strangling a child and his mother would not be good for business.’</p>
<p>Hermione’s thought were interrupted by billowing, black robes sweeping past her ruffling her hair. Professor Snape strode past Hermione’s crouched form stopping right in front of the woman and child.</p>
<p>“I believe you owe Ms. Grange money for the damages your little snot-nosed child has created.” Snape stated in his low, acerbic voice. The same voice the put all his students on edge. Hermione would have shuddered if she hadn’t been so stunned that Snape was in her shop, defending her no less.</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Do not talk about my precious Timothy like that. He’s only a child and she really should put her more expensive potions out of the reach of children.” This woman must have a death wish. No one talked to Snape like that.</p>
<p>“I see,” he paused and crossed his arms over his chest. “Your child is blameless in this situation. His mother seems to be an even bigger idiot. Potions are extremely dangerous. You should have had control over your child, better yet, you should not have even brought him in here! Now you will hand Ms. Granger 20 gallons and remove yourself from this store at once.” Snape had leaned in closer, towering over the mother. He looked powerful and evil. The woman swallowed hard, clutched her son to her side and turned towards Hermione, who was now standing, and started to inch away for Snape. She stopped beside Hermione and dropped the money on the table, “I can’t believe you let people like him in your store. I for one will never shop here again and I will be telling everyone I know to do the same.” The woman then stomped out of the store and slammed the door.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Hermione yelled. A deep, rolling chuckle reminded her she was not alone. Glancing over she said, “Thank you for getting her to pay but I really can't afford to be losing customers!”<br/>
“Then it's a good thing I’m here to make a large order for the school.” Drawled Professor Snape, sounding bored as if he walked into her store everyday to shop.</p>
<p>“I thought you ordered ingredients at the apothecary in Diagon Alley?” Hermione asked dumbly. Her head was racing with questions. How was it she was standing here talking to Professor Snape like it was no big deal? This man had made her school years hell. He degraded her, made fun of her and made her feel down right unintelligent on more than one occasion. She must be dreaming or maybe she inhaled the potion on the floor, what did the kid knock over again?</p>
<p>“Trawnland’s potions have become subpar and his ingredients are not up to even students’ potions quality. I need a new supplier and I heard positive things about a new place called Witch’s Brew. Your shop name is horrible but I’m willing to overlook it if you have a descent supply of nettles and bat livers.” As Snape talked he had begun picking up jars, examining the contents.<br/>
“My ingredients are more than descent,” huffed Hermione. “I’m assuming you have a list of everything you need. If I may see it I will give you everything I have on hand and have the rest to you by Thursday.”</p>
<p>Snape gave Hermione a once over. She still had her same fierce spirit he had observed in her when she was a student of his but he noted that she was no longer a child. She was the same height, around 5’6” he would guess, but she had definitely matured. Her face had lost its youthful roundness, her jawline now sharp and delicate. Gone was her bushy, wild mane, replaced by soft looking, chestnut curls hanging down her chest. She had gained back the weight she lost during the war and was sporting curves in all the right places. ‘Curves?’ Snape mentally slapped himself. She was his former student, best friend of the boy who would not die, and 19 years his junior. He was not checking her out. “Here,” he said as he shove the list into her outstretched hand, “just deliver it all on Thursday. That will be fine, the students don’t arrive for two more weeks. Send the bill to the school.” Then with a nod he strode out, robes billowing as they always did.</p>
<p>Hermione glances down at the list. This was the break she had needed. With Hogwarts business she would step over the “just making ends meet” line, finally able to feel comfortable. Snape unknowingly had saved her twice today. Glancing back up at the door he had just exited Hermione shook her head. Post war life obviously hadn’t changed him much. He was still abrasive, domineering, and a greasy git but something was different. Besides the jab at the name of her shop he seemed almost impressed with her. It was off putting. With a sigh Hermione walked over to the door and turned the sign to close. She normally didn’t close until 6 pm but today had been so taxing. All she wanted to do was quickly finish cleaning up the mess, go upstairs and curl up with a cup of tea and a good book.</p>
