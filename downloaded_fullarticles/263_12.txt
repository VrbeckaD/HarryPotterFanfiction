<hr/><p>Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa never wanted a child in the first place. However knowing they had no choice,they said to hell with it.</p><p>Draco wasn't what they expected a Malfoy heir to be. He didn't complain, whine, or beg constantly. He was just <em>there</em>. Narcissa, knowing that this wasn't normal child behavior, set him up a playdate with Theo Nott.</p><p>At first they didn't say anything. Just stared into each other's eyes. One that's cold and dead, and one that was quickly becoming frightened.</p><p>Theo began to fidget. He asked, "W-would you like to go outside?" Draco didn't say anything. He continued to look at Theo with dead eyes, and watched two red spots appear on Theo's cheeks. Before finally, one black word appeared above his head.</p><p>
  <strong>Ok.</strong>
</p><p>Draco's parents were flabbergasted. Never experiencing this when <em>they</em> asked Draco something. Though when they did it was never, so I really don't know why they're so shocked. Their shock turned to annoyance but they kept it in as Amy and Leopold, Theo's parents, were still present.</p><p>Theo beamed and dragged Draco outside. Chatting excitedly on all the fun they could have. Draco went along.</p><p> </p><p>Never once saying a thing.</p><p>∆∆•••∆∆••∆∆••∆∆</p><p>"Hi, Hogwarts too?" Theo spoke these words to a nice, albeit raggedy, looking boy. He chatted about how his father was going to buy him a racing broom, while Draco silently watched the exchange. He wasn't really surprised that Theo didn't catch on about how this boy was uninterested but, of course, refrained from saying anything.</p><p>"You're all done deary!" Theo jumped down and said goodbye to the secretly annoyed boy. He grabbed Draco's hand and dragged him out the shop. Never noticing how Harry's eyes were trained on Draco.</p><p>Theo and Draco met Amy at Ollivanders. "We're here to get our wands!" Exclaimed the only 11 year old actually willing to speak. Ollivander heard him, but it didn't look it as he continued to gape at the silent child with wide eyes. He swung around and marched to the back of shop. Theo was confused as to why he did that but refrained from commenting.</p><p>Draco didn't really care.</p><p>Ollivander came back with a slender obsidian box. He beckoned Draco forward, and like he was asked, he did.</p><p>"Take it. Free me from the horror that lies inside of this box."</p><p>The seriousness that radiated off of him was extremely concerning, as one would usually describe him as slightly wonky but clearly a very wise man. Draco opened the box to see a black, slightly crooked wand, nestled in red velvet.    </p><p>"11 inches, ebony wood. Its core consists of thestral tail hairs. Slightly flexible."           </p><p>Draco picked it up and <em>immediately</em> the power surged through him. Lights shattered, wand cases were thrown, the walls shook. Draco's eyes began to roll into the back of his head. It ended as quickly as it started. The occupants of the room stared at Draco in shock. How could so much power come from such a little boy? Draco wasn't paying any attention to them.</p><p>How could he when the greatest thing was in his hand?</p><p>He looked at Ollivander and with almost black eyes. The words appeared.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>How much? </strong> </em>
</p><p>∆∆••∆∆••∆∆••∆∆</p><p>"So you're Harry Potter?"Theo questioned.     </p><p>Draco was currently watching Theo butcher any type of friendship he could've had with Potter.</p><p>"My name is Theodore Nott, and this is my best friend Draco Malfoy," Theo gestured in his direction, turning to beam towards him.</p><p>But Draco's eyes we're focused on Harry who could say the same for him.</p><p>"Erm, hi. My name is Harry Potter. It's nice to uh, meet you." Stuttered Harry, ignoring Theo, who didn't seem to mind. Draco only stared at him, making no move to acknowledge his introduction. It was only until Harry started to go red that the words appeared.</p><p><strong>Hello, Potter.</strong> </p><p>That's it. Draco didn't feel the need to say anything further. Harry was clearly very puzzled at what just happened. Theo spotted the confusion and jumped to help, "Oh Draco doesn't like speaking, so he doesn't." It was an acceptable answer right? It was correct even. So <em>why</em>?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><em>Snort</em>.</p><p>In a second Draco's eyes were on the guilty redhead. His eyes flashed, promising a painful death. Ron went pale, as if he ever knew what was going to happen to him if he were to be left alone in a room with Draco.</p><p>Theo, of course, also heard and immediately stepped in to defend Draco. He slandered the Weasley name. Insult after insult until he offered Harry his friendship.</p><p>"I can choose the wrong sort for myself, thanks."</p><p>Theo has never been so offended, he turned pink, glared, and spun around to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Taking Draco with.</p>
