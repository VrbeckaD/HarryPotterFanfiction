        <em>Both </em>
        <em>twin </em>
        <em>sisters</em>
        <em> look at each other when they hear a sound of kid bawling to its </em>
        <em>heart's </em>
        <em>content, slowly both sisters follow where the sound is </em>
        <em>coming</em>
        <em> from when they saw a child none over four years old.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Slowly the twin sister walked, and it is the redhead older sister the one who asked the boy. "Are you alright little one? Are you hurt?" The boy startled and looks over the two girls with wide his wide eye. The one who asked him is the one who has beautiful red hair, it looks like a flame, while the other girl has raven hair and both has such eerie green eyes. What makes them different is the hair colour and one of them is wearing glasses.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Aww, look at him, isn't he cute" The boy </em>
        <em>looked</em>
        <em> at the redhead girl with a wide eye which make the raven-haired girl rolled her eyes. "Ama, you only make the boy scared" The raven hair girl chide on to this Ama girl, which make her look at them with a sheepish look.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Oh, sorry about that. I'm Potter Amaranth and the black hair is my twin Potter Hydrangea. What's your name, and why are you crying?" The red hair girl asked the boy which </em>
        <em>makes the</em>
        <em> boy try to dry his tears "M.. My name is so... Sawada Tsunayoshi. I… Tsu-</em>
        <em>kun</em>
        <em> lost mama, Tsu-</em>
        <em>kun</em>
        <em> can't find mama" The boy, Tsu-</em>
        <em>kun</em>
        <em> tears almost fallen from his eyes again when slowly Amaranth and Hydrangea looks at each other and back to the boy with a smile on their face.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Amaranth swipes away the tears that fall from Tsuna eyes and softly rub on his hair, which make Tsuna look at both girls with wonder. "How about Ama-nee and Hydra-nee help Tsuna find his mama? Is that alright?"</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Tsuna is crying to his </em>
        <em>heart's</em>
        <em> content while hugging both of his sisters. He hates his sister's aunt, uncle and Dudley. They always bully his sister and him, he doesn't like it, whenever the twins come, there will another bruise on them, even mama </em>
        <em>doesn't like</em>
        <em> it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He knew mama already thought the twins are her daughter in her heart. Upon knowing the twins are going back to England is enough to break their heart and worries. Worry that when they return, they can't help the twins in </em>
        <em>defending</em>
        <em> them being abused by that Walrus and Horse-teeth.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Don't go, please don't go, Ama-nee, Haya-nee" Tsuna hug both his sisters with everything he has, while the twins look at each other with a broken heart.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They don't want to return to England since it is their first time </em>
        <em>to feel</em>
        <em> being </em>
        <em>loved</em>
        <em> and have a family.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Tsu-</em>
        <em>kun</em>
        <em>..." Nana tries her </em>
        <em>hardest</em>
        <em> to not cry. She loves the twins like her own daughters. The first time she saw the twins are when they help her Tsu-Kun and since then, she already falls in love with both twins. It's hurt her heart when she knew the twins are being abused by the Dursley, thus she tries to give the love that the twins crave for.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"I'm sorry Tsu, but we have to go. We don't want to and we love you and mama. Both of you </em>
        <em>are</em>
        <em> the first who </em>
        <em>ever gives</em>
        <em> us the love we crave for..." Hydrangea tries to soothe her little brother despite her voice shaky.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"How about we take a picture together and exchange letters? That way, we won't..." Amaranth voice </em>
        <em>croaky</em>
        <em> as she tries to hold her tears.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hearing those ideas enough to make Tsuna, Mama and Hydrangea beam. "Of course! How about we take a picture, and exchange letters"</em>

        <em>Shamal walked around Surrey with cringe whenever he looks at the house, gosh the house looks like a cookie cutter, everything is the same, but halt when he heard a whimper and small sobs. He looks around, there he saw a raven hair little girl with the malnourished body holding another girl with flaming red hair which also malnourished.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Seeing the two girls is enough to make Shamal enraged. How dare of the parents </em>
        <em>make </em>
        <em>these two girls like a living </em>
        <em>Skellington, but</em>
        <em> then something happen which make him look at the girls with wide eyes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He has been </em>
        <em>harmonized</em>
        <em> to one of the girls, and not only that, but he also can </em>
        <em>sense</em>
        <em> that the two girls are quite the strongest Sky he ever knew and the purest too. It feels like he is back home, he never thought he will be </em>
        <em>harmonized</em>
        <em> but here he is </em>
        <em>harmonizing</em>
        <em> to the young little girl.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Without thinking, he walked to the girls.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>What is wrong, </em>
        <em>sweetling</em>
        <em>?" Shamal asked which make the two girls look at him wide eyes and jump a little upon seeing someone asked them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"We, fine." the girls said, try to dismiss the questions as people always dismiss them when they say </em>
        <em>this</em>
        <em>, mantra.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shamal looks over the girls with an unimpressed look which enough to make them squirm as no one ever asked them anything wrong or look at them unimpressed upon hearing their mantra. Shamal can see that the two girls never been asked anything and he also can see how the two girls are being abused way too much.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As Shamal </em>
        <em>keeps</em>
        <em> on treating the girls, his Sky, he knew the two of them are twins and not only that; he knew a madman had killed the twin parents, not only that, he also knows his Sky </em>
        <em>has</em>
        <em> such a beautiful mind, as she can remember every single detail from the day before her parents died.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The trust and the bond that the twin has for each other is beautiful and almost make himself blinded by it.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>For the first time, Trident Shamal is frustrated! Why! He </em>
        <em>tries</em>
        <em> his </em>
        <em>hardest</em>
        <em> to take the twins away from that abusive Hippo, Walrus and Giraffe, but can't! What the fuck is happening! Why he can't take the twins away from that house!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He informed this to the twins and seeing how sad his sky and her twin, Hydrangea is enough to make him feel like an incompetent. He hates seeing the girl look like that. Oh, how he wishes to cry or drown himself or even stabs himself in the heart, which enough to make him die in an instant.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"It's alright Shamal, it's not your fault," the twin said at the same time and try to soothe him up, which is NOT! He feels like a failure, not just he fails his Sky, Amaranth, but even Hydrangea!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The two of them </em>
        <em>are</em>
        <em> way innocent!</em>

        <em>"Shamal!" the twin run to Shamal waving a letter to him.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shamal looks at the twin with a grin on his face and scopes the twins up. Despite one of them is his sky, but he already thought the two like his own little sister. Even though he already explained what his work and about the Sky and everything. The twin never looks at him differently and never even once make a face, in fact, they understanding which sometimes make himself scare on how understanding they are and sharp for they own age.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One thing that makes </em>
        <em>him, shocked</em>
        <em> is when his own Sky never thought of him as her guardian, at first he feels like he been </em>
        <em>punched</em>
        <em> in the gut, thought his Sky might don't want him, but then beam when she told him she thought of him like an older brother that her and her twin sister wish for.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thus, here </em>
        <em>he is an older brother to the twins and quite the protective </em>
        <em>of</em>
        <em> them too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>What the two of you get?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>It's a letter from Hogwarts, the school where our mom and dad go," Hydrangea beam and give a letter to Shamal for him to read.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shamal read </em>
        <em>it, but</em>
        <em> then </em>
        <em>frowns</em>
        <em>. School for a witch and </em>
        <em>wizarding</em>
        <em>?! Is this some sick joke?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"It's true!" Amaranth exclaim, when she can </em>
        <em>sense</em>
        <em> that Shamal didn't believe them. "I found our </em>
        <em>uncle's</em>
        <em> journal! Before Aunt Petunia, kick him out, and there's a picture of him and our mom and dad too!" The twin said with excitement, which makes Shamal look at them with wide eyes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>Can I read it?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Amaranth gives the journal to Shamal, and upon opening it, he feels like he been doused </em>
        <em>with</em>
        <em> cold water. As the picture that near of the </em>
        <em>twins'</em>
        <em> parents is one of the Arcobaleno before he </em>
        <em>had been</em>
        <em> a curse, Verde!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>Ermm</em>
        <em>... Ama, Haya, what is your </em>
        <em>uncle's</em>
        <em> name?" The twin look at each other, upon hearing how shaky their brother's voice is, and not only that, they also can see </em>
        <em>the fear </em>
        <em>in </em>
        <em>his eyes, even Amaranth can feel in their bond.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"It says in here his name is the same as our </em>
        <em>father's</em>

        <em>the Verde</em>
        <em> because mom keeps calling him that, said mom is a fanatic with this Star Wars story and our uncle always make this voice of Darth Vader, so she gives him Verde name, as it almost comes close to this Darth Vader?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>
        <em>You know him" this time Amaranth said, but with quite calmed </em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>"You telling us, that our uncle is being cursed!" Hydrangea looks a little green while Amaranth looks at him with a blank face. God, please drown him!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"He can't take us because he was afraid that we don't want him, and he unable to take care of us because of the curse, but I guess he been taking care of us by his own way" Amaranth look at her twin with a blank </em>

        <em> makes Hydrangea look at her older sister with a startled but then she tries to remember </em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shamal looks over the twin with shock and anger. How dare that horsewoman does that to his little sisters! Again Shamal is out from his mind when he hears what his Sky exclaim. "Aunt Petunia never talked about Uncle Verde because he is a prodigy. I try to read formula that in his journal, those are the formula about on how to make magic and technologies work together,"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wow! That sure is out from eleven years old mind.</em>

      <p>
        <em>"No!" Shamal shamelessly cry like a little toddler, if anyone ever asked him before that one day he will cry like a toddler, he will kill them straight away. But now, here he is, crying like a toddler while hugging both his little sister!</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hearing those, make Shamal run as fast as he can. Varia, the assassin for Vongola have seen the owl for the countless time, and it is shocking to be truthful, whenever the owl came, Shamal will run as fast as he can.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shamal didn't reply, as he was holding a few vials of blood for the twins, a letter and a journal? He reread the letter back and forth and look back to the journal. Shamal tunes out everything away when he opened the journal where the twin has told him in the letter.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again he feels like he been doused </em>
        <em>with</em>
        <em> cold water</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"What about it?"</em>

      <p>

      <p>
        <em>He feels like he wants to bang his head to the wall when he looks over the results. First the Lightning and now this.</em>

      <p>
        <em>"So trash, how's the result?"</em>

        <em>"You have a twin sister" The room becomes </em>
        <em>silent</em>
        <em>, Shamal didn't even wait for Xanxus to say anything. "</em>
        <em>Their</em>
        <em> name is Hydrangea Potter and Amaranth Potter. Amaranth is the older and the journal they give is the journal of their late father, which I'm sure Amaranth pickpocket the key from Hagrid," Shamal say those in a low murmur, he can see at the corner of his eyes that the Mist Arcobaleno flinch upon hearing his little sister name. He needs to know why.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again Shamal continues "Their father and mother have a big fight one day, which cause him ran to Italy and have a drunken </em>
        <em>night, which </em>
        <em>caused... </em>
        <em>well, I guess you can tell what happens. When he knew your mother is pregnant with you, he comes clean to his wife."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"The wife which is your twin sisters mother, forgive him and that she is quite a gem because in the journal it says she accept your father fault because everyone never been clean, and not only that, she even threatens your father's to bring you home,"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This makes Xanxus snort. "Oh yeah, he sure is." But seeing both Shamal and Mammon look at him murderous is enough to make him stop and narrow his eyes. "I suggest you shut up when you know nothing. Both your father and your step-mother dies when they found where are you. They already set to get you by tomorrow, but on the Halloween night both been killed right in front of your twin sister, and let me tell you this, Amaranth still remember every fucking single detail!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Xanxus </em>
        <em>look at Shamal with narrow eyes before Shamal throw the journal to him. But to be honest, deep </em>
        <em>inside, he</em>
        <em> needs to get his twin sister and on that night, upon reading his </em>
        <em>father's</em>
        <em> journal. He can say what Shamal </em>
        <em>says</em>
        <em> is true, and again for the first time, he cries for unable to see his real father. There's a picture of his baby sisters with both of their parents, but the last one is enough to make him flinch inwardly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No wonder Shamal </em>
        <em>looks</em>
        <em> like he wants to bang his head. From the reaction, he knew Shamal might be bonded to one of his twin sister, but to know the twins also related to one of the </em>
        <em>Arcobaleno</em>
        <em>, even he wants to bang his head.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>"Tell me more about the tw..." Xanxus stop when he saw Shamal eyes turn wide. "I need a projector now!" Shamal shout, seeing how panic the doctor is enough to know something is happening to his twin sister. God hope nothing happens.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He feels like he wants to bang his head to the wall, like Shamal when he saw, 'it' dangles one of the twins up and down.</em>

        <em>First the troll, then the Cerberus, Devil snare or whatever that plant called is – it almost killed them! A giant chest, not only that the sport they played too. Lord, can't they even play like a decent player! Why Amaranth and Hydrangea need to do that dive!</em>

        <u>Amaranth &amp; Hydrangea – 15 years old</u>
      </p>
      <p>Tsuna opens his room door inviting his two new friends and his devil tutor, but halt when he saw one of the frame pictures he values the most crashes down to the floor. He ran past Lambo and Ipin and slowly lifts the frame and look over Lambo and Ipin with fire in his eyes.</p>
      <p>"Who's the one making this frame fall!" Gokudera and Yamamoto startled upon hearing the cold in Tsuna tone, even his mini tutor look at Tsuna with wonder.</p>
      <p>"Lambo! Apologize to Tsuna fast" Ipin look over Tsuna with worried, she knew how Tsuna care of that frame.</p>
      <p>"Hum, Lambo will not apologize"</p>
      <p>For the first time, Tsuna raised his voice which enough to make Lambo flinch and cower away. "You will apologize or you will receive nothing from Mama! I will make sure of it and get out of my room! Now!"</p>
      <p>Lambo and Ipin look over Tsuna with a startled but walked away for fear making Tsuna angry more. Tsuna turns away and gently place the frame back to his desk. Slowly he caresses the two girls in the picture. "I'm back home, Ama-nee, Haya-nee"</p>
      <p>Gokudera and Yamamoto look over Tsuna with worried in their face, they never thought Tsuna had an older sister. Meanwhile, the mini tutor looks over the picture with a startled and wonder why his student has a picture of his Wife/Sky and Fon Wife/Sky.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know you had a sister, Tsuna" Yamamoto look over the picture with a smile.</p>
      <p>"True, what is their name, Jyuudaime and where are they?"</p>
      <p>The two of them look at each other when Tsuna didn't even reply, before them about to ask again, Tsuna is telling them who the girls in the picture. "The one who is red hair is Potter Amaranth and the black hair is Potter Hydrangea, the two of them are twins. The two like a sister and daughter to mama and me. They used to stay here, they always been abused by their aunt and uncle, even their cousin bullied them."</p>
      <p>"Where are they, the parents?" Gokudera asked, wondering why the parents didn't notice that.</p>
      <p>"Ama-nee and Haya-nee parents died when the two of them a few months. A madman came to the house and killed Ama-nee and Haya-nee parents, leaving them to their aunt and uncle" Yamamoto and Gokudera who hear flinch meanwhile the tutor feel a bit murderous upon hearing, glad that his wife and Fon wife already killed that madmen or the two of them will end that man's life repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Tsuna didn't see the murderous look on his tutor face and sadness on his friend's face as he keeps on continue.</p>
      <p>"A few years ago, do you remember there was news about England is under attack? Well, last year, we received letters, that's saying condolence on the Ama - nee and Haya - nee." Tears stream down from Tsuna face upon remembering the day when Mama crumbles down and cry out of her tears upon receiving that news.</p>
      <p>"Since then, Mama has become like what you see. Mama can't accept it that Ama-nee and Haya-nee no longer with us,"</p>
      <p>Yamamoto and Gokudera again flinch upon knowing that. Whoever thought their friend has lost someone he truly cares. Meanwhile, the tutor is enraged upon hearing this, no he will not accept whatever he hears.</p>
      <p>He knew his wife is not yet, he knows it! She can't be dead! He has met her when she and her twin in the middle of a war by accident. She and her twin even didn't look at them like they some a child, in fact, the two of them can tell that they're being curse just by a first glance. He and Fon even help them in their war, even though not much, but still and their wife can't get out of that blastic country. No, he will not accept that she no longer walking in this plane, she promises that she will return to him! She promises!</p>
      <p>The teenager startled when they hear a tap on Tsuna window; the tutor feels relief when he saw a letter at the owl's leg. He jumps to the desk; he saw letters for him and Tsuna.</p>
      <p>"Dame-Tsuna, a letter for you,"</p>
      <p>"Hiee, a letter for me?"</p>
      <p>Gingerly Tsuna takes the letter and opens it, both Yamamoto and Gokudera look over what letter is that. When Tsuna opens it, he frowns, as the letter is only a few, and he wonders who signature is that.</p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>We on our way. Miss you Tsu and Mama</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>Love,</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>E.V &amp; E.F</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Who is that?" Yamamoto asked, which Tsuna only able to shake his head as he truly doesn't know who is that letter from.</p>
      <p>"Maybe just a prank," Gokudera muse.</p>
      <p>While the tutor took the letter and walked out of Tsuna room and open his letter.</p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>We will be on our way. I'm sorry for not able to return you're called.</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>My phone and my twins broke, some mafioso is quite an idiot attacking us.</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>But don't worry, we come out alright. Miss you so much, can't wait to see you.</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>Love,</em>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <em>Your lovely wife, V. E-S</em>
      </p>
      <p>The tutor smirk and pulled his fedora down, his lovely wife will be back and he can't wait to have her by his side again. They marriage moment might be short but is enough for him, the war in England is over, that means she will be by his side, no longer separate anymore.</p>
      <p>"Return back to me fast"</p>
