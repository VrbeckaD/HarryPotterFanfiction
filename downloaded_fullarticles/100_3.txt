    <b>Lets begin!</b>
  </em>
</p>
<p>Its a Saturday Morning at Dracula residence, Stokely Castle. 4 months ago the Dracula's were forced to flee their Castle in Transylvania after being driven out by a angry peasant mob and have found a new home in a town called Stokely, their castle was on a hill overlooking the suburban town below them. Life here in this town was good, to Vladimir Dracula at least. He finally felt <em>normal </em>in this town, he went to a <em>normal </em>school, had a <em>normal </em>friend called Robin. Well, he wasn't all normal but he was still <b>human</b>. Vladimir hated being a Vampire, much to his fathers displeasure.</p>
<p>As the sun began to rise a streak of its light came from the window and Vladimir's face. He woke up with a grunt and rolled over to face away from the light, hoping to sleep some more despite him already being awake. Head still flat on his pillow and body limp in the comfort of his bed he slowly opened his eyes, to find a wolf face inches away from his face and its eyes staring straight into his own.</p>
<p>"AHHH!" He screamed while bolting up into a sitting up position on his bed.</p>
<p>"Sorry Master Vlad." The Wolf was actually his 'pet' stuffed hell-hound on wheels that could talk.</p>
<p>"Zoltan, you got to stop doing that." He said while rubbing the sleep from his eyes and calming himself down. "What are you doing staring at me like a brain dead zombie anyway?"</p>
<p>"The Count wishes you to join him downstairs as soon as your awake."</p>
<p>"Uhhg" he groaned, throwing his head back into his pillow while stretching his tired limbs. </p>
<p>Walking down the stairs, he was preparing himself to face his father who should have been in his coffin hours ago so he could imagine he'd be quite irritated by whatever has made him wait for his precious "son and heir" to wake up.</p>
<p>He was confused when he came into the main hall of the castle, not only was his father, Count Dracula, looking very alert and for some reason excited, but his older sister Ingrid was also awake and glaring at a older women with a pointed hat at the other end of the table she was sat on suspiciously. But then she turned her glare to him, her eyes full of jealousy and hatred. The kind he hasn't seen since their father kick her out of the tower room and gave it to him.</p>
<p>His father bolted up from his throne that was watching over the table. "Ah, Vladdy!" his father walked over and threw his arm over Vlads shoulders pulling him in tightly and exclaiming to the uninterested audience. "I always knew you were special, how could you not be? My Son!" He eagerly handed Vlad a letter with his name on the front which magically unfolded itself in his hands to reveal luxuriously soft parchment with fine script written across it in black ink. </p>
<p>
  <em>"Dear Mr Vladimir Dracula</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Due to the nature of your placement, a member of staff will escort this letter and fully explain the protocols we can put in place to ensure the safety of yourself and our fellow students and staff.</em>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <em>Term begins on September 1st. We await your owl by no later than July 31st. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours sincerely,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Minerva McGonagall<br/>Deputy Headmistress"</em>
</p>
<p>Vlad re-read the letter several times, still unable to make sense of what he was reading. He said the first thing that came to his head. "This has got to be a joke, a wizard? Really?" his voice clearly showing the confusion in his head as he looked up to his father who was sporting a proud smirk.</p>
<p>"There hasn't been a Magical Vampire for over a thousand years Vladdy! I cant wait to shove this into that old bats face!" His father clearly referring to his grandmother Krone Westenra. In reply Vlad rolled his eyes and left his fathers side to sit at the table to be stared at by the odd looking women in front of him. She <em>reeked </em>of cats, most likely owning a fair few herself, but he also detected something else, something he hasn't smelt before. He could smell breather, but there was... something else. </p>
<p>Clearly seeing the confusion in his eyes the women spoke. "I am Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress as well as your future Transfiguration teacher." Vlad was about to ask but she raise her hand before he could speak. "Before you ask, yes i am a Witch. From what i was told we give off a different scent." she clearly felt uncomfortable saying it but she was too stern to show it.</p>
<p>Clearly intrigued in this new world hes found himself in, Vlad spent his time between spoonfuls of cereal asking the Professor about Hogwarts, the Wizarding world and how he was going to keep the fact he is a Vampire a secrete to the rest of the school and even staff. "Ah, yes. Until you are 16 you should pass off as a normal student and when it does come to your transformation we shall revisit that matter." On a Vampires 16th birthday, they gain all the powers and weaknesses that come with the fangs. Until then, a child of Vampiric blood has a heart-beat, pulse, can get garlic, go out in the sun and all the rest like a normal human child. </p>
<p>"But obviously you cannot tell anyone what your are. But in my research i also discovered that Magical Vampires are naturally able to do wandless magic, even at your age. This skill will need to be kept hidden as well. As it will raise questions and that is not something we would want." </p>
<p>Nodding stiffly he continued with his breakfast. Once finished the Professor stood up and bid farewell to the Count and then turned back to Vlad. "I shall see you tomorrow morning at 9 am sharp Mr Dracula. We shall be going to Diagon Alley to pick up your school supplies that your farther cannot obtain in Dârmoxa market." </p>
<p>"Dârmoxa market?" a hand landed on his shoulder, looking up he saw his father looking down on him again.</p>
<p>"Its beneath the Carpathian Mountains, buried deep in the caves there. Its where i buy all my bottles of blood and capes. It means a trip to the old country!" </p>
<p>Previously sitting lazily on a chair sulking, but on the instant hearing her father mention their trip back to Romania Ingrid shot out of her seat, clearly excited to be going home. "Finally, this country is far too <em>normal</em>." she said with clear disgust. </p>
<p>The Count chuckled "You don't really think your coming along do you?"</p>
<p>"BUT DAD?!"</p>
<p>"Enough! I will not have you ruining my time with my Son and Heir!"</p>
<p>"What do you expect me to do then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, clean, cook, sulk, i really haven't given it much thought."</p>
<p>Vlad was irritated that his father treated his sister in such a way, she was much more the Vampire then he would ever be. He hated being on the receiving end of his fathers attention where Ingrid craved it, always trying to prove herself. Rolling his eyes to the bickering relatives he turned back to the Professor.</p>
<p>"Yes, well, i'll see you tomorrow Mr Dracula. Good day."</p>
<p>And with a <em>crack!</em> she was gone. Some sort of teleportation apparently. </p>
<p>"Vladdy, go get your Cape on. We shall leave within the hour."</p>
<p>Vlad grunted, he hated wearing his vampiric attire. "But dad its day-time, you'll burn."</p>
<p>"Not where we're going, now hurry up and get ready. I'd like to be back to my coffin before midday at least."</p>
<p>Nodding Vlad headed up the stairs. To get changed, he was excited to go to Hogwarts. He always loved learning new things that <em>didn't involve the best angle to stick your fangs into someones neck. </em>And it would be a chance to finally escape his life as a Vampire and finally be able to act normal with hardly anyone knowing what he was. He like Robins friendship, but his constant obsession with Vampires really irked him sometimes. </p>
