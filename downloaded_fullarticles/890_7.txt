    <p>"Can I sit here ?"</p><p>Hermione looks up and her eyes meet grey ones, Draco's. She stares at him for a few seconds before taking a look around. </p><p>"There are plenty of other seats. Why here ?" They were literally the only people remaining in the entire school. Everyone has been sent home for Christmas. Only Hermione and Draco stayed. Hermione's parents were still in Australia, not remembering having a daughter. She has tried for months to reverse the oblivion spell, in vain. And as for Draco, his dad was in Azkaban and her mom in France. He thought about going back to the manor but decided to stay at the last minute. He really didn't want to be alone in the creepy place the manor has become. </p><p>"Can we talk ?" He asks. </p><p>She sighs. </p><p>"Fine." She finally says after considering it. She should have said no but what's the point. She wanted to know anyway. </p><p>Draco sits in front of her. She shivers when she loses herself in his eyes, waiting for him to say what he has to say. </p><p>"I just...I'm sorry I stood you up. You asked me to go to Hogsmeade with you. I thought it was a date then you acted like it wasn't. I was confused and...scared I guess because of my past and my current reputation."<br/>
"Stop, Draco. We already had this conversation. I told you I didn't care about your past. Honestly I'm tired. I have a ton of studying to do and you're wasting my time. I asked you out. You said yes and didn't show up. I waited for you all afternoon in the cold. I felt humiliated and I never want to feel this way again. Also, I don't think being scared is a good enough reason"<br/>
"well, this is the only reason I have..."<br/>
"okay, then. I accept your apology. Is that it ?" She says with a blank face. She's trying to hide the fact that she cares. She cares a lot. But it hurts too much as well.<br/>
"Yes. No. Let me make it up to you. Let me take you on a proper date."</p><p>Hermione frowned. </p><p>"I'm sorry Draco but I don't give second chances. You screwed up. It's too bad, really. But I need someone who really wants to be with me. Who shows me I'm worth taking risks. I'm worth fighting for. And you're not the one." She says it as she sees his face go paler and paler. Her heart hurts so much it seems to be breaking into millions of pieces but she cannot let it go. He made her feel like she was worthless and she was nothing else but crap. She cannot let him in again. Ever. </p><p>"I understand." he finally says. "I leave you be then". </p><p>Hermione nods, unable to speak because of the lump in her throat. When she's certain to be alone she allows herself to cry. She breathes through her sadness and dries her tears with the back of her hand. She gives herself a minute and goes back to her books.</p>
