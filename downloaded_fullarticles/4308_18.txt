    <p>It was a normal day in the town of Magnolia in the kingdom of Fiore. </p>
<p>Well, as normal as life can be, when the kingdom’s craziest guild has its guildhall in your town. The townspeople performed their daily chores, looked for bargains at the market, and kept an eye out for any magic and flying pieces of furniture from the guildhall. Another brawl had just died down moments ago, so anything could happen. Even one or two mages might come flying out the guild if they had angered their master enough.</p>
<p>So when a loud noise like the crack of a whip was heard near the building everyone scurried away to safety. Thus no one saw an old man with a long white beard appear out of thin air. He stood in the middle of the square, straightened his unusual purple robes and studied the sign over the entrance of the guildhall. After tapping his glasses, ears, and throat with a stick, he nodded and marched straight up the path towards the building. The elderly wizard didn’t get very far before two young men burst out of the gate and almost knocked him over on their flight from something or somebody inside the guild.</p>
<p>The pair apologised profusely and took up running again, when the stranger asked them, “Are you wizards of Fairy Tail?” </p>
<p>That stopped one of them in his tracks. The rosy-haired boy turned around and asked him, “What the heck are wizards? We’re mages!” just to get hit over the head by a young woman with brilliant scarlet hair. </p>
<p>“Mind your language, Natsu!” she scolded the nearly unconscious boy. </p>
<p>Then she turned to address the stranger, “You are standing in front of the guildhall of Fairy Tail and all three of us are mages of this guild.” </p>
<p>Before she could go on to introduce them any further the old man smiled brightly and interjected, “Fabulous! So much energy. Just what I was looking for. Would you mind escorting me to your guildmaster? Is it still good old Makarov?” And without waiting for a response he turned towards the building and walked right in, as if he had been there before. </p>
<p>“Makarov Dreyar, my friend, where are you hiding?”</p>
<p>The short, old man at the bar flinched in recognition of the voice. He already dreaded the coming conversation he could now no longer avoid. But still, he looked forward to seeing an old friend again. He took a final swig from his beer and then jumped up onto the counter, much to the dismay of the girls working behind it. “Albus! What brings you here? Is it time already?” </p>
<p>“No, not at all,” the vibrantly coloured stranger assured. “I am here because I have a job for your guild’s youngsters. The young lady I met outside, as well as those two gentlemen would make a great start for the group I had in mind,” he said, gesturing to the two youths who had almost mowed him down.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Great Britain’s Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry making an official request to Fairy Tail left Makarov speechless. He just stared at the old wizard with his mouth hanging open until a crash snapped him out of his shock. The noise came from a side entrance being slammed open by the one person he didn’t want to see at this moment. Elyx Dreyar, his granddaughter, came bounding into the room, elated by how much her last job had earned her. She hardly looked around while babbling about her fight and all the jewel she had earned, weaving her way through the guild towards her grandfather. Therefore, she didn’t notice the visitor, until she almost bumped into him. Upon recognising her headmaster joy followed by panic flashed across her face, before she could hide her emotions. </p>
<p>The moment the girl stood behind him, frozen in shock, Dumbledore turned around to greet another possible recruit judging by the youthful voice. But he immediately recognised the brilliant violet eyes and golden hair of his former student and ward. “Elyx! What happened to you?!” he exclaimed in concern, looking at the girl who should have been a woman already.</p>
<p>Upon his cry the guild fell silent, preparing themselves to protect their comrade’s feelings from the visitor from another world, as they realised now. To shield Elyx and Dumbledore from his noisy “brats,” Makarov ushered them into a private room where they could clear up the situation without the interference of the more boisterous members of the guild.</p>
<p>While outside the study, the guild started up a ruckus once the door was closed, you could have heard a feather drop inside. Elyx stood somewhere to the left, her head hanging low, while Dumbledore paced in the right part of the room, stopping from time to time to look at her, trying to reconcile expectation and reality. Makarov took a deep breath and led Elyx to one of the armchairs in the room, while gesturing for Dumbledore to sit down in the other. Once both were settled he seated himself on the sofa between them. </p>
<p>Before he could start his explanation of Elyx’ condition and how it came about, the girl herself spoke up, “Uncle Albus, there was an accident when grandpa finally allowed me to go on my first job without him or Laxus when I turned seventeen. I was trying to protect my friends from a demon that attacked us right after our job. I succeeded, but I used up too much energy for a spell I hadn’t mastered. I fell unconscious and when I woke up again I was told I couldn’t age anymore – my body is frozen in time. But apart from that I’m as healthy as can be. My magicks – both of them – grew more quickly than normal, and still continue to grow in spurts. It’s no one’s fault but mine, for being reckless, thinking I could use a spell straight from a book. Grandpa still beats himself up about not being able to protect me. I’m sorry we didn’t tell you right away, but I wanted to deal with it here before even thinking about there. I really didn’t want you to find out like this; I’m sorry my decision caused you pain.”<br/>After she gave this speech, sitting up straight and holding eye-contact all the time, she slumped, as if someone had cut her strings, too tired to even sit up straight, now that the elation about her job and the anxiety about this surprise meeting faded. Dumbledore had listened and watched her attentively and conjured up a cup of her favourite black tea for her. He handed her the beverage without a word and waited until she had finished drinking, like he had always done when she was upset as a child. Then he took off his glasses, cleaned them with his sleeve and, after putting them back on, looked at his ward closely. When Elyx was beginning to feel anxious again, he finally spoke up, “It was reckless indeed, but I’m also proud of you. You protected your friends and seem to have been dealing with the uncomfortable results maturely.” </p>
<p>At this, Elyx and Makarov gave a hollow laugh. At Dumbledore’s confused look, Makarov explained, “She didn’t take it so well at first. She was very childish and reckless for the first year or two. I was forced to send her to Tenroujima alone for three months to calm her down. Otherwise she might have become a threat.” </p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded his understanding.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad you figured it out, no matter how long it took. But right now I was thinking about a way to put your condition to good use. Before you joined us, I was explaining to your grandfather that I have a job for some of the guild’s youngsters. Seeing that physically you still fit into that group, I would like you to join the team as well. You would be of great help, aiding the others in navigating Earth and British culture.”</p>
<p>Then he went on to explain about Voldemort’s first demise, Harry Potter and the events of the past four years, including Voldemort’s return. “…Because of this new threat I want to tighten security around Harry and Hogwarts in general. And this is where Fairy Tail comes into the picture. I want to invite some youngsters to our school as exchange students from Japan – as their culture is closest to Fiore’s. They will participate in classes, learn our magic, but also be able to fight if anyone or anything should threaten my pupils. You could formally finish your education with us, Elyx, while doing this job. So, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“This Harry is now in fifth grade, right? That would work perfectly, because I just mastered fourth grade magic,” Elyx mused. </p>
<p>“That’s good. But keep in mind that you would also have to try to fit in regarding your behavior and appearance. Right now, I would have guessed you to be about nineteen years of age, but that won’t work, it would raise too many questions,” Dumbledore interposed, taking in Elyx’ tight-fitting black and purple adventurer’s gear and elaborate make-up.</p>
<p>“I have to appear younger?! That’s terrible!” she whined, rushing over to a mirror to make sure her appearance hadn’t changed from the thought alone, immediately putting some stray locks back into her braid.<br/>Dumbledore could just look on in confusion. He knew Elyx as a person who always dressed with care but this kind of vanity was new to him. </p>
<p>Makarov walked over to Elyx and took her hands to stop her from finding new “faults” in her appearance. He looked straight into her eyes and stated: “You are a capable young woman no matter what you look like. Now calm down and remember what you are.” </p>
<p>“A Fairy Tail mage” The usual spark returned to her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes. And what does that mean?”</p>
<p>“I can do anything for my comrades. Even dress up as a fifteen-year-old,” she admitted begrudgingly.</p>
<p>“Good. Will you take the job?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I can’t leave my comrades alone in my other world.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled.” With this, Makarov turned to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Now I have a few questions for clarification if you don’t mind.” </p>
<p>He went and took up his place on the sofa again.</p>
<p>“How many mages did you have in mind? You might want to pass off one or two of the older members as teachers?” Sending a few older mages for support and to reign in the younger ones was always a wise plan.</p>
<p>“And of course I also need to know when the job is supposed to start, how long it will last and what the payment will be?” The men launched into planning out the details, while Elyx silently drifted off to sleep in her armchair, completely drained and content to have her two guardians around again.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>Natsu and Gray followed Erza back into the guild, curious about the old man they’d nearly crashed into. The moment they saw his reaction to spotting Elyx they knew where he came from. Since they spent a lot of time with her they knew how Elyx dreaded that someone from there might find out about her accident and its consequences and they wanted to rush to the front of the guild to protect her from that grief. But Erza pulled them back, knowing this was something Elyx could and had to deal with on her own. They had grown to be a very tight-knit group after the accident, after all Natsu, Gray and Erza were the friends Elyx saved.</p>
<p>When the door closed behind their friend and her two guardians, the guild – most of them aware of the accident and the others always in for a brawl – went crazy.</p>
<p>“What do you think is going on, Lucy? Everyone’s going berserk!” a small, blue-haired girl asked an older blonde, while ducking to avoid being hit by a flying chair. </p>
<p>“Again,” the white cat in a dress who sat on the table in front of her added.</p>
<p>“I’ve got no clue. Let’s go ask Mira,” Lucy replied. She stood up to make her way to the bar but immediately regretted it, when one of her guildmates came flying at her. She sent him back where he came from with a hearty kick, before pulling the girl and the cat after her. </p>
<p>“Mirajane, what’s all this about?!” Lucy shouted to the white-haired woman behind the bar. </p>
<p>“Ask your team, they know better!” And with that Mira took the last remaining bottles of sake and hid them under the counter, before getting knocked out by a flying bottle the moment she came back up.</p>
<p>Lucy and her friend missed Mira being taken out as they were already headed towards the back of the hall, where they saw the unmistakable flash of scarlet that indicated Erza. The warrior mage stood there holding Natsu and Gray back from joining the brawl. </p>
<p>“Wendy, Lucy, are you okay?” She nodded to them in greeting, not letting go of the boys.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Erza, what’s going on? Is Elyx alright?” Wendy asked.</p>
<p>“She will be. That man is a visitor from her past it seems. But I think it’d be better if she told you herself.”</p>
<p>Soon after, the door to the study opened and out came Makarov and Dumbledore with a sleepy Elyx trailing after them. Makarov jumped onto the bar, shouting, “Brats! Listen up! My old friend Dumbledore came here to request our assistance. I know you are upset because of his reaction to Elyx, but they have resolved the situation, so focus on the job. </p>
<p>“We need about ten mages between the ages of thirteen and seventeen for this. Dumbledore already directly requested Erza, Natsu and Gray, and I agree with his choice. Elyx also agreed to be part of the team. That leaves six more who may volunteer. But be warned: You will have to live in a different world for a long time. You’ll need to learn their magic and might possibly face a great threat.” With that he sat down and waited for their reactions.</p>
<p>Expectedly Erza, Gray and Natsu were shocked to hear they were being sent to another world. But as it was the world Elyx had lived in, they were also curious. Lucy and Wendy, not wanting to be left behind, volunteered immediately. </p>
<p>“Juvia volunteers! Juvia wants to be with Gray-sama, even in another world,” the obsessive water-mage chipped in immediately.</p>
<p>“Another world?” a girl Lucy’s age with light-blue hair mused. “Maybe I can learn some new magic there. And new languages! I volunteer!”</p>
<p>“If Levy goes, we go too.” Two guys popped up behind the girl and volunteered. </p>
<p>“Jet, Droy, you are too old. You have to stay,” Makarov stopped them.</p>
<p>“Can I go too? I’d like to see Elyx’ world,” a young white-haired girl asked timidly. </p>
<p>Immediately Mirajane burst out from behind the counter: “You can’t go to another world again, Lisanna! I couldn’t bear to do without you again. It would bring up too many memories.” </p>
<p>Her brother Elfman showed up right behind Mirajane, “But now she’s with Fairy Tail. She’s a man now. She’ll come back.” And he went over to hug his little sister before turning to Elyx, “I know you’ll take good care of her.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll bring her back.”</p>
<p>“That’s a man!” Elfman boomed, letting his huge hand fall on Elyx’ shoulder with a force that would have knocked anyone but a true Fairy Tail mage over.</p>
<p>“… eight … nine. I need one more volunteer!” Makarov shouted, banging the bar with an enlarged fist.</p>
<p>In a corner, a tall, black-haired mage with piercings grunted. </p>
<p>“Thanks, Gajeel, you’re in.”</p>
<p>Gajeel looked disbelievingly at his master: “But I… Why?”</p>
<p>But he already knew that all arguing would be useless, when the master jumped off the bar again and led them into the back room, where he spent the next hour with explaining everything, aided from time to time by Dumbledore or Elyx.</p>
