  <b>Okay, so I started writing this back in 2012. Yeesh. But I finally decided to finish this, and I’ve got nothing but time on my hands until my job starts in the fall, so hope you enjoy this. I’m going mainly off of what we know from canon, and bringing in a couple ideas from other fics I’ve read, which I will include as references. It’s been really fun to rediscover my love for the series and especially my love for Ginevra Molly Weasley! I edited every chapter I've written thus far so if you've read this before be sure to give it another go!</b>
</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>I figured I would give this whole journal thing a go, and made very, very, <em> very </em> sure that this one didn’t talk back, as I have had enough bad experiences with that. Anyway, Mum suggested that I start writing things down to get my feelings out because she was tired of me moping about. I guess I’ll start with when Harry broke up with me.</p><p>"Ginny, listen..."</p><p>I knew what was coming, what Harry was about to say, but that didn’t mean I wanted to hear it.</p><p>Staring into those beautiful green eyes of the man I knew I could love with every fiber of my being if I allowed myself, I braced myself for the break-up. But I knew that he was saying this because he felt it was the right thing to do. Logically, I understood. My heart, not so much.</p><p>"We can't be involved anymore. We can't be together. We have to stop seeing each other."</p><p>Tears burned the corners of my eyes but I would not let them fall. It was hurting Harry enough to say these words and I knew if I started crying, something I rarely did, he would regret this even more.</p><p>The past few weeks, we had spent nearly every waking moment together and I had noticed that there was something not being said. A sense of urgency, I guess, was hanging over every action Harry made. It felt like every kiss was our last, every hug was a treasure to be stored up and hidden away for the darkest moments to come.</p><p>So, I listened to what Harry told me, biting the inside of my cheek until it drew blood. I knew that this was the end of our relationship-at least, for the foreseeable future, or until Voldemort defeated, or until one of us got killed, whatever happens first. He told me that Voldemort used people close to his enemies to get through to them, and he couldn't risk anything happening to me. I didn't even cry when I told him that I had seen this coming. Harry was so pure-hearted that he cared more for my well-being, that he didn’t want me to come to harm just for loving him (never mind that my being a Weasley meant I was quite likely to come to harm somehow).</p><p>And even after the funeral, when we got on the Hogwarts train to go home, I managed to keep the tears at bay. There was still Fleur and Bill's wedding.</p><p>Harry would surely come to that, wouldn't he?</p><p>He had to...or I’d hex him into oblivion before Voldemort could get him.</p><p>I also knew Ron was going to follow Harry no matter what, even to the point of death. Ron might be an arsehole sometimes, and terribly, terribly slow to see love staring him in the face (exhibit A: Hermione), but he was loyal and devoted. In that sense Ron was, and is, still my favorite brother. A true Gryffindor, I suppose you could say. Out of all my brothers, he and I have always gotten along the best.</p><p>When we arrived home, I went straight to my room and finally let loose of the tears that had been stored up for weeks. Great, heaving, choking sobs. No one came upstairs, even though I knew the whole house could hear me.</p><p>I'd broken up before, with Michael, with Dean, with other guys, and I'd cried those times, the most with Dean, but I had never felt like this. A horrible loneliness surrounded me. Even when I hadn't been in Harry's presence, I still felt safe, protected, loved...because I had someone. That someone loved me and I loved him too...and that is where I find myself now.</p><p>It’s been weeks, and I still spend hours staring at the ceiling replaying those golden moments in my mind over and over. I miss Harry so much it feels like a hole in my heart. Mum manages to keep me busy with wedding preparations, but I know she sees my broken heart.</p><p>I also know Harry won’t be at school in the fall. He never explicitly told me he was quitting school, but I figure you can’t really fight Voldemort and be a full-time student. The war's coming soon, and Harry won't be there at Hogwarts with me, and that's what scares me the most. I used to be so excited for sixth year, because that’s when you get to learn to Apparate, and I guess I’m looking forward to that. But I sure wish Harry were there (without the whole Voldemort thing, of course).</p><p>Ginny </p><p>
