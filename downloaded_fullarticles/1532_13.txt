  <em>Dear Mum and Dad,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I am in Ravenclaw!!!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>To be honest, it came as a huge surprise. I expected Gryffindor, but the Hat got its verdict almost immediately and put me into the House of Rowena Ravenclaw. I quite like it here. The Ravenclaw Tower is bright and warm, and the blue and bronze colours look really good on me. Wait, that was too vain. Almost Slytherin. Dad, I know you hoped I would be sorted into your old House, like Callie, but it just doesn't suit me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Anyway... After the Sorting, when I sat down with my new classmates, I met a new girl. Her name is Helen Davies and she is a half-blood. She is a very interesting and smart girl, but she reminds me a bit of Aunt Luna. She was talking about weird creatures that I have never heard about, nor have I ever seen. I only nodded politely at her naration, but I think she is a little crazy. What do you think? Should I believe her?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I know I shouldn't write this here, but she is...Well, she is pretty. She has long blond-red hair and beautiful green eyes. Have you ever seen green eyes? Except from Uncle Harry's, of course. And James's. And Al's.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The food after the Sorting was delicious, and I found out they serve one of mum's specialities, the blueberry-almond pie. They don't make it as nice as Mum does, but it was okay.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Prefects are knocking our doors now and the lights are closing. It's time to go to our dorms and sleep.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I will write again as soon as possible, but don't worry too much for me. I am a big boy now.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>All my love,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Oberon</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>P.S. Callie was laughing when she saw my face after the Sorting. She had guessed I wanted Gryffindor and she teased me about it. Ruffling my hair in front of Helen!!! Please, Mum,tell her not to embarrass me in front of <strike>the girl I like </strike> my fellow Housemate!!! </em>
