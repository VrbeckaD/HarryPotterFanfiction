    <p>
  <span>I will be waiting</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For when you wake up</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And take my hand</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And prove to me—and yourself</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That you are more than what I saw,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What I thought I knew to be you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Your sacrifice of your life and your unbelief</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I permit it</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I will be waiting</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For when you wake up</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And realize that what you did</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wasn't you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And for when you understand</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That although we're far from okay</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We will weather the storm</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>'Cause I'm with you till the end of the line</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I will be waiting</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For when you wake up</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And rise above</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The hatred and destruction you were taught.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And for when you see</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That though it's a long path to forgiveness</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>You have me, and our friends, and most of all, your own strength</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>All is well</span>
  </em>
