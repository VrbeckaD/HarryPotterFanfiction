    <p>Scorpius Malfoy — annoying, spoiled and utterly perfect. The worst thing is, I didn’t realise this until he was already irrevocably mad at me. Ok, no, the worst thing is that I can't stop thinking about him. No, the worst thing is that he doesn't even speak to me any more. His arse is so unforgivably nice. It's a really, really nice arse. At least I can stare at that while he walks away from me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I'm being completely honest, the whole thing was my fault. But you have to understand, when we were kids, he was so different. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, that's not... exactly true. But he was so... Annoying. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets start from the beginning, right? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I started at Hogwarts I was nervous as hell. Merlin’s balls, I was such a little coward. I knew I wasn’t going to be a Gryffindor and it felt like the end of the world. My dad, you probably know him, tried to tell me that it was fine. But I listened to James, and Merlin knows nothing good ever came from that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there I was, sweating and nauseous, trying to get my brothers taunts out of my head, and suddenly someone was yanking on my sleeve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Excuse me! Are you Albus Potter? My father went to school with your father!” My first instinct was of course to scoff at him. Rude? You try living with this kind of thing for the entirety of your life then, see how you like it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well the least you could do is shake my hand, we are going to be stuck together in this castle for seven years, you know!” He scowled right back at me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I glared at him but stuck out my hand anyway, didn’t want to argue with him I guess, I kept thinking about the sorting hat and subsequently, my impending doom. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you, I'm Scorpius Malfoy!” He smiled at me as soon as I relented to shake his hand, and that's so typically him. Happy once he gets his way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Albus Potter.” I answered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I knew it! You look just like him you know.” He smiled in a self-satisfied kind of way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So everyone tells me.” I muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He kept on chatting like an overly excited crup and I can't for the life of me remember what he talked about. I wasn't listening, staring at the small seat like it was my own personal boggart. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter, Albus.” Neville, my godfather, tried to look encouraging as I walked towards the hat that would decide my entire future (at least, that's what it felt like at the time), I heard whispers erupt and my name sparked a lot of excited murmur from the Gryffindor table. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The hat descended on my head and didn't even have time to properly land before it bellowed: “SLYTHERIN” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So much for bargaining with the old rag. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I still remember the horrified silence that descended over the shocked student body. It lasted far too long before someone felt sorry for me and started to clap slowly as if asking for permission before others joined in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I felt like crying. It wasn’t the most dignified moment of my life, all right? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The thing was, Scorpius also sorted Slytherin and was the only person who dared to speak to me that first night. I guess I didn’t really appreciate the gesture as much as I should have, I just wanted to go home and Scorpius well-meaning but insistent chattering was driving me mad. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I could have handled the situation better. I hate to admit it, but towards the end of the night I may have told him to shut up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His disappointed look made me feel like an arse, but before I could apologise, he ran to his dorm and I didn't see him again until next morning. And by that time, it felt like it was too late to bring it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, yes all right. It wasn't my most gallant moment.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My first week wasn't lonely per se, because of my abundance of relatives that 'took care of me' (more like got me in trouble), but I didn't really get to know anyone in Slytherin. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wasn't the only Potter/Weasley in Slytherin though, but my cousin Fred was that age when he didn't really want to affiliate with any of the kids (his words, not mine).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That all changed when Penelope Parkinson decided that the girls in Slytherin wasn't really her cup of tea. The thing with Penny is that she gets you to think that you have a choice in the matter, but you soon realise that she only orchestrates the illusion of choice, and if she wants something, she gets it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter.” Penny sat down beside me in the library one day in the second week of my first year at Hogwarts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes?” I answered, a bit startled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can I sit down? I need some help with the transfiguration homework.” She affected a bored drawl. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I guess?” I was still a bit socially slow-witted back then.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can you show me where to find that spell that she wanted us to write about? I wasn't really paying attention.” She sat down and took out her books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sure?” I answered, and that was the epic story of how I managed to acquire my first real friend, and I wasn't even all that involved in the process. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But once you get stuck with Penny, you can't shake her off. Not that I would want to, mind you. Well, to be perfectly honest, the thought has crossed my mind. But only once... or maybe twice. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My second friend was also Penny's choice. She investigated the possibility of us becoming a trio by spying on Gabriel Hill for one week before telling me that she decided on 'expanding our friendship' by inviting him to one of our study-sessions. Apparently, the reason why she chose Gabe was because of his unmistakable talent for charming teachers, a skill which she wanted to learn and that I apparently 'lacked any aptitude for'. For some reason she never felt the need to sugar-coat her words with me.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gabe actually lived in my room, so I guess us knowing each other was inevitable, or maybe that's what Penny wants me to think. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gabe is very likeable, a social chameleon, I guess. He managed to charm even me, and I'm not really a friendly sort of person. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scorpius talked to everyone, but no one talked to Scorpius. Maybe I should have realised that he was lonely, but I was just a kid, and a socially inapt one at that. He talked so much, and he had an act for answering his own questions. Kind of dramatic as well. Everything he told you about was always the 'best ever' or 'worst sausages in his life' or 'it rained so much you couldn’t even see your feet'. His exaggerations made me disregard everything he said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when he cornered me, Penny and Gabe when we were trying to sneak out to the kitchens after curfew, it didn’t exactly enamour us towards him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you don't take me with you, I'm going to tell Professor Ellis!” He whispered, flushed pink, still in his pyjamas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fine then, but keep your ever-yapping mouth shut Scorpius!” Penny snarled, before she grabbed hold of his arm and dragged him out of the common room. The whole situation made me so annoyed, and his apparent glee caused by the fact that he got to tag along made me even angrier. Yes, I know I was a bit unfair. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The whole thing was a catastrophe, we were caught because Scorpius stumbled into an armour on the way back. We all got very mad at each other, and I don't really want to repeat what I said to Scorpius that night (to avoid sounding like an even bigger twat then I already do), but it did include words that Fred taught me and that my mother would strongly disapprove of. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He cried.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scorpius didn't really speak to me after that, and at first I was glad. Penny and he made up, they've known each other their whole life, and nobody can stay mad at Gabe. But me and him, we never got over it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took me awhile before I started to miss him and his crazy stories, not that we were friends, but he was sweet in a way. Happy. Exuberant. Funny. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the regret started to emerge he was already spending most of his time in Ravenclaw tower. And I told myself I didn’t care. Which was mostly true, at the time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time I really felt sorry for Scorpius Malfoy was in second year. All of us was walking from Herbology when he got struck by a snowball. At first, I laughed with all the others before I realised that he was the only one getting hit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was struck by another five snowballs before I even thought about doing anything. I ran up to him to get them to stop, but before I could reach him Eric Goyle moved to stand in front of him, when Scorpius was struck by a particularity hard one, and fell to the ground. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sod off!” Eric screamed towards the attacking kids, Gryffindors mostly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Screw you, you stinking pile of death eater scum!” Someone answered. I remember being totally shocked, never really having thought of Scorpius or Eric as anything other than slightly annoying (in Scorpius case), or slightly intimidating (because of Eric's sheer size, even at tender the age of twelve). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Go home!” Another one shouted, and proceeded to throw snowballs at Eric as well. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Stop it!” I shouted, my voice breaking due to stress (yes, I know, not very intimidating at all), flailing my arms in a very awkward sort of way, like the total moron that I am. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This doesn't concern you, Potter!” One of the bigger kids shouted, but the snowballs had stopped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don't care, it isn't right!” I screamed back, like a complete and utter dork. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eric was helping Scorpius up, and Penny and Gabe was coming over. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You're a dork Potter!” Someone replied unnecessarily. I felt my face heat up, making the whole situation worse. But fortunately, they were turning away, which had less to do with me and more to do with the fact that Scorpius was surrounded by his classmates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don't need your help Potter!” Scorpius sneered, equally red and very wet. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was stunned by his aggressiveness, but Slytherins are notoriously sensitive about humiliation, so I should have predicted it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fine!” I said, a bit unnecessarily harsh, as Penny's disapproving stare was letting me know. Penny went up to him and whispered something that sounded like “Are you okay?”, an enquiry to which she received a short nod before Scorpius turned and walked decisively towards the castle. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh Albus! My hero!” Gabe simpered teasingly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shut up.” I grumbled in response, totally mortified.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The thing was, that incident made me see Scorpius like less of a nuisance and more of a person. But due to my previous failure at trying to do the right thing, I was reluctant to engage in any sort of interaction with him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The whole situation was made worse by him befriending my cousin Rose, but at least he didn't look so lonely any more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rose and Scorpius was actually very alike. Both were studious to an extreme, and kind of high strung. They were also both having a hard time fitting in, something I didn't recognise then, but can see clearly now that I left my idiot years behind me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their friendship made me kind of jealous as well, never really having been close to Rose myself. Another thing I didn't realise until later. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Albie!” Rose ran past the potions classroom towards me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don't call me that!” I said, embarrassed by the nickname given to me by the family. I always hoped it would stay locked safely behind the doors of the mad house that constituted the Potter/Weasley relations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh no, I'm so sorry for cramping your style.” Rose said in a deadpan voice, rolling her eyes at me. I then realised that Scorpius was behind her, moving towards us in a much more subdued pace. He kept his eyes on the floor, avoiding me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you want?” Scorpius obvious aversion towards me made me somewhat crankier than strictly necessary towards my cousin. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aren't you a ray of sunshine today? Stop being such a little bitch.” She smacked my arm, harder than you think would be possible for someone of such a small size. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ouch! Stop abusing me and just tell me what you want!” Scorpius still hadn't looked up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fine then, Mr Grouch-a-lot. The thing is, I'm going to Scorpius house for Christmas and I need you to keep Hugo from blowing anything up at the Burrow.” She said in her bossy-voice, which was the voice she normally used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What?!” I may have said in a way too dramatic kind of way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, you're the only one, except for me that is, that can see through his devious plans.” She eyed me shrewdly, “in my case, I put it down to intelligence, but in your case I really don't know how you do it.” She turned to Scorpius, “Maybe some kind of Slytherin secret manipulation detector?” He shook his head with a small smile.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Anyway, can I count on you to keep him alive?” She turned back to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What's in it for me?” I said, after a beat too long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My Viktor Krum autographed poster is looking for a new home.” She eyed her nails in an obvious way to make her look more casual, even though she knew exactly what kind of leverage she was wielding. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What?! James is going to have kneazels!” The possibilities with that kind of artefact in my hands was endless. I could get a whole summer worth of not doing dishes if I promised it to him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Take it or leave it.” She smirked in a way that told me just how irresistible the transaction was. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Deal.” I said, putting my hand out to shake. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If he injures himself or someone else, gnomes not included, I will have your head.” She shakes it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she and Scorpius walks away, I'm overcome with some stupid urge to get him to look at me. I couldn't bare the thought that he was going to walk away, spend Christmas with Rose, and not even look at me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That feeling made me shout, “Merry Christmas Scorpius!” to my own complete mortification. Rose looked at me like I was an idiot, but Scorpius looked as well, and his blush made my stomach twist and flutter in a weirdly uncomfortable way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another thing I didn’t recognize until much later.</p>
