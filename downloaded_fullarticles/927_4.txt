    <p align="center">Prologue</p><p align="center">700 years ago there was a competition between three magic schools called ‘The Triwizard Tournament’. Since then the tournament took place every five years. The rules stated that only three champions from each of the schools can compete in this death-defying competition. Only one school can come out on top and whichever champion wins; comes fame, money, and glory. At least that is the story that you have been told, there is one part of the story that was forbidden.</p><p align="center">Every champion has a guide. These guides are called “The Trusted Sacraments”. They have been kept away until needed again, the only time they were allowed out to the magical world is during the Triwizard Tournament. They do not age until their 1500 birthday; by then the Sacraments are given a choice to return to their homeworld or stay in the wizarding world. Time moves much differently in the Sacraments universe than the magical universe. As is a tradition at the end of the tournament the Sacraments and the Warriors bestow a gift than one another.</p><p align="center">Once the Sacraments are with the Warriors; five rules were applied.</p><p align="center">
  <em><strong>Rule 1: The Warrior and the Sacrament can not harm one another.</strong> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em><strong>Rule 2: If the Warrior abuses the gift the Sacrament has bestowed them consequences take immediate action.</strong> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Rule 3: The Sacraments can not bring the dead back to life. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Rule 4: No romantic relations made between the Sacraments and the Warriors. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Rule 5: The Sacraments CAN NOT CHANGE the Warrior's DESTINY. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">These rules made the Sacraments life's a little more durable, for they had there own set of rules from their rulers, The Paramount's. The Paramount's had strict rules; if any sort of bad deed was done; then the punishment was necessary. The Sacraments did a deed that the Paramounts did not approve of. As punishment, they were sentenced to be trapped in a wizard chest to be released for the games which were discontinued for 202 years until the year 1994.</p>
