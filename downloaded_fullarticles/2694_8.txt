    <p>“Hurry up James, don’t want to miss the train do we?” Euphemia Potter called to James, who was busy being a nervous wreck with his father.<br/>“But dad, what if I don’t make any friends? I don’t want to leave you guys!” he grumbled. His father, Fleamont Potter, simply smiled.<br/>“Son, if there’s one thing I know, it’s that at Hogwarts, no one is lonely. Now remember, don’t forget to owl us. And hurry up before your mother explodes.”<br/>James nodded, taking several deeps breaths to calm his nerves, and began pushing his trolley. A mantra of ‘I can do this’ echoed in his head as he joined his mother in front of the pillar leading to platform 9 3/4.<br/>“Are you ready honey?” she asked sweetly. James nodded. Staring intently at the bricks, he began a sprint that would change his life.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, sorry, do you mind if I join you?” James asked sheepishly. The boy inside the compartment lifted his head from a book and smiled politely at him.<br/>“Nope,” he shrugged. “I’m Remus by the way.”<br/>“I’m James,” he stated as he settled down opposite Remus.<br/>Remus went back to his book, leaving James with nothing to do. Great, now he looked like a loser in front of his first potential friend.<br/>James shifted awkwardly, not knowing what to do. He didn’t want to disturb Remus, but at the same time, he felt compelled to ask questions.<br/>“So... uh... are you a first year?” James finally asked. Remus looked up and nodded.<br/>“You too?” he asked. James nodded back. Remus gave him another polite smile and continued reading. James sighed internally.<br/>“What... what house do you want to get into?” James asked. He really hoped he wasn’t being a bother.<br/>“My parents were both from Gryffindor, so I guess that’s what I want too,” he shrugged. “What about you?”<br/>“It’s the same with me actually. Maybe we’ll be roommates,” James smiled excitedly. His smile was contagious, making Remus’s guarded expression also mildly excited.<br/>There was a knock on their compartment door, and a small boy with curly dirt blond hair stood there. “Hi,” he mumbled timidly. “I ju- just wanted to ask if... to asks if I could join you guys...”<br/>James immediately felt bad for him and nodded violently. “Yes, yes of course,” he said quickly.<br/>“What’s your name?” Remus asked. The boy looked at him wide eyed.<br/>“It’s Peter. I’m Peter Pettigrew,” the boy, Peter, said as he sat down.<br/>“Hi Peter, I’m Remus and that’s James. We’re both first years. What about you?”<br/>“Yeah, yeah, I’m a first year too,” Peter nodded. Remus and James both gave him their most comforting smiles.<br/>After a while he seemed to have calmed down. Remus, James and Peter settled into a comfortable silence which the occasional comment. And then they finally arrived at Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>“Gryffindor!” the sorting hat screamed from above James’s head. James sighed, relieved at the verdict. The hat was lifted from his head and he received a warm cheer as he walked to the red décor table.<br/>Soon, Remus and Peter joined him. He was happy. He had already made friends.</p><p>“Black, Sirius!” Professor McGonagall called. A small boy with black curls sauntered to the stool. The hat was placed on his head. At the green table, James noticed the haughty smirks of what looked like a clan. Family, he thought. Family ready to receive a new member.<br/>Until they didn’t.<br/>“Gryffindor!” the hat called out after an unusually long pause. The surprise in the hall was palpable. Whispers began to cut through the shocked silence, words like ‘a Black’ and ‘Slytherin’ being the most audible. The boy slowly walked towards the table, everyone turning to look at him. Remus waved to him, offering a friendly smile. The boy saw refuge in it, and then joined the other three for their first meal at Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe we’re actually roommates!” James exclaimed as they entered their shared dorm room.<br/>“The corner bed is mine!” Sirius proclaimed immediately.<br/>“The one by the window is mine!” Remus announced. They both proceed to pull their trunks to their respective beds.<br/>“Hey guys,” a different voice suddenly sounded from one of the beds. A boy smiled at them all. “I’m Simon. Nice to meet you.”<br/>A chorus of ‘hey Simon’ filled the room.<br/>“Guys, I’m going to the common room, want to come with? I mean, if we’re going to live together, we better know each other!” James laughed.<br/>And then, Peter, Remus, Sirius and James spent the rest of the night (and early morning) talking by the fire. It was that night that Simon figured that these boys were trouble. And he’d rather just be a spectator.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t till five months of being roommates (and friends) with Remus that they found out. And he hadn’t even told them. They had noticed his behavior changing at a particular time. He’d get cranky, snap at people. Over the past month, they assumed he was just missing home. Until one night Sirius, James and Peter decided to follow him sneaking out of the dorms.<br/>The three of them were well tucked under James’s invisibility cloak, and made it as far as the castle grounds. Until they saw Remus disappear into the ground below the Whomping Willow. They almost turned around to head back until they heard the shrieks and howls that gave the Shrieking Shack it’s name.<br/>“Remus...” Sirius whispered.<br/>The next morning they asked him about it. He said nothing, but the bruises forming all over him was evidence enough that something had happened.<br/>“Trust us... please...” Sirius begged.<br/>Tears welled in Remus’s eyes, and he told them everything.<br/>After that day, Remus always had a backup and valid excuse for why he wasn’t in class the day after a full moon. “My very own bodyguards,” he joked.</p><p>The year ended. Everyone was happy to go home to their families. That is until James noticed Sirius’s faraway gaze out of the train window.<br/>“Everything ok Sirius?” James asked. Sirius simply nodded.<br/>“I just... I had fun this year guys. More fun than I’d thought I would have. Thank you,” he smiled. Everyone smiled back, plunging into memories of the previous year. Their various pranks and jokes. James reminisced their most infamous prank:  they had let loose a herd of tiny hairless mice into Mr. Filch’s office. They were hexed so only Mr. Filch and the marauders could see them, making the victim in question look quite mad. It was fun.<br/>And yet, James couldn’t shrug off the feeling that something was not quite right with his best friend. But he decided to drop the matter. Sirius would tell them when (if) he was ready. One thing he knew about his best friend was that he hated being told what to do.</p>
