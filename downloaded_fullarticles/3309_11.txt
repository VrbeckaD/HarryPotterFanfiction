  <span>“Harry, you’ve drifted off again.” Her spectacles slide half an inch down her nose. “It’s him, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Harry attempts aloofness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That Malfoy chap who supposedly doesn’t affect you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Blimey, she’s good.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Electra Davies, renowned magical therapist, makes those two hundred Galleons a session painfully worth it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He doesn’t— We just… </span>
  <em>
    <span>meet,</span>
  </em>
  <span> occasionally. We’ve done so ever since Hogwarts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Electra doesn’t challenge him. Instead, she asks:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is the content of your… </span>
  <em>
    <span>meetings?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blushes. A bluebird flies past the window. He focuses on it instead of her keen gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We… fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.” She steeples her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s overcome with a petty urge to shock her out of her calm professionalism. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, we </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> he repeats, vulgarly. “We barely talk, I want him so much. I slide my cock in him and I feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>alive.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Back at Hogwarts we used to fight, now we fuck. Happy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hogwarts.” Gently. “The place where you were happiest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stills.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that say about your feelings for him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry leans back in the armchair, stunned. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Draco. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The unlikely key to his happiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His voice is small. “Feelings?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Electra smiles. “I’m afraid so.”</span>
