    <p>When Harry opens his eyes, he finds himself bound by ropes.  They’re tight enough that he has no way to escape, and even when he closes his eyes again to concentrate, he can’t sense his wand at all.</p><p>“Finally ready to join the world of the living, Harry?”</p><p>Harry freezes at the name, even though he hadn’t been moving in the first place.  It’s wheezy, and there’s an undertone of cruelty in it, and there’s really no one else it could be.</p><p>He keeps his eyes closed in defeat, knowing that it was his own fault that he was here.</p><p>Unbidden, the image of Diary comes to his mind, of his desperate look and plea and how it had gotten him here.  Bound by ropes in the company of <em>Voldemort</em>.</p><p>He really hadn’t expected the horcruxes to betray him.  They had seemed so eager to protect him, so willing to <em>die</em> for him that he had believed them.</p><p>And now he was paying for it.</p><p>His <em>friends</em> were paying for it.  The world was.</p><p>“Nothing to say?”  The voice is closer this time, and it’s the only warning he gets before rough, chapped lips are descending on his.</p><p>Harry stiffens in horror, and fear keeps him frozen.  After a second more, the lips retreat and Harry finally gets the courage to open his eyes.</p><p>Voldemort is looking down at him, and he’s even more ghastly up close.  His skin has scales hidden beneath them, making him look not human.  His lips are bared open in an imitation of a smile and it brings shivers down his spine.</p><p>“Fuck you,” he spits, and Voldemort <em>laughs</em>, the sound chilling.</p><p>“You would like to, wouldn’t you?  After all, with what my horcruxes have told me, you’re quite the whore.”</p><p>His heart aches at the reminder of his stupidity, and he turns his face, unwilling to keep looking at Voldemort.</p><p>Unfortunately, he’s in the hands of his worst enemy, so he isn’t too surprised when Voldemort uses magic to force Harry to look back up at him.  He glares, but he knows there’s no heat in it when Voldemort leans closer to him.</p><p>“Taking them all, even two of them at once…using your mouth and your arse?  I would ask who taught you, but I shudder to think of it being Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Don’t you dare say his name!” erupts out of Harry before he can even attempt to keep quiet and when Voldemort’s smile grows, Harry wonders if that was what he was waiting for all this time.</p><p>“Ah, there’s that fiery temper,” says Voldemort, and Harry wants to tug away but Voldemort’s magic is cruel and unyielding as he brings a thumb up to swipe at Harry’s lower lip. </p><p>Instantly, all the fight leaves him as he stares up in horror at Voldemort.</p><p>“And there’s the fear that you emit so beautifully,” says Voldemort.  “Pity I won’t be using it until later.”</p><p>“You bastard,” he says with all the hatred he can muster, and Voldemort’s eyes flash red.</p><p>Before he can even start to suspect something, he’s turned over by Voldemort’s magic, his arse in the air and the ropes still tight around him.  He’s completely naked, the air cold and unforgiving.</p><p>“You need the vulgarity fucked out of you,” says Voldemort, and he sounds <em>gleeful</em>.  “Thankfully, my generals will take care of that.”</p><p>There’s a gag on his mouth before he can respond, and the last thing he hears is Voldemort’s retreating footsteps.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>He wakes to someone playing with his hair.</p><p>He’s naked, but there’s a cloak around him now and the gag is gone. When he turns his head, there’s a teenaged Tom Riddle looking at him morosely.</p><p>They’re around the same age.  He’s blonde with green eyes, but there’s no mistaking his features.  It’s hidden better than before, with only a few features to link him to Voldemort, but it’s there if he really looks.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says, quietly, “I came as fast as I could.”</p><p>“You betrayed me,” Harry says, even though he’s bound and naked and completely vulnerable, he’s still so unbelievably angry.  “After I trusted you – after I <em>let</em> you have your way with me, I…I can’t believe you.”</p><p>“I know you’re mad,” the horcrux says, and for an instant, he looks so much like Diary that Harry’s instantly sure that it’s him. </p><p>That only incites him further because it’s Diary’s betrayal in the end that hurt the most.  He had made him feel safe in a way no one had ever before, and now that he’s here, it makes him want to lash out.</p><p>But he can’t, because despite how sorry Diary looks, Harry’s tied up and naked as a present to –</p><p>“You’re his <em>general</em>?” he spits out and Diary flinches in his anger.  “What does that even mean?”</p><p>“Well,” says Diary, hesitantly, “First off, I go by Denik now.  It’s diary in Czech.”</p><p>Harry levels an unimpressed look at him and Denik looks away, looking sheepish.  “The others changed too. We all thought Voldemort was going to kill us when we first came to him, but we were powerful thanks to your magic.  So he made us all his generals.”</p><p>“And you accepted?” he asks, in disbelief, and Denik fixes him with a frown.</p><p>“Harry, you were going to kill us.  This was the only option.”</p><p>Harry can’t think of anything to say so he keeps quiet.  He hadn’t been thinking straight at the moment, so overwhelmed with the knowledge that he was a horcrux himself that he hadn’t even thought about the other horcruxes’ feelings. </p><p>Eventually, Denik continues.  “And you were never going to win, Harry.  Even if you killed <em>us</em>, you would have to die to kill him.  We were willing to die because honestly, I don’t even really know if I knew what it meant to be alive before I met you… but I wasn’t willing to let <em>you</em> die.”</p><p>His heart’s in his throat; he can’t keep looking at Denik’s honest face without breaking himself.</p><p>He hadn’t had any time to explore how he felt about being a horcrux.  After finding out, he had given himself to the horcruxes and had stopped thinking as soon as Denik had had his way with him.  He could only remember the feeling of being speared open; he had purposefully tried not to think about the fact that he was going to sacrifice himself to Voldemort after everything.</p><p> “I love you,” Denik’s words break through his stupor and Harry looks up at him in shock.</p><p>“You don’t even know what love is,” he protests, but Denik shakes his head.</p><p>“I have my memories,” he says, “and I know I love you more than anything else in the world, Harry.  I think about you every moment of the day.  When I wake up, my first thought is of you, and when I die, I want my last to be of you.”</p><p>“You were definitely put into a diary,” he says, weakly, and Denik scowls at him.</p><p>“I may be a horcrux, but so are <em>you</em>.  I know what love is.”</p><p>He’s about to protest, but he lets the words die in his throat as he looks up at Denik.  He looks so earnest, so regretful that it almost makes Harry want to believe him.  But he had tricked him once before, when he told him that he would go quietly and –</p><p>But what if Denik’s the truth?  What if he had only betrayed Harry because he wanted to keep him alive?</p><p>The horcruxes had only ever wanted to protect him…</p><p>“If you love me,” he says, “then why aren’t you releasing me?”</p><p>“I can’t.  He’s stronger than all of us.”</p><p>He doesn’t know if he can trust Denik.  But the only other option is to stay here forever on his knees, and it’s comfortable in a way only an expensive bed can be, but he’s still <em>naked</em> and he just wants to go back to sleep forever.</p><p>“Then if you do what he says, can you help?”</p><p>There’s a long pause.  “I can go talk to him,” Denik offers, but he sounds hesitant.</p><p>Harry’s still mad.  He still can’t trust Denik, can’t trust any of the horcruxes even if Denik doesn’t seem to be lying.  But if he sends Denik to fight on his behalf and Voldemort gets mad then Denik’s blood will be on his hands.  And then he’ll be all alone.</p><p>“Just do it,” he says, quietly, and he knows Denik can still sense his emotions because of the bond they share, so it doesn’t surprise him when Denik lets loose a shuddering breath.</p><p>“Really?” Denik asks quietly, and when Harry nods, Denik moves forward to kiss him chastely on the cheek.  “I’ll be gentle, love.”</p><p>Harry closes his eyes when Denik removes the cloak, leaving him bound and naked and ready for the taking.  Denik hadn’t lied; when he touches Harry, it’s reverent, as if he’s any rougher Harry will break.  He doesn’t say anything else, but he doesn’t need to.  His magic’s enough a sign of intent, because he’s made wide and gaping with just a single touch of Denik’s finger.</p><p>His finger enters him with little preamble, reaching deep inside thanks to magic.  He adds another in seconds, scissoring the two digits back and forth and then thrusting forward enough to draw a yelp from Harry.</p><p>When he pulls his fingers out, Harry lets out a small gasp in surprise.  Denik’s hand rests on his hip for a moment in hesitation, as if he doesn’t want to hurt Harry, but then he’s pressing in, the blunt head of his cock hard and unyielding.  Harry digs his nails into his palms, tears gathering at the edge of his eyes, and he lets loose a breath, trying his best to relax even though Denik is still thrusting forward.</p><p>And then he’s all the way in.  Harry thinks he’s going to break if he thinks any longer about it, so he doesn’t think and just lets go, wrapping himself in the feeling of Denik inside him.  He’s large, and it’s something he hadn’t thought about the first time since he hadn’t anything to compare it to, but he’s just really <em>big</em> and it’s making Harry lose his mind.</p><p>“Are you okay, love?” asks Denik, his hands placed at the side of his hips and Harry doesn’t respond.</p><p>Denik doesn’t need it though, linked as they are, and without any more hesitation, he moves.  He doesn’t give Harry time to rest; instead, he’s relentless, almost as if he wants to get it over with.</p><p>And Harry would be offended, but he can’t – not when he should <em>want</em> this to be over as soon as possible.  Because he shouldn’t want Denik in him, he shouldn’t enjoy this, not when Denik’s only doing this because of Voldemort.</p><p>He tries his best to hold in his whimpers, but just like the last time, he can’t hold it back for long, so overwhelmed with the feeling of Denik fucking him hard and long.   He still remembers how hard he had been taken; to him, it had happened just yesterday, even though that had to be impossible considering how much Denik had changed.  And he still remembers how completely out of control he had felt, and now, with the ropes, the feeling was only amplified.</p><p>Just like last time, Denik doesn’t slow at all when he gets close; in fact, he speeds up to nearly punishing levels.  Harry bites down hard on his lip, but the whimpers escape anyway, and it’s all he can do to stop himself from pleading for a break.  He should take it like a good boy, considering Denik’s really only fucking him to help him, and he repeats this over and over in his head even when Denik thrusts so hard he almost whites out.</p><p>Cum is spurting into him a second later, tearing a shocked gasp out of him as he swivels to look at Denik.  He’s sweating, which isn’t a surprise considering the speed he had been fucking Harry, and his blonde hair looks so out of place to what he’s used to.  But when Denik opens his now green eyes and looks at him, a sappy smile starting to form, Harry flushes at the sight.  He can’t help noticing how attractive the blonde hair makes Denik look and he feels guilty for it.</p><p>This time, the dizzying spell from Denik taking his magic is significantly less, and since the ropes disappear at the same time, all Harry feels is relief.  He doesn’t move for a second even after the ropes are gone, still sore from being held down in the same position for so long, so Denik has enough time to help him up, bringing him into his lap and cuddling him.</p><p>“Is this okay?” he asks, even though he had been so forceful to Harry earlier, and Harry nods, unable to form words.  He buries his face into the crook of Denik’s neck and wonders just how he had gotten himself in this predicament. </p><p>Denik brings a hand up, and for the second time of the day, he plays with Harry’s hair.  He’s gentle about it, and it feels good in a way, letting him have a brief respite to calm down his still quickly beating heart. </p><p>“Your friends are safe.”</p><p>Denik’s voice is soft, so soft that if Harry wasn’t currently cuddled up to him, there was no way he would’ve heard him.  He glances up in surprise, but before he can interrogate Denik about it, the door opens.</p><p>The wizard standing in the doorway is obviously a horcrux.  Even if he looks different from before, Harry knows he’ll never forget how one of them looks; beyond that, he’ll never forget how the magic that they all release into the air feels.</p><p>He’s taller than Denik, and his hair is jet black and pulled into a low ponytail.  He looks aristocratic, with his high cheekbones and well-defined nose, only punctuated with the way he’s staring at Harry and Denik.  He’s also much older, possibly old enough to be one of Harry’s professors, though his age does nothing to detract from his appearance.  He’s ridiculously attractive even though he looks nothing like Tom Riddle anymore, and Harry shifts uncomfortably.</p><p>The horcrux notices because his stern expression disappears immediately, turning into a crooked smirk.  It fits on him, despite making him look evil despite his princely exterior, and Harry shivers unconsciously when the horcrux approaches.</p><p>“What do you go by now?” he asks when he regains control of himself, and the horcrux raises one elegant eyebrow.</p><p>“To everyone else, Presley, but to you, I’ll prefer you to call me Ring,” he says as he walks forward, and when he takes Harry’s hand into his, Harry doesn’t stop him.  Harry does stammer out intelligibly in shock when Ring bends down to kiss his hand because he’s still naked and his hole’s leaking Denik’s cum so he doesn’t really think he should be treated like an innocent maiden.</p><p>Ring looks like he’s thinking the same thing, because instead of letting go of his hand when he straightens, he pulls Harry into him, drawing a yelp from Harry and an outraged sound from Denik.</p><p>“Hey!” protests Denik, and Ring just smirks at him before leaning down and drawing Harry into a deep kiss. </p><p>And surprisingly, Harry isn’t even bothered by Ring not asking for permission; he’s much more distracted by the way Ring kisses him, sweet and slow and so much like the last time when Ring had his tongue in Harry’s arse.  The memory makes him flush a deep red and Ring seems to notice when he finally pulls away.</p><p>“A little hot and bothered, are we?” he asks, his British accent even more prominent than before, and it <em>fits</em> so well with the image Ring presents that it makes Harry a little dizzy for a second.</p><p>And he knows exactly why he’s short of breath and it’s because, even though Denik had only been supposed to fuck him to remove the ropes, he’s still so turned on that it’s a little embarrassing.</p><p>He’s not wearing anything, and so when Ring pushes him gently back onto the bed, the skin-to-skin contact only makes him want him even more.</p><p>Harry’s guilty that he feels this way because his horniness has done more harm than good – after all, Voldemort <em>won</em> because of him – and it must show on his face or in his mind, he’s not quite sure how Ring knows, but Ring isn’t getting closer to him, he’s just frowning at him.</p><p>“Do not feel guilty about enjoying yourself, Harry,” he commands, and he gently places his hands on Harry’s shoulders.  “I am not going to fuck you if you continue beating yourself up over nothing.”</p><p>“And what if I don’t want to fuck you?” he asks, just to be contrary, and he’s rewarded when Ring rolls his eyes at him. </p><p>“Do you <em>want</em> me to spank you?” he asks, and then pauses when quite obviously, Harry’s dick gives a twitch at the thought.  “Ah,” he says, and for a second, Harry thinks he’s going to be turned around and spanked right then and there, but instead, Ring hooks his arms around his legs, pulling him close enough that Harry’s legs are on either side of him.</p><p>Harry doesn’t struggle and lets himself get pulled, and although he doesn’t want to admit it, he likes the feeling of it, of how powerless it makes him feel.  The spanking is sounding more and more enticing, but it looks like Ring isn’t about to humor him.</p><p>“You want to be punished,” Ring says, lowly, “because you think you did something wrong.  But you don’t realize that you’re right where you belong.”</p><p>“I belong <em>here</em>?” he asks, just to see the way Ring’s eyes narrow at him.</p><p>“Yes,” Ring all but snarls, and then quite suddenly moves so that he can shove his pointer finger straight into Harry’s abused hole.</p><p>It’s the suddenness of the action that makes Harry cry out and not the pain, because he’s already stretched open from Denik’s dick and Ring’s finger doesn’t do anything.  The cum inside squelches around Ring’s finger, and Ring makes a face before adding another.  He doesn’t seem very happy with how open Harry is thanks to Denik, and he’s about to apologize when Ring adds his ring finger, drawing a short gasp from him.</p><p>This seems to be all the time Denik can stand being ignored, because he’s suddenly there, hoisting Harry up and into his arms.  His back’s flush with Denik’s, with the horcrux’s leg surrounding him, and he can feel Denik’s cock already stiffening back up behind him.</p><p>Ring doesn’t look very happy that Denik is intruding, and it’s obvious by the way his mouth’s quirked downward.  “You already had him to yourself,” he says, his lip curling, but Denik just laughs at Ring’s ire.</p><p>“Come on,” he said, “can’t we share like we did last time?”</p><p>Ring looks outraged, “I did not fuck him the last time, and I believe I might’ve been the only one.  You can watch, if you must, but this time, Harry’s mine.”  His word ends with a snarl, and without warning, he pulls his hand out and then thrusts right into Harry until he’s balls deep.</p><p>Harry screams, biting down hard on his lip in order to try and muffle something, but he hadn’t even noticed Ring undressing so he’s surprised.  He can’t even do anything but wrap his legs around Ring because Denik is still holding him captive, and complaining loudly, his grumbles hard to understand as Harry’s currently getting fucked <em>hard</em>.</p><p>“I don’t belong here,” he tries again, because their conversation had been sidetracked earlier, and he wants the horcrux to understand, but all it succeeds in doing is getting Ring even more annoyed.  His thrusts are brutal and relentless as he shoves hard into Harry, pushing him back into Denik’s broad chest each and every thrust. </p><p>“You do,” says Denik, instead of Ring, and he’s still so hard and unyielding behind Harry, each thrust pushing him back not only on Denik’s chest, but also his cock, and he flushes at the memory of him getting penetrated by both Locket and Diadem. </p><p>Denik loops a hand underneath Harry, and it’s quite obvious that he’s jerking himself off, the pre-cum smearing onto Harry’s back. </p><p>Ring notices as well, a smirk on his face as he looks up at Denik.  “You can wait if you want,” he says, “because I’m more than willing to take you after, Denik.”</p><p>Harry can’t see Denik’s reaction, and although he’s pretty sure Ring means it as a joke, the picture it brings up is almost too much for him.  Denik’s blonde hair will look way too pretty splayed on a bed and he’ll look so gorgeous with a flush in his face as Ring rams him as hard as he’s doing Harry, and the thought makes him come untouched.</p><p>His cum lands on his own chest, and while the feeling is degrading, the thought of them knowing exactly what made him come is way more embarrassing than to dwell on how utterly dirty he is.</p><p>He must tighten up in a way Ring likes because the horcrux inside of him groans, his own cum joining Diary’s old cum a second later.</p><p>Both horcruxes are quiet for a long time after Ring pulls out before Denik whines, “Are you kidding me, Harry?  I’m definitely not going to let this guy do <em>anything</em> to me!”</p><p>Ring sighs, his hand going up to push up his sweat-matted hair away from his forehead.  He looks annoyed, but there’s a flush on his cheeks that suggested he’s quite content.  The image is unbearably hot, and since he’s older now, his chest and shoulders are way broader than before, and traitorously, his mind supplies him the image of how absolutely easy it would be for him to make good on his words.</p><p>“Do you still need my help?” Ring asks, but Denik’s already pulling away from Harry, frowning.</p><p>“No, your offer made me not hard anymore, so thanks for that.”</p><p>“You were okay with us both penetrating Harry and this is what makes you pause?” asks Ring.  He’s already stepped away, pulling his robes back on as he talks to Denik.</p><p>“Totally not the same thing,” says Denik, sounding so much like the petulant teenager that he now is that Harry actually snorts and laughs.  The two of them look at him with surprise, before looking at each other, their expressions unreadable.</p><p>When Harry stops laughing, Ring bends to press a kiss to his lips.  When he straightens, he looks at Denik, “Take care of him,” he commands before sweeping out of the door, his robes flaring out behind him.</p><p>There’s a moment of silence in the room before Denik bends and presses his own kiss to Harry’s lips.  Unlike Ring though, he deepens the kiss until Harry is whimpering into his mouth as Denik grips both sides of his face gently, drawing him even deeper.</p><p>It makes his head spin to be kissed so tenderly, with so much affection behind it, that when Denik pulls away, Harry’s a little lightheaded. </p><p>Denik is looking down at him with an inscrutable expression, almost as if he’s unsure of what to do next.  Harry’s heart aches for some odd reason and he to look away from Denik’s eyes.  “Are you leaving like Ring?” he asks, and Denik shakes his head.</p><p>“No,” he says, and then he bends so he can gather Harry up into his arms.  He brings Harry into a more comfortable part of the bed, where it’s not ruined by the cum still leaking out of him.  “You should get some rest,” he says, “there’s no telling when the others are going to stop by.”</p><p>“Okay,” he says, uncertainly, because while he is feeling sleepy, the thought of the others coming to see him makes his heart race.  He’s not sure if it’s in a good way or a bad way, but he supposes he has more than enough time to sort out his feelings.  It’s not like Voldemort would be letting him go anytime soon. “You said my friends are safe?”</p><p>He hadn’t thought it was smart to ask while Ring was still here, because he still isn’t sure if the horcruxes are working together or not.  He’s still not sure if he should even ask now, because it’ll be cruel to bring his hopes up for no reason, but he doesn’t think Denik would lie to him.</p><p>There’s a pause, and then Denik nods, “I can’t tell you more until we can teach you how to Obscure your thoughts, love.  But yes, they’re safe.  Please don’t ask me anymore questions.”  He brings Harry’s hand up to his lips, kissing it softly in a sign of affection.  Harry blushes and looks away, his heart soaring at the idea that his friends aren’t paying for his mistakes.</p><p>Of course, the whole world is, but at least his friends are safe. </p><p>And Harry’s still alive.  He might be the horcruxes’ playtoy and not know currently how he feels about all of them, but he’s <em>alive</em>. </p><p>And if he’s alive, he can still save everyone.  He’ll have to find a way to destroy the horcrux inside of him, and the other horcruxes too, but there’s still a way.</p><p>He just has to find it.</p><p>He’s just drifting off to sleep when Denik starts playing with his hair again.  The gentle motion is enough to help him finally fall asleep and he shifts closer to it, a smile on his face.</p><p>Denik watches, a wistfulness Harry hadn’t seen in his green eyes.  “I wish you were just mine,” he says, quietly, and then resigns himself to spending the rest of the day watching Harry.</p>
