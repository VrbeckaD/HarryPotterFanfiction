    <p>1.</p><p>Pansy carefully scratched on a wing with her eyeliner, drawing it so that it curved around the slope of her eye and came up into a delicate point. She had already done the other eye, so this one needed to match it perfectly.</p><p>When she was pleased with it, she sat back on the red velvet stool and examined herself in the mirror. Her straight dark hair hung down, pulled partially back by an intricate silver clip that tugged almost painfully on a few strands. Her makeup was done just the way Richard liked it; classy and simple, but enough to make her features pop. Her lips were plain, as per his request. She puckered them as she looked in the mirror, then let them settle into a frown. She looked so bland.</p><p>She stared down at the products on her makeup dresser. Gold containers of creamy foundation, powders, blushes that complemented her skin tone. She pulled open the drawer and rooted around for a moment before her fingers closed around a small tube. She pulled it out and looked at it. Gold like the rest, detailed with engraved golden flowers. She took off the cap and twisted it so the red product twirled up like a spire.</p><p>Making up her mind, she leaned forward and touched it to her lips, carefully outlining and then filling them in. When she was done she capped the product again and tilted her head, looking at herself again in the mirror. There. She looked a little less dead now.</p><p>“Pansy!”</p><p>She stood up and tugged at her dress, a beaded black chemise that hung off her figure without giving her added shape. She picked at the thin straps with long red nails.</p><p>“PANSY!”</p><p>“I’m coming,” she called back. Taking a deep breath, she turned away from her reflection and left the room, heels clacking on the hard floor.</p><p>Richard was waiting for her in the entrance hall as she descended the staircase. He wasn’t looking at her. The hard lines of his suit made his shoulders sharp rectangles, and his hair was slicked back perfectly.</p><p>She was on the last stair when he finally looked at her. His dark eyes narrowed. “What the hell did you do to your face?”</p><p>Pansy reached up and touched her lips. “I thought it matched the dress.”</p><p>“You look like a slut. How do you think that reflects on me?”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Richard scowled and checked his watch. “There’s no time to fix it now. We’re late. For Merlin’s sake, go and get a jacket, I don’t want the entire party staring at your fucking cleavage.”</p><p>He left without looking at her again, slamming the front door behind him. Pansy sighed. It was going to be a bad night, then.</p><p align="center">X X X X X</p><p>Pansy managed to slip away from Richard two hours into the party. It wasn’t as though he was paying any attention to her; he was too busy networking, wandering around with a slim glass of champagne in hand, chatting about real estate and charity and whatever else came with vast amounts of money to every influential attendee they crossed paths with. He didn’t have a word to say to Pansy, but he liked to have her on his arm-- or, rather, trailing after him with a charming smile. They looked good together, standing close but never quite touching, forever chaste in public.</p><p>Pansy bored of it all quickly, and was relieved when Richard cast his eyes around the ballroom and caught sight of someone on the other end of the room. “I must go have a private word with Mr. Stevens,” he said. “I’ll be back later.”</p><p>Pansy watched him cut through the crowd, watched people hurriedly step out of his way when they saw who it was trying to get past. She took a deep breath and released it, and then turned to weave her way out of the center of the room, where couples were dancing to the upbeat swing music playing from a trio of floating violins in the corner.</p><p>It was a smaller party than she was used to, one for the largest benefactors at the Ministry and other influential people. A few years ago Pansy would have been elated to be here, to be sweeping through the crowds in an elegant dress, attractive men hanging on her every word as she dealt favors with the other higher-ups of society. But now she was just tired, and she had been so far removed from the action in Richard’s dealings that no one bothered to approach her for any business. The most she got was the occasional smile from someone she vaguely recognized or an unintelligible whisper from one or another of the women.</p><p>Self-conscious, she tucked a strand of hair behind her hair and sidestepped a man who was clutching a glass of firewhiskey and laughing far too hard. She approached the snack table, which was laden with finger foods and glasses of alcohol. She eyed the cherry tarts and felt her stomach grumble, but she had eaten too much for lunch already. Instead, she grabbed a glass of white wine, glancing around to make sure Richard wasn’t nearby. He hated it when she drank, but she needed something to take the edge off the night.</p><p>“Parkinson.”</p><p>Pansy’s hand twitched, and her stomach dropped. She had been caught. She whirled around, half-expecting to find Richard there, seething because she had broken his rules, but she blinked in surprise to find someone else there.</p><p>It took her a moment to find her words. “It’s DuBois now, actually.”</p><p>Hermione Granger tilted her head, and Pansy tried hard not to stare. She had seen her in the papers, of course, but the black and white print never did anyone justice. Pansy hadn’t seen her in person in years, but Granger was older now, her features more regal and perhaps a bit more tired. Her hair was tied up in a smooth updo, nothing like the frizzy mess that Pansy used to laugh at.</p><p>“Right,” Granger said. “Richard DuBois. You two make an excellent couple.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Pansy said mechanically, used to accepting that particular compliment. She transferred her glass to her other hand and resisted the urge to wipe the wine that had spilled onto her hand off on her dress. “How are you?”</p><p>“I always hate these functions,” Granger said. Her dress was dark blue and cut carefully so it revealed just enough of her cleavage, but not too much. As far as Pansy could tell, she wasn’t wearing any makeup. “Have you tried the spinach puffs? They’re lovely.”</p><p>“No, I haven’t,” Pansy said.</p><p>Granger stared at her. Pansy took a nervous sip of wine, hoping that Granger would say something else and fill the silence, or else leave Pansy in peace so that she could sneak off and hide behind some curtains with her alcohol. Pansy had no interest in talking to Granger.</p><p>“How have you been?”</p><p>“Marvelous,” Pansy said, still on reflex. “Absolutely wonderful. And you? I’ve heard that you’re next in line for Minister.”</p><p>Granger cocked an eyebrow. “I wouldn’t go that far quite yet,” she said. “Candidates won’t be announced until late next year. I’m honored, however, by all the support I’ve received so far.”</p><p>“Spoken like a true politician.”</p><p>Granger smiled, just a bit.</p><p>“How are Potter and Weasley?” Pansy asked, more to be polite than any kind of curiosity.</p><p>“Oh, fine,” Granger said. “Ron’s just been promoted in the Auror office, and Harry is having a grand time being back at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Pansy bit her tongue on a snarky comment harkening back to their school days. She swirled her drink, eyes wandering over Granger’s shoulder to the rest of the room. The instruments had struck up a slower tune now, and the mood of the party had drifted to a more intimate one. It made Pansy’s skin crawl.</p><p>“And you?”</p><p>“Hm?” Pansy asked, distracted.</p><p>“What have you been doing?” Granger asked. Why was she still talking to Pansy? They had exchanged enough words to make a polite departure and never speak to one another again.</p><p>“Richard has been working closely with the owner of St. Mungo’s,” Pansy said. “He wants to help develop a new wing.”</p><p>“Oh,” Granger said. “That’s great.”</p><p>“I’m very proud,” Pansy said. She felt suddenly ill, far too hot in the fur she had pulled on to hide herself. She wanted to go home.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Granger asked, as though she could hear Pansy’s thoughts.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Pansy murmured. “If you’ll excuse me, I really must go and find Richard. He’ll be missing me.”</p><p>“Of course,” Granger said, watching as Pansy set her barely touched wine on the table once more. “It was lovely seeing you again.”</p><p>“And you,” Pansy said. “Best of luck with the campaign.”</p><p>She tugged her coat closer around herself as she turned away, fighting not to look back as she pushed her way back into the crowd. She had a headache, as usual. She always got headaches when she left the house. The music was even slower still, and one man called out to her with an offer for a dance when she passed him, but Pansy ducked her head and hurried on. She thought of her bed and wished she could just Apparate home, have a cup of tea, and then sleep for a few decades.</p><p>She found Richard mingling with a group of wizards from Magical Law Enforcement in the corner of the room. He was smiling and laughing, looking confident and at ease, and Pansy pushed her shoulders back and painted on a smile of her own as she joined them.</p><p>It took Richard a few moments to notice her, but when he did he put a heavy arm around her and tugged her closer to his side. Pansy felt as though she might pass out.</p><p>“Allow me to introduce my wife!”</p><p align="center">X X X X X</p><p>They left hours later when Richard was finally ready. He had had one too many drinks, and let Pansy take the lead in the Apparition, clinging to her arm so tightly she feared it would bruise. They landed in their dark, silent entrance hall, and Pansy blinked to let her eyes get adjusted to the sudden change in lighting.</p><p>Richard released her without a word and walked away, footsteps heavy. Pansy watched him go warily, then glanced towards the stairwell. She could try and leave, but she knew he would be upset if he wasn’t tended to in this state.</p><p>She followed him into the parlor. He had already collapsed on the sofa with a moan, pinching the bridge of his nose and breathing heavily. She waved her hand as she entered and a small fire struck up in the fireplace, bathing him in orange light. She was about to go around and light some of the lamps when he said, “Come here.”</p><p>She swallowed, and then slowly walked over to him. He didn’t look at her as she approached, but when she got close enough he reached up and curled his fingers around her hips. In one sharp tug she had fallen over and landed in his lap, grabbing the back of the sofa to steady herself.</p><p>“Did you have a nice time?” he asked.</p><p>She laughed and tried to slip out of his grip, but he just tightened his hold. “Of course, darling,” she said. “And you?”</p><p>“Stevens commented on your lipstick,” he mumbled. He smelled strongly of firewhiskey. “Said you looked nice. Maybe I was wrong about it.”</p><p>“Well, thank you, darling.”</p><p>Richard was staring up at the ceiling. His eyes looked white in the light of the fire. His hands hand loosened on Pansy, so she braced herself and said, “How about I go and make us each a cup of tea before bed, hmm?”</p><p>Before she could get up Richard had wrapped his arms around her and pulled her down so she was lying flush against his chest. She had already taken off her jacket, and she struggled to pull up her dress so that her bra didn’t show.</p><p>“He’s right, you do look nice,” Richard said.</p><p>“Richard, let go of me, please,” Pansy said quietly, wiggling to try and get out.</p><p>“What, I can’t compliment my own wife? I said you look nice.”</p><p>“Thank you, Richard.”</p><p>“I thought that’s what you wanted,” Richard said, and it sounded like he was talking to himself now. “More attention? Isn’t that it?”</p><p>“You’ve been drinking, Richard, surely you must be tired. Let me go make you some tea.”</p><p>“I don’t want tea,” Richard said, his voice suddenly strong, and Pansy flinched. Richard went still, as though smelling her fear, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. “Just lay with me a moment.”</p><p>So she laid there, awkwardly on top of him, letting him run his fingers up and down her back, trying very hard not to breathe through her nose and smell his sweat and cologne and that sickly stench of alcohol that always spelled trouble for her. Every movement of his hand tugged her dress further and further up, and soon she was cold and worried that he would see her undergarments.</p><p>When he pressed his lips against her neck, she tilted her head back to allow him access, staring up at the ceiling and counting very slowly in her head. When she got to ten she started from one again, feeling his lips travel lower, stopping at her collar bone. His fingers tugged at the fabric of her dress.</p><p>And then in one swift move that she thought he would be too drunk to perform, he flipped her over onto her back and switched their positions so that he was on top and she was immobile underneath him, held down by his hands pressing her wrists into the leather of the couch. With one hand he held her, and with the other he felt his way under her dress and grabbed roughly at the waistband of her underwear.</p><p>“Richard!” Her voice came out a yelp.</p><p>“Shut up,” he said gruffly, feeling down there, exploring, and Pansy felt tears perk in her eyes and she let out a high-pitched whine and wriggled, trying to get away, and then she felt a sharp pain in her cheek and went still.</p><p>Richard made a noise of annoyance and sat up, still keeping her lower half pressed into the couch. Pansy laid still, hardly breathing. Her cheek tingled where he had slapped her.</p><p>“Can’t even get attention from my own wife,” Richard said. Even in the dark she could tell his cheeks were red with anger and alcohol. “Fine. Be that way. Go and make your fucking tea.”</p><p>He got off of her and stomped away, stumbling only once and catching himself on the armchair. And then he was gone, but Pansy still felt choked by the whiskey smell he and his slicked back hair left behind.</p><p>She stayed where she was and breathed for several minutes, half fearing he would come back. When she heard the creaking stop above her, she thought it safe enough to reach down and pull up her underwear and smooth her dress down again. She got up quietly and stood; her heels had fallen off when Richard had pulled her onto him, and she left them there. She walked out of the parlor, down the hall, and into the first floor bathroom, where she shut the wooden door tightly behind her. When she waved a hand, the lights flickered on, bathing her in light, and she looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair was a mess, the silver hairpin hanging by a few painful threads, and her red lipstick was smeared across her right cheek. She looked pale and ill, and she stared at herself and her chest heaved and then she was crying.</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand to keep quiet and stumbled over to the toilet. She sat down on the seat, struggling to breathe, seeing spots swimming around her as she cried painful, gut-wrenchingly quiet sobs. She cried often, but it had been a while since it had been this violent. She kept both hands pressed firmly over her mouth and let the tears ruin the rest of her makeup.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she sat there, but when she had stopped and had spent a good fifteen minutes just staring at the white tiles underneath her feet, she finally started to move. She pulled a length of toilet paper off the roll and used it to wipe away her eyeliner and the smeared lipstick. She got to her feet and turned on the faucet and scrubbed cold water into her skin. She took out her hairpin and set it down beside the sink and didn’t look at herself in the mirror again.</p><p>The house was quiet and still when she left the bathroom. She moved slowly up the stairs, clinging to the banister, an empty numbness settling deep into her stomach. When she got upstairs, she went to her and Richard’s bathroom and took off the rest of her makeup in the dark.</p><p>When she had finished, she went into her room and crawled into bed next to him without bothering to get undressed, and didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.</p><p align="center">X X X X X</p><p>Pansy received a letter the next morning. She was cleaning up after Richard’s breakfast when she heard the tap on the glass at the window and gone to let in the small tawny owl. She untied the letter from its leg and pulled out a small bowl to fill with water and set down for it to drink from. As it rested, she glanced down at the envelope, already opening her mouth to call Richard down from the bedroom when she realized that it was addressed to her.</p><p>Pansy blinked. It had no return address. For a second she thought it might be from Draco, but no, the handwriting was unfamiliar, and he hadn’t spoken to her in months. It wasn’t from her parents, either. Pansy had no idea who it was from.</p><p>She heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and in a snap decision she stuffed it under her shirt and into her bra. Straightening her shirt, she turned back to the table and continued clearing away Richard’s dirty plates.</p><p>He scowled when he walked in, dressed for work with his hair smartly dressed. “Do I have a letter?”</p><p>“Hm?” Pansy followed his gaze to the owl, which was still pecking at the water. “Oh, no. It didn’t have any mail with it. I think it’s lost.”</p><p>“Then why is it here? I told you to stop letting the dirty things into our home, just take the stupid mail and send it away.” He stalked across the kitchen and waved at it. “Go on, shoo!”</p><p>The poor thing hopped away from the water with a squawk, narrowly avoiding his swing, and then took off through the open window again.</p><p>“Have a good day at work, dear,” Pansy said. She tried to approach him and give him a kiss to the cheek, but the look he sent her way made her lose her confidence.</p><p>“Oh, now you want to kiss me,” he said.</p><p>“Richard-”</p><p>“Have the bedroom cleaned by the time I get home, you’ve let it get filthy.”</p><p>He left without another word. Pansy remained where she was and flinched when he slammed the front door behind him. The sound echoed long after he was gone.</p><p>She sat down at the table and reached down the front of her shirt, pulling the envelope out again. She looked at her own name scrawled on it in blue ink. <em> Pansy DuBois </em>. Sometimes she didn’t recognize it.</p><p>She turned it over in her hands and sliced it open with her fingernail. The paper she drew out was heavy and felt expensive. She carefully unfolded it and read.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mrs. DuBois, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sorry if this reaches you at an ungodly hour. I sent the slowest owl I could. When I approached you last night, I forgot to ask you the real question I had for you. If you would be so kind as to join me for lunch at my office this afternoon, I would very much appreciate it. I know you are very busy, but I won’t take up too much of your time. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sincerely yours, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Hermione Granger </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Pansy read it three times before the message finally made sense to her. She lowered it into her lap and stared at the remains of the yolk already crusting onto Richard’s empty plate. She had never expected Hermione Granger to try and talk to her again, let alone invite her to lunch. There was no way Pansy could go, Richard would be furious if she went out without his permission.</p><p>She had already crossed over to the pad of paper on the counter and had picked up a pen to scrawl a return letter politely turning down the invitation indefinitely, but then she paused. Richard had said that he wouldn’t be home until late tonight, and Granger might have something important to tell her. It wouldn’t hurt to drop by and hear her out.</p><p>Pansy set down her pen. She raised her hand and touched her cheekbone, where she knew a faint bruise had formed over the course of the night. She would have to cast a Glamour to hide it.</p><p>Pansy untied the apron around her waist and set it down on the counter, making up her mind. She needed to clean the bedroom fast if she wanted it done before she left.</p>
