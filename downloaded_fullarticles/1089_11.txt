    <p align="left">In the silence of the dark, cold and unwelcoming manor the blood curdling screams echoed throughout the empty halls, bounced off stone walls and pristine polished floors. The eerie sounds of pain and torture was not unknown within this building to say the least. But to be able to reach one’s hearing from across the building was astounding.</p>
<p align="left">The screeches that the tortured woman was making, sent a shiver down the back of the dark wizard standing close by the fire in the library. But if one was to look upon the man, they wouldn’t have noticed with his stock still form and bored impassive expression. His dark eyes gazed at the dancing embers in the hearth, the heat from the flames not warming his soul as the dark amber liquid swirled around in his crystal tumbler.</p>
<p align="left">“Bella is enjoying her new little play thing, quite too much.” Lucius, once beautiful methodical now hoarse and downtrodden voice chimed from the whinged back chair behind the dark imposing wizard. With another anguish scream, the blonde shook his head and took a long swig of his own fire whiskey. “By the screams that woman is making, there can’t be any doubt that she is all too much enthralled with inflicting as much pain to her new toy than normal. But again who is to say what is considered normal for that deranged witch.”</p>
<p align="left">“Indeed.” The rich silky drawl of the imposing figure agreed. Turing slowly around, he stared at the bedraggled shell of a man before him. “Pray tell me who is this new toy of Bella’s that seems to giving her so much...<em>pleasure. </em><span>Is the chit worth all the attention?</span>”</p>
<p align="left">“Oh course the bitch is. After all she’s Potter’s mudblood.” Lucius sneered, raising his tumbler to his mouth and added. “The snatchers found her with Potter and that Weasley brat in the Forest of Dean. They were hidden there apparently for a while it seems seeing as Yaxley was unable to find them after flooing to their previous hide away.”</p>
<p align="left">The look of surprised graced the blond’s, guest’s face. “And with having these undesirables under your roof, have you contacted the Dark Lord?” He asked with a look of interest upon his stoic features as another agonizing scream caressed these damnable walls like a lovers kiss.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m not daft. I already called for him...against Bella’s wishes. As you can tell she wanted some time alone with the filthy mudblood. She needed to obtain information as to why they were in possession of an item that should be clearly in hers.” He said carefully, eyeing the other man then finishing the rest of his drink.</p>
<p align="left">Silence filled the air, there was no more shrieks of pain echoing through the halls just complete and total silence. “It seems she has finished with her little fun, Lucius. We should join her before the Dark Lord shows up. We don’t want her to take all the glory from you now can we?”</p>
<p align="left">The dark wizard’s chocolate smooth voice brought the broken man back to the here and now, giving him a sense of renewed hope. Slowly he nodded, setting his crystal glass down on the end table with a clank and rose from the comforts of his chair and led the way to the drawing room. Nearing the designated room, the eerie quiet sound dissipated with the sound of crashing and yelling of hexes being shouted off.</p>
<p align="left">The pandemonium that ensued in the room caused the to wizards to rush in, one with a wand in hand and the other not. The scene before their very eyes unfolded as Bellatrix held on to the mudblood aiming her wand as she, Narcissa, and Draco fired spell after spell only to have spells sent back at them. The other two thirds of the golden trio fought diligently, trying with all their might to save their friend from the clutches of the deranged witch.</p>
<p align="left">The fighting continued to go back and forth until the sound of squeaking chimed in among the ruckus of the room. All firing stalled as eyes glanced upward as the elf Dobby unscrewed the chandelier from the ceiling allowing it to fall directly above Bellatrix. With fast reflexes, the witched cast her toy to the side in the waiting hands of Greyback to step back from the crashing light fixture.</p>
<p align="left">“You tried to kill me!” The crazed witch bellowed out.</p>
<p align="left">“Not kill, but maim.” The little elf said as he stood protectively in front of Harry Potter and his friend.</p>
<p align="left">Everyone in the room could see that Bella was seething with rage and threw her dagger at the trio when Dobby apparated them out of the manor and leaving behind a scared lioness behind.</p>
