</p><p>In the world called Arda, the world that was also called or known as Middle Earth.</p><p>The Valar had blessed the Elves the gift of Immortality, the gift of their magic and children, and also…the gift of Love.</p><p>To know their Elven Soulmates--they bear a mark that symbolizes their pair, their other half.</p><p>Like one match shows one bears the mark that symbolizes their warrior personality, and its pair shows the mark that symbolizes its gentle and earthly nature from where they were born and raised.</p><p>Sometimes, one elf wouldn’t have a soulmate mark on their being, for it is because the other pair hasn’t been born yet.  And once the other pair has been born, the elf with its missing mark will show itself of its pair and they will rejoice.</p><p>However, what one Elf did not expect, is that when he hadn’t gotten his mark for about five millenniums, is that his soulmate, his other pair would be born and raised from another world--a world of magic--much different yet similarly amazing like in Middle Earth.</p><p>This is the story of an Elven King, lonely and sad on the inside, and cold-hearted and stone-faced on the outside, who found his soulmate as his mark appeared, and find out about this other pair.</p><p>Through his dreams.</p><p>OOOOO</p><p>In the world of magic, divided from the mundane and the magical sides, there is a simple magical house, a couple of a wizard and a witch was rejoicing at the birth of their newborn daughter.</p><p>But what other wizards and witches didn’t know about this particular family is that they’re actually Elves in disguise.</p><p>And they are not just any Elves that are vastly different from the elves that were there in that world of magic.</p><p>For they are the Elves from Arda or Middle Earth itself.</p><p>Somehow, by a twist of fate or from the pull of magic itself, these two elves had somehow gotten into this other world of magic, and have lived their lives in hiding to not reveal their elven heritage for they fear of the inborn prejudice and bias they have seen and witness among the magical populace.</p><p>With help from magic, that they have learned through their education and schooling, they managed to fool each of their pair’s families into thinking that they are theirs for a long time, and they have used the magic they have obtained and learned to disguise themselves carefully for a long time that so many have believed that the two elves were the same magical beings among them.</p><p>Only those who have the inner unique insight of magic can see their true forms.</p><p>Like the magical creatures called and known as the Centaurs, the goblins, the house-elves, and the like.</p><p>As these two elves had found each other and found out that they are soulmates, they didn’t hesitate to be together, much to the protest of one of the pairs’ families and then bonded and then had borne their most precious treasure, which is their elfling daughter.</p><p>Little did this elven family know is that one manipulative headmaster had somehow found out about their true heritage and wanted to exploit and use their daughter for nefarious evil means, and also bring the magical world’s most feared dark wizard into their midst and kill them because of a prophecy foretold of the dark wizard’s defeat--just to get the elfling daughter.</p><p>But what they all don’t know--except the elf parents--it is that this elfling girl, she is unique and special, and it’s not just because she is an elfling or that she is an Elf.</p><p>For this little elf, she bears the soulmate mark of a great elf man, an Elvenking, who would witness her immortal life on how she’s living hers in that other world, somehow by through their shared dreams.</p><p>This is their story. This is their journey.</p><p>Witness on how these two soulmate pair will struggle through many adventures, trials, and difficulties.

  <strong> <b>CHAPTER 1 - THE KING’S SOULMATE AND THE BEGINNING OF DREAMS</b> </strong>
</p><p>It’s been almost a hundred years since he had turned his back on the dwarrows/dwarves when they had asked for his help to go face and fight against the dragon that has taken over their mountain homes.</p><p>A hundred years since he had been scarred both physically and mentally from the dragon he had faced and had fled with his elven kin back to the Woodland Realm and the time where the feud between Elves and Dwarves had started.</p><p>A thousand years, since the passing of his elven wife, which he married through political arrangement from his father before.</p><p>But to Thranduil, the Elvenking of the Woodland Realm, it has been almost 5,000 years for him…that he still has no mark of his soulmate, his fated pair.</p><p>The cold-hearted yet lonely Elvenking wondered to himself as he sat silently on his throne, his eyes gazing at nothingness in the grand room, that whether it might be a punishment from the Valar that he has long not found his soulmate as he still bears no mark of his pair.</p><p>For too long, he had suffered both outwardly and internally over the scars that he had gotten and endured when he had part of his face burned from facing the dragon back at the accursed dwarves’ mountains.  Although he has elven magic to make glamours to hide his scars on the surface, it would not erase or heal the agony and pain he has suffered over the years from the burning scars that are also tainted with dark magic.</p><p>He wondered again to himself whether this is the punishment that he would have to endure as he had no soulmate and believed that for all eternity he will have to suffer this kind of torment.</p><p>Until one day, everything changed for the Elven king when he had woken up after another painful night from his scar…and found that all of his heartfelt hopes has not diminished in his immortal elven life.</p><p>As the rays of the morning sun had risen and shines brightly into his bedchambers, he woke up groggily and in pain when he suffered another sleepless painful night over his ongoing agonizing cursed burn scars, he reached over to take a drink from the healing potion that was left from his healers to treat his pain but not permanently.</p><p>For no matter how hard the elven healers have tried, they could not find the cure or any means for their Elven king to go through lessened pain of the eternal suffering of his scars.</p><p>But the Elven king was strong and he had endured it for so long, even though he suffers mentally and emotionally inside--and it’s not just about his scarred appearance, but also for the loss of the mark of his soulmate.</p><p>As he weakly and tiredly dressed himself in his royal clothing and strongly tries to face another day as the king, he stopped in mid-change and stared at himself shocked in the tall large mirror standing before him at something he had never thought to see that is on his body, besides the scars that were glamoured part of his face.</p><p>There was suddenly a mark on him--a soulmate mark!</p><p>The markings that were somehow intricately painted on the whole of his right arm from shoulder to wrist in elegant and beautiful emerald-green forest-like vines and its leaves seemed to be shining brightly like the pure white gems of starlight itself.  And whenever and however his right arm moved, the white starlight gems of the leaves seemed to be shining and glowing brighter like magic.  There are also two unique creatures he does not recognize or is familiar with that is entwined within the green vines.  A golden-red bird that looked like its glowing in fiery burning flames, and a pure silver-white horse with a big sharp silver horn on its forehead.</p><p>Thranduil just stared dumbstruck stunned at the reflection on the mirror of himself with the newly-appeared mark of his fated pair, before he had realized that he was reaching his left hand shakily to touch his right arm that is marked of the symbol of his soulmate at long last.</p><p>He also didn’t realize or was even aware that his son, the Prince of the Woodland Realm, Legolas Greenleaf have entered into his room with a new healing potion in his hands for his father.</p><p>Prince Legolas became a little confused about why his father is standing in front of his mirror, staring at himself while still dressed in his pants but not wearing his shirt yet.  That was until he caught sight of his father’s mark.</p><p>He gaped stunned and it took a silent moment for him to finally blurt out. “Ada! (<strong><em><b>Father</b></em></strong>!) <strong><em><b>Your mark</b></em></strong>!” he said in Sindarin Elf language.</p><p>King Thranduil gave a deep sigh as if he was relieved that he heard his son’s outburst like he was thinking that he’s still dreaming and that the mark on his arm wasn’t there all along.</p><p>“<strong><em><b>Yes, my son</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>. T</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>he mark of my soulmate…at last</b></em></strong>…” he whispered in awe and wonder as he lovingly caressed the mark of his pair, with small pleasurable shivers running down his spine as if the mark is sending sparking reactions inside his body and arousing him a little, where Thranduil believed that he wouldn’t be able to feel them after so long of having a cold personality, both inside and out.</p><p>“<strong><em><b>But then, that would mean</b></em></strong><strong><em><b> </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>your mat</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>e--</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>has just been born</b></em></strong>!” Legolas deduced instantly as he looked excited at the prospect that his father would have someone to love deeply in his heart, despite that his father’s soulmate pair is still newly-born and just a little elfling.  He had long known about his father and his mother were just a political marriage match, and though he is older in the inside and young on the outside, he had longed for true motherly love for himself and a true soulmate love for his father.  He had prayed to the Valar himself, wishing that his father would be granted his lifelong heartfelt wish on having his soulmate and give his heart to love.  Now that his wish is granted, Legolas was truly happy for his father.</p><p>Thranduil nodded and then became serious as he put on his shirt and dressed completely before turning to his son Legolas. “<strong><em><b>Send word out throughout the whole of Middle Earth</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>. S</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>omewhere out there, my soulmate--an elfling has been born--and I want myself to be the first to be notified of this from the searchers and find out who </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>they are</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>Legolas understood and he swiftly ran off to tell the messengers and searchers of his father’s orders just that while Thranduil still stayed in his bedroom, stroking his sleeve-covered right arm again with his left hand as if making sure that the soulmate mark is still there.</p><p>He wondered who and what kind of soulmate they are.</p><p>Little did he know is that he will get his answers through his dreams--in the first time of his eternal life--in one of the sleepless nights he might be dreading for again.</p><p>And the answers he would get about his soulmate are the ones that he would not expect.</p><p>Once the messengers and searchers had gone out through the whole world of Middle Earth, the Elven King Thranduil had gone through another day, finishing some tasks and other royal matters before it is now night time and he is dreading again, going through another sleepless night that is added with pain from his long-cursed burn scars on him.</p><p>However, once he changes to his sleepwear, and then he lies on his grand bed and his head hits the pillow, it won’t take long for Thranduil to reach into slumber and realize much to his surprise and bafflement that he will be having the first time of the beginning nights and have a peaceful and dream-full sleep.</p><p>OOOOO</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He blinked and found himself in his royal robes and looked to be standing inside what appeared to be a cottage.  It took a split-second for Thranduil to realize that he’s sleeping peacefully and dreaming something.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Then the elf king heard soft laughter from an adult and child and he walked forward curiously to see who is making the sounds.</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong><b>He saw a female elf cradling a baby elfling girl in her arms as she sang a</b></strong><strong><b>n</b></strong><strong><b> Elven song to her as a lullaby, but her daughter seemed to be stubborn on staying awake as she giggled and flailed her arms about with a mischievous grin on her face</b></strong>.</p><p>The mother elf seemed to sigh in exasperation as she spoke to her baby girl in the Elven language. “<strong><em><b>Really, little Hari? Please be a good little girl to your mother and go to sleep</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>The baby elfling girl kept babbling on as if refusing her mother’s wish, making the elf woman sigh again.</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil wondered why he is dreaming such a thing before him in his sleep, but it didn’t take long for him to realize in stunned shock when he saw the forming soulmate mark on the elfling’s chubby little right arm.</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong> <b>On it, he could see almost the same intricate forest green vines entwining in the baby elfling’s arm like his, except the design is showing that the</b> </strong> <strong> <b> forest-green</b> </strong> <strong> <b> vines</b> </strong> <strong> <b> has shining silver and sapphire blue gems on the leaves and the vines</b> </strong> <strong> <b> are being entwined around and over the images of what looked to be a great stag that is similar to his Elven royal elk, twin elvish swords similar-looking to his prized weapons and a longbow and quiver full of arrows like his son Legolas always wields.</b> </strong></p><p><strong><b>Thranduil just stared and didn’t realize that he was kneeling and trying to get closer to the elf mother and her baby elfling to have a closer look as he realized instantly that the little elfling girl is his soulmate.</b></strong> </p><p>Until a male elf’s voice sounded out from behind the ghost-like Thranduil. “<strong><em><b>Well, what do you expect, my love? Our little one is staying awake to wait for her daddy to come home</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He stood up quickly and he could hear his soulmate squeal with joy and then babble aloud to her elf father who had just come in from wherever he was outside and he was approaching to his wife and child with a big smile on his face, with the same mischievous look on his personality, that his daughter has gotten it from him.  He watched the loving moment unfold of the small family of elves before him.</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong><b>Thranduil didn’t think that the rare gift known as Dream-sharing would come to him and his soulmate so that they would find each other by their paired connection.  He knew that his soulmate, the little elfling girl wouldn’t be able to have the same Dream-sharing as the elf king has because she is too young.  It will take a few centuries for her to be gifted with it for her pair</b></strong>.</p><p>The elf man who is the elfling’s father knelt to pick up his baby elfling from his wife, and the elfling reached out her chubby arms to hug him on the neck when he raised her a bit. And once he had her cuddled comfortably in his arms, the baby elfling girl started to doze off in her father’s arms quickly as if tired on staying awake.</p><p>The elf woman scoffed as she saw this. “<strong><em><b>To think</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>--</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>our little one is already becoming a daddy’s girl</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>“<strong><em><b>And she should be</b></em></strong>!” said the elf man quietly while carefully cradling his now-sleeping elfling girl in his arms. “<strong><em><b>That way I’ll have an easier time with her agreeing with me when the time comes if her soulmate comes calling and I’ll drive him off if it’s not her time yet to be bonded</b></em></strong>!”</p><p>“<strong><em><b>Oh, Jameson Potter, you--! Don’t start being an overprotective father already, even though it hasn’t been long since little Hariana has been born and has just gotten her soulmate mark</b></em></strong>.” the elf woman scolded him firmly.</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil watched this amused while at the same time, wondering about the strange name the male elf has.</b> </strong>
</p><p>The elf man named Jameson protested. “<strong><em><b>I have every right to be overprotective! She’s too young to be dealing with whoever is going to be paired with her</b></em></strong>!”</p><p>“<strong><em><b>Even so</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>, </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>I’m sure that whoever is Hari’s soulmate--he would understand and give her time until she is old enough to make her own choices</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>“<strong><em><b>But Lily</b></em></strong>…” he whined that is unbecoming and unusual for the male elf.</p><p>The elf woman named Lily gave a stern look at her husband who is also her soulmate pair. “<strong><em><b>No buts, James.  We’ll let our daughter grow up and be independent of whatever decisions she makes and we will not interfere in the matter when it concerns her pair.  So--no arguments, understood</b></em></strong>?”</p><p>Jameson the male elf seemed to realize that with begrudging defeat and he nodded to her. “<strong><em><b>Yes, love</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>Lily gave a satisfied look to her pair and then embraced him with arms around his waist while nuzzling her face against her sleeping elfling’s cheek and the elfling girl shuffled a little before turning her face to nuzzle against her father’s chest, which made both the elf couple chuckle at the sight.</p><p><strong><b>Thranduil smiled and seemed to be honored and blessed to witness such a loving moment of the sight of this family of elves.  He wondered whose elven family of his soulmate seemed to be connected to, as he did not recognize them.  But before he could ponder and think about whether he might have seen them in Elrond or Galadriel’s kingdom realms, he heard a sudden noise that came from outside and instantly the elf couple stiffened and was alarmed upon hearing it</b></strong>.</p><p>The elf man James narrowed suspiciously before he transferred his elfling girl to his wife’s. “<strong><em><b>Lily, get up there into the room and lock yourself and Hari in.  I’ll check it out.  Don’t come out until I give out a shout, alright</b></em></strong>?”</p><p>Lily nodded as she took her elfling into her arms, her frame shivering as if fearing whatever is out there. “<strong><em><b>Please be careful, my love</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>James smiled bravely as if she said a stupid thing to him. “<strong><em><b>You know that I’m always careful</b></em></strong>.” then his face went serious as if he’s also a warrior elf. “<strong><em><b>Now go</b></em></strong>!”</p><p>Lily nodded again and hurriedly move in swift silent feet as she runs upstairs with her sleepy elfling in her arms.</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil watched this with narrowed guarded eyes as if these two seemed prepared that an unknown enemy would be invading into their home and harm their elfling.  However, it puzzled him when he watched the father magically glamour his ears into human-shape ones and then he was bringing out and brandishing a stick on his hand from his traveling robes while his other one reached into a closet and brought out his elvish sword.</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong><b>Thranduil followed after the father as he went out into the entrance of his home and he looked around with his keen elf eyes before he shouts out into the darkness in the common Westron language that the Elven king became more confused on why the elf is speaking that language </b></strong><strong><b>like</b></strong><strong><b> he’s been used to it for so long</b></strong><strong><b>, even it looked to be that the male elf is native to the elven kin</b></strong>.</p><p>“Whoever you are--come out now!” the elf man shouted out to the shadows bravely, brandishing his weird stick and sword out to what unknown enemy is out there.</p><p><strong><b>Thranduil wondered about who or what the enemy is, but then he became tenser and on guard when the shadows almost near to the elf man’s feet seemed to move in an eerie manner before a figure started forming into a human-shape being and then come out into the light from the lamp post beside the gate of the elf man’s home</b></strong>.</p><p>The elf man instantly tensed as if recognizing him and the dark-looking black-robed figure raised his hooded head and rasped softly. “James Potter…I’ve come for your child--!”</p><p>Suddenly, as swift like lightning, the dark-robed figure’s words were cut off when the elf man swished the air with the stick like it’s a sword itself and a ray of magic flew right at the shadowy hooded being and it hit him and blew him back into the darkness, then the elf man quickly shouted out loud towards the top floor of the cottage house where his wife and elfling is. “<strong><em><b>LILY! GO RUN! IT’S HIM! I’LL HOLD HIM OFF! RUN NOW</b></em></strong>!”</p><p>Then James the elf man faced the dark being again as it emerged from the shadows once more and this time he seemed to be radiating with fury at his unexpected attack and he was also bringing out the same kind of stick that James held.</p><p>Before the elf man was about to strike out another magic spell against him, the dark figure attacked first with a sharp hiss. ‘<em>AVADA KEDAVRA</em>!’</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil was shocked as he watched the scene of the elf man using an unfamiliar kind of magic and he wondered how it is possible for an elf such as this one to be also an Istari like he had seen and witnessed among those that are in Arda, except they use wands instead of staffs.  But then he became more horrified when the dark-being that is some kind of dark Istari, had killed the elf man with a monstrous dark magic spell with his wand, and it instantly killed the elf as he fell like a puppet with its strings cut.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He was shocked at this as he stared down at the dead elf father and then he remembered much to his horror and fear that the dark-robed figure had said before that he’s after the elf man’s child. </b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The monster is after his soulmate!</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong> <b>Thranduil growled inhumanely and he lunged at the robed dark one and tried to attack him, but he couldn’t because he went pass through him like he’s a ghost.  He cursed to himself upon remembering instantly that this is a dream.  But he dearly wished</b> </strong> <strong> <b> and prayed to Eru</b> </strong> <strong> <b> that this is not happening right now</b> </strong> <strong> <b>. H</b> </strong> <strong> <b>e had waited for many millennia for his soulmate</b> </strong> <strong> <b>--</b> </strong> <strong> <b>he will not have some dark Istari take his pair’s life from him </b> </strong> <strong> <b>right in front of his very eyes and </b> </strong> <strong> <b>over his dead body!</b> </strong></p><p>
  <strong> <b>He ran after the dark figure as it prowled and ran up the stairs like a panther hunting its prey.  But then Thranduil was forced to watch helplessly as he saw the black figure had burst into the room where his soulmate and her mother is locked inside with magic and the dark Istari was sneering evilly at them with his stick-like wand out pointing at them.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>However, Thranduil became instantly relieved that when the dark Istari had struck the same spell that killed the elf father before and once it flew and struck the female elf, both the beings of the elf mother and the elfling disappeared right before their very eyes as if they were a magic illusion.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The dark figure seemed to have instantly realized this and he was hissing and howling with fury while Thranduil looked out the windows above the floor of the house to see if his soulmate and her mother are outside or not.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The Elvenking was relieved completely when he saw the elf mother running into the forest, dressed in dark hooded robes with her elfling girl clutched tightly in her arms. And she seemed to be carrying something on her back, but Thranduil knew that this is not the time and place to think about it for he has to follow them first and find out where they’re going, right before the dark figure might figure out where they’re heading next.</b> </strong>
</p><p><strong><b>It didn’t take long for him to catch up with the elf mother and his elfling soulmate when they had run deeper into the darkness of the forests, and then he saw, much to his confusion and puzzlement that his soulmate, Hari’s mother was placing her baby elfling into a large baby bed-like basket and was placing it gently on the earthy ground at the edge nearby the fast-flowing river with her elfling already inside it</b></strong>.</p><p>The elfling must have woken up during the commotion before or from her mother running into the forest with her in her arms, and the elfling girl Hari was cooing in confusion at her mother when she placed her lying inside her bed basket that is by the edge near the river and beside the forest.</p><p>Her mother shushed her while comforting her at the same time as she had sudden tears shining in her sad eyes. “<strong><em><b>Ssh, ssh…it’s okay, now little one.  Mommy is going to send you away to a safe place now.  I promise you that it’s a place that will keep you safe from the very bad Istari that lives here in this world</b></em></strong>.” her elf mother Lily reassured her elfling and looked like she seems to be prepared for her death.</p><p>Her elfling daughter seems to sense this and whimpered a little as if asking her mommy not to leave her alone.</p><p>This made the elf mother sob a little as if she understood what her elfling is saying and shook her head before placing what is to be the last kiss to her elfling’s fuzzy head. “<strong><em><b>I am so sorry.  I would come with you if I could.  But I can’t--I have to make the dark evil monster go away so that he wouldn’t get to you.  But don’t worry</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>, </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>my owl familiar will take care of you and guard you until she finds someone like us to take care of you and keep you safe, protected and away from all the bad Istari that wants you for evil means</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>Lily the female elf sniffled a little before she nuzzles her lips to the cheek of her daughter tenderly and whispered. “<strong><em><b>Always remember that your mother and father love you very much</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>, </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>and soon once you grow older in the future--your soulmate will protect you and love you as well.  Goodbye…my dear little one</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>The elfling whimpered and tried to cry out but her mother closed the lid of the basket over her and then she brought out her wand and cast some sort of sleeping spell on it to make her elfling instantly fall asleep peacefully and silently from her magic.</p><p>Lily took a deep breath and wiped away her tears, then she turned her head up and shouted aloud to the night starry skies above her. “Athena!”</p><p><strong><b>At first, Thranduil thought that the elf mother of his soulmate was about to place the enchanted magic basket into the river, for he thought that it’s a foolish idea as the river current is too fast and dangerous for his soulmate to be on.  But then he watched the elf woman Lily call out for someone or something and then he turned his head when he heard a shrill cry coming from a bird and he saw a large-size snowy white owl swooping down to the elf woman’s side as if she is a dear animal friend to her.  The Elven king watches silently as the elf woman Lily spoke softly to her unusually big owl friend</b></strong>.</p><p>Lily sniffed a little as she spoke sadly to her owl familiar. “<strong><em><b>I trust you to look after my little one, Athena.  Protect her and keep her safe.  And if ever possible that you find another one of my kind--entrust my daughter to </b></em></strong><strong><em><b>their</b></em></strong><strong><em><b> care, but stay by her side and guard her</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>The snowy owl hooted lightly before it flapped its wings as if asking ‘What about you?’ to the elf woman Lily.</p><p>Lily shook her head negatively sadly again. “<strong><em><b>I won’t be going with you.  I need to hold off the enemy that’s coming for little Hari</b></em></strong>.” she stopped her owl familiar when it started hopping in protest and said to it sternly. “<strong><em><b>Athena! Please promise me you’ll do this.  Just stay by her side--and the day that you might pass on, let your descendants take the task to look after my daughter.  Please promise me</b></em></strong>!”</p><p>The owl named Athena wanted to protest more but then it slumped relenting with defeat and nodded its bird head in acceptance of her pleading request.</p><p>Lily gave a relieved sigh before she looks at the closed basket sadly once more and then stood up and backed away from it as the snowy owl Athena hopped and flapped its wings to fly over the basket and then grasped the basket handles tightly and carefully with its big talons.</p><p>It took about a few more strong flapping of its wings before Athena the snowy owl had lifted up and gracefully flew away with its cargo, as Lily watched them fly away with sadness and relief on her face.  She whispered as the owl and the basket it’s carrying is now a speck distance away. “<strong><em><b>Goodbye, my little love</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>Then she squared herself as if preparing for battle and then turned around to face her foe who seems to be approaching near her from the shadows of the dark forests.</p><p><strong><b>Thranduil looked like he wanted to follow after his soulmate who is being carried and flown away by the snowy owl, but he stayed behind a little to see the battle between the brave elf mother and the dark being that is coming out from the shadows and approaching near her furiously</b></strong>.</p><p>The black-robed hooded figure hissed at her. “Where is the child?!”</p><p>The elf woman Lily rose her head haughtily at him and said calmly. “My daughter is long gone.  And you will never find her--not over my dead body!” her green eyes seem to glow beneath her red hair bangs.</p><p>Her words seem to enrage the dark being once more but then Lily struck first as she cast magic spells with her wand, trying to blast away the enemy but the dark enemy seems to have prepared himself and expected the attacks as he dodged them, then just before he was about to strike with his own dark magic, Lily acted swiftly by bringing out a longbow and quiver of arrows that appeared out of thin air and then notched an arrow quickly and shoots it, letting it fly right at the dark shadow who was slight stunned.</p><p>The dark being managed to dodge, but he didn’t anticipate another arrow that was already shot from Lily and it struck him right at his shoulder.  The robed hooded one cried out in pain and clutched his shoulder before it sends off furious glares of his red snake-like eyes towards the elf woman Lily.</p><p>She was calm and courageous as she continued shooting arrow after arrow from her bow until her quiver ran out of its contents. Just as she had run out empty and the dark enemy tried to take another opportunity to strike her down, she got out her wand again and slashed at the air, striking continuous spells at him without stopping.</p><p>Unfortunately, this only made the dark wizard angrier and he instantly hissed out. ‘<em>SECTUSEMPRA</em>!’</p><p>Lily cried out as dark magical cuts appeared all over her body and she tried to keep up standing straight but couldn’t as she fell on the ground, bleeding uncontrollably from all of her sliced open wounds.</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil cried out, “NO!” as he watched this and then he glared at the dark enemy who chuckled evilly and then walked over to loom over the fallen elf mother who’s slowly dying on the ground.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Oh, how he wished that this wasn’t a dream and that he wouldn’t hesitate to cut the dark monster down with his two swords.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Just as he watched the evil monster about to raise his wand and was about to cast the killing spell that had killed the female elf’s pair, Lily suddenly grabbed him by the wrists and held him tight without letting him go and then she started chanting something in what sounded like an ancient elven language and the dark being seem to recoil back in fear and tried to break free from her hold, but somehow the dying elf woman still had the superior strength to hold on.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Then as the sun rises to shine upon a new day, Lily’s magic chanting ended and right before the Elven king’s very eyes, the dark figure seemed to scream out in agony and then exploded into a fading mist like the sunlight was its weakness, but in reality, something from Lily’s magic chant has destroyed the evil Istari monster from within just as the daylight had loomed over her and the black shadowy being.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Just as Thranduil watched the monster disappear into nothingness, he spat on the ground and cursed to the emptiness before him. “Good riddance.”</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Then he kneels next to the dead body of his soulmate’s mother and despite that he knows that he doesn’t have a corporeal body, he tenderly stroked her head as if giving her respect. “Your death will not be in vain.  I will find your daughter and protect her with my very life, for she is my soulmate as I am hers.  That I promise you, oh brave one.”</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>After he paid his respects, he stood up and turned around, going to the direction where he had seen the snowy owl fly away with his soulmate.  But just before he could, he seems to hear a raspy whisper behind him.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He swiftly turned around, and his eyes widened in shock and horror when he saw that somehow the dark Istari monster seem to be forming his body back and returning into the living realm, but in a ghostly phantom shadowy figure.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He stared at it as it floated above the elf mother’s dead body for a silent horrifying moment before it gives out an angry hissing screech and then swoops away like a fog into the darkness of the forest as if trying to get away from the daylight.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Thranduil stood there stunned terrified before he turned around and broke into a run as if he thought that the ghost-like dark being is going to be after his soulmate now, even with a phantom-phasing body.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He didn’t stop running even if he might grow feeling tired, despite that he knows that this is just dream-sharing with his soulmate, and he didn’t stop not for one time for a short break until he caught sight of the snowy owl he was searching for.  He followed after it as fast as he could as a great elf man of his prime would be and then he saw that the owl veered swooping in another direction by the side and turned to chase after it.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>He saw the snowy owl seemed to be aiming to perch on a tall leafless tree and then carefully swooped down in a graceful landing, as it laid the basket on a sturdy branch and then perched itself beside it like a guard bird or something.  Thranduil sighed relieved at the sight, and he gracefully climbed the tree so that he would be beside the baby basket and the owl guarding beside it.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The elf man carefully sat down on the same branch they’re on and wondered what the white owl is planning to do while looking around guardedly for the shadowy phantom that might appear or not.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>Then he tensed when the owl suddenly puffed up in a flurry of feathers and hissed at something threateningly. He zeroed in his sharp eyes and saw that whatever it was the owl that’s named Athena has seen, it was just another owl--an eagle owl, in fact.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The eagle owl tilted its head curiously at the snowy white owl before it hooted at her in greeting but Athena kept up her threatening and warning posture at the other owl as if trying to drive it away from her and her charge on the tree.</b> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <b>The eagle owl tilted its head to the other side before it continued hooting until someone or something rustled behind the trees making the snowy owl glare into the forest and Thranduil tensed and his hand twitched like it’s going for his sword before the elf remembered again that this is a dream.</b> </strong>
</p><p>It didn’t take long for a middle-aged looking woman to come out and brushing off the leaves and dirt from her traveling dress robes and hair when she came out from the thick tall bushes.</p><p>“Oh! Goodness me! Remind me again why do I have to roam around the forest to gather herbs once more?” she muttered to herself as if she’s talking to the eagle owl that seemed to be her animal friend.</p><p>Then the woman blinked when she saw that the eagle owl isn’t alone and she was a bit surprised at seeing the snowy white owl before she nodded to it and smiled. “Why hello there! Fancy seeing a fine one like you around here…what brings you to these parts?”</p><p>The snowy owl hissed at her, fluffing up in a threatening posture before the woman calmly put up her hands to show the owl that she means no harm.</p><p>“Now, now, it’s alright.  I meant no harm when I’m asking you this, oh great lady of the skies.  I was just curious why such a magnificent being like you is here in these kinds of forests since your kind seems to dwell in the snowy mountains and such.” the woman soothed it.</p><p>The owl seemed suspicious of the woman who looked to be living her life inside the misty shadowy forests as it was not pleased or flattered by her words to it.  The snowy owl glared at her meaningfully as if daring her to get to the point already.</p><p>The woman sighed as she somehow knows that the bird doesn’t believe her. “Oh, I guess I’ll have to show you, huh?” with a wave of her wand, the snowy owl’s golden eyes seemed to widen like balls and it hopped excitedly on its perch in the branch when the woman revealed her <em>pointed </em>ears to the bird that was magically glamoured by her, and revealing that she is an elf woman to the owl familiar.</p><p>“There! See? Now that you know that I’m friendly and--OY, NOW! You! Stop that!” the elf woman instantly scolded at the snowy owl who swooped down to perch on her outstretched arm and came near her to peck on her ear as if making sure that she’s really an elf.</p><p>The elf woman reached out her other free hand to stop the owl from about to peck her sensitive elf ears. She snapped it sternly. “I understand that you are dubious as you are since I can tell that you are an elven familiar--but that doesn’t mean you have the right to nibble on my poor ears just to check if I’m actually an elf! Now stop that, or I won’t hesitate to have you for my dinner!”</p><p>The snowy owl hooted again in happiness and it swooped up to pick up the basket on the branch and gently laid it down on the ground before the elf woman’s feet.  She blinked confused at this before she knelt next to it.  The elf woman looked at the snowy owl that perched itself next to the basket and asked. “For me?”</p><p>The owl nodded bobbing its bird head and curiously, the elf woman opened the basket to see what’s inside.</p><p>“Now what on Earth could it be--? <strong><em><b>BY THE GREAT VALAR AND MERLIN HIMSELF</b></em></strong>!” the elf woman instantly cursed the latter words in Elf language as she was stunned shocked and staring wide-eyed at the baby elfling girl in the basket who woke up instantly when the sleeping magic spell wore off and started to whimper inside on seeing that she’s in unknown territory and that there are strangers around her.</p><p>The elf woman snapped out of her stunned stupor when she saw that the elfling is about to cry and then scooped her up into her arms, cradling her gently as she stood to her feet, as the elfling seemed to be frightened even more when little Hari seems to realize that this stranger is holding her.</p><p>However, the elfling Hari became soothed and comforted lovingly when the elf woman reassured her in a maternal loving voice. “<strong><em><b>There, there, little one.  It’s alright, you’re safe now.  There’s nothing to worry about, little one.  You’re in my care now</b></em></strong>.”</p><p>The elf woman was a bit relieved that it worked as Hari started to snooze again against her chest and cuddled to her comfortably while she turned to the snowy owl with a knowing sad look on her face. “Her parents?”</p><p>The snowy owl hooted sadly and drooped its head down to show the elf woman that the elfling’s parents are gone.  The elf woman sighed but she smiled down at her new charge in her arms, sleeping again contentedly.</p><p>“<strong><em><b>Don’t you worry, little one.  I will guard and protect you from now on, and I will care for you and love you as you were my own</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>. T</b></em></strong><strong><em><b>here’s nothing out there that will come to harm you since I--Adriana Evergreen--have you now…little Hari</b></em></strong>.” the elf woman said in a promising tone of voice that shows her determination that she will keep to her vow and take care of the elfling baby girl in her arms for the rest of her immortal life in the future.  It wasn’t hard for the elf woman named Adriana Evergreen to know the elfling’s name because the edges of her baby blanket are stitched with her name of Hariana Potter before, but now that the elfling girl is in the elf woman’s care.  She will now be known as Hari/Hariana Evergreen.</p><p>OOOOO</p><p>Thranduil was relieved that another elf will be taking care and looking after his soulmate.  He wondered who this elf woman is and where she comes from and where she lives, for he does not recognize her nor does he realize any familiarity about her. He will have to ask his elven friends from Lord Elrond of Rivendell and Lady Galadriel of Lothlorien once the messengers had sent out word to them about him having his soulmate mark and they will come to visit him to congratulate him. Still, he watched with relief as the elf woman gently carried his elfling soulmate to wherever she is living in, with the two birds following after her in flight, both the snowy white owl and the eagle owl.</p><p>He wanted to follow after them so that he will note what kind of forest landmark the elf woman and his soulmate pair are staying and living in, but then he realized that the surroundings around him seem to fade and it didn’t take long for him to realize that he’s being awakened from his dream-sharing.</p><p>He wanted to stay longer but he knew it was inevitable so he surrendered as the surroundings faded out and then his eyes blinked open to see the brightness of the morning sun greeted him through the windows of his bedroom.</p><p>He sat up gingerly and realized that he felt no pain from his burn scars while he was deep asleep in the dream-sharing.  He realized that there and then once he had his soulmate mark at long last and then he was in his pair’s dreams, being connected to his soulmate has somehow dulled the painful agony he had suffered from the burn scars he had been inflicted from the cursed dragon long ago.</p><p>But he could still feel the slight twinges of dark magic that is attached with the burn scars on his face and part of his body, and he twitched a little as he endured the sudden rising painful stinging from them.</p><p>With a renewed sense of strength and determination on finding about his soulmate and the foreboding danger she is in, even though he knew that she’s under protective care of her new guardian, Thranduil quickly dressed himself in his royal robes and was in a hurry to get to the messengers to also send out word post-haste for his friends Lord Elrond and Lady Galadriel to hurry and visit him, for he wanted to know where his soulmate is and who her new elven caretaker is.  He also need to add into the messages that they must somehow find and bring Gandalf/Mithrandir with them as well, for he wants to know if the Grey wizard might have any knowledge on the kind of unusual new magic he had witnessed, including about the dark monstrous Istari that is roaming around in spiritual phantom form that is a threat to his soulmate.</p><p>It almost surprised the elf messengers who were about to be ready to go off and send the messages to the other elven kingdoms and then they were stopped for a moment before they left when their Elven king approached them and added more into the letters.</p><p>After King Thranduil has finished, he watched up high above the balcony of the royal palace of his kingdom and saw the messengers ride off into different directions to the other elf kingdoms.  He wondered how long he’ll have to wait for the others to arrive and come visit him once they got the word that he has his soulmate and had found her, for he is anxious and excited about his newborn soulmate and wondered about what she will be like when she grows older in the future.</p><p>However, what the Elven King Thranduil didn’t know--including the whole of Arda or Middle Earth…it’s that the elf king’s soulmate pair is not in the place that he would have expected to be there.</p><p>For by the next night that he will sleep and go through another Dream-sharing with his pair, he will find out the astonishing truth that his soulmate who is named Hariana Evergreen or Hari--she is born and living in <em>another world</em>.</p><p>OOOOO</p><p>OOOOO</p><p>AUTHOR’S NOTES:</p><p>This is the first chapter of this new story I’m also working on! I hope you like it!</p><p>I became inspired to writing this story when I read some of the fan-fiction stories about Harry/Thranduil pairings in them.  They’re all good stories, and it gave me a sudden idea and inspiration about Harry being an elf--a female elf to be exact--and then whatever I was thinking and imagining about the story in my mind like a flash of a lightning bolt.</p><p>By the time I got that kind of idea and images running inside my head, I had to suddenly write this story and post it for all readers to have and read!</p><p>Anyway, there will be more chapters and updates soon, I promise!</p><p>Hope you like it!
