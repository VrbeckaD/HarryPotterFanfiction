    <u>AN</u>
  </strong>
  <strong>:  This drabble includes a three-year-old Draco Malfoy having fun with his father. </strong>
</p>
<p>            “Again, Daddy!  Again!”  Little Draco shrieked as his father swung him up off the ground one more time before gently setting him on his feet.</p>
<p>            “More, Daddy, more!”  The youngest Malfoy was already a picture of pureblood arrogance, at least as much as he could be as a toddler, as he demanded in no uncertain terms just what he wanted.</p>
<p>            Lucius Malfoy didn’t mind all that much.  Like father, like son, after all.  This time, Lucius caught Draco up around his middle, tilting him forward. </p>
<p>            He whispered in his son’s tiny ear, “Put your arms out, Little Dragon, and I’ll fly you around like a real dragon.”</p>
<p>            Draco laughed delightedly as he did what his father said, arms spread wide like the wings of the dragons that so fascinated him in his picture books and toys.  In his books and his play, he watched the amazing creatures fly high through the air as he so wanted to do.  But he was still too young and too small for the smallest training broom, and Narcissa had thrown a fit at the thought of risking her son on a broom by himself before he even turned four.</p>
<p>            Of course, Lucius had the smallest training broom tucked away for a Yule gift, but Narcissa did not need to know that.  And in the meantime, Lucius gave his son the wings he craved…at least from the viewpoint of a three-year-old. </p>
<p>            Robeless, wearing only trousers and a shirt, Lucius ran through the garden with Draco who was screaming for joy in his careful hold.  If anyone had asked him, Lucius would have admitted that he felt (and knew that he looked) ridiculous.  Being ridiculous was not a Malfoy trait.  However, even Malfoys would admit to occasionally indulging such silliness, especially when it came to one’s pureblood heir who could whine with the best of them but was such a master of the soulful, pleading eyes and pouting lips that even the powerful, self-possessed Lord Malfoy could not resist him.</p>
<p>            And no one was there to see them anyway.  So Lucius gave his son wings, and Draco flew without a broom, willing to be brave enough to let go only because he knew that his father would not let him fall.</p></div>
