    <p>Her eyes were always alive, they were a glimpse into a beautiful alternate world where opposite elements danced in harmony. When she looked at him Newt swore he could drown in the wet flames. Two months ago he had gotten down on his knee and asked if she was willing to spend the rest of her life beside him. They cried in joy together with both pairs of eyes fixed on the simple ring he placed on her finger.</p>
<p>At the moment though Tina's eyes were closed against the artificial sun that lit Newt's basement. They sat together next to the kelpies lake, his back against the wall and Tina's against Newt's chest. She leaned her head back against his shoulder and basked in the simple beauty of a peaceful moment in Newt's arms. Her eyes opened to look up at him smiling down at her and both of them were lost in the love on the others face. He kissed Tina's forehead and muttered something that she couldn't quite hear. She unlaced her fingers from his to pull Newts lips down to meet her own. It was a lazy kiss, slow and long. It could've gone on for 12 days or 12 seconds and Tina wouldn't know the difference. By the time they pulled back to breathe Tina was straddling Newts thigh. His thumbs stroked gently on her waist, one of hers was tangled in his hair.</p>
<p>He rested his forehead against Tina's. Her other hand was idley rolling the first button of his shirt between her finger tips, Newt covered it with his own. He kissed her again briefly.<br/>
“I love you, Tina Goldstein.” He whispered against her lips.<br/>
She smiled and fell forward onto his shoulder. “Three more weeks and I'll be Tina Scamander…” He could feel her smile as her breath tickled his neck.<br/>
“You don't want to back out, then?” He chuckled as he wrapped his arms around her tightly. She shook her head as best she could, her fingers toying with with the button again.<br/>
“You're not going to get rid of me that easy, Mr. Scamander.”<br/>
“I would never try… sometimes I can hardly believe I hav- that you want me in the first place.” He said in a voice that lost humor as the sentence ended.<br/>
Tina's heart squeezed around her throat.</p>
<p> Newt was a strong man and confident in all his actions but his experiences had taught him that other people often looked at him with doubt and annoyance. Those people were utterly and completely blind to his beauty and brilliance and Tina would never understand. She nuzzled against his neck, kissing the pulse point.<br/>
“You are everything that I want Newt. My best friend, my soulmate, my partner in every fight. I love you. Why on earth would I not want you?”<br/>
“I… I've been wanting to- no. I love you too, darling. But. But-” he sighed.<br/>
Tina sat back and looked him in the eye. His heart nearly stopped in her intensity. He tried to drop his gaze but she immediately brought her hand to his face to make him look at her.<br/>
“What's wrong Newt? If its the wedding, we can al-”<br/>
“No. No its not- I want to marry you Tina. Of course I do. It's just, I’m… worried. About our wedding night…” he blushed then and she couldn't help but laugh.<br/>
“Oh. Well if it's about… I'm sure we can figure it out together.” Now she was blushing too. They both smile meekly at the thought of the long awaited night.<br/>
Newt coughed.<br/>
“Um, yes, I'm not so worried about that. I'm fairly confident I have a grasp on how to… to…” he coughed again. “It's just I've been wanting to, um, warn you about something.”<br/>
Tina stiffened unintentionally.<br/>
“Its not- its-I just want to, I think I should rather, my body… I have a lot of scars, you know. With the dragons in the War, and a lot of beasts… the scratches don't always heal cleanly. I don't want it to scare you, or put you off. I wish I was more handsome for you Tina but I can't fix most of them.” He said in a rush.<br/>
Tina's hand still on his chest laid flat over his heart, the other stroked the scruff on his jaw. </p>
<p>“I have absolutely no doubt that I will enjoy seeing you shirtless with or without scars.” She quipped.<br/>
Newt smiled half heartedly as his ears turned bright red.<br/>
“It's not just my torso… there's one on my thigh, its particularly nasty. Its- there's a lot of them.” He wasn't meeting her eye anymore.<br/>
It hurt her how much this bothered him. How he was worried it would bother her. It was like Newt hadn't considered she might have scars too. He didn't know the stories her skin held, the wounds that would never fade and the marks she would never let herself erase.<br/>
She kissed his lips sweetly, reveling in the security of his love.<br/>
“Newt… you're not the only one with scars I have more than I can count.”<br/>
“Mine are-”<br/>
“Hush. Your scars are part of your story. They're from work that you're proud to do. I wouldn't care if you were missing limbs, I'm going to marry you and love you forever. I will have you regardless of your scars… as long as you have me regardless of mine.”<br/>
“Tina… love… of course.”<br/>
“I'm not proud of some of mine. Most scars show the strength of the person, not all of mine do...” She whispered in the smallest voice he'd heard from her since just after Paris.<br/>
There was a moment of quiet before she spoke again.<br/>
“You're worried about a scar on your thigh? How did you get it?”<br/>
“Hungarian hornback in the war. Both sides used dragons as weapons, we used them like bombs to clear trenches… they did the same but they had jinxed them somehow, the burns didn't heal without help and even then the magic did nothing for the scars. After mine almost killed me Theseus invented a shield charm to protect our troops proactively.”<br/>
“Im sorry Newt.”<br/>
“It got me home. To a desk job where I could fight to stop using innocent creatures like that. And before quite recently I didn't worry about how ugly it looked, not until I realized someone could love me enough to get close to it.”<br/>
“My thigh is scarred too.” She whispered dropping her eyes.<br/>
She focused on the button of his shirt again and started picking at the stitches. He let her continue at her own pace, it was clear to him that this was going to be difficult for her. In the silence he moved his hands down her waist so that his thumbs could rub circles on the outside of her thighs. It was an intimate spot and he hoped it was comforting more than it was inappropriate.<br/>
“When my parents died it wasn't easy on us. We were alone and still in school. I was broken  but I needed to be solid and take care of my sister. I didn't get the time to stop and mourn them properly. We stayed at the school most of the year. Then the War broke out and Ilvermorny was constantly crowded. I was scared and sad and being crushed by the weight of my future. I was… Newt I'm not proud of that time in my life, it taught me a lot but it cost even more.”<br/>
She let out a shaky breath.<br/>
“The scars on my leg. Twenty-four.  It was me. I- a razor blade. I don't know why really, not for years. It never happened again after the start of my 7th year. I have other scars, I'm an auror after all. But those...You might hate your scars but I love you and nothing will change that. No blemish would would scare me away Newt, if nothing else because I understand.”<br/>
Newt wiped the tears from her eyes, ignoring the one that dripped from his chin.<br/>
“Tina-”<br/>
She shook her head.<br/>
With a hand on each cheek he made her look at him.He kissed her forehead, her cheeks,her nose. She sighed when his lips brushed against her eyelids.<br/>
Her eyes stayed closed as he whispered reassurance to her.<br/>
“We don't need to talk about it now, one day maybe, but not right now. If you never want to tell me more, then I won't ask you to. Tina, I will never think any less of you for any reason. You are the bravest, strongest, most caring person I have ever met. You say my scars will never scare you away, I make the same promise to you. I will be next to you for as long as you'll have me.” </p>
<p>Tina's forehead rested against his. She hoped her thoughts and feelings might somehow defuse from her brain straight into his. That she might convey her pain, both from the shame of her past and from the beautiful crushing weight of his words. Her hand fisted in his shirt when Newt's lips found hers in an urgent kiss. Her hand got tighter and tighter until suddenly she felt the button rip. Newt chuckled into her mouth before pulling back and taking the button out of her hand. She smiled at him, her blush substituting an apology.<br/>
“Just because you have 'absolutely no doubt’ you'll enjoy me shirtless doesn't make it acceptable to rip my buttons off.”<br/>
Tina hit his shoulder playfully.<br/>
Newt put the button in his breast pocket before lightly pushing her from his lap so they could stand.<br/>
“I'll fix it later. Right now I think it's about time for something to eat?”<br/>
She took his hand and lead them up the stairs for dinner.</p>
