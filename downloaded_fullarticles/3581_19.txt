    <p>In the summer following his first year at Hogwarts, Draco became more familiar with the woods behind his manor - meaning he was no longer afraid to look out the white gallery windows during the daytime. He also spent a lot of time studying, when he was not in the mood to practice Occlumency against his own parents or chat with one of Owen's many portraits. The rest of his time was spent in solitude, pursuing Snape’s poem, dancing, or chasing after puny birds on his broom. True to the vow he'd made at the leaving feast, Draco planned to do everything he could to make Harry Potter’s life a living hell which, of course, included keeping Potter alive and beating him at every quidditch match in the next six years.</p><p>
However, Draco could not practice flying <i>too</i> much . . . Jean, the best private dance instructor the Wizarding World had ever seen, just wouldn’t have it. Quidditch required a lot of intensive muscle, you see, whereas ballet required a body full of limber ones. Trying to develop both at once was nearly impossible, and ballet was painful enough, thank you very much. Draco wasn’t about to harm his own body over  Harry bloody Potter. Neither had he even considered quitting ballet, not when he could finally wear his pointe slippers for twenty minutes of each lesson. </p><p>
The first time Draco had lunch with his parents upon his return, his mother had paused him mid-bite by asking him how he’d liked his birthday presents.</p><p>
“I thought . . .” drawled Draco, slowly, “we decided to postpone my party until I was home.”</p><p>
“Of course,” his father had given him an odd look. “But did you really believe your mother would not send a little something for you?”</p><p>
Draco had only blinked. He had been unconscious for his birthday, he’d realized this on the train when Pansy asked him if he’d truly enjoyed her present. </p><p>
Although, to Draco’s knowledge, he had no new items. Em had probably stolen them, Draco had figured. Or ate all of it. The bastard was turning out like a younger version of Snape or something. Draco had not liked this revelation one bit. </p>
<p>
“It was lovely,” he’d replied with a soft smile in her direction, completely dishonest and hating it. “Delightful truly.”</p>
<p>
“Well . . .” his mother’s smile had been just as little. “I am glad you liked them, my dear.”</p>
<p>
“And now that you are home,” his father had added. “We can begin to plan your <i>real</i> party. I was thinking charmed-purple peacocks, an ice-sculpture or two, and flaming duck. I know how you love duck--”</p><p>
“I want my own recital,” Draco had blurted and then snapped his mouth shut.</p><p>
His father had frowned at him for a bit too long, but replied, “You know I will make that happen, son.”</p><p>
Draco had smiled, and suddenly missing his actual birthday hadn’t seemed so bad. He’d proceeded to smile as he’d finish his meal, and the attribute had stayed until he fell asleep much later.</p><p>
A few days into his summer, Draco stumbled upon a room in his manor which he'd never seen before. Malfoy Manor was ginormous, and Draco had steadily accepted the fact that he may never really know everything about his own home, fluid as it was. If you asked Draco, it was still better than Hogwarts, and he also had a map of the manor which he added to every time something new popped up to remind of where not to lurk. Draco believed this particular room he found to be one of his ancestor’s secret chambers, thinking it looked a lot like one of his father’s but greyer. He also thought that he’d visited <i>all</i> of his parent’s secret rooms. His mother had secret cabinets in the west wing and his father had two hidden galleries in the north wing and some smaller chambers scattered throughout.</p><p>
Draco should have known better. </p><p>
Since Draco had yet to return to a man of leisure, he found himself extremely bored at this point in the summer, and the room seemed non-threatening so he spared some of his time to have a look inside. Draco didn’t understand why but the next day he went back, even knowing he risked his father’s wrath. The day after that, Draco was in the room tearing through drawers like a mad wizard and found an alluring journal . He decided to take it because he admired the vintage binding and had a random notion to start his own Hogwarts journal this year. Draco supposed maybe one day he could give it to his own child. Which was weird, considering he had never thought of having his own kids. </p><p>
Four days later, when Draco was writing in the garden, his father approached but froze for a long moment and scrutinized the journal in Draco’s hands. The look on his father's face was more than enough to snap Draco out of whatever stupor he’d been in and alert him to the enormous size of his own cock up. </p><p>
Wide eyed, Draco instantly stood, threw the journal to the ground and, with a horrified huff, began to wipe his hands on the damp grass. "What have I done?" he shrieked, hoping he wasn’t about to die slow and horribly.</p><p>
His father blinked, face returning to a calm mask, but his father was never too good at guarding his eyes . . . or so Draco’s mother had always said, and Draco was starting to understand what she meant. Snapping out his wand, Draco’s father banished the journal to somewhere else before taking a deep breath and pulling Draco into a tight hug. Draco was speechless and tense with confusion and didn't hug back, but his father didn't seem to care. When Draco finally worked out that he wasn't about to get his arse stung for the next three weeks straight, he weakly returned his father's embrace. </p><p>
It felt so odd for some reason, and Draco was soon distracted trying to remember the last time he'd hugged his father. He knew he had before yet couldn't remember the last time. Before he'd even noticed that time had passed his father had pulled away and studied Draco's face with serious eyes. </p><p>
"Draco." His father’s quiet voice sounded broken for some reason.</p><p>
"Yes, father?"</p><p>
His father only sighed and guided Draco back on the bench. They sat in silence for a moment before his father broke it. </p><p>
"Draco, do you remember that time you knocked your two front teeth out and we had to . . . lie to your mother about what had happened?"</p><p>
As the seriousness of this conversation overcame him, Draco widened his eyes but nodded, because he did remember. He would never forget that awful night, or the only horrible lie he had ever told his mother. Draco’s father had been worried his mother would leave him if she ever found out how that had happened. Draco had thought his father was being ridiculous but agreed nonetheless because his father certainly knew her better than Draco did. </p><p>
"This. This is worse than that, son, we can never let her find out about this or she may very well kill me." There was not a thing in his father's voice besides pure sincerity and this tone always sent a chill down Draco's spine. Surely his mother wouldn't . . ? <i>Couldn’t</i> . . ? His father continued a moment later. "If she did not . . . I still fear you and I would never speak again."</p><p>
“She couldn’t . . . <i>surely</i>?”</p><p>
“Not legally, no.”</p><p>
"You are serious?" </p><p>
His father nodded sharply. </p><p>
"I will never let her find out," Draco promised.</p><p>
His father eyed him for a moment. "No, I suppose you would not," he said at last, and continued to stare strangely at Draco. </p><p>
"Never let me find out what?" </p><p>
His mother's cold voice announced her arrival. The flowers died as she approached them, but they always did that. </p><p>
"Nothing, dear." His father smiled, and Draco copied him. “If Draco wanted to talk to you about it, he would have.”</p><p>
Two days later Draco started to think someone (most-likely suspect being his father) had slipped him some Felix Felicis when his mother still hadn't confronted him about it. Draco shook his head to clear it of those thoughts, smoothed out the parchment before him and got back to work. </p><p>
<i>My color is red like blood</i></p><p>
<i>I taste like what grows out of mud</i></p><p>
<i>Once I am complete</i></p><p>
<i>Is known the next feat</i></p><p>
<i>Scales and snails</i></p><p>
<i>Give no tales</i></p><p>
<i>So do I?</i></p><p>
The third day found Draco still beating down his own nervous energy with Snape’s poem, though he knew he was closer than ever to solving it. Draco was sitting on a stool reading over the words for the thousandth time when he decided to give up and turn to his mother’s methods. It was not guilt making him do it, either.</p><p>
Draco had finally had a breakthrough with the potion from Snape’s game the day prior - he’d narrowed the key down to three potions. They all glowed green before the last ingredient was added then turned blood red, and none of them had any kind of fish or insect ingredients, though all were made with many natural ingredients that would give the potion an earthy taste. </p><p>
He’d spent the past three days tucked away in his potions lab - his “play” room had been easily cleaned out and converted. After he and Linky dumped all his old junk in one of the endless closets, that was. Besides Bear. </p><p>
Bear, Draco’s darling, plush little bear, would always be welcomed. He could admit to needing the company, because Linky was terrible to have around while working on potions. Bear was very quiet and always still when Draco was working . . . and work did he. Draco slaved for hours at a time (sometimes). Many of those hours were spent reading. Draco felt as if he’d read so many different potion texts he would piss out ingredients. Still, he was <i>not</i> guilty, he was just a <i>little</i> nervous his mother would discover their secret.</p><p>
Draco’s first plan had been to mimic the potion. He’d looked up all potions that glowed green during brewing which he could find. Then Draco narrowed the results down by eliminating those which lost luminescence or potential after left sitting for too long. His potion was still loud and bright months later. </p><p>
This narrowed his choices down greatly and Draco decided maybe the name of the potion was a pun or something, but the closest he could come up with was "Nimble Sole" which required an ingredient named “essence of lead.” Draco then was scared to try any of the three replicas he’d brewed, because it was just like his godfather to make the box self-destructible upon one failure. </p><p>
It was time to consult the leaves, Draco told himself again, and tried to ignore the pull in his gut when he thought of his mother. He grimaced but began to ready his mind, still absently wondering if his new skills in Occlumency would aid or hinder his Divination talent. Draco knew that he couldn't be thinking about failure though. He had to be positive that this cup of disgusting leaves was about to grant him the knowledge he needed. Draco could deem them revolting, but he couldn't opine them vacuous; that had been his mother's first ever Divination lesson. </p><p>
Draco prepared his mix and warmed the kettle over his cauldron fire. He invited Linky in when the water was nearly boiling, and she transfigured a table and chairs for herself, Draco, and Bear to sit around. Draco didn't even need to remind her for their customary cups and carefully divided the crushed leaves into each when they appeared on the table. </p><p>
The kettle went off and Draco poured hot water in all three cups, carefully placing the saucer on top of his and Bear's tea for safe steeping; he was confident that Linky could handle her own at this point. A few minutes later he replaced them under the cups and gave both of their teas a dash of sugar, swirling with his spoon just once in each while thinking about the glowing green potion and the lockbox.</p><p>
Then Draco pulled out his latest in the Auror Pendragon Series and began to read aloud. He didn't pause until he had drunk nearly all his own tea. He marked his page and thought once more of the potion and lockbox before he placed the saucer on top of his cup and spun it around four times. He let the mess settle and began to read again, starting on Bear's tea as he did so this time. He repeated the process for Bear's cup when he’d finished that one, and then pushed the book aside completely in favor of gazing in his original cup. </p><p>
There was a knife, triangular, right down the center and halfway up the side. Draco doubted that was meant for his potion and tried to ignore it. Then, clear as day among an assortment of little specks, was one clumpy Neptune. </p><p>
Draco would need to add the "Eye of Newt" then. He couldn't doubt it for a second, he was right. There was not one path of solid reasoning behind his choice, he just knew. </p><p>
He reached for Bear's cup next, but he couldn't see anything besides blobs, indicating too much mugwort in this brew. Draco would have to wait until it dried more to get a clear reading. He helped Linky decode hers and then left to try and prefect the potion.</p><p>
He added in the last ingredient, following the directions to let simmer until it changed from green to red. </p><p>
Draco vialed the potion and had Linky bring him the box. He poured the potion in the key hole and waited. Moments passed and then there was a silent puff of smoke and the box sprang open. Once the smoke cleared, Draco was disappointed to see that there was only a single book inside. It didn't even look too ancient or powerful, just plain, clean black leather bound. Draco read the note attached. </p><p>
<i>I'm not saying good job because this took you much too long and you're a brat. </i></p><p>
<i>Remember, it will be your head, not mine, if your father were to discover this prize. </i></p><p>
Draco hissed and had Linky burn the note to the land of the dead (he’d had his fill of forbidden books, thanks). Draco then placed the lockbox under his bed and the book in Linky's keeper, too angry that he'd wasted so much of his precious summertime slaving for a bloody book to even think about reading it. Instead he returned to his potions lab to check on the leaves, hoping there would be something interesting in Bear’s reading this time. </p><p>
Draco strode purposely over and picked the cup up, but still did not see much. He turned it over in his hands, right then left, and gasped as he suddenly saw the only symbol there; belatedly he realized he'd dropped the cup entirely. Linky saved it from crashing to the floor and hovered it back to the table.</p><p>
She stood on a chair, so she could gaze in it. "What be it, master Draco?" she asked. </p><p>
"A snake," Draco said, his mouth suddenly dry. He knew that snakes could be good signs sometimes; mostly when they were stretched across the edge of a cup though, circular in shape. This snake was coiled many times yet stretched across the center. Its head was at the very bottom of the cup, the largest chunk of mugwort, sticking up and basically hissing at him.</p><p> 
Draco shouted at Linky to finish cleaning up and ran to dig through all his old notes boxed under his bed. He found what he was looking for nearly at the bottom. His original list of symbols. He hadn't needed to use it in what felt like years. </p><p>
Draco skipped straight to snake and quickly scanned the small paragraph underneath. </p><p>
<i>Dark. Bad omen. Distrust. Loss of loyalty in close ones. Immortality. </i></p><p>
That night Draco made sure to have Linky grab Bear from his lab and bring her to their room before the lumos went out.</p>
