    <p>Queenie loves girly things and would always look her best. Whether it’s going to work or just by buying a few things in the grocery, she always make sure that she looks her best. It was no surprise that every head will turn her way whenever she goes out and she would be lying to herself if she doesn’t find the situation very flattering. The women would look at her with a hint of jealousy in their eyes and the men would be in awe of her beauty. </p><p>To make things short and simple: It’s hard to date a bombshell.</p><p>So when the pretty blonde witch somehow entered Jacob’s life, he thanked the heavens and stars because just this once, they seemed to be with his side. So every single day, he tries so hard to get Queenie to see that he’s the right person for her. He tried to dress the way Mr Graves dress but he cannot afford the expensive ties and coat. He examines the way other men walk with confidence while boasting around how wealthy they were but Jacob cannot even keep his head held high for a minute before shrinking back to his weird posture. </p><p>So he tried with the least expensive and not arrogant thing to get someone’s attention: he change his hairstyle. He bought a few hair gels and a new shampoo that seems to be popular with men and stylishly did his hair.</p><p>He also brought a shaving cream and razor and shaved his mustache which made him look a few years younger.</p><p>---</p><p>The next morning, a few of his customers took notice of his change of hairstyle. His messy hair is now slicked back with gel.</p><p>“Well, Mr Kowalski, don’t you look quite dashing?” his regular customer complimented him as he handed her a freshly baked bread and pastries in a brown paper bag.<br/>He gave her a big genuine smile while absentmindedly touching his hair. Just then, a blonde curly hair, with a kind smile and pink coat walked inside his bakery.</p><p>“Hi.” Queenie greeted him warmly and he cleared his throat before speaking.</p><p>“Hey, Q. the usual?” Queenie nodded while handing him a dollar.</p><p>“Something looks different.” Queenie mentioned while looking around and Jacob checked to see if his hair is still in place.</p><p>“Oh! You have new pastries available!” Queenie exclaimed and manage to buy Jacob’s new invention of raspberry tart.</p><p>“Here you go, Q.” Jacob said while handing Queenie two paper bags and she smiled warmly at him.</p><p>“Your hair looks really cute like that.” Queenie giggled at Jacob’s reaction who turned red as a tomato.</p><p>“Thanks, Jacob. See you around.” She gave him one of her infamous smile that can make any guy swoon over her presence then headed straight out. </p><p> </p><p>Jacob cannot stop smiling for the rest of the day.</p>
