  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>Sometimes, when Ellie had nothing better to do, she would imagine ways in which she would change her favorite tv shows, movies or books. Not because there was anything wrong with them (well, except for the last season of Game of Thrones, which was almost universally despised) but simply for the fun of it.</p><p>One of her favorite TV shows was 'the Vampire Diaries' and though it had more than its shares of problems, especially in the last seasons, it still remained, at least in her humble opinion, one of the best of its genre (not to the level of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', of course, but which was?). It was certainly iconic.</p><p>Personally, what Ellie liked best, was the vast and varied world they had created, with its own set of rules and lore. Well, and Damon, naturally. She loved the Originals – well, not Finn, but definitely all the others – but her favorite character has always been and will always be Damon. It was strange because before the show was even on, she had read the first three books in the series, and she had not been a fan of Damon.</p><p>She had loved Stefan instead, and she had been rooting for him and Elena. But the show had changed all that. Stelena in the books was so much better, there was no comparison. But that was because both Stefan and Elena in the books were very different people. And Damon as well. In the books Damon was portrayed as selfish and cruel – which was the same as the show, in the beginning – but there wasn't enough dept in him to truly catch her attention. Maybe it was because she had stopped after the third book and the character would have been more flushed out the more the story would progress, but she didn't continue because, once the TV show started, she was hooked.</p><p>It took a few episodes for her to really get into it but once she did, she became obsessed. By the time the Georgia episode aired, she was firmly in the Team Damon category. Moreover, she was also of the idea that, because of the way in which they had been written, Stefan and Elena would have never lasted, Damon or no Damon.</p><p>Stefan constantly lie to her, or omitted the truth, and Elena justified Stefan's behaviour over and over and forgave him all the time, instead of calling him out on his crap like she did with Damon. Moreover, it seemed like they would both pretend to be what they were not, Stefan a human and Elena the sad little girl that lost her parents even when she had moved on from her parents' death and was ready to live again.</p><p>Stefan would have held Elena back from being who she really was even if she had never turned into a vampire. Even if Elena had chosen Stefan at the end of season 3, if she had stayed human she would still have come to regret her decision and left Stefan for Damon anyway. They just hadn't fit anymore, not since season 3, and to be honest they didn't really fit before then either. The only reason Elena had fallen for Stefan was the fact that Stefan had appeared in a moment of her life when she needed someone, someone new and different, someone willing to love her and being there for her in her time of need. But it could have been anyone really. While Elena had fallen in love with Damon <em>for</em> Damon. Ellie bet if Elena had remembered her first meeting with Damon, she would never have given Stefan the time of day. Or maybe that was just her obsession with Damon talking, who knew.</p><p>Anyway, Ellie had made a list of all she should have changed about 'TVD'. The first and most important thing was, precisely, Elena not forgetting her first meeting with Damon. And she wouldn't forget because the compulsion wouldn't work on her because she was a witch. And remembering Damon would have stopped Elena from falling for Stefan that quickly (though her and Damon's relationship would still take a while to develop for obvious reasons).</p><p>There were other things she had written, three whole pages of them. Ellie shook her head. What was the point though? The thing she wanted most was being Elena Gilbert. Sure, her life wasn't easy, far from it, she had died (twice), lost so many people along the way, but in the end, she had gained Damon's love and wasn't that worth everything else? Ellie thought so. Though, of course, Ellie wouldn't want to remember being anyone other than Elena Gilbert; she wouldn't want to remember that the life she would be living as Elena Gilbert was, in truth, a Tv show. She wouldn't know what was going to happen before it happened. Otherwise, where would be the fun in that? Ellie sighed. If only…</p><p>Ellie shook her head at herself and got ready for bed, not noticing the shooting star passing through the night sky outside her window. She went to sleep, not knowing everything would be different for her tomorrow, though she wouldn't realize anything had changed at all.</p>
