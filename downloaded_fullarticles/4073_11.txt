    <p>
  <span>It takes Harry five days before he is able to step back and think about the fact that the Weasleys took him in after the battle without question. The fact that he didn’t even have to think about where he would stay. The fact that no one has been treating him as an intruder to their grief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thinks he might not have noticed because he has been spending his time in two modes: walking the quiet green hills of Ottery St. Catchpole alone, and busying himself in The Burrow’s kitchen or washing laundry or scrubbing floors or doing anything else that would allow his body to be on autopilot and his mind to be blank.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione is staying with them too. She hasn’t mentioned plans to go back to her parents, and no one has asked. The war is still too raw and fresh to think about going far away, to Australia or to the Muggle world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s hard to say who’s holding up who. Sometimes Harry sees Hermione leaning against Ron, her shoulders shaking and her breath catching on her sobs, but sometimes it is the other way around. Sometimes Harry holds them both, although his eyes are so dry they sting and his throat so tight he can barely swallow. He’s still waiting for the flood of tears to come.</span>
</p><p>George is barricaded in his bedroom. Harry doesn’t know if the bedroom is still Fred and George’s, or just George’s. Either thought is a fresh stab of pain. George only lets Ginny in to see him, so she’s the one who brings him trays of soft bread and warm soup and hot tea, and once Harry catches her sneaking in some firewhisky. He doesn’t stop her. He hopes the burning will numb the pain.</p><p>
  <span>Ginny, though the youngest, has taken it upon herself to be the head of the household until Mr. and Mrs. Weasley have worked through the worst of their grief. With that hard look in her eyes that Harry has always loved and sometimes feared, she orders the others to gather vegetables from the garden, to wash and chop and cook, to clean and keep The Burrow intact, all while doing her own fair share of work. Keeping busy seems to be the only thing keeping her together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bill and Fleur spend their nights at Shell Cottage, but stop by every day to help look after things, although their visits are usually short as Bill is still a member of the Order of the Phoenix and is busy overseeing the rebuilding of the new Ministry of Magic; Fleur is equally determined to assist with the restoration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur, too, is often called away to the Ministry, and he leaves The Burrow without complaint, though his eyes are blank and his skin unhealthily pale. When he’s home, he spends too much time sitting in his armchair staring at nothing, but no one really minds. He drinks the tea that appears at his armrest without noticing how it got there, but no one minds that either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly seems to cycle through the stages of grief with the fury of a tempest. Sometimes they hear her screaming her rage in the apple orchard; months later, when the apples ripen, they will be too sour to eat. Sometimes they hear her talking to Arthur late at night, asking him how it could be possible, what she could have done to stop it; no one can sleep on those nights. The only stage of grief she seems to miss every time is acceptance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy doesn’t seem to know what to do with himself. He floats around the house looking miserable and scared, his mouth pressed so tight it’s as if he’s afraid of his own words. Maybe he is. After everything he has done, there isn’t much for him to say, even though everyone has accepted him back into the family as though he’d never left. Whatever ambitions he had before the war seem to have been snuffed out like a candle flame in a draft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there’s Charlie. Like Ginny, he sees the sense in carrying on, and is always there to pick things up when they’re dropped. Sometimes this happens literally; three times now Molly’s fingers have slipped around a glass or dish in the kitchen, and Charlie has been there with a soft but sure </span>
  <em>
    <span>Reparo</span>
  </em>
  <span> to put things right. Other times this happens in a less concrete way. Harry watched once as Molly set down her quill and stormed out of the house, striding towards the apple trees with her head down, and Charlie sat down at the table, picked up the quill and continued writing with a steady hand. Glancing at Harry, who was standing hesitantly in the doorway with a basketful of linens to wash, he simply said, “Funeral invitations.” Harry swallowed and nodded, but said nothing. There was nothing more to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An outsider might have seen the stoic set of Charlie’s shoulders, might have noticed he rarely spoke, and thought he too was an outsider to the Weasley’s grief. After all, he’d been living in Romania for the past seven years, and had missed a great deal of his siblings growing up. But every now and then Harry caught it in a look, the grief so deep it looked for a moment as though Charlie might crack and crumble from the pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the funeral comes, everything changes. Perhaps it is something about seeing George out in the open for the first time in a week, his face pale but not as ghostly as they’d feared. Perhaps it is the fact that the dusk around them is achingly beautiful, with a velvet purple sky and a symphony of crickets and a cascade of fireflies. Or perhaps it is the fact that the somber flowers arranged around the aisles explode into miniature Weasleys’ Wildfire Whizbangs when George gestures at them during his speech, or that Arthur’s wand turns into a rubber chicken when he automatically moves to try to clear them away, or that when George, faking panic, pretends to drop the notes for his speech, in actuality he lets a screaming yo-yo fall from his hand. It is cathartic. The entire extended Weasley family (except for Aunt Muriel, who looks scandalized) begins to laugh, and just as quickly begins to sob, and it is loud and ugly and somehow the only fitting end for the funeral of one of the two people who has been responsible for at least half of the laughter of Harry’s entire life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the funeral, Molly reassumes her role as the matriarch of The Burrow, snapping out orders to the rest of the family as they set out tables and food and drinks for those who attended and are now gathering out in the garden. Ginny, sensing that her duties are done, hovers at George’s shoulder, appraising everyone who approaches him with a watchful eye but saying nothing. Her eyes are so fierce that most people don’t dare approach, leaving George in relative peace as he talks to Lee Jordan in low tones.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron, Percy, and Harry are the errand boys, levitating casseroles and pitchers of iced pumpkin juice and napkin-wrapped bundles of silverware out to the garden, where Bill and Charlie are settling the heavy wooden tables in place. Harry remembers that summer evening before the Quidditch World Cup with a knifelike pain. The family had been whole, then. This time there is no thunderous crashing as they knock together in battle; this time they are set gently on the ground, their legs touching the soil so softly there isn’t a breath of sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arthur and Hermione light torches and drape the garden fence with glowing moonflowers. Ron keeps glancing at Hermione, clearly wanting to go to her, but Harry can’t tell if it’s to comfort her, or to seek comfort for himself. She keeps her face turned away from the light, which makes Harry think she must still be crying. Arthur looks grayer and more lost than ever, and keeps accidentally dousing the torches with a stream of water and turning the moonflowers a bleak gray. He doesn’t even notice as Hermione follows behind him, undoing his mistakes with a wordless flick of her wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the family finally gathers for dinner, Harry longs to slip away and walk into the dark fields, disappearing into the tranquil summer night. But one look at all of the Weasleys is all it takes to see that each of them feels the same, and there’s no way he can leave them, knowing that. He sits between Ron and Ginny and tunes out the conversations around him, pretending to eat even though his stomach feels tight and his tongue dry. Ron is quiet, paying more attention to Hermione’s hand in his under the table than to anything else, and Ginny is equally silent, her attention focused on George on her left. Harry hasn’t spoken to her since the battle. He can’t tell if she’s avoiding him, or if he’s avoiding her, but she doesn’t seem angry with him. Just consumed by grief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During a lull in the conversation, one of those moments where by chance everyone ceases talking at once, Harry looks up from his plate, feeling that same primal fear that always shot through him when he realized he’d missed a professor’s question in class. Across from him sits Charlie, who looks up at the exact moment and catches Harry’s eye. The conversations resume around them, but as the misplaced panic trickles away, Harry’s heartbeat doesn’t slow. He feels as though he’s seeing Charlie for the first time. His hair is long, but not straight like Bill’s; it tumbles in waves to his shoulders, and he’s tied a handful of it back off of his face, though a few strands still fall into his eyes. Even seated at the table it is obvious that he is the shortest of all the Weasleys, Ginny included, but short doesn’t mean slight - he has broad shoulders and muscled arms, and Harry thinks he must belong outdoors, climbing trees and scaling cliffs and riding dragons. Charlie is still staring back at him, but Harry can’t read the look in his dark brown eyes, and couldn’t say what expression is reflected in his own. He feels odd, like he might come untethered and float away from the table, like the voices of the people around him are the songs of mermaids deep underwater, distant and indecipherable. Harry looks down and the feeling passes as quickly as it came, instead he only feels deeply tired. He doesn’t want to question what just happened; all he wants is to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, the guests at the table are beginning to stand up and say their thanks and goodbyes to the Weasleys; Lee, Harry, and Hermione are the only non-Weasleys remaining at the end, and all three help clean up even though they’re dead on their feet. Grief, it turns out, is just as exhausting as fighting a war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That night, Harry, Ron, and Hermione all flop down on Ron’s bed together; Hermione used a clever extension charm to make it big enough for them to lay comfortably. They’ve been sleeping this way every night since the battle of Hogwarts, shoulders touching and ankles crossing while they halfheartedly fight over blankets and pillows and grumble about how they’ve twisted up the sheets. If Ron and Hermione usually wake up in each other’s arms, Harry doesn’t mention it. He can’t imagine sleeping alone, with no one to hold back the bleak memories of war, to wake him from his nightmares if he begins to scream. But as he listens to Ron’s deep breathing turn into light snoring, and Hermione’s quiet sniffles turn into even breaths, he feels loneliness claw at him like thorns. He wonders why he doesn’t wish Ginny were here beside him, when he feels he could drown from the loneliness. He wonders if he is broken now, if he will never be able to want or need or love again. Not wanting to think about it, he stares at Ron’s bright orange ceiling, watching it flicker in the candlelight and daring himself to sleep.</span>
