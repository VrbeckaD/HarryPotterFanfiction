Arawn sat in the little hotel room, swinging his feet as he stared out the window. For a trip to another country, he thought this might have been a little more interesting, but as it was… well...</p><p>“Mae-Mae? Hey, pumpkin. You doing alright here? Have enough books?”</p><p>Arawn glanced up before dropping his gaze to his lap. “Yeah, mum. I’m good here.”</p><p>Arawn’s mum bustled around the little room picking up the few bits of clutter he’d left out before coming over and hugging him. “I’m sorry about having to wait to explore but I did tell you this was a business trip and wouldn’t be fun. Maybe we can go out and do some real girl things tomorrow when I get some time off?”</p><p>“Sure,” he said forcing a smile before turning back to the window. As his mother bustled back out of the room he absently repeated the word. “Sure.”</p><p>The days had been lovely so far on the trip and they’d already been to a couple of different countries before the meetings. It should have felt nice but any time with his family was… well… he hated it. He put on the dresses, combed and braided his hair, and forced a polite smile for all his mother’s business friends but he despised it. Here he wasn’t allowed to wear the hiking boots and jeans that he so dearly loved and still his parents refused to call him by the name he’d requested a few years back. Everyone liked to claim it was a phase-- like deciding he liked skulls more than dalmatians. Of course, he didn’t like either now. Well, that was a lie, he still liked skulls but not for the reason that people seemed to think. Dogs, on the other hand, were often too loud and too big for him to feel comfortable and touching them left an oil on his hands that made his skin crawl worse than the idea of touching the gunk that gathers in the drain of the sink.</p><p>As he pushed aside the thoughts of what tomorrow might be like, he opened the book he’d been trying to muddle through for his homeschool course. He didn’t intend to try and read more though. No, instead his attention was on the bookmark. The bookmark was an advertisement for a local museum. Or church. He wasn’t quite sure because sometimes he could swear that it changed. Still, when he’d first read it, there had been a post about a local attraction that featured a collection of skulls and a cemetery tour that he’d been ‘dying’ to go on. At least that was the joke he’d told in trying to get permission to go. Sadly, everyone seemed to think that he was too young to go alone-- but not stay in the hotel alone all day for the past two weeks-- and there was no one to go with him since ‘everyone’ his mother considered acceptable was busy with the meetings.</p><p>They only had one more day here and a part of him still hoped that he’d get to go. Perhaps his mother would surprise him? Maybe instead of going to a modern art museum-- which he usually disliked because they felt too sterile-- and trying on dresses that were very nice but not something he’d want to wear, they’d go and visit the local crypts and listen to the tours that talked about the history? It wasn’t going to happen but he entertained the dream for a few moments before closing the book again.</p><p>Slipping off the little window ledge, he made his way over to the bag with his schoolbooks and simply stood there looking down at it all. He loved learning. Usually. At least, for the most part. Overall he did fine, and his mother trusted him to check his work. His schoolwork was never a problem and the monthly visit with their assigned worker always went well when they did impromptu tests. He didn’t even mind schooling himself unless he ran into problems he couldn’t puzzle out. Lately, when problems <em>did</em> arise he would seek out the hotel workers and help them make beds or take out trash as they took a look at the issue-- usually math-- and helped him through it if they could. One of his favourites to seek out, Bill, was particularly good at it and often explained it in the just right way for Arawn to understand even though Arawn struggled with numbers the most.</p><p>All that aside, he was bored.</p><p>Horribly, terribly, frightfully bored.</p><p>Tucking his book away into his hoodie, Arawn decided to go see if Bill was still on shift for the day. Sometimes when the man wasn’t busy they could play chess in the back. Though Arawn hated the game, it was nice to do something other than sitting by himself as he read or drew. The hall was quiet when he slipped out of the room and towards the back stairs. With the practice he’d gained over the last two weeks of staying there, he avoided the creaky steps by pushing off the handrail and jumping the steps he didn’t like. The last step was always really loud, so he simply jumped the whole final part, tucking into a roll as he hit the ground and bouncing back up to his feet just as someone began to clap.</p><p>“Excellent landing. Ten out of ten. Great form,” Bill said as he tied off the trash bag and straightened. “Evening, Arawn.”</p><p>Arawn couldn’t help but smile. That was the other thing that he liked about Bill-- he always called him by his preferred name or a nickname if his mom was near. Arawn tucked his hands back into his hoodie, running his nail absently over the uneven pages of the book as he wandered over and greeted Bill, “Hi. ...need help with the trash?”</p><p>Bill exaggerated wiping the sweat from his brow while giving a winded whistle. “Oh. Think you can manage? This one’s heavy.”</p><p>“You say that,” Arawn said as he picked it up and walked it over to the cart with the others, “but they never are.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s just American kids but you <em>are</em> strong. Stronger than me that’s for sure.”</p><p>“Hay bales are heavier,” Arawn said as he heaved the bag into the container and headed for the next as Bill fell into pushing the cart. At the door of the next tiny meeting room. “How do they make so much trash when all they do is argue about fonts?” Arawn asked as they got to the next bin and he set to tying it off like Bill had taught him.</p><p>“Well… that’s a good question. I think most of them order lunch and don’t eat it. Seems some adults are always on diets and whatnot.”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Arawn didn’t answer that because from what he knew of most adults it was true. His mum was <em>always</em> on a diet. There were a few times where she’d even talked about putting <em>him</em> on a diet but then he’d grow a few inches and be back to being what she called ‘normal’ sized which made her say she was going to hold off. Plus, the theory of people just tossing food was confirmed if anyone bothered to simply look in the trash can. A look in the trash usually revealed stupid amounts of wasted food. You could feed a city with the amount they tossed every day. It was ridiculous.</p><p>“You seem rather sombre today kiddo, something up?” Bill asked, leaning onto the handle of his cart and giving Arawn his full attention.</p><p>“I--” Arawn caught sight of his mum at the end of the hall and moved quickly so that he was standing behind the cart as he finished tying off the bag-- “Uh. It’s... nothing.”</p><p>“Still want to go to the museum and on that tour?”</p><p>Arawn had shown Bill the advertisement when he’d first found it. Or truthfully it had fallen out of his pocket and Bill had asked him where he’d gotten it. Shrugging, Arawn confirmed, “Kinda. A museum would be nice. So far my essay on this trip is going to be-- I counted seven different trains but I saw them each fifteen times though I’m sure they passed more than that and the most interesting thing I’ve seen was a purple bus that didn’t seem to follow American or European driving laws-- I checked-- but no one seemed to care. It rained, which I liked, but the sheets felt weird and sometimes the quiet was too loud or the noise was too loud or it was just loud in general which is strange to say but overall I somehow missed the sound of frogs. The end.”</p><p>Bill chuckled. “That still sounds like a good essay.”</p><p>“It’s supposed to be half a page for every day that I’m here. ...I was really hoping to pad it out with something interesting but mum wants to go do ‘girly’ things tomorrow.” He tried to keep the misery out of his voice, he really did, but a great heaping spoonful seemed to fall out anyhow. “Sorry. I’m just whinging.”</p><p>“Well, you are at least getting a hang of the language. Perhaps you could write about that?”</p><p>“I could but I think there are only so many times I can use knackered, knob, and bollox without someone catching on.” Arawn joked with a halfhearted shrug as he pushed the back door open and helped Bill with getting the cart down the stairs. He grunted with the effort as he asked, “do you think you’ll have time for some chess before you go tonight?”</p><p>“I might. ...Or I could ask your mum if she minds me taking you to the museum so you can properly pad out that essay.”</p><p>Arawn nearly dropped the cart and definitely missed the last step but he caught himself with barely a wobble as he asked, “REALLY? You think she’d let me go?”</p><p>“No harm in asking. She was just down the hall, right? Why don’t you go grab her while I finish this up and clock out.”</p><p>With a nod, Arawn tore back up the stairs and down the hall. He’d not dare to shout and possibly disturb any of the meetings still going on but when he caught sight of his mum chatting with someone near the taster table he bounded up like an excited hound and still nearly knocked her glass in his excitement. “Mum. ... mum? mum--”</p><p>“Yes, hun? I’m a little busy--”</p><p>“Can I go with Bill to the museum? It would be for my essay. Please? The pamphlet said that tours run till 9 and it’s only 5 right now. Please? It would mean I’m not by myself.”</p><p>“Honey, I can’t have you badgering the staff here into--”</p><p>Bill arrived and offered out a hand, cutting her disapproving lecture off. “Miss Ranklin? Hi. Smartypants and I have been doing chess in the evenings, I hope you don’t mind this sudden ask but I was going to take my parents to go to the museum and take the tour today-- for their anniversary you see-- and I know Ar-- thur. Uh, my father, Arthur. He wanted to go… Well, I just wanted to make the offer. I’d be more than happy to take the kiddo off your hands for a bit since I planned I going anyhow…?”</p><p>“Please? I’ll even do an extra page for the essay.” Arawn begged. “With extra sketches and everything.”</p><p>“I… Mae, dear, how about you run up to the room and brush your hair while I talk to Mr…”</p><p>“William. William Weasley, but I prefer to be called Bill,” Bill said as he shot Arawn a wink and lead his mum away.</p><p>Without needing to be told twice, Arawn shot up the stairs taking them two at a time and sprinting like a much less well-behaved child for his room to brush and get changed from the hoodie and pyjama pants he’d been wearing. He had just finished rolling up the legs on his pants to hide his wearing them under his skirt and was giving his hair a quick brush when his mom gave a single knock and opened the door.</p><p>“Hunny? Ah-- you’re already dressed…”</p><p>He didn’t like that tone. Arawn lowered his arms slowly after pushing clipping down hairpin to hold his growing bangs away from his face. Much like the section of his father’s lawn that he’d helped lay wet paper on-- his excitement began to wither as he hesitantly asked, “Can I not go?”</p><p>“Well, I just don’t feel comfortable--”</p><p>“I’ve been good,” Arawn whispered, already trying to hold back tears as the fading happiness curdled into childish despair at the prospect of not going. “I’ve done all my homework. I even did extra. I just… please?”</p><p>“Oh hun, I just don’t feel right sending you off with this young man-- nice as he seems-- but things can happen to girls… How about this,” Arawn’s mum came around and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. “He asked that I wait to meet his parents before deciding, so I haven’t given an official answer. Maybe once I see them…”</p><p>Trying to hide a sniffle, Arawn used the sleeve of his hoodie to wipe at his eyes before saying, “Please, momma? We’re only here one more day and you have stuff you want to do tomorrow. And I… I read about the catacombs. It’s not like the Paris catacombs with the skulls cause it’s not as old but it is a few hundred years older than anything in the U.S. They don’t allow pictures but I can do extra drawings for the essay…”</p><p>It was as much begging as just blathering and trying to express why he found it so interesting. Thankfully, his mum’s will seemed to be crumbling. “Well, you have been really good this trip and you <em>had</em> wanted to see the Paris catacombs-- and I’m really sorry we couldn’t detour there-- so I suppose…”</p><p>“I’ll be good. I promise. Extra pages and everything. Promise.”</p><p>She sighed. “We’ll see. I’m edging towards a yes but I do want to meet who you will be going with first and I want you to take a map and my cell phone with you in your bag if you do go. And a jacket.”</p><p>Of course, he was already wearing his jacket but he never argued if he could help it so he simply gave a curt nod as his hopeful smile began to return. “Okay.”</p><p>It was only a few minutes later that he was waving to his mum before walking away with the rather eclectic looking family who, oddly enough, had looked mildly more presentable before rounding the corner. Not that they didn’t look presentable now, but Arawn could have sworn that Mrs Weasley’s shawl had been a simple beige yet now it was a multicolour swirl that was rather ostentatious. He also though that previously Mr Weasley’s suit and tie was… well… a suit and tie but now his jacket hung much lower and his tie was a colourful bowtie that matched his wife’s shawl.</p><p>“Uhm, can we stop for a moment?” Arawn asked, fidgeting with the hem of his skirt.</p><p>Bill nodded. “Something up? Forget something?”</p><p>Arawn shook his head, already unrolling his pant legs and pulling off the skirt. It was the only pair of pants that he’d snuck into his pack in the little secret compartment in the back-- the rest of his clothes were the skirts and dresses that his mother had insisted he take. As he folded the skirt and tucked it into his bag, Bill chuckled and turned to his parents-- assuming that’s who they really were-- to give them hugs as he said, “Thanks for coming on such short notice. I figured it might be the only way to get Arawn’s mum to allow this.”</p><p>After Arawn finished tucking his hair up into a messy bun he gave a small wave when all eyes turned towards him again and Molly asked, “Arawn? Sorry dear, I thought she said your name was--”</p><p>“Arawn.” Bill filled in, giving his mother a look. “Like Charlie.”</p><p>“I--” Arawn went to tuck his hair behind his ear only to remember that he’s just put it up when his fingers brushed only open air-- “Uhm, I don’t-- If it’s okay that is… I understand if--”</p><p>“Nonsense dear,” Mrs Weasley interrupted as she shared a glance with her husband, “That’s perfectly fine dear. Now, I know we didn’t get a lot of introductions before so I’m Molly and that man there is Arthur, my husband. So, Bill, dear, you didn’t tell us why we were to dress nicely and leave the kids-- be a miracle if the twins don’t burn down the house before we get back even if Percy is home. I just don’t--”</p><p>“Mum.” Bill set a hand on her shoulder, “They’ll be fine for one evening. I figured you and dad could use a night off. It is your anniversary after all.”</p><p>“Oh… is it?” Molly’s hand flew up to her face as her cheeks began to redden. “Bless me, I’d completely forgotten.”</p><p>Bill held up a handful of tickets. “Well, that’s why I remembered. I thought you and dad might like this. It’s a muggl-- a, ah, uh-- a mmmm… a tour. It’s a tour. Through a museum and a crypt. I know it’s not quite your thing, mum, but I thought dad might like it and it gave you a chance to have a break from the house.”</p><p>Arawn looked between everyone as they all went into a bought of silent stares and trying to converse with facial expressions alone. He’d seen Bill do it before with the hotel owner, Vimmy, as well as one of the cooks, and he figured it must be some sort of British thing. When it had gone on long enough to be uncomfortable, he pulled out his wallet. “Uhm, Bill? I can pay for my own ticket. I’ve been saving for this trip for a while and haven’t gotten to go anywhere so I still have all my savings.”</p><p>Bill held out one of the tickets with a grin. “Too late. Save it for the gift shop.”</p><p>“I--... ok.”</p><p>Molly took the ticket and looped Arawn’s arm through hers on one smooth movement as she said, “I’ll hold onto this for you, dear. Bill, why don’t you take a moment and talk to your father while we go on ahead?”</p><p>Together they trundled off while Bill and Arthur fell behind. It was perhaps a block later before Molly slowed and muttered, “And I don’t actually know where I’m going.”</p><p>“It’s two more blocks,” Arawn said, remembering the map that he’d studied while sitting in the window and only wishing he could go, “and then a left. You can see it from here. It’s that white building there.”</p><p>“Ah. Thank you, dear. ...so, Arawn, I know why Arthur, bless him, would want to visit a mug-- uh, museum. Like that. But I’m curious why you want to? You know we could do something else if you preferred…”</p><p>“I want to.” Arawn focused on the ground, counting steps as he answered quietly, “I like things that people overlook. The museum is doing a special on burial and internment and how it differs with different cultures. That’s why the tour goes through the graveyard and catacombs. Plus, America doesn’t have anything like this. At least not on the same age scale. I, uhm… I wanted to go see the Paris catacombs. I think it’s really humbling to see something like all the skulls in the walls and know how long people have been around. And it doesn’t seem any less grotesque than going to places like the great wall, you know? I mean they buried people in that too and you’re actually walking on them and people don’t seem to think about it but I like it because it reminds you that you’re alive? Kinda? Mum thinks I’m obsessed with death since-- since-- uhm-- anyhow I think cemeteries and stuff are really nice because I feel like tombstones and the way someone is buried actually shows more about how they lived and were loved than anything else. Some tombstones have really nice things on them and to see a… uhm...”</p><p>Arawn paused, realizing that he’d been rambling and pulled his arm loose to cross them over his chest as he hunched. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to go on.”</p><p>“No, no. I think it’s really interesting. I don’t think I’ve ever looked at cemeteries that way before. What were you going to say about tombstones?”</p><p>“I…” Arawn’s voice came out a squeaky pitch and he cleared his throat before trying again, “I just think it’s really interesting. Like a lot of burial is about status but when you walk through a graveyard or a catacomb and particularly when you see the exposed bodies I feel like it gives someone who wasn’t very important a chance to be remembered. And there is a lot of beauty in death--- I mean, not in the way that people think-- but life… and people… they have a lot of restrictions. And then there’s dirt which is cool too. Because after a while bodies just become dirt and we’re walking on dinosaurs and other planets at this point because particles come down from space and the bodies have eroded into the soil or been absorbed into the ….water… Sorry, I, uhm-- I read a lot…”</p><p>“Fascinating,” Arthur said coming to stand nearby. “And you think some of the dirt is from space?”</p><p>“I-- it’s…” Arawn came to a stop as they reached the doors to the museum and twisted at his hoodie sleeve as he said, “It, uhm. ...My uncle used to work for the space program, NASA. He used to bring books about space and stuff. A lot of people think that meteors are all we get from space but a lot more is just not seen as it gets added to our atmosphere and drifts down slower. It’s like skin cells but from space. And we also shed skin cells so in a way when we travel we always leave a piece of ourselves where we go. I think the gravitational pull of our planet keeps it all from going off the planet though.”</p><p>As Bill opened the museum door and ushered everyone in Arthur said, “Your uncle seems like a very interesting man.”</p><p>“Mhmm. He was.” Arawn hummed distractedly as he stepped into the building and took a moment to simply take it all in. The place was magnificent. They had done a lot of decorations for each of the areas and it seemed like they might just have burial exhibits from all over the world.</p><p>He started to wander towards one when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Bill flashed him a smile before he turned to his parents, “How about you two wander for a while. I’ll stay with Arawn and we’ll go on the lower tour when we’ve had our fill.” With the family waved away, Bill gestured ahead, “shall we?”</p>
