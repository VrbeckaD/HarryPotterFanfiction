    <p>Newt knew that Theseus wasn’t feeling good. It’s not that he was sick or physically hurt, but Newt knew that Theseus was hurting on the inside. Of course, this hurting was perfectly reasonable, something anybody else would feel in the same position, and yet the older brother refused to talk about it.<br/>
Newt knew from experience that bottling up your emotions was not a good idea and as much as Newt wanted to be there for him, he couldn’t. The British Ministry of Magic had called him back, wanting to see his progress on his book, plus they probably wanted to hear his side of the Grindelwald incident.<br/>
Of course, after hearing about what happened, Theseus immediately came to New York to check on him. Hence the reason why Theseus was even in New York. While he was here, Theseus also managed to get caught up in aftermath of Grindelwald and was required to stay for at least another two weeks.<br/>
Which brought Newt back to his problem. He certainly couldn’t leave Theseus alone, but he feared that Theseus would be even more hesitant to open up to anyone else. He tried his hardest to think of somebody Theseus would be comfortable with. The ringing of a door chime dragged him out of his thoughts and that’s when Queenie Goldstein walked into the bakery.<br/>
“Oh, hi Newt” beamed Queenie as she stopped beside him, as usual she gave him personal space, which he deeply appreciated, preferring to stay a good few feet away from people.<br/>
“Um, hello Queenie” replied Newt. “Would you mind… Would you mind doing me a favor. If not, it’s okay, I’m sure I-”.<br/>
“Of course, I wouldn’t mind honey, what do you need?”<br/>
“Well, you see, I have to go back to Britain for a little while. And, well, my brother Theseus is in town, and I don’t want to leave him alone. I was kind of hoping that maybe he could stay with you”.<br/>
“That sounds like fun, when do you leave?” asked Queenie.<br/>
“Tonight, actually, but it will only be for a few days”.<br/>
--- 3 hours later---<br/>
Queenie sat in her living room, awaiting the arrival of Newt and his brother. Tina was away on an undercover assignment, trying to locate the still missing Percival Graves, so it would be nice to have some company.<br/>
Queenie arose from her seat when she heard a gentle knock on the door. She stepped aside to let the two wizards in.<br/>
“Queenie, this is my brother, Theseus, he’s an auror with the British Ministry. Theseus, this is my friend, Queenie” said Newt, introducing the two-remaining people in the room.<br/>
“Well, it’s always good to meet a friend of my brother’s” said Theseus as he and Queenie shook hands.<br/>
“Queenie, can I talk to you in private?” asked Newt, nodding towards the hallway.<br/>
“Sure”, Queenie gave Newt a slightly confused look. She had already promised not to read his mind anymore, knowing Newt enjoyed his privacy.<br/>
Newt stopped at the door, making sure that Theseus was still sitting on the couch and was not in listening range. “Listen, Queenie, there’s a few reasons why I chose you for this and there’s something I need to tell you about Theseus”.</p>
