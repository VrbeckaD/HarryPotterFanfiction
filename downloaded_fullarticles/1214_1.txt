  <span>Everyone is already sitting and eating breakfast (or, in Sirius’ case, using a slingshot to fling strawberries across the pavilion at the back of Regulus’ head where he’s deep in conversation at the Athena table) when a salpinx rings out, loud and clear from Half Blood Hill. Sirius and James are off the bench and racing toward the sound before anyone except the Ares kids have even comprehended. Naturally, they turn it into a race, shouting challenges and insults at one another as they weave around the arts and crafts cabin. Sirius leapfrogs over James as he sticks his leg out to try and trip him, looking over his shoulder and cackling as he takes the lead.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Children of Ares may be the first out of their seats at the sound of the war trumpet, but most of them lack the lithe burst of speed that the children of Hermes possess. And honestly, it would be an embarrassment as cabin leader if Sirius </span>
  <em>
    <span>wasn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> the first one to arrive. He doesn’t admit that he’s a little winded as he crests the hill - monster attacks have been infrequent and lacking in difficulty over the last year. Stopping between two archers, he braces his hands on his knees to catch his breath. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What have we got, Dorcas?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That new camper Chiron told us about. They hit some trouble as soon as they crossed into New York and have a whole host of monsters on their tail.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“New camper?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The girl levels a glare at him that would be much more convincing if it weren’t for the way her lips twitch in amusement. “Do you ever listen during head of cabin meetings? I swear it’s been the only thing he’s talked about for the last three weeks!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Settling in an easy crouch, Sirius taps his lips in mock contemplation. “Hmmm, was I by chance looking at Shacklebolt during said meetings?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dorcas nods.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, then I wasn’t listening. We were arranging a trade deal in morse code.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Trading what?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s classified.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rolling her eyes, she looks back out over the expanse below the hill. “They’re almost here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It never ceases to amaze him how far her hearing can reach. Dorcas holds the record at camp for longest time a demigod survived alone in the wilderness, having spent six years in the Appalachian Mountains. An accomplished huntress, she’s proficient with both her bow and the daggers Sirius knows are strapped to her ankles. When her satyr finally found her, it took quite a bit of convincing to bring her to Camp Half Blood, and no one was sure how long she would stay. Artemis has tried a number of times to convince her to join the Hunt as well, but surprising to everyone, she settled into camp life and has shown no signs of leaving, taking up the mantle of Apollo’s head counselor with ease.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Holding her bow between her knees, she reaches up, pulling her long braids back and securing them in a thick ponytail away from her face. High cheekbones and sharp features set in smooth ebony skin turned not a few heads at her arrival and in the years since. If she hadn’t been exceedingly proficient with bow and arrow, and possessing Apollo’s piercing blue eyes, Sirius would have thought her a daughter of Aphrodite. As it worked out though, she has been dating a daughter of Aphrodite for two years now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How many?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dorcas cocks her head to the side, but after several seconds, frowns and shakes her head. “I can’t tell, I can hear the camper and the Roman soldier with them, but whatever is chasing them… Either there are a lot of them, or something with a lot of legs.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Glancing over his shoulder, Sirius sees the rest of the older campers from all cabins have gathered in loose clumps, ready for battle. He knows the youngest have been sent back to their cabins. This should be easy enough to handle, and they will more than outnumber their enemy, no need to risk the youngsters. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rising from his crouch, he strains to see more clearly the shadow rising in the distance. As if sensing their question, a giant eagle bearing the crest of the SPQR swoops down, dropping a spider leg longer than Sirius’ arm at his feet. The eagle wastes no time in circling around and shooting off toward its demigod again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Spinning, Sirius frantically searches the crowd, his eyes landing on Regulus. “Children of Athena, fall back! Last line of defense, do not cross the magical barrier,” he shouts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Since when does Hermes cabin call the shots in battle?” a child of Ares yells back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius grinds his teeth, but is saved by Chiron galloping up the hill. He takes one look at the still twitching leg and nods. “Fall back. Do not crest the hill unless directed otherwise by myself or a head counselor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He can feel Regulus’ eyes burning a hole in the side of his head, but Sirius keeps his attention on the centaur next to him. If they are to face a swarm of Arachne’s children, Athena’s brood will be worse than useless. It is simply a strategy call - no one can accuse him of being overly protective of his brother. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Chiron continues once Athena cabin has dropped back to form a loose line near the Big House; close enough to be in hearing distance but still out of sight of the battle. “Archers hold the hill. Everyone else-” he turns his gaze outward, where a lone shock of bright purple is now visible, standing out starkly against a sea of black, “attack.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Demigods swarm over the hill with a great cry, celestial bronze gleaming in the morning sun. Sirius bends low, digging his feet into the grass, hands fisted as he leads the charge. The Roman and new camper continue running towards them, eagle covering their back and dive bombing the giant spiders hot on their tail. As the Greeks reach them, the Roman draws her spear, turning to stand her ground and whistling a command to her eagle. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius is surprised to see the camper is not a child, as he had assumed, but a boy his own age - practically a man. The boy turns, drawing a long staff from where it’s slung across his back, planting himself next to his guardian. As Sirius nears them, he hears the boy mutter something that he suspects might be “why’d it have to be spiders?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not slowing down, Sirius draws his pair of twin daggers from their sheaths, launching himself into the air as the first spider closes in on them with a shrill screech that leaves goosebumps crawling up his skin. He lands on the monsters back, both blades sinking through the exoskeleton with a sickening crunch. The spider wails, flailing in an attempt to dislodge Sirius, who clings to the hilts for dear life before throwing his body weight to the side and drawing the daggers down, until the monster bursts into a shower of golden dust. Sirius tumbles to the ground, brushing the powder off him as it rains down on his hair and shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“One down and… ten or so to go.” Throwing himself into a roll, a claw lands in the grass where he had been half a second before. A staff swings out, sweeping the spider’s legs in a single fluid motion before coming down on top of it with a crack. The spider lays, legs sprawled out, blinking in a daze, but doesn’t disintegrate. Lunging, Sirius stabs it in the head before it can regain its footing, and finally it dissolves into dust.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Around him the rest of the demigods are quickly felling the arachnids. Standing up straight, he looks over to the boy with the staff, noting up close the design. The shining wood is worn but well cared for, with engravings marking the entire length of it. Further from the center the engravings become accented with silver, until both tips which are encased in the metal.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wiping monster guts from the blades of his daggers, Sirius resheathes them. Reaching out, he taps the silver. “That’s why it didn’t disintegrate. Need to get you something with celestial bronze.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looks at his staff longingly, then back to the pile of golden dust, already beginning to swirl and disperse, back to Tartarus to reform. “I suppose if it means turning spiders to dust I could consider it.” His voice is deep and rhaspy, as if he isn’t used to using it often, and sends a bolt of heat directly to Sirius’ stomach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Actually looking at the boy properly for the first time, Sirius swallows thickly. He inherited precisely two things from his mortal father: a great love and weakness for foreign languages and handsome men. Hopefully this guy can’t speak a foreign language, because Sirius is already </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucked.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A sleeveless brown tunic falls to mid thigh over equally plain breeches (breeches!) with smart leather boots laced up tight, all of which are streaked in mud and grass. He is nearly as tall as Sirius, but with much broader chest and shoulders. While Sirius is tall but slight, perfect for stealth and shadows, this man is all muscle and sinewy strength. He stands at ease, one hand on his staff that is planted in the ground, one hip cocked out to the side watching Sirius as he surveys him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius holds out his hand. “Sirius, head counselor of Hermes cabin.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A large hand envelopes his, warm and calloused beneath his palm. “Remus.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s good to have you, glad you made it safely.” An arm drops around Sirius shoulders, causing him to startle and release Remus’ hand as if he was electrocuted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James is smiling at the other man. “What an entrance! Thanks for bringing the fight to us, it’s been too long.” His sword is back at his waist, but shield still on his arm. “Let’s head up to the Big House and check in with Chiron and then we’ll show you around camp?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus inclines his head in acknowledgement, before turning and starting up Half Blood Hill, leaving Sirius to scramble behind him. His hair is a long tangled mess of brown curls and what appear to be stickler burrs, all held back in a knot of some sort. Whether the knot is intentional or not, Sirius can’t tell. Vaguely he wonders if Remus is used to the Roman public baths and if it would be weird to offer to wash and trim his hair for him. He’s pretty sure it would be weird. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>James elbows him hard in the ribs and Sirius shoots him a look. Unperturbed, James just wiggles his eyebrows suggestively. Maybe he should be more careful with the oogling. </span>
