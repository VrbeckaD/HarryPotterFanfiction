    <p>The war left marks on all them.The peace that was promised was a bitter lie,the war was still on just on a different playing field. </p><p> </p><p>Severus was a bitter man and he despised how the wizarding world was doing to Lily's son.The boy was their scapegoat and the expectations of the people to marry the red harpy's daughter disgusted him. </p><p> </p><p>It was clear that they wanted a James Potter  and Lily Evans 2.0</p><p> </p><p>Severus scoffed at the idea that the girl was anything like Lily.The boy was not like James Potter either ,he hated bullying,pranks and he wasn't an attention seeker.</p><p> </p><p>It took Severus a long time to see it and when he got passed his irrational hatred against the boy he tolerated him better.</p><p> </p><p>The boy was unhappy,Severus learned that the only reason was an Aurour was because he was expected to be like his father.The boy clearly wasn't interested in the Weasley girl,if Severus would guess it looked like the boy was gay and only dated girls because of the narrow mindness of his muggle upbringing. </p><p> </p><p>When he told the boy about a way to start over again,he jumped at the chance with no hesitation. Together they  worked on which timeline was best to enter in.It was decided that they would go during the early 70s when the dark lord was still recruiting. </p><p> </p><p>Severus knew his family tree ,having studied it when his grandfather passed away during his seventh year in Hogwards.He found out that his granduncle disappeared while looking for potion ingredients in the magical forest in Brazil. </p><p> </p><p>Unlike the Forbidden Forest the Brazil equivalent of it was more dangerous.He found blood belonging to his granduncle Theon and during his time as a death eater he collected various blood samples from prominent purebloods. </p><p> </p><p>If he was going back in time then he would be doing it as a pureblood.Being a pureblood would help him get further in his quest.</p><p> </p><p>He finished drawing the runes and  took out the potions he needed for Potter and himself. He cleared out the Prince vault and duplicated all his rare books knowing that he couldn't take the originals with them.</p><p> </p><p>Potter had a lot more to clear out from  the Potter,Black,Peverell and other vaults he inherited.They even copied all the books and journals they found in the Black home.</p><p> </p><p>He heard the sound of the flow.He looked up and saw Potter holding the wolf's baby.</p><p> </p><p>"I am taking him with us"</p><p> </p><p>"You can't be serious,we agreed he would stay with the Weasleys" </p><p> </p><p>"I went there to say goodbye after leaving the bank and when I got there I heard Mrs Weasley,Ginny and Hermoine  is pregnant and told them she felt uncomfortable with being around Teddy in her condition because  his father was a werewolf and Ginny agreed with her and Mrs Weasley said it was a good thing Ginny planned to get me to send Teddy away when we got married and starting our own family. "</p><p> </p><p>It was obvious the boy was hurt by what was said.He probably confronted them and ended up taking the baby when things didn't go the way they wanted.</p><p> </p><p>"Please Professor,I can't leave him here"</p><p> </p><p>"Fine.Did you get everything ?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes,I shrank the money inside the trunks along with the books."</p><p>"Good.Let's get started then"</p><p>They got inside the rune circle ,Harry was holding the sleeping baby close as Severus started chanting.With a flash of light the trio disappeared from the timeline.</p>
