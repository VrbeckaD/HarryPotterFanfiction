    <p>It was fifth year, and James Potter was roaming the halls of Hogwarts. It was late at night and he was carrying the map with him, keeping a wary eye out for Filch of Mrs Norris. He wasn’t really sure where he was going, or why he was even up for that matter, but James had always had trouble sleeping and sometimes a night-time stroll was just the thing he needed. He was on the fourth floor corridor when he heard a shuffling noise coming from just a few meters ahead of him. His hand whipped up to eye level and he muttered,</p><p>‘Lumos’</p><p>A bright light erupted from the end of his wand, casting an eerie glow down the path. There was no one there and James cursed under his breath, his heart still pounding in his chest. He should have bought the cloak with him.</p><p>‘Put that light out boy, what are you doing down here anyway?’</p><p>One of the many paintings lining the walls had called out to him and slowly the remaining occupants where wriggling themselves awake to look at him, James quickly mumbled ‘Nox’ before scampering off behind a tapestry, he would have to continue down the hidden staircase to the dungeons, just in case.</p><p>As James emerged into the new corridor he admired the age washed walls and darks cracks of the dungeons, the lack of natural light making the darkness seem even more overwhelming and solid than on the upper floors. James had always admired the night. Day time was also so lively and full of energy, and James loved that, but there was something about the peace of night that made all his little worries seem to melt into the darkness, he had never understood why Sirius was afraid of the dark, it comforted him.</p><p>‘Who’s there? Don’t try and run I can hear you.’</p><p>The voice rang out through the corridor, and James relit his wand, intending to turn to whichever painting had said that this time and charmingly talk his way out of this. It suddenly hit him as light flooded the hallway that the dungeons didn’t have any paintings on their walls. Instead the source of the voice shocked him into silence.</p><p>Regulus Black stood not 6 feet away, his hand snapping up to shield his eyes. The boy was much shorter than James, and bore an uncanny resemblance to his older brother, but Regulus held himself differently, his posture was upright, his chin held higher in a self-righteous manner that Sirius had begun to lose as the years had gone on. Regulus moved with purpose, Sirius strutted. The black hair was the same, elegantly waved and always shining, but Regulus’ hair was much shorter than his brother’s, his nose was thinner and jaw less defined. But the eyes were the same, always the same, those piercing grey eyes that stood like beacons on the Black’s face, always both mesmerising and terrifying. James was wary of Regulus. He didn't know how the boy would react seeing his brother's best friend in the corridor.

It hadn't been so bad for second and third year, despite him not being in the same house, Sirius had desperately tried to maintain a relationship with his brother, he had always gone on about how close they were before Hogwarts. But as Sirius' relationship with his family had deteriorated further and further, the two brothers had drifted, Sirius was the more loud and boisterous of the two and had always complained about Regulus' leniency towards their parents attitudes. It had broken Sirius' heart in fourth year when Regulus had stopped speaking to him almost entirely after a particularly bad argument in the Black household. But James had always got on well with Regulus, he liked him for some reason.</p><p>‘Oh, it’s you Potter. I hadn’t expected to see you down here, not without your little band-wagon of friends.’ Regulus narrowed his eyes with suspicion, but spoke in a matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>James shook his head, and let out his trademark crooked grin. ‘Nope, just me tonight Reg, Sirius won’t get to see his brother wandering around all alone.’</p><p>Regulus snorted. ‘I don’t know who Sirius is calling brother now days Potter, but it certainly isn’t me.’</p><p>James’ heart sank for the small boy standing in front of him. Sirius was his best friend in the whole world, along with Remus and Peter, and James would always be there for him through thick and thin. Through anything. Sirius was lucky like that. But James knew who Regulus’ friends were, Sirius would turn paler than usual and clench his fists when he saw his brother walking along with them, they were no group of marauders that was for sure. Regulus was much more alone than Sirius was, and James felt for him.</p><p>‘Maybe not to your face Reg, but you know he still cares.’</p><p>‘Yeah, whatever you say.’ Regulus paused for a second, considering James' glasses that were now halfway down his nose and his Quidditch pyjamas. ‘Why are you walking around here anyway?’</p><p>James shrugged. ‘Couldn’t sleep. Sirius snores like the Hogwarts express.’</p><p>Regulus giggled in an almost childlike manner. ‘I know.’ Then, looking like he felt he had said too much, he blushed deeply and turned to walk away.</p><p>‘Wait Regulus stop.’ James called out before he had thought anything through. ‘You want to see something cool?’</p><p>Regulus turned. ‘What?’</p><p>‘I said do you want to see something cool.’</p><p>‘I have to get to sleep, Potter.’</p><p>‘It’s worth it I promise.’</p><p>Regulus stopped to think and James noted he seemed to think things through, he didn’t have the reckless spontaneity Sirius did, which James had always considered Sirius’ greatest and worst quality.</p><p>‘Ok.’</p><p>James grinned. ‘Ok then, follow me.’</p><p>They walked in silence through the stone corridors of the castle for what seemed like an age. James hated silences and he was particularly gifted at filling them, but it felt different when it was Regulus Black standing next to him. Like if he spoke he would intrude on some thought that was not his to know, like he was standing next to the only person who could claim to know his best friend better than he did, but he wasn’t allowed to find out how. It made James uncomfortable.</p><p>After climbing staircase after staircase, having had to make a detour as James had spotted Filch not too far away on the map, the two boys finally reached James destination, the top of the Astronomy tower. It was cold night and the wind blew ferociously through the open space. But the sky itself was perfectly clear and the stars glistened like little jewels across the black.</p><p>James walked over to the railing and sat down, throwing his legs out into the air and flopping his arms over the bar, Regulus lingered cautiously behind him standing staring out into the night.</p><p>‘It’s nice to sit here without having to draw the planets sometimes, you know? The dark is kinda beautiful when it’s not turned into school work.’</p><p>Regulus remained silent.</p><p>‘Sirius hates it, he says it like having his whole family watching him from afar, Remus likes it though, sometimes we sit up here at night and just look at it all, he likes looking at the sky when it not a f-.’</p><p>James stopped himself, why was he saying all of this? Regulus didn’t want to know it, he probably hated it as much as Sirius did, and why had he brought him here? What stupid part of him was making him share all of this with a Slytherin boy who had been known to be friends with the people James despised?</p><p>‘I come here too, sometimes.’</p><p>‘What?’</p><p>‘Yeah. That’s actually where I was headed tonight. Up here. Something about seeing all those stars up there… makes you feel..’</p><p>‘Less alone.’ James finished. Then he smiled ‘You’re not so bad you know Black.’</p><p>A glimmer of a smile crossed Regulus’ face.</p><p>‘You’re not so bad yourself Potter, Sirius is lucky, he found people who were as crazy and stupid as him.’</p><p>James laughed. ‘That he did. I’m only sorry you couldn’t have done the same.’ James regretted the remark instantly, as he saw Regulus’ face turn sour and a cold chill, unrelated to the wind, seemed to rush past.</p><p>‘We can’t all be Sirius, James. Some of us have to do what is right rather than what you want. Some of us actually care.’</p><p>‘I-I know Regulus I just meant-‘</p><p>‘I know what you meant. But it’s not your place to judge me or my friends. You shouldn’t stick your nose into stuff that is none of your business.’</p><p>‘I wasn’t sticking my nose in! I was just saying-‘</p><p>‘Whatever. This night has been creepy enough as it is, I’m not sticking around for you pity complex to kick in. I don’t need you or him trying to help me, I can look after myself.’</p><p>‘Regulus I-‘</p><p>‘Good night Potter.’</p><p>Regulus swept out of the tower so quickly James knew he would have to run if there was any hope of catching up with the boy, but he didn’t bother, he knew the Blacks well enough to know following them now would be a lost cause, and possibly dangerous. So he sat for a few minutes longer, watching the tiny dot that was Regulus walk back to the Slytherin common room and into bed on the map, before doing likewise.</p>
