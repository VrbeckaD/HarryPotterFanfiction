  <em> The wind speaks your name, Harry Potter. She sings your triumphs upon her zephyrs for all Visionaries to hear. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> She will come for you again, just as she came for your parents so many moons ago. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Tomorrow or seven years from now, someday. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> That is her promise. You shall return; you shall be reunited to her embrace.</em>
</p>

</blockquote><hr class="hr"/><p>Harry awakens with his heart thudding in his chest, the cupboard silent but for the sound of his own breaths. In and out, in and out…he calms, breathes slower and slower, as if to fall into the realm of slumber once more. The vague impressions of a haunting dream slip through his fingers like the desert sand, and though he tries to hold on with his small hands, they fade away like the others, leaving behind only the certainty of a feminine voice. It is just like the recurring visions of an unknown bespectacled man and a woman with sun-fire for hair, only this one is new.</p><p>If not for the man’s eyes, he might think him his own future self, they look so uncannily alike. They are a warm brown, warmer than Harry’s little cot under the stairs, unheated except for what drifts in through the grate.</p><p>Harry’s are a sharp, brilliant green, but most days they are clouded over with something dense and heavy, like overhanging clouds that threaten rain.</p><p>He shakes off the feeling. It is July 31<sup>st</sup>, 1991, and though it is his eleventh birthday, he knows he will receive nothing. No presents, no party, no cake, not even a wish, unlike his cousin Dudley.</p><p>It is the summer hols, the sun rising early and unhindered by dreary forecasts, and though he does not need to attend school, he should be waking up now to prepare breakfast as he always does, or Aunt Petunia will have things to say.</p><p>He stretches, splays his body across the sheets underneath, and almost knocks the covers over as his leg exceeds the bounds of his confinement. Over the edge and onto the floor, but without causing a ruckus, because Aunt Petunia wouldn’t like to be woken up early. Not by him.</p><p>He presses the door to his cupboard open just a crack, enough to check both ways for signs that someone else has awoken before him. There is no one, and there almost never is, but it pays to be sure.</p><p>He walks tiptoe, steps on hardwood muffled by the cotton of his socks, towards the kitchen. Brushing his teeth will come later. For this task, all that matters is that his hands are clean, and for that there is soap at the kitchen sink.</p><p>He lathers his hands thoroughly, humming to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" like those notices posted around the public loos advise him to.</p><p>He pats his hands dry on a dish towel hanging from the handle of the oven.</p><p>He will make pancakes, he decides, because those are a breakfast food that his Aunt and Uncle will not complain about. He will serve it with sickly sweet syrup, the pancakes drowned in it, and with bacon, sausage, and juice (for the Dursleys love to eat healthy, and it is one whole serving of Fruits and Vegetables), so much that even his Uncle and his cousin both cannot consume it all. If he is lucky, they will allow him to have the leftovers of the pancakes, and the thin, pretty little things will suffice as a replacement for all the birthday cakes he never had.</p><p>He hears a shuffling sound coming from the direction of the stairs. “Is that you, boy?” his Aunt says, voice muffled with the lingering crusts of sleep.</p><p>“Yes, Aunt Petunia,” he replies dutifully as he retrieves the pancake mix, the obligatory egg (“Just Add An Egg!” the packaging declares cheerfully), a mixing bowl, a spatula, and a non-stick pan. “I’m making breakfast.” He cracks the egg into the bowl, dumps in the mix (but not so carelessly that it throws up a cloud of dust, because if it did, he would be the one to clean it up), and stirs.</p><p>“Right, then,” his Aunt says, rubbing her eyes tiredly. “Say, isn’t today…” she trails off, before shaking her head and lumbering to the living room.</p><p>Five years ago, Harry might have held out the hope that she would at least remember and acknowledge the date of his birthday, if nothing else. But he knows better now.</p><p>The one time he tried to remind her, the morning he turned six, still thinking back on the great celebration his cousin had only five weeks previous, she promptly sat him down on the living room couch, clutching his wrist tightly.</p><p>“If you know what’s good for yourself, boy, you will never bring up the date that you, this scourge upon our family, was brought into the world again. Do you understand?”</p><p>He didn’t understand all the words at the time, but nodded anyway, the gist of the message ringing true through his mind.</p><p>July 31<sup>st</sup> is a day like any other, a day of sweltering summer sun and languid ladybirds, and it is most definitely not the birthday of the freak Harry Potter. Harry Potter, for all intents and purposes in their household, has no birthday, just as demons and other dread beings do not.</p><p>He turns on the stove, and the heating element glows orange. He places the pan on its surface to warm, and waits. Upstairs, he hears the sound of a tap running and water splashing. He drizzles a few drops of water on the pan. They sizzle and bounce around, skidding on the surface; it is hot enough.</p><p>As he prepares the breakfast, he is faintly aware of the sounds of his cousin’s family waking up and going through their morning routines, just like he himself is. He sets the table for three, plates the food in great big mounds, and waits for Dudley to thump down the stairs just as he finishes.</p><p>While they eat, he brushes his teeth, rinses his mouth, and washes his face.</p><p>After they are satiated, bellies full with the product of his tireless work (Aunt Petunia demands perfection, but sometimes Harry suspects he has become the better cook in her absence from the position), Harry is called to the table. He clears their used dishes, utensils, and napkins. Finally, out of their sight, he is granted a single pancake of his own, though without syrup, which is cheap (unlike maple, he knows from grocery runs to the market) and yet paradoxically too expensive for Harry Potter.</p><p>As he carefully cuts the pancake into quadrants, then octants, the doorbell rings.</p><p>His first gut instinct is to get out of the way; to hide so that whatever visitor his Uncle has does not have to lay eyes on his disgrace. His Uncle gives him a meaningful glare (<em> Keep quiet, do not show yourself </em>) as he passes by on his way to the front door.</p><p>On any other day, Harry would not risk being caught listening in on his Uncle’s conversation with the visitor, but on his birthday today, he feels almost compelled to. It is as if something in the air demands it, declaring that <em> something </em> or <em> everything </em> is about to change.</p><p>From around a corner, Harry hears the stranger speak. He does not dare to peek, lest he be seen and driven away.</p><p>“Good morning,” the man says, voice low and calm. “Vernon Dursley, I presume?”</p><p>Uncle Vernon must have seen something that stopped him in his tracks and froze him on the spot, because for a few stunned moments of silence, he says none of his usual platitudes. When he does speak, his speech is stunted, as if he were choking down something unpleasant.</p><p>“You…! You’re one of them freaks!” he splutters furiously. “I won’t have your kind encroaching on my home!”</p><p>“Oh no,” the man says patiently, as if he had not been called a freak only moments ago. “I will not impose on your hospitality any longer than I must. I am here to see your nephew, Harry Potter, and if you prefer, I can bring him elsewhere to speak with him. Goodness knows some fresh air will do wonders in this weather.” He pauses. “He is here, is he not? Harry?” he calls.</p><p>Harry, though already hidden from view, takes a step back in apprehension, remembering all the lessons on Stranger Danger and vicious criminals who kidnapped and sold children for money. He remembers his Uncle’s threats to abandon him on the streets, how his unique eyes would fetch a higher price. He knows his Uncle wouldn’t, because then the police would come and there would be inconvenient <em> questions </em>, but the fear hits home anyway.</p><p>Then he thinks of how the man’s voice is gentle and inviting and old like the nearby park’s familiar, ancient oak tree and the comforting shade it provides, like the kind grandfather Harry always wanted but never had.</p><p>Before he can respond, Aunt Petunia makes her appearance at the door.</p><p>“YOU!” she screeches, oddly reminiscent of her husband’s bellow a minute ago, only higher and shriller.</p><p>“Indeed,” the man says. “It is good to see you again, Petunia. I take it you have received my letter. Now, if I may, you will only have me in your hair a little longer…”</p><p>“Fine,” his Aunt says, shushing his Uncle’s protests. “If you must. But bring the boy back before dinner!”</p><p>“I daresay Harry would enjoy a better meal away from the company of your home,” the man says with a hint of knowing humour in his voice. “But do not worry. I will make sure he is returned safely.”</p><p>Harry hears his Aunt mutter something unintelligible under her breath.</p><p>“BOY!” she shouts in the direction of the dining room. “COME HERE!”</p><p>Harry suppresses a shudder at the volume of her voice and peers around the corner before stepping out entirely. Standing at the door is an elderly man clad in the strangest clothes, a flamboyant red that is entirely out of place for Little Whinging, as if he had come to life out of a children’s cartoon full of fire-breathing dragons and spell-slinging sorcerers. With his long beard and half-moon glasses, he resembles what Santa Claus might look like dressed for warmer weather than winter at the North Pole.</p><p>“Hello,” he says tentatively, unsure how to proceed.</p><p>“Well, come on, don’t just stand there,” his Aunt snaps, and he moves forward until he is standing at her side.</p><p>“This,” she says, gesturing towards the man with a jab of her finger, “is Albus Dumbledore, and he will be taking you out today to discuss your schooling. Behave yourself; we have no need for you making an embarrassment of us.”</p><p>“Dear me,” Dumbledore says, leaning down to look more closely at Harry’s face. “You have grown so much.”</p><p>“Have we met before, sir?” Harry asks. “I’m sorry if I’ve forgotten you, but I don’t recall…” he eyes Dumbledore’s clothes, almost certain that he would remember if he’d seen anyone dressed like that in real life before.</p><p>“Yes, in fact, but only when you were very young. I don’t expect you would remember. Now, come along,” he says, extending his hand towards Harry, “let’s not bother your aunt and uncle any more.”</p>
