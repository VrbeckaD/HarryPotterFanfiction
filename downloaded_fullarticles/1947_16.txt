    <p>The one thing that Draco could be certain of was that Harry was a <em>bastard</em>. </p><p>Well, maybe the word was too harsh, but Draco didn’t care. He had <em>promised</em> to write. After everything the four of them had gone through the previous year, and he goes completely silent. He allowed himself to be angry. He had gone far too long shoving his own emotions aside.</p><p>Note after note being left unanswered, and unsure of what he had done to deserve it all, Draco stopped writing after three weeks. What was the point of any of it? What was the point of all they had gone through? What was the point of them talking? What was the <em>point</em>?</p><p>He knew he was being illogical, but it is well known that when upset, the brain tends to push aside all rational thinking. And Draco found himself in a slump. No correspondence from someone he considered his best friend. He sighed and pushed the heel of his hand against his eyes like a child on the verge of a tantrum.</p><p>He was lucky for Hermione and Ron, Hermione particularly as she tended to brief him on all of the reading she was going over break – “I’ve picked quite a large tome, War and Peace, and you will be pleased to see that come this fall, I will have read it all, I’m sure.” – Ron often turning the conversation to Quidditch and whatever his older brothers were getting themselves into – “Charlie’s gone back to Romania, says a creature is there ‘awaiting his adventurous mind and carefree soul.’ Sometimes, I think he’s more dragon than wizard, and you can tell him I said that. He’d be thrilled.” Draco was grateful for them both.</p><p>It was not until he received letters from the two of them asking whether or no Harry had written to him, and he angrily responded that he had not. His angered lessened somewhat when he came to realize that he had not written to either of them as well, and instead is anger was replaced with the anxiety he had grown accustomed to feeling, now a state he was quite familiar with them. His replied to them went unanswered as well.</p><p> </p><p>And this is where he found himself, sitting inside while the August heat burned away outside, wallowing. Oh, what would his father think?</p><p>Oh, what would his father <em>say</em>? The answer being “nothing,” for his father had not spoken to him directly since the night he had arrived for summer vacation. Draco was not as bothered by it all as he once thought he would have been. He couldn’t help, actually, finding it somewhat amusing. He’d rendered his father mute. He should feel grateful for it.</p><p>Nights spent at the rather long dining table, his father seated at the head with his mother to his right and Draco to his left in some misplaced attempt at a noble setting, were awkward, the only sounds being the slight clattering of utensils and his mother’s occasional comments in his direction. He would smile politely, answer concisely, and return to his meal. There was no room for disobedience at the table, his father would not allow it. And if Draco did not respect the man, he still feared him, and he left him feeling defeated. When finished, he would dismiss Draco with a quick and cold wave of his hand, and he would rise from the table and venture off to the library.</p><p>Draco longed for nothing more than to be back home at Hogwarts. The realization when he first considered Hogwarts his home felt like slap in the face, but the sting of it was not entirely unpleasant. Hogwarts was his home, and he yearned for its comforts.</p><p>He found himself in the library again, several weeks off from returning to Hogwarts, when the first owl he’s seen in months come crashing through the threshold of the manor. The <em>menace</em>. It was Narcissa, however, who came to collect the note that was wound hastily around the bird’s foot. Her expression dropped to a scowl at the handwriting as Draco came to stand by her side. Two words printed neatly: “Molly Wealsey.” Draco glanced around nervous but nodded.</p><p>“Open it,” he said quietly, and she carefully tore open the letter with a “hrmpf.”</p><p> “Weasley’s asked you over, much to the dismay of Arthur and Molly,” she muttered, a sneer clear in her voice. Draco smiles despite himself. “He asks if…Potter has written at all,” she continues before she places a hand on her son’s shoulder.</p><p>“Wipe off that smirk, we – I cannot allow you to go,” and Draco shakes out of her grasp. “It would not be wise.” Draco huffed, but Narcissa ignored him, commanding the nearest house elf to find her paper and a quill. “I’ll write fast.” Draco turned on his heel, and sulked away, his mother calling out behind her, “Best not to tell Father about this.”</p><p>He watches as his mother all but chucks the original note into the hearth before sending the Weasley on its way back home, a new note attached to its claw.</p>
<hr/><p> One week passes. The Weasleys are oddly silent, and Draco fills his days soaking up the books in the library. He’s particularly interested in the history books his father keeps, but he aches for Hermione’s classics.</p><p>Another week passes. Summer vacation is fast coming to a close, and Draco has quietly started packing for his departure. As much as he dreads it, he knows his father will be taking him to the platform for appearance sake, his mother following close behind keeping others away. He wonders what his father will say, and what he will say in response. He can only hope it will be something clever. He tucks away more clothing and slips a book about banshees into the bottom of his trunk.</p><p>Yet another week. August shifts into September, but the weather stays the same. The sticky humid air outside is enough to keep Draco indoors. His father keeps away, and for the first time, Draco wonders what he is doing with his free time. His mother is often wandering the house, tending to the garden, sipping tea in the kitchen, but his father hardly leaves his study. Every so often, he sees a house elf slip inside, never for too long, and leaving paler then when they entered. He catches glimpses of his father’s dark cloak turning the corners, acting as much the spectral of death in his own house.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Draco finds himself nostalgic during his final week. With no recent news from any of his friends, he feels like a scared eleven-year-old once more, lonely and silent. He is no longer as obedient as he was once, and he gets a sick sense of satisfaction at seeing his father turn away from him in the brief moments they come together. Nevertheless, he’s anxious. He’s ready to go.</p>
<hr/><p>The following morning, Draco and his mother make their way out of the manor quietly, leaving his father behind as they so often do now. Hogwarts list in hand, the two of them travel silently through Diagon Alley.</p><p>“You’ve already an owl, a wand, we mustn’t go there once more,” his mother mutters soundlessly to herself, her eyes roving over the letter in her hands. </p><p>Draco keeps his eyes forward and is not oblivious to the looks that are every now and then tossed in his directions. He stands tall, the apprehension creeping back into his mind. It would not take much for a group to ambush the two delicate Malfoys as they stand alone. He’s determined not to let anything show through his body language. He stands closer to his mother.</p><p>“It’s quite a book list this year,” he says, pointing to the titles at the bottom of the page, “Perhaps Flourish and- “He cuts himself off as a voice rings out. </p><p>“Ah Harry! We were hoping you’d only gone one grate too far!” Draco freezes or a moment, his mother looking at him quizzically, and he knows he’s smiling like an idiot, and he speeds up.</p><p>“Draco?” he mother asks, but she follows behind nonetheless, and soon they are standing near the front windows of the popular shop. His mother looks around disdainfully. “Quite a lot of people hear this morning…” She stops in front of the shop marquee. “Oh Merlin.” <em>“Now featuring: Gildroy Lockhart”</em> is written on the board in a neat cursive handwriting, and Draco steps inside, pressing past the mass of people who have not walked in further than the threshold. He hears familiar voices.</p><p>“It was him, I swear. Same colored hair. Mean-looking. Was trying to sell something.” Harry. “Draco wasn’t with him thought. I wonder…” Draco found himself freezing once more, feeling his eyebrows raise involuntarily. Father? There would be time late. He’s make sure to ask. Right now, he just had to get a little further…</p><p>“Draco!” The voice is neither his mother’s, nor Harry’s. Draco turns to see an enthusiastic Hermione running towards him, launching herself into his arms, oblivious to the thoughts swirling about in his head. Draco grips onto her for a moment, a giddy look on his face that he does not bother hiding. “I didn’t see you come in!” She cuts herself off with a quick glance behind Draco, and he turns to see his father walking into the shop. “Guess Harry didn’t misunderstand.” He turns, and drags her forward by her elbow.</p><p>“Ignore him,” he says, his voice thankfully masked by the other shoppers desperate to get a look at the fair haired handsome man surrounded by stacks and stacks of books. Hermione nods, always understanding, and it’s her turn to drag him off to the side.</p><p>“Harry, Ron!” she says excitedly, the two turning around in confusion before grins break out onto their faces. A younger girl stood to the left of Ron, her bright hair giving her away.</p><p>“<em>Draco</em>,” Harry says easily, and Draco is immediately taken aback by several things at once. Hey boy is front of him stands much taller than before, his clothes the same from the previous year. Second, he’s filthy. He makes another note to ask later. Third, Harry’s voice had dropped, the scratchiness of it leaving Draco flushed. Harry holds out a hand, and without glancing behind, Draco pulls him into a hug. He holds on for a moment longer than he should.</p><p>“You’re taller than me now,” he teases, and messes with his already rustled hair. He clasps a hand on Ron’s shoulder, a “hello, mate” already in the air. “Positively lanky.” Harry’s face turns pink, and Draco ducks his head. What was he doing? Harry opens his mouth to say something but closes it. Draco glances behind him, and sees his father looking over the crowd. Looking for him.</p><p>“I saw him earlier,” Harry begins but Draco shakes his head.</p><p>“Later, please,” he asks, a slight shake to his voice that Harry was always able to pick up on immediately. Harry nods, and smiles at him.</p><p>“I’m happy to see you.” Draco scratches at the back of his head, the corners of his lips raised, heat on his cheeks. Any bitter thoughts, any anger at Harry’s unresponsiveness dissipated.</p><p>“I’m happy too.” He feels awkward for a moment, unable to stop hiding his face behind his hands. He wanted to say something else, anything else. He hadn’t see the boy in months, and all he could say was <em>“I’m happy too?”</em> He went to open his mouth, but a voice at the back of the shop spoke over everyone else.</p><p>“Gilderoy Lockhart!”</p><p>Draco suppressed a groan and walked to the store front with an eye roll, Hermione, Ron and Harry following, Ginny trailing close to Ron. “You could not pay me anything to stand there and listen to that man speak.” Hermione shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said shyly, looking back at him, “He’s rather handsome, don’t you think?” Draco couldn’t help but laugh. </p><p>“Mother?” The crowded store continued to drown out his voice in the sea of people, and it was difficult to see over.</p><p>“Draco.” <em>Father</em>. Wonderful. He felt tension raise around him and the trio, but he continued forward. “Your mother and I have been waiting for you.” Draco stood up straighter. <em>Soldier</em>.</p><p>“I was catching up with my friends.” His father took a deep breath.</p><p>“I see,” he sneered, his gaze falling to Harry. “-that despite my wishes, you’re still mingling with these people.” He lifted his cane to his hand, pointing it forward towards Harry. “I believe we haven’t met face to face as of yet. Lucius Malfoy.” He did not hold out his hand in greeting. Harry remained nonplussed.</p><p>“I know who you are Mr. Malfoy,” Harry said defiantly, and Draco fought to keep his expression neutral. “Draco has told us much about you.”</p><p>Draco watched as his father’s jaw clenched, and he shivered. “I’m sure he has,” he said grimly, and he took a step forward, “And there is much I know about you, Mr. Potter.” The cane came up to brush Harry’s bangs out of his eyes, revealing the scar underneath. “And of your…history,” he sneered, “with the man who give you this.”</p><p>“Voldemort,” and even Lucius flinched, albeit, somewhat more diplomatically than Draco, “He killed my parents. He was nothing but a cruel, sadistic murderer.”</p><p>Lucius sighed, an air of impressiveness around him. “You say his name freely. I wonder if you do so naively or whether you are more of an imbecile than I had imagined.”</p><p>A small frame pushed past him, and the younger girl stood in front of his father.</p><p>“L-leave him alone,” Ginny said somewhat meekly, a hand wrapped around Harry’s arm. Harry looked down at their entwined arms, a blush on his cheeks and he smiled, to which Ginny blushed back. Draco felt a heaviness in his stomach. He blinked.</p><p>“Oh look Harry, got yourself a girlfriend.” Beside him, Ron laughed, but Lucius stood stern in front of him, before reaching out in front of him to tug at Ginny’s cauldron, a metallic sound ringing out.</p><p>“And it looks to me as if I’m in the presence of Weasleys,” he mocked, before stepping back and turning, his cloak swirling around his body. “Perhaps one day, you will learn that the presence of Mudbloods is not one to be cherished, but extinguished.” He pushed the door open,  the bell resonating violently as it slapped back against the frame, leaving the five students to stand, feeling nauseous at the encounter.</p><p>Harry turned to Draco, an unanswered question hanging between them – are you alright? – before he spotted Gildreoy Lockhart pushing through the crowd.</p><p>“I must absolutely see this Potter,” he was boasting as he pushed back his hair. “Perchance we could trade war stories.” Draco grabbed Harry’s arm, and motioned for the others, exhaling harshly as his stomach remained in knots.<br/>
<br/>
“We need to get out of here before that bastard catches up.”</p>
<hr/><p> The four of them wandered down the cobblestoned street of Diagon Alley, Ginny returning to her mother, and not that he would say so aloud, but Draco found it immensely pleasing to be away from her. He didn’t allow himself to think about the reasoning. They quickly gathered the rest of their school supplies, exhausting catching up to them prematurely, and they were forced to say their goodbyes.</p><p>“Where are you staying?” Draco asked as Hermione reluctantly made her way back to her parents, and Harry nodded in Ron’s direction.</p><p>“The Weasleys kindly brought me in,” Harry said, and Draco felt at ease.</p><p>“And the Dursleys'?” Draco asked. Harry smirked.</p><p>“Won’t even notice that I’m gone.” Ron stood next to him, looking on the verge of cackling.</p><p>“That blasted man will be feeling that fall in the morning,” Ron laughed, and Draco wanted to question them but held his tongue.</p><p>“I don’t want to know,” he laughed, a hand on Ron’s shoulder. “Or tell me later. Can’t stop you either way.” Draco stepped back and looked at the two of them. “I’ll see you both tomorrow, yeah?” Both boys nodded.</p><p>“We’re finally going home.”</p>
<hr/><p> The three Malfoys made their way to Platform ¾, all walking close together, Lucius’ shoulders pushed back in arrogance. With eyes on him from what seems like every direction, his mother tucks his hair back, and corrects his tie. It’s more than she’s done in months, and he soaks in the final few moments with her before she is yanked back to that dark house by a malevolent man. He straightens his shoulders, lifting his chin as he turns to his father, forcing him to look him in the eye. There were no consequences.</p><p>“Another year,” Draco tries, and his father nods stiffly. Draco presses. “Come now, father. There’s eyes on us. You could at least pretend that you’re not disappointed in your son.”</p><p>“Draco-“ his father warns, but Draco cuts him off.</p><p>“I know it must be so shameful to have a Gryffindor in your family,” he continues, his father’s jaw quivering in anger as Draco enunciates his words. “A <em>black</em> smear on the family. More shameful, perhaps, than to have a former death eater in its ranks, yes?”</p><p>His father’s gaze slammed into him, his eyes giving off the illusion of being white hot, pupils dilated in fury. Draco could see his finger twitch and he frowned. “Not here, father.”</p><p>“You, you shameful loathsome creature.” The words were almost immediately brushed off his shoulders. He turns his back on his father, looking up at his mother.</p><p>“Write me, will you?” She nodded tersely. “I’ll write directly home now.” Another nod. “You’ll be alright, won’t you?” His mother looked down between them, that being answer enough. Unsure of where this confidence had come from, could feel it draining from him in pools, and Draco inhaled, held it, and exhaled it carefully. He gave no further goodbye except a curt wave behind him, and he boarded the train.</p><p> </p><p>As if stepping through to another world, where the corridor were full of light, the hallways were bustling with students, new and old, the younger looking frantic as they searched for a compartment.</p><p>“This is when you make friends. It’s all about first impressions!” Two students pushed past him. </p><p>“Life isn’t like your books Colin. Just find a place to see.” The bright light shone in through the windows, and Draco felt on air, disconnected, his feet moving him as his brain disagreed. He knew most of what he father said were empty threats, his safety guaranteed by his distance from the manor. But his mother’s safety was not ensured. He feared for her. He knew he was getting caught up in it all, the tell-tale sign of his fingertips turning numb and his thoughts static as he became overwhelmed. <em>Shameful shameful even your inner voice has abandoned you nothing is permanent in your life you push everything and everyone away he will never he will never -  </em></p><p>“Draco?” He paused, Hermione standing in front of him with a wide grin on her face. He tried to smile back, but none of it reached his eyes. She reached for his hand, her eyebrows pinched in. She kept silent, her touch grounding as she led them into an empty compartment, and Draco could hear her say, far away, “Everywhere else is full.” She closed the compartment, and after a moment’s hesitation, dimmed the glass. It was just the two of them. “Draco…talk to me.”</p><p>And he wanted to. He wanted to. But when he opened his mouth to speak, the words didn’t come. Nothing came. No tears, no heavy breathing, no shaking. He felt empty, a shell. His father had allowed him to be strong, but only in his presence. He felt hollow. He shook his head, and he saw Hermione exhale, a sadness spreading across her features, and Draco was sure that if he was ever able to feel again, he would have cried. She settled back against the seat.</p><p>“I’ll be here when you’re ready.” Draco felt appreciative for friendship, and he forced himself to smile.</p><p>Outside, the train whistled sounded loudly, warning for its departure, and the smell of smoke and haze filled the platform. Slowly at first before gradually getting to speed, the express pulled out of the station, the gently <em>chug-chug</em> of the wheels almost putting Draco to sleep. He closed his eyes, his shoulders popping as he stretched, Hermione electing to flip through one of her many books as the long journey began. Silence filled the compartment save for the occasional page flip, and Draco felt uneasy.</p><p>“Hermione?” She glanced up at him, confusion evident on her face, and Draco looked at her with knitted eyebrows. He gestured around the compartment, hoping that she’d understand, and he knew she did judging by how wide her eyes became.</p><p>“Where’s Harry and Ron?”</p>
