    <p>Daphne Greengrass was at her boiling point. Over the course of her day things had been getting progressively worse; she'd overslept this morning, been late to Charms class as a result and received a mark down for it, hit her head on a low-hanging torch in the dungeons in her rush to get to <em>this</em> lesson on time, and was now receiving detention <em>in</em> said lesson.</p><p>Okay so... in the big picture, her problems weren't the absolutely <em>worst,</em> but… it had been a long day.</p><p>She had been paired with Gryffindor's Golden Boy, Harry-Perfect-Potter, in today's Potion's lesson. Which fair enough, she could handle. She didn't particularly like him, but outside from his famed messiah complex, he'd never done anything to her personally. Unlike most wizards and witches in her house, Daphne attempted to keep above the rivalry Slytherin and Gryffindor shared. She considered herself a student prodigy, and found the whole thing to be beneath her. But saying all this, any suspicions of dislike she had about him now were confirmed.</p><p>"I shan't hear another word of it. You'll both serve after school detentions with me for the rest of the week!" Professor Snape had snapped.</p><p>Her priority now was remaining calm. She had a reputation among the professors as one of the schools best students, scornfully second only to Hermione Granger. She never got into trouble during lessons, and right now she refused to dig herself any deeper. She was an adult and would rise above it. She wasn't about to cause a second incident over plain pettiness.</p><p>Although Daphne Greengrass was her birth name, she was known to a lot of the schools population by a different name: the Ice Queen. She was known for being famously cold and antisocial to her fellow classmates, and truth be told, it wasn't a nickname she terribly minded. It kept those that she didn't care for away, and let's face it, sounded pretty cool. Daphne never deliberately intended for her attitude to come across the way it did, she just knew the importance of putting her education before her personal life. And her classmates interpreting that as her being antisocial, frankly, was not her problem. It was their decision to give her that nickname, but it had been hers to roll with it.</p><p>"<em>Friends are just distractions!</em>" she'd once heard Pansy Parkinson say while doing an (admittedly, quite good) impression of her. Daphne wasn't on bad terms with any of her classmates, but she thought of them more than acquaintances than her friends. Her friendship circle was in fact, extremely limited, including only her younger sisters.</p><p>"Yes, Professor," she mumbled scornfully. "<em>Sorry</em>, Professor."</p><p>She'd go to these detentions and get them over with. But she would make it clear she was attending under protest.</p><p>Now the room had emptied and she and Potter stood alone before their Potions Master. When their potion had gone up in flames it had exploded, releasing thick fumes into the air, most of which still lingered. Humidity was at a peak, forcing sweat from her brow and several other places. That was another thing that contributed to surrendering her argument; she was absolutely boiling and really couldn't afford the added stress.</p><p>"Sir, not to sound bad or anything, but why exactly am I here?" A voice said beside her.</p><p>Daphne caught herself repressing the urge to growl.</p><p>"As I have <em>already</em> said," Snape was growing impatient. "You and Miss Greengrass <em>failed</em> to complete your potion, and <em>succeeded</em> in ruining my lesson with your distraction. Ten points from Gryffindor for speaking out of turn."</p><p>It was clear Potter didn't mind escalating this into something more, which further annoyed her. The last thing she wanted was Umbridge involving herself, that would really be the final nail in the coffin. But then again, it was him that made the error in their ingredients, so it made sense that he'd feel the need to drag it out, more than likely to avoid the blame being place on him.</p><hr/><p>Harry groaned.</p><p>Not only had he been <em>wrongly</em> accused of exploding his potion, now he was facing an hour's detention to rebrew it. And with a Slytherin nonetheless? Granted he'd never formally spoken to this one, but Harry had yet to meet a Slytherin he didn't despise, and a nickname like hers didn't just happen by accident.</p><p>Harry recalled back when he'd been given his first detention by Snape, during first year.</p><p>He'd been utterly mortified.</p><p>Since then he'd lost count of how many hours he'd spent sat in this man's classroom. Even Hermione had stopped getting surprised by it now. As their class had filed out of the room, she reacted no differently to any of the other times he'd received detention, and just watched with a look that said 'see you in the common room'. Ron on the other hand, he and the Weasley twins seemed to have a competition between over who could get into the most trouble with Snape. A competition Harry wasn't aware he had entered, or that he was apparently in the lead.</p><p>He looked down at his watch.</p><p>4:00 pm.</p><p>It wasn't that bad... if Snape kept his word and let him go in an half an hour, he'd still have some free time before curfew. An hour of Quidditch, or maybe somewhere with Ron and Hermione. He and Ginny hadn't gotten to spend a lot of time together this year since they started seeing each other, so that's probably where his priorities should lay. Frankly at this point, he'd rather settle for Aragog.</p><p>He looked over to the student next to him, and like any teen boy would, briefly examined her figure.</p><p>Being a Slytherin didn't mean she couldn't be attractive -and blimey- calling her attractive would be an insult. She wore the basic Hogwarts uniform, but with slight... adjustments. Her skirt ended just before her knee-length green and silver socks began, giving a peep-hole view of her thighs. Her blonde hair had frizzed out and now trailed down her back, disregarding the usual rules that long hair was to be put in a bun during lesson. And there was something else; she was redder than a Weasley family reunion. At first Harry suspected she had caught his wandering eyes, but then he had caught onto how humid the dungeon air was around them.</p><p>He loudly coughed. It wasn't like him to be that crude. He forced his eyes away from his potions partner and focused on someone on the opposite end of the spectrum: Snape.</p><p>"Today, tomorrow and Friday I will expect you both to return to this room for half an hour's detention. During that time you will complete the potion, and if it's anything less than perfect you will both fail this unit. Have I made myself clear?" They nodded. "Good. I take it you already know the ingredients and where to get them. If you need me, I shall be in the staff room trying to enjoy the rest of my night. <em>Try</em> not need me. I'll be back when time is up, and when I return I expect the potion to be over halfway completed. Questions?"</p><p>The two shook their heads in unison and watched as the potions master left.</p><p>"Merlin, the heat in here is unbearable," Daphne said, mostly to herself.</p><p>"<em>Think</em> that's our fault…" Harry forced an awkward laugh. When his laugh went ignored, he simply turned his attention towards their cauldron.</p><p>"Well, let's get on with it."</p><p>Daphne rolled her eyes, and muttered something under her breath.</p><p>Harry scowled at her. He'd not been around her more than a few minutes but already go the impression she was up herself. Reluctantly, living with the Dursleys had given him a high annoyance threshold, so he but didn't rise to it. A good thing as well, as the temperature in the room was increasing by the minute. Not to mention the air itself felt like drinking soup. Neither of them wanted to be here, and he was sure one thing they could agree on was they both wanted to get out of here as quickly and as calmly as possible.</p><p>He collected up the first ingredient from the table and began separating them into the cauldron.</p><p>Daphne fanned at her face, her cool exterior betraying nothing of the stressed and annoyed girl underneath. Her eyes wandered over to her potions partner.</p><p>She admitted, he was cute. She didn't believe in dating classmates, but that didn't mean she wasn't allowed to look. Gryffindor or not, Harry Potter was fit, end of. Unfortunately she hadn't had time to divert her eyes before he caught her staring at him. She looked away, embarrassment written across her face.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"None of your business."</p><p>Harry took a look back at the cauldron, then back at her.</p><p>"You going to help?"</p><p>Her immediate response to his question was to grind her teeth together.</p><p>Apparently, Potter had a mouth on him today.</p><p>Well two could play at that game.</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Well I'm not doing all the work again."</p><p>Daphne's eyebrows snapped up to the ceiling. A flare of temper inside her ignited, and this time she didn't have the self control to ignore it.</p><p>"Again? You did absolutely nothing today bar make childish faces at Weasel from across the room?"</p><p>Harry frowned.</p><p>"And you just sat and watched? You literally put your feet up?"</p><p>"We had <em>finished</em> by the time I rested, I'll remind you," she said through her teeth. "And the only reason we finished early was because you had <em>me</em> working with you. In fact, you know what, no," Daphne shook her head.</p><p>She was better than this; she wasn't going to get involved with this boys childishness and risk further detention time. She gritted her teeth, rolled up her sleeves and forced a smile.</p><p>"What ingredients do you need?"</p><p>Harry stared at her coldly.</p><p>"The Chizpurfle carapaces... I think they're under there," he pointed across the room.</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>Harry's glare became one to rival a Basilisk.</p><p>He knew exactly what she was trying to do. He knew, but he really couldn't find the effort in him to argue it. He wasn't going to scoop to her level and risk getting in further trouble with Snape when he returned.</p><p>"The Chizpurfle carapaces, <em>p</em><em>lease</em>."</p><p>Daphne smiled at him sweetly and turned on her heels. She skipped over to the table cabinet and bent down. Harry attempted to divert his eyes, but found them drawn to the girls figure yet again. He lightly coughed to himself.</p><p>The heat must be really getting to him.</p><p>"There you go," Daphne handed him the ingredients. "What else do you need, daddy?"</p><p>A hot flush hit Harry, and his mouth spoke before his brain was able to silence it.</p><p>"Greengrass, can we <em>just </em>get this finished? I don't want to be here anymore than you do."</p><p>Daphne had only just taken her seat before she was instantly on her feet again.</p><p>"Indeed, and if you hadn't have pushed me I wouldn't have dropped the bottle in the cauldron and we wouldn't <em>be</em> here, would we?"</p><p>The speed her words came out indicated she'd said that all on a single, forced-out breath.</p><p>"I didn't push you, I was trying to squeeze past you."</p><p>Daphne raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Was that a fat joke? Because I don't think you're in any position to be body shaming anybody with that ugly scar on your forehead."</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>"I <em>wasn't </em>calling you fat. You're not fat. I meant you were stood in my way, you <em>should</em> have been paying attention."</p><p>"Mmhmm. Next time focus less on my figure and maybe then you can pay attention to what you're doing."</p><p>Harry looked away, blushing. She had officially succeeded in making him uncomfortable. He gave her a disgusted look. He opened and closed his mouth like a goldfish, unable to find his words. He looked at her, back at the cauldron, than back at her. Breaking the exchange, he returned to the cauldron and began shuffling blindly through ingredients.</p><p>"So no apology?"</p><p>"I <em>just </em>want to get this done," he pleaded.</p><p>There was a desperation in his voice that pleaded mercy. Truth be told, Daphne herself didn't know why she was getting so determined to argue, but decided to let the train ride. She'd deal with the repercussions later, right now she just had a lot of pent up energy and needed somewhere to direct it. She approached him from behind.</p><p>"You don't get to call me fat then act like nothing happened. Didn't your mother teach you how to treat a lady?"</p><p>The second the words left her mouth she realized she shouldn't have spoken.</p><p>She <em>definitely</em> shouldn't have spoken.</p><p>What was she doing? Why was she deliberately trying to patronize him? He was absolutely right, neither of them wanted to be there and they should just work together to get it over with. So why the hell did she just say that? She wasn't <em>that</em> harsh. What had come over her?</p><p>Now it was Harry's turn to make to her feel uncomfortable. As she opened her mouth to apologize, he span around.</p><p>"I'm surprised <em>you</em> have nerve to talk about parents."</p><p>She furrowed her brow.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"I saw your father there, the night Voldemort returned."</p><p>Daphne winced at the name.</p><p>Her first instinct was to correct him, but she caught her words in her throat. Still reeling from the low blow she'd just dealt him, she decided it was probably best to not push it.</p><p>"That isn't true."</p><p>"If it's not true why did I see him there?"</p><p>"You did not."</p><p>"Yes I did."</p><p>"<em>No</em>, you didn't. You don't even know what he looks like, so drop it."</p><p>Her voice was quieter noticeably quieter. She was on the defensive, not only because she was absolutely right, but now the roles had reversed and it was her who wanted to get back on with the lesson.</p><p>"About 6 foot? Blonde hair? Goatee?" Harry gestured to his height, hair and face.</p><p>A fire suddenly surged through Daphne's veins.</p><p>She pushed him back across the cauldron, closing in inches away from his face. During their argument the two had gotten very close, and their words now became harsh whispers.</p><p>"You are making some <em>wild</em> accusations, Potter."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"You <em>shut up</em> about my family," she snapped. "At least I <em>have</em> one."</p><p>The two couldn't move any closer now.</p><p>During their argument they'd been approaching each other -and unless one of them was a ghost, they'd reached the end of the line. Their legs were intertwined and their noses pressed against each other. Their faces were steaming red with anger, ready to attack.</p><p>Daphne's chest was pushed up against Harry's ribs, and for a split second, his eyes flickered down. An eyeful of the girls exposed cleavage was enough to activate his beta male instincts and make him look away, dragging his eyes back to hers. But his glance hadn't been subtle in this slightest, and it was immediately apparent she'd seen him look. But despite Daphne's flushing cheeks, she didn't pull away.</p><p>The whole time they had been arguing, they'd been aware of the heat around them, both metaphorically and physically.</p><p>What they hadn't been paying attention to, however, was the source producing the heat. Behind Harry, their ruined potion had been bubbling away, releasing fumes and gases into the dungeon air for most of the day. The gas drifted upwards filling the room and being allowed the chance to ferment, before now being inhaled by the two of them. Clearly, whatever potion was attempting to be made during their lesson, they had failed at making it. And by sheer accident, they had given birth to something else. Something which affects were already taking their toll.</p><p>Though they were too preoccupied to notice it, they had both become light-headed, and their bodies numb to the environment around them. It was like being drunk, but also not.</p><p>A sudden hormonal rage began brewing in both of them.</p><p>Anger, and rage... but it wasn't bad. It was passion. It was <em>ecstasy</em>. And... it felt good.</p><p>Like the potion, an instinct deep inside them had been steadily building, bubbling away, and had finally broken it's way to the surface.</p><p>With force, they sealed the distance between them. Daphne grabbed the back of Harry's head and pressed her lips against his. Her tongue dove into his mouth and was met instantly with his own. The two let out a mutual gasp of satisfaction, He wrapped his arms tightly around the girls waist and pulled her in, returning the kiss.</p><p>It wasn't enough.</p><p>They wanted more.</p><p>There was liquid magma pumping through their veins. With a sudden jump, she wrapped her legs around Harry's torso and lifted herself onto him. She hadn't even waited to see if he was strong enough to lift her weight, which thankfully he was. She just wanted him in this moment. Him, <em>all</em> of him. The was no world around her. Just her and Potter. Just Potter. And he hadn't missed his chance. With hands like lightening, he'd grabbed two handfuls of the girls read-end, steadying her/ At his touch, Daphne's head seemed to explode with an climax of pleasure. She moaned softly and smiled into his lips.</p><p>The heat around them was swallowing the two up. Their heartbeats become earthquakes around them, and only the sound of their shared, shallow breaths filled the air. They were both trembling with guilty desire, but damn... did it feel right!</p><p>Yes! Yes!</p><p>Harry broke away and began to plant kisses down her neck. A fragile whimper was the only response she managed. A restless hand leaked away from the back of his head and began to explore the rest of his body in a way no woman had done before. Her other hand forced down on him, forcing his kissing deeper into her neck crevasse. He bit gently at her neck, and another tidal wave of excited pleasure swept over her. She bit down hard on her bottom lip, cursing.</p><p>Harry released her neck and dove into another wet kiss. She began grinding her top half against his chest. Her movements instilled a primal-like grunt off Harry, a noise she'd never imagine a boy like him to make, which it did nothing but add further heat to their kiss.</p><p>Daphne suddenly pulled apart, shaking her head to brush aside a stray hair that had began to join in on their kissing. Harry turned on his heels, swinging the girl around placing her on the rim of the cauldron. He pulled his hands out from beneath her and began feeling his way around her body as she had done to him.</p><p>"Ohhh my..." she moaned.</p><p>Daphne tugged off her black cloak. Her white shirt suddenly seemed a lot tighter than it did earlier, as if begging to be pulled off.</p><p>"WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?"</p><p>Harry was then grabbed by the shoulders and torn him viciously from his partner. Frightened, dazed and confused, the boy fell to the floor as all feelings of lust and excitement vanished in an instant.</p><p>He looked up, as a thousand realities seemed to hit him at once.</p><p>Daphne was still on the cauldron, legs open from where she had been pulling him close. Snape was looking between the two, mouth hanging agape. In any other situation, seeing him in this state would have been hilarious. He looked like he'd caught the two students committing a murder.</p><p>And maybe in some way, he had done.</p><p>The implications of what the two had just descended upon them like a train, and their looks of shock were replaced with terror and guilt.</p><p>"Potter! Greengrass!" The Professor practically screamed. "Dormitories, now! Get the <em>hell</em> out of my classroom!"</p><p>The two didn't have to be told twice.</p><p>Daphne scrambled to grab her fallen cloak and tie and took off in a run towards the door, with Harry following closely behind. As the door slammed shut behind them, the two didn't even stop to acknowledge each other in the corridor and they ran quickly in opposite directions. Daphne, deeper into the dungeons, Harry, up to Gryffindor tower.</p><p>He didn't stop running until he reached the seventh floor. With each step towards the Fat Lady, reality became heavier and heavier on his shoulders. He couldn't begin to describe how he felt.</p><p>Disgusted.</p><p>Validated.</p><p>A traitor.</p><p>Ashamed.</p><p>
  <em>A cheat.</em>
</p><p>He was a cheat.</p><p>He'd cheated on Ginny. True, they weren't <em>official</em> official, but they'd been talking. They'd kissed. They were a thing.</p><p>And he'd cheated on her. With <em>Daphne Greengrass</em>.</p><p>
  <em>"Password?"</em>
</p><p>"What?"</p><p>He had appeared at the Fat Lady way quicker than he had noticed. And quicker than he had wanted.</p><p><em>"Password?"</em> she repeated.</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>"Sorry, Aspin."</p><p>
  <em>"Granted."</em>
</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>Harry took off running again, and went head-first into the group of people he least wanted to see right now.</p><p>Hermione and Ron were sat on the sofa, with Ginny perched on the arm beside them. They appeared to be deep in conversation. It didn't take them long to notice they weren't alone.</p><p>"Harry, whatever's the matter?" Hermione asked, clearly noticing Harry's state.</p><p>"Nothing!"</p><p>He began to shout, but caught himself. He took a breath.</p><p>"Just… tired. I'm just tired. Ran the whole way up."</p><p>"You sure mate? Look like you've seen a ghost," Ron said, standing up.</p><p>Ginny laughed.</p><p>"That's a <em>pretty</em> silly expression when you think about it about where we live."</p><p>Harry laughed, and nodded nervously.</p><p>"Yeah well... you know what that greasy git is like, doesn't know where to stop."</p><p>His friends looked at him as though he'd spoken to them in a different language.</p><p>"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Harry shrugged her off, still nodding.</p><p>"I'm fine, just tired. I'm gonna turn in early."</p><p>Before the group had time to react, Harry moved past them and ran up to the boy's dormitory. He crossed the dorm in four large steps and collapsed his face first into his pillow. His thoughts from earlier continued to echo in his head.</p><p>He was a cheat.</p><p>A cheater. He had <em>cheated</em> on his girlfriend. He'd cheated on his best friend's sister.</p><p>With <em>Daphne Greengrass</em>.</p><p>He couldn't control himself. It was just like something had taken over him. One minute they were arguing, the next minute… If Snape hadn't had interrupted them, Harry had no doubt they'd have gone all the way. In that moment he had wanted nothing more than her, <em>all</em> of her. He didn't know what came over him. He'd never even been that intimate with a girl before, the most he and Ginny had done was heavy petting and weak kisses. Yet he'd been so in control and forceful, but at the same time, a million miles away from what he was doing. It felt like it had been a dream, like he wasn't in control of his own body.</p><p>And it felt so <em>right</em>. It was a trance, like he was drunk on her. It only lasted for a few seconds, but the world and its rules had melted away and all he wanted in that moment was <em>her</em>. Just Greengrass. That had worn off the second Snape had interrupted them, and now he did have to deal with the consequences.</p><p>He rolled over and stared at his ceiling.</p><p>He'd cheated. It was only a kiss… Well, and some heavy petting. It didn't mean anything, but it didn't change the situation. He'd betrayed Ginny's trust. He didn't know how he did it, or why, but he couldn't take it back. This was going to break her. How the hell was he going to tell her? <em>Could</em> he even tell her? If he did, no doubt it would be the end for them. And then Ron? Harry doubted he'd stay friends with the guy who broke his sister's heart. And if Ron and Ginny left him, Hermione would follow. He would lose everything because of this.</p><p>Harry sighed. He knew the reality of the situation was rapidly becoming obvious.</p><p>He couldn't tell her. He could <em>never</em> tell her. He'd have to take this to his grave.</p><p>He didn't know how or why it had happened. But it had. It had happened, and now it was in the past. It was over now and it hadn't changed anything. Their relationship hadn't changed, he still felt the same way towards Ginny he always had. What she didn't know wouldn't hurt her, right?</p><p>Harry's heart sank as the realization of what he'd just become dawned on him.</p><p>On the bright side, he didn't ever have to see or speak to Daphne Greengrass again. Without her in his life, he could move past this and forget. He could probably fool himself into believing this was all one big, messed up dream.</p><p>
  <em>"Today, tomorrow and Friday I will expect you both to return to this room for an hour's detention."</em>
</p><p>"Ughhhhh."</p>
