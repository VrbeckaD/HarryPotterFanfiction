    <p>He arrived to the rendezvous point panting and slightly out of breath and, embarrassingly, nearly loosing his balance. As he briefly scans the alley, he attempts to compose himself. He knows he's early, but he couldn't stay at his empty home any more and the office was getting suspicious. The Director doesn’t linger during lunch breaks.</p><p> </p><p>He wouldn't admit that he was nervous. He doesn't get nervous, but he couldn't keep his hand still as he stands there and waits. He continuously thumbed at the objects in his pocket, no matter how he tried to quit.</p><p> </p><p>He refused to abandon his auror training and give in to looking back and forth as though a shady business deal was going down, but he’s nearing that stage. Today is urgent, and every second is critical to the success of the plan.</p><p> </p><p>He walked, albeit slowly and with a cane, to the end of the alley and then to the other side. Still no sign of him. They had a few minutes yet but he needs something to keep himself occupied. He makes his way carefully back to the agreed point.</p><p> </p><p>“Any minute now.” He mumbles quietly to himself.</p><p> </p><p>If this was routine, if it were just him and his team of aurors, he wouldn't be so unrestful. But involving Credence, a newly discovered wizard with no training, no auror experience, no wand and no basic knowledge of magic whatsoever . . . It's a risky move.</p><p> </p><p>It took a solid week to convince Goldstein to go along with it. Three days to wait out her rantings and truculent attitude, (The only auror in his division that he allows to get away with such behavior) and four days to go over and over every detail until she begrudgingly agreed to it. If, and <em>only</em> if, Credence’s safety could be assured.</p><p> </p><p>That's their job, protect Credence if necessary while he carries out the mission. They can do this. They have to. There's no other option.</p><p> </p><p>Finally he hears the familiar footsteps growing in volume. Before he's in sight, Percival swiftly hides the cane behind himself by leaning it precariously on the building wall. He adjusts his feet into a stance he should be able to tolerate for a bit and straightens himself to his full height.</p><p> </p><p>He won't let on that he's worried or that his body aches and his calf has been screaming at him for the past thirty minutes to sit and take the weight off of it. He needs to be the picture of confidence. He needs to be strong.</p><p> </p><p>For him.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence.” He states simply when the young man is in sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Mr. Graves. I came at the correct time.” Credence greets, nervously rotating the brim of his hat in his hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, thank you, Credence. You're always reliable.” Credence ducks his head a bit to hide the blush.</p><p> </p><p>He looks so fragile, like one strong breeze or a single cruel phrase from Percival’s lips could crumble him like dry leaves. But that's just a ruse. Though it’s a good one.</p><p> </p><p>Standing here now all anyone would see is a pale and boney boy, always hungry and always cold, always hesitant and flighty. So eager to please and meet approval. Always worried about making mistakes or not making the right decision, i.e. what someone else would want regardless of his own needs. None of it is the truth of what lies beneath.</p><p> </p><p>The poor boy’s fooled even himself.</p><p> </p><p>Percival shakes his head.</p><p> </p><p>He still can't believe that this young man--not a boy, he has to correct himself--a <em>man</em> has been able to contain a parasite of raw magic for so long. He must be far stronger than anyone around him could possibly imagine.</p><p> </p><p>Not just as a wizard, but as a person who's suffered so greatly. Despite all the pain, abuse and rejection he can still carry on, and with that thing feeding off of his very core.</p><p>He can't even imagine. He probably wouldn't have lasted a year as a child. There's no doubt Credence is more powerful than him.</p><p>He's more powerful than Grindelwald, and that's a frightening yet exhilarating thought.</p><p> </p><p>He will only admit it to himself, but Percival is in awe of this young man.</p><p> </p><p>“There's still time. You can back out if you want. You don't have to put yourself at risk. I can call another auror to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>This is the third time in as many days that Percival has given Credence this choice. This really is their only shot but if Credence is even the slightest bit scared, he's pulling the broom out from under the whole thing. He'll not risk his safety or his trust.</p><p> </p><p>“You said he knows who you are. That he's been watching all of you . . .” Credence pauses to remember the word, “. . . all you aurors.”</p><p> </p><p>He's been doing more than watching.</p><p> </p><p>Percival glances behind him to make sure the cane hasn't fallen in the trash pile next to it.</p><p> </p><p>“You said he would see right through a dis-disillusionment charm.” He states, fumbling over the new word in his vocabulary.</p><p> </p><p>“You said he may have already infiltrated MACUSA.” Credence looks him in the eyes, “You said there was no other way.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence squeezes his hat tight.</p><p> </p><p>“I can do this, sir.” He says determinately. “Give me a chance. I'll prove to you that I'm worthy of joining your world.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival is taken back a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Proving?” He asks. “Credence, when did anyone ever say you needed to prove yourself worthy? You're a wizard! End of story. That alone means you're worthy to be amongst us. You were supposed to grow up in the wizarding world. You slipping through the cracks, that should never have happened.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Is how Credence responds.</p><p> </p><p>He contemplates this, fumbling with that horrid puritan hat of his again. He looks up hesitantly through his thick lashes.</p><p> </p><p>“But if, . . .” He starts. Percival waits but he doesn't continue.</p><p> </p><p>Percival takes a step forward and, oh, that was a bad idea. He really needs that cane. He tries to cover the limp as best he can but it seems Credence is too busy thinking to notice.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on.” Percival encourages.</p><p> </p><p>“If I'm worthy, then . . . why haven't you taken me there yet?” He asks in a whisper. He dares a glance up to Percival’s eyes as he waits to know his fate.</p><p> </p><p>“I would like to take you there now. It's just, the obscurus . . .” Percival half answers.</p><p> </p><p>He’s not good at explaining things in a gentle manner. Years as the head Director have left him proficient in bluntness and not much else.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a lot that Credence doesn’t know. A lot that Graves isn’t telling him.</p><p> </p><p>Drawing attention to Credence/the obscurus would put him in jeopardy. It wouldn’t be easy for him or Goldstein to suddenly harbor an unregistered adult wizard with no wand or history of education in their home. And nobody is going to buy a ‘My Distant Cousin from Overseas Surprise Visit’ story. They need to lay low for now. Anyone could be watching them.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Credence responds again. He looks dejected.</p><p> </p><p>“You're afraid I'm going to hurt someone. I understand. I know I'm dangerous. I know I’m a . . . a freak. I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me.” He shrinks into himself, crushing the sturdy brim of his hat even further.</p><p> </p><p>“No Credence! That's not it at all! Quite the opposite. I'm afraid someone might hurt you.” Percival rushes his response before he mucks this up more. He places a reassuring hand on his arm. Credence looks up fully.</p><p> </p><p>“Someone might hurt me?” He asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes Credence. It's not just Grindelwald I'm worried about. If MACUSA found out what you are, who you are, they wouldn't be so welcoming. The obscurial is chaotic, unpredictable and worse, uncontrollable. At least not by anyone besides yourself. MACUSA doesn't like what it can't control. They could lock you up. Mercy Lewis, they might even study you like a lab rat.”</p><p> </p><p>Or they'll just decide to execute him to be on the safe side and Percival himself would be expected to carry out the order. He won't do that. Not ever. He knows he's breaking about half a dozen laws by keeping Credence hidden. Each one would have him fired, stripped of title, jailed and blocked from ever holding a wand again. Goldstein too. But it's worth the risk. She was right. Credence is a special case.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you're not happy here. I know that bluenose of a step-mother of yours is a tyrant. I'm tired of healing your wounds.” He takes another calculated and painful step forward, tightening his grip on Credence’s arm.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tired of drying your tears.” He whispers as he softly reaches with his other hand to trace a thumb along the dry path where he's witnessed so many fall.</p><p> </p><p>Credence closes his eyes reverently. He pushes his whole face into Percival’s hand. Brushing back and forth, desperate for the touch. Percival moves his hand upwards and begins petting him slowly from crown to jaw until Credence slumps into an embrace. His weight is putting more stress on Percival’s leg but he won't dare deny Credence this. He'd hold him for the rest of the day if they didn't have such pressing matters.</p><p> </p><p>“The truth is, for the meantime, you're safer where you are.” He pushes back just enough so his words ghost over Credence’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold on for me. Just a little while longer. I'll figure something out. I promise. Do you believe me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Credence says, his eyes are closed as he revels in their shared intimacy.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust me, Credence?” Percival needs to know. He needs to hear Credence say it out loud.</p><p> </p><p>He opens his eyes then, barely lifting his head from Percival’s shoulder. They're so close together their noses are almost touching. Credence’s dark gaze pierce him to his core.</p><p> </p><p>“I trust you, Mr. Graves.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Percival believes him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Ok,” He says as he takes a step back, smoothing down Credence’s hair that he mused.</p><p> </p><p>No more distractions. It's time.</p><p> </p><p>“Here's the plan.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence regains his composure somewhat and appears to mentally prepare himself for whatever Percival says next.</p><p> </p><p>“This ring,” he pulls out a non sequential plain silver banded ring from his pocket,</p><p> </p><p>“this isn't a ring at all. It a <em>persector</em>, a tracking spell. It needs to come into contact with the intended target's skin. The wearer needs to touch them with it so it can be absorbed into their body. Once it's in their blood stream, we can track them with a twin ring.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival pulls out a second ring from the same pocket, silver but with a strange red tinge to it, almost like rust though its surface is still smooth.</p><p> </p><p>“We, Goldstein and I, know Grindelwald has been watching the Salem Church for some time. He believes the obscurial is one of the younger children. He's going to try to get closer to them. There's a very good chance he'll be at the rally today, but he'll be disguised. I'll be in this alley across the street. Goldstein will be in the building next to me on the third floor, watching from a window. I'll signal you when I spot him. All you have to do is hand him a flyer and make sure the ring comes into contact with his skin. The ring will do the rest and he won’t feel a thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence puts his hat on and takes the ring carefully, examining it.</p><p> </p><p>“Will it affect me at all?” He toys with it turning it this way and that.</p><p> </p><p>“No, only him. You can wear it safely.”</p><p> </p><p>“How does it know who's who? How does it know who to absorb into?” Credence tries it on different fingers to see which fits best.</p><p> </p><p>“Because,” Percival hesitates.</p><p> </p><p>What they’re about to do, the type of magic they’re going to use, is very illegal. Very. They can’t get caught. He didn’t tell Credence earlier because he didn’t want to upset him or worry him, but now he realizes that was a mistake. Goldstein was right. Again. He really shouldn’t be keeping this from Credence. He deserves to know what could happen to them should they fail or get discovered.</p><p> </p><p>“Because it has his blood weaved into it. It won't work on anyone else."</p><p> </p><p>Credence's eyes widen comically.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence, I need you to understand that taking someone’s blood and using blood magic on their person without their consent is a crime punishable by imprisonment. Even on someone as nefarious as Grindelwald. Do understand that? This is very important. Remember what I said about MACUSA. Should they find out they will not be lenient.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence tilts his head to the side and contemplates this for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Graves,” he asks, “how did you get his blood?”</p><p> </p><p>Percival takes a deep breath.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't give you all the details before, Credence. He did try to infiltrate MACUSA. But when that didn't go as he planned, he tried to kill us.”</p><p> </p><p>Credence closes the gab between them and places his now ringed hands on Graves’ lapel as Percival stares off to the blankness of the alley walls.</p><p> </p><p>“I lost six aurors, Credence. Six. He . . He's very powerful. We got lucky, very lucky that a spell grazed his arm and he lost some blood,”</p><p> </p><p>It was Percival who got lucky, if you could call it luck.</p><p> </p><p>He looks back towards Credence and places his hands over the boy’s.</p><p> </p><p>“That's why I want you to be extra sure. He shouldn’t try anything here, not with all the non-maj. He's not ready to expose himself just yet. But if he knows he’s being watched, if he feels his back is to the wall, he might act irrationally. I don't want you or any of the children for that matter to get hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Graves, did he hurt you?” Credence’s eyes bore in to him as the grip squeezes tight.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine, Credence. What I need to know is if you’re fine, with all of this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” He states quickly and confidently.</p><p> </p><p>“I accept the possible consequences of my actions here today. I know this is dangerous and I know I could be punished if caught. I want to do this. I . . . I want to help you stop him.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival looks for any hesitance in Credence’s eyes. Finding none, he nods once.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you Credence.” He takes his shoulder and turns him towards the street.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to get into position soon. I need you to go to your spot next to the podium. After Mary Lou’s speech, hand out your flyers as usual. Keep your eye out for me, I’ll signal you when I determine who he is. Go up to him, hand him a flyer and make sure the ring touches is his skin.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what if he doesn’t take the pamphlet?” Credence asks as they walk slowly, Mr. Graves’ hand a heavy weight on his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Percival stops him then.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t do anything rash, Credence. If he doesn’t take it, he doesn’t take it. Come back to me with the ring as soon as you can and we’ll think of something else.” He encourages them to walk once more.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you hurt.” He almost mumbles to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“But—”</p><p> </p><p>“No buts Credence, it’s time. I need you across the street.” He gives the young man a gentle push and hopes he takes the hint.</p><p> </p><p>Credence looks back once, he opens his mouth to speak but the stern look on Graves’ face makes him think otherwise. And he resumes his path across the busy road to the building’s stairs.</p><p> </p><p>Once he’s out of sight, Graves pushes out a heavy sigh and bends ninety degrees to grab his good knee and steady himself. He takes a couple steps to the building side with his arm flailing for purchase to keep from landing flat on the pissed covered alley. He should have brought a pain potion with him but he’s already taken too much of the stuff. Any more and the healers will force him to be bedridden like they already tried.</p><p> </p><p>He takes heaving breaths through the pain and then straightens himself. Reaching into his inner coat pocket he pulls out his wand.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Accio cane</em>!” It swats into his waiting palm and he turns to follow Credence’s path to the mouth of the alley when,</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Graves!” Credence is running back towards him.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence? We don’t have time for this! You need to get into position!” Percival turns his body so the bad leg and cane are hidden.</p><p> </p><p>“You have a cane! You’re hurt! When did this happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Lewis, he saw.</p><p> </p><p>His hands are roaming over Graves’ shoulders and chest and then intimately down to his legs, eyes frantically searching for any hidden injury.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence, please. You have to get into place. Now! I’ll explain everything later.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And that gives Graves pause. This is a word foreign to Credence’s vocabulary.</p><p> </p><p>“You lied to me. You said you were fine. I’m not leaving until you tell me what happened. What did he do to you?”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a hardness and determination that Percival has never seen on the young man’s face before, but one he’s seen looking back at himself in the mirror many times. He may be flustered at the untimeliness of this conversation, but he’s also a bit proud of Credence for not backing down. So he resigns.</p><p> </p><p>“When Grindelwald attacked us, his spells were strong. Hard to deflect or counter, nearly impossible to block. I was careless. I was trying match my spell to another aurors, to hit him hard while I thought he was distracted. But he was ready for it. I couldn’t dodge, I couldn’t stop my own spell in time. All I could do was try to deflect it and turn my body so no major organs were hit. Instead he got my leg.”</p><p> </p><p>And nearly severed it.</p><p> </p><p>Percival was knocked flat on the ground and couldn’t asses the damage. He knew it was bad. Couldn’t move his foot, couldn’t feel anything at all save for the excruciating pain. The healers told him an inch of skin was the only thing keeping it attached. But in that moment, Grindelwald dropped his attention from Graves to the remaining aurors and Graves took his chance. He got Grindelwald on the arm deep enough that he bleed on the ground shortly before taking the last of them out and apparating away.</p><p> </p><p>Percival hangs the cane in the crook of his arm and places both hands on Credence’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“Credence, now’s not the time to worry. I’m fine, I assure you. We’ll talk about this later. I just don’t want you to be scared.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not scared.” Credence states with firmness.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to succeed today, Mr. Graves.” He puts his own hands on Percival’s waist and stands to his full height. Percival has to hold his chin high to meet the gaze. He never realized Credence is taller than him. Then he leans in as close as he dares and looks Percival square in the eyes. Graves holds his breath.</p><p> </p><p>“And he’s never going to hurt you ever again.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And Percival believes him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He pats Credence a couple times and brings the cane down again. Credence makes his way back to the alley entrance, but this time he’s insistent Percival accompany him. He doesn’t let go of Percival’s arm until the last few feet when they slow their pace and Percival gives him a reassuring nod to continue.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s going to be alright Mr. Graves. You’ll see. I won't let you down.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, he crosses the street.</p><p> </p><p>Percival breaths out that lung full of air he didn’t realize he was holding and watches the resoluteness of Credence’s back as he ascends the stairs to the front of the non-maj bank.</p><p> </p><p>He continues to watch as there’s a displacement of air and Goldstein appears next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Credence? Is he ready?” she asks breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>She must have just come from MACCUA. They’ve been apparating away from there via circuitous routes in the event that they may be followed. It’s a bit exhausting but a necessary precaution.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s there.” Percival points.</p><p> </p><p>“I still think this is a bad idea.” She says.</p><p> </p><p>“Too late now. I don’t think I could talk Credence out of it anyway. He’s determined.”</p><p> </p><p>She looks at him inquisitively.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure what just happened but Credence suddenly found some new confidence. He’s assured me he can do this.” He turns to her.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe him. He’ll be alright. And besides, he has us keeping his back.”</p><p> </p><p>Goldstein sighs in defeat. They’ve been over all this already. She knows arguing now would only distract them from protecting Credence.</p><p> </p><p>“Right. I’ll get into position. Stay in communication with me?” She points her wand at a spot just behind her ear and Graves mimics the move. A faint blue dot glows on both their skin at the spot and then she apparats away.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Pesky pixies perch precariously on pansy petals.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Graves hears her voice clearly from three stories above as though she’s speaking them directly into his ear. He snorts at the first year Ilvermorny tongue twister that she always uses to test this spell.</p><p> </p><p>“I can hear you, Goldstein.” He says flatly.</p><p> </p><p>He casts the strongest concealment charms he knows, leaving a small gap that allows Credence to view him and waits.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Ok, I’m at the window. I can see the whole block from up here.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent.” He responds.</p><p> </p><p>By now the banners and podium are up and waiting for the leader of the New Salem Philanthropic Society to take her place. The few children that were brought along to do all the set up and hand out flyers at the end of her speech, stand all in a stoic row with Credence and his sister last.</p><p> </p><p>His head is bowed with his hands clasped in front of him. He looks nothing like the young man boring his dark eyes into Graves’ sole moments before.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Here she comes.”</em> Goldstein announces Mary Lou’s entrance with distaste dripping from every word.</p><p> </p><p>Mary Lou is in a particularly lively mood today and her speech carries on longer than average. But it affords Graves time to scan the crowd.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty minutes in, and still no sign of him. He has to be careful what revealing spells he uses, Grindelwald would more than likely be prepared for them or any other spell for that matter.</p><p> </p><p>Credence too scans the crowd from his slightly elevated position on the building stairs. He’s good at not being seen. Good at blending in. He watches, no one pays him any mind.</p><p> </p><p>There’s some familiar faces. The small clump of ma’s followers that attend most of her rallies. Everyone else are just curious bystanders that have stopped long enough to inspect the gathering.</p><p> </p><p>But then he sees it.</p><p> </p><p>A man to his right, standing still amongst a cluster of business men on their lunch break. He’s wearing a dark suit and woolen coat and hat like the rest. His hair is black, his face is plain and void of any outstanding features. But Credence can’t deny the <em>wrong wrong wrong</em> coming off of this man.</p><p> </p><p>It’s him. There’s no doubt.</p><p> </p><p>He looks again to Mr. Graves. He’s shaking his head ‘no’.</p><p> </p><p>Then they can’t see him, can’t detect him for some reason. Their spells aren’t working.</p><p> </p><p>Credence fixes Mr. Graves with a look he hopes he comprehends.</p><p> </p><p><em>It’s him</em>, he tries to convey.</p><p> </p><p>He flicks his eyes to the business men. And back, and watches as understanding lights up Mr. Graves’s face. His wand moves to his neck and Credence can tell he and miss Tina are communicating. He glances up in time to witness the same clarity reach Tina’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Credence looks back to the rally and calmly waits.</p><p> </p><p>As ma’s speech continues, Grindelwald slowly moves through the crowd in a seeming casual way but he’s got a clear destination at the foot of the stairs. Directly in front of him, and Modesty.</p><p> </p><p>And when his gaze rested upon them, Credence saw a double set of eyes. A unsuspecting pair of deep browns overshadowing two opposing colors. Their starkness sucking Credence into their center and for a moment he lost himself.</p><p> </p><p>There must be some sort of a charm covering the first pair with the plainness of the second. Some sort of an illusion to hide what would no doubt be a clear giveaway to his person hiding behind the dullness of non-maj masquerade.</p><p> </p><p>At the same moment, Modesty takes Credence’s hand and squeezes. She never reached for him in public before. Wouldn’t dare due to ma’s punishment. But something has her spooked. And he realizes that she feels it too.</p><p> </p><p>He squeezes her back and looks down to her as she looks up.</p><p> </p><p>Their unspoken sibling language pass between them.</p><p> </p><p><em>I know,</em> he says. <em>I feel it too. I’m right here. It’ll be ok</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And he holds her hand tight through the rest of the speech.</p><p> </p><p>When the end finally comes, Credence takes a single moment to prepare himself and then he begins to descend the stairs with Modesty in tow. One final squeeze and he releases her so they can carry out their task.</p><p> </p><p>He skirts by Grindelwald keeping him on his left and keeping Modesty on his right as he hands a flyer to another man, and then to several others. All the while Grindelwald doesn’t move much. He seems interested in this thing or that but Credence can tell he’s just biding his time.</p><p> </p><p>He never once dares a glace at the alley beyond.</p><p> </p><p>Credence continues to fain interest in him over the rest of the crowd when it is Grindelwald himself who makes the first move.</p><p> </p><p>He approaches them with an appropriate complacent smile and then extends that smile to Modesty.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Little One.” He purrs.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello sir.” She automatically responds, the politeness that’s been drilled in to them outweighing her fear.</p><p> </p><p>“My how well behaved and polite you all are. Your mother must be very proud of that, and that you are so helpful in aiding her in this most important work that she and her church are doing for the community.
