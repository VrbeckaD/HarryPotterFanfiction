    <p>For someone whose nickname is the Boy Who Lived, Harry still manages to be inordinately surprised by the fact that he lives through his second killing curse. He listens as Dumbledore explains the situation, unable to stop looking around the white wisps of something in the air and the washed out, muted colors of King’s Cross Station. Even the train isn’t as bright as it is in life. There’s something missing here, and it’s not the life and color that he’s never seen the station without.</p><p>When Dumbledore stops speaking, Harry quietly says, “Is this what it’s going to feel like? To live without the horcrux?”</p><p>“Yes,” Dumbledore says. “I know it must be a relief.”</p><p>He can’t stop looking for the something that should be here, but Harry knows he won’t find it again. It’s gone, and it makes no sense, but the hollow feeling in his chest feels as though it will open up into a black hole and take him over. He finally looks back at Dumbledore and doubts that his former headmaster has missed Harry’s shattered expression at his words. Dumbledore doesn’t miss much. Maybe he expects Harry to lie to himself or to Dumbledore. Maybe he expects Harry to tell the truth and be reassured.</p><p>“I hate it,” Harry says, but he doesn’t think there’s enough reassurance in the world for how horribly empty he feels. “It feels like I’m half a person now.”</p><p>“You are Harry Potter as you should have been,” Dumbledore says, his tone so kind it feels like knives.</p><p>Harry snorts. “That Harry Potter never got a chance.” The Harry Potter who could’ve been a happy, well-adjusted young man died with his parents, or maybe the Dursleys starved him out. There is only a man with more scars than he knows what to do with and a lifetime of sacrifice. He’s more selfish than he’s ever been in his life when he says, “I can’t live like this.”</p><p>“It isn’t your time to pass. Your parents would never forgive me if I take you with me,” Dumbledore says, his eyes pleading. “You have a destiny, and only part of it is defeating Voldemort. The other part is living the life all these years have done so little to prepare you for: a life of happiness and comfort.”</p><p>It would be so nice to believe him, Harry thinks, but his heart is beating into nothingness. Rationally, he knows that his friends are back at Hogwarts, fighting for their lives, and some part of him wants to see them again. To hug Ron and Hermione, to kiss Ginny deeply, to kiss the top of Teddy’s little head. But it’s hard to be rational when he feels like he’s lost a limb.</p><p>“Where is it?” Harry asks. “The horcrux.”</p><p>Dumbledore frowns and Harry doesn’t think it’s through his former headmaster’s will that a child appears on the bench next to them, swaddled in a green blanket. It’s an ugly thing, pale as anything, eyes red and bloodshot. At least the horcrux still has its nose. When Harry picks it up, it glares at him, but otherwise it barely moves.</p><p>Harry can’t take it back with him, for a horcrux cannot exist if Voldemort is to be destroyed. He can’t take it forward with him because Dumbledore will block his path. He can only hold it in this ghostly train station and fight the devastation he feels. It doesn’t make any sense at all, the way he can’t breathe now that a part of him is gone. It’s a part of Voldemort, too, but over the years it’s become Harry’s.</p><p>“It’s time, my dear boy.”</p><p>“My dear headmaster,” Harry says, his smile is wry. The horcrux tries to copy his expression, but ends up only looking constipated. “I know you don’t have all the answers. I’ve learned that lesson well by now. But I can’t return like this, so please, give me another option.”</p><p>Dumbledore is silent for a long moment. “Are positive that this is the path you must take?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry says, holding the horcrux closer to himself.</p><p>There’s a certain sadness in Dumbledore’s blue eyes as he motions to the stone wall that leads to what would be the muggle side of Platform 9 &amp; 3/4. “On the other side is another pathway to life that has opened to no one else but you, should you decide to take it. I can’t tell you what lies ahead. Perhaps reincarnation, perhaps something else. There is nothing I can do to prepare you for this.”</p><p>“You’ve done what you can,” Harry says, swallowing. His choices: death, life, and the unknown. But hell, he’s a Gryffindor. And he’s Slytherin enough to remember his sense of self-preservation. Harry doesn’t think he can last a year feeling so horrible, let alone a lifetime. “I suppose my next great adventure is just a little more literal than expected.”</p><p>“Good luck, Harry,” Dumbledore tells him.</p><p>Harry wonders if Dumbledore would have hugged him had he not been holding the horcrux. There’s certainly a wariness behind the twinkle of Dumbledore’s eyes. And yet, he told Harry about the third path instead of forcing him to return to life.</p><p>Clutching the horcrux close, Harry starts walking, faster and faster until he’s running for the washed-out brick wall. It’s easier at a run, Mrs. Weasley’s voice rings in his ears. He closes his eyes as he passes through and he drops downward, falling through nothing at all until he is nothing at all.</p><p>When he opens his eyes again, there is nothing in his arms, but there is life in front of him. Three women surrounding another woman on a table, franticly calling out to her and to each other. There’s too much blood, Harry thinks, and the youngest woman echoes his thoughts. She notices him as he treads closer to the table.</p><p>“Sir, you can’t be in here—”</p><p>Harry ignores all three of them, reaching for the woman’s hand to feel her pulse. The woman is still warm, but her heartbeat is gone. His own feels too strong in his chest, like it’s beating for two. There’s a baby in the matron’s arms and Harry can just barely see its pink face, but he can hear its cries. His cries, because this is not a portion of a whole, this is a child, abandoned through death by its mother and held by a woman whose clothes are half a century out of fashion.</p><p>“He’s mine,” Harry tells them, the emptiness gone completely from his chest.</p><p>The matron is not particularly concerned with who Harry is or how he got into the orphanage, only that he’s willing to take in the child and pay for the mother’s funeral. She places Tom into Harry’s arms and tells him she’s relieved to see the boy’s father step up. Harry doesn’t think they look particularly alike, but they don’t not, either. Tom is tiny, red, wrinkly. He’d obviously been washed by the time Harry arrived, but some of Merope’s blood remains behind one of his ears. He barely looks human, but that’s probably because Harry’s never seen such a young baby up close. Harry has no doubt he will be a cute enough kid soon.</p><p>“How do I hold him?” Harry asks, and the matron takes him into her office and answers the rest of his questions. She pulls out some baby formula and shows him how to use it and feed him. The matron is kind, but she doesn’t try to hide how much she wants him to keep the child. It’s a clean place, this orphanage, but Harry sees signs of age everywhere that a good scrubbing can’t erase.</p><p>Harry has no idea how to raise a child, but he knows he can’t possibly fuck it up worse than Wool’s Orphanage.</p><p>“Can I have a moment with Merope?” he asks when all is said and done and Tom is sleeping in his arms.</p><p>“Of course, dear,” the matron says. She clears the room out and closes the doors.</p><p>Harry stares down at the body and feels a strange detachment. There is no soul left in Merope Riddle, no life. There is only a corpse. Tom isn’t aware enough to cry over her—although Harry doubts he would anyway—and Harry never knew her. It is the concept that no one will truly grieve Merope that saddens him, not her death.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he still says. For all the things that could’ve never been. “I’ll take care of him.”</p><p>The elder wand slips into his hand when he reaches into his pocket, despite not existing before that moment. He feels the stone appear in his other pocket and the cloak fold into his back pocket, shrinking effortlessly to fit. Harry doesn’t know the spell, but when he waves his wand, a beautiful coffin appears. The wood is midnight black and the words Merope Riddle curl around the front. Harry levitates her body inside and places one hand on the wood. With a gust of wind, he is gone.</p><p>The graveyard that’s haunted his nightmares is different in early evening. There are less gravestones here in this time, and it’s well cared for. It’s colder than he expected outside, having arrived from May, so Harry casts a warming charm over himself and Tom.</p><p>At the end of the line, Harry raises the earth and places the coffin inside, covering it so completely that he can’t tell the patch of earth had been raised at all. A flick of his wand and a gravestone appears, heavy marble landing with a thud onto the ground.</p><p>
  <em>Merope Riddle, February 1, 1907 - December 31, 1926. A dream lies buried here.</em>
</p><p>She was only two years older than him.</p><p>Tom is awake again in his arms, but quiet, as though the somber graveyard can reach even him.</p><p>“I don’t love you,” Harry says, quietly. He stares into Tom’s blue eyes and wonders if they’ll stay that way or if the baby blue will soon fade into the boy’s real eye color. It won’t be red, but Hardy has no idea what color Tom’s eyes originally were. The thought that there is more to Tom Riddle than madness comforts him. “But I will, I think.”</p><p>Tom’s soul echoes within him, and it’s an echo he chose this time. Whatever going through that barrier had done—because he isn’t the same, not in magic or in spirit—Harry will embrace it. He asks the wand to guard the grave and a burst of blue hits the area, coating the perimeter before vanishing.</p><p>And then there’s just him and Tom in the cold winter air. Harry casts a notice me not around Tom and trudges up the path to Riddle Manor. Cold seeps into him as he remembers everything that had happened here, but he focuses on the differences. The house he approaches is lived in and well lit. The grounds are lifeless in the middle of winter, but they’re tidy.</p><p>A maid answers the door only seconds after Harry knocks.</p><p>“I’m here to see Tom Riddle,” Harry says. “It’s about Merope.”</p><p>The maid’s eyes widen and she steps aside. “Come in, please.”</p><p>Harry is led into a sitting room that thankfully isn’t the one he saw Voldemort murder the groundskeeper in. Or maybe it is; everything looks so different inside now that it’s not covered in dust and half eaten by moths. The Riddles keep him waiting, but not for no reason. They’re arguing as they walk down the stairs, a young male voice the loudest but the other two nearly as loud.</p><p>Tom senior appears first in the sitting room and scowls as he looks Harry over. Belatedly, Harry realizes his jacket and jeans haven’t seen many good days in months of camping out and being on the run.</p><p>“Where is she? Where is Merope?” Tom senior asks as his parents join the room and come to a stop next to him.</p><p>Harry stands up, since it doesn’t look like this is going to be a polite conversation. “I’ve come here to tell you that Merope died a few hours ago at an orphanage in London. I’ve buried her in your family’s graveyard.”</p><p>“She’s dead?” Tom senior asks, swallowing. He’s so young, his face habitually pale and lacking that smile Harry had seen in Dumbledore’s pensieve. His eyes are a very pale blue, the same as Mrs. Riddle’s. “How— she’s a witch, how could she die?”</p><p>“Witches and wizards can die just as easily as anyone else,” Harry replies, his voice quiet. He knows that all too well. “Merope had been unwell for a very long time and homelessness left her with few options.”</p><p>“She could’ve just ensnared some other poor man,” Tom senior says, snidely.</p><p>He quiets when a man who can only be Tom senior’s father puts his hand on his shoulder. “Our graveyard, you say?”</p><p>Harry inclines his head. “She married your son. She deserves that much, at least.”</p><p>Mr. Riddle purses his lips but doesn’t disagree. Harry’s glad he put a ward around the grave, because he doesn’t doubt it would be gone by the end of the week if he hadn’t.</p><p>“Is that all you wished to tell us, mister...” Mrs. Riddle trails off.</p><p>“Harry. Just Harry. And no— I came to ask if you wanted to be a part of your son’s life.” He directs his question toward Tom senior, because it’s his opinion that matters, not the thoughtful look that enters Mrs. Riddle’s eyes.</p><p>Tom senior faces his parents with a desperate look. “Mother, no. No. I won’t have him.”</p><p>A hushed discussion follows. Harry turns slightly toward the fireplace, as the Riddles don’t seem to want his input. The painting on the mantle is a beautiful scene of the English countryside. For all Harry knows, it may be of the land around Little Hangleton. He knows what the Riddles’ answer will probably be, but there’s a possibility of them surprising him. If the Riddles actually want Tom, Harry supposes he can find a way to insert himself into the household. Maybe as a nanny, as odd as it would seem for them to have a male one. Harry knows he could’ve simply taken the boy and started a new life for them, but the part of Harry that remembers being young and desperate to have blood family who loved him, that part of him knows he should at least try.</p><p>Try in vain, he thinks as Tom senior clears his throat and says, “I know what you must think of me, but I can’t take him. I’ll never be able to look at him without seeing her and she— she was evil. I don’t care how much she loved me. She took a year of my life away from me, ruined my reputation, left me no choice but to cast out my own wife.”</p><p>“We will be amenable to providing you with some funds to raise the child,” Mrs. Riddle says, sharing a look with her son that speaks volumes. It’s not too late to change your mind, she all but says.</p><p>Mr. Riddle has less interest in keeping a link to Tom senior’s first marriage. His voice is firm as he says, “It will be a one-time payment that you may use as you wish, but keep in mind that you won’t receive any more from us. After today, that child has no ties to this family. I won’t have you or him interfere with the proper family my son will soon have.”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that. I was already planning to care for him,” Harry says, shaking his head. But, well, he is fifty years out of time with the deathly hallows as his only possessions. “But if you want to pay me off, I wouldn’t say no.”</p><p>He leaves the Riddle home with a very sizable sum enclosed in a leather briefcase. When Harry glances back, he sees Tom senior watching him from the large window to the front of the house, but after a moment Tom senior walks away. A part of Harry understands him. He wouldn’t have ever been able to forgive someone who’d used a potion as powerful as Amorentia on him. And yet the whole story of Tom’s origins is full of pitiful people. Tom senior, potioned and raped and furious. Merope, abused all her life and desperate. The Gaunts, inbred and racist and proud. It’s such a mess.</p><p>His arms are tired after carrying Tom for so long, but Harry has one more stop to make. The Gaunt shack is almost unnoticeable amidst the trees, but Harry finds his way based on luck and a year old memory of a memory. No one answers his knock and he doesn’t hear anyone in the house, so he quietly casts <em>alohomora</em> and steps inside. The elder wand lights up the room, casting shadows over the dusty, grimy furniture inside. It’s obviously been a long time since anyone has stepped foot here. Harry can’t remember if Tom’s uncle and grandfather are still alive, but the state of their home can only mean they’re dead or still in Azkaban.</p><p>“Your other legacy,” Harry says to Tom. When Tom begins to fuss, he holds him close and takes one last look around. “Blood family is probably overrated anyway. I never knew my parents and I turned out alright. Desperately attached to your soul and now the master of death, but no one’s perfect.”</p><p>He makes no sound as he disapparates from the Gaunt shack, never to return.</p>
