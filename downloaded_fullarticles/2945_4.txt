  <em>‘For he doth make my veins and pulses tremble.’ </em>
</p><p>For the longest time that I could remember, I had been a lonely child. Despite growing up with a school of boisterous adoptive brothers and sisters I had grown accustomed to wandering alone in the hallways of our Queens apartment at night, with a candle in hand, wandering and waiting for something to just pick me up and steal me away. My world, as I’d perceive it, was always rinsed with sepia- ugly, muted, dirty. Things in my life barely interested me. Ma and her teachings were starting to border on the uncanny, and I yearned for the day where I could just…</p><p>There was an ember within me that would not sleep, a restless glow that threatened to consume me with every breath I take. And as much as I tried to ignore it, it ate and ate at my flesh like wringing maggots on a rotten, pitted fruit, and I was left but a hollow deep within me.</p><p>The first time I laid eyes on you, it was the morning rush hour and I had been accompanying Ma to distribute flyers. In the sea of thousand uncaring faces, yours was a beacon of light, standing out in the wash of muted grey and brown with your sweeping black coat and swept hair. You were hanging around the front doors to a stately building, your eyes cast skywards, as if the thing you were waiting for would drop out of the sky and into your hands.</p><p>I must have been staring at you for too long, because you noticed, turning away carelessly to glance in my direction, and then I had looked away, like a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar. A searing hot blush rose up high into my cheekbones and ears, and I fumbled with the flyers in my hands. Beside me, Ma was busy yelling rhetoric to whoever would listen, while I contend with the twist of longing ache that tossed violently in the centre of my chest.</p><p>When I finally looked up, and saw that you that you had gone, I noticed how, for the first time in a very long while, the world was a vibrant and as vivid as it has always been. Never had the sound of cars and music been so loud and whirring with life, and even in Ma’s ugly, outdated dress I could see the patterns that lived and breathed as I finally did.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>‘A mighty flame follows a tiny spark.’</em>
</p><p>You found out where I lived even though we had only ever met through that one chance encounter. It started out as innocuous lingering outside the apartment, you gliding gracefully along the cobblestone with your hands in your pockets, occasionally ducking into a corner for a cigarette. I tried so hard not to stare at your shadow when Ma brought me out for another day of handing out flyers, and you seemed to thrive on my longing, dancing between invisibility and starkness when I turned my back from you.</p><p>Then came the conversations- you only spoke to me when you were certain that Ma was well out of earshot, for you had seen the purple flowers on my wrist and neck and knew what she was capable of. I learnt your name, Percival- whispered low and silkily into my ear. I told you mine- one of those old Puritan virtue names, nothing special, but my heart raced, and my blood sang when you repeated it back to me, the two syllables like flutes of honey falling from your generous mouth.</p><p>You scouted me whenever you could- usually in alleys and corner stores that would not raise suspicion- and asked me about my day. Handing flyers again? Yes, of course. How are your siblings? The same, the same. And you mother? Insane. You had a way with your words, such that even the most mundane of exchanges were filled with curiosity and care, and I clung onto every word of yours like a pilgrim searching for some form of truth and gospel.</p><p>You asked me about my feelings, and I confided, often with a tear or two, perhaps more if Ma had been particularly cruel that day, and you listened. Nodding quietly, thoughtfully, in a way that no one else had ever done for me. You asked if I had ever felt that I was worth something more.</p><p>Then you brandished a wand, <em>your </em>wand, and showed me, with a flick of your wrist, a burst of sparks so blindingly beautiful that I was sure I’ll never be able to see it again, reproduced in any painting or scenery. But you did it again, and again, each blinding arc of light after another, until I had to blink them out of my eyes, so I could see your sculpted face again.</p><p>This is what you could be, you told me, resting a hand on my shoulder. My eyes were still on your wand, now hidden by the folds of your cloak. If you help me, I can help you become what I am, you promised, pressing a kiss to my cheek. The spark inside my heart burst into an untamed inferno, licking away at every shred of inhibition I had, and I turned my head to face yours fully, before leaning in to meet your full lips.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>‘The devil is not as black as he is painted.’ </em>
</p><p>With each encounter you became bolder and bolder, until I was suspecting that you were not the same man as I had once meet anymore. There was a darkness in your inky eyes that was not there when I first met you, and even the smile that you bestowed, once dripping with fondness and sympathy, was now hollow and empty. Where there was a candle now stood a penumbra, a man swallowed so nearly by darkness except for those darned, superficial edges. And it was those darned superficial edges that I clung onto, waiting, hoping, desperately to see the man that once held me and murmured honeyed words into my ear.</p><p>And then one day you showed up after a particularly long day with Ma in a dark alley. I remembered little of our domestic scuffle, except that it ended with more bruises down my back and a new set of scratches on my hands. With a soft hush, you healed them quickly, brushing your thumb across the pad of my palm. You reached into your pocket and fished out a necklace with an odd pendant. It was for me, you said. You wanted for me to have this, and you would trust very few with it. Once the entire ordeal was over, you would come for me, and then I’ll finally be rid of this wretched place, of Ma’s wretched grasp and stinging slaps and burning cuffs. The rest of your words were white noise as I looked down on the pendant. It was warm, as it rested in the dip of your chest prior. But it was also heavy, as it hung down from the slopes of my shoulder like the stone of Sisyphus, threatening to crush me into pieces, scattering me into the wind.</p><p>
