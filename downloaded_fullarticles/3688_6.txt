    <p>Author's Note:// Hello, WhiteFoxChild here!  I hope everyone reading this chapter, enjoys it. If you like it or if you don't like it comment, and or star. You can say it was horrible, or good, or awesome, just tell me what you think. </p><p>The Fanfiction can also be found on Wattpad. There it is at the 30th or so chapter. Enjoy please. </p><p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter.</p><p>Harry sat cramped in his cupboard, distraught and bloody. His body ached with searing pain, and a ghost of flickering fire. He groaned, twisting his body in chances to escape the pain. It was much worse than anything he'd ever felt, and that's saying something. Did his uncle take the last beating to far?</p><p>The pain he felt was getting worse. It felt like scorching hot water was being poured over his backside, and he nearly screamed, clamping his teeth over his bottom lip. The teeth broke skin, sending blood falling down his chin. He felt so confused; did his uncle beat him? </p><p>Harry didn't remember...the past few days...weeks...had been nothing but darkness, and terrible hunger locked away in his cupboard. Was he starving to death? He hadn't thought it would have felt like this, to starve to death. He had been starved before, how come this time it felt so different? </p><p>He let out a muffled groan, his body contorting in on itself. The gums of his teeth burned sharply, like he was gurgling boiling water. The roots of his hair were being yanked out, strand by strand with tweezers. His back was burning hot, and it felt like something was trying to claw out of it. </p><p>Harry screamed. He didn't mean to. He didn't want his relatives to see, or hear. But it hurt so bad; he kept screaming. His eyes clamped shut, and suddenly he found himself gripping the sides of his head. Pain flared throughout all his body, acting as fire as it scorched his skin. Tears fell from his eyes, and he was amazed. He hadn't cried...in so long.</p><p>He sobbed, as his body was submerged under boiling water...lava...fire? He couldn't say. His body twisted and spasmed, shaking uncontrollably, contorting into strange misshapen positions. Unlike the pain usually brought from his uncle, this pain didn't dim, or fade and he didn't accustom to it. </p><p>This was just pain, each moment of it worse than the last. He could barely breathe, as it grew more and more terrible. The breaths he was able to take in were in choking and bloody, with little air he could use. He gasped and choked, trying desperately to breathe. It felt like his lungs were closing.</p><p>The pain kept on coming, in a never-ending onslaught. He didn't know how long he lay in his cupboard screaming from pain. He didn't even know why in so much pain. Why was he? </p><p>Suddenly the pain was gone and in its place was sweet, comforting warmth. His body didn't ache, or stutter. Did he die? Was this heaven? Harry slowly opened his eyes, and was met with a cascading fall of warm grey sky. He felt like he was being held close in someone's arms. He felt content and loved. </p><p>He glanced down and saw he lie in soft grass, and that he was naked. Above him, a single pure white cloud drifted through a sliver colored sky, circling the bright sun. He smiled, looking around. Flowers of all colors decorated the grass, and in a short distance away he saw trees. The arms around him tightened, and he heard a startled whisper. </p><p>The whisper, was so quiet and mashed he couldn't understand it, but as soon as it was released, the white cloud in the sky snapped forward and covered the sun. And then, everything was gone, and all was dark. He felt no pain, but he felt cold. Utter and bitter ice-like cold. He shivered. </p><p>It was so cold. </p><p>Author's Note:// Thank you for reading, and I hope you keep reading, for the next chapter.</p>
