    <p>It was a chilly midwinter evening and Severus was skimming the length of the wooded forest in search of Dittany. The wild, overgrown forest itself was situated in the highlands of Scotland, making the easterly wind that much more nail-biting. Trudging through the think blanket of snow, Severus’ feet were starting to feel numb despite them being insulated in a pair of fur-lined hiking boots. He crouched down to extract some of the herb nestled at the base of an oak tree when he saw something reflective out of his peripheral vision. Cautiously Severus stood, grasping his wand whilst still keeping it concealed-just in case a Muggle happened to be skulking around the forest at this late hour-which would be suicidal.</p><p>“Hello?” He called out tentatively, as he made his way across the landscape to the area in question.</p><p>There was no answer and it was deathly silent, save for the wind rustling the branches of the trees. Concluding it was likely to be a wild animal prowling around, Severus turned back and started shuffling away when he caught sudden movement to his right. Someone was running flat out, weaving between the trees at a frantic pace. It was certainly the outline of a human, a small human at that, most likely a child. Initially he was just going to turn a blind eye and ignore the disturbance, yet he couldn’t turn his back on a child. They would succumb to frostbite or hypothermia if they remained out in this weather. Without a second thought, Severus sprinted in pursuit in an attempt to catch up to the child.</p><p>Whoever this person was, they could certainly move quickly. Even with Severus running at top speed, he couldn’t get close enough to the person to stop them from continuing. Deciding that it may be best to take the risk, Severus ceased pursuing the entity and silently took cover behind a tree, poking his head around it every so often to see if the child had noticed that he was no longer following them. After running for a few more seconds, the small form glanced behind him and, assuming that he had lost his pursuer, crept behind one of the trees.</p><p>Noting the exact tree that the person had taken refuge behind, Severus tiptoed as quietly as possible towards it before poking his head around to see a small boy sitting at the base of the tree. The boy was shivering uncontrollably and clutching his legs to his chest in a defensive gesture. The child was wearing no more than a pair of pinstriped pyjama bottoms and his head was shaved, stray pieces of stubbly hair barely breaking the skin’s surface. Obviously the child had run away, from a hospital it would seem, and so Severus had no choice but to approach the boy and attempt to return him. </p><p>Slowly he approached the boy, stopping a few feet away from him, desperately trying not to be intimidating despite his usual condescending nature. Severus tried to relax his body language and make himself look approachable, otherwise there would be no hope of convincing the boy to return. Deciding that this was as good a time as any, he called out softly.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>The boy’s head shot up and his breathing quickened, his eyes darting around frantically as if deciding whether or not to make a run for it. Instead the boy remained rooted to the spot in all-consuming fear.</p><p>“Are you lost?” Severus asked gently.</p><p>Again there was no response, the boy just remained frozen, staring up at him in undisguised fear. </p><p>“Would you mind if I sat with you?” He whispered softly.</p><p>The child didn’t reply, yet he made no indication that he was going to bolt and so Severus crept closer until he was a couple of metres away from the boy. Severus then lowered himself to the ground, the deep snow freezing his bottom through his robes.</p><p>“What is your name?” He asked sensitively, keeping his warm gaze directed at the boy in the hope that he would open up.</p><p>The child seemed to contemplate whether or not to answer as he narrowed his eyes and tilted his head to the side as if inspecting a particularly strange looking creature. The boy whispered something but Severus couldn’t hear. </p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.”</p><p>“Harry…my name is Harry.” The boy stated quietly.</p><p>“Well, it’s nice to meet you, Harry. My name is Severus.” He replied, making a conscious effort to smile at the child. “How old are you, Harry?”</p><p>Instead of responding verbally, the boy held nine fingers out in front of him, staring at Severus with a searching gaze.</p><p>“My goodness, you are nearly in double figures!” Severus exclaimed excitedly in an attempt to make the boy relax. “Are you lost, Harry? It’s awfully cold out here.” He stated, noticing the shivers that were racking the boy’s body.</p><p>Harry shook his head in negation.</p><p>“Then what are you doing out in the woods all on your own?” He asked with growing concern.</p><p>“Hiding…from the bad people.” Harry whispered softly, hugging his legs even tighter to his chest.</p><p>“Who are the bad people and why are they looking for you, Harry?” Severus pried, confused as to where an earth the boy had come from.</p><p>It took a while for the boy to respond, yet he just made a swift swiping motion under his neck. Surely this child was just deluded or mentally unstable. Who would be so desperate to murder an innocent nine year old boy?</p><p>“I really think you should get out of the cold, Harry. It’s getting rather late, would you like to come home with me?” He offered, not that he would take any real notice of the boy’s answer. If he refused, Severus would just stun him and take him home anyway.</p><p>The boy looked up at him in shock and continue to scrutinise him.</p><p>Severus held his hands up in a surrendering motion. “I won’t hurt you, I promise. I just want to get you warm and fed.”</p><p>Harry nodded hesitantly before getting to his feet. “You promise…no hurt, Harry?”</p><p>“I promise, I won’t hurt you. I am a teacher and I would never harm a child, I work at a school here in Scotland.” Severus explained as he held out a hand invitingly.</p><p>Harry was hesitant, yet he slowly extended his had to hold his whilst maintaining a distance.</p><p>“Good boy. Alright, let’s go and warm you up.” He announced as he removed his robes and wrapped them around the shivering boy.</p><p>The pair took a few short steps when Severus’ wand fell from his pocket and onto the white blanket of snow beneath them. He scrambled around to pick it up quickly before the boy noticed and cursed himself for being so clumsy and disorganised, however the boy uttered something that he didn’t expect to hear.</p><p>“Wand.” Harry stated, pointing at the instrument that was now resting in his free hand.</p><p>“Yes.” Severus replied carefully. “And what does a wand do?” He asked. Maybe the boy had just seen magicians with their ridiculous plastic wands, he had to be sure before he divulged any information.</p><p>“Magic silly!” Harry stated as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “You’re a wizard…Harry wizard.” The boy said, pointing to himself for emphasis.</p><p>Was the boy’s temperature rising? Was he becoming delirious? Surely Harry wasn’t a wizard, no wizarding family would have any trouble locating their child if they were lost. Unless of course, he didn’t have a family. It does seem that he has escaped from some sort of hospital facility.</p><p>“Are you now?” Severus questioned sceptically.</p><p>Harry nodded his head before extending his hand, which now had a flower growing from it, it’s petals dancing in the keen wind. Severus was utterly astonished. The boy was a wizard after all. It transported him back to when he met his first friend, Lily. She had done a very similar thing and they quickly became best friends.</p><p>Swallowing past the lump that began to form in his throat at Lily’s memory, Severus transfigured a leaf into a butterfly which floated over towards Harry. The child beamed up at him and watched fascinatingly as the butterfly fluttered around him before vanishing.</p><p>“Well, knowing that you are a wizard makes my life considerably easier. Have you ever apparated before?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “No, but Harry’s heard of it…”</p><p>“Alright. It can make you feel a bit strange at first but it will be over before you know it. Would you mind if I carried you? It would make the experience much more pleasant for you and will ensure that you don’t let go.” Severus stated honestly.</p><p>At this, Harry backed away slightly, looking up at him with undisguised fear.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Harry?” He asked softly, mentally kicking himself for startling the child. He was hoping to make the boy feel safer, not the opposite.</p><p>“Harry’s scared…” The child admitted, his eyes travelling down to look at his feet.</p><p>“It’s alright, it won’t hurt.” Severus reassured him. “It will be over before you finish counting to five, I assure you.”</p><p>Harry seemed to contemplate this and he shuffled back over towards him, reaching his arms upwards. Severus scooped him up gently and rested the small boy on his hip.</p><p>“Alright, Harry. Hold on tight to me and when I say go, start counting to five. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>The boy nodded and closed his eyes tightly, resting his head against Severus’ chest.</p><p>“Okay three…two…one…go!” He said before apparating to his home at Spinner’s End.</p>
