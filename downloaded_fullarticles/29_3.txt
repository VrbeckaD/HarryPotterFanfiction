    <p>"Nice arse." James commented with a wolf whistle as he watched Scorpius bend down to pick up clothes from his floor.</p><p>Scorpius turned to face him, "Please take this seriously, James."</p><p>"I'm always serious about your arse." James said.</p><p>Scorpius shot him a glare in response and went back to perusing James' closet.</p><p>Today was an important day, he would be meeting Scorpius' father, Draco Malfoy. Scorpius had come to his flat early, demanding to know what he was going to wear. When James responded with 'Just some trousers and a shirt' Scorpius had marched into his room to start looking for something 'suitable to wear'. </p><p>"Where is that - Ah! Here it is!" Scorpius triumphantly pulled out a collared jumper, turning to face him. "Why don't you ever wear this?"</p><p>"Because it makes me look like a tosser." James muttered.</p><p>"You are a bloody tosser." Scorpius said then pushed the offending jumper into his hands.</p><p>James sighed, "Might as well look the part then." He took off the shirt he had on and pulled the offending jumper over his head. "Happy?"</p><p>"Very." Scorpius said with a smile then went to his drawers to find some trousers he assumed.</p><p>They had 'only' been dating 6 months. To Scorpius it was 'only', to James it has been the longest relationship he's ever had. His career wasn't very conducive for a relationship. Scorpius hadn't wanted his father to find out they were together yet. So they hid their relationship as best they could. Except with a big family like James' you could hardly keep any secret from them, so they had known. Especially since his brother was best friends with Scorpius.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them one day Skeeter had been watching them. That old hag was obsessed with his family. She had a good time he bet, writing her article, getting her rocks off. Harry Potter's oldest son with the Malfoy heir. The article had displayed a picture of James pressing Scorpius up against a wall in what they had thought was a secluded alley outside of the Leaky Cauldron. Not one of their finer moments. It wasn't his fault that he had a gorgeous boyfriend. </p><p> Scorpius' father had not been happy he had to find out this way so he requested to meet James, alone, without Scorpius. Scorpius had been beside himself about it. The fact that Scorpius' grandfather had sent him a howler going on about how Scorpius was a disgrace to the family had a lot to do with that. James was still planning Lucius Malfoy's comeuppance, the bastard. </p><p>James didn't really understand why Scorpius was reluctant about telling him. It's not like he had a bad relationship with his father. According to Scorpius he had been thrilled about him becoming friends with Albus. Everyone loved James Potter, a Chaser for the Applebee Arrows, charming, THE Harry Potter's eldest son. So why should Draco Malfoy be any different? Albus had so kindly reminded James that he had been awful to Scorpius during their school years. Certainly Draco Malfoy didn't know about that though? James decided against asking Scorpius about that, he didn't want to stress him out even more.</p><p>"They're just clothes does it really matter what I wear?" James questioned.</p><p>"Yes, yes it does! You want to make a good first impression." Scorpius stated, getting up from his spot on the floor, a pair of trousers in hand. They were dress trousers, he hadn't even been aware he owned them.</p><p>James stepped closer to Scorpius approaching him from behind. He wrapped his arms around his stomach, his head resting against the blonde's shoulder. "Aren't you supposed to be at work right now? Didn't we specifically pick this day because you would be working?"</p><p>Scorpius sighed, "I switched shifts. I won't be able to focus on much else today, I'd be useless at work."</p><p>This would not do at all. Scorpius' mind would need to be occupied today or else he'd obsess over this and drive himself mad. James would have to make sure he was distracted today. Unfortunately, Albus had left for a work trip last night so he was out. Rose was doing Godric-knows-what. He then thought of the perfect person. Yes, that would do nicely.</p><p>"James, you're too quiet. What are you planning?" Scorpius asked, suspicious. </p><p>"Nothing, nothing at all." James said, feigning innocence. He pressed a kiss to his neck. </p><p>"Put on your trousers." Scorpius ordered.</p>
