    <p>The office was not tidy, to say the least, but then Teddy Lupin had never been particularly fastidious about cleanliness in the way his father had been. (In the way he’d heard his father had been, at least.) But when his secretary told him who was at the door, he made a sincere three minutes worth of effort to combat the worst of it.</p><p>“Don’t clean on my account,” she said a no nonsense way, though the corners of her mouth were turned ever so slightly up.</p><p>“Wouldn’t want you thinking I work in squalor,” Teddy said sheepishly.</p><p>“And, what, reporting back to your godfather?” Hermione Granger-Weasley did laugh then, if only a little. “I recall his dorm at Hogwarts and his bachelor flat. You have nothing to fear, from me or him.”</p><p>“Well, then,” Teddy grinned, “do, ah, sit down.” He grabbed a pile of files off of the sofa and dumped them on his desk. “Tea?”</p><p>“Mmm,” Hermione nodded, but she was looking at the record player in the corner. “That was your father’s,” she said with a little smile, and Teddy nodded because he had known that. “He used to play it when he needed to concentrate. Though I never understood how he could concentrate on marking papers or planning missions with The Stooges on.”</p><p>Teddy felt that familiar tug in his heart, the one he always felt when he learned something new about his father, or thought too hard about him in general. It was different with his mother; Teddy had grown up with his maternal grandmother and learned all sorts of things about Nymphadora Tonks as he grew up. But Remus Lupin had left no family behind, and remained something of a mystery to Teddy.</p><p>He passed Hermione a cup of tea and set out some biscuits that weren’t too far off. Then he settled in behind his desk, because Hermione Granger-Weasley did not do wellness checks. She was here for a reason.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Hermione?” he asked, taking a slightly too hot sip of tea. It was just the way he liked it.</p><p>She smiled at him genuinely this time, and he took it to mean she appreciated him not wasting her time.</p><p>“Jamie Potter’s found something… interesting. Routing out a nest of villainous scum, as I understand Aurors generally do, he found a device which I would like your expert opinion on.”</p><p>Teddy tried very hard not to flush, but being called an expert by Hermione Granger-Weasley was quite the heady experience, particularly for someone who had grown up intimidated by her.</p><p>“I’ve already discussed payment with your secretary, and that should be no problem.” She paused, then frowned, then added, “Though you really aren’t charging enough you know. You should value your time and work better.”</p><p>Teddy bit back a laugh and nodded in acquiescence, because what else could you do with Hermione?</p><p><br/>

Teddy arrived first thing in the morning, coffee in hand. It was his second of the day. There was a Starbucks down the street from his flat and, as Teddy dressed exclusively in Muggle clothing, he was able to stop there frequently enough to keep him going.</p><p>“Oh, is that for me?” Jamie asked, reaching for the other cup Teddy held.</p><p>“Caramel latte,” Teddy confirmed as Jamie took a sip and groaned.</p><p>“Bless you, Tedward,” he said, using the joke name Jamie, Al, and Lils had thought funny as children.</p><p>“So, I hear you have something big to show me,” Teddy said.</p><p>Jamie winked. “Boy, do I ever, Lupin!” and Teddy snorted coffee.</p><p>“’S not what I meant, but if you’re really that proud of it, hell, I’ll be your boyfriend!”</p><p>“If only,” Jamie sighed dramatically. “But business first, pal. You’ve got to tell me what the hell this thing is.”</p><p>It was kept in the Department of Mysteries, which explained Hermione’s involvement.</p><p>“Huh,” Teddy said, perplexed. “Look, I know we both grew up in the Wizarding world, but Jamie… that’s an alarm clock. I admit, it’s an analog, and an antique, but --"</p><p>Jamie rolled his eyes. “Look closer, Lupin. And for goodness sake use your wand. I’m not here to pull your leg.”</p><p>A part of Teddy doubted that, but he took his wand out anyway and did a few diagnostic spells. And then a few more.</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“I know, right?”</p><p>“Jamie, this is…”</p><p>“A time machine?” Jamie’s eyes were lit up with excitement.</p><p>“Time machines don’t exist,” Teddy said, feeling the need to point out the obvious. “I mean, there used to be time turners, sure, but this…”</p><p>“This is no time turner,” Jamie agreed.</p><p>“Where did you find this again?”</p><p>“Couple of Death Eaters had it in their lair.”</p><p>Teddy rolled his eyes. “Oh, lord, are there still Death Eaters about?”</p><p>Jamie shrugged. “Voldemort has had a bit of a lasting effect, I’d say.”</p><p>Teddy stared at the object. It was sitting, unassuming, on a black cushion, which made its slightly tarnished surface gleam a little brighter. It was not, as he had previously thought, an alarm clock, though it did have similarities to one. For starters –</p><p>“Jamie, this is from the sixteenth century, at least.”</p><p>“Okay, good start. We were having a hard time dating it.”</p><p>Teddy reached a hand out, then stopped himself. “May I…? Will it…?”</p><p>“Go ahead,” Jamie nodded. “It won’t hurt you just to touch it, I don’t think.”</p><p>Teddy carefully picked up the… the time machine, adjusting his glasses with one hand out of habit more than anything.</p><p>It looked to be made of brass. There were three brass hands of increasing size, three brass dials on the back, presumably to wind them. The face was probably white or cream at one point, but had yellowed slightly with age. Around the face were a series of Roman numerals up to the number twelve, just like a real clock. On the back, a symbol etched into the metal.</p><p>“Talk to me,” a voice intruded as if from far away. “What do you see?”</p><p>Not a voice. Jamie Potter’s voice. Teddy felt himself come back to the present.</p><p>“This, right here, is the symbol of Leonardo da Vinci. He only used it on his wizarding work. Do you think you could get authorization to have his journals brought in?”</p><p>Jamie laughed. “I could probably get authorization to piss on them if it helps you explain this.”</p><p>“Well, I think we’ll hold off on that for the time being,” Teddy replied wryly.</p><p><br/>
*</p><p><br/>
The wizarding journals of Leonardo da Vinci were kept under strict lock and key, much like the Magna Carta or the Constitution of the United States of America. The only difference was that the wards were magical, not mechanical. Teddy didn’t know what kind of strings Hermione Granger-Weasley had pulled, but he was sure this was as average a day for her as it was extraordinary for him.</p><p>Teddy and Jamie spent about an hour going through the journals before they found something.</p><p>“Here, Ted,” Jamie said, pointing to the parchment in front him.</p><p>Teddy stood and walked to where Jamie was sitting, examining his portion of the journals. Sure enough, the specs were all drawn out there. Drawings and writing, little notes here and there, Teddy read it all, and things started coming together.</p><p>Teddy was taking notes frantically in his leather-bound journal. If he was going to do this, he would do it right. He could hear Jamie pacing behind him, and stopped writing.</p><p>“Ye-es?” Teddy asked, a little irritably.</p><p>“Food, Lupin. Have you heard of it?” Jamie asked, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Teddy stretched and thought about that. His stomach growled, sounding much louder in the quiet of the Department of Mysteries. It made Jamie laugh, and that made Teddy laugh too.</p><p>“Fish and chips,” he told Jamie. “And a pint. On you this time.”</p><p><br/>
*</p><p><br/>
The thing Teddy Lupin liked about Jamie Potter was that, even though he was not particularly philosophical, he was always willing to entertain Teddy’s moods.</p><p>Over dinner, they talked about Leonardo da Vinci, and time, and the nature of good and evil, and whether the government could be trusted. Teddy talked a lot, rather, and Jamie listened carefully, interjecting his own opinions and occasionally playing devil’s advocate or cracking a joke.</p><p>It was around the third pint that they started talking about what they would do, what they would change, with access to a real time machine.</p><p>“’s all theoretical, course,” Teddy pointed out. “But I guess I’d just like to meet my parents.”</p><p>“Aww,” Jamie cooed, but it wasn’t in a mean or teasing way. They were both a little tipsy was all.</p><p>By the fifth pint, they were verbally sketching out a timeline of world history since the fifties or sixties, trying to determine the best place at which to stop Voldemort’s rise.</p><p>“I say, about a year before James and Lily Potter went into hiding,” Teddy mused. “If you could catch him then, you’d save half the first Order.”</p><p>“Only if you think you could keep Pettigrew from defecting,” Jamie pointed out. He interrupted Teddy’s protestation with a wave. “But of course you do; you’re an idealist. You probably already had him on your list of people to save.”</p><p>“He was my father’s, and your grandfather’s, friend,” Teddy reminded him. “And he helped save your father in the end. I don’t know that he was evil, just frightened.”</p><p>Jamie though about that seriously, which Teddy liked about him. “Still think you’d have to go back far enough to kill baby Tom Riddle.”</p><p>“You could kill a baby?”</p><p>“The most evil baby ever?” Teddy stared him down. Jamie shrugged. “No. Maybe give him to Fleamont and Euphemia Potter?”</p><p>“You’d alter the timeline, then, and probably not even exist,” Teddy pointed out.</p><p>Now it was Jamie’s turn to stare him down. “If I had to not exist to set history right, that is a sacrifice I would gladly make.”</p><p>Teddy shifted uncomfortably. “Theoretically speaking,” he said.</p><p>“Theoretically speaking,” Jamie said with a nod and a grin.</p><p><br/>
*</p><p><br/>
A week later, Teddy was puttering around the flat, in his pajamas, making a little cup of tea to drink while he read before bedtime. There was a new history of the First War with Voldemort out that he wanted to read, especially since the index had, under L, listed “Lupin, Remus J.” along with several page numbers.</p><p>He had just set down his cup and was about to settle into his favorite reading chair when there was a knock at the door. Confused, as he was not expecting anyone, Teddy hesitated in case he was just hearing – no, there was another knock.</p><p>Looking through the peephole, Teddy saw a shadowy figure, and not much else. Definitely Muggle clothing. Perhaps someone was lost?</p><p>Then the figure turned slightly, the light caught them, and Teddy could see that it was Jamie Potter.</p><p>“Jamie?” Teddy asked, opening the door. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Jamie looked the same as when he was seven years old and broke Gran Andie's prize vase while Ted was babysitting him. The look was one part mischievous, one part defiance, and one part guilt. All parts adorable.</p><p>“James Sirius Potter,” Teddy said with all the adultness he could muster, “what have you done now?”</p>
