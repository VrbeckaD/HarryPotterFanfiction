    <p>            Currently, I’m in my room listening to some music. My medium length strawberry blond hair is pulled back in a pony tail as I lie on my stomach on my bed looking at some pictures from a photo album I’ve had since I could remember. In it were pictures of who I assumed was my real father and mother. It looks like I got my hair and blue eyes from my mom, but it seems I got my pale complexion from my father. Other than that, I couldn’t tell what he looks like because for some reason his face is really blurry. But I can tell he’s pretty tall, though. I’m assuming I got my height from my mom. Today is my eleventh birthday and my adoptive mom is downstairs getting everything ready for a birthday party. I’m pretty sure no one is going to come. None of the kids here in this little town of Carthage seem to like me. I don’t know why, but that’s their problem, not mine. My adoptive brother lives in London. He called and said he wasn’t able to make it. It made me really sad when mom told me. My adoptive brother, Mark, and I get along really well. He’s really nice and warm-hearted. Plus he’s always considerate of others. He did say he was going to send me a present though. I wonder what it is. “Lexi, come down stairs!” Mom yelled, causing me to sigh. I’m not looking forward to this party. I turned off the music and checked to make sure I looked okay. If I didn’t, mom would’ve thrown a fit. I’m wearing some plain jeans, a black tee shirt, and white sneakers.</p><p>            My adoptive father left us when I was younger because somehow I managed to catch his shoes on fire. He upset me pretty badly and then the next thing I knew his shoes were on fire. Mom put the fire out calmly and that seemed to upset him enough to leave us. She wasn’t too upset about him leaving. So I guess their marriage wasn’t doing so good. Mark wasn’t too upset about the news when she told him either. I guess he wasn’t that close to his dad either. Anyways, I made it downstairs and saw that the whole downstairs was decorated in birthday decorations. I frowned and went into the kitchen. “No one is going to come.” I said pessimistically.</p><p>            “They will,” Mom said optimistically. “I’ve made the cake and set out snacks and gift bags for everyone. I have a few games set up too.”</p><p>            “Please tell me you didn’t order a clown.” I said frowning.</p><p>            “Of course not, silly! You’re not five!” She said chuckling. “I thought about it though.”</p><p>            “I’m glad you didn’t.” I said sighing. It would’ve just been a waste of money.</p><p>            “Why are you so adamant that no one is going to show up?” She asked me curiously.</p><p>            “It’s obvious that none of them like me. Plus a few of them even told me that. So we’re just wasting our time with this.” I said frowning. It honestly hurt my feelings a little. I never had any friends no matter how hard my mom tried to get me involved with the other kids here. “It’s like I have a force field around me or something.”</p><p>            “Well, if they don’t show up, then your presents from your brother and I will definitely cheer you up.” She said smiling.</p><p>            “Thanks.” I said smiling too. And like I predicted, no one showed up.</p><p>            “Well that just means there’s more cake for us.” Mom said putting everything away. I helped her tear down all of the decorations and stuff. Afterwards, she sat me down in the kitchen and got this real serious look on her face. “Honestly, I’m not sure if you’ll like my present. It’s not an object.”</p><p>            “So you didn’t get me one?” I asked confused.</p><p>            “No, but this is the best I can do.” She said smiling sheepishly. I nodded. “Okay, now this is going to sound crazy, but you and I are witches and we possess magic.”</p><p>            “What... what does that mean?” I asked feeling really confused now.</p><p>            “I’ll have to show you...” She muttered to herself, before she pulled out something that looked like a stick. She waved it and a knife cut a piece of cake all by itself and the cake slice went onto a plate and sat itself in front of me, fork included. I could feel my jaw drop.</p><p>            “I’m not sleeping am I?” I asked wide-eyed. She laughed.</p><p>            “No, sweetie, you’re not. Do you remember when Ben’s shoes caught on fire that one time?” She asked me.</p><p>            “Yeah, it just happened out of nowhere.” I muttered frowning.</p><p>            “Not just out of nowhere,” She said smiling. “That was your accidental magic.”</p><p>            “Accidental magic?” I asked frowning. I’m having a hard time believing this.</p><p>            “Yes, every young witch or wizard growing up has accidental magic. Even I did it.” She said calmly. How is she being so calm right now? She acts like this is such a normal thing to be talking about! Maybe it is something normal to her.</p><p>            “Okay, how did you do what you just did with the cake?” I asked trying to be logical about this.</p><p>            “This is my wand. It channels my magic and allows me to do things like that.” She said still smiling.</p><p>            “Okay, where did you learn to do that?” I asked curious now.</p><p>            “I learned it at the magic school called Hogwarts. It’s in Scotland.” She answered with ease.</p><p>            “What is a ‘Hogwarts’?” I asked still having issues processing all of this. She chuckled.</p><p>            “I just told you. It’s a school of witchcraft and wizardry. You go there for seven years and you’ll learn all kinds of magic spells and about different magical creatures and plants.” She said patiently. “I think you’ll enjoy going there.”</p><p>            “Wait, I’m going there?” I asked in surprise.</p><p>            “Yes, we’re just waiting for your letter to arrive. It should be here in August. After it comes in the mail, we’ll be going to London so we can get your school stuff.” She said thoughtfully.</p><p>            “Can I just take a few hours to process all of this?” I asked feeling like my head will explode. She nodded.</p><p>            “Of course, take your time dear. And then I’ll give you your present from your brother.” She said smiling at me. I nodded and went back to my room. I plopped on my bed, belly side down, and sighed. What is even going on here? I don’t know if she’s just joking with me or if she’s being completely serious. I know that I believe her to an extent. I mean I can’t explain away with what happened with the cake or the whole incident with Ben’s shoes being on fire. Those I definitely believe could’ve been magic. If I got a wand like she has, I could learn how to control my magic. But what would I use it for and would I make any friends by doing this? I guess there’s only one way to find out. I sighed and rolled over on my back. I ended up falling asleep and my mom woke me up some time later.</p><p>            “I believe you mom.” I told her as soon as I sat up. She smiled.</p><p>            “I’m glad to hear it. I’ve brought you your present from Mark.” She said sitting a big box down on the bed. It looked really heavy. I opened it and saw that there were a bunch of books in there. “These are your school books for this year. He said since you were going to start this year, he decided to get them for you ahead of time.” I pulled them out one by one and read the titles. Hogwarts, a History, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, The Standard Book of Spells Vol. 1, The Beginners’ Guide to Transfigurations, Magical Theory, One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, Magical Drafts and Potions, and The Dark Forces; A Guide to Self-Protection.</p><p>            “We need all of these?” I asked wide-eyed.</p><p>            “Yep, it’s essential for every 1<sup>st</sup> year to have.” She said smiling.</p><p>            “When will I get a wand like yours?” I asked curiously.</p><p>            “Once we get to London to get the rest of your things.” She said thoughtfully. “I’ll need to call Mark and let him know when we’re coming.”</p><p>            “We’re going to see Mark?” I asked excitedly.</p><p>            “Of course and hopefully we’ll run into a good friend of mine. She has a nice family and all of her children will be attending Hogwarts as well.” She said just as excitedly. “I haven’t had the chance to really talk to her in awhile. Since owls aren’t common creatures during the day with all of these Muggles around.”</p><p>            “Owls? Muggles?” I asked getting confused again.</p><p>            “Right, one thing at a time,” She reminded herself. “Okay, so wizards and witches use owls to send letters to each other. They don’t have a telephone, so that’s one of the ways they communicate with each other from long distances. On a side note, electronics don’t work around magic. And Muggles is a term we use for those who do not posses magic. We are required by the Ministry to keep our existence a secret from them.”</p><p>            “What’s the Ministry?” I asked frowning.</p><p>            “The Ministry is the government of the witches and wizards over in Europe. It’s kind of like the American government here, with the president and what not.” She explained. “I was born in the U.K. but I moved here to settle down. But over there, the Prime Minister for the Ministry is Cornelius Fudge.”</p><p>            “Oh, I see.” I said thinking I was getting it. “Is that where Mark works at?”</p><p>            “Yes, he works in the same department as my friend’s husband.” She said smiling. “Her kids are very kind hearted souls and two of them I know for sure you’ll click with. You like to prank some of the kids here and those two are pranksters themselves.”</p><p>            “Really?” I asked eagerly. I can’t wait to meet them.</p><p>            “Yes. Now, I’m going to start dinner.” She said chuckling. “I’m sure you’ll want to read some of those books.”</p><p>            “I do.” I said wanting to read them now.</p><p>            “You can read them until dinner is ready.” She told me before she left the room. I looked in the box and pulled out Hogwarts, a History. Hm... This looks like a good place to start. I thought as I opened it to the first page. A few hours later, mom comes in and tells me it’s time for dinner. “How is the reading going?”</p><p>            “It’s definitely interesting.” I said smiling. “I can’t wait to move on to the other books.”</p><p>            “You have two months before school starts to read them all.” She said chuckling. “It’s starts on September 1<sup>st</sup>.” Ugh, why did it have to be two months away? But that’s okay. I have all of these books to keep me preoccupied.</p>
