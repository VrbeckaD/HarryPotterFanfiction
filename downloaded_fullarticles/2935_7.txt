    <p>The war was over and the light had won, but the casualty list was high. In the end Voldemort and the Death Eaters had put up a strong fight. It was late November when the final battle happened taking many from this world. Professor Flitwick, Susan Bones, Percy Weasley topped the list of the fallen heroes but highest on the list and the greatest loss was Hermione Granger.</p><p>Severus Snape sat at the hearth of his dungeon home and contemplated the loss of Hermione. Theirs had been an awkward tumultuous relationship that had grown despite the war into strong friendship and even love. Not that he had ever discussed his love for her with her but he felt it nonetheless. It had been enough for Hermione that he hadn’t pushed her away.</p><p>Here it was early December and Severus was upset that he had survived the war when she hadn’t. The wrongness of it was overwhelming to him and that is why he sat there drinking brandy and waiting for the potion, that would take his life, to cool and then it would be done over and he would be reunited with his beloved.</p><p>Over and over he couldn’t fathom why she had loved him but he knew for certain that she had without limit. She had challenged him and infuriated him but in the end she had always loved him no matter how he acted towards her.</p><p>It had been the middle of March when Hermione had decided to leave Hogwarts where she was Minerva’s apprentice. He still wasn’t sure why she had gone out at all but in the end he would never know. There was a Death Eater attack in town and she was caught in the middle of it. Witnesses reported seeing her being hit by a curse but her body was never recovered and she was listed as dead. </p><p>From then on he fought the war for her in her memory so that other Muggle-born would never suffer her fate. He was more resolute about his spying and took pleasure in setting traps for Death Eaters to be captured each punished for their crimes against her.</p><p>Looking over on the side table Severus looked at the vial of potion cooling and placed a finger lightly on its side. Almost cool enough ten more minutes then I will be with her again and I will be able to tell her… </p><p>Startled he heard a knock at the door and audibly groaned knowing it was Albus. He stood and opened the door.</p><p>“Albus..”</p><p>“Evening Severus, may I come in?” </p><p>“If I tell you no will that stop you?”</p><p>Albus chuckled as he walked past the younger wizard, his eyes falling on the vial of potion on the table. The twinkle left his eyes but he didn’t say anything about it.</p><p>“Albus? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Albus turned to him with a sad look on his face.</p><p>“Is there nothing that will comfort you now that the dark days are over?”</p><p>Severus snorted. For him the dark days had never left and he had only seen glimpses of light in Hermione’s presence. Now that it was all over he just wanted it to end.</p><p>“Well then I will not try to stop you but would you be so kind to take a walk with me before you leave this earth?”</p><p>A myriad of emotions went through Severus that were reflected in his eyes before his shoulders slumped The potion will be here when I get back. What is 20 more minutes on this earth compared to an eternity with her. His nod was imperceptible but he opened the door and waited for Albus to join him.</p><p>“Care for a lemon drop, Severus?”</p><p>“No thank you, Albus”</p><p>“Pity. They have such restorative qualities.”</p><p>The two walked in silence toward Hogsmead and Severus wondered what was the point of going in the first place. When they got to the apparition point Albus turned to Severus and clasped the other man’s hand.</p><p>“ If I cannot bring you comfort then at least I bring you joy."</p>
