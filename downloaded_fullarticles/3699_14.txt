    <p>On Alexander’s tenth birthday, he sat by the door an hour before his father usually arrived and waited for him to walk in to wish Alexander a happy birthday. Several hours after his father was meant to have been home and settled down, his mother, Rachel, walked over and picked up a drooping Alexander, who was nearly asleep on the floor in front of their front door. She didn’t have the heart to tell her baby that his father was never coming home again, so she gave him a quick kiss on the top of his head and tucked him into the only bed in their small house.</p><p>The next morning, Alexander went to sit attentively by the door once more, while Rachel went through the things Alexander’s father left behind in his study, hoping to find something to sell to earn enough money for dinner that night. Wadding through spell books and strange objects with glowing symbols on them, she eventually found several old colorful robes she could pull apart and sell the fabric. </p><p>She walked back towards the front of the house and called out to Alexander. “Alex, honey, we’re going into town. Go put on your shoes.”</p><p>Alexander turned away from the door for the first time in hours. “But what if father comes home while we’re gone?” he asks with wide innocent eyes and a sad frown on his face.</p><p>Rachel sighed, drawing Alexander into her arms. Alex, your father isn’t coming back.” Tears began to fall down her cheeks. “I’m sorry.” She hid her face in her son’s shoulder, sobbing harder. “He’s not coming back, and I don’t know if I can provide for you on my own. I’m so sorry.” </p><p>Alexander wrapped his small arms around her shaking frame and hugged her as tight as he could.</p>
<hr/><p>The summer after Alexander turned eleven, an owl flew through the open window, dropping an envelope on the old, beat up kitchen table right in front of where Alexander was sitting. Startled, he cautiously picked it up as the owl flew back out the way it came.</p><p>Mr. A. Hamilton<br/>
Main Street<br/>
Charlestown<br/>
Nevis</p><p>“Mother, it’s a letter for me,” he said, looking over to where Rachel was washing laundry for a few coins from some of their wealthier neighbors.</p><p>She looked up from her scrubbing. “Who’s it from?”</p><p>Alexander flipped the envelope over, noticing the purple wax seal with a coat of arms bearing a lion, eagle, badger, and a snake, all surrounding a large letter H. “It doesn’t say.”</p><p>“Well you’d best open it up and find out then,” she said with a small knowing smile.</p><p>Alexander carefully peeled up the wax holding the envelope closed and pulled out the letter to read what was written on it in dark blue ink that seemed to shine gold in the light. </p>
<hr/><p align="center">HOGWARTS SCHOOL<br/>
Of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY<br/>
Headmaster: George Washington</p><p>Dear Mr. Hamilton,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.</p><p>Yours,<br/>
George Washington<br/>
Headmaster</p>
<hr/><p>“It’s from the headmaster of a school named Hogwarts? This must be a joke. I’ve been invited to a school that studies wizardry by someone named George Washington. He claims to be the headmaster.”</p><p>Rachel dropped the laundry she was washing into a basin with a quiet splash. Walking over to peak over Alexander’s shoulder, she read the letter with a smile on her lips. “It’s not a joke. You’d best reply to Professor Washington, accepting the invitation.” She patted his shoulder firmly before walking into her ex-husband’s study. </p><p>Alexander had never been allowed in that room, even before his father had abandoned them, so he could only guess what his mother could be going in there for now. Rather than worrying about it, he pulled a stub of a pencil out of a drawer and rummaged around for a sheet of paper not already covered in his messy scrawl. Finding a small sheet of slightly wrinkled paper out from under a pile of bills and smoothing it down, he began to write.</p>
<hr/><p>Dear Professor Washington,</p><p>I would be honored to accept your kind invitation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am shocked to learn of the existence of such a school a school, since I was previously unaware that magic itself was not a figment of my imagination. Never-the-less, I am excited by the prospect of learning an art most men are lead to believe is fictional.</p><p>Before attending, I must first express some of my concerns. You see, my mother and I live alone in a small home, barely able to provide for our daily needs. I fear we will not have the means necessary to fund tuition to such a school, nor the ability to gain transport. It is with much hesitance that I ask for not only the knowledge that sending me to such a school will not force my dearest mother to go without the most basic necessities, but also assistance reaching the location of your school.</p><p>If these accommodations cannot be made, I’m afraid I will be unable to attend your most prestigious place of study, so I must apologize.</p><p>I thank you most humbly for this opportunity and hope you grace me with a swift reply.<br/>
</p><p>Yours Truly,<br/>
A. Ham</p>
<hr/><p>Signing the letter, Alexander wished he could write more, asking all about Hogwarts and what he would be studying, but he only had the space on the single, small paper to work with, so he had to restrain himself to only what absolutely needed to be said.</p><p>Just then, Rachel walked back into the kitchen, carrying what looked like a cauldron with fabric inside. “Alex, can you tell me what materials you need?”</p><p>Alex pulled out the second page of the letter from Professor Washington, beginning to read:</p><p>Uniform<br/>

Your father left a lot of that behind from when he attended Hogwarts,” she said with a smile, showing him the cauldron he held in her hands.</p><p>Alexander took the cauldron and began pulling out black wizard robes, gloves, a pointed hat, and a cloak.</p><p>“I’m glad I never sold those off. Although, the robes and cloak are a bit large. Your father was quite a bit taller than you are when he first attended Hogwarts. I think I’ll be able to hem them to fit you better before September,” Rachel said, comparing the robes to Alexander’s frame.</p><p>“Mother, why didn’t I know father was a wizard? And you shouldn’t worry about making the robes fit me. You don’t have the time for that.” Alexander only began to worry mother as his mother pulled more supplies out of the cauldron, setting glass phials and a set of scales onto the table. </p><p>“Your father didn’t want you to know unless you ended up a wizard yourself. Always doubted you’d be magical, but I knew better.” Alexander could tell his mother was using the word magical in more than just the literal sense. He gave her a bright smile as she continued. “And don’t be foolish. We can’t have you tripping over your clothes on your first day just because you were too busy talking to notice your own two feet on the very first day.” Rachel gave Alexander a wide smile as he blushed from embarrassment, knowing he would do exactly that if his mother wasn’t so kind.</p><p>Alexander smiled, giving her a tight hug. “Thank you, mother. I love you.”</p><p>Rachel squeezed Alexander tightly. “I love you too, honey.” She pulled back and went toward Alexander’s father’s study once more. “Come on Alex. Let’s see if we can find some of those books and some empty phials. I hope your father left his telescope behind when he left.”</p><p>Alexander followed behind his mother, curiosity bubbling up. As he stepped into the room, his jaw dropped. There were glowing crystals with runes carved into them, phials filled with strange plants and potions, books piled high on every surface, and so many more mysterious objects of unknown origins. “It’s amazing,” he said in awe.</p><p>He began by looking through the books, looking for the ones listed on his letter, along with anything he might want to read in his spare time, which might as well have been every book his fingers touched.</p><p>The two of them were glad to find most of the books on the list when they finished sorting through the room, only having to buy <em>A History of Magic</em> and <em>The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection</em>. </p><p>Rachel Picked up a few of the glowing rocks and crystals, placing them in a bag at her side. “Hopefully these will sell in a second-hand shop for enough to buy your wand,” she said with a wink.</p><p>Alexander smiled, happy to know his mother wouldn’t pay for everything out of pocket, before realizing something. “Mother, what kind of shop could we sell glowing stones in? Where do I even get a wand? Or any of these other things? And another thing-”</p><p>Rachel placed a finger against Alexander’s mouth, knowing he might never stop once he starts asking questions unless he’s stopped. “Alex honey, hush. Did you finish your reply to Professor Washington?”</p><p>Alexander no ded, his mother’s hand still keeping him quiet.</p><p>“Good.” She gave him a large smile. “It’s late. Tuck your letter somewhere safe for the night and we can go out tomorrow.”</p><p>Alexander nodded again, and his mother finally withdrew. Heading off to their single bed, he dressed into a soft shirt that was too large on him and tucked himself in. He fell asleep quickly due to all the excitement, unable to wait for the next day to come.</p>
