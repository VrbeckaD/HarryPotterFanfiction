  <em>February 2, 2015</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was late evening when Pleione Potter completed her journey to America. Travelling via portkey still made her nauseous. She was unceremoniously dumped onto a hard surface as she never quite perfected her form. The Potter heiress was thankful it was late at night and she had time to catch her bearings. If forced to move, she believed she would be sick. Just chunder right there in the streets.</p><p>Eventually her breathing evened out and her head stopped spinning. Still nauseous and worn out she knew she would still be feeling the effects of international travel for a few days. The night was dull and dreary. Clouds and smog covered most the sky, with very few stars visible. The weather almost reminded her of England.</p><p>Forcing herself up into a sitting position, she observed her surroundings. She had landed on pavement and no one was out on either end of the street, but she could hear the city loud and clear. Aptly named, the City That Never Sleeps, New York, was full of life even on a weekday night. It was jarring for her, having spent most of her life in the quiet suburbs of Surry or the deep country of Europe’s magical community.</p><p>Now her stomach bothered her from a different feeling, a mixture of apprehension and excitement. Britain was quiet even in highly populated areas, there was only that small hum that was easily overlooked. But here, that could never be true. New York City demanded attention.</p><p>Back home despite the hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley she was easily spotted amongst the crowd. Pleione was tired of her life being on the front page of the <em>Daily Prophet</em> and craved anonymity. Even with the benefits of magic she barely had any privacy and couldn’t trust the intentions of most witches and wizards that approached her. The One Who Lived saved magical Britain and would not spend another decade trapped in a house. Especially one she owned. So the only option left, was to move far enough away where magical Britain’s reach could not extend to her anymore.</p><p>America was very young in terms of magical history and her many communities were diverse and not as set in traditions as Britain or China. Ideally, no one would care she was The Pleione Potter. Out of all the magical lands in the world, America was the most advanced in mixing muggle and magical lifestyle. American citizens laughed at all the “inbred backwater hicks” like her and those back in Europe. It was the perfect land to get lost in, and may Merlin and Morgana help any who attempted to find her. For they would also get lost in this land of dreams. It helped, that in this country citizens usually spoke English, though crude and broken as it was. Overall, she felt she could fit right in and be comfortable in America, in ways she never was in England.</p><p>Accompanied by goodbyes from those closest to her, she left. With what she hoped was the silent approval of those she lost during the war; she moved across the ocean. To Manhattan. Without planning her future path. For two decades Fate dictated her life before she was even born. Pleione was excited to see where magic and her own choices could lead her. Though there was no snow on the ground, it was brass monkeys outside as Ron would have said, and she needed to find shelter. Turning sharply on her heel she headed from what looked to be an industrial complex and began walking towards hopefully main roads. All she had to do was head towards the noise and lights, and she was sure she would be fine.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For some time, the only sound that could be heard was her breath and the echoes of her footsteps on pavement. At times city noise or more correctly muggle noise, would blare loudly reminding her she was not alone. The new chapter of her life was starting now. Smog still blocked the stars and she made a note to find a place once she was set-up where she could get a clear view of them. She wanted to compare the sky to what she would see when she would lay out at the Burrow or more recently the rooftop of Grimmauld Place.</p><p>Her first view of an American was interesting. Lost in her own thoughts, she did not notice the man until only a few feet separated them. Instinct and honed reflexes moved her body without conscious thought and the Elder wand was pointed directly at him. She was just as spooked of the homeless man hiding in the shadows as he was of her. He bolted before she could state her intentions to not harm him. Pausing a breath, she decided for safety and peace of mind to keep the wand out and gripped loosely in her hand. If she needed to, she could always quickly place it up a sleeve and appear normal.</p><p>Soon lamps lined the streets and she was coming up to a bridge that was almost glowing in light. Looking up into the distant sky she could finally see enough lights to blind her. The lights ascended to heights she never thought imaginable; as if they could reach the stars. Vibrant colors outshone even the stars and it took her breath away. The sight warmed her in an impossible way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When she just came up to the lighted bridge she noticed a commotion in an empty lot to her left. Instinct almost over took her. Senses stretched out, while she attempted to keep her distance and not draw attention to herself. It became clear she was witnessing a fight; a fist fight. Not a mugging and they repeatedly swung at each other. It was none of her business but it seemed dodgy, and her magic flared inside of her, ready to lash out.</p><p>The men seemed empowered, driven by instinct. It was like watching a fight between death eaters and members of the DA. It was raw and emotional; it was not an even fight. Silently, Pleione cast a <em>homenum revelio </em>spell, and learned that though their focus was solely on each other there were two others farther back in the empty lot, and a few in the large motor cars. No one else was around this late in the night in a deserted area to witness or interfere. No, this was a private matter being dealt with violently. </p><p>Two decades of habits, of behaviors, spurred her into action when she realized that the large bald man in a well tailored suit was not going to stop and most likely would kill the other man. As the smaller man slid down to the ground no longer able to defend himself, she realized with horror, the aggressor’s next move. He begged for help before giving up as it went ignored. Drawing up her magic she made her decision and interfered. As he reached towards the open car door she whispered.</p><p><em>“Ossis Effergo!</em>” A blue light left her wand tip streaking across the distance and hitting her opponent directly. The power of her curse slammed into him less than a full blink after she cast it. Striking his upper side at where his arm met his shoulder; shattering half a dozen bones instantly and throwing him off balance.</p><p>The start of her battle chain continued flowing by instinct. Launching what was her favorite spell as a teenager; a red light collided with the aggressive bald man and he was promptly knocked unconscious, dropping to the ground- his cry of pain cu off. Following up she cast the disillusionment charm to provide cover and weak safety.</p><p>These men were muggles and before anyone else could move to interfere or connect what was happening, she summoned the barely conscious man to her in an effort to save him. He collided with her legs jarringly, and moaned barely conscious.  With compassion and a tinge of regret, she silently stunned the injured man, and disapparated on the spot with a loud crack.</p><p> </p><p>Now Luna’s parting words were a lot clearer, welcome to Hell’s Kitchen, indeed.</p>
