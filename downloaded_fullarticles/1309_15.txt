    <p>I had just come back from buying some prank supplies at Zonko's Joke Shop in Hogsmeade. I was preparing to get back at my least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Severus Snape.</p><p>This man was awful. He was cruel and vile. He had given me a hard time since first year. Now I was in fourth.</p><p>Tomorrow in class i would show him just how much he deserved what was coming to him.</p><p>The next morning,</p><p>I got ready for breakfast as usual.</p><p>Then I left for the Great Hall.</p><p>In the extravagant dining hall, decorations for Halloween adorned the ceiling.</p><p>I kept a blank face as my eyes looked up to the High Table.</p><p>The Potions Master was watching me from above with a deep frown next to Dumbledore.</p><p>He then turned to the Headmaster and the two continued talking.</p><p>I ate quickly and then left for Potions.</p><p>My plan was simple. I would wait for Severus to arrive in class and then I'd throw one of the dungbombs under his desk. I had more I could use, but two or three should be good enough to get the message across to leave me the fuck alone, right?</p>
