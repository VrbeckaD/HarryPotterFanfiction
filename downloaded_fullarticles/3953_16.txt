<p>Promises Kept</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“This isn’t happening, is it?” </p>
<p>“No, sorry. I thought I could, but—”</p>
<p>“Well, that answers that.” </p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>“Whether you like fanny or cock.” </p>
<p>“You…knew?” </p>
<p>“I should have, given the way you look at Potter—”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” </p>
<p>“No. Remember our childhood promise?” </p>
<p>“Which one? We promised to get married, and I don’t think that’s happening—”</p>
<p>“Obviously not. No, I meant when we promised we’d never lie to each other.” </p>
<p>“Right. Okay. What about that?” </p>
<p>“Since I can’t have you, I’m getting you Potter.” </p>
<p>“Pansy!” </p>
<p>“You can thank me later. Now let’s get dressed. Your limp dick’s depressing me.” </p>
<p>“Depressing <i>you</i>?” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“So, how was your date with Potter?”</p>
<p>“Fine.” </p>
<p>“Did you invite him up to see your etchings?” </p>
<p>“A gentleman doesn’t kiss and tell.” </p>
<p>“Oh no, you don’t! I deserve details!” </p>
<p>“Pansy!” </p>
<p>“Ugh, fine. Tell me if you got it up for him at least.” </p>
<p>“<i>Pansy</i>!” </p>
<p>“Oh, so he fucked you, then?” </p>
<p>“I’m not discussing this with you!” </p>
<p>“Why not? I promised you Potter and I delivered, and this is how you repay me?” </p>
<p>“No. I plan to repay you with a date with Weasley.” </p>
<p>“Oh please! He’s smitten with Granger.”</p>
<p>“<i>George</i> Weasley.” </p>
<p>“Oh! Isn’t he the rich one?” </p>
<p>“You’re welcome.” </p>
