</p><p>“Potter!” Draco shouts and the moment his husband turns around, he throws a large ball of snow right at Harry, catches him completely off guard and laughs as Harry stands there with snow in his unruly hair, in his beard and, of course, stuck to his black winter coat. “Don’t you look smashing all covered in snow, <em>handsome</em>,” Draco teases and continues to laugh as Harry growls, bends down and scoops up two handfuls of snow. Draco watches him with amusement and calculated suspicion, waits for Harry to make a move, then crouches down and chuckles when Harry’s snowball soars right past him. “You’re an abysmal chaser, Potter,” Draco mocks, “if only you’d played that position while we were Hogwarts, I might have actually won a few matches against you.”</p><p>“Living on the edge today, Malfoy, aren’t you?” Harry glares, draws his wand and a second later Draco miraculously loses his footing and finds himself sitting in the snow, the cold wet seeping through his black jeans and boxer shorts. He glowers at Harry, gets back onto his feet and stalks over to where his husband is standing, wand still in hand, laughing without unrestraint. He places both hands on Harry’s shoulders, forces him backwards, past a snow-covered iron-wrought bench and continues to do so until he’s got his husband firmly backed up against one of the large trees, covered in Christmas lights, lining either side of the park’s footpath.</p><p>“Can’t get one over me unless you use a wand, can you now, Potter?” He snarls, keeps Harry firmly pressed up against the tree and leans close enough to feel Harry’s ragged breath on his lips.</p><p>“I think we both know I can,” Harry murmurs and the conviction in his eyes sends a jolt of excitement through Draco. He knows very well that Harry is well able to get one over him, it’s just that half of the time Harry, deliberately, doesn’t even try. When he does, he always, without fail, wins. Draco sighs, is about to withdraw and continue their leisurely stroll through New York’s famed Central Park when Harry brings his arms up and locks them around the back of Draco’s neck. “Thank you for staying here with me,” he whispers and before Draco has the chance to say anything in response, Harry presses his lips tightly against his. Draco swallows whatever is on the tip of his tongue, deems it as not important, and melts into the kiss, melts into the familiar embrace of Harry’s strong and muscular body.</p><p>He doesn’t particularly like Harry’s beard, but it’s slowly growing on him. He likes the weird softness of it, likes it more than he cares to admit. (<em>Then again, it’s not like he needs to confess to Harry exactly how he feels about his facial hair.</em>) What especially amazes him about it though is that it’s not at all spiky or rough, unlike say the hairs that grow on Harry’s legs, but insanely soft. Draco thinks that if Harry doesn’t shave that beard off before Christmas rolls around, he’ll have developed a very unhealthy kink for Harry Potter’s beard.</p><p>When Harry grudgingly breaks their kiss, they are both breathless and Draco just wants to apparate them back to that lovely penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side he rented for them both — not necessarily because he wants to have his wicked way with Harry, although that’s always a bonus, but because his bum is wet and he’s getting cold. The apartment had been a rather futile attempt to alleviate Harry’s rancour over the third extension of his assignment with the American Auror Team. Draco knows very well that having to spend Christmas away from London, away from his adopted family, away from everything he is familiar with and holds dear is weighing heavily on his husband. <em>At least he’s got me</em>, Draco thinks and wonders whether he is being preposterous and overconfident in how much his husband really needs him.</p><p>“I’m going to give up being an Auror when we get back to London, if they ever let me leave that is,” Harry sighs and his confession startles Draco just a little. He thinks Harry must be joking, he knows his husband, knows that he enjoys nothing better than chasing down bad guys and turning the Department of Magical Law Enforcement upside down with his resolute mission to clean the place up.</p><p>“You are kidding, Potter,” Draco says, though not without a flicker of doubt.</p><p>“Nuh-huh, I hate this place,” he insists and Draco frowns at him.</p><p>“I think you hate the assignment extension more than the fact that you’re stuck in New York.”</p><p>“Wrong again, Malfoy. I don’t like this city. It’s big, it’s noisy, it never sleeps, the food is vile and that American Auror task force they have me working with wouldn’t know what sarcasm is if I hit them in the face with it.”</p><p>“They also haven’t been in a relationship with a Slytherin for the last fifteen years, so go easy on them,” Draco smirks. “I suspect my dark humour has finally rubbed off on you, Potter.”</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes, doesn’t say anything to that and Draco vows to find a way to make his husband fall in love with New York. Not that he is overly thrilled over the fact that they must spend Christmas abroad — <em>well Harry must, strictly speaking Draco is free to return to London any time he wants to, which he isn’t planning to do unless it’s together with Harry</em> — but he also thinks that Christmas is magical and Christmas in New York especially so. He reaches for Harry’s hands, unclasps them from where they are still resting at the back of his neck, interlaces their fingers and taking a step back he drags Harry back onto the footpath. There is a lovely small stone bridge not far from here that offers a gorgeous view of the night sky and New York’s famous skyscrapers and Draco is determined to start his quest at getting Harry to enjoy their time in New York right there.</p>
