    <p>Chapter 1: massacre </p><p> </p><p>Sirius wasn't certain what happened.  One moment he was fine.  Then suddenly a swooping sensation wove through his entire being.  It's a bit like coming down the stairs in the dark only to forget about the last step.  It was as if he was appariated without being prepared beforehand.  It only lasted a moment but it left him reeling.</p><p>A sudden explosion rocks the area.  Debris and object fly past, pushed out violently by the enormous pressure.  It's only when a second explosion occurs, this one clearly caused by gunpowder, that he realizes what happened.  Harry!</p><p>He and Harry are bound, their magic linking them.  It's something he did in the early days so he would never lose his most precious godson.  It was an old blood bonding, dark magic sure but necessary.  </p><p>And now that link is severed.  Even without the absence of the link he would know now.  The explosion is proof alone.  All the items Harry kept shrunken, all the items kept safe under his magic, are destroyed.  The power feeding the spells is gone.  </p><p>Harry is gone.  </p><p>His pup is gone!</p><p>He's alone now.</p><p>Everyone... every last one... is gone.</p><p>...............</p><p> </p><p>Some days are good ones.  Some days Sirius feels like his old self.  He thinks clearly.  He feels concern for others, not just those in their group but all of the people out there.</p><p>On those days, he is proud of the group they've put together.  He wants to get to know them.  He thinks of them as friends.  He thinks of them as his responsibility.</p><p>On those days, he's almost the gryffindor he once was.  He feels like an auror again, almost a hero.  He thinks his friends would be proud. Those days are rare.</p><p>............</p><p>Some days are only slightly off.  It's either being numb to the world or at least indifferent to it all.  Those days padfoot leads.  His human mind incapable of anything so the animal mind leads.</p><p>On those days, he knows he's dangerous.  Padfoot only sees pack and not pack.  If you're pack, there's nothing he wouldn't do.  If you're not pack, you're a threat.  And padfoot doesn't handle threats well.</p><p>At first, only Harry was pack.  That was simpler.  All he had to do was keep Harry happy and safe.  He did that easily.  Harry seemed happy just to be with him.</p><p>Then Harry found his pup.  Padfoot didn't see it then.  It was just a couple not pack.  It was just a threat, a noisy threat.  And padfoot would never risk Harry for some noisy not pack.</p><p>Padfoot never left Harry that day.  Black may have appariated away but padfoot didn't let them go far.  He watched his pup escape, clinging to the boy.  It confused him, why his pup chose this not pack over him, but he decided to follow.  It was easy talking with the not pack.  Sometimes, Sirius would even be in charge.</p><p>Padfoot came to accept Harry's pup.  Then there was Harry's mates, even if he only beds one of them now they are both Harry's.  Some of their group edged closer, becoming almost pack just by being close and dependable.  But it takes a long time to become pack if you're not pack.</p><p>............</p><p>Rarely, it's Black that's in charge.  Black is everything his family bred.  He breathes black magic, soaks in blood and death.  </p><p>He's vicious, domineering, violent.  He's the one that threw the baby to the walkers instead of just snapping its neck.  He's the one to not just kill but really enjoy the killing.  He's the monster that looks out through grey eyes.</p><p>The only thing Black has loyalty to is Harry.  Even so, that loyalty won't protect Harry if Black turns on him.  It's why padfoot keeps control when Sirius can't.  Neither will risk their pup alone with Black for long.</p><p>Only now... there is nothing left for Black to have loyalty to.</p><p>...................</p><p> </p><p>Sirius went numb, too shocked to maintain control.  Padfoot howled his grief and curled in the corner of his own mind.  This left Black as the one in control.</p><p>..................</p><p> </p><p>Black has no loyalty to these people screaming and sobbing their grief.  He watches coldly as a man screams for his lover and child, both were still inside the house when it exploded.  There's a child crying for his mother who is, no doubt, shredded beneath the shattered greenhouses.  </p><p>They mean nothing to him.</p><p>It's more curiosity than anything.  He wants to know how Harry died.  What could've killed someone so magically powerful?  </p><p>So he appariated, focusing on the tattered burnt ends of the blood bond they once shared.</p><p>The scent of blood, burnt copper, is so thick it almost chokes him.  Bodies lay torn and tossed around.  But this was not done with magic.  This was animal...</p><p>The truck they left in is half fallen into a deep ditch.  Harry's pup, Thorin, lay dead inside, an arrow through his eye.  The woman Maggie is curled over her boy in the ditch, half hidden beneath the truck.  Merle's leans wounded against the back of the truck with a gun in hand and Harry's pup, Evelyn, pressing against his leg.</p><p>A look further out shows the path of destruction going from the truck to half a mile down the road.  A few of the bodies on the ground are still clinging to life but they won't last long, their injuries too severe.  Blood is so thick on the road its left it like a liquid red mirror.</p><p>Harry's mate is curled on the road, clutching half of a torn and bloody body to his chest.  </p><p>The lower half is naked.  One of the legs is missing at the knee while the other is savaged at the hip.  It's clear that it took several strikes of a blade to separate the innards and spine because some of the innards are well away from where the body fell.</p><p>The upper half is riddled with slashes and missing chunks.  Bits of flesh hang away from the ribs and some ribs are missing along with the flesh that should be there.  The only part uncut is the face, peaceful in death even if he is blood-splattered.</p><p>.....................</p><p> </p><p>Sirius screams in horror at the sight.  His sanity reeling further away.  The image more terrible than anything azkaban ever showed him.</p><p>Padfoot howls and snarls, overwhelmed with rage and pain.  He claws at himself like a werewolf with nothing else to devour.  He doesn't even try to regain control.</p><p>Black watches coldly... displeased.</p><p>He doesn't like this.  Black wants control but Sirius and padfoot are making it difficult.  Their pain is bleeding over to him.  </p><p>...................</p><p>Black knows dark magic.  Curiosity had Sirius reading books in the family library that he really shouldn't have touched.  The knowledge sits in Blacks mind just waiting for a use.</p><p>..................</p><p> </p><p>There's a ritual.  Outlawed ages ago... truly dark black magic.  Something so horrible that even Bellatrix would hesitate.</p><p>Black is not inhibited by fear or morality or even sanity.</p><p>All it needs is a sacrifice or two.  Virgin sacrifice.  And there just so happens to be two young children nearby.</p><p>...................</p><p> </p><p>Merle always seemed to know when Black is in control.  He knew, and never trusted him.  So it doesnt surprise Black when he raises his gun at Blacks approach.  A green spell leaves Blacks wand.  Merle isn't a problem anymore.</p><p>..............</p><p> </p><p>The woman screams.  She actually screams.  How utterly stupid!  Another green spell silences her.</p><p>...............</p><p> </p><p>Daryl doesnt seem to notice or care.  The kids follow Black through the destruction.  Neither trust him but they don't know what else to do.</p><p>...............</p><p>Spells burn the runes deep into the road.  There's already enough blood and death to encourage his magic.  The kids get in position with minimal fuss.</p><p>.................</p><p>The runes burn with green fire.  The lifeless bodies of the children lay within the circle, fueling the magic.  A whirlwind of power fills the circle.</p><p>.................</p><p> </p><p>The ritual is complete...</p>
