  <i>parvati</i>
</p>
<p>Four years after the war, Parvati Patil is lonely.</p>
<p>The girl who was once bright and bubbly and always surrounded with others - or at least, one other - can now say she has no one left.</p>
<p>Career-wise, she’s just okay - a desire for financial independence has led her to working two to three odd service jobs, while trying to figure out her passion in life. Truthfully, she’s always thrived best with people around her, and would really have liked to channel her skills into a suitable career - but the war has left her thoroughly drained, burned out and unable to think for a very long time. Thus, she works at a wizarding fashion company in the day, waitresses during the night, and all the while is hunting for something more fulfilling to do.</p>
<p>Her parents hint unsubtly at marrying her off; considering she supposedly doesn’t know what to do with her life, it might ‘help [her] to gain stability and direction once [she settles] down’... She isn’t going to lie and say the idea of being a bored trophy wife never appealed to her, and so she does sometimes entertain the boys her parents suggest. But eventually, they all turn out to be frightfully boring; either that, or way too regressive for her to be able to live with. It’s a pity, because she does eventually want a happy family life, both because of cultural conditioning, and because she’s growing apart from all her old friends.</p>
<p>After Lavender somehow, miraculously, survives her attack, Parvati stays with her all through her convalescence, and tries her best to offer her sympathy, let her pour her heart out, and be there for her when she needs her. Lavender, for her part, still loves and appreciates Parvati, but is beginning to feel an intense disconnect from her - and indeed, from everyone in her past. It’s no surprise, when she can barely even recognise herself. Parvati should not begrudge her this, but sad to say, she does; she doesn’t understand that Lavender needs others around her now, and not just her. Still, she exercises restraint, and does nothing to show her hurt over this other than slowly removing herself from Lavender’s life unless first approached. They still see each other, of course, and still speak, but Parvati confides in her less and less, and speaks more and more of frivolities than anything she truly wants to tell her. Thank god she’s over that ridiculous crush she thought she had on her, back in sixth year when she was mooning over Weasley - that would have made it hurt even more.</p>
<p>As for her twin: Padma has never been as close to Parvati as people would expect twins to be, and despite looking identical, the two of them can always be told apart by how drastically differently they present themselves. Her sensible, practical sister has decided to teach children for a living, and at least temporarily, moved out of their parents’ house in London to a flat in Exeter, where she’s employed in a Muggle primary school. Coincidentally, Parvati’s old housemate and friend Neville Longbottom, too, is based in Exeter, assisting a herbologist to whom he’d been referred by Professor Sprout. Parvati, who’s always been a romantic at heart, feels like both of them should have a go at spending some time together, and at the very least, becoming friends, even if nothing more happens between them. Moreover, Exeter is not a very big town, and thus won’t have much of a magical population anyway - both of them probably need friends.</p>
<p>Padma, who’s never needed a social ecosystem around her the way Parvati has, initially laughs her off, but goes and meets Neville just to be nice. By the lukewarm feedback both of them give her after their first date, Parvati isn’t expecting anything to happen, probably not even a friendship; but a week later, Padma floos her to tell her she’s going out with Neville again. It’s really quite adorable, how her sister, who’s almost always barefaced, has her hair up in a bun and has a habit of throwing on the first clothes she finds in the wardrobe, is now fussing and fretting over colour combinations and hairstyling spells. (“it just makes me feel good, okay, Paru, literally nothing more than that - I’ll kill you if you tease me about it-”).</p>
<p>And even as Padma is saying her goodbyes and vanishing into the flames, Neville’s earnest face blinks out at her.</p>
<p>“I found this place where they serve really good chicken tikka masala, would she like it, do you think?”</p>
<p>On hearing this, Parvati laughs and informs Neville that if he took Padma to such a place, she would probably proceed to lecture him on how chicken tikka masala is actually a British creation, and how their Aaee makes far better chicken curry anyway. “Better just get her some Italian food or something.”</p>
<p>The news of Neville and Padma’s courtship makes Parvati unreasonably happy, and she puts more energy than is strictly necessary into helping them both take their relationship forward. Honestly, it’s not for entirely unselfish reasons she’s doing this - while she is happy for her sister and her friend, she also feels like this is the first time in a long while she’s had a purpose. If she can’t have her own romantic dreams fulfilled, at least she’s helping others achieve theirs, right?</p>
<p>And so, when they are three years into their relationship and are seriously considering getting married, Parvati helps to ease her parents into the revelation that they’re going to have a white son-in-law. Of course, it doesn't at all hurt that he’s war hero Neville Longbottom; in fact, that makes the decision much easier to swallow, along with the fact that he is a pure-blood. She stands by the couple at gatherings of their extended family, assists them when they begin planning the wedding and familiarises Neville with Maharashtrian pre-wedding and wedding customs. She’d honestly say that by now, after everything they’ve been through in and after school, she sees Neville almost as a brother figure. (And yes, that is still the case. That will always be the case for them, whatever happens in the following years.)</p>
<p>And then - it’s two weeks prior to the wedding, the wedding hall has been booked, the menu finalised and the families’ new outfits tailored. Parvati has slowly gravitated closer to Padma and Neville, and made both of them and their relationship a sort of emotional anchor for herself (and yes, it isn’t healthy, but it makes her feel good to do it, and she’s therefore not concerned about what is right and wrong and healthy and unhealthy).</p>
<p>The Gryffindors of Parvati’s class at Hogwarts have gathered at Neville’s old house, to have a little private celebration before wedding fever overtakes him. The alcohol is flowing, inside jokes are being exchanged, and everyone is in a fairly merry mood, looking forward to the impending wedding. Parvati is excessively loud and boisterous, too, chattering on and on about how all this was her idea and she needs to be given credit for it. She’s trying to keep talking, because whenever she falls quiet, her eyes wander to Lavender, and she feels her heart sink terribly.</p>
<p>Lavender seems to newly radiate an inner beauty and strength, and to have become quite contented in being self-reliant, and Parvati feels neither wanted nor needed by her. Neville, ever the emotional core of the Gryffindor bunch, sneaks concerned glances at her the entire evening, as she drinks more and more and speaks faster and faster, and when Seamus finally says goodnight and Apparates away, it’s just the two of them, alone in the large manor. (Augusta is lurking around one of the rooms upstairs, but she’s promised to leave Neville to his own devices today.) He sits her down, and while he is fairly drunk as well, he’s worried that she may have had enough to poison her.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” he asks, more to open the conversation than as a real question - it’s very obvious she isn’t. And thus begins a night that neither of them will want to remember, but will never be allowed to forget.</p>
<p>In later years, when anyone asks Parvati why she slept with her sister’s fiancé, she tells them she doesn’t know. It’s true. She doesn’t. It’s a decision that they made while incredibly drunk, when she had been clinging to Neville like a burr for hours and her tears had ruined his shirt. But if she really gave it thought, she’d probably say that she did it to feel close to someone. For years and years, she’d seen all her near and dear ones drift away from her and build their own lives, while hers continued to go nowhere and she remained unable to establish connections with anyone. Apart from her family, Neville was the only person from her past who remained in her life, and her attachment to him may have grown to an unhealthy level, enough to do something like this... (But, she still maintains, she never felt romantically for him, never has, and never will.)</p>
<p>Even as soon as she wakes up the next morning, she looks over at Neville sleeping next to her, and realises how massively she has fucked up. She shakes him awake in a panic, and asks him if he remembers anything - and he doesn’t, either. They have a hurried discussion, and decide to never speak of this day again. Both of them feel substantial guilt about not immediately coming clean to Padma, but make feeble excuses in their minds about how close the wedding is, and how it honestly means nothing because they do not have feelings for each other.</p>
<p>And Parvati does well with it, too - she goes back home, lies that everyone stayed over at Neville’s, and throws herself right back into wedding preparations. Before and during the ceremony, she plays the part of the enthusiastic, dutiful sister-in-law to a tee, and even Neville is almost fooled by how hard she is trying to act normal. He watches her as she applies turmeric paste to her sister’s face, as she adorns her hands with henna designs only a little less elaborate than the bride’s, as she hides his shoes and taunts him for not being able to find them, and he can almost, almost get the image of her lying in his bed a fortnight ago out of his mind.</p>
<p>Two months later, Parvati finds out she’s pregnant, and everything goes right to hell.</p>
<p>Considering she still lives with her parents, they are the first to find out, and naturally do not take it well at all. Their anger at her for having premarital sex, and having sex with Padma’s fiancé to boot, clashes with their stubborn pro-life stance and their belief that family should never abandon family in need. In the end, they tell her, “Look, if you need anything from us, we will support you, but we cannot let you raise this child in our house.” They do offer to let her stay till the end of her pregnancy, but she knows that things will get worse the longer she stays there.</p>
<p>And so, Parvati leaves home and temporarily moves in with her old housemate, Sally-Anne Perks. Even though the two weren’t very close back in the day, Sally-Anne lives in London too, and offers her a bed for a week while she sorts out what she wants to do. First in order: she needs to talk to Neville, and then to Padma. Neither of these two conversations go well. Neville tells her it is her choice whether she wants to keep the child or not, but she knows he would rather she doesn’t; Padma, meanwhile, absolutely ices her out, using some very choice words to describe her, and implying that all her effort towards getting her and Neville together was for her own selfish reasons. This is not an unreasonable assumption to make, even if it is completely untrue, and so Parvati stays quiet and allows her sister to throw whatever she’s got at her.</p>
<p>Now, Neville and Padma naturally begin to go through a rocky period in their relationship, and Padma even moves back to her parents’ for a good few months; but eventually, he explains his side of the story to her, and she’s obviously not placated, but she understands. The process of letting him in again comes very, very slowly, enough so that she doesn’t even let him touch her beyond quick hugs and kisses until a year after the revelation, and enough so that their first child isn’t born until three years after it. It helps that Neville is someone that Padma has seen grow up too, if not as closely as her sister, and thus she is willing to believe that this was a momentary lapse in judgment rather than an intrinsic part of his character.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Parvati runs. Ironic, perhaps, for a Gryffindor to run away instead of facing the demons she’s created; but she hardly has a choice. After spending a week at Sally-Anne’s (and profusely thanking her for it), she’s decided where she’s going to stay - a neighbourhood called Charnwood in Leicester, where a lot of Indians, mostly Muggles, are known to live. Hesitant to reveal the truth of her circumstances to anyone (especially to neighbours who, whether white or Indian, are bound to judge her harshly for them), she formulates a cover story involving being tragically widowed, and not being able to return to her parents’ house since they did not support her marriage. The women who stay in the apartment complex she’s found a flat in eat up this story, and feel incredibly sorry for her - every evening, one or more of them pops in with food, advice or useful information for her. She also has to find a proper way to earn money, now - she has a very meagre sum saved up, and will not be able to sustain herself with it for more than a year. If her ego didn’t get in the way of asking her parents for money, she would honestly have done it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the story of Parvati’s pregnancy never breaks; she makes sure to tell no one else, and Neville ensures that reporters never get wind of her location. Still, the fact that she’s disappeared entirely has led to a lot of wild speculation in the news, which she reads every day looking for mentions of herself, despite knowing that it’s not healthy. She hopes that things will quiet down soon, and people will forget about her, so she can continue existing inconspicuously like she is now.</p>
<p>(She’s dead wrong, of course; when she’s seen in public in 2007 with a two-year-old son, there’s another spate of tabloid gossip concerning who the father is, some of it dangerously close to the truth. At that time, she gives a short statement to the press requesting them to respect her privacy and not ask questions. Twenty-four years later, the truth comes out anyway, and a whole lot of demons she’s been keeping in the closet spring forth once again.)</p>
<p>She passes the nine months mostly in solitude, welcoming the overtures of friendship by her neighbours, but not being able to return them in kind, which they luckily do not take personally. More than anything, she’s begun to despise herself. To experience one moment of closeness, she’s ruined every connection she’s ever had with anyone, her reputation, and Neville’s reputation to boot. She deserves every name Padma has called her, and probably more, she thinks - which is why it surprises her when she shows up at her flat in the fifth month of her pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Padma says to her, not bothering with any sort of formal greeting, “I just want to know. Why?”</p>
<p>“Trust me, if I knew, I’d have told you.” Parvati looks worn and tired and defeated, and Padma almost wants to hug her, but holds off.</p>
<p>“Why him, Paru? You could have had anyone else. You have had others. Why my husband? Were you still trying to one-up me? We aren’t kids anymore, you know that.”</p>
<p>“Padma…” Parvati’s voice cracks into a whisper. “I know you won’t believe me, no matter what I tell you. I know. It’s just easier for you, and Neville, and everyone to believe that I was a…”</p>
<p>“A scheming harpy, yes,” Padma says, a trace of ice returning to her tone. “But I know you, Paru. You can’t lie. And I know you weren’t faking how happy you were when we got together. I just want to know… what changed, then?”</p>
<p>It takes an entire evening and a lot of tears for Parvati to dredge the truth of why she did it out of herself and manage to confess it to Padma, but eventually, it does come out - and while relations between the sisters are far from being amended, as the evening draws to a close, it’s evident that a (re-)connection has certainly been made.</p>
<p>“Do you want…” Padma says hesitantly, as she’s leaving the house. “Do you want Neville to be involved with your… baby?” She’s still struggling with saying the word, and Parvati cannot blame her at all. This type of infidelity is scandalous enough in itself, and on top of all that, there is soon going to be a permanent reminder of it.</p>
<p>“Does he want to?” Parvati asks.</p>
<p>“Of course he does, Paru, that’s not even a question. It’s his child too.”</p>
<p>“Do you want him to?”</p>
<p>Padma doesn’t answer this, but her knuckles turn white around the umbrella she is gripping.</p>
<p>“Padma?”</p>
<p>But her sister has already left the house.</p>
<p>Things only really start to look up for Parvati once her son is born. Despite the circumstances under which he was conceived and carried, looking at him gives Parvati an almost overwhelming sense of calmness. It feels like, now that she has him, she can brave anything in the world, just for him. It’s a sense of purpose that’s neither selfish nor impermanent, and she tells herself that she absolutely cannot fuck this up. She names him Aarav - ‘peaceful’ - and hopes that he lives up to his name, hopes that she can raise him to be happy and stable and yes, peaceful. As much as she would have loved to have someone else in her life to love, or a more conventional family, she realises that the situation she’s in is a result of her own stupid mistakes, and all she can do now is make the best of it.</p>

  <i>neville</i>
</p>
<p>Parvati is like a sister to him.</p>
<p>He repeats this so often in the months following the scandal that it starts to sound hollow to him - but it’s true. When he goes to see her in Leicester, his first instinct on seeing her looking so hopelessly broken is to find whoever did this to her and beat them up, until he remembers that he’s the one who did it. Even so, he’s the first person to get back in regular contact with her, because he considers it his responsibility, and he’s there when his son is born. His son - it sounds so weird. The way he and Padma (and even Parvati, to an extent) have dealt with the situation is to pretend that the incidents of Parvati sleeping with him and getting knocked up are unconnected, and the baby is somebody else’s. He tells himself he’s only doing what’s right by his sister-in-law, who doesn’t have any other support in the world. But when Aarav is born, he can’t pretend anymore - he can see himself clearly in the baby’s face.</p>
<p>“So… am I going to be his dad?” he asks Parvati, and she shakes her head.</p>
<p>“You know that’s not possible.” It would not be easy to explain to him, or to any future children of Neville’s.</p>
<p>Thus, Neville becomes Aarav’s Nice Uncle, who shows up every week, and once he learns to talk, asks him endless questions about how he is, what he did today, what he likes and dislikes. It’s a shaky and tentative arrangement, especially because he doesn’t know what he’ll tell Aarav when he asks about where his dad is - but he’s glad he can stay in his son’s life.</p>
<p>The arrival of the baby also seems to bring back a spark in Parvati that she’s lacked for quite a while. She stops wearing the drab white robes she had previously donned almost every day (both because she couldn’t be bothered to wear anything else, and because she was supposed to look like a grieving widow), and slowly starts to reciprocate the kindnesses her neighbours have so lavished her with. She babysits for this family, sends food over to that, hosts the birthday party of one child and resolves the arguments of another two. As she carves out a life for herself and her child in this Muggle town, she’s putting the few talents she has to use, too.</p>
<p>While Neville helps her out financially, she still needs a steady source of income, and one that she can work to make while not sacrificing time with her child.</p>
<p>“You’re good with people,” he tells her one day, having dropped in on her rocking Aadya, a neighbour’s baby, in her arms, while eight-month-old Aarav lies in his bed, sound asleep. “You should do something with those skills.”</p>
<p>“I wish,” she says, not without a little bitterness in her voice. “If I leave Aarav with anyone else, there could be… problems.” She doesn’t need to say what problems - it’s been a good year she’s lived in this neighborhood, and she hasn’t yet come across a single other magical family.</p>
<p>“I could…” Neville begins, but stops himself. Padma has recently fallen pregnant for the first time, and there is still a sense of unease between them - even now, while she recognises his need to visit Parvati so often, she isn’t particularly happy about it. Bringing Aarav over to the house in such a situation would smash the fragile peace they have been building for the better part of two years, he knows.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t.” Parvati sighs heavily and moves Aadya to her other leg. “Are you staying for dinner?”</p>
<p>“This is really good, Parvati,” Neville says a while later, dipping a hunk of bread into the steaming bowl of mushroom soup she’s set down in front of him. “Never knew you could cook.”</p>
<p>“I was cooped up in here for a long time, you know,” she says in response. “I had to do something to pass my time, or I’d go mad.” Her eyes go bright with some unspoken revelation, and when she speaks again, she sounds far lighter.</p>
<p>“What about you? Having fun digging up Mandrakes and Tentaculas?”</p>
<p>Neville is about to say yes, but stops himself. Is he having fun? He’s not sure, really. He’s certainly always had an aptitude for Herbology, but for the past five or six years, it’s all he’s been doing, day in and day out. Professor Sprout has implored him to consider taking over her post at Hogwarts, but truthfully, he’d rather not go back there - he loves teaching and leading people, certainly, but still doesn’t think he’s ready to go back. For that matter, teaching at Hogwarts would also mean he’d have to spend the better part of the year away from Padma and his children - and Parvati and Aarav, as well.</p>
<p>“You know, I was thinking,” Padma says to him a few nights later as they’re curled up in bed, “Muggle-borns' parents must have such a hard time of it. Imagine your child randomly receiving a letter with a very specific address on their eleventh birthday, from an institution that doesn’t even sound legitimate, telling them that they’ve been admitted there. Then they tell you to go to a place that you’re not even sure exists and buy things that no sane person would send with their child to a school. And you’re not even allowed to visit this school - you just have to send them off on a train, and hope they write you letters.”</p>
<p>Neville considers this for a moment. Both he and Padma are pure-bloods, and thus have anticipated the letter and known of magical spaces from a young age - so he can’t imagine suddenly being thrust into an entirely new world like this. Perhaps he should talk to an actual Muggle-born. Harry isn’t one, but he could count, considering the way his Muggle relatives withheld everything about his magic from him… but Harry was The Boy Who Lived, and so his experience on entering the Wizarding World might be rather different from just a regular Muggle-born wizard. There’s got to be someone else he can speak to - but whom?</p>
<p>“Y’know, I’m not technically a Muggle-born, right?” Dean says with an amused smirk, sitting across from Neville and Padma on their sofa the next evening.</p>
<p>“You’re not?” Neville isn’t sure whether he’s missed this piece of news, or was never privy to it in the first place.</p>
<p>Dean shakes his head. “No, I found out after the war that my biological dad was a wizard. No one knew. Even mum wasn’t certain, really, even after I got my letter.” He continues, with a hint of bitterness in his voice, “Not that that fact was any help to me when I was being hunted down.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Neville says, seeing out of the corner of his eye that Padma has conjured up a notepad and pencil (thank Merlin for her - he’d forgotten entirely that they are supposed to be recording these conversations), “could you tell me more about what your first brush with the Wizarding World was like?”</p>
<p>After Dean comes Hermione, then Justin Finch-Fletchley, then Dennis Creevey, then other Muggle-borns from school that Neville is able to track down. By and large, all of them say essentially the same thing - while they love being part of the wizarding world, it is a massive shock and change to be subjected to in a matter of a few months, not just for the child but for their parents too.</p>
<p>“I was right,” Padma says, grinning at Neville when they’re done with the last of the interviews. Despite being close to the end of her second trimester, she seems to be brimming with endless energy, just as she always is when she’s charging full steam ahead with one of her ideas.</p>
<p>“What’s your idea, then?” Neville asks.</p>
<p>That night, neither of them sleep much, as they chart out their two-part plan to help Muggle-born magical kids have a smoother integration into the Wizarding world (and give pure-blood and half-blood children a chance to have a more well-rounded education, if they so choose). One part of it would be to set up a primary school for magical children of any blood status; while parents will still be welcome to send their children to Muggle primary school or even homeschool them, they feel like it will ease their transition into the curriculum at Hogwarts as well.</p>
<p>Another gripe Padma has always had with the Hogwarts system is that it does not teach the students any sort of non-magical skills that might assist them in their later life. In third year, she’d signed up for Arithmancy with great enthusiasm, hoping that she would finally get to learn some more mathematics than she had in Muggle primary school. To her shock, it involved less mathematics and more of numerology and ancient spells and curses; while she did enjoy studying the subject, and scored suitably high marks, the fact remained that she came away from this experience quite disillusioned with Hogwarts, at least in this regard. Thus, they decide, their school will teach the children basic English, mathematics and practical skills, while also giving them an introduction to magic, an overview of what they can and should use it for, and precautions on how to use it safely.</p>
<p>The second part of their plan involves sending an adult wizard to visit the parents of Muggle-born children a lot sooner than their eleventh birthday. While Neville and all his friends are very fond of Hagrid, bless his old heart, he has never been the most socially competent person around, and to top that, even the nicest people are bound to be terrified by a ten-foot-tall man blustering into their house and bluntly telling them that their child is a wizard. Therefore, they decide that a group of socially skilled wizards and witches known as the ‘liaison staff’ will visit Muggle-born magical children’s homes when they are around six or seven (for that’s the age when most children first show signs of magic, Neville’s own disastrous experiences notwithstanding), and help the child and their parents to ease into the reality of their abilities by remaining in correspondence with them. Again, an offer will be extended to them to send the child to the wizarding primary school, but if they’re not inclined to doing so, they won’t be forced to.</p>
<p>While the massive amounts of Ministry permissions, regulations and paperwork that they’ll have to contend with intimidates Neville greatly, Padma dives right in, and soon, Hermione is helping them when she can, too. It is through her efforts that they manage to obtain a copy of the register of magical children born in Britain, and narrow it down so it does not show the children who have at least one magical parent. As news of their endeavour goes around, more and more of their old friends express interest in it, and they soon have a good number of people who are either fully or partially committed to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Nearly three years later, the Minerva McGonagall Pre-Primary Academy for Magical Children is inaugurated to much fanfare. The woman herself, greatly touched that her former students would choose to name the institution after her, is the guest of honour at the inauguration, and has been one of the most fervent supporters of this idea since its inception. Her old friend Augusta Longbottom, no less integral to the idea but far more reclusive than Minerva, sits next to her, and the two of them trade wry remarks throughout the ceremony. On stage, Neville and Padma positively glow as they speak about their vision and how they made it a reality, and everyone can see how truly passionate they are about this cause.</p>

  <i>parvati (again)</i>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no one really sees Parvati - but she’s fine with that. She sits at the end of the front row, with a now four-year-old Aarav next to her (but constantly running away and bumping into other children), and her sister’s first child, Shivanya, in her lap. She’s been taking care of Vaani whenever Padma needs her to, and somehow, the presence of the two children has made things easier between the sisters - not least because she spends a lot more time at their place now.</p>
<p>She has previously offered logistic support and favours to those working for the school, but always felt a little too intimidated to throw her hat into the ring and commit to it herself; meanwhile, she’s been running a small tiffin service out of her house, which has become reasonably popular, but is neither lucrative nor fulfilling enough for her to want to make it a lifetime career. She honestly still hasn’t found anything that she truly feels she wants to do - at least, not until now. After the function ends and she’s hugged and congratulated Neville and Padma a million times, she finally works up the courage to ask the question she’s wanted to all evening.</p>
<p>“So… can I be part of the liaison staff as well?”</p>
<p>It’s been a harrowing few years, but at least for now, she thinks things are going to be okay.</p></div>
