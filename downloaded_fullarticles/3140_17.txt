    <p>Ellie stared listlessly into space. She knew she should be listening to Mr Brown, but she just couldn’t face hearing another word about quadratic equations. She didn’t need to – Lucy was listening as always and would be able to help her with (or do) her homework. Lucy was very good at that: she always put a believable number of mistakes in it and could mimic Ellie’s handwriting perfectly.</p>
<p>Over the aisle, Ellie’s other friend, Jack, was struggling to pay attention. Lucy always refused to do his homework on the grounds that he was too lazy and needed to work for himself.</p>
<p>Ellie flashed him a sympathetic smile and began absently doodling in her notebook. Her gaze drifted up to the clock. It was four minutes to eleven. Only four more minutes of this. </p>
<p>Mr Brown seemed to have asked a question, because a few hands were shooting up. Mr Brown pointed to Sarah, the class know-it-all.</p>
<p>“Because anything multiplied by zero equals zero,” Sarah said in a rush.</p>
<p>“Exactly!” said Mr Brown. “Well done! That means that all that is required to solve the equation is some simple algebra.” Ellie didn’t see how it was at all useful. “So, can anyone tell me the solution to the equation?”</p>
<p>This time he picked Lucy, who said, “Negative two and negative five.”</p>
<p>Mr Brown nodded. “You will note that the equation has two solutions. If you’re finding that hard to visualise, picture the graph…”</p>
<p>Ellie gave up trying to understand it and tuned out once more. She began moving her left foot from side to side: she’d been sitting still for nearly an hour now and was getting stiff.</p>
<p>The clock kept ticking loudly, the only sound in the room except the dull drone of Mr Brown’s voice. “Unfortunately,” he was saying, “not all quadratics can be factorised.” Ellie could barely stop herself from groaning. She hadn’t even learnt this method yet! </p>
<p>“Some do not have real solutions.” That remark puzzled Ellie; what was a solution if it wasn’t real? Was there such a thing as an unreal solution?</p>
<p>“We will discuss other methods in the next lesson. For homework, please solve, with workings clearly shown, the quadratic equations on page 36 of your textbooks. You may go.”</p>
<p>Ellie stood up and pushed back her chair, slinging her bag over her shoulder as she did so. Then, taking a deep breath, she joined the mass of students heading for the exit.</p>
<p>They all hurried down the corridor and out into the playground, where most of them split into little groups and began chatting.</p>
<p> Ellie dashed for the little corner by the old yew tree where she always went. Lucy and Jack arrived a moment later. All three of them droped their bags on the ground.</p>
<p>Lucy pulled something out of her bag. “Your chemistry project”, she said, handing it to Ellie. “You might want to read through it before you hand it in – you know what Miss Knight’s like.”</p>
<p>Ellie took it and put it straight in her bag. She pulled out something else: a book with a blue-and-black cover. “Where did we get to?” she asked out of politeness, even though she knew exactly where they were.</p>
<p>She passed the book to Jack, who was the only one of the trio who didn’t know its contents inside out.</p>
<p>“The scene where Beren and Lúthien confront Morgoth and steal the Silmaril.” Lucy said. Ellie and Lucy each produced a fake jewel from their pockets. Ellie’s had come from a Christmas cracker. </p>
<p>Jack reached into his bag and grabbed a paper cut-out crown, with a third jewel attached to it.</p>
<p>Ellie and Lucy passed theirs to Jack, who glued them on and put on the crown. It didn’t quite fall off his head, so he sat down, opened the book to page two hundred and twelve, and read: “Then Beren and Lúthien went through the gate, and down the labyrinthine stairs; and together wrought the greatest deed that has been dared by Elves or Men.”</p>
<p>Ellie and Lucy, following the text, turned and walked away, then came back, hand in hand, and waited. “For they came to the seat of Morgoth… blah blah blah…” </p>
<p>The girls walked forward a little and Lucy said angrily “Hey! You shouldn’t just omit text like that!” </p>
<p>Jack ignored her and continued “There Beren slunk in wolf’s form beneath his throne.” Lucy shook her head at the idea of slinking under Jack’s backpack and instead lay on the ground behind it.</p>
<p>“But Lúthien was stripped of her disguise by the will of Morgoth.”</p>
<p>Ellie didn’t feel like waiting, and she knew what was coming, so she stepped forward and said “HI. I’m Lúthien. Do you want me to sing for you?” </p>
<p>Lucy instantly began berating her. “Too informal, too rushed, too stupid!”	</p>
<p>Jack, slightly bemused, nodded.</p>
<p>Ellie suddenly realised she had yet to think of a “song of surpassing loveliness” so she darted behind the elm tree and began singing the first song she thought of: “A whole new world…” she began.</p>
<p>Jack burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Ellie continued, “A new fantastic point of view…” Jack was bent double on his seat, and his crown had fallen off. </p>
<p>“Slightly unconventional,” said Ellie, smiling, “but it worked!” She handed the crown to Lucy, who ripped away one of the Silmarils and ran.</p>
<p>Jack suddenly stood up and said loudly in his best evil voice (which wasn’t very good) “How dare you steal one of the Silmarils of Morgoth!”</p>
<p>Ellie corrected “Melkor. That’s what he calls himself.”</p>
<p>Jack charged after Lucy. Ellie stood watching as Lucy and Jack began arguing viciously. </p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a voice behind her. “Would you mind telling me why they are talking about Silmarils and mentioning my name?”</p>
<p>Ellie felt a cold shiver running up her spine. It was hard to pin down the exact cause: something in the tone, perhaps, that filled her with fear and yet she admired. She turned around slowly too see a tall man, dressed all in black, behind her, leaning casually against the tree. </p>
<p>A conclusion leapt into her mind, made by his appearance and his voice and what he’d said. It was an impossible conclusion. </p>
<p>But nonetheless, she said quietly, “You’re Morgoth.”</p>
