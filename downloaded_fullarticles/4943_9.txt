    <p> </p><p align="left">Harry sat alone on the train, hearing nothing. He doesn’t know what his own voice sounds like, what other people sound like, nothing.</p><p>So, he doesn’t notice the Irish boy opening the door. He notices him sitting in the seat across from his. He notices that he signs.</p><p>“<em>Hello. I’m Seamus McFinnigan. I’m mute.”</em></p><p>Harry stares at Seamus’s hands for a minute, before signing back “<em>Hi. I’m Harry Potter. I’m deaf. I have been for as long as I can remember.</em>”</p><p>The boys shake hands, and begin their silent conversation.</p><p>The door opens again, to reveal a dark-skinned boy.</p><p>“Hi. I’m Dean Thomas. Nice to meet you two.” He says, smiling.</p><p>Harry cocks his head in confusion, and Seamus translates for him. Harry forms a fist with his right hand, and, bending at the wrist, moves it up and down. He then climbs up and digs through his trunk, producing a notepad and a muggle pen.</p><p>He scribbles something down, before showing the page to Dean.</p><p>“<em>Hello. My name is Harry Potter. I can’t hear.”</em></p><p>Harry gives it to Seamus, who writes something down.</p><p>“<em>I’m Seamus McFinnigan. I can’t speak.”</em></p><p>Dean nods and gently takes the notepad from Seamus, and writes something down, before showing the page to Harry.</p><p>“<em>Hi. What colour are your eyes? See, I can’t see Red, yellow or green. I’m colour-blind”</em></p><p>Harry nods, before taking the notepad, and writing a message down.</p><p>“<em>Do you want us to teach you sign language? Both of us can’t talk, and one of us can’t hear. It makes talking easier”<br/>
</em>Dean nods, eager to lean.</p><p>They have a few hours on the train, after all.</p><p> </p>
