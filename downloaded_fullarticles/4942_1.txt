  <p>Three days after my thirtieth birthday, I was house-sitting for my friend and fellow animator, Larry Kirkland, with Nathaniel and Micah. The April morning was cool and I so wanted to cuddle safe in-between my two sweeties until late afternoon instead of getting up for work. Honestly, as deeply tangled as I was under the blankets and in the limbs of their warm bodies, we would likely take at least that long to pull ourselves out of bed. Nathaniel, who was curling tighter against my body and sighing in contentment, reinforced this notion within me. I was growing to love that sound and the feel of him breathing lightly on me in pleasure.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Good morning,” he purred into my ear.</p>
  <p>I smiled as I snuggled in against him tighter. “Yes, it is.”</p>
  <p>Normally, I was not one for endorsing the idea of playing hooky. However, the company and the feeling of being inside a house again rather than under the Circus for a change were making the temptation near impossible. When Micah rolled over to curl around both Nathaniel and me possessively, the idea more than tempted me. We had worked hard in the last few weeks. In fact, it had been months since we had woken up together instead of one of us leaving and another crawling into bed. Micah opened those chartreuse kitty-cat eyes to me and smiled so much like his feline beast. Warm, moist lips brushed against mine until we gave in into an intimate and relishing kiss that gave our beasts a chance to say their good mornings to one another too. Then Micah focused on our Nathaniel with a deep smile before claiming our love’s lips just as deep and possessive. Yes, we all needed a break from life, if only for the day.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, fate had other plans for us that morning.</p>
  <p>Downstairs, the doorbell rang to break our silent reverie. Micah broke his and Nathaniel’s kiss to grumble with a voice thick from sleep. “Just when I was going to call in sick today.”</p>
  <p>I laughed, since the same thought had crossed my mind many, many times since I finally gave in to the sun and woke up. “You are beginning to read me too well, my Nimir-Raj.”</p>
  <p>“My job, my Nimir-Ra.”</p>
  <p>Cheerful from our old morning ritual returning and ever our chipper morning person, Nathaniel called out. “We’ll be down in a minute.”</p>
  <p>We slid into comfortable though presentable house clothes before Nathaniel beat me out of the door and down the stairs for the front door. I looked over at Micah and sighed. “How did we manage to fall in love with such a morning person?”</p>
  <p>He chuckled at me. “Simple. We needed him to wake us up and make sure we are ready for the morning.”</p>
  <p>Leaving the bedclothes for later straightening or use, Micah pulled me off the bed and walked with me down the stairs. As long as we took to pull out of bed, I expected the visitor had already left in spite of Nathaniel’s swiftness. I know that I would have walked away personally. No need to break the warm feelings of the morning by acting terse with my guys. But, surprisingly, Nathaniel had made it to the door in time.</p>
  <p>Outside stood an elderly man and woman dressed in some sort of medieval clothing and wearing pointed hats — though the woman’s was more like a witch’s hat that was crooked at the tip. The woman wore a look of surprise, meaning they were not here to see Nathaniel. However, I knew I had never met either of them. Glancing at Micah, I saw no recognition in his face.</p>
  <p>Nathaniel was still talking; making excuses for the amount of time I took getting ready and turned around with a somewhat relieved expression. “There she is!”</p>
  <p>I wondered if the pair were in some way connected to the vampire council, but dismissed that thought. They did not feel connected to vampires, though they were not human either. No sort of lycanthropy I had ever met before and not zombies. Yet, there was some sort of feeling in me that screamed these two were not completely normal.</p>
  <p>Rather than screaming at them for interrupting our beautiful morning, as I first wanted, I counted to ten and walked over to my younger sweetie and the door. As calmly as I could manage, I grumbled, “Hello, how can we help you?”</p>
  <p>“Are you Anita Blake?” the woman asked me while she glanced suspiciously back and forth between Micah and Nathaniel.</p>
  <p>“Yes, but I have to tell you right away that if you are looking for me as an animator …” I began, however, the gentleman interrupted me.</p>
  <p>“No, no, my dear. Actually, we would not have remained had my associate not insisted we speak with you face-to-face.”</p>
  <p>Said colleague glared. “After what happened the last time…”</p>
  <p>“There is no reason to get into such just now,” chided the man.</p>
  <p>Now I started to wonder if they were members of some new cult or selling something. This situation felt too weird for my tastes after dealing with the ultimate vampire boogeyman not long before. I knew I should have brought my gun downstairs with me. I needed my coffee before my brain would function. “Ring the bell and run?”</p>
  <p>Then I saw what Nathaniel was staring at while we talked. In the woman’s arms was an adorable little green-eyed baby who looked far too thin for his height. Given how I missed this silent third person I was still way too tired. I really, really needed my coffee.</p>
  <p>Nathaniel, who had learned to read me better than anyone, cut in before I could decide what to do with our unexpected guests.</p>
  <p>“Maybe you want to come in, so we can talk in warmer air and drink some coffee?”</p>
  <p>I so didn´t want these people inside with me, but the sooner I got coffee, the sooner I would be able to handle them properly.</p>
  <p>The two adults agreed while Nathaniel opened the door wider and the trio came in. To my surprise, the baby immediately reached out for me. He wore a smile that so reminded me of Micah and Nathaniel – happy and eager to see me smile at the same time. That had to be my imagination.This kid would need an entire coalition to knock back the girls or guys (either way it was not my business) when he got older. For now, he could win a most-adorable-baby-contest without a sweat. Still this kid’s eyes also held an expression that seemed so sad and needy. He wanted something from me, but didn’t seem to think he would get whatever he wanted so bad. How could I read an unknown child so easily?</p>
  <p>I picked the baby out of the woman’s arms, not knowing why, but I just had to touch him. The boy answered rather than crying at this assuming stranger instead clasped himself tight to me, so far as to clinch my hair in his hands. For some reason, the kid did not want to let go of me. Okay, this was new to me and I was not sure how to handle it. A whiff of him brought to my mind an image of my Dad. The kid smelt of home and life before I lost my Mom. I had missed the feeling and my body instinctively hugged that boy tight for a moment to show gratitude for giving my poor heart a break.</p>
  <p>Smiles were openly shared all around to the point that I rolled my eyes to the lot of them. What I smelt was no one else’s business, though I would later tell Micah and Nathaniel. “He isn’t shy I see.”</p>
  <p>“Actually, the boy was not ready to trust any other that we have seen thus far,” the elderly woman explained.</p>
  <p>I looked down at the content child. I had no idea what to think about him or what outsiders should would think of him. I hadn’t been around babies since Josh was this age, and even then my step-mother, Judith, made sure I was not allowed near her precious and perfect little boy.</p>
  <p>The baby boy couldn’t be two yet, but maybe close to it. I tried using my powers. He felt special, but not in the way I was used to. Even more than this, he felt as if he was a part of me.</p>
  <p>We all sat in the living room while Nathaniel made coffee. Silently, we waited for him while the baby in my arms – or could the word toddler fit the kid now? – cooed and snuggled against me. Once we all had a cup, Nathaniel timidly asked if he could hold the child. That was fine with me because I loved Nathaniel and knew that he desperately wanted a baby. I tried talking him into getting a puppy, but our moving under the Circus left me out-voted on that. Beside the kid seemed to really like my sweetie. Moreover, this immediate connection with child had started to give me the creeps.</p>
  <p>Taking a breath to try and calm myself down, I began, “Could we start with introductions first?”</p>
  <p>“Oh yes, I am Professor Minerva McGonagall and this is our school´s Headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.”</p>
  <p>“Um, what school,” I asked, slightly harsher than normal. More coffee needed.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, Nathaniel had made a whole pot and brought it with the cups. I took up my cup off the table and smirked before giving my younger sweetie a look. He had remembered to pack my favorite baby penguin mug to come with us for the weekend. He smiled at me before returning his attentions to the little boy.</p>
  <p>“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” The elderly man provided nothing else.</p>
  <p>Micah came over and stood behind me. “Why have we never heard of this school and where is it? Obviously in Britain from your shared accents.”</p>
  <p>“Yes, the school is in Scotland. As to why you have not heard of Hogwarts, our world is kept separate from your world by laws designed to protect our people from those who long ago would have hunted us to death,” McGonagall explained.</p>
  <p>We all three looked at one another before I shook my head. “You should keep an eye out on our world closer. Magic is a commonplace item now. I am an animator, which takes magic and I know many with various levels of magic ability.”</p>
  <p>“Our current Minister for Magic would choose to observe caution rather than risk our world.” Dumbledore said. “Though it might be wise to open an investigation into such in time.”</p>
  <p>“Say when you get a new Minister?” I added. All I received in response was twinkling eyes. I wondered if we were being railroaded into something with pretty make believe. Looking up at Micah, he gave me a shake of his head. I smiled at how he read me so well. Without speaking, he knew I wanted to know if he smelt a lie and received his response the same. Neither of us could detect any untruth within the couple's words.</p>
  <p>I nodded a few beats later. “Okay, given you are not directly lying, let’s keep going. I guess you know me. These are two of my boyfriends, Micah Callahan and holding the baby is Nathaniel Graison.”</p>
  <p>“Two of? What do you mean by that?” McGonagall asked sternly as she looked.</p>
  <p>“I am currently dating seven men, two ladies (Envy and Jade both still thought of me as only their Mistress, but I saw both women as so much more than that)<em>,</em> have one who is an uncertainty, and hold several others on the side,” I snarled. “A mix of metaphysical situations brought us together and we now do the best we can or even love one another deeply depending on who you ask about.”</p>
  <p>The woman turned to Dumbledore and complained, “Albus, there has to be another way!”</p>
  <p>The Headmaster on the other hand had a twinkle in his eyes then he looked at the baby and Nathaniel. The expression the old man wore I had seen far too many times in Jean-Claude’s eyes. In strangers, I did not trust that look. Then the elderly gentleman came to himself again in a similar way to Jean-Claude when I caught my vamp. Dumbledore ignored his companion’s protest to speak to Nathaniel. “The young man you are holding is Harry Potter.”</p>
  <p>The man was incorrect, as the boy was actually holding my sweetie. However, as the kid smiled up at me before he cooed and giggled from Nathaniel’s tickles, I wouldn’t split hairs. Instead, I thought hard. Potter was not a name I knew in St. Louis. So what reason had these two coming to me with this sweet little boy? Moreover, why did there have to be ‘another way’ since she disliked my introductions of my sweeties? We still had not come to the reason for their visit. “May I ask what brought you to our friend’s door if you are looking for me?”</p>
  <p>Another thing occurred to me. “How could you have possibly known we were house sitting for the Kirklands this weekend?”</p>
  <p>Dumbledore sighed. “Magic, Ms. Blake, is how we found you and your at hand boyfriends. As to the mission that brought Minerva and I in search of you, such is the difficult, not to mention sad, part of our journey. You see, Ms. Blake, we only learned about you – and what you mean to young Harry – two days ago. Harry’s mother was born Lily Evans before she married James Potter only three years ago.”</p>
  <p>I had to interrupt, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know anyone by the family names Evans or Potter. How would I fit in this?”</p>
  <p>Dumbledore nodded. “I had suspected such. Your father likely has kept that incident a secret known only to him and Mrs. Rose Evans.”</p>
  <p>Now I was really losing my temper. “What would you know of my father?”</p>
  <p>“We are wizards, Ms. Blake,” McGonagall explained, as if that would make everything clear, which it didn’t. However, I waited and she eventually continued. “Due to the abuse we learned Harry has suffered at the hands of Lily’s other biological sister …”</p>
  <p>Here I blew up even with Micah rubbing my neck. Harry whimpered and I forced my girls to calm down. We all hated that any child was abused … but that I could be lied to could in some ways feel worse. Drawing my powers back in and Nathaniel soft rocking combined to calm Harry again. Then I forced myself to speak with a degree of calm in my voice. “Can we get to what I think is exactly what my mind sees you are insinuating?”</p>
  <p>Tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. “Very like Lily. Of course, though you will not believe nor be quick to accept what we must tell you, Ms. Blake.”</p>
  <p>“Try me,” I growled while Nathaniel pulled Harry closer to his chest. My sweetie rested his head on my shoulder as Harry grabbed my arm as if for dear life. The poor little guy didn’t want me to get mad again. Yes, the kid was abused recently and scared of any anger. Honestly, the feel of his weight against me combined with Nathaniel and Micah touching me calmed me just as much as Damien’s touch.</p>
  <p>“We had to trace Lily Evans-Potter’s line for any blood family with whom we could leave Harry, as his last guardians threw the boy in a cupboard under their stairs with nothing at all.” McGonagall explained. </p>
  <p>Micah growled and his beast roared with a powerful rage that even scared me a little, not to mention poor Harry. “They did what?”</p>
  <p>“How could anyone hurt this sweet kid?” Nathaniel asked. “Harry is too adorable and precious for that.”</p>
  <p>I felt the ache in his voice. Nathaniel too had survived an abusive home. I knew without asking that he would not give the baby up unless I ordered him to do so and even then, it would likely destroy all we had between us. However, the expression of loneliness and powerlessness in those lavender eyes nearly shattered my heart. Harry already had my leopard wrapped around his baby fingers.</p>
  <p>How could I explain that it was impossible for us to raise a baby with our lives? Especially given we were living with a vampire kiss that was a favorite target of all sorts of metaphysical crap. That was not a place to raise a baby. Jean-Claude himself agreed with me on that back when I had my near-miss baby scare.</p>
  <p>Harry whimpered and McGonagall looked horrified as the power in the room raised once again with our anger and grief for a child none of us knew. “What is going on here?”</p>
  <p>“Boys, we need to calm down for Harry,” I said firmly. While calming and recalling powers took a few minutes, we managed to get back to a normal level.</p>
  <p>Nathaniel kissed the top of Harry’s head. “It’s okay Harry. We would never hurt you.”</p>
  <p>“I repeat,” McGonagall growled at us. “What is going on here?”</p>
  <p>“The anger we felt at the news caused the three of us to lose a measure of control. It doesn’t happen often and there is no danger to either of you, Professors.” Seeing from the older woman’s eyes that my answer was not satisfactory, I went on. “The two of you really have no idea about who and what I am, do you?”</p>
  <p>“We only know of your link to Harry,” Dumbledore answered softly.</p>
  <p>Honestly, I had no idea how to take that. Never in all the years I had openly been Jean-Claude’s human servant had I met anyone who did not recognize me. The feeling was not refreshing, but scary and deeply troubling it was. “I am not a human. Such I have not been in many years. I am a necromancer and animator.”</p>
  <p>McGonagall looked as appalled as one could expect. Clearly neither of them knew me. And I had yet to come to the good part. There seemed a chance that I would not need to argue about the danger our lives would place Harry in. So, why did that anger me and hurt?</p>
  <p>Letting go a breath Micah spoke next what we all knew would damn our keeping Harry. “I am a wereleopard and the Nimir-Raj or King of mine and Anita’s pards.”</p>
  <p>“And I’m a wereleopard too, but just an ordinary one.” Nathaniel explained.</p>
  <p>Too much information, but we couldn’t take the words back. McGonagall looked pale as death warmed over as she turned to her companion. “Albus, we cannot do this!”</p>
  <p>“The only other option remaining is Mr. Blake, who has given us his answer soundly, if we do not want to return Harry to the Dursleys, Minerva. Which would you prefer?” Dumbledore explained gently. Then he turned back to us. “We are taking legal actions against Harry’s former caregivers, Mr. Callahan and Mr. Graison. However, as I have just stated, young Harry has only three family members alive and you, Ms. Blake, are the last chance before Harry returns to where we took him from.”</p>
  <p>I could hear Micah taking deep breaths before he spoke with less of his beast shining through than I would have thought, given as close to the surface I felt my girl’s mate. “Harry doesn’t have any other relatives then?”</p>
  <p>Dumbledore shook his head. “Among the living, there are only Petunia and Ms. Blake’s family remaining in total and it is only Lily’s side that we are able to focus on in any case. We originally thought Lily only had her elder sister, Petunia Dursley, and left Harry at their stoop the night after his parents were lost.”</p>
  <p>“You mean Harry’s parents are dead?” I asked.</p>
  <p>A nod and Dumbledore went on, “I had hoped the Dursleys would take care of Harry like a second son. Sadly, such was not the case.”</p>
  <p>“When you say left him, do you mean outside? Did you at least ring the doorbell?” Nathaniel asked, glaring at the pair opposite us.</p>
  <p>To my surprise, McGonagall glared at Dumbledore, “No, he did not. That is why I came with him this time – to be certain he didn’t simply leave Harry with a letter again.”</p>
  <p>My eyes widened and I scrambled to calm my sweeties when Harry whimpered again. “Guys, the two of you calm down and think about not scaring Harry, please.”</p>
  <p>Micah began to pace behind me while Nathaniel focused all his attentions onto Harry. God, what was I getting us into now? Since Harry had Nathaniel, I went to Micah and pulled him into my arms. I knew he was thinking about the problems in our lives and all the troubles we were forced into without warning. Even so, neither of us wanted the sweet little boy to go back into an abusive house.</p>
  <p>For the world, I couldn’t imagine what my connection to the child’s mother was. And why would that be so damn important?</p>
  <p>Once I had Micah calmer, I looked at Dumbledore, “Look, my father has never talked about a Rose Evans. How could I be related to this Lily person?”</p>
  <p>“Using magic, we were able to trace Lily’s full lines. This has produced the surprising and previously unknown development that Lily was not by blood a member of the Evans family. In short, she and Petunia only shared the same mother,” Dumbledore explained. After a few beats, he went on. “Mrs. Evans had had an indiscretion against her husband while visiting the United States just before Lily was born.”</p>
  <p>No, I did not like the implications so far. Dad couldn’t have done the sin I think they were dancing around. This just couldn’t be happening. I could feel the start of a headache building behind my eyes.</p>
  <p>Even if my Dad had slept with another man’s wife, depending on time, my worst fears might not have happened. I triggered Micah as my anger grew. The baby sobbed softly at, I suspected, the energy our angers created. A few breaths later, Micah and I pulled the control over the four of us like a blanket while Nathaniel muttered to Harry. That was enough to calm all of us a bit more and settle my nerves even.</p>
  <p>This was why I never drank. A drinker’s life was not the only thing hurt with alcohol-fueled indiscretions. I couldn’t say Lily’s mother had been drunk, but I had little doubt my dad hadn´t been. Please God, let it have happened before Mom and Dad were together. However, I thought I was beginning to see a disturbing pattern that could not be denied. “How accurate is this magical tracing? Is it like DNA testing?”</p>
  <p>“Though I have no idea what DNA testing is, there are no doubts at all, Ms. Blake. Lily Evans was in blood, at least, Lily Blake. Harry’s mother was your younger half-sister.” McGonagall softly explained and my heart crushed.</p>
  <p>With as quick as Dad married Judith, I doubted that Lily was conceived between her and my mother. Still, I prayed that the timing was right.</p>
  <p>Nathaniel looked up, confusion on his face. “How can you not know what DNA testing is?”</p>
  <p>I agreed with him. DNA had been around for so long, surely someone had discussed it in their school. Paternity suits happened all the time and were normally decided on the test results.</p>
  <p>“The Wizarding World is strictly removed from the Muggle World, Mr. Graison.” McGonagall snapped. Oh yeah, with that attitude, she was a teacher without any doubt. “We do not use most technology as electricity and magic cannot share the same space.”</p>
  <p>“So your magical tracing of bloodlines is the same as our DNA testing, proving where a person comes from by blood?” Micah asked.</p>
  <p>Dumbledore nodded, “I suppose that is true. Because of the way in which Lily died and the protection that her death gave Harry, he must live with one of Lily’s blood family for at the least part of the year. After what we discovered along with the results of the test, we had hoped for either Mr Blake or his daughter to take up guardianship of the boy. To save Harry from what could likely be a further childhood of abuse in the least.”</p>
  <p>My mind was whirling. I may have had a sister, but she was dead. My Dad may or may not have cheated on my Mom before she died. I may have an orphaned nephew who I had to take care of the rest of his life. I almost hoped this was a prank or a hidden camera show. Something inside told me that my hope was pointless.</p>
  <p>“Look you cannot just show up with a baby and claim by magic that you know he is related to me,” I said, even though I only half believed my own words. “Without a DNA test, I don’t see myself believing this.”</p>
  <p>Nathaniel gave me sad eyes. I knew he had felt so excited at the idea of a baby when I had my near miss and especially in the last few months. He and Micah would have twisted their lives up for a child then. Now I held no doubt that they would do the same. Add on the fact that my supposed nephew too had suffered from abuse, well there was no arguing with the pair. I wondered if the others would accept this? ‘Hey guys, we have a baby boy! No trying to bounce him either.’ Yeah, that talk would be interesting.</p>
  <p>“Anita?” Nathaniel whimpered.</p>
  <p>I sighed and looked at his lavender eyes I loved so much. “Nathaniel, I need a shred of proof. And besides, look at how our lives have gone up to now.”</p>
  <p>He shut his eyes and hugged Harry tight. “I know, but he needs us. I wouldn’t care if he weren’t your family. I want to protect him.”</p>
  <p>“Sweetie, I want to protect him too, that is why I said to look at our lives.”</p>
  <p>Micah sighed and I knew he agreed with both of us. “What about your father?”</p>
  <p>I thought of my seemingly not so wonderful father. He was in a better position and far safer than we would to take care of this angel. Looking at the elderly man, I think my question he at least suspected. “Did you contact my Dad?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” McGonagall said tersely. “He and that she-demon slammed the door in our faces the moment we mentioned Lily’s name. The man had the nerve to say he knew nothing about Lily, but I saw the shocked knowledge in his face. He looked as if he was one of my pupils caught in some offence and looking for any way out of trouble the moment he looked at Harry.”</p>
  <p>Nathaniel glared and I knew the story was truly getting to him if he was becoming so deeply angry. “He didn’t even bother to ask if his daughter was okay?”</p>
  <p>“No, he did not.” Dumbledore now had a worried look in his eyes. “Such leaves us with only you, Ms. Blake, and the Dursleys.”</p>
  <p>Not only had my father ignored his child, but he didn’t even bother to learn what happened to her and why his grandson was at his door? The nagging thought of what created this situation haunted me. My father had a secret daughter he did not support or even speak of to anyone. I needed to know how far back this betrayal went.</p>
  <p>There was the chance that this happened in the in-between months from my mother’s death to Dad marrying Judith. “Professors, when was Lily born?”</p>
  <p>“Lily was born on the thirtieth of January 1960,” Dumbledore explained.</p>
  <p>Micah clamped a hard hold on me as my power rose with my rage. I felt my face grow dark with my thoughts. How dare he? That year made me five turning six. So, when I was between four and five, my father – the man who seemingly worshiped the ground my mother walked on – cheated on her and me. Then he cheated me out of a little sister.</p>
  <p>My last thought made my eyes ache with tears. Were I to believe these people, I would never meet a sister who might have accepted me as I am. Why did my life have to be so messed up?</p>
  <p>Again, Harry’s whimpering pulled me back. I grabbed Micah even tighter and breathed him in repeatedly. Crying was for alone with men I loved, not for company. Besides Harry was crying enough for the both of us as it was. I forced my beasts to calm down for him and the child too had captured them. They backed down and returned to their mystical wood within me to calm themselves for Harry.</p>
  <p>Finally, I looked over to see Nathaniel kissing the top of Harry’s head. He was seemingly convinced I would finally say no to all of this. I didn’t want to think about breaking anyone’s heart today. Damn we were supposed to be enjoying a hooky day, not dealing with backordered emotional shit.</p>
