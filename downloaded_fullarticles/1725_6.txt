    <p>
  <span>The sleek, blood red Hogwarts Express whistled cheerfully, clouds of steam puffing out of its spout as throngs of people poured out of the many passenger carriages. It was one of the few trains that made the lengthy journey to the Highlands of Scotland from England. In fact, the next trip scheduled for the train was in a few minutes. A few people boarded the carriages, most appearing to be of high society and some of normal middle class or lower. Not as many people as before boarded the train because of the private, by invite only, trip the train had scheduled. The last train whistle blew signaling that it would depart shortly. The train doors began to shut, almost clipping a late arrival who stood catching his breath for a few moments before heading further into the carriage to find his assigned room number printed on his invitation, ticket, and engraved on his key. His unruly, black curls appeared messier than usual and his round, wire framed glasses sat askew on his nose due to him rushing to catch the train. He had woken up late that morning, much to his dismay, only managing to shove random articles of clothing lying around his room, his work, and a book or two into his suitcase before whirling out of his flat in London, coat and scarf in hand and hair uncombed (not like it would make much of a difference). </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Private investigator Harry Potter collapsed onto the unoccupied, bottom bunk covered by a red quilt. He sighed, rubbing his face with his hands and fixed his glasses. Popping open his worn, leather suitcase, the young freelance detective rummaged around the haphazard pile of his stuff, trying to find the documents to the recent case he picked up. It contained the details of the area in Scotland, Hogsmeade, he would be going to and the leads on the case. He pulled out a rather thin packet only containing three pages of information on the investigation. Harry grimaced as he flipped through the sparse pages mainly made up of large pictures of the crime scenes and the victims. Very little evidence was found at the crime scenes, and all of the murders were committed differently. The murderer was on the move, beginning in London and had been slowly making his way up to Scotland. Also, the victims’ bodies were all found arranged carefully in different ways and positions, some of the bodies being mutilated while other remained seemingly untouched. However, the only things that were common with all the killings was a carving of a skull with a snake coming of its mouth on the forearm of all the victims, two small puncture wounds which appeared to be a snake bite, and the words ‘I am Lord Voldemort’ with a small lightning bolt drawn underneath scrawled beautifully in elegant handwriting on a small piece of parchment with the victim’s blood. It was almost as if the killer was trying to ‘sign’ his works of ‘art’. It caused the killer to be dubbed ‘Lord of Snakes’ by the newspapers, for everyone feared to utter the name Voldemort since the person who first wrote an article on the killer and called him Voldemort was found dead the next morning-- posed and signed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scotland Yard wasn’t making a whole lot of headway, so one of the victim’s family hired Harry through the freelance group ‘The Order of the Phoenix’. He couldn’t really turn it down since work was a little slow lately… that and Dumbledore, the head of the Order, assigned Harry to this case. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why him? He wasn't the usual field work type, for he was the psychologist of the team. Harry still could not understand Dumbledore’s decision on giving him the case, despite his skills in psychiatry… Hermione was usually better at these types of cases. She could easily piece information together and come up with ideas from small details. She’d have a blast with this case. And then there was Ron— he’d definitely have a blast with figuring out the strategy this guy was using… Harry missed his two best mates. To be completely honest, the main reason Harry had probably been assigned this task was that fact he hadn't been in any newspapers since he was little, so the killer wouldn't know his identity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Obtaining one invitation to this private trip was quite difficult, nevermind two others, and since this was the only train headed to the highlands of Scotland for two weeks, well Harry had to go undercover alone. Folding and placing the files in the front pocket of his pants, Harry stood up and shook off his black trench coat, placing it on the hook on the back of the door. He walked into the adjoining bathroom to examine his appearance. Unkempt, wild, black curls, vivid green eyes hidden behind round glasses, slightly rumpled, grey,  v-necked sweater, upturned collar on his white button down, crooked burgundy and gold tie, and some nice fitting, black slacks with a few, nearly unnoticeable mud and coffee stains. He fixed his tie, straightened out his sweater, and folded his collar down. He tried to pat down his curls but, to no avail, they just sprung back up. Shrugging his shoulders, Harry turned out of the bathroom and picked up his invitation that sat on the bed. He glanced down at the piece of paper, the name Harrison Evans greeted his eyes in a swooping, gold, cursive. They had chosen a name close to his original name since Dumbledore wanted to take extra precautions with this case since they were dealing with a highly skilled serial killer. The details written on the piece of parchment included the host of this trip, the meal times, the activities offered, etc. A man by the name Tom Riddle was hosting and sponsoring this trip. Apparently he came from an old family with money. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry exited his cabin with his invitation in hand for they would be conducting the last check up round to make sure no one without an invitation had made it onto the train. He walked through several carriages until he found a fairly crowded one where people sat at tables, lining the interior of the carriage or stood next to the bar. It appeared to be the dining carriage, each table covered in a crisp, forest green table cloth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry scanned the area for an unoccupied table, spotting one in the far right corner and began to briskly walk toward it. Just as he made it to the table, however, a man with neat short, brown hair that elegantly curled a little bit at the ends slid into the wooden, booth styled seat across from Harry. He wore a deep green suit jacket that would look black without enough lighting and an equally dark green tie. A silver pocket square complimented the look, and then their eyes met.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shit. He had been staring. Clearing his throat, Harry turned on his heel, trying to hide the bright blush on his face. He started to walk away but was stopped by a smooth, baritone voice much like honey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can sit here if you want to.” The man flashed him a charming smile and gestured to the seat across from him. Harry's eyes darted all around the carriage, trying to avoid the awkward confrontation but found that almost all the seats were already taken. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, that would be great… er thanks,” Harry said, mentally cringing as he sat down. Why was he always so awkward in these situations. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Mr. Evans, why did you accept the invitation to go on this journey?” The man stared at Harry, his gaze intense and calculating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been meaning to do some traveling and work has also led me to the highlands of Scotland… ” Harry answered. Wait, how did this stranger know his name?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Intuition… or the fact that your name is written on your invitation that you placed on the table when you sat down, but I like to stick with intuition.” The man stated as if reading Harry's thoughts. He smirked, his eyes hooded by his long lashes. “My name is Tom Riddle, nice to meet you Harrison, if I may call you that, you can call me Tom.” A white gloved hand was offered to Harry which he accepted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, yes you can and, um, nice to meet you too… Tom.” Harry gave the man a firm handshake as realization washed over him. “Oh, um, ern,” Harry stammered. “S-so you’re the man hosting this event.” He could feel the heat of his blush spread to his ears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would appear so,” Tom said, amused by the man before him. He paused before continuing. “I wanted to have a little… fun and make a point, you see.” A smile spread across Tom’s lips. It was not like the previous smile and sent shivers down Harry’s spine-- it reminded him of a snake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking off the chills that had just settled in in bones, Harry absentmindedly rubbed his forehead on the spot where a lightning bolt scar had been etched into his skin. He had gotten it on the night of his parents’ murder. The memories of that night were a blur, his mind choosing to bury them until he forgot, but there were a few things he could remember. Getting ready for bed, his mother’s dead body in front of him, and then a burning feeling on his forehead. One thing that remained etched into his mind was the ornate hilt of the knife used both for killing his parents and carving the lightning bolt on his head. It was an ivory blade with a bone shaped hilt, and curling up the hilt were two snakes threaded through a skull and eating each other. Harry felt nauseous, the memories vivid in his mind, his parents’ dead bodies popping up again and again. But the more he saw them the more he could see the connection in style of killing to the present case he was on. Strange.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay Harrison? You look a bit pale.” Harry blinked rapidly, his cheeks reddening slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, sorry I have a tendency to get caught up in my thoughts, work always seems to follow me wherever I go…” Harry looked down the silverware, his green eyes reflecting back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I can ask a waiter for some water,” Tom suggested, his brow slightly furrowed in worry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, that would be lovely, thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry began to bounce his knee, the anxiety that the memories brought setting in. Riddle’s keen eyes on him didn't help either. That cool, cobalt blue stare seemed to be examining him, analyzing his every movement as if he were some sort of test subject. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So tell me, Harrison, if you don’t mind me asking, what exactly </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> you do for ‘work’?” Harry rested his head in one hand while he squeezed his other in fist so hard he could feel the nails biting into his palm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm a professor at a local college.” Tom nodded his head and leaned forward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what subject do you teach?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Criminal psychology,” Harry answered, grateful that he and Dumbledore had created an extensive backstory that wasn't too far from the truth. Yet, somehow he could feel those eyes seeing the lies in his own. He just had to be smooth. He could be smooth, right? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Interesting… so Harrison, have you been covering the recent murders in class?” A waiter came over and placed a tall glass of icy water on the forest green table. Harry watched as the glass perspired, leaving a ring of deeper green around it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, a little bit. Can't seem to stop the onslaught of questions, so might as well answer them.” Harry lifted the glass to his lips, his eyes catching a glimpse of Tom’s eyes flickering down to his swallowing throat which caused him to choke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harrison, are you sure you are alright?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry coughed while setting the glass down and patting his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he coughed. “I'm fine-- down the wrong pipe, that's all.” Harry tried to give Tom a smile but it looked more like a grimace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what do you do for a living, Mr-- Er, Tom?” Harry said, attempting to lead the conversation away from his little mishap with swallowing. Tom’s eyebrows lifted slightly while his deep brown, charmingly curled at the tip hair fell slightly in front of left eye. His cupid bow lips curved upward into a dashing smile, revealing snow white teeth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m an artist. I travel around for inspiration for my work.” Harry nodded, surprised by the wealthy man’s occupation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What medium do you focus on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sculpting, but on the rare occasion I'll paint or sketch,” Tom answered. “Would you like me to paint you?” Tom raised an eyebrow suggestively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure” Harry replied, but then it hit him. “Wait-- you don't mean-- er-- what I'm trying to say--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It just a simple painting, Harrison, no need to fret,” Tom said smirking. Harry shifted in his chair uncomfortably, hitting a new high score of awkwardness achieved in a single conversation with a person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it seems about time to make my speech,” Tom said while standing up. He took Harry’s glass and lightly tapped it with a silver knife he had also plucked from the table. The monotonous murmurs of the people crowded in the carriage died down almost instantly at the sound of the glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ladies and gentlemen, as most of you already know, I am Tom Riddle the host of this event.” People politely applauded for a brief moment before Tom continued. “You have all been hand selected by me because of your skill, status, or by complete chance.” His keen eyes scanned the room, the way he held his body conveying complete confidence and regalness. Was that a flash of red in his eyes? “Your invitations will be collected as you exit this carriage to take part in the activities, or relax. I hope you all enjoy this trip and let the games begin!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Darkness. Harry blinked his eyes several times, trying to get them adjusted to the dark. Was there something wrong with the electricity? He could hear some shuffling and quiet whispers of the rest of the people in the carriage, and could feel the unease of the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do not worry everyone,” Tom’s calm voice rang clear, settling the ripples of anxiety in the puddle of people. “We are just experiencing a little shortage which happens every now and then. The power will be back on soon so do not fret.” Harry could hear some scattered sighs within the quiet whispers as the people adjusted to the situation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can anyone else feel something warm, wet, and sticky?” The voice was not too far away from where Harry and Tom sat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lights flickered on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A scream.</span>
</p>
