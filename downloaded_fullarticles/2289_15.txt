    <p>Harry stared in horror as Remus lacked his bags, ready to leave Hogwarts, where he was so loved. “Don’t go,” Harry pleaded, using his most tears eyed, wibbly lipped look. “Please?”</p>
<p>Remus felt his heart break. “Oh, Harry,” he said softly, hugging him close. “I’m so sorry, but the parents know that I’m a werewolf now. I don’t want the school to face any issues because of me being in the castle.” He paused to look down at Harry, who was still making cow eyes at him. “Besides, I need to take care of Sirius. He’s not in the best place now, mentally or physically.”</p>
<p>Harry slumped, defeated. At the door, Dumbledore watched the scene unfold, his old heart cracking from the raw emotion. Coming to a decision, he cleared his throat. “Remus.”</p>
<p>“Albus,” Remus greeted him, smiling. </p>
<p>Dumbledore strode into the room. “I am afraid that I must concur with Harry, here. Put away your bags, my boy.”</p>
<p>“S-sir?”</p>
<p>“Although you have decided to vacate your position as a teacher, I am delighted to offer you a position as a guidance counselor, consulting at Hogwarts from your new offices in Hogsmeade, but a stone’s throw away from the campus.”</p>
<p>Remus staggered back, and Harry squealed with delight. “Professor, you’re the best!” Harry beamed. </p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry,” Albus smiled, preening.</p>
<p>“B-but Albus,” Remus whispered, “what about Sirius?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore continued smiling. “I am certain that your new lodgings will be more than adequate for your assistant, the therapy dog,” he said, winking. </p>
<p>Remus sank down to sit on his trunk. “A-Albus, I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>“Say yes,” Dumbledore advised. “In the times ahead of us, I am sure that the students will need your stabilizing presence more than ever.” Then, “I trust you, Remus.”</p>
<p>Harry bounced over excitedly. “Come on, Professor Lupin! Take the post! That way, we can see each other all the time, and Sirius can have a home with us!”</p>
<p>Remus gave a tremulous smile, and nodded, to Harry’s celebratory whoop and Dumbledore’s twinkle. </p>
<p>“Excellent!” Dumbledore trilled, clapping his hands. “Now, pack your bags, Remus! You’re moving in to Number 7, Bumblebee Cottage!”</p>
<p>Remus paused. “Albus, isn’t that your house?”</p>
<p>Albus waved his hand dismissively. “Pish posh. I don’t live there anymore. The cottage might as well go to good use.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled. “Thank you, Albus. You’re a good man.” He bent over to pick up his trunk, and paused when Dumbledore slapped his hands away.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t bother,” Dumbledore said. “You must be so tired after your transformation. I daresay that Severus would be more than happy to help you move,’ he said, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>Harry snickered, and was soon joined by Dumbledore and Lupin himself. For once, it looked like they were going to have a happy ending.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Dumbledore broke the news of Remus’ appointment as the off-campus guidance counsellor, there was mass rejoicing from the students. Several older students threw flowers at the teacher’s table at Lupin, much to his surprise. Before long, he was buried under a horde of red roses. Even Albus had gotten a few roses, strangely. </p>
<p>Snape was having kittens, and his hand inched forward to Lupin’s throat. He was foiled, though, as Remus preempted his move and used it to maneuver him into a hug instead. Trapped in his own plan, Severus slumped, admitting defeat.</p>
<p>“Yes, Remus Lupin has consented to lend his heart and mind to us as Hogwarts’ newest guidance counselor! Hogsmeade weekends will be specially extended for counseling sessions with him to those who need it,” Albus beamed. “With the combined powers of Remus and his therapy dog, Padfoot, Hogwarts students will have a safe space to go and confide in a trusted adult.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Sirius in animagus form jumped onto the table. His mouth split into a goofy grin with his tongue lolling out, and his tail wagged furiously, batting Snape in the face. “Bork!”</p>
<p>“Heck,” Severus cursed, leaning away. Several students aww’ed and ooh’ed at the friendly pupper, and Padfoot jumped down so that he could be petted. Everyone, even the Slytherins, commented on what a good dog he was. Padfoot eventually settled at the Gryffindor table, leisurely stretched over Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s laps, were they giggled and petted his fluffy head. </p>
<p>As far as feasts went, it was one of the best.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The train ride back, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed themselves into Remus’ compartment, and talked his ear off. They had several visitors, who all were looking for excuses to play with Padfoot. </p>
<p>Even Malfoy was charmed by the happy dog, and in a stunning few moments of normality, giggled and petted Padfoot as he nuzzled and jumped all over the normally prim blonde boy. </p>
<p>Upon seeing everyone staring at him, Draco recovered his sneer and stood to walk away, but not before patting Padfoot on the head one last time. The train pulled into the platform, and Draco rushed over to his parents and pretended to be snooty again.</p>
<p>Alone in the compartment now, Padfoot whined and bumped Harry with his nose, making the boy’s face crumple. “Aw, I don’t want to go either, Sirius,” he said. “But I’ll write loads. I’m staying with Ron for all of August, so maybe we could see each other then.” He looked up at Remus. “Remus, could you maybe threaten the Dursleys for me? Just to let Hedwig out.”</p>
<p>“What a splendid idea, Harry, of course I shall oblige,” Remus said happily.<br/>They went up the platform and into King’s Cross and located the Dursleys. Harry grabbed Remus’ hand (Remus’ heart swelled with joy) and walked over. Before Vernon could open his sinkhole of a mouth, Remus spoke. “Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, my name is Remus Lupin, I am the guidance counselor at Harry’s school.”</p>
<p>At the mention of Harry’s school, Vernon shut his mouth and opened his eyes wide. Remus continued to look soft and handsome and pure and good. The dichotomy could really not have been sharper, and for the millionth time, Harry imagined running away to Remus’ and persuading the man to move to Australia with him and Sirius. Noticing that Remus had started talking again, Harry snapped out of his daydream. </p>
<p>“...home visits in my capacity as the guidance counselor, but Harry has assured me that daily letters will suffice. For this reason, he needs his owl...”</p>
<p>Harry smiled and went back to daydreaming about living in Australia with his two dads, who were secretly superheroes and defeated Australian death eaters with their goodness and might.   By day, they were Sirius and Remus, but by night, they were Wolfman and Ultimate Doggo, heroes of the wizarding world.</p>
<p>“...so glad that you understand,” Remus finished, baring his fangs in a smile at Vernon, who cringed away. “All sorted, Harry,” Remus said, bringing Harry out of his daydreams again. Harry beamed and allowed Remus to ruffle his hair, and for Padfoot to lick his face several times before Harry left with the suitably terrified Dursleys. </p>
<p>This was going to be a good summer.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>July had fled by, as had August, and soon the school term had started up again. Sirius was very much looking forward to his new job as therapy dog, where his main duty was snuggling up to Harry as much as was possible. </p>
<p>Remus has set up his office and had stocked up on a lot of chocolate - dark, milk, and white, for all the students they would be getting. It was a Triwizard Tournament year, and Dumbledore had already slated Remus to regularly meet with the three champions, whoever they would be. </p>
<p>“Well, we’re officially in business, Sirius,” he said, glancing at his friend as they finished lining the shelves with the last of Remus’ books. </p>
<p>“Yup, Lupin and Black, counselors at practice,” Sirius beamed. “Saving students since 1994.”</p>
<p>It had a nice ring to it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Harry was a Triwizard champion. Sirius nearly brought the roof down with his distraught howling, and Remus scheduled an emergency appointment for his boy. </p>
<p>During Hogsmeade weekend, Harry came dashing into Remus’ office, followed by Hermione, who was loudly seething about the stupidity of their so called “authority figures”. Remus was inclined to agree with her, but gave her some hot chocolate to calm her down first. </p>
<p>Harry was being cuddled by Sirius very effectively, and Remus soon joined the smothering session. “It’s dragons,” Harry said, “we have to get past dragons!”</p>
<p>Sirius was quick to suggest a conjunctivitis curse. Remus suggested the same, but done on a broom for a quick getaway. “You’re so smart, Moony,” Sirius said in awe.</p>
<p>Remus blushed, and tried to steer the conversation back to Harry. “You must be so stressed, Harry,” he said sympathetically. </p>
<p>“Uh huh,” Harry concurred. “To top it all, Ron is being a jealous git for no reason, and Malfoy made these awful badges, plus Moody’s set on traumatizing everyone-“</p>
<p>The story came spilling out, and by the end of the visit, Harry had left with a sound theory on how to perform a conjunctivitis curse, and many assurances that he was loved and cherished by his two super-dads, partners in doling out vigilante justice under the cover of night.</p>
<p>Remus, however, was very angry. “I am going to schedule appointments with young Malfoy and Ronald, plus Neville Longbottom,” he said. “And then I am going to absolutley murder Alastor Moody.”</p>
<p>“I will help you,” Sirius said. “I will get a shovel and dig a grave.”</p>
<p>“Burning leaves less clues, darling,” Remus said gently. </p>
<p>“Oh, right you are, you’re so clever,” Sirius said admiringly. </p>
<p>Remus blushed. “Aw. Thanks.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hello, Neville,” Remus smiled as the boy walked into his office, flanked by Hermione and Harry. As though sensing the boy’s fear, Padfoot bounded forward and danced around Neville, alleviating what hesitation he may have had. </p>
<p>“Hello, sir,” Neville said softly. sitting on the couch between Harry and Hermione. Padfoot draped himself over the three of them, and got his much desired belly rubs. </p>
<p>Remus smiled and handed Neville some milk chocolate. “I heard about Defence class, Neville. Would you like to talk about it? I’m sure you would feel better if you got it off of your chest.”</p>
<p>The story came tumbling out amidst some tears, lots of shivering, and more chocolates. By the end of it, Neville was a wreck, and Hermione of was hugging him as though he would float away if she let him go. </p>
<p>“Neville,” Remus said softly, drawing the boy’s eyes to himself, “it must have been incredibly difficult for you to see the curse in action. I’m sorry that you had to go through that.”</p>
<p>“Gran doesn’t think so,” Neville murmured. “She said that I had to face it if I want to be an auror.”</p>
<p>Remus raised his eyebrow. “I’m sensing a but, there.”</p>
<p>Neville sniffled. “I don’t think I want to be an auror,” he said miserably. “I never much liked the idea. All I’ve ever wanted to do is...”</p>
<p>“Go on,” Remus said gently.</p>
<p>“All I’ve ever wanted to do is to have my own orchard for wand wood trees,” Neville confessed, his eyes lighting up. “Cedar, holly, and elder trees dotting the landscape, the sounds of bowtruckles in the air, and the occasional mandrake crying renting the air.”</p>
<p>Remus was about ready to join Hermione and hug the poor boy in front of him. Luckily, Padfoot got there first and sprawled across Neville’s lap, and pawed valiantly at the boy’s tears. </p>
<p>“Neville,” Remus said, “what your grandmother wants and what you want are two different things. There’s nothing wrong it’s not wanting to be an auror. When the time comes, you can and should tell Augusta how you feel. If she truly loves you, she will understand. Herbology is a time honored and noble field, and I am sure that Professor Sprout or Dumbledore can help set you up with an apprenticeship. From what I recall, your herbology scores were quite remarkable.”</p>
<p>Neville sniffled gratefully. “R-really?”</p>
<p>“Really,” Remus said seriously. Then he smiled. “There’s nothing wrong with living your dream.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Nev,” Harry said. “If your gran doesn’t listen, then you can always come and live with me and Remus and Pads, here.”</p>
<p>“Woof!” Sirius concurred happily. </p>
<p>By the time the kids had left, Remus was already planning on expanding the cottage floor space.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theodore Nott coming to see him was a surprise.</p>
<p>“Can I come in?” Theodore asked softly. Remus let the boy in, and ushered him into a seat. Before he could shut the door, however, Draco Malfoy also came storming in after him, shooting Lupin a distrustful look.</p>
<p>“Draco, if Theodore would like privacy during his consultation-“</p>
<p>“I am going to be here,” Draco said with finality, “so you don’t try to eat him.”</p>
<p>Sirius growled, but Remus merely looked amused. “I’m vegetarian for the most part,” he said. </p>
<p>“The most part?”</p>
<p>“I do indulge in some chicken during the full moon period,” Remus admitted. “It keeps the wolf satisfied. A vegetarian diet also tames the wolf’s bloodlust somewhat.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Draco said shortly, and plonked himself onto the couch next to Theo, who looked to harbour none of his friend’s misconceptions.</p>
<p>Remus hand both boys a chocolate each, and sat down. “What seems to be the problem, Theodore?” He asked kindly.</p>
<p>“I’ve been having nightmares,” Theo said quietly. “Since Defence class.”</p>
<p>Remus had never wanted to kill someone more. Alastor Moody was going to die a very painful death, preferably at his hands.</p>
<p>“The Unforgivables,” Remus stated. Theo nodded. “Theodore,” Remus said softly, “have you been...exposed to those spells?”</p>
<p>Theodore frowned and shook his head. “No...not those-“</p>
<p>“Theodore’s father,” Draco piped up, “is an arse of the highest order. He uses flagellating curses as discipline. And he hits him, like some medieval monstrosity!” Draco took a deep breath to calm himself. “I keep telling Theo that my mother and father would take him in a heartbeat, but he insists on staying with that...creature! ARGH!”</p>
<p>Remus let out a heavy sigh and then handed Draco a pillow. The boy put it to his face and screamed into it, flailing angrily, and Remus couldn’t help but develop a soft corner for this prickly, sneering, but ultimately sweet child. </p>
<p>He turned back to Theo, his expression purposefully light. “Theo, I need you to know that what your father is doing to you is wrong,” he said. “You don’t deserve to be beaten. Take it from another adult who has known you - you’re a good, smart, and resourceful young man.”</p>
<p>Theodore looked up, his stoic expression giving way to doubt. “Not good enough,” he said hoarsely. </p>
<p>Draco pillow-screamed some more. </p>
<p>Remus smiled. “I think you’ll find that your friend disagrees, as do I. You’re an excellent young man, who deserves a stable home. If you’ll allow it, I will attempt to find you a place.”</p>
<p>Theodore looked unconvinced. “My dad’s...powerful. He won’t like it.”</p>
<p>“I am a werewolf,” Remus countered grimly, “and there isn’t much that can hurt me. It is also very difficult to get past me, and you father will have to go through me to get you.”</p>
<p>The frank admission of Remus’ nature managed to unblock something in Theodore. “I need to think about it - Draco stop screaming - but I will consider it, if only to get Draco to stop,” Theo promised. And somehow, Remus knew that he meant it. “But these days, I can’t sleep due to the nightmares.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded. “Of course. Before resorting to dreamless sleep potion, I would advise a more passive approach. A lavender and sage bundle under your pillow, and chamomile tea before you sleep. If it doesn’t work, then you will have to use the potion.”</p>
<p>Theodore nodded. “Thanks, sir,” he said. “And, um, regarding the placement- er, alright,” he said sheepishly. “I just didn’t want anyone else to get hurt ‘cause of my dad.”</p>
<p>Remus beamed. “Don’t you worry, I’ll hurt him way before he can think of coming after you.”</p>
<p>Theodore was startled into a laugh. “Wow. You’re not a typical counsellor, huh?”</p>
<p>Draco perked up. “Do you need a murder plan? I have a murder plan. There is a convenient bog just off of the forbidden forest, it is an excellent dumping ground for bodies-“</p>
<p>“Thank you Draco,” Remus interrupted the boy hurriedly, “but I have an idea already.”</p>
<p>“Let me know if you need help,” Draco said seriously, getting to his feet. “Come on, Nott, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Theodore gave Remus a thankful smile and followed Draco out, and Remus sat back to plot.</p>
<p>Sirius transformed back and sat next to Remus. “Are we gonna adopt that kid? Because I have to update my will if we do.”</p>
<p>Remus grinned at his strange, lovely friend. “Sirius, we are not married. Also, you don’t like me that way.”</p>
<p>“Ah, true,” Sirius said. “I forgot about that. I think I hallucinated that we were together - couldn’t figure out when or why though. Fucking Azkaban fucking with my memories.” Sirius paused, then said, “Did we ever sleep in the same bed?”</p>
<p>“Multiple times.”</p>
<p>“And did you kiss me whilst dressed as a girl?”</p>
<p>“Yes, when we were sixteen, and you needed an excuse to avoid punishment for a prank. I was your ‘girlfriend’ from the village.”</p>
<p>“Ah, good, so those memories weren’t false,” Sirius said, nodding. “What about your pregnancy?”</p>
<p>“My what.”</p>
<p>“Pregnancy. I distinctly recall you holding a baby and singing lullabies.”</p>
<p>“That was Harry, fourteen years ago. I was never pregnant.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Sirius said, and then lay down with his head in Remus’ lap. “I’m so lucky that you’re here for me, Moony.”</p>
<p>Remus allowed himself a moment to relax with his best friend before resuming his work. He could always make time for Sirius.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“ALBUS.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Remus,” Dumbledore beamed as Lupin and Sirius charged into his office. “To what do I owe the pleas- oh, you’re angry,” Albus said, correctly interpretting the popping vein in Remus’ forehead. </p>
<p>“Did you know,” Remus gritted out, “that Alastor Moody has been demonstrating Unforgivables in his classes? In front of children, some of whom have had very bad experiences with those very same curses?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s expression immediately fell. “Oh dear,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“I would like to request that he be sacked and killed.”</p>
<p>“I will come up with something,” Albus promised, “but finding Defence teachers is a nigh impossible task these days. In the meantime, I am sure that the students affected would benefit from more time with you.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded. “There is a bog, near the forbidden forest-“</p>
<p>“I am aware of the murder bog,’ Albus said sagely. “Rest assured, Remus, the students will be taken care of.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded, thanked Albus, and then left to go to the dungeons. There was a certain greaseball that he needed to speak to.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Yoo hoo, Severus?” Remus called, cracking the door to the potions classroom open. Snape sat up and glared as Padfoot dashed in and shed all over him. </p>
<p>“Lupin,” Severus spat. “Go away.”</p>
<p>“No, I need to talk to you,” Remus said, closing the door behind him. Snape stood up and backed away. </p>
<p>“Why did you close the door?”</p>
<p>“What I’m about to tell you is private,” Remus said quietly. “Sirius, please stand by the door for me.” Sirius loped gracefully over and planted himself in front of the door, while Remus stood across from Severus. “Severus, I need you to know something-“</p>
<p>Severus sighed and dropped his chin to his chest. “Say no more, Lupin. I know what you have to say.”</p>
<p>Remus stared. “You do?”</p>
<p>Snape nodded. “The past year has made it clear to me that you carry a torch for me. Alas, too much has occurred between us, and circumstances will never be such that we can be romantically involved without Black or some unforeseen evil devastating us.”</p>
<p>Remus stilled. “Um, actually, I was here in my capacity as a counsellor. Theodore Nott came to see me.”</p>
<p>Snape drew back, shocked. “Well, I never. Oh, I say. By Jove. Good Lord.”</p>
<p>“Severus, calm down,” Remus pleaded. </p>
<p>“No, I shan’t. Egads. Good grief.”</p>
<p>Remus sighed and spoke over him. “Theodore’s father is abusing him. He needs to be placed in a stable home.”</p>
<p>Snape immediately snapped out of his horrified stupor. “He has never told me of this,” Snape said, his eyes narrowing. </p>
<p>Remus cleared his throat. “You’re not exactly...approachable, Severus,” he said. </p>
<p>“That is by design,” Severus said. “I am Head of House for Slytherin, not Hufflepuff. My students problems involve murder and pain, not ‘oh no I’ve oversweetened the cookies’.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded, remembering Draco and the murder bog. “Well, we need to place Theodore in a different home, and I was hoping...”</p>
<p>Severus cotyoned on to Remus’ intentions. “Oh no. No. No, no, never in a million years, Lupin. Are you out of your doggone mind? Why would you consider me a candidate for raising a child?”</p>
<p>“You are his head of house,” Remus stressed. “You’re a trusted adult.”</p>
<p>“You take him, then!”</p>
<p>“I have Harry,” Remus said, and Sirius woofed happily. “Harry comes with his own issues, and needs a lot of attention.”</p>
<p>“Egads,” Snape said, and sunk into his chair. “What about another teacher?”</p>
<p>“They’re not close enough to Theodore,” Remus said. “And he trusts you. He was willing to go to you with his issues if I were not a choice. In fact, he may yet come to see you. He’s been having nightmares.”</p>
<p>“Oh, blast it all,” Severus groaned. “At least he is grown past potty training.”</p>
<p>“So you’ll take him in?” Remus asked, and was overjoyed when Snape nodded wearily.</p>
<p>“What other choice do we have?”</p>
<p>Remus patted Severus’ hand and left him to stew. “You’re a secretly sweet man, Severus Snape.” Sirius barked and bounced out the door, but Remus paused to look back at Snape. “Oh, and Severus?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Remus smiled coyly. “Never say never.”</p>
<p>Remus left, leaving a flabbergasted Snape with mixed feelings and the prospect of impending fatherhood.</p>
