    <p>"Watch where you're walking, Potter," a familiar voice drawled as Harry was shoved to the side by a huge body.</p><p>
  <span>Catching himself before he could fall, he readjusted his glasses, shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe if you and your thugs didn't take up the whole bloody hallway he wouldn't have run into you," Ron defended, pulling Harry's arm to lead him away from the group of Slytherins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wordlessly followed after the two, concern etched on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron was still muttering insults under his breath when the world seemed to dip under Harry’s feet and he caught on to Ron’s arm before he could fall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Blimey Harry, you look awfully pale," said Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry," asked Hermione, "are you feeling well?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah... guess I just didn't eat enough at breakfast or something," replied Harry, shaking his head again, trying to clear his thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry, you know you have to eat enough when you have a match," Hermione said, half scolding and half worried. "Come on, let's see if there's anything left from breakfast. Then you need to get on the field."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, the trio walked towards the dining hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Slytherin takes the lead with another goal, making the score now 230 to 220!" shouted Dean Thomas as broomsticks whizzed about and bludgers narrowly missed their riders. Harry scanned the field, hovering in the air in his search for the golden snitch. He'd been looking for a while now, but the small golden object seemed especially elusive today.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wow! The score is now 270 to 230! The gap is widening, and Gryffindor needs the snitch quickly if they want to come out ahead!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The game was an especially close one, although Harry knew that Gryffindor easily would have pulled ahead had it not been for Ron's nerves. Clumsily, he had let goal after goal go past him. As much as the Gryffindor's continued to score, it was no use if the Slytherins made every goal they shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, a small ball whizzed past Harry's ear, the familiar beat of wings brushing his neck with the wind they pushed. Harry reached out a hand, too late, and barely missed grabbing the snitch from its flight. He sped after it, gaining speed, but Malfoy noticed the other seeker's movements, quickly flying after the pair. Sensing Malfoy on his tail, Harry concentrated harder, yet still Malfoy gained on him, the space between the two shrinking steadily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, they were almost neck and neck. Harry reached out an arm once more as the snitch was briefly within reach but missed it once again. Malfoy suddenly pulled back and crashed into Harry, not enough to knock him off his broom but enough to make him stumble a moment. Using this to his advantage, Malfoy attempted to shift in front.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry could not let this happen. Once again, the game was on his shoulders and he needed to catch the snitch quickly if he wanted the Gryffindors to snatch the victory once again. He sped in front of Malfoy once more, using all of the energy he had left and rammed into the blonde's broom before quickly snatching the snitch out of the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victoriously, he held it up grinning, before he realized Malfoy had been knocked clean off his broom. Malfoy tumbled, hitting his head on the large pillar displaying the green of his house's colors. Before Harry could even think, he pulled out his wand, shouting, "Arresto momentum!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry you need to stop beating yourself up about this. It's a physical sport, and he wasn't terribly injured. Thanks to you..." Hermione tried to comfort, but Harry was hardly listening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mione's right," Ron said, "and if you ask me, he deserves a lot worse. If the roles were reversed, he would've done the same, if not more. He and those deatheater scum."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded, though still unconvinced. "I still shouldn't have sunk to his level. Playing dirty like that, what makes me better than him when I do shit like that?" Harry asked dejectedly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, before placing her hand comfortingly on Harry's. Ron eyed the interaction and said nothing. "What makes you better is that you regret it afterwards, and hopefully learn from your mistakes. But feeling guilty about it and continually beating yourself up for it now isn't going to take it back. He'll be fine, and you’ll be better for it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded slightly. "I still think I should go see him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know, Harry, but that's not going to help him, right? Mcgonagall said he was fine, I think it best we just leave him be," Hermione said, her hand giving Harry's a slight squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry hummed noncommittally. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you breathe between bites, Ronald?" Hermione asked disgustedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron rolled his eyes, his mouth too full to shoot back a retort. He reached across the table to grab another muffin, not even finished with the one on his plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, a shrill voice cut into their breakfast. "Won-won!" cried Lavender Brown before seizing him from behind. Ron quickly fought to swallow the enormous bite. "You played so brilliantly yesterday! Every time you stopped the ball thing I couldn't control myself, I just kept shouting you were </span>
  <em>
    <span>mine</span>
  </em>
  <span>," she said, sitting half next to and half on top of Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she said the word mine she briefly glanced at Hermione before flipping her hair and wholeheartedly snogging Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked as if she couldn't decide if she was more angry or disgusted and pushed her plate away. The two were still obliviously going at it when Harry looked across the dining hall to the Slytherin table where he couldn't help but notice a certain blonde was not occupying. Pansy and Blaise were there yet Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The snogging continued but Harry paid them no notice as Hermione stared down at her fingers, trying to focus on anything but the two people across the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unable to stand by doing nothing any longer, Harry stood, eyes never leaving the empty Slytherin seat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Harry?" Hermione asked worriedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I need to go see him," and with that, Harry left the hall before either of his friends could stop him.</span>
