    <p>Newt Scamander sat holding his case, similarly to how he had the first time he had been on the ship to New York. Here he was entering the city for the second time, except this time it was his final destination. This time he wasn’t coming to America to free a thunderbird, but rather to find one, so to speak. Not a thunderbird like Frank, this Thunderbird wasn’t actually a creature. It was Tina Goldstein, the witch who had consumed Newt’s thoughts since he had made his return to London the previous December. </p>
<p>He had written to Tina to let her know of his visit, but he had never gotten any response from her. Perhaps she didn’t see the point in writing back, he’d be almost to New York by the time he got the response if she decided to write one. Or maybe she was upset about his comment on Aurors, which he had made without thinking of how she would take it. Newt wondered if Tina was caught off guard by hearing that he would be returning to the city with just a few days notice when it had been months since he had left. He had been trying for ages to get his travel ban lifted, and was finally granted permission to continue his international travel on the fourth try. As soon as he had left the hearing where the ban had been lifted, he immediately went to make sure he could be on the next passage to New York. </p>
<p>Alongside with his case Newt was also carrying a small, wrapped package with him. Inside it was a copy of his book, one of the first printed, that he planned on gifting to Tina when he did see her. He had promised he would give her a copy in person, and that was a promise he was glad he would finally be able to keep. </p>
<p>Soon enough, the magizoologist was off the ship and, after presenting his passport and answering a few questions at customs, was ready to make his way to alert the Goldstein’s that he had arrived. It was a pleasant surprise to him to see that the woman he longed so much to see was waiting near the exit to the docks. </p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander,” Tina said, “Welcome back to New York. I hope you had a pleasant trip. I also hope you plan on keeping that case of yours secure this time.” he was taken aback by her formal tone at first, though gave a smile at her last comment. </p>
<p>“I can assure you that I have no intentions of repeating what happened last time I was here. I wasn’t expecting you to be waiting for me here, not that I mind of course.” </p>
<p>“When I got your letter I assumed you were asking me to meet you here.” Tina responded, walking with him away from the docks. She paused before speaking again, “Were you planning on finding lodging when you arrived? How long will you be in the city?” </p>
<p>Newt clutched both his case and the small package a bit tighter, “I haven’t made arrangements for my return to England yet, that is to say I’m not sure how long my visit will be. Do you have any recommendations for where I could stay?” </p>
<p>“You’re more than welcome to stay with us again, if you want. Of course you’d have to be careful not to run into Mrs. Esposito.” </p>
<p>“That’d be wonderful, assuming both you and Queenie would be alright with it. And don’t let me overstay my welcome, I’d hate to be a bother.” They continued walking in silence, Newt wondering if he had done something to upset her. He couldn’t quite place it, but something seemed off about Tina. </p>
<p>Tina walked them straight to her apartment, where Newt was greeted with a hug by Queenie. The three made small talk as the day went on, almost always initiated by the younger Goldstein. Newt had tried asking about Jacob, but noticed right away that he had brought up a sensitive subject. At the mention of the No-Maj’s name, Queenie’s bright smile faded and Tina gave a disapproving look. </p>
<p>“He got his bakery thanks to you,” Queenie said trying to keep her smile, “He’s doin’ real well. People love it.” The subject was dropped, and Newt didn’t bring it up again. At one point during the day, Newt had found refuge in his case to tend to the creatures, and had taken that time to rest the package on his workbench. It had been sitting in the Goldstein’s sitting room, yet nobody had made any effort to ask what it was. With the tension that seemed to be filling the apartment, he hadn’t wanted to be the one to bring it up. </p>
<p>It was nightfall by the time Newt finally gained the courage to ask Tina to accompany him in his case to talk. </p>
<p>“Tina,” he started, “Would you like to come see the creatures? I know Dougal has particularly been missing you.” Once in the shed, both parties began speaking at the same time. </p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander-” </p>
<p>“I have something for you,” Newt blurted out, mentally cursing himself for being so direct with it. Regardless, he picked up the wrapped book and handed it to her, “I made a promise to deliver this to you in person, I apologize that I’m a bit late in getting it to you. The Ministry wasn’t letting me travel internationally, I got here as soon as I could.” </p>
<p>“Thank you.” Tina whispered, taking it from him but not unwrapping it. “Can I ask you something, Newt?” </p>
<p>“Of course.” </p>
<p>“Why did you lie to me?” </p>
<p>Out of all the things Newt was expecting to hear, that wasn’t it. He was expecting something about his letter calling Aurors “careerist hypocrites”, what had he lied about? He couldn’t think of a single lie he could’ve possibly told her. Was it about his late return to New York and giving her a copy of his book? Surely she understood why he hadn’t been able to get it to her sooner. </p>
<p>“Can I ask what I lied about?” he asked, confused. </p>
<p>Tina sighed, “When you left in December, you said you didn’t know what Leta Lestrange liked these days, yet I assume you’d been courting her at the time.” </p>
<p>“What do you-” Tina cut him off. </p>
<p>“I read about your engagement, I should give you my congratulations. Though I do also want to ask when you were going to tell me about it?” </p>
<p>“Tina, I-”</p>
<p>She didn’t let him get a sentence out just yet, “I guess it doesn’t matter, but it’s been bothering me.” </p>
<p>“Tina I’m not engaged. I never have been.” Newt was finally able to get out, earning him a confused look in return, “Where on Earth did you read that I was?” </p>
<p>Tina simply stared at him with a puzzled look for a minute before answering, “I read it in one of the magazines Queenie gets. It’s called Spellbound...it said you and Leta were engaged. I know you’ve carried her picture with you, so I saw no reason it wouldn’t be true.”</p>
<p>“I’m not marrying Leta, my brother Theseus is. If I would’ve known this was published I would’ve written to you clarifying that immediately.”</p>
<p>“You would’ve written me specifically?” </p>
<p>“Of course. I...well, I wouldn’t want you thinking something like that is true.” There was a pause in the conversation before Newt tried to speak again, “Tina…”</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d admit this to you, especially after that article,” Tina cut him off suddenly, talking quietly again, “But I guess it doesn’t matter anymore. Before I read that, for a while I thought we might end up together. That’s why...well, like I said, that doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve actually started seeing someone else, another Auror.”</p>
<p>Newt didn’t speak for a second - he didn’t know what to say. Tina had just admitted to having had feelings for him, but didn’t anymore? Or did she? He wasn’t very sure. “I’m glad you’ve found happiness. That’s all I want for you.” he finally said, feeling his heart break. </p>
<p>“Yeah…” she mumbled, barely audible, “Happiness.” She clutched the still wrapped book closer to her, “Thank you for keeping your promise. I am sorry I jumped to conclusions about your engagement.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to tell you the truth sooner.” Newt couldn't place it, but something still seemed odd about Tina. Perhaps he should ask…</p>
<p>Tina had turned and started to leave the case before Newt had the chance to even decide if he should ask if everything was okay or not. Whatever was bothering her, he’d have to find out at another time, and only if Tina would ever allow it. </p>
<p>This trip was already not going the way he had hoped it would.</p>
