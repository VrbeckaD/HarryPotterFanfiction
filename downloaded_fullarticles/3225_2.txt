    <p>In another timeline, Harry Potter loved too much Hogwarts. So much that he decided to not leave it. After killing You-Know-Who, he came back to school, and together with his friends, he graduated and then turned into a teacher. It was nice, and after some weeks, all the young students, including the first years, would lose the passion over meeting their idol.</p><p>I mean, wouldn’t you? If your biggest idol gave homework for the holidays. How dare he.</p><p>Hermione and Rony also joined him, wanting to protect the kids from close. Hermione became a transfiguration teacher, and Rony decided to take over Madame Hooch’s classes. And Harry? He decided to turn into the teacher of the most cursed classes of Hogwarts.</p><p>Wasn’t fighting You-Know-Who himself enough, boy-who-lived? He just had to dare death and fate over again. Ginny glared a lot when he told her.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Two children played with an young teenager in a pretty and messy garden when the one wearing a skirt decided to tell hir cousins about hir new school. And the little boy's school as well. Terrence Allen was raised isolated from both muggles and wizards, so he never had the chance to really know much about the wizard world, when getting acclimated with humans and cities at all.</p><p>"So! Hogwarts is said to be really big! Papa Dell told me he went there, and there happened many things, like a war of the good and the evil, and where Harry Potter studied and works now! He's going to be our teacher!" Maybe Hariel should tell hir cousin why was Harry Potter so important. But neither him or Avery stopped the flurry of rare words coming from Hariel.</p><p>Hariel and Terrence hit off well since they first met, a few years before. Terrence had never met a little kid like him before, and Hariel was also autistic like him and his aunt Linda. It was all in family, and while each other got used to living together since Terrence's mom was terribly weak and fragilized after living years forcibly isolated and traumatized.</p><p>Though Linda was totally nonverbal, she helped raise her nephew and niece with warmth and kindness. Even though she was the monster's sister, but she suffered from the monster just like their mom, but in different ways until her wizard neighbor found a way to marry and take her away from the monster, in the same year Avery was born. Hariel was three months younger than Terrence, who was just freed when he was six years old.</p><p>Avery would mostly watch them, joining to talk sometimes, but she was still too shy, and remembered the most the cruelty she suffered her past life. She was terribly scared of men besides her family, and Terrence hoped that he just imagined the tremors when he hugged her.</p><p>"Is that so?" Avery instigated. She looked a lot with her younger brother. Green blueish eyes, everybody had a hard time telling and Terrence never loved looking at people's eyes. A fluffy dark brown hair, longer in Avery and much more floofier in Terrence, wavy and a few curls by the ends. In both, their skin was slightly tanned and full of ugly scars, but it had been getting clearer with time, slowly turning into lines of white and pink.</p><p>Hariel didn't follow the same formula as hir cousins. Ze was the copy of hir father, the polite and gentle traces from Linda, and at the moment a long flowing and brown hair, full of curls and waves, but much more curly than the siblings. Hir light brown eyes always looked droppy, what helped avoid eye contact sometimes. Ze still had the sickly white skin of hir mother, being always in the hospital hir first years of life. Avery was sincerely hoping that Hogwarts had some sun to bring color to the ashmatic kid.</p><p>"Yes! Harry Potter is super cool, he fought the Dark Lord and made him die many times! And everytime in weird places. Like in the basilisc place, and, and the bank! Can you imagine, killing a guy seven times or so?" The eleven years old child flapped hir hands strongly. Terrence flapped back to cheer hir on.</p><p>Terrence was hoping that the Magic School would be better. He didn't tell anyone, since it would just worry, but Hariel would flinch with quick movements, and despite the dresses and skirts, ze often hid hir body quite a lot, even in school, that already knew that ze was a nonbinary kid.</p><p>Basically, he was worried that someone in school was harrassing Hariel. So it was better to change. That way, he could also keep an eye.</p><p>"Are we going to stay together?" He asked. Hariel bit hir fingers.</p><p>"I don't know. It seems that Hogwarts have different houses. Papa said he was from the house Slytherin, a green room with merpeople on the windows. I'm not quite sure where i would like to go, or how they work."</p><p>"Houses?" Avery asked, "tell us more, Hari?" The kid flapped, happy to tell everything ze knew.</p><p>"So! So. Hogwarts has four houses. One of them is Griffindor, where Harry Potter went. They are all very brave there, and fight a lot, i heard the guy who funded the house was called Griffindor too, and he had a sword! In the middle of a bunch of wizards, he had a sword! That's so cool!" Ze giggled and flapped hir hands while jumping.</p><p>"A sword? Was he a knight?" Terrence asked.</p><p>"Nah, he was a wizar', but he lived in the age of knights, i guess. And then there's Slytherin, they are very determined in general. That's how papa married mama, because he was determined! And he helped her, and married her, and nobody could be mean to mama anymore!" Hariel crossed hir arms, nodding to hirself. "Yeah, nobody! I heard it was a Slytherin who saved you two and auntie. So they are good people! And they never give up, they are vey ambitious."</p><p>Avery smiled while Terrence and Hariel flapped excitedly at each other. "You think you gonna go to Slytherin?"</p><p>"I'm not sure. I'm not very ambitious. I'm a bit determined, however, in being the best cousin of all!" Terrence clapped. "Thank you, thank you! I shall do my best! There's Ravenclaw, they are people who value the smarts, kinda boring. Their house was founded by a woman, it seems?"</p><p>"Silly kid, smarts are also important. Though it sounds a bit weird, just smart people can enter?" The big sister didn't like how it felt quite ableist. When you are surrounded by autistic people that you love, it feels bad, since some have their humanity ignored.</p><p>"Yeah, it's boring! Dull! I don't like it, they looked stuck up when i saw people from Ravenclaw. I like Hufflepuff though. They are known for working hard, and being loyal and their symbol is a badger! A badger, Vry!" The two kids jumped excitedly, flapping harder. Avery had to agree that a badger sounded very fierce.</p><p>Was it a badger that she read once that broke snakes' heads? She just knew they were quite dangerous to mess with.</p><p>And it sounded like a good house for her little brother and her little cousin. They needed loyal people by their side.</p>
