    <p>Tina felt like shit. Honestly, there was no better way to put it. Her head was pounding like a drum and every move she made caused pain all throughout her body. She could tell by the small amount of light cascading into the room that it was early morning, meaning she would have to get up for work soon. Using the little amount of energy she had left, Tina swung her feet over the edge of the bed and moved to stand up.</p><p>Suddenly a rush of blood went from her brain all the way down her body, causing her to go light headed. The last thing she remembers before blacking out was calling out to Queenie and a hesitant knock on their front door.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Newt thought this had to be one of his worst plans yet. It seemed good in theory. But now that he was standing in front of the brown cobblestone apartment block in the middle of New York at three am, it didn’t seem quite as good.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was here so he could fulfill a promise. He just hoped the very woman he was here to see didn’t kill him for waking her up so early.</p><p>Remembering the odd Mrs. Esposito and her particular distaste in men on the premise, Newt cast a silencing charm on himself before apparating to the top stairs. He lost his balance on the landing but managed to keep himself upright by grabbing onto the railing.</p><p>His heart started beating faster. He hadn’t returned to America in over a year and he admittedly had been quite lax in replying to Tina.</p><p>Tina. Even her name made his brain hop into overdrive. His mind wandered to the photo of her that resided in the lid of his case, next to the best drawings of his beasts and his ticket from a recent travel. Would she mind that he had it? Should he take it off and hide it? Newt didn’t know what to do and he went into panic mode, second guessing why he was even here.</p><p>No. He had to do this. For once in his life, he would make the first move. Slowly raising his calloused knuckles, Newt tentatively knocked on the door but not before hearing a loud thud, followed by the hysteric crying of Queenie Goldstein.</p>
