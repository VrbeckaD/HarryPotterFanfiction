    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Hermione's heart was nearly beating out of her chest in excitement. She took a deep calming breath, willing her body to calm down but it was hopeless. She was too bloody excited.</p><p>After years of longing with no hope of actually achieving it, she was finally going to see it. She stared at the imposing ebony double doors for a moment before turning the ornate gold handle of the left and pushing it open. </p><p>She entered the room, took one look and sighed deeply with reverence. She couldn't believe she was actually here. She closed the door, leaned against it and smiled with the unbridled glee of a child looking at the exact gift they begged and pleaded their parents to get them for Christmas.</p><p>Through an act of nefariousness she hadn't employed since her days in Hogwarts, which was the creation and use of her own fairly potent brew of polyjuice potion, Hermione finally achieved the impossible. She was now standing in the famous Malfoy library and it was more beautiful than she could ever have imagined. </p><p>And it was all thanks to no other than Malfoy himself when he made a random announcement after the quarterly interdepartmental meeting at the ministry last month. For all who was present to hear, he told them about the beginning of a series of benefit galas that would be hosted at his manor every month. Each gala would be a fundraiser for a different organization in need in all areas of wizarding.</p><p>The organizations would benefit every marginalized wizarding group from various magical creatures, muggle borns and even squibs. Despite herself, Hermione was somewhat impressed. However, she had no doubt this was a ploy to help distance themselves furthur from the negative and dark stain their alliance with Voldemort had left on their family name. </p><p>It had been five years. Lucius was still in Azkaban and would be for the rest of his life. Ever since his sentencing, Malfoy and his mother participated in many acts of philanthropy throughout the years. She was never sure if it was because of a court ordered mandate for them to pay restitution, for the sole purpose of restoring themselves as a powerful family once again or a combination of both. The idea of their charity being genuine never crossed her mind. </p><p>They would have food, drink, and tours of the manor would be provided. All was welcomed to come he had said, looking directly at her before looking away. It was a natural move. He was in the process of sweeping everyone with his gaze. His gaze just happened to sweep over her as he stated the last part. She was sure there was no significance to it even though it was almost like he was directing that statement at her. An impossible notion, of course. She didn't even bother to consider it. </p><p>While their relationship, if one could call it that, was for the most part civil, aside from the snark and thinly veiled insults they would throw at each other when they happened upon each other in the hallways on rare occasions, they were not in the least bit friends. </p><p>She would even admit that the Malfoy she knew today had grown leagues away from the pointy faced twat he was in school. But still. He was <i>Malfoy</i>. </p><p>Even if all was welcomed, including muggle-borns like herself, she just couldn't seem to bring herself to go to his home, the place she was tortured, as Hermione. But she could go as someone else entirely. </p><p>Hence she concocted a plan to attend these parties without the heavy weight of her true identity. </p><p>She thought it was a good plan, albeit with some flaws. One being the appearance of an unknown witch mingling amongst a relatively small and close knit society of witches and wizards. The degree of separation between everyone in the wizarding world was not very large. Everyone knew someone who knew someone and so on. </p><p>However, if she kept to the plan to keep her mingling to a minimum and drew very little attention to herself, everything should go smoothly. At least that is what she told herself. </p><p>She managed to snatch a strand of hair off the jacket of a random woman in muggle London. An average looking woman that one wouldn't pay much heed to when lost in a crowd and picked a modest cut dress in muted colors to help in her attempts at blending in. </p><p>And here she was! </p><p>Finally in the place she only heard stories about and could only dream of someday seeing for herself. </p><p>She could nor would ever come out and just ask Malfoy if she may one day see his library, which was by far a more simple and much less duplicitous way of getting her wish aside from the fact that she occasional, though rarely, still had nightmares about his home. Aside from that, her asking such a request  would only give Malfoy even more ammunition for his sarcastic remarks that would undoubtedly target her bookworm tendencies and all around "swottiness". </p><p>Not only that, but she would have to ask Malfoy for a favor. Malfoy. </p><p>She refused.</p><p>So coming under false pretenses was of course, the only alternative. At least that was what she convinced herself. </p><p>She came out of her reverie to really look around herself. No time for ruminating. Now was the time to celebrate her victory. </p><p>She took a few steps in as if entering a church for the first time. She guess on some level it was. If she worshiped any god it would be the god of knowledge and their presence was all throughout the room. That tingly feeling she felt when she was about to see something new sprouted in her belly. </p><p>She smiled to herself. <i>The Church of Malfoy.</i> She giggled. Blasphemy. </p><p>She walked a few more steps taking it all in. The room was nearly four times the size of her entire flat with high vaulted ceilings allowing for there to be two levels complete with a spiral staircase. Every wall from ceiling to floor was lined with books save for a marble fireplace and curtained French doors that led to an outdoor area. </p><p>The ground level was tastefully decorated with opulent Persian rugs, plush leather couches, and lavish end tables topped with stain glass lamps reminiscent of Tiffany's. The fireplace was already crackling with a warm fire giving the room, despite its luxuriousness, a cozy air. She could not wait to curl up on a couch with a stack of books. </p><p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath and smiled serenely. Old leather and aged parchment. Two of her absolute favorite smells. She walked slowly to the nearest bookshelf, gently running her fingers over the spines, already seeing four books she would like to pull out. Where does one start when one finds paradise? </p><p>She decided to start where she was and work her way around the ground level shelves. She frowned. There was no way she was going to make it around even a quarter of the room with the limited time she had. </p><p>She pulled out a pocket watch from her clutch. She had managed to tweak her brew of polyjuice to last four hours rather than just the standard one hour that most potioneers capable of brewing the complicated potion could achieve. She had a little under three hours left. That wasn't enough time to get through one bookshelf knowing herself.</p><p>She frowned as she thought about what shaved her time down. </p><p>She hadn't paid much attention last time she was at the manor, what with the torture and terror and all. She hadn't really appreciated the sheer enormity that was the Malfoy residence. </p><p>The manor was a monstrosity of sitting rooms, parlours, dining rooms, drawing rooms, studies and ballrooms. And that was just one floor of one wing. Why should anyone need more than one ballroom, she'll never know. She hadn't anticipated the tour would take close to an hour. She would have to keep that in mind since she was planning to attend every gala as a different person. She would have to stay for the tour for newcomers each time she came. It would not only be rude if she didn't participate but would also draw attention to herself if she chose to forgo the tour when no one else did. </p><p>Her frown turned into a wry smile. Well, regardless of the the effort she'd have to put in to do it and the risk she would have to take, she will keep coming back until she got her fill. This was an opportunity she could not allow herself to squander. </p><p>And she will have plenty of chances. A benefit every month, he said. Just enough time to brew a new batch. And with the prospective frequency of brewing she was anticipating, she may even get closer to brewing the perfect batch that could last twelve hours. Winning on all sides really.</p><p>Merlin, she was ruminating again. She made it. First mission was a success and she had two hours and fifty minutes to get through as many books as possible. Best to get started. She lifted a hand to caress another beautifully bound book before focusing.</p><p>An hour and a half later, she was lamenting her lack of restraint as she only made it through two and a half bookshelves. She was in the middle of levitating ten books, cradling an eleventh in the crook of her arm as her fingers traced the spine of a twelfth wistfully, when a throat cleared behind her politely. </p><p>She whirled around with a squeak, her presently straight hair flying and whipping her in the face. The levitating books crashed to the floor due to her broken concentration, making her cringe. All of those books were over a hundred years old! She would have shot the intruder a look since it was partially his fault if she wasn't blinded by the unfamiliar hair clinging to her eyelashes and lipstick. </p><p>She combed them away as gracefully as she could as she tried to regain her composure before almost losing it again entirely when she realized who interrupted her. </p><p>Of course it was Draco Malfoy standing before her in all his regal, aristocratic glory, with his usual smirk firmly on his face. Things were going much too smoothly.</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, unsure of how to proceed. In all her planning she hadn't counted on being accosted by him.</p><p>He eyed her speculatively, his perfectly coiffed platinum blonde hair seemingly glowing in the muted light of the library. He wore an immaculately tailored muggle tuxedo which accented the lean lines of his body to perfection. She may not like him but even she could admit he was fit. There was neither a wrinkle in sight nor a hair out of place. He looked flawless, as always. </p><p>When she first saw him upon arrival she was shocked. She would never have thought he would lower himself to wear anything but the finest of wizarding robes. She begrudgingly admitted to herself that he looked quite dashing but he always looked dashing. The prat.</p><p>She blinked at him, waiting for the inevitable volley of insults and preparing her tongue for her retaliation before remembering she wasn't Hermione tonight. Tonight she was Elena Tuttleburg. An average height, somewhat slender, raven haired woman from Wales. </p><p>"Hello. I don't believe we've met," he said smoothly, his smirk widening into a charming grin. He held out his hand and she was once again blinking at him in confusion before realizing he wanted her to take it.</p><p>She tentatively placed her hand in his. She hadn't touched him since that satisfying right hook she gifted him in third year. His hands were warm and firm as he raised it to his lips slowly, his eyes holding hers as he gently kissed her knuckles. She felt her stomach muscles clench slightly as her body flushed with a soft heat. Her heart stuttered a few beats. She froze with shock for a moment before forcing her body to calm down lest he suspect something. </p><p>What was her body doing? This was <i>Malfoy</i>. The snarky, annoying, sarcastic git who tormented her in childhood, was a source of terror in her teenage years and irritated her in adulthood. How dare her body betray her is such a way?</p><p>She had witnessed his charm and how it affected women of all ages around the ministry many times. She never understood how they could fall for such a blatant act of persuasion. However, now that the charm was locked, loaded and pointed at her for the first time since she clapped eyes on him in their first year, she could see why it always worked for him. </p><p>She willed her body to pipe down before taking a calming breath and giving him a small, tight smile, bowing her head slightly. </p><p>"Ma-Mr.Malfoy. Hello to you too. My name is Elena. I hope you don't mind me taking you up on the invitation you gave us all during the tour to explore your lovely library," she greeted, using her best Welsh accent. </p><p>"Not at all. Typically people ignore my offer to enjoy my library. I'm pleased that someone was finally interested."</p><p>"Well, of course. Your library is practically famous. To be able to explore and enjoy it is an honor and pleasure," she said, trying to relax into the roll of Elena. It was rather difficult since Malfoy was studying her with an intensity that made her think she said something wrong. It took everything she had not to visibly squirm under his scrutiny. </p><p>His grin took on a devious slant, his eyes watching her carefully. "A book lover, I presume?" </p><p>"Why, yes. A bibliophile to the letter. I have a great passion for them."</p><p>He continued to pin her with his gaze. She felt a bead of sweat travel down her back. Just when she was beginning to formulate a plan of escape, his charming smile softened into a playful grin. </p><p>"I have no doubt of it. Although, you have already mistreated them," he stated, giving her a pointed look of admonishment, though his eyes twinkled in amusement. She looked at the ten books scattered haphazardly beside her and immediately levitated them back into the air, properly chagrined</p><p>He chuckled softly, the sound of it making her body react strangely. She frowned at her body's betrayal before glancing back at him. The amusement in his eyes bled into the rest of his face. </p><p>"That's quite a pile you've collected. Were you planning on staying all night?" </p><p>"What?" she asked rather sharply. His eyebrows rose, his grin sharpening. "No. Not at all. But I couldn't help but want to skim through them a bit before I take my leave." she corrected with what she hoped was a demure smile. </p><p>His eyes dipped to her mouth for a moment before returning to her eyes, his smile faltering for a fraction of a second before righting itself. </p><p>"Well, by all means, Ms...?" </p><p>"Tuttleburg." </p><p>"And where are you from Ms. Elena Tuttleburg?"</p><p>"Wales." </p><p>"Ah, I have family in Wales. Do you know of a Lyra Black? A cousin of sort of mine. She lives near Bangor. Fairly well known in that area, as I've been told."</p><p>"No, I don't believe I do, I'm afraid. I live in Cardiff. Clear across the country from Bangor." she answered, silently willing him to leave. She commended herself on memorizing the geographical layout of Wales in case a question such as his came up. </p><p>He studied her a moment longer then chuckled again as if laughing at a joke he wasn't going to share. </p><p>"Of course. Well I won't keep you. I can tell you are most anxious to get back to your light reading. Shall I summon a house elf to bring you some refreshmens?" he asked, his trademark smirk back in place. She fought to keep her face neutral. </p><p>"You weren't keeping me at all, Mr. Malfoy," she lied. "And refreshments will not be necessary. Thank you once again for allowing us such a privilege."</p><p>"Anytime, Ms. Tuttleburg. I hope to see you again this evening. Perhaps a dance later?"</p><p>"As you wish, Mr. Malfoy." she answered with absolutely no intention of going to the ballroom. He bowed to her and somehow made the polite gesture look sarcastic before making his way to the doors. He paused for a moment then looked back at her as if to say something but changed his mind, giving her a nod before exiting the room. She exhaled a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. </p><p>She felt like that was a close call even though he couldn't possibly have known who she really was. She checked her watch and huffed out a breath in frustration. Now she had little over an hour before the potion wore off. Leave it to Malfoy to nearly ruin her carefully made plans. And of course they would still enslave one magical creature while hosting a fundraiser for the emancipation of another. Typical. She almost respected him a little for his and his mothers endeavors. Silly of her to think it was anymore than a ploy. Slytherins through and through. </p><p>She levitated the stack of books over to a plush couch, sat down with one last frustrated huff and started reading voraciously. </p><p>An hour later, as she closed the last book she was able to skim through, which was only three out of the eleven she chosen. She scowled. Next time she would have to get to the library quicker if she wanted more time. Also, perhaps it would be a good idea to procure a hair from someone less likely to attract Malfoy's attention. Making a stronger batch that lasted at least six hours would help tremendously too. She cast a spell to return the books to their proper places wandlessly before reluctantly making her way to the beautifully carved doors. </p><p>She estimated she had about fifteen minutes before her true identity would be exposed for any and all to see. It was fortunate the library was close to the entrance. Knowing that was what led her to read until the very last minute. </p><p>She made her way quickly through the wide hallway that opened directly into a white marbled foyer. She had almost made her escape, the large front door in sight. Her hands were reaching for the crystal door handle when a mocking voice called out to her making her freeze in place.</p><p>"Leaving so soon? The party is in full swing now. Not to mention you promised me a dance." Malfoy's voice floated to her, the cavernous foyer bouncing his words around her. </p><p>She almost sighed aloud. She schooled her face and turned around, giving him what she hoped was a bright smile though it felt a bit tight. He emerged from a different hallway than the one she used, his hands in his pockets. </p><p>"My sincerest apologies, Mr. Malfoy. I lost track of time in the library and really must be going." she said, trying to inject a believable amount of regret in her words. </p><p>Draco merely smirked. </p><p>"I figured that would happen. You had eleven books to get through, after all. Tell me, were you able to get through them all."</p><p>"I'm sure you already know the answer to that," she answered sardonically. </p><p>"Then shall I expect to see you here for next months gala? To finish up your books, of course," he asked with that damned smirk.</p><p>She returned his smirk with one of her own. "Perhaps."</p><p>"I'll look forward to it. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Tuttleburg," he said, bowing his head to her. There was a tone in his voice she couldn't identify but she didn't have the time to analyze it. She had about eight minutes to get to the apparition point which was a brisk five minute walk if she left right this second. She opted to use that departure method rather than the floo so that no one could overhear her destination upon leaving nor trace where she goes. She was kind of regretted that decision. </p><p>She bowed her head politely before using every ounce of calmness she had left to not tear the door open and run. She stepped out and power walked as gracefully as she could off the grounds, not daring to look back. </p><p>As she reached the point, she couldn't help but turn around. She could make out Draco standing in front of his door, hands still in his pockets. Even from 200 yards away she could tell he was watching her. She apparated with a crack and was back in the living room of her flat. Just in time apparently, as she watched her long black hair return to its original honey brown frizzy state. She was off by two minutes.</p><p>Her heart was nearly beating out of her chest for a much different reason than a few hours before. The record breaking walk and the anxiousness Draco stirred in her in his foyer made her feel like she was having a mini heart attack. She exhaled a deep breath as she sunk into her sofa.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn't do that again. That was entirely too close to being a disaster. She shook her head. No. She just had to be more careful next time. Now that she has seen it, there was no way she would be able to stay away. At least not until she explored the ground floor a bit more. She could live without exploring the second floor. Maybe. </p><p>All she had to do was tighten up her plan. Making the potion last longer was a must. While she was at the library she read a passage that gave her a new theory. Perhaps if she harvested the fluxweed during the perigean full moon it may heighten the potency and thus the longevity of the potion. </p><p>The next one happened to be in two days. She could still have it done in a month if everything went as planned. She nodded to herself, in agreeance with her thoughts, looking a bit like a nutter sitting in her silent living room, nodding and shaking her head at her wall. </p><p>She didn't have to give up, she just had to do better is all. She got up to shower and change before she did a bit more research on fluxweed and its properties with the books she already had. </p><p>As she prepared her shower she thought about the glory that was the Malfoy library. It truly was beautiful. Never had she encountered so many books she either only ever heard of in references of other books or never heard of at all. It was heavenly. She couldn't wait to go back. </p><p>If I'm careful, nothing like that will happen again she thought to herself resolutely. Stick to the plan and everything should work out fine. By the time she closed her eyes to go to sleep hours later, she was nearly completely convinced that was true.</p><p>
