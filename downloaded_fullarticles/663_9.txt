    <p>I walk out with the others, Neville in front, as we see Voldemort and his death eaters walking towards us. I stand near the entrance behind some of the others as we wait for them to arrive. Voldemort walks at the front, his snake Nagini at his side. Behind him are all of his followers as well as Hagrid who is holding a still body in his arms.</p><p> </p><p>"Who is that? Hagrid's carrying?" Ginny Weasly asks stepping up next to Neville with her father. "Neville, who is it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Harry Potter..." Voldermort calls. "Is dead!" </p><p> </p><p>"No! No!" Ginny screams as I let out a small gasp. How will we win without Potter?</p><p> </p><p>"Silence!" Voldermort shouts letting out a wave of magic. "Stupid girl. Harry Potter is dead. From this day forth, you put your faith... in me." He turns to his followers and announces, "Harry Potter is dead!" making them cackle in delight. "And now is the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us..." He calls turning back to us. "Or die." Nobody moves.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco!" I turn to see my father motioning me to come over. "Draco!" he calls again when I don't move.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco..." my mother says from his side. "...come." I'm tempted, but this is where I belong.</p><p> </p><p>"No," I state. "I won't."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Betraying your family are you? So be it. You will die with the rest of them by a spell of my own making! Mors hostibus meis!" A spell the same color as the killing curse sweeps towards us in a wave. </p><p> </p><p>I see a blur of movement from the corner of my eye before someone grabs hold of me and a very familiar voice shouts, "hostibus defendat, et ad mortis meae." </p><p> </p><p>Voldemorts spell explodes out in every direction. I hear Voldermort cry out in shock as his own spell hits him sending him to the ground, dead. But the spell doesn't stop there, it continues to spread killing everyone it touches, light and dark. I get ready for death when it hits me, but instead, a warmth rushes through me. I don't stay distracted by it for long when I feel Potter starting to fall next to me. I quickly lean down to catch him and the next time I look up there isn't a single survivor. I look around all of the familiar faces, their eyes wide open in shock even in death until my eyes land on my parents. a tear rolls down my cheek and I can't breathe.</p><p> </p><p>I quickly look down when I hear a small voice rasp, "Draco." Potter looks pale and weak, but he's still alive.</p><p> </p><p>"Po... Potter... what did you do?"</p><p> </p><p>"His spell was only meant to kill his enemies... I changed it so it would spread to his side as well while protecting you."</p><p> </p><p>"Wh... Why me?"</p><p> </p><p>"I could only protect one person..."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, but why me?"</p><p> </p><p>"You're the only one who can save us all Draco."</p><p> </p><p>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sending you back with a few of my memories which will come to you when you need them... Goodbye Draco..."</p><p> </p><p>"Harry, what are you..."</p><p> </p><p>He cuts me off by chanting, "salvos nos remittite initium." The ground disappears from under me and I fall into darkness.</p>
