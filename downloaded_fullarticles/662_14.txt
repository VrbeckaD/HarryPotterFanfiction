    <p><u><strong>Prologue:</strong></u> “The best way of keeping a secret is to pretend there isn‘t one” —Margaret Atwood</p><p> </p><p>        The forest was more home to her than any structure had been. Of course, there were far off memories of a grandiose mansion and the elegant people inside of it, but she could hardly call that a home. Not when those people were the ones who threw her out into the wilderness in the first place. She thought of those people as nothing but cold phantoms, even though something inside her attempted to remind her that the pair in her memories weren’t just strangers. They were her mother and father. The two people who, supposedly, were supposed to love her unconditionally abandoned her because of her condition.</p><p>        Her condition? Having been bitten by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback as a young child, cursed to transform into a wolf at every full moon.</p><p>        She tried not to think about it much. It only brought her sorrow to do so, and that sorrow only slowed her down in a landscape where survival meant being quick and ever alert. Animals, other feral werewolves, and human hunters all posed a threat to her. Even with monstrous strength and human intellect on her side, she was near the bottom of the food chain. Perhaps in that sense her parents were right in their decision. She understood the importance of survival, and she had put them all in danger by being there...</p><p>        She’d made it thirteen years on her own, and was now a young woman is eighteen. It’d been a rocky journey from scared child to capable huntress, but she knew it was all for the best, even if she was worse for wear. Now, she could prowl in peace of mind, knowing she could at least give any rival a run for their money.</p><p>        And that exactly was why she wasn’t afraid when she heard the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs underfoot. Instead, she was ready for a fight if need be, and she had reason to believe it was a possibility; there was a rhythm of two steps and an out of place musk that smelled distinctly artificial, and that was enough to clue her in that the intruder was human. Not only that, but they were close. She was practically staring down the barrel of their gun. Assuming they had a gun. But, really, what would a human being doing at this hour except for hunting? So, she thought it safe to assume that this person did have a gun. Preparing to defend herself, she began stalking the area around which she heard the footsteps, careful to be light enough on her own feet as not to cause suspicion on the human’s end. She saw a wisp of blood red and a flash of black. This person made no attempt to hide. Either they were minding their own business, or they were confident in their own abilities. Somehow, the werewolf doubted it was the former.</p><p>        With a wave of defensive fury, she ran to leap at the human, successfully catching them off guard and tackling them to the ground. The figure underneath her wriggled, managing to get onto their back and look up at the one attacking them.</p><p>        The intruder was certainly male, but there was a moment of doubt on how human he really was. Almost matching his blood red hair that rested upon his shoulders, his eyes were an angry scarlet, even when they were filled to the brim with confusion. She’d never seen a human with such eyes... but then again, her experience in the world of men was limited, so perhaps this was simply rare.</p><p>        “Were you raised with any semblance of manners?” He growled indignantly, though she couldn’t help but think his growl sounded a bit more like a pup’s yapping. “I meant you no harm, you bloody idiot! What happened to asking one to state their intentions before you go to maul them?”</p><p>        Even with his words, she wasn’t about to let up. She was still wary about his intentions. “And give you a chance to put a gun to my head? Give you the upper hand in this encounter. Well, I’m not some dumb woodland creatures you can just shoot at without any fighting back. No, like this, I have the upper hand. And now you answer to me.”</p><p>        Perhaps she was reveling too much about being on top for once, as soon, the red-headed man took something out of a pocket and pointed it out her. A stick? “A Romanescu answers to no one. <em>Confundo!</em>”</p><p>        And just like that, the werewolf was knocked back, freeing the man trapped beneath her. He got up, pointing the stick— no, <em>wand</em> —back at her again. “Tell me who you are, wolf. And while you’re at it... tell me why you thought I was about to attack you.” Despite being near ordered to respond, her mind was in another place. Once again, she was focusing on his face, but now, she saw the shadow that painted his cheekbone. Even though he was trying to seem intimidating by waving his wand around, he really was just a pup. A hurt little pup, trying to keep himself safe. Maybe, just maybe, if he knew that she saw that, they could both leave unscathed and under a truce. Unsteadily, she got to her feet. It seemed the man got worried over this, as he brandished his wand further in her direction “Stay back! D-don’t take a step closer, mongrel! Just answer my question.”</p><p>        And now that she had her wits about her (or at least as close as they could be), she could answer him this time. “My name’s Lorelei. Other wolves call me Nifty, though. <em>This</em> is my hunting grounds. After so many times of having hunters attempt to shoot me while I’m minding my own business, I think I have the right to be quick to judge a human’s intentions when they’re wandering around here so late at night.” After a moment of glaring at him, she sighed and shook her head. “But you’re okay, now. I get why you’re here, and I know it has nothing to do with me. Sometimes you have to get away and lick your wounds. I understand. But I imagine it’s a bit more difficult for you.”</p><p>        The wand dropped, and his free hand wavered a moment before it gingerly touched the purpling skin. “That isn’t your concern.” Clearly, he was trying to be tough, but was more hurt than he let on. She wouldn’t press. This wasn’t her place, after all, even if it was eerily reminiscent of her own human life years and years ago. Crossing his arms over his chest, the boy looked around, desperate to take the awkward enough conversation away from him and his bruises. “My gods, who would want to live in some dirty old forest like this? Wouldn’t you rather live in a house or something a bit more civilized?”</p><p>        “You’re changing the subject and trying to get it away from you,” Nifty pointed out. That didn’t earn her much more than a sarcastic sneer in return. “But honestly? Maybe I would like living in a house better, but I don’t know. I haven’t since I was five, so I don’t remember much. My parents just dropped me here when I was a kid.”</p><p>        Somewhere behind red eyes there was a twinge of pity, or at least there seemed to be. Was Nifty imagining it, or was it really there? “Well, if you wish to know what living in a real home is like, rather than a cave... ...I suppose my parents wouldn’t mind if I took you in. It is nice to have a werewolf around.” She went to protest, both because of the unknown origin of his injury and his quick turnaround in opinion. “This isn’t kindness, Miss Lorelei. My parents are in need of redemption in the eyes of many, and I’m sure our leader would be most pleased with them acquiring the likes of you. I’ll let them take the credit of finding you.”</p><p>        The werewolf cringed, but at the same time, she wondered if being there would protect the little red pup. Even is she didn’t know him, and he was a bit of an asshole, she understood his plight. And who knew? Maybe he’d be better once she got to know him. “Sure. I’ll go with you.”</p><p>        “That wasn’t an offer, you know. That was an order,” the redhead grumbled, reaching out a pale hand to her. Nifty frowned before putting her calloused hand in his. There was no hesitation after that for him to start leading her away, acting more as if he was dragging her along than leading her by the hand.</p><p>        “So,” she said suddenly, causing her reluctant companion to turn to her with a confused and almost startled look. “What am I supposed to call you? You said you were a <em>Romanescu</em>, but I guess there’s going to be a few of those around if I’m going to your family.”</p><p>        Her question made him huff in frustration, but yet, he answered it. “My name is Rowan. My friends call me Ro, but since you are not my friend, I would ask you not to,” he said primly.</p><p>        “Noted. Rowan. Not Ro. If I call you Ro, then I did,” she responded, rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>        “Don’t laugh at me! I am in charge of you now, after all.”</p><p>        “Yes, Rowan, and I’m sure this will all work out <em>exactly</em> to your plan.”</p>
