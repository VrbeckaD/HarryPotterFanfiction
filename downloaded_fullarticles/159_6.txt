    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">June 31st</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was sunny, almost too sunny, said Ron who was already a bit sunburnt from playing quidditch in the back garden of the Burrow for the last two hours. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry liked it though, he felt warm in a way he hadn’t in the earlier months of the year. Comfortable in his skin which had been cracked and raw from the cold of the forest. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now he had moisture to his skin once again. Part of it was sweat from their outdoor games. But he also felt more youthful than he had in such a long time. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was free from all the pressure that had been placed in his shoulders at 11 years old. He never realized until now just how much it had weighed down on him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sure he was able to have fun in his youth, playing games with the other Gryffindors in the common room. Playing pranks on the Slytherins in the halls. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But at the same time, Harry knows that he didn’t have much of a childhood at all. The first 10 years of his life were filled with countless abuse from the Dursley’s and the only toys he got were immediately stolen or broken by Dudley. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The next 7 years were a lot better in some ways. He had two wonderful best friends. People who he really felt he could call his family. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But again, he didn’t have much time to be a child when he had to defeat a dark and powerful wizard who tried and almost succeeded to commit mass genocide. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And now at 18 years old Harry finally had time to be a kid. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry getcha head in the game mate, Yer girlfriend is killing us,” came from Ron, who was across the makeshift field they had blocked off with tree branches. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looked over to his girlfriend, Ginny, she had her hair pulled back into a ponytail, she was holding the quaffed in her hand and making her way towards their goalposts, which were also made out of sticks. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny was one of the best parts of Harry’s new life he thought. She was obviously beautiful, with long red hair and high cheekbones and plump lips. Any guy can see that. But she also had the way she held herself, like one of the guys. It didn’t make Harry feel so nervous and sweaty like how he was with Cho. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Better toughen up potter, or you’re gonna lose to a girl.” This time it was Ginny who had spoken, she had made her way to their goalposts and made a point while Harry had his little daydream. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I told you I’m a shite keeper.” Harry moaned. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, I wanted to try out being a seeker for a change so though luck.” Came from George. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">George has been through so much during the war, they all had, but George had lost an ear then a twin brother. Harry still blames himself for it all, not that he would ever admit to that, Hermione would throttle him if he did so much as hint at it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But he couldn’t help it. So many people had died, so many others were left orphaned or permanently injured. If Harry had just killed Voldemort earlier then none of this would have ever happened. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He let the people he cared about sacrifice themselves to keep him safe. Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, Tonks. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was hard for him not to think about any of them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sometimes when he has a cup of tea he wants to ask Sirius if he wants one as well. But he can’t. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Or when he sees his godson Teddy he wants to cry because he is so much like himself. His parents are dead and he will never get to know them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At least he has his grandmother Andromeda, as opposed to just Harry. Harry can’t imagine him being a very good father, with his only references to one were Vernon, who was an abusive twat, and Sirius. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He can imagine Sirius being a father. He just wished he could have grown up with him as opposed to the Dursley’s. But he didn’t, and he barely saw the man in person, so he doesn’t really have much of a reference there. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“All right, you’ve thoroughly destroyed us enough for today I think,” said Ron, just as molly yells for them to come inside. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry dismounts from his broom and is quickly greeted by Ginny, who loops her arm with his own. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What was up with you out there, you looked far away.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just thinking about going back to Hogwarts,” which was only a bit of a lie, but she didn’t want to hear the truth. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, I’m quite excited! Luna and I have been writing about going to Hogsmeade to check out the shops now that they’re being rebuilt.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That was another thing Harry was thinking about. How destroyed everything got in the crossfire, not just at Hogwarts but everywhere. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh and I get to be captain of the quidditch team, we’re definitely going to crush Slytherin this year!” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry wanted to be happy for her, but it all just felt so far away now. Quidditch, rivalries, those were things Harry had been a part of in the past, and he loved it. It was one of the few things that made him feel like a kid. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But now it feels like none of it really matters. Who cares if Slytherin beats us, at least we’re alive. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He still tries to put on a good face and listen to her, he does love her after all, and that’s what you do for those you love. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I just wish we could count on you being our seeker huh,” Ginny elbowed him in the ribs lightly, “But I get it Harry Potter is too good for us, you’ll probably be recruited into England’s team any day now.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughed at that,” I’m not so sure about that Ginn, I’m a bit out of practice.” Not to mention his loss of interest, but again she didn’t need to know that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I guess you’re right, you were shit today,” she laughed,” but it’s ok I’ll support you on the Harpies.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny wanted to be a professional quidditch player with the Holyhead Harpies. She was a brilliant player, Harry knew she could do it, probably would be the youngest player ever to join the team as well. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But you’ll be a hotshot Auror, so I guess we can support each other.” She kissed his cheek and ran upstairs to change. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That was another thing that stressed Harry out. Being an Auror was always his dream. But he’s already done a lot of catching the bad guys and to be honest he was quite done with it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But it was what everyone expected. Like Ginny being a quidditch player and Hermione being the minister of magic, it was bound to happen. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Harry just wasn’t so sure anymore. He was so tired. He loved to help people, but he doesn’t really want to have to hunt down death eaters anymore. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What other jobs could he even do though? He had basically based his entire Hogwarts life around being an Auror. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could be a healer, but he’s shit at potions. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He could be a professor, but he’s not so sure of how well he would be able to teach. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was stuck in a ditch and he couldn’t get out. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At least he had the rest of the year to figure some stuff out. Maybe at Hogwarts, he’ll get some sort of epiphany and realize his true calling in the world. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But for the moment he would just smile and put on like he was fine. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p>
