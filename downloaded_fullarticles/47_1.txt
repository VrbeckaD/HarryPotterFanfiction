    <p>Chaldea, 2015</p>
<p>The last bastion of humanity. The home base of the Chaldea Security Organization, whose mission is to prevent the extinction of humanity. For a time, humanity's future was assured for the next hundred years, until an unknown anomaly in the past changed everything; humanity would perish by 2016. In response, Chaldea devised a means to time-travel to prevent this disaster: Rayshifting. By going back in time and using powerful magecraft, a human can make contracts with the spirits of various historical figures called Heroic Spirits, becoming Master and Servant respectively to stop the end of humanity. Chaldea recruited 48 Master Candidates to fulfill that mission. Unfortunately, due to betrayal, all of the candidates were critically injured.</p>
<p>So how is it that the quest for human order is still underway?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to that question is this: there was one more Master Candidate in Chaldea than the 48 that had been invited. He appeared shortly before that fateful day, and to everyone's surprise, he became the Last Master of Chaldea.</p>
<p>What makes him so special? Well, first of all, he's a type of mage that no-one in Chaldea has ever seen before.</p>
<p>Second of all, despite his limitations, he manages to lead on the quest to humanity's future as good as anyone of the other candidates.</p>
<p>Third: he's only 8 years old.</p>

<p>
  <em>8:00 AM</em>
</p>
<p>"Harry, Harry, wake up."</p>
<p>A soft yawn was heard inside the large room. Blinking slowly, a pair of emerald-green eyes met warm blue ones.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, age 8, smiled with joy.</p>
<p>"Good morning Mama."</p>
<p>The owner of the female voice smiled as well.</p>
<p>"Good morning to you too. Do you want me to help you get ready for today?"</p>
<p>The little boy nodded eagerly and they both got up from the bed to start the day.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the two were walking hand-in-hand down the hallway. They passed by a few staff members who all said 'good morning Harry', with him replying each time. They soon reached another doorway, which opened up to reveal a room with medical equipment, and sitting in one of the chairs was the resident medical supervisor and acting Director of Chaldea, Dr. Romani Archaman. He looked up from the tablet he was writing on and greeted the two with a smile.</p>
<p>"Good morning you two. Here for your weekly check-up Harry?"</p>
<p>The child nodded and Romani gestured to the bed, to which Harry promptly climbed on. The doctor pulled a pen-shaped object from the pocket of his lab coat and pointed it at Harry, and a triangular blue light shone from its tip. He waved the object up and down, letting the light pass over the child's thin body. His eyes, which no longer had glasses thanks to some laser surgery - courtesy of Chaldea's advanced medical equipment - blinked whenever the light reached his face. A few repeats of that motion later, and the doctor put the object back and looked at his tablet.</p>
<p>"Did anything unusual happen this past week?" Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"No Dr. Roman."</p>
<p>"Any sudden pains or bleedings?"</p>
<p>"No Dr. Roman."</p>
<p>"Any nightmares?"</p>
<p>Harry's smile lessened a bit. "There was one..." he then looked at his mother who smiled at him. "but Mama was with me!"</p>
<p>The doctor smiled in appreciation. "That's very good Harry." He tapped a few times on his tablet and looked at the mother-son duo. "Why don't you go to the cafeteria and get started on breakfast? Mash is probably there and you know how much she likes spending time with you. I have to talk with your mother a bit."</p>
<p>The child master nodded before hopping from the bed and hugging his mother, who returned the gesture with a hug and kiss on the forehead.</p>
<p>"I'll save some food for you Mama!" he said. The woman smiled down at him and rubbed his black hair.</p>
<p>"Of course you will. I'll meet you there."</p>
<p>With those words, he exited the room and left the two adults alone. The doctor gestured to another empty seat, which the woman gladly took. Silence settled between the two as the doctor typed on his tablet. After a few minutes, the ponytailed man lifted his gaze to the beautiful female and his expression grew concerned.</p>
<p>"...what was it this time?"</p>
<p>The woman brushed her brown hair away from her eyes and fiddled with her dress, the red frills tangling in between her fingers.</p>
<p>"It was Fuyuki again; when the former Director was killed. Lev was laughing about how everything we did was pointless before he reached out to Harry and tried to..." her grip tightened on her dress as she spoke. "I woke him up, but he was so <em>scared,</em> Doctor. He cried on my shoulder until he fell asleep, and even then it took me coaxing him and promising him that I'll never leave him to even try getting him back to sleep again!"</p>
<p>Her voice started to crack at the end and it looked like she was about to cry, but she managed to take a deep breath and calm down. She continued speaking, but her voice was softer than before.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for that display, Doctor; it's just that I worry for him every day. A child shouldn't be even thinking of doing all of this, especially one with Harry's past. He should be going to school, having fun and making friends, but -" Here Romani cut her off.</p>
<p>"I know that, believe me, if anyone here had the option of being a Master, they would take it in a heartbeat to protect Harry. Unfortunately, this is not the case, so the best we can do is help him along every step of the way while trying to give him some semblance of a normal childhood."</p>
<p>The woman sniffed a little and nodded, her distress doing little to mar her beautiful features. "And as his mother, I'll be with him until the very end."</p>
<p>The doctor's expression brightened at her statement and put the tablet on his desk. "That's good to hear from you. Now, I believe you've kept your son waiting with your food. Knowing him, he's probably even tried to cook you a feast, so why don't you run along and we'll have another session next week."</p>
<p>The mother nodded and smiled, getting up from the chair. "Thank you as always, Doctor Roman. I'll see you soon."</p>
<p>With those words, Mata Hari left the medical center, with the thought of her son warming her heart.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At the cafeteria, little Harry was sitting alone in one of the tables, munching on a sinfully delicious English Breakfast, and another portion set aside for his mother. His little legs were dangling from the bench. The purple-haired Shielder known as Mash wasn't there, but he didn't mind; she probably had some work to do. So instead he thought about spending more time with his mother. His thoughts (and bacon) were interrupted by a soft 'clink' on the table and a pair of small arms hugging him from the side. He turned and smiled at the sight of perhaps his best friend in all of Chaldea. A short girl, only slightly older than him, wearing a black shirt and short pants, with hair as white as snow.</p>
<p>"Hello, Jack!" he exclaimed, greeting the girl. Jack, however, just pouted, her yellow eyes shimmering.</p>
<p>"You were supposed to wait for me so we could eat together." At her statement, Harry blushed, scratching his neck in embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Heh heh, sorry Jack. I just had to see Dr. Roman again and Mama told me to eat without her."</p>
<p>The little girl nodded with a soft 'ah'. She let go of him and dug into her own breakfast, the two children eating peacefully. As they both devoured their meals, people started coming into the cafeteria and eating as well and soon enough, the room was filled with the chatter and munches of the various Servants and staff.</p>
<p>The two children were munching on their meals when Harry let out a squeak of surprise as he was pulled into a strong hug from behind and felt a fist playfully digging into his head.</p>
<p>"Yo, Mini-Master!"</p>
<p>The Master in question looked up and smiled at one of the girls he had come to call an older sister.</p>
<p>"Hi Mordred, good morning!"</p>
<p>The infamous Knight of Treachery grinned, her small fangs showing. Meanwhile, Jack looked at the two, pouting again.</p>
<p>"Sooo, you got anything planned for today?"</p>
<p>"N-no, not really" he replied, wiggling in Mordred's hold. "I wanted to spend time with Mama and Jack" The blonde knight's grin grew in response.</p>
<p>"Well, you can do that at any time. Want to train with me? You still look like skin and bones, and I can't have a Master who gets blown away at a gust of wind, even if he is a shorty like you." Her gaze was drawn to the full tray of breakfast that the two children hadn't touched.</p>
<p>"Ooh, for me? You shouldn't have" she said in hunger as she reached out to grab the tray, but a purple knife poised to pierce her arm stopped her. She turned and saw Jack glaring at her.</p>
<p>"That's for Harry's mommy. Go take your own." Mordred simply kept grinning.</p>
<p>"Really? Then you won't mind..." she started to say as she put Harry down.</p>
<p>"...if I have a bite from YOURS!" she cried, trying to grab Jack's plate, only for the white-haired Assassin to push her arm away with the flat of her knife. The blonde Servant made several more jabs at the food at speeds that made blew back Harry's hair, but Jack blocked them each time. Mordred was about to make another jab, but she saw Jack's body tense and eyes darken, like a snake preparing to strike.</p>
<p><em>'...ehh, I'm not in the mood for a food fight' </em>she thought, lowering her arm and sitting next to Harry. "You win this time, She-Ripper. You're lucky I was just playing with you."</p>
<p>Jack dispelled her knife, though she still glared at the older girl. Mordred turned to Harry again, who had a slightly frazzled look at the small clash.</p>
<p>"So what do you think Mini-Master? Up for some sweatin' with your favorite big sis?" Harry rubbed his neck slightly, unsure of what to say. While he always liked spending time with Mordred, her methods of training were a little...wild.</p>
<p>"Um, I-"</p>
<p>"Yoo-hoo, Harry!" A familiar cry interrupted his thoughts and the three turned to see Mata Hari walk towards their table with a big smile on her face. She reached her adoptive son and gave him a warm hug.</p>
<p>"Hi, Mama! I saved you some food!" he said with a smile, pointing to the tray. Mata tightened the hug in response.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, Harry" she then turned her attention to the two females sitting next to her son.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Jack." she said to her fellow Assassin who smiled at the greeting.</p>
<p>"Good morning Miss Hari, I helped Harry protect your breakfast" she pointed to the knight, who muttered <em>'tattletale' </em>under her breath. "She tried to take it but I stopped her."</p>
<p>The Sunlit Dancer mock-frowned at the Saber-class. "Really Mordred, you know how Harry reacts to this kind of behavior. As his older sister, you should set an example for him."</p>
<p>Mordred leaned on the table with her elbow and waved her hand up and down. "Yeah yeah, I know, I was just messing with them. I wasn't really going to take your food."</p>
<p>"Really?" the older woman asked in a deadpan tone.</p>
<p>"...maybe one small bite" admitted Mordred sheepishly.</p>
<p>Mata let out a knowing chortle as she sat down, set Harry on her lap and pulled the tray towards her. She started eating the delicious food while her son simply leaned back and relished in her warmth. Jack, not wanting to feel left out, scooted next to the mother-son duo and slightly leaned on the former's side, careful not to tip her over. Mordred just kept watching them with a smile.</p>
<p>After finishing her meal, Mata Hari went to stand up and dispose of her tray when Harry spoke up. "Did you see Daddy on the way here?"</p>
<p>The dancer stopped and blinked, rubbing Harry's head "...no, honey."</p>
<p>"Oh." The green-eyed Master looked down at the ground and leaned further into his mouther's touch; said mother looked down at her little boy at smiled gently.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Harry, you know how your Daddy doesn't like crowds. He's probably in the library or in one of the lounges."</p>
<p>Harry nodded slightly before he perked up. "Should we bring him food? He's probably hungry."</p>
<p>"That's a great idea Harry, I'm sure he would very much appreciate it."</p>
<p>Mata then picked Harry up and left the table, with Mordred and Jack following her. They went to the cafeteria counter where a white-haired, tanned man stood behind and cooked. He turned at the sound of their footsteps and smiled.</p>
<p>"Hello Harry, Jack, Mordred, good morning Miss Hari," he said as he nodded at each one of the little group. "Can I get you anything Mordred? I know that the others ate." Mordred shook her head in response.</p>
<p>"Nah, we're just here to pick up some food for his old man" she replied, pointing at Harry. The Archer raised an eyebrow before sighing softly.</p>
<p>"Let me guess, he's out brooding somewhere?"</p>
<p>The silence between the two was the only answer. Regardless, the man shrugged and started packing a meal.</p>
<p>"I suppose he would like coffee as well?"</p>
<p>"Most likely."</p>
<p>"Hmm. I wonder if he ever actually joined you all for a meal. Even my father was never that cold."</p>
<p>Mata gave an exasperated look at him. "Emiya, you know that's just how he prefers to spend his time. He still cares very much for Harry, even if he doesn't show it all the time."</p>
<p>"Hmph" Emiya muttered, "More like doesn't show it at all..."</p>
<p>The brunette Assassin just shot a half-mock glare at him, rubbing Harry's back all the while. Emiya sighed again and handed her a box filled with food and a hot plastic cup filled with coffee. "I'm sorry if I seem rude, but I'm simply worried about Master's safety. I don't want him getting hurt any more than he already has."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, but don't worry; he would die all over again than even <em>think</em> of hurting Harry," Mata said, allowing Mordred to grab the items for her.</p>
<p>The tanned Archer had nothing else to say, so he shrugged. "Well, good luck with him and you all have a nice day."</p>
<p>"Thank you Mister Emiya," Harry said, which prompted a smile from the older man. His mother giggled at the sight and the group of four walked out of the cafeteria and through Chaldea's halls. They walked in silence for a while with Mata Hari trying to think of where <em>he</em> could be when Mordred spoke up.</p>
<p>"Say, Miss Dancer, do you mind if I take Harry out for some training today?"</p>
<p>The brunette dancer raised an eyebrow in suspicion at the blonde knight. While she knew Mordred cared for Harry like he was her brother in blood, she was also aware of her more...wild tendencies when it came to fighting and sparring, as she had seen with the other Servants. Obviously, she was concerned.</p>
<p>"Don't worry," Mordred said in reassurance "I'll be careful not to rough him up too much and besides, he could definitely use a little workout."</p>
<p>Mata just kept staring at her. They all kept walking, but a sliver of nervousness crawled up the Knight of Treachery's spine the more the stare lingered on her. Finally, Mata sighed and looked down at Harry.</p>
<p>"Harry dear, do you want to spend some time with Mordred?"</p>
<p>The young Master bit his lip in thought. He too was aware, even if less so, of Mordred's wild behavior in combat; and from the few times Mordred <em>did</em> train him, he always ended up falling asleep from exhaustion. But Mordred never hurt him <em>intentionally</em> and made sure to be very careful and gentle with him - as gentle as one can get in a spar.</p>
<p>Also, she was probably his favorite big sister. He loved spending time with her - just below his mother and Jack.</p>
<p>So having decided, he looked up to his mother and nodded. Mata Hari smiled back at him and nodded to Mordred before looking down at Jack.</p>
<p>"Jackie, would you go be with Harry when he trains with Mordred? I think it's best if someone else was there to keep an eye on him" she raised her head and looked at the knight. "You don't mind, do you?"</p>
<p>Mordred shrugged. "Eh, why not? It could help if Mini-master had someone his own size to train with him. Besides, it'll be more fun this way." She shot a fierce grin to the child Assassin. "You better not hold anything back on me, She-Ripper."</p>
<p>Jack responded with a glare of her own before looking up to Mata Hari and nodding. "Yes, I'll be with Harry"</p>
<p>"Good!" Mata chirped. "See Harry, you're gonna have some fun with Jackie and your big sis!"</p>
<p>Harry smiled and tightened his hold on his mother in response.</p>
<p>A minute later, the group finally stopped walking through the halls when they reached a door. Mata stepped forward and the doors opened to reveal a spacious lounge. It had beige-colored walls with large windows that displayed the sunny yet snowy landscape outside. Bookshelves lined the walls, housing books of all sizes and origins, and various objects and knick-knacks were placed upon the shelves. Two large couches and three comfortable armchairs were placed around a coffee table in a semicircle, all facing an ornate fireplace. Sitting in the middle of one of the couches and reading a book was a pale man, with yellow eyes and white hair. He wore a green shirt with white-rolled up sleeves, black pants, and leather shoes. His expression was calm and focus, not even twitching at the sound of the echoing footsteps.</p>
<p>The group silently stared at the man for a little while with mixed reactions. Jack's face remained expressionless, her visage betraying nothing. Mordred's eyebrow was twitching in irritation at the lack of response from the man. Mata Hari just looked at him and sighed softly, fully expecting to see him here.</p>
<p>And Harry?</p>
<p>He wiggled out of his mother's grasp and landed on the floor and gestured to Mordred to give him the food. He walked up to the couch where the man sat and climbed on it. The pale man made no motion to indicate that he had noticed Harry's presence at first, but soon he picked up on the scent of the coffee drifting throughout the room and looked at the child out of the corner of his eye. Harry noticed this and said:</p>
<p>"I saved you breakfast, Daddy."</p>
<p>The pale man kept looking at the child as before, his gaze meeting with his adoptive son's innocent, yet slightly pleading expression before sighing and putting down the book. He gently plucked the coffee from his hands and took a sip, eyes oh-so-briefly closing in appreciation of the coffee.</p>
<p>"This coffee...did Emiya make this?" Harry nodded.</p>
<p>"I see...this is good. Then again, he is very capable when it comes to food."</p>
<p>Mata Hari finally took this moment to chime in.</p>
<p>"Oh please Dantès, don't talk to him like he's trying to poison you. He was the one who asked to bring you food in the first place."</p>
<p>Edmond Dantès stared at the dancer, still holding the coffee. Sighing, he put the cup down on the coffee table before looking at his son.</p>
<p>"...Thank you, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes brightened and his face lit up with a smile. He shot a quick glance to Mata, who gestured to the child with her head. Sighing again - softer this time - the Avenger stretched his arm out and patted Harry on the head, who smiled even more and leaned into the touch.</p>
<p>The group all smiled before sitting down, Mordred and Jack each in an armchair and Mata on the couch with Harry and Dantès. Harry scooted over to the pale Servant, leaning into him. Dantès slightly rolled his eyes before placing his arm around Harry's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Dantès," asked Mata "I know you prefer being alone, but why do you rarely appear at meals? Harry gets upset when you don't show up."</p>
<p>The Count of Monte Cristo rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I do not mix very well with the other Servants, dancer; you know that."</p>
<p>"Still, you should at least try more often, at least for Harry; you know how much he looks up to you."</p>
<p>Dantès looked down at Harry, whose eyes were closed as he leaned into his father's touch. His gaze momentarily softened, but the group knew it would take a little more to try.</p>
<p>"If you're that uncomfortable about it" the busty Assassin suggested "think of it as a training exercise in self-control. Don't look for the servants, just be there for Harry. Besides, I'm sure you have common ground with some of them; you just need to dig around a little."</p>
<p>Dantès kept looking at his son/Master, his expression unreadable. He eventually sighed again before looking up at Mata. "Fine, I'll try."</p>
<p>"Wait!" she said, "Promise you'll be there at lunch!"</p>
<p>The Avenger's mouth was slightly open before closing it with a soft grumble. "Fine, I'll promise I'll join you for lunch." Mata Hari smiled and clapped her hands in joy. She then got up from her armchair and sat down next to the Avenger's free side. Dantès raised an eyebrow at the action, but the dancer kept smiling, seemingly content with where she was. Knowing it would be too bothersome to tell her to move, he kept sipping his coffee, while the others relaxed in their spots. Eventually, Mordred broke the silence.</p>
<p>"So Edgelord, I'm going to take Mini-Master out for some training today. Wanna come with us? I've been itching to fight you for a while."</p>
<p>Dantès raised an eyebrow at her query before turning to Jack. "Girl. You'll be there with those two, I assume?" Jack nodded, her expression unchanged. The Avenger hummed in thought before shrugging. He <em>did</em> need to stretch his legs a little, and he figured he should be there for extra backup in case Mordred got too wild on Harry.</p>
<p>"I suppose I could use the exercise. Just don't expect to win any time soon." Mordred let out a challenging grin in response.</p>
<p>"Hah! What are you gonna do? Shoot your little fireballs at me? I'll cut 'em all down!" Dantès scoffed at her remark.</p>
<p>"Hmph. You truly are as brash as they say, Knight of Treachery, if you even think you have a chance of taking me down."</p>
<p>As the two started to bicker, Mata Hari looked at her son, resting peacefully on his father's side, and her visage glowed with joy.</p>
<p>
  <em>"This is probably the strangest family that anyone here has ever seen, and I didn't expect anything like this when I was summoned but it's <strong>my</strong> family - <strong>our</strong> family. Harry might need to save humanity, but I'll be there with him every step of the way. All of us will be."</em>
