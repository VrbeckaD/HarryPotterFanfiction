Too scared to admit that I'm right, Susan?"</p><p>Susan scowled. "You're wrong, besides why would I be scared of a troll like you?"</p><p>Zacharias growled. "That's it, nobody and I mean nobody insults my appearance!"</p><p>He lunged towards Susan, but she dodged away.</p><p>Susan smirked. "Did nobody ever tell you that trolls look like models beside you, Zacharias?"</p><p>Zacharias muttered, "You don't want to keep insulting me."</p><p>Susan danced out of his reach again and replied, "Whatever, I couldn't care less about you." She hissed. "You're unbearable."</p><p>She stomped off to her dorm.</p><p>Zacharias shouted up the stairs, "Yeah, well you're unbearable too!"</p></div>
