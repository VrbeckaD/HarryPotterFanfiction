    <p>Hermione slumped down in her chair at the High Table and pulled the coffee pot towards her in one practised, fluid motion. 100 nights. If she could just get through 100 nights, then she could get through anything. After all, 100 nights was less than a year, so she <em>should </em>be fine ... if she kept telling herself that.</p><p>Severus didn't seem to think so though, he thought she should just cut and run, but she was better than that, right? She's given her word, and she'd stick to it. After all, she was over halfway through her tenure as Hogwarts interim Astronomy teacher, and she had given Minerva her word.</p><p>Severus smirked at her over his morning paper. "If you insist on continuing on with this madness, I shall support you, but I get to say, 'I told you so'."</p><p>"Shut it," Hermione whimpered, nursing what felt like her tenth cup of coffee that morning. She'd already inhaled all the coffee in her chambers, and she had no intention of stopping until she'd finished the pot at the High Table too.</p><p>"Really Hermione, why are you punishing yourself like this? You know if you just told Minerva you've taken on too much she'll understand. She loves you – all the teachers do."</p><p>Hermione ran a finger around the rim of the coffee mug, mulling over his words. He was right. She knew he was right, and he knew she knew he was right; she just didn't want to admit it. Admitting it would be tantamount to failure, and she was <em>not </em>a failure. She was one-third of the famed Golden Trio, war heroine, and a person that definitely needed more than 4 hours of sleep a night, but she would <em>not </em>fail.</p><p>Her musings were interrupted when the woman in question slide into the seat beside her.</p><p>"Late night Hermione?" Minerva asked tentatively and only received a quiet grunt in response. She raised her eyebrows at Severus, only to see the same expression mirrored on his face.</p><p>'Office Severus mouthed at her. Minerva nodded and decided it was best to leave the witch alone whilst she caffeinated herself into a coherent state.</p><hr/><p>"Severus, you're the closest thing she has to a friend on staff. Tell me, can she really handle it?" Minerva asked, worrying her hands. By an unspoken agreement, they'd walked up to the Headmistresses office together after breakfast, and Hermione hadn't even noticed. After Albus' death, and Severus refusal to return to the job, Minerva had taken the job as Headmistress. The first thing she had done was clear out all the moving trinkets, and bin the lemon drops – everyone knew they were laced with a subtle calming drought. The next thing she had done was to cover <em>everything </em>in tartan, and Hermione had gladly helped.</p><p>"Usually I'd say that it's not my place to say, but these past few weeks have been … difficult," Severus said, whilst examining the tartan throw on the back of his chair disdainfully.</p><p>"For her, or you," she asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>"Both of us. Hermione has withdrawn from me and closed herself off from all those around her. It's like she's got a single-minded focus for work at the moment, and anything else just isn't important."</p><p>Minerva reached into the desk drawer to her right and pulled out a bottle and two glasses.</p><p>"Really Headmistress, getting smashed at 9 am," Severus smirked and received a withering stare – one that <em>almost </em>rivalled his own in response.</p><p>She sighed, "I fear that I've asked too much of the wee lass, and I've not cared for her as I should."</p><p>That got Severus' attention, he sat up straight and fixed Minerva with a look. "You have exactly ten seconds to tell me what you mean Minerva."</p><p>Minerva pulled the glass stopper out of the bottle and poured them a measure of brandy each. After handing one glass to Severus, and taking a sip out of her own she took a deep breath, and continued, "I should have known something was up when she came to me asking if there was anything more she could do to help. I knew she was already doing a lot, and she seemed fine."</p><p>Severus hummed in agreement and took a sip of his own. The woman sure did know her brandy.</p><p>"But when her parents passed las year-"</p><p>Severus interrupted her, "Her parents passed?"</p><p>Minerva gave him a look and nodded slowly. "Yes, a little under 4 months ago. Didn't she tell you? I thought you knew. You seemed closer after she'd gone away."</p><p>Severus slumped in his chair, the liquid in his glass sloshing about. "She never mentioned it. I had noticed her withdraw slightly around that time but thought it was just the amount of work she'd taken on. How?"</p><p>"A car crash. As you know she never managed to fix their memory after the war, so they died not knowing they had a daughter." Minerva's voice clouded with emotion, and she sniffed to keep tears from falling. She couldn't imagine never knowing Hermione. "Since the war, she'd distanced herself from everyone outside of Hogwarts as you well know, but we'd become close. I treated her as kin, and yet I fear the only reason I know of the tragic event is that she required my permission to take a brief leave of absence. She fooled even me."</p><p>Severus swore under his breath. "She told me she was attending a conference but was rather evasive. I figured it was a romantic liaison and teased her mercilessly for weeks after she'd returned."</p><p>Minerva gave him a sad smile. "I remember, it was the only time she smiled."</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable under her gaze, Severus cleared his throat, and said, "So, she's working herself ragged to forget?"</p><p>"It seems like it. I tried getting her to relinquish the position a month ago – to let someone else take over, but I have a feeling she sabotaged everyone that we interviewed as when we sent them the contracts they were never returned, and Hermione had to stay on. I even offered to let Neville take over Head of House duties, but she started crying. I tried to assure her that I wasn't taking something else away from her, but the damage was done. She's been avoiding me."</p><p>Severus swore again. "I've been telling her to see you for months! I even told her this morning."</p><p>Minerva huffed, "I did hear. Every time I try to talk to her she tells me she's busy! I even tried to corner her with Filius, but she ran away – literally. Poor Filius thought he'd done something to offend her. "</p><p>The pair sat in silence, each contemplating Hermione's behaviour. Severus was silently berating himself – what kind of a friend was he? He hadn't even realised her parents had died! They'd become close friends over the past few years, as she was the only one on staff brave enough to withstand his cutting remarks (though they were milder after coffee), and patient enough to make friends with a Slytherin. She'd grown on him first with her persistence, and then eventually because she gave as good as she got during academic debates. She wasn't afraid to stand up to him, and whilst it was an utterly Gryffindor trait, he'd come to find it endearing. They'd been there for each other during some of their worst moments in recent history, so why hadn't she come to him?</p><p>Whilst Severus was berating himself Minerva was wondering where it had all gone so wrong. How had she let Hermione slip through the cracks these past few months? Why hadn't she tried harder to talk to her?</p><p>After enough time had passed that they were both in danger of missing their next classes, Severus cleared his throat, and asked, "What do we do Minerva?"</p><p>"Severus, I don't know what to do anymore. Ack, I've done all I can apart restraining the lass, and lecturing her – though I have been tempted." Minerva took a deep breath and looked at him. "I fear you might be the only one that can get through to her now."</p><hr/><p>"Don't give me that look Crooks," Hermione muttered as she paced backwards, and forwards in her chambers. She had been trying to solve a particular arithmancy equation for weeks, and she'd gotten nowhere. How could she, the resident expert on Arithmancy not be able to solve a simple equation!</p><p>Frustrated she threw herself onto her couch, and reached for her coffee mug, only to have Crooks bat it off the table at the last minute.</p><p>"Crooks!" Hermione yelled, "that was my last mug! The elves refuse to give me any more coffee after my morning mug nowadays. You fiend." She huffed, not really mad at her familiar. He was only doing what he thought best, and she knew her coffee consumption was ever so slightly high.</p><p>Truth be told, she'd never been much of a coffee person growing up, as a good cup of tea was her go-to comfort drink. That had all changed a few months ago when she'd found herself needing more energy to get through the day. But she didn't think about that. She didn't think about the past, only the future, only the next task, the next equation.</p><p>Right now, she had to think about how to appease Severus and Minerva. She wasn't completely oblivious, and she knew they worried about her, but what was she to do? She'd gotten herself into this mess, and she wasn't going to let anyone else clear it up but her. She'd teach Astronomy for another 100 nights, whilst juggling Arithmancy classes, being Gryffindor Head of House, and her own personal side projects, and then she'd have a break and deal with everything. After all, she hadn't scheduled a breakdown in her calendar. It would take far too long.</p>
