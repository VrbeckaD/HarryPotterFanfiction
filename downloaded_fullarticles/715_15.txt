  <b>November, Second Year</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really don’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>any</span>
  </em>
  <span> wizarding fairy tales?” Albus Potter said, looking between his two friends disbelievingly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know </span>
  <em>
    <span>Indian</span>
  </em>
  <span> wizarding fairytales,” Ekta said. She had been raised mostly in the muggle world, so her knowledge of wizardry came largely from her parents who had immigrated right before she was born. “You don’t even know Indian </span>
  <em>
    <span>muggle</span>
  </em>
  <span> fairy tales, so don’t talk to me about cultural ignorance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not my fault my dad was raised by white people and never got to hear those stories,” Albus muttered. “But anyway, I thought Susan came from a magical family.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Susan shrugged. “My parents hid all this stuff from me, remember?” Ekta had always wondered why anyone raised into magic would want to turn their back against all that and live a muggle life, but Susan had only said something about her dad being mostly muggle, whatever that meant, and refused to elaborate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You haven’t even heard of Beedle the Bard or anything?” Albus asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing means </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Ekta said. She shared an exasperated glance with Susan. Albus was only one year younger than them, but sometimes he could be a bit dense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right then,” Albus said, straightening his yellow and black striped tie with exaggerated formality. “I guess I’ll just have to introduce you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ekta rolled her eyes but shifted so she was curled up more comfortably in her chair. “I guess I don’t have anything better to do. What’s the most well known one?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well...” Albus hesitated. “I don’t know which one’s the most famous or anything, but my dad told me about Deathly Hallows the most often.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hallows?” Susan asked. “What does that mean? Like All Hallow’s Eve?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I dunno. It’s just a thing, I guess,” Albus said, waving one arm wildly around to demonstrate how much he didn’t know. “It doesn’t really matter. The story’s about these three brothers. The Perevells or something. I think my dad’s a descendent?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, they actually existed?” Ekta asked. In her experience, fairytales weren’t normally based off reality.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, obviously they didn’t do everything that happens in this story, but yeah,” Albus said. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>But anyway</span>
  </em>
  <span>, there were three brothers, and one day they came across a bridge over a dangerous river...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus described their meeting with Death and its consequences, and Ekta allowed him to do so with only a little bit of interruption every now and then whenever he said something that made zero sense. It was only after Albus was finished that Ekta realized Susan hadn’t said anything the whole time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Glancing over to her side, Ekta saw that Susan was frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Death isn’t really like that, you know,” Susan said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Ekta asked, raising an eyebrow. Susan had a habit of acting as if her opinions were the only correct ones, but starting an argument over fairytale figures was going a bit far, even for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” Susan said frustratedly. “Conniving and cruel. Trying to trick people into dying. He doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span> people to die. It just happens. Also he wouldn’t talk like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just a story!” Albus said. “It’s not like any of this is real!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know...” Ekta said. “Lysander Lovegood was telling me the other day about how the Deathly Hallows are real and that his granddad is trying to find them. I’d forgotten about that until now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, he’s Aunt Luna’s kid,” Albus said. “So it’s not like you can trust him on that kind of thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t say anything about Death, and I’m not saying that part’s real,” Ekta argued. “But maybe there were some really powerful wizards a thousand years ago who created some special items that really do exist. That’s not unbelievable. You already said that the brothers were real people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> part isn’t made up,” Albus butted in before she could add anything else to her argument, “Death is just a metaphor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true!” Susan exclaimed, loud enough that the rest of the Hufflepuff common room fell silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The three of them paused, awkwardly not looking at each other until the other people turned back to their conversations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s not,” Susan muttered, with all the petulance of a twelve year old.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose you’ll also tell me what the Easter Bunny’s really like too,” Albus sneered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s getting late, so I should head back to my own common room!” Ekta said, standing up from the chair to make her escape before things could worsen. She liked her friends, but they were both incredibly bad at backing down, and Ekta hated conflict. “See you tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her books and left Susan and Albus glaring at each other. She had made it halfway back to the Slytherin rooms when a guilty thought popped into her brain. Was Susan so defensive over Death’s characterization because her parents had died right before she came to Hogwarts, a little over a year ago? That seemed less ridiculous than Susan being stubborn for no reason. And less out of character. Normally Susan was more logical in her stubbornness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fighting off the uncomfortable feeling that maybe she should apologize, even though she hadn’t actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>said </span>
  </em>
  <span>anything against Susan, Ekta headed back to her room.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Did it really happen like in the stories? With the Deathly Hallows and everything?” Susan asked her grandfather at the first chance she got.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>WHAT STORIES? Death asked, his skull tilted slightly. I WAS NOT AWARE THERE WERE STORIES.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Susan briefly summarized what Albus had told her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>NO, IT WASN’T LIKE THAT, Death said. Susan smiled to herself, vindicated. THOSE ITEMS WERE ALL THEIR IDEAS. I MERELY HELPED THEM OUT.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did?” Susan asked. Death was not normally helpful to living people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>THEY SUMMONED ME WITH THE RITUAL OF ASHKENTE, Death explained. IT WASN’T ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Susan said. “Well, if you ever meet Albus, could you tell him I was right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WISH, Death said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is,” Susan said firmly.</span>
