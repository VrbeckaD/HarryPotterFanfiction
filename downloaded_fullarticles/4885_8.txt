    <p align="center"><strong>A Simple Mistake</strong><br/><strong>Part 1</strong><br/><b>&lt;3</b><br/><strong>_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_</strong><br/> The battle was gruesome, blood, death and ash everywhere. The loss was great, one Headmaster would say 'Their sacrifices were for the greater good', but we all guess that his sacrifice was the greatest on the journey the 'greater good'. The loss of the HeadMaster Albus Dumbledore was a punch in the face to wake the Golden Trio up. Their months on the run from snatchers, the torture, the starving, was all for the greater good. But what happens after you get to the greater good?<br/> It was the first day back to the re-built castle of Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione attempted a relationship but failed and simply stuck to being friends, Harry and Ginny were likely to get engaged sometime this year. Ron had Lavender Brown, while Hermione, as always; had books. After the Battle of Hogwarts, everyone was dealing with the loss of family, friends, lovers and well; everyone. Voldemort was gone, though some still lived in fear of the good amount of Death Eaters running loose like banshees in the jungle.<br/> Hermione decided to leave her parents in Australia for another year to be completely and utterly sure they were not in harms way once again. The wizarding world of Britain was still healing though. After months of contemplating and arguing with Ron and Harry. Hermione kept the horcrux's and encased them in glass. Since there was still power calmly radiating off of the horcrux's when they were incased. Hermione could not place unbreakable charms around them to ensure the safety of them. Months went by, eventually she forgot, when she had them placed in the case, the person who did it had magical gloves on protecting themselves. <br/> Almost all the Horcrux's were calmed down magically and had unbreakable charms protecting them, except one, Salazar Slytherin's Locket, the power radiating off of it is an abnormally large quantity. It worried Hermione, but perhaps the Locket had a larger part of Voldemort's soul in it. No one knew at the very moment. The ride to Hogwarts was not the same as the last years. Ron was drug off by Lavender, who was part werewolf now but her body had deep large scars. Ginny drug Harry off to the area with the Quiddich players leaving Hermione alone with her trunk in the normal cabin. <br/> Ever since Hermione got the Horcrux's encased she drug them everywhere with her. Hermione's beaded bag was fixed and re-charmed to be stronger, the Horcrux's were always at the bottom of her bag, if someone attempted to open the bag without Hermione's whole-hearted permission they would be stunned as if equivalent to a 'Stupfy'. <br/> There were so many first years this year, people were gladly bringing their children back to Hogwarts since Voldemort's fall. Hermione was elected Head Girl by Minevra, which the curly haired girl gladly accepted. Over the years, she filled out, Hermione's once bush on her head was now tamed into ringlets. The witch looked like a 12 year old boy until 3rd year when she was using the time turner, even after that she still looked young body wise. Her once plain figure was a hourglass figure, her bum and breasts had filled out quite nicely, now C cups; Hermione was proud of them in her own way.<br/> Since the Curly haired witch got her own room, she was rather excited; planning on leaving supper early, but that was halted. Everything was going fine at supper until Ginny and Lavender began shoving boys her direction with the help of Harry and Ron, all thinking she needed a man in her life to remove her from the fictional words of books she was always reading. <br/>"Will you stop it?! I do not need a boyfriend!" Hermione was fuming, everyone within a 10 ft radius could feel the petite witchs wrath. Lavender pipped up.<br/>"No we will not and Yes you do, stop getting your nickers in a twist and accept one of them. Get your nose out of your books for the love of merlin. Live alittle there is no need to keep your nose in them now, Voldemort-" Everyone who heard cringged at the word, everyone but the Golden Trio, Ginny and Lavender."is gone, your not studying 'how to kill the wizarding worlds most feard mass murder' so loosen up Herms!" At first Hermione could stand it, but then Lavender called her 'Herms' and the furious witch slammed her books shut and stormed from the Great Hall on her way up to the rooms.<br/> When she got there, she began unpacking everything in a frustrated hurry. Not giving any artifact any care. When she came across the Horcrux's she still didn't slow down. Placing them on shelves quickly. She pulled the last one out, Salazar Slytherin's locket, being the clumsy girl she always was. It slipped from her fingers shattering on the ground which only infuriated the witch more. Letting out a dangerous growl Hermione bent over and picked the locket up barehanded. That was all she had to do to ruin her life forever. <br/> Before Hermione had time to react she felt as if she was being sucked into a tube of apperation, but instead of landing in a area she landed in a dark grey void floating in and out of consciousness. The petite witch felt as if she had stayed there for day before being suck back through the tube. When she landed, Hermione hit her head on the cold ground underneath her now weak figure and was simply out like a muggle lightswitch. <br/> When the small witch woke up shivering and hearing something like hissing not far from where she was laying. Slowly she opened her brown chocolate eyes, the ceiling wasn't unfamiliar, thinking back she attempted to recognize it. Nothing came to her mind, it was all so fuzzy. Hermione began to move her eyes and head to look around. Looking to the left slowly her heart dropped, but not all the way. <br/> The small muggleborn witch was in the Chamber of Secrets, something was off. Slowly she pushed her small self up using her elbows. Groaning as her head throbbed in pain from the fall. Taking a second to glance around she finally realized what was missing. The Basilisk, the skeleton was missing, no where to be seeing. <br/> Something was wrong, oh SO wrong! Slowly Hermione began to stand up groaning in pain as she moved. Little did she know her groans came out in hisses as if a Snake. Glancing down at her non-school robes, they were not muggle, nore where they Gryffindor colors. They were what a pureblood Slytherin would wear on a daily basis. A long green slytherin colored dress that was embroidered with silver Snakes. Normally she would cringe, but after the war. Hermione changed.<br/> Not in a good way to some, if she was placed under the sorting hat once more, there was no doubt that even with her bright mind and bravery, she would be a Slytherin. Seeing the people you care about getting killed made you thirsty for revenge and revenge is what she got in the end. But revenge did not cure her need to sneak around, hex, jinx, and harm other people. Thankfully Hermione was still gripping her beaded bag when she arrived.<br/> The weak witch began to root around in her bag, finally she found her pocket full of potions, pulling out a pepper up potion and a small healing potion that healed any small cuts, bruises, and scraps. Downing both, Hermione was feeling better instantly. Getting off the cold ground she took a look around still wondering where the Basilisk skeleton went, nothing sat right with her.<br/> Hermione heard the sound of steps far down the walk way to the entrance. She was calmly standing up by the head of Salazar Slytherin. Grabbing her wand off the ground, her grip flexed against it, getting in a combat stance.Fianlly the door opened at the end of the long walk way. The water in the short depth canals that ran alongside the snake heads was making a small amount of noise. Once the door opened the person walking through froze and watched the witch from the distance in fury, rage, anger. Name it what you will, but the person was pissed. <br/> Slowly the figure came into the light, everything froze, Hermione's eyes wider then a bloody house elf's. In an authoritative tone the now clear figure spoke in english.<br/>"How did you get down here?! Who are you?!" Hermione closed her eyes trying to take a calming breath but the calming didn't come. Slowly opening them hoping the human was gone, but it stood their with the wand raised pointing at Hermione. Taking a second to realize this was all real, no one knew who she was or what her blood status was. She could be anyone to the people here. Taking her chances she spoke after clearing her throat and straightening her posture to what Narcissa Malfoy's looked like. When she spoke it seemed to come out english, but to the person now coming closer it wasn't.<br/>"Hermione Selwyn, and I happen to have no bloody clue as to how in Merlins name I ended up down here. Now, who are you?!" Hermione used her best pureblood tone that would have made a Malfoy proud, that wa saying alot, or atleast she thought she was using a pureblood tone. The figure tilted their head to the side looking at the petite witch infront of them. She had hate rolling off of her in waves as if they were waves in a tsunami. The figure responded using english seeing if the girl would notice.<br/>"Tom, Tom Riddle. Headboy at Hogwarts School of Witch Craft and Wizardy"<br/>Oh shit fuck. A mistake, a simple mistake fueled by anger will change the lives of thousands. Will it be for better? Or for worse?</p>
