    <p align="left"> Cassandra Jamie Potter was looking at the stars with her head tilted up. Even though it was a cold night as the wind in New-Mexico desert piped-up, it didn’t bother her. After spending half her life in Scotland, she was accustomed to the cold and she loved peace this place provided her. Her ‘tent’ was set up behind her and she was sitting outside on a chair, thinking about her life.</p><p>After Voldemort’s downfall, she thought she’ll have a relatively normal life, as much normal as a person could have after being through a war. They all had lost someone or the other, but even after that people picked themselves and continued with their lives. Ron and Hermione were married with their first baby on the way and even though it took longer for George to accept Fred’s death, he got married recently. Her godson, Teddy, was 7 now and was living with his grandmother, Andromeda Tonks nee Black. Neville was working as an auror and was also in America these days. The Death Eaters who escaped, came here to hide, so he was helping MACUSA with that. It was a good thing as he always forced her to meet him, every month or so, which was probably the only reason she wasn’t homesick. After living with the Dursley’s, she’d always wanted her own family. She couldn’t have it, no matter how much she wanted it. <em>But nothing in life had been easy on her now, had it?</em> She snorted at the thought.</p><p>The first time she noticed it, she’d been fairly surprised to see the face of a 17-year-old looking back at her from the mirror, even though she was 23. Ron always teased her about it, but she never paid much attention. The idea of not aging was ludicrous in itself, but when Hermione mentioned it, she couldn’t ignore it any longer. They searched but the reason Hermione came up with was ‘The Deathly Hallows’, which were locked in her Vault in Gringotts. The side-effects were too much to ignore and seeing everyone moving on with their lives, but her being stuck like this was too much to bear. So, she packed her bags and came to America. It’s been a year and even though she was in constant contact with everyone back home, she liked it much better travelling the world, alone, with no one to smack her about the reality in her face.</p><p>It had only been a month, when Dr. Jane Foster collided with her, on an empty street and spilled the coffee on her. The girl was one of the most intelligent people she has ever met, but she was uncoordinated and clumsy in a way, she had never seen anyone before. Jane introduced her to her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig and told her that she was an astrophysicist which piped her interest as she has always liked ‘Astronomy’ at Hogwarts. It was the start of a friendship.</p><p>She came back to herself when she felt the magic building-up. It didn’t take her long to realize that the magic was in the air as abruptly the wind changed and started whirling around, but it stopped just as abruptly.</p><p>She didn’t have time to think much as her phone buzzed in her pocket. It was Jane which was normal, as the girl was similar to Hermione and worked throughout the night.</p><p>She answered it, but before she could say anything Jane shouted at her that she’d hit a man and to meet her at the ‘lab’. She knew it would take some time for Jane to reach there, so she apparated there instantly as to not arise suspicion. She had the key, so she entered the place, sat on the sofa and waited.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>She looked up just in time to see Jane barreling through the door, with Darcy and Eric following behind her.</p><p>“Oh Cassy! Thank God you are here.” Jane almost shouted as she hugged her.</p><p>“Hello to you too.” She replied sarcastically.</p><p>Jane rolled her eyes, but whispered, “He came out of nowhere and I hit him with the van,” she pointed to the man still standing in the doorway, looking around as she continued, “I think either he hit his head or he’s crazy. Can you talk to him? I couldn’t think of anyone else…”</p><p>“So, you called me in the middle of the night.” She finished with a raised eyebrow and Jane looked at her sheepishly.</p><p>Cassy turned to look at the man and her eyes widened. She was 5 feet 7 inches, not short by any means but the man was huge, around 6’4. He had blonde hair which fell in waves around his shoulders and she envied him instantly for that. She had messy ebony mane, which she was never able to tame. He was handsome with muscled body and stormy blue eyes.</p><p>“Hello. Where did you come from?” She went near him and asked him slowly as someone would ask a child.</p><p>He looked at her, cocked his head to the side and said, “I’m the son of Odin and I came from Asgard.”</p><p>She looked at him confused. Wasn’t Asgard one of the nine realms? She remembered it from when she read about them once. It was also a possibility that Jane was right in her assessment, then they could take him to the hospital.</p><p>“What realm is this?” he asked looking at her.</p><p>She thought about it, trying to rack her brain for the answer and said, “Um… Midgard?”</p><p>Something akin to relief washed over the man’s face and he almost smiled at her. The way the man talked made her even more confused. How many muggles would ask about realms?</p><p>“I’m sorry, but may I know who you are?” Cassy asked.</p><p>“I am Thor Odinson, Prince of Asgard.” He answered with a charming smile.</p><p>“But Thor is the God of Thunder!” She looked at him with her mouth hanging open and whispered to herself.</p><p>His smile widened and his eyes shone brightly at that. “Finally, someone with suffice knowledge. You shall be helping me to find Mjölnir.” He ordered her and she scowled at him. Yes, he might be the prince, but she wasn’t going to take orders from him. Even though she wasn’t sure if he was telling the truth or not. If what he was claiming was real, then he could be very dangerous. She sensed no magic from him and he seemed like a muggle to her, well, apart from being extremely handsome.</p><p>She looked around and saw Jane looking at her with open mouth and wide-eyes, Darcy was sitting on the chair, looking like she just needed popcorn to munch on and Eric was staring from her to Thor with narrowed eyes. She couldn’t tell them, so she needed to take him out of here and then she would ask him, how and where exactly could he lose his hammer?</p><p>Cassy looked at them and said, “I am talking him to the hospital.” Then she looked at Thor and muttered, “You are coming with me.” And without another word, took his wrist and dragged him along, ignoring the spluttering of Jane and Darcy’s protests that ‘she’d met him first’.</p><p>If what he was saying was indeed true, then they could be in big trouble soon.</p><p>She needed to apparate, so she led him to an alley looking around to make sure no one was watching. She held his wrist tightly and saw him looking at her with narrow-eyes, but before he could open his mouth to say something, she apparated with him.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>She appeared somewhere in the desert with a loud crack and dropped her hold on his hand.</p><p>“What was that?” he grumbled breathlessly.</p><p>“Apparation. And sorry, I couldn’t risk anyone finding out…” she didn’t complete her sentence and stopped.</p><p>When he raised an eyebrow at her, she said, “My name is Cassandra Jamie Potter and before I can help you, I need to know if you are telling the truth.”</p><p>“I am the Prince of Asgard. I am speaking the truth and I am not here to deceive anyone.” His voice boomed suddenly and she winced.</p><p>“You are a stranger and I don’t know you. If you want me to help you find your hammer, then I need to look into your mind. I won’t look anything else, other than to see if you are telling the truth.” She explained calmly.</p><p> He frowned, but then nodded, “Do what you have to do, My Lady. My quest for Mjölnir is of utmost importance.”</p><p>She took out her elder wand, pointed it at him, her gaze connected to his and whispered, “Legilimens”.</p><p>She didn’t look deeper, but she didn’t need to. As soon as she entered in his mind, she saw several flashes. Him battling several creatures with red eyes and blue skin, an old man with a golden eyepatch and a strange helmet, banishing him from Asgard. She guessed it was his father, Odin, another man with black hair and green eyes standing there looking at both the men and pulled out of his mind.</p><p>“You can do magic? You are a witch?” he asked after he took a deep breath.</p><p>She tilted her head back and looked at him, “You know about the wizarding community on Midgard?”</p><p>“Yes. My father knew Merlin.” He shrugged and she spluttered.</p><p>She took a deep breath and said, “Alright. Let’s find your hammer.”</p><p>With that she waved her wand and muttered, “Point me Mjölnir.”</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>She had to apparate a few times, but they finally arrived at a place, where many men were working hastily. When she looked closely, she realized that they were government employees. She didn’t know how it was possible for them to know about any activity so soon, but she didn’t give much thought to it. Her mind was furiously working to find a single way to enter the place, without attracting much attention. After all, she didn’t want MACUSA involved.</p><p>She cast a disillusionment charm on both of them and told him to stay quiet while he retrieved his hammer so that no one would notice him. He went inside as she waited for him to come out.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>She had been waiting for an hour and now, she knew her charm was no longer working on him and was sure that he might have run into some trouble. She took out a paper from her handbag and charmed it to look like his identification card and some other papers, which showed that he had been through a head-injury sometime back with the name Fred Weasley on it. <em>They’ll have the time of their lives finding about a ‘Weasley’. </em></p><p>She went inside, claiming to be his friend and got him released from the custody, which was pretty easy in her opinion.</p><p>When she looked at him, he looked absolutely shattered, nothing like the lively man she had seen an hour ago. She asked about his hammer at which he gave her a pained grimace, but didn’t say anything.</p><p>She wanted to help him and so she cast a stronger disillusionment charm and apparated directly where his hammer was. When he looked at her with questioning eyes, she told him to get his hammer and that she would take care of everything else. She saw him trying again and again without success; without thinking she moved forward to help him and picked the hammer up and held it for him to take. She wasn’t paying attention but turned towards him when she heard him gasp and looking at her like she was an animal in the zoo and she frowned at him. When she looked where he was staring, she couldn’t hold back her own gasp and dropped the hammer which landed with a <em>thump</em>. She had read that no one apart from Thor could lift the Mjölnir, but she picked it without any effort.</p><p>He was still looking at her with wide-eyes and a frown marring his features when he asked with astonishment, “How were you able to pick it up? No one else had been able to do it.”</p><p>“I…don’t know. It felt as light as a feather, so I picked it up.” She whispered still shocked.</p><p>She could see that he wasn’t able to pick it up and now he looked even more desolate, but they had to leave now. Dropping the hammer was not such a great idea, as now it was clearly visible that it has moved from his place. Cassy took a deep breath, held his hand with one hand and the hammer with other, and apparated.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>Once they were out of there she apparated them to her ‘tent’. When she asked him to come inside, he refused in a small voice, saying that ‘the place was small and he wouldn’t want to disturb her more than he already had’. She rolled her eyes, even though she found his concern rather thoughtful. He finally agreed to come inside, when she told him that it was bigger on the inside.</p><p>It was one of the largest ‘tents’ she was able to find before she left London. It had 3 large bedrooms with attached bathrooms, a living room with a fireplace, a kitchenette along with a dining room. <em>Sometimes magic was a really wonderful thing.</em></p><p>Once inside, she could see that he was impressed, and settled himself on the sofa in the living room. She kept his hammer in the corner near him and winced when she saw his expression. He looked miserable and grief-stricken, and her heart broke at seeing him like this. He looked lost and she remembered the same expression seeing on George’s face when he lost Fred or when she used to look in the mirror after Sirius’s death. What had happened in the hour he was gone?</p><p>“You can talk about it if you feel like.” She told him as she sat next to him.</p><p>He didn’t say anything and kept looking into the fire. After a long tome he said, “My father is dead.” His voice echoed in the silence of the night and her head snapped to look at him, eyes-wide.</p><p>“He was already weak and my stubborn actions caused him unnecessary stress… He couldn’t handle it.”</p><p>He didn’t need him to say out loud, but she knew what crushing guilt felt like. He blamed himself for his father’s death, just like she blamed herself for Sirius’s. Their situations were so similar, yet so different. She didn’t know how to console him, when she was on the other side.</p><p>“I don’t know if it was you fault or not, but I know the what the guilt of a loved one’s death can do. My parents died when I was a child, so I don’t remember them much, but the only parent I had, my godfather, died because I was foolish. The pain never goes away and I can tell you that it never gets better, but you will learn to deal with it in time.” She said with a sad smile at which he nodded solemnly.</p><p>He spoke after a moment of silence.</p><p>“For the first time in my life, I have no idea what am I supposed to do!” he said with a tremor in his voice.</p><p>“We’ll figure it out and I’ll help you in finding a way to get you back home.” She told him earnestly at which he gave her a tight-lipped smile.</p><p>He was still far from alright, so she thought to leave him alone for the night.</p><p>She cleared her throat to gain his attention, once he looked at her, she showed him one of the rooms at which he nodded his thanks and she retired to her room as well.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>She woke up, with sunshine pouring through her window. She looked at time and realized it was almost midday. She picked her phone and saw many missed calls and voicemails, all from Jane. <em>Yeah, Jane was going to kill her, </em>she thought. She woke up with a groan, did her bathroom routine, took a shower before she went out. She was starving and she thought Thor might be too. She dropped a text to Jane, to meet her at their regular diner.</p><p>When she went outside, Thor was already there waiting for her.</p><p>He gave her a smile when he saw her. “My Lady Cassandra.” He greeted.</p><p>“Just Cassy is fine.” She told him and he nodded.</p><p>“Come on, let’s go. You must be starving.” She said.</p><p>“Famished.” He replied.</p><p>She apparated near the diner.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>Now, here they were. All four of them, staring disbelievingly at the man in front of them. After having toasts with eggs and bacon, pancakes, coffee and juice, he was still ‘<em>famished’</em>. So, Cassy ordered a plate of waffle, bagels, two more plates of eggs and bacon with toast and juice.</p><p>“Who’s going to pay?” Darcy whispered to her and Jane as they watched him in amazement.</p><p>Cassy’s lips twitched upwards. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay.”</p><p>All their eyes widened simultaneously, when he looked at Cassy and said, “This drink,” as he inspected the now empty cup of coffee, “I like it.”</p><p>“I know! Its great right?” Darcy said, while Jane looked at her and rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Another!” Thor exclaimed in his booming voice and smashed the cup to the ground, breaking it into tiny pieces and looked up at Cassy.</p><p>They all jumped and stared disbelievingly at Thor, along with every other customer and the waitress as well.</p><p>Cassy closed her eyes and sighed. She’ll have to pay for that too now, not that it would affect her with all the Potter and Black money she had inherited.</p><p>She looked at the owner and muttered, “Sorry Izzy. Little accident.”</p><p>While Jane hissed at Thor, “What was that?”</p><p>“It was delicious. I wanted another.” He answered with amusement.</p><p>She was turning red and Cassy was getting worried about her. “You could’ve said so.” She said with barely restrained anger.</p><p>“I just did.” He answered with a smile.</p><p>Cassy interrupted Jane, before she could bash something on his head, “Look… Thor. Ask nicely, the next time. No more smashing.” She emphasized on the words with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“I meant no disrespect. I won’t. You have my word.” He answered while looking at her with some unfathomable expression in his eyes. Then, he took her hand in his and kissed atop of it. Cassy was shocked into silence as she stared at him, while he smirked at her. Erik cleared his throat and she quickly snatched her hand from his as she blushed.</p><p>Jane was glaring at Thor, Darcy wiggled her eyebrows at her and Erik looked awkwardly between them.</p><p>She cleared her throat uncomfortably and muttered, “Alright.”</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>They settled into a routine after that. It’s been days since they found him, his hammer was still sitting in her living room. Even though Jane was suspicious, that there was something going on between them, she never said it out loud. Darcy, on the other hand, never missed a chance to make some innuendo towards her. He and Cassy spent the days in Jane’s lab and the nights outside her tent, talking. He told her all about himself, his brother and his parents and in return she told him about her life and the war, but she couldn’t muster enough courage to tell him about the Hallows. It was still difficult for him to talk about his father, but he was coping. Their <em>‘friendship’</em> became pronounced after that. As for Cassie, it was sufficing to say that she liked him. Who wouldn’t? He was a true gentleman and even though he never crossed any boundaries, he was always flirting with her in one way or the other, which never failed to make her blush; he cared about her and they spend all their time together, from the moment they woke up and before they went back to bed. And there was a small fact, that she’d never had been in a proper relationship before. Sure, there was a time after Voldemort’s death, when Draco and her had tried to give their relationship a chance, but it couldn’t be more. It was nothing more than a crush.</p><p>It had been a peaceful couple of days, but peace never lasted much longer in Cassy’s life.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>Jane was still working on the ‘wormhole’ and all five of them were on the site where he had crashed with Jane’s car, when a harsh, cold wind swept through the desert and the hair on the back of her neck stood up. She stiffened when she felt familiar magic crackling in the air surrounding her. Thor must have felt something as well because his brows furrowed and he looked around.</p><p>“No, no, no…” she unconsciously chanted out loud. How would she fight alone and keep four muggles safe at the same time? She didn’t notice until he was in front of her, cupping her face with both his hands and asking what it was? There was nothing but concern and alarm in his eyes. She didn’t have the time to panic and had to think fast.</p><p>“Cassy, what is it?” It was Erik, but she couldn’t reply.</p><p>“You need to leave now.” She told him. “Take them and leave. We don’t have much time.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving until you tell me what is it?” He asked firmly, his hands still holding her face.</p><p>“Death Eaters. The last two, which the Aurors weren’t able to catch. They will kill you without a second thought. Please leave.” She begged him.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let out a frustrated groan. Cassy took out the Elder Wand and sent her patronus to Neville and MACUSA. She needed help and soon. Then, she started casting the strongest shield charm she could muster, around the four of them.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Thor looked at her with panic filled gaze. She knew it wasn’t easy for him, standing there and watching someone else fight, but he was human. She couldn’t risk it, she wouldn’t lose him or anyone, who were in this situation because of her.</p><p>Once it was done, she looked at them and said, “You are safe inside the shield, but if something happens to me, it will vanish. I won’t be able to protect you then. I’m sorry.” She whispered</p><p>She heard a loud crack and turned around, to see Neville standing there and closed her eyes in relief. She didn’t think just jumped on him and hugged him tightly.</p><p>“No Cassandra. I am a warrior. I can help.” Thor shouted in a commanding voice.</p><p>She looked into Thor’s eyes and said, “He’s my friend. He’s here to help.”</p><p>She heard two loud cracks and whipped around with her wand in hand, Neville beside her.</p><p>Dolohov and Rowle were standing there, smirking at them.</p><p>“Potter. We have some unfinished business.” Dolohov said to her in a seductive manner and she cringed. Then he looked at Neville, “Didn’t think I’d meet you here, Longbottom. How’s mummy and daddy?” and they both laughed.</p><p>Cassy shared a look with Neville, before readying themselves for the battle and fired a ‘Stupefy’ and ‘Expelliarmus’ simultaneously at both of them.</p><p>Dolohov growled at her and threw a purple hex at her, the same hex he had hit Hermione with in Ministry of Magic all those years ago. She managed to cast a shield just in time. She didn’t know what was happening between Neville and Rowle, she could hear Thor roaring something at her, his shouts of “Heimdall” and “Father” were ringing in her ears, trying to break her shield, but she pushed it all aside or she would be dead.</p><p>She didn’t know how long it had been, she was getting tired and cursed herself for her laziness, when suddenly his Cruciatus Curse hit her. She wasn’t able to do anything to defend herself, but tried not to scream through the burning sensation in her skin. She had been hit before, but every time it seemed even more painful than the last. The pain stopped, but just as unexpectedly, began again before she had the time to move and this time she couldn’t stop the scream that left her. The pain was so intense, so consuming that she no longer knew where she was…or what was happening around her…hot-burning knifes were piercing every inch of her skin, it felt like her head was going to burst with pain.</p><p>She closed her eyes and focused on her friends, they would be slaughtered if she died, so she pushed the pain down and forced herself to stand. She wasn’t able to stand per se, but she was on her knees. The pain increased, but she looked straight at Dolohov who looked shocked at her. It all happened in slow motion after that. She saw him firing the Killing Curse at her and the green light, just as she shouted, “Avada Kedavra.” She could hear the shouts behind her, but she closed her eyes just as darkness swallowed her.</p><p> </p>
