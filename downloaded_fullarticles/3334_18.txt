    <p align="left">It’s the tenderness that held her gestures that he would miss the most, soft patterns that slowly but surely carved her name onto his heart.<br/><br/>Harry is not in love with Ginny though, he’s in love with his memories with her, soft kisses and cuddling at 4 am when the memories of the war <span class="hiddenGrammarError">were</span> drowned into their embrace.<br/><br/>There was no label to describe it, it was like dancing at the edge of a cliff flirting with the boundaries between friends and lovers.<br/><br/>They both needed a safe place, something uncomplicated after everything they had been through and if sometimes his heart soared at the mere sight of her Harry never let it show.<br/><br/>Ginny never asked for much because she never needed much from him, just for him to hold her through her lonely nights and kiss away her tears in times of need. Sure, Ginny had thought about a real relationship with Harry, but after all, they weren’t ready for such a thing after the trauma of these past few months.<br/><br/>Eventually, Ginny had to go back to Hogwarts and Harry had to enter his <span class="hiddenSpellError">Auror</span> training, they both grew apart, and kept going with their lives.<br/><br/>Eventually, Ginny fell in love with Luna <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lovegood</span>, the girl gave her unconditional love, respect and brought back joy in her life, a joy she hadn’t felt for a very long time.<br/><br/>Harry was taken aback when he heard the news from Ron and ignored his heart sinking in his stomach, it was only by coincidence that he reconnected with <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Patil</span> shortly after.<br/><br/>Over the years, Ginny and Harry tried to avoid each other, well, as much as possible since they shared so many friends and Harry was practically part of the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Weasley</span>’s family. Their conversations mostly consisted in small talk or in complaining about Ron and <span class="hiddenSpellError">Hemione</span>’s bickering that unfortunately only increased since they got together.<br/><br/>In 2003, Harry woke up next to <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> like he did every day for the last four years, her familiar floral perfume filled the room, as he was eating his breakfast an owl got in with a letter covered in Lilac ink.<br/><br/>Harry had a bad feeling about the letter but read it anyway.<br/><br/><strong><em>                                                               The <span class="hiddenSpellError">Weasley</span> and the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lovegood</span> families are proud to invite you to the wedding of</em></strong><br/><strong><em><span class="hiddenSpellError">                                                                                                   Ginevra</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Weasley</span> &amp; Luna <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lovegood</span></em></strong><br/><br/><strong><em><span class="hiddenGrammarError">                                                                                                      SATURDAY, MAY 3rd</span>, 2003</em></strong><br/><br/><strong><em>              A <span class="hiddenSpellError">portkey</span> will be sent to you if you’re attending the wedding, it will send you directly to the ceremony’s location so be careful to complete the RSVP carefully.</em></strong><br/><strong><em>                                                                 We’re looking forward to celebrating with you please send an owl ASAP!</em></strong><br/><br/>Harry felt his heart sinking in his stomach, his food long forgotten he stood frozen, letter in hand for ten whole minutes, it was like a wake up call, reminding him of what could have been if he had been honest with her and more importantly with himself.<br/><br/>As <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> woke up and joined him in the kitchen she found the letter and squealed : « By Merlin’s beard! I can’t believe those two are getting married! Knowing Luna this will be a one of a kind ceremony ».<br/><br/>Harry tried to smile but failed miserably. He felt awful for being such a horrible boyfriend to <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span>, still upset by Ginny moving on with her life.<br/><span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> was a lovely girl once you got used to all her giggling, she was simple yet knew what she wanted and wouldn’t mind letting you know.<br/><br/>« We’re obviously going right? » <span class="hiddenGrammarError">asked</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> frowning.<br/><br/>« Oh yes, the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Weasleys</span> are family to me as you know » said Harry refusing to meet her eyes.<br/><br/>And if <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> saw the <span class="hiddenSpellError">unshed</span> tears in her boyfriend’s eyes she chose to look the other way.<br/><br/><strong><span class="hiddenGrammarError">Saturday, May 3rd</span> 2003</strong><br/><br/>Ginny and Luna chose to do an outdoor wedding in a valley full of wild flowers, the ceremony was, as <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> predicted it, one of a kind, indeed many magical creatures were walking around the aisle, each one of them looking more peculiar than the other.<br/>Harry sat down at the second row, just behind the <span class="hiddenSpellError">Weasley</span> brothers, a seat next to George was left empty in a tribute to Fred who was still dearly missed by everyone, especially on these occasions. <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> was next to Harry, holding his hand a little tighter than usual, dressed in a pale pink cocktail looking as beautiful as ever, Harry thought he definitely didn’t deserve her.<br/><br/>A soft music began to play and <span class="hiddenSpellError">Xenophilius</span> <span class="hiddenSpellError">Lovegood</span> appeared, Luna at his arm as they walked down the aisle. Luna looked stunning, her long blonde locks were cascading down her back and a flower crown was on her head, her blue eyes were as dreamy as ever, and she moved as if she was walking on clouds. She wore a long <span class="hiddenSpellError">Boheme</span> wedding dress that had an open back and was covered in delicate lace.<br/><br/>But the worst was yet to come, indeed, a few minutes later Ginny appeared next to her father, her skin was sun kissed which made her freckles stand out, she wore a mermaid wedding dress that was simple yet very flattering, her light make up made her beauty even more obvious, Harry thought she looked heavenly, like she was an actual angel sent on earth to be his undoing.<br/><br/>The rest of the ceremony was a blur to Harry, he only remembered two words ringing in his head every time he closed his eyes: « I do » the words which would separate him from the girl he truly loved forever.<br/><br/>Harry tried to avoid the newlyweds for most of the night by dancing with <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> or by devastating the buffet every time he thought he might run into them.<br/>Unfortunately, <span class="hiddenSpellError">Parvati</span> was now in deep conversation with her sister <span class="hiddenSpellError">Padma</span> and <span class="hiddenSpellError">Hermione</span> while Ron was stuck dancing with Minerva McGonagall which would have been hilarious if Harry wasn’t so afraid to face Ginny at any moment.<br/><span class="hiddenGrammarError">As</span> if some entity had heard him he was face to face with the redhead girl. He now had no choice.<br/><br/>« Hi Gin! » He said in a high-pitched voice.</p>
