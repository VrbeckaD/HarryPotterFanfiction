    <p>Dear Harry,</p><p>Writing letters to you is weird. I guess I'll get used to it. I've included a letter packet for you to send on to everyone at home when you can. They pretty much all say the same thing: I got here fine, lots of love, Neville.</p><p>I'm all settled in at Master Tinaku's house. Well, not his house, actually. It's really different here. I can see why I was told not to bring too much with me. There's two big communal sleeping houses in the village, one for the extended family, and one for 'visitors'. (Which includes the entire Moutohora Macaws team, by the way.) Everything's very communal, and I feel extremely foreign. Auckland was more like home, but out here, I'm really, really white. I'm doing my best to learn all the rules and everything, but it's going to take me a while. At least everyone speaks English?</p><p>Someone goes to Whakatane at least once a week, and from there I can get letters delivered to the international post office in Wellington, so I'll be able to reply regularly, just slowly. </p><p>How are you?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Sorry this took so long. I sent your letters on to London straight away, and I thought I'd better wait for the reply and just add my letter to the packet. I guess now we know how long it takes between messages.</p><p>I know what you mean about feeling foreign. The houses aren't so different here, but the meals REALLY are, and I'm just...out of place. And even though people here speak English, it's usually something thet learned in school, and it's not so common for the older ones, so most conversations happen in Kannada. It's honestly easier to talk to people in Parseltongue, which is really weird for me.</p><p>Speaking of which, they assessed me when I got here, and it turns out I don't know shit about snakes. Like, they've decided the best way to educate me is to have me babysit the five year olds and learn from them.</p><p>Please cheer me up and tell me you've gone flying with the Macaws?</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>No, no flying with the Macaws, but maybe this will cheer you up: I've been informed that until I'm told otherwise, all I'm to work on is compost. Just. Compost.</p><p>It's been a week, and I think I may go mad.</p><p>There's always people around, at least. There's only about fifty people living here, but it's a very tightknit group. I don't quite understand the genealogies yet, but Master Tinaku is related to all the permanent residents. And the owner of the Macaws, that's why they're based here. They're sort of like a pureblood wizarding family? There's been a magic school here for a long time, except it's very different from how we think about magic and school.</p><p>It's making me realise what an honour it is to be accepted as a student here. I don't really know if I deserve it, but I'm grateful.</p><p>Even with the compost.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Alright, the compost thing is pretty bad.</p><p>The children are pretty fun, but I have no idea what to do with them. I don't think I've ever actually interacted with someone more than five years younger than me. Which seems a lot more weird now than it did a few months ago. One of the boys, Eshaan, caught me about to put my hand in a pot that ended up having a cobra in it, so he's now appointed himself my mongoose and is following me around everywhere to make sure I don't do anything terminally stupid.</p><p>I'm sending a request to Hermione for reading material with my next letter packet. </p><p>The wizards here are a bit more connected to the muggles, I think. Maybe because the Statute of Secrecy was a colonial thing? I haven't worked out the history yet. Which is making me aware, AGAIN, of just how terrible Binns was. The colonisation of India was two hundred years ago, it's not exactly recent! But no, goblin rebellions, goblin rebellions, and more goblin rebellions. Has anyone actually stuck it through to NEWTs in the last, I don't know, fifty years?</p><p>And Neville? Shut up about not deserving it, you're brilliant. </p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I got inspired by your letter and offered to spend some time with the kids. Seeing as that freed up someone else to go out in a boat, it was appreciated. I think they liked hearing about my brother who's learning to talk to snakes, although it was all a bit mysterious to them. Did you know that New Zealand doesn't HAVE any native snakes? The only reptiles are geckos, skinks, and tuatara. And the dragons, of course. And I suppose you get ashwinders here just like you can anywhere else. Still. Definitely no Maori Parselmouths. Maori doesn't even have the letter 's'. Bit difficult to hiss without that one, eh?</p><p>Well done deciding to ask Hermione. I commend your bravery. (And I do get the sense from her letters that she misses corralling us idiots and would enjoy a bit of recreational research.) I haven't actually touched a book since I got here. I brought a couple of reference texts, but they've been stuck in my trunk with my wand. (Master Tinaku thinks that if you can't grow plants without magic, you don't know how to grow them at all.) We have done theory, but it's all oral. He spends a few hours every afternoon telling me things, and then he quizzes me on it the next day. He's letting me take notes, but I can tell that the elders think I've got a terrible memory for needing them.</p><p>My compost seems to be passing muster, which, considering it was apparently introduced by the Europeans only a few hundred years ago, makes sense. Compost is compost, really. There's a cultural thing about using dung as fertiliser that I'm not sure I understand - there's this concept called tapu, and it applies to basically everything, sort of, and you don't want to mix one kind of tapu with another kind of tapu, and you also don't want to mix tapu with non-tapu, and as far as I can tell the end result is 'ask me first, and if in doubt, don't'. At least, that's the answer they give to the extremely non-Maori white boy from Britain. I'll just continue on with my no-dung compost until I get told I can do something else.</p><p>I feel like I've been learning a lot so far, and none of it about plants.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Hermione <em>did</em> send me a book - two, actually. The first one is apparently the standard British text on snake-handling for potioners and apothecaries. The second one is a muggle book for amateur snake breeders. I've been reading the kids excerpts, and they seem utterly stunned that I am NOT unique in my idiocy. The bit about snakes coiling around you not being a sign of affection really made an impression. I'm now extremely popular, because the kids have been dragging me all over the place to show off my silly books. I think it's endearing me to some of the adults a bit, because they seem a bit more tolerant of my stupid questions.</p><p>It's weird to think of there being NO snakes somewhere, especially when I'm surrounded by them here. There's so many different species, I can't keep them all straight in my head. Except for one that, as of this week, I am guaranteed to recognise. The Brahmani hulu havu (aka brahminy blindsnake, you've probably seen them before), which I have now been assigned to study. I've been given access to a tank of them, and I'm supposed to write a report on their anatomy, diet, behaviour, etc. This is complicated by the fact that a) they are TINY, b) they are nocturnal, and c) they live underground. I'm allowed to use Parseltongue, though, so I guess I'll be asking them as much as I can and hoping they'll answer me.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I guess we just don't really grow up around reptiles, do we? I've seen snakes while I've been gardening, of course, but there's only the adder that you have to worry about, and there's only a few others around at all. I just know that they like warmth and sunshine, but they hide under things when they can. So what, according to your mongoose and all the other kids, am I <em>supposed</em> to know?</p><p>I haven't actually seen that species of blindsnake, I don't think, but I do know the sort of thing you mean. They look exactly like earthworms if you're not paying attention, don't they? Did they end up having anything interesting to say?</p><p>I've been upgraded to weeding now. Master Tinaku pointed me at the vegetable garden and quizzed me on everything there, and I must have proved sufficiently educated. None of the plants are native, which is making me really suspicious, because we eat sweet potato pretty much every day. He's hiding them somewhere, but it's nowhere in the area around the marae (the main courtyard), and even though I've been here for more than a month, I'm still getting very strong hints that I shouldn't try to explore the island unaccompanied. They haven't told me why, but I've almost broken cultural rules enough times that I'm listening for now.</p><p>What about you? Have you had any opportunities to explore?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Yes, actually! Navaratri started this week (it's this big twice-a-year holiday thing for one of the really big goddesses) and Mysore (the city near us) has a big festival for it every year. I offered to stay at the school so they wouldn't have so much trouble with accommodation, since I'm not Hindu, but everyone insisted. There's an exhibition hall, and a whole lot of light shows, and apparently there's a big parade on the last day with elephants and everything. I've been warned that Diwali (kind of like Christmas, except not like Christmas at all) is coming up in a few weeks, so I'm taking advantage of the time off to do some gift shopping. Do you think I should order people things from home?</p><p>As for the snakes, here's what Eshaan says <em>everyone</em> knows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes are sleepy when they're cold, so they like warm places and warm things</li>
<li>But they also like hiding, so before you reach into anything (a pot, a shoe, a basket, a bush, a space under the house) you should look and see if there's a snake there</li>
<li>They can swallow things that are bigger than their head</li>
<li>They don't need to eat very often, especially when they eat big things</li>
<li>They're really really strong and flexible</li>
<li>Snakes smell with their tongues, which is why they flick them everywhere</li>
<li>They don't always bite with venom but if they do it can kill you so you have to be really careful and not make them want to bite you</li>
<li>Only really big snakes can eat humans, so you're most likely to get bitten because they're scared or mad</li>
<li>Keep still or move out of the way when you see a snake, especially if it looks mad</li>
<li>Watch where you walk so you don't accidentally step on a snake or a nest</li>
<li>You can still get bit with venom by a dead snake, and some snakes play dead, so you should be careful around 'dead' snakes just in case</li>
<li>If you get bitten, you need to hold still and yell for help and try to remember what snake it was</li>
<li>If a big constrictor starts wrapping around you, it's trying to figure out if you're too big to eat and you should get it off</li>
<li>Little snakes just wrap around you because you're warm</li>
</ul><p>So there you go. Some basic snake safety for you. As for the blind snakes, they aren't very social, and when they do talk, it's about ants and termites. I did find out they're all female, though. Not just the ones here, the whole species. How does that work?</p><p>Good luck with the vegetables.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>That sounds amazing! I've never seen an elephant in real life. You'll have to tell me about them. And as for the gifts, getting things from home would probably be better, unless you want to get anyone something particularly nice? How many people are you getting gifts for, anyway?</p><p>You can tell Eshaan that I feel very educated. (And newly terrified about gardening in India.) Please try not to get killed by any snakes before we go home. The all-female thing is weird, but I think I remember some insects being like that. In plants, it usually means the offspring is a copy of the parent plant. Do the babies tend to be very similar to the mothers?</p><p>I was right, by the way, there IS a secret sweet potato field. Secret, in the sense that no-one had shown it to me. Master Tinaku uses traditional planting methods there, although for convenience he does add fertiliser. </p><p>...it's possible I'm a little bored.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>You've never even seen one in a zoo? Even <em>I</em> saw an elephant in a zoo once, when I was ten. I don't know, they're huge and dignified and clever, and for the parade they were all dressed up with colourful cloths and things. I'm terrible at descriptions.</p><p>I should definitely give all the kids something, since I spend so much time of them, but just something small. And Pramesh and Jameel, my roommates, they should get something little too. I'm not sure who else I'm expected to give things to? Probably to Sri Naganoor, who runs the school, and Sri Byali, who's my official supervisor (he doesn't necessarily teach me anything; his job is to keep track of what lessons I should be taking), and Shrimati Jolad, who looks after everyone. Apparently sweets are pretty universally acceptable, so I will write home and ask someone to send me some. Chocolate frogs for the kids, do you think? And maybe Bertie Botts for Pramesh and Jameel. I feel weird about giving the adults the kind of thing we used to get off the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. Maybe your Gran will have some ideas?</p><p>You should tell Hermione you're bored, she'll send you an assignment. Or better, tell Ron - he'll send you something fun.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I've never been to a zoo, and now I really want to. Why do wizards isolate themselves so much in Britain? It seemed perfectly normal when I was growing up, but it's just weird to me now. There's so much out there in the world, why would we restrict ourselves to the wizarding bits? (And yes, you are really, really terrible at descriptions.)</p><p>Chocolate frogs for the kids and Bertie Botts for the room-mates sounds fine, but are you seriously going to ask Gran to pick out sweets for your teachers? Send Hermione a withdrawal note for Gringotts and ask her to buy some things for you from the sweet shop in Diagon Alley - you know she'll pick something nice, and she <em>actually has the time</em>. I don't know if you remember, but Gran's currently Chief Warlock? It keeps her a little busy.</p><p>And no, I won't be asking Hermione for an assignment. What I need is something to think about when I'm weeding that isn't practising my recitations for the afternoon. Weeding is <em>really</em> dull, and we hardly had to even think about it in the Hogwarts greenhouses. We were spoiled. No interference from birds, either.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>I took your advice and asked Hermione, not Aunt Augusta. Sent her a list and a note for six galleons and told her to buy herself whatever she wanted with any change. Hopefully I'll get them all in time.</p><p>I think I want to travel more, when I'm done with this. (When I'm done with this, I say, like I didn't <em>just</em> get approved to start actual classes.) In the muggle world, as well as the wizarding one. Maybe I'll tag along while you go learn from Herbology masters all over the place. What do you think?</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>Travel sounds great! I've been talking to Amanda (the equipment manager for the Macaws) about the wizarding community here, and it's really, really different. It makes me want to see how it's done everywhere else, you know? What classes are you taking now?</p><p>I actually need to talk to you about something a bit serious, I'm afraid. A little bit because of Gran, and a little bit because Hermione asked me to, but also because of me. So, here goes:</p><p>I know you hate the press. I know you really, really hate it. But public opinion matters a lot to the issues we decided we wanted to push, and the people who are working on them back home. And it's going to matter to you, too, when you eventually go back and start getting involved in things again. And, well...right now, there are people starting to think that you and I got shuffled off by a bunch of adults who wanted to take advantage of our positions to push their own agendas. It's rubbish, we both know it's rubbish, but I can see why it's a plausible theory to some people. So could you please talk to Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius and Gran about ways you can demonstrate your personal involvement? Things like the werewolf legislation reform that Uncle Sirius is pushing, people are going to just dismiss Uncle Remus supporting it as him taking advantage of your proxy. You've got to put your weight behind it as Lord Potter, and, yes, as the Boy-Who-Lived, and do it loudly. I'm sure they can set something up with Ms Shafiq instead of you having to talk to Skeeter or somebody. But think about it, please.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear that I wasn't very happy with your letter at first. But I've been thinking about it since I sent the letter packet off, and you're right. I looked back at the letters I've gotten from Hermione and Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius and Gran, and I can see what you mean. It's not just the werewolves, is it? It's the Azkaban thing, too. No one likes any of the options, and I kind of caused the problem and then buggered off. I'll write to Uncle Remus about it. Have you been writing to Mrs Cooper while you've been gone? I mean, I suppose you have, but about this kind of thing, not just updates on Wizengamot proceedings and what you think about them.</p><p>The classes I'm taking are the ones they offer to non-Parselmouth snake handlers, the kind of people who need snakeskin or venom for potions, or just want to keep snakes as pets. I'm actually enjoying them, now that I'm with other adults, even if it's a very basic course. We're starting off with some fairly old and placid snakes that are used to being handled, and the instructor keeps talking to them in class so they understand what's going on. Of course, by now the snakes have done this course plenty of times, and it takes a lot of work for me to keep a straight face when I can hear all their commentary. They're very sarcastic.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I mean, we've had long enough now to accept that we're going to pay prison guards, but I think a lot of people are still likely to push for harsher sentencing, even some kind of replacement for the dementors' effects. And yeah, as the person that destroyed them, people are going to want you to justify them being gone, even though they were horrible. Mrs Cooper had some interesting suggestions about penalties in muggle law and prisoners' rights and things, but I don't know if they'd be accepted.</p><p>On a happier note, how was Diwali?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>I thought Christmas decorations at Hogwarts were intense, but this trumps them. The entire school got cleaned, with all of us recruited to help, and there were decorations (especially all sorts of lamps and candles and other lights) put up <em>everywhere</em>. Shrimati Jolad made this incredible temporary mosaic kind of thing in the courtyard - all out of coloured flour, poured onto the ground in patterns. She must have done some kind of charm on it, too, because the pattern kept moving and changing. It was a multi-day festival (the holidays and festivals are a lot bigger here), and a lot of the students went home for it. The first day there was a big market in the village, and <em>everyone</em> went. Jameel managed to persuade me I should buy some jewellery, since compared to everyone else I am ridiculously unadorned, and it's a traditional day to buy it. So...I now own another chain to wear along with my portkey necklace, and a couple of rings. It feels weird to wear them. I got new clothes, too, since that's apparently required - just a long jacket and a fabric wrap thing that's normal clothing here. I figure I can wear it on special occasions when I want to fit it. Hopefully I don't look too silly. The next day everyone got up super early for various rituals and things, and that night there were fireworks. We had a mixture of magic and muggle, and it looked incredible. We did all the gifts on the day after that, and everyone seemed happy with the sweets I got them. (Yes, I'm going to thank Hermione in my letter to her.) And then today is supposed to be a day for brothers and sisters. (If I was a girl instead of a boy, I'd totally send you a coloured spot in the post, promise.)</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I <em>think</em> I have a date tomorrow! (Well, when I send this it'll be today, but close enough.) You know how I mentioned Amanda, who works for the Macaws? Master Tinaku gave me an assignment based on the maintenance of the quidditch pitch here, and she offered to walk there with me when the players weren't practicing so I could have a proper look. She said she always needed to check over everything between practices anyway, so she didn't mind. And at first I thought she was just being friendly? She's a bit older than me, and I've not exactly been looking my best lately or anything, especially when you compare me to all the athletes around, and she's nice, so I thought she was just being encouraging because I was getting frustrated about the pitch. But when we were talking about muggle stuff and I said I'd never been to a movie, she invited me to come with her to the cinema when we go on the weekly trip to Whakatane. That's a date, right?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Sounds like a date to me. How did it go? (And stop putting yourself down - I <em>definitely</em> overheard girls admiring you, particularly when you came back from the greenhouses and looked all messy. Some people like messy, and it's a good thing, or no one would put up with my hair. I'm thinking of growing it out more to see if that makes it behave.)</p><p>Pramesh has started his honours project for the end of his apprenticeship. I hadn't really thought about it much until now, but it's really kind of intimidating. We have to go out, find a snake that's got eggs or is pregnant (and we're supposed to choose the kind of snake specifically), and persuade her to let us have one of the little ones. And then we raise it from the egg, and look after it, and train it to accept handling and everything. Give venom if it's venomous. Help us work with other snakes, or tell us things about our environment. Get it used to magic. For the final exam, they don't actually talk to you at all, they just talk to your snake when you're not in the room and see how well you've trained it and what you've taught it and everything. Which, on the one hand, is very cool. But it's also a huge project, and there are so many ways to mess up. Pramesh is thinking about looking for one of the pit vipers, because they apparently get looked after by their mothers when they're babies, and that's supposed to make them easier to manage. Jameel keeps saying it would be smarter to go for something small, like a kukri, but then Pramesh just starts talking about pythons. I have no idea what I'd pick when it's my turn, but I guess that's what the rest of the apprenticeship's for.</p><p>Has Master Tinaku said anything about how the rest of your apprenticeship is going to go?</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>It was a date! We split off from David, who was running the main errands, and Amanda paid for the tickets and I bought popcorn and drinks and we saw a Disney movie called Mulan that was all drawings and it was amazing! Like portraits, but telling a story, and with all these fantastic songs! Amanda picked it out because she said everyone has to see a Disney movie, and since it was fantasy it wouldn't be so hard for me to understand. (I think she was right.) And she held my hand in the sad bits and then didn't let go and she kissed my cheek when I got enthusiastic about the movie afterwards and said I was sweet, and then when we were almost back to the boat she kissed me, well...a bit more thoroughly. And she said she'd like to do it again sometime soon.</p><p>I need more nice muggle clothes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'm adding this later - I wrote the first bit right after the date because I was excited, but I just got your letter packet. That snake project sounds really cool - they don't even examine you about theory or anything? I guess you'd want to pick something that's tolerant of cool weather, if you were going to take it back home with you. And maybe something that won't cause any deaths because British people are idiots about snakes. Other than that...I don't know, how are snakes useful?</p><p>Master Tinaku hasn't said anything, no. I think he enjoys frustrating me. This quidditch pitch assignment is certainly driving me mad. He gave me three days to study it, then took down his spells and put me in charge of maintaining the grass. Grass doesn't like to stay short, Harry. It really, really doesn't. And in a place like this, a wide open space like that ends up with all sorts of other plants colonising if I leave it alone for a few days. If there were sheep we could graze there it would solve the problem, but no-one keeps sheep on a quidditch pitch. I'm working on trying to replace Master Tinaku's spells, but in the meantime, I'm spending a lot of time just trimming the grass back so it stays okay for the Macaws. (At least Amanda keeps me company sometimes.)</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Congratulations! (And I've never seen a Disney movie either, though I know about them. Dudley thought they were too girly.) </p><p>That quidditch pitch project sounds awful - could you put some kind of ward so that other plants don't grow there? Find a ground-cover species that doesn't grow too high? I remember how much work it was to keep a small lawn neat and tidy; a quidditch pitch must be much worse, even with magic. </p><p>Things people use snakes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pest control (rodents, reptiles, frogs, birds, insects - it depends on the snake)</li>
<li>Looking cool</li>
<li>Threatening your enemies (especially the big pythons and boas and the famous venomous ones)</li>
<li>Attacking your enemies</li>
<li>Potions ingredients</li>
<li>Spying (most snakes can't be taught more than a little bit of human languages, but they can tell you what they saw and smelled)</li>
<li>Getting things from tricky locations - some burrow, some climb</li>
<li>You can train them to check your environment or food for poisons and things</li>
<li>With a LOT of training, they can learn to detect things with magic on them, and different kinds of magic a bit</li>
</ul><p>It varies. If I wanted to train a snake to give to you, I'd go for a burrowing rodent-eater, probably just a European grass snake. If you were a parselmouth, I'd give you something like the brahminy blind snake, that could look (well, smell and feel) around the roots of plants for you and tell you what was going on with them. Most people I know wouldn't do well with a snake - or if they kept one, there'd be no point training it for them, since they wouldn't use it to do anything fancy. I could give Professor Jacobi a venomous one trained to milking - that's something people learn to do here, because it reduces the chances of pissing the snake off and getting bitten. Other than potioners and apothecaries, the main non-parselmouths I can think of that would want a snake are people like the Malfoys. and they'd probably ask for a cobra or an adder just to scare people with. I wouldn't give one to them, though. I mean, if Draco asked for a snake, I <em>might</em> sell him a lookalike for something more dangerous. Or maybe a sunbeam snake, he'd like the iridescence. Depending on whether he could convince me he'd look after it properly. Most snakes really aren't suited to British weather. </p><p>And in answer to your other question, there's a theory exam before they let you do your final project.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>You know, for someone who knew nothing about snakes a few months ago, you know quite a lot now. Maybe you could donate one to the Slytherins one day - although I suppose the dungeons are pretty cold for a snake. Still, it would be an impressive gesture. Are you still in classes with the non-parselmouths?</p><p>It turns out I know more herbology theory than I thought I did? Hannah wrote me in the last letter packet about preparing some of her plants for the cold weather, and I was actually able to answer her questions and make suggestions and things. Considering I haven't touched my herbology books since July, I think that's pretty good, really.</p><p>Amanda and I are going to Whakatane together again this weekend. I mentioned needing more muggle clothes, and she said she should take me to an op shop and make me try on silly outfits and things. And then she said something about liking me just fine <em>without</em> muggle clothes, and we got distracted. (<em>Why</em> can I never think of anything to say when she does things like that? I just stand there blushing and stammering like an idiot!)</p><p>Speaking of girls, did Hermione write you about Ron? Now that he's getting the full wage instead of the probationary one, he wants to move out, except he can't afford to on his own, and Dean and Seamus have a room going, but Ron doesn't want to be a third wheel in the flat, so he asked Hermione. I think they'd all drive her mad, I really do. It's not that Dean and Seamus aren't good guys, but they're very...easy-going? Hermione's going to want to talk politics at the dinner table, and I don't think those three would. If she <em>did</em> want to move out (and I I'm not sure she does), I feel like she'd be better off staying with Padma Patil, or Susan Bones, or Anthony Goldstein - people who are really engaged with the kind of thing she's doing. Not that I'll tell her that, but maybe when we go home for Christmas? I don't know. What do you think?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>You can't be as bad as me. I am completely and utterly terrible with people who like me, and even worse when I like <em>them</em>. Annette in my snake-breeding class (yes, still with the non-parselmouths) flirted with me once and I went bright red. Thank god for the tan I'm getting, at least it didn't show much. And it sounds like Amanda doesn't mind you getting flustered, yeah?</p><p>I think you're right about Hermione. She and Ron get on really well, but they also drive each other mad? (Frankly, I think there's a fifty-fifty chance of actual explosions if they move in together.) And with you and me out of the country, they won't have anyone to complain at after their arguments. I can understand Ron's reasoning and all, but I don't think it'll end well. I don't know what to do about it, though.</p><p>I can't believe it's only a month until we go back for the holidays. I've really gotten used to Kalale. </p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>...we're going to have to do our Christmas shopping before we go back, aren't we? Merlin, I'd forgotten about it, but there are so many people I've got to give things to! I mean, you and Gran and Ron and Hermione, of course, and Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius and Mrs Weasley and Ginny and Hannah and Luna and Mrs Cooper and Aunt Minerva and Professor Sprout...and I've got to give something at <em>least</em> to Master Tinaku and Amanda over here. I don't think I can get away with sweets, either. Have I forgotten anyone, do you think? Do you have any ideas?</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>You're right, and thanks for reminding me. At least we've got a couple of days after we get back to handle the political things. (My floo is booked for the 21st, at 3pm London time. I'll meet you at the Ministry?) Books for Hermione obviously - you should ask Amanda what their textbooks were for magical history and theory and things, I'm sure Hermione will love to make the comparison. And you can get something from the Macaws for Ron. As for the others...I have no idea, and I'm terrible. What the hell do I get Aunt Augusta? </p><p>At least I don't have to do Christmas gifts for the people in Kalale, since we did Divali instead. Maybe I'll beg Jameel to take me around Mysore and help me shop. It's useful to have a translator sometimes, and also I'm terrible at haggling.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I've booked the floo for 6pm London time, (which is SEVEN IN THE MORNING here because of time zones). As for Gran, buying gifts for her is always terrible, but in your case, you should give her some item representing the Potter family and make a formal declaration of friendship. To her, obviously, not House Longbottom. Remus and Sirius you know better than I do, and Mrs Weasley...maybe you could ask Shrimati Jolad about local household charms and recipes and things? </p><p>I've decided that Master Tinaku would just find it presumptuous for me to give him anything to do with herbology, so I'm thinking maybe a bottle of firewhisky or something like that. I'm <em>really</em> not sure about Amanda. It's not like we're serious, you know? I don't want to make things awkward. But I can't <em>not</em> give her something. Flowers and sweets seem too small, jewellery seems too much...I'm probably going to have to beg Hermione for help. </p><p>I think I've figured out the quidditch pitch thing, by the way. I'm going to check on it for the next few days to make sure, and then I'll tell Master Tinaku and we'll see what happens.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>Thanks heaps for your advice, definitely get Master Tinaku alcohol, and as for Amanda, have you thought about giving her an enchanted flower? Or other plant? Or, I don't know, maybe you could make her some perfume or something. </p><p>Congratulations on the quidditch pitch. I've stumbled over another hole in my education: muggle biology has all this stuff about 'genetics' and inherited traits, and it's kind of important if you want to be a snake breeder but of course I have no clue. I'm following along a bit in class, but I need to do a <em>lot</em> of extra reading if I want to actually pass the topic. It really makes me wonder why we <em>didn't</em> study those things. I mean, genetics has to be useful for herbology too, right? Apparently the first genetic experiment was a guy messing around with peas.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>I'm not sure about your suggestion for Amanda, but it's a start. Certainly once I get home and have access to my potions things I can make hand cream and stuff for people. I mean Hannah and Luna and Mrs Weasley and Professor Sprout, not you or Ron, by the way. </p><p>Master Tinaku approved my work on the quidditch pitch, and took me for a bit of a walk around the island the other day. He said I'm doing well, and my patience is good and my memory is improving. (Which was fantastic to hear, because I still feel like a dunce when he quizzes me.) And then he said that he knows his teaching style is a little unorthodox, and can be frustrating, so I should use the Christmas break to reflect, and if I'd rather have a different teacher, he'll help me find someone. </p><p>It was really weird, Harry. Part of me wanted to say no right away, but he did say I should think about it. It was the first time I've really felt like I could talk to him about things, you know? He even teased me a little about Amanda, and I didn't know he even knew about that!</p><p>I think I need to talk to Professor Sprout when I get home.</p><p>Neville</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Neville,</p><p>I had sort of a similar moment, actually. I was talking to Annette about her plans, and apparently she'll be leaving soon. It's quite prestigious, being accredited as a Sheshanaga-trained snake breeder, and she's looking to expand her work with apothecaries. But she's not interested in a long course of study, just that accreditation, and she's not a parselmouth anyway. But it made me think. I told Sri Byali when I arrived that I wanted to do a full apprenticeship here. And I do like the idea of what that would mean: being able to handle snakes, to breed them, to maintain a habitat for them even in an unsuitable environment, to approach them and speak to them in the wild, to train them to do tasks. Listening to Pramesh talk about Baanitha since she's hatched...I want to be able to do that, and I could make it up as I go along, but that wouldn't be good for the snake and I don't want to mess up. But it could take years, you know? Do I really want to spend years here?</p><p>This is probably the last letter packet I'll get before we go home, so I'll talk to you on Monday.</p><p>Harry</p><p align="center">-----</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>Maybe you could talk to Aunt Minerva about it? Or Uncle Lupin, or Professor Martel. They all know you pretty well. I know what you mean. Especially when compared to Hogwarts, when it's exactly seven years and <em>everyone</em> does it, and in an apprenticeship it takes as long as the Master says and everyone teaches differently. And it's also just being a beginner again, when you've gotten used to knowing things. I can't believe I miss having textbooks, but I do. But...what would you be doing if you <em>weren't</em> studying at Sheshanaga?</p><p>(I ended up getting Amanda a pair of earrings. Hopefully she'll like them!)</p><p>See you Monday</p><p>Neville</p>
