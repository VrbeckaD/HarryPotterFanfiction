  <span>“Artemis Scamander, get down from there!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a phrase that he had heard so often, one could almost mistake it for his full name. His parents may as well introduce him to people as ‘Artemis Scamander Get-Down-From-There’. He didn’t like his name much as it was, so perhaps that would be an improvement. It would certainly be more amusing, and cause very few changes to the way his parents spoke to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now!” His father’s voice was growing louder, and Newt scowled as he dropped down out of the tree he had been climbing to face the man in front of him. Or, more accurately, to stand in front of the man and look down at his own shoes. Not out of shame or defiance, it simply felt right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you’re not allowed up there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He did know, which made the statement quite pointless. How was he meant to respond to that?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Artemis. Look at me when I’m talking to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t want to. It made him feel far too exposed, and if he was too focused on remembering to look, he sometimes forgot to listen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you listening to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Theseus doesn’t behave like this, does he?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was that a real question which adults get cross at you for ignoring, or one of those strange fake questions which adults get cross at you for answering?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Real question, then. “No, but-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No buts. Go inside, now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wished he knew how to explain himself, how to tell his father that he wasn’t trying to be disobedient, he’d just seen what looked like it could be a pixie and he’d simply had to climb up to get a better view, and his excitement had made him forget the rules, without anyone getting cross at him. But he didn’t. So, still scowling down at the floor, he trudged inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a bright side, however. Theseus was still out in the garden, which meant that his room would be deserted. Newt remembered that rule, no playing in his brother’s room unless Theseus told him it was okay, but he didn’t want to do anything that naughty. Theseus seemed to have so many clothes and toys that he didn’t even notice one or two going missing every now and then, and if he had ever got upset over the missing items, Newt would have returned them - or hidden them somewhere and let him think that he had misplaced them, so as not to cause suspicion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first time he had taken Theseus’ things, he hadn't thought he was doing anything wrong. His older brother had a wonderful new broomstick which Newt had desperately wanted to try out, and he wasn't even using it at the time. Why shouldn't Newt have taken it out into the garden to try and fly? And, upon discovering how uncomfortable skirts were when combined with a broomstick between his legs, why shouldn't he have pilfered something else to wear? And why, when he felt more alive and incredible than he had ever done before, had his father shouted and forced him to come down and act like a ‘proper lady’?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was another rule. Certain clothes and toys were only meant for boys, and Newt wasn’t a boy. Except that felt all wrong and Newt hated it. But even if his skirts and dresses had been equally practical, he still wouldn’t be particularly fond of them. He always felt like he was playing a bizarre game of dress up when he was forced into formal attire, and not one that was fun to play. His awkwardness seemed to be exacerbated by them, and he was certain he didn’t look like a proper girl, no matter what his mother said to the contrary. No matter how much or little effort had been put into making him look like a girl, he still felt like the odd one out among them, like he didn’t really belong there. They were all pretty and wore femininity like a second skin, but even when he copied them exactly, he still felt all wrong. In fact, the more feminine he looked, the worse the feeling became. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was that feeling that had caused his theft to become repeated. If it even counted as theft, when the clothes he was taking were all too small for Theseus anyway, and they would probably either have to be altered or thrown away if Newt hadn’t taken them. Yet it still filled him with guilt and shame, although whether that was because they were stolen or because he knew how much trouble he’d be in if he was caught breaking the rules like this, he didn’t know. But it was worth it, even if he only got to feel comfortable for a few minutes, alone in his room. It was odd really, how his parents wanted him to be like Theseus in every way except the ones which made him happiest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Locked away in his bedroom, Newt discarded his dress carelessly and pulled out some of his stolen clothes from their hiding place under his bed, tucked away inside an old pillowcase. They were a little too large for his slight form, but he still smiled when he saw himself in the mirror. His hair was not too long, having always refused to grow much past his shoulders, and if he pulled it back and stood just right, he could definitely be mistaken for a younger, smaller version of Theseus. The idea of that shouldn’t have made him happy, but it did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once he’d had his fill of pretending to be Theseus’ double, he laid down on the floor with his notepad and a quill and started to draw. He had only caught a little glance of the pixie, but he thought he had a good idea of what it had looked like. For good measure, he added a picture of a phoenix too, because even though he hadn’t seen one, they were much more exciting and he had seen pictures of them before, so he knew what they looked like too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had tried, just the other day, to talk to Theseus about phoenixes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And they can deliver letters like owls if you need them to, because they’re really good at finding people and are really loyal to their owners, and their tail feathers are so magical they can be used to make wands and their tears are really magical too, and they-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow… Artemis, will you go away now?” Theseus sighed. Did that tone mean that Theseus was bored? But how could he be? This was fascinating, surely he was at least a little bit interested?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Artemis, please. I’m busy. We can talk later, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was he? Newt hadn’t noticed. He never seemed to notice things like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he had wandered off, back to his bedroom, and decided to tell his teddy instead. Granted, Teddy couldn't reply or show any interest, but at least he wouldn't tell Newt to go away either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time, he decided to go straight to his more captive audience. Instead, he lined up his toys and sat cross-legged in front of them, holding his drawing up. “Pixies and phoenixes are both magical creatures that can fly, but they have lots of different abilities,” he began. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t uncommon for him to spend his time sat with his toys, providing them with a full-length lecture on whatever topic took his fancy - usually some type of magical creatures, but occasionally something else, for as long as his heart desired. They didn’t mind if he got too excited or talked for too long, or if he repeated himself at any point. They understood that some things were just so interesting, you simply had to say them more than once. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even his mother, who was generally more tolerant of his eccentricities, found that particular habit of his tiresome. Particularly when it was combined with his other habit of talking out of turn. But that wasn’t his fault, he just didn’t always know when he was supposed to talk and when he was supposed to be quiet. Particularly when guests were involved, and a whole new set of rules came into play depending on all sorts of factors which Newt didn’t get at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he finished his lecture, he moved to sit on his bed and look out the window wistfully, watching the hippogriffs in his mother’s paddock behind the house. They were beautiful, and he couldn’t wait to be old enough to be allowed to ride them. He had been introduced to each one under his mother’s careful supervision and had fallen in love instantly. They had seemed to like him too, even despite his horrendously executed curtsey, which both of his parents had given up on making him practice. Perhaps they too saw the similarities between themselves and the youngest Scamander. He was trained in a similar way, forced to act just as his mother wanted and not fully give into his own nature, punished when he got it wrong and occasionally rewarded if he did it particularly well. He thought he would rather be a hippogriff than a little girl, though. Hippogriffs were big and strong and could scare people off, and demanded some level of respect. Free hippogriffs could fly around as they pleased and never let anyone touch them if they didn’t want to. It seemed like such a wonderful life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that was not the life he had. He heard a bell ringing from downstairs, signalling that the house elves had finished preparing dinner, and reluctantly changed into fresh clothes. He would go downstairs and play the part he was supposed to play, and try his best to be the normal daughter that his parents wanted.</span>
