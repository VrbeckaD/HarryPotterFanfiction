    <p>It is hot.</p><p> </p><p>The sun shines mercilessly down from overhead and beneath the sun’s rays, his skin feels like it is cracking and peeling from the harsh heat. He hates the heat. He hates the glare that the sun causes. This close to the Capitol, in their district that is paved with white cement and every building was made of steel and glass, it is always hot and bright.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>There is silence as they wait. It’s stifling, in more ways than one. The heat presses against him like a body that is heavy upon his own. His white linen shirt is stiff with starch and sticking to his sweaty skin. He can smell the sweat on the bodies of the boys that stand beside him, in front of him, behind him. They’re nervous. He doesn’t know why. What is there to be nervous about?</p><p> </p><p>The silence continues. He wonders if he could get away with yelling. Or screaming. Or letting out a loud fart. The silence is killing him. All this waiting is boring and he grinds his teeth as the Reaper follows the Mayor from the Justice Building, pausing to the side to exchange a few last minute words.</p><p> </p><p>Raizen Vervain.</p><p> </p><p>The Reaper for District One is a short, fat man with bright red and blue hair and glittering golden eyes. His skin has been died a soft pastel green that makes him look sick, while his clothes are the brightest silver that shines even brighter beneath the sun than the highly polished windows of the steel and glass buildings around them. He has to squint his eyes in order to see anything and his eyes water and a slight ache sets up just behind his frontal lobe, centring just between his eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome!” Raizen exclaims loudly and joyously, “welcome! To the Fifty-First Hunger Games!”</p><p> </p><p>He smiles wolfishly as the Reaper gesticulates broadly, his arms wide and sweeping in his greeting. For District One is favoured beyond all. They are the bedazzlers, the providers of the luxury that all Capitol dwellers relied on. They are the providers of beautiful objects and clothing and the Capitol knows this. Without District One there was no fashion parade, no gold, no jewels, no glitzy, shiny things. District One, if it were to be distilled into a word, is: wealth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But such wealth is both a boon and a nightmare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>District One never lacks for food or entertainment, true; but they suffer the heaviest Peacekeeper presence aside from District Two, which provides security for the Capitol. With such a large presence of military and security, the people of District One had to be exceptionally careful about appearances. Specifically - appearances towards the Capitol, and their gratitude towards their apparent favour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Hot and heavy, the sun shone on his dark head. His overly-starched shirt collar rubbed uncomfortably against his neck. He was the only one entered into this years Hunger Games. He was expected to volunteer. He would do so to avoid the retribution of his peers.</p><p> </p><p>He’d lost the bet and he would pay it with his life. One way or the other.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome to the 51st Hunger Games!” The Reaper was a genteel man dressed in lime green and navy blue, one half of his face striated with gold paint, the other, swirled with red. He looked like a dogs breakfast. “May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favour!”</p><p> </p><p>The crowd clapped politely, some of the more loyal families letting out cheers. But no one forgot that this started the period of mourning. The other districts may well have claimed One to be the first of the Career Districts, teaching their children to fight and defend themselves. But that never stopped District One remembering that this was a day of pain, death and suffering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They would be loosing two of their own.</p><p> </p><p>“Let us start with the girls!” The Reaper announced cheerfully, swivelling his head to stare at the long line of 15 to 18 year olds, his yellow eyes anticipatory of their volunteering. District One was the favoured district, and with reason. They almost always won.</p><p> </p><p>“I Volunteer!” A girl, no older than sixteen stood firm, her eyes a glassy blue with long brown hair. The daughter of the 48th Hunger Games winner: Effie Snow.</p><p> </p><p>“Your name, dear?” The Reaper is pleased as punch that Effie has volunteered, his yellow eyes gloating and victorious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Effie Snow,” the girl replies. He knows, that like him, she’d been taken as a child and shoved into the School. Trained for this moment. A true tribute with no ties to the community. For District One, it was better this way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“And the boys?” Expectation was rampant, yellow eyes turned to him, staring like a hawk at a mouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He stepped forwards, “I volunteer as Tribute to the Capitol.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Overly formal, but it got the message across. He joined Effie on the platform, his eyes sweeping the crowd of townsfolk staring up at them. They were contrite, apologetic even. It didn't matter. In the end, one or both of them would die.</p><p> </p><p>“Your name, my boy?” The Reaper is immune to the solemnity of the moment, gleeful that he had the easiest and cushiest reaping gig.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Harkin Black.”</p>
