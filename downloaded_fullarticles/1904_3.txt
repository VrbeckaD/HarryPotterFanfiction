    <p>
  <span>There was one Starbucks in the little ski town. Sirius had, over the course of his fall semester, developed a love for the coffee chain, and so he found himself outside of the shop on his day off. His brother and his parents were still skiing, but Sirius had left the mountain early after taking a bad fall and deciding it wasn't worth hobbling around on the mountain anymore. Sirius loved skiing, but more importantly he loved the snow and sipping hot coffee while watching the snow fall down around him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His long hair was covered in little snowflakes by the time he got into the Starbucks, and he pulled his gloves off as he approached the line. It was much warmer in here than out there, and it smelled of coffee and peppermint. Sirius smiled to himself. This wasn't so bad after all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He noticed the barista while there were about three people ahead of him. Sirius had never seen someone so attractive in his life, and even though he was only seventeen, he was sure he'd never see anyone who could beat out this boy when it came to attractiveness. He was tall, with soft, golden brown curls falling into his eyes, and a scar that curled up against the side of his face. Sirius wondered what it would be like to run his fingers through the barista’s hair, and then quickly shook the thought from his mind. This guy was a stranger, working in a coffee shop miles from where Sirius actually lived. He had no chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was also the matter of Sirius’ gender. Sirius had only figured it out a couple of months ago, right in the middle of the fall semester. Before, he’d always considered himself a tomboy, and he’d only had one friend who was a girl. Lily Evans was a fierce, spunky kid and Sirius would have been into her if his best friend, James, hadn’t announced that he was in love with her when they were all twelve. Five years later, and James still hadn’t gotten the courage to ask Lily out. Lily liked James--somewhat--but Sirius wasn’t going to be the one to shove them in a closet and force them to talk about their feelings. He had enough on his own plate, between his family being a bunch of racist, homophobic assholes and him being transgender and somewhere along the bisexual spectrum. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Sirius was a cis guy, with soft, wavy black hair, he’d probably flirt with this barista. As it was, Sirius couldn’t do anything without the barista assuming he was a girl and not realising that Sirius’ feelings were of the gay variety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The line moved up. Sirius hadn’t decided on his order yet, and made a quick scan of the menu before deciding to get the same drink he always did. He and his friends (including James and Lily) had started going out to Starbucks on Fridays after school let out. Sirius hadn’t been able to go to most of the meet-ups in December, as he was out of school and his parents didn’t approve of any of his friends. James wasn’t white, and Lily, Peter, and Sev were all poor and therefore drains on society. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, what can I get you?” The barista’s voice was softer than Sirius had expected, but it still suited him. He looked tired, now that Sirius could see him up close, and there was another scar peeking out from under his collar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caramel Macchiato,” Sirius said after a moment. He tried to make his voice lower, but he was pretty sure he just sounded like he was choking on something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The barista nodded and pulled a cup out. He scrawled out Sirius’ order before setting the cup down and punching the order into the computer. He looked up at Sirius through his curls, and Sirius dropped his gaze to the boy's name badge for just a moment. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Remus</span>
  </em>
  <span>. An odd name, but it wasn't as though Sirius could judge him for it. Sirius had named himself after a </span>
  <em>
    <span>star</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He had no room to judge people's names now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...your name?” Remus asked, his voice trickling into Sirius’ thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked up from the barista’s name badge. “Oh, it's. It's Sirius.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A wave of anxiety washed over him. Sirius only ever used his name--his </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span> name--around his friends. He didn't even use it at their regular Starbucks, because sometimes Sirius’ younger brother would come in and Sirius couldn't risk outing himself over something as small as coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This felt different, though. Something in Sirius knew that this barista, in this Starbucks, wouldn’t expose Sirius. Regulus would never hear Sirius’ real name get called out, and Sirius would never accidentally show his cup to his parents. Sirius could be himself, say his real name to Remus, and things would be fine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius was a little melodramatic sometimes. James said it was a result of a traumatic childhood. Sirius said it was because he had to express his gay somehow, since he couldn't be gay at home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’ll be 4.75,” Remus said. He set the cup down on his other side, handing it over to the next employee. Sirius noted that his fingernails were painted a dark metallic grey. They were short, bitten down, and the paint was chipped in places. It was cute, really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked up from the barista’s hands and fished out his credit card. He handed it over and his fingers brushed Remus’. Sirius felt his face warm up, and he couldn’t bring himself to look the barista in the eyes again. Sirius wasn’t a nervous person, not really, but he never knew what to do around attractive people. He either made an ass of himself to try and impress them, or he tripped over himself trying not to be too much at once. There was no in between. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Sirius muttered as he put his card back in his wallet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No problem,” Remus said. A small, crooked smile crossed his face, and Sirius noted how his scar shifted when his mouth moved. He still wanted to reach across the counter and touch it. He didn’t. He dropped his gaze from Remus again and fiddled with his wallet. Remus tapped a button on the register. “Did you want your receipt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, I’m good,” Sirius said. He backed up from the counter and quickly walked down to where he’d pick his drink up. He could feel the barista’s eyes on him, though. Sirius tried to play it off as though he was cool and had his shit together. Sirius, of course, had never had his shit together. He was nervous, especially around cute guys. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He waited until his name was called (and it was fantastic to hear a stranger call out “Sirius!” and him be the one to respond), grabbed his coffee, and then found himself a table far away from the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t stop himself from watching the barista, though. Remus was the definition of a cute boy, and Sirius was smitten.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius cut his hair to his shoulders at the end of his first week back. James and Peter went with him to the salon, and the two of them busied themselves with the upscale fashion magazines while Sirius made small talk with the stylist. It wasn’t where he usually went to get his hair done. It was where James’ mom went, and so it was reasonable to assume that it was still a good place for Sirius to get his hair cut off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius didn’t want it all gone. He liked having hair that blew in the wind and made him look like a pretty punk boy. If he was cis, he could get away with being a pretty boy. As it was, Sirius had to keep choosing between relieving dysphoria and looking how he really wanted to look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The haircut was a good compromise. It was long enough that his parents probably wouldn’t yell at him, but short enough that he could pretend he was just a pretty guy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice flow,” James said when Sirius came back to him and Peter at the front. He reached out and tousled Sirius’ hair around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius ducked under James’ arm and hid behind Peter. “Don’t ruin it, asshole. I’ve got product in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s the first and last time you’ll ever have product in, Mr. Naturally thick and luscious hair,” Peter said, and shoved Sirius back into James’ range. Sirius simply flipped him off and dodged James again. It felt good to be back with his friends. He loved skiing, and being out in the mountains, but it was so lonely. His parents were never good company, and he and Regulus had been growing farther and farther apart the older they got. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you hear about Sev?” James asked as the three boys crunched through the snow to get back to James’ car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, what?” Sirius asked. “Did he finally crack and start using shampoo like I asked?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, dude,” Peter said, laughing. “He called Lily a cunt because she said she didn’t want to go to prom with him. Apparently going as friends this year wasn’t enough for our slithery ex-friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius rolled his eyes. Severus’ crush on Lily was as obvious as James’. The only difference was that Sev hadn’t learned the art of subtlety. Everyone in school knew he wanted to bang Lily Evans, whereas only Lily’s friends knew that James was into her. Sirius kicked a stray clump of snow. “At least he showed himself before we all got tickets together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now it’ll just be the four of us,” James said. He bumped his shoulder against Sirius’. “Unless you and Pete grab some dates, that is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius whipped his head up. “You asked Lily out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not yet,” James said. He looked nervous again, like he was thinking over how he was going to do it. “I don’t think I can ask her to prom, not after Sev. She’d say no on principle, and then I’d be fucked. We’ve got a year and a half of high school left, so I can’t screw it up now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you keep putting it off, you’ll both be in college before you even kiss her,” Pete said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James shook his head. “I won’t wait that long. I’ll… I’ll figure something out. I just need to wait, so that she doesn’t think I’m going to end up treating her the way Sev did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius nodded in agreement. Lily was smart, but she could be defensive sometimes when it came to boys. Lily was attractive, and if Sirius wasn’t so into guys, he’d appreciate her more. As it was, he understood that Lily was a gorgeous girl, with shoulder length auburn hair and flashing green eyes, and that whenever James finally got the balls to ask her out, he’d be in for one hell of an adventure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I still can’t believe he’d do that,” Peter said. They were at James’ car now. Pete moved around to the back, knowing that Sirius had called shotgun infinity the moment James had gotten the car for his sixteenth birthday. Peter pulled the door open and climbed in. “I mean, it’s Sev. We’ve known him for years. He’s not the type to say that kind of shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remember when he asked Lily and I if we wanted to hear the top ten sexist jokes last year?” Sirius asked from the front seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter shook his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When did that happen?” James asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you were sick that day,” Sirius said. He pulled down the mirror to look at his new hair and re-part it so that it looked carelessly tousled instead of James-tousled. “But it happened, and Lily nearly murdered him with looks alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James sighed. “I love her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter and Sirius rolled their eyes. “We know.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
