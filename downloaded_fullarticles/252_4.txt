    <p>Home is a continuous sequence of sounds. Jim pokes around in the attic - metal parts rattle, Mrs. Potter's slippers rub on the parquet and rings, clinking on a saucer, a ceramic filigree.</p><p><br/>
Family nest - a rotten dampness. As much as Sirius does try, everything drowns, becomes lost in the ringing silence. The walls absorb life and light, like a huge gray sponge. This house, he thinks, canâ€™t be saves by anything, like wet wood will not catch fire from the matches thrown at it.</p><p><br/>
Sirius Black is a match.</p><p><br/>
All his life - a swamp.</p><p><br/>
He, of course, tries to scream there, underwater, but as a result almost chokes. So helplessly lurk in the puddles only cockroaches.</p><p><br/>
And as he sinks, falls and fades away, it feels like an eternity.</p>
