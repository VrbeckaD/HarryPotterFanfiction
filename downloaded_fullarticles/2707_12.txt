    <p>
  <span>Evangeline, Adaline and Severus had determined that tonight would be the night Voldemort attacked the Potters. Evangeline and Severus were currently hiding behind countless concealment charms and behind some strategically placed bushes. Adaline had stayed home at their manor in France, something which Evangeline was glad about. Things could turn ugly very quickly and she didn’t want her beloved wife to get hurt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She knew she wouldn’t be able to save her brother’s whole family which consisted of him, James, his wife Lily, their son Harry and their unborn child. She knew Severus wanted to save Lily and the boy, he held no love for James and Evangeline could not blame him after the cruelties her brother and his friends had subjected him to. Evangeline wasn’t exactly fond of Lily, not after she had abandoned her and Severus in their fifth year. Not that she wanted to see either of them dead. If she could she would save Lily and James, but if she could only save one person from this badly warded hell hole she would save their son. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus and Evangeline watched as Voldemort, Wormtail and two other death eaters arrived. It was a small group, but she knew Voldemort would expect this to be easy. If James and Lily weren’t using everything they knew about magic, it would be easy to kill a toddler. Evangeline knew someone else had to have placed these wards, she couldn’t see her brother’s or his wife’s magical signature. Whoever had placed them was either an incompetent idiot or had purposefully messed with them. They gave the illusion of safety, but it was just that; an illusion. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Evangeline waited before Voldemort and his followers entered the house before signalling to Severus to follow her. She swallowed when she saw the house light up in the telling green colour of the killing curse and blasted the door open. She threw a disembowelment curse at Pettigrew, making him scream in pure agony and then stunned the two death eaters. She placed a binding spell on the trio which wouldn’t allow them to leave unless dead or taken by someone else. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then she and Severus walked upstairs, listening to the Dark Lord argue with Lily. He asked her to step aside three times, but she refused. She was desperate to save her son and was willing to do anything to protect him. It was one of the few things Evangeline appreciated about her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He kept his promise.” Severus whispered softly, “I didn’t think he would.” He sounded confused. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was very surprising Voldemort kept his promise, although it likely would not save Lily anyways, as the man wasn’t exactly sane these days. It was why Evangeline and Adaline had moved to France and lived under a Fidelius Charm. As they had not taken the mark, it meant they were safe from the Dark Lord’s ever diminishing sanity. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She watched Severus turn pale and his eyes tear up when they heard Voldemort say the killing curse again. Lily’s last words reminded her son that he was loved. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on,” Evangeline whispered and pulled Severus with her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They entered the small bedroom where Harry was crying in his crib and Voldemort had his wand pointed at the toddler. Evangeline cast a quick body bind, while Severus levitated a mirror in front of Voldemort as the man himself was firing another killing curse. It reflected on him and made him scream from the undoubtedly terrible pain. He was reduced to ash, bones and blood. There was also a wraith hanging around Harry and a slight sliver of the Dark Lord’s soul which attached itself to the toddler. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus quickly gathered some of it, knowing Adaline had certain plans with it and it was easier to focus on this rather than on grieving his once friend. Evangeline quickly picked up Harry and grabbed some of his belongings. She noticed a box that noted it contained precious items in her brother’s handwriting and shrunk it to place it in the pocket of her robes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Neither of them had noticed the wraith or the small soul piece. The wraith was interested that they collected his remains. Normally this only happened when someone was planning to resurrect a person, yet these people had just killed him. He recognised them, his dearest Severus and the bright witch who was so unlike her brother who fought on a different side. Voldemort, in his wraith form, decided to follow them and see what they were planning. He attached himself to Severus’s robes and felt them all apparate away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Albus Dumbledore entered the Potter house in Godric’s Hollow, which he had warded and placed under a fidelius he noticed Peter Pettigrew, with insides that were definitely no longer inside, two men with death eaters masks that were stunned and James Potter’s dead body. He walked upstairs and saw Lily, but not the boy. There were some bones, ash and blood on the floor that clearly belonged to an adult. Had someone taken the boy?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All these months of careful scheming had been destroyed because someone had clearly not stuck to the plan. It had been bad enough that Severus Snape had not joined his side, he had hoped to make the man make a vow but he had not come. Dumbledore had just received a note that asked to hide the Potters but Severus never stopped by. It meant he had to actually find another Potions teacher, as Slughorn had decided to retire. Very annoying. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But now the boy was gone too. A terrible thing. Still, he could spin a story. He would either use the Longbottom boy or say Harry was placed with relatives. Yes that would be good. He was sure he could find the child before it was time to attend Hogwarts, if not he could always create a Golem and claim someone had killed the boy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He also needed to figure out how to deal with Sirius, now Peter was bleeding all over the carpet. Dumbledore wanted to seriously curse whoever had come here before him. How dare they ruin his plans?! Now he would need to start planning all over again and use up even more favors, terrible!</span>
