    <p>‘<em>Helllooooo…. Ron…. My gorgeous ginger man…</em>’</p>
<p>Hermione had ingested a few too many firewhiskies. Ron knew she wasn’t normally the type to drink excessively, but it was Christmas and she had said she ‘wanted to let her hair down’.</p>
<p>Now, Ron <em>quite liked</em> Hermione’s hair as it was, and her hair was almost always down, but that was beside the point.</p>
<p>The point was that she was now giggling to herself whilst leaning into his shoulder. Which Ron had no complaints about at all. One of his favourite things in the world was cuddling with Hermione.</p>
<p> They were both sat on the sofa, an empty bottle of Ogden’s Firewhisky on the table in front of them. Hermione seemed to have steadily worked her way through most of the bottle over the course of the past few hours. After they had finished dinner (a lasagne that was Ron’s speciality), they had decamped to the sitting room, cuddling up on the sofa and watching television.</p>
<p>Ron had ingested roughly the same amount of alcohol as Hermione had, but -unlike his inebriated girlfriend- Ron was six-foot-tall and muscular. Combined with being a Weasley (a family who all had incredibly high tolerances for alcohol), this meant that Ron felt virtually sober, although feeling very content as he put an arm around Hermione’s shoulder.</p>
<p>‘Ron… Ron… Ron… you know what we should do?’</p>
<p>‘‘Mione, I think you’re a <em>little</em> far-gone for that sort of thing-’</p>
<p>‘Nooooo…’ Hermione exclaimed, her cheeks flushing. ‘I didn’t mean <em>that</em>, you saucy devil! Although… although I like where your mind is going…. No…I meant… I meant we should… should watch a Disney film!’</p>
<p>‘A <em>what</em> film?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, they’re great!’ The bushy-haired witch smiled giddily, wiping a bit of drool off her cheek with her wrist. ‘They’re films by this American…. American company; I… I used to watch them with my mum during the summer holidays.’</p>
<p>Ron chuckled, ruffling Hermione’s enormous mane of hair.</p>
<p>‘Sure, love. Hang on a sec…’ Ron pulled his wand out of his pocket, and pointed towards their video shelf. ‘Accio Disney film!’</p>
<p>Several video cassettes flew towards them, landing with a light thud on the coffee table. Ron leaned forward, and picked up a couple.</p>
<p>‘So… the… er, “Little Mermaid” or… “The Lion King”?’</p>
<p>~~~~~~~</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘SOMEDAY I’LL BE PART OF YOUR WOOOOOORRRRRRLLLLDDDD…..’</p>
<p>Ron smiled to himself as Hermione sang –albeit in a very slurred voice- the finale to the song. She’d presumably seen this film a lot over the years.</p>
<p>‘You… you know s’mth’ng, Ron?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah, ‘Mione?’</p>
<p>Hermione nuzzled into his side, looking slightly sheepish.</p>
<p>‘When I was a child… I… I used to wonder why I didn’t fit in… I always seemed… different compared to the other children…’</p>
<p>Ron gave her side a comforting squeeze, and kissed the top of her head.</p>
<p>‘I know, love. It’s okay.’</p>
<p>‘No….no, you didn’t let me finish….my mum bought me this video because… because she thought the mermaid was a bit like me… never really fitted in… like I belonged somewhere else…’</p>
<p>‘Awww, ‘Mione…. you belong in <em>both</em> the wizard and muggle worlds.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I know that now… but… but I didn’t back then… I was a really lonely child… that’s what I always loved that song… f-forget it, I’m being silly…’</p>
<p>She blinked hurriedly, and turned to look away, but Ron cupped her face gently with his hand, so that she was looking him in the eye.</p>
<p>‘You’re part of <em>my</em> world, ‘Mione…’ he said, stroking her cheek softly with his thumb. ‘You’re my <em>whole </em>world.’</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes glistened with tears as she smiled up at him, and she closed her hand around Ron’s, squeezing it tenderly.</p>
<p>‘And you’re my whole world too, Ron.’</p>
<p>It might have just been the alcohol talking, but –as Ron’s lips met Hermione’s- he knew that they both meant it.</p>
