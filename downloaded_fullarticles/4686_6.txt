    <p>Thirty minutes to freedom.</p><p><br/> The clock reads 9:30, but it changes to 9:31 as you stare. The same moment the light turns green and you continue to drive down the rain-slicked hellhole your town calls Main Street.</p><p>"Could you change the music?" asks the voice behind you. For a split second, you forgot you weren't alone.</p><p>What stations do old ladies like? You fumble with the radio. Black Eyed Peas are a hard no. Talk radio is always a risk. Sports. Air conditioning ads. Finally, Frank Sinatra. You take a peek in the mirror to see whether or not this pleases her, and the look on her face is indeed pleasant.</p><p>Sinatra's crooning placates her for a minute before she opens her coral-stained mouth. "You're very handsome, officer."</p><p>You pause and briefly look in the mirror a second time, this time at yourself. It's been a good while since anybody told you that, aside from the sarcastic food court kids who complimented you on your "brow game." Whatever that is.</p><p>It's not that you've lost your looks. It's just that your eyes haven't had a light in them for years. Probably better that way.</p><p><br/> Before you can thank the old lady, she continues. "You remind me of my son. Beautiful boy." She smiled knowingly, light teasing in her voice, "he was rough around the edges also." Was. You feel a knot in your stomach and suddenly merge into the right hand lane.</p><p><br/> "My place is to the lef-"</p><p>"I know, ma'am." You say, in your most comforting matter-of-fact tone. New Jersey may not have a lot to offer, but living in the diner capital of the world comes in handy sometimes. You pull into the parking lot. Rocco's 24/7 Diner. What it lacked in decor it made up for in convenience. "I'd like to buy you some food."<br/> She opens her mouth to protest, but her stomach growls, as if on cue. "Thank you, officer. I di-"</p><p>You've already slammed the door and walked out to open hers.</p><p>She clutches her garish purse as she takes your hand for support before wobbling out. Within five minutes you walk in, make eye contact with Rocco's daughter, and get a booth.</p><p>"So important," fawns the old lady with more gentle teasing. She looks at you, almost begging you to acknowledge her humor. You look at the clock. She catches you and frowns. Fuck.</p><p>"You should have seen me in New York," you offer. "I was a big shot there." You give her your warmest smile.</p><p>"NYPD?" She asks, eyebrow raised, "why did you move? Kids?"</p><p>"I needed a change," you mumble into your straw before tasting the most disgusting water New Jersey has to offer.</p><p>For the moment, the old lady doesn't press the matter. "Dolores," she says.</p><p>Fuck. Pleasantries. This was not the day. You have a separate mental tank reserved for polite exchanges. Today the tank was nearly depleted. <em>This is better than being alone,</em> you remind yourself.</p><p><br/> "Charles Graves." You smile weakly. A partial lie, but who would admit being named Percival? You haven't for decades and you're not about to start. You shake her fragile hand. She's a nice lady. It isn't her fault you're a miserable fuck.</p><p>"When will my car be ready?" Dolores asks. You remind her, for the twelth time, you have no jurisdiction over such a thing. Truth be told, you don't have power over much of anything anymore. You like it that way... most days. A few unruly diner patrons meet your gaze and sink into their seats. Luckily, they didn't get that memo.</p><p>Outside, the drizzling turns into a small shower.</p><p>"Looks like we have time for three courses," jokes Dolores.</p><p>"I'm in no rush," you say, trying to sound light-hearted but failing. Okay, take two. Sound like a decent human being this time. "You can get whatever you like. And something for tomorrow if you want." There you go. That's what sincerity sounds like, asshole.</p><p>And you were sincere. You <em>are</em> sincere. But it's often highly inconvenient.</p><p>"I couldn't take your money," she pauses, blatantly trying to remember the name you just told her before settling on "officer."</p><p><br/> "You're a tax payer," you say dismissively.</p><p>"Yes, but I'm sure you have a family."</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>This was, of course, the perfect time for Katrina to come over and take your drink orders. Dolores gets a root beer float. You know better than to order what you really want while on the clock. Dolores reads the seemingly endless menu, which ranged from 99 cent quesadillas to a $35 lobster dinner. That's a Jersey diner for you. For a second, you think you got away with that comment, and there would be no further questions.</p><p>"Tuna salad or a turkey club?" Dolores wonders out loud. You pretend to look at your menu, but you and everyone in that kitchen know you always get the same thing. Still, pretending to read is a great way to avoid conversation. Like a millennial faking a phone call, or so you hear.</p><p>"Club," she says quietly before putting her menu down and her reading glasses in that hideous beaded bag. "Now..." Oh, here it comes. "What do you mean, no family? A handsome guy like you?"</p><p>"I used to be married," you grumble. You close your mouth, but then you realize there is no escaping her line of questioning. A taste of your own medicine, you guess. You know you might as well put it all out there so you can just eat your damn meatloaf in peace. "She died before we could have children." No, you know the yenta is going to keep asking. "Car accident."</p><p>Dolores nodded, "My husband died a few years back."</p><p>There are plenty of things to say that come to mind, but you would prefer silence, and that's what you get for a while.</p><p>10:31.</p><p>Dolores picks at her turkey club, about which she found no less than six things to complain, and you wait. Your plate has been empty for what seems like hours. <em>Better than being alone</em>, you remind yourself.</p><p> </p><p>11:38.</p><p>You pull up to her place, mentally preparing for ten minutes of goodbyes. But all you hear is silence.</p><p>You look back at her still body and feel a sense of panic. Then she snores.</p><p><em>Figures,</em> you think bitterly as you dig through an endless supply of candy wrappers, coupons and receipts to find the keys at the bottom of that abomination of a purse. Quietly, and without a second thought, you unlock her door and carry her in. First you tuck her in, then you put the leftovers in her fridge. The house is depressing. Bills stacked, faded photographs on the mantle, a collection of long-expired food in the pantry. You take your wallet out and leave $40 on her kitchen island. She probably won't even realize it wasn't hers to begin with.</p><p> </p><p>12:07</p><p>At long last, you are back at your place. Depressing in its own right, but it's home. You turn on the TV for white noise and pull out two pints, one dark ale, the other Edy's, which you dig your spoon in savagely.</p><p>Your feet are tired and you are emotionally taxed. You could have been on this couch hours ago. <em>No good deed goes unpunished.</em></p><p> </p><p>2:16</p><p>You wake up with a start. You fell asleep on the couch again, third beer still in your lap. You momentarily forget what woke you. Then you see him.</p><p><br/> Across the street, cackling to an unknown person in a car. Your neighbor, the little shit. He's 19. 21. Something like that. Old enough to get into trouble past midnight, young enough to stay awake past midnight. Sometimes, to your dismay, he slams his car door at 5 AM before sneaking into his long-suffering parents' home.</p><p>You get up and stare out the window, arms crossed. He can't see you, but you can see him. The headlights illuminate his smug little face as he grins at another boy, now exiting the car to hug him.</p><p>The boy's lips form a fond smile as they share a lingering hug, and the second boy turns around to go back in the car. The neighbor boy grabs him by his revolting American Apparel hoodie and pulls him, giggling, into a kiss. Not a brotherly kiss, either.</p><p>You watch this incident for as long as you can stomach before violently closing your blinds.</p><p>You get yourself to bed, looking through yesterday's notifications on your phone.</p><p>16 voicemails.</p><p>38 spam emails.</p><p>2 texts.</p><p>1 reminder: "Wedding anniversary."</p><p> </p>
