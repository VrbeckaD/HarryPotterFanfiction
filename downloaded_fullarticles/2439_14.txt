  <span>Don’t beat yourself up. Not your fault, and my new feathered friend and I are having a grand time. Running is better than sitting, always was. Well, maybe beat yourself up a little. Not for this, for twelve years ago, for not helping me then. Though I’m sure you  already blamed yourself for that, too. Be okay, then, yeah? Be fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Write me. Tell me anything. Be careful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Padfoot</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Padfoot,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I had been waiting to get a letter from you, and was beginning to worry I might not. I’m glad you wrote, and glad you seem to know me as well as ever. Of course I blame myself--how could I not? I’ve been living with this condition my whole life; to forget like that, as a man in my 30s, is at least embarrassing, if not shameful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You say to beat myself up for twelve years ago, and on that point, I’ll have to argue. Beat myself up for believing what everyone purported to be true, what my own eyes and ears seemed to confirm, and what six months of increasingly alienating behavior on your part suggested? Admit that, at least: you gave me more reason to suspect than trust you that summer. And let’s not forget </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>suspicions of me. What would you have thought, if the roles were reversed?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I tried to blame myself every which way, though, right afterwards. I blamed myself for the rat’s death, for our two dear friends, for not taking in their son. I  blamed myself for not telling anyone how oddly you were acting, and then I blamed myself for how oddly you were acting. I scarcely left the flat for months, spinning in circles around it all. Spinning in circles around you, and getting dizzy from it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m through with that, though, and have been for years now. If my mind tries to take me there I firmly reject the offer. No more circles for me, when I can help it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m visiting my mother soon. My father died, by the way, while you were gone. I suppose you wouldn’t know. How would you feel if I told her about you? I’ll defer to your judgment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Moony</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dearest Moony:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How formal a letter to receive whilst perched in a cave! Where that cave might be, I shan’t reveal. As I said, and as you observed, we must be careful if we are to continue such a correspondence. No cave locales.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I gave you reason to suspect? Maybe. But weren’t things better? I think they were, at the end? Memory is one of the tricky things, even after being out almost a year. But I think we were trusting each other again, I thought we were, right at the end. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I am sorry to hear about your father. I don’t really know what to say. It’s terrible, isn’t it, yet it’s hard for me to understand it in the proper way, I think. I think it’s hard for me to understand anything. Not brain but heart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tell your mother, tell her everything. I trust her more than I trust you, even. I wish I could see her. Maybe someday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Have to get it together. Writing to my godson soon. Man on the run. Hm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Padfoot</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Padfoot,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hope you aren’t put off by formality in correspondence. It’s rather hard for me to write any other way, which I think you should know. Do you remember our letters that Christmas holiday, seventh year? I don’t think a person would know we were writing to each other, they were so vastly different in style.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, things were better at the end. Better than the long, long summer. Better, but still not good. I was being sent on suicide missions, and you thought I was betraying everyone. Even at the end, you still thought that, at least a little. Enough to act strangely, and sometimes coldly. Unpredictably, I suppose. For all your wild nature, there was always some predictability about you, until that summer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What I mean by that, maybe, is that I </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> you, through and through, and what others saw as wild, I knew was simply your way. But that summer things changed, and I could never reach nor read you. It was unlike you to be so very distant, but some days still you seemed to retain that affectionate nature. What was I to think? I would emerge from a shower to find you scouring my bookshelf; I would return from a mission to find a note that said simply </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘don’t wait,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>and you’d be gone for days. But every moon, there you were. And a time or two you swept into the flat with roses as though you had never hurt me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thank you for the permission to tell my mother. You know how she loved you, or perhaps you don’t know. I don’t think I knew quite how much until you were gone. She always harbored more pity than blame for you, despite what we thought we knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Be careful writing to your godson. Be careful, in general, Pads. I’m worried for you. Try to reign your thoughts in, will you? If I could be there to help, I would be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Moony</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Moony,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I am having trouble reigning in my thoughts. Maybe you can have a go sometime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sorry, sorry, sorry. I’m sorry for all the things I did or said or didn’t say. You’re right, I’ve been shit, haven’t I. You come home and how are you supposed to trust someone like me? I like the idea of roses; perhaps I’ll try it. Does that work on you?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I don’t remember, or, I do remember but it’s not memories. That doesn’t make sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a tree I keep wanting to climb but somehow my body is so much older than it ought to be. How is the moon treating you these days? I miss it. Someday soon I’ll be with you for it again. I’d never miss that, you’re right. It matters too much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Don’t stop writing, please, please, please. I know I’m mad, I know it and I know it, but please keep sending me letters. I try not to write anything to my godson when I feel this way, but I need to be able to write you. Do you miss me? Did you miss me? How did it feel to see me in the shack? When all we could share was a hug and an enemy and the story of how it all happened. Did you want to punch me, kiss me, prove to yourself I was real? I wanted to but I couldn’t, couldn’t do any of that in front of the children. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I think I’m in the flat now. Come home soon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Love,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Padfoot</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Padfoot,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I will not stop writing you. Your being mad didn’t stop me from living with you, so I don’t see why it would keep me from maintaining our correspondence. I promise to keep writing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And of </span>
  <em>
    <span>course </span>
  </em>
  <span>I missed you. I miss you now. I feel less guilty over it now than when I thought you were a murderer, but even then I couldn’t help myself, especially at first. I think I told you before, but I spent a long time absolutely wasting away in the flat, imagining somehow you would come home and everything would have been some horrible mistake. I suppose after a fashion that is what happened. Of course I miss you. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moon is as kind to me as ever, but I have a stronger defense than I used to. My furry friend, like me, is older now, less prone to melodrama, and so things are a little easier. He has missed his friend as much as I have mine, and indeed for a long time, far more. A year after I could go through a week without hopelessly wishing you back, he would still howl all night for that dog.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Roses don’t work very well on me. You’ll have better luck with finely bound books.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You aren’t making me worry less about you. Send me letters in whatever mood you must, but perhaps if you’re feeling particularly lucid anytime soon you might write me some reassurances. I want you to be okay. Remember where you are, and when you are. We do not share a flat. It is not 1980. You have a godson to care about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Remus</span>
</p><p>
  <span>P.S. My mother was absolutely overcome when I told her. She misses you and hopes to see you, someday. She made me promise to relay that you are welcome at any time in her house, and she will protect you as best she can; I told her that you are almost certainly in another country, but she wouldn’t hear it. She sends love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Moony,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As per your request, a letter written in a lucid state of mind; as lucid as I can be, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’m glad you missed me, glad it wasn’t just me, I guess. I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>glad</span>
  </em>
  <span> you spent so long in the flat being miserable, but I’m glad I’m not the only one who suffered through it. But I do think I got the worse end of the deal, don’t you? I won’t hide it, I’m a little pissed. You talk about </span>
  <em>
    <span>wondering </span>
  </em>
  <span>if somehow there was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>mistake, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and of course there was--or rather not a mistake, all very intentional--but for all of your wondering and speculating, why did you never look into it? Never visited, never poked around. I’m sure you would have found something if you had just </span>
  <em>
    <span>looked. </span>
  </em>
  <span>And instead I got to lose a decade, more than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>My feathered friend and I are on the move again. I never could stay in one place very long, even when no one chased me. Well, with the exception being that last flat of ours. Home. Do you suppose the building is there still? Old piece of shit was barely standing when we lived there, I can’t imagine it still is now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I miss your mother, too. I don’t want to write to her; it feels dangerous, somehow. But tell her for me, tell her I still love her. I miss her cooking, too, though it’s on my mind simply due to total lack of food. Not total, don’t go worrying too much. The dog has grown quite good at hunting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Is this reassuring enough? I can form sentences; I know when and where I am, enough so to be kind of angry at you over it. Enough to be angry, but also enough to wonder how I might get my hands on one of these finely bound books you say work so well on you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Love,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Padfoot</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dear Pads,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I can’t blame you for your anger. It’s rather justified. I can’t let myself lose sleep over these kinds of things anymore, but know that I deeply regret not doing anything in the immediate aftermath, or even years later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But you have to understand, when I say I was rotting in the flat for months, I don’t mean that I </span>
  <em>
    <span>decided </span>
  </em>
  <span>to give up and lie around. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>could not leave. </span>
  </em>
  <span>You’ve seen me at some very low points, but no depression I ever experienced matched that of the time following that Halloween. First, months in the flat; then, mum dragged me home with her, where I began to get better incrementally, but still absolutely floundered; then, a total relapse when I tried to move back to London. When my father told me I ought to relocate and seek help, I knew I couldn’t ignore it, given how often I had heard him speak so derisively of </span>
  <em>
    <span>therapy </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>depression. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He was convinced of their validity by my absolute failure to function.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end, really, almost the only way I could carry on and live a life was by saying goodbye to you. I’m sorry, and you can consider that an apology in perpetuity, but I can’t dwell on it. I don’t let myself dwell on things anymore, if I can help it. It only leads deeper into my brain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I do feel reassured by your letter. I only wish I could be there with you--wherever </span>
  <em>
    <span>there </span>
  </em>
  <span>is, now. If you can describe your locale in a very general sort of way, paint me a picture. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, write soon and stay safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--Moony</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*****</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Writing soon, staying safe. Mind unclear why. Miss and love you, of course, and sorry for all the mental for all the mental anguish is that a word? More I look less it seems likely. Do you remember that time by the lake? I miss your half-grin</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Love from Padfoot</span>
