          <div class="userstuff"><p>She sat across from Ginny Weasley and tried not to stare but couldn't help herself. He loved her once, the way he loves her Draco now. </p><p>Her Draco. </p><p>Did she even have that claim? </p><p>She supposed she never actually had a claim on Draco. She'd always known what they had was temporary. Even after Scorpius was born. Draco'd been honourable enough to never be unfaithful to her. Physically, at least. </p><p>Emotionally? She had no idea how many years her husband had loved Harry Potter. And how many years Harry Potter had loved Draco Malfoy?</p><p>At least Ginny Weasley had the decent sense of not actually getting married. Of seeing what was obvious long before anyone else had. </p><p>"We could be friends," Ginny had said to Astoria when she'd asked her out for coffee. Astoria still wasn't quite sure why she'd actually said yes. </p><p>Perhaps she was intrigued by the fire. The fire that was so <i>evident</i> in Ginny Weasley. The fire that spoke volumes even if the woman sat stoic in front of her. </p><p>"So, are you going to say anything?" Ginny asked. </p><p>"What would you have me say?" Astoria replied. </p><p>Ginny reached over and took Astoria's hand in hers. "Perhaps, it's something I wish for us to do." He answer was so natural, her gaze so calm and cool on Astoria, it gave Astoria chills. </p><p>She had been interested in women <i>that</i> way but had never pursued it. Her parents would never allow it. But now they weren't here and she couldn't give a fuck what society'd think. </p><p>"You're quite forward, aren't you?" </p><p>Ginny smiled that brilliant smiled and sat back. "You say it like it's a bad thin." </p><p>"No," Astoria said, squeezing Ginny's hand. "Not a bad thing at all." </p><p>Later, Astoria discovered Ginny's kisses were fire too.</p><hr/></div>
