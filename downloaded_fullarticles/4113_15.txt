    <p>July 31, 1980</p>
<p>A pained wail echoed through a bedroom deep within the halls of Riddle Manor, an expansive castle located in the sprawling English countryside. The grounds and building itself were thickly layered with potent magic, wards and traps alike, to keep intruders out. The Manor was the home of Tom Marvolo Riddle and main base for his organization of Death Eaters. At this very moment, though, the whole castle, its residents, and the Dark Lord himself, were waiting with bated breath and excitement for the arrival of something every special.</p>
<p>The jittery silence was broken by another groan and hushed words of encouragement. Inside the bedroom was a woman with beautiful red hair, now stuck to her forehead with sweat, her expression scrunching in pain. Two men were on either side of the bed on which she rested, both holding her hands. To her right was a tall, pale, lanky wizard with black, straight hair that reached his shoulders. He was clutching her hand tightly, murmuring sweet things to her as her breathing got more strained and ragged. On her left side was another tall man, more muscular than the other, whose dark hair curled handsomely across his forehead. He was holding her hand more gently, but she was grasping tightly to his, her nails digging into his skin.</p>
<p>“S-SEV I’M GONNA K-KILL YOU!!” The woman cried, tears dripping down her cheeks.</p>
<p>She’s spent twelve hours or more in labor, each minute that passed brought more pain. She hated her husband, she <em>hated</em> him for putting her through this! Why couldn’t <em>he</em> have carried their child to save her this agony!</p>
<p>“Lils, shhh,” the man named “Sev” soothed her. “You’re almost there, you’ve done so well, just a little bit farther my love.”</p>
<p>“It hurts!” she moaned, clenching her hands, tossing her head back on the many pillows that were supporting her head and shoulders. “Harry if you don’t come out right now you’re grounded forever!!” her whine laced with exhaustion.</p>
<p>The other man smiled gently, his soft expression only privy to the expecting parents and one blonde, pure blood named Lucius Malfoy. He was one of the Death Eaters in his Inner Circle and there to ensure that no one else would come into the room and cause trouble. The dark, short haired wizard stroked the hair back from her forehead.</p>
<p>“T-thanks, Tom.” Lily whimpered, another contraction making her grit her teeth.</p>
<p>“Now now Lily, your little one has yet to be born, don’t punish him. When he comes you will be elated and forget you even said that anyways,” Tom chuckled and looked up at the healer he brought in to look after one of his favorites. The medi-wizard nodded with a small smile.</p>
<p>The fiery-haired woman was one of the strongest in his organization when it came to charms, wards, and healing. Not many were surprised when she and Severus Snape, his brilliant Potions Master revealed their engagement, then their pregnancy shortly after they were married in secret. They had fallen in love during their years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and took their vows at Riddle Manor with a small ceremony. Tom presided over their marriage and blessed them with full, long lives together.</p>
<p>Despite the immense hatred he received for being the most powerful and cruel wizard of the century, he was actually kind to those that followed him. He despised what he had grown to be, what his <em>reputation </em>had become. He certainly was violent, power hungry and hell-bent on taking over the magical world. Though years of being without love, kindness, and friendship had him unconsciously becoming close to his Inner Circle…his comrades.</p>
<p>Another wail broke his train of thought and his red eyes found Lily’s enchanting green ones. Her chest heaved and her body shook with effort to bring her baby into the world. He also met Severus’ dark eyes that were filled with anxiety and most of all: love. Love for his wife and soon to be new-born.</p>
<p>Tom felt his shriveled heart warm a little. Normally he took no part in his Death Eater’s personal lives, as it didn’t concern him. When Lily had placed his hand on her belly months ago and he felt the baby move against it, he immediately changed his mind. His whole body had frozen and before he could explain he had knelt before her and put both of his hands on her to feel the baby kick. He felt the magic growing within the baby and it reached out to him. When his own magic met the baby’s, his body had become covered in gooseflesh and his heart started to pound. He stood and excused himself from her presence and fled to his chambers, his hands still tingling from their contact.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Evans, please push for me,” The Healer murmured, looking up at her from his place at the end of the bed. His instructions were met by a growl and narrowed green eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m TRYING!” Severus just shook his head, partly to hide the small smile at her response.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord gently detached Lily’s hand from his and placed it lightly on her swollen belly, caressing the soft skin there, his magic sought out little Harry’s.</p>
<p>“Little one, you are certainly giving your mum quite a lot of trouble.” He crooned, “If you come on out here you will immediately be spoiled by your parents and myself of course.”</p>
<p>Lucius, who had been standing quietly by the door was couldn’t help but smile a little. His Lord was so kind and to witness was a rare event, something he would always remember. Tom had been there with himself and Narcissa when his son Draco was born back in June. The Dark Lord was nothing like the papers or the Light suggested. He was violent when he needed to be, but otherwise he was focused more on politics and integrating into the Ministry of Magic using words, not spells, to change the way things were run. </p>
<p>His deep thoughts were broken by a baby’s sharp cry, and everyone watched little Harry Evans being brought forth into the world. <em>Had my Lord’s words reached the babe</em>? Lucius’ eyes widened, but he put it aside to clap his congratulations for the new parents.</p>
<p>Lily began to cry openly as she received her swaddled bundle and Tom could see tears drip down Severus’ cheeks as well. His own eyes pricked but he wished it away, though his smile was wide.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Lily, Severus!” Tom crooned, and lightly touched the baby’s chubby cheeks. “Welcome, little Harry,” Crimson eyes met green eyes that were even brighter than Lily’s and the newborn smiled.</p>
