          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Hugo, stand by my side," Hermione said to her 5-year-old son, who was about to wander around the store.</p><p>"But, Mum, I want Pop-Tarts," Hugo said.</p><p>"I still have to get some spaghetti. After that, we'll get Pop-Tarts, ok?" Hermione assured her son.</p><p>"Ok," Hugo said, holding his 7-year-old sister, Rose's, hand.</p><p>Hermione smiled as she grabbed some spaghetti noodles, then lead her kids to the snack aisle. She noticed a blond man standing in front of the Pop-Tarts, with a blond boy next to him.</p><p>"Pardon me," she said.</p><p>"Oh, my sincerest apologies," the man said, stepping out of her way. He turned around, revealing himself to be Draco Malfoy. "Hermione?" he said.</p><p>"Draco! Hi," Hermione responded.</p><p>"It's been so long! How have you been?" Draco asked, hugging Hermione gently.</p><p>"I've been doing well, and you?" Hermione said, returning the hug.</p><p>"I've been great," Draco told her.</p><p>"That's good to hear," Hermione said.</p><p>"Hi! I'm Hugo!" Hugo introduced himself while holding his hand out.</p><p>"Hello, Hugo! I'm Draco Malfoy, an old friend of your mother's," Draco said, shaking Hugo's hand.</p><p>"Did Astoria choose to stay home?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"Astoria died 4 years ago. She got really sick," Draco said.</p><p>"Oh my, I'm so sorry," Hermione said sadly.</p><p>"Don't be! It's ok. I'm ok, really," Draco assured her, gently placing a hand on her shoulder. "What about Ron? Is he anywhere here?" he asked.</p><p>"Actually, Ron and I divorced 2 years ago. Caught him snogging a waitress," Hermione explained.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Hermione," Draco said.</p><p>"It's ok. I'm fine,"Â  Hermione assured him. "So what brings you here, Draco?" she asked curiously.</p><p>"Scorpius here was curious about Muggle snacks and wanted to try them out," Draco told her.</p><p>"They've got a lot of cool stuff here. Like Nutella! Nutella looks so good!" Scorpius said, holding up a jar of Nutella.</p><p>"Nutella <em>is</em> amazing! You're going to love it. You're also going to love Ferrero Rocher," Rose said.</p><p>"What's that?" Scorpius asked curiously.</p><p>"Chocolate with hazelnuts. Oh! And there's a box right behind me," Rose said as she grabbed a box of Ferrero Roche and handed it to the younger blond.</p><p>"Those look like Golden Snitches without wings," Draco commented, and Hermione laughed.</p><p>"Now that you mentioned it, they kind of do," Hermione said in between laughs.</p><p>"Perfect for a Quidditch themed party," Rose said.</p><p>"And I still want my Pop-Tarts," Hugo whined, and everyone laughed.</p><p>"Oh, sorry! Go ahead and grab your Pop-Tarts," Hermione said, and her son grabbed a box of cinnamon Pop-Tarts.</p><p>"Well, it was great seeing you again, Hermione. And nice meeting you, kids," Draco said.</p><p>"It was wonderful seeing you too, Draco. And nice meeting you, Scorpius," Hermione said. "You guys, take care," she added.</p><p>"You as well. Hopefully we run into each other again," Draco said. "Actually, I was wondering if you were available some time tomorrow. Maybe we could grab a cup of coffee, or tea. Maybe some lunch," he hoped.</p><p>"As a matter of fact, I am available tomorrow. Coffee sounds great," Hermione agreed.</p><p>"Wonderful! Does noon sound like a good time?" Draco asked.</p><p>"It's perfect," Hermione said.</p><p>"Alright. I'll see you then," Draco said, smiling brightly at her.</p><p>"Yep. See ya," Hermione said as she smiled back.</p></div>
