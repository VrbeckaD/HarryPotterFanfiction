    <p>Chapter One</p><p>A small boy lay unconscious in a small room at Number 4, Privet Drive. The boy’s uncle, Vernon Dursley, had mercilessly beaten his young nephew once again. Defeated, Harry Potter had succumbed to darkness. But before his heavy eyes had closed, he had bitterly thought of what a wonderful birthday gift his uncle had given him. Little did he know, it had been.</p><p>The unconscious state his body had forced him into had prevented the boy from feeling the excruciating pain of his transformation. Wings sprouted from the thin back and scales erupted from underneath pale skin. And by morning, his body had healed from the damage of his uncle’s flying fists.</p><p>Waking up, Harry Potter was confused by what looked like black hair, all around him. He tugged and pulled on it which he found surprisingly painful. Once realizing that this hair was somehow connected to his own, he stumbled over to the full length mirror near the door of his tiny bedroom. He screamed.      </p><p>His normally short hair fell to his waist in soft black waves. Intertwined within it, grew equally soft black feathers. His face, already beautiful, had been transformed into something unearthly. His large, emerald eyes, encased in thick black lashes, were now surrounded by slightly feminine features. He noticed his lips, especially the bottom, were distinctly plumper.</p><p>Black scales dusted his neck and continued down other parts of his body. However, it was a pair of large black wings which Harry’s focus was now drawn to. With approximately a 12 foot wingspan, he wasn’t entirely sure how his 5 foot frame was able to stay standing. They looked quite heavy.</p><p>
  <em>Wait a second, I’m not wearing my glasses! I can see perfectly. What’s going on?</em>
</p><p>A tapping on the window alerted Harry to an owl with a package for him. After opening the window and making room to untie the burden from the small feathery thing, Harry opened the letter which had the Ministry's official seal. An impossible large book fell from within the envelope as well as a letter.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr. Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It has come to our attention that you have come into your magical inheritance on the date of your 16th birthday. Our records show that you have become an Avian. We have taken the liberty of enclosing a copy of Rare Magical Creatures, one of the few magical books which adequately covers the Avian species. </em>

</p><p>Harry took a large breath before opening the large tome and flipping to the section labeled Avian.</p><p>
  <u>The Avian</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Avians, rightfully named for their bird-like features and characteristics, are closely related to Veela. Avians, a bird based magical creature, are a mysterious and rare breed. Known for their beauty, wings, and scales, they are sought after for many purposes. Furthermore, Avians are incapable of hiding both the feathers interwoven in their hair or their wings. </u>
</p><p>
  <u>As with many other magical species, there are both Dominant and Submissive Avians.</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Dominant Avians</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Dominant Avians can be either male or female. However, female Dominants are very rare. Few cases have ever been reported. Dominants, much larger than their Submissive counterparts, have a wingspan of approximately 20 feet. The color of feathers, wings, and scales changes from Avian to Avian. Dominant’s can also have claws unlike a Submissive.</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Dominants, as far as they’re concerned, have one purpose in life which is to protect and love their Submissive and any offspring their Submissive births. Any threat to either Submissive or offspring will be eliminated immediately. </u>
</p><p>
  <u>Submissive Avians</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Submissive Avians, like Dominants, can be either male or female. Both male and female Submissives can give birth. Submissives are tiny compared to their Dominant(s). The average wingspan of a Submissive is 14 feet. They, like Dominants, have feathers, wings, and scales. The color also changes from Avian to Avian. However, Submissives have no claws. They rely on the viciousness of their Dominant(s) to protect them and their young. A Submissive is extremely vulnerable until they find their first mate. </u>
</p><p>
  <u>Mating</u>
</p><p>
  <u>Submissive Avians are capable of having any number of mates. More than three has never been reported. On average a Submissive Avian only has one mate. A Submissive does not choose who his/her mate will be. When a Dominant Avian realizes that a Submissive is his/her mate the Submissive will know. However, this will not stop a rogue Dominant from trying to take an unmated Submissive. This is why Submissives are so vulnerable without their first mate. A Dominant and Submissive will be officially mated once the Dominant bites the neck of a Submissive during intercourse. Little else is known about either the Dominant or Submissive Avian.</u>
