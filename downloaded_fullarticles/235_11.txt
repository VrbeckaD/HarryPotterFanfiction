    <p>Draco wished he was a brave man. Say what you will about that being too Gryffindor of him but when he was a young boy he never pretended to be the ambitious knight. He was always the brave knight who saved the princess from the evil Muggle King. However, he grew up as he did, he was who he was. He thought about this as he heard the snickering of two men walking in front of him.</p><p> He quickly crossed the dark street, putting some distance between them and himself. He watched as the men quickly caught up to a young women with her hood up. She was either a mudblood or a muggle, with her muggle pants and tight fitting sweater that did nothing to cover up the fact that she was very much with child. Not that it was any of his business but it seemed to be a bad idea for a young pregnant women to be walking alone at night in the middle of a war. Whatever was in the bag she was holding must have been rather important, or the bint lacked common sense.</p><p>It wasn’t until he heard one of the men clearly say “expelliarmus” that he felt the urge to be brave again.</p><p>“Would you look at what we have here, Jimmy.” Draco knew that voice from his Father’s circle.</p><p>“Well if I’m not mistaken, we have found ourselves a pretty little Twofer.”</p><p>Draco felt his stomach turn and he started to feel over heated. He had to keep reminding himself that this was not his business and to keep waking. Which he might have actually done, had he not heard her  voice.</p><p> His feet stopped in place and his head whipped back to the pregnant girl. There was no way he heard correctly. The brightest witch of his year could not be this stupid.</p><p>“Please give me back my wand and just let me pass. I’ve done nothing to you, and I don’t have anything you might want.” The witch actually had the gall to hold her hand out expectantly. There was no doubt that it was Hermione Granger. </p><p>“Aw now, I wouldn’t say that” </p><p>Draco feet moved on their own.</p><p>“I think we get a good couple o’ hours out of ya, at least-“</p><p>“There you are, you stupid swot.” Draco interrupted them, putting on his stoic face and gripping her arm harshly.</p><p>She quickly looked at him, and he could see the panic and confusion in her brown eyes.</p><p>“Oui, fuck off Malfoy! We found her first.” </p><p>Draco was right about knowing this man, which made what he did next make even less sense. He stepped between Hermione and the larger man and let out a sarcastic laugh. He spoke with a confidence he did not feel.<br/>
“Did you now? The how would you explain my heir growing in that gargantuan belly?” </p><p>Hermione breathed in quickly through her nose in a little gasp. Her mouth opened to say something, but Draco glared at her and she quickly shut it again, deciding to trust her natural enemy for the time being.</p><p>The two men looked back and forth between them in shock.</p><p>“A half-blood Malfoy?! I never-” Draco cut him off quickly, expertly hiding his internal panic at what he just said.</p><p>“Oh, don’t be bloody daft. I would never sully my family’s good name with such filth. The girl is just an incubator, not that I should even have to be explaining myself to the likes of you, McKoile.” Draco sneered at the man before the sound behind him made all the blood run from his face.</p><p>“Perhaps not to him, but you will explain yourself to me, and in full length.”</p><p>Draco turned to see the emotionless face of his father. Trying to come to grasps with his new situation, Draco stumbled for the correct words to say.</p><p>“Father, I-”</p><p>“Not here, you imbecile.” Lucius Malfoy grabbed Draco shoulder, not too gently, and Hermione ear. He apparated with them.</p><p> It was so unexpected that upon landing Hermione fell to her knees and vomited. Draco did not feel much better, and the look Lucius was giving him was making it worse by the second.</p><p>“I will go retrieve your mother, and then you will explain…. That.” He waved a dismissive hand towards Hermione who looked to be in shock and was being cleaned by a house elf. He then turned and walked away. Draco waited until he turned a corner before he started pacing.</p><p>“What the fuck did I just do?” Draco was talking  to himself but Hermione answered him anyway.</p><p> Her voice sounded small and confused.</p><p>“You lied for me. You lied in order to save me. Why? Why help me at all? Why claim my child is yours?”</p><p>Draco finally got a good look at his old classmate. She looked exactly the same, besides the pregnant belly and overall filth covering her face. He took a couple breaths before answering.<br/>
“Do you know what a Twofer is, Granger?”</p><p>“Not reall-“</p><p>“A Twofer is a Two for one. You get to kill two mudblood at once when you kill a pregnant one. Apparently I am not such a monster that I would watch that fate befall you.” Draco seemed to calm enough to think rationally for a moment. “You need to go now, before he returns. My mother is kind, but when my father learns that I lied about this, he will kill you, or turn you over immediately.” </p><p>Hermione nodded and stood up before she realized she was still wandless.<br/>
“I never got my wand back from that man.” </p><p>Draco groaned, they did not have time for this.<br/>
“A house elf can take you.”</p><p>Lucius’s voice entered the room before he did.</p><p>“They will do no such thing until I have all the answers I seek. Sadly, that will have to wait however, as The Lord wishes to have a meeting with you Draco. Unrelated to this I assure you.”<br/>
Lucius spoke to Hermon for the first time, without looking at her. “You will wait quietly out of sight until you are summoned if you know what is good for you.”</p><p>Draco wordlessly followed his father towards his father’s study. Bowing deeply upon seeing the Voldemort, before taking a seat in front of the large mahogany desk. The feeling of imminent death filled Draco, as it always did when in such close proximity to the Dark Lord.</p><p>“Report your update.”</p><p>Draco felt his heart pounding in his chest. He was almost certain that the day was going to end with his death.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord. We have not heard from the Giants in the east as of today. And the merpeople are requesting more outcome projections before they committing anything.”</p><p>“And the projections?” Draco had been fearing being the one to deliver bad news, even if he phrased it lightly it was not what the man wanted to hear.</p><p>“We have our best guys working on padding those numbers as we speak.”</p><p>“Padding? Is that required?” Draco knew he would be punished for the answer to that question, even if it wasn’t his fault.</p><p>However, before he could answer there was a commotion in the hallway right outside their door. Lucius stood and bowed to the Dark Lord.</p><p>“I will handle whatever that might be.” He started to excuse himself, but the door opened before he reached it.</p><p>In came Bellatrix Lestrange, dragging Hermione Granger into the room by her hair.</p><p>“Look what I found, dirtying your home, my Lord!” She giggled and threw Hermione at Draco feet.</p><p>“Oh my. Potters very own pet mudblood.” Voldemort said slowly as he raised his wand towards her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco was never a brave man.</p><p>“No, please wait, My Lord!”</p><p>So why did he have to start today?</p>
