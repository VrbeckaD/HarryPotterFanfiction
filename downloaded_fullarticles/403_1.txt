    <p align="center">The Harry Potter Universe belongs to J.K. Rowling.</p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>It was one of those Friday nights. Dark at the earliest of hours. Will it rain or not? Cold,with no where to go. Draco ducked deeper into his woolen coat. Muggle London it was, Camden Town the place to be or so he heard.</p><p> </p><p>The flashing neon club loomed further up ahead. He could have taken a cab, but rolling around in the back seat, not his preferred method to move around. He hadn’t gotten the hang of it. Walking was his preferred means of getting around in Muggle London. He could feel his wand inside his sleeve, he put a notice me not charm on it, and it was always at the ready. Not that he needed it where he was going. He heard about this club through the grapevine. The Electric Box, he would find kindred spirits there is what he heard.</p><p> </p><p>A bouncer stood at the door, at least two meters, black curly beard, earloop piercings, elongating the holes he had there, a tattoo running from his neck towards his temple. The guy looked a right menace.</p><p> </p><p>Draco halted as he looked at the burly guy. “The guys at Parliament directed me here.” Draco tried not to sound too posh.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm, right, step inside. Admittance is ten quid.” He opened the door to let the tall white-blond inside.</p><p> </p><p>Draco set foot inside, his black Chelsea boots under his jeans stood out amongst the other patrons. He shrugged his long dark blue woolen coat, handing it over to the cloakroom attendant.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s twelve-pound fifty including admittance.” The bright pink-haired girl handed him a black chip with a number embossed across it. Her smile was broad, painted jeans, blue lips matching her long nails. “Ta!” She answered as money was exchanged.</p><p> </p><p>Draco handed over fifteen pounds. Uttering a;” Keep the change.” As he pocketed his chip.</p><p> </p><p>The girls smiled broadened. Her shocking pink hair stood in sharp contrast to her almost white skin which was covered in floral tattoos. She wore a black tank with a my little pony unicorn, her nipples poking through the fabric, braless then. Underneath she wore white cotton frilly knickers and black knee-high boots covered with studs.</p><p> </p><p> “The main room is on your right behind the door, you’re new here, right?” She chewed her bubble gum and twisted her hair around her finger. Large lips smirked as she checked out the delicious platinum blond. Hot as sin surely.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, okay thanks.” Draco felt out of place with his dark blue oxford shirt. Ah well never mind he could do a drink and then leave.</p><p> </p><p>The swing door opened into the main room. Mysterious beats and a very dark area lit by a few sparse lamps showing him a dance area a few tables and chairs a long bench along the back wall, tables and more chairs in front of it. A well-stocked  bar with stools.</p><p> </p><p> It was busy, people were chatting animatedly in small groups, dancing with elaborate swirls on the dance floor or sitting amongst each other at the small tables. Draco walked towards an empty chair and table, overlooking the dance floor, he felt eyes scrutinizing him as he made his way through the crowd. He was new, and on his own, people would surely watch, he was used to being watched. These however were friendly eyes, not the kind who subjected him with biased opinions. He got that a lot in Diagon Alley, this atmosphere felt refreshing.</p><p> He sat himself down and watched the punters, relaxed as he sat back, soaking in the ambiance.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy?!” A familiar voice huffed behind him. He surprisedly peered sideways as this would be the last place where he expected to hear that voice.</p><p> </p><p>This was not what he anticipated at all. Soft curled deep electric blue hair and long nails, dark brown eyes, shooting golden sparks filled with fire, blue lips, a very shapely figure. Cat penciled eyelids, also a cropped tank top, showing a flat tummy, blue hip knickers and long over knee socks and blue Mary Janes. And as a piece de resistance colorful tattoos from behind her ear, down her neck, her cleavage done with the prettiest roses, a skull embedded crying bloody tears, arms covered with sleeve tattoos. Her belly continuing the roses and skull theme, a snake crawling out from a socket, lightning from her hip down her knickers. Black leopard spots on her thigh. He took in this vision of sauciness, holding a serving tray filled with drinks. He was bowled over.</p><p> </p><p>“Granger??!” He ascertained. Quirking his brow. Going braless was probably work attire.... was the stupidest conclusion his brain could come up with as he raked her form. Or was it his dick?</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well...Malfoy what can I get you?” She was very professional not at all fazed finding him here.</p><p> </p><p>“Your best Scotch would be good, neat please....make it a double.” He tried very hard not to gawk.</p><p> </p><p>“Very well, coming over in a minute.” Hermione turned around, swaying her hips as she walked.</p><p> </p><p>Draco watched her stride away, more tattoos covering her back and shoulders. What the actual fuck?</p><p> </p><p>Hermione served her drinks, got paid, and returned with a tumbler filled with whiskey. Placing it on a napkin in front of Draco. “Fifteen pounds please.” She said lazily.</p><p> </p><p>Draco handed her twenty. “Keep the change.” He said firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione pushed the twenty-pound note in a shot glass on her tray and extracted a fiver, slipping it behind her knickers. “Thanks, Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco downed the drink in one go. “Another one please, some water and whatever you want and sit down please.” Fuck him, she looked different, but for her eyes, those flaming sparks never seemed to have lost their intensity.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione turned around again, swaying her hips, making the fabric of her knickers stretch and show off her globes, the delicate skin under her buttocks exposed.</p><p> </p><p>Draco leaned back trying to figure out the music, German Lyrics, how quaint. ‘und WARUm?</p><p>nur für den kick - für den augenblick?</p><p>und WARUm?</p><p>nur für ein stück - von dem falschen glück?</p><p>und WARUm?</p><p>nur für den kick - für den augenblick?</p><p>und WARUm?’</p><p> </p><p>Hermione returned with another tumbler, a glass filled with water and a shot glass filled with a white spirit. “On me....” she sat down in the chair next to him. “So, Ferret, what brings you down to a Muggle club? A club for tattoo buffs and all?” She quirked her brow, saluted his glass, and downed her drink. Gritting her teeth when it made its way down her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Enjoying the ink and atmosphere,” Draco answered as nonchalant as he could.</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Hermione couldn’t wrap her brain around him being here. She observed him closely, his face was a bit more gaunt, sharper. Cold grey eyes, platinum blond hair swept back stylishly, with none of that hard gel he used when he was young. Strong hands and a very interesting physique, he worked out probably. Vain as he always was no doubt. What puzzled her more than anything was finding him in a very niche Muggle club, hell she questioned herself how she ever got here.</p><p> </p><p>“Long time no see.” Draco drank his whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well. It is how it goes.” Hermione replied laconically.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t say.” Draco tried to make out all her tattoos admiring her for all the pain she went through to get them on her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“You are gawking, and it isn’t becoming.” Hermione stared at the blond herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Admiring your ink is all,” Draco revealed because he did.</p><p> </p><p>“Never thought you would go for tattoos.” Hermione was surprised by his answer.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes well, try finding a swot like yourself covered with them working in a bar like this.” Draco chuckled. Fuck she looked hot as sin. Her nipples pebbled as he let his gaze travel her buxom. Her army green tank strained over her boobs. “That must’ve hurt..” he observed the hot pinks, greens blue, and gold, his eyes trained on the craftsmanship that went into it. He followed the vine connecting the roses down the swell of her breasts, Hermione’s cleavage exposing a lot of skin. He had no control over his tongue as he licked his lower lip, teeth grazing it when he was done staring.</p><p> </p><p>“The needle doesn’t compare to what the war has done.” Hermione watched his pupils dilate, almost feeling his eyes burning a hole in her tank, making her nipples swell. Two sides in a war, sitting here in a Muggle club. “Do you want to fuck.” It was out of her mouth before she knew it.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyes widened. “Come again?” He was utterly surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“You want to fuck me.” It was more an observation than a question.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Gods, yes.” Draco spluttered. “Now....or...”</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t my job, I volunteer I can go as I please.” She stood up, holding her hand out for him to take. “Now. Your house.” She commanded</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm, right.” Draco swallowed, he would very much like to see what was under her top, trace the tattoo with his fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Get your coat, and I will get mine from the back.” Hermione moved towards a personnel door at the back.</p><p> </p><p>Draco donned his coat, watching the cloakroom assistant licking her lollipop. Another door opened as Hermione entered the space. A long grey woolen coat covering her body. A small beaded bag hanging crossbody. She leaned over the counter, placing a kiss on the other girls' lips, lingering there. “See you, Siobhan.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going home with the buff looking platinum blond?” Siobhan smirked with a conspiratorial acknowledgment.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup, we’ll see if he can keep up.” Hermione laughed, a bell-like quality, Draco thought matched the fondness she displayed with the other girl but wasn’t directed towards him.</p><p> </p><p>It was freezing outside, turning their breath to white mist. “Clark, get us a cab, will you?” Another kiss exchanged, a peck on the cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, H.” The large fella answered, his eyes sizing up Draco, warning him not to hurt Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>A cab halted as soon as Clarke signaled.</p><p> </p><p>Draco held the door for Hermione to scoot into the back, she sat with her back to the cabby.</p><p> </p><p>Draco moved to sit opposite her, telling the driver his address.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked sternly ahead her hands in her coat pockets.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t try to make conversation as this whole situation felt alien, Hermione propositioned him to go to his house to fuck. What in gods name happened to the swotty sidekick of the savior of the Wizarding world. Other than said saviour dying at the final battle, he had seen how utterly devastated Hermione was when Voldemort and Harry both dropped as their spells killed each other. He knew she and the Weasel became a couple when the war had ended. Then she had vanished six months after the battle. The Wizarding World had settled again, slowly rebuilding from the ashes, pardons were handed out, and Ginny had given birth to Harry’s son in December, she married Blaise Zabini and had two more kids and was pregnant with her fourth. All of which caused an uproar in the community.</p><p> </p><p>“You frown when you think,” Hermione observed.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes well, Ginevra Zabini does that to a bloke.” Draco gruffed.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny..... is she doing well?” Hermione thoughts went back to her friend.</p><p> </p><p>“As well as can be expected heavily pregnant with her fourth in what? Six years.” Draco looked out of the cab as brightly lit shop windows glide past.</p><p> </p><p>“She takes after her mum, sprouting so many.” Hermione felt happy, knowing Ginny found some calm and peace. She was heartbroken, much like herself.</p><p> </p><p>“No Weasel for you?” Draco looked at the blue-haired beauty in front of him, her coat had fallen open, showing her creamy white thighs, a short pleated tartan skirt ending mid-thigh.</p><p>“We were done fucking each other brains out finding we had no conversation between us when we didn’t hump.” Hermione didn’t meet his eyes, staring out of the window.</p><p> </p><p>Draco knew a lot of couples resorted to carnal pleasures after the war, it was what drove Ginny and Blaise together, sexual attraction and redemption would do that. He had fucked himself in a stupor, that and Muggle recreational drugs. Luckily he had found Muggle condoms, so he had no offspring to be a testament to stupidity.</p><p> </p><p>The cab halted at a large terraced house in Mayfair. “This is me.” Draco stepped out of the black automobile, reaching inside to grab Hermione’s hand. Chivalry went a long way with her, and she let him help her out. Draco paid the driver. The conversations that man heard, his face as blank as an empty book.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione peered upwards, the house was covered in white paint, two coulombs next to the door, a small staircase leading down. Black and white tiles and a potted plant next to the front door, all very upper-class Muggle. No enchantments like Grimmauld place, this was a Muggle facade. Draco pushed the door open, he used wand-less magic, that and blood wards.</p><p> </p><p>“One thing Malfoy, we fuck, but we don’t kiss, understood?” Hermione stood there, waiting on the pavement.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine by me.” Draco shrugged his shoulders, this was as surreal as it would come.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione pushed past him as she walked in. A large hallway with a round table. A pretty nude girl dancing cut out of marble placed tastefully at the center.</p><p>Draco opened a door leading into a small vestibule for coats, Hermione handed him her coat. As it turned out she changed when she retrieved her coat in the personnel lounge, having put a skirt and an over the shoulder jumper over her tank. She appeared to have some scruples about her attire.</p><p> </p><p>Draco made his way to the grand staircase, “The bedroom is upstairs he gestured.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you always vanilla about fucking in the bedroom Malfoy? You could have bent me over the table in the hall and be done with it.” Hermione skipped after him.</p><p> </p><p>“I have my condoms upstairs, it’s a matter of hygiene darling.” He could be aloof as the next guy.</p><p> </p><p>“I have some in my bag.” Hermione quipped. She followed Draco as he went up, checking out his arse in his jeans. She liked his physique, they would probably have a good fuck session, maybe they could do the rough, angry variant.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pushed his bedroom door open, revealing an ample empty space at the back of the house. None of the Georgian styles here, it was a free space with a large bath, shower cubicle, and a toilet behind a niche. Al large metal four poster bed standing against a wall, no curtains as it appeared he had trees in his spacious garden, it wasn’t overlooked by other houses.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione dropped her skirt, pulling her sweater and tank over her head, revealing ravishing breasts. Tattoos ended above her breasts, ran between them and continued under her mounts. Barbels pierced in her buds. Her nipples standing proud. Stepping out of her shoes, sauntering over to Draco. “Do you like what you see, big boy?” She stood close taking in his light grey eyes, his smirk firm in place. She put her hand behind his neck, placing a kiss on his strong jaw, her other hand trailing down his front, cupping his erect manhood through his jeans. “I guess you do.” She sauntered away, sitting on his bed, her legs wide open.</p><p> </p><p>Draco kicked his Chelsea’s away. Unbuttoned his dark blue Oxford, he had a black shirt under it.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione hissed as she looked at his arms. His Dark Mark standing prominent against his underarm, another tattoo depicting a clawing Dragon wing on his upper arm and ending on his elbow. Intricate muscles needled expertly on his marble skin. Draco’s gaze lingered on her as he peeked from under his hair. “See, I wasn’t party-crashing I belonged there as much as you do.” He pulled his shirt over his head as he stalked over. Revealing more tattoos on his right pectoral. He stood before Hermione. Surgical steel barbels pierced in his nipples, they beautifully matched Hermione’s. “Undo my jeans.” He ordered the pretty brunette turned blue on his bed.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione did as he told her, admiring the black picture on his body. “Parliament?” She unbuckled his belt, tugging it from its loops.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm, Parliament.” A growl emanated from his throat. They obviously visited the same tattoo team.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione flicked the buttons, he had no zipper. Revealing a rather hefty bulge in black silk boxers. She licked her lips, gazing up to a broody blonde. He was well defined, his muscle tone not too heavy but his v-line dipping handsomely in his trousers. Hermione licked his stomach, making her way down his boxers. Lowering his waistband, springing his seizable dick free.</p><p> </p><p>“Suck it, Granger.” Draco’s voice sounds ominous. His hard-on was almost painful, he wanted those blue lips on his knob.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione lowered her mouth, cupping his balls as she engulfed his cock with her mouth. He was larger than most, hearing him hiss as her tongue probed his slit was tantalizing. She pulled his jeans further down. Revealing a black mamba circling his leg, it’s mouth open wide, fangs protruding ready to strike. Hermione released his cock as she kissed the snake, “stunning.” She admired the craftsmanship that went into drawing each scale. She went back to swallowing his member, helping him lose his jeans and boxers. She bobbed her head as she gazed up to him with hooded eyes. His hands grabbed her by her hair, pulling her closer to take him deeper.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck Granger, so good.” He moaned as he fucked her face. He held her head in a vice-like grip. “Okay, stop, or I’ll cum.” He warned her. He wasn’t to come down her throat he wanted her sitting on him, admiring those pretty bouncy tits as she humped him.</p><p> </p><p>He lost his socks and jeans and laid down on his bed.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione discarded her knickers, she had no tattoos under it, the lightning bolt the only thing connecting the ink on her stomach with the ink below her hips. “That would be Potter. “You fucked Potter?” He asked as he pulled a condom from his bedside table. Covering his dick.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione lowered herself over him, impaling herself. “Yes that is Harry, and he was my first, we fucked when Ron left us in the forest, we fucked every night and day until Ron came back and saved him from the pond.” Yes, she and Harry were very intimate, dancing in the tent as Ron had left, leading her and him taking each other’s virginity. She knew he loved Ginny, but their connection went deeper. When he was killed, her heart was ripped to shreds. His lightning scar the second ink she had done, it was all black, because it tore her soul when he died. Having Draco inside her like this, filling her to capacity as she reminisced about Harry was bizarre, his dark Mark on his arm so close to her memento making her mind go blank. She started to rock her hips as Draco cupped her breast, playing with her barbels, tugging at them.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes glazed over as she talked about her raven-haired lover, she went far away as she bounced on his dick. Draco could tell she was somewhere inside her head. Retreating as her body tried to purge her heavy heart. “Oh, fuck Granger, yes.” He was about to come, but he could wait for her if she did.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione knew how she could tilt her hips to cause friction on her nub, she needed her high, forgetting about Harry, fucking Draco in the process. “Mmmm, oh, yes, yes, yessss....” Hermione groaned. Her walls fluttered and contracted.</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt her cum around his shaft, he could spill himself. “Fuck yeah.” He growled. Fuck she was a good lay, best he had in a while.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione slumped over his chest, keeping him lodged inside her. Their bodies slick with sweat. “Mmm, that was good Malfoy.” She was dead tired, it would be nice to just close her eyes for a moment. Hermione dozed off in a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>Draco felt Hermione slump against his chest, her even breathing indicating she had fallen asleep. This all was unconventional at best when he had a one night stand he would take off in the night, maybe Granger would do the same. He could just close his eyes and sleep a bit, feeling her boobs against his pec was a good feeling anyway.</p><p> </p>
