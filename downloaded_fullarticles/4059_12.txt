      </p><p align="left">I dreamed of 19 last night.</p></div><div><p>I have no idea why.</p></div><div><p>You and I haven't spoken in ages.</p></div><div><p>Maybe I dreamed of <b>you</b>.</p></div><div><p>Maybe this time <b>I</b> was 19.</p></div><div><p>Gale was there.  Dean too.  But he's been right there with us since this whole thing began has he not?</p></div><div><p>The details are a bit fuzzy now but...everything was on fire, and we were lost. You were screaming at us to move, to get out of the house as it fell around us but...all I could help thinking was that I was finally home.  That the flames were where I belonged.  The heat and the chaos were my family.  Weird isn't it?</p></div><div><p>I guess this my punishment then.  I got tired of playing second fiddle...of never being good enough to get us all through to the end, and so I killed you first, and the goddess of chaos offered me a deal.  Your eternally damned soul, no regrets, for one last chance to get it right.  I would have a chance at happily ever after with someone I didn't know, and you would burn in the gold blood realm for the next hundred years.</p></div><div><p>It sounds SO SIMPLE, doesn't it?</p></div><div><p>It's not.</p></div><div><p>I didn't get my happily ever after.  And now I never will.  Augustine died two weeks ago.  He had an aggressive form of brain cancer and...by the time we found it...</p></div><div><p>Time was all we had left.</p></div><div><p>Not even time enough for a hastily thrown together wedding.</p></div><div><p>Now I am doomed to walk this earth alone for the rest of eternity.  All because I was too wrapped up in myself to see that I was wrong too.</p></div><div><p>I never once got over my fears.  I never once truly tried to make us work.  I know we could have.  If not for me.</p></div><div><hr/></div><div><p>Remember when we were ten feet tall and bullet proof?  When we would stay wasted for days just to get the pain to stop?  When we made a pact to leave this world together?</p></div><div><p>I do.</p></div><div><p>I remember it <b>every day</b>.</p></div><div><p>'You shouldn't have told me no," you said with a sneer as you gave a cruel laugh and turned to walk away.</p></div><div><p>You're right.  I should have gotten over myself...before it got to where we are now.</p></div><div><p>Now you are free and I am forever doomed because I went to that wicked temptress and told her I wanted to cancel my end of the deal we had made.  That you deserved to be free, and I deserved to be trapped in hell.</p></div><div><p><em>I am in hell</em>.</p></div><div><p>I see you with her and I think of what the two of us could have been...if only I was different.</p></div><div><hr/></div><div><p>I dreamed about the house again.</p></div><div><p>This time it was only you and I.  Still trapped.</p></div><div><p>I told you I would never be good for you.  That all I was was a poisonous leech...but you never would listen to me.  I don't know why.</p></div><div><p>I pulled you close.  Held you so tight I wondered if you could breathe...and prayed to any god above that would listen to take you from this certain death and keep you safe.  Keep you alive.  You deserve to live, Seamus.  You deserve a long and happy life with a beautiful wife and precious children.  A few close friends and a job that gives you a sense of satisfaction.  You deserve few worries and many rewards.  You deserve to see how perfect you really are.  How much you mean to the world in which you live.</p></div><div><hr/></div><div><p>"Marry her, Seamus," I said to you in the middle of the pouring rain.</p></div><div><p>You and Kayla had had a knock down drag out fight, and you had left.</p></div><div><p>"Go back, and <em>tell her</em> you are SORRY and <b>marry her</b>!" I pleaded.</p></div><div><p>"I don't want to!" you screamed.</p></div><div><p>I couldn't tell if the water streaming down your face was rain drops or tears.</p></div><div><p>"Please---"</p></div><div><p>It's all I had.  I had no strength left to fight you.</p></div><div><p>"I won't keep you here," I said softly.</p></div><div><p>"I won't let you live this life."</p></div><div><p>I had given everything up for you, because a long time ago, you did the same for me.</p></div><div><p>"I l---"</p></div><div><p>"Don't!" I spat, the venom heavy in my voice.</p></div><div><p>"You <b>can't</b> love me!  I won't let you!"</p></div><div><p>My insides were on fire.  I was a sacrificial pyre and it was time to bow down to the gods that I served.  The spiteful, evil. vindictive devils that they were.</p></div><div><p>"Forget about me," I forced myself to say.</p></div><div><p>"Forget you ever knew me.  Forget anything you ever felt for me.  Go back to Kayla and tell her you are sorry.  It is time for you to move on.  I'll even give you a ring.  An early wedding present if you will."</p></div><div><p>19 was coming for me and he was fighting hard to break free.  Him and I both knew what he REALLY wanted.</p></div><div><p>You.</p></div><div><p>"Please!" I whispered in agony.</p></div><div><p>"I...I can't hold on...19."</p></div><div><p>"What?" you asked in wide eyed surprise.</p></div><div><p>"19," I whispered.</p></div><div><p>"He's...he's coming..."</p></div><div><p>"No..." you breathed.</p></div><div><p>"Get your happily ever after," I begged as my insides began to combust.</p></div><div><p>"Go be free."</p></div><div><p>"Kaelyn..."</p></div><div><p>"Go!" I screamed.</p></div><div><p>"Get away from me!"</p></div><div><p>It hurt.  By the gods did it hurt.  It was a pain I had never in my entire existence felt, and I wondered briefly how you fought through it as many times as you did.</p></div><div><p>"Seamusssss...." I hissed as I hit my knees.</p></div><div><p>These were definitely tears.  On your face, and on mine.</p></div><div><p>"I love you Seamus..."</p></div><div><p>And as I watched you fall to the ground in defeats, I ended this millenia long fight on my terms, not even feeling the pain of the knife shoved in my chest.  I knew that you were free, and I would not be suffered on this world for another hundred years.</p>
