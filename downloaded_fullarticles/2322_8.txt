    <p><strong> <em>A/N:</em> </strong> <em> This fic can be read alone to some degree (this first chapter was meant to be a one-shot). But it also pairs nicely with the one-shots Sweet and Bitter &amp; Interrogation (in that order) as prequels. They will be referenced in very small ways.</em></p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus Dumbledore,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter finds it’s way to you and finds you well.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is without a doubt that you have come into possession of our troth. I feel it in your presence. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Though I must admit that it has been a long 2 years of waiting. You know well how to break it, it is not a pleasant procedure, but you do know. And so every moment I find myself on edge, waiting for that feeling to come. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But it never has. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You have left me in a cruel state of limbo. If that was your intention, I must congratulate you. Your sadistic strategy is effecting me and my plans in ways I can no longer ignore. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>At times I find myself thinking that it would be best if I just gave up. But of course we both know I will not concede so easily. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I offer you a trade. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>You will come stay with me, see what good my work is doing for wizard kind, allow me to remind you of why that vial should be in my possession. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>If after a week you fine it necessary, I will listen to whatever end you wish to see me to: Prison, death, or anything else.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I trust you know where to find me,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Gellert Grindelwald</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The two stood still.</p><p>This would be their first time meeting in almost 30 years. Words hung on their lips, words that had been lying in wait.</p><p>Albus tried his hardest to speak but he was sure he appeared more like a fish out of water.</p><p>Luckily Gellert was practiced at pushing away his feelings, “You have received my letter.” He nodded at the paper in the other’s hand.</p><p><em>Unfortunately.</em> Albus wanted to say, but nodded instead.</p><p>Gellert walk to him.</p><p>The auburn haired man stood, defensive, ready for anything.</p><p>The motion caused the blond to stop, understanding he did not yet have the privilege, he had not proven himself trustworthy despite Albus being willing to answer his call, “And?” He asked, trying his hardest not to sound as eager as he felt, “Do you accept my proposal?”</p><p>“Why am I really here, Gri-Gellert?.” Albus took a determined step forward, “To be forthright, I am upset you would take such an indirect method with me. Just tell me what you are expecting from this bargain of yours.”</p><p>It was hurtful, Gellert had always been upfront with the other and time itself did not change that, “It is exactly how it is written. Stay with me, see what we can do together. If in a week’s time you still believe these plans unworthy, at that time I will do as you wish. You can take me to Azkaban yourself.”</p><p>Albus winced, that was the last thing he wanted, “And what of your acolytes? What do they think of this arrangement? Surely they did not join you, leave their homes and families, just to be thwarted by a single word.”</p><p>Gellert did not respond for he was confident … or an impulsive fool. “Tea?” The dark wizard offered, as though it was the most natural thing in the world, as though nothing had changed, “After so long I believe I have perfected it.”</p><p>Through his tone Albus could tell that Gellert had never lost hope that he would one day join him once more, and so he had never stopped his futile attempts to make tea according to Albus’s specific taste.</p><p>From Queenie’s reaction, Albus was unsure if it was wise to partake, “Please.” Still he accepted, finding himself unexpectedly interested in the other’s progress, “If I am to make things fair for you, I will try my very best to be open in this next week.”</p><p>Gellert’s eyes lit up, and in that worn man Albus saw-</p><p>The blond muttered something under his breath and summoned a kettle and two cups.</p><p>“I told you your hair would turn white from too much coffee. At least I hope it was the coffee and not the tea you are about to serve.”</p><p>Gellert smiled ever so slightly at the memory they shared, “It is not the tea.” He assured.</p><p>And though the tea must have been prepared beforehand, the kettle still seemed steaming hot.</p><p>“I have some conditions before I agree completely.”</p><p>The words froze Gellert, the cups set themselves on a nearby table as Gellert turned his full attention to the other, “Anything.” He motioned to the chairs so that they may discuss in comfort.</p><p>Albus took a deep breath, not waiting to sit before listing his stipulations, “Do not speak to me about my family. I will give you only a week before we reconvene to speak of what happens next. Regardless of what happens I do not wish to see you in Azkaban…” He took a deep breath before carrying on, “You must be honest in your plans, you cannot change anything to gain my favor. And lastly, I know you cannot harm me but, you must assure me that none of your followers decide to gain your favor by ending my life. Is there anything you would like to add?” The speech had been well practiced.</p><p>“Those are your only rules?” Gellert questioned, also finding his seat.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with those rules?”</p><p>“I just figured there would be more.”</p><p>“Those are plenty. Trust that I thought them through carefully before this moment.” Albus replied with certainty, putting an end to their back and forth.</p><p>Gellert straitened in his chair, “Of course I accept, you have my word.”</p><p>The word of a dark wizard would mean very little to most, but Albus accepted it, he looked at the kettle.</p><p>The look alone stirred it into motion.</p><p>As it pored a cup for Albus he took note of the color, it was a nice amber shade, the smell of black tea was strong but also sweet. He took the cup into his hands, feeling it’s warmth.</p><p>“This has been a side project of mine for almost 30 years.” Gellert explained, watching with bated breath.</p><p>Albus shook his head, “Ah yes, a side project of tea making to counterbalance attacks on muggles, murder and other various attempts to break the-“</p><p>“You said you would try.” Gellert reminded him.</p><p>“Sorry sorry.” He chuckled, taking a sip.</p><p>It was … strangely…</p><p>Blue eyes looked up to regard the hopeful gaze that had never once left him.</p><p>“It’s perfect.” Albus took another long sip, strengthening the statement, “In fact I might just stay with you so that I will never be without such tea.” He spoke without thinking, quickly looking to Gellert, hoping his words had gone unnoticed.</p><p>They hadn’t and Gellert did not look the least bit amused by the joking statement. It brought forth a close memory, a memory of a single night of nothing: of rooftops, tea, and promises…a promise he had kept. Gellert had kept all of their promises.</p><p>The tea.</p><p>Their plans.</p><p>His word.</p><p>His-</p><p>“I’m s-“</p><p>“We are meant to go to Rio de Janeiro.” Gellert quickly informed, cutting him off, finding himself in a bad mood, “We were planned to be there for more than a week, but of course we will follow your rules, how long we stay will be up to you in the end.” He stood, setting down his cup. He had never cared for sweet things anyway. “Take your time finishing the tea and gathering your things. We leave in the morning. I will inform the acolytes of your presence and let them know what punishment awaits should they cause you any discomfort.”</p><p>Albus would normally be glad to finish this kind of tea, but instead he too put his cup down, “Gellert.” He followed the other on impulse, not wishing to see him leave…not again, not yet.</p><p>Gellert turned back, looking into blue eyes that held both fear and guilt, “From this point on, if only for a week, we will be together just as before.” He told the owner of those eyes, “Of course you will stay in shadow as to not be associated with us. After all, there is a chance that after this week you will return to the world of the light.”</p><p>“Just as before?” Albus asked, still stuck on Gellert’s earlier words.</p><p>“Yes, just as before. We can pretend all we wish but, this is as much your revolution as it is mine. I trust you have noticed that I have never strayed from the plans we made so long ago. Not once.” He stressed, “Take charge in whatever ways you see fit.” Gellert pondered for a moment, shifting through the other’s hopeful words, “For everything is the same with the exception, of course, that you will not have to worry about me joining you in your bed.”</p><p>Albus raised a questioning eyebrow at him.</p><p>“I would not want to have an unfair advantage to sway you.” Gellert answered both serious and testing.</p><p>“You think highly of yourself.”</p><p>Gellert approached him, “If memory serves I think I have the right.”</p><p>“I am not so easy to sway.” Albus tried to defend, unwilling to back down despite the loss of space between them.</p><p>Gellert had never known personal space.</p><p>“It is part of your deal. Show me why I should stay, all of it and don’t change a thing.” Albus reminded, “If you- If we had never parted, show me what that life would have been like. Whether it pulls me in or reminds me why I should turn you in, that is for me to decide in a week’s time.”</p><p>A kiss, far less magical than he remembered as a very young man… for he was not a young man. But a kiss it was and just as sweet, for it was a contact he had foolishly longed for for so long.</p><p>When they pulled away, a voice spoke.</p><p>“I’ve truly missed this, missed you beside me.”</p><p>Neither could tell from whose mouth the words left. They were words that had been left unspoken for many a year and were finally set free, shared in the space between their lips.</p><p>“That tea has taken 30 years to perfect. Please finish it before it grows cold.”</p><hr/><p>
