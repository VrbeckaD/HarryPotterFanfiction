    <p>Hermione Granger snuck around the corridors of Hogwarts, hiding behind corners when she thought she heard the soft footsteps of Mrs. Norris. No cat, though; her mind was probably playing tricks on her, though it wasn’t uncommon for the castle to make noises of its own. Hermione was out late sleuthing, having looked for clues in the restricted section. She ducked behind another corner, thinking she heard another noise, cursing under her breath she hadn’t snatched the Marauder’s map from Harry. She peered from behind the corner before she was startled by an all too familiar voice.</p><p>“Hiding from something, are we, Ms. Granger?” Professor Snape drawled.</p><p>Hermione jumped a little, caught off her guard; her head turning to look at Snape.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows expectantly, face nearly blank, if not for the slightest of smirks, “You know…” he said, looking down at her, “for a know-it-all who speaks out of turn...you think you would know better.”</p><p>To Hermione, his words almost were as piercing as his dark, black eyes. Still, she felt a twang of shame. “Professor, I—”

</p><p>Snape cocked his head, almost like an owl would, studying her quizzically. Hermione shrunk back at his critical gaze. She hated how Snape didn’t even have to say anything for him to be intimidating. Just his presence and body language alone spoke volumes.</p><p>“...well?” he coaxed.</p><p>“Okay. I don’t have a suitable explanation for why I’m about the castle at this hour,” she admitted, avoiding eye contact with him while saying this; her eyes focused on the ground. She didn’t want to divulge the truth of her visiting the restricted section.</p><p>Snape seemed to notice her lack of eye contact, “Look at me when you speak to me.”</p><p>Hermione slowly looked up at him. Her eyes met his; deep, penetrating, hypnotic. She had to look away, a soft blush springing to her cheeks.</p><p>“Ms. Granger,” Snape said, “Look at me.”</p><p>Hermione breathed in, heavily embarrassed now, worried if he had seen. How would she explain that? It was nearly impossible to get a read on Snape; she never knew what he was thinking. She mustered up the courage to meet his gaze.</p><p>“...there,” he said, calmly. “Now...was that so...difficult?” Hermione loved how Snape took the time to enunciate his words; it made him sound so intelligent and made each word he spoke that much more meaningful. There was a lot about Snape that she fancied, but would never tell a soul. Now though, looking into his eyes, she felt a pull to him.</p><p>“Professor…” she breathed, looking up at him, “please, let me make it up to you."</p><p>Snape sensed her pull towards him and didn’t move, partly because he didn’t know what to do; this had never happened with a student before. Instead, he smirked, feigning an air of arrogance, “You really <em>are</em> a silly girl, Ms. Granger.”</p><p>Hermione blinked, snapped out of her trance. Her eyes fell to the floor, “Right...silly.” Her voice was soft and put-out, unlike what Snape had ever heard before. He mentally cursed in his mind.</p><p>“Well, if I’m just a “silly girl”, then I really ought to be heading to my dormitory now. It’s past my bedtime, isn’t it?” Hermione snapped back. Snape looked genuinely taken aback.</p><p>Before Hermione could storm off, Snape grabbed her wrist. She spun around, only to be met with cold lips on hers. Her eyes widened, caught by surprise, taking in the sight of who was kissing her. She pulled away, “Oh, <em>now</em> you want to kiss me.”</p><p>Snape looked at her flatly, “Ms. Granger, I assure you anyone in my position would have approached with caution, regardless of personal feelings.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, “Calling me a silly girl though? Still? It’s been six years since you first called me that, is that all I am in your eyes? A girl? Or am I a know-it-all, too?”</p><p>“You are a silly girl...and a know-it-all,” Snape replied, “however...admittedly...I have always found it to be endearing coming from you, Ms. Granger.”</p><p>Hermione felt her stomach flutter, almost like a golden snitch was trapped inside. She was thinking of what to say when she heard a soft pitter patter of footsteps, undoubtedly this time from Mrs. Norris. Snape seemed to hear it, too, his head turning slightly.</p><p>“Return to your dormitory at once,” Snape said, ushering Hermione to go. She nodded and turned, scurrying away. She looked back at Snape and could barely make out a contented smirk on his face before disappearing into the darkness.</p>
