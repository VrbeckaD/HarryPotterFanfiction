    <p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a blandly cloudy, grey Tuesday morning and when Mrs. Verona Evans peered out the window of number four, Privet Drive and there was nothing about the sky to suggest that very soon strange and mysterious things would be happening all over the country. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a light breeze and the occasional sprinkle of chilly misting rain and as such Mrs. Evans selected a very proper grey pantsuit with a pressed white shirt for her office attire. Feeling that if it was too hot in the office she could doff the jacket easily enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She selected from her sparse jewellery box the string of pearls that her husband, Mr. Peter Evans, had given her for her anniversary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was a short, round-faced woman with hardly any neck, whose more-than-generous bosom preceded her like the prow of a ship. In contrast, Mr. Evans was thin and blond and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in handy as he spent a great deal of his time craning it over fences and around buildings to take pictures of celebrities in order to sell them to the papers and on the internet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Evans' had a small daughter called Daisy and in their opinion there was no finer girl anywhere.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The Evans' had everything they’d ever wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. And if that were to happen, well, they didn't think they could bear it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Their secret had to do with Linden Evans, Mr. Evans' brother. Although the brothers had been close when they were children they hadn't met in several years. In fact Mr. Evans often pretended he didn't have a brother, because his brother, and his insouciant jezebel of a wife, were as irregular as Mr. and Mrs. Evans were normal. That was, they were highly irregular indeed.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The Evans' shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if Linden Evans and his wife arrived in the street. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Evans' knew that Linden and Jane had a small daughter too, but they had never seen her. This girl was another perfectly good reason for keeping away; they certainly didn't want their precious Daisy mixing with a child like </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning at her reflection critically in the mirror Mrs. Evans smoothed a hand over the front of her pants where the button was straining and sucked in her gut a little. It didn’t do much good. Sighing she fluffed her hair a bit and smudged her lips with a modest amount of colour before heading downstairs with her jacket folded over her arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hung the jacket on the peg by the door and scooped a whining Daisy up out of her playpen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you hungry, precious?” she cooed at her daughter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Daisy squirmed and tugged on her mother’s hair and then she spat her binkie out and began to wail. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr. Evans was in the kitchen, unbothered by the noise, humming as he reviewed a thumb drive filled with photos of the latest young starlet in flagrante delicto with a member of parliament at least thirty years her senior on his computer, and Mrs. Evans barked out a sharp scold to: "Put that bloody machine away and feed your child!" as she wrestled a screaming Daisy into her high-chair.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>At half-past eight Mrs. Evans picked up her briefcase, pecked Mr. Evans on the cheek, and tried to kiss Daisy goodbye but missed, because Daisy was now having a full-blown tantrum and throwing her cereal at the walls.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>"Peter, darling, your daughter is screaming, put that away, I mean it! I have to get to work!" Mrs. Evans repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It earned her a grunt of acknowledgement but Mr. Evans didn’t look up from his computer. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mrs. Evans shrugged into her smart, grey blazer and slipped her pudgy feet into her sensible heels and rushed out the door.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>She got into her car, it was new, a shiny silver station wagon, and backed out of number four's drive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Evans was the personal assistant for the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills and she dearly loved her job. She was the second most important person in the London office without all the fuss and bother of actually bothering with drill manufacturing, which suited her just fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she rolled up to the corner of the street she noticed the first sign of something peculiar—a cat reading a map. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a second Mrs. Evans didn't realize what she'd seen—then she jerked her head around to look again. There, standing on the corner of Privet Drive, was a tabby cat. But there, of course, wasn't a map in sight.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. Behind them Mr. Number Six honked the horn of his moss green sedan and she was obliged to move forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Mrs. Evans drove around the corner and up the road, she watched the cat in her rearview mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive—no, looking at the sign; cats, after all, didn't read maps </span>
  <em>
    <span>or</span>
  </em>
  <span> signs.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans gave herself a little shake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too much coffee, old girl,” she told herself firmly and put the cat out of her mind.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As she drove towards town she received a call from the vice-president's assistant, and, popping her Bluetooth into her ear so that she could talk freely, she allowed herself to be distracted by the latest company scandal.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>But, on the edge of town, the factory manager, Mr. Winslow’s, latest faux-pas was driven out of her mind by something else.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As she sat in the usual early morning snarl of commuter traffic, chatting with Wendy, the vice-president's assistant, she couldn't help but notice that their seemed to be a great deal of strangely dressed people about.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Wendy are you seeing all this?" she asked her friend, her voice taking on a clear note of disapproval as she took in all of hideous outfits adorning the passersby.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"If you're talking about the ridiculous profusion of cloaks about this morning then yes, I've seen them."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"I can't abide people who dress in funny clothing!" Mrs. Evans' exclaimed, "The getups you see on young people nowadays!"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"It's just a stupid stunt, Verona, someone will remind them that Halloween was yesterday right quick, no need to get your knickers in a twist," said Wendy, the vice-president's assistant, a hint of laughter in her voice.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mrs. Evans frowned out her front windshield. Although she did consider Wendy a friend, the woman could be shockingly liberal for someone who was meant to be the vice-president's own personal assistant. Some days she had no clear notion of how Wendy had managed to make it as far as she had with her attitude.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"I suppose," she agreed reluctantly, all the same, since she didn't want to start a row in the middle of traffic, before the day had even properly begun.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Look Verona I have to go, Mr. Sanders is in. I'll talk to you later. Try not to let them bother you too much."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And with a soft boop the line disconnected.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Still obliged to wait to move forward, Mrs. Evans tried to occupy herself by drumming her fingers on the steering wheel and her eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were all whispering excitedly together.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans was quite incensed to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why that woman had to be older than she was, and yet there she stood wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of her!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then it struck Mrs. Evans that this was probably some silly stunt like that nonsense with the tape for those homosexuals and the little pink ribbons everyone went around wearing last month to raise money for cancer or somesuch—yes, these people were obviously protesting or collecting for something.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The traffic moved on and, pleased with her deductions, Mrs. Evans arrived in the Grunnings car park a few minutes later, her mind already upstairs at her desk.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mrs. Evans always sat facing into the hall at the sweeping reception desk just outside the director's office on the ninth floor. If this wasn’t the case she might have found it harder to concentrate on sorting her emails and appointments for the day.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As it was, she didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gawped open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl before in their lives, not even during the nighttime.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans, however, had a perfectly typical, owl-free morning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She made several trips to the staff-room on the twelfth floor for coffee, yelled at five different lollygaggers from accounting, made several important telephone calls, and shouted a bit more. She was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when she had the thought to stretch her legs and bit and walk across the road to buy herself a bun from the bakery.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She'd managed to forget entirely her annoyance with the people in cloaks until she passed a group of them next to the baker's. She eyed them angrily as she passed. She didn't know why, exactly, but they made her uneasy. She drew her purse closer to her side although it offered nothing in the way of protection and she doubted anyone would be so bold as to try and take it from her in the middle of the crowded street, no matter how oddly dressed.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>This bunch were whispering excitedly too, and she couldn't spot a single flyer, form or collecting tin. The slackers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was on her way back past them, clutching an extra-large jelly-filled doughnut in a bag, that she caught a few words of what they were saying.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>"The Evans'--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stopped in her tracks.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's right, that's what I heard, yes, it was their baby daughter, Geranium—"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Evans felt herself go very pale, all the blood freezing in her veins. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced back at the whisperers and thought of saying something to them, but thought better of it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She all but dashed back across the road, hurried up to her floor, snapped at the intern who was hovering around her desk, no doubt hoping to ply her with coffee, and barricaded herself in the staff washroom.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>She had her mobile phone out and it was vibrating in her palm letting her know that she was in the process of calling Mr. Evans before she had a chance to really think about what she was doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Abruptly she hit cancel, changing her mind. She tucked the phone back into the inner pocket of her blazer and smoothed her trembling hands over the front of her trousers, brushing away invisible flecks of dust, thinking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> She was being stupid, she decided. There was no doubt that the funny people in cloaks were the sort of unnatural folk that her brother-in-law surrounded himself with, there were few enough people in the world with the name Geranium that coupled with the surname, Evans, they couldn’t be talking about anyone except her young niece. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>However, there was no point in worrying Mr. Evans. It wasn’t any of their business what that sort got up to. They’d never even met their niece for all that Linden had sent a photo and a letter when she was born. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, there was no sense telling him. Mr. Evans always got terribly upset at any mention of his brother. She didn't blame him either, if she'd had a brother like that she wouldn’t have been half as forgiving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Still, she found it considerably more difficult to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when she left the building at five o'clock sharp she was still so worried about the whole mess that she walked straight into someone just outside the door.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Oh, I beg your pardon," she said stiffly, as the tiny old woman stumbled and nearly fell.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was a few seconds before Mrs. Evans realized that the woman was wearing a violet cloak embroidered with pink posies. She didn't seem at all put out about being nearly knocked to the ground. On the contrary, her face split into a wide grin and she said, at a volume that suggested at least partial deafness and made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear girl! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has been defeated at last! Even muggles like yourself should be celebrating on this most joyous of days!"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then the old woman tossed her wizened arms around Mrs. Evans and squeezed her around the middle with a sudden fierceness and tottered off.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mrs. Evans stood rooted to the spot. She had been hugged by a complete stranger and she was also quite certain she'd been called a muggle, whatever that was meant to imply, and people were </span>
  <em>
    <span>staring</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Hurrying to her car she set off for home as quickly as possible, hoping against hope that she was simply imagining things, which was something she'd never hoped before in her life because she didn’t approve of imagination.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She drove carefully and kept her eyes fixed forward. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>As she pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing she saw—and it did nothing at all to improve her mood—was the tabby cat she'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on her garden wall. She was positive it was the same cat, it had precisely the same funny markings about its eyes that made it look as though it was wearing specs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shoo!" said Mrs. Evans at top volume. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She considered picking up a stone and tossing it at the wayward feline but since Mrs. Number Six disapproved of violence against animals she refrained. The cat, for its part, fixed her with a stern look and didn't move so much as an inch. Was that normal cat behaviour? Mrs. Evans wondered, tucking her hair behind her ears and trying to pull herself together.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Fumbling for her keys she let herself into her house. She was still determined not to mention anything to her husband.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mr. Evans had had a nice normal day. He arrived home at half-six with take away and told her over dinner all about the scandal that was about to erupt on the news because it had been discovered that some foreign actor had been engaging in relations of a carnal nature out in broad daylight, and how Daisy had learned a new word ("Shan't") and had been using it all day at the daycare according to Mrs. Polkiss.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans tried her best to behave as though there weren't anything amiss and when Daisy had been given her bath and put to bed she had almost regained her equilibrium and went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:</span>
</p><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>"And finally, bird-watchers across the country have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving most unusually today. Although owls typically only come out to hunt at night and are almost never seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sighting of these birds, flying in every direction, since sunrise this morning. Experts are unable to explain this sudden radical change in behaviour, but, as usual, they are cautioning that it might be a side-effect of global climate change." The newscaster allowed herself a grin. "Most mysterious. And now, over to Jen McGuffin with the weather. Are there going to be anymore showers of owls tonight, Jen?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Well, Tess," said the pretty weathergirl, "I don't know anything about that but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today, I can tell you that much. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Well, we certainly can't chalk that up to global climate change now, can we? Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early—it's not until next week folks! But I can definitely promise you a wet night tonight as we get a cold front rolling in from the northeast—"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Mrs. Evans was glued to the settee. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying in broad daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks wandering about town? Combining all those different things with a whisper about her niece and it didn’t bode well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Mr. Evans came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something. A bit nervously she took a sip of her tea and cleared her throat.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Er—Peter, dear—you haven't perchance heard from your brother lately, have you?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As she'd expected, Mr. Evans was both shocked and angry. After all, they had entered into an unspoken agreement in the early years of their marriage to pretend as though he didn't have a brother.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"No," he said sharply, setting his teacup down with a definitive clink, "Why?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Nothing to concern yourself with, darling," Mrs. Evans hastened to reassure him, "It was just some funny reports on the news, and there were some people in town today—"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"So?" snapped Mr. Evans.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>"Well, I just had the thought that it might—potentially—have something to do with…well, you know. </span>
  <em>
    <span>His lot</span>
  </em>
  <span>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was as indiscrete as Mrs. Evans was prepared to be even in the privacy of her own living room. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mr. Evans' brows drew together most forebodingly and he didn't even look at Mrs. Evans for a long while. Mrs. Evans wondered if she dared tell him she'd heard the name Evans being bandied about by the people in cloaks? Another darting glance at his face told her that she didn't dare. Instead, she took another fortifying sip of her tea and asked, as casually as she could manage, "Their girl—she'd be about Daisy's age now, wouldn't she?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"I suppose," said Mr. Evans stiffly.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"What was her name again?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Geranium, our mother picked it,” sneered Peter, “A terrible name for a child, if you ask me."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Evans, hear heart sinking horribly, "Yes, you're quite correct, dear."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She didn't say another word on the subject but the atmosphere in the living room remained tense. Mrs. Evans just counted herself lucky that he hadn't gone straight for the gin after she'd been bold enough to make a mention like that.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>When they went upstairs to bed, though, Mr. Evans locked himself in the bathroom for a good long while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mrs. Evans slipped into her nightgown, the flannel one with the ruffles that Mr. Evans liked because in was soft and flattering, and crept over to the window, peering down into the front garden for the second time that day.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The cat was still there, haloed in the orange light from the streetlamp, standing stock still and staring fixedly down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Was she really sure she wasn't making more of this than it was? She didn’t think so but maybe she was a little too close to the matter, after all, if it got out that they were related to a pair of—well, she didn't think she could stand it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The bathroom door swung open and Mr. Evans emerged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, darling?” Mrs. Evans asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just fine, Verona,” he snapped, lips pursed into a thin, unforgiving line, “Let’s just go to sleep.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<span>They got into bed.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Mr. Evans fell asleep quickly, his hands fisted in the excess material of Mrs. Evans' nightdress, snoring quietly against the back of her neck. But Mrs. Evans lay awake, her mind conjuring all kinds of horrific scenarios with nothing to distract her. Her last, and only comforting thought of the day before she fell asleep, was that even if her in-laws just happened to be involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mr. Evans.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Those two knew very well what she and Peter thought about them and their kind. She could not see how she and Peter could get mixed up in anything that may or may not be going on—she yawned and turned over—it couldn't affect them…</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>How very wrong she was.</span>
