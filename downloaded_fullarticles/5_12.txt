    <p>
  <span>Harry's eyes caught a blur of platinum blonde running out of the Great Hall. It was him, he thought, I was right. Unconsciously, he'd started running after the other boy, trying to step as lightly as possible. Where were they headed? Where could Malfoy possibly go on the second-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stood behind the closed doors of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He wanted to barge in, to curse Malfoy for what he'd done to Katie. Just as he was about to do so, he heard something that made his hand freeze on the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sobs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><em>No</em>, he chided himself, <em>don't pity him.</em></span>
</p><p>
  <span>But still, it <em>changed</em> something. Showed that Malfoy was... human. Harry was awakened from his musings as he heard a crash and the sound of shattering glass come from the bathroom and finally barged in there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was quite a sight. Draco Malfoy, pale as a corpse, was slouching over one of the sinks in the bathroom. The shards of what hadn't been glass, but a mirror, lay across the floor, and drops of blood dripped down onto a particularly large shard from Malfoy's right knuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon noticing his intruder, Malfoy quickly turned to face the door and raised his wand in his bloodied hand, but Harry acted first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Expelliarmus!" He couldn't believe himself. He'd followed Malfoy in here, thinking about using the worst spells he could muster up on the blonde, but a single moment seemed to have changed his mind without his permission.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked at him now, eyes full of... Harry couldn't read what he saw in those gray eyes at first. It wasn't hatred, not anger, not even the disdain he was so used to. It was something he never expected to see in Draco Malfoy's eyes- despair.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy did attempt to pull himself together and regain his usual demeanour, but that was hard to do when his face was a blotchy mess and he had to keep sniffing to stop snot from running down his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you want, Potter?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was you"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're going to have to be more specific than that" but the slight tremble in his voice gave him away</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You gave Katie the necklace"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not <em><strong>really</strong></em>"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop lying!" Harry raised his wand. Draco backed off a step.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't give it to her. I <strong><em>did</em></strong>, however, make someone else do it." He said as nonchalantly as possible. Harry's eyes widened at the sudden confession.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you have a death wish?" Green eyes searched grey for answers as he raised his wand once again, and saw fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Better you than <strong><em>him</em></strong>" Draco shuddered with the last word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Realisation dawned on Harry</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He's <strong><em>forcing</em></strong> you to-" but Draco cut him off, seemingly involuntarily. He seemed to have just... snapped. As he yelled, he continuously picked up shards of mirror and threw them at Harry, who put up a shield charm just in time. Draco didn't seem to care about his cut up hands, nor did he care that his efforts to stab Harry were futile. He just kept crying, throwing and screaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No shit, Sherlock! You think I want to be like this? Can't sleep, can't eat, can't do anything! Do you think I want to spend my second to last year of school as practically a ghost? I don't! I want to stress about grades and quidditch and cute boys, not about <em><strong>MY MOTHER'S FUCKING LIFE</strong></em>!" he stopped to take a deep breath. He wasn't crying anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you think I <em><strong>want</strong></em> to be branded like a filthy cow?" He rolled up his left sleeve so fast and hard that his fingernails left a trail of red in his pale skin, leading up to... the dark mark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't want any of this" the blonde had tears in his eyes again as his voice shook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't want to be a murderer"</span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They just stood there, for a long moment, and looked into each other's eyes. That is, untill, Harry broke the silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're still bleeding."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You still have my wand" Draco raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of throwing it back to him like expected, Harry walked over, raised his own wand and used it to clean and heal the cuts on the blonde's palms and knuckles. After he was done, he looked up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What if there was a way out? Would you take it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked sad</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"There is no way out. There is no escaping him. I'll either succeed and become the monster slave he wants, or I'll fail in which case I can't imagine what he'll do to me or mom"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Voldemort is not a god. He's a powerful wizard, yes, but he's not hard to con. Truthfully, he's just a bitter, overpowered old dude who never got over his puberty or daddy issues!" Draco looked at Harry in surprise. Not even Dumbledore would dare to speak in such a way about the Dark Lord. But Harry continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I met his youth through his diary in our second year. His real name's Tom, but he changed it because it was his muggle father's who abandoned his mom while she was pregnant. Dick move, but she had been feeding him love potion- so no one's in the right there." Draco still didn't seem to have any words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm telling you this, so that you see. He's only human. He's defiable, even <em><strong>defeatable</strong></em>. If you want a way out, we can manage something as the order. They'll manage to get your mom out too. Dumbledore's pretty smart."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you... sure-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of Course I'm sure Draco, for fucks sake, Dumbledore taught Vo-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure they'll help me? Us?" Draco blurted out. Somehow, although he was unprepared for the question, Harry knew exactly what to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Help, will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it." Another silent but charged moment passed, and finally Draco gave a slight nod. Harry grabbed the taller boy by the arm and yanked him towards the Headmaster's office.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, the password for the Gargoyle was unchanged from his last visit there so he managed to drag a faintly struggling- and visibly sweating- Draco up to the office without much trouble and banged on the door, likely harder than anyone had done in centuries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" Dumbledore sounded surprised and, slightly irritated. At the moment, Harry didn't care. He barged in, dragging Draco behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Professor! I need to-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mr. Potter, I believe I've already told you to leave the business with Mr. Malfoy alone? Why is it that you continue to feel the need to disregard my words on the subject?" Dumbledore's voice wasn't higher than normal, but he did seem a little angry to be bothered by this. Just then, Draco spoke in a small, but still distinct voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I've come toaskforyourhelp" he said, swallowing the words. When no one moved after a second, he sighed, looked up to meet Dumbledore's eyes and said, louder "I need your help?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore dived into his mind, and Draco let him. He let him see everything, but the one, small detail that it was the Headmaster himself that he'd been trying to kill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Lovely to see you've decided to stop your feeble attempts to kill me, Mr. Malfoy." The Headmaster smiled at the expressions of shock on each boys' face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I've known longer than you have- Voldemort told Severus first. But, alas, it must be he, who kills me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You want to be killed by the Dark Lord?!" Draco asked in surprise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore pretended not to hear him and changed the subject.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Now, Mr. Malfoy, what exactly do you need my help with?"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
