    <p>“Remus?”</p><p>It took a minute or two for the older man to answer, his breath even and deep as he lazily lounged next to you on the mauve love seat as you both usually did this time of night.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>His gruff voice made you smile into the air, placing a hand on his back as you opted to trace small circles and patterns on his skin for a few moments before answering him back.</p><p>“Let’s have a baby.”</p><p>You couldn’t remember a time you had seen your boyfriend move faster. His body a blur of mousy brown hair and deep collarbones as he breathlessly struggled to place himself upright from his previous position on your lap.</p><p>“E-Excuse me?” His voice was a bit wild, frantic even, but you barely blinked at him, lifting a finger up to move a stray piece of hair from his face that was distinctly blocking his left eye.</p><p>“Lets have a baby.” You reiterated what you said, a bit slower this time, as if it was needed, you knew he had heard you.</p><p><em>He knew</em> that <em>you knew</em> that <em>he had</em> heard you.</p><p>His face looked a little clammy as he pulled his lip between his teeth for a moment, analyzing your own face, sighing loudly when he found no trace or evidence of humor playing on them.</p><p>“We-Y/n, we...” Remus lamely finished, watching as you barely spared him an eyebrow raise.</p><p>“I would like one. They seem so soft, so <em>squishy</em>.” Musing, you brought your hand up to rest on your chin in thought, mind fluttering with excitement as you gently thought of having one of your own with Remus.</p><p>“Y/n, I don’t think-I don’t think that’s wise.” Remus whispered, averting his gaze to the floor in apprehension.</p><p>If you hadn’t dealt with Remus’ consistent self doubt and deprecating behavior for almost 3 years now, you would’ve felt rather crushed at his statement. Instead, you only shrugged.</p><p>“You didn’t think getting married was a good idea either.” Countering, you knew you had a one up on Remus as he began sputtering again, mind racing a mile a minute.</p><p>“That was <em>different</em>! Marriage was... it was different. I-You don’t deserve the have the extra burden of carrying a child from someone like me, I’m-“</p><p>“This sounds vaguely familiar, were those your wedding vows?”</p><p>Remus glowered at you for a moment, before sighing and resigning to sitting next to you on the sofa instead of on you.</p><p>“Rem, I’d like to have your baby. I love you, I love us,-“ You began, feeling slightly sorrowful at Remus’ sudden outburst of nerves and unrest. “And I know you’d be an amazing father. Regardless.”</p><p>Your soft voice filtered like honey through Remus’ ears, placating his nervous nature a bit.</p><p>“You believe that?” Remus questioned, asking it as if it was the most ludicrous thing in the world.</p><p>You turned your head to look at him better, bringing a small and fluttery hand to his soft cheek, fingers rubbing smooth patterns on him again.</p><p>“No, I <em>know</em> that.”</p><p>He melted like butter into your touch, sighing something beautiful, before his previously shell shocked eyes bored into yours, now a more peaceful and serene look to them.</p><p>“They are... quite cute, I suppose.”</p><p>You grinned at Remus’ response, opting to lean in and kiss him lightly instead of responding.</p><p>The kiss deepened, and you both shrugged next to each other before continuing; after all, there was no harm in getting a head start.</p>
