    <p>Hermione was finishing up packing the remainders of her childhood home when Headmistress McGonagall apparated into the kitchen and began to speak.</p>
<p>"Hello Hermione, I was just coming to see how things were going and to speak with you about things concerning the re-opening of Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"Dear Merlin!" Hermione yelped. She had forgotten all about Professor McGonagall's visit today. "You gave me quite a scare Professor." Hermione said as she walked into the kitchen "Tea?" She inquired. "Yes please."</p>
<p>Hermione got down the two remaining mugs as Professor McGonagall sat down at the table and started to talk "I didn't mean to startle you. I should have sent an owl to remind you of my visit today. How are you doing dear?"</p>
<p>"I'm okay" Hermione replied as she handed the Professor her tea which McGonagall accepted but gave Hermione a doubtful look as she took a sip, giving her no choice but to recant her statement.</p>
<p>"Fine. I'm not okay; None of this is remotely okay! I'm 18, I just fought in a war, and now I am packing up my HOME! I have yet to figure out how to reverse the memory charm on my parents, but at this point is it even worth it? They have new jobs, a new home, they've established new lives!"</p>
<p>At this point, Hermione had tears streaming down her face. "You're the only one who knows Professor. I've kept it a secret for so long because I didn't want the others to feel bad, especially Harry. You and I both know that he would try to take the guilt for my decision."</p>
<p>Hermione sat down at the table and hung her head. After hearing this confession, Professor McGonagall placed her hand on the young woman's shoulder. "You have such wonderful and supportive friends Hermione, not to mention Molly Weasley. You know just as well as I that she considers you a part of that family. Harry as well. You don't ever have to do this alone, especially in times like these we need the help, love, and support of others to heal and rebuild."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded and wiped her eyes. As she straightened up she asked, "You said earlier that you wished to discuss the re-opening of Hogwarts with me?" hoping for a change of subject. Professor McGonagall noted the subject change and she allowed it, but she hoped for Hermione's sake that she told someone.</p>
<p>"Yes, now I know that term does not start for another seven days, but I would like to hold a gala in honor of the re-opening, but also to honor those we lost. It would be open to all returning students and their families, as well as the staff. I've already sent out owls notifying Prefects, but the Heads will be announced at the feast."</p>
<p>Hermione opened her mouth to ask a question but McGonagall shook her head "No, I will not tell you who they are." Hermione pouted a bit which made the Professor laugh</p>
<p>"I know he hates the attention, but will you talk to Harry about speaking?" Hermione nodded, "I'll try, but he has already threatened to hex Kingsley if he doesn't stop signing Harry up for these events and appearances. He'd probably do this for you though besides, Hogwarts is his home."</p>
<p>McGonagall nodded "Of course. Also, I am going to need some help setting up. Would you be willing to help? You may also enlist Ginny to help as well."</p>
<p>Hermione smiled "I'd be happy to Professor! I'll be sure to mention it to Ginny when I arrive."</p>
<p>"Excellent! Now after the gala, all returning students are staying at Hogwarts. My 8th years, such as yourself, will meet with me to discuss some things the following morning. You then would have the rest of your Saturday free to do as you please. We will take in the first years Sunday evening."</p>
<p>"This is such a wonderful idea Professor! I do believe it will be very beneficial to the returning students to have some time in the castle before the first years arrive. It's going to be overwhelming and it's going to take some adjusting. Might I suggest having some calming droughts and dreamless sleep available? We don't know how students are going to react or how they have been dealing with things this summer. It would be good to have those things available to those students so when first years arrive, they don't scare them by having nightmares or feeling anxious."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Headmistress nodded in agreement. "That's a brilliant idea Hermione. I'll go speak with Madam Pomfrey and take a trip to St. Mungo's to see if they have other suggestions about what we can do to make this transition easier. As much as I hate to leave, I must be off now. These things won't get done on their own you know."</p>
<p>As she stood up she spoke again "Also, Hermione, remember that everyone is here to help you. No doubt about it, so don't shut everyone out. They're here for you."</p>
<p>Hermione gave her a small smile as she gathered both mugs to place in the sink. "I'll have my office Floo connected to Molly's. See you soon."</p>
<p>With that being said, she disapparated leaving Hermione alone once again. After all, that's what she felt nowadays. All Alone.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was in the living room when his owl came in and perched on the armrest of the couch with an envelope. Inside the envelope was a shimmering gold invitation as well as a supply list with a note attached to it. He put the list aside and began to read the invitation. It read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Dear Mr. Malfoy and Family,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>You are cordially invited to the 1<sup>st</sup> annual Hogwarts Celebration Gala. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Please note that returning students will be required to stay after the gala. Term starts Monday.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Dress is formal.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Minerva McGonagall</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Draco put the invitation down and picked up the supply list. He separated the note that was attached and read that there was a required meeting for all 8<sup>th</sup> year students at 11 a.m. on Saturday morning. He rolled his eyes and put down the note.</p>
<p>“We’ve been invited to a Gala mother!” Draco shouted into the sitting room. “That’s wonderful dear!” Narcissa exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I guess so, it’s for the reopening of Hogwarts. McGonagall is requiring that all returning students stay after the gala until the start of term. A bit of rubbish don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Draco scoffed. It wasn’t the fact that they had to stay, in fact not only did that part make sense but he was also glad for it. He was a bit more nervous about the fact that he was going back to a house full of people he had to face. His mother’s voice interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Now Draco darling, you’ll be just fine. I think that it’s splendid that McGonagall is putting all this effort into this gala. I think it will do well for students to go early. It’s going to overwhelm the majority just to attend the gala, nevertheless attend for the school year. They’re going to need time to adjust.”</p>
<p>Draco slouched a bit in the chair. He hadn’t given much thought to that but he truthfully tried not to think about it at all if he could help it, especially the war.  He hated that so many people had been hurt by his father. They lost family members, been tortured, and even cursed by him.</p>
<p>He was thankful that not only was his mother never involved but also that she was brave enough to go against the Lucius and the Dark Lord as well as become a spy for the Order. He was even more thankful that Lucius was in Azkaban and that Potter had killed the evil bastard once and for all. He sat in the chair thinking about all of this until he had dozed off.</p>
<p>He woke up a couple hours later exhausted and just wanting to find a bit of peaceful sleep.</p>
<p>“Mimzi” Draco called</p>
<p>“Yes Master Draco?” she replied appearing before him with a respectful bow</p>
<p>“Would you please make me a mug of hot tea with a tinge of dreamless sleep mixed in.</p>
<p>“Yes Sir, right away” With that, she disappeared with a snap. Draco bid his mother goodnight and headed to his room. He knew that tomorrow was going to be a long day and he didn't need to be kept up late with nightmares, well <em>the</em> nightmare. The one nightmare that haunts him nightly whenever he doesn't take dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>When he reached his room, he magicked himself into a pair of silk pajama pants. Thankfully Mimzi had his tea already waiting on him. <em>I don't pay her enough</em> he thought. As he drank his tea, he allowed his thoughts to wonder about who would and wouldn't return this year from Neville to Luna, Weasel-bee, Potter and She-Weasel. Draco shuddered remembering how nasty her Bat-Bogey hex was. He definitely did not want to be on the receiving end of that again.</p>
<p>His thoughts wandered a bit longer before landing on Hermione. He knew without a doubt that she would be returning. She had an insatiable thirst for knowledge and by merlin was it annoying. It was as if that was the only joy that she got out of life. He rolled his eyes and finished his tea.</p>
<p>As he put the mug on his nightstand and got settled into bed, he wondered about the Slytherin’s who would return, and of those, who would speak to him. Being the son of Lucius Malfoy was bad enough, but to the other pureblood families, Draco and his mother were considered traitors since they walked out on the Battle of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He knew that Blaise would be returning which was a great relief to Draco when he found out. Blaise had similar beliefs to Draco. Blaise had no interest in blood status or politics and had been obliging just as Draco had to ensure his and his mother’s lives. <em>At least I’ll have a friend upon returning</em>. That was the last thing that he thought of as he drifted off to sleep.</p>
