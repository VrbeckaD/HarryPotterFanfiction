    <p>Teddy Lupin stares at the unfamiliar girl from across the Hufflepuff common room. He looks at her long brown hair in a tight low ponytail, she's staring down at her herbology book. Teddy squints, brows furrowed trying to figure out precisely who she is.<br/>
She glanced up, eyes locked on his, that unrecognizable, hazel pair of eyes. Teddy knew almost everyone in the school. Is she a new student? Or did Teddy just never noticed her? This frustrated Teddy, just like difficult potions homework.</p><p>	Teddy was snapped out of his thoughts, as he noticed the hazel-eyed female pacing toward his direction, he took a swift look around to see if anyone else were there and if she was walking towards a friend, instead of him.<br/>
“Hello.” greeted the unnamed Hufflepuff. Teddy was startled by her American accent.<br/>
“Hey, who are you? ?” Teddy replied. She giggled.<br/>
“So many questions?” she said with a wide smile. “I just noticed you were staring at me. Diana Sky, the second year, remember?” Diana held out her hand, to be shaken.</p><p>	“Absolute pleasure, names Teddy Lupin.” Teddy grinned, standing up next to her, but ignoring handshake. Teddy was known to be quite the playboy at times. Teachers have many times found him snogging people behind a broom shed, each time a different person. Diana was pretty attractive in his eyes, he wouldn’t mind a little snog one in a while with her. “So, how come I’ve never seen you before?”<br/>
“You’ve never noticed me, wow, I just thought you forgot my name?” she looked flabbergasted, maybe she thought the questions were a joke. “ I'm friends with Lily, do you know at least know her?”</p><p>“Albus’ sis? You’re her friend?” Teddy asked. He didn’t mean to be offensive, honestly, he was just surprised. He saw Lily sometimes, not much, mostly when they were discussing whose prank cost the most points. He never saw Lily with Diana, neither did Albus or James ever mention her. Teddy glanced back to his charms, losing interest.</p><p>	“Well okay, if you don't want to talk to me.” Diana looked as though she was offended. “You could’ve just asked me to go instead of implying that I’m so unimportant you’ve haven’t noticed me in the two years in been here, and that you’ve noticed my best friend but not me!”<br/>
Diana turned around so fast her hair struck Teddy’s face. Teddy let her walk away, let her blow off steam. He knew she would come racing back to him, begging, for forgiveness, like the other ladies.</p><p>	Teddy went through the portrait hole to meet up with James, Albus, and Scorpius to prepare their next prank. He had been considering stealing one of the Ravenclaws bookclubs book-of-the- week. He could almost imagine the look of dread on their faces as they frantically look in different places. He could almost see their dismay as they walk into the Great Hall, looking frantically around, for their beloved book.<br/>
He entered an empty unused classroom when...</p><p>	“Ted’! Hey mate, you’re late, again.” yelled a voice. It was James. He was smiling cheerfully. He patting an empty spot next to him. “So, who’s the lucky girl today?”<br/>
“What? There’s no lucky girl.” Teddy replied.<br/>
“One, whenever you’re late it’s always because there's a girl your snogging or flirting with. Two, your wairing that grin when you’ve met a smokin' girl.” Teddy couldn’t disagree with James. He always lost track of time when he was with a cute girl. The glowing facial expression Teddy was wearing was because he remembered a Honeydukes sale this weekend. Diana was a somewhat alluring girl but wasn’t his type. He likes girls glamorous, social, tall, and someone who wasn’t two years younger than him. Diana was petite, plain, and so, so complicated. Teddy was used to seeing through a girl from the first glace, Diana was different, whether in a good or bad way, was unknown.<br/>
“Hello, Teddy? Earth to Teddy!” Scorpius said, waving a hand in front of Teddy’s face.<br/>
“Wow, must have been some girl to have left you spacing out,” Albus said. “Who was she?” Albus looked curious. Teddy was almost sure Albus didn’t know her, it was like Diana always wore an invisibility cloak.<br/>
“I didn’t snog anyone I’ll have you know,” all three of them looked at him in disbelief. “Calm down, I'm not dead, I just met a girl not dying to date out me.”</p><p>	James patted Teddy’s shoulder in a comforting way, he slowly looked up and met Teddy’s eyes and said: “That, my friend, is a rejection.” Teddy playfully punched James’ arm. “But still, Ted’ I want to know who the delightful girl is.” Teddy sensed a trace of mockery in his voice.<br/>
“She got offended when I said I didn’t recognize her when she’d been there in this school for two years,” The other three still staring at Teddy waiting for an answer. “Her name is Diana Sky.”<br/>
Albus and Scorpius' mouths hanging open. They gave a glance at each other concerned. Teddy and James looked at them in wonder, what exactly are they thinking about?<br/>
“ Average height, brown hair, and eyes, Hufflepuff?” Scorpius questioned.<br/>
“ Yeah, that’s her!” Teddy exclaimed. “You guys know her?”</p><p>	SLAM!</p><p>	Just then the door was slammed wide open to unveil Diana in all her glory. With a blank face. She allowed her eyes to drift from Scorpius to Albus, then to James. Her eyes grew as she noticed the blue-haired metamorphic boy.<br/>
“You wanted to meet with me, Albus?” she questioned. “I didn’t know he would be here.” Her eyes glaring at Teddy. Teddy looked at Albus and Scorpius with a look that was of shock. He didn’t know anything that the Gryffindor and Slytherin couple had planned.<br/>
“Glad to see you again Diana.” Scorpius set out a hand to shake. Diana looks surprised, as though she was puzzled by the fact that polite students like Scorpius would ever interact, let alone be friends with Teddy.</p><p>	“Hey, aren't you Lily’s friend? James wondered out loud. Diana took a piercing glare at James Diana said: “Is that the only thing people know me for?” Diana was as silent as the rest of the room (really quiet) after the remark. “You know what? I don’t even know what I'm doing here! Thanks for wasting my time!” Diana turned to walk away, stomping to show her obvious irritation.<br/>
“Wait, we would like you to help us with a prank please!” Albus blurted out.<br/>
“What?” proclaimed Teddy and Diana. “Why do we need her?” finished Teddy. Again it didn’t occur to Teddy how Diana processed the question. Her face turned red with either pure fury or annoyance, Teddy will never know.<br/>
“Whatever!” Diana said. The female stormed out of the room in a rage.</p><p>	“Thanks, a lot you guys,” Scorpius said in a bitter voice. “ Do you even know how useful she can be? After seeing Teddy's and James' look of doubt, Scorpius explained: "She's the one who kept the food fight running last week, she knows how to keep wars going!”<br/>
“She helped with pranks with the "Great Prank War" with Lily last year!” Albus continued. “We thought we could use some help defeating Rose and the other girls, so we encouraged her over to help us out with our next prank.” It was obvious that the couple was trying their best to convince the other two what an asset Diana could be.<br/>
“Does she always have to be that short?” James muttered.<br/>
“She’s nice depending on your first impression,” Albus explained. “She okay with me and Scorpius, but she hates you guys.”</p><p>	“Well, I think she just sits there useless, but still taking credit when it benefits her! Teddy accused.<br/>
“She just never got caught, the time the Great Hall was filled with bubbles wasn’t Merula Sickler, it was Diana, Lil’s told me,” Albus explained.<br/>
“But we overheard Professor McGonagall scolding her saying she heard her voice explaining how everyone’s gonna freak when the professor was about to catch her. Her Scottish accent is impossible to copy!” James said. “She couldn't have copied Merula’s voice!”<br/>
“She has a few things that can be helpful to us, her spotless record, her fourth-year level charms ability, and her skills at deceptions and trickery,” Scorpius stated. “She could be extremely useful to us if we can have her on our team soon.”<br/>
Scorpius soon explained how the “other team” are taking time for themselves, they aren't fighting, but they all needed some alone time. Albus explained how getting the other girls to get on their side will be impossible, but Diana has a chance to be convinced before they “regroup”. Teddy glanced at James and groaned. They both understood that they have to get Diana on their side and that they had to be friendly to her.</p>
