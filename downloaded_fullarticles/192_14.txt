It reflected his desire for Harry. Harry's reflection served to trigger the spell. Snape caught on fairly quickly, but he waited for Harry to figure it out. He watched the boy torment himself and began to wonder if Harry's silence meant that Harry himself wasn't sure of what he felt. It was hardly up to him to decide Harry's feelings for him.</p><p>The longer Harry stared in front of the mirror, the more certain Snape became. He could've smashed the mirror. But instead, he decided to be the dominant influence in Harry's mind. Unwilling to endure the boy's guilty silence a minute longer, he grabbed him and held him facing what should've been their reflection. Harry tried to turn his head, but Snape grasped his jaw and made him face the image while he pulled the boy's back against him. With his other hand, he pulled Harry's shirttails from his pants and burst the opening of his fly with a large, invasive hand that dug for what it wanted, pulling it out into the open. Harry tried to conceal himself but Snape trapped his arms. Lucius didn't deserve to see it, but it served as bait.</p><p>In the mirror, Lucius' reflection noticed. It arched an eyebrow. It saw the boy's legs kicked apart. Saw him bent to conform to Snape's body from behind, his back keeping contact with Snape's chest. From many miles away, through his spelled reflection, Lucius saw the impact of the first thrust. It heated Harry's cheeks. He greedily watched Harry's eyes glaze over and his mouth remain open for the duration of ecstasy that kept him impaled on Snape's body. He saw the way Snape played Harry's body, masterfully reducing him to helplessness as he drove himself up through Harry's core. Lucius had to swallow at Harry's pale skin and red mouth, as the boy was reduced to semi-consciousness, having to bear the power lifting him off his feet.</p><p>When it was over, Harry could not stand. His gut locked from spasms and he crumpled between the impact of both wizards and their demands. Snape held him like a prize won, and Lucius's reflection realized that it no longer held any version of the boy at all. Harry's image had faded from the mirror, and Lucious' arms were empty. Harry turned in Snape's arms, and reached up for his neck. The last thing Lucius saw, was Snape withdrawing his wand as Harry clung against him. The mirror shattered. On the other side of it, in his manor, Lucius got the point.</p><p>End.</p>
