    <p>Ardeth's Intro to the beginning of The Mummy (but with a twist)</p><p>Thebes. City of the Living. Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First. Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed to touch her. However, there was another that lived in the city, favored by the gods and goddess's, favored by the Pharaoh himself, a man who had eyes so dark they looked like onyx, hair so black it was the night sky, but his face was regal like that of the old Pharaohs. A dancer to the gods and goddess's of Egypt and by Pharaohs decree no one was allowed to touch him save for his own servants and a few of the Priests and the Pharaoh himself. Many thought he was a reincarnation of the old kings, but he denied them. The man was tall and lean, graceful yet deadly like the cobra. Many men fell into lust over him and many grew jealous. This mysterious man who has conquered many a heart but only his heart had been conquered by one man. </p><p>Time has been changed.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Severus Snape was currently at the Ministry with Albus Dumbledore. Why he was there was because there were potions that were needed and Dumbledore wanted him to go along. As they were heading out Dumbledore needed to go to the DOM and drop off a time turner that he had found in his office amongst all his things. As they went along Severus couldn't help but feel that something was going to happen and he wasn't going to like it.<br/>As Dumbledore was about to give the time turner back he accidentally dropped it onto the stone floor. As it hit the ground it activated and the Unspeakable that was going to take it yelled out, "Run!". Severus and the Headmaster started to run but Snape was caught by a torrent of magic that engulfed him and as Albus tried to reach him he was gone in a flash of white light and the time turner with it.<br/>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Severus landed on the ground with a hard thud and he felt the air leave his lungs at the impact. He groaned and let himself lay still as he could get his breath back. As he started to feel the ground though he felt sand and that it was burning hot! Severus yelped and instantly got up to stand on his shaky legs. He looked around and saw palm trees and in the distance a city that was bustling and possibly even bigger that London.</p><p>Severus got up and shook the sand off of himself. He happened to glance down and saw that the time turner was broken. He still had his wand but now he had no way to get back home.</p><p>Severus walked towards the city and as he walked he noticed the clothes the people were wearing and the stares he was receiving by many people. As his mind began to turn in thought he happened to look ahead and gasped at the beautiful sight before him...large obelisks, pyramids, and temples were before him and he then looked once more at the people he was surrounded by, thin linen clothes and golden jewels, boys had a side braid, and many were naked (it was custom in Ancient Egypt due to the heat). </p><p>Severus knew now as a fact that this wasn't anywhere he had ever been and that the time turner had taken him all the way to Ancient Egypt.</p>
