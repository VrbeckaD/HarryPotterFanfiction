    <p><strong><em>His fingers burned ice cold</em></strong> as they gripped his wand, eyes searching through the dust while his mind screamed<em> Malfoy Malfoy Malfoy</em> at him. He froze as the stairs creaked under his weight, hoping that they wouldn’t collapse all of a sudden, making him go down with them. As he spluttered and coughed at having walked into another cobweb, his fingers itched to cast a cleaning charm on the whole shack. But he restrained himself, knowing that he couldn’t risk alerting Malfoy to his presence by using magic.</p><p>Another step, another creak. Harry winced and wrinkled his nose as a fly settled on it. ‘Malfoy better be hiding in here, and all of this sneaking about better be worth it,’ Harry thought just as he stumbled and hit his side on the railing that he should’ve been holding. At that particular point in time, Harry didn’t even know why he was bothering to pretend like Malfoy wasn’t aware of Harry’s presence in the shack already—if Malfoy was actually in there in the first place.</p><p>Reaching the top of the staircase was a victory in itself for Harry, and so was the fact that he managed to remain sane through all of it. He shouldn’t have been celebrating just yet, though, because a familiar voice coming from behind him made him freeze on the spot.</p><p>“Potter,” it said. “I was hoping it would be you.”</p><p>Harry swallowed as something heavy seemed to crawl up his gut and lodge itself firmly in his throat. “Malfoy.” He took a deep breath to steel himself before turning around to face him. “It’s been a while,” he said, and it had been.</p><p>“Yes, quite,” Draco agreed amenably. He made no move to back away or fight Harry, which left Harry feeling unsure about his own plan of attack. “I must say, Potter,” Draco started, and Harry’s grip on his wand tightened as Draco dared to take a step forward, “you seem to have changed quite a bit since the last time we met.” Another step forward, and Harry didn’t move a muscle, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.</p><p>“I could say the same to you,” he retorted. He tried not to notice the fact that Draco seemed to have grown more attractive in the weeks since they had last met. His hair seemed to have gone wild, eyes more intense and lips as alluring as ever. Harry just wanted to rip all of his clothes off and take him right there—hard and fast. He wanted Draco to scream and writhe under him in pleasure, and then he wanted Draco to drive just as hard and fast into him.</p><p>“Indeed,” Draco said, and he was walking towards Harry now, taking quick, confident strides. Harry held his wand up, although a little hesitantly, stopping Draco’s advances on him.</p><p>“Let’s not play games, Malfoy,” Harry said. “You know why I’m here and you know that you’ve been caught, so give up.” It was he who was advancing on Draco now, and the git only smirked, his smirk growing wider as Harry placed his wand at the base of Draco’s neck.</p><p>Draco tilted his head slightly with curiosity. “Which spell will you use this time, Potter? Surely, it would get a bit repetitive if you used the Sectumsempra spell this time.” Harry flinched at Draco’s words, and that moment was all Draco needed to turn him around and twist his arms behind his back. He held them with one hand, Harry’s back pulled flush against him as he pointed Harry’s own wand at him. Harry gritted his teeth as he realised that he hadn’t even felt Draco pulling the wand from his grasp.</p><p>As the wand grazed Harry’s chin slightly, he tensed, wondering where Draco’s own wand was. “Will you be trying Crucio on me again, Malfoy?” Harry asked, his words barely a whisper, but he felt Draco’s arms grow a bit slack. Before he could do anything about it, however, Draco pulled him closer and Harry tensed even more as he felt Draco’s cock press against him through his trousers.</p><p>“Don’t even try to pull that same trick on me, Potter,” he warned, and Harry had to resist the urge to shiver as Draco’s hot breath hit his ear. It wasn’t just his breath though, even Draco’s voice, the sound of it, turned him on to unimaginable lengths. So, although he knew that he shouldn’t be, Harry was thankful that it was him who was trapped in that position and not Draco. “It won’t work.”</p><p>Realising that he had to get out of Draco’s grip, and fast, Harry made quick work of his reflexes, catching Draco by surprise as he broke free of him. He made sure that his wand was pointed away from his own face, and turned around just in time to see Draco Disapparate, taking Harry’s wand along with him.</p><hr/><p> </p><p><strong><em>His fingers burned white hot</em></strong> this time as they met with something warm and soft— skin, his mind supplied—and he felt lips latch onto his. He let out a quiet moan as hands caressed the sides of his body and a cock thrusted against his own. Light blond hair and pale skin swam into his vision as he came to the realization that he was naked, and so was the figure he was touching. It was a figure so familiar, one that filled Harry with such immense want and need, that Harry was lost to the feelings washing over him. He closed his eyes, feeling the smoothness of the skin, the dip between the shoulders, the heart beating below his fingertips and the body against his own.</p><p>“Draco,” he called out the name and gripped his naked waist as Draco thrusted again. He buried his face into Draco’s shoulder and then turned slightly to suck on the skin at the base of Draco’s neck.</p><p>Draco arched into Harry, throwing his head back to let out a groan, “Harry.” Harry gripped tighter, teeth grazing against skin as he thrust against Draco this time.</p><p>He blinked as his vision started blurring at the edges and the scene in front of him slowly began to fade. He could only hear Draco’s voice mingling with his own as they both came, gushing over each other before Harry’s vision faded completely and only one name remained on his lips.</p><p>
  <em>“Draco.”</em>
