    <p>     Albus Dumbledore was one of the brightest minds of his generation. His passion and craving for knowledge were almost matching in abundance. His achievements were praised all over the world and his name travelled from lips to lips until a legend of Albus Dumbledore was created. One in which he was a powerful, distant being that dressed in human flesh to walk freely among humans. He could carry mountains without uttering a single spell and he could charm a woman without ever being in her presence. People that had at least a quick conversation with Albus would exaggeratedly roll their eyes. They had no doubt about a touch of distance in his aura, but the pleasant smile and crooked eyes gave the impression of eternal kindness that only elder people could credibly pull off. The dissonance between those two contrasting impressions is most visible in Albus' eyes. They were piercing and soothing at the same time, sharp, yet, distant, flickering between blankness and shadows. They seemed kind, but somewhere below the surface of conscious emotions, they told a story of anything but kindness.</p>
<p>     However, this is only one part of the story. One of many opinions that people have, people who do not understand - those who pass him on the street or have heard about him in stories that merely overlap with the truth. They call him names and try to define by imposing superficial frames. <em>Golden boy, brilliant mind, a prodigy</em>. And maybe, just maybe his whole persona did not fit in any frames. Maybe his very being overlapped any human boundaries proving once again that Albus Dumbledore was above mere human beings. Aberforth would snort if he heard it. He would dismiss the idea and complain about this selfish, arrogant <em>pri-</em>. Maybe Aberforth went the wrong way to try and define his brother, but he did have a point. Maybe all the views we hold create a person. Maybe we all see a different person and the truth cannot even be reached. Maybe even those closest to us do not always see us for who we are.</p>
<p>     Who knew the real Albus Dumbledore? The question can be directed at individuals, at those who knew him, who created a version of him that they accepted as the real one. Are we simply reflections in the mirrors of other people's souls? Maybe, but maybe there is so much more. Maybe different reflections of Albus all hold a grain of truth.</p>
