    <p>Darren and I had kept in more regular contact after Christmas, given the events with Clara and what was happening in Japan, I thought it best to keep up with my brother and make sure he was staying safe. Ruben was beginning to hate the long journeys so I began using the floo network to send Darren messages.</p><p>     Remus had been notably happier than I'd ever seen him, always with a spring in his step, a kind word to my parents when he visited. My mother took a real liking to him and it made me all the happier for it.</p><p>     My birthday had crept up sooner than I expected and Jack and I had a joint celebration when he could get a day off work. My parents were kind enough to hold it at the house and just about everyone I knew had made an appearance. Even the minister had given me a card that morning when I'd been leaving the ministry.</p><p>     ‘Last year of being a teenager Lockwood.’ He chuckled. ‘Make it a good one.’ Fudge gave me a quick wink and wandered back towards a group of wizards he'd previously been dealing with. I'd been asked to consult on a few cases the Aurors office was dealing concerning werewolves and a few other creatures over the previous four months and it had Benji and myself being sent to various parts of the country to either interrogate or investigate what was happening.</p><p>     I caught up to him just as we were leaving the ministry to head back to my house. ‘That's nice of the minister.’ Benji pointed to the card as we began fighting through the crowds of people leaving work. </p><p>     ‘I guess with all the work we've been doing, it's more a thanks than anything.’ I smiled shaking my head. It had been a tough few months for Benji, he was desperately trying to settle into his life with Jocelyne and keep her happy whilst also working hard on his career. Benji had ambition and I admired that in him, he looked up to Kingsley more than anyone and as a result kept a more open mind about things. His temper had cooled somewhat as well, it was no longer the little things that frustrated him, but he credited Jocelyne with that particular achievement. </p><p>     ‘So, small piece of news that might interest you,’ he said just as reached the exit of the ministry, getting ready to apparate. ‘Kingsley has put in a request to make me an expert in lycanthropy.’ We were suddenly in my back garden and I hugged my friend so tightly.</p><p>     ‘That's amazing news!’ I laughed.</p><p>     ‘If it goes through it will be.’ Benji pulled away almost in tears at the news. ‘I'll be the only one in the department, so it'll all go through me, anything to do with werewolves in the country, I'll be the one dealing with it and with Jack providing healing input… well, we can finally make an impact.’</p><p>     ‘I can't believe it, I never thought this would happen, ever.’ I smiled, unable to stop.</p><p>     ‘It also means a pay rise and I can take Jocelyne somewhere nice in the summer.’ Benji continued as we headed toward the busy house. ‘I need you and Jack to do me a favour though, I'm trying to make it a surprise, so I can't exactly just walk up to her and ask where she wants to go, will find out a couple of places she'd like to visit and et me know so I can start planning?’</p><p>     ‘Of course I will.’ I nodded, still smiling. ‘Thank you for coming.’</p><p>     ‘I'll always be here for you getting old Angie.’ Benji winked and went to find Jocelyne. </p><p>     Remus had found me and given me a quick kiss whilst I was talking to David who had managed to get a week off to spend travelling with Cassie. Remus gently ran his thumb over the base of my spine as we stood talking about various things that had happened since the wedding. </p><p>     Cassie still had yet to become accustomed to her ex professor being at most of the social gatherings she went to, but she was getting used to it at least. </p><p>     The celebrations went on well into the evening and soon mine and Jacks parents brought forth a huge wolf-shaped cake and we were both ushered towards it and laughed.</p><p>     ‘Make a wish.’ My mother said kissing the top of my head. I thought for a moment I could hear the whispers of other people telling me to make a wish as well, but most people were just smiling and waiting for us to blow out the candles.</p><p>     Everyone cheered and began enjoying the celebrations again. I even saw my dad and Lily Potter dancing while my mother and James laughed at them. Remus had stayed close and on occasion would give me a small kiss on my cheek.</p><p>     ‘Happy birthday.’ He whispered close to my ear, once again placing a small kiss to my cheek. ‘I'm very proud of you Angelina.’</p><p>     ‘You're in a very good mood.’ I said raising my eyebrow slightly and attempting to open a whiskey bottle that Lyall had been kind enough to get me. ‘It's my birthday and even I'm not smiling as much as you.’ I managed to get the bottle open and began pouring two glasses. ‘So, why are you so happy?’ I handed Remus the glass and just watched him smiling for a moment.</p><p>     He took a moment and thought about what he was going to say. ‘One year ago today.’ He said it a little quieter so that no one could hear him. ‘I caught a glimpse of what happiness, true happiness, felt like… a beautiful young woman came to see me, it was her birthday and we shared a moment that I will never forget. It's the memory I use for my patronus, the most powerful one I have… that's why I'm happy.’ Remus half shrugged a little and sipped his whiskey.</p><p>     ‘You deserve to be happy.’ I said watching him carefully and leaning on my kitchen counter.</p><p>     ‘So do you, don't forget that Angelina, never forget that you deserve happiness just like the rest of us.’ Remus smiled at me and I felt him staring at me the way he used to when I was sitting in his office and we would have our chats.</p><p>     Eventually people began to leave, David and Cassie had made an early exit so they could catch a portkey to America, I loved seeing the both of them happy and would miss them. Jack and Tonks as well as Lily and James left soon after as did a few people who needed to go to work the next day. </p><p>     Remus was about to leave to get back to the castle when I thought I heard my father calling for me.</p><p>     ‘Yeah?’ I called back and wandered back into the living room to see him cleaning up. ‘I'll come back and help once I've seen Remus off.’</p><p>     ‘No rush, no rush.’ He waved his hand dismissing my help. </p><p>     ‘Did you need something just now?’ I asked.</p><p>     ‘No, I'm alright, just make sure Remus is alright to head back tonight. I know his physiology is a little different, but if he feels like the trip back is too much, he's very welcome to stay the night.’ My father assured me and I nodded hearing back towards the kitchen where Remus was helping my mother put the table back into the centre of the room.</p><p>     ‘There we are. Anything else?’ He asked, still with that cheery smile on his face.</p><p>     ‘You've done more than enough Remus, thank you for your help.’ She said and continued clearing away any rubbish. </p><p>     Remus picked up his jacket from the chair he'd left it on and I led him outside to the garden.</p><p>     ‘Something bothering you? You've got a bit of a frown on, you didn't enjoy yourself?’ He asked indicating my expression.</p><p>     ‘I'm fine, just tired I suppose.’ I sighed. ‘It's been a long few months.’ I gave a small smile and reached up to wrap my arms around Remus. ‘You'll see me in a couple of days anyway.’</p><p>     ‘You're coming to the school?’ I pulled away, but made sure he could still hold my hips against him.</p><p>     ‘To see Professor Sprout,’ I nodded. ‘She's going to give me a hand collecting a few of the nocturnal puffapods, she says they're a good fertiliser but that the plant only needs to grow in the fertilised soil, once its matured it doesn't really do anything. Thought it could be interesting to see if it can be used to help the flaring you said about.’</p><p>     ‘It's an interesting idea.’ Remus nodded. ‘Have you made much progress on it?’</p><p>     ‘Not really, its taking a bit more work than I'm used to. And with everything happening at the ministry… I'm just finding the moments to sit and think about it a bit few and far between. I'll get there though, don't worry.’</p><p>     Remus smiled and leaned down to kiss me goodbye. ‘I'll see you soon Angelina. Stay safe.’ </p><p>     It was a little easier to say goodbye to Remus when I knew that there was a chance to see him again approaching. When I'd gone back inside, my parents had just about finished cleaning up and I needed to sleep.</p><p>     The next couple days were spent relaxing in my back garden and tending to a few of the plants I had started growing there. It was nice to have a little time to myself and not have to think about anything other the task at hand. </p><p>     Jack had come over for lunch one day, we sat outside in the unusually warm weather and had leftover cake while we talked about some of the things I was working on. He was especially intrigued by the idea of reducing the flaring at the full moon.</p><p>     ‘If you could administer the anti flaring potion, or balm or whatever it ends up being, as soon as the infection occurs, they would stand a better chance of lessening the physical trauma sustained during the first transformation.’ He said as I sent the plates towards the sink to be washed.</p><p>     ‘That's the idea anyway.’ I nodded, knowing that Jack would get it. ‘That's one of the reasons I want to start experimenting with the nocturnal puffapods, Sprout has sent me the notes she's collected on the fertilisation of nocturnal plants and some of her ideas on how they grow underwater. Puffapods are usually found in open fields, so I'd like to see if I can grow some out of water as well as in water.’</p><p>     ‘Would it make a difference in the effects when used medicinally?’</p><p>     ‘Not sure, haven't thought that far ahead yet.’ I shook my head and took a deep breath of fresh April air. ‘There's a lot of work still to do and a long way to go, but there must be a way to do it.’</p><p>     We sat for a few moments more, just feeling the air and the sun on our faces. </p><p>     ‘Tonks and I broke up.’ Jack suddenly said and I whipped my head to look at my friend. There was a small amount of sadness to his expression, but it was a little off. ‘It's for the best I think.’</p><p>     ‘I'm so sorry.’ I wasn't exactly sure what else to say. ‘Are you alright?’</p><p>     ‘I'm fine… she and I just weren't… I suppose we just weren't well suited.’ Jack frowned deeply and tried to distract his attention to other things. ‘She told me she's in love with someone else and that it wouldn't have been fair for her to stay with me.’</p><p>     ‘Oh Jack, I'm so sorry.’ I leaned forward and tried to work out what it was I should have done. ‘Do you… we can talk about it if you want?’</p><p>     ‘It's fine.’ Jack shook his head. ‘Like I said, it's for the best.’ Jack took a deep breath and gave me a tight smile. ‘I'd best get back to the hospital. Thanks for lunch Angie.’</p><p>     ‘Anytime.’ I held Jack close to me and suddenly felt very sorry for him. ‘Write if you need anything won't you?’</p><p>     ‘Of course. I'll see you soon and let me know how the research is going, anything that can help during the cycle is a good thing.’ Jack headed up towards the end of the garden and waved before disapparating back to St Mungo's.</p><p>     I felt a little heavy for the rest of the day, thinking on how I would feel if Remus fell in love with someone else. I wouldn't know what to feel.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had been working with a few fifth year students out in the courtyard on their recent essay, when he spotted someone diving into the Black Lake, it could only have been one person.</p><p>     ‘Right, jinxes, counter jinxes and anti jinxes,’ Remus smiled and to his mild annoyance, it didn't go unnoticed by the three Ravenclaw girls he was teaching. It was far too warm for him to be wearing his teaching cloak or tie and he was vaguely aware of how tight his shirt was, it had been a growing insecurity since hearing one of his fourth year Hufflepuffs talking about it a few months back. ‘The essay only asks for definitions and examples, that is what you need to pass, however if you can go into detail and further explain uses for each of them, you'll be well on your way towards the top grades. Any other questions?’ Remus glanced towards the Lake and he knew it would be his undoing, he fully expected the Ravenclaw students to begin whispering about the woman swimming around in there.</p><p>     ‘Sir, do we need to include the historical figures involved?’ Casper Davenport had asked, he was the Gryffindor that had taken over entertaining the other students after Angelina had left the year before and also the one she had avenged when he was just a first year. Remus enjoyed teaching him, he had a great admiration for Angelina and desperately wanted to study werewolves further. He tried hard, worked hard and did his best to think around every problem and find a solution. He wasn't quite as intelligent as Angelina, but he was becoming a brilliant young wizard all the same.   </p><p>     ‘It's not essential for the essay, but for the exam you will want to put in one from each category and explain why they are particularly important in history. That, along with what we've covered the last few weeks will be enough to secure an O grade in the exam.’ Remus nodded and watched Casper jot down a few notes. ‘I think that will be enough for you all to be getting on with over the next few weeks, if anyone requires any further help on anything be it dark arts or other subjects, my door is open as usual.’ Remus smiled and picked up the book he'd been taking to the greenhouse for Angelina. </p><p>     There were a few students practising some of the simpler spells for their OWLs and NEWTs in the courtyard and Remus felt a pride for each of them as they progressed through the years at Hogwarts. He noticed that Erin sat alone at the far end, she was studying out of one of her books and Remus was unsure if she was alone on purpose or if her friends were elsewhere. She didn't look especially upset by it so he left the courtyard and headed towards the greenhouse. </p><p>     ‘Professor Lupin!’ Someone called from down the corridor, Remus turned to see one of his third year's rushing over to him, Remus sighed internally and put on his usual friendly face.</p><p>     ‘Alice, what can I do for you?’ He asked cheerfully. The moment between him asking the question and remembering that she wasn't the most physically coordinated, was filled with him watching her slip over and fall onto the hard concrete. ‘Are you alright?’ He asked rushing over and helping her sit up against the wall, she was clutching her ankle and almost in tears. ‘Let me see.’ He said, immediately feeling for a broken ankle. ‘It's not broken, maybe just a sprain. Nothing to be upset about.’ He tried to cheer her up and she gave a small smile; to his great pleasure he caught Poppy out of the corner of his eye. ‘Poppy!’ He called and she quickly rushed over. ‘Sprained ankle we think.’</p><p>     ‘Oh Miss Peters, what are we going to do with you?’ Poppy shook her head and began helping Alice to the hospital wing. </p><p>     ‘Come and see me when you're finished Alice and I'll answer your questions.’ He assured her as she left with Poppy. </p><p>     Remus vaguely wondered how many more interruptions he would have before he reached the greenhouse. He could see the silhouette of Angelina emerging from the lake. She didn't appear to have anything other than her wand on her and began putting her warm clothes on again. Remus casually wandered over to her and waved back at a few of the students who greeted him on the way past. </p><p>     ‘Well well well, look who it is.’ Angelina said, upon seeing him. Remus just shook his head and put his hands on his hips. ‘I see you're still the subject of fascination to the Ravenclaws.’ She indicated the students he had been teaching a few minutes ago and Remus immediately moved his hands letting his jacket fall back over his body. He turned back to see Angelina looking behind her as if she heard something.</p><p>     ‘Angelina?’ He asked and she snapped back, putting her t-shirt on.</p><p>     ‘Is that the book?’ She asked distracting him for a moment.</p><p>     ‘Oh yes, I would've brought it to the greenhouse sooner, but I got caught up with a few students.’ Remus explained handing over the book on water plants. ‘What's the thinking behind it?’</p><p>     ‘Well,’ Angelina began, Remus carried her jumper as they made their way to the greenhouse finally. ‘As you know, puffapods are usually found in fields, huge clumps of them ready to set off a chain reaction of spontaneous sprouting should they come into contact with anything solid.’ Remus noticed how animated she had become when telling him about what she had learned, she would make an incredible teacher. ‘But the ones I found were underwater and nocturnal, sprouting during the blue moon. I'm trying to figure out firstly why they grow underwater and secondly why the nocturnal ones exist in the first place.’</p><p>     ‘And you think it can help with the flaring?’ Remus asked, he was somewhat aware of seeing the fifth year Ravenclaws again and it was once again mildly annoying.</p><p>     ‘Well, I'm not sure.’ Angelina stopped and flicked through a couple more pages. ‘I was talking to Jack yesterday, he came over for lunch and he mentioned administering the anti flaring whilst trying to heal the infected wound.’ Angelina looked up at Remus while she thought and he loved watching her think out loud. ‘Now that presents several things I need to consider, one being any reaction between the silver and dittany and the anti flaring, the second it depends on the person infected getting to St Mungo’s within a reasonable time frame and it also doesn't do anything for the already existing werewolves.’ Angelina sighed and her eyes focused on Remus. ‘Why are you smiling?’</p><p>     Remus found himself laughing a little. ‘I don't know… I suppose because I'm happy to see you.’ He said and took a breath. ‘So, still a lot of work to do?’</p><p>     Angelina nodded. ‘I don't even know if this is possible, that's the problem. I keep telling myself that if I can conceive of it, then yes of course it's possible, but everything is telling me that this is asking a bit much.’</p><p>     ‘Angelina.’ Remus stroked her arm and smiled. ‘You can do this, you can either find a way or find out for certain if it is or isn't possible. I believe you are capable of extraordinary things, I've always believed that. There will be struggles and hardships along the way, there will be frustration and anger and you'll want to yell at the world when you get stuck going in circles, but ultimately that is what the journey is about. Experience and learning. You've always known that.’</p><p>     He watched her bright smile come back and she quickly glanced around to see if anyone was close by, before giving him a quick kiss. ‘Thank you. You always know what to say.’</p><p>     ‘I try to.’ Remus nodded and handed Angelina her jumper. ‘Now, you have puffapods to research and I have a few things to attend to.’ He began to leave the greenhouse to head back to his office. ‘Can I chance my luck and ask you to dinner tonight?’ </p><p>     ‘I don't know, what's in it for me?’ She shot back with a cheeky grin.</p><p>     ‘The chance to spend an evening with me, free from any obligation, responsibility or less than gentlemanly intention.’ Remus smiled.</p><p>     ‘The last one I don't believe.’ Angelina winked. ‘Come and find me when you've finished your errands.’ </p><p>     Remus nodded and turned to leave, he stopped and groaned internally when he distinctly heard the muffled giggling of the three Ravenclaws that most definitely heard him asking Angelina to dinner. He was never living it down.</p><p> </p><p>I spent most of the afternoon working with Professor Sprout on the nocturnal puffapods and trying to figure out if they could grow outside of the water. It all looked very promising and I had a good feeling about them. We had agreed that when I got the chance I could come back harvest a few of them so that I could do a little more research at home.</p><p>     Remus had come back a little later than I expected and apologised as he needed to visit a student in the hospital wing. I was beginning to get a glimpse into his life at the school and it wasn't that I didn't think he was kind, but it was more a case of not quite realising how many students looked up to him. I was beginning to think he might not have realised it either.</p><p>     I quickly took a shower in his room and we left for dinner in Hogsmeade.</p><p>     ‘It's been so long since I was here.’ I said as we walked through the streets towards the three broomsticks. </p><p>     ‘It's not really changed since I was at school, I hardly expect to change in the near future.’ Remus said. He was holding my hand and nothing had felt more right, he was warm and smiling and up for a good night. It was everything I never knew I wanted.</p><p>     We sat down in a corner and watched all the witches and wizards beginning their evening of getting drunk and laughing the night away. </p><p>     ‘That sounds promising.’ Remus nodded, twisting his glass gently as I told him about the day I spent in the greenhouse. He looked so cool, sitting facing the rest of the pub with one leg thrown over the other. ‘So what would the difference be between growing them in water and growing them on land?’</p><p>     ‘No idea.’ I shook my head. ‘Maybe strength when put into a potion, could react differently to a blue moon, might not react at all. I have no idea, but I'll be back in a few weeks to collect a few to work on at home.’ I took a breath and thought about what else I wanted to tell Remus. </p><p>     ‘What is it?’ He asked, of course, I only had to think it and he would know there was more.</p><p>     I rolled my eyes and sipped my firewhiskey. ‘Jack and Tonks broke up.’ I said, not quite looking at Remus. ‘He said she fell in love with someone else.’</p><p>     ‘I'm so sorry.’ Remus said, though his face didn't quite match his words.</p><p>     ‘You don't need to say it if you don't mean it.’ I didn't quite mean it as a snap, but it just came out that way. ‘I know you didn't like him much.’</p><p>     ‘It was never that I didn’t like him Angelina.’ Remus turned to face me and kept me focussed. ‘He was the first man you kissed and I was jealous. It was never my place to be jealous and now that is simply how I think of Jack. He's a wonderful man and very deserving of your friendship, I will never forget the work he did on Lockwoods Wolfsbane, he works hard and he has chosen a very difficult career path, one which I can see he is taking in his stride and already exceeding at. He is a very deserving man, a good man, but I'm afraid he will always be someone I will be wary of because of the past you share.’ Remus sighed. ‘I am sorry that his relationship ended the way it did, I understand how he might be feeling… will you send him my apologies?’</p><p>     I nodded and thought I didn't quite understand Remus's position fully, I could see he was trying to feel sorry for Jack.</p><p>     ‘Can we talk about something else?’ Remus smiled weakly. ‘What have you got planned for the next few weeks?’</p><p>     We talked a little about my being sent to Ireland for a few days with Benji and a little more about the possibilities of my research, but soon it was time to get back to the castle. I had taken Remus up on his invitation to stay the night and we walked past the glimmering lake on our way back to the castle.</p><p>     ‘Can I ask you a question?’ I said as I sat on the edge of his bed. Remus nodded with a curious frown as he began unbuttoning his shirt. ‘Do you think that… I mean, if it can happen to Jack, it could… women look at you and they notice you, women who are more attractive than me and… I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just thinking about the possibilities.’ I stumbled over every thought I had and hoped that Remus could understand me.</p><p>     He sighed and knelt down in front of me, holding my hand and stroking the back of it. ‘You never have to worry about me leaving you, not for any reason. These things happen for a reason and it's usually because one or both people in a relationship aren't happy with the arrangement, or because they were never in love in the first place. It can happen for any reason, you're right, but I will never leave you. You have to trust that.’</p><p>     He smiled gently at me and stroked my cheek, pulling a small smile from me as well.</p><p>     ‘How do you know so much about relationships?’ I chuckled as Remus continued getting ready for bed.</p><p>     ‘How do yo know so much about everything else?’</p><p>     ‘I went to the library.’ I frowned.</p><p>     Remus stopped and chuckled. ‘Okay, I didn't go to the library to study people, but I did watch people when I was in school, I learnt from my parents how to show affection, how to deal with arguments and I learnt from James and Sirius how to be romantic and charming, something I'm surprised you don't take more advantage of… but then, I may not feel this way if you did.’</p><p>     ‘What do you mean?’ I asked, getting underneath the covers and waiting for Remus to join me.</p><p>     ‘Well, how to put this… there are almost exactly ten years between us. Traditionally people your age would see someone my age and take advantage of either money or success and try to get an easy ride through life.’ Remus explained. ‘However, the type of woman I find myself attracted to is someone with intelligence, someone who is brave and kind and someone who is accepting of people like me, the last one being the most essential. You are more than I ever hoped I could find in a woman and you also happen to be a very attractive woman, hence why I get jealous easily.’</p><p>     ‘I'm not that attractive.’ </p><p>     ‘To me, you are the very definition of attractive.’ Remus leaned over and gently kissed me. ‘Can I get in bed now?’</p><p>     ‘Absolutely.’ I breathed, not quite meaning to. Remus smiled again and let me lie against his chest while his fingers ran through my hair, it was something he was becoming more and more accepting of. He had scars all over his body, but as I kept reminding him, I barely noticed anymore. ‘Is this the future you envisioned for us?’</p><p>     I felt him chuckle against me. ‘It's certainly something I hoped for every night.’ Remus kissed the top of my head and took a deep breath relaxing into a more comfortable position. </p><p>     ‘Who's Sirius?’ I felt Remus suddenly still underneath me, he let his breath go and swallowed uncomfortably.</p><p>     ‘He used to be a friend from school.’ It was very vague and I wondered why exactly Remus wouldn't give a fuller explanation.</p><p>     ‘What happened to him?’ I pushed for a little more information.</p><p>     ‘We don’t speak anymore.’ Remus sighed. ‘I don't really want to talk about him. I'm sorry Angelina.’</p><p>     I didn't say anything else and accepted that it might have been something I wasn't ready to hear about Remus's past. Whoever Sirius was, he was obviously someone Remus would rather forget, maybe it was something to do with the war, maybe someone he lost. It didn't matter to me, all that did matter was that the Remus I held against me was happy.</p>
