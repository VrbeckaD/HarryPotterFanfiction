    <p dir="ltr">The ministry lighting was dim and dull, a few odd lanterns were littered around the pastel waiting room, a skylight above them was intended to let in natural light but became pointless for half the year in smoggy, cloudy london. The room itself contrasted the lighting; bold, colourful, pastel. Each wall was a different colour - <em>baby blue, dull yellow, light pink</em>, - creating a sort of calming rainbow. The corner of the room was filled with well loved stuffed animals, their button eyes glassy and once clear, now clouded. The fur patchy from years of cuddles and petting.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus felt a shiver run down his back as he stared into their dead eyes. Was this the life he was meant to lead? Collecting limp doll animals, hugging them until their joints lacked stuffing? A feeling of shame creeped up his body, settling in his chest, but shame was nothing but an old friend to Snape.</p><p dir="ltr">"Severus Tobias Snape?" His name was called by the neat receptionist, breaking the trance he was held in. Severus looked up, their eyes locking, hers blue and wide when she took the sight of him in. "<em>Eh</em>-" She hesitated, as if he couldn't <em>really</em> be a little, surely? But no one else was in the waiting room, no one but this scrawny boy, "you're in room four." Her voice remained sweet, but the pity was obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus would, in normal circumstances, make a rude comment towards her, something idle but snarky, something to leave her questioning herself; but this wasn't a normal day and any energy he had was put into remaining guarded and collected. With narrowed, glaring eyes, he shifted towards the third door.</p><p dir="ltr">The room was still equally pastel, as he suspected it would be, but there were moving clouds on the ceiling, cartoon animals skipping along the walls. In the middle of the room stood a navy desk, the seats at it were cushioned and colourful, unlike the man who sat within one.</p><p dir="ltr">A ministry official in dark, black robes, a white undershirt visible. His eyes were a deep blue and hair brown, wavey like. A kind face, forgiving expression, warm rosey skin - polar opposite to the clothing he dressed in. "<em>Severus</em>, is it?" He purred like a cat, voice silky. "I'm Matthew, but please, you can call me Matt?" <em>Matthew</em> offered.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus heistated but took a seat as he scrunched his nose up at the muggle like name. He knew a Matt back in Spinners End, he was a few years older, a known smuggler and overall shifty bloke, nothing like the Matthew that sat in front of him with a sweet smile.</p><p dir="ltr">"No friends? No family with you?" The smile shifted but remained, hiding a slight disappointment. "Nevermind, I 'ppose. All I need is you; Oh! Help yourself," Matthew cooed, gesturing towards the bowl of hard candies that sat on his desk, a mixture of lollipops and gummie bears, cough drops and <em>Merlin knows</em> else what.</p><p dir="ltr">Another glimmer of disappointment flickered behind the smile as Severus didn't move to take a candy, regardless of how much his stomach cramped from hunger.</p><p dir="ltr">"I heard you had your sixteenth birthday yesterday?' A subject change, <em>at least they were getting back on track,</em> even if Severus still didn't respond, Matthew seemed resilient to keep trying (<em>thats what he was getting paid for, wasn't it?</em>) "Well, as you know, the majority of the population, presents a classification on that day, <em>their birthday.</em> The ministry was notified that you presented as a little?"</p><p dir="ltr">The letter had been baby blue, but even with its gentle colours, Ma's face had twisted in anger. "No! I prayed to the <em>Gods</em> they wouldn't make you a wizard, I prayed! And <em>they cursed you</em>. Now they do this, <em>this</em>, to us! Child, pack your bag!" Her voice was like a <em>banshee</em>, screeching throughout the thin walls, Severus close to a panic attack as he stuffed the little amount of things he owned back into his Hogwarts trunk. With shaking fingers, he snaked his hands into the hole of his wall - <em>thanks to his Pa,</em> - and took out the small tin can of cash, a mixture of muggle notes and wizard coins. The butterflies in his stomach told him he wouldn't be returning to the slums any time soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus pressed his hand against the trunk that sat shrunken in his pocket. "Yes - I got the letter this morning." He finally said, breaking his silence.</p><p dir="ltr">"How did your parents react?' Matthew asked, perking up in his large chair that he'd gotten a response.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus frowned suddenly, the shame making itself present once more. "My mum... shes surrounded me." He muttered quietly, his dark eyes looking down at the candy bowl, not wanting to see Matthew expression.</p><p dir="ltr">A deafening silence lay across the room, neither saying a word, but the sentence kept repeating itself in Severus's head. He slid the letter of surrender to the man in front of him, eyes glued to the stained wood of the desk.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thats... not brilliant, Severus, but eh, its better this way, I suppose." Matthew whispered, choice of words careful. "Look, we'll carry on, and afterwards I'll take you to see your head of house at Hogwarts and arrange for you to be adopted out."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm a sixteen year old boy, <em>nobody</em> is going to want to adopt me!" Severus snapped, words harsh but a reality to him.</p><p dir="ltr">Matthews lips twitched as he tilted his head. "You're a little, people would <em>pay</em> just to look after you, Severus. We'll find you a home <em>easily</em>. I promise.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, being a little, a lot of things will change, so we can protect you and your headspace." Mathew explained, summoning a large box from the floorboards. "Your uniform size?"</p><p dir="ltr">Severus stared blankly at him, mind equally empty. He never had a fitting size before, it'd always be large, so he could grow into it, as Mum had said. "Large." He said with a air of confusion to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Matthew paused, bright eyes looking him up and down. "<em>Large</em>?" He questioned. "Dear, I dont think you're a large. Medium at best, <em>maybe</em>! May an elf measure you--"</p><p dir="ltr">"NO!" Severus stood quick, the pink chair falling behind him. He jumped back, struggling for his wand, (<em>Darn muggle pockets</em>!)</p><p dir="ltr">Matthew stood up as quick as Severus, grabbing the small teens hands with a strong yet tender grip. His large hands were soft around Severus's wrists, his eyes filled with understanding emotions. "Severus, <em>no ones</em> going to do anything you don't want, take a deep breath and sit down... We should take a break, yes? Have you eaten today?'</p><p dir="ltr"><em>I haven't eaten since the weekend</em>. Severus wanted to answer truthfully but he couldn't let anyone know how pathetically poor he was. He snatched himself from the ministry worker, baring his teeth like an animal. "Dont touch me. I dont want to be--" The door opened and Severus flinched violently, jumping away from Matthew. His back pressed against the colourful wall, no painted woodland creatures to be seen. He looked to the door, heart pounding and blood rushing through his veins.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Albus stood in the door way, his long white beard braided with a feather in the its tail, his robes a calming shade of blue, yellow and gold stars littered the cloth, masking him as the night sky. His eyes (equal shades of ocean blue,) were calm and collected, staring deep into Severus's soul. He took the small teens hand and held them gently, a sigh passing his lips. "My dear boy, its going to be okay. Let me explain what it <em>means</em> to be a little,"</p>
