    <p class="western">Ten years interred in the Dursleys’ backyard, Harry knows: he is not like other boys.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Of course, he's wrong.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Good news, bad news: Dudley isn’t going to Stonewall High with Harry.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">All of his friends from the neighborhood are.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Have a good lunch, Potty!” they whoop and yell with voices that crack on the door frame of the broom cupboard. The other students had stepped around Piers and the gang carrying Harry from the classroom with uncanny precision that belied how resolutely they were pretending not to notice.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Piers’s cackling and the rest of the crowd noises in the corridor fade away quickly after they’ve pushed Harry inside the cupboard and shut the door.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">At least they’d waited until the second week of school. At least it’s just a broom cupboard, and not a toilet.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">More good news, bad news: poor diet and years yet to snag whatever puberty lies in wait for him, it's only a little, but Harry<em> has</em> gotten bigger since primary school. The broom cupboards haven't.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Well, why should anything change?</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry settles in for the lunch period. His elbows scrape the corners of the shelves on the wall and there’s a wet mop head between his feet and the floor. The bottles of cleaner are all capped, at least, so the stinging smell of chemicals could be worse. He should be fine as long as he gets let out in the next few hours, when it’s time to go home.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It's silent beyond the door. Then suddenly it's not.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“So you're the famous Harry Potter.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There's silence again, like maybe Harry's only imaging the voice. But then there's more sound, the bolt of the doorknob Harry thought was locked sliding audibly out of the door frame. Then comes the daylight, and in its contours his boy saviour.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The boy helps him out of the broom cupboard. Harry, once he's out, sets about trying to make the lump of grey fabric Aunt Petunia had dyed in the summer into something that more passingly resembles clothing. But that had been a long shot <em>before </em>Harry had worn it and washed it and worn it and been stuffed in with the bleach and half-filled mop bucket by hands the size of his own head.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry shoves his too large shirt tails into his too large trousers and pulls his sleeves up from his knuckles. With everything in place, he thinks, he looks a bit like an elephant who's shrunk away to nothing and only left his skin behind. The pants legs puddle over his shoes in a grey gloop.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry bends down to roll back the cuffs. The whole time, he feels the other boy's eyes maddeningly, insistently on the top of his head.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Not that he's not grateful and everything. But even the teachers on the first day of school had paid less attention checking the attendance register each hour, connecting name and face for the inevitable future reprimands.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You are. You're Harry Potter.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry feels his face heat up. He can hear it, the gloat in the other boy's voice, the taunt of someone else's victory. The other boy is probably smiling.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Well?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Things really don't change. Foolish of him to think this was anything but opportunity.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry looks up. The other boy is smiling brightly.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry swallows, says, “That’s me.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The way the other boy's smile widens, the squint at the corner of his eyes, Harry recognizes it from hundreds of painful or humiliating times before. Dudley here in spirit bigger than his body.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The other boy says, “This is <em>brilliant.</em>” His voice pitches up in his excitement, and he moves forward.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry braces himself. Teeth clenched, eyes shut, he thinks he might have flinched, which hurts, but not as much as a fist to the stomach.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The blow doesn't come.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The blow keeps not coming.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry opens his eyes.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The other boy is still smiling. He says, “This is amazing, meeting you like this.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He's holding out his hand for a handshake.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry stares. “What? I mean—what?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“This school's a nightmare,” the boy replies cheerfully. “The only reason I’m here is because Father said you’d be here, too. People are always saying they know where you are, though,” the boy grumbles. This is clearly a sore subject. “I never imagined it was <em>true</em>.”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">“<em>Me?”</em> The floor, the corridor, the school, nothing so much as wavers as the world slides down and off the tilt of its axis.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Well, it sure wasn't for Borsely.” The other boy actually looks amused.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry, though, is still confused. “Borsely?” Borsely was a burly fourth former with choppy blond hair and muscles bulging his uniform seams. He looked like a walking stone in the corridor in between classes. “What about him?” Harry asks.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The other boy gives him a vaguely mocking look and chides, “Don't tell me you haven't noticed the way he looks at you.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Actually, “No, I have.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Borsely wasn’t the sharpest tool in the chest, though. And six years of going to school with Dudley had immunized Harry against taunts and condescension as well as anyone could hope for. Harry didn’t think Borsely would physically hurt him. Wouldn’t grab him in an empty corridor when all the doors were closed. Wouldn’t chase him down the alleyway behind the kitchen. Borsely, as far as the student gossip mill was concerned, had never so much as looked at a fly the wrong way.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">So whatever unease Harry felt when his eyes accidentally met Borsely's, or their existences crossed paths, it was something completely alien. Similar, but entirely apart, from being wary of Dudley’s fists. Harry didn’t know what it was about Borsely that put him on guard.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry asks, “What do you know about it?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The boy's hand and smile finally drop. “He's curious. He's one of us.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry draws his next breath carefully. “What do you mean, one of us? Who’s us?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Harry,” the boy says, beginning to get a little exasperated at Harry’s only ever documented skill, which is massively missing the obvious. “He's a <em>wizard.</em> Like you. Like me.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There's no such thing as wizards. Wizards mean magic, and there is no such thing as magic. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia have said this explicitly.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Magic <em>can’t</em> be real. Because magic would be very important, like--like the the names of all the wars Britain has won, or how buildings in London were put together. People wrote books about important things, and Uncle Vernon bought them and put them in Dudley’s spare room, where Dudley did not read them. Not one of the books in Dudley’s spare room (which Harry had read by sneaking in when no one was paying too much attention) had ever been about wizards or magic.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Except. Sometimes when a little boy or a little girl was very good and he or she was very, very sad, sometimes, there were mother-and-fathers-who-aren't, who were both fairies and gods. And they’d do small favours for lonely children with no parents. Small, good things.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Like make chores that would otherwise take hours somehow finish themselves in just minutes.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And make embarrassing haircuts that would draw all the wrong kinds of attention decent and unextraordinary.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And set large, deadly snakes in glass cases free so they can scare off bullies (but Harry tries not to think about that too much because that wasn't a good thing, and maybe it hadn’t even had anything to do with Harry at all, but it had still ended with Dudley standing on his hand so hard and so long that it aches even now to hold a broom at home, or write notes in class).</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry wants to say something to the boy’s declaration.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">—<em>a wizard, he’s not a—</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">His tongue feels too big in his mouth. He’s talking before he’s decided what to say. “A <em>wizard?</em>”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Yes,” the boy confirms in exasperation. His eyes narrow. “You had to have known.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry agrees. He would’ve known. That’s how he knows this boy is lying.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Listen,” the boy says when Harry remains silent, “the lunch hour's almost over. I don't have time to eat all my lunch. Do you want to split it?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry blinks, swallows. It’s a concept wholly incompatible with his past experiences, voluntary splitting of possessions.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Hesitantly, he nods his head. “Yeah. OK, yeah. I mean—thanks.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The boy kneels down and flips open his leather satchel. Real leather, Harry can smell it when he takes the apple the boy offers, wraps his fingers around the red peel. Harry looks at the boy still kneeling over his bag. The light through the window on the other side of the corridor spreads in wide bands across the floor, under his feet and the boy’s feet and up the off-white cinderblock wall. Harry sits down on the floor across from the kneeling boy.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Thanks. Um… I don’t—I don’t know your name.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The boy smiles. He looks pretty normal like that, for being a wizard.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The boy says, “I’m Draco. Malfoy.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It’s the weirdest name Harry’s ever heard on the weirdest day he’s ever had.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">In primary school, Dudley and Harry walked three streets over from Magnolia Crescent with all the other neighborhood children each morning and back again each afternoon. Aunt Petunia had walked with them at first, clutching at Dudley's tiny, meaty hands, petting his hair while Dudley squirmed and kicked and bared his teeth. Harry counted five big steps behind the tips of his trainers and the backs of Aunt Petunia's heels, and pulled the thin straps of his knapsack tight until they dug into his shoulders a little less.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Then Dudley finally won the fight to walk to school alone. He'd wait at the edge of the playground for Harry to finish cleaning the morning dishes and emerge into the tiny radius of the journey not visible to either the house or the school so he and he friends could tear Harry's knapsack away and dump out all his school things and stomp on his sandwich until it bled its filling up against the tight cellophane wrapping.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">This year, Harry rides the bus. The walk from the bus stop to home takes eleven minutes and forty-seven seconds. The bus is neither quiet nor calm in the afternoon rush, with schoolkids and moms with toddlers and the earliest of the office workers all retreating from the city for the day. But it’s usually the most relaxing part of his day.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco rides the same bus.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry doesn’t notice at first because Draco doesn’t, at first. But the very next afternoon after Draco rescues Harry from the broom cupboard and feeds him half his lunch, he’s there, sat right in the first row of seats on the way home. Harry ignores him. He walks all the way to the back. He looks deliberately out of the window for the entire ride.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco rides the bus both ways on the following day, and Harry ignores him again. The third day, Draco gets off the bus first and waits on the pavement, sketch perfect in his charcoal grey uniform while the other kids in the neighborhood swarm around him like a river around a rock. He doesn’t move until Harry stumbles onto the sidewalk after his books, last off as usual.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry adjusts the set of his glasses and ignores Draco's blatant stare. It’s not that basic motor skills are difficult, even encumbered by an armful of library books, but he's a growing boy and sometimes it's hard to keep pace with his body. And a foot in his path or an elbow in his stomach never helps.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry sets off down the street. Draco falls into step beside him. Harry shoots the other boy a look, but Draco just keeps looking back until Harry drops his gaze.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You should come over sometime,” Draco says as they walk out of the alley between Wisteria and Magnolia Crescent.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I don't—think—”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Only it seems like you don’t believe me,” Draco continues. “About being a wizard. It’s all right if you don’t. It’s not the kind of thing you should go spreading around, anyway.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry wishes he’d <em>stop talking </em>because they’ve turned onto Privet Drive, and Dudley’s right there in the yard, on his hand and knees in a pair of the latest, fashionable denim. Vernon just bought the trousers at the end of summer break, but Dudley’s already turned the knees brown, barbecuing insects with his state of-the-art magnifying glass like he’s probably doing again right now.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You don’t understa--” Harry says, and at the same time, Draco’s saying “--least you could do--”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">Draco steps right into his pathway, turns around, and stops. Harry walks into his chest. The books in Harry’s arms flip out of his arms, across the pavement, and into the grass. One falls open right at their feet. Right to storybook calligraphy letters and accompanying crayola bright pictures.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Dudley, at least, doesn’t notice and doesn’t look up from his tiny ant massacre.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“So,” Draco says. He isn’t laughing at him, like Harry had expected him to. Draco bends down and picks up the book. Offers it back to Harry, still open to periwinkle robes and moon-silver hair lit green under the collision of yellow and blue streaks in the sky above. <em>Merlin. </em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You like sweets, right?” Draco asks.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Small favors, Draco isn’t in any of Harry’s classes. They ride the same bus, but live in opposite directions. They share a lunch period, but Draco usually spends those mocking teachers, insulting classmates, and haranguing the town in general, which is annoying and reminds Harry entirely too much of Dudley for Harry to really enjoy, but is not, as Harry is acutely aware, the worst thing he could talk about.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">(The worst thing he could talk about would be magic, and how it’s <em>real, </em>how Harry could change his entire life if he just--)</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s mother always packs sweets. The really good kind, the kind Dudley only gets on his birthday and holidays, and only if he remembers to whine. Harry likes the cream cheese tarts the best, Draco tells him that’s <em>not the point</em>, but he brings them a lot.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">They eat in the library. This is a direct violation of school rules, and also Draco is loud. But Harry had already taken to spending all of his time not in class in the library, so the librarian has grown fond of him. Draco rolls his eyes and says that’s just typical, Harry tells him to shut up, but not that it’s not all that typical at that, not for him. Since the librarian hadn’t kick them out even after these arguments, Draco complains probably less than he’d like.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Three weeks pass like this. They’re the best three weeks of Harry’s life.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco, though, isn’t satisfied with quiet lunches and rides on the bus. He wants the impossible. He still wants Harry to come home with him.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You don’t understand,” Harry says, raising his voice just enough to be heard over the din of everyone else on the bus, “my aunt and uncle don’t like me. They’ll say no.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco gets one of his displeased looks. He has many, and employs them regularly at school. In this one, his eyebrows and nose scrunch, so that means he’s not just upset by the circumstances, but also slightly baffled.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“But that’s stupid,” Draco protests. “If they don’t like you, they should want you out of the house.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry focuses on keeping his voice calm as he says, “Not if I’m enjoying it, though, you see?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“No,” Draco huffs and crosses his arms. Then he ponders it a bit, and says, “Well, yes, actually, that makes sense.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Gee, thanks,” Harry says dryly. He’s been working on lifting just one eyebrow, for when Draco says or does something poncy that makes Harry question their friendship. He’s been getting a lot of practice over the last few weeks, but he hasn’t figured it out just yet.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco shoves Harry sideways. They’ve just reached the stop for school, so Harry goes with it, slides onto his feet and stands in the aisle as the driver rolls to a halt. They get off the bus.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco says, “I’ll figure it out.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Uh-huh,” Harry says doubtfully, and goes to his first class.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">At lunch time, Harry gets to the library first. Harry usually gets to the library first, and then Draco arrives a few minutes later, nose turned up as if he’s being forced in against his will. But today, Harry sits alone at a small table deep in the fiction section for half the period and has already finished the bland school dinner before Draco finally storms in.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco throws his satchel down on the table right beside Harry’s elbow with a startling violence. The bag’s metal clasps strike the wooden tabletop with a sound that makes Harry draw back into his chair reflexively.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After a short pause where Harry concludes that all his fingers are still attached and unsquashed by metal edges, he snaps, “Watch it.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The librarian, far on the other side of the room reshelving reference books, doesn’t notice.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">For a brief moment, there’s a shadow of repentance about Draco’s face, but he doesn’t actually apologize. All he says is, “I’ve been working on our little conundrum.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Any luck?” Harry asks, trying not to sound either too hopeful or too forgiving.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco settles into the seat across from him with a heavy thump. “I may have a lead,” he begins with gravity, but then his shoulder slump, and he ends up grumbling, “but these things take time.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry glares at him.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco gives Harry most of the sweets his mom packed. Today, it’s a colorful collection of mini macarons, layered together in a little gold foil tray. Harry picks out the blue and green ones with jam filling and slides the rest the back across to Draco, who sulkily devours them all.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco also has an artisanal sandwich, with baby greens and fancy mustard that still just looks like mustard even though Harry knows it probably came in a little jar that cost more than 10 quid, and a packet of crisps which he leaves in their vaguely crumpled glory on the table, untouched.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry eats both of these, and takes solace in the knowledge that in another half hour, Draco’s going to be cranky for not eating more, and he’s not going to have anyone to blame but himself.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You’re number 4, right?” Draco asks as the bus slows on Magnolia Road at the end of the week. He doesn’t wait for an answer. Just hops off the bus and races toward his home without a backward glance.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry has a sinking feeling. The feeling is justified, a few hours later, while he’s in the kitchen prepping dinner. The doorbell rings while Harry is scrubbing lumpy potatoes over the sink. This is unusual, not because the Dursleys never have evening guests, but because Harry has not been warned to be as quiet and invisible as a dust mite. There are voices in the hall, then Aunt Petunia in the kitchen.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">She is livid, and underneath that, terrified. “You,” she exhales sharply, extending one sharp nail in Harry’s direction.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry does not say anything. To his recollection, he hasn’t done anything that warrants berating, and he doesn’t want to say something that might suggest he does.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The water from the faucet continues to rush loudly into the sink.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Outside,” Aunt Petunia gasps. She is speaking entire sentences in single words, which is a terrible sign. “Immediately.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry drops the potato he’s holding in the sink, turns off the water, and goes.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s big plan is his parents ambushing the Dursleys in their own home.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Oh, hello, Harry,” Draco’s mom says when Harry comes down the hall. Aunt Petunia is right on his heels. She barely misses pulling his socks off with every step.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry comes to a halt just behind Uncle Vernon and Dudley, who, side-by-side, take up all the width of the foyer. Dudley’s mouth is open. Uncle Vernon’s mouth is also open behind his moustache, a gaping, dark hole of confusion. At Draco’s mom’s greeting, he reaches blindly backwards and sweeps Harry toward the stairs, out of sight.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry goes with the push willingly. He squeezes between the banister’s edge and Uncle Vernon’s back, and climbs up the first few steps so that he can see the front stoop over the top of Dudley’s head.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco is standing on the front stoop. Draco is standing on the front stoop with a man who has long hair exactly the same sharp white blond as his own and a woman whose upright posture Draco has clearly been learning in imitation.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“We’re neighbors,” Draco’s dad says, “may we come in?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">His question is misleading. It implies there is a choice. In reality, no one in the Dursley house is remotely equipped to prevent Draco’s dad, Draco’s mom, and a blatantly smug Draco from gaining entrance.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Somehow, everyone ends up the sitting room.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">No one is sitting.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco and his parents stand clustered in the arch back out into the foyer, while Uncle Vernon stands in front of the unlit fireplace with his hands on his hips. Aunt Petunia and Dudley stand several steps behind Uncle Vernon and to one side. Harry stands much further away on the other. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley are, coincidentally, poised more or less in reflection of the large family portrait on the mantle. The biggest difference is how Aunt Petunia’s fake-smile grimace in the photograph is more blatantly just a grimace here in person.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Well,” Uncle Vernon says, and nothing else. No one has interrupted him, he just hasn’t decided what to say next. His jaws slide his teeth back and forth over each other in indecision.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s family has not been tossed out despite their oddness. And they are very odd. For one thing, Draco is wearing polished dress shoes without a word of complaint just an hour before dinner, whereas Dudley chucks his only pair of school shoes off into a corner for his mother to find every afternoon. Draco’s dad is wearing a nice suit, crisp, like he’d put it on just for this visit. His mom is wearing pearls and long, black gloves that go all the way up to her elbows.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Clearly Draco’s family is a very different kind of family than the Dursleys. Everyone can see this.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And Harry sees the moment Uncle Vernon’s indecision lurches precipitously into ingratiation.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Aunt Petunia sees something else entirely in Draco’s family. Something she doesn’t like. She is trying with little subtlety to hide Dudley’s bulky girth behind her own.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Dudley’s only concern seems to be for the television.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry can feel the hair on the back of his arms starting to stand on end, but Dudley, who apparently cannot, just whines at his mother about missing his favourite show.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">(All of Dudley’s shows are his favourite show. For once, Aunt Petunia is unmoved.)</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Uncle Vernon’s confusion transforms into a friendly grin.“So. You must be new to the neighborhood!” He speaks across the room at Draco’s parents in increasingly loud tones even as he takes several bold steps closer. “Making the rounds, getting to know the neighbors?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Of a manner,” Draco’s dad replies. He says, “We live on Magnolia Crescent,” and he means <em>our house is much larger and nicer than yours.</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Vindicated, Uncle Vernon’s grin grows bigger and more welcoming. “Well, we’re glad to have you! Great place to live. And you have a lovely son!”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">An unexpected laugh tries to break up the tension Harry can feel curling up his spine, but he pushes it down. He looks away from Draco, but not quickly enough to miss the way Draco cuts his eyes in his direction.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“He looks about the age of our Dudley, here,” Uncle Vernon boasts, now bringing his large hand around to Dudley’s equally large shoulder. Uncle Vernon wrenches Dudley out of Aunt Petunia’s desperate clutch and sweeps him up against his side, which brings him about four steps closer to Draco’s parents.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Or he tries to, anyway. Uncle Vernon and Dudley are both of a stature that makes other bodies bounce away much like small objects thrown at a large ball, so what really happens is Dudley just squeaks in protest as his father’s fingers squeeze his arm.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Aunt Petunia makes an aborted, sharp cry of alarm.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“He’s just started at Smeltings this year,” Uncle Vernon forges on, glancing around the room. No matter where he looks, none of the pictures on the walls display Dudley in the distinctive orange knickerbockers.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Has he?” Draco’s dad replies. “Our son goes to Stonewall. With Harry.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I went to Smeltings myself,” Uncle Vernon continues, overriding this declaration as if it hadn’t been made at all.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s dad gives Uncle Vernon a very obvious once-over, and then says in deliberate sort of tone, “I don’t believe this --school you speak of would provide the kind of educational environment we seek.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry has to stifle another sudden, mad giggle.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">This is <em>bananas.</em> Draco’s dad has hair that falls over his shoulders when he tilts his head. Draco’s dad has a cane, like the rich adult version of Dudley’s walking stick. He looks exactly like a storybook drawing of one of Merlin’s apprentices, if the storybook drawings lost their pointy hats and bought black suits instead.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s dad is clearly a <em>wizard. </em>And his mom is a witch. They blatantly couldn’t give less of a hoot about Smeltings, which was fair, because Harry felt like any place that would produce Uncle Vernon and willingly take Dudley probably couldn’t give less of a hoot about magic, either.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Of course, Uncle Vernon couldn’t know all that about magic he didn’t believe in and his own alma mater.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It’s a damn fine institution,” Uncle Vernon insists to Draco’s dad. “Only the best. But you must have moved in too recently to really have any time to pick a private school.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Horrifyingly, Uncle Vernon gives Draco’s dad the same conspiratorial smile/wink combination he usually employs over the table at dinner parties when he’s trying to convey both his own fortune and his willingness to share an increment of its bounty.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Your boy’s what, just turned 11?" Uncle Vernon judges. "They take new applicants at 13. We could put in a good word for you.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s mom and dad receive this offer with great apathy. Draco, hemmed in much more neatly by both of his magical parents than Dudley, drives home their indifference by catching Harry’s eyes and making his own go wide in wordless appallment.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s mother cuts straight to the chase. She says, “We’d like to have Harry over. ”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Uncle Vernon’s posturing finally cracks wide open. “What do you want with <em>him</em>?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It’s only logical. Our son and Harry are in the same class,” Draco’s mom lies, but it’s not like the Dursleys would know. They wouldn’t be able to name Harry’s homeroom teacher if someone offered them a million quid. “They can support each other’s learning.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The Dursleys have made it exceedingly clear to Harry that there are few things they are less interested in supporting than Harry’s learning. And now Aunt Petunia makes it clear to Draco’s mom when she throws back her shoulders and says, “I won’t allow it.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s mom turns all of her focus on Aunt Petunia. “I’m sure you’ll find they hardly need <em>allowing</em> to learn. They’ll do it one way or another,” she says to Aunt Petunia in a calm voice. “I’m only proposing that they start learning together. Cooperation would benefit them both.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Aunt Petunia falters for no reason at all, as far as Harry can tell, before clenching her fists and lifting her chin. “He’s <em>my</em> nephew. If I say he’s not going, he’s not going.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">No one says anything for a moment. Not Uncle Vernon, who’s finally looked away from Draco’s parents to stare, bewildered, at Aunt Petunia; not Dudley, who’s settled into a petulant scowl; and not Draco’s parents, who do not seem like they are planning to react to Aunt Petunia’s outburst at all.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Finally, though, Draco’s mom says, “You must be...Lily’s sister, then. Is that right?” Her words are arranged so they sound like a question. But just like Draco’s dad, she is not actually waiting on an answer. “We went to school together, you know.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry did not know. He doesn’t know why that statement makes Aunt Petunia’s and Uncle Vernon’s faces go immediately, starkly pale.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“She was a few years behind me,” Draco’s mom continues. “A very sweet girl.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Uncle Vernon has taken several steps back, toward Aunt Petunia, and he’s dragged Dudley along with him.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That means now Harry has a clear path directly to Draco’s parents. <em>Great.</em> He has several questions he would like answered. Questions like, did Draco’s mom really go to school with Harry’s mom? Did she go to school with Harry’s dad, too? What were the chances of Draco’s parents going to the exact same school as Harry’s parents, who were not even from Little Whinging, and Harry and Draco just happening, all these years later, to also go to the same school? How did that just <em>happen?</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Then Harry remembers that it did not, in fact, just happen. Draco going to the same school as Harry was entirely by design. Entirely by Draco's <em>parents' </em>design.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Because...Draco’s parents want Draco to be friends with Harry. Or they want Harry to be friends with Draco? E</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Either way, Harry has a feeling they’re going to get what they want.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">When Draco’s parents finally leave the Dursleys’ house, it is with Aunt Petunia’s unhappy permission for Harry to visit the Malfoys’ home whenever he pleases.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There is no explanation as to why Aunt Petunia agrees to let Harry swan off to a friend’s house instead of picking up the excess housework, as Dudley complains loudly. There is especially no explanation for how they arrived at Harry getting cleared to go to Draco’s house straight after school, without even checking in with Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon first.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">To Harry, it’s fairly obvious that his visits to the Malfoys’ carry an implicit interest in the fact that Harry is--is a wizard. He’s magic, just like the Malfoys. The Dursleys do not know this, and Harry doesn’t plan to be the one to tell them on the basis that it would probably only rile them up again and maybe make them want to revisit the issue.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Right now, there is a mutual and unspoken agreement not to revisit the issue.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After Draco and his parents leave, Harry makes a tactical retreat to his cupboard before his aunt and uncle can think of sending him there, and he huddles on his cot. By the time the Dursleys have watched all their evening shows and then shuffled upstairs to bed, nobody has come to lock his door, so Harry quietly goes back out and eats some of the leftovers from dinner. He doesn’t want to risk drawing anyone’s attention back downstairs with the buzzing and beeping of the microwave, and the oven would take too long, so he eats the jacket potatoes cold.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The Dursleys clearly aren’t happy to see Harry go, but they’ve always been equally displeased to have him stay. Uncle Vernon likes to say you can’t please all of the people all of the time. Harry figures it’s about time Uncle Vernon was the one disappointed.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The next day is Saturday. Instead of being woken up to tend the kitchen, or the garden, or the laundry, Harry is left alone while the Dursleys take an unscheduled trip. This is signaled by the slamming of the front door, and then the sound of the car engine turning over and running until it fades away down the street.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry, unsure when the Dursleys will come back, stays inside his cupboard. Against all odds, even though his body and his thoughts are wound tight with anxiety, Harry falls asleep. He doesn’t wake up again until the evening. He feels restless and weird for having slept through the daylight hours instead of working on chores.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He is the only one in the house, and the house is silent.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">For the second night in a row, Harry goes about his business in the dark, digging through the Tupperware in the fridge and washing up in the downstairs bathroom. He even does his homework in the kitchen, by the window that looks right into the bright outside light on the neighbor’s back porch. He’s never gotten through his homework so quickly.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">On Sunday, the Dursleys only return in time to eat dinner at home. Uncle Vernon opening the front door wakes Harry up right in the middle of a dream he isn’t able to recall later. Harry’s glad he’s in his cupboard, with the door closed and none of the lights on. Whether they’re deliberately avoiding him, or they’ve really forgotten he’s under the stairs, Harry is just thankful he only has to make it until the morning when he can escape to school.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">On Monday, it’s pouring rain. Draco grabs Harry’s elbow as he’s stepping off the bus in the afternoon and says, “You’re coming to my house today.” Then he sets off in the opposite direction of Privet Drive, pulling Harry behind him by his coat sleeve.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">This weather may be just fine for Draco, who has a genuine school coat, but Harry only has Dudley’s old fleece zip-up. Even being two years old, it’s still fits Harry like a particularly lumpy circus tent. It does nothing to keep out the rain. In contrast, Draco’s coat looks like it was cut specifically for him, and has the school crest sewn over the breast. Harry can only imagine how they look to observers, two equally grey splotches of comically different sizes against the fog, slouching together through the driving rain.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The homes on Magnolia Crescent are all detached houses. Some of them even have double garages. Draco pulls Harry around to a house just a few in from the intersection with Magnolia Road.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s dad had in no way been exaggerating: their house really is much bigger and nicer than Dursleys’. It’s bigger and nicer than the other houses on the road, too. There’s a garden more extravagant than Aunt Petunia’s, with bright blurs of flowers dabbed in among the shrubs and climbing up trellises like watercolors. Instead of the the brown brick exterior common to Privet Drive, Draco’s house has a stately stone facade.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It’s an altogether unnecessarily nice building for being in Little Whinging, which Harry is coming to suspect is the point.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Inside the house, Draco tells him, “I don’t know <em>how </em>you put up with that Dudley boy,” as he stomps upstairs, tracking mud all over the shiny black hardwood. He strips off his heavy school coat and drops it in a soggy heap right in the middle of his bedroom doorway, so Harry has to step over it as he follows him inside. “He’s the most vile, disrespectful, entitled, repugnant individual I’ve ever met.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You got all that from standing in the same room as him for 10 minutes?” Harry says disbelievingly. It’s the second thought that pops into his head at Draco’s proclamation, immediately after the uncharitable judgment that it takes one to know one.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco braces himself against a bookshelf on the wall with one hand while he pulls off his shoes and socks with the other. He stares right at Harry. “Are you saying he’s not?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Definitely not,” Harry says. There is nothing to gain and a great many things to lose if Draco were to start looking on Dudley more favorably.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco make a slashing, <em>there you go, then</em> flourish with one hand, which also serves to fling his shoes through the air toward his wardrobe. Then he walks over to his bed and flops backwards into the duvet.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It’s as Harry is standing there, with his wet socks in his wet shoes and his everything else entirely saturated with rainwater, as he’s wondering if it is worse to get muddy water all over the hardwood or the nice, fluffy white rug that extends from beneath Draco’s bed, that he realizes: there is nothing magical about Draco’s room.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">To be sure, it is nothing short of astonishing that Harry is in someone else’s home by invitation rather than being dumped there like an unwanted pet right before holidays.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">But Draco’s room is very unexceptional. In some ways, it’s even like Dudley’s. There’s no television, broken or otherwise, but Draco has the same model remote control airplane and a glass terrarium. His furniture is all made of some bright, golden wood, and looks less like something from an Arthurian legend than something you could order from any sufficiently posh department store in London. Draco’s bed is a massive four-poster with several pillows and heavy, white curtains drawn back with shiny grey ties. There’s a roll top desk in the corner with drawers all the way down to the floor, a wide wardrobe on the left wall, and two bookcases on the right. The whole room is light, and airy, and remarkably clean for a boy who has to be reminded not to leave his food wrappers on the library table every day.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There is nothing floating, or spinning, or glowing, or bubbling. There’s nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">On his bed, Draco pushes himself up to his elbows, and looks at Harry. “What? What are you just standing there for?”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">The thing is, for all that thoughts of magic and being a wizard have been gathering up in Harry’s head like the head of an unopened fizzy drink, they haven’t actually talked about it. Not since the first week, when Harry had clammed up every time Draco mentioned spells or flying brooms.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Maybe...it’s too late.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Maybe Draco was wrong. Or the whole thing was always just a fabrication. An outrageous fantasy that the Dursleys were a long-running but ultimately trivial appendix to the life Harry was supposed to have. One that could be corrected.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">(The only thing more terrifying than the possibility that magic is real is the possibility that it’s not.)</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry opens his mouth. He means to apologize for getting rainwater all over Draco’s nice things, but what comes out of his mouth is, “I’ve never seen you do any magic.”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">Draco squints at Harry. He says, “Well, obviously. That’s because I can’t.”</p><p class="western"><br/>.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I mean, I’m not a <em>squib,” </em>Draco says, which is a word Harry has never heard before, but is not, going by the way Draco’s mouth curls, something he’d want to be. “I’m a Malfoy.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry says, “I know that,” even though he does not know<em> what</em> that means he is supposed to know.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco keeps squinting. He slides off of his bed and walks across the white rug and the hardwood floor in his bare feet until he’s standing very, very close. Harry has only known Draco for a month, and he is still getting used to the idea that Draco might intrude on his space at any time and then pass back out again without hurting him<em>. </em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry shivers. The thermostat in Draco’s room is probably set to a perfectly comfortable temperature, but Harry’s clothes are still wet and his skin is going cold.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s eyes go over Harry’s face, solemn and searching. He tells Harry, “You need to change. You’re going to be sick.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry blinks at him. “This is all I have,” he tells him. He feels like it’s the wrong thing to say, even though it’s the truth.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I think we’re about the same size,” Draco judges, and starts pulling things out of his wardrobe.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">A few minutes later, Harry’s pulled off the lumpy grey clothes he’d worn to school and put on a pair of Draco’s slacks and a soft, long-sleeved shirt instead. Draco’s clothes are uncomfortably too tight. The sleeves end right at his wrists, and the trousers have hardly any extra room in them at all.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Just leave those there,” Draco says of Harry’s wet clothes, pointing toward his own coat in the doorway. He mutters something under his breath that sounds like he thinks they should be burned.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry puts his pile of wet school things down beside Draco’s without arguing. If Draco doesn’t care about all the water getting on the floor, then it’s certainly not his place to. Without wet socks on, the feeling is beginning to return to his toes.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Come on,” Draco says next, “I want to show you something.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">What Draco wants to show him is books. The book shelves in his room aren’t just full, they’re lined two rows deep with dull-colored hardcovers. The first few Draco pulls out aren’t even in English.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Why are these all French?” Harry asks, carefully turning pages near the back of a book with a ridged spine as they both sit cross-legged before the book shelves. “Wait, are you French?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“We’re <em>not </em>French,” Draco denies hotly, looking scandalized. “Why would you--”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Your name’s French,” Harry points out. “...I think.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco rolls his eyes up to the ceiling and admits, “All right, yes, a long, long, long time ago, Father’s family came over with the Normans, but Mother’s family is English all the way back.” He levels a displeased look back down at Harry. “The books are in French because I got them in France.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry tries out the one eyebrow thing again, because practice makes perfect. “So you are French.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I was born in Wiltshire,” Draco snaps.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You can read these, though, right? You speak French.” Harry is integrating this new facet of Draco into his perception of the other boy. He’s honestly not trying to poke fun, but Draco doesn’t see it that way.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“<em>Yes,</em> I speak French,” Draco says, “it’s a funny thing that happens sometimes when you live in France for most of your life.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry know Draco’s being sarcastic, but living in France sounds genuinely nice to him. Harry’s never even been to London proper before.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Before he can say so, Draco asks hotly, “Do you think this is normal? Wizards mixing with muggles, living in their cities, going to their schools? Hiding what we are?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry doesn’t know. Clearly, the right answer is <em>no, </em>but, “I don’t even know what a muggle is,” Harry tells Draco.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There’s hiding now? Harry had just started to believe the way the Durlseys had tried to bury any mention of magic was the exception. That even if regular people didn’t believe magic was real, they wanted it to be.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Then again, Draco had told him from the beginning that Harry shouldn’t tell other people about being a wizard.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Maybe there was something <em>wrong </em>with magic.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco stands up and paces a few times in agitation. Then he stops on the far side of the bookshelves, arms crossed over his chest. Harry looks down at the open book in his lap so he doesn’t have to look at Draco’s face. The page he’s turned to could be explaining how to turn people into frogs, or it could be about field crops in the 11th century. The pictures are a little ambiguous.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry wonders if Draco regrets talking to him that first day at school. He wonders if Draco’s decided inviting Harry home and taking him away from his relatives and giving him different clothes and talking about magic was all a waste of time after all.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You really don’t know anything, do you?” Draco asks eventually. He’s still standing, and Harry’s still sitting, so Draco is literally looking down on him right now.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s much quieter than Harry expected him to be. Harry had expected him to yell, but he’s barely even raising his voice.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I guess I don’t,” Harry says, which is an understatement, and then holds his mouth closed so tightly he can hear his jaw creaking.<br/><br/></p><p class="western">Draco makes a sort of frustrated groan and sits back down beside Harry. “A muggle is everyone who isn’t a witch or a wizard,” he explains with the thinnest veneer of patience, “or a squib, like your aunt. And they’re dangerous.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry doesn’t feel like he can look at Draco anymore, which is unfortunate, because Draco seems determined not to say anything else until Harry meets his gaze again.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">When Harry’s eyes are on his again, Draco tell hims emphatically, “This isn’t normal. We had our own world away from all of this. <em>No</em> muggles.” Draco’s eyes are wide and piercing. “But there was a war, before we were born. A war over all of Britain.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That had not been in any of the library books Harry read. The last great magical war according to those books was the one between Merlin and Morgana.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry was going to need new books.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco says, “And that war never really ended. A lot of people on both sides died, but no one agreed on who’d lost. Nothing got any better, everything just got worse.” The last part, Draco says like he’d personally contributed significant effort towards a certain outcome that didn’t happen, even though by his own admission he’d been an infant when it was happening.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Nobody knew who to trust,” Draco continues. He’s still looking at Harry, but his expression is distant, like he’s trying to remember the answers to a test. “It was...dangerous. Neighbors killing neighbors. Witches and wizards killing each other because-- because they didn’t want to be the ones killed. So everyone left.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco closes his eyes and breathes heavily through his nose a few times before he opens them again. He says, “All the wizarding stores and the wizarding schools and the wizarding towns all across Britain went empty. The house I was born in, in Wiltshire? I haven’t been back there since before I can remember.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry’s head feels heavy. He feels like the moment in a dizzy bat relay right after he lifts his head and 5 meters straight ahead may as well be across the other side of the country. There is an entire world where Harry belongs, Draco is telling him, and in the same breath he says it is so dangerous that Harry can never go there.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco puts his hands in his lap, but he’s still staring intensely at Harry’s face. “In France, it was normal. Everyone I knew was a witch or a wizard. But here, you’re the only other wizard I know.”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">“And Borsely,” Harry says, because he feels like it bears mentioning. His knowledge about this entire situation is too scarce and new for him to feel comfortable leaving anything out yet.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco, unswayed, complains, “Borsely doesn’t count. And <em>you</em> don’t know anything.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harsh, but true. There’d been a war that changed the entire course of people’s lives, that had driven Draco’s family from their home in Wiltshire all the way to France and then somehow back again to Surrey, to Stonewall. To Harry.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">How different would Draco’s life have been, if it weren’t for the war? How different would Harry’s own?</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And Harry hadn’t even known anything about this war until ten minutes ago. If this is real, if Harry is a wizard and magic exists, these are things he should know. Fundamental, essential facts about the world and his place in it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“All right,” Harry says, “I don’t know anything. So <em>tell</em> me.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Why can’t you do any magic?” Harry asks. They’re still in front of the book shelves, but now they’re facing each other, knees nearly touching.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That was probably not the best place to start. Draco looks even more sour than he had just a few minutes ago. “Because I’m not supposed to on my own,” he answers. “I’m not allowed.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“What do you mean, ‘not allowed’?” Harry repeats. “Like it’s illegal? Is there--magical law enforcement?” he asks incredulously.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">But Draco says, “Yes,” with a serious expression. “It’s very illegal for underage wizards to go around just practicing magic. And I don’t have my own wand, anyway.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Every single person Harry has met before Draco has also not had a wand, so really, it shouldn’t be such a surprise. Still. “How do you not have a wand? That’s basic wizarding. I know <em>that </em>much.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Father wanted to get me one in France, or Belgium, but Mother says only Ollivander’s will do. And that’s not an option right now.” Draco sighs dramatically at the ceiling. He tilts his head so far back that all Harry can see is the way his jaw connects to his throat and his chin. Draco’s chin is very pointy, especially pointing at the ceiling like that.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Oh,” Harry says. “Well, ok. If... you could do a spell right now,” he continues, and Draco drops his head back down and unfolds his arms, “if you could, what could you do?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco, finally, looks as excited as he had when they first got off the bus. “I know lumos,” he says smoothly, “of course. That’s for when you need a light. Alohomora, for unlocking things. The jelly-legs jinx, and loads of hexes. I know one that’ll give you orange and purple boils absolutely everywhere, and they last for <em>days.”</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Really? I wish you could--not the boil one, or a hex,” Harry says hastily. He drums his fingers against his knees. “One of the others. One that doesn’t hurt.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco smirks. “I <em>can</em>,” Draco reminds him. “Just not now. Some other time. And it’ll be brilliant, you’ll see. Course,” Draco says, drawing it out, tilting his head so he’s looking at Harry slyly from the corner of his eyes. “That’s all just baby stuff. It’s <em>nothing.</em>”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry slides his feet from beneath his knees and wiggles his toes. “What do you mean?”<br/><br/></p><p class="western">“I was supposed to go to Hogwarts this year, learn some real magic.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Is that in France?” Harry frowns, confused. “Did you not go because you came back here?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Does it <em>sound</em> French?” Draco asks with his face scrunched up scornfully, then he answers his own question. “No, it’s not. It’s in Scotland, I think.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“So why didn’t you go?” Harry asks.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Hogwarts,” Draco repeats annoyingly. “It’s a <em>wizarding</em> school.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Oh.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After that, Draco is more manic than sad. By the time the sky’s gone dark with the setting sun instead of just clouds, he’s decided he wants Harry to stay for dinner. But Harry is still in mild disbelief that this afternoon hasn’t turned out to be an exceedingly long dream. He insists on returning to the Dursleys’. He changes back into his own clothes, which are surprisingly dry even though they’ve been sat in a heap beside Draco’s equally wet coat the entire time.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Mrs. Malfoy drives him home. The streetlights are on and it’s the same route he walks every afternoon, but she insists. Draco invites himself along.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">As they’re fastening their seat belts, waiting for Draco’s mother to walk around the front of the car and get in the driver’s seat, Draco leans over and whispers with quiet excitement, “She never drove before in France. Witches don’t drive, you know.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry leans over and whispers back hurriedly, “But she knows how to, right?” He feels suddenly alarmed, watching Mrs. Malfoy draw close to the door, the streetlights outside throwing her long shadow across the front seats.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Oh, yeah,” Draco assures him, “Uncle Severus helped her learn.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Mrs. Malfoy opens the door and gets inside, so Draco stops talking.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It takes just a few minutes in which they don’t crash to get from the Malfoys’ home to the Dursleys’. Harry climbs out of the back with a quick, “Thanks,” shuts the door, and walks up the short path to the front door.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He hopes the front door is unlocked. Mrs. Malfoy, who is slowly unveiling herself as an actively protective force, does not appear to be in the mood to be persuaded away until she’s seen him go inside.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The front door is not unlocked.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">There is a spell for unlocking, he thinks. Harry’s pretty sure Draco mentioned that. He wishes he knew it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry has said the Dursleys do not like him. He’d told Draco, and Draco had not taken him seriously enough. And now here they all are, trapped together in the awkward realisation that the people on the other side of the door have not been eagerly anticipating Harry’s return. In fact, they would be much happier if he just left and never came back.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">It feels like he stands before the front door for a long time, but Harry’s aware that could be because he can hear the car idling in the street behind him, and can see in his mind the way Mrs. Malfoy and Draco must be watching him. Mrs. Malfoy turned just so in the driver’s seat. Draco, seat belt twisted behind him, with his pointy nose pressed close to the window glass and his shoulders set parallel to the door.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The Mrs. Malfoy in Harry’s brain has just become impatient, reaching for the door handle, when Aunt Petunia finally, finally opens the door.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Well, get in,” Aunt Petunia says, and hurries him into the house.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">She closes the door behind him immediately, without a glance out to the curb where Mrs. Malfoy and Draco still sit in the idling car. They stand facing each other in the foyer, Aunt Petunia with her back to the door and Harry with his to the stairs. To the sitting room where Dudley and Uncle Vernon have the television turned up much too loudly.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Aunt Petunia puts her hands on her hips. “I don’t suppose they fed you,” she says with disdain. Never mind the fact that she could rarely be accused of doing the same herself.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“No, Aunt Petunia,” Harry replies.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Well,” she says yet again. “Go on then. Food, and then straight up to your room.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry blinks at her through a paralysing confusion. “Sorry. Up where?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“To your <em>room</em>,” Aunt Petunia repeats, “the bedroom. Upstairs.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry doesn’t have a room upstairs. He has always slept in the cupboard under the stairs. There are three bedrooms in the house, one for his aunt and uncle, one for Dudley, and one for Dudley’s things after he’s broken them.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Do you mean...Dudley’s toy room?” he tries to clarify.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“We talked it over,” Aunt Petunia says, and she is still looking at him, but she is not meeting his eyes. “And we’ve agreed that as a growing boy, it’s time you have a bit more. Space."</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">...What?</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">"So up you go," Aunt Petunia says. "Your uncle already moved all of your things for you.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">With that, Aunt Petunia turns and disappears into the sitting room.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">When Harry checks, his camp cot under the stairs is missing all of his blankets and the second-hand clothes from Dudley are no longer folded on the little jutting shelves. Instead, there’s a pile of broken gifts from birthdays or family trips or just because Dudley threw a tantrum for them in the space Harry’s always slept.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry goes into the kitchen, vaguely light-headed, and eats the slice of ham, the steamed peas, and hard dinner roll still plated on the table. They’re cold. Then he washes up after himself and goes upstairs. The Durlseys are all facing the television when he goes by. None of them looks up.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry flicks on the light in the bedroom that used to hold all of Dudley’s old things. Now, about half of the things Dudley’s discarded inside have been shoved into one corner. Harry’s clothes and school bag are all on the floor, between the narrow bed and the narrow desk pushed up to the room’s only window.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Dudley’s books, not a single one of which is about magic or wizards, are all lined up in the bookshelf beside the desk, untouched.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Ten years living with the Dursleys, and this is the first time Harry has a bedroom. It is objectively an improvement over his previous situation. There are probably less spiders, for one thing. There’s room for an entire bed instead of just a camp cot, for another. There’s a window, so there will always be light during the day at least, and Dudley can’t stomp up the stairs just to make plaster rain down on Harry’s head.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry feels overwhelmed, but not in a good way. Three weeks ago, Harry slept in a cupboard in his aunt and uncle’s house. He was not magic, and he wasn’t special, and he wasn’t wanted. Now, he still wasn’t wanted, mostly, and no matter what Draco says, he might not be magic. And if he’s not magic, then he really isn’t special.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He’s just Harry Potter. And he’s still very much alone.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He barely sleeps that night.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco is not Harry’s first friend. Harry’s first friend was a girl named Riya. Riya wore little gold bracelets, and had thick, dark hair like Harry’s. They were mostly friends because the nursery teacher sat them together at snack time and story time. They were friends up until Riya’s family moved away, right before primary school.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry’s second friend was a ginger boy named Herbert. They weren’t in the same class, but they picked the same corner of the playground during break on the first day of school. Herbert got bullied nearly as much as Harry did, even without Dudley’s influence. Then Dudley did get involved, to make it clear that Herbert’s indifference was worth more than Harry’s companionship. And that was the end of that.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">So Draco’s not Harry’s first friend, or his longest lasting, or even his nicest. But Harry would like this friendship to stick. Third time and all that.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The problem is, Harry doesn’t really know why they’re friends. And that makes it difficult to determine how best to ensure they remain friends.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">They don’t have anything in common (except--well). Draco is judgmental and rude and haughty, sometimes even to Harry. But he always knows exactly which of Dudley’s bullying gang have been the nastiest to Harry on any given day, and he is blatantly pleased with belittling or framing each of them in his turn, often in a manner poetically befitting the way they were most recently awful to Harry. Draco brings all of Harry’s favorite sweets for lunch. And he always, always reacts the same way to seeing Harry after any amount of time apart, which is with unadulterated delight.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">On the one the hand, it’s as if Draco genuinely likes Harry, which is is possible, and definitely Harry’s preferred explanation. On the other hand, Harry hasn’t forgotten that at least part of the reason they’re friends is because Draco’s father and mother want them to be. Enough to move back from France, where they didn’t have to hide or lie, to Little Whinging, where there is decisively no magic, just so Draco could go to Stonewall with Harry.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry hadn’t even introduced himself when they met. Draco had just already known, already been excited.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">That really seemed to call for further investigation.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I need to ask you a question,” Harry says. They’re in Draco’s room again, just a few days after the first time Harry had come to Draco’s house. Harry's sat at Draco’s desk because it’s the only place to sit in Draco’s room other than his bed.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">They both have homework they should be doing--History for Draco, Literature for Harry--so Harry feels a twinge of guilt for bringing it up at all, first, and second for bringing it up now when it’s a distraction, but he can’t sit on it any longer.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco, who is as usual all about distractions, eagerly tosses his textbook to the side and swings his attention to Harry. “So ask.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I need you to answer me truthfully,” Harry prefaces.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">On his bed, Draco makes an impatient expression, the one that involves his lips pulling back on one side so all the teeth there are exposed in a sort of sneer. “Yes, ok, truthfully. As if I’ve <em>lied </em>to you before, Harry, honestly.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry drops his pencil into the binding of his textbook. “You said your father sent you to find me.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">The foot Draco’s got crossed over his knee wiggles a few times, but his expression remains mildly irritated. “No, I didn’t. I said you’re the reason Father is making me show my face at that barbaric muggle prison. Also why I have to write a lousy essay about the Tudors. As if anyone even car--”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry cuts him off before he can build any more steam. “Fine. Your father sent you to Stonewall because he knew I was there. <em>Just</em> because I was there.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You’re not asking a question,” Draco points out in an deliberately infuriating drawl when Harry doesn’t keep going.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Suddenly nervous, Harry tries to take a deep breath, but it sticks halfway down his throat. He pushes around it.<em>“</em>Why?” Harry asks.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s leg stops bouncing. “I can’t tell you that,” he says immediately. He drags his textbook back into his lap and opens it back up.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry feels something in his chest go simultaneously hollow and leaden. “You mean you don’t even know? You’re just doing it because--”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I <em>know,</em>” Draco retorts, glancing quickly up at Harry and then back down at the book. Harry can tell he’s not on the right page. “I just shouldn’t--say why.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Shouldn’t say what why?” Harry asks around his collapsed lungs.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco’s response to the clumsy composition of his sentence is an uncomplimentary look. Then he says, “You wouldn’t take it well.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Flushing, Harry strikes back with an accusatory, “You’ve got to see how this looks.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“How does it look?” Draco demands, clearly losing the battle with himself to end the conversation and go back to his boring muggle homework.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It looks <em>bad</em>, Draco. Like you’re planning to harvest my kidneys, or--or my spleen!” He doesn’t think that will literally happen, but it is the closest he can get to voicing the concern that maybe all of this is because there is something inside of him, something that Draco wants to reach in and take for himself.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">But Draco just asks in confusion, “What would I even do with a human kidney?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Sell it on the black market,” Harry answers.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Is that profitable?” Draco checks.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Is it pro--” He is absolutely not going to tell Draco that. “That’s not the way you reassure someone everything’s normal and fine.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Every time Harry thinks he’s gotten his bearings in his new, magical reality, Draco leads him out over black ice. Harry thought he was uniquely freakish, like his aunt and uncle had always said, but Draco says no. You’re just a wizard. There’s loads of us. Harry thought he’d find community, meet people who were like him and would like him and understand him, but Draco says no. That world is gone, abandoned after a deadly war and all its inhabitants scattered to the wind.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry thought if he just knew what it was that made <em>Draco</em> like him, then they could stay friends, but all Draco will say is I haven’t calculated your net worth in cash, yet, want to lend me a hand?</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Fine.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“What’s in this for you?” Harry asks bluntly.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">.x.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">After a fairly lengthy pause, Draco composes his expression into something somber and concedes, “All right.” Like he wasn’t planning on letting Harry in on the truth all along. He can be dramatic that way, Harry has learned.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“What do you know about your parents?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Nothing,” Harry says, and ignores the weird twist Draco’s face takes. “They’re dead. They died in a car crash when I was really little. What does that-- ”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“They didn’t die in a car crash,” Draco says with an uncomfortable look toward his bedroom door. The door is open. There’d been no reason to close it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry has very little doubt that Draco is telling the truth, but he still asks, “How would <em>you</em> know that?”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Everyone knows that,” Draco assures him. “They died in the war.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">In a way, it’s a relief. It’s like Harry can feel the weight he is beginning to understand in his name sliding off his shoulders and onto theirs.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">So this is all because his parents were war heroes. This growing attention like a creeping vine wasn’t the expectation of what he would build, just curiosity as he takes shelter under the eaves of his parents’ accomplishment. </p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“So that’s why you knew who I was. Because of my parents.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“No, that’s not it,” Draco shakes his head. One last glance at the bedroom door. “Harry. Your parents were murdered by one of the strongest wizards of our time. He killed hundreds and hundreds of people. He tried to kill <em>you. </em>But he couldn’t.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry just stares at him.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco says, “And there are a lot of people around who’d like another chance at it.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You said everyone left after the war.” It doesn’t sound like Harry’s voice. It sounds lost, and childish, and too quiet for Draco to even hear.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">But Draco does hear it. And Draco answers,  “Not everyone.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"> </p>
