    <span>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>   “Not Slytherin? No, it’s too late, I've made my choice, better be- SLYTHERIN!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stood and handed the hat back to Professor McGonagall as a hush fell over the great hall, the whispers of a few curious muggleborns the only sound. Keeping his head down, he walked swiftly towards the Slytherin table, taking a seat at the far end. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Professor McGonagall resumed her list, he felt a nudge against his shoulder and looked up to find a blonde haired witch extending her hand towards him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daphne Greengrass, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He cautiously took her hand, shaking it. “Harry Potter.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a snort from further down the table. “Yeah, we know who you are. The Boy-Who-Lived, our </span>
  <em>
    <span>Savior</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” The upper year sneered at him, the words sounding like poison.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- I'm sorry?” Harry offered, to a bout of uproarious laughter. McGonagall didn’t even pause, taking twenty points from Slytherin in the same breath as she called the next name. Several students looked as though they wanted to continue the conversation, but a harsh whisper from a girl that Harry assumed was a Prefect shut them down. Taking the opportunity, Daphne gestured around the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s Millicent Bulstrode, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Bulstrode; Gregory Goyle of the Noble House of Goyle; Vincent Crabbe, of the Noble House of Crabbe; Pansy Parkinson, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Parkinson; Theodore Nott, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Nott; and Draco Malfoy, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy. Oh, and that’s Davis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um… Nice to meet you all,” he offered, and the girl Daphne had called Pansy sniffed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, he’s as bad as a muggle! Don’t you have any manners?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, leave him be, Parkinson. We all know he’ll have himself resorted into Gryffindor in a few days. Now shut up, Dumbledore’s talking.” Nott reprimanded her, prompting Harry to look back up towards the staff table and catch the tail end of Dumbledore’s sentence. “-who does not wish to die a very painful death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Harry whispered, aghast, but Daphne placed a hand on his arm. “Don’t worry about it, father says he’s completely mad. I wouldn’t put much stake in anything he says.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”  Temporarily mollified, he jumped slightly as food appeared on the table in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the matter, Potter, never heard of a house elf before?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“A what?”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>After dinner, Harry found himself trailing behind the others as the prefects guided them to their new dorm rooms. He had to strain to hear the password (Ouroboros) before he found himself ushered inside. Black leather couches sat in front of the blazing fireplace, with bookshelves and desks lining the wall, and the whole room was filled with an eerie green light. Candles sat on every table, and snakes adorned the walls. Harry found himself thinking that the whole thing felt oddly comforting as a short witch with dark hair stood before them, clapping her hands for their attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Prefect Farley, and this is your home for the next seven years. Those standing next to you are your new brothers and sisters, because Slytherin house is a family. As does any family, we have rules- rules which are to be followed without question. The first of these is loyalty, which you may see as a Hufflepuff trait, but it is the key to your success. Outside these walls, we stand as one. As a house, we are hated and feared; do not allow others to see you as anything other than a united front. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Secondly, first years are to stick together in groups of two or more at all times outside of the common room and dormitories. If your yearmates are occupied and it is an educational matter, one of the elder years will escort you. This rule is for your own safety. Third, anyone with any concerns for the safety or health of another student, your own safety, or an educational concern is to report them to a Prefect or Professor Snape, your new head of house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And last but not least, don’t get caught. As that concludes the rules, allow me to introduce your head of house, Professor Snape.” She stepped to the side as a hook-nosed Professor glided out of the shadows, startling the first years. His hair glinted in the candlelight as he sneered down at them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have high hopes for this year’s students- let us hope you do not dash them before the year formally starts. I am Professor Snape, Potions Master and as mentioned, your head of house. Prefect Farley has done an adequate job of summarizing the rules of Slytherin House, so let me explain to you a few of Slytherin’s other principles. Around you are bookshelves that contain two copies of each book you may need during your stay at Hogwarts. These books are not meant to leave the common room and are to be shared among your peers. While collaboration is encouraged, plagiarism is not tolerated under any circumstances. Tomorrow night, following dinner, all first year students are to undergo a mandatory health screening. Lights out for first years is at eight PM, and any student found out of their bed after this time will be punished severely. Should you ever have a question on any assignment, you may speak to a Prefect, or you may ask me on Tuesdays and Thursdays after dinner. No one is exempt from these rules, regardless of status, be it blood or nobility, or… celebrity. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were scattered nods, and a chorus of “Yes, sir”s from the group of eleven-year-olds before the Professor turned on his heel and disappeared behind a thick oak door with a billow of this robes.</span>
