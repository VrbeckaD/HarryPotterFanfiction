    <p>Although she had been but a baby, the screams of the Mad Minister would rip through her dreams every night for the rest of her life. He dropped to the floor as limp as a ragdoll when his life was taken from him, a green stream of light the only evidence as to what had pierced his soul and extinguished the fire burning there. Jaime Lannister sheathed his weapon, wand slipping silently into place by his side, nearly reaching his knee. He stared at his handiwork with a smug sort of glee. Aerys II Targaryen lay face down on the floor, silver hair melting into red as his cracked skull sagged apart.

Every one of the magical officers in the room complied, boots stomping in rhythm to the thundering rain on the roof on the Ministry. His work finished, Jaime smiled, a chilling grin stretching across his charming features. A woman’s hand draped around his torso from behind, a silver gilded lion ring nestled on her left ring finger. </p><p>“No one can compete with us now. We’ll have the girl soon, and then we’ll have England,” Although he did not have quite the same confidence as her, he nodded.</p><p>“Yes, we will,” </p><p>Two pale lips met in the cool October moonlight, the smell of death fresh in the air.
