    <p>Thunder rumbled above the pure white puppy that was running away from a certain situation. The puppy whimpered when lightning flashed on his right. He slowed his pace for a moment only to jump at another crash of thunder echoed. The moment he felt the first raindrop hit his fur; the puppy panicked. The Samoyed just ran as fast as his legs could take him. He wanted to avoid the rain as much as possible, but soon enough it was starting to downpour, drenching him from head to toe. The puppy tried to think of positive things as he ran away from his home with just the clothes on his back and his wand.  </p><p>The Animagus was scared. And screwed. </p><p>He only knew of one place to go – he just hoped that he was heading in the right directions. The moment he ran from his home, the Knight Bus did find him, just like it did for any lost or strained witch or wizard. However, the Animagus didn’t want the Ministry to find out about him running from home. He didn’t need the Ministry of Magic coming to his “<em> rescue </em>” and bringing him back to his parents.  </p><p>When Woo Hanse figured out he could turn himself into an animal, his family began to hate him more than they already did. Then he was sorted into Hufflepuff house instead of Ravenclaw, that was the last straw in his parents’ eyes. Hanse was a one child that his parents gave him the bare essentials to get through Hogwarts and at home, but once they were invited to parties, Hanse was always forced to be someone he wasn’t.  </p><p>What made Hanse run away from home, and most likely get him disowned was the fact his older brother found out that Hanse was interested in guys over girls. Hanse didn’t put a label on himself, all he did was find guys more attractive than girls. His brother flipped out and he told their mother and father over dinner with their grandparents and some business clients of their father’s. Hanse hadn’t seen that look on his father’s face in <em> a long time </em>. And seeing the disappointed looks on his grandparents faces made Hanse feel more like an outsider than their grandson. </p><p>He tried to explain himself to his family, but his father ordered him from the room. They didn’t want to even <em> hear  </em>Hanse’s side of the confession. Hanse left the dining room and ran the whole way to his bedroom. When the door closed behind him, Hanse let all his emotions freely come forward. The Hufflepuff didn’t understand how his parents could be so cold him and just ignore the fact that their son was interested in different things. He wasn’t the smartest, but he was brilliant in other areas, they just refuse to see it.  </p><p>Hanse kept to himself for the rest of the night until his father entered the room after the clients left. The Hufflepuff panicked – and now he had run away from home, heading in the direction he hoped was the right direction. The Samoyed paused for a brief moment, whining and whimpering softly when the scent started to decrease around him. The puppy started to worry about his travels.  </p><p>When the Knight Bus arrived to pick him up, he was brought to the Leaky Cauldron. The fourteen-year-old couldn’t have that. Before the owner realized that Hanse was there and the bus disappeared as quickly as it appeared, Hanse transformed into his puppy form and ran off. Since the Ministry had no idea about him being an Animagus, it just looked like a lost puppy, so Tom didn’t even the puppy a second thought. Hanse hoped that the Minister had the pea soup after that.  </p><p>The Hufflepuff’s fur was stuck to his body and he was shivering as he ran through the pouring rain. It just <em> had to  </em>rain that evening – it just threw another wrench into Hanse’s horrible evening. Hanse was trying to remember the location of the house he needed. He had been there twice since starting Hogwarts almost four years, but he was getting conflicting smells. The Samoyed whimpered when more thunder crashed overhead, scaring him. Hanse wasn’t the biggest fan of thunderstorms, even since he was a baby. His parents always complained about him crying when a thunderstorm started.  </p><p>The Samoyed kept himself as hidden as possible as he made his way down the Muggle street – his one and only friend, his best friend lived on said street. She lived with his parental grandparents after they won custody of her at five-years-old. Melody Vale grew up with her grandparents and they loved her dearly. Hanse knew that Melody would help him, she loved him. Ever since they found each other by accident at Hogwarts, in the Forbidden Forest, Melody and Hanse became friends and a little <em> pack </em>.  </p><p>The fourteen-year-old's tail was between his legs as he wandered the long and large street of the Muggle community. Hanse gulped as he stopped by each house, sniffing through the rain the best he could until he could pick up on Melody’s scent. The Samoyed was so lost, cold and scared that he hid himself inside a bush to escape the rain. He guessed he needed to wait it out until he could truly find the Vale home.  </p><p>He hoped he was in the right neighborhood. He only had been to Melody’s twice – both for the Easter holiday for the past two years. His parents didn’t celebrate Easter and forced Hanse to stay at Hogwarts while they planned things around his two older siblings, like his sister’s engagement party last April, which he missed. Not that he cared, Hanse disliked his sister’s fiancé or his brother's girlfriend. So, he was happy he missed the party to begin with. He did send his sister an engagement gift, it was sent back to the store for store credit and a Howler from his mother about getting his sister a <em> horrible  </em>engagement gift. Hanse decided to stop giving his family gifts after that.  </p><p>Hanse yelped as lightning crashed and thunder rumbled. He jumped and he realized he was currently taking shelter in a rose bush. The thorns were scraping and cutting at his skin. He sunk down, whimpering to himself. Where was Melody’s house? Hanse knew the color of the house; it was a deep blue color. It stood out in the neighborhood – maybe he took the wrong road? Shivering against the wind and the chill of the rain, Hanse had no choice but to stay hidden from the rain the best he could and hoped that he found Melody soon.  </p><p>The Hufflepuff lowered his head to his paws, watching the cars zoom up and down the street that early evening. He didn’t quite understand Muggle technology. His parents didn’t allow him to take Muggle Studies or even be around Muggles. Too mad that Melody’s grandparents were Muggles – her father was a Muggleborn and her mother was a pureblood. She was exposed to Muggle stuff as birth, and now she stayed in a Muggle town to be further into the culture. And her grandparents refused to move closer to her maternal grandparents, she no longer has contact with her parents or her grandparents on her mother’s side.  </p><p>‘<em>Melody, where are you?’ </em> Hanse thought.  </p><p>He tried to snuggle himself further into the bush but he yelped and growled at the thorns stabbing him. Hanse had to find another hiding place, one where no one could actually see him and accidentally call animal control. It would be a hard conversation if animal control got involved and Hanse transformed back into a human. He didn’t need the Ministry finding out either. Hanse crawled out from under the bush, looking around. The rain was still coming down – he jumped when something hard hit his head.  </p><p>Looking up toward the darkened sky, he realized it was starting to <em> hail </em>  now. ‘ <em> Oh, bloody fantastic!’ </em> Hanse took off running, trying to avoid the falling pieces of frozen rain. However, the pieces seemed to aim themselves at Hanse, hitting him in the head and back. It didn’t feel very nice to be hit by the pellets of hail. The fourteen-year-old continued to run as fast as he could, even though he was growing tired.  </p><p>Hanse felt like he was pushing himself to the limit with keeping himself as a puppy – it was well past the point he normally stayed as a Samoyed. He could feel the magic being strained for the length of transformation. The hail didn’t help either.  </p><p><em> ‘Melody!’  </em>He cried as if the Gryffindor could hear him. </p><p>Melody Vale stood on the closed in porch of her grandparents’ remodeled home, watching the storm roll in. She closed her eyes, feeling the wind on her face. Her grandmother stood behind her, watching her granddaughter smile at the weather. “You are quite the character, Mel,” she commented with a sweet smile. Melody looked over her shoulder at her grandmother, smiling brightly. The moment she went to open her mouth, she heard the cry.  </p><p>The Gryffindor’s head snapped toward the familiar cry. “Melody?” Ignoring her grandmother, Melody was confused. She <em> shouldn’t  </em> be hearing the cries of a  <em> Samoyed </em>. None of the neighbors had one and no one had puppies either. Melody listened carefully for a moment until she heard it again. Grabbing the umbrella, she yanked open the screen door. “Melody!” Her grandmother tried to stop her but Melody ran straight into the height of the storm. Popping open the umbrella that was most likely going to break with the wind and the sizable hail, Melody ran straight into the street. “Hanse!”  </p><p>The Samoyed skidded to a stop the moment he heard his best friend’s shout. He was on the wrong side of the street – he needed to take the street before the one he was currently on. Darting across the street, nearly getting hit in the process and getting yelled at by a Muggle, Hanse ran through the narrow path between the two houses that were next to each other. Melody shouted over the thunder the crashed, having Hanse stop and whimper. Melody looked around, looking for the white puppy that she knew and loved. “Hanse!” She screamed, dropping the umbrella and running toward the puppy on the other side of the road. </p><p>Her grandparents were shouting from the porch about Melody being reckless. However, the moment they saw the sixteen-year-old picking up a soaking wet mass of white fur. Melody was shocked to see her best friend in her neighborhood, how did he get there? How long had he been outside – he was <em> freezing </em> and soaking wet. Melody carefully walked back to her home with Hanse in her arms. The puppy was shivering and whimpering as he tried to take the warmth from Melody. Her grandfather met them halfway, wrapping two towels around the each of them.  </p><p>The moment her grandmother saw the puppy, she knew it was Hanse. They knew that Melody and Hanse were Animagi and could transform into dogs. It was entertaining to watch them be playful as dogs. “Oh, Hanse,” the puppy whined as Lyla Vale gently looked him over. “Eric, start the fire.” She ordered her husband in passing as they entered the house.  </p><p>Melody pushed between her grandparents, hurrying straight to the bathroom. She needed to get Hanse cleaned up before he transformed back into his human self. Setting the Samoyed down carefully in the large tub, Melody began to gently rub the towel into Hanse’s fur, listening to the pained noises coming from his mouth. “Hanse,” the Samoyed turned his head to look at Melody, there were tears in her eyes. “What happened?” Hanse <em> always  </em>threatened to rub away from home, but Melody never thought he was serious about it. Hanse lowered his head, looking away from the Gryffindor. “Will you tell me once you are back to normal?” The puppy nodded his head.  </p><p>The Gryffindor cleaned Hanse the best she could, but she needed to see if he was hurt. As soon as she turned her back to him to toss the soiled towels out into the hall, Hanse hissed as he forced himself to become human again. Mel’s head snapped toward him, mouth falling open. The state of her best friend made her blood turn cold. Minus the obvious bruising from being hit by the falling hail, the <em> more </em>  concerning aspect was that Hanse had  <em> a black eye and a busted lip </em>. Her heart broke instantly. She didn’t even want to know what else were bruised and beaten. Collecting herself for a moment, “Let’s get you out of these soaked clothes. Where’s your wand?” Hanse pulled his wand from the sleeve of his shirt, handing it over to Mel, flinching as he did.  </p><p>It took several minutes to peel the soaked clothes from his body and Melody had to keep in her rage. She plugged up the tub and allowed the showerhead to rain down on Hanse. Melody made sure it wasn’t burning hot but warm enough that Hanse could get clean. She’d have to talk to her grandparents when Hanse passed out later on that evening. Mel couldn’t even look at what Hanse had to go through before he ran from his home earlier that evening.  </p><p>Hanse felt safe enough to start crying in front of his best friend. Melody didn’t know her grandfather was peering into the bathroom to see how everything was going. Mel was leaned over the edge of the tub, hugging Hanse. “They can never hurt you again, Hanse. You are safe here, no one will hurt you here.” She whispered, her voice cracked, allowing the tears to fall with her best friend’s.  </p><p>Eric growled. <em> Bastards</em>. </p>
