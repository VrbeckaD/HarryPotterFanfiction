    <p>You knew right from the start that being a soulmate to someone like Newt Scamander would be trouble. There was no easy way to be matched and married to someone who ran around with a suitcase full of endangered or stigmatized beasts. (You had initially tried to find such a way early on before realizing it was more work than what you could really offer and decided to just leave it be.)<br/>
But when all was said and done, everything about your Newt was complicated: adventurous yet he kept to himself; a pacifist but also a fighter (for animal rights, but nevertheless); fragile but also able to take an erumpent charge to the back. The only things about him that were completely straightforward were his stance on animals and his complete adoration for you, shown in his eyes whenever he came back from wherever.<br/>

And that was why, when he’d come home riddled with scars or bruises from his latest adventure, you would never hesitate to drop what you were doing, open up your arms, and embrace him. Little by little, with every cuddle, the dark marks and bites would fade away until they were mostly a memory.<br/>
Of course, the particularly bad ones would still leave scars but what else could you expect? Everything involving Newt was complicated. And frankly, you weren’t sure you could really have it any other way than what it was now.</p>
