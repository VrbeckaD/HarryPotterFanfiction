<p>[“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly. “We are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. You will find that similar powers are needed for this… Brace yourself, now. <em>Legilimens!</em>”</p>
<p>Snape struck before Harry was ready before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance. The office swam in front of his eyes and vanished; image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings.]</p>
<p>
  <em>The vision of Mr Weasley being bitten, the taste of blood in his mouth, the dreams, memories, flashes granted by Voldemort…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It was the summer previous; The Dementors swooping down, the sense of despair and loneliness…Vernon had come home drunk and raging, he felt the lash of the belt across his back…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Voldemort rising from the cauldron… Cedric Diggory lying on the ground by him, eyes blank and staring… The Second Task and the overwhelming fear of going near the water, the knowledge he couldn’t swim, that he would die in their black depths, the crushing cold… Facing the dragon, knowing he would die burning in agony…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The summer between his Third and Fourth years, Petunia had been angry that her plants had died in the heat so she had shoved his head into a barrel of water until he stopped struggling, yanking him out of the water and kicking him until he breathed again… Dudley beating him until he fell unconscious… Curled up in the corner of his bare room bleeding, hunger gnawing at his stomach…</em>
</p>
<p>He could feel the presence in his mind pause before pressing in deeper. He didn’t have the strength to resist. Everything hurt, knowing that he had something to do with Mr Weasley's injuries, that Voldemort could access his mind at will, he was a liability. He should have run, should have disappeared into the muggle world, they were better off without him.</p>
<p>
  <em>The Dementors in Third year, swooping down, all happiness being sucked away… Facing a werewolf and the terror of imminent death… Falling from his broom at the match when the Dementors arrived…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The summer between Second and Third year, the beatings… Marge setting her dog on him… the hunger… The aching loneliness, huddled in the corner of his room… The fear of blowing Marge up and desperately escaping before he was killed by Vernon’s rage…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The fear in the Chamber, the knowledge of his pending death by basilisk and the sense of welcome that washed over him… Going into the forest to meet with the Acromantula… Hermione in the hospital wing, curly hair splayed over the pillow… The fear and isolation from the school hating him when he was only trying to stop the snake from attacking…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The summer between First and Second year, not having any contact with his friends, believing it was all a dream, Dobby appearing and telling him he couldn’t return… More beatings, fists and belts and rods, always underscored by the aching gnawing hunger… Struggling through chores only to fail and be beaten again…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The fear and pain from his confrontation with Quirrell, willing to sacrifice himself and his pathetic existence if it saved his new friends… Seeing Fluffy and the horror of being faced with a three-headed dog… The pain of his first week at Hogwarts when he ate too much because there was so much food and he couldn’t control himself, flashes of him throwing up after every meal…</em>
</p>
<p>He knew what would be next and found something in himself to resist. The cupboard, he couldn’t go back there, couldn’t face the claustrophobia, the loneliness, the overwhelming sense of isolation, of being unworthy, hated, a freak, nothing more than a burden. He pushed, a glimpse of that tiny dark space enough to spur him on. Dredging up the last of his reserves he shoved Snape from his mind.</p>
<p>The cold stone of the floor was the first thing he registered as he slowly came back to himself. Eyes fluttered open and he realised he was lying sprawled out on the floor. He could see Snape’s boots and the underneath of his desk. His brain couldn’t help but notice the dust accumulated under it. He could hear harsh breathing filling the space. Everything hurt as he slowly pushed himself upright, not looking up. Instead, he turned and shuffled from the room.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Severus, for the first time in a long time, was at a loss. He wasn’t sure what he had expected of this lesson; well that was a lie, he knew exactly what he expected. He expected to find the vapid self-absorbed memories of a spoiled prince. He had been told, on numerous occasions, that the boy had been raised in the lap of luxury, wanting for nothing, being educated in the wizarding world and its ways prior to Hogwarts. He had been told that the boy had received training prior to his admittance to the school.</p>
<p>What he found was something entirely different. The boy had practically no defence around his mind, the broken shards of a shield brushed away with little pretence. All pureblood children, who were raised in the wizarding ways, had at least rudimentary shields in place around their minds to protect family secrets. Some of the memories he had expected but… His mind struggled to process the realities of what he had to face versus his preconceived notions.</p>
<p>He was so lost in thought he didn’t even realise he was alone, Potter’s bag still sitting next to the door. Whirling, he pressed his wand to his temple, withdrawing the memory of what he had just experienced and dropping it into the pensive. Putting all his thoughts and feelings away behind his Occlumency shields, he exhaled until he was empty of opinion or notion.</p>
<p>Plunging into the pensive, he observed Harry Potter, for the first time in his life without expectations and was stunned.</p>
<p>The boy was not his father. Was so far from his father it was difficult to believe he had ever thought that way, to begin with.</p>
<p>Connections finally began making themselves known in his mind. The boy had always been smaller than his year mates while his father had been one of the taller in their year. His father had made the perfect Chaser; broad, strong, exuberant, while the boy was small, lithe and quiet, appropriate placed as a Seeker. Lily had not been a petite woman either, strong and tall and full-figured.</p>
<p>He realised that it wasn’t arrogance that drove the boy, but a genuine lack of self-worth, the belief that he was nothing, so was always willing to risk himself for others. The self-sacrificing nobility did not stem from over-inflated self-worth. His lack of trust in authority was based on the fact no one had ever stepped in to help him. Potter had been abandoned by adults at every turn. He couldn’t imagine how he had missed the relationship the boy had with food, the way he related to people, clinging to those who accepted him even when they cast him aside.</p>
<p>He wondered what it was that had caused the boy to finally push him from his mindscape. There had been so much revealed that was tragic, what could be worse? What memory haunted the boy so much that he couldn’t revisit it. There was that final flash, a glimpse of darkness, aching loneliness, hunger, pain, a sense of being enclosed in a small space.</p>
<p>Shaking off his irrelevant curiosity, he considered his options. It was highly unlikely that Dumbledore was unaware of the situation. Dumbledore had placed the boy with his family; Severus remembered Petunia and her attitude about magic, anyone who knew Lily knew about her sister.</p>
<p>The Headmaster had to have been aware on some level that abuse was occurring and had ignored it. Why? What purpose did it serve to have a broken hero front their campaign? Perhaps the goal wasn’t to have him broken, just willing to sacrifice himself for others as had been demonstrated almost every year since the boy had started school.</p>
<p>If Dumbledore was aware, that meant he was actively covering the abuse. Poppy was required to complete health checks on every student at the start of the year. Either she was complicit or was being forced into obedience. While he could believe Dumbledore of the deception, he struggled to believe the matron would risk her healers’ vows over a child.</p>
<p>Blinking out of his reverie, he realised the boy had already left and a frown creased his forehead. Striding from the room, he made his way to the Hospital Wing, pushing open the doors, he waited for Poppy to appear. Self-respecting adults did not shout, especially not when wards would alert the woman to his presence.</p>
<p>“Severus? Is everything alright?” Concern laced her voice as she tied her dressing gown closed. It was after curfew apparently; time had gotten away from him.</p>
<p>“Poppy, I have discovered something a little off and I wondered if you could shed some light on a situation with a student?” He flicked his eyes towards her office.</p>
<p>“Of course, I will help however I can. Come, let us relax in my office, I will call for some tea.” She bustled off, summoning a house-elf once she entered the room.</p>
<p>Once the tea arrived, Severus cast a series of detection charms, when they came up clear, he cast several wards ensuring nothing would be overheard. The matron raised a brow as she sipped her tea and waited for his explanation. He had always appreciated Poppy’s no-nonsense attitude. He prepared his own cup and settled himself across the desk from her and considered the best way to attack the situation.</p>
<p>“Poppy, I know that at the start of every school year, you carry out a full diagnostic of all students to ensure they are in good health.” He paused to take a sip, waiting for her nod of acknowledgement. “Are there any students that do not receive the health check?”</p>
<p>“Of course, there are a few students every year that opt out of the health check. I am informed in each case of their personal healer and as such, I only treat any injuries or issues that they experience while at Hogwarts. Their general care is handled by someone selected by their parents or magical guardian.” She did not ask him why; she knew that he would share whatever he could. She knew he wouldn’t ask unless it was important.</p>
<p>Silence settled over the pair as Severus considered how best to ask the question. Unfortunately, his options were limited. With a sigh, he set down his teacup.</p>
<p>“Is Harry Potter one such student?”</p>
<p>The matron’s eyebrow quirked up and she mirrored his action, fine china clacking against the desk.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, he is. Dumbledore informed me that he receives the best care from his personal healer, and I am not to perform a deep scan on the boy. I am only permitted to treat any injuries he receives while at Hogwarts, which, admittedly, is a lot. All of the paperwork submitted was in order.”</p>
<p>Worry creased her forehead when the Potions Master didn’t say anything. “Severus? Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Something has gone wrong Poppy. I have seen something which indicates he is not receiving any form of care, in actuality, he is possibly being abused.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry paced the darkened halls of Hogwarts. It was after curfew and the stones echoed with his shuffling footsteps. Eventually, he found himself at the base of an abandoned tower, dust thick on the floor. In a haze, he wandered up the stairs until he stepped out onto a balcony that ran around the top floor of the tower.</p>
<p>Looking around, he huffed and sprawled out on the hard stone, staring off into the star-strewn sky. It was cold out, the sting of winter in the air. It helped burn off the fog in his mind.</p>
<p>He had been discovered. His shame, his secret. Ever since he had come to Hogwarts, he had worked to keep it from everyone. His bruised and battered body hidden under baggy clothes. It wasn’t like anyone noticed anyway, all they saw was a miniature of his father, failing to see that he was consistently smaller than the other boys in his year. Malnutrition and constantly broken bones caused him to grow small and stunted.</p>
<p>But no one saw. Either that or they didn’t want to see. That thought haunted him. The thought that he had been left with the Dursleys, that someone had known or at least had an idea of what would happen to him. The idea that someone had seen him in that first year and had turned away.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had turned him away. That first year when he had begged not to return to his relatives and had been sent back. So he had stopped trying, accepting that this was his lot in life, that this was what he deserved. He was poison, everyone around him died or was hurt, things always went wrong. So his summers were his penance, his punishment for failure.</p>
<p>For the first time in a long time, he exhaled and allowed the glamours he wore constantly to dissolve. He felt exposed, raw. Having Snape rifle through his mind had stripped him bare, forcing him to face his life.</p>
<p>Whenever he came to the school, he tried to forget, just for a little while, what his life was like. Stepping into the role of the Boy-Who-Lived, behaving as everyone expected.</p>
<p>His house of cards had come tumbling down.</p>
<p>Part of him hoped that Snape would ignore what he had seen but thinking back over the look of absolute horror on the man’s face, Harry knew that something would come of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the man would think to save him? He was not worth saving.</p>
<p>Perhaps he would take up the mantle of punishment during the school year? He deserved it. He was poison, a freak, abnormal, he did not deserve family, friends, freedom.</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help but think that irrespective of what Snape wanted to do, nothing would change. He would be pushed into the firing line and would succeed by the skin of his teeth. Bloody, battered and bruised he would be sent back to the Dursleys for his yearly conditioning only to repeat it again.</p>
<p>He slid an icy cold hand inside his robes and under his shirt, tracing his fingers over his ribs. Unconsciously, he began counting them, numbers soothed his anxious mind. He could feel the scars stretching across his skin. He could no longer remember what scars belonged to which beatings. Still, tracing the jagged lines, the ropey marks, calmed something in his agitated mind.</p>
<p>He watched the moon creep over the sky. He knew he should go back to the common room. Hermione and Ron would have been waiting for him to return, to complain at length about Snape. He couldn’t bring himself to move. The idea of facing whatever was waiting for him was simply exhausting. After being broken open so violently, he wasn’t sure he could put the mask back on.</p>
<p>Curling onto his side, he tugged his robes tightly around his body. His gaze drifted out over the grounds, the Forbidden Forest rustling in the distance. He could feel the hard stone under his hip, unforgiving, punishing, just like he deserved. He should have been better, should have been able to keep his memories from Snape. Huffing out a sigh, he mentally shook his head. But of course, he wasn’t better. He wasn’t intelligent like Hermione, he wasn’t clever like Ron. He was the stupid little freak who routinely lead people into danger. Who got people killed. A flash of Cedric’s cold dead eyes sucked the breath from his body.</p>
<p>They had become friends of a sort during the tournament. Cedric, of course, had been happy with Cho, but Harry had carried a flame for the older boy. He had never done anything about it, little freaks didn’t deserve relationships, didn’t deserve love. And he had gotten his first crush killed. He knew, now, without a doubt, that he could never burden someone with himself.</p>
<p>He wasn’t stupid, he knew he was going to die, knew that he wouldn’t see out the war. His purpose was simply to take Voldemort down with him. He had accepted this. Honestly, he was looking forward to the end. His existence was agony so he could only hope that the end would come soon, that he could fulfil his purpose and end things before too many others died.</p>
<p>He allowed his thoughts to drift, eyes staring unseeing into the night as his fingers resumed tracing his ribs. The moon slid across the sky, slipping below the horizon and still, he didn’t move. He was taking too much of a risk by remaining, but still, the will to move abandoned him. Someone would find him eventually and he would paste on his Boy-Who-Lived face and continue on. Until then, he would watch the sunrise and remember to breathe.</p>
