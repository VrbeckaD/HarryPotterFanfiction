  <span>Bellatrix bit her hand to muffle her frustrated shout. Hermione rolled Bella’s pant leg up and grimaced. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s dislocated,” she said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix barked out a harsh laugh. “Let’s go </span>
  <em>
    <span>camping</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Bella!” She spoke in a high mocking voice. “It’ll be </span>
  <em>
    <span>fun</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Bella! Muggles do it all the </span>
  <em>
    <span>time</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Bella!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione frowned. “Things are usually fine. If you had been watching where you were going, you wouldn’t have tumbled down a steep and <em>obvious</em> hill.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And if </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> hadn’t insisted on such an inane and </span>
  <em>
    <span>worthless</span>
  </em>
  <span> activity - muggles truly have </span>
  <em>
    <span>no</span>
  </em>
  <span> sense - ”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“My parents took me camping,” Hermione said softly, not meeting Bella’s eyes. “I loved camping when I was a child. After that year Harry, Ron and I spent on the run, I thought it had been ruined for me. I thought...maybe if I shared it with you...maybe I could love it again.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix’s stomach dropped. “Pet...”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione laughed, her eyes watery. “It was a silly idea. Stupid, really.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Pet, I’m sor - ”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With a quick movement, Hermione did something to Bellatrix’s knee. Bellatrix couldn’t be sure what it was, but she shoved her hand into her mouth to muffle her scream.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I relocated it. Come on, let’s get back and get you checked out at St. Mungo’s. I’ll pack up. Stay here.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stood and strode back to the tent without a backward glance. Bellatrix bit her lip. How was she going to fix this?</span>
