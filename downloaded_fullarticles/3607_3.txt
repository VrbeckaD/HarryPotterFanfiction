Not Daniel Radcliffe, but as young Asa Butterfield. It kinda fit because of his look and his eyes, WOW, his eyes. They are beautiful and also unique. I mean, you can imagine someone else, whomever you prefer. Here are few suggestions: Logan Lerman,Timothée Chalamet, Troye Sivan :D</p><p> </p><p> <img src="https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/_resources/img/m/mary-garden-woods-hole-mass-01.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="244" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3753571874" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p> This is the backyard that the boy slept in, just imagine there's no statue or gazebo and there you have it. Well, the one in my mind was better, more dirt and vegetables but I'm sure you can add some features to it yourself. Just imagine a place that isn't suitable for any child to sleep in. lol</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>And this other specimen is named Elijah. Yes, sexy indeed. Say thank you to their parents for creating them. Yum... anywhoo, now off to the start of the story.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Beginning</strong>
</p><p>SPLASH! The sound of water being thrown onto his face. He jolted awake at the sudden heat on his skin.</p><p>“Wake up, slave! Make us breakfast now!” The woman yellled, annoyed to see his face. She walked out of the small room, mumbling vulgar words which he was used to hearing every day. “NOW!” She yelled again.</p><p>The 5 year old boy stood and headed to the kitchen as fast as lightning, not caring that his face felt like melting or blisters forming on his neck, arms and thighs. He will mend to them later when he has the time, he thought. The table was still empty, no plates or utensils yet. The only indication that he didn’t oversleep. He prepared everything on the table first and took out eggs, bacon and sausages from the fridge and canned beans from the cupboard. Once the pan was hot, he cracked some eggs and fried bacon on the side. Almost done, he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. A fat man with a dirty beard came into the kitchen, sneering at the sight of the thin weak boy and sat on the chair that looked like it would break from his weight.</p><p>“Come on! Faster, will you!” he said, resting a leg up on the other chair.</p><p>The boy nodded and brought the food to the table and placed them on his plate. Heading back to clean up, the man pulled his leg out, causing the boy to trip and fall, spilling the still hot oil all over himself. The boy stood up quickly to rush to the sink and clean the oil off under cold water but was pulled back by his hair.</p><p>“Look what you’ve done! You ruined the carpet, you little shit!” the man exclaimed, pulling back his other hand to hit the boy’s face. The boy fell to the floor, blood dripping from his mouth, blisters popping.</p><p>The woman from earlier came and looked at him on the floor. “First the oil, now blood and puss. You are ruining my expensive carpet!!” she kicked him in the stomach.</p><p>The boy kept quiet, not that he wasn’t in pain but he wasn’t allowed to let out a sound not even a squeak or a whimper. He shielded his sides, not wanting to have a rib broken again, like before.</p><p>“Go to your room now! No food for a week,” the man said, opening a newspaper.</p><p>The woman walked pass the boy that was still on the ground, her heels embedding itself into his sensitive skin as she went to cook the rest of the food.</p><p>The boy stood slowly and remembered to bow before leaving the kitchen. He was asked to always bow to them as thought they were gods. He was asked to bow to their friends as well, when they come to visit. He was half way at the door of the closet when he was shoved face first into the wall, slicing his right cheek at the gravel wall. He led out a groan.</p><p>“Mom! The slave pushed me!” the fat boy lied to his mother.</p><p>The woman along with the man came rushing to the scene, the boy on the ground while the fat one hovering beside him. Angry, the woman yelled “Why are you causing us so much trouble?! For 5 whole years now! We shouldn’t have taken you in. Should have just let you rot.”</p><p>The man spat on the boy’s face and went back to the kitchen. Another spit came from the woman. “Clean the mess you’ve made after we leave. Don’t show your disgusting self to any of us or you’ll be sleeping outside tonight.”</p><p>With that, the woman and boy went to the kitchen, leaving him still on the ground. The boy nodded slowly, accepting every single words that was thrown at him and went into his little room, closing the door quietly. He sat on the soaked bed that was made out of boxes filled with old worn out clothes. Slowly peeling off the hanging skin on his arm, a tear slid down his cheek. Then another. And another. Oh how he wished that he didn’t exist and be a burden to these people that took him in. Hours passed until he heard the front door closed loudly, signaling him that the family went out to work and for him to clean the house. Wishing tomorrow would a good day, less pain less drama. His wish didn’t come true. Until...</p><p> </p><p>~~~~</p><p> </p><p>2 years passed brutally. Him being a 7 year old boy now, the family didn’t care for the amount of beatings they gave him. Not that they cared before, however now they forced him to sleep in the backyard more often than before, knowing the boy won’t be weak or die easily. It’s stupid but that’s how their minds work.</p><p>The boy woke up from the sun shining brightly at his face. He turned his head away from the blinding light and stretched. He actually preferred the yard than the closet as he could stretched his legs till he was satisfied. Sitting up, he pushed the leaves aside and stood, dusting off any dirt. He looked behind him and saw the deep woods. Many times had he thought of running away but where will he go? No one wanted a weak boy that has scars all over his body. He wouldn’t survive in the outside world, that was what they always told him. He would die in an instant. He shook his head and went to the back door towards the kitchen, ready to prepare breakfast and a hell ton of beating.</p><p>The day went by as usual, the woman yelled non stop, the fat man took out his belt and smacked it across the boy’s face for not being fast enough at delivering a glass of water to him. And lastly, the spoiled fat boy lied and told them the weak boy broke the vase when it was obvious the fat one was near it while playing with his friends. Not wanting to scold and embarrass their only son, of course they would pick the weak frail boy. Another beating came and it was already night time. No breakfast or dinner as usual. The boy didn’t mind. Water was enough to fill his stomach. It wasn't.</p><p>It was almost 10 pm when the fat man suddenly pulled him into the kitchen. The boy knew what was coming. The man had been fidgety for the past few days and would take it out on the boy. The man brought brass knuckles today. That was new, the boy thought. But the pain wasn’t. With one punch, the boy fell to the floor, the inside of his mouth bleeding and his cheek felt hot. He casted his eyes downwards when another punch came, hitting his other side. His face burnt. So much pain. Why? He once thought but threw it away as he now understood it was his destiny to be their slave and punching bag. A kick unexpectedly knocked his chin upwards, throwing him backwards into to the wall, hitting his head which was now bleeding. Feeling dizzy, he collapsed on the floor, blood pouring out of his mouth. Another kick, now at his stomach, breaking a rib. Few minutes past, the boy was now unconscious as the man kept rampaging. He went to the sink and cleaned the blood off his brass. He then knelt in front of the boy and yanked the boy by his hair, shaking him until he was awake.</p><p>“Clean this up, you little shit. You will sleep outside for the whole month,” the man spat, venom in his voice as he dropped the boy’s head back onto the floor with a thud. He went upstairs to his room and lay on his cozy cotton bed with his wife snuggling into him.</p><p>The boy tried hard not to fall asleep on the floor, biting his tongue to keep him awake. However, the pain inflicted on his body overpowered the pain on his tongue. He then slowly sat up and rested against the wall, whimpering as his rib bone gyrated against each other. He led out a shaky breath and at the count of three stood up as fast as he could. He bit the inside of his mouth as pain came all at once. He took off his shirt and went to the sink to soak it. He learned not to use any of their kitchen cloth to wipe anything. Always used what he was wearing, they said. Throwing the wet shirt down, he used his leg to wipe the floor with it. Wiping every last of his blood he spotted. He crouched down and took his shirt, stumbling towards the back door. Once outside, the boy breathed in the sweet night air, feeling grateful that he survived. He squeezed out the excess blood and water from the shirt and hung it at the drying line. Finally at his resting spot, he sat down and covered himself with leaves, hoping his wounds would heal before tomorrow comes so he could do chores with ease. Tears slid down his eyes as he fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>A scream woke the boy. He jolted upwards at the terrifying sound, wincing at the pain from his rib. He looked around to find the source. A deafening scream broke out and he turned his head towards the house. He knew who it was from. The sound of thrashing and glass breaking filled the silent night. The injured boy stood up and headed towards the door, opening it with haste. He needed to get help, he needed to help them. His eyes widened at the sight of the kitchen. The table was upturned and plates were shattered into pieces on the floor. He went to the lounge, slicing his feet as he walked through the shards. It was the same, the sofa was shredded and the chandelier was hanging loosely. Something then caught his eyes from the side, he turned to look and was struck with a gory scene. The fat man was pale with wide eyes. Eyes looking to his direction. And he was so pale. Paler than the boy himself. It looked like there wasn’t an ounce of blood left. He was afraid to go upstairs, afraid of finding out the same fate of the others upstairs, afraid of being alone in this world. Within seconds, he was lifted into the air with a hand around his neck, choking him breathless. The boy looked down to see a man with blonde hair and eyes as blue as the sky, amusement in each of them.</p><p>“Who might you be?” The blonde man spoke.</p><p>The boy tried to speak but only air came out, not because the man was choking him but just that it had been long since he spoke. His throat was dry and groggy. He swallowed enough saliva to let words out smoothly. “S-slave,” he answered.</p><p>The blonde man frowned and finally looked at the small weak boy properly. He saw how much his face was bruised and noticed the dry blood at the corner of his mouth and the state of his cheeks. He also saw old and new scars all over his body. His frown deepened when his eyes cast on the dark discoloration on the boy's torso and at how freakishly thin he was. The moment he looked back up at the boy, he was already passed out. Shocked, the man slowly cradled the boy and set him on the sofa. He pushed the strands of hair away from his face and noticed a long scar from his forehead to the side of his face. Fury was in the man’s eyes at the sight of this fragile boy. “You don’t deserve this, sweet child,” the blonde man said, caressing the boy’s head. A man in a suit came from behind the blonde man and to his side, looking at the boy, frowning at the sight.</p><p>“Who is this child, Niklaus?” he asked.</p><p>Niklaus sighed. “He said he was a slave. I believed he was with the Dursleys, Elijah,” he shook his head.</p><p>Elijah was disgusted. “I'll search for information on this boy's background” he knelt beside the boy and brushed his fingers along the outline of his stomach. “He seemed to have a broken rib,” he looked around the boy’s body, his lips pursed. “We should have killed them slowly. Let them suffer for what they did to this poor child.”</p><p>Niklaus clenched his jaw. “Indeed, brother. For now, the boy's with us,” he stood and picked the boy up gently. He stopped moving when the boy whimpered but slowly snuggled into the man’s warm embrace. Niklaus smiled fondly and looked towards Elijah. Both nodded and sped away, leaving the massacre behind.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
