    <p>It was late one September evening, and The Dark Lord and his wife had just put their little Hermione to sleep for the night. The Manor was quiet, and there were only a few remaining Death Eaters visiting after the meeting earlier that night. Lucius and Narcissa were staying the night with their small son, Draco, and had also just finished putting them to bed. The men joined the others who were enjoying their firewhiskey and cigars in the sitting room off of the library, and the two sisters went to join the other women who were sitting in the parlor enjoying their tea and biscuits as they discussed children and husbands.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were loud pops outside and banging on the front door in the Entry Hall. "Tom, we have the manor surrounded. Surrender, and everyone will remain unharmed," the loud voice of Albus Dumbledore rang through the manor. The women folk started screaming, and quickly ran down the hall towards the sitting room. Husbands and wives quickly flood to their homes via the fireplace. "Cissy, you and Lucius go tend to the children. Make sure they stay safe", Bellatrix told her younger sister, "Tom and I will go find out what this is about". Narcissa and Lucius moved quickly up the stairs and into the nursery where the children were sleeping in Hermione’s small bed. They warded the door and the windows before drawing the curtains.</p>
<p>Bellatrix sealed the floo with a flick of her wand and went to join her husband by the front door. "What should we do, my Lord?" She asked her husband quietly. Tom looked at his wife, "We find out what the bloody hell he wants," he says as he draws his wand. The front door swung open and there stood Dumbledore with several Order members. "What do you want, old man?" Tom demanded, wand in hand. Dumbledore frowned, "Tom, it's time to give yourself up." Bellatrix snorted at what he said, "Give himself up? I knew you were crazy, Dumbledore, but I didn't think you were stupid."</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked over his shoulder and nodded, and in rushed all of the Order members. James Potter and Frank Longbottom rushed forward and started to duel with Bellatrix; while Minerva McGonagall and Kingsley Shacklebolt led other Order members up the stairs to search the manor. Tom sent a Patronus to Lucius to meet them in the Entry Hall before beginning to duel with Dumbledore. "I'll never surrender, old man!" Tom yelled at Dumbledore before throwing hexes at him. Bellatrix was fighting back and forth with Longbottom and Potter, hexes flying. Potter fired a jinx at an unprepared Bellatrix, sending her up in the air and hung her by her feet before stunning, binding, and disapparating with her.</p>
<p>Tom was joined by Lucius in the duel with Dumbledore and together they stunned him. They chased after McGonagall and the others to find Narcissa and Draco bound in the corner of Hermione’s nursery, but Hermione and the Order members were nowhere to be seen. Lucius flicked his wand to unbind his wife and child. "What happened, Cissa?" he asked his wife urgently. Narcissa handed Draco to his father before standing on shaky legs, "They stunned me and then bound us up. When I regained consciousness, Hermione was gone." She looked at her brother-in-law with a sad look. "No!" Tom cried in anguish, sinking to his knees. His wife and his daughter were gone. Lucius looked at his Lord and friend, "Tom, why don't you stay with us for a while? The Manor has been compromised. You're not safe here any longer." They had no idea what was going to happen next.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Dumbledore regained consciousness and apparated back to the front gates at Hogwarts. Upon arrival, he was greeted at the Entry Hall by Minerva carrying a small child with black curly hair and grey eyes. "This is the Riddle heir, Albus. She must be put somewhere safe." She told him. He nodded at her, before waving his hand over the small girl's body. Before their eyes, her features changed; making her unrecognizable. "I know just who to put her with." He took the baby in his arms, and apparated to London where he left her with a squib and her husband. "Jean," he told her, "this is Hermione. Raise her as your own. Her birthday is September 19th. Keep her safe." Without another word to either of them, Dumbledore disapparated, as his night was far from over.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Two weeks passed by, and Bellatrix arrived at the front gates of Malfoy Manor in the early hours of the morning. She had been badly beaten, her dress torn, and her once beautiful hair now matted and tangled. She used the last of her strength to call for her most treasured House Elf, Tippy. "Mistress! Oh, what has happened? I will be getting the Master right away!" Tippy squeaked out, in obvious distress over her Mistress' state. Bellatrix groaned, "Tippy, take me to my sister's sitting room. Then you can get Tom." Tippy nodded before grabbing her Mistress' hand and apparating them to the sitting room. "I will be getting the Master now!" She disappeared with a loud pop. Bellatrix closed her eyes; she'd just rest them until Tom came to her.</p>
<p>"Bella, wake up." Tom called to her, gently picking her up off of the floor. She groaned before slowly opening her eyes. "Oh, Tom…" She whispered as she touched his face. "You're hurt, Bella. What happened to you?" She shook her head as tears came to her eyes. "They raped me and tortured me over and over again." His eyes flashed red with anger, "What! Who has done this?" She looked away from him, and closed her eyes. "I asked you who did this, wife, please tell me." His voice softened as he looked down at his broke witch. "James Potter and Frank Longbottom." She said in an almost whisper.</p>
<p>"They will pay, my dear. They will regret the day they laid a hand on my Dark Lady." Tom stated in a menacing voice.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The days passed, and Bellatrix' body healed itself with the aid of potions and spells. Her mind was healing much slower. She had been devastated when Tom had told her that Hermione was gone. He stayed in Lucius' study, and only came out to visit with her during meals. Tom would not rest until his wife was avenged and his precious little girl was back in his arms.</p>
<p>Narcissa demanded that Bellatrix stay in bed until she was fully healed. "Cissy, they have my Mia! I cannot rest until we have our baby girl back. I have to help our Lord find her." Her voice cracked as she fought back the tears. The Order had broken her. They had beaten her. Raped her. Stole her daughter from her. She told herself that there was nothing worse than this. She had no idea that things were going to get much, much worse before they got better.</p>
<p>At dinner the next evening, Tom sat with her. "I have a plan," he said, "We will make them pay for what they did to you, my Lady." Bellatrix looked up from her dinner to look into her husband's eyes. She saw only anger and pain. She gave him a small smile, "What is this plan of yours, husband? Tell me."</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the evening plotting their revenge. Nobody messes with the Dark Lord or his family and gets away with it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The next night, Bellatrix gathered with the Dark Lord and Barty Crouch Jr. to prepare for the night ahead. This night would be the night she got her revenge. They had ruined her, took almost everything from her, and she would see to it that Longbottom and Potter would never see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Later that evening, after kissing her husband goodnight, she and Barty headed for the Longbottoms' home. She knocked on the door and waited for someone to come. The wife, Alice, answered the door. "Frank, come quickly – I… Ah!" She never finished her sentenced because Bellatrix had pulled her wand out and jammed it into the woman's throat. "You will take us inside, and we're going to have a little discussion. Let's go now, before we draw attention to ourselves." Alice nodded, "This way." As soon as they made it into the Longbottoms' living room, Bellatrix bound her with a flick of her wand. "Call for him, bitch. Call for your rapist husband." She hissed as she poked Alice with her wand. "FRANK!" she wailed.</p>
<p>Within moments, Frank Longbottom appeared in the doorway, wand in hand. Bellatrix was prepared this time, and silently bound him before levitating him over to his wife. "Have you told your wife about how you and your stupid friend Potter held me in your basement for two weeks as you beat and raped me, hm? No? Pity." She hissed as she spat in his face. "Crucio!" She screamed as she hit Frank with the first curse. "You will beg for death, you piece of shit." Barty started firing Cruciatus curse after Cruciatus at Alice. After over an hour of torturing them, Bellatrix decided it was time for her to end them both.</p>
<p>Just as Bellatrix raised her wand to fire the Killing Curse, there were a series of pops outside. She looked over at Barty in a panic, "Go, I will take care of this. Go!" He tried to disapparate but couldn't. Bellatrix screamed in raged, before shooting hexes at the aurors who were coming in the door. One snuck up behind her and bound her, not giving her a moment to react. "Bellatrix Black-Riddle, you are under arrest for the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom with the use of the Cruciatus Curse. You will be taken into custody and if found guilty at trial, you will spend life in Azkaban." Auror and Order member Kingsley Shacklebolt told her. She spat in his face and laughed when he flinched. "Where is my daughter, you bastard? Where did you take her?" She demanded. "She's somewhere safe, where you'd never think to find her. You'll never see her again." He told her. She had been wrong last night; her life could get worse. Now she'd not only lost her daughter, but her husband and entire family as well.</p>
<p>Tom became worried when his wife hadn't returned that evening. He couldn't go find her for fear of being caught, so he waited with his wife's family for her return. While it was not something he showed in front of the general public, he loved his family very much. His wife and daughter were his whole world. When the Prophet was delivered by owl the next morning, he set it on fire after he read the headline "<strong><b>Dark Lady Captured and Sentenced to Life in Azkaban</b></strong>". His whole life changed. He was sure he'd never see his wife again, and Dumbledore had taken his only daughter, his precious Hermione.</p>
<p>That night, he went to the Potters' in Godric's Hollow to finish the job that his wife was unable to do. He tortured that good for nothing Potter before killing him and his wife. When he sent the Killing Curse at Lily Potter, it went through her and also hit the Potter boy, leaving a scar on his forehead. Tom left the Potter house and went back to Malfoy Manor, leaving a note for his wife's family.</p>
<p>"<em><em>Lucius, I'm going into seclusion for a while. I have to find a way to get my daughter back. I will call for Tippy when I get to where I'm going. Thank you, my friend. They will pay for this, Lucius. I will not stop until I find her."</em></em></p>

</p>
<p>Tom disappeared that night, leaving the Wizarding World to believe that he had been defeated by the Potter child. He vowed that he would not give up until he had his life back. Dumbledore would pay for this. Nobody took what belonged to the Dark Lord.</p>
