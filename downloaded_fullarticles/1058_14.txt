    <p>It had been years since Number Twelve Grimmauld Place had seemed so alive. Amaris and Remus had decided at the end of term that it would be best for them if they stuck close to Sirius and the rest of the Order in case anything were to happen again. It also helped with the number of enchantments that were to be placed around the home. The spells offered Amaris the closest thing she had felt to safety in a while. Amaris was sitting in the kitchen beside her twin and Remus as Molly tried to do her best to get a handle on her twins’ rowdy behavior. They were currently disapparating everywhere they could within the house now that they were legally allowed to do so. Amaris watched the scene with a small smile. “Is that what we were like when we were younger?” she asked, sparing a single glance at Sirius. </p>
<p>Remus was the one to answer as he fixed the now grinning pair with a pointed look. “Not at all,” he said, and the twins gave him a curious look. “You two were much worse than that. Using any chance you got to battle one another in the yard.” Neither of the Blacks were able to deny the statement. As they broke out laughing, a female voice called out into the house. Amaris’ brow furrowed in confusion as she stood, making her way out of the kitchen. Amaris thought she recognized the cheerful tone, but she had to be mistaken. As she rounded the corner, Amaris was met by the sight of brilliant, pink hair. </p>
<p>With her hands on her hips, Amaris greeted her cousin. “Nymphadora Tonks, just what are you doing here?” </p>
<p>Tonks moved forward, pulling her cousin into a hug. “I told you not to call me Nymphadora, Amaris.” </p>
<p>Amaris returned the embrace, happy to see her cousin again. “You know how I love teasing you.” Amaris pulled away, eyes scanning over Tonks’ features. “How have you been? I haven’t heard from you since you graduated. It wouldn’t kill you to write a letter every now and then, or stop by and see your old professor.”</p>
<p>Tonks’ face contorted with mock disgust at the suggestion. “You don’t even know how weird it is being taught by your own cousin.” Amaris laughed, releasing her hold on the younger girl. “I’ve been good though. Managed to finally become an Auror, just like you were.” When Amaris had heard of Tonks’ dreams of becoming an Auror, she’d done everything she could to help Tonks reach her goal. Amaris grinned, congratulating her cousin on her achievement. “You wouldn’t believe how surprised I was when I got an invitation to join the Order. Especially when I heard you and your brother were a part of it.” Tonks paused for a moment. “How is Sirius by the way?”</p>
<p>Smiling, Amaris motioned toward the kitchen. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Tonks looked between her cousin and the ajar door to the kitchen. In a flash, she darted past Amaris in into the room, skidding to a halt just inside the door.</p>
<p>At the table, Sirius and Remus both glanced up at the eccentric young woman as she called out, “Sirius!” </p>
<p>Recognition dawned on Sirius, and he asked, “Tonks?” Sirius stood from the table as Amaris made her way into the room. He moved to stand before his cousin. “Merlin’s beard, you’ve grown.” </p>
<p>Tonks folded her arms across her chest defiantly. “What did you expect? The same little eight year old?” Sirius shrugged at her, and Tonks gave him a light shove to his shoulder. “You could’ve stopped by to see everyone when you got back, Sirius.” Tonks’ eyes fell on Amaris. “You too. Mom’s been wanting to see both of you again.” </p>
<p>Amaris let out a chuckle as she passed by Sirius, throwing a simple, “At least one member of the family still likes us,” over her shoulder at him. Lazily, Amaris fell back into her seat beside Remus. </p>
<p>This seemed to catch Tonks’ eye, and she realized she hadn’t yet introduced herself to the werewolf. She took a step toward him, saying, “I’m sorry, how rude of me. I’m Tonks.”</p>
<p>Remus offered her a smile, but before he could say anything, Sirius was pushing his way past the woman to return to his seat. “But you can call her Nymphadora,” he said with a smirk. </p>
<p>Tonks’ cheeks reddened in annoyance and embarrassment. “Please don’t,” she muttered. </p>
<p>As Tonks glared at her cousins that were grinning brightly at her, Remus let out a chuckle. Tonks seemed to perk up at the sound, and she blinked curiously at Remus. “Remus Lupin,” he told her. “Pleasure to meet you.” From where Amaris sat, she watched the way Tonks was eyeing her husband. </p>
<p>A loud crash upstairs caught everyone’s attention, and the bloodcurdling screeches of Walburga began echoing through the house. With a sigh, Sirius rose from his seat. “Probably the twins again.” He glanced over his shoulder at Amaris who was staring intently at the oblivious Tonks once again. “‘Maris, a little help?” Amaris glanced between her brother and Tonks before sighing and shoving her chair away from the table with a screech. </p>
<p>“Right,” she muttered, stalking out of the room after her brother. She sent one last look over her shoulder at the woman who was making her way closer to Remus, and jealousy coiled in her stomach. The pair trudged up the stairs as Walburga continued screaming about mudbloods and traitors in her house. “Never a single moment of peace here, I swear.” As Walburga came into view, Amaris’ face twisted in disgust. “Would you shut up you old hag?” Amaris yelled.</p>
<p>Walburga writhed within the confines of her portrait. “Filthy blood-traitors! The shame of my family!” As the twins neared her, the woman began screeching even louder. “Get out of my house!” Shaking their heads, each twin grabbed a fistful of the red curtains on either side of the portrait. </p>
<p>They fought to try and close them, but the curtains wouldn’t budge. As Sirius fought with his side of the cloth, he said, “Not your house anymore seeing as how you’re, I don’t know, dead.” Walburga’s words turned into a mess of indecipherable wailing. Finally, with an immense amount of force, the twins managed to shut the curtains, silencing Walburga’s cries. “I truly wish we could find a way to remove her from the wall,” Sirius commented as they began making their way back downstairs. </p>
<p>Amaris hummed in thought. “We could always just remove the entire wall behind her,” she offered. Sirius pondered this for a moment, honestly considering it. The pair made their way into the kitchen, and Amaris was the first through the door. She stopped dead in her tracks, causing Sirius to run into her back. He placed a hand on her shoulder to steady himself. In front of them, at the table, Tonks was leaning close to Remus, her hand hovering near the scars that donned his face. Amaris was frozen as she watched Tonks gingerly touching the faded lines. Behind her, Sirius was in a similar state of disbelief. Amaris’ face twisted in pain, and she spat, “Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt.” She spun on her heel and shoved her way past her brother, tuning out Remus’ cries of her name as she disappeared from view. </p>
<p>Moving out of the way of the door, Sirius gave the pair a pointed look. “Well, isn’t this just awkward,” he commented, giving Remus a small glare. “You might want to go say something to her, Remus. Don’t want her getting the wrong idea about you two.”  In a flash, Remus was out the door, chasing after the woman that was long gone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days had passed, and Amaris was standing beside Remus, pointedly ignoring him. She was still seething over the scene she’d walked in on when Tonks had arrived at the house. After the incident, Tonks had quickly taken her leave, feeling out of place after she’d been caught trying to flirt with the man. Remus had caught up with Amaris shortly afterward, but she was too angry to listen to anything he had to say. Having enough of Amaris’ games, Remus grabbed Amaris’ hand and pulled her from the kitchen that was full of members of the Order. Sirius cocked an eyebrow as he watched the pair disappear from the room. Amaris fought to free herself from the werewolf’s grasp, but it was no use. As soon as they were in the foyer, Remus backed Amaris against the wall, his arms pinning her in. Remus leaned forward, keeping his voice low as he said, “Would you quit giving me the cold shoulder, Amaris? It’s been days, and I don’t even know what I did wrong.”</p>
<p>Amaris scoffed at him, rolling her eyes. “It’s not what you did, but what you didn’t do, Remus,” she spat. Her heart twisted as she thought of Remus allowing Tonks so close to him. </p>
<p>Confusion flitted across Remus’ features. “I’m sorry, what?”</p>
<p>Amaris’ face pinched with utter disgust. “She was flirting with you,” Amaris said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Remus’ green eyes widened in surprise. “You didn’t do a thing to stop it either.”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head, hurt that Amaris thought he would stray like that. “She wasn’t flirting with me. Tonks asked about my scars. That’s all.” </p>
<p>“That doesn’t justify caressing your face all while making doe eyes at you.” Amaris’ eyes narrowed in anger. “Last I recalled, someone can ask a question without doing so. And anyway, you were never the best at catching on when someone was flirting with you. I would know from experience.” </p>
<p>A small sigh escaped Remus. He loved Amaris dearly, but sometimes, she could be the most stubborn woman he’d ever met. “It wasn’t like that, Amaris.” Remus could see it plainly on her face, Amaris didn’t believe him. “You know I wouldn’t hurt you like that.” </p>
<p>The front door could be heard opening and closing. Amaris used Remus’ moment of distraction to break free from him. She dipped beneath his arm as she said, “If you caught on, you wouldn’t.” Behind them, two wizards passed by on their way to the kitchen. “Look. Diggle and Doge are here now.” Amaris spun on her heel, leaving Remus standing behind her, feeling defeated. “We’ll finish this later because the meeting is about to start.” Amaris disappeared around the corner, and Remus stood in the foyer for a moment, raking a single hand through his hair in desperation. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Remus moved to follow Amaris to the kitchen. </p>
<p>When he walked in, Amaris was hovering on the outskirts of the room. He quietly joined her. Amaris didn’t miss the way Tonks glanced over at them. The woman cocked a single dark brow, and her hand shot out to grasp Remus’ in hers. Shocked by the contact, Remus glanced down at the frail hand in his before looking up to Amaris who was refusing to meet his stare. Tonk’s cheeks reddened, and she focused on Mad-Eye who had officially begun the meeting. “As you all know by now, Potter was attacked by Dementors a few days ago.” Everyone in the room shifted uncomfortably at the mention of Dementors. “As I’ve been informed, there is to be a hearing at the Ministry to decide his fate. Now, it’s our job to get Harry safely from his home to here.” </p>
<p>Amaris’ brows knit together in confusion. “But, Moody, the protective charm. Wouldn’t he be in more danger removing him from the Dursleys?” That was what Dumbledore continually told the twins when they asked to remove Harry from that wretched house. </p>
<p>Moody shook his head at her. “Only doing as I’m told.”</p>
<p>His statement left no room for argument. “Right. So how do we go about this, then?” The room fell into discussion over the plan to remove Harry from Number Four Privet Drive in a few days' time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eleven witches and wizards were scattered in various places along Privet Drive, waiting for the signal from Mad-Eye. He was stationed across the street from the Dursley home with Sirius, Amaris, Remus, and Tonks lurking behind him in the darkness. Amaris was still trying to make her relationship to Remus clear, as she hadn’t gotten a chance to tell Tonks flat out that they were married since her cousin had begun avoiding her after the meeting. She leaned against Remus in the darkness, and the man wound an arm around her. Across the street, they could see the Dursley family milling about the house through the windows. They watched as Vernon moved in and out of view a few times before the front door opened. Light spilled across the front yard, and the robust man exited the home, followed by his wife and son. </p>
<p>They stuffed themselves into the small car that sat in the driveway. The sound of an engine revving to life was the only sound that could be heard in the stillness of the night. As the gleaming taillights disappeared from view, Moody finally said, “Right. Shouldn’t be back for a while. Let’s go.” The small group made their way across the street toward the house, and the rest of the guard stood watch over them. Moody unlocked the door, and Amaris and Sirius took the lead. Releasing Remus’ hand, Amaris opened the door and stepped into the now darkened house. </p>
<p>They moved stealthily through the house, checking it for any signs of life. That was until Sirius stepped on his sister, and she was sent stumbling into the wall beside her with a loud thump. “Ouch, Sirius, that was my foot,” she hissed at him. </p>
<p>“Sorry Vix,” Sirius said, helping his sister regain her footing. “Can’t see anything.” </p>
<p>From behind them, they heard Mad-Eye start grumbling in the darkness. “You two can’t do anything silently, can you? Potter knows we’re here now.” He made his way through the darkness, and the twins trailed along behind him. Remus and Tonks waited at the bottom of the stairs, and the sound of the front door opening could be heard as the rest of the guard began filing in. When they reached the top of the stairs, Moody unlocked Harry’s bedroom door and threw it open. In the darkness, Amaris could see a faint outline of Harry pointing his wand at them. “Put that thing down, boy. You’ll take out someone’s eye.” </p>
<p>Harry refused to do as Moody said, having never seen the man before in his life. “Who are you?” he demanded. </p>
<p>Amaris popped out from around Mad-Eye, and Harry’s hand wavered. “Harry, it’s alright,” she said calmly. “Just do as he says.” </p>
<p>The teen finally lowered his wand, letting it hang limply in his hand at his side. “Amaris? What’s going on?” </p>
<p>Amaris gave Harry a bright smile that he couldn’t see. “You’ll see, just come on. Everyone’s waiting on you.” </p>
<p>Harry tried to see past Moody, but it was no use. “Is Sirius here?” he asked hopefully. “What about Professor Lupin?” </p>
<p>“Of course I’m here,” Sirius’ voice came from behind Mad-Eye. Harry perked up at the sound. “You’re coming with us.” Harry couldn’t believe it. They’d finally come to take him home with them?</p>
<p>From the bottom of the stairs, Tonks voice called out in the darkness. “Since he knows we’re here, why are we still standing in the dark?” The glow of her wand illuminated the cramped space, and Harry saw the number of witches and wizards that were gathered at the foot of the steps.</p>
<p>There were a few muffled gasps as the members of the Order got a good look at Harry. “I see what you all talk about now,” Kingsley muttered, his eyes wide with wonder. “He looks just like James.”</p>
<p>“Except for his eyes. Lily’s,” Doge commented.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye shook his head. “Yes, yes,” he grumbled, annoyed over the fact they weren’t focused more on the matter at hand. “Just like his parents. Is it really him though? Anyone bring any Veritaserum? It’d be just our luck to bring back a Death Eater disguised as him.”</p>
<p>Everyone shook their heads, not even thinking to bring something of the likes. Instead, they settled for the next best thing. Remus took a small step forward, peering up at the teen who still stood at the top of the stairs. “Harry, what form is your Patronus?”</p>
<p>Harry looked confused for a moment before answering, “A stag.”</p>
<p>Amaris smiled, moving forward to throw her arm over Harry’s shoulder. “It’s him,” she told Moody, and he seemed to accept this. Mad-Eye nodded and motioned for the three to follow him back down the stairs to wait until they were cleared to leave.</p>
<p>As they all filed into the kitchen, Harry muttered, “You’re all lucky the Dursleys are gone.”</p>
<p>“Lucky?” Tonks said with a laugh. Amaris shook her head lightly. Even if the Dursleys had been home, that wouldn’t have stopped her from taking Harry away from them. “I’m the one who got them out of our way.” Tonks went on to explain how she’d planted a fake letter to keep them out of the house until they were able to leave.</p>
<p>Harry glanced between his godparents and Remus, happy to finally be out of the dark about what was going on. “Are we leaving soon?” he asked hopefully.</p>
<p>He was met with a warm smile from Amaris. “We’re just waiting for the all-clear.”</p>
<p>Harry gave her a nod. “Right. So, are we going to the Burrow?” They could see the light in his eyes as he thought of being able to see his friends once again.</p>
<p>“Much too dangerous,” Remus said, and Harry looked crestfallen.</p>
<p>“Then, where are you taking me?”</p>
<p>Sirius grinned, throwing an arm over the teen’s shoulder. Harry looked up at him curiously, wondering what was going on. “Home,” Sirius said happily.</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened at the revelation. “Your home?” he asked, excited to get to see where Sirius lived, and where he dreamed he could be staying.</p>
<p>“Our home,” Amaris corrected him. When Harry seemed confused by the statement, Amaris added, “You get to see where Sirius and I grew up.”</p>
<p>Harry had heard bits and pieces of their childhood, but the twins liked to keep that part of their past quiet from him. There was no need for Harry to hear their woes that were so long ago. He was eager to finally see that part of his godparents. As he gave a quick cursory glance around the room, he noticed everyone staring at them, watching their interaction. “Who is everyone?” he whispered to Sirius, not wanting to seem rude.</p>
<p>Sirius’ ever-present grin merely widened. He pointed over to Moody who was sitting at the kitchen table, his magical eye swiveling about the room. “That’s Alastor Moody,” he informed the teen. “One of the best Aurors you’ll ever meet, but don’t tell Amaris I said that.” Amaris rolled her eyes, stepping away from the pair to stand by Remus’ side. “And that’s Nymphadora-“</p>
<p>“Don’t call me that!” Tonks interrupted him. “I’m Tonks,” she told Harry.</p>
<p>The three surrounding Harry went on to introduce the rest of the witches and wizards crammed into the small room. Everyone nodded in greeting as Harry’s eyes landed on them. “And they all volunteered to come get you,” Remus said. Harry couldn’t believe it. So many people wanted to get him away from the Dursleys.</p>
<p>Amaris chuckled lightly at the surprised look on his face. “The more the better, I say,” she grumbled. “We’re your guard, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Guard?” he asked, unsure of why he’d need a guard to leave.</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head at him. “No time for questions Harry. You’d best go get your things packed as we should be leaving shortly.” Sirius relinquished his hold on the teen and pushed him in the direction of his room. Tonks happily followed him out of the room, offering to help him pack.</p>
<p>When the pair were out of sight, Amaris sighed. “I do hope Harry doesn’t have to come back here ever again.” From the brief time she’d spent in the company of his aunt and uncle, Amaris dreaded every summer.</p>
<p>“He could come live with me,” Sirius suggested. Amaris cocked a single brow at him. As if she’d let Harry live with Sirius by himself. If anything, Harry would wind up with her and Remus. Maybe she’d even allow Sirius to live with them again. “I could find somewhere better than that dusty old house when this is all over.”</p>
<p>A small chuckle escaped Remus. “It wouldn’t be so dusty and gross if you actually cleaned every now and then.” Even with Molly’s efforts, she’d barely managed to make a dent in the mess Sirius had been living in that entire time.</p>
<p>“I do clean,” Sirius stated indignantly. “But, there are more important things to worry about right now.” Amaris and Remus shared a knowing look before they both began laughing. The pair continued poking fun at Sirius’ untidiness, and they were soon interrupted by a large trunk floating into the kitchen. It was followed closely behind by Tonks and Harry.</p>
<p>The pair filed into the kitchen, and everyone began getting ready to leave. “Just in time, Harry,” Remus stated. “We’ve only got about a minute left.”</p>
<p>Everyone was herded through the back door, and Amaris grabbed Remus’ hand as they stepped through the door. Before Harry was allowed outside, Mad-Eye insisted on using a disillusionment charm on him. The almost invisible teen was ushered into the back yard before Moody, and the man glanced up at the sky. “Clear night. That’s no good.” He glanced down at Harry who was still standing beside him. “You; we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks will be in front of you, so stick close to her. I’ll be behind, Lupin below, and everyone else will be circling us.” Amaris gave Remus’ hand a light squeeze before she let him go to grab her broom from its hiding spot. “Should any of us die, the rest keep flying. Do not break ranks. If they manage to take all of us out and you survive, Harry, the rear guard will take over.”</p>
<p>Amaris shook her head. “Do you really need to scare him like that, Moody?” Amaris scolded the Auror. She peered at Harry who blended in almost perfectly with the night. “Don’t worry, Harry. None of us are going to die tonight. Mad-Eye just likes to be overly prepared for any possible outcome.”</p>
<p>In the distance, a flash of red sparks lit the night sky. “That’s the first signal,” Remus said. “Everyone mount your brooms.” Amaris moved to take her spot beside Sirius, perching carefully on her broom.</p>
<p>She threw a quick glance over to Remus who was doing the same beside Harry. “Be safe,” she called. “Both of you.”</p>
<p>“You too.”</p>
<p>From beside her, Amaris heard Sirius call, “Second signal. Let’s go.” Amaris didn’t get a chance to see the green sparks before she was off the ground. Amaris fell into her place behind her brother, and they gave the four at the center of their formation a wide berth to begin with. The cool night air whipped her hair back from her face, and Amaris wished she’d taken more of an interest in flying when she was younger. She reveled in the free feeling it gave her. As Sirius swooped left, Amaris glanced over to see Moody veering in their direction. She adjusted her course, and soon they were climbing higher into the sky. The cold air began to seep into her bones as they continued ever higher. Not even her coat could ease the chill anymore.</p>
<p>The twins continued their never-ending circling of the main group. Every now and then, they’d pass through a cloud, and Amaris thought for sure she was going to freeze to death soon. Her clothing was completely soaked through, and her teeth began to chatter. As she swooped over the group, Amaris overheard Mad-Eye saying something about doubling back to make sure they weren’t followed. Amaris’ hands tightened on her broom at the thought of staying up above the city any longer than necessary. She knew they were almost back to Grimmauld Place, and Amaris longed for the warm fire she knew would be burning in the kitchen as Molly cooked. To her relief, everyone began descending, and Amaris gladly pulled her broom into a steep dive. Her stomach lurched as she careened toward the ground. With chilled hands, she gripped the wood of the broom as tightly as she could. It wasn’t until she saw their home that Amaris began pulling out of her dive.</p>
<p>Amaris landed after Harry was already standing before the house he couldn’t see. “Where are we?” he asked.</p>
<p>Teeth still chattering, Amaris passed him by, lugging her broom with her. “You’ll see,” she whispered. Not wanting to spend another moment outside, Amaris allowed Moody to take over the task of getting Harry inside. Amaris dipped inside the house, letting the warm air wash over her. Remus and Sirius were right behind her. They stood by the front door, waiting for Tonks, Moody, and Harry to enter. Remus wrapped an arm around Amaris, pulling her frozen body against him in an effort to try to help her regain some warmth. She smiled up at him, leaning against him lovingly. As Harry stepped through the door finally, Molly appeared behind them. “He arrived while you all were out. Everyone’s in the kitchen. The meeting has already started,” she informed the members of the Order.</p>
<p>Amaris sighed, not wanting to deal with their guest. She gave Harry an apologetic look before saying, “We’ll come find you in a bit, Harry.” Together, everyone except Molly and Harry disappeared into the kitchen to hear Snape’s most recent report.</p>
