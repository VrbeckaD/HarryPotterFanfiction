    <p>The brilliant crimson engine of the Hogwarts Express was the most amazing thing Remus Lupin had ever seen. He stared in front of him, his fingers twisted desperately into his sweater. Beside him, his father cleared his throat, smiling as warmly as he could, despite the worry that Remus could see behind the glasses perched on his strong nose.</p><p>“Alright Remus, dear.” Adeline Lupin said warmly, she bent a bit while balancing little Claire Lupin on her hip. Claire dug her chubby fingers into her mother’s blouse and giggled. “Isn’t that a sight, are you ready?” Her kind smile was reassuring. </p><p>“Mum…I just want to stay with you.” Remus fixed his wide golden eyes on the eternal comfort of his mother. He had never been away from her. Had never been separated from the safety and understanding she created for him.</p><p>“Son, this is going to be an amazing adventure. Hogwarts is the most amazing place you’ll ever go.” John Lupin patted Remus’ arm gently. “You’re going to be just fine.”<br/>
Remus took a shaking breath. Children of all ages were starting to climb into the doors of the coaches that were attached engine. Steam billowed magnificently from the Hogwarts Express and Mrs. Lupin stood, taking Remus’ hand. “It’s time! Let’s get you loaded up. John, have you got his luggage?” </p><p>Mr. Lupin pushed the trolley as they worked through the sea of parents and siblings waving kids off through the windows. Mrs. Lupin handed Remus his satchel. Remus caught it and looked at her with a mix of terror and anguish. “Mum-“</p><p>“Now Remus, things are going to be just fine. Professor Dumbledore has made sure you’ll be alright. This is the first step to a brighter future for you.” She ducked down to kiss his cheek. “On you get. I won’t have any protesting now.”</p><p>“Be brave, Remus.” John said, reappearing after handing the luggage off to be loaded. He also ducked in, kissing his hair. “I know you will be.”<br/>
Remus looked between his parents, and then to his three-year old sister, her wide, blue eyes trusting and innocent. He pressed a kiss to her cheek and then gave his parents the most confident look he could muster.</p><p>The steam engine wailed a triumphant cry across the platform and Remus’ mother shooed him up the steps to the coach. “Be good dear! Write when you are settled!” She called to him.<br/>
“I love you!” Remus waved, but the he was forced up into the corridor as kids scurried onboard before the doors were closed. </p><p> </p><p>The corridor was a bustle of pushing bodies as people tried to find the compartments of their friends, or an empty spot to take over. Remus felt dwarfed by the other students who shoved him aside. He ducked by a group of loud, rowdy boys and past a handful of girls who smelled strongly of something sweet and floral. </p><p>At the very end of the car Remus reached out and gave a compartment door a tug. To his amazement the space was only occupied by one boy. He was very plump, his rosy cheeks nearly downing his small, pale blue eyes. His blond hair hung limply against his forehead. </p><p>“Er—” Remus choked, pausing. “Mind if I?” He nodded to the empty seat across from the boy.</p><p>“Not at all!” The boy said, his voice was high, and his fingers twitched nervously in his lap. Remus slipped in and tugged the sliding door shut as the train jerked into motion. He dropped his bag on the seat and lurched for the window, fumbling for the clasps to lower the pane. He peered out, searching the sea of waving hands. He swallowed a silent sob of panic as the platform shrank away and a black tunnel surrounded the train. </p><p>He stumbled back, sitting down hard his eyes fixed on his shaking fingers. He was alone. He was impossibly alone for the first time in his life, surrounded by strangers. The terror of not knowing, of things going wrong, of his very fragile existence in this very fragile world made his head spin. </p><p>“Are you a first year too?”</p><p>The question took Remus off guard. He glanced up to see the strange blond boy staring at him. He swallowed, nodding.</p><p>“Yes, are you?” Remus asked, his voice cracking. He cleared it and tried to relax his shoulders wound tight as piano wire under his sweater.</p><p>“Yeah. My name’s Peter Pettigrew.” Peter gave Remus a weak little smile. </p><p>“Remus Lupin.” Remus offered. </p><p>An awkward silence stretched out before them and he wished deeply for the solace of the book he had stuck in his bag. Was it rude to read in front of another boy? Would he think it weird? What did normal boys usually talk about?</p><p>“Was it a surprise when you got your letter?” Peter asked, his eyes fixed on Remus as if he were some strange oddity. </p><p>“Err-no. Not really. My father’s a wizard. He’s a doctor and botanist. My mum’s not though. Not magic born. They met through a research project.” Remus sputtered. </p><p>Peter shrugged. “My parents are both old magic families.” He leaned back. The train erupted suddenly from the tunnel, sunshine streaming into the compartment as a view of rolling green hills spilled out to the horizon. </p><p>Remus’ breath caught in his throat. His gaze was stuck on the vibrant green and the sharp contrast of blue. It was so different than his home, a small house in a grey, rainy village on the outskirts of Wales. </p><p>“What? Is something out there?” Peter asked, craning to see what it was that Remus was staring at.</p><p>“Oh—no. Sorry.” Remus mumbled, tearing his gaze from the explosion of color. Another awkward silence started to stretch. Remus fumbled with a polite question to continue the conversation. “Do you like reading?”</p><p>“Hah-no.” Peter snorted. “What good is there in it when you could be out doing something else.” </p><p>Remus found his face heating and he shoved his bag farther back on the seat, hoping the books inside weren’t obvious. </p><p>At that moment the door to the compartment swung open with such violent force that Remus nearly jumped out of his skin. A boy stood on the compartment threshold, his grey eyes cold and hard. He had inky black hair that was perfectly cut and parted, his clothing carefully selected and obviously expensive. The shimmer of the embroidered green, silk vest made Remus’ eyes widen. </p><p>The boy strode in with purpose, flinging the door shut behind him. He dropped onto the seat beside Remus, who was openly staring. </p><p>“Hi.” Peter said simply, though his tiny blue eyes were open about as wide as the were able with the limitations of his pudgy cheeks.</p><p>The boy sneered at Peter, his eyes still cold and cool. He arched an eyebrow at them.</p><p>“I’m Peter.” Peter gave a little wave. “That’s Remus.”</p><p>Remus resisted the urge to flinch as the boy snapped a fierce look at him. His obvious disapproval at Remus wasn’t hard to see. A cruel smile flickered across his face. Remus scowled sharply. </p><p>“I’m Sirius.” The boy said cooly, looking at his fingernails, “Sirius Black.”</p><p>Peter choked on his tongue, his eyes nearly bugging out of his head. “No way!”</p><p>Remus arched an eyebrow. He wasn’t sure what was so sodding special about being a Sirius Black, but apparently it was enough to render Peter utterly starstruck. </p><p>“Like the Black family? Like The Black Family?” Peter went on excitedly. </p><p>Sirius, who was obviously pleased at the reaction from Peter, nodded importantly. “Yes, that would be it.”</p><p>Remus wanted to roll his eyes. He desperately wanted to free a book from his bag, but Peter’s scornful words held him back. </p><p>“I’m from the Pettigrew family.” Peter went on excitedly, obviously trying to impress Sirius in some way. “We’re an old family. My dad worked for the black family once!” </p><p>“Is that so?” Sirius drawled. “I haven’t heard too much about the Pettigrew family, but it sounds as if you are a noble sort.”</p><p>Remus snorted and looked out the window.</p><p>“What do you think’s so funny?” Sirius shot archly, his lip curling. </p><p>“Nothing. Honest.” Remus held his hands up in defense.</p><p>“What family are you from?” Sirius pressed, his defiant tone like a knife at Remus’ throat.</p><p>“Lupin.” Remus said quietly.</p><p>“Huh. Never heard of them.” Sirius snorted. “Muggle born, are you?”</p><p>Remus blinked. A wave of embarrassment he didn’t understand washed over him, making his face burn. He’d never heard anyone use such a nasty tone talking about being muggle born before. Was it bad to be muggle born? Or to have muggle parents?</p><p>“No—my dad’s a wizard-“ Remus snapped, self-conscious shame making him sink back into the seat.</p><p>Sirius’ expression twisted up into a look of disgust. “That makes sense.”</p><p>Remus was shocked. He felt his stomach twist up in a strange sort of rage.</p><p>“Remus—Remus the Black family are really famous. Really old, powerful blood. You must be like, a protégé or something!” Peter gushed. </p><p>Remus stood, Sirius’ expression boring into him. He snatched his bag strap, his hands shaking. </p><p>“Where are you going?” Sirius sneered.</p><p>“Somewhere less rude I think.” Remus said cooly. “Wouldn’t want to muddy your trip with my unappealing last name.” </p><p>“Hah. Well, a coward like you would never make it into a strong house. Nice knowing I won’t be seeing you in the slytherin common room.” Sirius laughed, a cold, hard sound.</p><p>Remus, with all the dignity he could muster, walked to the door, opened it, and turned to face the boys. “Good day then.” He said with a polite smartishness. He swung the door shut.</p><p>He faced the now empty corridor, suddenly aware that there was likely no place for him to sit. He inched down the cramped space, not entirely sure what to do. He couldn’t just swing a door open and invite himself in like Sirius had done. The train was moving now. Where would he go?</p><p>A few doors down, a compartment slid open and a girl stepped out. She had a mass of curling, red hair. She bent and snatched a pen from the ground. “Hah! I knew I dropped it…” She stood, catching sight of Remus.</p><p>“Haven’t you got a seat?” She asked brightly. Remus shook his head. She stepped up to him, grabbing his arm and hauling him back into her compartment with her. “Hello! I’m Lily Evans!” She grinned, sticking out a hand for him to shake. He took it, a sheepish smile crossing his own face.</p><p>“Remus Lupin.” He said softly.</p><p>“Well, it’s lovely to meet you!” Lily beamed. “This is Severus Snape, and that’s Molly Weasley! She’s a second year!”</p><p>Remus’ eyes flickered over the other two. Molly could have been Lily’s sister with matching wild hair and freckles. She patted the seat next to her and Remus sat gingerly. He felt shy and unsure. He glanced at the boy huddled into his seat. He had stringy black hair and a sallow complexion. He looked as anxious as Remus felt. </p><p>“C’mon Severus, don’t be so grumpy.” Lily gave the boy an encouraging prod, but Severus only grunted and tried to push Lily’s hand away. She gave Remus an apologetic look. </p><p>“It’s alright, I’m nervous too.” Remus said kindly. “Do you know which house you want to be sorted into?”</p><p>Lily shrugged. “Honestly not really. I have a feeling it’ll be Ravenclaw though. How about you.” She was twirling her ballpoint pen in her fingers. Rems blinked. A ballpoint pen. She probably came from a home with muggles and Remus instantly felt far more relaxed. He also noted that she had a book sitting on the sweater beside her on the seat. Remus decided right there that he liked Lily. </p><p>“Well…” Remus picked at a stray string on his bag strap. “Honestly, I figure I’ll probably end up in Hufflepuff or something…but I’d like to be in Gryffindor.” Remus whispered.</p><p>“I’m in Gryffindor!” Molly grinned. “It’s awesome. Everyone gets blue in the face about Quidditch, and the dormitory has the best view!” </p><p>Remus smiled at Molly, appreciating her enthusiasm. Lily was giving him a questioning look now, obviously curious about his reasoning.</p><p>“Are you into Quidditch and such?” She asked. Remus shook his head.</p><p>“Not really no. Honestly, I much prefer a book over any sport…I love studying and I’m very excited for classes. I-I was homeschooled before now.” Remus said quietly. “But I want to be in Gryffindor because I want to be brave. I want to find adventures and take chances.”</p><p>Remus glanced up at Lily and caught the wonder and appreciation in her expression. She smiled at him. “Then I hope you get sorted there.” She said quietly.</p><p>Molly nodded in agreement. “Wanting to be brave means you already sort of are you know. It means you are open to taking chances.”</p><p>“Oh…you don’t know the half of it.” Remus laughed, finally feeling himself start to relax.</p><p> </p><p>The train ride extended into a gentle, steady rhythm. The clear, blue sky acted as the train’s guide across the tracks that wound through first hills, and then stretches of farmland, and finally mountains. Lily and Remus talked about the books they had enjoyed over the summer. Lily told Remus about her parents, who owned a beautiful flower shop in Surrey. Severus said very little, his nose firmly stuck in a potions textbook. </p><p>“Did you lot remember to pack your school robes?” Molly asked. She had stood, tugging her own from her bag. “We should probably get changed.”</p><p>Remus nodded, opening his bag and pulling them out and barely hiding his relief at not accidentally leaving them on his bed at home. </p><p>“Good.” Molly grinned. “Alright, you two out. We’ll change first, and then you can, Remus.” Remus nodded. As Severus stood, Remus realized that he was already wearing his uniform. He was surprised he hadn’t thought to just wear his onto the train. </p><p>They stepped outside into the corridor so the girls could change, and he glanced at Severus. “You and Lily seem to be good friends.” He said pleasantly. </p><p>“Yeah.” Severus muttered. He tugged at the front of his robes, shuffling his feet. </p><p>“Did you two grow up together?” Remus asked curiously.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.” Severus growled, suddenly obviously uncomfortable. Remus was surprised, but he opted to stay quiet. </p><p>They stood in silence for several long minutes, until the door finally reopened. “Alright, Remus it’s your turn! Severus and I are going to go find the snack trolley!” Lily bounded out, snagging Severus by the arm and dragging him off. Molly laughed.</p><p>“I’m going to go make sure my stupid big brothers aren’t lighting anything on fire. I’ll be right back.” Molly gave Remus a lazy salute and then she sauntered down the corridor in the opposite direction.</p><p>Remus stepped back into the compartment, shutting the door behind him. The low rumble of the train was a welcome disturbance to the otherwise sudden and overwhelming silence. He was grateful for the privacy in changing, but he couldn’t help feeling a bit at a loss. </p><p>He tugged his clothes out, stripped down quickly, and redressed. </p><p>As Remus straightened, he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass of the windows. He looked awkward. The robes were a little big, so he could grow into them according to his mother. His tie was straight, but the knot was clumsy, and his brownish hair was a mop of frumpy half curls. </p><p>The door behind him opened and Lily burst back into the compartment. In her arms she held three boxes of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans, and several chocolate frogs. She thrust a box at Remus and beamed. “Thought you might like one!”</p><p>“Thank you-“ Remus graciously accepted the treat, despite the dangerous flavors that lurked within. “I haven’t got anything I can share with you though…”</p><p>“It’s not trouble, honest. I wasn’t going to just get the lot for myself.” Lily flopped back onto her seat and dumped the sweets between them. “Severus is using the loo, but he’ll be back. Where’s Molly?”</p><p>“She said something about her brothers and a fire?” Remus offered, watching her delicately extracting a chocolate frog from its case. She let out a gasp of surprise when the frog leaped from the container.</p><p>“They really do jump!” She grinned. “I’ve never seen one before! How amazing-“ She watched as the enchanted candy frog scuttled across her book. Then she seemed to register what Remus had said. </p><p>“Fire?” She asked, startled. </p><p>“I’m not really sure-“ Remus started, but the door opened again, and Severus, followed by Molly reentered the space.</p><p>“Was something really on fire?” Lily asked Molly immediately, thrusting a chocolate frog at her.</p><p>“Not this time.” Molly said, she threw herself dramatically to her seat. “Being a member of the Prewett family is a great burden.” </p><p>Remus, still holding his carton of beans, sat staring at Molly. He’d never heard of the Prewetts, but he caught a look from Severus he couldn’t quite decipher. Like a carefully concealed version of the look Sirius had given him earlier. </p><p>Molly caught Remus staring and she laughed, wagging a finger. “Don’t you lot worry, you’ll have the pleasure of meeting my idiot twin brothers soon enough. They’re fourth years in Gryffindor.”</p><p>Remus nodded, wondering as to what sort of fellows could cause a younger sister to need to check on them for explosive fires on a train. He decided he’d just find out when he had to.</p><p> </p><p>It was well past dusk by the time the train came to a laborious halt at the Hogwarts platform. The evening sky was clear, the stars a perfect backdrop against the silhouette of the castle in the distance. The moon was a single sliver cut into the indigo velvet. </p><p>As Remus stumbled off the train and into the cool, end of summer air, he stuck very close to Lily. Ahead of them, he spotted Peter and Sirius. </p><p>“First years this way!” Remus blinked as he attempted to comprehend what he was seeing. At the front of the crowd was a very large man. He wasn’t very old, probably in his late twenties, but his shoulders could easily have held a tree. He had the beginnings of a beard started, and as Remus moved in closer, he realized he must be something like eight feet tall. </p><p>“This way now, follow me!” The man called, chuckling as the first-year students surrounded him. “How’d you like a boat ride across the lake. Arrive in style, the lot’o ya.” </p><p>“Boat ride?” Remus attempted to look around the man. He could just make out, on the surface of the lake that bordered the castle, a fleet of boats sitting on the glassy surface of the water. Lily bounced excitedly on the balls of her feet. </p><p>“Oh that is so cool!” She bumped Remus with her bouncing. Lily’s infectious excitement was aiding to quell the extreme anxiety that had surfaced as the train had halted. </p><p>They were led to the boats and separated into groups of four. Lily, Severus, Remus and a new boy were loaded up. In the light cast by the lantern hung on the prow by a hook, Remus could see the boy better. He had round glasses that sat crookedly on his nose, and a smudge of dirt ran over one cheek. His hair was a wild dark mess, but the smile on his face was bright with excitement and a little more deviousness that Remus was expecting from a load of nervous eleven-year-olds. </p><p>“I’m James-“ the new boy introduced. “James Potter—you reckon there’s a monster in there?” He jabbed a thumb at the center of the lake. “My dad said there is- can you believe that!”</p><p>“There’s no monster.” Lily said sternly, looking at James. “They wouldn’t float us crossed it if there were.”</p><p>“Alright boys and girls,” The man, Hagrid as he had introduced himself, called out to the students. “Now try not to stick and fingers in the water. I don’t want anyone losin’ any right before the sortin’.”</p><p>James shot Lily a look and wiggled his fingers. “Monsttterrrrr-“</p><p>Lily humphed and crossed her arms over her chest. “Maybe he’s just having us on.”</p><p>Remus looked at Severus, who had said nothing at all as they had been loading up. What he saw shocked him. He had fixed James Potter with one of the most hateful looks Remus had ever seen. As if the sheer fact that James existed were unexpectable. Severus glanced at Remus, who looked purposefully up at the castle, pretending he hadn’t seen anything.</p><p>The boats began to move, all at once and without any sort of aid. Remus caught the side in a death grip as they lurched forward. James’ teasing expression softened, and he leaned forward, giving Remus’ knee an easy pat. </p><p>“Hey, it’s alright. They’re only enchanted.” James said. “Nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“Enchanted?” Remus echoed. Despite himself, James’ reassurance eased him, and he took in a slow breath. Every time he looked at the castle, his heart twisted in his chest, knowing that soon he’d be sorted. Soon he would be placed in the next seven years of his life. If he didn’t bugger it up.</p><p>“Yeah. Cool huh?” James beamed. Remus nodded and looked at Lily, who was eyeing James with a sort of measured curiosity. </p><p>“How do they do that?” She asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure how on boats, but my mum used to do it to my—” James went a little red as he faltered. “Uh—to my toys. In the tub. When I was little.” </p><p>Remus recalled his father using his want to levitate cups of coffee to his mother, or a book to her when she had been pregnant with Claire. He nodded.</p><p>“That makes sense. Like how it’s done on smaller things but stronger.” Remus tapped the side of the boat thoughtfully.</p><p>“I can’t wait to learn how.” Lily said softly, awe tracing her tone.</p><p> </p><p>The boats glided in across the lake and brought them up to the shore just a short walk from the castle. They disembarked and Hagrid lead them up a path that had been worked into the grass over generations of students. Remus’ eyes were now fixed on the castle itself.</p><p>From the train platform, the towers and ramparts had looked like something painted into a storybook, but now the enormity of it seemed impossible. The carved stone was like a fortress, powerful and intimidating to Remus, who felt no more than a foot tall as they approached the staircase that lead up to the main entrance. Before the massive, oaken doors a woman stood waiting for them.</p><p>“I am Professor McGonagall-“ She said in a tight, clipped voice. “If you would follow me, I will lead you to the Great Hall, where you will begin the Sorting Ceremony and be introduced to your fellow housemates.” </p><p>Remus couldn’t stop staring at Professor McGonagall. She was in her forties, her robes a mix of rich emerald greens and dark greys. On her head was a witch’s hat. Remus just couldn’t get over the hat. In all his years, he had never seen his father ever dress in that sort of hat. It reminded him of the books he had read with his mother of a muggle’s idea of witches and wizards. He just couldn’t believe anyone magical would wear one. He was torn between laughter, and amazement. His mum would probably have found it hilarious. </p><p>Lily nudged him, and he realized that they were being led up the stairs. He stumbled to catch up and they stepped inside the doors.</p><p>They walked down a long outdoor corridor that was boarded on one side by large windows, and on the other, the sprawling castle courtyard. Then they were up another set of stairs, and through another even more enormous door that led them into the castle.</p><p>Inside, the walls were hung with candle lit torches. The hall itself was one magnificent room. On the far side of the room, three massive staircases extended upward and into the vast space above. Two descended out of sight. Remus could just make out some attached hallways that tapered away to other rooms and spaces probably just as discombobulating as this one. </p><p>Professor McGonagall brought them to a halt outside yet another set of doors. These were different. They were ornately carved, and though they seemed to be made of wood, they had almost a metallic sort of heaviness to them. </p><p>“Alright, this is the Great Hall. When I open these doors, you will follow me to the front of the hall, where you will be lined up. When the sorting begins, I will call you names, and you will step forward, and have a seat on the stool we have set for you. Then you will be sorted, and I will direct you to your table. Is that understood?” McGonagall said, her tone sharp and firm.</p><p>There was a weak acknowledgement made. Remus glanced around him, now surrounded by a wash of extremely anxious faces. A few students looked pale to the point of green. Remus’ own heart was hammering out a beat against his sternum. He swallowed hard. Beside him, Lily wrung her hands and bit her lower lip. Remus cast around the group for Sirius Black. He was standing near the back now, his face ghost white, all signs of aloof arrogance gone. He looked like he might be sick on his own expensive shoes.</p><p>Sirius looked up at just that moment, and they made eye contact. Remus thought to look away, before Sirius made a sour face at him. Instead in that locked intensity, Sirius’ expression was awash with helpless fear that shattered his entire façade like china being dropped on stone. He urgently searched Remus’ face, as if attempting to find something there, and Remus surprised himself. He smiled as warmly and gently as he could and mouthed ‘you’ll be fine’. </p><p>Sirius gave a little nod. And then looked away pointedly.</p><p>When Remus looked forward again, he found he wasn’t so scared. McGonagall had pulled open the doors, and strangely he felt calm. He felt collected and grounded and ready. He was still nervous, but he wasn’t afraid.</p><p>“You ready?” He asked Lily. She gave him a smile, fierce courage shinning at him from bottle green eyes. </p><p>“You better believe it.”</p><p>McGonagall led them into the hall. There were four very long tables, where students were already seated. Each had a different set of colorful banners waving over them. They were brought to a halt at the very front of the hall, where placed on the raised platform were the professors were all seated at there table, sat a stool.</p><p>An older man stood. His beard was long and white, and nearly touched the belt at his middle. Remus watched as he stepped up beside the stool to address the first years, and the other students watching.<br/>
“Another year has begun, and as is tradition, I have the honor as headmaster to welcome the new students to Hogwarts. Each of you will be sorted and placed into your house to begin the schoolyear with a customary feast as you meet your fellow housemates.” </p><p>Remus realized that this man was Albus Dumbledore. The only headmaster who had taken his parents pleading and listened. The man who had made his future, this moment, something that could exist. Remus was awash with gratitude, as he watched Dumbledore lift an old, battered hat off the stool. He held it up for everyone to see.</p><p>“And now, if you would be so kind, Minerva, to read the first name on your list, I think we are ready to begin.”</p><p>Remus watched as the first girl stepped up. The hat was placed on her head, and it seemed to bunch and twist. Remus was struck suddenly, by the understanding that the bunching and squirming bits seemed to be a mouth. A hat with a mouth.</p><p>And then the hat spoke. </p><p>“Hufflepuff!!” It boomed out across the hall.</p><p>The Hufflepuff table erupted into applause as the girl stood, and McGonagall pointed her to one of the empty seats at the end of her new table.</p><p>Students were called one by one, to go under the hat. When Lily’s name was called, Remus gave her an encouraging smile. </p><p>Lily strode up to the headmaster and sat with purpose on the stool. The hat was placed on her head, and it hummed thoughtfully. “What a bright mind. Very bright, and inquisitive. Such strength, such determination—Gryffindor!!” The hat called.</p><p>Lily looked stunned. She searched the faces for a moment, and Remus realized she was looking at Severus, who wasn’t looking at her. He had turned his head.</p><p>A few students later, James Potter was called. The hat barely touched his head before it barked Gryffindor again. James grinned and hopped off the stool, sitting across from Lily at the clapping Gryffindor table.</p><p>When Severus was called, Remus watched him slink to the steps. He sat on the stool, not looking at the headmaster. The hat didn’t even touch his head before is shouted Slytherin at top volume. Remus blinked in surprise. He looked at Lily, who was looking down at her lap.</p><p>“Remus Lupin.” McGonagall called.</p><p>Remus’ heart jumped. He worked his way through the remaining students and up the short steps to the platform. Dumbledore fixed him with a warm smile, and Remus was surprised to return it with strength. His heart was racing as he sat on the stool. A dizzying number of faces were glued to him as the hat was placed on his head.</p><p>“Such heart you have, for such an age. What a strong and unbreakable mind. Gryffindor!” </p><p>Remus sat, stunned for a long second, and then he remembered to breathe. He stumbled off the chair, not missing the proud look Dumbledore gave him. McGonagall looked equally pleased as she pointed him to his table. He thanked her and headed off to take the seat beside Lily. </p><p>“You did it!” She beamed, and Remus nodded. He was sitting at the Gryffindor table. He had been sure he would have been in Hufflepuff, like his father had been. He was so deeply stunned he almost missed the next name being called.</p><p>“Sirius Black!” Called McGonagall, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. A hushed whisper ran through the room. Remus was surprised by the stir. The Slytherin table was suddenly very alert, all eyes trained on the him. </p><p>Remus watched Sirius come up the steps. He was doing his best to look unaffected and composed. He perched himself on the chair importantly, and Dumbledore lifted an eyebrow. Remus didn’t miss the look of amusement that crossed the headmaster’s face as he settled the hat on Sirius’ head.</p><p>A deafening hush shifted across the hall. It stretched on and Remus caught the look of panic that shot through Sirius’ expression.</p><p>“You can be who you choose.” Remus heard the hat murmur, and then the mouth of the hat screwed up. “Gryffindor!”</p><p>The hall stayed perfectly quiet. Sirius sat frozen to the seat. No clapping erupted, no happy cries, nothing of any sort. It was dead silent. Dumbledore lifted the hat and smiled warmly at Sirius. Sirius seemed to be internally melting. He lingered on the stool, and then slowly and stiffly he stepped down. He stumbled past McGonagall and staggered down the steps. He was forced to take the seat beside James, where he sat motionless, staring at the scuffed wood of the table like he was processing news of someone’s death.</p><p>Remus was so busy trying to decipher Sirius’ reaction he didn’t look up when Peter’s name was called. He glanced up when another strange silence started to stretch. Peter seemed to be muttering. With his hands clasped in his lap he looked like a kid begging not to be grounded. He seemed to argue with the hat for what seemed like an age, and finally the hat barked Gryffindor though it seemed a bit confused. Peter hoped down and planted himself next to Sirius, grinning at him.</p><p>Sirius didn’t look at him. He was still staring at the table. Remus couldn’t help but think that with the defeated look and the way his shoulders sagged, he looked like a man who’d been given a death sentence. </p><p>“I’m so glad we are in the same house.” Lily said to Remus, pulling his attention from Sirius.</p><p>“Me too.” Remus agreed. He didn’t miss her glance to the Slytherin table. “I thought for sure you two would be in the same house.”</p><p>“I would have been more surprised if we had.” Lily said, a hint of sadness creeping into her voice. Remus frowned wonderingly. He had a feeling that this held a much bigger significance than he could possibly understand. Lily caught his concerned look and she tried for a softer smile.</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay! We’ll have classes together! We can do a study group!” She seemed to bounce back at the thought of it.</p><p>“That would be amazing.” Remus said eagerly. “I haven’t never gotten to do anything like that before.”</p><p>“Because of the homeschool?” Lily asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>“Yeah-“ Remus said quickly, cursing himself for saying something like that out loud. “T-there weren’t a lot of other kids my age near my house for things like that, so I usually worked alone.”</p><p>“Well, that sounds awful. We’ll need to fix it.” She smirked mischievously. “I hear chocolate is amazing for study sessions.”</p><p>“Really?” Remus laughed. “Well, I you might be able to persuade me into it then.” </p><p>Remus noticed James trying to talk to Sirius, his expression a strange mask of understanding. None of the other kids had tried to talk to Sirius at all since he’d sat except Peter. James was saying something Remus couldn’t make out.</p><p>All other conversation was cut off, however, as suddenly the table was filled with enormous quantities of food. Remus and Lily talked between bites about classes they were excited for, and eventually trailed off as exhaustion and food coma made them sluggish.</p><p>McGonagall finally stood and she and three other teachers introduced themselves as heads of house. McGonagall was head of Gryffindor house, and with a wave of her hand, they stood, and she led the out of the great hall.</p><p>As Remus followed behind, he realized that this was it.</p><p>This was the beginning of a very big adventure.</p>
