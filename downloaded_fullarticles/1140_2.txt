          <div class="userstuff"><p>His most loyal, most trusted Death Eaters stood in a circle within a small room, the furthest one underground in the Malfoy Manor. They were here to bear witness to this indescribably important event.</p><p>“Nagini, to me.”</p><p>He spoke the language of his ancestor, the great Salazar Slytherin. His precious Horcrux crept through the bushes so quietly, so surreptitiously, that a few of his minions startled, and he noticed a few flinch at his words. He will punish them later. He had work to attend to.</p><p>A young Draco Malfoy stood in the center, with a white-knuckled grip upon a dirty muggle, tied up and unconscious, that was to be used for their purposes.</p><p>“Draco,” He spoke now, his voice high and cold, soulless and unfeeling, “bow.”</p><p>The Malfoy heir dropped to his knees at once, but he dared not move from his place in the circle. Evidently he had been prepared.</p><p>“Do you pledge your loyalty to me, and only myself, for as long as you may live?”</p><p>“Y-Yes, Master. I do.”</p><p>“Prove it.”</p><p>Here, Draco took an enchanted silver dagger from his robes, where his wand normally would have been. </p><p>“Rennervate,” the muttered spell was performed by Lucius Malfoy, the boy’s father.</p><p>The muggle scum woke, glanced around, and promptly began to scream. He was soon silenced by Draco’s shaking hand driving the dagger into the animal’s throat.</p><p>Draco had flinched away so violently that a great crack could be heard alongside that of the muggle’s neck.</p><p>“Your arm.”</p><p>Draco nearly ripped his sleeve because of how badly his hand shook. He held up his bare left arm, awaiting the coveted Mark.</p><p>“The dagger.”</p><p>With his right hand, Draco shakily handed Him the bloody dagger. His Lordship used it to lightly spread the filthy blood upon the pure arm held before him.</p><p>“Nagini.”</p><p>His loyal Horcrux then bit Draco, injecting her venom into his arm. In Parseltongue, he whispered,</p><p>“Born of the blood of the dirty and unwanted,</p><p>Live upon the flesh of the worthy and Pure.</p><p>Leaving the skull to coil in wait,</p><p>Forever you shall remain.”</p><p>Draco nearly passed out from the pain. No matter. He was worthy now.</p></div>
