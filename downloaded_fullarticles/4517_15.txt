    <p>Credence tosses and turns on his bed, not yet able to sleep. He groans in frustration and finally relents to check the time. His pocket watch tells him it’s two in the morning. He can’t believe it’s that late; he needs to be up early to check on the creatures. He groans again. What will Newt think? That he can’t pull his weight around here?</p>
<p>Newt does the bulk of the work it seems, but he likes to help out as much as possible, whatever can be done without the aid of complicated magic. There’s nothing for it. Credence resigns to getting up and seeing if a change of scenery will help. The mooncalf enclosure is close by and so that’s the one he chooses to sit in. He brings a blanket and a small writing pad with him to sit on that little swell of ground where the mooncalves usually gather. They are sleeping now, and Credence looks upon them with fondness. They really are very cute.</p>
<p>            He flips through his little booklet and smiles at the little pictures he’d drawn next to his notes; he wonders if Newt’s book will have illustrations. It would be all the richer for it, he thinks. The creatures in the magical world are vibrant and deserve to be documented on paper in their forms and colors. Credence is still flipping through his notebook when he hears footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>            “Mind if I join you?”<br/>
            “Of course not Mr—Newt. I’m sorry, I hope I didn’t wake you up.”<br/>
            “Not at all Credence, I couldn’t sleep myself. Thought I’d come here and sit under the moonlight. Beautiful, isn’t it?” he rambles, trying to make meaningful small talk. Credence finds it endearing and yes, he does think it’s beautiful.</p>
<p>            “Oh, ah, here’s a cup of chamomile tea. I’ve made some for myself as well. It has relaxing properties that are said to be good for sleep,” he says, passing a cup to Credence.</p>
<p>            “Thank you Newt,” Credence says. He takes the proffered mug and sips the contents. It’s an herbal blend that he surprisingly enjoys. He had never drank much tea before meeting Newt, now he drinks it every morning, afternoon, and apparently night.</p>
<p>            “There’s tea for every occasion,” Newt says genially as if reading his mind. Credence chuckles.</p>
<p>            “So there is,” he says. “If you don’t mind me asking, what’s keeping you up Newt?”</p>
<p>Newt takes a sip of his chamomile and mulls this over. “I don’t know, really. I’m not one to worry, and everything’s taken care of. Just a bout of insomnia I suppose,” he swallows the last word with a sip of tea. “Are you alright then, Credence?” He asks, turning to gaze at the younger man with concern.</p>
<p>            “Oh yeah, same for me. I don’t know why, I just can’t sleep,” he says shrugging.</p>
<p>            “Well we’ll figure it out together then, won’t we? You know what I’ve just remembered, I’ve got some fresh lavender around here somewhere. Why don’t I go get us some?” Before Credence can say anything Newt has bound off to find fresh lavender for some reason. Credence shrugs and continues to sip away at his tea and look up at the stars. He wonders how Newt recreated the night sky so accurately.</p>
<p>            The man returns with sprigs of green leaves. They don’t look very impressive, or like lavender flowers Credence has seen.</p>
<p>            “Here we are! There you go, take some like this in your palms. That’s right, now roll it in your palms, almost like you’re crushing it. There you go, you’ve got it. Now go like this,” Newt says, bringing the crushed lavender to his face, “and inhale through your nose.” He takes a deep breath, holds it for four counts, and releases it slowly.</p>
<p>            “It smells like perfume,” says Credence.</p>
<p>            “It is used in perfumes, yes. But there are healing properties associated with lavender as well. The scent relaxes the mind and the body. It supposedly lifts melancholy and insomnia. Thought we’d give it a try ourselves, no?” Newt smiles and waves the little sprig around. Credence chuckles.</p>
<p>            “You’re very resourceful Newt. I can’t sleep and all of a sudden you’ve got every trick in the book for me to try. Thank you, but you don’t have to do all this,” Credence says, looking down and scratching at his notebook.</p>
<p>            “Oh Credence, you haven’t yet seen the full hot bath I was going to draw you.”<br/>
        
                    “What?!” Credence exclaims.</p>
<p>            “Only kidding. Unless you would like a hot bath, it’s also good for relaxation. Come to think of it I’ve also got some salts that would go great—only kidding!” Newt says, but Credence has the sneaking feeling that Newt would draw up a bath in a moment’s notice if he really asked for one.</p>
<p>            “Does the sound of rain please you Credence?”<br/>
          
                   “Um, yes, I suppose if I’m inside and I hear the rain, it calms me.”</p>
<p>            “What I can do for you is a short rain spell outside your tent, if you’d like.”</p>
<p>            “Sure, that sounds great if it’s not too much trouble.”<br/>
            “No trouble at all,” Newt says.</p>
<p>     
            “…Newt?”<br/>
            “Yes Credence?”<br/>
            “Can we sit here a while more?”<br/>
            “Of course we can.”</p>
<p>They sit there for a while more, sometimes talking and sometimes admiring the night sky in silence. Credence is the first to fall asleep with the lavender clutched to his chest. Newt smiles down at him in adoration. He conjures up another blanket to cover him with. In the distance, he starts a small rainstorm, hoping to soothe Credence in his sleep.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Credence,” he whispers before settling down next to him.</p>
