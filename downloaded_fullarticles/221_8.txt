    <p>Hey guys:)</p><p>I don't know what I am going to do in this story, but an idea just crashed my mind and I want to see where this is going to lead.<br/>
I hope you are going to enjoy the story and please have mercy with my grammar because my mother tongue is German ^^'</p><p>I see this as a practise and even though I already wrote a few fanfictions, in German though, I know that I am going to make mistakes.<br/>
So if you notice something don't hesistate to correct me :)</p><p>The first chapter will be uploaded within the next hours, I still need to correct and overwrite it.</p>
