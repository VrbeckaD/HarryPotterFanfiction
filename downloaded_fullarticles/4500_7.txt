He smiles gently, knowing all too well how off-putting his appearance can be - especially for the stuck-up teachers of this private school Newt goes to.</p><p>One of them stands in front of him right now. Theseus does a double take, a small sound of surprise escaping his mouth.</p><p>Gleaming shoes, tight pants, a waistcoat highlighting the man’s narrow waist and broad shoulders. Five o’clock shadow on his jaw. Keen dark eyes, hidden behind a pair of glasses framed with gold. The teacher smiles back, and Theseus finally meets his eyes.</p><p>His heart immediately skips a beat. He feels hot then cold, attraction making itself known in every fiber of his being. The man looks as surprised as Theseus at the feeling - and then, he is bashful. He ducks his head and crosses his arms over his chest. He clears his throat.</p><p>Theseus isn’t sure how his voice is supposed to be working anymore.</p><p>“Y - yeah?” He finally manages to say. He balls his hands into fists, hoping his blush isn’t as noticeable as he feels it is.</p><p>The teacher doesn’t seem to know where to start. He bites his lips as he looks up at Theseus, and Theseus swallows audibly. Fuck.</p><p>“You’re, hum. You’ve been scaring the students,” the teacher states, smiling. “They’re wondering if you’re, and I quote, ‘a bad man’. The headmistress made me come down to ask you to leave.”</p><p>Theseus sighs. He’d somehow expected this. “Look, sir -”</p><p>“Percival.”</p><p>“Percival. Class ends in, what, twenty minutes? I’m just here to fetch my little brother. Newton Scamander.”</p><p>“Oh!” Percival’s face lights up. “You’re the brother? He thinks very highly of you. I should have recognized you in the drawings of his family. There’s always someone hovering in the background, wearing black.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Theseus rubs the back of his head with one hand, embarrassed. “That would be me. You’re Mr. Graves, then?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well.” Theseus holds his hand out, remembering his manners. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir. You seem like a great teacher - better than the ones I’ve had, if Newt’s enthusiasm is anything to go by.”</p><p>Percival seems genuinely happy at hearing that. Theseus just barely remembers to breathe in front of his smile. Percival’s hand is warm in his as he shakes it. Warm and big. “He is brilliant. Usually his mom comes to fetch him, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. She couldn’t make it. I don’t mind doing it, though.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Silence falls again. Percival has moved his hands to his pockets, and their eyes meet again. Theseus feels warm all over; his heart is beating faster. This is ridiculous. This is the first time he has been so attracted to someone in his life.</p><p>“Say -”</p><p>“Would you -”</p><p>“Sorry. Go on.”</p><p>Percival chuckles. “I was going to say, would you agree to have coffee with me?”</p><p>Theseus gawks. He swears his heart does a double flip before breaking into a victory dance. “I’m - I, hum, I - it’s - I’m –”</p><p>Percival holds his hands up, looking worried. “I’m sorry, it’s just - you feel it too, right?”</p><p>Yeah. “Yeah, I fucking do.”</p><p>Percival smiles again, relieved. “Then let’s meet up. I need to get to class now, but - here.” The man reaches inside his waistcoat pocket, and Theseus suppresses a groan. Of course the man keeps business cards on him all the time. What the hell. “My number. Text me anytime. God willing, I’d really love to see you again.”</p><p>Damn it, damn it, damn it.</p><p>“I - I will. Call you. Yes.”</p><p>“Good. Have a good day, Mr. Scamander.”</p><p>“You too,” Theseus replies weakly. “And it’s Theseus.”</p><p>“Theseus?”</p><p>“Scamander. Theseus Scamander. That’s my name.”</p><p>“Oh. It’s a lovely name.” Percival winks at him as he says it, and damn it, it shouldn’t make Theseus feel as flustered as a schoolgirl with a crush. He’s faced down men twice his size. What the fuck is this. “I hope to see you soon.”</p><p>The teacher turns around and trots back to his classes, hands still in his pockets.</p><p> </p>
