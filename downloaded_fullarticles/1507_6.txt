    <p>"I do not suppose any of you have every heard the term 'schwellenangst'?" My question is rhetorical, but many of my students shake their heads in a firm no. "It means 'a fear of crossing a threshold to embark on something new.' That is what your assignment will be. To create something new, something that makes you worried to show anyone. I believe that is all for this week, remember no class next week. See you in two weeks."</p><p>The class spent the next few minutes packing up, and saying their goodbyes to me. I was very excited for this specific project. The last weeks every single submission to me was the same as the last, and I wanted to see something new.</p><p>I waited until everyone had left, before placing a hand on my cane and struggling to my feet. I wince slightly as the usual sharp pain flares up through my left leg. I jolted a bit, but was able to doddle around the room cleaning up the leftover bits from my students. The class was fairly small, and the classroom even smaller. But it serves its purpose. I am able to teach my three times a week, and as an even better part, it is only six blocks away from my house. The walk would take a healthy person perhaps five minutes, it takes me the better part of a half hour to make it this short trek. It is not that bad in the summer time, but during the winter it can be quite dreadful. The lucky news is that it is only autumn at the moment, as well as a comfortable 65 degrees. I grab my students portfolios, tucking them under my arm as I lock the door. I put my cane into my left hand, leaning heavily on it as I walk down the front steps.</p><p>I have always enjoyed walking through New York City, something about the buildings and people helped me stay inspired for my more mundane paintings. I don't suppose there is a more magical city in America, than New York. And that is really saying something. I moved to New York when I was twenty, and now after eight years I've just barely scrapped the surface of the city. I never really expected myself to land in Manhattan, I always saw myself in a rural area. Maybe running a schoolhouse, or selling portraits for small town people. But now that I am here, I couldn't see myself anywhere else.</p><p>As I look into the windows of the shops, and pass through crowds of muggles walking home (ignoring the odd looks at my misshapen legs) I couldn't help but notice the change in the air. Something was coming, something drastic. A shiver went up my spine as a vision flitted across my eyes.</p><p>No longer enjoying my stroll I went for the quicker option. I ducked around a corner into an alleyway and disapparated home. I felt an instant wave of relief as the warm aura of my apartment brushed over me. I knew exactly what was going to happen the instant I removed my coat.</p><p>A trance always comes over me. From what I've been told, my eyes turn to a cloudy white, and I cannot be woken from this state. I let it happen. I let it flow through me, controlling my hands as they paint. I never really remember the process. But whenever I wake up, I am always covered in paint (which is fully understandable). The painting is beautiful, full of life, full of wonder. </p><p>And full of creatures and people that I do not know.</p><p>I make myself a cup of cocoa and look over the painting many times.</p><p>It's like this every time. I never know the situation around the painting, I rarely know the characters in the painting, and once it's painted, it's set in time. With no ability to change.</p><p>I remember when I was at school, before I realized what I was, I would paint on the walls in the dormitory at Hogwarts. None of my housemates understood why this trance would come over me. It really wasn't until I graduated that I even understood it myself.</p><p>Seer's are rare.</p><p>We tend to show up when something important is going to happen, and there is only one of us in the world at a time. I'm not sure what my importance will be in the world. I, at first, believed that it would fall within the Great War, but I was to young to do anything during that time. Most witches and wizards tend to be prejudice towards seers. Our showing up always means bad luck, and so lots of times they set out to stop us. </p><p>I finished my mug of cocoa, and set it into the sink. I stick a sheet over the painting, and left it as is, deciding just to deal with it tomorrow. I practically fell onto the couch in the living room and began massaging my lower calves. The ache in my legs began to dull the longer I massaged them.</p><p>My wand was were it always was, but I still panicked when I first looked for it. I felt comfort with it in my hand, the silver lime wood of the wand was dense, and I could feel the core pulsing through the wand. It was flexible, made of a rare wood. Garrick Olivander was confused when the wand chose me, but it all fell into place as I got older and learned my way through the world.</p><p>The day was moving late, and I let out a small curse when I remembered everything that I forgot. Wand permit, dinner, paint supplies, in my rush to get home for the painting, my tasks of the day slipped my mind. I slowly pulled myself to my feet, before reaching for my cane. I set off towards the front door, remembering to lock the door as I leave.</p><p>MACUSA headquarters was a bit further than my classroom, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I spent the "walk" there in silence, listening to the hum of the city and taking mental pictures of everything that I deemed beautiful. Inspiration for sketches at when I get home. The muggles were odd folk, but the longer I spent in muggle New York the more I learned to love it. Everything is so drastically different, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p><p>MACUSA headquarters looks normal on the outside. To the muggles, it was a run-down factory, but inside was something beautiful. I had been there quite a few times, but I was still astonished at the sheer size of the inside. Everything was gold platted, and shiny, just to show-off really.</p><p>Everything of course had to be so big, the floor space which of course meant more strain on me. I nodded at the people that I passed by, and stepped into the nearest elevator. I spoke to the House Elf on the elevator, before leaning against the wall to relieve the weight on my legs.</p><p>The permitting office was eight floors down, and I thanked the House Elf after I exited, and wandered through the maze of shelves looking for anyone who worked in this department. I continued through the office, and stumbled (quite literally) upon one of the only people who's presence I truly enjoy.</p><p>Porpentina Goldstein, affectionately called Tina.</p>
