    <p>As I stood there in that graveyard with my dear old friend the doctor and his latest companion, I never wholly thought that he would do what he did. In all the time that we had known one another, I thought that I knew him.  I thought that I knew him the best of anyone.</p>
<p>We had grown up on Gallifrey together, gone to the academy together. We were inseparable. Always trying to best one another, we were.  We were the best of the friends, and rivals. Each of us tried to out do the other at every turn.</p>
<p>As we grew up, we drifted off to do our own things, but I always knew I'd see him again. See him again I did. When he was with UNIT, we saw each other all time. I made plans and he foiled them. I got captured, and then escaped. What fun!</p>
<p>Time and time again we came together in a clash of minds and skills. It was always a thrill. The look on his face when he thought he'd defeated me and then encounter me again. No matter how many times I was imprisoned or shot at.</p>
<p>I knew he could secretly never get enough of me. How if I was truly gone how upset he'd be. So so sad.  How he would cry if he thought me truly dead. It happened on the valiant after all. He thought he'd won when he'd foiled my plans, but then I was shot and refused to regenerate. I “died” seeing the look of shock and sadness etched upon his then young looking face.</p>
<p>Then I returned again and we fought and then came together to send the time lords back to the time war. Too bad for them really. They shouldn't have tried to use me.</p>
<p>Now here I was back again, up against the doctor. He had once again foiled my plot. Using the dead to make a cybermen army, what a fantastic plan. A surprise for his birthday. Did he even say thank you? No he didn't. I went through all that trouble and he didn't even know it it was his birthday. What more could a girl do.</p>
<p>Then he had to go and destroy his gift. How rude! I was so sure he would like it too. Isn't an army what he had always wanted. Others to use to save the “good” guys and rescue innocents. So why did he reject my gift.</p>
<p>Now here we were standing in the graveyard where he had just rejected my gift moment before and he was holding my device against me. I couldn't believe he would use it to vaporize me just to save his companion's soul or whatever. Hadn't we been friends, rivals, for too many years? What was the doctor without his Missy?</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at me with his eyebrows all serious looking.</p>
<p>“Seriously.” I said. “Oh doctor. To save her soul.” I sauntered back towards a gravestone. I smiled at him and asked him, “And who my dear will save yours?”</p>
<p>He looked so troubled like he was thinking on it, like he didn't want to, but by that point, I knew he would do it. The doctor looked like a man defeated.</p>
<p>There he stood though with my own weapon against me. I knew I had won once again. An unexpected victory. The doctor was actually going to do it. Kill his best friend.</p>
<p>“Say something nice.” I said. “Please.”</p>
<p>He looked up at me and said “You win.”</p>
<p>I looked right back at him and said, “ I know.”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes as I heard him press the button. A flash of blue behind my eyelids and then poof I was no more. At least for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Moment later I was crashing back down to earth. “Oomph.” I heard escape my mouth. Then a sound like the scraping of a chair and then a thud as it hit the floor.</p>
<p>I took stock of myself and found myself on my knees facing a dark gray stone floor. Not very dignified at all. I was about to dust myself off when I felt something pressing into the back of my neck.</p>
<p>“Move and your dead mudblood! How dare you sneak into my rooms! Crucio!” A woman's voice screamed.</p>
<p>Pain like I had never felt or imagined stole over me. I screamed and I rolled upon the ground. I didn't know how long this when on before the pain stopped. I was on my back now and I slowly began to laugh. Soon it became hysterical. Clearly I had found someone just as insane as I was.</p>
<p>At this point I was still laughing. I looked up and found my attacker. It was as I had guessed a women. A women in a black ripped dress. She had dark wild hair and dark eyes that sparkled with madness and malice. I didn't know who she was or where I was but clearly I had found a kindred soul.  She was looking at me like a women possessed.  She was heaving and looked to be about to do whatever she had done before again, clearly angry that I was no longer in pain and that I had the audacity to laugh at her.</p>
<p>I suddenly stopped laughing and caulked my head at her. Maybe we could work together? She looked like a women with enemies and I wanted to test my wits against the doctor's once again. Together we could come up something special.  It could be fun.</p>
<p>I smiled at her. “Hello, I'm Missy. Pardon the interruption. I didn't mean to drop by so unexpectedly. My friend and I just had a disagreement and in the process I got sent here. I didn't mean to come here, but while I am here, maybe we could have some fun. You seem to like torture. I love torture. Maybe we could work something out? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?”</p>
<p>She looked a me sort of stunned, but I could see she was considering it. I couldn't wait to see what she would decide. The sooner we began to plan, the sooner I could see the doctor again.</p>
