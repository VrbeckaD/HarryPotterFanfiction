    <p>
  <span>“Last day of high school! Graduation in less than twenty-four hours!!” Bucky yelled while laughing. “Sam, Rhodey, and Tony are gonna come looking for us. Tony is so gonna say we’re going snail speed.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know they are,” Steve told him and looked up at the class of 1996 banner. “Bucky, all of us are going in the army except Tony. His smart ass is already in college. What are we gonna do? I don’t wanna leave you guys.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony has been attending college for the past four years but never has forgotten his friends from elementary and middle school. Tony walks to the school every day to walk his friends home since they all lived four blocks away from one another. He was the only one that lived away from everyone. His father, Howard, is the smartest man in the whole world. Tony has been expected to run his company after college instead of going to war with his buddies. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony doesn’t want to run his father’s company but is being forced too. He also knew that if his father found out about his relationship with one of his friends that it would be the end of time… maybe it’s a good thing. Tony leaned on his car (a red Jaguar XJS convertible) waiting for his friends to come out of the school. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There you are!” Tony yelled and waved to them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Rhodey and Sam already were sitting in the back of the car making faces from the windows at them. Steve and Bucky rolled there eyes laughing at them. Bucky jumped in the back between the boys. Steve got in shotgun while Tony got in the driver's seat. “Where do we wanna go on the last day of freedom?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The beach. No one will be at the beach since it rained earlier. That and we can all watch the sunset together for one last time,” Steve told him and looked at his lap.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright then let’s ride!” Tony yelled in excitement and started to drive. Tony blared AC/DC in the loudspeakers with the hood of the car down. Everyone was laughing as Tony sang along with the songs. Tony enjoyed being with his friends more than anything in the world. Especially with Steve.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once they were at the beach Tony sat in the sand watching the four other boys run around in the water splashing one another. Tony wished he could stop time right now and keep them all safe. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve walked up on the beach and sat next to Tony on the blanket. “Hey… you doing alright?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course. I have to be.” Tony told him and laid back looking up at the sky. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No, you don’t. Tell me what’s wrong.” Steve told him and grabbed his hand hiding it behind the bookbag pile. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony looked over at him and smiled slightly. “I’m losing all my friends. Your all gonna leave me here with Howard, Mom, and Jarvis! How am I gonna live without you guys?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tony… you're being dramatic.” Steve told him looking around making sure the coast was clear and kissed the top of his head. “I’ll miss you terribly.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony started to tear up. “Stop. I’m gonna cry. I hate saying goodbye. This better not be goodbye, Steven Rogers!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s hello to a new beginning. Walk with me.” Steve told him and got up pulling Tony up with him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The two boys walked down the beach until they were far enough not to be seen by the other boys in the group. Steve held Tony’s hand tight and kept kissing his fingers.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Steve…” Tony whispered and gripped his hands tighter. “I made something for you. I hope you like it because I know I do.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tony, you didn’t have too. I don’t think I can even take anything with me...” Steve told him and looked down at Tony.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony put a small box into his hand. “I made this in my welding class. It’s a ring… a promise ring. Swear to me you’ll come home. Always right?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve looked at the metal ring that had red, white and blue stained on the metal. Inside the ring, T+S 4 Ever engraved in yellow (Tony’s favorite color) “Always.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony leaned his head on Steve’s arm. “Stay out with me late tonight. It’s not like your gonna get in trouble. What time are you leaving?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Five tomorrow night. Four hours after graduation. That gives us time to spend with our family and loved ones. It’s so weird that Bucky is gonna come with me. My own friends are going to war with me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony nodded and pulled Steve close crying into his shoulder. “Soldier Boy, I love you. You better get your ass back home. I-I can’t live without you. Understand me?!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I do. It’s the end of the war. They just want more men to go overseas to help the citizens get adjusted to life again.” Steve told him rubbed his back softly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>World War Three tried to make an appearance on the world in 1985 when a bomb went off in Africa. Wakanda started war blaming America but found it was Korea who sent the bomb. Alliances were made, and more of the war blossomed all over the world. After four years of fighting peace, treaties started going around making peace with everyone. Not everyone has signed yet.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t wanna wait to come back…” Steve whispered to him. “We can drive to one of those hippy places and get married. You know I love you and you love me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay… sneak out tonight when Bucky isn’t watching. We’ll drive out there and be back by morning.” Tony whispered into his neck.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve smiled and pushed Tony away a bit seeing the other three boys walking there way. “Hey!” Bucky called out waving to the boys. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony stood and wiped his eyes on his sleeve. “Hey…” he looked down at his watch. “Fuck, I’m late. Boys we gotta go before my father cuts my face off.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright. You guys are all still coming to the party my moms throwing right?” Rhodey asked them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course,” Tony told them and walked behind everyone carrying his shoes and the blanket.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That night Tony sat outside the guy's apartment pacing. Steve and Bucky got there own place together when their parents died at war. His nerves were acting out making him having a panic attack every time a car drove by. When he saw Steve’s window open his heart left his chest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve jumped down and ran over to the car pulling Tony close by the shirt to kiss him. They didn’t stop until they both ran out of air in their lungs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“T-they saw us… kiss. The others.” Steve told him and pointed at the three boys on the porch. “They support us and want to come to the wedding…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony started to cry and hugged him tightly. Tony knew his family wouldn’t accept him, but if his friends did then nothing else mattered. “O-Of course… all who support us can come.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We can take my car,” Rhodey told him and smiled holding his keys out. “It has more room than your style-ish one.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t hate on Jessica! Your the one that has a minivan!” Tony yelled and took Steve’s hand into his. He enjoyed feeling his fingers intertwined with Steve’s.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After the four hour drive, they finally made it to the only gay bar on the east coast: Dum Dum’s home for same lovers. The building was blue and pink stripes with yellow and red lights outside. Everything was colorful and fun looking. Inside was another story. Everything was run down and gray. They went to the back of the building where the marriage sign was lite up.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The men started doing paperwork. “Sirs, we need you to pick a last name  to go by and then we can begin the ceremony.” The petite young brown hair lady told them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony gripped his hand. “Who’s last name are we taking?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I was thinking Stark-Rogers,” Steve told him and kissed the top of his head. “So you can keep it Stark Industries.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You're a genius,” Tony told him gripping his hand tighter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve shook his head. “I’m not the one that finished school while in the fifth grade. You're the genius.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up and kiss me already,” Tony told him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah go ahead of your married now.” The lady told them and popped a bubble of gum in front of them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony pulled Steve close and kissed him on his tiptoes. “I fucking love you. Remember me…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Always and language.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>- - - -</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Watching all of his best friends walk on to the plane Tony fell to his knees on the other side of the wired fence where other loved ones stood. Laying his head down to his knees wheezing. When the plane started to take off into the sunset Tony lost it. He sobbed in the spot for what seemed like for days but was only an hour. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony drove home to his house in Queens gripping the wheel. He was glad that he didn’t have a ring. His mother, Sarah, would have a heart attack from seeing his ring. He parked Jessica in his normal spot and walked into the house.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m home!” He called out and looked around and saw nobody but his butler, Jarvis. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sir, your parents have gone out and I don’t think they will be home anytime soon,” Jarvis told him with his hands behind his back. He wore a white suit with a black tie covered by an apron. “May I get you anything, sir?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No thank you,” Tony told him then whipped around to face him. “Yes, can you add paper, pens, stamps, and envelopes to the shopping list, please. They are all for me. The school has us writing to a famous scientist.” He lied through his teeth. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.” Jarvis bowed his head and walked off into the other room. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony went up to his bedroom and laid on the king size bed. He closed his eyes for what seemed like a minute but was truly for five hours. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A knock came at the door. “Tony…” Jarvis opened the door slowly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tony groaned and looked over at Jarvis. “What’s wrong, Jarvis?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Jarvis went and sat on the bed next to Tony. He took the boys hand in both of his. “There was an accident. Your parents are dead…” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That’s all Tony heard. He could see Jarvis’s lips moving but with no sound coming out of them. His poor mother. Killed. Tony was pulled closer to Jarvis as he rocked him slowly. All Tony could do was cry over his mother’s death. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>On the way to the funeral, a week later, Tony felt a hole in his stomach. He felt alone. More than usual these days as his life went on without his friends and family. All of his friends left into the Army and Airforce while he stayed here and made the weapons for the war. He was helping, but not like he wanted to. When they got the funeral Tony held the piece of paper close to his chest sniffling. He sat in the car reading the letter he wrote to Steve: </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Letter 1 </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Steve, my husband. It’s weird that we’re married. I’m glad we waited to do anything physical until you came back. I miss you every time I breathe. I’ve got chocolate here while I’m writing this to you. I wonder if you’ll be able to smell it when you get the letter. Anyway. I bet you haven’t heard the news. My father and mom died in a car crash the day you guys left. Father was drunk and swerved off the road hitting a tree head-on. They both died on impact. If that wasn't worst then the tree snapped and landed on top of the car while the EMTs were getting them out of the car and killed one of them.  I’m alone in the house with the maids and Jarvis. I’m going to fire everyone, but Jarvis I think. I hate this. I can’t wait till your home. I can’t run Stark Industries by myself. I’m smart, but not that smart. You're the genius in our family. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Enough about me and my depressing shit. How are you? What are you doing? I hope the letter finds you well. I need you well. Write to me when you can. I left you an empty piece of paper with the letter to respond with an envelope and stamps. I love you. I love you. I love you. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Love you, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Tony S.-R. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>P.s. let the others know I say hello. Tell Rhodey I didn’t like the underwear he left in my room!’ </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A week later after drinking all of the booze in his home Tony left the house to the liquor store. He stood in front of the city mailbox and sighed not wanting to let go of the letter. Setting it in the mailbox on the walk home he felt like he gave his heart out in the mail. He hoped and prayed that the letter would find Steve. </span>
