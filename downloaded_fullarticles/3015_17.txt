    <p>“Artemis, it’s time for dinner,” scolds Mrs. Scamander from across the house. Locked in her room, poised in front of a mirror with a knife and several chunks of her long dust-colored hair in hand, Artemis, age nine, only half-hears her mother’s beckoning. She’s far too focused on getting the angle of the sharp, antique silver knife just right.</p><p>Mrs. Scamander knocks none-too-gently on the locked door. “For heaven’s sake, your food will get cold--” She stops at the unmoving doorknob and adds, exasperated, <i>“Alohomora.” </i></p><p>As the handle twists open reluctantly, a chunk of hair falls to the floor. Artemis flinches and scrambles to put down the knife on the nearby dresser, but it’s too late. </p><p>An angry shout echoes through the house, and downstairs, seated at the dinner table, Theseus winces. A moment later, his little sister trudges down the stairs, closely followed by the yowling Mrs. Scamander. The left side of Artemis’s neck is exposed by a sloppy bob cut, while the rest of her hair continues down her shoulders. She’s also switched from a dress and stockings into a pair of Theseus’s old trousers and an ill-fitting white shirt buttoned to the throat. Their father takes one look at her and simply heaves a sigh, putting his head against his palm. However, Mrs. Scamander is red in the face and squealing like a teakettle. </p><p>“What’s gotten into you?” she snaps, angrily pulling out the chair in front of Artemis’s plate at the table. “First the Bowtruckles in the house, and now <i>this</i>?”</p><p>Artemis says nothing, staring at the floor, not moving to sit down. Her socks are two different colors and one is slipping off her right foot, like she had been trying on shoes earlier.</p><p>“It’s been growing out for years,” Mrs. Scamander continues, still incensed, standing arms akimbo at the head of the table. “You have such lovely, thick hair...why are you trying to make yourself look like a boy? Do you <i>want</i> people to think you’re ugly?”</p><p>Artemis opens her mouth, her light eyes flickering from her mother to Theseus in a silent plea for backup, then closes it again as nothing from her brother is forthcoming. “No,” she mumbles eventually.</p><p>Their father interjects, his thick brows creasing together, “Artemis, you’ve been acting out lately. Why are you making this so difficult for us? We just want you to be happy.”</p><p>“I don’t want to upset either of you,” Artemis says, very quietly, and seats herself at the table next to Theseus. Mrs. Scamander rolls her eyes, as if to say <i>Well, you already have,</i> but begins to serve the food (roast duck with gravy and a side of green beans and mashed potatoes), spooning a medium amount on her own plate and two larger portions for Theseus and Mr. Scamander. When she gets to Artemis’s side, she stops and says, in a gentler tone, “How much would you like, darling?”</p><p>“Oh,” her daughter replies, twisting the fabric of her overlarge shirt between her fingers, “I’m--I’m not hungry.” In a betraying response, her stomach growls under the table.</p><p>Theseus can see the next outburst from their mother coming up, and hastily tries to save his sister, saying, “Missy--just eat, won’t you?” Unfortunately, Artemis catches on just a moment too late, leaving Mrs. Scamander to narrow her eyes to slits once more. As she starts to spit something about how ungrateful one has to be to refuse a lovely home-cooked meal, <i>one in her daughter’s position, no less,</i> Artemis bows her head and takes a roll from the basket, setting it in the center of her plate with all the enthusiasm of a mortician at work. </p><p>Mr. Scamander creases his brow even more deeply, but says nothing except for “Theseus, please pass the gravy.” </p><p>The next few minutes are conducted in relative silence as three out of four Scamanders eat their respective meals. Artemis can feel her mother’s eyes burning into her skull, but can’t bring herself to take anything but bird-sized bites of the bread in front of her. </p><p>“So, son,” Mr. Scamander says finally, breaking the grave quiet around the table, “Are you excited to go back to Hogwarts after this summer break? Starting your seventh year, eh?” </p><p>Theseus nods. “Yes, and I’ve been studying for my upcoming NEWTs.” (Artemis looks up abruptly at the mention of the tests, but quickly directs her gaze back to the bowl of mashed potatoes, taking a tiny spoonful.) </p><p>Mr. Scamander strokes his beard, continuing, “I’m sure you’ll do well. You’re still looking into shadowing Aurors during your second term, yes?” When Theseus nods again, a pleased smile breaks out onto his father’s face. “Well done, well done. They’ll make a Minister out of you yet.”</p><p>Theseus says nothing for a moment, seeming uncomfortable with the attention, then hesitantly asks, “Missy, how’re the hippogriffs doing?”</p><p>Artemis visibly brightens, raising her head up, and says, “Clawstone is doing well, though she’s still getting over her mite problem, so we shouldn’t take her out of quarantine yet. Viridian’s chick is doing well, if a bit clingy. Oh, and Letty needs her wing feathers clipped and talons trimmed--I almost ripped my shirt on those claws of hers!” She grins and glances around the table, but when no smiles are forthcoming, her own disappears as she shrinks back slightly, adding in a mumble, “I mean...my dress.”</p><p>Stone-faced, Mrs. Scamander says, “After dinner, I expect you to wash the dishes and leave the hippogriffs’ nightly routines to me. Change into your nightdress as well--I won’t have you running around the house in trousers.” When Artemis looks appalled and opens her mouth to argue, her mother adds in a raised voice, “You shouldn’t be doing that dirty work anyway. You’re far too young to be taking care of those beasts--you could be trampled or as you astutely pointed out, clawed to death.”</p><p>“Mum--” Artemis pleads. Mrs. Scamander raises her eyebrow, cutting her daughter off. “No buts. After what you pulled with your ridiculous haircut, you should consider yourself lucky that we aren’t being more forceful with you.” She taps her fingers on the table, considering, and adds, “Frederick, dear, would you mind whipping up a growth potion for Artemis’s hair after supper?”</p><p>Theseus helplessly stares at his fork as their father uncomfortably nods in agreement. Artemis lowers her gaze, but Theseus can see her fists clenched under the table. </p><p>“Missy,” he whispers, leaning closer to his sister as their parents exchange the dishes of green beans for the platter of duck and begin to make small talk, “Just--just go with Mum and Dad’s wishes this time, won't you?”</p><p>Artemis turns to him, not quite meeting his eyes. She mumbles, “It’s easy for you.”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“It’s easy for you,” she says, a little louder, “to be the perfect son.” </p><p>Theseus stares at her, his gut twisting. “Talk after dinner?”</p><p>“Alright,” Artemis replies after some hesitation, her voice small.</p><p>“Loves,” their mother says knowingly, breaking apart the siblings with her not-to-be-argued-with tone, “Pie or strudel for dessert?”</p><p>---</p><p>After the table is cleared and the dishes are done (courtesy of the wandless Artemis), Theseus watches her watch their mother go outside to the hippogriff stables alone. As she’s staring longingly at the closing door, Theseus nudges his sister. “Hey. Talk?” </p><p>When she nods weakly, they traipse upstairs into Theseus’s room, adjacent to Artemis’s. Theseus has barely shut the door before Artemis bursts out, “How do you do it?”</p><p>“Do what?” Theseus asks, flicking his wand at a chair to pull up behind him. He settles in it and looks at his kid sister, but she ignores him, choosing to stand in the middle of the room, swinging her fists anxiously. The long half of her hair swishes behind her, the bobbed, cut side remaining, resolute, at her left ear. </p><p>Artemis’s tone is one of defeat as she mumbles, “How do I be like--be like you?” She kicks the carpet, fixated on the floor. “I’ve tried everything--tying my hair up, wearing your clothes--”</p><p>Bitterly amused, Theseus says gently, “Mum and Dad hate it when you dress like a boy, sis.”</p><p>“I don’t care!” she exclaims. “The hippogriffs don’t care, either. I don’t see why it matters whether I wear trousers or--or a dress when I’m pouring slop into their troughs!” She pauses to catch her breath, then continues passionately, “Skirts get in my way. I want to be a magical creature caretaker like Mother!”</p><p>Her big brother sighs and massages his temples with the world-weariness of a seventeen-year-old who, obviously, has the answers to everything. “Missy, this isn’t about you sneaking Bowtruckles and thestral calves into the house,” he tries. “Mum and Dad are upset because you’re acting like--like you’re male.”</p><p>“Why does it matter?” Artemis demands, stomping her foot, the shakiness of her lower lip and voice indicating that she’s close to tears. “So what if I act like a boy? Why can’t I be one?”</p><p>Theseus doesn’t have an answer to that. All he manages after a moment is, “You can still be a magizoologist, but...listen, you can’t make yourself into a man. It just…” He trails off. “It just doesn’t work like that.” He pauses again, deep in pensive thought, then adds, “You’re a girl, so you’re supposed to wear dresses, and--and it makes a lot of trouble for everyone when you put on my trousers, alright?”</p><p>Artemis finally looks up at him, her eyes glistening. “I’m sorry about that,” she says quietly, after a beat. “I shouldn’t have gone through your things.”</p><p>“No! Missy, that’s not the point!” Theseus finds himself growing frustrated, though he’s trying to stay calm. “Can you just--listen to Mum and Dad for <i>once?</i> Please?”</p><p>Instantly, he realizes his tone was too harsh. His little sister turns away from him, slouching over in defeat. He can tell how hard she’s trying to disguise her tears, but a little sob comes out anyway. “I’m sorry,” he starts, “I didn’t mean--”</p><p>“Artemis?” A knock on the door startles them both. It's their father's voice. “Are you with your brother? I have the potion for your hair.”</p><p>She turns towards the door, refusing to face Theseus. “Yes,” she says, her voice thick and small. As the door opens, she orients herself away from her brother so she won’t have to meet his eyes. </p><p>Their father bends down to stand in the doorway, a sad smile on his face. In his hand, he’s got a vial of green liquid. He gestures to Artemis gently, who trudges towards him without another word. </p><p>Theseus wants to apologize, but they close the door before he can find the words, leaving him in an empty room, not quite sure what to do to make things right.</p>
