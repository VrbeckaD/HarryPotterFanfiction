  <span>The halls of the ministry were literally teeming with life. Witches, wizards, house elves, and other magical beings crowded around to try and catch a glimpse of the proceedings, but the court was already emptying out. Hermione Granger could barely contain the grin that overtook her face. After over two years of working so hard on her house elves bill, or ‘Dobby’s Law’ as it was known around the ministry, it had finally passed. All house elves were officially free and must be paid fair wages for their services. There were other provisions, of course, but these were the most important. She felt a weight roll off her shoulders knowing that the blood, sweat, and tears she had poured into the last few years had not been in vain. With any luck, in another year or so, she might even be able to move out of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she dodged the couple reporters gathered around to ask questions, she spotted Harry out of the corner of her eye. “Harry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, congratulations!” He swooped her into a fierce hug. “I knew they’d pass it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> confident, but couldn't help being nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I knew you’d be brilliant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled at her best friend as he hooked his arm through hers and led her down the corridor, away from the melee behind them. “Anything exciting going on in the Auror department?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides rounding up the last of the rogue Death Eaters? Not really. Want to grab some lunch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That sounds lovely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they walked, they nearly ran right into Draco Malfoy. He stopped at the same time they did, narrowly missing Hermione’s shoulder. His eyes ran over her appraisingly over her before he muttered, “I hear congratulations are in order, Granger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taken aback by his addressing her, she quipped, “News travels fast, does it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He merely smirked and continued on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once he was out of earshot, Hermione looked at Harry. “How do you stand working with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugged. “Malfoy’s not so bad, actually. Keeps to himself most of the time. Hell of an Auror, though. He’s been responsible for bringing in most of the Death Eaters we’ve put away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione seemed surprised. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really. Earned himself a bit of a reputation around the office.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s not like he had a choice.” Malfoy had been given probation after the war, a set of restrictions he had to follow lest he fancy a stint in Azkaban. One of those was that he owed a minimum of five years in ministry employment. They had chosen him to help hunt down his former associates as a sort of penance, she supposed. Four years in and he was still going strong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but he didn’t have to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span> at it,” Harry offered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The subject was dropped as they had a leisurely lunch, catching up on each other’s lives. Harry and Ginny were expecting their first baby, so her friend had lots of news to share. When he finally wound down from all the baby talk, she saw an opening to ask the dreaded question. “How’s Ron?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been two years since Ron decided ministry work just wasn’t for him and left to help George with the shop. And over a year had passed since they had called it quits on their relationship. “He’s good. Happy. Seeing someone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? That’s good. Good for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled awkwardly as he sipped his drink. “How about you? Any prospects?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me? No. I’ve been so busy getting this bill passed, I haven’t even thought about dating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “I’m sure you’ll meet someone eventually.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled. She really hadn’t been thinking about it much. Her flat was the perfect size for her and Crookshanks, and even though he was getting older, he still had a few good years left in him. She supposed she might get lonely once he passed, but she was perfectly fine being on her own. She spent her Friday nights curled up with a good book in her comfy chair—and that suited her just fine.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were a stack of new cases waiting on Hermione’s desk when she got in on Monday. Apparently, there was never a shortage of work when it came to magical beings. However, seeing as she was currently the department’s golden girl, she would get her pick of the interesting stuff first. She made herself a cup of tea and started to shuffle through the files. She had just stacked them in piles relative to their level of interest when a knock at her door made her jump slightly. Visitors were a bit of a rare occurrence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, congratulations on ‘Dobby’s Law.’ Mind if I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rolf! Thank you. Of course, come in!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolf Scamander came in and sat himself down in the seat opposite Hermione’s desk. Following in his grandfather Newt’s footsteps, Rolf was a magizoologist and often consulted on cases for the DRCMC. His leg twitched nervously and he straightened his lanky form in the chair so he wasn’t hunched over. Hermione had seen some pictures of Newt in his youth and felt confident saying that Rolf was nearly a carbon copy of the famous Hufflepuff.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So how can I help you, Rolf? We didn’t have a meeting scheduled for anytime soon, did we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. No, we didn’t. I’m afraid I come asking for your assistance, Hermione. You see, I had the good fortune of rehabilitating a selkie recently, and I found out during the process that she was pregnant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s wonderful!” Hermione exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolf’s watery blue eyes looked up at her, a slight smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “It was. But then, the child was born and while we were doing our best to care for it, Luna and I, last night he was stolen! The mother is inconsolable. Luna is watching after her now, but we have no idea who took the selkie child or why, or where they could be.” He started to sniff and pulled a tissue from his pocket to blow his nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who would do such a thing?” Hermione was indignant. Rolf and Luna did such important work for magical creatures; she couldn’t imagine the kind of person who would kidnap a baby selkie right out from under them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. That’s why I’ve come to you. I was hoping you’d be able to help track him down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mouth opened, then closed. “Certainly. I will have to talk to my boss, but we should be able to make this a top priority.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, thank you so much. I’d really appreciate anything you can do.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione had only seen Luna Lovegood once since the end of the war. It was normally Rolf that she dealt with, although both of them were in the same field of study. She had always liked Luna, and Harry had been close with her, but something about the woman had always been a little off-putting to Hermione. Now, however, the petite blonde came at her with arms wide open. She was wearing lilac robes and her long hair was done back in a braid. “Hermione, thank you so much for coming,” she said enveloped her in a hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. It’s good to see you, Luna, though I wish it were under better circumstances.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Us, too. Rolf has been quite distraught. As has the selkie mother. I had to administer a sedative so she could get some rest.” She batted the air near Hermione’s ear. “Sorry, wrackspurts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione noticed Rolf roll his eyes at his partner’s antics as they walked the grounds. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He must really love Luna</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she surmised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolf brought them to the edge of a vast lake. “This is the facility where we had been keeping them. This whole estate was my grandfather’s, but after he turned one hundred he entrusted its care to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stone construction was built so that it had a large deck jutting out over the water and there was even more to the structure underneath the surface. It seemed someone had paid a lot of attention to detail when building this place, as it was suited perfectly for the care of magical creatures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, I don’t speak selkie—but does the mother remember anything about the assailant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolf frowned and shook his head. “She remembers it was a man, but he charmed her so fast she didn’t have a chance to get a good look, unfortunately.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Hermione said as she looked around. There were a couple of items that had been knocked over in the area immediately adjacent to the water, but nothing else looked amiss. Whoever had been here, had slipped in and out. They must have planned to take the selkie as quickly as possible. “Rolf, who knew that you had obtained the selkie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been trying to wrack my brain to think of that very thing. I’m not a secretive person, you know. Someone could’ve heard me discussing it in Diagon Alley, for all I know. I never would have imagined someone would trespass to kidnap a selkie from right under our noses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right. Well, if you hear anything else or remember anything, please let me know. I’m going to do some research of my own, put some feelers out to see what I can find.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she got home that evening, Hermione gave Crookshanks a quick pat on the head before diving right into her research. She didn’t want to wait until she got back to the office. She tried all her texts, but she couldn’t find anything describing what kind of value a selkie might have on the black market. They didn’t have magical tears or venom, their voices didn’t carry any powers, and none of their organic matter had any healing properties. It just didn’t make sense. </span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Much to Hermione’s dismay, several days passed with no word from Rolf or Luna. She was beginning to think the poor selkie was gone forever. She was sipping her tea, going through case files, when her office door creaked open. Her boss, Cybele Jones, walked in and handed her a new file. “Whatever else you were working on, Miss Granger, this takes top priority.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” she answered, taking the file from her boss. When she flipped it open she saw a picture of a man she never thought she’d see again; he was flashing a shady grin for the camera that would harden into a scowl before starting over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mundungus Fletcher. I believe you’re familiar?” Cybele sat in the seat opposite Hermione’s desk, crossing her long legs in front of her. Her creamy beige robes accentuated her bronze skin and her gold bangles clacked against the wood of the chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I thought he’d gone underground after the war.” Hermione flipped through the file, thick with proof that the wizard had not just faded silently into the background after the events several years ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, in a sense, he did. Back to his less honest dealings, anyway. I understand you had been working with Rolf Scamander regarding a kidnapped selkie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Do you think Fletcher had something to do with it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was spotted using an international portkey with a fair bit of cargo, yesterday. A witness said it looked like he had some kind of tank in his possession. We think this could possibly be for transporting the selkie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“International? Where was he headed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Based on the portkey used, New York City.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nearly dropped her tea. Why would Mundungus Fletcher be transporting a baby selkie to the United States? “But… why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what we want you to find out. As you know, selkies are not particularly valuable on the black market, but things could be different across the pond. The American wizarding world is quite a different landscape, and things could get dangerous. That’s why an Auror is being assigned to go with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>An Auror? Was that really necessary?</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Oh, okay. Do you know which one?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not yet. I understand they’re looking at who’s available at the moment. You should know by end of day, and then you’ll depart tomorrow. We need to figure out why a British wizard would be smuggling magical creatures into the US.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>As it turned out, Hermione never received a memo that day. She went home to pack anxiously wondering who they’d assign to her case. Selfishly, she hoped for Harry; but he was quite in demand these days, so she didn’t count on it. Last she heard Dean Thomas was away on assignment and that only left one other Auror she was actually familiar with. Surely they wouldn’t assign </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet, as she made her way to her office that morning, her charmed rolling suitcase in tow, there was the familiar blonde figure dressed all in black casually leaning against her door. “Granger,” he greeted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” she responded, bumping his shoulder as she grazed past him to enter her office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks like I’m headed to New York with you.” He followed her in a little too closely so when she stopped short he bumped into her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, she pivoted and placed a hand on his chest to steady herself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hmm, firm</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She cleared her throat before removing her hand. “Really? They couldn’t find </span>
  <em>
    <span>anyone</span>
  </em>
  <span> else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As flattered as I am by your enthusiasm, no. Potter’s on assignment, and so are Thomas, Johnson, and Billiwig. They’re not going to send any upper tier people on an mission that basically amounts to being your bodyguard. So the joys of watching your back fall to me, unfortunately.” He smirked and she felt the sudden urge to smack him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m perfectly capable of handling myself.” She moved to gather the rest of the items she might need.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m well aware of that. In fact it’s one of the reasons I agreed to go—I figured this will be a bit of a break for me.” He crooked an eyebrow as if daring her to disagree with him. After all, he did have a stellar record when it came to tracking down dark wizards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well… I suppose if we can remain civil to each other than this won’t be so bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fixed her with a gaze that sent a shiver down her spine. “I’m willing to play nice if you are, Granger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is going to be sheer hell</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Hermione thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco watched her leave, following at a safer distance this time. Of all the assignments, he had never considered himself being sent to accompany Hermione Granger on a trip to the ‘States. After tracking dark wizards for the past few years, it was definitely going to be a bit of a respite. Not only that, he had to admit Granger had only grown more beautiful in the time since they left Hogwarts. He had always had a morbid fascination with the muggleborn who was consistently outperforming him, but he was rather loathe to admit that somewhere along the way that fascination had turned into attraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, as he watched the sway of her hips and the outline of her perfect arse in those damn muggle jeans, he realized he was actually looking forward to this case. A few days in a new location with a mildly frustrated Granger could be just what he needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were using one of the ministry’s alloted international portkeys to travel straight to New York so they were dressed to blend in. Draco wore a suit—after all, he was still a Malfoy—but had foregone the traditional robes. Apparently Hermione was opting to go all out muggle: pairing a tight pair of jeans with a white blouse and black blazer. Along with her short stacked heel boots, he had to confess she looked downright edible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that all you’re bringing?” Her shrill tone jarred him right out of his lustful reverie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held up his small bag. “Think you’re the only one who knows about extendable charms?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flushed slightly before responding. “I guess not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lovely pink color was slow to leave her cheeks, and he hoped he’d have the chance to make her do that again on this trip.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>The ministry’s American portkey led right to the MACUSA headquarters. More specifically, to their arrivals room, where a special team of junior Aurors waited to pass their wands over them and make sure no contraband entered the states. After the Second Wizarding War, wizards from Europe were especially vetted. Security was stringent, but only for those in official capacities. Wherever Fletcher had entered the country, he was most </span>
  <em>
    <span>certainly</span>
  </em>
  <span> not held to such rigorous procedures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a thorough inspection, they were led to a briefing room by one of the Aurors. The scrawny ginger looked a bit like an American Weasley and casually informed them, “The Chief Auror will be with you momentarily.” Then he left them alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, this is a pleasant welcome,” Draco drawled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, I didn’t know their searching techniques were so barbaric.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He didn’t… touch you, did he?” For some reason, the idea of another wizard putting his grimy American hands all over Granger really irked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked at Malfoy who seemed to be regarding her closely. Why he cared she wasn’t sure but the concern in his eyes couldn’t be faked. “No, not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” he shifted in the metal chair and crossed his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then the door opened and a witch in brilliant, royal blue robes swept in. Her baby pink hair was styled in an elaborate updo and complemented her caramel skin nicely. “Adele Picquery, Chief Auror, MACUSA. Nice to meet you—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione Granger.” She stood up to introduce herself and held out her hand, which Adele shook heartily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>The</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hermione Granger, really? Working for the DRCMC now, after all your heroics in the war… what, didn’t care for the Auror life?” Her smile was friendly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, my interests have always been more academic, sometimes political. Your last name, if you don’t mind my asking—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, the former president was my grandmother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wonderful! I’ve read about her. She did a lot for the protection of magical creatures in the United States.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, big shoes to fill and all that… it’s why I chose law enforcement over politics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of a throat clearing interrupted them. Hermione startled and looked at Malfoy. “Oh right, and this is Draco Malfoy, my Auror escort.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes. I’ve heard of you as well, Mr. Malfoy. The former Death Eater turned Auror. Very fascinating.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well. Go on with any uncomfortable questions you want to ask me,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck idly. It’s not like he hadn’t heard it all before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mistake my meaning,” Adele began. “We have a long history of prejudice here in the US—and not just between the wizarding folk and No-Majs. I think it’s pretty impressive that you’ve been able to throw off the old ways and help track down your former brothers in arms. And, as I understand, you’ve become rather good at it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shrugged. “I was a spoiled rich kid who didn’t know any better. All of us have to learn, some of us choose the hard way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be that as it may, not everyone has a redemption story quite like yours.” She winked and Draco felt a tightening in his chest. It wasn’t often that he received a compliment from someone, and he didn’t know what to do with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Adele asked them a few more questions about their case and the duration of their stay in the city. She offered them access to any resources they might need, all they had to do was come back. As they left the Woolworth building and stepped out into the brisk New York City air, Hermione thought it wasn’t too unlike London, if perhaps a bit dirtier and more crowded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked down Broadway towards Chambers Street and took in the sights. There were lots of muggles on their lunch breaks, grabbing hot dogs from sidewalk carts and paying with the odd green American muggle money. Tourists with large cameras also milled about, and as Hermione listened, she could hear many different languages being spoken. A true melting pot,  just as she’d read.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A bit busy, isn’t it?” Malfoy said, next to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it is rather chaotic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, where are we headed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s near Chinatown so”—she paused, unfurling the map that showed all the wizarding spots in Manhattan—“several blocks northeast of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sighed. “And we can’t apparate?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, there’s too many muggles around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He groaned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the matter, Malfoy? Your aristocratic legs can’t handle that much walking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you calling me lazy, Granger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smirked at him as they passed a man on the corner begging for change. “If the shoe fits…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know my suit hides it well, but I’m actually quite fit underneath all these layers. I’m just annoyed we can’t use magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unbidden, Hermione felt her cheeks flush slightly. It’s not like she hadn’t noticed how attractive he was. She usually tried to ignore it, but he did look damn good in his suit. She’d already watched several women check him out as they walked along. “Yes, well, you know the statute of secrecy is taken even more strongly over here. It’s been less than forty years since they started letting wizards and muggles intermarry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I know,” he drawled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shot him a surprised look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes. “I do read, Granger.” He guessed he shouldn’t be surprised when she assumed his ignorance on certain subjects—her closest male friends were Potter and Weasley, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, of course. I didn’t mean—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Save it. I know you’re used to being the smartest person in the room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione opened her mouth to reply, but then thought better of it. Just a couple more blocks to go anyway. She didn’t want to keep inadvertently insulting Malfoy. It seemed like he was trying to be agreeable and for that, she was thankful.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think the entrance should be somewhere around here,” Hermione said, looking at the map as they approached Canal Street. There were so many little shops and storefronts, it was hard to tell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco lightly touched her arm, causing her to look up from the map. “Look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The souvenir shop in front of them had a dragon on it’s awning that was very casually moving. He would look down to the shop below then blow a small plume of fire. A small woman tending the shop held out her hand in welcome. “You looking for a little magic? Right this way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked at each other briefly, grinning, and stepped inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Brighter and more colorful than Diagon Alley, the wizarding section of Chinatown was bursting with people. Witches and wizards overflowed from the tiny shops selling an assortment of potions, supplies, and other magical items. They made their way down a cobblestone street, not unlike home, as they searched for their hotel. The Golden Gong boasted a tavern and gift shop on the first floor, and nine floors of rooms above. An elderly wizard with a long mustache greeted them from the front vestibule. “How may I help you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Granger and Malfoy, checking in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I have you right here.” He looked at the big leather bound book in front of him. “Here is your room key.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco leaned over the counter. “No, there should be two rooms. You don’t have two rooms listed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old man peered at them over his spectacles. “Sorry, sir. I have Granger and Malfoy, one room. It’s right here.” He picked up the book to show them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unbelievable,” Draco huffed, turning around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine Malfoy, we’ll just get an additional room.” Hermione shot the man an apologetic look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry. Can’t do that. We’re completely full.” He took off the spectacles, breathing on them and wiping them off on his robes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look—” Draco began.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thaddeus,” the older wizard supplied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thaddeus. My associate and I have traveled from London for a very dangerous assignment. Are you absolutely sure you don’t have an extra room?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope. ‘fraid not. You’re more than welcome to try another establishment, but I think you’ll find that places in the city fill up fast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We understand. This is fine. Thank you.” Hermione took the key from Thaddeus, grabbed Draco’s arm and headed for the lift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What</span>
  </em>
  <span>—did you do that for?” Draco looked at her sharply once they were inside the lift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There was no use arguing with him, Malfoy. Honestly. Besides, this is the best location for our stay. Fireplaces are limited here, so Floo isn’t going to be an option everywhere and you saw how many muggles there are in this city.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we have to share a room for a few days. How bad can it be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Very bad</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco thought as he stared at the lone bed in the center of the room. There was only one bed, and it wasn’t even a king size—more like a generous double. “There’s only one bed, Granger. What do you say now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her cheeks went slightly pink in that way that he was already starting to enjoy so much. She looked around for a sofa, but the only other furniture present was a table, two chairs, and an armoire. It was worse than the Leaky Cauldron. “We are both adults. I’m sure we can come to an arrangement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He cocked an eyebrow at her. “Are you meaning to suggest we actually share the bed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m not sleeping on the floor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Neither am I!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then it’s settled. We will both sleep in the bed and not make a big deal of it, like the rational human beings that we are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine.” Draco sat his bag on the table, folding himself into one of the chairs and running a hand through his hair. He was pretty sure it would </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> be fine.</span>
