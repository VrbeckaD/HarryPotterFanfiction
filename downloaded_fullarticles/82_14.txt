          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny was tired. She wanted to close her eyes and sleep, but every time she’d tried the past week, since getting out of the infirmary, she’d heard his voice. The one she first heard when he was trying to kill her.</p>
<p>
  <i>I’ll always be with you, Ginny. You’re mine.</i>
</p>
<p>Before, that had seemed a comforting promise. Exactly what she’d needed to hear, alone and afraid and in need of love. Now it felt like a threat she’d never escape. He’d be with her forever, haunting her dreams.</p>
<p>She hated that she was almost glad. She hated that she missed him.</p></div>
