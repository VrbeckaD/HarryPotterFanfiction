  <span>He was talking to a group of new associates when she came, wearing a black velvet evening gown that was both conservative and fashionable. Unlike the gaggle of ladies in the ballroom, Hermione didn't wear jewellery or flashy sequins in her dress; in lieu of it, she had a tastefully stitched lion in front of her gown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was bold yet conservative and very much like </span>
  <em>
    <span>her. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Beautiful in it’s simplicity, bold in it’s declarations.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He felt like a weight had been lifted of his chest, like an oppressive cloud had cleared and he was finally free from the darkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be honest, he hadn’t really been sure she would come. He hadn’t seen her in years, and she had a history of snubbing and ignoring him out of spite, which was terribly inconvenient at times, but that did not mean that he did not hold out hope.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What was it that the old goat said again?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hope is such a fickle sentiment, Tom. You must only hold it out for what you deem most special and true.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While he didn’t believe in most of the senile old man’s white washed ideologies, he could sometimes hear truth in his ramblings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom was special, a genius, charismatic and the </span>
  <em>
    <span>darling </span>
  </em>
  <span>of little hangleton.  His attention should only ever be held by whom he deemed worthy and </span>
  <em>
    <span>special</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And Hermione Granger, his ex-girlfriend and notorious contract killer, fit the bill </span>
  <em>
    <span>perfectly.</span>
  </em>

    <span>December 18, 1924 11:37 AM</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first time he saw her was in a library. And not just any library, mind you, but the esteemed and revered Hogwarts library. It was his sanctuary, his safe haven from the blithering buffoons he had to deal with on a daily basis. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He went on a Tuesday, when he knew fewer people usually came and researched. He had been following that schedule for years now, and it had never failed him before. Almost no one ever came on Tuesdays.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which is why he was surprised when he bumped with a red-haired man exiting the premises, knocking the precious scrolls and books he was returning for Headmaster Dippet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, mate! I was in a hurry and I didn’t see you there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He curled his lip in disdain at the freckled-faced imbecile. “Please, watch where you're going next time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man then, attempted to to pick up the scrolls and books, before Tom promptly swatted the hands away upon seeing the sweat that nearly drenched his hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please refrain from touching me </span>
  <em>
    <span>or </span>
  </em>
  <span>the scrolls and books, they’re sensitive and cannot be exposed to </span>
  <em>
    <span>sweaty hands. </span>
  </em>
  <span>You’ve nearly ruined them with your carelessness.”  He sneered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no reason to be polite to </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>man, judging by the uniform, he was nothing but a measly janitor for the college. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dippet must have hired him recently.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m really sorry, mate. I didn’t mean to.” The janitor said, scratching the back of his neck. And Tom might have believed him, if it weren’t for his brilliant penchant for catching </span>
  <em>
    <span>liars.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look,” He searched for the engraved name tag usually given to staff, it read </span>
  <em>
    <span>Weasley. “</span>
  </em>
  <span>Mr. Weasley, I have no doubt that you are deeply regretful and apologetic for your rather, </span>
  <em>
    <span>imbecilic </span>
  </em>
  <span>actions, but I </span>
  <em>
    <span>have </span>
  </em>
  <span>to go. Please, stop blocking the entrance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The redhead complied almost immediately, moving from the entrance and away from the Library building with one last rude word:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Prat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom did not feel any inclination whatsoever to retaliate to such a childish remark, retaliating would suggest that he was threatened, which we he most certainly was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He made his way to the entrance, just in time to see Madam Pince leave for her lunch break. When she spotted him, a fond smile bloomed in her taut face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tom, just in time as always.”, She greeted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gave her a charming smile, “Good morning, madam Pince. Headmaster Dippet, sent me to return these books and I figured I’d do it, since it coincides with your lunch break.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped forward and made a move to take the heavy books from his hands, he stepped back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take care of this, Madam Pince. It’s the least I could do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A beaming smile appeared on her face as she pinched his cheeks. “You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>such </span>
  </em>
  <span>a sweet boy.” He fought the urge to push her away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Madam Pince had always treated him like her own son, and while it might have its perks, often times it was plain annoying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed, he had to do this to earn her favour. He would endure her misplaced affection as long as it afforded him a free pass to the restricted section.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Goodness, you look thin! I’ll bring you packed lunch, as soon as I finish my break.” She said with pinched lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It really </span>
  <em>
    <span>would </span>
  </em>
  <span>be necessary, madam—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nonsense! A growing boy needs to eat.” She grabbed her bag and went for the exit, “I’m off to the cafeteria, now. Take care of the library whilst I’m gone!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shook his head, expasrated . When did she become such a mother hen? Did he somehow encourage her? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t want to dwell on it, choosing instead to grab a trolley from the rack and putting the books and scrolls there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He idly pushed the trolley around the library, humming a tune and putting the books in their respective places.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Medicine, Herbology, Philosophy, More philosophy,</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When he was at his last stop, which was Greek and Roman philosophies, he stopped. A bushy-haired, trouser-wearing </span>
  <em>
    <span>girl</span>
  </em>
  <span> was in the section . He had never seen her before, therefore assuming that she was new, still his surprised didn’t wane.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was not often that he saw the fairer sex anywhere near books. Much less reading them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had entertained the idea, that she was here with her husband or fiance and was, wandering aimlessly, attempting to fill her empty brain with legends and stories she couldn’t possibly comprehend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had thought that was the case, but then he caught sight of something. Something peculiar, something that simply did not fit his deduction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as she turned the page of the book, he caught sight of </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Which was why it was all </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrong. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no engagement ring or wedding ring to be seen. No glint of gold or silver that he had been expecting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was unmarried, then. He frowned and looked around, searching for her designated chaperone and once again finding nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Was she here all on her lonesome? He sniffed, how uncouth. She must come from a unrefined family if she couldn’t even bring her own chaperone to protect her honor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While that made her already useless in his mind, it still didn’t answer the question of </span>
  <em>
    <span>why </span>
  </em>
  <span>she was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was a man’s place, there was no place for a woman like—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He curled his lip at the realization. No wedding rings, no chaperones and trousers that any proper lady would know </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>to wear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was a prostitute. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was clever being here in the library, where rich gents often frequented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so, he intervened accordingly. He refused to let her presence stain the sanctity of the his </span>
  <em>
    <span>home.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He approached her with steady steps and a careless air, his gait relaxed and friendly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me miss, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” he ticked off invisible dust in his robes. “Right this instant, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her back was still turned away from him, her stance straightening from the relaxed posture she affected while reading the book. He clenched his fist as she slowly put </span>
  <em>
    <span>Eurydyce: The bargain with Hades </span>
  </em>
  <span>back in the shelves, where they rightly belonged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tapped his foot impatiently. He had no time for dealing with slags.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This place is for students of the Hogwarts College and for dedicated readers </span>
  <em>
    <span>only. It </span>
  </em>
  <span>isn’t a place for someone looking to score and shag someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nearly jumped when she suddenly turned around, staring down at him, looking down at him. He grit his teeth, mentally cursing the orphanage and their “protein mixes”. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t thought she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>tall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked up at her, refusing to be intimidated by her height. She had a small button nose, freckles that surrounded said nose and brown eyes that squinted furiously at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, but do I know you? Have we met before?” Her voice snapped harshly in the silence of the library.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Evidently not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She curled her lips into what she must have consider a disdainful smile. “Then it’s very presumptuous of you to think I’m a slag, now isn’t it? You don’t know me and I don’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> His jaw ticked. Why the bloody dickens would she be here otherwise?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He smiled with false patience. “I’m apologize for the misunderstanding, miss?...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger. Hermione Granger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione..” He nodded his head and paused, tasting her name in his tongue. What an interesting name. “Miss Granger, I’m terribly sorry for my prior rudeness. You can never be too careful nowadays.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her riotous hair seemed to fizzle and grow even bushier at his words and she was flushed like a tart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you implying that I look like a </span>
  <em>
    <span>call girl</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pursed his lips in an innocent manner, lowering his head sheepishly. “I didn’t mean to insinuate anything by it, madam. I apologize if I have, yet again offended you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She narrowed her eyes at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed, not faking it this time. “Why don’t we start again, miss Granger. My name is Tom Riddle, head boy of Hogwarts College.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He caught her eyes widen imperceptibly before she quickly tamped it down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “Fine. My name is Hermione Granger, transfer student of Hogwarts college.” His eyebrows rose at its own accord. She offered her hand automatically, as if she had done this a dozen times over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘Perhaps, she might have some manners after all’, he thought snidely as he pressed a chaste kiss to the back of her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Forgive me if I’m skeptical, Miss Granger, but I didn’t know Hogwarts had a transfers program, let alone for a… lady of high esteem such as yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was well aware that he was laying it on a bit thick and, judging by the sharp glint of her eyes, she knew it too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone at Hogwarts had known each other their entire lives, they had all been there since they were doe-eyed eleven year olds, transfer students were basically unheard of in the prestigious school. Women too, were rare. Tom could count with one hand, the number of opposite sex that resided and studied at Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, Riddle, whatever game you want to play, don’t play it with me. I have better things to do and I reckon with a name like yours, you have better things to do too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes widened, she couldn't possibly know. He had worked hard, exploiting his followers connections just to bury his past.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Word runs fast in Little Hangleton, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He froze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was looking at him with a coy smile, on her lips, looking as if she had just won the lottery. He looked around the library and deduced that no one was with them at this moment, Madam Pince was at her lunch break, which gave him approximately one hour. He could easily push her up the shelf. While she most certainly had the height advantage, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> had a pocket knife in his calf, he could grab it and—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A swift kick in the gut cut him of mid-thought. It knocked him off breathless, He coughed, the pain in his abdomen blurring his senses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom saw red. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How dare she? How dare she punch the Heir of Slytherin?  </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He acted, standing up and snatching the knife from his calf. Her eyes widened. He grinned smugly, circling her like a predator would prey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scrambled back, her light chestnut hair freeing from her constricting bun. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what you are, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Riddle.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> She spat, “I know what you and your little gang did at Riddle Manor, and mark my words, you will </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>get away with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something passed between them, a fleeting mix of fear and excitement wrapped in a leather and wood. He feels it, the tension in the air, the coarse and bitter taste of hatred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And suddenly it clicked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shooting. Family. Screams. Neighbours. Kill.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Tom, please… I’m your fath—</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Kill all of them. Don’t leave any witnesses.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Spare my daugh—</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Shite, Tom, she escaped.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger...” He shook his head, his eyebrows scrunching in disbelief. “You’re the neighbours daughter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he can see she’s befuddled, her eyes wide and lips parted in shock. Befuddled that </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>can remember her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She looks pretty when she’s surprised</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he decided in that minute. </span>
  <em>
    <span>A shame, that I’ll have to take advantage of it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could so much as utter a word, he brings the knife to two inches from his head and aimed for her foot. Not lethal, but enough to incapacitate for further interrogation. As he was about to plunge the knife he was caught off guard by her strangely determined expression, as if she had known this would happen. He shrugged it off and threw the knife, hitting precisely her </span>
  <em>
    <span>Medial Plantar</span>
  </em>
  <span> artery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The blood oozed and dribbled as she whimpered. He stared, fixated at her undulating wound, half- aware of her pathetic whimpers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was beautiful.</span>
  </em>
