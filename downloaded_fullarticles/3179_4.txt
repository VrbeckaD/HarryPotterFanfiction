    <p>In many ways Hermione did not mind being Mrs Potter-Black.  Harry was her best friend and she found him adequate in bed.  She prized the access to the Potter and Black Family Libraries and Grimoire's and she spent most of her time in them researches old spells and finding hew uses for them as well as altering them to more fit her ideals.  In the two years she had been married to Harry she had developed several spells, including the newest one that would spice up her sex life.</p><p>Hermione found out as she grew older that she had developed many sexual kinks that she had to keep hidden as Wizarding society was very puritanical.  She had thought Harry was unaffected by this but she found out that the Weasley's had done a good job of turning him into a sexual puritan.  It was because of that that Hermione created her latest spell.  It allowed her to enchant a pair of reading glasses that she had gotten in a failed attempt to entice Harry with the 'Hot Librarian' look.  This spell had two main functions.  The first was that it allowed her to find out any and all kinks of the person she is looking at.  The second function was a variation of an item created by WWW and it allowed her to see through peoples clothes, an aspect of the spell that she had vigorously tested in Muggle gym she had attended in London.</p><p>With the spell finally complete she placed the final enchant on her reading glasses.  Hermione then went to check on Harry and found him asleep in front of the TV that she had enchanted for him.  Looking at Harry her worst fears were confirmed.  It showed that he was pretty much vanilla although he was submissive, something she had found out to a degree in the past.  She wanted a man who was more take control and who could make her let go.  The only surprise she saw was that he had a slight bi-sexual tendency, although from her reading she found that being slightly bi-sexual was not out of the norm.</p><p>The next day Hermione wore the glasses as she walked around Diagon Alley and the Ministry when she went to meet her husband.  She was a bit shocked at finding out that harry who was all of six inches was rather on the large end for Wizards and the average cock size seemed to be in the four to five inch range.  On the other hand she also saw that harry was pretty average in his sexual proclivities as it seems that all the Wizards and Witches were pretty puritanical in their sexual desires, even those who she knew were muggleborn.  Sadly, Hermione figured that Harry was about as good as it got in the Wizarding world.</p><p>While Hermione lay in bed with Harry after a night of OK sex Hermione received an inspirational idea on how to improve her sex life.  With Harry being a closeted submissive with bi-sexual tendencies Hermione figured that she could use those qualities of Harry to better her sex life.  So over the course of the next few months Hermione subtly trained Harry to be more submissive towards her desires and even had him watch a few porn videos with her where the 'husband' was OK with being cucked by the 'Wife' and with the later videos showing the 'husband' engaging in sex with other male.  Over time Hermione saw a change in attitude from Harry.  At first Harry was repulsed by the video's, but overtime as he saw that Hermione liked them he decided to just enjoy them for the porn they were.  Over the course of months though Harry had become so accustomed to watching cuck porn that when given the choice of what type to watch he would always choose cuck porn.  </p><p>As Summer was coming up Hermione saw that her plan was coming to fruition and he knew Harry was ready to go along with it.  Looking over Harry with her enchanted glasses Hermione saw that Harry had a more strongly pronounced submissiveness and bi-sexual tendencies.  She also saw that he now had strong Cuckolding fantasies as well.  Seeing that Hermione worked on restoring the Potter Villa in Monaco, near where she used to go as a teen with her parents.  She could not wait for Harry's vacation which was a few weeks away.</p><p>Walking up to Harry as he was sitting eating breakfast at the table Hermione stated, "Harry, I set up your vacation this year for us as you always forget about it.  So starting next week we are going to spend a month at your families Villa in Monaco."  Seeing Harry's startled look, "Honestly Harry, if I did not set up this vacation for you you would be spending all your time at work."</p><p>Not wanting to upset Hermione any, Harry replied, "Of course honey, it would be great to spend some time with just the two of us on the beach."</p><p>"Don't worry about anything Harry," Hermione replied, "I will take care of getting everything set up as well as getting out clothes and swimwear."</p><p>"Thanks Hermione, you know how much I work I have to do before I can go so this is very helpful." Harry replied with a relieved look at Hermione, glad that she has everything covered as usual.  Hermione looked at Harry with an internally sly smile, "I might be gone for parts of the rest of the week as I get everything set up.  Getting Villa Potter up to standards might take a bit of effort but by the time we get there it will be up to my standards."</p><p>"Good, good," Harry replied as he got up to go into work, "Have a fun time Hermione.  I will see you when we both get back."  With that Harry gave Hermione a quick kiss on her lips and left for work, missing the wicked glean in Hermione's eyes.</p><p>Hermione then floo'd over to Villa Potter and over the next week got it up to her standards as well as preparing it for the upcoming vacation.  Every night Hermione returned home to spend time with Harry and to make sure that he did not get bogged down by work and try to call the vacation off.  </p><p>Hermione was glad when Friday finally arrived and Harry arrived home from work.  Everything was ready for them to start off early tomorrow on the adventure that she had set up for them in Monaco.  Early in the morning Hermione leaned over and kissed Harry awake.  "Time to get up Harry, I want to leave as soon as possible to avoid any last minute trouble from your work."  Seeing that Harry was getting up Hermione went and quickly got herself ready.  Before to long Harry was ready as well and the pair left for their vacation.</p><p>Once they arrived Hermione showed Harry the outfit that she had picked out for him to wear, a set of swim trunks and a light shirt to wear.  As he was changing into his outfit harry looked over at Hermione's outfit and was surprised by how little there was of it.  It consisted of a top that barely covered her nipples and a thong bottom that showed off her bountiful ass.  Harry stared at Hermione as she finished dressing up with only a near sheer sarong that did little to cover her ass and nothing else. "It that all you are going to wear Hermione?" Harry remarked, "It's a little revealing isn't it?"</p><p>Hermione gave a light laugh, "Harry, we are in Monaco, if anything I am overdressed."  And with that Hermione lead Harry out of the Villa.  Hermione looked around and told Harry, "I personally picked out a tour guide to show us around town.  His family is originally from Africa, Ethiopia to be exact but they have lived here for a while, his names Yohannas and he came highly recommended from the people I asked.  He is also discreet and in the know from what I have been told so we should have no problem using magic if needed."</p><p>Hermione looked around to see if she could find Yohannas as he was supposed to arrive around this time.  At the appointed time she saw him and waved him over, once he approached she told Harry, "Harry this is Yohannas the guide I was telling you about, Yohannas this is my husband Harry.  We are in your hands for this vacation."  With that Hermione gave him a quick hug kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Harry was startles by Yohannas's look.  Yeah he was expecting a black man but not this.  Yohannas was maybe four to six inches taller that he was and he was strongly built.  Not overly exaggerated like a weightlifter would look like but with the strong muscles of a runner or swimmer.  All that was something he was used to from seeing his Quidditch teammates who were rather built as well.  What really caught his attention was how dark skinned he was.  Harry had seen black men and women before but Yohannas but Angelina or Dean to shame with how dark his skin was reminding Harry of the color of ebony.  Watching Hermione hug him the contrast between her pale white skin and Yohannas's ebony skin was extremely noticeable.  Harry approached Yohannas and stated "From what my wife tells me we will be in your care for this vacation.  I'm Harry and its good to meet you."  With that Harry shook hands with his guide.</p><p>For the next several hours Yohannas showed Harry and Hermione around the beachfront portion of the Monaco.  Harry noticed that while Hermione was getting looks for how she was dressed, it was more in appreciation than in the looks condemning her for being dressed the way they were.  Hell during their walks along some portions of the beach many of the women were wearing even less than she was as they were going completely topless.</p><p>After wandering around town for the half the day Hermione turns to Harry and informs him "Harry, I set up a special lunch for us at the Villa as well as some after lunch entertainment.  I am sure that you will enjoy it."  With that Hermione lead the way home with Harry and Yohannas following behind him.</p><p>Once the arrived home Hermione turned to Harry, "Head on to the dining room, I had Winky set us up a special lunch.  I will join you in a bit, I just need to organize things with Yohannas for later."  </p><p>Hermione watched as Harry headed off to the dining room and then turned to Yohannas.  "Alright Yohannas, I need you to get everything ready as we had discussed earlier.  I want to make this perfect."</p><p>"Everything is pretty much ready already, but I will double check that everything is set up per your request," Yohannas replied.</p><p>Hermione nodded at Yohannas on hearing his reply, "Alright, I will leave you to it."  With that Hermione headed off to the Dining Room to join Harry for lunch.</p><p>When Hermione arrived at the Dining Room she saw Harry was already seating and waiting for her to arrive before he started his meal.  "Eat up Harry, we are going to need a lot of energy for the after Lunch activities that I have planned."</p><p>Harry looked over at his wife and asked, "And what are we going to be doing?"</p><p>"Now that's a surprise dearest," Hermione replied, "Just know that I think it will be something that we will both enjoy and have fond memories of in the future.  "After thinking about it some more Hermione continued, "I think we might enjoy it so much that we might just have to make it a staple in our lives, and maybe introduce it to some of our friends.  I can think of several of our classmates who would come to love it as much as I know we will."</p><p>Harry took in what Hermione told him, "I don't doubt your belief at all as your ideas always seem to work out in the end, even when I had problems with it before you talked me into going along with it,"  At that Harry blushed lightly as he remembered some of Hermione's more out there sexual ideas.</p><p>Harry and Hermione traded small talk for the next while as they ate their lunch.  When they both finished up Hermione got up and gheld out a hand to Harry, "Come with me Harry, the adventure I created for you awaits us."  As Harry gently grasped her hands Hermione pulled him along to her goal.</p><p>Harry followed along behind Hermione, wondering where she was taking him,  He already knew that they were not leaving the house as they were heading away from the front door.  When Hermione stopped in front of a closed door he saw how nervous Hermione appeared to be.  "So the surprise is inside Hermione?" Harry asked her, "I am sure that I will love it, just as I have come to love all the ideas you have come up with."</p><p>Hearing Harry's reassuring words a much less nervous Hermione opened the door for their next big adventure.</p>
