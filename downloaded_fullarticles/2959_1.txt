          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco: Any moment now, professor.</p><p>Believe me, I know<br/>
I've sunk pretty low<br/>
But whatever I've done you deserved </p><p>Dumbledore: Draco...</p><p>Draco: Quiet!<br/>
I'm the bad guy, that's fine<br/>
It's no fault of mine<br/>
And some justice at last will be served</p><p>Dumbledore: Please, listen!</p><p>Draco: Now it's time to step up<br/>
Or it's time to back down<br/>
And there's only one answer for me<br/>
And I'll stand up and fight<br/>
'Cause I know that I'm right<br/>
And I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Ready as I'll ever be</p><p>Ron: Harry, are you sure you're up for this?</p><p>Harry: Actually, I don't think I am. I'll only slow you down.</p><p>Hermione: But how are you gonna lead the assault?</p><p>Harry: I'm not. he is.</p><p>Â </p><p>Neville:<br/>
Now it's time to rise up<br/>
Or it's time to stand down<br/>
And the answer is easy to see<br/>
And I swear by this sword<br/>
(pulls the gryffindors sword out of the hat)<br/>
If you're in, get on board<br/>
Are you ready?</p><p>Ron:<br/>
I'm ready</p><p>Hermione &amp; Ron:<br/>
We're ready</p><p>Crowd:<br/>
We're ready</p><p>Neville:<br/>
Ready as I'll ever be</p><p>Luna: There you are!</p><p>Lupin: Yes, yes. I just had to make a stop in the room of requirements. I'm told you're pretty handy with this.<br/>
(hands luna her wand, which she lost earlier and he found) </p><p>Luna: Heehee...I sure am.</p><p>Lupin:<br/>
Are you quite sure we can do this?<br/>
Luna:<br/>
Together we will, guarantee...</p><p>draco:<br/>
I'll make them hear me<br/>
Crowd: Now it's time to redeem<br/>
Or it's time to resolve</p><p>Neville:<br/>
Prove they can trust me</p><p>Crowd:<br/>
And the outcome will hardly come free</p><p>Luna:<br/>
I'll save my home and family</p><p>Crowd:<br/>
Now the line's in the sand<br/>
And our moment's at hand</p><p>Ron:<br/>
And I'm ready</p><p>Neville:<br/>
I'm ready</p><p>Luna &amp; Lupin:<br/>
I'm ready</p><p>Draco:<br/>
Ready as I'll ever be...</p></div>
