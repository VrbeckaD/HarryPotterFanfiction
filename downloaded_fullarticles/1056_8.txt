          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">There were eyes everywhere, in Grimmauld Place.</p><p class="p1">Father always knew when you were kicking your feet under the dinner table, even if he looked like he was reading the newspaper. Sirius thought that Father’s eyes could see through wood - an idea that was terrible enough - but Regulus suspected that he was a more powerful Legilimens than anyone in the family realised, which was infinitely <em>more </em>terrifying.</p><p class="p1">Mother knew almost everything that happened under her roof, and if she didn’t, Kreacher or the portraits would tell her.</p><p class="p1">Kreacher skulked about from room to room, hiding in shadowy corners or else Apparating silently to surprise you when you least expected it. Regulus was kind to him, and the house-elf was kind in return, but there was no escape from the portraits.</p><p class="p1">They lined the walls of every room - even the <em>bathrooms</em>, to Regulus’s eternal horror - and whispered to each other as you walked past. They would flit between the frames, trading gossip about what the youngest of the Blacks were doing wrong these days, boasting about what better children <em>they </em>had been, complaining that Mother and Father were not doing enough to discipline their errant sons.</p><p class="p1">There was one place where the portraits and Kreacher and Mother and Father couldn’t reach them, and that was the rooftop. A small, flat space of roof that lay between Regulus and Sirius’s bedrooms on the top floor of the townhouse, with loose tiles that were perfect for hiding contraband (Sirius’s) and secret messages (Regulus’s).</p><p class="p1">But even here the brothers were still under observation because at night - and sometimes even in the daytime - the stars shone brightly, persevering through London’s grey clouds and hazy light. And for a Black, the stars were not always a source of comfort. For a Black, every star and constellation was an ancestor. A previous Black who had behaved better, achieved more, <em>shone more brightly</em> than either of them could ever hope to do.</p><p class="p1">Every star was a reminder that they were being watched, and being judged.</p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
