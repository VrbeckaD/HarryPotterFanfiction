<p>Being Studious</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“I’m off to the library,” said Ron. </p>
<p>Both Harry and Hermione looked shocked. Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “Since when have you been studious?” </p>
<p>“Since I decided to become a Healer,” Ron shot back. “I need better grades.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Good luck, mate.” </p>
<p>“Thanks.” Ron started for the door. “I’ll need it.” </p>
<p>Getting into the Restricted Section took ages. Huffing, Ron hissed, “Pansy?” as he prowled the stacks. </p>
<p>“Here.” </p>
<p>Rounding the corner, Ron froze. She was up on a table, legs spread obscenely, her fingers sliding in and out of her cunt. Ron exhaled shakily. </p>
<p>Pansy smirked. “Ready to study anatomy?” </p>
<p>“Absolutely!” </p>
