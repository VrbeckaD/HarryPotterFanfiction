    <p>If Oliver was to be truly honest, he wasn’t particularly fond of young adulthood. The realisation that bills existed, jobs were needed and relationships were <em>hard</em> was a slap in the face he hadn’t necessarily been expecting. He partially blamed his sheltered upbringing for his lack of knowledge about the ‘real world’; his parents’ consistent income as Ministry workers had levitated him above the majority of people he knew, and there was never a point in his life at the family home when he ever thought that money wasn’t a constantly flowing waterfall. But now, living alone in a studio apartment above a corner shop on the outskirts of Dorset, Oliver knew what the ‘real world’ had in store for him.</p><p>He was already in a sour mood that <em>dreadful</em> morning, feeling rather sorry for himself as he smashed bowls and mugs on his kitchen counter to sort out his breakfast. He’d overslept, forgotten to buy a fresh pint of milk and had somehow run out of clean shirts even though it was only Monday. Oliver had thought by the time he’d scurried into his kitchen, scrubbing at an ominous stain on one of the off-white shirts he found in his wardrobe, that nothing else would happen today to bring him further into a lull of misery and despair. That was until, just as he was about to Floo to the Puddlemere United training grounds, an owl thundered through his open window, mahogany feathers dripping with raindrops. Oliver had opened the window to listen to the sound of the rain pattering on the pavement, wanting the <em>pitter patter </em>to soothe his burning mind. He hadn’t opened it out of expectation of post; usually, given his work as a Quidditch player, his mail piled up at the training ground, growing higher and higher as he shamelessly ignored every new envelope dropping into his locker. So an owl, bone-dry and opal coloured envelope clutched in his beak, arriving in his own home was a rare sight.</p><p>“Hello?” Oliver offered, blinking at the owl. It was a fine owl, beautiful golden eyes looking longingly at Oliver as the envelope slipped onto the table. Oliver rummaged around his kitchen, scavenging a few sickles to toss into the owl’s pouch as he pulled the envelope towards him. <em>Mr Oliver Wood</em>, scribed in a beautiful red ink, painted the surface. He didn’t recognise the exquisite handwriting which, established through Oliver’s few years of adulthood, only meant one thing: a wedding invitation. He assumed there must be something swelling in the air that manipulated every couple into marriage. In the last year he’d played a part in at least seven weddings; Draco and Astoria – a wedding he did not expect an invite to – had held theirs at an Abbey in the heart of the countryside during spring while Harry and Ginny boasted a winter wedding, the church decorated with strings of real icicles and snowflakes leading the way down the aisle.</p><p>Oliver tore the envelope open, fingers toying with the end of the expensive-looking parchment as he skimmed the contents of the letter, taking a bite from the only fresh apple he had found in his fruit bowl.</p><p>
  <em>The joy of your attendance is requested at the marriage of Audrey Lovelady to Percy Ignatius Weasley.</em>
</p><p>Oliver stopped. A deep inhale sent a slice of apple down his throat, eyes watering as he choked it back up again. He managed to startle the owl, now hooting fearfully back out the window, while creasing the parchment between his fingers. He hadn’t expected that name to decorate the parchment; Oliver didn’t know who he was expecting, but his ex-boyfriend who left him six months ago was not at the top of his list. He took a breath, calming himself with another bite of his apple, then digested the rest of the information. Three months away in June, the service being held in <em>castle ruins</em> with the reception taking place moments away in a manor, dress code: orange. Oliver felt slightly sick at the thought of standing alone at his ex’s wedding, patterns of orange decorating his skin as if labelling him as an almost but <em>not quite </em>Weasley. He couldn’t reject the invitation, though, that would be too obvious that he was still painfully single and lonely.</p><p>“You’re overthinking this.” Oliver tried to convince himself, hurrying to fold the parchment back into the envelope. He glanced down at his wristwatch; not only was he going to be attending his ex’s wedding single but he was now twenty minutes late for training. Oliver shoved the letter in his bag, hoisting the strap over his shoulder as he stepped to the foot of his fireplace wondering, with agitated loneliness, exactly <em>how</em> he was going to show his face at Percy Weasley’s wedding.</p><p align="center"> ⚡</p><p>A few months after the Wizarding War passed Oliver had received a letter from Angelina Johnson suggesting the Gryffindor Quidditch team have monthly reunions at the Three Broomsticks. Friendly faces in a friendly environment, she had written, would remind them of the good times in life. To begin with so many people turned up that Angelina had to start reserving a table for them just to ensure they’d all have a seat however, like most things, as the months dragged on people’s faces slowly stopped appearing. Now only a few of them remained; Oliver arrived every time, greeting the smiling faces of Angelina, Harry, Ginny and Ron without fail. Occasionally Katie and Alicia joined them but, unsurprisingly, marriage and children had clouded their vision and demanded more attention than school friends wanting to relive their youth.</p><p>The only thought getting Oliver through the intense training session tainted by the incessant fall of rain was knowing that, in a few hours’ time, he’d be three drinks down in the buzzing Three Broomsticks. He’d somehow managed to push the thought of Percy’s wedding to the back of his mind, focusing entirely on the way he had to grip his broomstick through the blanket of rain to prevent him slipping right off the back of it. His teammates continued to pester him with questions as to why he was late and why his face was paler than usual that morning. Oliver pursued silence, though, managing to escape at the end of practice without telling a single soul about his relationship status crisis. He washed quickly in the changing room showers after an elongated session – punishment, the captain declared, for being twenty minutes late without a valid reason – out of fear he’d be late for a second time that day, this time to The Three Broomsticks.</p><p>His bag felt incredibly heavy as he heaved it over his shoulder at the end of practice. The weight of the letter combined with the subsequent weight of all his emotions tied to the name <em>Percy Weasley </em>felt like a pile of bricks were nestled at the base of his bag. He felt like he was hunched over as he stalked to the middle of the pitch to apparate away, the overbearing thought of marriage and relationships and single life forcing his back to curl and face to twist into an expression of distaste and anguish.</p><p>“Stop.” Oliver scolded himself, pinching the skin of his wrist to distract himself from the rollercoaster of thoughts spiralling around his mind. He somehow apparated accurately to Hogsmeade; Oliver had half expected to accidentally leave an arm or a leg on the pitch given his lack of concentration but, luckily, he remained in one whole piece as he pushed open the creaking door to The Three Broomsticks.</p><p>The late afternoon was a quiet time in the pub; it was too late for the lunchtime rush to be bombarding the stools but still too early for the creatures on a night out to push the tables to the side and start raving on the floorboards. Madam Rosmerta stood behind the bar entertaining a line of too-young, under-aged punters attempting to woo their way a whiskey, tossing a grateful smile in Oliver’s direction as she saw him enter. The gentle bubble of chatter rippled through the pungent air, chairs scraping and laughs sounding as customers conversed and ordered drink after drink after drink. Oliver cast a glance around the room, nodding as he saw where his group were.</p><p>In the corner by the bay window sat a bundle of gingers and brunettes, accents blending together as compliments were exchanged and greetings absorbed. The circular table was full save one seat, Oliver’s seat, and the long limbs of the adults contrasted with the small stools and narrow table top. Harry sat next to Ginny, as always, an arm strung lovingly around her shoulders. The wedding rings on their fingers gleamed under the setting sunlight that streamed through the window, the level of love they boasted being matched by the expressions painted on their faces. Ron presented himself next, beside Harry with his sleeves rolled up and scars parading the length of his skin. They looked like a rose red painting of the underground map, overlapping scars seeming to be the different lines intersecting at an array of different stations. Angelina finished the quartet; her eyes seemed tired but her face still glowed with signs of early maternity. He’d received an owl a few months prior announcing her first pregnancy with George and here, her hands smoothing gleefully over her growing bump, Angelina looked at peace with the circumstances of her life.</p><p>Oliver sifted between tables to find his seat, reciprocating delicate <em>hello’s</em> and waves as he sat, bag dropping to the floor.</p><p>“You’re late,” Angelina commented. “First time for everything, I suppose.”</p><p>“Second time,” Oliver groaned drumming his fingertips over the rickety surface of the table. “I was late for work this morning, too. I’m a changed person.”</p><p>“Oliver? Late for a Quidditch game? Something fairly important must have happened for you to miss a second of Quidditch,” Angelina laughed her response, missing the beat of uncomfortable silence that passed between the remaining individuals at the table. She paused at the lack of sound around the table, casting worried glances at everyone’s still faces out of fear she’d offended one of them. And then, it clicked. “Oh, god. I completely forgot. I’m so-”</p><p>“Don’t,” Oliver dismissed, waving a reluctant hand in the air. “I’m, uh, I’m fine with it. Mostly. The past is the past. I’m sure I’ll be happy for him eventually… Who is she, then?” Oliver didn’t need to specify the person in question’s name in order to elicit a response.</p><p>The answer came from Ginny, her voice stiff and reluctant as she spoke. “Her name is Audrey, as you know. They met at a Ministry Christmas party. She’s a Healer but her boyfriend at the time worked in the Magical Law Enforcement department,” Ginny started. “In a month she’d left him and she and Percy were already hunting for houses.”</p><p>Christmas, Oliver thought. A month after they split; he resisted commenting about the lack of time between Percy’s two relationships and rather gave a faux, taut smile to Ginny. “She sounds intelligent. I can see why he fell for her so quickly.”</p><p>“Mum told him not to invite you,” Ron was the one to speak next. “Not because she doesn’t want to see you, once a Weasley always a Weasley and all that, but she figured it’d be a little awkward.”</p><p>“He’s expecting you to say no, but he couldn’t not invite you,” Ginny continued. “You were together for quite a long time, really. Two years is a long time in this day and age. I guess he thought this was something he couldn’t do without you in the room.”</p><p>“I’m not going to say no,” Oliver shrugged. He suddenly wished that he had ordered a drink before sitting down, wanting desperately to have something numbing his mind to this conversation. “It was surprising to get the invitation, that’s for sure. Might’ve freaked out a little, but I’ll come.”</p><p>“I’m – uh,” Harry’s voice entered the conversation. “Are you going to be bringing anybody?”</p><p>“Of course,” Oliver answered, possibly too quickly to sound believable. “It’s not too serious right now, but they’ll be coming with me. You probably don’t know them. I’ve been taking things slow with basically everybody since Perce and me, you know…”</p><p>“That’s great, Oliver!” Ginny smiled, lips curled into a genuinely pleasant and happy shape. The smile reminded him vaguely of how she’d looked when Oliver had arrived at her wedding, arm in arm with Percy on the front row. “The first relationship after a breakup is always hard. But you’re a stud, so, any man would be stupid to say no to you.”</p><p>“Hey.” Harry’s faux betrayal quickly drew the conversation away from Percy and Audrey, a kiss between him and Ginny taking them onto an argument about their Quidditch League predictions.</p><p><em>Why</em>, Oliver thought. He’d just lied through his teeth declaring that not only was he bringing a date to Percy’s wedding, but, he was actively dating this person when in reality he hadn’t seriously looked at another man since Percy walked out on him all those months ago. It was an incredibly overwhelming situation for him to begin with so why he’d dropped the ball of his own accord and made up false statements to keep up appearances was beyond him.</p><p>He hadn’t a single idea where he would find someone to bring to the wedding, let alone somebody who would convincingly play the part of happy partners. Oliver knew he wouldn’t be able to find a person he cared about that much in three months; he’d shamefully realised on a failed date three weeks ago that the split with Percy had planted seeds of some severe trust issues in his heart. He’d struggled to believe a word the person opposite him had muttered and, as a result, had fled home while his date excused himself to the restroom.</p><p>“Drinks?” Oliver exclaimed after his moment of silence passed.</p><p>“Whiskey for us, please.” Harry smiled, tossing the money for his and Ginny’s drinks in Oliver’s direction. More coins followed as Ron requested Peachfizz (a new recipe Madam Rosmerta had been trying out for the last few months) and Angelina stuck strictly to Pumpkin Juice. Oliver hurtled off to the bar, fingers gripping so tightly around the coins that their curved edges dug into the soft skin of his palms.</p><p>“Someone looks troubled.” It wasn’t Madam Rosmerta’s voice that greeted him across the bar. Oliver looked up, taken aback by the face that stared back.</p><p>“Oh, um,” Oliver started; in his humble opinion the God’s above him were truly being cruel now. His day had been eventful enough, Oliver didn’t know what he had done to deserve this confrontation now. “Marcus. Hi.”</p><p>Marcus Flint smiled, teeth beaming as his lips curled upwards. He had a towel flung over his right shoulder, shirt buttoned only halfway up as he rested his elbows on the bar separating them. His skin seemed more tanned than Oliver remembered, a constellation of scars dug into his hands that gripped a few soapy glasses. He was still thin, shoulders broad as Oliver recalled from the Quidditch Pitch all those years ago. Marcus’ eyes stared through Oliver’s own, reciprocating the intense analysis Oliver had been giving him. “Oliver. Hi.” Marcus finally repeated.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Oliver asked.</p><p>“I could ask you the same thing,” Marcus seconded. Oliver’s lack of response urged Marcus on, a chuckle leaving Marcus’ lips as he continued. “I work here. My internship at the <em>Daily Prophet </em>doesn’t really cover the cost of rent these days. Surely that’s obvious from where I’m standing compared to where you are.”</p><p>Oliver nodded, his clumsy fingers letting the coins cupped in his palm scatter across the bar. The chiming of coins colliding with the wood clattered ridiculously loud, causing punters on both his sides to send disapproving glares his way. “Sorry, long day. My mind isn’t connecting the dots right now.”</p><p>“It’s fine. What can I get you?” Marcus asked, drawing the coins to the end of the bar before allowing them to tumble into his waiting palm.</p><p>“Pumpkin Juice, one Peachfizz, two Firewhiskey’s and a Red Currant Rum, please.” Oliver recited, watching with growing curiosity as Marcus poured and effortlessly stirred drinks with a gentle flick of his wand. He filled tumblers right to the top without allowing any overflow, summoning them on to a tray he’d conjured in front of Oliver’s eyes. He tipped the coins into the cashier before him, the tinkling of coins forming a sonorous melody that elicited a smile on his face.</p><p>“Cool. There you go,” Marcus finished, placing Oliver’s change on the tray as he gently pushed it across the bar. “Let me know if there’s anything else I can get for you.” He didn’t move, though. They both stood there, still looking directly at the other without a hint of intimidation flickering over their faces.</p><p>“Internship at the <em>Prophet</em>?” Oliver asked.</p><p>Marcus nodded. “Yeah. Editor in training of the announcements section. I know all about the births, deaths and weddings of the wizarding world.”</p><p>The silence that fell between them told Oliver immediately Marcus <em>knew</em>. “If you want to say something, do it now.”</p><p>“I don’t have anything to say,” was Marcus’ gentle reply. “I’m not evil. If you ever, you know, need anything… I’m here for you.”</p><p>Oliver nodded, waiting a moment more before picking up the tray. “Okay.”</p><p>He turned to move back to the table, intercepted again by a quiet <em>Oliver</em> coming from Marcus’ lips. “I met her, the girl, at that Ministry party. He’s downgraded.”</p><p>Oliver didn’t reply, simply blinked and shuffled eagerly back to the table. As he set the tray down and dished out the drinks he absorbed mere words of the conversation occurring around him; it seemed that names for Angelina’s unborn child were being suggested and, were Oliver listening, he would have been happily supplying his own ideas. But his mind was detached from the conversation, rather focused on the boy behind the bar and the mysterious comment he had just made about Audrey. His eyes, now glued to Marcus, followed every move the boy made. From filling more drinks to stocking the shelves with clean glasses, Oliver noticed how Marcus’ lips were curved into a constant grin. He went to retreat to the back of the bar, most likely to collect more barrels of Butterbeer, but, at the last minute, looked straight over to Oliver. He blessed Oliver’s vision with a subtle wink, flashing a final, simple smile as he wandered out of sight.</p><p align="center"> ⚡</p><p>At home that evening, rolling a quill between his shaking fingers, Oliver signed the RSVP slip attached to the invitation and stared longingly at Percy’s name. He’d send it off tomorrow after training, taking a detour to the Post Office instead of Flooing straight home. His eyes scanned the writing at the bottom. <em>Percy and Audrey extend this invitation to a Plus One, if required. Please detail below if you are to take up this opportunity. </em></p><p>He could leave it unticked and, when the questions would flow in months later, Oliver could tell Ginny that the relationship ended and he couldn’t find anyone else to bring. That would be the easy way out of the pool of lies he’d dunked himself into. The confidence faltered quickly, though, as it was highly likely that Percy would tell his family about Oliver’s reply and would most likely mention the fact he didn’t list a plus one. Seating arrangements would be made and catering organised and, to Oliver’s dismay, his lack of a plus one on the RSVP slip would be noted the moment the owl delivered it to the Burrow.</p><p>Still, Oliver doubted he’d be able to trick someone into coming to a wedding with him. Most people he knew well enough to ask would most likely have an invitation of their own and, given the fact they were all well into their twenties by now, wouldn’t be eager to play a game of pretend all evening. There wasn’t any doubt in Oliver’s mind that all of his classmates were now in happy relationships themselves, if not already married. But he <em>couldn’t </em>go alone. It would be humiliating beyond belief, more so than when he swallowed a fly in a Quidditch final and flew into his own hoops. Oliver knew he needed to find somebody, even if it was completely fake and emotionless. Pretending to be in love with someone would be incredibly easy the minute they both had ounces of alcohol in their stomachs. The only difficulty was thinking of a person to ask.</p><p>Then it hit him. <em>If you ever, you know, need anything… I’m here for you. </em></p><p align="center"> ⚡</p><p>Oliver had been filled to the brim with confidence the next day as he planned his flowery speech to Marcus about why he needed them to pretend love each other for an evening. In Quidditch Practice he saved more goals than he had the whole season thus far, flying breezily on his broom as if it were as easy as walking down the street. He sent his RSVP off at the Post Office later that morning, having proudly checked the ‘<em>I will be bringing a Plus One’ </em>box. Oliver had planted a kiss to the envelope before attaching it to the leg of an over-excited owl. It wasn’t a kiss of love or wanting, rather a kiss of confidence that he would be entering that wedding with not a single pair of eyes looking at him with sympathy.</p><p>Oliver only wished he’d retained that confidence as he apparated to <em>The Three Broomsticks </em>later that evening. He left his journey until the beginning of dusk, wanting the shower of stars in the sky to be as clear as ever before he embarked on his task. The streets of Hogsmeade bloomed with young couples and friends gallivanting into shops, most of them crowding the doorway to the pubs. An ambiance of friendship drifted along the main street, accompanied with clouds of laughter from gangs of girls gripping each other’s hands as they descended into <em>The Three Broomsticks.</em> Oliver followed them in, heart gradually sinking and confidence dropping at an exponential rate as the floorboards creaked beneath him.</p><p>He caught sight of Marcus at the bar, busying himself with the act of polishing glasses rather than serving the tidal waves of wizards and witches bombarding the front of house. Madam Rosmerta remained unfazed at the level of custom, gliding between the faces, old and young, with the same level of love and gratitude she showed everyone at all times. Oliver swallowed, his throat appearing to shrink in size as he forced his emotions back down. He stalked towards where Marcus was; by chance there were no punters seated around the corner where Marcus worked, they’d all clumped to the tables or leaned against the pillars.</p><p>“Hi!” Oliver’s exclamation presented a false sense of confidence. He flooded with worry and regret as Marcus looked up to him, face more shocked than Oliver had anticipated.</p><p>“Hey,” Marcus’ reply was cool but confused, hands setting the glass down on the bar as to not risk smashing it on the ground. “I didn’t expect to see you back here. I haven’t seen and of your friends this evening.”</p><p>“I’m not here for them,” Oliver shrugged, masking his nervousness by sitting on one of the stools. The wooden structure squeaked beneath him, almost squealing for him to <em>leave </em>and <em>run</em> before he made a fool of himself. “I’m here for you.”</p><p>“Oh.” Marcus paused, summoning two clean glasses filled with a burning, red liquid. He pushed one to Oliver’s side, tilting his head ever so slightly as he waited for Oliver to continue.</p><p>“I have a favour I need to ask.” Oliver began, taking a grateful sip of the rum Marcus had poured for him.</p><p>“You need a favour from me?” Marcus’ confusion deepened, eyebrows drawing together as if he was trying to see through the sentence for a joke.</p><p>Oliver nodded. “Yeah. You said yesterday that if I needed anything I could come to you. And,” he continued before Marcus could argue any point. “I know you probably meant emotional support, but hear me out. You know my ex is getting married. You also probably deduced that I’m not getting married and that I’m painfully single.”</p><p>“Not painfully, but it was sort of clear you were single.” Marcus managed to slip in a comment between sips of his drink. His shirt was buttoned lower this time, allowing Oliver full vision of the scars across his chest and the few tattoos he’d inked over his skin. The Hawaiian pattern – of course he’d wear Hawaiian shirts, Oliver thought – beautifully contrasted the coloured ink drawings decorating his skin, making his body look like an art gallery of its own accord.</p><p>“Good, so,” Oliver continued. “My preposition is this: I can’t go to this wedding alone. Turning up to my ex’s wedding single is just a level of social embarrassment I don’t think I can handle. You said if I needed anything I could come to you. So, will you be my fake boyfriend for the night of my ex-boyfriend’s wedding so I can avoid the looks of pity from everyone there?”</p><p>Oliver’s question tumbled off his rosy lips faster than he anticipated and he was half expecting Marcus to ask him to repeat the words. But that never came. Marcus stood in silence for a moment, swilling his rum around the base of his glass.</p><p>“I didn’t even tell you I was gay.” Marcus finally commented.</p><p>“You didn’t need to tell me,” Oliver shrugged. “Not to stereotype or anything, but you’re literally wearing a half-buttoned Hawaiian shirt, Marcus. It doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together.”</p><p>A smile found its way back to Marcus’ face as he downed the rest of his rum. The glass remained empty for mere seconds before magically refilling to the brim, the red liquid glinting under the light of the lantern hanging behind them. “You want me to pretend to be in love with you so you don’t have to go to your ex’s wedding alone?”</p><p>“I never mentioned being in love.” Oliver countered.</p><p>“Don’t be pedantic.”</p><p>“But yes, essentially. I’ll pay for your suit and travel and accommodation. You just need to stand next to me, looking pretty, agreeing with everything I say about our relationship.” Oliver explained, nervously drumming his fingers over the bar.</p><p>Marcus silenced himself again, eyes looking Oliver up and down at a scarily slow pace. “Fine. But,” he continued, hushing Oliver’s immediate signs of elation. “I’m not standing silent and just agreeing with you.”</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>Marcus’ eyes rolled. “We’re sorting out a backstory. Those Weasley’s notice everything. If it doesn’t seem believable they’ll know you’re still single and in love with your ex. Meet me in the <em>Leaky Cauldron </em>on Saturday and we can make up a plan.”</p><p>“I’m not in love with Percy.” Oliver argued.</p><p>“But you are, though. If you weren’t you wouldn’t be so worried about being caught single at his wedding.” Marcus explained. There was a glint of confusion blossoming in his eyes again, accompanied with an awkward clearing of his throat.</p><p>“That’s not why I’m worried about going single.” Oliver didn’t fully believe his retort, though. He thought he was completely over Percy; surely he couldn’t still be smitten with the ginger heart-breaker after he completely tore his soul to shreds not too long ago.</p><p>“If you say so, boyfriends,” Marcus shrugged. “Seriously, though. Saturday, <em>Leaky Cauldron</em>. I finish my internship at six. I’ll buy you dinner.”</p><p>Oliver nodded. “Thank you.” He held a hand out for Marcus to shake, smiling ever so slightly as Marcus’ tanned fingers intertwined with his own pale ones. They shared a final curious gaze, Marcus supplying another ambiguous wink, before Oliver turned back out of the room and shuttled himself to the nearest Floo network.</p><p align="center"> ⚡</p><p>Oliver hadn’t been to the <em>Leaky Cauldron</em> since his Hogwarts days. He and his family would make a trip out of coming to Diagon Alley for his supplies, stopping over in the pub the evening before descending into the shops the morning after. Oliver remembered staring longingly at the new broomsticks hanging in shop windows while his mother forced him into more mundane bookstores and quill suppliers. He used to be bright-eyed and metaphorically bushy-tailed at the thought of returning to Hogwarts so, as he entered the pub at six that Saturday evening, he felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him.</p><p>Behind the counter Hannah Abbott drew beers and poured tea, conversing quietly with witches juggling coins between their fingers. She, like Madam Rosmerta, threw a loving smile in Oliver’s direction, beckoning him to the front of the bar as she spotted him entering his establishment.</p><p>“Oliver, it’s so wonderful to see you,” Hannah reached across the bar, arms enveloping Oliver in an unexpected yet happily received hug. “It’s been too long. What brings you here?”</p><p>“You too, Abbott,” Oliver smiled, noting the ring that was wound around her finger. She didn’t correct him, though, and Oliver assumed her wedding had yet to be planned. “Just meeting up with someone. Friendly catch-up. How’s Neville?”</p><p>“He’s wonderful,” Hannah’s face lit up. “He loves working at Hogwarts. Living here is going well, we’re engaged. It gets lonely while he’s away all that time but it’s hard to feel sad when you’ve got your friendly customers. But don’t let me keep you. I’ll send my MagiMenu over in a moment.”</p><p>“MagiMenu?” Oliver asked.</p><p>“George Weasley helped me make them. You essentially write down your order on the menu which then flies to the kitchen. When your order is done it flies the plates over to you. Very clever invention, really. Saves a lot of stress and time.” Hannah explained, supplying Oliver with a small wave before turning back to the customers at the front of the bar.</p><p>Oliver looked around the orange-tinted room, breath catching in his throat as he saw Marcus in the corner. He manoeuvred through untucked chairs and askew tables to sit opposite him, making his presence noticed with a gentle tap of his knuckles on the table.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Marcus smiled. “Hi. You’re right on time.”</p><p>“And you’re clearly early.” Oliver noted, shrugging off his coat as he scooted his chair closer to the table.</p><p>“Early is better than late. I always arrive to places early. Let’s people know I’m excited to see them,” Marcus explained. “How was your week?”</p><p>“Small talk, really?” Oliver inquired, scanning over the contents of the MagiMenu that had dropped in front of him.</p><p>“Does it really count as small talk if I’m genuinely interested?” Marcus countered, tapping the end of his wand to a few options on his menu.</p><p>Oliver mirrored the actions, waiting for the menus to drift off before speaking again. “I suppose not,” he continued. “It’s been okay. Had a friendly match against a local Quidditch team which was exciting. We won, of course. Met up with my mum for dinner one of the evenings. That’s about as exciting as my life gets these days. You?”</p><p>“Standard,” Marcus shrugged. “Dealing with annoying, flirtatious drunks over the bar before returning to work to write about death, love and life. Truly puts into perspective how alone I am sometimes. Speaking of alone, we need to sort out our life story.”</p><p>“Life story? Why can’t it just be that we bumped into each other, had a drunken one night stand and are now testing the waters?” Suggested Oliver, lifting his beer bottle to his lips as it appeared at the table.</p><p>“Uhm, no,” Marcus’ response was plain and dry. “I’m romantic, Oliver. I would never hook up with someone in a one night stand and ‘test the waters’. I have standards.”</p><p>“Well, genius. What do you suggest?” Oliver asked.</p><p>Marcus paused, running the rim of his bottle over his lips as he thought. “Halloween? If we meet on a holiday it’s easy to remember.”</p><p>“I told Ginny I’d only been seeing this person for a short while. Halloween is too long ago.” Oliver sighed.</p><p>“New Year’s? That’s only three months, reasonably short for an adult relationship.” Marcus continued, a little taken aback when a plate dropped in front of him.</p><p>“New Year’s works for me,” Oliver nodded, devouring a few mouthfuls of his soup. The warmth filled every ounce of his body, leaving an aftertaste of <em>home</em> on his tongue after every swallow or bite. “So where were we on New Year’s Eve and why did we end up together?”</p><p>“At a party. But a party where nobody else would be. So, we can’t say a Ministry party for obvious reasons. Possibly a <em>Prophet </em>party? That is where I was that evening, anyway. You could’ve been there through connections? You’re a Quidditch player who’d just won the season so it makes sense you’d be told about the party. You turn up, I’m there. Chuck some rum down our necks, the countdown to the New Year and we have our first kiss in the bag.”</p><p>“I can see why you’re interning at the <em>Prophet</em>, you sure do like putting thought into fictional stories.” Oliver chuckled.</p><p>“I’ll just ignore the fact that you insulted a franchise as fine as the <em>Prophet</em>,” Oliver detected a sliver of sarcasm oozing into Marcus’ response, causing him to scoff on the beer he had swilling in his mouth. “This is just to make things easier. So we met on New Year’s, <em>did not</em> sleep with each other, and kept chatting afterwards. Because we live quite far apart we could only meet on weekends, sometimes less, hence why you said it wasn’t that serious. Are you happy with that?”</p><p>Oliver nodded. “I am. New Year’s Eve, kiss at midnight, no sex. Cool. I like the sound of that.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while after that, making their way through the food in front of them, draining bottles of beer as though they were cups of water after they’d trekked through a desert. Their giddy giggles filled the air as they conversed about hypothetical dates they’d been on in their ‘relationship’, creating mundane details about their time together that nobody at a wedding would ask about, but they created nonetheless. Oliver noticed how Marcus’ smile left dimples penetrating the apples of his cheeks, perfect crescent moon shapes carved into his tanned skin. The freckles dotted over his whole form, in particular two freckles above his dimples, created smiley faces over him. Marcus simply radiated warmth, from the very tone to his skin through to the acceptance and happiness that he conveyed every time he so much as smiled. Conversation flowed with effortless joy, not a moment of silence uncomfortable as they paused the drink or to think up an answer to a question. The customers around them came and went like clouds in the outside sky, but still they sat. Oliver didn’t know the time of evening it had become, all he knew was there were twelve bottles of beer between them and that his eyes were beginning to droop with a desperation of sleep.</p><p>“We should get a room for the evening. You’re too tipsy to make it back through the Floo network and I don’t want to apparate like this. Hannah gave me a key on the way in.” Marcus finally commented, stuttering words together like a scratching record. There were pauses between his sentences that lingered a little too long to appear purposeful, instead highlighting how much effort he put into the utterances to make sure they appeared coherent.</p><p>“One room?”</p><p>“If you want me to play pretend and make people believe that we’ve been together for six months at a wedding, you need to be open to sharing a bed. If we’re staying the night in this manor where the reception is being held people will ask questions if we ask for two rooms.” Marcus explained, lifting himself from the table with difficulty. His hand went to wrap around Oliver’s wrist, but his delicate fingertips found their way through the gaps between Oliver’s fingers instead.</p><p>Oliver rose with the help from Marcus, leaning most of his weight onto Marcus’ side as they ascended the staircase to room Hannah had given them for the evening. The corridors seemed narrow and lopsided as they walked but, Oliver thought, it was possibly just the alcohol in his system blurring the edges and shaking his view of his surroundings. By the time he managed to focus his eyesight on a single floorboard Marcus had unlocked a door and pulled Oliver inside, a chill from the open window whipping around their ankles and necks.</p><p>“I’m taking the right side of the bed.” Marcus declared, falling immediately onto the covers.</p><p>“I sleep on the left, anyway. This is already a perfect match.”</p><p>Oliver’s smile went unseen in the darkness of the room, only the moonlight spilling in from the window to light a small patch of the floor. Neither of them reached to turn the lanterns on; they just lay in silence, only the sounds of their jittery breaths floating into the air.</p><p>“Before you pass out and inevitably leave before I wake up in the morning,” Marcus uttered out of nowhere. “When am I going to hear from you next?”</p><p>“Couple of weeks, maybe? We need to go suit shopping anyway, but if this is going to be, you know, believable,” Oliver applied air quotation marks around the word ‘believable’. “We should spend some time with each other.”</p><p>“We kind of need to practice kissing and all of that mundane stuff.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“So many questions,” Marcus groaned. “Wedding, Oliver. Full of love and couples and alcohol. Alcohol and romance often results in kissing and touching. We’ll stick out like sore thumbs if we don’t do any of that. Please use your mind.”</p><p>“Right, makes sense.”</p><p>“I’m going to sleep now. Send me an owl when you want to spend time together. Or, you know, just pop into my work like you did earlier this week. It was a wonderful surprise seeing your pretty face again.”</p><p>Oliver went to question what Marcus meant but, just as he formed the sentence in his mind, he heard gentle exhales falling from the lips of the boy next to him. He left Marcus to sleep, pulling the covers over them as a shield to the chill from the still open window at the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Oliver seemed to end the week as overwhelmed as he had started it. From panicking about being single going in to his ex’s wedding – an ex who he <em>possibly </em>still had feelings for – to making plans to practice affection with his fake boyfriend, Oliver continued to be awash with confusion and exhaustion. His bones were elated that he was finally spending a night sleeping rather than sitting awake tossing and turning every scenario revolving around the wedding in his mind. As he turned to his side, taking in the shadowy outline of Marcus’ profile as he slept, Oliver felt a flicker of excitement. He had no idea how this was going to unfold in the future but for now, with the prospects endless, he knew his life was about to get a little bit more exciting.</p>
