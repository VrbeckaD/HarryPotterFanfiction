    <p>"Scram or else," Ron growled. "Or else what? You're gonna beat me up? We're on school grounds, so you can't do that," I said. "Look around you, Abigail. I don't see any professors or other students. Do you?" Harry said. "No," I replied. "We're gonna do whatever we want to you and you can't do anything to stop us," Ron sneered. "Please don't! Please no or I'll..." I started. "Or else you'll what? You'll go crying to your boyfriend?" Ron asked and they beat me up.</p><p>An hour later...</p><p>The beating finally ended when the bell rang. "Shit! We're gonna be late for Potions," Ron said. "Shall we tell her boyfriend, Snape, that she'll be late?" Harry asked. "Nah, he probably already knows already," Ron said and they left me there. I waited ten minutes before limping to a bathroom to reapply my makeup. Once I was sure that all the bruises on my face were covered, I cast a spell on my body that hid my limp and broken skin. Then I went to potions where a livid Snape looked up at my entrance.</p><p>"Late again as usual. So nice of you to join us. So what's your excuse this time?" he asked. "I-I finished the assignment you gave us last week," I replied, pulling the piece of parchment from my bag. "You mean that you just finished last minute?" he sneered and I could the other students snickering. "I started it the night you assigned it, Sir," I replied. "Whatever... just go sit down," he growled after roughly grabbing the parchment from my hand. I grabbed the ingredients written on the road and sat at an empty table at the very back of class away from everyone.</p><p>A few minutes later...</p><p>Snape stopped at my desk as he was making his rounds. "What is this?" he asked. "T-the potion," I replied. "No, it's not. I wrote on the board to put in one mermaid scale. Not two. Twenty points from Gryffindor since Abi-" He didn't get a chance to finish as I had stood up angrily. I hit my cauldron with the back of my hand, sending it flying across the room. "Shut up! Just shut the fuck up! I'm done with you! I'm done with this fucking school and all the fucking students and fucked up teachers! I hate you, Professor! I fucking hate you the most!" she yelled, packing her school bag and left. </p><p>Snape's POV: </p><p>'What was that about?' I thought. I was too shocked to take more points. I waved my wand and the mess Abigail left behind disappeared. I picked up her cauldron and put it in a cupboard for safekeeping. "What are you all staring at? Back to work!" I snapped. I went over to my desk and sat down angrily. Why did it hurt so much that she said she hated me most I thought. When the bell rang, everyone handed in a phial of their potion after cleaning up and gathering their stuff.</p><p>Abigail's POV:</p><p>I went outside and sat under a tree by the lake. A few minutes later, two people dragged me to the lake. They held my entire body under the water until I felt like I was gonna pass out. Then they dragged me to the shore and ran off. I was too weak to move or get up, so I just stayed there. After lunch and supper time went by, I forced myself to get up and to Gryffindor tower. I slumped onto my bed, unconscious before I hit the sheets. </p><p>I awoke screaming several hours later after a reoccurring nightmare that I had had since I was attacked by a werewolf several years ago. It hadn't happened in over a year though. "Shut up! People are trying to sleep!" Hermione yelled. "Sorry," I whispered and snuck outside. I fainted under a group of trees with cold, hard rain pouring down on me. </p><p>The next day...</p><p>Hermione's POV: </p><p>I woke up the next morning to find Abigail's bed empty, but soaked. Figuring shed probably wet the bed, I thought nothing of it. "Hermione? Have you seen Abigail? Is she upstairs still?" Fred and George asked worriedly when I went downstairs to the common room. "No, I haven't seen her since I fell asleep last night," I lied, omitting the part when I yelled at her. "She'll turn up for breakfast," George said hopefully. Abigail wasn't at breakfast or lunch or any of our classes either. </p><p>Abigail's POV: </p><p>I awoke late in the afternoon and realized that I had missed half my classes. I got up and limped to Snape's office without even thinking or realizing what I was doing. I knocked on his door before collapsing on the floor. "What is it? Hello? That damn Peeves," he grumbled. "Sn...ape..." I whispered weakly before he could close the door. "Abigail?" he asked and knelt down beside me. "Pl...ea...se..." I whimpered and fainted.</p><p>Snape's POV:</p><p>"Abigail? Abigail?! Can you hear me?" I asked, but she didn't respond. I easily scooped her up and carried her to the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomphrey quickly ushered me to a bed where I gently laid her down. "What happened?" she asked. "I-I don't know... she came to my office and knocked on the door. I found her collapsed on the floor. She's soaking wet," I replied. "You should go talk to Dumbledore and her Head of House while I'm treating her," she said. "Ok," I said and left.</p><p>I went to Dumbledore's office first and knocked on the door. "Enter," he said and I walked in. "Well hello my boy. What can I do for you, son? Lemon Drop?" he asked. "No, I do wish you'd stop asking me if I want those sugary things," I said. "What's wrong?" he asked. "Abigail just came to my office. I don't know what happened but she was collapsed on the floor," I explained. "I see... Have you told Minevera yet?" he asked. "No, I was about to that after I left," I replied. "I'll do it. You go write an letter to her parents and then go stay by her side," he said. "Ok," I said. </p><p>I quickly wrote the letter and went to the owlery. I tied the letter to the leg of my owl and sent it on it's way. Then I went to the Hospital Wing. "She's going to be ok now. By the looks of it, she been taking brutal beatings since school started in September. We have to keep an eye on her hyperthermia, pneumonia, and concussion. Keep her warm, keep her fever down and mind her bruises and broken hand and leg," I heard Poppy say.</p><p>I sat on the nearest bed, legs too weak to support me. Then I did something I hadn't done in years: I cried. "Severus? Hey Severus? Are you alright?" I heard Minevera ask. She sounded far away. I felt someone gently put their hand on my shoulder and I looked up. "Go to her, my dear boy. Don't worry, she'll be ok," Albus said. "But..." I said. "Who's the one she went to? You... who bullied her. She needs you by her side," Albus said.</p><p>"Ok," I said and I went to Abigail's side. "It looks like she was attacked by an animal some time ago," Poppy said when Albus and Minevera left. "What do you mean?" I asked, taking Abigail's uninjured hand. "When I was checking Abigail's injuries, I noticed scars shaped like claws and bite marks all over her back. They seem to be several years old," Poppy explained. "I'll ask her about when she's better," I said, stroking the back of Abigail's hand.</p><p>The next day...</p><p>I slept curled up against Abigail's body, taking in the sweet scent of her shampoo. "You know, he actually looks kinda cute when he's sleeping," I heard someone whisper, maybe one of the twins. "I put another bed close to hers, but I guess he wanted to personally keep her warm," Poppy said, making me blush. "Snape, you smell really nice... Like honey and potions and lavender and... home," Abigail mumbled against my neck. Her arm was slung over my chest, her body pressed against mine. "Are you cold?" I asked. "Mm hm," she mumbled. "Good morning," Fred or George said happily. "Shh... don't wanna wake from this beautiful dream," she said. </p><p>"Hey, wake up. This isn't a dream, sweetie," I said and she shot up. "Oh no! I'm so so so sorry," she said, panicked. "Hey, it's alright. I've got you," I said. "Owww," she said slumping into my arms. "Wanna tell us how you got beat up?" Molly asked, angrily. "I-I... well... I... uh... fell down the stairs," Abigail said, curling against my body. "You were beaten up. Do you know who did it?" I asked. "No, I didn't see their faces," she replied. "Them? How many is them?" I asked. "I don't know," she replied and fainted.</p>
