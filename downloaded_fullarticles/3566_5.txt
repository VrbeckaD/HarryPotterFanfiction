    <p>Summer, quite honestly, sucks for Tiffany.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Caroline and her mother have gone away for three weeks in August, and since Tiffany was pulled out of primary school, she no longer has many friends in the village to talk to and play with, so she spends most of her time reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This in itself isn’t that bad, she likes to read, it helps to broaden the mind after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no bookshops or even a library nearby, and her mother won’t give her any bus money to go into Bath to buy herself more books. Although, the lack of bookshops isn’t really an issue when she’s barely been allowed outside the house. She got to sunbathe in the garden a few days ago, but beyond the occasional treat Tiffany has been stuck indoors, much to her displeasure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, Tiffany!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know very well why.” Her mother adjusts her glasses on her nose, and places her hands on her hips. “You got into too much trouble last year, and I had another note from Dumbledore at the end of the year saying that you’d entered a forbidden area! This is your punishment!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But Mum!” Tiffany pleads. “I’m bored!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Eat your breakfast and stop complaining!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tiffany sulkily eats the rest of her cereal.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, it seems, Tiffany gets her school supply list for her next year, and she can escape her tiny village; if only for a day to go to Diagon Alley. Somehow, she manages to persuade her mother to go on her own again. Last year she’d been frightened to go by herself, but now she longs for freedom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She waves happily to Tulip Karasu as the red head leaves Magical Menagerie, holding what looks like a toad. They don’t talk, but then Tulip has always been a bit of a loner, so it’s no surprise and Tiffany doesn’t take any offence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On her way out of Sugarplum’s Sweets Shop, clutching a bag full of sweets that she almost certainly shouldn’t have bought, she all but collides with Andre Egwu, who has a brand new broom clutched in his grasp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Careful!” He says a little angrily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You ran into me!” Tiffany complains, picking herself up and dusting off her skirt. “New broom?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“For try outs!” He puffs up his chest a little. “My parents have let me get a new broom, so I’ll definitely make seeker!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh! That’s so cool.” Tiffany says. She’s honestly not that interested, but it will be cool having someone in her class on the team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Have you thought about trying out for the team? You’re a decent flyer!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh! No. Mum won’t let me have a broom, so I can’t practice over the holidays.” Tiffany mourns. “I’m not too worried though, I have other things to worry about.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Like your brother.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, it was nice to talk to you, Tiffany. I’ll see you in a couple weeks!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, see you Andre!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andre saunters away, and Tiffany stares after him. She stands still for just a few moments before deciding to see how many of her school books she can buy on the cheap from one of the second hand book shops nearby. She already has a copy of <em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2</em> from Jacob’s time at Hogwarts, but there are two new books for Defence class, and another textbook for astronomy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tiffany pushes her way into the shop, and a bell sounds off above her head. She recognises one of the Gryffindor prefects working behind the counter, likely trying to save up some money over the summer by taking on a part time job, and also Merula Snyde paying for her books, face twisted in concentration as she counts out the coppers one by one. Merula looks up as Tiffany enters, and after a brief moment of awkwardness, Tiffany decides to pretend she can’t see Merula. It’s for the best, if Merula decides to take some offence and duel in the shop, Tiffany will be grounded for the rest of her life, rather than just the rest of the summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once Merula leaves the shop, Tiffany is able to take her books to the counter to buy, and the prefect gives her an odd look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pemberton, right?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tiffany, yeah. You’re in Gryffindor, aren’t you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m Angelica.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good summer?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not really, I don’t mind working but it sucks not being able to go outside. How about you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve been grounded since I got back for last year, so it’s not been great. Today’s the first day I’ve been allowed out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That sucks.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, that’ll be two sickles and five knuts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tiffany hands over the money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thanks, bye!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She leaves the store, stacking her books into her large leather satchel, and carefully places her bag of sweets from earlier on top so that they don’t get squashed. As she walks down the Alley, she comes to a sudden stop as she sees something that she really wants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In one of the shop windows, there’s a brown leather utility belt, with multiple pouches, all with beautiful metal clasps. It looks like something Indiana Jones might wear if he were a wizard rather than a muggle, and Tiffany <em>wants </em>it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except, the price tag is 14 galleons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She has two.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello Tiff!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tiffany jumps out of her skin and whips around to see Penny standing behind her, a grin on her face. Penny’s wearing a pair of acid wash jeans, and a pink leopard print top. She looks, in Tiffany’s opinion, cool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, Pen.” Tiffany tries to get her breath back after her fright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I see you’ve found something you like.” Penny says, moving to stand next to her. “Looking for Vault breaking gear?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe.” Tiffany feels a blush creep over her freckled cheeks. She doesn’t know why, but Penny always makes her feel a little bit silly. It’s not because she’s mean, or tries to make her feel small, but Tiffany always has an urge to impress her. “I can’t afford it though.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Penny leans forward and squints at the price. “Oh wow, yeah that’s not cheap. Could you ask your parents to buy it for you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am in way too much trouble for that.” Tiffany rubs the back of her head self-consciously. “I’ll save up for it. It’ll be okay.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sure it will be.” Penny smiles one of her beautiful smiles, and leaves as her mother calls down the street to her. “Bye, Tiff!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bye, Pen!”</p>

  <em>To Tiffany,</em>

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I hope your parents aren’t being too strict with you! I got grounded too, if that makes you feel better. I’m so jealous that Penny’s parents only grounded her for a week, and we can’t go anywhere for the whole summer besides getting our school supplies!</em>
</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>My parents bought a cat though. I won’t bring him to Hogwarts, my parents love him too much for me to do that. He’s called Fuzzclaw, and he’s so fluffy! I love him a lot. It’s probably safer to keep him at home anyway, what with these Cursed Vaults. </em>

  <em>I’m really sorry we weren’t able to meet in Diagon Alley to get school supplies. I miss talking to you in person, but Mum wouldn’t let me go on any other day. </em>

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Fuzzclaw sounds cute! It’s a shame you aren’t bringing him to school, I’d love to meet him! But yes I agree, it’s safer to keep him with your parents.</em>

  <em>And yes, I’ve read the textbooks. Three times already! I’m so bored being stuck here, I bet you are too. </em>

<hr/>
<p>“So, you’re leaving tomorrow.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Caroline and Auntie Susan came over for dinner before Tiffany left, a kind gesture from her mother after Tiffany spent a summer being punished. Now, Tiffany and Caroline are relaxing in Tiffany’s room. It’s tidy, insofar as Tiffany’s belongings are all packed away in her trunk ready for school. Luckily this means that Tiffany didn't have to try and hide her magical belongings; apparently there are 'laws' and the 'Statute of Secrecy' or something. Tiffany doesn't really care about it all that much, and keeping secrets from Caroline sucks a little bit, but there's not much she can do to change it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, I am.” Tiffany plays with a loose curl. “I miss you, though. When I’m away.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Cutie.” Caroline ruffles Tiffany’s hair. “Try not to get into too much trouble this time, yeah?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll try, but you know…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know what?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sometimes, you just have to do things, right?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re a strange kid, Tiff.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Caroline reaches over, and pulls her into a hug, that Tiffany gladly reciprocates. She really is going to miss her cousin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, I got you something." Caroline reaches into her jacket pocket, and pulls out a photograph. It's still, like all muggle photos, and Tiffany gratefully accepts it, and looks at the photo.</p>
<p>It was taken <em>years </em>ago. Tiffany only looks to be about five, and Caroline a little older and Jacob older still. They'd gone to their Grandmother's house, and their families had decided to take a picture of them all on the swing. They're all grinning, and it's a very cute photo. The only other photo Tiffany has of Jacob is the one taken at the beach. </p>
<p><br/>"We were clearing out some old things and I found it. Thought you might like a reminder of home when you go off to boarding school again."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It's wonderful, Caroline!" Tiffany gushes. "Thank you!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They pretend to ignore the dampness in Tiffany's eyes.</p>
