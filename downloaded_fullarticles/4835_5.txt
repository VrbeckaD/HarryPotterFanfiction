  <b>Molly’s Wisdom.</b>
</p>
<p>“Harry, come rescue Arthur from Severus’ wrath.” Molly pleaded. “They’re literally going to war over the ministry’s decision to make Muggle Studies mandatory at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Figuratively.” Harry corrected, walking towards her.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“They’re going to war <em>figuratively</em>. Severus wouldn’t wage a <em>literal</em> war against Arthur.”</p>
<p>“Merlin!  You sound just like him.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s been three years already.”</p>
<p>Molly eyed him thoughtfully. “You should marry him, dear.”</p>
<p>Harry halted mid-step. “I can’t. Severus isn’t ready.”</p>
<p>“But <span>you</span> <span>are</span>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“Then say something. Marry him anyway. Don’t let Severus’ monsters become yours, or they’ll defeat you both, Harry.”</p>
