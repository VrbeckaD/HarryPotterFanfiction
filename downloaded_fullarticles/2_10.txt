<h4> </h4><p>____________________</p><p>Lord Voldemort paced outside of his bedroom door as he waited for his Elven wife to give birth to their son, Salem Salazar Riddle if it was a boy or Syndra Salazar Riddle if it was a girl, they agreed to call the babe.</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy, a healer who was helping with the birth, peaked her head out of the door.</p><p>" My Lord, the baby has been born, you may come in now. " She said.</p><p>The Lord goes into the room where his elven wife, Aelinor, sat on the bed holding a baby boy. She smiles weakly at him.</p><p>" Meet your son, Tom.." The babe had a tuff of black hair on his head, his ears were slightly pointed.</p><p>He smiles softly, and goes to sit on the bed with them.</p><p>____________________</p><p> </p><p>James Potter held Lily Potter's hand as she tried her best to push the baby out.</p><p>"You're doing great, Lils." He said, but his word was drowned out by Lily screams.</p><p>After a short while, they heard panting from Lily as the baby was finally out of her stomach, but they didn't hear the baby..</p><p>" James.. My baby... Where's my baby..?" Lily panted.</p><p>" I-i don't know, Lils... "</p><p>" Mr. and Mrs. Potter, a word please?" A healer said.</p><p>" Is there something wrong with our baby?"</p><p>The healer sighed, " Your baby has gone through a stillbirth, Saint. Mungos sends our condolences. "</p><p>" M-my baby is dead..? " Lily had started sobbing and James pulls her into his chest.</p><p>____________________</p><p>«-(¯'v'¯)-« 𝒮𝑒𝓅𝓉𝑒𝓂𝒷𝑒𝓇 30, 1980 »-(¯'v'¯)-»</p><p>____________________</p><p> </p><p>Aelinor sat in a rocking chair in the nursery, breastfeeding her baby.</p><p>Salem was soon done and let go, she pulled her bra and her shirt up. Aelinor put him inside of his crib, not before kissing him on the forehead.</p><p>Aelinor turned around when she felt a presence, that wasn't Tom's, his scent smelt like chocolate this one smelt like roasted nuts , behind her.</p><p>" Who are you and why are you here?"</p><p>Instead of the brown-haired and hazel-eyed male answering with words he cast a spell on her, " <strong>Sectumsempra! </strong> "</p><p>She was blasted back to the wall hitting the floor with a thud, blood gushing out of her stomach.</p><p>The man, who is identified by James Potter, picked up the crying baby, he looks behind him and seeing a livid Tom Riddle, he apparates away before Tom could do anything.</p><p>Tom goes over to Aelinor and uses Parseltongue to heal Aelinor.</p><p>"Tom... Tom... he- he took—"</p><p>" I know, My love, I know.. I swear I will get him back.."</p><p>Aelinor cries into Tom's robes.</p><p> </p><p>____________________</p><p>«-(¯'v'¯)-« σcтσвεя 31, 1981 »-(¯'v'¯)-»</p><p>____________________</p><p> </p><p>Today was the day where Tom and Aelinor would get their baby back from the Potter's nasty hands.</p><p>Wormtail had told them where the Potter have been hiding, as they put him a Secret Keeper while they were under the Fidelius Charm, to keep "hidden" from Voldemort, but little did they know that their chosen Secret Keeper was a rat.</p><p>The Dark Lord and Lady walked up to the house of the Potters in Gordic's Hollow. Tom blasted the door away.</p><p>" Lily, take Harry and Violet and go! It's him! I'll hold him off!" (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.)</p><p>" <strong> Avada Kadavra. </strong>"</p><p>" My Lady, go get our child back. "</p><p>" Yes, My Lord. " Aelinor goes after Lily, who was now in the nursery.</p><p>" Not Harry, not Violet, please not Harry!"</p><p>" Stand aside, you silly girl. . . stand aside now. . ."</p><p>"Not Harry. . . not Violet, please no, take me, kill me instead —"</p><p>" Not Harry! Please. . . have mercy. . . have mercy. . . " (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban- p.239)</p><p>" <strong> Avada Kadavra.</strong> "</p><p>Lily fell to the floor, her bright red hair falling all over her face.</p><p>She picked Salem out of the crib and held him close.</p><p>" <strong> Avada Kedavra.</strong> " She cast on the other baby. The spell rebounded and came after Aelinor, who blocked said curse with powerful Elfish magic, leaving the baby unconscious and nothing but a lightning bolt scar on her forehead.</p><p>She headed quickly back downstairs where Tom was waiting.</p><p>" Tom, my boy, put Harry Potter down, let us talk about this." A voice came from behind them, they turned to see who it was.</p><p>" Do not call me your boy, I am and never will be your boy, there is no Harry Potter, this is my heir, not the Potter's." Tom sneered.</p><p>Dumbledore sighs and pulls his wand out, Tom and Aelinor apparates before Dumbledore could do anything.</p><p>Tom took that disgusting glamor of his son, black messy hair and the Killing Curse green eyes, but he did make sure to write it up and lock it away.</p><p>" Mama? Papa? " Salem spoke.</p><p>Aelinor was shocked and started crying, Tom came over to her and wrapped all three in a hug, soothing her.</p><p>" I- I'm sorry. . . but we missed our baby saying his first words, him walking— " She was sobbing by now.</p><p>" I know, I know.. "</p><p>He held them both close to his chest.</p><p> </p><p>____________________</p><p>αυgυsт 14, 1986</p><p>sαℓεм ιs ησω 6</p><p>____________________</p><p> </p><p>Salem sat bored in his room, still pouting that he couldn't go to the raid with his father and mother. Draco Malfoy was also there, but there was nothing for the two adolescent boys to do.</p><p>A few minutes later, Salem heard the wards go off. He got up and left the room going down the stairs he saw his Father carrying his Mother, who appeared to be passed out, or even worse dead...</p><p>" Father..? W-what's wrong with Mother..? " Salem hesitantly ask, fearing the worst has happened.</p><p>" Your Mother was hit with a spell that I do not know of, yet, Salem. For now, you need to go back to your room. "</p><p>" Yes, Father.." Salem responded and headed upstairs, back to his room. Tears were ready to fall out of his eyes at any given moment.</p><p>" Sal? Are you okay? " Draco saw the tears in his eyes and was instantly on alert.</p><p>Salem shook his head, he closed his eyes the tears falling out of his eyes, he was soon embraced in a hug.</p><p>" It's alright Sal. You're going to be okay. . ."</p>
