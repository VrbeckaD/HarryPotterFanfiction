    <p>For all intents and purposes, Harry Potter was a very ordinary man. He was tall, but not exceptionally so, nor was he exceptionally handsome. He was skinny, with a thin face, a mess of black hair, and his mother’s green eyes, the only trait he seemed to have inherited from her. Not that he knew much about his parents other than that they died at a horribly young age and left their one year old - with his mother’s eyes and his father’s face - with his sole remaining, and sadly disdainful, relatives. The only notable feature on his otherwise ordinary face, was the jagged scar running like web of cracked pottery from his hairline in a sharp diagonal down his face. As a child he had fancied that it looked rather like a bolt of forked lightning, though the mundanity of life had transformed the dashing lightning bolt of his childhood to the distinctly adult realities of a chipped mug. He’d received ten GCSEs at mostly B grades, he’d even managed two Cs and a B at A-level, and most of his teachers considered him to be a bright and intelligent boy, but he’d never been a particularly diligent student. He’d left school at eighteen and got a job at the bank, which was how he found himself behind a very ordinary desk of a very ordinary branch of a very ordinary bank in Islington.</p>
<p>It was in this bank that, for the first time since he was a baby, something out of the ordinary happened. He was filling out some paperwork for a poor old woman whose pension was struggling to cover the remainder of her mortgage when he became aware of someone else in the room. He looked up, expecting a small woman with sad eyes. Instead, stood in front of him was a man, of a height with himself, with skin like spoiled milk, and a shock of white blonde hair coiffed just-so. Everything about him was sharp, from the jut of his chin and the line of his mouth, to his long, fine fingers adorned with dangerous-looking rings. His suit looked like it cost more than Harry earned in a month, and he seemed to be wearing some kind of cloak, a very dark green that made him look, if possible, even sharper and paler.</p>
<p>“You aren’t Mrs. Reed.” Harry said dumbly. The man seemingly ignored him, but sat down on the pleather chair in front of the desk all the same. “Can I help you?”</p>
<p>“I’m here to collect on your deal.” The man said, disinterestedly.</p>
<p>“My deal?” Harry echoed.</p>
<p>The man finally looked up, something serpentine uncoiling in his cold, grey eyes. “Your soul, for whatever riches and fame you desired at the time.” He paused to look him up and down. “Or, apparently, the lack of riches and abundance of bad fashion sense you received.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his forty quid C&amp;A suit that he was fairly sure he’d only bought because it was on sale, and couldn’t find it in him to be offended. “I’m sorry,” he said after a moment. “Did you say my ‘soul’?”</p>
<p>The man raised a slender brow. “Yes. Is your hearing as bad as your eyesight?”</p>
<p>Harry balked, adjusting his glasses self-consciously. “Are you barmy? Is there someone I can call for you?”</p>
<p>The man continued to look bored as he extracted a small, black, leather-bound notepad from his breast pocket and flipped it open. “Harry Potter, aged twenty-five, orphaned at one and a half, raised by relatives, works in a boring office for a bank whose name doesn’t matter, lives at 12 Grimmauld Place, Islington, London, The United Kingdom, Earth. Is that not you?”</p>
<p>Harry paused, stunned. “Yes, but- how do you know that? Have you got into my bank details?”</p>
<p>“You keep ‘orphaned at one and a half’ in your bank details? That has to be the saddest security question I’ve ever heard.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” The man replied, clearly unconvinced. “I need you to sign a few things, then you’ll be coming with me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not signing anything, and I’m not going anywhere.” Harry protested. “It’s a Tuesday, and it’s 11:30 in the morning. I’m supposed to be in a meeting with Mrs. Reed about defaulting on her payments last month.”</p>
<p>“Great confidentiality there, Mr. Potter, you really must be the best and brightest of your profession.” The man replied dryly. “But I’m sure they’ll manage without your brilliance.”</p>
<p>“Look,” Harry said, growing increasingly irate. “If you’re peddling some religious bullshit, I’m not interested. I don’t believe in homeopathy or scientology, I’ve never been baptised and I don’t believe in God, so unless you’d like a quote on a mortgage, get out of my office!”</p>
<p>The man rolled his eyes and flipped a page of his notebook disinterestedly. “Of course you’ve never been baptised, I have it down here as Jatakarma and Namakarana, though the name isn’t much of a giveaway on that front.”</p>
<p>Harry finally snapped and slammed his hand down on the table. The man’s small and all but imperceptible flinch was almost worth it. “Get out!”</p>
<p>The man frowned and glanced at his watch. “It’s a good thing I have other things to do today.” When he stood up the chair gave an undignified squeak. “I’ll be back, Potter.”</p>
<p>With that the man melted into fine smoke before disappearing entirely right in front of Harry’s eyes. He stood in stunned silence for a moment before the door burst open, and a decidedly distressed woman rushed in.</p>
<p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>“Harry? We heard raised voices, are you alright?” Hermione said looking around the room for some sign of a scuffle, before cocking her head at him questioningly.</p>
<p>Harry, still staring at the spot where the man had been standing only moments ago, nodded shakily in reply.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Eyes snapping back to Hermione he nodded again more firmly. “Uh, yeah. Just had a bad … phone call.”</p>
<p>Hermione glanced at the phone, then back at Harry before nodding in return. “Okay. Just let me know if it’s anything HR should know about.”</p>
<p>“Will do, ‘Mione. Thanks though.”</p>
<p>With a wary smile, she smoothed back a small mass of errant curls that had escaped their kirby grip confines in her alarm and neatened her blouse before turning to leave, but paused as she reached the doorway. “Oh, Ron wanted to know if you were still coming to dinner Friday night?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, should be.” Harry replied, scratching the back of his neck. It wasn’t like he had anything better to do, except possibly be mauled by his absent godfather’s horrible cat.</p>
<p>Hermione’s smile brightened and she left him to his thoughts.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrs. Reed did eventually turn up, she had been waylaid by a mysterious stranger who had wanted to talk to her for a very long time about what had made her happy that morning, yet somehow it had turned into a conversation about God and morality, and before she knew it she had been stood there talking to the pale gentleman for an hour and a half. Harry tried as best he could not to think about how much of a coincidence it was that he too had been having an odd conversation with a pale gentleman not ten minutes after Mrs. Reed had discovered how very late she was going to be for her appointment. In fact, he tried not to think about that gentlemen so much that all he did for the rest of the day was think about the feeling of his cold, calculating eyes, and the way it seemed that his menacing grin was the last thing still floating in the air as the rest of him had dissipated into nothingness. Even his walk home was consumed by the unnerving feeling that he was being watched. He fumbled with the key in the large, Edwardian front door, and all but slammed the door shut behind him, putting the door on the latch as he did so.</p>
<p>Harry had moved out of his Aunt and Uncle’s the day he turned eighteen. His estranged godfather had died when he was fifteen and left him his family’s Islington flat. He’d only met the man once or twice, he’d been to prison and Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have him within ten feet of Privet Drive, so he had met with the strange man in a park at night which, in hindsight, was a stupidly dangerous thing to do, but Sirius had been warm and affectionate with Harry in a way his blood family never had been, so it was worth the near-death experience for that alone. They had exchanged letters for a couple of years, but after a period of silence he’d received a different letter from his godfather's solicitor informing him of his death, and of Harry’s future inheritance. When he first moved out he had been thrilled to have his own place in London-proper, but his excitement turned to contempt the moment he stepped into the place. It was old and disused, probably not lived in for as long as Harry had been alive. It was damp and smelled distinctly of cat urine. He had spent a lot of the money his parents had left him - which was more than most twenty-somethings could leave a child, though Harry was certain most of it had come from his late grandparents - to fix up the place, but it still never really felt like home.</p>
<p>As he hung up his coat by the door, he heard a strangled yowl from the kitchen and sighed. He trudged over to see an angry ball of scraggly hair hissing at him from under the kitchen table.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. I’ll feed you in a minute.” He grumbled at the cat as he pulled the tin of food from the fridge. “I don’t know why I bother, you’ll be dead in a week if I’m lucky.”</p>
<p>The cat hissed again and backed away further under the table at the clatter of the food bowl on the counter. Kreacher, as his collar informed Harry when he first sunk his claws into his arm seven years ago, unfortunately, came with the place. Harry had tried to donate him to a shelter when he’d first discovered the source of the cat piss aroma, but the sodding thing made its way back the next day, hissing and scratching when Harry tried to come near to kick him out again.</p>
<p>Harry dropped the bowl of fishy mush as close to the cat as he dared and made his way back to the living room, collapsing onto the nearest sofa. It had been a strange day to say the least. There was a significant part of him that was convinced the whole thing had been some boredom-induced hallucination. Perhaps his childhood trauma was finally manifesting itself in the form of a demonic tax collector who dressed like some kind of Eton schoolboy.</p>
<p>“Prick.” he said out loud.</p>
<p>“Rude.” Came a reply.</p>
<p>Harry all but fell off the sofa, looking up to see the man from before lounging casually in the armchair next to him.</p>
<p>“You!” Harry cried. “I’m actually going mad. Fully and completely mad.”</p>
<p>The man sighed. “No, Potter, you’re not mad, just in debt.”</p>
<p>“How did you even get in?”</p>
<p>Kreacher, intrigued by the commotion, made his way warily over to the armchair, sniffed the man twice, then promptly began to purr, rubbing his matted body against a very expensive trouser leg.</p>
<p>Harry balked. “Traitor!”</p>
<p>The man smirked, despite the hair now adorning his suit. “The cat has good taste, Potter, what can I say?”</p>
<p>“You still haven’t answered my question. How did you get into my house?”</p>
<p>The man sighed and crossed one leg over the other leisurely. “I teleported, like I did in and out of your office this morning. One of the perks of the job; I don’t have to deal with public transport.”</p>
<p>The smile he shot Harry was lazy and cruel, and it made him very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“So you’re the Devil, then?” Harry asked slowly.</p>
<p>The man laughed sharply, making Kreacher jump with alarm and run, hissing under the coffee table. “Me? The Devil? You think that the reigning Lord of Light would come to collect your pathetic soul himself?”</p>
<p>“Lord of Light?”</p>
<p>Rolling his eyes the man began to count on his fingers flamboyantly. “Lucifer, Iblis, Mara, Erlik, Kölski, Ahriman, Woland, Mephistopheles, The Old Serpent, The Stranger, call him what you will, you know who I mean.”</p>
<p>Harry frowned. “You expect me to believe that you’re the actual Devil?”</p>
<p>The man sneered in return. “Did you listen to a word I just said? Are you dense? Is my sarcasm too subtle for you? No, I am not the Devil himself, the Lord does not care about you enough to come himself.”</p>
<p>“So you’re just a lackey.” Harry replied, decidedly unimpressed.</p>
<p>The man - demon, Harry supposed - hissed furiously, his face darkening, smoke beginning to curl out from between his teeth menacingly. “Listen here, you insufferable creature, you vile worm, you insignificant piece of dirt! I am a demon of the highest degree, my pedigree is impeccable, I am more powerful than you could possibly imagine, and I’m here to collect your soul. There is nothing you can do about it.”</p>
<p>“Put your forked tongue away, you’re not that scary.” Harry said with more confidence than he was really feeling. “You’re barely six feet tall. It looks like a small breeze would blow you over. You look like you might expire any minute.”</p>
<p>“What does it matter how tall I am?” The demon said incredulously, his face returning to its human visage. “I’m taller than you! Besides, a demon comes to collect your soul and you’re sassing him? You’re sassing the demon?”</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. ‘<em> I know where you live and all about your dead parents </em>’, if that surprises you then you really don’t know me very well at all, do you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not here to be your friend, Potter, I’m here to collect your debt. You work in a bank, surely that should be familiar to you.”</p>
<p>“I never sold my soul.” Harry replied through gritted teeth, ignoring the barb, “I never made a pact with the devil or any of his lackeys.” He looked pointedly at the demon who bristled in way not dissimilar to the cat still curled up under the table. “So piss off and find someone else to bother.”</p>
<p>The demon hissed again. “He sent me himself, you know. He doesn’t make mistakes, so you’re going to sign these papers and you’re going to come with me before I have to drag you there myself!”</p>
<p>Harry raised a brow. “I thought you said that I wasn’t important enough for the Devil himself to be interested?”</p>
<p>“I said that you weren’t <em> important </em> enough for him to <em> come here </em>himself. Your hearing really is as bad as your eyesight.”</p>
<p>Having had quite enough, Harry leant back on the sofa and waved the demon away ineffectually. “I don’t care. I didn’t sell my soul. Go and double-check if you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>The demon’s eyes narrowed as he dissipated, leaving Harry alone again. Kreacher mewled from under the table and Harry glared back at him. “Fat lot of good you did. Purr for the demon, why don’t you, you useless mog.”</p>
<p>This time the demon reappeared in the chair with a crack like a cherry bomb, and a smug look adorning his features. “You were right about not selling your soul, but someone else did it for you, so it doesn’t matter much either way.”</p>
<p>“Who sold my soul for me?” Harry cried in alarm. “When? Why?”</p>
<p>The demon smirked and tapped the side of his sharp nose. “That’s under client confidentiality I’m afraid. Unlike you, Potter, I wasn’t raised in a barn and know how confidentiality works. It’s all about professionalism in this job.”</p>
<p>“Job? Do you get paid for this? What, did you go to uni? Study ‘<em> soul collecting 101 </em>’? Professionalism, my arse! You’re a bloody loan shark at best!”</p>
<p>“Are you sassing me again?” The demon asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“No, I’m offering you tea and biscuits before you drag my soul to Hell for all eternity.” Harry said, his voice rising to a panicked pitch. “Yes, I’m sassing you! I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that, firstly, demons exist, and secondly, one of them is currently sat in my living room because someone else sold my soul to the Devil!”</p>
<p>The demon was silent for a moment, somewhat taken aback by this outburst, before smirking and removing a roll of parchment from the inside of his ridiculous cloak. “Well bully for you, Potter, but I don’t have time for your hysterics. I just need you to sign this, then it’ll all be over. For me, at least.”</p>
<p>Harry was about to reach out and take the parchment from him when he paused. “Wait, if my soul is already sold, why do I have to sign something?”</p>
<p>The demon suddenly seemed a lot less smug than he had done only seconds before. “You didn’t sign the original contract, and you’re not dead yet.” He said between clenched teeth. "He wants your soul now, so signing the contract over to you is the easiest way of going about things.”</p>
<p>“What if I don’t sign it?” Harry said, folding his arms across his chest.</p>
<p>The demon frowned. “You have to sign it.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you do.”</p>
<p>“You can’t make me.”</p>
<p>“Yes I bloody can!”</p>
<p>“I have free will, and surely a contract forcibly signed isn’t valid? Or doesn’t your professionalism stretch that far?”</p>
<p>Smoke began to curl lazily from the corner’s of the demon’s mouth again as the parchment in his fist began to crumple. “You are going to come with me whether you like it or not, Potter!”</p>
<p>“Well, if you need me to sign something of my own free will, something that I refuse to sign, then I think you’ll find that I won’t, actually.”</p>
<p>The demon’s eyes flared angrily with brilliant silver flames, and the hiss that emanated from him sounded distinctly reptilian. “You’re going to regret this, Potter!”</p>
<p>With that he disappeared again and Harry was left not quite sure whether or not he could count that as a win, or even if any of that had been real. He staggered up to the bathroom to take his temperature, but when the thermometer showed a healthy thirty-five degrees, and a quick inspection of his tongue and eyes in the mirror showed no signs of coating, infection, or jaundice, he sat down heavily on the closed toilet lid.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p><br/> The next morning Harry tried his best to put the recent strangeness out of his mind, putting on one of his many plain suits, in one of the many dark, muted colours he owned. It wasn’t fashionable, he’d never been fashionable, but then when you grew up wearing your much-larger cousin’s grotty hand-me-downs a selection of suits from the high street was a pretty big step up in itself. He looked at his reflection as he tied his tie as neatly as possible, noticing the dark circles under his eyes, and sighed. Not exactly a pretty sight, but no one who came into his office really cared how he looked, which was part of the problem, Harry supposed. He glanced at his watch and swore, grabbing his rucksack from the bed and jumping over an irate Kreacher who hissed at Harry as he slammed the door behind him.</p>
<p>The bank was a twenty minute walk from Grimmauld Place if you were to take your time, but somehow Harry always managed to leave late enough to have to rush. He did an awkward half-jog past several bus-stops worth of people, none of whom paid him any mind, but as he slowed to a walk, catching his breath, he felt a strange prickling on the back of his neck, as though someone were watching him. He paused to look back, but the people around him had their eyes fixed on their phone screens and on the pavement at their feet as they too hurried to jobs they were undoubtedly as late for as Harry was.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Harry continued on down the street, crossing the road by an old phone repair shop, making sure to look both ways before stepping out. But as his foot left the pavement Harry felt the ground fall away beneath him, a swooping darkness filling his vision as he lurched forwards. He tried to catch himself, his hands reaching out for ground that simply wasn’t there, met instead with a sickening lurch as he tumbled further into the darkness. This couldn’t be happening, reality didn’t simple crumble away to nothing. He was having a stroke, perhaps, or a fit of some kind, and he had to snap out of it. In the distance he heard a rumble of something large, growing louder and louder. The great rumbling creature screamed at him, and Harry screamed back. As he did, he felt the sudden bite of gravel underneath his hands and a great flood of light. He blinked desperately as his eyes re-adjusted to the brightness, the colours of his surroundings swirling into view, and became suddenly aware that the rumbling he had heard was no creature, but instead a great double decker bus hurtling towards him, its horn screeching at him to move. Harry threw himself backwards as the bus blew past him, missing him by mere inches.</p>
<p>“Damn, thought I had you there.” Came a decidedly demonic voice from the pavement just behind where he had miraculously managed to avert death by speeding bus. “You should really watch where you’re going.”</p>
<p>Scrambling to his feet Harry turned to face the veritable ghost of a man leaning against one of the many sticker endowed bike rails that lined the street behind him. “Are you trying to kill me?” He shouted indignantly.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The demon replied lazily. “That is rather the point.”</p>
<p>“I said I won’t sign your damn papers!”</p>
<p>The demon shot Harry a disparaging look. “I know, that’s why I’m trying to kill you. Do keep up, Potter.”</p>
<p>“I thought I needed to sign your paper first?” Harry replied, slowly.</p>
<p>“No, I said that getting you to sign the contract was the easiest way of going about things,” the demon said, picking at his neatly manicured nails distractedly. “Not the only way. You wouldn’t sign, so now you have to die. It was your choice, really.”</p>
<p>Harry growled. “No it bloody well wasn’t! None of this was my choice!”</p>
<p>“That’s not my problem.” He replied with a shrug. “My problem is making sure you get to Hell one way or another.”</p>
<p>Words dying on his tongue at that, Harry simply stalked away, as though somehow distance would stop the demon’s efforts. Instead he seemed to float up behind him like some deadly Cheshire cat, his smile decidedly smug. “Now, Potter, where do you think you’re going? That’s not the way to that dingy little office of yours.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m going home to change into something not covered in muck. I’ll probably have to throw this suit away, so thanks for that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hades forbid you have to get rid of that nasty polyester suit!” He replied with mocking horror. “However will you survive it? If I knew breaking you was that easy I would have simply burnt down your wardrobe!”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up, you prick!” Harry spun around to grab the bastard by his stupid cloak, but the demon just cackled and melted into smoke once more, leaving Harry stood on the pavement, furious, dirty, and terribly late for work.</p>
<p>When he finally stormed into the office half an hour later Hermione was hovering by his door, concern marring her features. “Harry, you’re half an hour late! I covered for you and said that you’d come in early so I’d sent you on an errand, but I’m not making a habit of it!”</p>
<p>Harry sighed and wilted into his cheap office chair. “Thanks, Hermione. Don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p>
<p>She shook her head and smiled warmly. “You’d be lost, I know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days passed with little excitement, it seemed as though the demon had given up on him, either that or his near-death by speeding bus had shocked him to his senses. The more Harry thought about it, the more it was simply logical that he was having some kind of episode. No one in the street that day had taken any notice of the demon, or even Harry’s near-accident, so it seemed that Harry was the only one to see him. Perhaps he was working too hard, perhaps he had an underlying mental health issue, or perhaps he really had had some sort of stroke. Regardless of exactly what had caused it, it seemed to Harry that the logical conclusion was that he had been hallucinating the strange man, and that if he reappeared Harry would simply have to see a doctor about it. After all, as scary a prospect as it was at twenty-seven, a stroke was infinitely more likely than an actual demon not only existing, but appearing to take his soul to the Devil himself.</p>
<p>As it turned out there was a certain comfort in knowing that you were slowly going mad. Madness was medical. Madness was treatable. Madness was a tangible fact of life that that had been a part of the human experience for millennia, and something that Harry found he wasn’t that afraid of. His work days were less stressful in that knowledge, and it was refreshing. For a short while at least.</p>
<p>“Hello again, Potter.” The demon’s voice said, drifting over to him from the corner of his office.</p>
<p>Harry pointedly ignored him. Engaging in hallucinations was not healthy, if he ignored him, he would eventually go away. If not he would make an appointment with the GP and then, with a handful of pills, he would go away.</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore me, you ingrate!” The demon spat.</p>
<p>Harry sighed and continued to painstakingly fill out a form in black biro that apparently was still required to be in physical, despite the fact that no one had used the fax machine in the staff room for a decade at least.</p>
<p>“Hades, this looks dull.” The demon continued. “Are you seriously having to put effort into concentrating on that?”</p>
<p>Harry could feel the demon peering over his shoulder, but he continued to ignore him as best he could.</p>
<p>“I suppose someone with as little cognitive ability as yourself would really <em> have </em> to put in the effort to get even the most mundane of tasks finished.”</p>
<p>The room was quiet again, but for the gentle scratch of ballpoint on cheap paper. There was a gentle whoosh of air and the demon was suddenly sat on his desk, blocking Harry’s light enough that he was forced to put the pen down and look up.</p>
<p>“Can you please let me finish my work, or I’ll have to skip lunch again, which is undoubtedly making this whole thing worse.” He asked, as calmly as possible.</p>
<p>The demon raised a silvery brow. “Trying to be diplomatic, Potter?”</p>
<p>“Trying to do my job.”</p>
<p>“That makes two of us then.” He replied toothily. “Sadly there aren’t many ways to kill you in this dingy little room. There isn’t even an air conditioning unit to drop on your head and put you out of your bureaucratic misery.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed and moved the papers into better light. “You could strangle me with that ancient corded phone? Or perhaps drown me in the water cooler just outside? How about ramming enough pens down my throat that I choke to death, hmm?”</p>
<p>“Hells, Potter, you’re morbid today. I might not even need to try with you, sounds like you’ve thought about offing yourself in far more creative ways than I have. You could just sign the papers and then you wouldn’t even need to die.”</p>
<p>Putting the pen down again, Harry levelled the demon with an deadpan look. “<em> I wouldn’t even need to die </em>, how pleasant, I’ll just sit in eternal damnation instead, hooray.”</p>
<p>“I never said anything about damnation, just Hell.”</p>
<p>“Apparently I have a more vivid imagination than I thought. I should have been an artist. Aren’t lots of Schizophrenics artists?”</p>
<p>The demon paused. “Are you- Do you think this is all in your head?”</p>
<p>Harry cocked his head to the side slightly. “Well, you say you’re a demon, which is ridiculous, and no one else has seemed to notice you, despite you appearing to be able to fly, which is usually something people would notice on a busy street in London. So, logically, you must be a figment of my imagination. Though why my brain would concoct a posh, mouthy git to follow me around, I have no idea.”</p>
<p>The demon was silent for a moment, before looking Harry dead in the eyes and knocking the pot of pens off the edge of the desk. Harry frowned, but before he could open his mouth to speak the demon pushed the stack of papers off the desk as well, then he picked up the phone and dropped it dramatically next to the massacred stationary on the ugly scrub carpet.</p>
<p>“Could your imaginary demon concoction do that?” He asked triumphantly.</p>
<p>Harry raised a brow. “What? Knock things off my desk like an irritable cat? I suppose not, but then that could all be in my head too. All of this could be in my head. I could be catatonic in a hospital somewhere having been hit by a bus, stuck in this insane nightmare, who knows!”</p>
<p>The demon’s nostrils flared with annoyance. He leant over the desk purposefully and grabbed a fistful of Harry’s shirt, pulling him out of his chair. “This real enough for you, Potter?”</p>
<p>Harry’s huff of laughter disturbed a lock of the demon’s hair, white strands falling into his eyes, causing him to become even more incensed. Harry couldn’t help but laugh some more. He was sure that his colleagues would have him institutionalised before he could do it himself, but the dishevelled creature in front of him was almost too funny to bear.</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh at me!” He demanded, throwing Harry backwards into his chair again, smoke beginning to coil out from between his clenched teeth. “You’re insane, that’s for bloody sure, but not because I’m here. I was going to try and make it painless for you, Potter, but no one laughs at me and gets away with it. I’ll be seeing you.”</p>
<p>With that he evaporated into nothingness once more, leaving Harry still laughing to himself in the cold, artificial light of his cramped office space. Harry took this peaceful opportunity to finish his paperwork and make an appointment with his GP before heading out to fax his forms to whichever dinosaur had decided they were still using fax machines.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The demon made an appearance at least once a day after that, trying to trip him in the street, turning his gas on while he was asleep, or just lying across his desk becoming increasingly irate as Harry continued to ignore him. His doctor’s appointment was only a week away, and Harry was so looking forward to having his mind to himself again. His improved mood had actually given his work ethic a boost as well, and he found himself more productive with just the thought of being free of his pesky, posh poltergeist. He had even forgone his usually disparaging thoughts about his fax recipient when, as he turned the corner, he bumped into Hermione, dropping them all to the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh, Harry.” She said apologetically as she helped him gather up his fallen papers. She paused as she handed them to him in a neat stack, considering his face carefully. “You look happy today.”</p>
<p>“Do I?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” She said with a gentle smile. “It’s nice. You’ve seemed so down lately, I was beginning to worry about you.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled back. “Yeah, I’ve been having some issues, but I’m getting it sorted, and I’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s burgeoning frown was concerned, but not pitying. “Oh, Harry, you know if you’re having problems you can always talk to me or Ron. We care about you. You don’t have to keep things from us, whether it’s health or relationships.”</p>
<p>It was Harry’s turn to frown. “Relationships?”</p>
<p>“Harry, really?” She admonished, parental disappointment in her tone. “I’m talking about the man who’s been visiting your office lately. He was there just this morning.”</p>
<p>Harry froze. “What man?”</p>
<p>“Thin, blonde, quite handsome if you like aristocratic types.” She said lightly. “You two seemed very … close.”</p>
<p>“You could see him?” He could feel the panic rising in his chest, wrapping its tendrils round his throat.</p>
<p>“Of course. Your office blinds were open.” She raised a brow. “Harry, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Fine, just fine.” He replied, his voice no more than a squeak.</p>
<p>“Harry, if you were having some kind of office romance and happened to forget to close the blinds, I didn’t see anything untoward. I can’t say the same for anyone else, but you should really be more careful next time.”</p>
<p>“Next time?” Harry squawked. “Romance?”</p>
<p>“Not that it isn’t good that you’re moving on, and exploring new romantic avenues, so to speak.” She assured him. “But it’s sort of against policy, and not strictly legal.”</p>
<p>She considered his stricken expression sadly for a moment before taking his free hand in hers. “I’m happy for you, Harry, I just wish you’d talk to us about these things. I know we’re busy, but we really do care.”</p>
<p>Harry simply nodded mutely as Hermione squeezed his hand reassuringly before letting go and making her way back to her own office, leaving him standing dumbly in the middle of the corridor, faxes all but forgotten.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stormed out of the office that lunchtime, equal parts furious and bewildered that his apparent hallucination wasn’t that much of a hallucination after all. Instead of parking himself on a bench in Russell Square like he might have done on any other given day, Harry simply kept walking, his mind spinning.</p>
<p>Okay, so he would perhaps have to cancel his doctor’s appointment, and come to terms with the fact that there really might be a demon after his soul, and he might have actually been in danger of dying this entire time, but had been too flippant to acknowledge it. While it was comforting to know that he wasn’t going insane, the panic that had wound its way around his chest, coiling itself through his ribs until he could barely breathe, was only tightening its grip as he stalked down the street.</p>
<p>Real demon. Right. Real demon that other people could see and was definitely not just his imagination. Real demon that was really trying to kill him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As he passed a clothes shop that was playing obnoxiously loud music something in the next window gave him pause. He took a few slow steps backwards to the window of a shop he was fairly certain he had never known existed. In the display were several wooden and stone statues of grotesque leafy faces and naked women, draped in velvet and surrounded by melted candles, glinting crystals, and books on Wicca and modern day magic. Harry glanced up at the sign above the door, it read ‘<em> Asteria </em> ’ with a tagline below that said ‘ <em> one stop occult shop </em>’.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t exactly certain it was serendipity, but it was a close thing. Pausing for just a second to gather his thoughts he pushed the door open and stepped inside. Predictably the shop smelled of incense, potent and pungent, something like patchouli and sage. All around the room were shelves of books and wicker baskets of trinkets and stones, circular mirrors, bundles of sticks and dried flowers, and a lot of candles. There was a young woman behind the counter, exceptionally pretty with a pierced nose and brightly coloured hair, reading a book during what must have been a lull in business. The bells above the door tinkled as it closed behind him and the girl looked up, shooting him a practiced customer-service smile.</p>
<p>“Hi, welcome to Asteria, is there anything I can help you with today?”</p>
<p>“Hi,” Harry began awkwardly. “Sorry if this sounds like a weird question, but do you have anything on demons?”</p>
<p>The girl frowned. “We don’t really deal with demonology and dark magic here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I don’t want to do any dark magic, I want to protect myself from it.”</p>
<p>Her face brightened considerably at this. “Oh, we can definitely help with that! Protection is my speciality.”</p>
<p>With that she abandoned her book entirely and hurried out from behind the counter, beckoning for Harry to follow her. She hummed quietly to herself as she picked up bits and pieces from the shelves and cradled them in the crook of her arm.</p>
<p>“Okay, so first of all I’m going to suggest you wear this pendant.” She said, handing him a sleek, black crystal on a faux-leather band. “It’s black tourmaline, great for repelling low-level negative energies throughout the day.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded along silently, traipsing after her as she flitted from shelf to shelf light an overzealous hummingbird.</p>
<p>“And you should keep this labradorite in your pocket at all times to shield yourself from psychic attacks.” She placed a small iridescent stone next to the pendant, then another shard of blue stone shaped like the first. “And it’ll work even better with this flourite to shield your aura so that the demon can’t find your energy signals.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at the small pile of rocks in his hand skeptically. “Uhuh.”</p>
<p>“Now, these are great to get you started, but if you’re having real demon trouble, you’re going to need to ward your house too. We don’t have any in stock at the moment, but there are certain minerals and herbs that are excellent protection against evil spirits and entities. I’ll make you a list!” She hopped back behind the counter and clicked her pen enthusiastically as she began to write something on the back of an open envelope. “You’ll want to put a line of this across your doorway and all the entryways into your home; windows, fireplaces, ventilation shafts, all of them.”</p>
<p>She chewed on the end of the pen thoughtfully before scribbling something else down and then passing him a long, green candle from the shelf behind her head. “This is to break a curse. Now, do you have a cauldron?” Harry shook his head and she shrugged. “Eh, a casserole dish will do if you have one of those.”</p>
<p>As Harry listened to the girl describing rituals and spells, and piling increasing numbers of supposedly magical items into his hands, he felt a growing sense of bewilderment. He left the shop with a canvas bag full of his occult items and a significant dent in his month’s budget, but as heavy as his pockets felt, his heart felt lighter. The rest of the work day passed without incident, and Harry rushed home at five, only stopping at the corner shop to pick up the last of his ritual ingredients.</p>
<p>Closing and locking the door behind him, Harry emptied the contents of his bags onto the coffee table unceremoniously and rifled through them, a feeling of triumph and glee washing over him as he lit the first candles. That demon was going to rue the day he messed with Harry Potter.</p>
