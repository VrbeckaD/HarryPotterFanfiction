    <p>Scorpius sighed dreamily, staring out the window as the train steamed away from the station. Through the glass, he watched as the snow-covered rooftops and towers of Hogwarts receded, not to be seen again until the next term.   </p>
<p>His heart gave a slight twinge at the thought of the long, solitary weeks that were looming in front of him. While growing up in a sprawling manor in the English countryside might seem idyllic, Scorpius knew the truth. Behind the elegant gardens and the impressive stonework were echoing corridors and dark, empty rooms. And loneliness. Crushing loneliness.          </p>
<p>Instinctively, he turned to look at the seat his best friend usually occupied. Albus had gone looking for the trolley witch, hoping that their escapades at the beginning of the year wouldn’t keep her from selling him some Pumpkin Pasties.        </p>
<p>Scorpius turned back to the window, smiling contentedly as he watched snowflakes streaming past the glass. He had always believed that winter was the prettiest season. It wasn’t his favorite; he got sick too often to fully enjoy the frigid, snow-filled months. But there was something in the delicate lacework of ice clinging to fragile tree limbs, and the way dappled moonlight fell on sparkling white ground that struck a chord in him.</p>
<p>The compartment door slid open with a metallic rasp. Without turning around, Scorpius said, “Even if she did sell them to you, I’m not eating any. Wouldn’t put it past her to give us the exploding variety.”</p>
<p>When Albus didn’t answer, Scorpius turned around. “I’m totally serious―” His voice died in his throat. It wasn’t Albus standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>The expression on Rose’s face was an odd mixture of awkward determination as she stood at the threshold.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I was looking for my cousin,” she said, staring fixedly at Scorpius’s shoulder. “Do you know where he is?”</p>
<p>“Uh . . . I’m not sure,” Scorpius said slowly, his brain spinning. “But,” he added, smiling shyly at her, “he’ll probably be back soon. If you wanted to wait for him.”</p>
<p>Rose’s mouth twitched slightly, her nose wrinkling with the barest hint of contempt. “Thank you . . . but no. I’ll―stop by later, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Scorpius’s heart and face plummeted. “Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay.” He turned back to the window, hiding the flush that he could feel slowly creeping up his face and neck. Of course she wouldn’t wait. She could barely stand to breathe the same air as him, let alone make polite conversation.</p>
<p>The compartment door slid shut with a soft <em>thunk</em>, and Scorpius swallowed hard, willing himself not to cry. He was almost fifteen years old, dammit. And besides, what was a little rejection when, just a few months ago, he’d had the Cruciatus Curse used on him by an insane, murderous Dark witch?  </p>
<p>. . . Sometimes, though, he thought he’d be willing to brave the Cruciatus Curse every day if it meant Rose would like him. Or at least not look at him like rotten fish.</p>
<p>He exhaled forcefully, leaning forward to press his forehead against the icy glass. Closing his eyes, he listened to the rhythmic movement of the wheels on the tracks. <em>Schick-schick-schick-schick, schick-schick-schick-schick, schick-schick-schick-schick.</em>     </p>
<p>“You know, you’re not very observant.”        </p>
<p>Scorpius jumped and turned sharply to see Rose sitting on the edge of the seat closest to the door, observing him with a mixture of stiff disapproval and amusement.</p>
<p>“What are you―?”      </p>
<p>“I mean, I could have hit you with any number of jinxes and you wouldn’t have noticed until it was too late.”           </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you . . . I thought you left.”</p>
<p>Rose sniffed. “I figured I might as well wait for Albus. I don’t want to have to walk all the way back here again.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Right.” He and Albus usually ended up with one of the last compartments on the train, away from everyone else. It was just one of the many perks of being them.</p>
<p>“Mmmh.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched between them, dense and awkward. Rose stared at her hands with a closed expression while Scorpius tried not to gawk. Tried and failed. Her hair glinted red and gold in the warm lamplight, and he couldn’t help but notice how many different shades of blue her eyes were.</p>
<p>His heart gave another spasm, painful longing flaring up inside his chest. He opened his mouth to say something, then shut it quickly. He didn’t need a repeat of the bread incident.</p>
<p>Apparently, Rose was thinking along the same lines. “No comment on my perfume today?”</p>
<p>He smiled reflexively, trying to ignore the way his heart kept somersaulting. “I figured I’d bite my tongue this time, keep you from hating me any more than you already do.”</p>
<p>An odd expression flitted over Rose’s face. Looking unsure, she opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, the compartment door slid open again.</p>
<p>“Okay, so apparently she’s still sore about us jumping off the train, so―”</p>
<p>Albus stopped short at the sight of Rose sitting so uncomfortably in his usual seat.</p>
<p>“Hello.” She stood up quickly, reaching out to steady herself as the train sped around a curve. “Albus.”</p>
<p>“Rose.”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked back and forth between them, trying to decide which one would crack first. On one hand, Albus’s face looked as though it was carved from stone. On the other, Rose’s fingers were laced together so tightly he was surprised that they hadn’t snapped in half.      </p>
<p>He cleared his throat and looked at Albus. “So, no Pumpkin Pasties, I gather?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” Albus replied through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, not surprising.” Scorpius sighed and leaned down to rummage in his bag. “I think I might have a few Cauldron Cakes left over from my birthday.”</p>
<p>Albus snorted, finally turning to look at him fully. “I think I’ll pass on the food poisoning, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come <em>on</em>.” Scorpius flushed slightly. “That was one time.”        </p>
<p>Rose raised an eyebrow. “One time, what?”</p>
<p>Albus sank down beside Scorpius, rolling his eyes. “One time that Scor tried to kill me.”</p>
<p>“Two points. One, I did not and have never tried to intentionally kill you. Two, there was no way for me to know that those cakes were expired.”</p>
<p>“The fact that you’d gotten them for Christmas the year <em>before </em>didn’t tip you off?”</p>
<p>Scorpius made a face at him before sneaking a glance at Rose. Her mouth was quirked slightly, her eyes amused. It was such a departure from the severe looks that usually graced her face, and for a moment, Scorpius lost his breath. He couldn’t help wondering what it would feel like to have her look at him like that.</p>
<p>Forcing himself to take a deep breath, he sat back in his seat. “Well, you’re still alive, so no harm done,” he said to Albus.</p>
<p>“Easy for you to say,” he replied darkly. Then, turning to Rose, he asked, “So, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?”</p>
<p>Her face reverted to its usual mask of stony aloofness. “James sent me to tell you that we’re going straight to the Burrow once the train gets to London.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? We’re not supposed to leave until next week.”</p>
<p>Rose reached into her robes and pulled something from her pocket, which she tossed down on the seat beside her cousin. “He got a letter from your mum last night.”         </p>
<p>Albus snatched up the parchment and scanned it, scowling. “Oh, that’s just fantastic,” he said sourly when he had finished, chucking it back down. “Wonderful.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Scorpius tentatively. “Is everyone okay?” Unwillingly, he thought of his own mother, who was not and would never be okay again.</p>
<p>Albus just shook his head in disgust. “My parents left for France early. They won’t be back until right before term starts.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Rose nodded decisively. “Heavens knows they need a good holiday, especially after what you—” She stopped speaking abruptly, the rest of her sentence hanging heavily in the air between them. Albus flushed angrily.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Rose, thanks for that.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” he replied mockingly. “Being a complete and utter prat?”</p>
<p>Scorpius winced, wishing he could sink into his seat and disappear. He hated it when they fought; their venom and vitriol were aimed at each other, but he was the one who usually ended up being caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>“You are so full of yourself, you know that?” Rose tossed her hair furiously. “You think you’re the only one who gets a bad go of it. My parents are going to France, too, Albus! I get to spend my holiday crammed into a room with your sister and Merlin knows who else! At least you get the attic to yourself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s right,” Albus replied sarcastically. “The wonderful attic, with its drafty windows and pipes and, oh yeah, <em>the ghoul that lives in the ceiling</em>!”</p>
<p>Rose swelled threateningly, but before she could fling another insult, Scorpius interjected quietly, “Even a ghoul sounds like good company when you spend most Christmases alone.”</p>
<p>They both froze, turning to look at him incredulously.</p>
<p>“Alone? Scor, what about your dad?” asked Albus, his brows creased.</p>
<p>Scorpius shifted uncomfortably. “After . . . my mum . . . well, I don’t really see him much on holidays. It’s too hard for him, I think.” He dared to glance at Rose, unsure of what he would see. Of what he wanted to see. But her face was blank, the only remnant of emotion the angry flush that still colored her cheeks and ears.</p>
<p>Albus stood up suddenly and shoved his hands in his pockets, looking ashamed. “I . . . I’m just gonna . . . bathroom . . .” he mumbled, shouldering past his cousin and out the door.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, Rose steadfastly avoided Scorpius’s gaze. She looked like there was anywhere else she’d rather be, and he wondered why she didn’t just leave.</p>
<p>After a time, he said, “You know, this is only going to be weird if you let it be weird.”</p>
<p>Rose laughed, looking surprised. “Using my own lines against me, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>“Well, they’re generally better than the ones I come up with.” He grinned half-heartedly and was rewarded with, if not a laugh, at least a snort.</p>
<p>“Don’t I know it. ‘What’s wrong with bread?’ Honestly,” she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. That can’t be the worst thing someone’s ever said to you. . . . Can it?”</p>
<p>“No, Malfoy, that is not the worst thing someone’s ever said to me. Honestly, it doesn’t even crack the top ten.”</p>
<p>Scorpius made a face. “I don’t think I want to know.”</p>
<p>“No, you really don’t,” she said, sighing. “But then again, I guess you have it worse than me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, as far as I know, I’ve never been accused of being Voldemort’s daughter.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I,” Scorpius joked. He paused. “Well, actually . . .”</p>
<p>Rose’s eyes widened. “Oh, no.”</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Yeah. But you know . . . I’m used to it.”</p>
<p>The train gave a sudden lurch, and Rose, who was still standing by the door, stumbled and collapsed onto the seat.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” she said, but her words were drowned out as a piercing shriek rent the air. The train deaccelerated rapidly, throwing her forward onto the floor and pinning Scorpius against the back of his seat. The entire compartment trembled as the train came to a shuddering halt.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” asked Scorpius anxiously. Something metallic clicked loudly, but he ignored it as he crouched down beside Rose.</p>
<p>She sat up and winced, rubbing her shoulder. “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked at her arm pointedly and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m a little banged up,” she allowed. “But I’ll live. Really. And we have bigger problems.”</p>
<p>If he was being honest with himself, Rose looked more than a little banged up. Her hair, which was excitable even on a good day, was everywhere. An angry red mark marred her forehead, and even though she was trying to hide it, she was holding her arm gingerly.  But leave it to a Gryffindor to shrug off their injuries.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who’s more hardheaded, you or Albus,” he muttered. Shaking his head, Scorpius helped her back onto the seat. “I’m going to go see what’s going on,” he said, grabbing the door handle.</p>
<p>Rose stood right back up, still favoring her shoulder. “I’m going with you.” When Scorpius didn’t respond, she added, “Huh. I thought you’d argue with me.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re hurt?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Two points. One, I’m pretty sure that even if your arm was broken, you’d still be able to beat me into submission.</p>
<p>Rose smiled dryly. “And two?”</p>
<p>Scorpius turned to face her, looking disconcerted. “Neither of us are going anywhere. We’re locked in.”</p>
