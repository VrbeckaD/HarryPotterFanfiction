    <p>Colin's POV</p><p>I remember the first time my parents told me about Harry Potter. He seemed so amazing, and I was hoping that we would become friends. Not everyone can be friends with the bravest boy in the world, you know. I just wanted to get to know him, to collect him almost.</p><p>It was embarrassing when I first met him, I became flustered and started to ramble. I knew that I shouldn't really be taking pictures of him, particularly as I became overbearing. I started to follow Harry around wherever he went, which made him start to resent me.</p><p>What made everything worse is that thoughts of Harry meant I hadn't made much progress. So far, I had only learnt two spells, one of which repaired my camera, whilst the other one was Lumos.</p><p>That all happened in my first year at Hogwarts though. I was currently preparing for my second year, and my nerves were getting the better of me. My mother noticed that I was thinking about something, and knowing her like I did, I was going to have to tell her.</p><p>"Honey" she began "What is going on? You've been acting strangely ever since you got back from Hogwarts"</p><p>"I know" I replied "But I'm not sure what I'm feeling"</p><p>"Is this about Harry Potter, by any chance?" she wondered.</p><p>I was really confused that she got to that conclusion so quickly, but I believed that to be encouraging. As a 12 year old, I was stubborn, and I knew that I would have a lot to learn when it came to life. I struggled to answer, until she put her arm around me.</p><p>"Come on sweetie" she encouraged "Talk to me"</p><p>I looked at my mother, who was in turn becoming increasingly worried about what was happening. She gave me confidence, but in this situation, I was doubting myself. How could I explain anything, I didn't know what was going on?</p><p>"Mum, I made a fool of myself" I stated "I became obsessed with Harry Potter"</p><p>"Do you know why?" she continued "What made you feel like this?"</p><p>"I really don't know" I sighed frustratingly "And it hurts, I don't even know if he wants to talk to me"</p><p>"I know what's happening" she responded "Do you want me to explain?"</p><p>"Please mummy" I replied, feeling weak.</p><p>"It means you have a crush on him" she reacted "People get crushes all of the time"</p><p>I didn't know that boys could get crushes on other boys. I felt like I wasn't normal, which broke my heart. I started crying, feeling like my world was about to crumble around me.</p><p>"I'm sorry" I sobbed.</p><p>"It's okay dear" she assured "You are no different"</p><p>"But I have a crush on Harry Potter!" I cried.</p><p>"Lots of people probably do" she persisted.</p><p>"But they are all girls" I mumbled.</p><p>"Are they really?" she continued "And if they are, that doesn't matter. It would mean I am the mother of the only boy who loves Harry Potter"</p><p>"What do I do?" I posed "I feel so awkward about going back"</p><p>"If he means so much to you, why don't you just tell him?" she suggested.</p><p>"Won't he hate me though?" I enquired.</p><p>"I don't think so" she sighed "But if he does, then he is the one at fault"</p><p>I stared at my mum, feeling like she was the most wonderful person in the world. I knew what I wanted to do, but whether I was also scared of embarrassing myself again.</p>
