    <p>
  <span>He’s distracted when it happens. His stomach is clenched in hunger, and Chastity won’t stop talking about pulling Modesty from school to help with the cause. He’s trying to drown her out, slowing his steps subtly to put some distance between the pair of them. But her words are echoing in his ears, and he’s just so damn hungry. Credence is so busy trying to clear his mind, he doesn’t catch the man coming straight for him until they’re chest to chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence takes in the man’s face briefly, then immediately bows his head and averts his eyes to stare down at the man’s shoes instead. “I’m so sorry. Excuse me,” he says emphatically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man says nothing at first. Credence gives himself permission to quickly glance up from the man’s expensive black leather shoes to his smooth, unreasonably handsome face. He tells himself it’s to assess how much offense he’s caused, but really it’s to look once more at the man’s lips. As soon as he takes in the man’s features—cold and impenetrable as they are—his gaze falls ground-ward again. But not before catching the curious glint in the man’s hard eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevermind it,” the man says brusquely. “The fault is mine. Have a nice afternoon.” Then he’s off, already brushing the metaphorical dust of the encounter off his shoulders, and Credence right along with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence watches him go, staring at the stranger’s face as he crosses the street quickly. Purposefully. Gracefully. It’s the kind of stride Credence knows he’ll never muster. He watches until the man is out of sight, his breathing quick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s one of those moments, those fleeting moments, that plague Credence. A flicker in time when a life Credence knows he can’t have flashes quickly before him, taunting and teasing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>See what you’ll never be?</span>
  </em>
  <span> these moments whisper from the darkest recesses of his mind. </span>
  <em>
    <span>See what you don’t deserve? What you’ll never earn?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But of course, once the man is gone from his view, the moment passes. Credence turns his gaze back to his intended path and begins walking. He has more flyers to pass out before he’s allowed to come home. He’s already wasted precious time. He thinks of the man one more time before carefully locking the image of him safely into a mental box to be considered later in private. Then he goes on his way. Chastity has gone far enough ahead he’s in actual danger of losing her, which won’t go over well with Mother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It doesn’t. Chastity beats Credence home, all her flyers gone while Credence still clings to a small handful, and tells Mother it’s because he was distracted by </span>
  <em>
    <span>a man. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He wants to be angry at her, and a small part of him is. It was none of her business, and he hadn’t done anything overtly inappropriate. But mostly, Credence is indifferent. It was wrong to be so taken by the stranger. He knows this. It was ungodly. He’s not looking forward to the beating that’s sure to come, but he takes it as a logical consequence for the part of him that’s broken. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Mother,” he murmurs. “It won’t happen again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It won’t,” she agrees. “Belt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence doesn’t even consider hesitating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later, when his hand is bleeding and singing with pain, Credence lies in bed and delicately takes the key to the box he had locked his encounter away in, and despite the sharp lesson delivered for it, he replays the short moment over and over. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</span>
  </em>
  <span> But he doesn’t stop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence understands on one level that not every church is like the New Salem Philanthropic Society. That there are men and women of God who carry the same perversion as Credence inside them, but without the shame and guilt. He understands this objectively, but he can’t fathom it. Can’t wrap his head around what it would feel like to wake up every morning and not feel so corrupted. It seems like such a fantasy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes Credence lets himself daydream about having been adopted by some other family when he was young. About being raised outside the church, with a normal parent. Maybe even two parents. He wonders if maybe a different family would have responded a different way to Credence’s issues. His anger. His filth. He doesn’t know if Mother’s approach to faith and child-rearing has helped Credence’s condition or harmed it. Would things have gone differently his freshman year in high school if he’d had a different mother? Or would they have gone much much worse? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Credence thinks too long about it, though, he gets depressed. What’s the use in thinking on such a thing? The reality is that it happened, and he was expelled for it. The role another family may have played in this alternate reality is moot. Besides, Credence knows he’s really rather lucky. At least he </span>
  <em>
    <span>has</span>
  </em>
  <span> a family and a home and food reliably on the table, however little there is. Not everyone can say the same. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence forces himself to refocus on his encounter from the afternoon. He doesn’t know why he’s so fixated on the man he ran into. It’s not like he’s seen him before, and he isn’t likely to see him again. But it’s a much more pleasant thought than his pained hand or his stark living conditions. Because his day has already felt soiled by his indecency, Credence lets himself take it a step further. With his good hand, he takes the thin pillow beneath his head and quietly positions it between his legs so its pressing into his groin. He turns on his side, away from the women he shares this cramped living space with, and thrusts his hips slowly, so slowly, against the material.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The drag of his cock through his underwear and sleep pants and against the pillow is tortuous. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is what I deserve</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Credence tells himself as he silently shifts his hips another centimeter forward. It’s a painful compromise he’s made with himself—indulge in his sinful thoughts but deny himself the pleasure of his own physical touch. If he’s going to do this, it isn’t going to be easy. </span>
  <em>
    <span>You don’t deserve easy.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He thinks of the man whose features he’s un-consentingly using for his own release, and bites into his uninjured knuckles to keep from crying out. He laves pathetically at his own skin and wonders how it would feel to have that man inside of him. If it would hurt. If he </span>
  <em>
    <span>wants</span>
  </em>
  <span> it too. If he would finally feel whole, or if it would only leave him feeling more empty. If he would just feel guilty, as he feels right now rutting against his linens while his sisters sleep only a few feet away. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thinks, </span>
  <em>
    <span>is why God won’t let you leave here. If you’ll do this in His house, what can you be trusted to do outside of it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence thinks of letting an endless parade of men fuck him into the mattress while the stranger from the afternoon watches, and knows he’s fundamentally unwell. But in for a penny, in for a pound. So he lets his mind run wild as he thrusts with such controlled, silent precision it’s a wonder he ever manages to cum at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His seed, when release arrives, scalds his skin where it touches, burning as hot as his shame. Carefully, so very carefully, Credence stands from his cot, takes off the pillow case, and slowly walks to his dresser. He grabs a clean pair of underwear and sleeping pants as quietly as he can, then heads for the bathroom where he shoves his soiled items to the  bottom of the laundry bin. It’s his day to do the laundry tomorrow, which is the only reason Credence let himself indulge that night. It was his best chance to do so without being found out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he’s closing the hamper, Credence finds the tip of his index finger is cold and tacky with a small smear of cum. He doesn’t let himself think too much about it when he draws it to his lips and sucks the top of the digit into his mouth. It’s not the first time he’s tasted himself, but as with every other instance, Credence promises himself it will be his last. He closes his eyes, savoring the moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then, like the afternoon, the moment is over. His finger is wiped hastily dry against his pajama bottoms, and then Credence is climbing back under the covers, head resting against his un-covered pillow, and tucking himself into bed. He puts the encounter out of his mind and locks the box up once more. </span>
