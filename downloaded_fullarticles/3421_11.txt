<p>Picnic with Pudding</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“What’s this? Pudding in the Astronomy Tower after hours? Just because you’re the Golden Trio doesn’t mean you can break the rules.” </p>
<p>Harry sighs. “We’re not—” </p>
<p>“I see what you’re doing.” Severus eyes them. “Having an illicit picnic.” </p>
<p>Hermione coughs. “We saved you cake. Chocolate, right?” She holds up a plate with a piece already sliced. </p>
<p>Severus’ eyes narrow. “Bribery?” </p>
<p>Ron clears his throat. “Er…no?”</p>
<p>“Severus.” Harry smiles. “We invited you, remember? Your staff meeting interfered.” </p>
<p>“Cake, hm?” Severus accepts the plate. “Very well. I shan’t deduct points. <i>This time.</i>” </p>
<p>“We’re no longer students, Severus. I’m your husband.” </p>
<p>“Details.” </p>
