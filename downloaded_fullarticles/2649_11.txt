    <p>Hayley sat on her bed going through her things for Hogwarts. It was her third year.</p><p>She heard footsteps come down the hall and the clicking of her doorknob turning as her door opened. There stood her mother with letters in her hand. <br/>Hayley got up and walked over grabbing the letters, "Thanks mum." she said and gave her mother a hug. <br/>Mrs Delacour smiled at her daughter, "No problem sweetie." she said and turned on her heel and walked away muttering a just audible, "how that girl gets so much mail I'll never know."<br/>Hayley laughed and shut her door, she went and jumped on her bed, causing a few things to fly out of her trunk. She quickly looked through the envelopes in her hand<br/>"Fred, George, Fleur, Gabriella, Ellianna, Olive." Hayley whispered, she quickly picked out Fleur's letter. She ripped open the envelope. She pulled out the letter and read it</p><p>
  <em>Hayley</em>
  <br/>
  <em>How have you been? Gabriella and I were wondering if you were alright after your recent mishap.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We miss you dearly </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Fleur</em>
</p><p>Hayley smiled and imagined Fleur telling herself this, she went on the open Gabriella's one. It had a card with a little black cat on it. Inside the card a quiet neat writing for a six-year-old.</p><p>
  <em>Halo </em>
  <br/>
  <em>We hope you feel well soon and don't be late for school. </em>
  <br/>
  <em>We miss you dearly, please remember that we will always love you!</em>
  <br/>
  <b>
    <em>Gabby</em>

</p><p>Hayley smiled, Fleur was in the same year as her at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France. She picked out the letter from Ellianna her big sister who had finished school a year ago.</p><p>
  <u>Hayley </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Hey little sis. I miss you so much. </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Working over in Romania is so much fun, I've made some friends. You remember Charlie Weasley? </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Yeah, well we're working together. </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Small world huh? </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Anyway, I have to get back to work and I don't know when I'll be able to send you a letter again. </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Lots of love </u>
  <br/>
  <u>Annagem</u>
</p><p>Hayley smiled and put the letter next to the others, she quickly opened up the one from Olive.</p><p>Hey big sis <br/>Can't wait for a big year at Hogwarts!<br/>It's my first year!<br/>Have you heard the rumours? Apparently, Harry Potter's coming this year!!!</p><p>Hope you feel better after your accident. <br/>Love you! <br/>Snowflake</p><p>Hayley smiled at her little sister's letter, "Yeah Snowy, I'll see you on the train tomorrow." she whispered.</p><p>Hayley had decided to ignore the letters from the twins and picked up what she had knocked out of her trunk. <br/>She noticed it was a small clear bottle of purple-pink potion. She laughed at the memory of how she got it.</p><p>She quickly placed it back in her trunk and closed the lid. She ran over to her desk and quickly got started with her letters.</p><p>Once she had finished, she put them in envelopes and wrote the owners on them, "Melanie." she called out for her mother's owl.</p><p>Melanie cooed from downstairs and Hayley mad her way towards her cage. <br/>"Hey Mel, would you like to do me a favour?" Hayley asked the owl, opening the door and petting the Owls head lightly.</p><p>Melanie bowed her head slightly as if she was nodding. Hayley smiled and pulled the letters out, "Do you think you could take this to their owners?" she asked. Melanie bowed her head again and took the letters, flying out of the cage and the open window.</p><p>Hayley watched the beautiful dark coloured owl fly out the window and away. She was so distracted daydreaming that she didn't feel the nudge of her litter against her leg.</p><p>A small kitten let out a little meow and Hayley snapped back into reality, "Sorry Regulus, I just zoned out." she said going to get the kitten some food. Once she had she went back up to her room and sat on her bed.</p><p>Tapping her fingers against her against her trunk lid the curiosity of what was in Fred and Georges letters got to her.</p><p>She reached over and picked them opening Fred's one first:</p><p>
  <b>Hey </b>
  <br/>
  <b>So George and I wondering you tell about recent.</b>
  <br/>
  <b>We really to about Dementors.</b>
  <br/>
  <b>it to one kiss</b>
  <br/>
  <b>Anyway for cryptic </b>
  <br/>
  <b>We love you'd reply time</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Yours sincerely Gred and Forge</b>
</p><p>Hayley went over the letter, again and again, trying to figure it out. After about five minutes she gave up and opened Georges one:</p><p>
  <em>Hey </em>
  <br/>
  <em>were if would us your accident </em>
  <br/>
  <em>want hear about the </em>
  <br/>
  <em>How was have almost you ?</em>
  <br/>
  <em>sorry the letters</em>
  <br/>
  <em>would if this</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours sincerely Fred and George</em>
</p><p>Hayley groaned, "Why do they do this to me?" she whispered. She read over the letter again and then went back to Fred's. She notices that both letters had an inconvenience about them, she figured it out.</p><p>"These pranksters need to tone it down a notc,." she muttered while putting the two letters together to make a new one that read:</p><p>
  <b>Hey Hayley</b>
  <br/>
  <b>So George and I were wondering if you would tell us about your accident. </b>
  <br/>
  <b>We really want to hear about the Dementors. </b>
  <br/>
  <b>How was it to have one almost kiss you?</b>
  <br/>
  <b>We would love if you'd reply this time.</b>
  <br/>
  <b>Yours sincerely Fred and George</b>
</p><p>Hayley shook her head and went back over to her desk writing a note to the twins.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Fred and George </em>
  <br/>
  <em>I am sorry to inform you that I will very much not tell you what happened over summer through this letter. </em>
  <br/>
  <em>Maybe on the train or something, it is something I don't want to fall into the wrong hands.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sincerely, Hayley</em>
</p><p>She smiled and put it in an envelope, she shook her head and got up leaving the house, "Why don't they just come and see me?" she muttered. She walked to her next door neighbours house and knocked on the front door.</p><p>A man with blond hair answered the door, "Ah. Miss Williams, it is so nice to see you. Are you here for my daughter?" he asked.</p><p>Hayley nodded her head, "Yes thank you sir." she said.</p><p>The man smiled, "She's up in her room." he explained</p><p>"Thank you sir." Hayley said making her way towards the girls room. She knocked on the door and in an airy voice the girl replied with a 'come in'.<br/>Hayley entered the room and looked around, although she had been here many a times she was still amazed at how beautiful it was.</p><p>"How have your holidays been Hayley." the girl asked.</p><p>"Oh you know, very eventful." Hayley answered taking a seat on the girls bed, "How about yours?" she noticed the girl was writing a note.</p><p>"It was interesting." the girl answered, finishing her note and folding it up, "How about that attack, I heard you were part of it."</p><p>Hayley nodded her head as the girl turned to face her, "Yeah, it was horrible." she said shivering at the memory, "who are you writing to?"</p><p>"Ginny." the girl answered with a smile, "she's nice really."</p><p>"Ginny Weasley?" Hayley questioned and the girl nodded, "oh. Cool, well since you're sending a letter that way, do you think you can send mine with it?"</p><p>The girl nodded, "Of course. Who's it for?" she said, taking the letter out of Hayley's hand. "Pandora." the girl called out and a snow coloured owl flew into her room and landed on the desk behind her.</p><p>The girl smiled, "Here Pandora, can you take these to the Weasleys?" she said and the owl cooed. Pandora took the letters and flew away.</p><p>"So who is your letter for?" the girl asked.</p><p>Hayley shrugged, "The Weasley twins. They won't leave me alone about being attacked by Dementors over in France." she said.</p><p>"The Dementors attacked you?" the girl asked, wearing a confused expression.</p><p>"Yes, Luna I was attacked by those black things and I don't really want to talk about it." Hayley said with a sad sigh.</p><p>Luna nodded, "I understand completely. It was like when my mother died a couple of years ago. I didn't want to talk about it." she said going back to her desk and pulling something out.</p><p>The shine of jewels caught Hayley's eye, "Is that what I think it is?" she asked getting up and walking over.</p><p>"If you're thinking its a diadem, then yes. You are correct." Luna said placing it on her head with a small smile.</p><p>"No. Luna that looks exactly like the lost diadem of Ravenclaw." Hayley said taking it off her friends head.</p><p>"Hey be careful. That's the last thing I have to remind me of my mother." Luna said, pouting.</p><p>Hayley looked at it carefully, she smiled and shook her head, "Must've been imagining. Sorry Luna." she said handing it back to the blonde haired girl. "Well I really must be going, I go to Hogwarts tomorrow and I don't want to be late."</p><p>Luna smiled and stood up giving Hayley a hug, "Promise you'll write?" she asked.</p><p>Hayley nodded, "When I get the chance. I will have my hands full with first years and the Weasley twins as usual." she said hugging Luna back.</p><p>When they broke apart, Hayley gave a quick wave and ran down stairs saying a quick 'goodbye ' to Mr Lovegood, she entered her house again and ran upstairs.</p><p>Melanie was sitting on her desk with three letters, "How'd you do that so fast?" Hayley uttered. Melanie cooed and nipped Hayley's fingers as she tried to get the letters.</p><p>"Oh right. Here you go." Hayley said giving the owl a treat. Melanie took it and flew downstairs.</p><p>Hayley had just picked her letters up when she heard a call from down stairs.</p><p>"Hayley Ruby Isabelle Williams. What have I told you about letting that owl fly around the house?" her mother called.</p><p>Hayley groaned chucking the letters into her bed, "Not to let her fly around." she called back, running downstairs and collecting the very reluctant owl and carried her upstairs to her cage in Hayley's room, she put Melanie in the cage. "Sorry girl, I'll let you out tomorrow and meet you at Hogwarts."</p><p>(Just in case anyone's confused, Mel had two cages)</p><p>Hayley went over to her bed and fell into it, receiving an annoyed meow from Regulus. "Sorry Reg, I didn't see you there." Hayley said picking up the small black kitten. "Are ya ready for your first day at Hogwarts?" she asked the kitten as she put him down on her stomach.</p><p>Regulus quickly laid down and yawned, "I'll take that as a yes." Hayley said and yawned, "yeah, let's get some sleep. It's a big day tomorrow." she closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
