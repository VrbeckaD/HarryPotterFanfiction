    <p align="center"><u> </u> <em> <strong>June 1996</strong> </em></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was a dark foggy night yet again, but the four story upraise was an all to familiar place. It may be dark and hidden from view of muggles but it has been home for the past year. </p><p align="left">A figure amerges from the opposite side of the street heading to the door, shaken and breathing heavy, clad in dark clothing and hunched moving quickly across.</p><p align="left">Before the figure can make it up the steps to the house the front door flys open. There stands a very disheveled angry looking Remus Lupin startling what seemed like an intruder.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“WHERE. HAVE. YOU. BEEN!” Remus starts down the stairs, “BED EMPTY, NO NOTE, AND YOU JUST...GONE! You could have been hurt!!” Remus yells now in the others personal space.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Rem calm down I’m fine I made it back in one piece, did I not??” Bellami responds with an arched eyebrow and smug smirk she picked up from Tonks after removing her hood. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Remus sighs heavily looking back at Tonks who has the same smirk and is leaning against the door frame.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“A little help would be nice” he says to Tonks before turning back to the 14 year old; pinching the bridge of his noise, eyes closed sighing heavily. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Once open Bellami can see the worry and sadness that still remained in ‘uncle’ Remus’s eyes and feels instant guilt for being the one to put it there.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Before she can speak he does, “Bel you can’t do things like you did before” he puts his hand on her shoulder, “we are fighting a war and I don’t want you getting hurt.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Bellami rolls her eye and pushes his hand off saying, “says the man who didn’t want to teach me anything besides the curriculum. Rem I’m not the kid I once was, I appreciate the concern though.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/>
Bellami presses pass Remus shrugging off her coat, Tonks gives her shoulder a squeeze before turning her attention back to Lupin.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Remus sighs again shaking his head looking down and makes his way back up the stairs to Tonks while saying, “this girl is going to make me go bald before I’m 40 with how much worrying I do.”  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Well you already got some grays, what’s a receding hair line going to do” Tonks teases plucking at his messy curls. Remus rolls his eyes but smirks at her then gets serious again while watching Bellami, at the kitchen table, talk to a motherly Mrs. Weasley who was hugging her side.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“I just worry about her” Remus says as a whisper but Tonks can hear it and grabs his chin making him look at her. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“And there is nothing wrong with that my love, she knows you love her that’s why you worry like your mother” she laughs pecking him on the lips sinking into him a little more.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Their moment is rudely interrupted by a musky smelling Moody rushing pass them saying, "Enough! Where is she!” Remus grabs Alastor’s arm to stop him and points with his head to the kitchen, “She is fine.”  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Not when I’m done with her...<strong>BELLAMI</strong>!”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Alastor, no that isn’t necessary!”  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Isn’t necessary!!! You had us looking all over bloody London for that girl, come to found out she was at the bloody Library down the road!” By this time Bellami was in the hallway, arms crossed over her chest looking slightly embarrassed at how loud Moody was being. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Remus looking at her almost fondly after figuring out where she had been until Moody grabbed her arm.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">“Now listen here, next time a patronus is sent for you, you better respond girl. You hear me!” Bellami yanks her arm out of Moody’s grasp and looks at him like she could eat his head off but all she responds with is a low “yes sir” and quickly walk past him saying to Remus <strike>“I can’t believe you had everyone looking for me”</strike> before ascending the stairs to her room.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Everyone could hear when the bedroom door slammed shut. Moody now directs his anger to Remus, "You need to get her under control Lupin! We can't be out looking for her every time she comes home late." Remus nods putting a hand on Moody's shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Thank you for looking, I do appreciate it Moody and I know you worry too. It's okay, you can admit it." </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Moody just straightens up and coughs looking at everyone's face now fixed on him with smirks and say "Yeah, well we have business to attend to. Let's go!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Remus and Tonks exchange even wider smiles knowning everyone has become fond of Bellami's presents and follow Moody through the door into the living room. Remus glances back up the stair once more before closing the door behind him.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Bellami flops down on the bed smiling slightly at the thought that Remus worries so much. 'He doesn't need to' she thinks to herself 'I can take care of myself'. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Her confidence falters because she knows all she has now is Remus and Tonks and she doesn't want anything to happen to them. She is so grateful to them in her life.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Her mind starts to drift at the first couple of times she meet Remus and how kind he was to her but also how sad he looked. They never talk about those times though, well more like Remus doesn't. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Every time Bellami brings them up he changes the subject or asks to not talk about it. After he took her in she stopped asking all together knowing he would probably never tell her. A knock at the door brings her out of her thoughts. "Yes?"</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">The door opens with a creek and standing in the door scruffy looking Sirius Black. Bellami props up on her elbows raising an eyebrow at him. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"You know you gave Remus a right good scare there. You know you should obey the rules sometimes" he says entering the room with a wink. Bel rolls into stomach as Sirius makes his way to the other side of the room to sit in the chair that resided there.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Yeah, I know and I feel bad, but he worries to much. I know it's because he loves me but rule breaking is in my blood. And also that's rich coming from you; since you both use to be 'the Marauders' after all" she says laughing a little. "Use to be?" He questions with a raised eyebrow, "Honey, I'm the one and only."</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">She laughs some more watching Sirius's attention turn to the door and she raises her head to do the same. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Remus entered the room, plopping down on the bed beside her saying, "Yeah, you wish old man. James had you beat by a mile." He kisses Bellami's forehead and side hugs her in the fatherly way she has become accustom to.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Bel laughs at Sirius's face of exaggerated shook, mouth agap. "No I was so much cooling them him, dont even!" She laughs again saying, "I really wish I could have met him, James Potter. All the stories you tell me that have him in it are my favorites. He sounds like a person I want to be best friends with." She didn't realize what she had said until seeing how Sirius's experssion changed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"I'm sorry" she whispered and Remus tight smiled at her then glances at Sirius.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Sirius's teary eyes meet Remus's and he laughs "No, no its okay, he really was an amazing friend, father, and brother. I think he would have liked you very much."</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Bellami smiles weakly attention turning to Remus "So, are you here to yell at me?" He frowns shaking his head no, "Don't pay any mind to Moody, he was worried just as much as I was."  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Oh I know, he sent two patronuses himself along with the one you sent" she replies laughing.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Bel why didn't you answer then?" Remus questions. Bellami just raises an eyebrow at him, "Maybe because someone hasn't taught me yet, professor" she mocks. Remus flushes with embarrassment as Sirius tries to hide his laughter behind his hand.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"><strong>"LUPIN!! NYMPHADORA!! BLACK!!!"</strong> They hear Moody loud boasting voice yell from downstairs, startling them all.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Man, he is subtle isn't he" Tonks says from the doorway the three of them are now looking at. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Lets go boys" Tonks says walking over to Bellami kissing her forehead in the same manner Remus had done earlier.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"I'm glad you are safe Bel, love you" was all she said. As the adults go to exit the room Bellami speaks up "oh wait, what is the mission? Can I come?" In unison they all turn and say no, even Sirius which instantly worries her. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Sirius normally tries to convince the others to let her go. Her stomach aches at the thought of a mission that even Sirius wouldn't want her there for.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">She runs to her window to watch them apparate, silently hoping they will return safetly. Bellami starts thinking back to the day 'uncle' Remus saved her and she can't help but let a tear fall for her actual aunt. That night still haunts her dreams. It's a scary thought to think it has already been three years.</p>
