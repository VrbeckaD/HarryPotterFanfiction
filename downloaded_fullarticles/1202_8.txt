    <p>
  <span>The quiet crackling of the fireplace was the only noise in the Common Room. Harry Potter sat on the ancient red couch, his Charms book in his hands. He wasn’t reading. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was waiting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Waiting on Hermione to come to him. She would look him in the eyes and ask him to come with her and he would. It had been two weeks since she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The portrait door swung open. He didn’t need to know who it was. It was her. Everyone else was at dinner, but they were not. Not tonight. Tonight a different hunger was clawing at them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the same, as always. Except she would always find him doing something different. The last time she needed him, it was after long Quidditch practice. She showed up and sat down in the bleachers. He knew what she needed as soon as he saw her. He waited until his teammates were long gone before dragging her into the locker room and fucking her in shower. He listened to her feet slow to a stop in front of him. He could see the tips of her black shoes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The same black shoes that drove him mad. He couldn’t count how many times he demanded she wears them and only them in all while he fucked her relentlessly. Turning his head toward her, the book is forgotten. He watched her wring her hands together as if she was nervous. Her eyes were tired, her skin pale. He frowned seeing how hard she pushed herself this year. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, are you..?” she began, her voice soft. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not busy,” he replied, placing the book to the side and stood up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to pull her to him and kiss her senseless. Then bend her over and fuck her in the Common Room. His cock twitched in his trousers, thinking about fucking her. </span>
</p><p>She gave him a brief smile and turned around to depart, leaving him to chase after her. His quick stride catching up to her speedy feet. She crawled through the portrait hole before he even reached it. Tonight she was eager.</p><p>
  <span>He chased her.... like he always did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Down two floors, there was an out of sight broom closet they had found. Or she had found. Harry watched as she grasped the handle, opening the door. He wanted to grab her hips and pulled her ass into his erection, but refrained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked both ways before following her inside. The once dirty and cluttered broom closet smelled clean. The door wasn’t closed for three seconds before Hermione cast a series of charms he knew were privacy, locking, and silencing. No one would know they were in here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one except them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Backing her into the cold stone wall, he placed both hands around her neck and leaned down to kiss her soft lips. That kiss, like the others before it, ignited a passion that threatened to consume them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quickly, hands began to disrobe and tear at confining clothes until they stood nude in the dark broom closet. He couldn’t see her but he knew exactly what she looked like in his mind. Placing his hands on her ass, he lifted her until her long legs wrapped around his waist, her heels digging into his ass giving him complete access to her pussy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kissed her neck, careful to not leave a mark. His thick length pressing into her inner thigh. They didn’t need to romantic foreplay, their time together was limited. Harry had learned what she craved early on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kissing her warm lips, her mouth opened to his tongue, letting him inside. He groaned feeling her fingers in his hair the nails scraping lightly. Breaking from the kiss, he lowered his head, his back bowed, to suck on her erect nipple. It begged to be toyed with. He listened to her swear softly as he swirled his tongue over the pert nipple. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His calloused fingers swept over the seam of her pussy, feeling her juices leak for him. His head swam, as it did every time, knowing she was ready for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Releasing the nipple, her fingers tugged his head up to kiss her. Their tongues dueled feverishly, the heat from their bodies opening their pores making them sweat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry...please,” she pleaded, closing her eyes, feeling his cock press against her pussy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please what, Hermione?” he teased her opening. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please fuck me,” her voice rasped in his ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry obliged her, not wanting to wait any longer. Pushing his cock inside her, he shuddered to feel her warmth grip his cock. He stopped himself. Two weeks without her, he was too close to cumming. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt her shift her hips, her body riding his hard cock. Gripping her hips, he stilled her, kissed her mouth and plunged his cock back in her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His body twisted as pleasure coursed through him as he fucked her willing and wet pussy. Burying his head into her thick brown hair, he kissed down her shoulder. Her hands splayed on his upper back, feeling the muscles move. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Het set a pace of slow fucking, much to her annoyance, to pounding her pussy until she would nearly cum. Harry smirked at her desperate attempt to fuck him to her completion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushed her further into the wall. Their pants echoed in their ears. He could feel the sweat drip down his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” she moaned. He grunted in agreement. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rotating his hips, he plunged his cock deeper into her. His hands pressing firmly against her hips. He wanted her to submit to him. He wanted her to admit that he was the only one who could make her feel like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head, his bangs flew away from his face. He could see her now. The shimmer of sweat glistened on her face. Her head bobbed in the motion of her body fucking his cock. The pleasure on her face caused his abs to clench. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt her squeeze her muscles around his cock, making him groan her name. They were both close but he was closer than her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I--I’m gonna...” she panted, scoring her nails lightly down his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t stop until you cum,” his voice guttural. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched as she threw her head back. Her body still in ecstasy as her orgasm washed through her veins. Three thrusts later, he came inside her, following her orgasm. Their moans and whispered words of devotion to one another jumbled as her body greedily sucked his seed in her womb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Resting his head on her damp shoulder, his chest heaving, he let himself grin. Slender fingers played with the skin on the back of his neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Squeezing her ass lovingly, he lifted his head, opening his eyes to stare into her cinnamon-brown ones. Her unblinking eyes stared into his. Without saying a word, he knew she was telling him </span>
  <em>
    <span>to thank you. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>They had fucked and enjoyed it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sliding his tender cock from her warmth, he lowered her feet to the floor. The dark closet was illuminated by a thin strip of light. He felt for his trousers laying on the cold floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Picking them up, he slopped them on his eyes watching her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Should they have done it? Probably not, but she needed a way to relax. He was there for her for the first time and since. No one else, unless he was dead, was going to see what she looked like during this intimate moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He watched as she bent over to retrieve her discarded shirt, her bare ass close enough to touch it. He wanted her again, but sheer will stopped him from plunging his cock inside her pussy again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned back to buttoning his shirt. Shoving his feet in his trainers, he leaned against the wall and waited on her. A few minutes later, she drew her wand and unlocked the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew if he turned the knob, things would go back to normal. Until next time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry.....” he heard her whisper in the dark. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yea, Hermione?” he paused his movement and turned around to look at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until next time?” she mumbled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was glad it was dark so she couldn’t see the grimace on his face," Yea, until next time." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pushing the door open, Harry looked around seeing it was clear. Turning his head around he nodded to his...lover that it was all clear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you be okay getting back to the tower?” she asked, looking him in the eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gave her a crooked grin," I will be fine. Get back to patrolling." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She nodded and quickly turned around away from him. He watched her go, disappearing down the stairs before he turned around to head toward the seventh floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laying in his bed, later on, he knew it was only a matter of time until she searched him out again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Until hands re-discovered each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until lips found solace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until they shuddered from mutual pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yes, Harry smiled, rolling over on his side.... there would be a next time. </span>
