          <div class="userstuff"><p>“No.”</p><p align="left">“<em>Meow</em>.”</p><p align="left">“I said NO. I need to finish this. Leave me alone Mauler.”</p><p align="left">“<em>MEOW</em>!”</p><p align="left">“NO! GET BACK HERE! GIVE IT BACK!”</p><p align="left">Too late, Mauler ran out of the bedroom so quickly that Tina only saw a ginger tail turning the corner when she stood up.</p><p align="left">“I need that seal! Get over here!” she yelled but the cat was out of sight.</p><p align="left">“Where are you, little thief?” Tina hissed as she started to look under the furniture, checking every corner on his way he can hide.</p><p align="left">When she couldn't spot him, “Fine,” she said, pissed off.</p><p align="left">“You asked for this.”</p><p align="left">She almost cast an accio when she heard a frustrated hiss behind her. She turned on her heels to catch the thief but what she didn’t expect was to see <em>two</em> Maulers…</p><p align="left">“<em>Oh</em>…”</p><p align="left">The kneazle Mauler was looking at her from the couch where he curled up, almost like a pillow, his irritated gaze told her that she woke him up.</p><p align="left">The other was not a kneazle… Just a ginger cat who had so large ears that one could mistake him with a Kneazle, but his beautiful blue-green eyes always gave him away…</p><p align="left">Tina opened her mouth but she silenced by the clock's ding, it announced it was midnight.</p><p align="left">Newt looked at her from the table as displeased as a cat can be, and Tina didn’t think he looked ridiculous this time. She was so ashamed by the fact that she mistook her husband with their pet.</p><p align="left">Her seal lay beside his paws but she didn’t make any move towards it, instead, she took a step back in surrender.</p><p align="left">“Lead the way.”</p><p align="left">The ginger cat looked pleased and hopped down with a meow. Tina sighed and watched his fluffy tail to curl up in different directions as she followed him to their bedroom.</p></div>
