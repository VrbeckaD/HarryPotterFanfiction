  <strong>It was ancient magic, and this old magic allowed for hints to your soulmates. These hints started similar for everyone but then would start to diverge down the path as new hints are given. </strong>
</p><p>
  <b>There usually were two black and white opinions in relation to the soulmate magic: those who were obsessed with finding their soulmates, and those that could be perfectly happy but incomplete without their soulmates, saying come as it may.</b>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Soulmates should not be seen as a half to a whole, but as an extension, as a person with unique individual traits that teach you to care for others, differences, changes in yourself, and how to love more intensely than ever is thought possible. </em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr">Even as a toddler, he often found himself buried in books trying to decipher this old magic. His father was ecstatic, even if he didn't show it, that his son had shared the same kind of intense interest in magic at his age already. He could tell his son was going to be wise years beyond his age, after all, he had started reading a very young age, he was barely even almost two years old at the time. Not many of the other pureblood families' kids were fond of him. They described him as that one quiet kid who was always with a book and it was fine, he preferred to stay alone. Draco was quite sure he didn't inherit his mother's socialite quality, but he much rather preferred to work alone than have to deal with the issues arising with friendship. </p><p dir="ltr">More times than not, Draco would find himself also dragged into zealous charity events and glamorous galas that were so overdone that the frequency had caused the novelty to wear off. He would much prefer to sit alone and curl up with an enticing novella or an enriching textbook to study, so he began bringing books with him and stayed in a corner refusing to interact after greeting most of the guests</p><p dir="ltr">This aspect of him, his father did not appreciate as much, and they always talked as such. He had etiquette lessons, cultural lessons, and magic lessons that he absorbed all the information of within a matter of seconds, he could take in all kinds of information and relay it back later with analysis and opinions given. Other than the time buried in his book, sometimes Draco found himself wondering what could she look like. He would stare at the date encircling his left wrist like a bracelet,<em> September 19 1979</em>, and place it in the light in different angles as if it would change if he looked differently. </p><p dir="ltr">His mother described that it had been there with him since the day he was born, and he believed her, there was no reason to lie about that. After all, he had been studying about this magic since he started to learn to properly read. Soulmate magic it was called and it was very powerful. Certain soulmates can have certain ties in their magic that could even surpass even some of the pureblood family's scared magic. He knew all about it, and he still obsessed about finding out about his soulmate. As far as he could tell he only had one soulmate, but whether they were female or male was a different story to tell. Even though he didn't know, he imagined she was female and tried to think how she could possibly look.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes he would find himself sketching aimlessly about how her curls would fall down her back like waves upon the ocean or how she'd have really bright and big doe eyes, after he tried imagining, he would scrap these drawings and go find another book to study. Sometimes, out of the corner of his eye, he could see something blurry and somehow he knew it was his connection to her allowing him to see through her eyes for just a minute, she was always with people or helping out an animal in need. He concluded that she must have a pretty kind heart, and loved to spend time with others, and that thought warmed his heart, just a little bit, but he wouldn't make any comment on it. </p><hr/><p>On her right wrist was an inscription of a birthdate, <em>June 5 1980</em>, and the day her soulmate had been born it had appeared. Her parents didn't know what to make of it when their daughter who was almost 9 months old had suddenly gained a "birthmark" that just happened to look like a date but they tried not to question it because they were logical people and it would drive them insane. Hermione liked to read, books were her friends, but she longed to have some actual human contact. She loved her parents and they were absolutely amazing, but she also wanted friends. </p><p>When she was five years old, she met a boy named Harry Potter and he was a little weird, which was an understatement, but somehow there was just an understanding between them. She could almost clearly remember the day she met and what she didn't remember he did. Her parents didn't want to be rude so they went to greet them with their young daughter who looked up to meet them. She didn't usually meet strangers, even though she almost so desperately craved the attention to meet others without knowing that she did. </p><p>"Hello, Hermione, it's nice to meet you," She looked at the very pretty lady, and then nodded. "I am Lily Potter and this is my husband James Potter. I have a son that is just about your age, would you like to meet him?"</p><p>Hermione just gazed at Lily, trying to judge whether or not she should, but soon nodded again, almost too eagerly. She could hear her mother and father laugh along with Lily and she wandered around the house cataloging everything she saw until bumping into a boy with black messy hair who was squinting at her, "Who're you?"</p><p>"Hermione Granger."</p><p>They both stared at each other, unsure what to do together for a long while until they just had big grins plastered on their faces and both burst into laughter over nothing. "Harry Potter."</p><p>"They seem to get on well." Helen noticed, looking at Lily.</p><p>"Yes! Maybe they could have playdates?" Lily excitedly clapped her hands together with eyes shining brightly as she suggested and agreed.</p><p>She wondered why Lily would be so eager to have her over again, and she heard about how she was special somehow. She remembered that Lily had come up to her and told her she could tell her all about the red date marking on her right wrist, but first she had to discuss something over with her parents. </p><p>That day when she went home after dinner at their house, she had another mark on the inside of her left wrist. It read, "Who're you?" in a faint green color. </p>
