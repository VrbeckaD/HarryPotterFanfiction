  <u> <strong>Ch. 1 - Make It Rain</strong> </u>
</p>
<p>In an underground lair, a radio crackled. "Collonello!" A voice called from the other end. With a grimace, a tall blond male turned from examining his latest trap to pick up the hand held radio.</p>
<p>"Collonello here, Kora*!" He growled into the radio. These calls over the radio had been coming more frequently of late. <em>"Perhaps I should put those idiots up top through my trials, and they won't keep asking me to do their jobs for them.."</em> He thought grumpily.</p>
<p>"There's an unauthorized entry on the beach. Retrieve the unauthorized person and put them through the exam." The guy on the other end ordered. Collonello ground his teeth.</p>
<p>"Was there a please in there somewhere, Kora?" He retorted. There</p>
<p>was a brief silence and then a brief crackle of the radio.</p>
<p>"Please." The man added.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you know <em>where</em> on the beach the UE*² is?" Collonello added, almost pleasantly. There was another long pause, and then…</p>
<p>"The north-west side of the Island." He added.</p>
<p>"At least it's close to my whirlpool." Collonello grunted before turning his radio off and grabbing his rifle. With a sharp whistle to Falco, Collonello quickly sprinted down a tunnel towards the Northwest area of the Island. At the end of the tunnel there was a ladder leading up into the darkness. Quickly he jumped up the ladder, skipping three to five rungs at a time. Finally light began to show from above, and Collonello grabbed the edge of the opening above him. With one hand holding his rifle steady, Collonello flung himself up until he was vertical above the edge of the hole. He then flipped back to his feet on the ground. Falco came soaring out just behind him, and Collonello leapt up onto the birds' back. Colonello was frequently grateful that Falco grew in size when Colonello returned to his adult form, as riding Falco was much more convenient than being carried beneath him. Quickly the bird soared over to the farthest north-west corner of the beach and then began flying back and forth over the beach as Collonello searched for the unauthorized person or people.</p>
<p>At length Collonello saw a long red and blue clothed body at the waters edge. Snarling under his breathe about incompetent security teams, Collonello shifted his weight forward and leaned down against Falco. The hawk immediately dove towards the figure on the ground. As Collonello got closer, he saw the figure was a girl. She seemed to be somewhere between the ages of fifteen and sixteen, and had long black hair. Her skin was a pale white, and freckle-less. She wore what appeared to be some sort of red and gold sleeveless sports jersey with blue jeans and very old and ratty trainers. Everything was soaked.</p>
<p><em>"Judging by her sea-soaked clothes and hair...plus her proximity to the water, probably washed ashore while unconscious."</em> Collonello decided. With a sigh he went over to wake the slumbering girl.</p>
<p>"You there, kora! Time to wake up! You are officially trespassing on a private resort, kora!" He barked at the girl. There was no response. The girl simply kept breathing shallowly. Collonello frowned at the girl.</p>
<p><em>"What a pain."</em> He grumbled to himself. Quickly he rolled off Falcos' back and dropped to the ground, landing in a crouch right next to the girl. Intending to wake the girl, Collonello grabbed the girls' bare shoulder. A flash of brilliant orange Sky-fire exploded up and around them both. In shock, Collonello felt and saw his own flames rise up out of him on their own. His blue rain flames twined up and around strands of the Sky flames. Then his flames entered the girls' chest as hers entered his. The strands of flame wound tighter and tighter until they were one glowing flame rod going from his heart to hers. Inside his very soul Collonello felt the bond as it formed. The strength of the bond shocked him. He could feel his new Skys' distress, and that her life was in danger. He could also feel her outright need for the bond. In his shock, Collonello only had two quick thoughts. The first was :</p>
<p><em>"But bonding doesn't </em> <em> <strong>work</strong> </em> <em> like that!"*³</em></p>
<p>The second though was</p>
<p><em>"Those bastards in security are probably watching this on their surveillance cams and laughing."</em> Then Collonello had no more time to think. Quickly he scooped up his new Sky and jumped. Falco flew beneath him and quickly swerved around towards the East side of the Island. Collonello was certain Falco had never flown faster. Strangely he could actually feel Falco in a portion of his mind, as though when he bonded to his Sky he also bonded to Falco. He could feel that the hawks' increased speed was due to his own urgency. The hawk didn't even slow down as it approached the hospital. The hospital staff had long gotten used to Collonello and Falco bringing in the casualties after training or attacks. He usually brought them in as quickly as he could, going so far as to both hold wounded mafioso on top of Falco and have the bird carry other wounded mafioso in its talons. For this purpose the hospital built extremely fast automatic doors on a balcony.</p>
<p>It was these doors that Falco flew through now, with a screech that rattled the very building itself. Fearing an attack, medical personnel rushed from wherever they were and poured into the reserved drop-off room. Several of those medical people were bowled over as Falco crashed into them. Collonello jumped off Falcos' back before he could become part of the pile-up. Dimly he could feel Falcos' pain, but it was blocked by the urgency he felt to ensure his Skys' safety.</p>
<p>"Is Shamal still here?!" Collonello demanded. The doctors not trying to help the bowled over medics did not looked impressed. Nevertheless one answered immediately.</p>
<p>"He is bothering the nurses on this floor. Probably about to be thrown out. Again." A female doctor replied, flipping her hair over one shoulder in an irritated fashion. The look of distaste upon her face informed Collonello plainly that she would not be fetching Dr. Shamal for him. Ignoring her, Collonello turned to a young man wearing the intern-designated green scrubs.</p>
<p>"Take me to Dr. Shamal." Collonello ordered. With a gulp at the fierce look of Collonello, the intern scrambled to obey. The young man ran down a hallway at the back-right side of the room, with Collonello breathing down his neck. In mere moments the panting intern stood right behind Dr. Shamal, who was indeed irritating the nurses.</p>
<p>"Shamal!" Collonello snarled. The doctor in question jumped and spun in place, his indigo fire flowing around his fingers. When he caught sight of Collonello, Shamals' shoulders relaxed and he smiled.</p>
<p>"Why, Collonello, you almost gave me a heart attack!" Shamal scolded.</p>
<p>"Chatter later. Work now." Collonello demanded as he practically threw his Sky into Shamals' arms. To his credit, despite being surprised by the action Dr. Shamal caught the young woman and cradled her gently. With a short nod he turned and entered a patient room off to the side of the nursing station. Shamal looked sidelong at Collonello as the intern turned down the sheets and Shamal gently laid the Sky down.</p>
<p>"Not that I'm complaining, mind, but any particular reason you are throwing an unconscious cutie at me?" Shamal inquired as the intern went to get a couple of nurses. The door closed behind the intern and Shamal started working. As he clipped the pulse oximeter to one of the fingers on her right hand, Collonello finally spoke.</p>
<p>"She is my Sky. No funny stuff." Collonello growled. Shamal rolled his eyes and waited.</p>
<p>"I need details to help figure out what is wrong and treat her." Shamal prodded. With great reluctance, Collonello opened his mouth, then closed it again. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"I was sent to check out the entry of an unauthorized person on the northwest beach. When I got there, I found a girl who had clearly been washed ashore unintentionally. I tried to wake her up by talking to her, no response. I then grabbed her shoulder to see if shaking her would wake her up, and our flames both surged up and combined. I actually felt the bond form, and I can still feel where our minds connect. I can even feel Falco connected to my mind now. I do not know what is wrong with her, besides almost drowning, but I can feel how close she is to dying. From what I have heard from others, everything from the bond to being able to feel her in my mind is….unheard of." Collonello replied grimly. Shamals' eyebrows had gone higher and higher as he listened to Collonellos' story. That was probably the most anyone had heard the rain say, and without a single 'Kora!'. He mused on the rains' words while he fastened the sphygmomanometer to his new patients' arm. After pushing the button on the wall to make the plastic cuff fill up with air, Shamal replied.</p>
<p>"It <em>is</em> unheard of, even among the Vongola. I will start with tests that do not involve touching, just in case it triggers whatever happened when you grabbed her shoulder." Shamal said aloud as he grabbed a clipboard out of a cupboard and started writing down the readings from the manometer.</p>
<p>"Thank you." Collonello muttered quietly. Shamal didn't even look at him, too busy writing down the readings from the pulse oximeter.</p>
<p>"You aren't the first worried guardian I've worked with, you know." Shamal remarked calmly. A nurse quickly came in and started to assist Shamal. The intern came back in with a chair and Collonello forced himself to sit, despite wanting to hover over the doctors' shoulder and see everything that was going on. At one point Shamal drew some blood, and Collonello felt himself almost come out of his skin. A snarl slipped passed his lips and startled both Collonello and Shamal.</p>
<p>"You are even jumpier than I expected you to be with a new bond." Shamal remarked after a moment when Collonello finally forced himself to sit down and breathe.</p>
<p>"I did not expect me to be this jumpy, Kora." Collonello replied grumpily. Shamal nodded and made a note on the clipboard. He then wrote something down and handed both clipboard and blood bag to a nurse. Without a word the nurse left quickly.</p>
<p>"I have sent the blood for testing." Shamal announced. Collonello nodded shortly, just one quick jerky movement. While Collonello watched, Shamal took a hair follicle sample, a nail clipping, pulled back an eyelid to check her eyes, and then took another clipboard out of the cupboard. He began to make notes on this clipboard, then handed the clipboard to a nurse sitting in the corner of the room, at a computer. She quickly entered all the notes into the computer. Another nurse entered and took the baggies of samples from Shamal and left again.</p>
<p>"We have to do all the tests, as she has no known medical history or name. I want to make sure we treat everything so there are no possible problems in the future coming from what is wrong now." Shamal continued, as though he'd never stopped talking. Once more Collonello nodded jerkily. He didn't trust himself to speak just then. Shamal puttered around the room for a bit, pretending to supervise the nurses setting up the IV and the pads attached to the heart monitor. Another nurse removed the arm cuff Shamal had not yet gotten too.</p>
<p>At length the two nurses from earlier came back with the clipboards Shamal had sent out. Shamal looked over the clipboards, frowned, and passed the clipboards over to the nurse at the computer. Then he went back over to the patient again and gently opened her eyelids one more time. Collonello wasn't sure what the doctor was looking for, but he stood up sensing trouble. With a sigh Shamal lowered the eyelid gently and took the third clipboard back from the nurse at the computer. Shamal detached the papers from the other two clipboards and attached them to the one he held. Impatiently Collonello waited as Shamal wrote a few more notes on his clipboard. Finally Shamal handed the clipboard back to the computer nurse and turned to face Collonello.</p>
<p>"It's not good news, Collonello. She is, as you said, close to dying. I am not entirely certain why, however. It is clear that she has been starved for a very long time, almost as though she comes from a poverty-stricken country or a warzone." Shamal began, and Collonello sank into his seat, attempting and failing to brace himself. "She very nearly drowned, but seems to be slowly recovering from that. She probably also has at least a mild concussion, judging by the knot on the top of her head." Shamal continued mercilessly.</p>
<p>"The good news is that she has not done drugs, and has no alcohol or tranquilizers in her system. Unfortunately we need a flame test to find out what is actually killing her, as her body seems to have adapted to the problems we have already detected. I recommend a Sun you trust who has flame training, and is already bonded to another Sky. If you want me to do the test, however, I can." Shamal replied calmly. Collonello only needed a moment to think.</p>
<p>"The Varia has a very powerful Sun Healer, do they not?" Collonello demanded. Shamal fidgeted slightly, but nodded.</p>
<p>"They do indeed, but they are too far away at the moment." Shamal agreed. Collonello smiled grimly.</p>
<p>"Perhaps for someone who isn't an ex-arcobaleno with Viper." Collonello replied. Indigo flames appeared in a ring in front of Collonello, and then the center formed into a mirror. Instead of Collonellos' face, however, the hooded countenance of Viper showed.</p>
<p>"You used the safewords, rain ex-arcobaleno. What do you require?" Mammon demanded.</p>
<p>"I need you and the Varia's healer now." Collonello replied.</p>
<p>"One moment." Viper replied, and the mirror construct vanished, leaving behind only a pulsing indigo point. About three seconds later Viper appeared in a cloud of their mist flames. With Viper was a tall man with green and brown colored hair.</p>
<p>"Collonello." Lussuria greeted cheerfully as yellow fire dripped from his hand. "Mammon tells me you have yourself a little sky of your own now! Congratulations, honey!" Lussuria said. "Now, let's see what we can do to help your little angel, hmm?" Lussuria hummed as he turned to look at the patient on the bed. "Well, she is a little angel, isn't she?" He murmured as he settled a hand on the girls' shoulder. Collonello tensed, a shout on his lips. Before he could release the noise, however, his Skys' flames burst out of her once more, and then seemed to inspect the sun flames like a curious puppy. It appeared his Skys' flames were uninterested in the sun flames, however, as they started to drift around the room and through everyone else present. Lussuria paid no attention to this, his focus having followed his flames into the patients' body. Shamal tensed as the flames flowed over and through him, but nothing happened and the flames withdrew. The flames flowed around Mammon tentatively, and then slowly crept towards him. When the mists' flames did nothing to stop the Sky flames, the flames crept into the strangely motionless mist. Immediately the mist flames surged up and the Sky flames doubled in intensity and amount. Lussuria staggered back, his own flames winking out. Collonello watched in resignation, Shamal and Lussuria in shock as the Sky and Mist flames bound the girl and Mammon together. When the bond stabilized into a swirling rod of amber and indigo, Mammons' other bond flickered into being. They all clearly saw the weak, thin link that led off to the distance waver and then disintegrate. Mammon staggered, and Collonello immediately moved to brace up the mist.</p>
<p>"<strong>That is not a normal bond.</strong>" Mammon stated flatly, gasping quitely as though winded. Collonello nodded shortly.</p>
<p>"We suspected as much. The same thing happened with me, except for the breaking of a former bond." Collonello agreed.</p>
<p>"The boss is not going to like this at all." Lussuria worried, looking down at the young woman lying in the bed. Collonello and Mammon didn't reply, but both looked grim.</p>
<p>"If you can't find out what is wrong with her, it may not be an issue." Collonello growled softly. Lussurias' worried look turned determined.</p>
<p>"There has yet to be a disease, injury, or illness I couldn't diagnose or fix." Lussuria growled. "We in the Varia specialize in doing the impossible." Lussuria replied, once more sending his flames into the patient. Once more the curious flames rose, but seemed to recognise Lussuria and his flames. Once more they drifted languidly through the room as Lussuria worked. The others waited patiently as they could, Collonello and Mammon gently testing where a new mental connection stretched between them. When they pressed on it with their minds, a smaller link shone between them, one that looked a lot like the one with their sky, only it contained three colors. This bond was Orange, Indigo, and Blue. When the mist no longer needed Collonello to support them, Collonello knew it and took a step away. Collonello felt Mammons' thanks, and sent a mental nod Mammons' way. Anxiously the two waited for news on their Sky and whether she could be saved.</p>
