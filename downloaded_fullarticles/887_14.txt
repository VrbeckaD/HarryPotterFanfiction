  <b>Early Life:</b>
</p><p>- On the night Dani was born at Dragonstone, a severe summer storm raged. For this reason, she is sometimes called "Daenerys Stormborn".</p><p>- Dani was born to Apollo and Calliope Scamander on Christmas Day 1979. She is the younger sister of Rolf and then granddaughter of Newt Scamander.</p><p>- When Dani was 7 years old, Apollo gifted his daughter a Niffler, which she named Callie after her mother. Callie became Dani's best friend.</p><p>- Other children avoid Dani because of her pale skin, white hair and purple eyes, and because of the fact she is Shadow-kissed.</p><p>- Dani was an adventurous child, often climbing trees to get to bird nests.</p><p>- Apollo is a dragonologists, so Dani spent a lot of early years around the beasts.</p><p>- Apollo breeds and trains Hippogriffs (Including Buckbeak)</p><p>- Calliope was a very talented healer, a skill that saved her daughter from certain death after a banshee attack</p><p>When Dani was 6 years old she was involved in an incident when traveling with her mother. Whilst in Ireland they were attacked by a banshee. Calliope tried to shield her daughter from the banshee but failed. Both were fatally wounded, but Calliope used the last of her life to save Dani's as well as kill the banshee, when the banshee died it let out a wail unlike any other, shadow-kissing Dani, it was so powerful that it permanently turned Dani's hair white, hence the nickname.</p><p>
  <b>Personality and traits:</b>
</p><p>- Dani's father often describes her as a Mini-Newt implying that she is very much like her Grandfather.</p><p>- Dani, at an early age, became interested in magical creatures and muggle creatures as she spent most of her childhood climbing trees to look at bird nests.</p><p>- Dani feels more comfortable around creatures than she does around humans.</p><p>- Dani is determined when she puts her mind to something, once spending three days sitting in the garden waiting to see a Gruffalo, a fictional creature Vis told her lived in the huge oak tree at the end of the yard. (She cried for hours when Ray told her it was a lie, she and Vis didn't talk for two months after)</p><p>- Dani is a deeply compassionate girl, and forms strong bonds of friendship, remaining loyal in the face of hardships.</p><p>- She was raised to not be the sort of person to discriminate against people based on their heritage or beliefs.</p><p>- Just like her grandfather Dani is morally bound to always do the right thing, without any regard for safety, personal gain or even her own well being.</p><p>- Dani, even if scared, will always push on, showing that she inherited her mother's courage and bravery in the face of her own fear.</p><p>- Dani is polite and well-spoken but filled with quiet determination. She is intelligent and knows that she is free to pursue her own path.</p><p>- Dani reciprocates the loyalty of those around her with gratitude and compassion, especially her inner circle of friends and her dragon.</p><p>
  <b>- After two years at Hogwarts, Dani has grown into her status as Shadow-Kissed, she is less self-conscious about her appearance. She has more confidence in who she is. She has also excelled at her studies, proving to be one of the top students alongside Hermione. Whilst she is starting to accept her Shadow-Kissed title, she still hasn't fully accepted that that is what she is, she still struggles with her 'dreams'. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>- Dani's closest friends are Neville and Hermione, both of whom were braver to approach her in the first year and easy friendships were formed. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>- Harry and Dani share a bond, with similar history regarding being marked by death and the loss of mother's. Harry often confides in Dani when he feels Ron or Hermione wouldn't understand.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Possessions:</b>
</p><p><b>Wand:</b> Dani's wand was made of white Ash, 11inch in length and dragon heartstring core.</p><p><b>Locket:</b> Dani wears a locket that contains two photos, one of her mother and one of Dani and Vis with her.</p><p><b>Niffler:</b> Dani is often accompanied by her niffler, Callie, given to her after her mother's death by her father, and named in tribute. Callie is Dani's best friend, given how children are afraid of her. (She will sneak her into Hogwarts) <b>Callie likes to ride Drogon like a horse, they steal stuff together and horde it.</b></p><p>
