    <p>Credence had mixed feelings about Halloween. The candy, the costumes, even tang in the air that smacked of devilry and hedonism made his hands twitch and the skin on his back crawl. <i>Surely,</i> he thought somewhere back in his hindbrain as he drew the paintbrush across his face, <i>Mary Lou will walk in and blow a blood vessel to see the sin you’re plastering all over your face.</i></p><p>The door behind him clicked, and he jumped, sending a streak of green shooting across his cheekbone.</p><p>“Are you ready, Cr—oh, sorry.”</p><p>Credence sighed and wrested control over his thundering heart. “It’s OK, Albus." He smiled in the mirror. “Cool sugar skull.”</p><p>“Thanks,” he said, dimples popping under the white face paint. “You want some help with yours?”</p><p>Credence handed him the brush and sat back while Albus pulled a pair of half-moon glasses out of a pocket and leaned forwards to wipe the smudge of green away. He frowned slightly and gripped his jaw as he completed a dotted ring around his eye to match the one Credence had already managed. Albus’ painting was cute and random, a treble clef on his forehead, sunflowers blooming at his hairline, but it wasn’t as colourful as Credence’s. He’d had enough of the dark.</p><p>“There you are.” The soft-spoken man sat back with a smile. “Perfect, if I do say so myself.”</p><p>He nodded at his reflection and Albus clicked a photo with Credence’s own mini-SLR. “Thought we should have at least one picture of the photographer.” He hummed at the little playback screen. “You should send this one to Percival,” he said, with a sly, sideways look.</p><p>“And why would I do that?” Credence asked, grabbing the camera out of Albus' hands. He was pleased he’d managed to keep his voice steady, and that the white face paint covered any trace of a blush. He grimaced at the photo. His hair was messy, and one skinny collarbone was slipping out of the shirt he’d borrowed from Albus.</p><p>“Don’t you delete that.” Albus tilted his chin up, his English accent making him sound imperious. “It's my property.”</p><p>Credence rolled his eyes and turned the camera off, following the drummer to Gellert’s penthouse suite. Music and heat hit him like a physical blow when the door opened. The room heaved with bodies dressed in the Dia de los Muertos theme, skeletons and sugar skulls and lace everywhere. Someone had rounded up all the pretty men and women from the gig, and the acid tang of excitement verging on panic oozed off them. Without this job and the desensitisation of four months of touring with The Deathly Hallows, Credence could so easily have been one of them.</p><p>Even with his face paint a couple of people recognised Albus, and a flutter ran through the crowd ahead of them. Albus ignored it with his usual serene smile and led the way to a leather couch pressed against a plate glass window, the lights of New York twinkling behind.</p><p>Percival moved along to sit on the arm of the couch as they came closer, and Credence’s belly swirled hot when he saw those warm brown eyes crinkle in greeting. He dared to take the place Percival had just left free, leather still warm from his body. Albus curled up on the other side against Gellert, who coughed out a smoke-filled laugh around his cigarette. “I can’t believe you idiots all made such an effort with the costumes. That’s for the punters, not for us.” He traced one long finger over Albus’ sunflower. “Love the way you’re showing off your receding hairline, babe,” he purred. “It’s always good to have a sense of humour about your flaws.”</p><p>Albus’ ears pinked and he put one hand up to his widow’s peak reflexively, his smile dimming slightly. </p><p>“Credence, on the other hand…if I lick that sugar skull of yours I think you might just taste as sweet as you look.” He ran the back of a knuckle along Credence’s cheekbone, and his shoulders hunched reflexively. He should be used to Gellert by now. Everyone always said, that was just his way, but Credence couldn’t bring himself to laugh it off, not when it made the light in Albus’ bright blue eyes go dim, or when Percival’s fists clenched reflexively. </p><p>“Leave the boy alone,” said Albus. “I don’t think—“</p><p>“No, you never do,” smirked Gellert. “You know what they say about drummers.” He laughed as Albus looked down, and wrapped his arm tighter around his shoulders. “You know I’m only joking, baby. Cheer up. It's Halloween, the eye candy is out in full force, and we’ve only got two weeks left of touring before we can ditch this country for an island in the South Pacific.” He licked the curve of Albus’ ear, and Credence averted his gaze quickly, embarrassed by the spike of arousal he felt on hearing his friend's shuddering breath.</p><p>“What a drink, kid?" Percival’s big hand landed hot on his shoulder and didn’t much help the warmth curling in his belly. He nodded, trying not to lean into the contact, and followed him through the writhing crowd to the drinks table in the lounge. He let himself indulge as he walked, running his eyes up the length of Percival’s body, up his black jeans, the tight button down shirt, the white flecks in the cropped black hair at the back of his head. He turned just then and caught Credence looking, his lip quirking, and Credence made himself hold his gaze with a polite return smile rather than blushing and turning away. His eyelashes fluttered as he battled with his reflexes, but he held his head high.</p><p>Percival held out a vodka and coke, and Credence’s smile grew more genuine. Percival Graves knew what he liked to drink. He closed his eyes to enjoy the cold drink running through him, and when he looked back Percival’s eyes were boring into him, his own glass hovering just before his parted lips. He cleared his throat when Credence blinked at him. “Your, uh. Your hair looks different away from your face like that. I mean…obviously.” He frowned and gulped his drink.</p><p>“It feels weird,” Credence admitted. “I didn’t realise how much peripheral vision I was missing out on.”</p><p>Percival chuckled. “Yeah, you do hide behind the curtains a bit.”</p><p>“Do I?” He frowned. He had thought he was getting better.</p><p>“Not all the time,” Percival hurried to assure him. “Only when you’re embarrassed.”</p><p>Credence looked down, feeling his face heat, and was viscerally aware of the lack of curls to fall around his cheeks and cut him off. Now Percival could see his smile. He probably wondered what the hell he was grinning about, it wasn’t like it was a compliment. Just, the thought that Percival had been watching him, noticing -</p><p>No. Don’t be stupid. He turned his smile into a more formal thing and looked back up at the beautiful face. Even thick white paint couldn’t hide the slim cupids’ bow of his upper lip, the strong lines of his face.His sugar skull was one of the simplest, and all the more effective for it, little black designs marking his lips, his high forehead. Credence had a vivid image of the mess they would make of each other if they kissed.</p><p>“There they are.” A wiry arm landed on his shoulder and he jumped, to Gellert’s delight. “Twitchy little thing, aren’t you?” he hummed in Credence’s ear, and Credence wondered if he was imagining the way Percival’s hand tightened on his glass, the lowering of his brow.</p><p>“Are you enjoying yourself, Credence?” asked Gellert. “See anything you like?” He gestured to the room and Credence saw men and women in the crowd look up at them, eyes hooded in invitation.</p><p>“Look at them,” Gellert sighed, his nose brushing the hinge of Credence’s jaw. “They’re probably more your age than ours. Probably younger.” He pulled him even closer, so he was pressed against his shoulder, and lifted his arm away from Albus’ neck to point at a pretty young woman. Her short top rose as she danced to expose a concave length of warm brown skin. “I bet she’s only just eighteen. I think she’d look exquisite writhing under you, tipping her head back, just like she’s doing now, when you fuck into her. Hmm?”</p><p>Credence cleared his throat. “I…I don’t know about that, sir.” <i>Sir?</i> Where the fuck had that come from? He felt suddenly catapulted right back into his sixteen year old self. He cleared his throat again as Gellert laughed, head thrown back and long blonde hair tickling Credences’ ear.</p><p>“Sir? I’m not her father, Scamander. Go on.” He gave him a shove. “Go get your dick wet. I promise not to watch. Much.”</p><p>“I…I’m not…” He gritted his teeth and made himself straighten up. He was not ashamed. “I’m gay, actually.”</p><p>Gellert grinned, shark like, and his bright blue eyes glinted. “Well, now, you’ve kept that quiet. Think of all the fun we could have been having.”</p><p>“Gellert,” Albus started, but he didn’t even have to acknowledge him for Albus to trail off, defeated.</p><p>“How old are you, Credence?”</p><p>“Twenty two.”</p><p>Gellert hummed, looking him up and down. “When you were eighteen did you have a poster of us on your wall? It was only four years ago, would have been, what? Around the time The Elder Wand came out?”</p><p>Credence looked down but couldn’t help the self-deprecating smile as he nodded.</p><p>He whooped cupped Credence’s face in both hands. “You did? I love this. Which poster was it, go on?”</p><p>Credence rolled his eyes. “The scrapyard,” he mumbled.</p><p>“Oh yeah. Very…tame.” He shrugged, then smirked and tipped Credence’s head up. “It was by your bed, wasn’t it?” he crooned. “Which one of us did you look at when you had your hand wrapped around your own cock, Credence?”</p><p>Credence tried, he really did. But his eyes betrayed him, flickering to Percival without his permission as Gellert’s smooth voice drew out the memories. He refocused on the lead singer’s face as fast as possible, praying to a God he’d long turned his back on that nobody had noticed.</p><p>No luck. Something, something dark and sharp passed across his narrowing eyes, chased away by a wicked smirk. “The bassist?” he grinned. “How…alternative of you.”</p><p>Credence didn’t know where the conversation would have gone because his phone shrieked in his pocket, making him jump violently. Even Gellert twitched back, releasing his face. Credence pulled the mobile out with shaking fingers and answered it, not caring that he didn’t recognise the number if it gave him an excuse to escape to the hotel corridor. The music thumped at his back as he leaned on the wall. “Hello?”</p><p>“Credence?”</p><p>He frowned and jammed a finger in one ear. “Chastity, is that you?”</p><p>“Oh, thank God,” she gasped. “I didn’t know if you’d still be using the same number, I—"</p><p>“Are you OK?” he asked sharply, worry spiking as she babbled on the other end. “Chas, where are you?”</p><p>“It’s not me, I’m fine,” she said. “I'm at my flat but…I saw them. Ma and Modesty and…I’m scared, Cree.”</p><p>“What happened? Do you need me to come over?”</p><p>There was a strange crackling on the line. Her hair moving against the mic as she shook her head, he guessed. “No, it's just…she was wearing a halloween costume…”</p><p>“Who? Ma?”</p><p>“No! Moddy. She…she had little devil horns on and I saw Ma grab her and pull them off, and then she was dragging her across the street, all her friends calling her and everything and…I know she’s only got four more years before she can get out legally, but I'm so worried, she was always more feisty than us. Cree, what if Ma really hurts her? Like, more than you? What if Modesty tries to stand up to her?”</p><p>Chastity’s voice was hard to make out it was shaking so hard, and she trailed off into sniffles and gulping sobs. Credence’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“I’ll go get her,” he said.</p><p>“Oh, God, you can’t, Credence,” she gasped. “She’ll kill you for sure, and even if she doesn’t she’ll call the police on you for kidnapping and—“</p><p>“It’ll be fine, Chastity,” he said, steel slithering into his veins like smoke. “She doesn’t scare me any more.”</p><p>His trembling hands showed that for the lie it was, but this wasn’t the time. He’d been free for six years, he should have gone back long ago for his sisters. He’d been a coward. He should never have listened when Chastity told him they could wait it out, they could handle her til they were sixteen and legally free. After all, Credence had been the scapegoat, she’d never laid a hand on the girls.</p><p>But with Credence gone, who had filled that gap in Mary-Lou Barebone’s life? Who satisfied that part of her that needed to punish? Credence had believed his sisters because he had wanted to, so badly, he’d wanted to stretch out and grow into his skin, and he’d let them take his place.</p><p>“Credence?” Percival’s voice made him jump, adrenaline sending tremors into every muscle. “Are you OK?”</p><p>Funny how a skeleton could look so warm. Percival’s brown eyes radiated concern and Credence leaned towards him, a plant soaking up the sun. “I have to go. My sister’s in trouble.”</p><p>Percival nodded. “Right. Come on then.”</p><p>“…what?”</p><p>“You don’t have a car, do you? I do, and I haven’t had any booze either. What’s the address?”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” he protested, trotting along to the elevator in Percival’s wake.</p><p>“No, of course I don’t have to,” he snorted. “But what sort of person would I be if I didn’t help?”</p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Credence directed Percival through the city streets to his old home on autopilot, a fierce determination settling in his bones. But then he was standing on the sidewalk, looking up at the dingy block of flats he’d grown up in, fists clenching and unclenching, and he found he couldn’t move. <p>Percival's arm on him made him flinch violently, but he rubbed his bicep firmly with a thumb, and Credence could feel the man’s strength soaking into him, giving his muscles the impetus to walk to the front door. </p><p>The intercom was still broken, and they got in with just a firm shove. Credence took a deep breath and pulled ahead, leading Percival up the steps. The buckles on his boots chinked as he ascended flight after flight, not allowing himself to doubt that Modesty needed him. Because if he second guessed his instincts, he might turn away, and he had to know.</p><p>They heard the shouting the moment he pushed the fire door open from the stairwell onto the eighth floor. “Little witch! How dare you defy me like that, I am your mother. I’ve given you everything, and this is how you repay me?”</p><p>There was a slapping sound that made Credence cringe and rage all at once, and he raced to the door, barely aware of Percival following behind.</p><p>“I hate you,” screamed Modesty, her voice wet with tears. “You’re an evil old hag.” There was another slap and a shriek that made Credence’s blood burn with terror. “You can do what you like to me, I’m not scared,” yelled his brave, stupid little sister.</p><p>“You’ve accepted the devil,” Mary Lou said, her voice suddenly cold and calm, though still breathless with exertion and maybe something else. Credence hammered and kicked the door. “Satan is winning the battle for your soul, but I’ll cast him out. I’ll save you.”</p><p>“What are you—“ Modesty’s voice was threadlike with panic and Credence tore at his hair. Before he could think, Percival kicked out beside him, and with a splintering sound the door jamb peeled apart around the lock.Credence and Percival raced in, straight to Modesty’s side. She stood hunched behind the kitchen counter, her lower arms and cheeks marked with lashes that Credence knew well from experience. Percival took her by the shoulders while Credence stood between them and his erstwhile mother. She held a pan in one hand, empty and clean, the base discoloured from the flame that still burned uncovered on the hob.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this? How dare you break into my home?”</p><p>"I'm taking Modesty, Ma,” he said. The fear was trying to hurl itself through his body, vomit bravery and recklessness all over the clean kitchen lino and bow his head to her will again. Stand in front of his sisters the only way he’d ever been able to, but this time he swallowed it down.</p><p>“Satan,” she hissed, breathing pure hatred. He recognised it so well. “See what you’ve brought upon yourself, child," she said to Modesty. “Two demons sent to drag you straight to hell. Come here, choose the light and we’ll cast them out together.”</p><p>Credence didn’t turn away from danger, but he heard Modesty shake her head. “I’m going with them.” Her voice trembled. “Hell can’t be worse than life with you.”</p><p>“I should have sacrificed you to the lord when you were still pure,” she spat at Credence, and he felt himself flinching like a teenager. “I knew you were wrong when I first laid eyes on you, bringing nothing but pain. Now you corrupt your sisters, lead them into your pit of depravity. I should have helped the lord take you years ago, for now you swell the ranks of the fallen. Deviant, aberrant, foul thing.”</p><p>“Credence,” said Percival, his firm voice cutting through the fog building around himself with every one of his mother’s words. “Let’s go, Modesty needs a doctor.”</p><p>“You will not win this battle, Satan! I’ll have the police on you, two deviants stealing a child away from her mother. Modesty, you fight the devil! I will get you back, and we’ll exorcise the demon from under your skin and come unto the lord—“</p><p>Percival grabbed Credence by the scruff of his neck and dragged him and Modesty out. He wasn’t sure who was shaking more, himself or his sister.</p><p>“Is it really you, Cree?”</p><p>He’d forgotten the skull makeup on his face. That probably hadn't helped matters. He glimpsed his own reflection as they stumbled from the building. The colours had run with sweat, smudged and indistinct on his forehead and mouth where he’d rubbed in his worry. “Yeah, it’s me.”</p><p>“Are you OK, kid?" asked Percival, hustling them both to his car. “I’m taking you to hospital right now.”</p><p>“Oh no, there’s no—“</p><p>“Yeah, there is. Your mom’s going to get the cops involved, so we need as much evidence on our side as possible.”</p><p>“Where am I going to go then?” she asked, almost of herself.</p><p>“Home with me,” said Credence immediately. “I should have come for you years ago.”</p>
