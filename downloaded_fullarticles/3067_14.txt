  <span>It was silent in his room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just the flipping of pages when the need to move on arose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was peaceful.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s been a week,” She sipped her tea, “How is he doing?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had taken to reading like a wildfire takes to dry grass.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While his eyes danced from on word to the next, he found himself busy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>To busy to think about his uncle.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“He’s quiet,” He adjusted the sleeves of his black robe. “Which is understandable.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If his nose was in a book his mind couldn’t wander.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It couldn’t remember the sounds of his bones snapping.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It couldn’t dwell on the sound of pained breaths. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“He’s taken to reading, anything in sight, anything in reach.” The other man had added.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>So while he reads of spell to alter gravitational pull,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He ignored his memories of his uncle standing over him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something evil gleaming in his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ve seen the darkness in his eyes, he seems to be struggling with suicidal thoughts.” The first said sullenly.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was so engrossed in his book that when he flipped the page, he couldn’t stop the yelp.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wand in the man’s hand was transformed into a whip.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The blockade broke and his memories swarmed him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“How are his flashbacks?” She placed the cup on the saucer and stared at the two on the couch.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was against the wall, arms raised over his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tears and blood mixed and trickled down his face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The pain was attacking from all angles.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“They put him in a dissociative state. A mind healer has been working with him every morning.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Please, Ple-I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t know what he was sorry for but the words tumbled from his lips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A pathetic attempt to appease his angered uncle.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Her fingers tapped against her knee, “And his relatives?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then he felt something cold and wet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A weird sensation on his face pulled him back to his body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And he was looking into the eyes of a chocolate lab.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The two men shared a nasty grin before turning towards the woman with graying hair.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus was suddenly at his side. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was whispering words of comfort as his dog rested her head on his thigh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus was standing in the doorway with a pained expression. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh,” The dark haired man started, “we have plans for them.”</span>
  </em>
