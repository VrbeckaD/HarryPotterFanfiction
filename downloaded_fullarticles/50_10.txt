    <p>A distant screech echoes through the otherwise silent forest. It is painted black with nightfall, the twisted gnarled trees block the meager light of a waning moon. The air is thick with humidity. The underbrush crunches and breaks as the wizard wades his way to the center of the wood. His cloak is as black as the night around him.</p><p>The sound of a twig snaps behind the wizard.</p><p>He freezes, turns to stare into the void behind him, eyes straining to make sense of the shapes. An animal darts across the path behind him, he relaxes. No one else should be here, it is forbidden after all.</p><p>“You’re late.” He starts at the voice, whipping around in the other direction. The other figure is cloaked in darkness, hood drawn, nearly camouflaged into the tree they lean against.</p><p>He bows. “My apologies.”</p><p>The figure tilts its head. “Were you followed?”</p><p>The wizard shakes his head. “Of course not.” He waits but the other figure remains completely silent. He pats the perspiration beading along his brow. Cloaks are not the most practical garments for the end of summer. “Did you bring it?”</p><p>A small pouch soars through the air between them. The wizard catches it with deft hands. He peers inside but it is too dark to see. He looks up at the figure. “What is it?”</p><p>“Does it matter?” He hears a smile in their voice.</p><p>He swallows. “I suppose not.”</p><p>“That is the correct answer. There are directions on the tag, memorize them then incinerate them. It must be used within twenty-four hours.”</p><p>“Of course, thank you.” He waits for further instructions. He receives none. “I’ll just…make my way back then.”</p><p>He is several paces away when his companion speaks again. “The window of opportunity is closing swiftly. You know the role you are to play in this and it is but a single thread in an otherwise detailed tapestry. Do not disappoint me.” It is a threat.</p><p>He clenches his jaw. “I know what is being asked of me and I am more than capable of locating the tomb, the sword, <em>and</em> the boy.”</p><p>“Let us hope so. The fate of magic rests on this prophecy. Do not forget that.”</p><p>With a crack loud as thunder the other figure is gone, the forest still and silent once more, and the wizard begins his long journey back through the forest.</p><p>As long as the wizard follows his orders, by this time tomorrow the Minister of Magic will be well on his way to a slow, painful death.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>The pale gray of the early morning fog still clings to the ground outside the small inn at the end of the lane. The Rising Sun sits apart from the rest of the town, the sleepy village of Hogsmeade preparing for the yearly invasion of students returning to school after a summer back at home.</p><p>In the former servants quarters of what was once a large estate (renovated into private living rooms when the current innkeeper converted the building nearly twenty years ago) Merlin sleeps straight through his third alarm and pulls the covers tight around his gangly limbs. He doesn’t quite register the alarm going off or the voice yelling at him.</p><p>“Five more minutes,” he mumbles into the pillow.</p><p>He’s dreaming about dragons or knights or maybe knights fighting a dragon; it’s all still fuzzy around the edges. He’s in a clearing; dressed modestly in a brown jacket and scuffed boots and a dozen men in chainmail surround him. The sulfuric stench of dragon’s fire hangs in the air around them, steam curls off the scorched grass. There’s a man: gold and shiny, with a cape red as blood and beautiful enough to stop Merlin’s heart in its tracks. He’d die for him, in this dream, and as the man lifts his sword and yells a garbled dream-word that Merlin can’t decipher, he realizes all the men in chainmail feel the same way. Something like pride squeezes his heart so tight he can’t breathe.</p><p>“Merlin!” His eyes snap open as he’s ripped from sleep by the storm that is his mother. Gone are the men and the dragon and his prince and instead his familiar cramped, messy bedroom swims before him.</p><p>The room looks like a tornado hit it: books scattered over the floor; clothing strewn in piles based on what to take and what to leave behind; his white cat Aithusa glaring at him from deep within one of those piles (hopefully not one of clean laundry); quills and notebooks and random scraps of parchment are scattered everywhere from when he dumped the contents of the trunk at the onset of summer. Packing has never been his forte. The door that separates their living area from the inn kitchen slams and Merlin jumps off bed grabbing the nearest article of clothing. If his mother sees the state of this room she is definitely going to kill him.</p><p>“I’m awake!” He yells back. He runs a hand through his hair, making the tangled jet-black mess stand up even higher. He curses softly as he attempts to wrangle his arms into a button down. With a quick pass through the bathroom he is down the stairs in a matter of minutes, washed and brushed up, and looking (hopefully) presentable enough for his mother.</p><p>Hunith Emrys levels him with her best disproving glare as he skids to a stop in front of her. Despite the near foot of height he now has on his mother, she is still terrifying. She is in her usual attire of a loose fitting blouse and floor length skirt. She has always preferred muggle clothes to wizard garb, something Merlin agrees with. She also firmly believes in cleaning and cooking the muggle way as “hard work speaks for itself,” something Merlin doesn’t agree with.</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips, waiting.</p><p>Merlin shrinks further into himself. “I overslept…” his mother only raises one eyebrow in response. Oh right, she had specifically told him <em>not</em> to do that and that there would be hell to pay if he did. Because September 1<sup>st </sup>was their second busiest day of the year with nervous parents reluctant to send their children away for so long and other families who use the day as an annual reunion.</p><p>“I’ll get started now?” His face breaks into his best beguiling smile. He’s been perfecting it for years: when he would knock over priceless heirlooms (why would they put stuff like that in the inn anyway?) or accidentally use his wandless magic to stich said heirlooms back together again or lie about the entire situation even though his mother could see right through him.</p><p>Hunith rolls her eyes but the smile she’s fighting lets him know he’s off the hook, mostly. “There’s a plate for you in the dining room and then a list of chores I need help with before check-in starts . And you’re sure you’re okay not taking the train again this year?”</p><p>“Yes, mum. As I’ve said for the past<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>five years</em>,” Merlin skirts around her and heads out toward the inn, “it doesn’t make any sense for us to go all the way to London just so I can take a train and end up down the street.” The kitchen is a flurry of activity, all the employees working to prepare for so many guests. He snags an apple tart behind the cook’s back and takes huge bite as he calls over to his mother, speaking around the crumbs. “It would just be a huge waste of time. And I’m happy to help.”</p><p>His mother shoots him a look somewhere near fondness and exasperation and runs her hand through his hair. She presses a kiss to his temple. “And I’m happy to have your help.” She swats him on the head with a dishtowel. “So get to it.”</p><p>Merlin laughs and pushes through the swinging doors from the kitchen to the inn proper. The huge open lobby greets him, the thatch ceiling visible between the rafters, a roaring fire already blazing away in the stone hearth, the sea of mismatched tables and chairs nearly empty at this time of morning. He waves at Alice behind the check-in desk along the far wall and heads over to the mismatched tables placed around the great room toward a familiar, surly, old man.</p><p>“Good Morning, Uncle Gaius,” Merlin greets, seating himself behind the plate that is overflowing with all his favorite foods.</p><p>The sigh Gaius heaves is heavy enough to coat the room. Merlin quirks an eyebrow. “Or not…?” Gaius is always just a touch away from complete exasperation but this feels more ominous than usual. Panic itches at his skin. “Is something wrong?”</p><p>Instead of replying, Gaius just sighs<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>again</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>and tosses Merlin the newspaper. Merlin raises his eyebrows at the tabloid before him. Gaius would rather be caught dead than read such “drivel.” The main headline reads, “The Mad Minister?” with a moving picture of Minister for Magic Uther Pendragon gnashing his teeth at the camera.</p><p>Merlin’s heart sinks in his chest. A quick skim tells Merlin that Uther Pendragon had some sort of breakdown during his speech at a press conference two days ago, raving about a “plague of magic poisoning the land” before he collapsed on stage. He grabs the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Daily Prophet</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>out of Gaius’ hands and ignores the “really, my boy haven’t you any patience?” and sees a much kinder article (no doubt written by the Minister’s PR team) about how Uther Pendragon has fallen ill and is currently being treated in St. Mungo’s. His family is asking for privacy at this time.</p><p>Merlin worries his lip. The Pendragon family was the closest thing the wizarding world had to royalty. Despite the connections they clearly had to pure blood elitists their name still carried a significant amount of weight in the community, their lineage allegedly extending back centuries. Uther Pendragon had been appointed Minister for Magic eight years prior. His traditionalist views were a far cry from many of the progressive policies that were installed before him and he was slowly dismantling them one by one.</p><p>Merlin sits back heavily and stares at Gaius. They should be rejoicing that such a horrible man might be out of power but Gaius was acting as if something worse was coming. “What does this mean?”</p><p>Gaius sighs. Or at least Merlin thinks he’s sighing. Given how often he’s been doing it these past few minutes there’s every chance that this is just how he breathes now, long and heavy, slow and weighed down with all the problems of the world. “I don’t know what you are asking, Merlin.”</p><p>Merlin leans forward. “Gaius, there’s no Minister.” He feels a bit stupid for pointing out something so obvious.</p><p>Gaius raises the infamous brow and Merlin does his best not to whither under the gaze. He very nearly succeeds. “The government is built to function with the absence of one man.” Merlin furrows his brow. But Uther Pendragon isn’t one man. He’s practically a tyrant, enacting the strictest magic laws since…well probably Voldemort if you asked Merlin. There was anti-Shapeshifter legislation primarily focused on werewolves but affecting plenty of other people as well. Anti-discriminatory policies against muggleborns and Squibs were quietly dissolved. His entire platform was built on making certain Magical Beings feel othered. Merlin bites his tongue so he doesn’t say any of this to Gaius. Gaius sends him a measuring look and Merlin thinks he might be able to read his mind.</p><p>He holds his breath as Gaius continues, “more so, didn’t you read the article? There’s to be an Interim Minister.” Gaius’ face scrunches up the way Merlin’s does when he drinks one of Gaius’ healing potions. “Agravaine de Bois.”</p><p>Merlin’s jaw drops. “<em>Agravaine</em>?” he hisses. “He’s worse than Uther!” Agravaine had ties to people who supported Voldemort<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>both</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>times but had somehow weaseled out of any actual implications and even secured himself a safe job at the Ministry, apparently high enough to become the bloody Minister. Merlin swallows. “Can’t you…do something?”</p><p>Gaius smiles, a small sad broken smile that shouldn’t ever paint his features. “Despite your unwavering faith Merlin, I am not as powerful as you seem to believe.”</p><p>“But,” he pouts, “you work at Hogwarts…that’s got to count for something.”</p><p>Gaius pats his hand. “You shouldn’t worry too much about it. There’s plenty of upstanding wizards in the government working to fight for a good cause.” There are also plenty of bad wizards hoping to push their insidious agendas, but once again Merlin doesn’t point this out. “Much more than a sixteen year old boy is capable of, I’m sure.”</p><p>Merlin pouts harder and morosely eats his toast. “Not Harry Potter,” he mumbles and is awarded with a throaty chuckle from Gaius.</p><p>“But you aren’t Harry Potter. And I would not wish such a fate on you.” Gaius mouth quirks slightly. “And you really shouldn’t talk about your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor that way, Merlin.”</p><p>Merlin rolls his eyes. Though he would admit that he was a bit star-struck back in first year when he met the man, the thrill had quickly worn off when he learned how fond the man was of assigning essays and<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>puns</em>.</p><p>“Plus,” Gaius adds, looking at him over his mug of tea, “you should be more concerned about how this news is affecting your friends.”</p><p>Merlin flushes in embarrassment. Despite how much he hated Uther Pendragon and everything his government stood for, his first thought should have been of the man’s children. Poor Morgana. And Arthur too. Though he wouldn’t consider the boy his friend he couldn’t imagine going through something like this, let alone on such a public platform. His gaze flickers once more to the tabloid, which features a smaller picture of Arthur and Morgana. The two are being ushered into St. Mungo’s behind a sea of security personnel. Arthur’s broad shoulders eclipse Morgana from view and he keeps turning to glare out of the picture. It almost makes Merlin smile. Even Arthur in picture form is a bit of a prat.</p><p>“Merlin!” His mother’s voice rings through the room and he stuffs the piece of bread in his mouth, abruptly halting his thoughts in their track. He gives Gaius a sheepish grin as he races off to help his mother, grumbling under his breath that Harry Potter probably never had to do chores.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>The train carriage rocks back and forth, the uneven rails jerking the cart sharply every few minutes but Arthur keeps his face pressed against the cool glass allowing the occasional beating of his head against the pane.</p><p>Morgana sits across from him, the two of them alone in the car. He hadn’t ridden the train with Morgana…ever. Even on their first day she had raced ahead of him and denied ever knowing him even though they were twins (though they didn’t look like it) and shared a surname and were children of an incredibly prominent figure in the Ministry.</p><p>They have the car to themselves for now but he knows Gwen is in the next car and he can practically feel her vibrating, desperate to sit next to Morgana and comfort her as best friends are wont to do. And if Gwen is there that means Lance is too and he has never been afraid of pushing Arthur when he thinks he needs it. And Elyan is probably trying to hold Gwen back. And Gwaine and Leon are likely there as well and maybe even Percival although Arthur can’t figure out who in their group Percival could possibly get along with, the boy is just too nice. And that’s not even factoring Morgana’s housemates into the equation. If he didn’t feel so awful, he’d probably peak his head around to check out the clown car next to them, it had to be a tight squeeze.</p><p>Morgana is staring, or rather<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>glaring</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>out the window at the absolutely picturesque landscape flying by. She’s probably debating whether or not to risk using magic to make the weather as miserable as she is. He almost smiles, Morgana was always one for drama. Despite both of them being prefects, the Ravenclaw representative Mithian had (rather nervously) informed them that they were exempt from their duties for the first night and they should meet with their heads of houses upon their return. Arthur’s not particularly looking forward to that conversation. Longbottom was going to butter him up with biscuits and tea and make him talk about his<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>feelings</em>. He rather envied Morgana, Arthur would much rather talk to Gaius.</p><p>“Morgana,” he starts but he doesn’t know where to go. She doesn’t glance at him but he sees her knuckles tighten on her robes. Maybe she wants to hit something, he knows he does. “We can go back.”</p><p>Now the glare is on him and he swears his clothes are sizzling, just from her gaze alone. “And do<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>what</em>?” she hisses.</p><p>Arthur looks down at his folded hands. “Be there.”</p><p>Morgana takes a shuddering breath. “Well, the only lucid statement our father has been able to communicate in the past two days was that he wanted us far away from him.” He meets her fierce gaze, wet with unshed tears. “Who am I to deny him his dying wish?” The last word is strangled and she looks back out the window.</p><p>He wants to argue with her, that isn’t strictly what their father said (though the sentiment is undeniably the same) and he’s not dying (however if he has been infected with what the Healers believe then death won’t be far off) and that Morgana never did what their father wanted anyway (of course, neither did Arthur) but he hasn’t the energy. The past 48 hours have been hellish and exhausting and the only saving grace about this whole situation is that he’s going to the one place that actually feels like home.</p><p>He and his sister have a complicated relationship with their father, a man absent more than he was present. Morgana had never seen eye to eye with him, always arguing his political beliefs, pushing him to change his mind, questioning his authority. Their father would smile and pat her on the head and applaud her interest in politics. If Arthur had acted that way…well he certainly wouldn’t have been applauded. Where Morgana got praise, Arthur got disappointment. His father constantly pitted the two of them against one another in every aspect of their life and Morgana always won.</p><p>Arthur worked tirelessly to get the best grades in the year (where he came in second,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>thankfully</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>not to Morgana), he got ten OWLS (two more than his sister), was named Quidditch Captain in his fifth year, was sorted into his father’s own house (Morgana went to Slytherin for gods sake), and yet still Morgana was the golden child and Arthur was the disappointment. Morgana always told him not to care about what the older man thought. It wasn’t until his fifth year that he started to believe her.</p><p>Now his father was dying. This morning at the hospital might be the last time he ever saw him but the man (barely grasping consciousness) was more worried about how it would look if his children didn’t show up for school and he sent them off without so much as a “goodbye.”</p><p>Morgana lets out a humorless chuckle. “And our Uncle has made it perfectly clear that we aren’t welcome.” And that was really the cherry on top of the shit show sundae. Even if their father hadn’t sent them away, Agravaine had practically thrown them out of the hospital with strict orders not to return without his permission.</p><p>Agravaine who had shown up out-of-the-blue at the beginning of summer. Agravaine who his father openly detested suddenly moved in to an empty room in the manner. Agravaine who now was responsible for making decisions about his father’s health, his position, and clearly his children.</p><p>The whole situation was disgusting and suspicious and Arthur wanted to shut his brain off entirely before he thought too much about what it might mean. It certainly wasn’t his job to figure it out.</p><p>“Knock, knock.” Gwen’s face is peaking through the sliding door, hopeful and earnest. Morgana looks to Arthur who just shrugs. Neither of them are terribly good at telling Gwen “no.” She lets herself in followed by Lance (a tactical choice on their friends' part, he’s sure). Morgana and he had always kept a wide separation between their friend groups; desperate to not have to be near one another while at school. It wasn’t until the end of last year that they started to bleed together. Arthur can’t decide if he wants to clot the wound before its too late.</p><p>Morgana wipes her face. “I don’t want to talk about it,” her tone if firm but much nicer than it had been when she was talking to Arthur. Gwen only nods and sits next to her and holds her hand. Lance seats himself on Arthur’s bench with nothing but a squeeze to his shoulder to let him know he’s there. Arthur returns his forehead to he chill of the glass but feels a little lighter than he did before. His friends exist outside the world of magical attacks and politics and it almost seems as if everything that’s happened is a distant dream and here in this train car is what is real and possible. And who knows, maybe his friends will help him forget about everything and maybe his father won’t die and this experience will make him stop being an asshole and maybe his biggest worry will actually be if he can finally best Merlin Emrys’ grades this year.</p><p>He won’t hold his breath but a boy’s got to dream.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Merlin’s late to the feast, which isn’t all that surprising as he’s been late for the past three years But this year he actually has a good excuse, sort of, well he has<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>an excuse</em>, which is more than he usually has. He stumbles in through the main doors, green tie eschew, hair rumpled from the wind, and outer cloak missing. The feast is well under way and hardly anyone take notice of him. From across the hall, Gaius seated at the front table hits him with the infamous eyebrow and he quickly skitters over to the Slytherin table. Gwen catches his eye from her seat at the Hufflepuff table, sandwiched between Percival and<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>George of all people</em>, and just shakes her head at him.</p><p>“Dinit fink you’d make it!” Will greets when Merlin folds himself into the seat next to him.</p><p>Merlin makes a show of wiping the food Will has sprayed on him and hits his shoulder affectionately. “You know I like to make an entrance.”</p><p>Freya laughs across from him. “I think it’s less that you<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>like</em><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>to make an entrance and more that you can’t help it.”</p><p>“There was a threstral! It had gotten lost!” Merlin explains, piling his plate with food.</p><p>Morgana laughs next to Freya. Merlin’s gaze snaps up to hers. “Merlin, you can’t even see thestrals,” she says in her usual scathing tone. He tries not to study her too closely. She’s certainly as beautiful as ever, her long hair worn down, the green of her robes making her eyes glow, but her smile is tight and pinched, her eyes keep drifting over Merlin’s shoulder to the other side of the room where he suspects he will find Arthur sitting. Mordred is on her right and gives a subtle shake of his head, curls bouncing. Right, better not ask.</p><p>Morgana has never hid her ill feelings toward her father but Merlin imagined that it couldn’t be easy to watch the man who raised you be reduced to madness.</p><p>He takes a huge bite of mashed potatoes. “That’s why it was so hard to get it back into the barn.”</p><p>“You walked it all the way to the barn?” Morgana admonishes.</p><p>Merlin rolls his eyes. “Obviously,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>it was lost</em>. Plus I threw my cloak over it so I could see it.” He taps his fingers to his temple. “Smart.”</p><p>Morgana raises an eyebrow. “And where is your cloak now?”</p><p>Merlin blushes. “It seemed to like it…” And then Morgana throws her head back and laughs big and loud and real. Merlin watches all his friends relax slightly at the sound. She’ll be okay. It’s going to be painful and arduous but if all it takes to get her to smile is for Merlin to accidently give magical creatures his clothing then he is all too happy to oblige.</p><p>The feast passes quickly after that, his friends sharing their most humiliating stories from the summer holidays to keep the mood light. Will’s dramatic re-telling of Merlin lighting the Forbidden Forest on fire draws attention from several tables over.</p><p>Merlin laughs along but only half pays attention. After he finished with his chores he had grabbed as many newspapers as he could to read up on the political situation. It didn’t look good. Unless Uther was officially ousted or died, Agravaine could continue ruling as Interim Minister. An uneasiness settled low in Merlin’s stomach. He couldn’t help but feel like something awful was happening. And he was just sitting here, eating cauldron cakes, watching the world burn.</p><p>(That was probably a little dramatic. But his gut feelings rarely lead him astray.)</p><p>As his friends make their way from the hall he notices they have formed a bit of a semi-circle, with Morgana firmly placed in the middle. Will has his arms crossed and glares at anyone who so much as dares to look in their direction as they make their way toward the dungeons. A hoard of second-years shrinks under the gaze and run ahead of them.</p><p>Merlin spares one last look over his shoulder before they descend the main stairs. His eyes lock with the other Pendragon sibling, clear on the other side of the hall, surrounded by his Gryffindor classmates. But where Morgana is safely tucked away in the midst of friends, Arthur is at the front of the charge, eyes angry enough to dare anyone to make contact, jaw so tight the muscle might very well snap. Merlin is inexplicably struck with an image from a dream, of a man about to face a dragon with his knights ready at his command. Arthur nods once, snapping Merlin back to reality, and Merlin can’t quite parse what the other boy means by it. But even as he descends the stairs he can’t help but feel like Arthur is staring at the back of his neck. He’s probably plotting ways to make Merlin’s life miserable.</p><p>Right?</p><p>The common room looks the same as always. He loves the dim lighting, the sunken dark wood floors, the deep greens and silvers that make it seem like the room is inside a bottle of absinthe, the huge window looking into the lake is a cloudy as ever and nebulous shapes move across it in leisurely patterns; its beautiful in a dark and brooding way. Morgana excuses herself almost immediately with Freya quickly following. The boys shrug and head to their own dorm. Will immediately throws himself on his bed and glares at Aithusa.</p><p>“Are you sure your cat doesn’t hate me?” He eyes Aithusa warily. She has made herself comfortable on Will’s pillows and is retracting her claws one-by-one as she stares him down.</p><p>Merlin bites back a smile. “I’ve never claimed she doesn’t hate you.”</p><p>Will shakes his head. He reaches out a hand to scratch Aithusa’s ears to which the cat hisses and bares her tiny canines, hair on her spine stood at attention. Will yelps and jumps onto Merlin’s bed instead. “Should have gotten an owl like a normal kid.”</p><p>“Maybe if you didn’t talk about her that way, she’d like you more.”</p><p>Mordred sighs. “Can we please talk about something that matters?” Aithusa hisses at Mordred. When Merlin was young he was convinced she was really a wizard who was just posing as a cat. She was far too sentient. He had not quite given up his beliefs in that particular fantasy.</p><p>Merlin plops down next to Will and Aithusa immediately jumps into his lap to make herself comfortable. Will mumbles something that sounds like,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><em>bloody cat whisperer</em>, and returns to his bed. “Do you mean you want to talk about Morgana?” Merlin asks.</p><p>“Obviously,” Mordred says. “I can’t believe she’s here. I know her and her dad weren’t on the best of terms but…shouldn’t she, I don’t know, take some time to process everything?” Mordred lowers his voice. “What if he dies and she’s not there?”</p><p>Merlin scratches Aithusa behind the ears triggering a motor like rumble from the small creature. He has had all these same thoughts. He hadn’t expected her to be at school at all yet she and her brother were here. But he knew enough about their family to know what that meant. “It probably wasn’t her choice.”</p><p>Will sat up straighter. “You think Arthur made her?”</p><p>Merlin rolls his eyes. “Christ, everyone claims I am his arch-nemesis but you are the one who always wants him to be the villain.” Will scoffs. Merlin ignores him. “I think that Uther Pendragon is a man who is all about appearances. Even in his…state he likely wants to pretend that everything is fine. Sending his kids to school is the easiest way to do that.”</p><p>“Gods,” Mordred says. “Someone needs to talk to her.”</p><p>“By someone, you mean Merlin right?” Will asks.</p><p>Merlin rolls his eyes again. At the rate he was going they were going to get stuck looking at the back of his head. “Well, he certainly didn’t mean you Will. You aren’t exactly good with feelings or emotions or words.” A pillow is lobbed at him from the direction of Will’s bed and Merlin halts it midair, tossing it back with a flick of his wrist. Will lets out an ‘ooff.’ He may have tossed it harder than he meant to. He also promised his mom not to use as much wandless magic this year. The older he got, the harder it was becoming to control. He hadn’t even made it twenty-four hours. That did not bode well for the rest of the year. “But why me? Gwen is her best friend.”</p><p>“Emrys.” Merlin winces. Mordred only uses his last name when he thinks he’s being an idiot. “Gwen lives in a completely different dorm and someone should talk to her sooner rather than later. Just to let her know that her friends are here for her.” Merlin tries to interrupt but Mordred just holds up a hand. “You are the only person she talks to about anything real besides Gwen. She trusts you.”</p><p>Merlin blows a gust of air out of his mouth. He knows they’re right but he has no idea what to say. He wasn’t kidding when he said Gwen should do it. Though he made fun of Will, he wasn’t too good with words either. He was a pretty good listener but he really doubted Morgana wanted to talk about anything. “Fine. I’ll find her before classes tomorrow.” Mordred looks like he wants to argue. “She is already in her dorm and its after hours. With any luck she’s already asleep.”</p><p>Mordred nods once. “Good.”</p><p>Will looks between the two of them. “Can I go back to complaining about Merlin’s cat now?”</p><p>Mordred waves a hand in front of him. “Be my guest.”</p><p>Merlin leans on his bed and ignores his friends. Sixth Year is proving to be exactly like every other year at Hogwarts. Maybe all his worries are unfounded after all.</p><p> </p>
