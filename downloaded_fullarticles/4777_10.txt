    <p>
    The attack happened in his own hotel room. The room had had numerous
    protection spells cast on it, but somehow Grindelwald had broken through
    them. Graves put up a fight; it had been the most difficult duel of his
    life and had lasted over an hour. Long enough for him to see the smug look
    fade from Grindelwald’s face and be replaced with a look of frustration.
    But in the end, Grindelwald had won and Graves had woken up hours later in
    a strange bedroom with no way out.
</p><p>
    Percival had no idea why Grindelwald was keeping him locked up. When the
    director woke up after the duel, he’d assumed Grindelwald wanted to draw
    out his death. To make an example of him. But Grindelwald hadn’t tortured
    him. Hadn’t even treated him all that badly. Instead, Graves was kept
    locked in a large room. He had a bed, books, a toilet, and a shower.
    Graves’ wand had been taken, but he was still able to do small spells. Only
    things like summoning an object across the room or levitating the
    furniture, but the walls of his room were heavily warded to prevent escape.
    Not that Graves didn’t try to break the wards; only he was never able to
    make a hole larger than a dinner plate before passing out. And when
    Grindelwald returned the dark wizard merely redid the wards with a look
    that was halfway between exasperation and admiration, as if Graves were a
    puppy who’d managed to do a seemingly impossible amount of damage despite
    his owner only being gone for a short amount of time.
</p><p>
    What Grindelwald did all day was a mystery to Graves, but during the
    evenings, he allowed Percival out of the room and into whatever hotel room
    they were staying in. They had dinner together, with Grindelwald often
    asking what Graves would prefer to eat and giving him whatever he liked.
    The first night Grindelwald did this, Percival went along with it fairly
    placidly, keeping his rebellion to little quips. The next night, Percival
    waited until Grindelwald had turned before breaking a glass and trying to
    stab his captor with a shard. Of course Grindelwald caught him before
    Percival could so much as graze the other wizard. Graves was punished by
    having a body bind placed on him and the shard of glass being made to hover
    over his eye, sometimes hurtling towards it only to stop at varying
    distances from the organ, never quite touching it, all while Grindelwald
    calmly finished dinner. After that, Graves settled for verbal attacks.
</p><p>
    At first Percival thought the other wizard wanted classified information
    and was trying to get Graves to lower his guard, but Grindelwald never
    asked him about national secrets. Instead, he talked about ordinary things
    like Quidditch and the weather, and asked Graves about his day, hobbies,
    favorite foods, etc. Initially Graves found several colorful ways to tell
    Grindelwald to fuck off, but after a few days of Gellert Grindelwald as his
    only companion, Percival started responding when Grindelwald tried to have
    a conversation. Figuring he had nothing to lose, Graves asked as many
    questions about the other wizard as possible. Grindelwald was remarkably
    candid, answering almost every question except the one Percival cared about
    the most: What did Grindelwald want with him? Whenever Graves asked,
    Grindelwald would just smile and tell him he’d tell Graves when he wanted
    Graves to know.
</p><p>
    It was a bizarre way to live, but Graves counted himself lucky; he’d seen
    the corpses of some of Grindelwald’s former prisoners. The thing that
    bothered the auror the most was that Grindelwald was always watching him.
    At first, Graves thought his captor was keeping an eye on him in case he
    tried to escape, but it was more than that. He watched Graves’ every
    movement with an intensity that made Graves feel as if Grindelwald was
    filing each and every observation away. When they were eating,
    Grindelwald’s mismatched eyes followed Graves’ hand as it lifted each bite
    to is mouth. They studied Percival as he rose from the table. If Graves
    made the smallest gesture, Gellert seemed to take note of it. It was
    unsettling, but there was nothing Graves could do.
</p><p>
    Things went on like this for about a week, when, one day, when Gellert came
    to get Graves, he tossed Graves a neatly pressed suit and told Graves to
    change, that they were going out to eat. For a few moments, Graves just
    stared at him, sure it was some type of trap or joke. But Grindelwald just
    repeated the command and left the room to give him some privacy.
</p><p>
    “Your suit is warded to prevent you from using magic.” Grindelwald told him
    when he returned. “But in case you think about trying to break the wards or
    trying to run, you should keep in mind that I will be by your side at all
    times. You’ll appear as someone else to the other diners.” He cast a charm
    and Graves could feel his features changing. “If you try to alert them to
    who you are or I am, or to your predicament, I will kill every last one of
    them and make you watch. Do you understand?”
</p><p>
    Graves nodded silently. He still wasn’t sure what was going on.
</p><p>
    “Good.”
</p><p>
    Gellert’s features began to change until he looked like a brown-haired man
    with green eyes. Grabbing hold of Percival’s arms, he disapparated them.
    They reappeared in front of a high-scale restaurant. Graves was tempted to
    run. They were on a busy street in a wizarding shopping district and surely
    Grindelwald couldn’t…but, no. Grindelwald wasn’t as blood thirsty as some
    of the criminals Graves dealt with, but there had been cases where he’d
    slaughtered entire crowds of people. Usually there was a reason behind it,
    but Graves didn’t want to find out if his escape would be considered a good
    enough motive.
</p><p>
    They walked up to the front desk and were led to a table in the middle of
    the restaurant. Percival glanced at the menu and noted that none of the
    dishes were under 10 galleons.
</p><p>
    “Order whatever you want.” Grindelwald told him. “You’ve earned a decent
    meal.”
</p><p>
    Graves decided then and there to order the most expensive thing on the
    menu, but Grindelwald didn’t so much as blink when Graves told the waiter.
    After the waiter had left them alone, Graves lowered his voice.
</p><p>
    “Okay, what are we doing here?”
</p><p>
    “Eating.” Grindelwald replied with a raised brow.
</p><p>
    “I know that but…why…why did you bring me here?”
</p><p>
    “I thought you could use a change. It can’t be easy living in one room.”
</p><p>
    Percival ignored the jibe. “Is this some type of game?”
</p><p>
    “Game? No. I just thought it would be a nice gesture. You know you put up
    quite a fight, Mr. Graves. I haven’t been so challenged in years. Consider
    this a reward.”
</p><p>
    Graves didn’t believe him for one moment, but doubted that he’d get a
    better answer. The waiter returned with their food and they ate,
    Grindelwald making small talk and Graves responding as little as possible.
    As always, Gellert watched him, paying attention to which forks Graves uses
    to eat each dish. Following where Graves’ eyes went when he looked around
    the room.
</p><p>
    The director wondered if this dinner was a sign that Grindelwald was going
    to kill him. Was this some type of last supper? But when the dinner came to
    an end and they returned to the hotel, Grindelwald removed the
    transfiguration and thanked Graves for having dinner with him. There was a
    satisfied gleam in Grindelwald’s eyes, as if Graves had given him something
    important. That bothered Graves, but he couldn’t begin to imagine what
    having dinner with the man had revealed.
</p><p align="center">
    …..
</p><p>
    “What do you like to do on your days off?” Grindelwald asked him one day.
    It had been a few days since they’d gone out and nothing had changed in
    their routine.
</p><p>
    “I don’t have many days off.” Graves replied with a chuckle.
</p><p>
    “Well, when you do. Do you go to the opera? The theater? Bars?”
</p><p>
    “Why do you want to know?”
    <br/>
    “Humor me.”
</p><p>
    Graves shrugged. “Sometimes the theater. Occasionally bars, but, mostly I
    just relax.”
</p><p>
    “What type of theater?”
</p><p>
    “I don’t know. Does it matter?”
</p><p>
    “Testy tonight, aren’t you?” Grindelwald raised a brow. “Personally I
    prefer Shakespearean works, but maybe you prefer-“
</p><p>
    “Shakespeare’s fine.” Graves interrupted him. “Classical plays. And humor.
    Anything, really. I’m not picky.”
</p><p>
    Grindelwald nodded, his expression thoughtful. The next day he brought
    Graves another change of clothes and the same warnings before taking him to
    a wizarding production of Macbeth.
</p><p>
    “This is my favorite of Shakespeare’s plays.” Gellert whispered to him as
    the lights dimmed and the play began. “I always wonder whether or not the
    Weird Sisters were setting Macbeth up. You know, back then, they burned
    witches so there was really no reason they should-“
</p><p>
    “Do you mind?” Graves interrupted, not keen on hearing another speech about
    how the No Majs oppressed the wizarding world. “The show’s starting.”
</p><p>
    Grindelwald gave a small chuckle and stopped talking. The play was good.
    The actors were decent, even if the portraits in the No-Maj’s castle had no
    business moving. Graves would have enjoyed it more if Gellert’s eyes
    weren’t fixed on him instead of the play the entire time.
</p><p align="center">
    …..
</p><p>
    After the play Graves momentarily wondered if this was Grindelwald’s way of
    coming on to him; some bizarre courtship. But, as time passed, Gellert
    never spoke to him or treated him in a way that was inappropriate (at least
    not sexually). The dark wizard continued to take Graves on little
    excursions. Sometimes to restaurants, sometimes theaters. Sometimes just
    for walks. They moved, Graves noted. The hotel room would change, the air
    would have a different feel to it. But when he asked Grindelwald about
    this, Graves received evasive answers at best.
</p><p>
    Slowly, Percival began to relax. He knew that this couldn’t last forever;
    that whatever Grindelwald had planned for him couldn’t be good and that it
    would happen sooner or later. But Grindelwald never tortured him and was
    never cruel. The only times he hurt Graves was when an escape attempt
    nearly succeeded. Of course, even that wasn’t acceptable, as Graves was
    being held against his will and had every right to try to escape, but it
    was at least somewhat understandable. Instead, Gellert only talked to
    Graves. Occasionally he asked Percival about M.A.C.U.S.A and its employees,
    but if Graves refused to answer, he just laughed, and said Graves could
    keep his secrets but that Grindelwald would find out eventually. He
    continued to give Graves books and puzzles, allowing him little luxuries.
</p><p>
    Percival knew that it was just the psychological effects of having no one
    but Grindelwald to talk to for...who knew how long, but he was beginning to
    feel a kind of…not affection or even friendship, but…some type of bond for
    the man. He hated it, but he couldn’t do anything about it. The means of
    entertainment he had could only do so much. He wanted human company, and
    Grindelwald was his only source of that.
</p><p>
    Then came the night when Percival was sure he was going to die. It started
    out usual enough (or as usual as life as Grindelwald’s prisoner could be).
    Graves wasn’t surprised when Grindelwald told him they were going out
    again; this had happened several times. He was surprised when Grindelwald
    didn’t make the usual threats or transfigure himself or Graves. Graves
    wondered, at first, if this was a sign that Grindelwald had begun to trust
    him and if he could use it to his advantage, but then they’d arrived at
    their destination and Graves had realized the truth: the only safe place
    for him there, the Director of Magical Security without his wand and with
    the warded clothes, was by Grindelwald’s side.
</p><p>
    Even without knowing what country they were in, Graves was certain that the
    club’s owners and inhabitants could be put away on multiple charges. Men,
    women, and magical beings in various stages of undress danced on stages.
    The club’s customers lounged around, some tossing coins at the strippers.
    Others were drinking or taking substances that was illegal almost
    everywhere in the world. Still others looked like they were doing some type
    of business, and Graves didn’t want to find out what that business was. He
    could see at least three of M.A.C.U.S.A’s most wanted and several more
    wizards and witches who were tied to various crimes.
</p><p>
    Grindelwald lead him through the crowd to a round booth near the back.
    Graves stuck as close as possible to the other man, aware of the stares
    several of the patrons gave him. Most, he guessed, were because of his
    companion, but a few were levelled directly at him. Some full of hatred and
    others merely with a hunger that made him uncomfortable.
</p><p>
    “Why. Did. You. Bring. Me. Here?” Graves hissed, sliding into the seat
    across from Grindelwald.
</p><p>
    Gellert chuckled. “I thought you said you liked bars, Director.”
</p><p>
    “Bars! Bars! Not sex clubs!”
</p><p>
    “Hmm…it’s really more of a strip club, although if you’re in the mood I’m
    sure at least one-“ He held up a hand at Percival’s glare. “A joke! I have
    to meet someone about a certain object I’m interested in and I was curious
    to see how you’d react in this…environment. I never dreamed you’d be so
    repressed!”
</p><p>
    “I’m not repressed. This place is obscene! I want to go.”
</p><p>
    “Soon enough. Once I take care of, ah, here’s our host.”
</p><p>
    Gellert rose to greet two men. One was well over seven feet tall, with
    biceps the size of pumpkins. Clearly a body guard. Maybe even part giant or
    troll. The other looked like a short, skinny businessman. There’s a
    sinister air to him and Graves knew he didn’t want to cross this man. The
    bodyguard moved around Grindelwald to slide down te seat until he was
    seated next to Graves. Before Graves could move to the side, the smaller
    man took the seat to the other side of him. A small frown let Graves know
    that Grindelwald didn’t like that anymore than Graves did, but he sat down,
    the frown easing into a simply neutral expression.
</p><p>
    “It’s good to finally meet you, Mr. Grindelwald.” The short man said,
    glancing at Graves. “I was unaware you were bringing a friend.”
</p><p>
    “Mr. Graves just came along to have a good time, Mr. Deveraux.” Grindelwald
    flashed Graves a smirk, then turned back to Deveraux. “Thank you for
    meeting with me. I know you’re a busy man.”
</p><p>
    “Yes, well, we have similar interests. Run in the same circles. We could
    help one another.”
</p><p>
    “Exactly…do you have it?”
</p><p>
    “No.” Deveraux shook his head. “But I know where it can be found.”
</p><p>
    “And?”
    <br/>
    “And I’m willing to tell you. For a price, of course.”
    <br/>
    “5,000 galleons. 2,500 after you tell me where it is and 2,500 more after I
    get the stone.”
</p><p>
    Deveraux laughed. “Money!” He gestured at their surroundings. “I have
    plenty of money.”
</p><p>
    “Then what do you want?”
</p><p>
    Deveraux leaned in closer, lowering his voice. “I hear things. About you.
    About the other Hollows.”
</p><p>
    Grindelwald raised a brow, looking mildly amused. “Do you?”
</p><p>
    “People say you’ve been looking for them for most of your life. That you’ve
    found one. The most important one.”
</p><p>
    “People say a lot of things.”
</p><p>
    “I was wondering if I might see your wand, Mr. Grindelwald.”
</p><p>
    Graves narrowed his eyes. Did Deveraux want to disarm the other man? Surely
    he knew that Grindelwald wouldn’t be- But, to Graves surprise, Grindelwald
    simply nodded and drew out a wand… It was Graves’ own! Grinding his teeth,
    Percival tried to summon it to him. It trembled in Grindelwald’s hand, but
    the other wizard had a firm grip on it.
</p><p>
    “As you can see, it’s not-“
</p><p>
    “You’re other wand, Mr. Grindelwald.” Deveraux’s voice had an edge to it
    now. “That wand clearly belongs to your…friend, and it wants to get back to
    him.”
</p><p>
    Grindelwald’s lips twitched. “As you wish.” He drew out another wand, this
    one older and made from an odd wood that Graves had never seen before.
</p><p>
    Deveraux drew in a deep breath. “It’s true, then.” He whispered, and
    reached out a hand as if to take it from Grindelwald, but Gellert put it
    back in his pocket.
</p><p>
    “Yes; it’s true. And you can see why I’m eager to find the others. So…your
    price.”
</p><p>
    Deveraux straightened again, a look of wariness crossing his face. “Well,
    Mr. Grindelwald, as I’m sure you know, what you ask is no small tidbit of
    information. I can’t just trade it for a paltry sum of money. I’ll need
    something a bit more valuable than that.”
    <br/>
    “You know my reputation. I’m sure I have more than enough artifacts to
    satisfy your greed. What did you have in mind?”
</p><p>
    “The wand.”
</p><p>
    Graves turned to gape at Deveraux. He had no idea why the man wanted
    Grindelwald’s wand so badly, but he had to know Grindelwald wouldn’t trade
    it. A wand was like an extension of oneself. Graves doubted Grindelwald
    would give his up for anything Deveraux had to offer.
</p><p>
    Gellert didn’t look surprise, but he <em>did</em> look grim. “The most
    valuable Hallow for a different one? You know I won’t accept that.”
</p><p>
    “I had thought so, but I thought to give you a chance.”
</p><p>
    Suddenly, a hand yanked Graves head back painfully far, and Deveraux’s
    bodyguard pressed his wand to his throat. Graves instinctively tried to
    twist out of the grip, but the wand dug deeper.
</p><p>
    “You’re in my club and I have other guards waiting to interfere if you
    prove difficult to deal with. Roll the wand across to me, or my bodyguard
    will kill your companion. Then, my guards will kill <em>you</em>.”
</p><p>
    He was going to die, Graves thought. Because even if Grindelwald had kept
    him around for some reason, there was no way he was going to surrender his
    wand to save him, and there was nothing preventing Grindelwald from taking
    out Deveraux’s guards. Graves had seen what the man was capable of and had
    no doubt that <em>Grindelwald </em> would get out of this with barely a
    scratch. Graves on the other hand, knew he was going to die, and closed his
    eyes, trying to go to some place in is mind where this wasn’t happening.
</p><p>
    And then Gellert started to laugh. It had a hysterical quality to it, as if
    someone had just told the funniest joke in the world and the man had lost
    the ability to control himself. Graves cursed as sparks shot out of the
    wand, singeing his skin. Couldn’t the man at least muster up enough
    sympathy to make Graves’ last moments relatively quick? But, of course,
    Graves reminded himself, Grindelwald had no sympathy. Any kindness he’d
    shown Graves in the time he’d had the director prisoner was because he’d
    felt like it or benefited from it in some way, not because he cared about
    Percival.
</p><p>
    “Mr. Deveraux. <em>I </em>am the master of the Elder Wand. Surely you don’t
    think your little show of force will intimidate me?”
    <br/>
    “Perhaps you need a demonstration?” Deveraux said, his voice still
    confident. “Sergei, kill Mr. Graves.”
</p><p>
    Graves tensed…And then the wand lifted away from his throat and the hand
    wrapped in his hair released its grip.
</p><p>
    “Avada Kedavra.” The body guard spoke the words in a monotone, and then
    slumped to the table, eyes sightless.
</p><p>
    It took a second for Graves to process the change, and then he made a grab
    for the man’s wand. He was surprised when Grindelwald didn’t stop him, but
    then there were numerous curses directed at them from around the room. They
    were stopped by a shield, and then redirected at their casters, leaving at
    least twelve members of the crowd motionless on the floor. Deveraux leapt
    to his feet, but Grindelwald reached across the table to grip him by the
    collar. Graves took the moment to slip under the table and head towards the
    exit.
</p><p>
    “I was hoping I wouldn’t need to do this, Mr. Deveraux.” Grindelwald said,
    his tone soft, almost a whisper. “But I’m afraid you leave me no choice.
    Clearly you were misinformed about my temperament. Well, rest at ease
    knowing that, after tonight, your <em>patrons</em> will never make that
    mistake.”
</p><p>
    Percival stayed on his knees, crawling under tables until he was at least
    halfway across the room. Then he rose and pushed his way through the crowd,
    some of whom were staring at the spectacle, others who were trying to
    escape as well. He tried to disapparate, but found that the warded clothes
    prevented him. He hoped he could make it to some place he could change
    before Grindelwald noticed he was gone. Emerging from the club, he ran down
    the street, dodging around some people and shoving others aside. He ran
    until he felt like his sides were going to split, and then ducked into an
    alley way. Not allowing himself time to catch his breath, he started
    tearing at the fabric.
</p><p>
    “An excellent decision.” A familiar voice said in his ear, and Graves
    whirled around to find himself face to face with Grindelwald. “You could
    have gotten trampled to death if you’d stayed too much longer. I’m sure
    some people have.”
</p><p>
    Graves started to back away, but the other wizard grabbed his arm and
    disapparated. They were back in the hotel room. Graves started to cast a
    stunning spell, but the wand caught fire in his hand. Dropping it, Graves
    bit his lip in pain, holding his hand up to look at it.
</p><p>
    “I apologize, Director, but…well, you weren’t going to surrender it
    willingly.” Grindelwald raised his hand and Graves flinched, expecting
    punishment, but instead, Gellert took Graves’ hand gently in his own. He
    murmured something Graves didn’t understand and the pain in his hand eased,
    the burns healing. “Let me see your neck.” Not wanting to jeopardize his
    safety, Graves tilted his head back. A finger ran over where the sparks had
    burned him and Graves felt a tingle that let him know those were healed
    too. “That’s better. Nothing else?” Graves shook his head. “Good.”
    Grindelwald turned away and headed towards the kitchen.
</p><p>
    Graves let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “Deveraux?”
    He asked, following his captor.
</p><p>
    “He should be dead by now. I stabbed him in the stomach and cursed the
    wound so it couldn’t heal. It should be a slow, painful death.” Grindelwald
    rummaged through the cabinets, withdrawing different ingredients before
    waving a hand and setting them to cook on the stove. “I would have let you
    have a say, but you ran.” He gave Graves a pointed look.
</p><p>
    “Do you expect me to apologize?” Graves dropped into a chair at the table.
</p><p>
    “Of course not. But it did make things a bit more difficult…”
    <br/>
    “If you hadn’t brought me there none of that would have happened.” Percival
    couldn’t keep the growl out of his voice, fear fading and anger taking its
    place as his mind started to process the night’s events.
</p><p>
    “You’re angry.” Grindelwald sighed, and sat down across from Graves. “You
    have every right to be. More so than you even realize. But I promise you I
    never thought it would go quite so far. I mean, I expected some type of
    double-cross, but I didn’t think Deveraux would be quite so stupid to
    actually take you hostage or try to kill me.”
</p><p>
    “Oh, so you assumed that everyone was so afraid of you they’d just give you
    whatever you wanted without-“ Graves paused as Grindelwald waved a hand at
    the now simmering pot and dishes of pasta placed themselves in front of
    them. “without bothering to-“
</p><p>
    Gellert scowled. “Are you going to act like this all dinner?”
</p><p>
    “Why shouldn’t I? You’ve kept me prisoner for…”
</p><p>
    “Three weeks.” Grindelwald supplied helpfully.
</p><p>
    “Three weeks, and I almost died tonight because you wanted some stone.”
</p><p>
    “I wouldn’t have let them kill you. That would be like killing the goose
    that laid the golden eggs. Now, please-”
</p><p>
    “And that’s another thing!” Graves realized his voice was rising, but
    couldn’t bring himself to try to control it. “Why the hell am I here? You
    don’t ask me anything. You haven’t mentioned holding me for ransom. And you
    don’t torture me. All you do is keep me here and treat me like some kind of
    pet! I’m tired of-“
</p><p>
    “Okay!” Grindelwald interrupted him. “Enough! This night’s been nothing but
    a disappointment; he had no idea where the Resurrection Stone was, he just
    wanted the-“
</p><p>
    “I don’t care about your-“
</p><p>
    “I don’t need your attitude.”
</p><p>
    Graves’ eyes widened. “My attitude?!? You’re-“
</p><p>
    “If I tell you why I’m keeping you here will you shut up and sit down?”
</p><p>
    Graves wanted to say no and continue to list all his grievances, but this
    was the one question that Graves wanted answered the most. “I’ll consider
    it.”
</p><p>
    Gellert scoffed, but looked slightly uncomfortable. “You’re not going to
    like it.”
</p><p>
    “What would give you the impression that I liked any of this?”
    <br/>
    The other wizard shook his head and leaned back in his chair. “I was going
    to tell you soon, anyway. Once we got back to America.”
</p><p>
    “We’re going to America?”
    <br/>
    “Yes. New York, in fact.” Gellert paused. “In your absence it’s been beset
    by numerous attacks.”
</p><p>
    “You attacked-“
</p><p>
    “Not by me. The attacks match the description of those done by an
    obscurus.”
</p><p>
    “An obscurus? There hasn’t been an-“
</p><p>
    “Of course there have been. I had a friend whose sister was one. They’re
    rare but do develop occasionally.”
</p><p>
    This peaked Graves interest. “You have friends?”
</p><p>
    Grindelwald rolled his eyes. “Try to stay focused. An obscurus, if taught
    how to control its power, could be a strong ally. A game changer. But I
    can’t just go to New York and hope M.A.C.U.S.A stays out of my way while I
    search for the obscurus.”
</p><p>
    “So you plan on using me as a hostage to get them to cooperate? It’ll never
    work.”
    <br/>
    “No, I plan on becoming you.” Graves stared at his captor, unsure of
    exactly what he was saying. And then Grindelwald morphed and Graves was
    staring at a perfect replica of himself. Grindelwald had the nerve to
    laugh. “The look on your face…or, our face, I suppose. I’m going to take
    your place and use your rather considerable power and freedom to look for
    the obscurus.”
</p><p>
    “It’ll never work. They’ll know-“
</p><p>
    “It’s worked for the past three weeks.” Grindelwald interrupted. “Every
    day, I’ve been going to your job. As you. None of your colleagues have
    noticed the difference. I’ve had lots of opportunities to observe you in
    different situations, and what I don’t know I can find out.” There was a
    sympathetic look on his…no, Graves’ face. “I’m sorry but I-“ Graves flung
    his plate of pasta at the dark wizard. Grindelwald let the disguise drop
    and raised a hand. “Graves! I know you’re-“ Graves grabbed Grindelwald’s
    plate and threw that, too. “You’re overreacting-“ Percival dove towards the
    stove for the still hot pan, but he was thrown across the room, pinned to
    the wall. “I know you’re upset. I understand, but I can’t deal with this
    tonight. I’ve already had to-“
</p><p>
    “Oh, poor you!” Graves bit out. “You can’t get your precious stone! I-“
    Suddenly he was back in his room and Grindelwald was nowhere in sight. “The
    fuck!” Graves yelled, throwing everything he could at the wards. “You can’t
    just say that and lock me up again!” Nothing. “I know you can hear me you
    son of a bitch! I…oh…” A sudden wave of fatigue came over him, and Graves
    knew what was happening. “Coward…” Percival muttered, as he collapsed on
    the floor, vision going black.
