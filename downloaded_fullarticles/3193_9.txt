<p>Family Time</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco immediately went still. “Does this have to do with…my boss?” he asked, tone stiff. </p>
<p>Harry automatically placed a hand on the small of Draco’s back, which seemed to soothe him. </p>
<p>Narcissa blinked, her expression gentling. “No. This has to do with family.” </p>
<p>“Oh.” Draco frowned. “What about family?” </p>
<p>Inclining her head as if listening, Narcissa smiled. “I believe you’re about to get your answer.” </p>
<p>“Mother, we don’t have time for games,” Draco snapped. “If you’ll just tell us, so we can be on our way—” </p>
<p>“Hawwy! Dwaco!” </p>
<p>Both Harry and Draco turned to see Teddy running towards them. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Teddy?” Harry had seconds to brace himself before he was tackled. He lifted Teddy, groaning as he did so. “Merlin, you’re heavy.” </p>
<p>“I’ve gwown,” Teddy said solemnly. </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “Clearly.” He looked around. “Where’s—?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Harry, Draco.” Andromeda, looking serene, sailed in. “Cissy, I can’t seem to summon an elf.” </p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve yet to assign you one.” Narcissa clapped her hands and an elf appeared. “Boopsy, you’re now assigned to Mistress Andromeda. Obey all her commands as if they were mine.” </p>
<p>“Mother, what’s happening?” Draco asked. </p>
<p>Narcissa beamed. “Andy’s agreed to move in. We’re to be a real family again!” </p>
