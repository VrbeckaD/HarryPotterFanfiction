  <em>New York City, December, 1926</em>
</p><p>Gellert Grindelwald surveyed the busy streets of New York City with cool detachment. <em>Over-rated, </em>he thought to himself. New York was hardly worth the hype the American wizards ascribed to it. No, it was merely a means to an end, he told himself. The very thing he needed to bring about the next phase of his plan was here, now it was just a matter of persuasion, something he was very gifted at.</p><p> </p><p>He stepped back from the window, allowing the lace curtain to fall back into place. It wouldn’t do for his face to be recognised. Even hidden away in this non-magical neighbourhood it was dangerous. He must be cautious. If MACUSA caught the faintest whisper of his presence here, they would swarm like the misguided little ants they were. Yet, even ants served a purpose, he told himself.</p><p> </p><p>He stepped into the small bathroom adjoining his hotel room, lighting the room with a wave of the hornbeam wand he held. He almost hated the feel of it in his hand, strange to think that this wand had been so much a part of his developing years, the beginnings of his magic, the infantile years before his rise to power. But it felt wrong, disrespectful even to use the Elder Wand for anything but the grandest and most impressive displays of magic. That was the trick with power, knowing when to wield it. And knowing when a lesser tool would serve. Such was the case with the identity he assumed daily, the mask of Percival Graves, a lesser tool behind which he remained hidden, but not for long. Not if another of his lesser tools brought him fruitful information. The boy. Credence Barebone. He would serve his purpose too, he was sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>Satisfied that he had transfigured his appearance perfectly into that of Percival Graves, he left the hotel, slipping the Elder Wand into the inside pocket of his robes. He would never be foolish enough to leave the most powerful wand in existence, descended from myth and legend, the wand rumoured to have been crafted by Death Himself or Antioch Peverell more likely… how fanciful of the Peverell’s to put themselves on a level with the gods… His thoughts had wandered, he realised, but the point remained. One did not leave the Elder Wand lying about unguarded like that fool Mykew Gregorovitch.</p><p> </p><p>His thoughts turned to his current problem. These attacks on New York City… He knew what it meant. An Obscurial. A powerful one. One he intended to bring into his Alliance. If that power could be channelled and directed, then blood pact be damned, he would finally have a way to remove Albus from the board. He almost hated to do it to his old friend, but that one glorious summer together had been so long ago…too much had changed and the fact remained. They weren’t 17 anymore. Albus was a threat to the New World Order, and threats had to be eliminated…for the Greater Good.</p><p> </p><p>So  focused was he in his mind on the potential power and opportunity this Obscurial presented, that for all his rare gifts and abilities, Grindelwald failed to perceive the moment a greater threat than Dumbledore and a greater power than Grindelwald himself possessed, came into being.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>December 31, 1926</em>
</p><p>An ocean away, on the continent of Grindelwald’s greatest rival, in a shabby Muggle neighbourhood, away from the prying eyes of the magical world, a greater threat than Grindelwald could have imagined and the most powerful Dark Wizard to exist, took his first breath as Merope Gaunt-Riddle’s life force was extinguished. Tom Marvolo Riddle had arrived, his destiny soon to be entwined with that of Gellert Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore and a child not yet born. A Boy who would Live. The age of the Darkest of Wizards had begun…</p>
