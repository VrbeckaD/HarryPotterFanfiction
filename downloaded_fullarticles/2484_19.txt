She was intrigued by him, him with his too thin frame and round glasses. So she would sit backwards on the couch and watch the strange boy every day though the curtains in the window. Today he was planting fresh tulips in the flower bed shirt soaked with perspiration and dirt. Today she was going to do it. She would go out there and talk to him.

Though with how much she had watched him she knew it was because no one had. "I'm Nala, Nala Rosenburrow" she smiled brightly at him glad he wasn't turning her away. The boy, Harry now watched her warily glancing between her and the door to his house as if about to make a mad dash for the door. she shoved the water bottle in his direction watching as he flinched but then stared at the water bottle when it didn't hit him in the face. "I brought this for you i thought you might need it." she spoke quickly smiling when he wrapped his hands around the bottle. His brows crinkled in confusion as he stood from his position in front of the flower bed. [Plot bunny ends here]</p></div>
