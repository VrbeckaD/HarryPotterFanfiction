    <b>Prologue</b>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>I'm safe. I'm safe. It worked. I got out.</em>
  </em>
</p><p>Looking around at the forest surrounding her, she released the breath she'd been holding Hermione was indescribably relieved she had at least managed to remain in her same location which, given her calculations were correct, ought to be a lesser wood not 5 kilometers from Hogsmeade.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>My wand! </em>
  </em>
</p><p>She dropped to her knees in a desperation, frantically searching for the gnarled piece of walnut that had only recently relented itself unto her. She paused her hand over the top of the wand and swallowed hard as she collected it firmly into her grasp. Ron had thought her morbid for her continued use of Bellatrix Lestrange's old wand, but to Hermione, it felt as if she was finally reattaining some semblance of control by mastering the conduit of her torture.</p><p>Drawing herself unsteadily to her feet she shakily took inventory of her current condition.</p><p>Mild concussion, bruising along and around her neck, a spattering of abrasions across most of her body, twisted ankle, shoulder bi-</p><p>Her clinical analysis was abruptly interrupted by her inability to cope with her next thought. Panic was now beginning to burrow itself into her, shortening her breaths into gasps and threatening to cloud her already addled brain.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>Blood. There was so much blood. </em>
  </em>
</p><p>She cast a gentle tergeo over her shoulder wound, knowing anything beyond that was as useless as it was unrealistic given her state. She needed to be treated quickly, and beyond that, she needed to remain unseen.</p><p>Using the lingering fumes of her already drained magical capacity, Hermione closed her eyes and disapparated, appearing in front of the Shrieking Shack. She barely managed to stifle her wail as the pain of a moderate splinch tore into her wand arm, causing the piece to tumble out of her hand and onto the grass below her. No, that had by no means been a brilliant decision, but it was born out of necessity and she would therefore survive the consequences. Madame Pomfrey was her only option. Apparating further would only result in leaving of her behind, and no one respected one's wishes for nondisclosure more than Hogwarts' matron healer.</p><p>Hermione needed to get through that tunnel.</p><p>Clumping toward the shack's entrance, she absently scratched at her skin, leaving behind a track of minor lacerations. It was crawling, her skin was crawling. It felt too tight and too strained, as if it no longer fit her body. She caught her breath as her vision was blinded in hot white, and her hearing overwhelmed her in a cacophony of sound.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>No, no, no. This cannot be happening. I'm not ready for this!... I have to get to the shack. </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Through her spotting eyesight, she viewed a figure running toward her. The boy looked to be her age; he was shorter than the average young man and quite rotund in stature. Dull, mousy hair mopped the top of his head, and his eyes... well, all Hermione saw of his eyes was the terror they beheld. The boy was wildly waving his hands as he yelled at her, but his voice was drowned in the devastating noise that rang in and deafened her ears.</p><p>"You have to lock me up!" She yelled at him, drawing on every ounce of strength given from her adrenalin rush to throw herself toward the door of the shrieking shack.</p><p>"Don't you understand? You need to lock me up NOW!"</p><p>The boy was flinging himself in front of the door, barricading her out. Pathetic tears, the sort associated with stubbing toes and dicing onions, were streaking and striping her dirt-caked face as she continued screaming at him to ward her in, only to be met by his head violently shaking in refusal.</p><p>Her wails filled the air as her pain intensified.</p><p>"It's too late!" She sobbed to the boy, not knowing if he could hear her.</p><p>"You need to run! Go!" The boy wasn't moving. Why wasn’t he moving? He just stood there, torn between keeping her out of the building and giving into his petrified shock.</p><p>"RUN!"</p><p>Anguish ripped through her frail and battered body with a gruesome crack of her spinal column as Hermione's consciousness bled from her mind and body.</p><p>

</p><p>A pitiful whimpering awoke her from her slumber. Eyes tightly shut, Hermione listened carefully for the source until a chocked sob broke the chain of pained whining, enlightening to her the realization that it had been her own crying.</p><p>Feebly, she opened her eyes. She was laying in some sort of meadow in a mess of dirt, blood, and morning dew, and was entirely naked save for a small blanket which managed to barely cover her modesty. Trembling, she attempted to push herself to sit before collapsing back down in a woeful heap on the forest floor.</p><p>Her endeavors startled the animal she hadn't noticed dozing at the edge of the clearing. The creature jumped to its feet with a territorial snarl before pacing and stalking back and forth, hackles raised, haunches lunge-ready, and eyes ceaselessly tracking her every movement, down the labored rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>"Padfoot?"</p><p> </p>
