    <em>July 15<sup>th</sup></em>
  </strong>
</p><p>In a cottage close to the Dorset coast, three of the four members of the Scamander family were eating breakfast quietly.  There was an air of solemnity over the table. Newt, the father, was quiet as he poured out some more orange juice.  Phoebe, the eleven-year-old daughter, listlessly stirred her porridge around in her bowl.  Philip, the five-year-old son, sniffled and wiped one eye.</p><p>Noticing this, Newt reached to his left and stroked his son’s dark head.  “There, there, son,” he said softly. “If you want to cry, go ahead.  It’s always sad when this happens, and I wish that it didn’t, but that’s the way that nature is sometimes.”</p><p>Phoebe nodded, having learned this lesson a few years ago.  She then tried to smile at her little brother.  “If you want, Phil, we can go down to the beach after breakfast and jump the waves.”</p><p>Philip looked at his sister and managed a smile while he nodded.</p><p>Newt smiled at his daughter.  He knew that jumping the waves was a game that Philip preferred. He reached under the table and squeezed her hand proudly.  Phoebe gave him a grateful smile before finally eating her porridge.</p><p>A few moments later, the kitchen door opened and the missing member of the family made the scene complete: the mother, Porpentina. </p><p>“Mummy!” cried both of her children, who got up from the table and ran to her.  She hugged them both to her, laughing softly with pleasure at this spontaneous display of love.</p><p>“Well, hello!” she exclaimed, looking over at her husband, who was smiling at the sight of her.</p><p>“Welcome home, love,” he said, standing up and giving her a soft kiss.</p><p>She returned it, but by now she had sensed something of the melancholy atmosphere.  “Has something happened?”</p><p>Newt sighed as they all returned to the table. “Well, Lotus had her babies this morning.  Five are healthy, but one only lived a few minutes.”</p><p>Tina sighed.  Lotus was one of the mooncalves, and she knew how much the children had been looking forward to the birth of her babies (Newt would always let them have first choice of names).  She stroked her husband’s and her children’s heads before sitting down to the table. “Was it a boy or a girl?”</p><p>“A boy,” sniffled Philip. “I named him Fred.”</p><p>Tina smiled softly at him as she stroked his cheek. “That’s a fine name, Phil.”  She turned to Phoebe and Newt.  “But the other babies are healthy?  Please tell me all about them.”</p><p>This caused the atmosphere to lighten considerably as they eagerly told their mother about the new babies: Sarah, Wilfred, Helen, David, and Louise.  Newt happily let his children do most of the talking; it never ceased to warm his heart to see them enthuse about magical creatures.</p><p>The happy descriptions were interrupted by a tapping at the kitchen window above the sink.  All turned to see their family owl, Gideon, waiting to be let in.</p><p>Phoebe leapt up from her chair and hurried to open the window.  She loved having the task of getting the morning mail.  Gideon happily flew inside and landed on the back of Phoebe’s empty chair, holding out his right leg obediently.  While Philip happily gave Gideon a piece of his bacon to eat, Phoebe untied that morning’s edition of <em>The Daily Prophet</em>and handed it to her mother.  She then removed the curled-up letters, and Gideon relaxed his leg as he happily devoured the bacon slice.</p><p>Newt ate his eggs and patiently waited for Phoebe to hand over the letters to him.  She still hadn’t done so by the time she had finished them.  So, he looked up at his daughter, still standing by her chair and holding the mail.  Specifically, she was holding two letters, one in each hand, looking from one to the other with wide eyes. </p><p>Because she was looking at the back of them rather than the front, Newt could discern that they were both addressed to Phoebe.  Newt felt his spine straighten as he realized just what one of those letters would be.  He didn’t dare speak a word.</p><p>Finally, Phoebe looked up and cleared her throat purposefully.  Tina lowered the paper and Philip looked away from Gideon (who flew out the window to his shed a moment later).  When she had the full family’s attention, she said softly, “I have a letter…from Hogwarts.”</p><p>Tina gave a delighted gasp, Philip clapped his hands in excitement, and Newt just grinned like the proud papa that he was.  He knew that the letter had to come any day now, but that didn’t make this any less thrilling.</p><p>But Phoebe was not finished yet.  “And I have a letter…from Ilvermorny, too.”</p><p>The grin froze on Newt’s face while Tina gave another gasp.  Philip was now bouncing up and down in his chair.  “Oooo!  Both Mummy’s school <em>and </em>Papa’s school!  Open them, Phee, open them!”</p><p>Phoebe let out a little nervous laugh as she sat back down in her chair.  Her parents and even Philip remained quiet while she opened and read each letter quietly. </p><p>Her face remained calm, neutral, giving nothing away. But her eyes, her dark eyes inherited from her mother, were bright and filled with fire as she read each written word. In moments like these, Newt thought that she looked so much like her mother.  Most of the time, it was him that she resembled physically because she had inherited his tawny crop of hair (which she usually kept plaited in one or two tails) and his freckled skin (which he could only apologize for).  But her eyes and her expression were pure Tina.</p><p>Finally, she looked up and look at each one of them before a smile bloomed on her face.  “I’ve been accepted to both!”</p><p>Tina covered her mouth with both hands, hiding the huge smile that spread across her face for a moment.  Then, she let it show as she let out a delighted exclamation of joy. Newt smiled too, but he remained silent. Philip hopped off his chair and hugged his sister, who returned the hug with a breathless laugh.</p><p>“Does this mean you get to go to both?  And that so will I?”</p><p>The five-year-old’s innocent questions caused an immediate tension to fill the kitchen.  Phoebe’s body stiffened as her eyes became bright; Tina’s expression went from delighted to somber; Newt’s smile faded while his expression remained unreadable.</p><p>It was Tina who broke the silence.  As she answered her son’s questions, she looked sympathetically but meaningfully at her daughter.</p><p>“No, Phil.  Phoebe will have to choose between the two of them.  Do they give a deadline?”</p><p>Phoebe nodded.  “Both give the end of the month, the 31<sup>st</sup>.”</p><p>Tina nodded as she stood up from the table.  She walked to Phoebe and cupped her cheek; her gaze remained strong but comforting.  “Then you have some thinking to do.  Your father and I are right here for you if you need to talk about it, but this is completely your decision, peanut.  Okay?”</p><p>Phoebe held her mother’s gaze for a long minute before nodding.  Tina smiled and kissed Phoebe’s forehead before straightening and yawning. </p><p>“Well, after that all-nighter, I am going to take a nap. What plans have you three made?”</p><p>“We’re going to the beach!” said Philip with excitement.</p><p>Tina laughed and ruffled his hair.  “On a morning like this, that is a <em>great </em>idea!  If you three are still there when I wake up, I’ll join you.”</p><p>Both of her children kissed her before heading out of the kitchen to change into their swimsuits.  Newt also got up to follow them, but Tina touched his arm as he passed her, causing him to stop.</p><p>“Are you alright?” she asked his profile.</p><p>He managed the briefest of glances and the briefest of smiles before saying quickly, “Of course, love, have a good rest,” and pecking her cheek before leaving the room.</p><p>Tina stood there with a worried frown on her face for a few moments before heading upstairs.</p>
