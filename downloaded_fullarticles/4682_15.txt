    <p>She wasn't a pureblood. She wasn't even a half-blood. She was Muggle-Born, a mudblood. But, she was <em>his</em> mudblood.</p>
<p>At first, no one understood. She was just a scrawny little first year Gryffindor that was talked about in the small circle of followers trying to resurrect Voldemort. It was Halloween night when Quirrell had apparated in, holding her hand. She was introduced to a Peter "Wormtail" Pettigrew, Thoros Nott, and Antonin Dolohov that night. They all had to be lectured on why she would be accepted, as they initially thought she was there to practice curses on like they would do sometimes. They would find a younger kid, they healed easier, and when they were done a wiped memory fixed all the problems.</p>
<p>Before the face of Voldemort was even uncovered, she had started to tell off the three men.</p>
<p>"When Professor Quirrell invited me here he did <em>not</em> intend for me to be hurt. You will <em>not</em> disrespect me."</p>
<p>The three men were laughing at their <em>target </em>until the heard the voice of their Lord.</p>
<p>"She is right. She was invited here to meet all of you, <em>as my guest</em>."</p>
<p>Thoros sucked in a breath. For anyone outside of the four of them to even be <em>aware</em> that their Lord was still alive was a huge deal. The rest of the ranks had mourned and moved on trying to salvage their names, but the few of them standing there tonight felt as if he didn't die. They took almost five years to find what was left of the Dark Lord. It had been five more years of various efforts to bring him back to a human form. And this little ball of fluff had actually <em>talked</em> with him and was comfortable enough in his presence to <em>lecture</em> his followers.</p>
<p>"Of course my Lord."</p>
<p>"Now, you will listen to me. This is Hermione Granger, she will be taught all of our ways. I want her to be able to float through the wizarding world with no issues. I want her to be able to keep up with any of my followers, as an equal. When we found her tonight, she had been attacked by a troll. She was in the corner of a bathroom with one of the strongest shields I have seen in years, and she was <em>unconscious</em>."</p>
<p>Antonin raised an eyebrow to that, it took a great deal of magic to have a spell hold after you were knocked out. You had to really be in touch with your magical side, and for that to happen so young was a sign of a powerful witch.</p>
<p>"To make this work I need Snape and Malfoy here."</p>
<p>Thoros and Quirinus disapparated at that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Miss Granger, can we get something for you?"</p>
<p>"Um, do you have anything for a headache? Professor healed my cuts but my head is still rather painful."</p>
<p>"Sure little one. I'll be right back." Antonin was gone for a couple minutes and returned with a small vial of pain relieving potion.</p>
<hr/>
<p>About half an hour later, Thoros had returned with Lucius and Abraxas Malfoy, they both greeted Hermione with a gentle kiss to the knuckles.</p>
<p>Thoros leaned down after seeing her puzzled face, saying "It is customary for a man to greet a woman of similar standing this way. And as our Lord has declared, you will be treated as such."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"You'll get used to it. We'll get you a tutor soon so these things don't surprise you."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"This is Lord Malfoy and his son Lucius Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Pleased to meet you." She said with a small curtsey like her Grandma taught her.</p>
<p>Abraxas chuckled at the motion "It looks like someone at least taught you some manners."</p>
<p>She blushed and nodded, but before she could answer, Quirinus had returned with Severus. He narrowed his eyes when he spotted her, turning back to Quirinus. "Exactly <em>what</em> is this insufferable know it all doing here?"</p>
<p>"She is here by our Lord's request."</p>
<p>"Our Lord died ten years ago tonight."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't Severus."</p>
<p>He spun around to see the half form of Voldemort, hovering in the air and dropped, joining Lucius and Abraxas in kneeling. "My Lord," all three spoke together.</p>
<p>Abraxas turned to Thoros "Old friend, you should have told me he would be here."</p>
<p>Thoros shrugged and smirked.</p>
<p>"What do you need from us my Lord?" Lucius asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I will need the head of the school board to support a re-sorting. And when that goes through, Severus you will be watching over the newest little snake. I expect your sons to treat her with respect and help her adjust to the new house. Severus, I also need your help with ensuring she is sorted properly. A little ritual."</p>
<p>Severus nodded and drew his wand. "Miss Granger I need your hand."</p>
<p>She briefly hesitated and Thoros nudged her forward, smiling down when she looked back at him. "Go on, he won't harm you."</p>
<p>"Thoros, I need to draw blood, I <em>have to</em> harm her."</p>
<p>She drew back against Thoros and curled into herself.</p>
<p>"Severus, how are you a teacher if <em>this</em> is how you talk to children?"</p>
<p>Severus shrugged and held his hand out "Miss Granger it will be a small slice on your palm, and we will heal it after."</p>
<p>"O-Okay." She rolled her shoulders back, brushed her skirt down and lifted her chin up before laying her hand palm up on her dour professor's hand.</p>
<p>Antonin snorted. "I think the hat got it right the first time."</p>
<p>"Yes, well, she will be better protected in Slytherin. Obviously, since the Lions left her to die. No one came to check on the missing first year."</p>
<p>"When I left, they had yet to notice any student's absence."</p>
<p>Hermione started to tear up at that. No one noticed she was gone. She hadn't talked to any students since Ron had insulted her shortly after lunch. It had to be almost nine at night now.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger, this will hurt a bit. <em>diffindo</em>."</p>
<p>She gasped when the spell hit her hand. She was watching the blood pool in her palm when another hand covered hers. She saw his blood dripping onto her palm and heard Professor Snape singing in latin as he wove a string of light around their hands.</p>
<p>When he joined the start of the strand of light with the end, the blood between their hands floated in a ball before separating, a small bit back up to his hand and the majority falling into hers, slowly seeping back into the cut as the chanting continued. When all the blood had disappeared, the light tightened on their hands and disappeared into their skin.</p>
<p>Severus healed both of their cuts and nodded to him.</p>
<p><em>"Hello little one" </em>he rasped out in parseltongue.</p>
<p>She turned and smiled at him and responded<em>: "Hello sir, what shall I call you now?"</em></p>
<p>
  <em>"I suppose Father."</em>
</p>
<p>And so, she became his mudblood, his daughter.</p>
