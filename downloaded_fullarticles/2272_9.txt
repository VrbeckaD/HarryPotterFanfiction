    <p class="p1"><em>It’s honestly just not fair, </em>Draco thought as he watched Potter running around the Quidditch pitch in grey joggers and a sinfully tight Gryffindor red t-shirt. He was <em>certain </em>McGonagall had chosen the outfits to send Draco into a fit. It had absolutely nothing to do with trying to keep people warm during the chilly Autumn mornings in the Scottish highlands, it was purely as torture device against the former Death Eater who had discovered his obsession with one Harry Potter in joggers.</p>
<p class="p1">The fact that Draco himself had been forbidden from participating in any activity that could lead to inciting violence, including Quidditch, had only worsened the unfairness of it all. Not that Draco was about to argue this point to his parole Auror. He was fairly certain the man thought he was undeserving of <em>any </em>freedom whatsoever, and he would not find any sympathy from him.</p>
<p class="p1">He knew he shouldn’t be there. Ogling Harry day after day would only end poorly for him. There could never be anything between them, he was a former Death Eater after all and Harry was… Harry. Savior of the Wizarding World, champion of all that was good and right and just.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry smiled up at Draco in the stands as he ran past, and it was all Draco could do not to melt. That was another part of the unfairness of Draco’s post-war life, the easy smiles with which Harry Potter liked to grace him. As if the last seven years of their life hadn’t happened. As if the war hadn’t happened. As if perhaps they were friends. Draco shook his head. He would never dare allow himself the impossible hope that such a thing could be possible. Yet somehow, in Harry’s easy smiles in his direction, he could almost feel the warmth of the sun’s rays that emanated from Harry on his skin. How he longed to stand in that light.</p>
<p class="p1">He tried to tell himself that he would stop coming to these practices, that he was <em>not </em>strictly watching for Harry, then Harry would lift his shirt in an effort to wipe the sweat from his brow revealing toned, golden brown abs covered in thick, black hair that traveled from his mid stomach and disappeared into those grey joggers. It was all he could do not to moan. The thought of what lay beneath made him salivate. He could just make out an outline of Harry’s cock through the joggers as he ran.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco shot up from his spot on the stands and snuck his way back up toward the castle. He had become rather good at disappearing as of late. It was easy when no one was really looking for you. No one except Potter of course. He tried to remind himself that he was and always would be Potter to him. He had always been far too kind for his own good and the fact that his kindness might extend to Draco made him feel weak at the knees. He wished he still had the strength to tell the chosen one to <em>bugger off, </em>if only for his own mental well being. Being friends with the object of his affection, one for whom any number of witches and wizards would gladly kill for the opportunity to bed, Draco knew he didn’t stand a chance. Why would he chose a Death Eater when he could have anyone else?</p>
<p class="p1"><em>He defended you though, </em>his mind sometimes liked to remind him. Draco scoffed. It was Potter being Potter, a do-gooder to the very end. It wasn’t romantic. It wasn’t even friendly, it was simply Harry Potter, the eternal Gryffindor, doing what he believed to be the right thing. Which was why he had given Draco back his wand.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry had looked so forlornly at it that Draco had considered telling him to keep it. The wand would never obey him properly again anyway, but it was the principle of the thing. Harry had already taken everything else from him. His mother had moved to France, his father had been killed in a Ministry raid, his own freedom was virtually nonexistent, he couldn’t have his wand too.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes Draco thought about Harry holding his wand. The intimacy of such a thing, what spells had Harry used on it, beyond the one used to destroy the Dark Lord. He would often lay awake at night imagining these things. There was a certain power attached to it, a power Draco knew, was not entirely his own. It was Harry’s magic, he decided, still thrumming through the wand. Begging for its <em>true </em>master. Draco snorted. <em>Join the club you stupid hunk of tree scraps, </em>he thought bitterly, closing his bed curtains.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>It was going to be a very long weekend</em>, he thought. He had promised himself that he wouldn’t watch Harry practice again. He didn’t want to make a habit of staring, but Harry insisted on wearing those bloody joggers everywhere he went and it drove Draco absolutely mad.</p>
<p class="p1">It was, the following Monday, when Harry had shown up late to their potions class, dripping with sweat and still wearing those bloody joggers that Draco had officially snapped. His mind short circuited the moment Harry sat down beside him. There was something so primal about how he smelled then, and the sight of his sweaty body made Draco ache with desire. <em>Bloody hold it together, </em>he hissed at himself, seconds after knocking over half the ingredients for their potion. Harry smiled, offering to help him cut up the lacewing flies Draco blushed crimson and failed to come up with a single reason why Harry shouldn’t do it. His mind blanked, and all Draco could think was how badly he wanted to lick the bead of sweat that was currently trailing down Harry’s collarbone. He knew he was staring, but he was powerless to stop himself.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are you alright?” Harry asked in that genuinely concerned way. Draco giggled, the sound grating at his ears and instantly making him feel like an idiot. Before Harry could say a word, Draco leapt up from his chair and bolted out of the classroom as fast as he could, leaving a very confused Harry in his wake.</p>
<p class="p1">“Draco,” he heard Harry yell after him. He wanted to yell back,<em> go away. Leave me alone.</em> <em>Please. </em>But he couldn’t, so instead Draco turned down the next corridor and threw himself into an alcove, and curled up into a ball in the far corner, away from the notice of the other students. <em>Stupid idiot! </em>Draco chastised himself. <em>Stupid, stupid, STUPID! </em>“Draco?” Draco looked up to find Harry standing at the entrance to the alcove looking down at him. He frowned. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="p1">Draco merely stared at him for a long moment and willed himself not to cry. <em>You will not show weakness in front of Harry Potter of all people</em>, he told himself, his eyes already burning with unshed tears. Draco closed his eyes and nodded his head. Harry sighed, and stepped into the alcove, and dropped down beside him. Whatever Draco had expected, being wrapped up in Harry’s arms and pulled into his chest was not it. Draco gasped, and opened his eyes. It was real. Harry Potter was hugging him.</p>
<p class="p1">“I… what was that for?” Draco asked when Harry finally pulled away a few moments later.</p>
<p class="p1">“You seemed like you needed it,” Harry replied with a shrug.</p>
<p class="p1">“I… you don’t owe me anything,” Draco said.</p>
<p class="p1">“I know that.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Especially not your pity.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t pity you,” Harry said.</p>
<p class="p1">“You hugged me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Because you need a friend,” Harry said. Draco looked at him.</p>
<p class="p1">“I have Blaise and Pan…” but his words were cut off suddenly as Harry leaned across the small space between them, and pressed his lips to Draco’s. Draco gasped.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry,” Harry said quickly pulling away. “I shouldn’t have…” Draco crawled into his lap to kiss him again.</p>
<p class="p1">“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted that,” Draco said. Harry grinned, and deepened the kiss.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="p1">Draco nodded. “I’ve been watching you running in those bloody joggers, driving me mad,” he said, sitting in Harry’s lap.</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh? Why’s that?” Harry asked, playing innocent, and bucking his hips into Draco’s arse. Draco whined.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mmm, you b-bloody k-know why,” Draco stammered.</p>
<p class="p1">Harry chuckled, “Cause you caught a glimpse of my cock and now you really want it in your arse don’t you?” Harry whispered in his ear. Draco whimpered and nodded. Harry grinned, nibbling on his ear. “Good. But you’re going to have to be patient, because I have been thinking about nothing else but devouring that pretty little arse of yours for weeks now,” Harry said. Draco shuddered. “How about we take this back to my room and I can fuck your brains out, hmm?” Draco nodded, eagerly; Harry smiled and kissed him once more, sucking on his throat, eager to leave his mark. Draco whined.</p>
<p class="p1">“Please,” he begged.</p>
