    <p>It all started on the 30th of October 1994, this day was the more or less the official start of the newest edition of the famous Triwizard Tournament (a famous but blooded tournament between three of the most famous European wizarding schools: Hogwarts , Beauxbatons and Durmstrang) and was resurrected by the British Minister of Magic in conjunction with Hogwarts. The price for winning this tournament is eternal glory and a certain amount of money, but mostly the glory.</p><p><em>Late… I just arrived at Hogwarts and I'm already late… </em>A young girl with ruby colored hair was running across her chamber, clothes flying on her path. <em>Merde… Where is is my blazer… HERE!</em></p><p>-"Okay. So I got my blazer, I got my wand, got my shirt, my beanie…" rambled the girl."Pant… PANTS! Where are them!?"</p><p>She kept running across the small room, a rather impressive fact if we take account that she manage to not fall with all the clothes on the floor and not hit anything…</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Ten minute later</strong> </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>The girl ran across the main courtyard, now facing two huge wooden doors with many symbols carved on it, pressing her hands on each and opening them slowly. She visibly disturbed the meal, the whole population of the Great Hall of Hogwarts looking at her, students and teachers. The girl was wearing a blue blazer with Beauxbatons emblem on a pouch on top of her right side, a sport shirt, black silk pants but most surprising: a zweihänder within a black leather scabbard strapped on her back, she also had a black beanie covering the top of her head along with her ears.</p><p>-"Hello dear students and staff from Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons." began the girl, doing a quick bow. "Katelyn Elianor Brynhildr Malfoy at your service… Or rather at my service, sorry for the false hope. And my lateness, but you already remarked that. Anyway everyone, have a nice meal or drink or whatever the fuck you're having right now." concluded Katelyn, walking toward a specific blonde girl she spotted before. Before she could seat or say anything the blonde interuppted her:"<em>Serieusement Kate? Tu arrive trente minutes en retard tout ça pour ton entrée théatrale</em>?"</p><p>-"Well you know me dear Fleur, I love my lil' moment of fame and I can't bear the planned choreography… That and the fact that I hadn't prepared my outfit and I wasn't sure if I wanted to show my sweeeeeeet blade or not." answered Katelyn while seating, grabbing some food, not relay caring about choosing. "Oh and remember you need to try to speak English, we're in Britain after all, need to show that we're well educated and all this bullshit... And stop feeling bad about your french accent, I told you it's lovely." Katelyn finished, quickly pressing her lips on Fleur right cheek.</p><p>While Katelyn didn't cared, the rest of the student and part of Hogwarts staff were shocked, most people knew that Malfoy house is originally from France but they thought all the house moved to Britain long long ago. So imagine their shock when some young girl who look nothing like Lucius or Draco Malfoy arrived and proclaimed she was part of the House. From her face details, to her eyes and hair color… Nobody ever eared about fiery redhead and emerald eyes in this House. And this sword? Just from the look of it was surely an ancient artifact, probably goblin crafted with engraved runes and mysterious magical property… This girl even managed to shock the knowing-all Albus Dumbledore, he was both Hogwarts Headmaster, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Grand Sorcerer and he never eared about this girl…</p><p>On the other side of the hall, a blond boy was shocked, shocked to learn that he had family in France and shocked by her look. He will need to send an owl to his father about that. It might be a problem if what she proclaimed was truth and was after Malfoy house and political power…</p>
<hr/><p>"Hum... are you sure that you're from the same family as Draco Malfoy? Your aura is nothing like his and I'm not even talking about your appearance or your ears..." suddenly said a young blond girl with a strange look on her face, sitting few seat across the Ravenclaw table.</p><p>"My ears? Which ones?" said Katelyn by taking of her beanie showing the girl for an instant a pair of black cat ears who suddenly disappeared while her hair became blond. "Do I look more like the Malfoy here now?"Then her hair turned black. "And now do I look like a girl from the house Black?" she then set back her beanie while her features returned to normal. "I'm as Malfoy as you can be since my ancestors didn't ran out with their tail between their legs like coward since their big brother didn't agreed with them. finished the girl while biting in a chicken wing, hiding a low moan because the food tasted so good. Not caring about the disturbed looks that most Hogwarts and Durmstrang student were sending her, having displayed carelessly her metamorphomagus abilities. "That's the story of your dear Lucius and Draco ancestors by the way, cowards who ran away." Said another time a little bit louder while looking at the Slytherin table. "But I'm sure the descendant aren't the same."</p><p>"Well that explain why wrackspurt don't even try to bother you…" mumbled the girl while an older ravenclaw student loudly said to don't listen to '<em>Loony Lovegood</em>' oddness.</p><p>Katelyn's ears twitched when she eared the student, making her beanie move a little bit but she decided to not bother herself, it must be an inside joke or something like that. She closed her mind and stayed focused on her plan…</p><p>She was disturbed when Fleur little sister, Gabrielle, poked her in the arm and said quietly "Kate! The old man's talking 'bout the <em><strong>tournoi</strong></em> listen!". Dumbledore just said well known fact about the tournament, usual warnings and a new one about 'having to be of age for entering the tournament' but nothing new to Katelyn, she was already warned by her father contact in the British Ministry.</p><p>"Well, nothing new, I already knew that but thanks you very much Gabrielle. Tomorrow will surely be funny..." said the girl with a big smile while Dumbledore uncovered the Goblet of Fire.</p><p><em>While most minds where asleep, a shadow came to the Great hall, dropping an old piece of parchment in the goblet, smirking and saying softly </em> <strong>"And so, it began"</strong></p>
