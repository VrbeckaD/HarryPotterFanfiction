    <p>Draco's phone buzzed in his pocket, with a frown he checked his messages. The message was from his father, it was brief, as always: Draco, I received an email that you weren't in your fifth hour class for the first ten minutes. Where were you?<br/>Draco internally groaned, he was twelve miles from the man and he still was managing to bother him. <br/>Draco responded with a message more brief than his father's: I was in the nurses office.<br/>His fathers reply was instant: You have proof?<br/>Draco shook his head before sending his father a picture of the nurses pass. After ten minutes Draco knew his father had been satisfied. Draco sat down on his bunk and glanced at his roommate. His roommate looked over and made direct eye contact, Draco quickly averted his gaze. Tom Riddle, his roommate, was known to be a loner, there were also rumors that he killed his parents. They were just rumors of course, but that didn't change the fact that he was scary.<br/>"You've heard the rumors then?" <br/>Draco looked up with horrified eyes, "S-sorry?" <br/>Tom stood up and walked over to Draco, "Do you believe them? The rumors about me?" Draco shook his head no, he was too scared to say anything. Tom loomed over Draco before abruptly poking him on the nose. "Poke." He said smiling.<br/>Draco watched with a smile as Tom turned and sat down. "We've been roomies for what two months now? We've never even spoken."<br/>Draco laughed nervously, "Uh Sorry about that- I-I'm kind of-"<br/>"Shy." Tom finished, "I've noticed." Tom got really quiet. After a few minutes he finally said, "So you're here because of academics right? I'm an art prodigy myself." He said nodding.<br/>Draco's eyes lit up, he loved art, but he'd be the first to admit he was terrible at it. "Can I see some of your work?"<br/>Tom looked as if he were in deep thought, after a few minutes he shrugged, "I suppose." He handed Draco a black book. Draco opened it up and began flipping through the pages. <br/>"Oh, they're beautiful." Draco said. The one he was looking at was a drawing of a bouquet. Flowers were bloomed in every direction, and the detail was incredible. Draco smiled and looked up at Tom. Tom was typing away at his phone. Draco smiled to himself, had he really just befriended the loner? Draco continued to turn pages until one picture in particular caught his eyes. He stopped and stared at it for a long time trying to decipher whether or not what he was seeing was real. "Is this-" He paused, "Is this me?" He flipped the book around so that Tom could see.<br/>Tom didn't give so much as a glace at the book, "Yeah." He continued typing away. "I like drawing you, you sit really still so it's easy."<br/>Draco began flipping through the pages, by the time he had got to the last sketch he had counted a total of six pictures of himself. Draco felt a tear roll down his cheek, he gulped, "Can I- can I keep one?"<br/>Tom finally put his phone away, "Which one?" He asked protectively.<br/>Draco smiled, "The one where I'm reading."<br/>"No way, that one's my favorite!" Tom said shaking his head, "Sorry, pick a different one." <br/>"But-!" Draco was about to protest.<br/>"I'm kidding, if you want that one, then it's yours." Tom said.</p>
<p>That was two weeks ago, Tom and Draco had become best friends since then. Anytime Draco was being picked on Tom would come to his rescue, and every day at lunch Draco would sit with Tom so that he wasn't a loner anymore. Yes their friendship was blossoming, and things were finally turning around for Draco. His bullies weren't bothering him anymore, other than snide remarks, and Draco didn't feel completely alone anymore. <br/>Draco opened the door to his dorm room and was shocked to see Tom packing his things.<br/>"Spring cleaning?" Draco asked confused. In the back of his mind he already knew that wasn't the case, he just didn't want to face the facts.<br/>Tom looked up sadly, "Sorry Draco, the school has a strict no fighting policy, and I uh-" He nodded his head slowly, "I got expelled. My step dad said he's transferring me to a public school."<br/>Draco's world crashed around him, "What about me?" He asked.<br/>Tom chuckled lightly, "Draco, you're brave." He patted him on the head, "And you have my number, if someone bothers you, call me, I'll put them in their place quicker than they can say Abracadabra." <br/>Draco smiled, "Okay." <br/>After packing all of his things Tom gave Draco a hug and told him to "Stay brilliant, Einstein." Then he was gone.</p>
