    <p>“What if we just add a teeny bit?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“He won’t even taste it!”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Please, Moony! You can’t say ‘no’ to me. I’m injured!”</p><p>“And putting Blitz's in Slughorn’s pumpkin juice will make you heal faster?”</p><p>“No, but it would be really funny.”</p><p>James narrowly avoids being stabbed with a fork by grabbing hold of the irate werewolf’s wrist. They stare each other down until Remus, remembering that he’s an adult, drops the fork. James does not let go.</p><p>“C’mon Moony. Remember the time Slughorn compared your essay to some posh pureblood’s in front of the whole class. You <em>must</em> want to get back at him for humiliating you like that?”</p><p>Remus tries to snatch his wrist back, but James just pulls him closer. He sighs, “Listen, Prongs. Dumbledore had to beg Slughorn to even consider returning this year. I’m not going to screw up his hard work, especially after all the trouble he went through to hire me.”</p><p>James scoffs, but releases him. “Shouldn’t have been any trouble to begin with. You’re better than the last dozen DADA professors they’ve had through this place. Trust me, I’ve heard some stories. If the Ministry wasn’t a huge sack of hippogriff-”</p><p>“Nevertheless,” Remus cuts him off calmly. “I owe Dumbledore. We both do.”</p><p>James winces at the reminder. His right knee begins to throb as if it had heard Remus, too. His healer had given him a potion for the pain, but he refused to take it, because it made him feel dizzy and like a git for needing a potion at all.</p><p>Despite the pain, James could not truthfully say he regretted going after those three Death Eaters by himself. Apparently, a decade at the Ministry hadn’t been enough to curb the reckless marauder inside of him.</p><p>James had explicitly ignored Scrimgeour’s instructions to hold off on responding to the active crime scene, but people were in danger. As tough as he was, the Head Auror loved to bide his time until he could ensure a front-page worthy victory. James had no such reservations.</p><p>James is, however, over thirty. That's more than old enough to admit that his plan, or lack thereof, had needed a bit more stealth. If it had, perhaps he would still have two spry knees and a stable job.</p><p>If Dumbledore had not requested him personally to guard the chosen one, James surely would have been sacked after his three months of ‘recovery leave’.</p><p>Remus nudges him lightly out of his reverie. There’s a small smile on his face when he says, “Besides, If I remember correctly, <em>you</em> were that posh pureblood whose essay was <em>oh so exemplary</em>.”</p><p>James chuckles, “No, I think you’re confused about that bit.”</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>“Yes, maybe a shock of excitement would jog your memory.” He smirks and shakes the small vial of Blitz’s popping stones.</p><p>“Do me a favor and ignore me for the rest of the year.” Remus rolls his eyes and turns to face the rest of the Great Hall, which is buzzing in anticipation of the opening feast. James pouts.</p><p>“I second that request,” a voice says behind them.</p><p>James turns to find Lily Evans taking a seat on the other side of him. She looks every bit the serious professor with her hair tucked into a neat bun and shiny new robes that match her eyes. James hasn’t seen her since The Order meeting Kingsley had hosted early this summer.  He had missed his friend, even if only to annoy her.</p><p>“If I recall correctly, Evans, it was <em>you </em>who had trouble ignoring me at Molly’s birthday dinner past spring,” he smirks, shuffling his hair. “Not that I minded.”</p><p>Lily narrows her eyes at him. Someone who didn’t know her as well as James would’ve missed the faint blush on her cheeks. Of course, she ignores him, leaning over to greet Remus. “How’s your husband? He made the biggest fuss about me leaving St. Mungo’s and hasn’t answered one of my owls since.”</p><p>“Ah yes, the loss of his ‘work-wife’ was one of Sirius’ bigger tantrums this summer. It was second only to the loss of his actual husband,” Remus sighs, gesturing to himself in the Great Hall as opposed to their small cottage in Kent. Lily smiles, but it’s a bit sad. James feels a sudden rush of longing for his very best friend. “Actually, he’s well, if not a bit lonely.”</p><p>“Of course,” Lily nods. “What would he do without his other half over here?” she gripes, pointing to James, who’s been sat pouting between the two.</p><p>Remus laughs loudly. “I can’t be sure. I was reading a letter about how much he missed me this morning and got halfway through before realizing it was for James. I left it on your desk, by the way.”</p><p>“Thank you,” James responds, rolling his eyes. “Now if you could please stop flirting with my ex-girlfriend right in front of me…”</p><p>“Stop reminding people about that,” Lily groans. “If it spreads to the students, I’m quitting.”</p><p>“It could only help your reputation,” James sniffs, in mock offense.</p><p>Lily does not get the chance to hex him then, because Dumbledore calls the hall to attention.</p><p>James zones out during the introductions except to raise his eyebrows at Evans upon hearing that she is on as a Charms Apprentice. <em>“Why did you think I was here?” “To stalk me. Ouch! Okay, sorry.” </em>It’s not until Remus nudges him that he realizes Dumbledore must be talking about his presence in the castle.</p><p>“…Auror Stunchorn has taken leave with his family in the Mediterranean coast. Auror Potter has been kind enough to fill his position. With the increased number of violent incidents in Wizarding Britain, we are beyond thankful for the Ministry’s continued… assistance.”</p><p>James wonders how the Headmaster manages to keep the venom out of his voice. There is no way Dumbledore is pleased about the Ministry’s involvement at Hogwarts. At best, it was a fluff position to cover the whole lot of nothing they were doing against Lord Voldemort. At worst, it was a means of getting the Dark Lord’s supporters into the castle.</p><p>James did find it interesting that Stunchorn had a sudden longing for the French countryside mere weeks after the Order had been tipped off to some of his darker hobbies.</p><p>The headmaster locks eyes with him as he concludes his speech. James wonders, not for the first time, why he was here. Surely, there was someone more qualified, and less reckless, to protect the Wizarding World’s only hope against the dark side.</p><p>As McGonagall begins the sorting ceremony, James looks to the crowd of cowering first years, trying to spot the savior.</p><p>“Neville is at the back,” Lily whispers. He doesn’t bother asking how she knew he had been searching.</p><p>“You know him? I didn’t think Augusta let him leave the house.”</p><p>“She doesn’t,” Lily grimaces. “He’s got light blonde hair, like Alice, remember? He’s the one standing next to Molly’s youngest boy.”</p><p>That certainly makes him easier to spot. The shock of red hair sticks out amongst the crowd. <em>Ron</em>, James remembers fondly. The boy had been caught trying to listen in on an Order meeting last year.</p><p>Then it must be Neville who stands next to the small Weasley, hands clutching fiercely at his toad. Another boy with messy, black hair is patting clumsily at Neville’s back, as if worried he would keel over.</p><p>The Great Hall erupts into whispers as Neville approaches the stand. James is pleased when he is sorted into Gryffindor despite the boy's nervous demeanor. Lily’s eyes are a little teary after that.</p><p>James thinks of Frank and Alice, wasting away in St. Mungo’s. Did Lily visit them often? Did Sirius? James pulls her hand into his and Remus covers both of theirs with his own, never looking away from the sorting.</p><p>In that moment, James feels very warm and very strong. <em>‘…and a tad bit ungrateful’</em>, he thinks sheepishly. There he was, with some of his closest friends and in a place that he once considered a home. It was far better than his stuffy Ministry cubicle.</p><p>For a moment, he basks in the warmth of Great Hall. He’s thinking that perhaps his life has changed for the better, when Professor McGonagall calls a ‘Harry Potter’ up to be sorted.</p><p><em>Odd, </em>James thinks, when the same boy who had been comforting Neville approaches the hat.</p><p>“Do you have relatives in Britain?” Remus whispers, noticing too the boy’s dark brown skin and thick, messy hair.</p><p>James shakes his head. Gringotts loved to remind him that his was the last line of the Potter family and he should take care to see it continue. James had no siblings or cousins. The boy could not be one of <em>his </em>Potters.</p><p>“Perhaps he’s a Muggleborn. Potter is a common name amongst non-magic folk, right?” James suggests. His friends do not respond.</p><p>Harry Potter’s sorting takes longer than average. The resemblance is truly incredibly the longer James stares. The poor kid even seems to have his family’s horrid eyesight. For a moment, James entertains the thought that this is some elaborate prank, courtesy of Padfoot.</p><p>He could not tell you why he breathes a sigh of relief when the hat calls out “Gryfffindor!” Harry Potter looks a bit surprised and frowns briefly at the Slytherin table before moving to a seat next to Neville.</p><p>The sorting continues as James tries to shake the worry settling under his skin.</p><p>“Perhaps one of my relatives were disowned way back when and… had a few sprogs,” James tries for nonchalant, but his voice is too high. Remus and Lily share a look.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Lily nods. Merlin bless her, because she looks so torn between being sympathetic and using common sense. “But the Potters aren’t exactly the type to blow you off the family tapestry, are they?”</p><p>Remus, much more willing to let James revel in his bullshit, shrugs and says, “It’s just a coincidence, Prongs, unless you have a kid you don’t know about.” He chuckles, albeit forced. James hopes he manages a believable smile.</p><p>Suddenly, James is not in the Great Hall but rather in his old flat on Pemberly Crescent, begging the boy he loved to stop packing his things and <em>listen to me, goddammit!</em> The war had been so new, as had their relationship. When Regulus left their flat that night, James thought the boy had just gone to crash at Padfoot and Moony’s. He didn’t even consider that the young Black had been prepared to leave behind everything and everyone.</p><p>That was a lifetime ago. <em>A </em><em>little over eleven years</em>, James thinks, cringing.</p><p>Regulus had been so frightened then, James remembers, dread rushing down his skull. Could he have found out he was pregnant and, what, runaway? Why? James hadn’t been a perfect boyfriend, but surely, <em>surely</em>, Regulus cared enough to let him know. Right?</p><p>The questions are making him dizzy and his knee hurts something horrid.</p><p>“Yes, a weird coincidence,” James agrees, sending reassuring looks to his friends.</p><p>He tries to eat his food as if the broom hadn’t just been pulled out from under him at fifty feet high. He almost convinces himself of it too, until he chances a look towards Gryffindor table and finds Harry Potter’s sharp grey eyes piercing into him.</p>
