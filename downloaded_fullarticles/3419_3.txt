    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Welcome to Pizza 2 Take, would you like a slice of pizza to take away?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl who had just barrelled through the (clearly labelled, mind you) doors of Pizza 2 Take looked at Audrey as if she were an alien. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Pizza?” she tried again, wondering if the girl maybe didn’t speak English.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But pizza was pizza in any language, right? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you, I’m just — “ the girl glanced out the window uneasily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, avoiding someone, honestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be out of your hair in a flash.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Suit yourself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t like Pizza 2 Take was particularly busy at this time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Customers only kept her from her from the calculus textbook tucked under the till and Jonny in the back from his Corrie reruns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As far as Audrey was concerned, people were allowed to duck in for some shelter from the elements or prying eyes from time to time. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ten seconds later she was seriously reconsidering that stance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A tall and rather remarkable-looking bloke — red hair, glasses in a style that had barely been popular when her parents were her age, an honest-to-God pinstripe suit, and had she mentioned <em>tall? — </em>burst in, bringing the rain with him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Penny?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The girl turned abruptly to the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Actually, I’ll have a slice of the anchovy and tomato, please.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This did not deter Tall, Red and Vintage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Penny, what’s going on?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve been trying to owl you for months —“<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Was that one of those new Internet things, Audrey wondered?) — “and then I ran into Loretta outside the Ministry last week and she said you didn’t want to see me — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would you like that warmed up?” Audrey asked loudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The girl, whom she inferred was Penny, had not turned to look at her redheaded pursuant once, so Audrey decided to give her a hand in ignoring the bugger. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Please,” Penny replied crisply. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Audrey turned to stick the slice of anchovy and tomato (nasty stuff, hopefully this was just to throw Red off) in the microwave, she heard Penny hiss, “You might want to back away, Percy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wouldn’t do for your Ministry friends to see you consorting with a halfblood, would it.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A moment of silence, during which Audrey did not turn around because this was just starting to get good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is that what this is about then?” he — Percy — finally muttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My <em>job</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pen —“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s not — for Merlin’s sake, Percy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not just a job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your employers would <em>literally</em> like to murder people like my mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What are you going to do when they come after her?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they come after me?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But it won’t come to that, Penny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know Scrimgeour is bowing under a bit, but I firmly believe the rule of law — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, you believe in the rule of law more than you believe in my mother’s life, apparently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s what this is about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until you can look your own mother in the eye, <em>do not try to contact me again</em>.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The microwave dinged into the strained silence following that remark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Judging it as safe as it was going to get, Audrey grabbed the slice of pizza and made her way back to the awkward tableau at the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’ll be two pounds,” she said cheerfully. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Penny passed over the money with a strained smile, then picked up her pizza and darted back out into the rain. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy still hadn’t moved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was staring at the counter, mouth half-open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Audrey had to put<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a name to the expression, she would have said shocked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, devastated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Devastatingly shocked? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Slice of pizza to take away?” she asked. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That pulled him out of his funk with a snap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He blinked at her as if she were an alien.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What <em>was</em> it with people today? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would you like a slice of pizza?” she asked again, more slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time he shook his head. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sorry, I don’t have any Mu — any money on me.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“On the house,” she offered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just this once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You look like your dog died or something.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t have a dog,” he said, but he allowed her to heat up a slice of sausage and mushroom for him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He ate it right there at the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is actually quite good,” he somehow managed to squeeze out between bites. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey had to wonder if he’d never had pizza before. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, it’s always less than two hours old.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the Pizza 2 Take guarantee for you.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She’d meant it to be ironic but he nodded very seriously, as though she were imparting wisdom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bizarre bloke. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You look like something out of a black and white movie,” she said on impulse, hoping to get a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just slap a fedora on you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where’d you manage to find glasses like that?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He only blinked owlishly at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey sighed. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thank you for the pizza,” he said tentatively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I’ll pay it back next time.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Next time?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A repeat customer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who had eaten their pizza while 100% sober? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The corner of his mouth curled up just the slightest bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, reckon I’ll be back.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">***</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And indeed he was back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, over the course of the next year Percy became a regular (their only evening regular, Pizza 2 Take being rather a got-a-pizza-craving-while-utterly-smashed-after-the-kitchen-closed-at-the-pub sort of place). </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He stopped by at least once a week, and Audrey had to admit she looked forward to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She enjoyed seeing his bizarre fashion decisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somehow on casual days they were even worse than the pinstriped suit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had come in one Sunday evening in honest-to-God <em>bell bottoms</em> and a red plaid shirt that clashed in his hair and Audrey had had to bit her lip hard to keep from bursting out laughing. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And yet, since that first dramatic encounter, they had never exchanged anything more significant than a few mundane remarks about the weather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That all changed on a misty evening in April.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked up from the customer she’d just served when the door opened, and smiled as she caught sight of the distinctive hair and glasses. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The usual?” she asked as Percy approached the counter. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Please.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey had only just turned away to start heating his preferred variety when the customer she’d just served — ham and onion — said, in an undertone she was probably not intended to hear, “So my information wasn’t wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fancy that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Junior Assistant to the Minister enjoys dining in a mediocre Muggle quick-serve.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, she couldn’t begrudge him the “mediocre”. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy made such an awful sound that Audrey risked a quick glance to see if he was choking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t appear to be, but his face had gone deathly pale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lee?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The one and only.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey spared another glance for Mr. Ham and Onion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d looked tired and grim when he’d come in, and his clothes were dirty and worn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey had suspected he was homeless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And maybe he was — <em>or maybe Percy was a spy</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My information is good?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Absolutely spy talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Junior Assistant to the Minister?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d never been able to figure out who Percy might be working for and who Penny’s mother might be that his employers wanted her dead. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy’s next words didn’t entirely deter her suspicions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How — what — did something happen?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My father — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your family’s fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then, if something had happened, you would have heard already, your lot is pretty keen on catching up with Undesirables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know when you last caught up with them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George’s ear healed up and Bill’s apparently not suffering any long-term ill-effects from his run-in with Greyback.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What — what happened to his ear?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“All in hiding now though,” Ham and Onion continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Even Ginny, they attacked while she was home on Easter break.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy paled further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Burrow?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ham and Onion sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mate — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The beeping of the microwave cut him off and Audrey scurried to grab the pizza and look more busy than eavesdrop-y. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By the time she returned to the counter with the three slices, Ham and Onion was gone. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Five pounds,” she told Percy, and then, noticing that the was still pale and wide-eyed, “You alright there?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nodding, he pressed the money into her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Think I might… stay a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that’s alright by you.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey shrugged. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had his head in his hands, pizza still untouched, when she went to clear the area Ham and Onion had occupied earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the midst of the half-eaten pizza and paper napkins, she found a massive gold coin. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What on earth?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy lifted his head the barest inch to look, then jumped out of his seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He must have — can I see?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My, er, one of my brothers collects coins.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">This seemed a flimsy excuse, but she passed it over.  He stared at the coin a long moment, then closed his eyes and ran his finger around the edge. </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Must have been left by the bloke who was here earlier,” Audrey commented, keeping an eagle eye on Percy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Reckon him for a panhandler.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, he’s — “ Percy’s eyes snapped open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m familiar with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can return this to him if you want — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Go ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or keep it yourself, whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he meant it as a tip but we aren’t a tipping kind of establishment.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She hadn’t meant much by it, but suddenly Percy’s face was right in front of hers, eyes earnest as they gazed into hers, and his hand sat tentatively on her shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you,” he said solemnly. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh — “ Audrey blinked, and Percy was gone faster than she’d thought possible. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, it took a full day for the warmth on her shoulder to dissipate. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">****</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Two weeks later, a ringing phone woke Audrey from a doze in front of the telly. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You know a tall guy, red hair, dorky glasses, maybe a little off his rocker?” Pam, the late-night cashier at Pizza 2 Take, demanded as soon as Audrey picked up. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah I know him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comes in once or twice a week around suppertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had Percy changed his hours?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were the spies out to get him?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey rubbed at her tired eyes and tried to focus. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He was in here not two minutes ago asking for you.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“For me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey’s breath caught.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted to see her …?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“For me <em>by name</em>?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well it is on your nametag, love,” was Pam’s sarcastic reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Anyway, it was really weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Said he’d hoped to see you because he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to come back soon, and thanks for the coin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just a customer, you said?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d be triple-locking my doors and windows if I were you…” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey laughed, told Pam to sod off, and slowly lowered the phone to her lap when the other woman rang off. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wouldn’t be around for a while, but he wanted to say goodbye to her?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d dropped by at — she glanced at her watch — half past eleven?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the bloody hell did that mean? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was, Audrey had to remind herself, highly unlikely that he was actually a spy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A spy who had fallen in love with her so hard at first sight that he’d endured a year of tasteless pizza with the consistency of cardboard for the chance at her company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A spy who couldn’t talk about more than the weather for fear of giving himself away, and who couldn’t ask her on a date for fear of making her a target, but wore ridiculous outfits because he knew she enjoyed them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A spy who had to leave on a dangerous mission from which he might not return, but knew he’d die full of regret if he didn’t see her one last time and tell her what she meant to him, and was devastated to find that she wasn’t at the only place he knew where to find her…</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey forced herself to drink the tea that had gone cold and bitter during her unintended nap to bring herself back to reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chances dorky Percy was a James Bond type, or even a Q for that matter, were close to nil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d mentioned the coin— he had probably discovered that it was worth quite a lot of money, wanted to thank her and let her know he could afford real pizza now. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That must be it. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still… </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, dashing red-headed spies in horn-rimmed glasses and pinstriped suits continued to pop up in her dreams. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">***</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey was in her final term at uni.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon she would be looking for real jobs and leaving Pizza 2 Take behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea filled her with both anticipation and anxiety, because being a real adult in a real job sounded scary. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">…and also, a little bit, because she sometimes panicked that if she wasn’t at Pizza 2 Take a certain not-spy would never be able to find her again, if he even wanted to, if he even was still alive. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It had been very nearly a year since the strange late-night phone call, and she’d heard nothing of him, even though she’d scanned the papers for mentions of a rare coin sale for the first few months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably it wasn’t a rare enough coin to merit mention in the papers, and she was definitely not far gone enough to read Coin Collectors Weekly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(She was just far gone enough to take a walk through the library and discover that Coin Collectors Weekly was something that existed.) </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In any event, most days, most weeks even, she didn’t think of Mysterious Percy or any of his mysterious, poor-taste-in-pizza friends. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then it happened. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Audrey was working a Saturday lunch shift — somewhat unusual occurrence — when he came back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had just finished cleaning the tomato sauce from the floor where a small child had somehow managed to upend an entire pizza, and was putting the mop back into the cupboard when the bell above the door tinkled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked up, ready to greet the new customer —</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And there he was. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was wearing faded jeans and a navy blue jumper, and glasses that didn’t make him look like a runaway from the 1950s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thought his hair was different, although she never could have told you how.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked more than just one year older than the last time she’d seen him — <em>but it was him</em>. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He glanced at her with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She realized her own mouth was hanging open and quickly rearranged it. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s new since the last time I was here,” he said, indicating the bell above the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, I’m sure you don’t remember me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I used to come in here quite often for a while —“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course I remember you,” she managed finally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sausage and mushroom.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He grinned, and a dimple appeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A dimple!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m so glad I made an impression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That will make this a little less awkward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although, I’m sure it will still be —“ </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why did you stop coming by?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The question was out before she’d fully formed the thought, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she slapped a hand over her mouth in embarrassment at her own rudeness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m so sorry, it’s none of my business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You were saying?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy suddenly looked very tired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s a very long story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll tell it to you if you want, but not here or now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Will you have — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The stupid bloody bell above the door interrupted what she <em>seriously</em> hoped had been the start of “have dinner with me”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cognizant that this was, really, her job, Audrey cast a glance at the newcomer, then did a double-take as a man even taller and with even brighter red hair than Percy came over to stand next to him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh good, I’m starving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pizza any good here, Perce?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, it’s awful,” Percy answered immediately, and then stopped with an embarrassed glance at Audrey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, I’m so sorry!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is…” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His ears were bright red.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey threw her head back and laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d <em>known</em> no one could like the pizza here that much. </span>

  <span class="s1">“Oh, I know the pizza’s awful, never eat it myself,” she said cheerfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The question is, why’d <em>you</em> keep on coming in here so often?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The flush had spread to his cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Very convenient, you know, on the way home from work, and I’m rotten in the kitchen…” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The other man let out a guffaw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Right Perce, that’s the only reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hello, there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stuck his hand out for Audrey to shake, and she took it cautiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m Charlie, Percy's older and fitter brother.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy made a choking sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey just said, “Hmm.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The bell went off again, and wouldn’t you know it, a third brilliantly red-haired man came in. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s where you lot got to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was starting to think I — well, <em>hello</em>.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The newest one elbowed Charlie out of the way and executed a bow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“George Weasley at your service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hero, small business owner, entertainer of small children, possessor of mysterious tragic past, et cetera.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dashing rapscallion younger brother to these two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enchanted to make your acquaintance, Ms. — er —blank name tag.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jonny had apparently come round from the kitchen to deliver the fresh pizzas during this exchange, because Audrey could hear him chuckle behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Blimey, this is better than an episode of Corrie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go on then, Aud, you’re supposed to pick one of ‘em.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shut it, Jonny, I’m having a moment.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He laughed his way back to the kitchen, and Audrey smiled at the three very attractive men in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, gents, I’m on shift until three, and unfortunately this area is reserved for customers only… I don’t suppose I can interest any of you in a salami and olive pizza straight from the oven?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Audrey,” Percy began, and he’d <em>remembered her name</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost a whole year, and he’d remembered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She beamed at him and he apparently lost whatever else he’d been about to say. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sausage and mushroom for you, I presume,” she said, taking pity on him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The others declined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, shoo then,” she said, making a sweeping gesture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Paying customers only in here.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy waited until they were outside before he began again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey, would — that is, are you —er — I mean — “</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was so adorable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His ears were red again, and his hands fidgeted with his billfold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Audrey felt her heart swell three sizes. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m out of here at three.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can you be back here then?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">He stared at her a moment, then nodded.  “I can do that.” </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Giving into temptation, she reached out to touch one of the red streaks that had spread onto his cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Looking forward to it.” </span>
