    <p>Aziraphale and Castiel</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the beginning, angels were not warriors. God’s first children were created to sing, to worship, to love. The Archangels were the first, and they taught their younger brethren to take delight in all of these things.</p>
<p>Then came the war and angels had to accept a new role, a role of a warrior. They had to learn how to use weapons against their kin, to put aside singing in favour of fighting.</p>
<p>Some took easily to their new role. (Michael) Some did not. (Gabriel) Most accepted their new role with the same devotion that they had shown for all of their former duties. (And some secretly felt that carrying a sword wasn’t quite <em>them</em>, might end up giving it away if the opportunity ever came.)</p>
<p>But if heaven after the war now had a surplus of newly created weapons, it lacked on angels to wield them. Approximately half of the host had fallen, and this meant that new angels were needed. New angels who could protect heaven and Earth from the adversary and their followers.</p>
<p>These new angels were not created to sing praises, they were created to defend creation. They were strong, they were resolute, they were loyal and unquestioning.</p>
<p>But even the fiercest apex predator starts out as an awkward and helpless baby, and while angels are technically created unchanging and fully mature, they do need time to <em>learn</em> and <em>grow</em> into their terrifying-weapon-of-God existence.</p>
<p>This is where the original host came in. Mourning the loss of their kin, traumatised by the war, and desperate to feel love again, they were given the duty of nurturing their younger siblings and teaching them the ways of angels, so that they too would be able to serve the creator with all their capability and zeal.</p>
<p>When Castiel first came into being, with a whispered word of their name given to them by the creator, they were confused, bombarded by all these new sensations around them, and slightly afraid. After all the chaos of experiencing existence, there was a soothing touch of grace mingling with their own, and a voice reverberated in their consciousness, gifting Castiel with the knowledge of enochian.</p>
<p>Enochian, the language of the angels is a graceful language perfectly suited for the beings that spoke it, so successful translations into any human tongue are almost always impossible. However, If one were to try to translate what the warm presence soothing Castiel was saying, it would come out something like this:</p>
<p>“Well, look at you my dear, aren’t you just the cutest, yes you are, you little adorable wavelength. Just look at those teensy-weensy frequencies! There you go dear, just let me link you up to my grace, such a good little fledgling, oh you are a shy one aren’t you? Not to worry. There, there, I got you safe and secure little one.”</p>
<p>(It sounded, of course, more majestic in enochian)</p>
<p>What Castiel learned next, was that they were not alone. Aside from the big, safe, and warm presence that kept Castiel folded in the embrace of their own grace, there were others like Castiel. Small wavelengths that didn’t quite know how to <em>be</em>. These were: Anael and Uriel, whose frequencies were stronger and steadier than Castiel’s; This was because they had been created before Castiel, and had already had time to learn how to manage themselves somewhat; There was Balthazar, who had also been just created, and was just as messy, and all-over as Castiel, if not maybe in a more robust and brave manner.</p>
<p>“I am Aziraphale.” Said the warm and safe being holding them all in cradle of their grace. “And I will be taking care of you little ones, for now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aziraphale helped them to find the limits of where one’s own wavelengths ended and others' started. How to feel yourself and how to manipulate yourself according to your will. How to vibrate in different frequencies and how to turn your inner thoughts into speak. How to listen to the hum and chatter of the host, and how to make others in the host hear you. How to sign praises for the creator, and how to harmonise with the others to sign hymns.</p>
<p>(“they are warriors, Aziraphale! They don’t need to know and memorise every single hymn that we have ever sung.” Pointed out Zachariah, in a <em>tone</em>.</p>
<p>“Proper appreciation for the arts is a vital for anyone.” Answered Aziraphale, also in a <em>tone</em>.)</p>
<p>And when they could feel themselves properly as part of the host, Aziraphale took them from the upper spheres of heaven to the physical world, all brand new. In the physical world, there were all new things to learn and to absorb.</p>
<p>Holding a form that was not just a Wavelength of Celestial Intent for one.</p>
<p>Aziraphale handled his wings, heads, eyes (and there were a lot of them), limbs, wheels, and heavenly flames effortlessly, if maybe a tad fussily. What seemed so easy to Aziraphale, was anything but to the fledglings who were still getting used to the idea of physical matter.</p>
<p>The trickiest part of the whole “physical form” experience were the wings; That was what Castiel resolutely believed, hunkering at the edge of one of Saturn’s rings, wings trembling and the space around them so vast and great and terrifying.</p>
<p>“There now, dear. You’ll get the hang of it very easily, don’t you worry. All the others were afraid too when taking the first leap.”</p>
<p>Castiel was not sure of this at all. Anael and Uriel had jumped off without hesitation and Balthazar had done a little flip, all eyes defiant and flaming, with bravado.</p>
<p>“Just remember, I will catch you if you don’t make it. You have absolutely nothing to worry about”.</p>
<p>Castiel flapped their wings once and then twice, trying to appear braver than they felt. Their wheels still spun fast and the flames licking those wheels sputtered unevenly. Aziraphale graciously ignored these signs of nervousness, and nudged Castiel with one of their heads in encouragement.</p>
<p>When all of castiel’s eyes were on Aziraphale, said angel flung themselves to the open space, demonstrating the way to open your wings to glide through the empty darkness, shining bright with celestial light.</p>
<p>Castiel flapped their own wings, made to jump, hesitated, tried again, still stopped right at the edge, and flapped their wings in frustration. Anael and Uriel were small specks in the distance, studying the comets. Balthazar was a streak of light doing loops and twists, without a worry in the world. Soon they would notice that Castiel was the only one still on a rock. That could not be. Castiel was an angel of the lord, fearless and powerful warrior of God. They couldn’t be afraid of flying.</p>
<p>Before they had time to be afraid again, Castiel dropped, and spread their wings.</p>
<p>The world went spinning, and castiel was not in control of any of it. They tried flapping their wings, but they couldn’t right themselves at all, all of their eyes kept wildly trying to look into every direction and the gravitational pull of different heavenly bodies was too much for them to control where they kept falling. When the panic had built to its peak, with Castiel’s wings flapping a panicked, uneven rhythm that did nothing but disorient Castiel more, a strong hold came around them, warm and steady.</p>
<p>“Hush now. Calmly, my dear. I’m here, I’ve got you. Let your grace settle, vibrate with me dear, high and low, high and low, there you go. Now. Extend those wings, all the way. Let’s do this together. Now flap slowly, I’ll keep holding, just flap your wings together with me. Let’s find a rhythm.”</p>
<p>With Aziraphale’s grace a steady presence against Castiel’s own, Castiel was able to calm themselves and let their wings fall into a steady beat following the rhythm Aziraphale set with their owns. Gradually the hold Aziraphale had on Castiel’s form retreated, until only one appendage was lightly holding onto Castiel’s own and Castiel was steadily gliding through space on their own power.</p>
<p>“See dear. I knew you would pick it up just like that. Well done Castiel.”</p>
<p>Aziraphale let go of Castiel entirely, but the warm hum of their grace stayed a comforting background sensation nearby, as Castiel stretched their wings and did a little roll of delight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aziraphale would take them all around the galaxy, to witness the birth of new stars, to race with comets, and to explore meteor fields. Aziraphale even showed them the basics of sword-wielding, but they are not a very enthusiastic teacher when it comes to the art of war. They are much happier to take the fledglings to hover over Earth, the planet still under construction for the day that Man shall finally awaken in the garden, and to marvel at the fluffy clouds swirling around the planet in such pretty patterns.</p>
<p>When the day (and the concept of days in general) is announced for the arrival of the Man, it came time for their excursions to end. Aziraphale has been appointed the honour of guarding the eastern gate from the forces of hell, and the new generation of angels, it is decided, will join the garrisons and start learning the art of war in depth.</p>
<p>Aziraphale is talking about corporations with the angel tasked with crafting them (a shape close enough to the Man that they will not frighten the new creature too much if he comes across the guardians by the gates), when Castiel barrels in and latches onto Aziraphale with their grace.</p>
<p>“Ah, excuse me for a moment.” Aziraphale says to the bemused crafter, trying to untangle Castiel from their person.</p>
<p>“Castiel?”</p>
<p>“They’re sending you down there, to fight demons!”</p>
<p>“Ah. They are sending me to guard Eden, actually.”</p>
<p>“From demons.”</p>
<p>“Yes dear, From demons.” Aziraphale acquiesced. “That is what we angels are for.”</p>
<p>Castiel’s wings trembled slightly. “The war was against demons, and angels died in it.”</p>
<p>Aziraphale would have sighed, had they been in their new corporation. As they were, they just trilled a little. “I know dear. But this won’t be like that. I’ll just be guarding the gate. It’ll be quite all right, my dear. Don’t you worry about me, you just focus on your studies in heaven.”</p>
<p>“Can I visit you?”</p>
<p>“Maybe sometimes, at the gate.” Aziraphale brushed against Castiel’s wings with their own. “You’ll be busy making new friends in the garrison, I’ll bet. Won’t have any time to fret over me, not that you should, of course.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to go.” Castiel projected in a frequence so low, that it was practically a very silent whisper.</p>
<p>“Hush now. What nonsense. I have been given a great honour by the creator, there is no sense being gloomy over it, you silly thing. We are all part of the host, I’m not leaving you, not really.” (Poor young Castiel, who did not know what it felt like when half of the host truly, irrevocably was gone. And hopefully never would.) “Just be brave and keep your feathers in order.”  </p>
<p>The younger angel calmed down, gathering themselves a bit self-consciously. “Of course, Aziraphale.”</p>
<p>“There’s a good angel. Now what you say, should we take short trip around the moon, just the two of us, to see the planet, before my assignment starts?”</p>
<p>“I would like that very much.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crowley and Crowley</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The year was 1723, and Fergus was not having a good time. He was, as a matter of fact, in Hell, where it was very, very, hard to have a good time.</p>
<p>Having just recently died, (in a gutter), three years before his ten-year contract (for three inches more in his willy), was due, he was understandably starting to think that his life choices had not entirely panned out for him.</p>
<p>He was being tortured, of course, but there was a certain vigour lacking in the demons assigned to torture him. There was almost a sense of disappointment in the demons, which was somehow even worse than the torture.</p>
<p>(Not even a murderer, this one. They never give me the big sinners to torture. Nah, always stuck with the nobodies.)</p>
<p>The worst hell, Fergus was starting to realise in a bout of uncharacteristic theological philosophy, was not to be found in the seventh circle, but in the humiliation of knowing that even in hell, you were unimportant, unwanted, unknown.</p>
<p>“That’s enough lads, we’ll take it from here.” Said a voice that sounded like nails on a chalkboard, that piqued Fergus' interest solely because it was not the same pitchfork poking him in the same place in the same rhythm by a bored demon. </p>
<p>“Honestly, torture has never been part of my job description. It’s not my department of excellence, so to say. I’m a field agent, I don’t see why-“ Said a second voice, this one very sibilant.</p>
<p>“All demons torture the souls of the damned, Crawly. And your quota is severely lacking.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, that my skills are much more aptly used when I’m up there, bringing in the goods, so to say. And it’s Crowley.”</p>
<p>“Your quota is unfulfilled, Crawly.”</p>
<p>“But it's just that the heaven’s agent is going to run rampant with divine miracles and inspiring the mankind if I’m not there, putting stop to all that.”</p>
<p>“Crawly! You will torture this soul, and you will torture this soul until I am satisfied that you have not lost your demonic aptitude for torture! This is an order from the prince himself!”</p>
<p>“….And how long will I torture this damned soul?”</p>
<p>“Until it turns.”</p>
<p>“Until it turns!? It takes bloody decades to turn mortal souls into demonic ones! Centuries even! They can’t expect to keep me down here that long!”</p>
<p>“Hell can, and Hell will. If you are so eager to get back up, I recommend you make the effort to work fast and cruel, like a proper demon.”</p>
<p>The one with the voice like nails on a chalkboard left, leaving the sibilant hisser behind. Fergus, whose soul was metaphorically (which in hell is also literal) speaking hanging upside down from meat hooks, finally saw the form of his new tormentor as it circled around to face him.</p>
<p>It looked like demons looked, horrifying and disgusting to behold at the same time. There were maggots involved. There were also a lot of spikes, things that went squelch, horns, scales, and teeth in places that didn’t need teeth. The least horrifying part of it were the eyes, bright yellow and slitted like snake’s.</p>
<p>“Aw, don’t look like that darling. Here I was eagerly waiting for our special time together.” Fergus broke the silence that was becoming awkward. </p>
<p>The demon made a noise that could almost be described as a snort.</p>
<p>“You are funny, human.”</p>
<p>“oh, stop. You’ll make me blush.”</p>
<p>The demon came closer, the fangs bared in something akin to a grin, which to a soul strapped to rack in hell was one of the most terrifying things one could encounter.</p>
<p>“I like you, human. You have spirit. What did you do to end in here?”</p>
<p>“Sold my soul.”</p>
<p>“For what?”</p>
<p>Fergus kept quiet. He was already in hell, he didn’t need to participate in his own torment. The demon peered closer and looked <em>into</em> Fergus with those serpentine eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, really!? For, G-, Sa-, someone’s sake! You absolute- absolute human. Three inches?! <em>Really</em>!”</p>
<p>“Well, in my defence, I was drunk off my ass!”</p>
<p>“How the hell do you get so drunk that you think that <em>this</em> was a good idea!?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you here to torture me!” Fergus huffed, thinking that a hot poker might be preferable to all this talking. </p>
<p>“Yeah…about that.”</p>
<p>From Fergus’ upside-down angle, the demon suddenly looked fidgety and a bit awkward. Its claws twisted around in a way that for human fingers would have been fidgety. Maybe Fergus had already spent too long in hell and gotten desensitised to the visors of demons, but this one didn’t look so threatening anymore. It was still a terrifying beast straight out of your nightmares, but it looked a bit lost.</p>
<p>“What? You don’t like torture, demon?” Fergus mocked it, in a move that was just as intelligent as selling your soul for a longer dick.</p>
<p>The demon in question hissed in indignation. “I just have better things to do with my time than carve into some foolish damned. Honestly, this is so medieval.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not complaining, you can just leave me here, I won’t tell your pals that you fucked off.”</p>
<p>The demon hissed again, this time more deliberate, like a cobra rearing up to strike.</p>
<p>“nah…I was given termsssss…..but…Maybe we can make a deal. A better one for you thisssss time. A frequent cusssstomer reward…to ssssay. I need to turn you into a demon, you need to get off the rack. Fine. I’ll turn you into a demon, and you will help me to do it quickly.”</p>
<p>“Turn me…into a demon? Is that even…possible?”</p>
<p>“Yessss. It will happen eventually anyway. That’ss what happens to the souls in here. But it issss a sslow process- decades-centuries even, of torture. Twisssting the human soul, it takes time. Unlesss the human isss willing of course.”</p>
<p>“And then I will get to come down? Will I still be…Me?”</p>
<p>A way to get of the rack should have been a no brainer, but a human instinct of survival is instilled so deep that still there was a part of Fergus that rebelled against the idea of losing himself, of dying again in a sense.</p>
<p>“It’s not so bad, being a demon. It’s not that different. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a nice little job at the office. I can pull some strings at the crossssroads department. They’re technically under my jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s a deal,” said Fergus, knowing that he was damned already, so to hell with it all.</p>
<p>“Glad to do business with you, the name’s Crowley.” Said the demon and leaned in to seal it with a kiss. Despite all the fangs, the maggots, the weird shape of the mouth, and the taste of brimstone, it was not the worst kiss Fergus had received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crowley would afterwards gain a bit of a reputation as the demon who had learned such tricks in the human world that he could break a soul in less than an hour. But then again, he was the serpent and therefore had to have some truly nefarious tricks hidden behind his scales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fergus had been working at the crossroads for about a century, with Crowley dropping in to have drinks with him from time to time, like an awkward, distant relative who tries his best to be part of your life, while also trying to appear distant and cool at the same time.</p>
<p>“Fergus.”</p>
<p>“Crowley.” Fergus saluted back, with his pint of ale in the shady bar in the shadowy underbelly of London. “How’s the tempting.”</p>
<p>“Good, good. You know, the usual. The heavenly adversary gets in the way from time to time, but you know how it is.”</p>
<p>Fergus nodded, secretly suspecting that Crowley and his heavenly adversary might not be locked in an epic never-ending battle as much as the rest of hell thought they were. He was almost sure that he had spotted them feeding ducks at St. James 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“And how are crossroads?”</p>
<p>“I was promoted to higher manager about a decade ago, as a matter of fact. They think I have a talent for tempting.”</p>
<p>The two demons clinked their glasses together, and Crowley tasted his own drink with the tip of a very long, forked tongue.</p>
<p>“Concerning that…I have a proposition for you?”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“The crossroads are technically under my jurisdiction, so I have to write the reports downstairs, but I’m not really involved these days, haven’t been in a long time, and you know hell and paperwork…”</p>
<p>Fergus did know. If he had thought that torture would end once he was under hell’s paycheck, he was wrong. It was debatable whether filling out hell’s paperwork was less painful than being on the rack.</p>
<p>“…And then I thought that it wouldn’t really matter as long as they get a yearly report from Crowley about the crossroads. They aren’t going to check.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“How would you like to be the new king of the crossroads? Pick Crowley as your demonic name, and you will get to share the sigil. Hell won’t care beyond that, as long as the paperwork checks out to a Crowley.”</p>
<p>“You are a devious, lazy bastard, serpent. Of course I’m in.”</p>
<p>“Cheers, mate. To a mutually beneficial business partnership!”</p>
<p>They drank to that, and then drank another round for the Earth and to humanity who kept them in business. Crowley had his glasses on, which was good, because after the third round, there was an embarrassing sensation of teary-eyed pride in seeing young Fergus flourish and grow into a such a promisingly wicked and enterprising young demon.</p>
