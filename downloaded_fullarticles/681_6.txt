    <p>August, 2001.</p><p>"Trollop!" Said the Fat Lady with a sneer.</p><p>"Whore!" Snapped Sir Cadogan.</p><p>"Way to go, my dear." Urged Brian Gagwilde III.</p><p>"She's had more pricks than a pincushion!" Continued the Fat Lady.</p><p>"They will have to bury her in a Y shaped coffin, you know." Agreed the deceased Knight of the Round Table.</p><p>"Give it some, girl!" Yelled Brian.</p><p>"Oh, shut up all of you!" </p><p>Hermione Granger had taken a lot of criticism lately about her healthy sex drive.</p><p>When she wasn't hard at work she was the first one to admit that her thoughts were mostly about sex.<br/>
If she wasn't making love she would probably be masturbating and dreaming of making love.<br/>
If she wasn't masturbating she would have her head in a book called 'Advanced Sexual Positions.'</p><p>The remarks from the moving pictures that adorned the walls of Hogwarts<br/>
were more than exaggerated, but nonetheless Hermione Granger had unleashed a hidden sexual obsession that she had embraced the first time she had slept with Ron Weasley.</p><p>Overnight she had taken a journey from a shy, virginal teen into a sex obsessed twenty something.</p><p>Since then she had certainly slept with others, male and female, and had blossomed into an experienced lover. </p><p>It was a complete accident that she stumbled in on Neville Longbottom as he was changing clothes.<br/>
The old Gryffindor member and staunch follower of Harry Potter during the Second Wizarding War had returned at the age of twenty two to become a teacher in the Herbology Department.</p><p>Hermione was happy to see him again and went along on his first day in class to wish him luck.<br/>
Unbeknownst to her the twenty one year old was still waiting for vacant rooms in the teachers quarters.</p><p>Until then he was using the Herbology classroom to bed down.<br/>
When Hermione stepped into the room Neville emerged from the small bathroom, stark bollock naked and drying his hair with a towel.</p><p>They stared at each other in silence for a good minute, during which the slim brunette could not fail to notice Neville's sizeable appendage.<br/>
Even in it's flaccid state the said organ looked to be at least eight inches long, and heaven only knew how big it grew when angry.</p><p>"Neville. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. That you were rooming here that is, not, you know."</p><p>She waved her right hand and then put it over her forehead.</p><p>"Although I certainly did not know about, about. Anyway! How are you? Settling in?"</p><p>Neville quickly retreated to the bathroom and Hermione cursed herself for being an idiot. </p><p>Exactly four days later Hermione was relaxing in her rooms, which were the refurbished office of the now defunct 'Defence Against the Dark Arts' class.</p><p>She had chosen the empty office and had changed it into a very comfortable personal abode. </p><p>The hour was ten and Hogwarts very own sex kitten had just enjoyed a luxuriant bubble bath.<br/>
She padded naked into the main room and sat beside the warming fire and opened her current favourite book to the 'standing missionary' position. </p><p>"Now that looks interesting."</p><p>As a warm glow came over her and her left hand found its way between her legs.<br/>
Lost in the moment she strummed her clit as she studied the vivid illustrations in the revealing book.</p><p>At that precise moment Neville Longbottom burst in unannounced, waving a thick and dusty tome in the air.</p><p>"Hermione! Hermione! You'll never guess what I found in the library. Oh!"</p><p>The tall and lanky wizard froze as he saw the steaming hot sight of the brunette frigging herself with her left leg flung up over the arm of her plush chair.<br/>
He had a perfect view of her recently shaven quim which glistened in the warm glow of the fire.</p><p>"I'm so sorry. I should have knocked."</p><p>"It's quite alright, Neville. Come on in."</p><p>She closed her legs and her medium sized breasts jiggled lightly on her chest as she sat upright.</p><p>"I...I just remembered a thing. See you."</p><p>Neville left just as quickly as he had arrived and Hermione chuckled at the absurdity of it all. </p><p>x</p><p>"So, is he really hung like a horse?"</p><p>Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley leaned in with lecherous grins.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Why, Neville Longbottom of course." Announced Ginny, her bright brown eyes twinkling in the light of the pub.</p><p>The three old friends were enjoying a girls night out in the popular Three Broomsticks pub in Hogsmeade.<br/>
Luna and Ginny had made the rare journey north for the first time since they had graduated from Hogwarts and had sought out Hermione to hear all the latest gossip. </p><p>"What makes you think I know?" Said an innocent looking Hermione Granger.</p><p>"Oh, please. We all know you, Hermione," said Luna as she raised her eyes to the ceiling. "Who haven't you had?"</p><p>"Ron, of course. Harry, Draco Malfoy..."</p><p>"What? How did you know about Draco and me?" Cried the dismayed brunette. </p><p>"HAH! So, it IS true! We were just bluffing. You must tell all, spare no details." </p><p>"You two. Words fail me."</p><p>Hermione leaned back and took a healthy slug of her redcurrant rum.<br/>
The room was busy, veritibly overcrowded in fact, as the not so innocent brunette gathered her thoughts. </p><p>"Alright, it's true. Draco and I did do the dirty deed, but it isn't what you think. I still abhor him AND his horrid family."</p><p>"Who doesn't? Ghastly git!" </p><p>Ginny slammed her glass of gillywater on the table in an obvious statement of assent. </p><p>"It was nearly a year ago," continued Hermione. "Just after Harry came out to Hogwarts to deliver a lecture to the students.</p><p>Headmistress Minerva McGonagall received a letter from Draco who wanted to organise a visit to our library in order to search for a rare book on alchemy.<br/>
He doesn't need money, he's so filthy rich, and collects and studies old manuscripts and artefacts as a hobby." </p><p>Hermione looked into space as she recalled that fateful day she and the silver haired Malfoy had sex.</p><p>Her rapt audience waited to hear more with bated breath.</p><p>"Get another round of drinks Ginny and I'll tell you everything."</p>
