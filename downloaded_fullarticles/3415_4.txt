    <p>I was sitting in a train compartment with my best friend Robert having a jellybean fight. I caught one in my mouth and threw one at him, hitting him in the eye. “Let’s stop playing, you’re dangerous.” He pouts.</p><p>“Sorry, Robert,” I got up to hug him.</p><p>“Better be.” He pushes me off of him.</p><p>“Asshole,” I hiss, sitting back down.</p><p>“Whatever, are you still going out with Malfoy?” He asks.</p><p>“Yes, in fact, he said he'd come and see me on the train.” I brag, checking my reflection in the window. If I wanted him to spend the whole train ride with me, I would have to look my best.</p><p>“I still say he's not worth your time.” Robert shook his head. He believes that I should find someone I didn’t have to share. I will admit there are some days when I want more, but most of the time I’m fine having a part-time boyfriend. I enjoyed the alone time and freedom that comes with our relationship.</p><p>“I know.” I roll my eyes. The door slides open. Draco steps in with Blaise Zabini and James Urquhart.</p><p>“Hey sexy,” Draco sat down and pulled me on his lap.</p><p>“Hi Draco,” I kiss his cheek.</p><p>“You look good today.” He ran one hand up my thigh and the other groped my breast. I was wearing a black tank top that had Slytherin Most Wanted, written in green on it, and a green mini body-con skirt.</p><p>“Slytherin most wanted?” Urquhart asks, sitting down next to Robert. Blaise sat down next to him.</p><p>“Like you already didn't know,” I stuck my tongue out at him.</p><p>“Yeah Urquhart, you know you have masturbated to my girl.” Draco teases.</p><p>“EWWW! That is too much information.” Robert made a disgusted face. Draco throws a smirk his way. I let out a sigh, whenever these two where together they went at it like cats and dogs. “From what I heard Hufflepuff wants a piece too.” Robert comes back with a smirk of his own. I felt Draco's body tense up against mine.</p><p>“What boys? I want names.” He snaps. It was ridiculous sometimes how possessive he would get. He wanted me to stay loyal to him, while he flaunts other girls in my face.  </p><p>“Practically all the boys in Hufflepuff. Cadwallader talks about her a lot.” Robert winks.</p><p>“Cadwallader,” I gasp, that boy was a dreamboat. He had a body of a Roman God and the jawline and cheekbones of a model.  </p><p>“Why the hell do you care?” Draco yells in my ear.</p><p>“Ouch Draco, I'm right here. And, I don't care, I just like knowing my fanboys.” I shrug.</p><p>“Sure.” He made his grip on my thigh tighter.</p><p>“I think we're almost there, I should go change.” I push his hands off of me to stand up. I tried to reach for my bag, but Rob put it on the back of the top-shelf.  “Damn you, Robert putting it so high.” I pout.</p><p>“I'll help you, babe.” Draco stood behind me, reaching over to grab my bag.</p><p>“Thanks, Draco.” I kiss his lips softly. He drops my bag to grab the back of my head making the kiss deeper than I would have made it in front of others. I nibbled on his bottom lip as his hands started to go south. Soon, they were completely up my skirt playing with the spandex of my panties.</p><p>“Hello, there are others still in the room,” Robert yells. Draco pulls away and glares at him.</p><p>“I should go change.” I pick my bag off the floor.</p><p>“I can help you with that.” Draco licks his lips.</p><p>“I think she can do it all on her own.” Robert rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Why don't you mind your own business?” Draco snaps. </p><p>I slip out of the compartment. I walk to the bathroom and change into my <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1b/7e/30/1b7e308e27aa97df21485e70f25d5dfc.jpg" rel="nofollow">version</a> of the Hogwarts uniform. A tight button-up shirt that had a low collar to show a lot of cleavages, gray skater skirt that stopped right after my bum, a garter belt, and stockings. I finish the outfit off with a pair of black platform heels, a see-through robe with my house seal on it, and a classic Slytherin tie. I fixed my hair and make-up in the mirror that got messed up while I was kissing Draco. </p><p>One thing I learned in my young life was that good looks came with a lot of benefits. People idolize and envy you. They wanted you to like them. Some people don’t like me, but they still wanted to please me. I have had people do my homework, wash my clothes, and buy me gifts, all without me asking. So, while people call me vain, I call myself powerful.   </p><p>I step out of the stall, only to run right into Pansy. “Waiting for something, Parkinson,” I ask.</p><p>“Is Draco with you?” She asks.</p><p>“Yeah and he’s staying there.” I glare at her. Couldn’t she take a hint, Draco came to me, not her?</p><p>“Not after he sees how good I look in my uniform and you look like trash in yours.” She looks me up and down in disgust. I looked her over the same way in return. She was wearing the regular school uniform. Skirt pasts her knees, shirt buttoned up all the way, knee-high socks with clunky dress shoes, and that thick rope on. She looks so normal, but I understood she had nothing to show off.</p><p>“Sure Pansy, we’ll see.” I laugh. I walked back to the compartment and felt eyes on me. I didn't mind, I like being the center of attention. “Ready to be embarrassed,” I giggle, opening the door to the compartment. I was walking over to Draco when Pansy pushed me out of the way. She sat herself down on his lap, smirking at me.</p><p>I smirk back at her before sitting on Urquhart’s lap. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Draco glaring at me as Pansy made a trail of kisses on his neck and gushes about missing him. My attention was forced away from him when Urquhart pushed me against the wall to attack my neck with kisses and bites. I couldn’t help the moans that left my mouth.</p><p>“I'm going,” Blaise walks out with a disgusted expression.</p><p>“Me too,” Robert shot me a look of disapproval, before exiting.  </p><p>He moves down to my collar bone, most likely leaving hickeys on my neck. His mouth was like a hover. This made me imagine what it would feel like in other places. His hands were in my shirt, fondling my breasts. I looked over at Draco to see that he was staring at me.</p><p>“I'm better than you are,” I mouthed to him, pointing at Urquhart then Pansy. He turned his body to Pansy but kept his eyes on me. I kept my eyes on him as I kissed Urquhart passionately.</p><hr/><p>I was in my underwear, while Urquhart was in his boxers. I could feel his excitement on my leg. Pansy looks like she was really into it, but Draco’s eyes were on me. He took her shirt off and his pants were around his ankles. 'Poor Pansy, she thinks she got all of Draco’s attention, but it's on me.' I thought, feeling victorious. I pulled away when I felt the train jerked to a stop. I hurry to put my clothes back on.</p><p>Urquhart pulls me over to him, wrapping his arms around my waist. “We can finish this later.” He whispers in my ear. I felt someone yank me out of his arms and into theirs. I smile feeling the familiar warmth. Draco held my waist tightly, pulling me out of the compartment.</p><p>“Drakie,” Pansy whines.</p><p>“Pansy gets your clothes on and rides the rest of the way with Urquhart. I need to talk to Nicole.” He slams the compartment door shut. He helped me get into a carriage and got in after. We sat on opposite sides. “What you did on the train was cute but…” He was saying, but I cut him off.</p><p>“I won,” I smile.</p><p>“You didn't win,” He snaps.                                </p><p>“I did, I turned Urquhart on more than you did Pansy. We were both in our underwear and trust me I could feel how hard he was.” I explain.</p><p>“That’s not what this is about. You aren’t allowed to be giving other guys any ideas again.” He scolds me.</p><p>“Why, it's not like you’re loyal to me? Besides, you let the other girls do whatever they want with other guys. Why am I being tied down?” I yell. All of Draco’s girls fool around with other guys. While the others did it to make him jealous, I did it out of spite. Sometimes, I would feel so used when I saw him with other girls that I felt the need to get even.</p><p>“Because you're different,” He snaps.</p><p>“How,” I ask. I have been waiting a long time to hear that, but I know Draco Malfoy. So, I knew to never get my hopes up.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that. What you need to do is start worrying about the future? No one is going to want you as a wife if you have been with everyone.” He lectures me.</p><p>“Isn’t that a bit hypocritical coming from you?” I gasp, not believing the words that were coming out of his mouth.</p><p>“There are double standards in life, honey. Don’t you want to be the girl I pick in the end? I can’t do that if you’ve been with other guys. I will not have men knowing what it's like to be with my wife.” He tries to run his hand through my hair, but I move my head.</p><p>“When does the double standard stop? Will you still have other girls if we are married?” I question him. It was this thought that made me wonder if I even wanted to be the girl he picks in the end. It was one thing for my sort-of boyfriend to have other girlfriends. It was another for my husband to have mistresses. </p><p>“For your information, I plan to be a good husband, that’s why I’m getting it all out now.” He snaps as if it was so insulting for me to think he would be a cheating husband.</p><p>“Since when do you care about the future anyway,” I wonder where this was coming from.</p><p>“Because this is my last year, I’m so glad that I’m never coming back to this stupid place.” He growls, glaring out the window at the castle.</p><p>“What are you talking about? We have one more year after this.” I narrow my eyes at him.</p><p>“Just listen, you will not be fooling around with other guys. I will make sure of it.” He hisses.</p><p>“I did win the game.” I want to change the subject because it didn’t seem like he would be seeing things from my perspective.</p><p>“Whatever helps you sleep at night,” He rolls his eyes.</p><p> </p>
