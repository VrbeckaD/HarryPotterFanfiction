    <p>“GIRL! GIRL are you well enough to do your chores? Answer me bloody freak.” Vernon unlocked the five locks holding the cupboard door closed and yanked the door open peering in before cursing the girl and locking Harry back in. Harry was curled into a ball, a sheen of sweat covered him and yet he still shivered. Fever wracked his little form; infection having set in across the many new wounds on his back. The blood-covered pathetic excuse of a blanket covering his privates which was bleeding again because Uncle Vernon. All he had asked was for a little food…so starved…almost passed out making stupid Dudders’ breakfast…so thirsty...</p><p> Harry lay there in silence, his hearing gone almost 8 years ago now. Multiple untreated ear infections, on top of the many beatings to the head after the bad thing had left him completely deaf because he fought back by screaming out his vocal cords. Sadly, his vocal cords were ruined from that point on. He had adapted though. Mainly be learning to read lips and maintain perfect speech to avoid beatings and the bad thing that Uncle Vernon did. When he was allowed to go to the library, he snuck away to learn both BSL and ASL from the nice deaf librarian who had died due to brain cancer earlier that year, despite being only 23 years old. The librarian had been kind enough to give him a pair of reading glasses since it was better than nothing which often is true about life. The librarian’s name was Ross, at least that’s what Harry thought. Ross had cared enough to give him simple foods like apples and cough medicine over the years saying folks like us got to stick together. </p><p>“I wish I was dead; I wish I was dead, but I don’t want to die.”</p><p>Over and over, like a mantra. Harry felt his remaining energy slowly begin to fade out.<br/>“Help me” his mind screamed to the unknown darkness of his cupboard, and yet his own magic heard him. Then, sweet nothingness that only occurs when one passes out.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile at Gringotts,  a young goblin named Thrasher was growling at how the heck did Dumbledore even managed to misplace all of Hogwarts annual audit files again for this upcoming school year as he tried to find his desk from under the mountains of paperwork. When the crack of apparation sounded, Thrasher whirled around to see a wizard youngling covered with only a bloody blanket (no pun intended). </p><p>He called out “yes, child?” No response. He sighed, then begin the diagnostic spell, swearing that this was great considering that he needed to do something other than dying of boredom. It soon turned to horror as he realized that it was the The-Girl-Who-Lived lying unconscious at the entranceway of his office. </p><p>Diagnostic Report for Harriet Jasmine Potter<br/>Year one: cold, flu, killing curse, 1 fever, <br/>Year two: broken arms twice, broken hands thrice, 8 ear infections<br/>Year three: broken ribs, broken pelvis due to rape, vocal cords shot, 4 concussions, 6 ear infections<br/>Year four: broken arms twice, broken hands thrice, 8 ear infections, 3 rapes, 3 fevers<br/>Year five: broken arms, broken legs, vaginal tearing, anal tearing, 5 fevers<br/>Year six: broken ribs, 8 ear infections, 5 concussions, 2 fevers<br/>Year seven: broken arms, broken legs, vaginal tearing, anal tearing<br/>Year eight: broken arms twice, broken hands thrice, 8 ear infections, one miscarraige<br/>Year nine: current concussion, broken pelvis due to rape, fever</p><p>Thrasher immediately floo-calls Grene, the current goblin healer who was in right now. <br/>					~~~~<br/>Grene was going to kill whomever hurt this sweet child who looked like a four-year-old was actually nine years old. She growled at the fact that the little girl had been raped – on the bright side, the idiot’s DNA was still all over the girl’s privates. She then started the process of applying her magic to this little raven who should’ve been carefree and happily playing outside on a broomstick instead of almost dying. She sighed then finished the report, sending a copy to Griphook who had been trying to locate the wills of the Potters as well as Rita Skeeter.</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>Thrasher summoned Griphook, his mentor who was equally as pissed off as Thrasher was. Griphook was concerned by what he’d found out about Vernon Dursley – a complete alias for Eugene Waterson, a squib ironically. He was a serial child rapist and murderer whose warrant was 20-year-old cold case consisting of 12 muggle children as well as 10 squib children and 17 wizard children. Griphook grimaced as he remembered the charred reports of how Waterson would always taunt by leaving a cross necklace around his victims that were found. </p><p>Thrasher, who never even thought about how lucky the little raven was, was glad that no one would bother looking for Harry till she was 11. Since they, the goblins would raise her – but under an alias while Rita Skeeter would “discover” that The-Girl-Who-Lived had died because of Eugene Waterson himself and unsealing the wills to reveal what the wills said.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>Rita Skeeter was not new to Gringotts needing her (oh sweet joy to know that she was finally a she!), she knew that Grene wasn’t one to beat around the bush. Grene greeted Rita with a grimace as she revealed what had happened to The-Girl-Who-Lived. Rita was livid as she knew exactly due to her “parents” who had had forced her through conversion therapy because of her being a gay trans woman.</p><p>She despised Dumbledore who had dared to claim that conversion therapy didn’t count as child abuse, since child abuse didn’t exist since all parents love their children. </p><p>Grene kissed Rita’s cheek and sighed, mentally bracing herself for the conversation that was about to occur.</p><p>“So, you’re telling me that Harriet Potter showed up covered in blood?” Rita asked in disbelief.<br/>“Unfortunately, yes – would you mind doing a cover-up for us, lovey?” Grene slyly suggested.<br/>Rita grinned and then began writing the article bullet points when she stopped and stared at Grene.</p><p>“Wait – Harriet Potter was put WITH EUGENE WATERSON?!” Rita yelled in horror and shock.<br/>“Are you in – do you want Dumbledore to go down for it?” Grene replied.<br/>“Hell yes!” Rita snarled as she continued writing the other bullet points, she hated Dumbledore more than ever.   </p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Who wouldn't think of him as a disgusting little whore for that?<br/>Who would look at him the same way if they knew every disgusting detail of what he'd done? Of bartering his body for basic things like toothpaste and food? A radio, so that he wouldn't lose his mind from loneliness. Praying every night for a miscarriage so that he would not have to give birth by himself in that lonely little room, or, worse, nearly killing himself by shoving implements into his vagina in an attempt to perform an abortion when he couldn't find any bleach to drink? Watching Uncle Vernon, being unable to help the other now-deceased children, as he forced Harry to view videos of Vernon raping and murdering young boys before he had buried them under the flower beds of his nice, normal little home with a good housewife and son? He thought sadly while floating in the darkness.</p><p> The better question was does he want to wake up or go to sleep and never wake up in pain?</p><p>He remembered the first time he started his monthlies – Uncle Vernon had been furious that he had reached puberty at eight years old. It was terrifying when he realized that he could be killed on a mere whim just because he could carry a child. The basement was worse than his cupboard. It wasn't just small, but dark and dank. No light could penetrate it, and Harry had to feel his way to his bucket to relieve himself. Uncle Vernon had put him in here because he refused to help— no – outright refused to be raped. He made Harry pay for it in blood…the tiny pinch that had been the placenta attached to the stillborn baby whose tiny features were perfectly formed. </p><p>He hears people talking softly about how she had had a miscarriage at only eight years old. He realized that no one knew that he was a boy – even though, they would hurt him because he wasn’t supposed to be a boy but a girl since he was really a she. </p><p>He opens his eyes to a pretty lady with short blonde hair and a amazon-looking woman with fiery red hair.</p><p>“Harry, I am sorry. No one here will ever hurt you or get mad at you. You never deserve to be beaten or yelled at no matter what happens, Harriet” Grene states softly, knowing that the child had been listening for the last ten minutes – give or take.  This time she  notice as Harriet flinches at the name. Harry nods and happily yet shyly smiles. Wow…maybe they do care, maybe...maybe its ok to ask?  He wonders. Grene sees the pensive look on the young child’s face. “It’s ok little one, anything you need to ask or say just let it out,” Rita says while smiling. Harry nods  then signs I..I hate the name Harriet and I hate being a girl. Then he looks away scared of what these people are going to think. “They’re gonna call me a freak just like...him” he thinks sadly.<br/> The couple look at each other taking in this unexpected news, but nod to each other, Rita taking initiative. “Ok little raven, then what would make you happy. What can we do to help.” Looking astonished that they weren’t shunning him or even calling him freak, he stares at both of them. He signs “I know I’m a boy, and I like the name Harry James.” “Ok Harry, we are going to do everything we can to help you, ok? Do you think you could meet some more people who really love you and want to meet you?” Harry looks nervous but nods, then looks at them in distress since he doesn’t know them.<br/>“Oh, where are my manners? My name is Rita,” Rita exclaims, chuckling at Grene who was rolling her eyes at Rita then stared up at the ceiling.<br/>“My name is Grene – do you know where you are right now?” Grene asked.<br/>“Seriously, I highly doubt that he would even know where Gringotts is, let alone what Gringotts is,” Rita mutters.<br/> “What’s Gringotts?” he signs then realized that Rita was biting her lip, trying not snort and looking at the door.<br/>“THRASHER AND GRIPHOOK!!! QUIT LURKING AND GET IN HERE!!!” Grene yells, looking right at the partially closed door where Thrasher and Griphook sheepishly come in.<br/>Thrasher then signs “Hello Harry, are you feeling any better?”<br/>“What’s your name?” Harry signs back before shrugging, not sure what he felt right now.<br/>Thrasher laughs then signs “Thrasher and the man beside me is Griphook.”<br/>Griphook smacks Thrasher upside the head, scowling at Thrasher who began rubbing the back of his head. He then looks at Harry.  Harry signs “ He’s an idiot, isn’t he?” nodding to Thrasher who pouts.<br/>Griphook then sighs. “Why not break down the old man in the public’s eye before putting him on trial, Harry?”<br/>Harry’s stomach growls and he blushes at how hungry he is. Grene mutters “I’ll be giving Lucius a call to be the barrister but under a vow….but I will be using the pure magic ritual to fully heal him,”<br/>“What do you mean, the pure magic ritual to fully heal him? Why not potions?” Thrasher asked, concerned about what Grene was implying about.<br/>“More importantly, why Lucius? He wouldn’t care – wait, he’s the one you told about being transgender, never mind,” Thrasher said.<br/>Rita nodded then sighed “If I had come out earlier, I would’ve been killed by Sarai and Absalom.”</p>
