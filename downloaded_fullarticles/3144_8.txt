    <p>Laborious Sirius Black slowly tried to pull his long sleeved sweater over his head. About when the thight fabric nudge his abs, he howled and shudder vigorously. For several minutes Padfoot sat on his bed, trembeling trying not to nudge his bruises and open wounds.</p><p>   ” Hey Pads. What is taking you so long? Dumbledore is about to gives his speach.” </p><p>  Moony smirked, when he entres the Gryffindor boys doorm. Padfoot turned around.</p><p>   ” Oh hi Moons. I am just. This stuid sweater is to small. I got Regulus old, and can not get it off.”  </p><p>  Coyed Remus sad opposite to him. His other wise pale skin blushing in bright pink.</p><p>   ” Well we can’t have that. Can we?” </p><p>   ” No wait I...”</p><p>  Quickly Lupin tried to yank it off, and his friend yield. So he stopped terrified.</p><p>   ” Merlin, Sirius! What happend to your back?!” </p><p>  The 16 year old boy tried to act normal and span around cherfully.</p><p>   ” Oh that? Just a scratch. It happend when I tried to do that muggle sport you always talked about. That one on the ice. I just landed on my back. Smooth boyfriend you got right?” </p><p>  Just one look from his ocean blue eyes, and Sirius knew he was not buying it. Remus Lupin could always see through his charade. Behind the little smirked. Reading him like a open book.</p><p>   ” Sirius. Did...did somebody hurt you?”</p><p>  His boyfriend gently stroke several old scar on his spine. So tenderly and soft he moved them, that Sirius curled up like a child.</p><p>   ” Nnnno...”</p><p>  So sadly he meet the hazelbrown eyes, who tear up and silently fell down his mouth.</p><p>   ” Please Padfoot.”</p><p>  By his nickname he broke down in heavy sobs.</p><p>   ” Moo...Moony.” </p><p>   ” Come. It is going to be okay. I am here.”</p><p>  The young Black boy burried in Lupins soft, warm, and familiar knitted sweater. It was a safe place in a else dark world.</p><p>   ” Hhhold me...please my Moony.” </p><p>  So he did. Remus wrapped his arm around Sirius waist, and played with his messy black hair.</p><p>   ” Cry it out. It is okay. You are not weak for crying.” He mumbled in his hair, and closed his eyes.</p><p>  A very long time Sirius tried to resist it. Remembering his father many lections about showing yourself vulnerable. When he heard Remus very soft cloudly voice against his sweaty hair, he could not hold it back anymore. So he cried loudly, and shoke, and grabbed Lupins sweater, util his knuckles turned white.</p><p>  When finally Sirius looked up his eyes was swollen and red.</p><p>   ” It was my father.” The boy pulled away and sat straight up, so he could talk directly to him. ” Regulus talked to me about his new boyfriend, who is muggleborn. So I just started to talk about you. My father heard it all and...”</p><p>   ” He beat you?”</p><p>  He noded soothing, drawing small circles around Moonys scar, inside his wrist.</p><p>   ” Yeah. Me and Reg. So that is why you did not saw me on the train, and by the cermony. Reg and I talked alot in a own carriage. About it all. He almost refuse to let me change alone.”</p><p>   ” I am glad you told me. I am so sorry it happed to you. You are so brave. Just...tell me how to help you.” </p><p>  Big eyed he looked at him.</p><p>   ” Just touch me.”</p><p>  So gently and slowly he burried his fingers in his dark hair. They then travel to the curve of his neck. When he stroke the shoulder a soft moon ecape Sirius lips.</p><p>   ” Is this good?” </p><p>   ” Yes...more...”</p><p> Aroused Lupin nudge his fingertips on his stomach, as he tried to hide how he was panting heavy. Sirius did not know when he closed his eyes, but he flicked them open, when he heard his boyfriend let out a tiny moan. Both of them looked at eachother wide eyed.</p><p>  Like a beat of a drum it began. Padfoot fiery layed over Moony, and suck on his earlobe.</p><p>   ” Ohhh...Padfoot...do not stop...” </p><p>  So lightly he bit it, and groaned dark.</p><p>   ” Why would I do that?”</p><p>  Moony orgasm of his deep voice and rubbed his cock warm at Padfoots. </p><p>   ” Ohh Merlin...it feels so good...</p><p>  More and more he hump up so his cock throb under his boxershort. Aroused Padfoot, yank up Moony pants and rubbed the area hot.</p><p>   ” Moony. It so big.”</p><p>  Moony blushed, and undo his bottons to. Very softly and trying he ran his hand inside the boxershorts.</p><p>   ” Mmm you to.” </p><p>  Bubbly Padfoot giggled.</p><p>   ” Liar. It is so tiny.”</p><p>  Moony looked on his boyfriend. Padfoots sweaty and messy hair who stood out everywhere and around the brown eyes it was red and swollen.</p><p>   ” I love you.”</p><p>  So soft Lupin could bearly hear it Sirius whisper out.</p><p>   ” I love you to.”</p><p>  Heated they rubbed eachother and cum like one. After it they cuddle airy. Lupins dimple came up, when he said.</p><p>   ” So. It was the first time we...you know.” </p><p>   ” Said I love you? Did get handjobs?” Padfoot smirked, and stroke his nose on Moonys. A small growl came from his belly, and Moony smirking sat up.</p><p>   ” It was. Come on. We should clean up and go get you some food.” </p><p>  Happily he let his boyfriend pulled of his sweater very sweetly, and pulled on one of his own knitted one.</p><p>   ” Good. I am starving.”</p>
