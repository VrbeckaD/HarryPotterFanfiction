    <p>The thing is, Merlin doesn’t know how old he is, doesn’t remember the world that he was born into, doesn’t remember the faces of those he knew in his childhood. He’s sure he’s even forgotten what his mother truly looked like, her face just something he has imagined when he tries to think of her, and he doesn’t think of her often. He remembers his stepfather, but he’s certain that has more do with the fact his stepfather was the first person he ever killed and you’re supposed to remember your first.</p><p>Everywhere he goes in his life, there is one soul that he finds over and over again. One soul that is the same soul, returned to life, endlessly. Of course, he doesn’t <em>really</em> take much notice of them, outside the odd fling, until the 5<sup>th</sup> century, when he <em>accidentally</em> helps them draw a sword from a stone and they’re pronounced the Once and Future King, which… <em>Mundanes. </em>Honestly.</p><p>Arthur is a great deal more exciting to talk to than Esther had been, but unlike Esther and all those before them, Arthur, bless him, can’t figure out why he keeps eyeing him up and down whenever opportunity is granted to him. It drives Merlin <em>mad. </em>Though, he supposes he can’t really blame the man, mundanes have become exceptionally small minded since the last time he bothered to take any interest in their affairs. Burn this witch at the stake and hang that one. This man slept with that man, so they must both die. It’s <em>exhausting</em>. But Arthur is... possibly worth the exhaustion.</p><p>Then dearest Guinevere enters the scene and Merlin gracefully bows out...</p><p>And pines from a distance.</p>
<hr/><p>Merlin wonders if he’s made a mistake, when it reaches the turn of the millennia and that beautiful, wonderful, vibrant soul hasn’t been reborn, and he’s <em>looked. </em>Well, he has better things to do, he eventually decides, when the world is <em>slowly </em>beginning to become more civilized or, at the very least, less prone to savagery at the drop of any old hat.</p><p>He does miss the old, old days, when no one cared who slept with who, or who kept whose company. At the very least, he’s relieved he’ll never have to deal with the problem of leaving bastards in every port. Although, he is very generous whenever a young woman comes to him, claiming he’s the father of their child. He knows he isn’t, but what’s it really going to hurt him to set those children up for life?</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Eventually, the name Merlin Emrys outlives its usefulness, as all the names before it had, so he teaches himself to answer to a new one, until eventually Magnus Bane rolls off the tongue like it was the name he was born with. It’s not, he doesn’t remember that name.</p>
<hr/><p>When it has been a thousand years since he last encountered that beautiful soul, he wonders if Arthur was the last. If whatever task, whatever duty he’d had here on this Earth was completed and his soul was free to rest. Magnus wonders what that feels like, <em>rest</em>. He’s been wearied of soul for centuries. He’s heard the mundanes talk of a ‘bone-weariness’ but his is soul-weariness. He sleeps but wakes just as tired, the years flow past him, sometimes he bothers to take note, but mostly he just exists outside of them. He just is, and maybe that's the saddest thing he has ever thought.</p><p>He thinks perhaps that’s why they have Nephilim once more amongst them. Though not as powerful as their predecessors, these Nephilim have all their same egos. He wonders if they exist now because those his age have become tired, so weary they can no longer see the point in battling back against the demons, can no longer see the point in protecting this world. Perhaps it is time for them to pass the torch, but it should have gone to the youngsters of their kind, rather than bring back the scourge that is the Nephilim. They were eradicated for a <em>reason</em>. </p><p>Of course, not even the Nephilim managed to do a good enough job of things, since now vampires and werewolves walk the Earth, but perhaps it is time for a new Downworld.</p>
<hr/><p>It’s been so long, that when the soul finally comes back into his vicinity it takes him off guard, he doesn’t recognize them. Not until later, when he’s managed to have a conversation with the new Arthur, who is not an Arthur at all, but an Alexander. He’s a Shadowhunter, too, just to make things <em>exciting.</em> Maybe in the next run, he’ll be a warlock or a seelie, Magnus isn’t really sure how they’ve managed to dodge becoming an immortal for so long.</p><p>Arthur, who is actually Alexander, is truly Arthur reborn, the same foolish recklessness, the same overwhelming courage, the same bullheadedness, the same rigid adherence for rules that others have set, unless he realizes that they do not serve those that he cares for, then he is the first in line to break them. Magnus wishes, for the first time, he’d paid more attention to the earlier lives, wants to know if the soul has always been this way. He thinks that it probably has.</p><p>Like Arthur before him, Alexander seems incapable of acknowledging what he feels for Magnus. Magnus decides he’s not going to suffer that again, going through it with Arthur was enough. He decides he will bow out, gracefully, and let Lydia have what she has claimed as her own, even if only for duty. He did it for Guinevere, for all the good that came of it, he can do it for Lydia.</p><p>Then stupid, dumb, Ragnor gets himself killed, <em>again, </em>and even though Magnus <em>knows </em>the idiot will be back in a year or two, he still conjures up his ghost. Still listens to what his ghost has to tell him, because Ragnor really has always had the best advice, even if Magnus tends not to abide by it.</p><p>So, he bursts into the wedding and hopes that he’s not making the worst mistake of the century. Lydia, unlike sweet Guin before her, gives Alexander up without a fight, absolves him of any duty to her and encourages him forward. Magnus is absolutely certain the heart is not meant to swell until it feels like it might burst, but that’s what happens when Alexander finally kisses him.</p><p>He feels like he has come home and he doesn’t know why.</p>
<hr/><p>He wonders at the power behind the Agony Rune, a rune so strong it can bring up memories that he has long forgotten. He is older than the entire Nephilim order, lived during the period when the original Nephilim walked the Earth, so how much power must that rune have to bring up memories so old? He doesn’t know if he really wants an answer.</p>
