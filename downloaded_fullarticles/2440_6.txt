    <p>Nico didn’t <em>really </em>want to be friends with the blonde boy. He was annoying and his clothes were too bright, voice too loud; always playing hero with an obnoxious smile plastered over his stupid face,</p><p>Nico had watched him from the curtains of his ink black hair, letting his younger sister, Hazel, fuss with his robes as his slightly older friends shoved each other around; mouths twisted in smiles.</p><p>He was alone. The blonde boy.</p><p>The older man beside him, his father, probably, seemed more interested in himself. The boy didn’t seem to mind. His hair was as blonde as sand and his shirt was too big and too orange and his eyes were, <em>very</em>, blue; indescribable, unique. <em>Annoyingly </em>unique.</p><p>“Neeks?” Jason pestered, Gryffindor scarf covering the scar on his lips, “Who’re you looking at?”</p><p>Nico didn’t particularly care enough to let his friend invest in an unrealistic love story that didn’t exist, so he shrugged in response, waving Hazel off as she began smoothing down his uneven waves of hair, “Nobody,” he mumbled,</p><p>“Are you excited?” Jason prompted, Nico shot him off with a look; of <em>course </em>he was excited, a home that was finally to be <em>his</em>, a <em>home.</em> He would have ignored the older boy further still if not for the pouty eyes and eager smile,</p><p>And so Nico lost sight of blonde curls and a white smile.</p>
