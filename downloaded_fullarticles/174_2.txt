    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>We drove over the River Coquet, passed Wood Hall Farm on our way
back to the Harbottle and just behind the hamlet, the road went
down the hill through sparse forest. It was already dark, and
James slowed down a little bit and perhaps that was what saved
us. A large ball of blue light flew from behind one tree and hit
our bike. When it touched the frame of it, a huge explosion tore
the bike in two pieces and we both were thrown to the ground. My
helmet saved my head, but unfortunately when falling my hand got
underneath me and I heard a loud crack touching the ground.
Moreover, while flying towards the side of the road, I hit some
piece of metal with my other hand, which went right through my
leather biking jacket and made the large slash in my arm.</p>
<p>Strong pain was all over me and I found myself lying on the
ground, crying. All my strength of will was suddenly gone and
I remember the rest of that part of the evening just in a haze,
most of what I know about what happened is what later James told
me. He pulled out his wand and started to fire curses to the dark
trees around us. Nobody replied for a moment, so he decided that
the best thing is to transport me to safety. He grabbed me to his
arms and just seconds later I felt something shocking even
through all pain I was in. I felt squeezed as if I was lying
under a road roller. I thought something hit us, and I was certain it
was my last moment because there was no way how I could survive
it, but surprisingly it got better, and we were standing in the
yard in front of James’ old house, Drakeshaugh. My eyes could
persuade me that I was alive, but my stomach was of another
opinion, and suddenly all the lovely kidney pie dinner we had in
a pub by the road was flying out me straight to the ground.
I remember idiotically, how in the middle of all the pain and
craziness I felt for a couple of minutes most sorry for such
a lovely dinner to be wasted.</p>
<p>James kept me all the time in his arms and when I finished
heaving, he led me inside. We ended up in the kitchen, sitting on
two high stools behind the bar in the middle of the room against
each other. I was still in my pain-induced haze and so I was just
sitting half-collapsed on the bar and just half-following
whatever James was doing. I was a bit shocked when he pulled out
his wand, wave with it, said something, and suddenly my broken
hand went completely stiff, and I couldn’t move it at all. The
pleasant part was that it didn’t hurt any-more, but still, it
felt weird and I couldn’t stop myself from raising my opinion.</p>
<p>“What the fuck did you do? What the hell is going on?”</p>
<p>James was suddenly smiling at me.</p>
<p>“I am glad, Annie, you are swearing again. That’s a good sign!
Sorry, the side-along apparition is horribly uncomfortable for
the first time. I needed to get you out of there as soon as
possible, there may be still somebody waiting on us, and I was
not sure I could defend you. And you need healing assistance as
well. I have to call my parents, but before that, we need to
talk.</p>
<p>I am really sorry, Annie, I didn’t want it to happen this way,
and I swear that it is not just because of the circumstances,
I was preparing to ask you for a long time, but I am coward and
I couldn’t find a proper situation.”</p>
<p>I was so out of it; I couldn’t understand what he was talking
about.</p>
<p>“What the hell you are talking about? I need you to call the
ambulance and not just some fucking talking! Could you fetch
somebody, <em>please</em>?”</p>
<p>The last word was not polite but a shouted demand.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Annie, but that’s exactly what I am working for. Before
we can ask for help, I have to ask you something. Please, focus
for a moment and trust me. This is not a joke, and I have to do
it right now, but you are a law student, you understand that
sometime niceties must be observed.”</p>
<p>I still did not understand what’s going on, until he, dirty,
battered and probably slightly wounded himself as well, knelt on
one knee in front of my barstool. It was weird, because the stool
was so high that I was looking at the top of his head, and then
when he turned to me, he was looking up, which felt weird for
such tall man. However, even though all my anger and pain I saw
in his hazel eyes only sincerity and concern.</p>
<p>“Annabel May Charlton, I know that this is not the right place or
right time, but I am absolutely sincere when asking you whether
you would make me the biggest honour and agree to be my wife. Not
today, or necessarily not soon, we can plan for whatever we
decide is best for us. And yes, engagement can be broken, but
would you agree that at this moment you want to marry me some
time later, and be my wife for the rest of our lives?”</p>
<p>“What the fucking hell? You decide to pop the question when I am
in this state here in your parents’ kitchen! What the …”</p>
<p>And then it suddenly hit me, he mentioned something about the
legal niceties and calling his parents. And I saw how his eyes
were hit by even more pain and anguish than I can bear.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Jamie, I didn’t want to swear at you after the
question, but what in the world is going on?”</p>
<p>His eyes were even sadder than before, but he was firm.</p>
<p>“I am really sorry, Annie, but I really mustn’t tell you much
more. This is so awful situation, and I am really not trying to
force the good answer from you. If you want to break up, or if
you don’t feel ready yet, I will certainly take care of you
another way, but it would be a way easier if we get through this
well.</p>
<p>Please, trust me, and try to forget for a moment about the
situation, about this dirt, and concentrate on what you really
want.”</p>
<p>My first reaction was to be annoyed with him. What the hell he
was thinking! I am bruised, I have broken hand, a large gash on
the other one, I am dirty, freaking out, and he asks me The
Question! What the fuck!</p>
<p>However, then finally in the middle of all soreness and
confusion, my legal brain started to work as well. Why one has to
ask the question? To change their legal status, of course.
Usually, because bride-to-be is pregnant. Well, that was not an
issue, I knew. After James declined my offer of sleeping together
because he felt too many secrets stood as a wall between us, we
somehow never really revisited the issue, and I felt so
comfortable with him, that I have let it be resolved somehow on
its own eventually. A mild wave of panic run through me. Do
I consider him a homely return to my roots and isn’t he just
a family friend in my heart? Are we doomed to have the sibling’s
relationship without any passion? I looked at James kneeling in
front of me and I immediately knew that’s not the case. Suddenly,
I was sorely tempted to say yes just so that we can celebrate the
whole night.</p>
<p>I dismissed this thought and returned back to contemplating what
exactly I feel about James. Being with him was being in peace,
with him I was able to be who I am, and I did not feel the need
to work too hard, because he was just naturally part of my life.
James was my home. When I looked around myself in the Drakeshaugh
kitchen, I was suddenly overcome by the strong feeling of return
back. And I also immediately knew how I might have spent almost
two years chasing Simon, who for anybody who knew me was
obviously completely wrong for me. Getting to a good university
in a big city and studying something so prestigious as the law
was a big achievement for a girl from a small village somewhere
in the middle of sheep and marshes. It was very easy to get into
conviction, that I have to hide my background and tried to fit
into the town world and pretend to be part of that new world.
I was so much used to that pretension that I have not even
recognized how much I tried to make myself into a different girl
to be acceptable for Simon. I suddenly felt incredibly fatigued
from all that effort. There was no need for pretension with
James. I didn’t have to have a different set of clothes,
different entertainment, different life to be good enough for
him. I could just relax. If I chose to have special clothes or do
something different, he appreciated it, but it was just for our
enjoyment, it was not required. It smelled like the freedom to
me.</p>
<p>When I got there with my thoughts, my first reaction was fear.
Yes, the idea of returning back home was very tempting, but
wouldn’t I lose all that I have attained by my hard work so far?
I took another look at James who was patiently still waiting
until I finish the struggle with my thoughts. And I knew, that
saying yes wouldn’t be yet another pretence or yet another
sacrifice for getting a boy. My home was not a place, it was
a person, the one kneeling in front of me. James would never stop
me from getting my best, he would always support me. And I would
finally have somebody who would like to search for our common
best, not only looking for himself. It felt like cheating because
the answer to this life question should be difficult and hard to
find, but it wasn’t. Yes, his presence in my life now was so
embarrassingly natural, that I finally recognized that he was the
big missing part of my life until I met him in Sheffield. It was
just too obvious.</p>
<p>“Of course, the answer is yes, you idiot. What else it could be?
And yes, we need to talk about planning, because I am by far not
ready to start a family now. I want to finish school, start my
career and all that stuff, but of course, the answer is yes.
Could you explain to me now, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>He embraced me very gently, but it was the moment when I felt
like maybe exactly those crazy circumstances were worthy just for
this embrace. I was suddenly certain I have his arms where I can
completely fall apart and not be strong and be real. I started to
cry in relief. What the hell is going on with me, that I am such
a cry-baby? However, the day was such emotional roller-coaster,
and all fear, pain, and excitement suddenly went over me so much,
that despite everything I just wanted to stay hidden in his arms.</p>
<p>James shuffled other stool to be next to mine, sat on it while
still keeping me in his arms. I laid myself on his knees while he
started to explain.</p>
<p>“You know, Annie, wow, my Annie, … sorry, back to the topic, you
know that there are secrets, and rules forbidding me to disclose
those secrets to anybody outside. You are smart girl and lawyer,
so I guess you have already figured out that I have got in
conflicts with those rules in a big way, and that it led to my
falling apart with my father, who is a law officer of a kind.</p>
<p>Well, the rules prohibiting wizards and witches from revealing
the secret to Muggles were here for a long time, but for the same
time, there were wizards and witches still falling in love with
Muggles. Traditionally the magical spouses revealed the secret to
their Muggle partner on their wedding night, but that was just
too weird, and the Muggle spouse rightly felt betrayed and
swindled into marriage by dishonesty. So, embarrassingly only
a few years ago they eased the rule a little bit, that it is
possible to reveal the truth even to fiancée. There is some level
of commitment presented, but at least the Muggle spouse can still
break the engagement if they cannot get over the existence of the
magical world, or they are not willing to submit to the
International Statute of Secrecy. Their memory would be modified,
of course, but it felt like the best compromise available.</p>
<p>The rest is simple. I need to talk to my father about the ambush,
well, I could talk to any Auror, but I think my Dad would be
rightly offended if I talked with anybody else, and my mum was
the professional Quidditch player for years, so she is really
good in the healing magic of broken limbs and bruises. So,
I really need them here, and I combined pleasure with the
necessity when asking you the question.”</p>
<p>And then we finally kissed one another. It was just a brief kiss
because my hand was now truly in pain, but I just did not want to
skip this part over. And the kiss was a promise of so many more
times together, much more pleasant than this one.</p>
<p>While I was still leaning in him, it took me just a second before
my poor brain got really in the action again and I found
a problem.</p>
<p>“Wait, so that works for me, but what about my parents and Henry?
Is this the reason why your parents separated from us? Mine never
talked about it, but I am sure my Mum was hurt a lot when she
lost Aunt Ginny as a friend.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know, and my mum was broken about it all the time, and
no, our engagement doesn’t cover it. While you are in, it
follows, you cannot tell anybody, and I mean anybody, who is
outside. Your memory would get erased of everything related to
magic, me included, and I would go to a very unpleasant magical
jail for a long time, perhaps for life.”</p>
<p>“Yikes!”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. Concerning your parents and Henry, we probably can
find a way now, with us being engaged, but we need my Dad for it,
and it will take some time. I really should contact my parents
now.”</p>
<p>He gently unrolled me from his embrace and let me just lean
against the bar, and jumped down from the stool. I saw him when
he went to the next large sitting room and kneeled down in front
of the large fireplace, which was there.</p>
<p>“I know, I could call them by the mirror, but they will need
a Floo working anyway, and at least we will know that the
fireplace is still connected.</p>
<p>Look, Annie, this is one useful spell.”</p>
<p>And he pointed his wands towards the fireplace with some large
blocks of wood and shouted “<em>Incendio!</em>”. Suddenly, all wood was
lit, not by fire slowly growing up, but it was a full blaze at
once. Then he pulled a large jar from the mantle of the fireplace
and took a pinch of green powder from it, thrown it to the fire,
and cried.</p>
<p>“Common Piece in Sutton!”</p>
<p>Flames turned green, and now he called in a normal voice.</p>
<p>“Mum, Dad?”</p>
<p>I remembered about magic from my childhood, and I just saw lighting up large logs by
magic, but still, it was unnerving when I heard the voice of the
Uncle Harry from the fireplace.</p>
<p>“James? Where are you?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Dad. In Drakeshaugh. I would need both you and Mum here. It
is an emergency, could you come, please?”</p>
<p>I heard much more quietly like from larger distance “Ginny, come
here, James needs us in Drakeshaugh.” and then only a second
later Uncle Harry jumped out of the fireplace with his wand
drawn.</p>
<p>He scanned his surroundings and when he saw me, his concentration
turned to anger.</p>
<p>“James! What she is doing here?”</p>
<p>He started to point his wand at me.</p>
<p>“Dad, stop! It is all right, we just got engaged, I haven’t
broken any law.”</p>
<p>“Engaged? Do you understand that it must be a sincere commitment,
not just a sham engagement?”</p>
<p>That made me angry. I jumped down from the stool prepared to
shout at my father-in-law-to-be, but then I immediately stopped
swearing how the pain hit me. Which was even better, because that
was the moment when my mother-in-law-to-be just came through the
fireplace, so she heard some rather creative words I used. She,
however, was completely unfazed.</p>
<p>“Hello, Anna! Hello, James, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“First of all, Mum, Dad, let me reintroduce you to my fiancée,
Annabel May Charlton.”</p>
<p>The face of the Aunt Ginny lightened up.</p>
<p>“Oh, finally! Congratulations to both of you! Welcome to the
family, Anna!”</p>
<p>However, Uncle Harry was still suspicious.</p>
<p>“James? What’s going on? If talking about marriage is an
emergency, then I am afraid to ask.”</p>
<p>James immediately turned crimson red and I felt my embarrassment
had to show as well.</p>
<p>“No, Dad, nothing like that. I am afraid, this is a case for you.
We were driving a bike to come here, to visit Annie’s parents,
and we passed the bridge over the River Coquet, somebody attacked
us. The Reductor Curse straight to the middle of the bike.
I didn’t have a second to react to it. Annie got hurt, she has
a broken arm, and something else, and I didn’t know how much
danger we are in. So, I took her and apparated us here. I admit,
the situation probably sped up my asking the question, but I was
seriously contemplating it for some time, I have even the ring at
home, and she said yes.”</p>
<p>He was very tense when started to talk with his father, but I was
charmed when his face completely lit up when talking about me
saying yes. Aunt Ginny moved fast to me.</p>
<p>“Anna, which hand it is?”</p>
<p>“This one is broken, and the other one,” I have lifted up my
jumper and shown my hands, “has this gash on it. There was some
piece of metal sticking out of the crash barrier which cut me
pretty badly. James did something with that gash, but he was not
sure how to heal a broken limb well. It doesn’t hurt so much
any-more when I am not jumping from a stool. James immobilised it
by some spell.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but that is just a very temporary solution, I really need
to take a look at it.</p>
<p>Guys, Harry, shouldn’t you take a look at the place of crime?
I need to take a look at this and we don’t need any guys around
when Anna needs to take down her shirt.”</p>
<p>I was surprised when even adult Uncle Harry turned red
embarrassed, and James immediately took him by his arm, turned at
the spot, and both vanished with a loud crack.</p>
<p>Aunt Ginny looked around with a bit of disapproval to the thin
layer of dust which covered everything, but then she turned to
me.</p>
<p>“So, is there any pain right now?”</p>
<p>I have checked myself and decided at that very moment there is no
significant pain going on.</p>
<p>“I think the problem earlier was moving, when I am just standing
here, there is nothing in serious pain, but yes, I am bruised and
sore all over my body.”</p>
<p>She relaxed a bit, and then finally she really smiled again.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to Drakeshaugh, Anna. I am so glad to see you
again. You grew up in a lovely woman.</p>
<p>This will take a moment to fix you, and I would like to have us
more comfortable for that. And I am so glad, I can use charms in
front of you.”</p>
<p>With these words, she waved her wand once and suddenly all dust
around us disappeared. Another wave of the wand and a kettle on
the stove flew under the tap and filled itself with water. Then
it returned back and the water was boiling in a minute. She
looked at me cautiously and apologized.</p>
<p>“James told me how much you like good tea, so sorry, for your
return to Drakeshaugh I have only old Darjeeling, which I am
afraid is a bit stale.”</p>
<p>I felt like we will never get out of embarrassment this evening.</p>
<p>“Aunt Ginny, of course, I don’t know what James told you, but
I am not stupid. I would love to have a cuppa. And I am sure it
will be a lovely one. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Only when tea and some biscuits were on the bar, she asked me to
sit back on the stool. Pulling down the jacket and shirt which
were stuck with blood to my body was quite unpleasant, and doing
it that with one hand which cannot move well was even worse, but
we have managed. It felt strangely homely but weird when I was
sitting in the kitchen in front of my mother-in-law-to-be just in
my bra, but she was looking at me with a completely professional
attitude and waved with her wand first over a large gash on my
left hand. She was obviously happy with her findings, so she just
waved over it and spoke firmly “<em>Episkey!</em>” The wound immediately
closed and the hand was whole again.</p>
<p>“Wow! That is awesome! Can you do something with the broken hand
too?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, not that easily. I will conjure a splint over it,
and then you will get <em>Skele-gro</em>. It tastes horrible, but it
should help a lot. Sorry, it will be whole back only in the
morning!”</p>
<p>“What? Only in the morning? A day for a broken arm? That’s
unbelievable!”</p>
<p>She smiled a bit.</p>
<p>“Right, the Muggle way it would take longer, right? A day is the
best I can do.”</p>
<p>She turned to a cabinet above the stove and pulled out a small
bottle with white content. She filled a tablespoon of the very
thick liquid and hand the spoon to me.</p>
<p>“It really tastes horrible, just get it down and don’t think
about it.”</p>
<p>She was right, the whole thing smelled like a combination of
smelling socks and rotten vegetables, and I almost couldn’t
swallow it, but I focused my mind on tea standing in front of me,
and let the horrible liquid flow down my throat, followed by the
whole cup of tea just to wash away the horrible taste.</p>
<p>“It better be useful, because it is really horrible.</p>
<p>I should contact my parents; they will start to worry pretty
soon. They expect us for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Anna, remember you shouldn’t tell them anything about us being
here. Unfortunately, part of living on the frontier between the
magical and Muggle world as we live is that you have to be
prepared to have a cover story for all life situations. Yes, I am
asking you to learn to lie, but there is not much to do about it,
I am afraid. We should eventually be able to fix the situation
with your parents and Henry, I hope, but for others, yes, it
sucks.</p>
<p>You cannot explain to them even why we are suddenly back in the
Drakeshaugh without awkward problems. I swear, I will do whatever
possible to renew contact with them soon, I miss your Mum a lot,
but don’t put yourself in the trouble by talking about us now.
You had an accident on a bike, James took you here and gave you
first aid and fresh clothes. Don’t tell them the hand was broken,
because you cannot explain why it was fixed so soon. You will get
down to Lintzgarth in an hour.</p>
<p>And I should really get you some clean shirt. I will try to do
something about that jacket, but the shirt is so soaked in blood
and torn, that you should probably forget about it.”</p>
<p>I nodded and thought about what to tell my Mum. Then I pulled out
my phone and called her. The conversation went as expected, and
although I was tempted to mention the engagement, I decided not
to do anything about it without James present. She was concerned,
worried and excited in the right places, and she agreed that they
will wait for us in an hour. When I hanged up, Ginny came back
with a white shirt and a jumper.</p>
<p>“Bathroom with shower is down those stairs to the left, and
I have found this shirt, which Hermione left here some time ago;
she is slightly taller than me, so the shirt should fit better.
And I think this is old Lily’s jumper, so that should fit as
well. And don’t worry about the bandage, it can go under water.”</p>
<p>I went to the bathroom and was struck how suddenly a lot of
things made sense. Of course, all lights were turning on
automatically when I went to the particular room, like with
magic. Of course, the water in the shower was controlled by voice
(which was incredibly convenient).
I finally felt like I was allowed to enter a new hidden world
with a lot of miracles. I managed to do my shower even with just
one hand, but I haven’t found a hairdryer, and whatever I tried
to do with my trousers, they were still kind of dirty. I returned
to the kitchen clean, in much better shape than before, but not
completely ready to face my mum.</p>
<p>Ginny took just one look at me and started to apologize.</p>
<p>“Damn, I forgot, of course, I will dry your hair. There is
a charm for it.”</p>
<p>She waived with her wand in a strange pattern and suddenly all
dirt from the trousers vanished. Another swish and strong stream
of hot dry air lifted up my hair and made them dry in a minute.
However, she then rather firmly asked me to sit.</p>
<p>“Harry sent me a message that they will be back in ten minutes,
so we need to talk fast.”</p>
<p>I haven’t understood, but I lost a bit of composure from her
rather stern look at me. I felt like when my Mum wanted to scold
me.</p>
<p>“Anna, you were absolutely not surprised when we showed magic to
you. Please, be absolutely honest, and tell me: did James tell
you? Even if he broke the law, don’t cover for him, I need to
know, so we can agree what to tell Harry.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say. On the one hand as a law student,
I knew I need help to orient in the laws which were completely
unfamiliar to me, on the other hand, it felt too much like
a betrayal of James. How could I betray my fiancée not even an
hour in the engagement? My uncertainty was clearly obvious
because Ginny picked up on it.</p>
<p>“Anna, I am his mother. And after the mess they made with Harry
a couple of years ago, we just couldn’t afford another round of
it, I don’t think their relationship would survive. I couldn’t
lie to Harry, but I am certain I can persuade him not to ask
questions where he doesn’t want to hear the answers.”</p>
<p>This was so much Aunt Ginny I remembered. Fiercely protective of
her children, completely faithful to her husband, and yet able to
navigate the treacherous waters if these two loyalties got in
a conflict. I suddenly knew that I can trust her with James.</p>
<p>“Yes and no. No, James didn’t tell me anything since we’ve met in
Sheffield until I said ’yes’ here. He was actually very careful
not to say anything, even when it almost caused a fight between
us. Neither did other kids told us anything. However, yes, of
course, he and Rose and Al and Lily and Hugo told us with Henry
everything when we were kids. We were made forgotten everything
when we were … actually, that’s a matter of dispute among all of
us, when our memories were modified, but not that long after my
glorious eleventh birthday. However, when I met him, I started to
have really weird dreams about the things which were clearly
impossible. Try to imagine how did I feel, when one night out of
nothing, I, a perfectly normal girl, dreamed about myself being
tortured by a curse. Then more dreams came and then we’ve met,
all seven of us, we both with Henry remembered almost
everything.”</p>
<p>Ginny looked at me sharply.</p>
<p>“You dreamed what? Being tortured by a curse?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we were standing on the top of the Drakestone, looking for
someone, I didn’t know at the time who it was, and I was suddenly
hit by a curse, which made my whole body be in pain. Even in that
dream, it was something so horrible, I couldn’t imagine how
I could come with the idea of so much pain on my own.”</p>
<p>I stopped because now Ginny looked completely angry. She stopped
me sharply.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to ask you again, but I have to be absolutely hundred
per cent certain, that I hear right. That wasn’t just a dream,
was it?”</p>
<p>“No, it apparently wasn’t, but I have remembered that only later,
first, it was really just a very weird dream.”</p>
<p>“Somebody tortured you with a curse?”</p>
<p>“Most likely, well, let me rephrase. I really don’t know how much
my restored memories could be used as evidence in the court of
law, but if I remember correctly, and some other wizard didn’t
plan this memory into me than I remember quite clearly that this
truly happened and I have even whole story explaining it.”</p>
<p>There was a long moment of silence. Then Ginny went for more
questions.</p>
<p>“You mentioned it a minute ago all seven of you had their
memories modified, not only you and Henry. Did I understand you
correctly?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what we were talking recently, and it seems so.”</p>
<p>“OK, then it is very simple. I will have to let Harry know, and
he needs to bring his people here. What you are saying, could
mean quite nasty criminal investigation against a couple of very
well-positioned people in the magical government. So, we have to
do everything very much by the book, and I shouldn’t talk with
you about it too much beforehand. Just one more question, when
you said you were tortured by a curse, did you see it coming?
What colour it had?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I saw it come just dimly, by the corner of my eye, but
it had that colour all the time it was one me, which was just
some seconds I believe, although it felt like an eternity. It was
a red light, but not nice red like roses, but kind of dirty red
towards a brown a bit.”</p>
<p>Ginny didn’t say a word and pull the mirror out of the pocket of
her and spoke to it firmly, but rather quietly. “Harry?”</p>
<p>The answer came in a couple of seconds, I saw Harry showing up in
the mirror in dim light, not very well visible.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Can you talk?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we are just in the front yard of Drakeshaugh in fact. We
have left somebody to collect evidence at the place of the
attack.”</p>
<p>“I see, come here then, but I am afraid we are not done here yet.
You will need somebody from the office to come.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>The outside doors opened and closed and both men run to the
kitchen. They obviously thought that something sinister was going
on in the house, so they had their wands out and ready.</p>
<p>“No, just that I was right I am afraid. And before Anna tells you
about their memories, I think you need somebody from the office
to make it into the official protocol.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at me very closely. I was a bit nervous under his
eyes, but in the end, he turned to Ginny.</p>
<p>“Are you absolutely certain, that this is something which should
be written into the official protocol?”</p>
<p>I have basically repeated all that I said to Ginny, and he was
listening to me very carefully, looking slightly angry at James.
However, when he spoke, there was more fear than just anger in
his voice.</p>
<p>“James, so you were as kids breaking the International Statute of
Secrecy for years?”</p>
<p>I still didn’t understand what was going on, but the tension between
James and his father was considerable.</p>
<p>“Dad, I know that this is important, but couldn’t we let it go
for a moment, and speak in the morning, please? I have my future
parents-in-law waiting with dinner, and I am certain that this
will be a long discussion, not something for a few sentences.”</p>
<p>I was afraid that Uncle Harry was so angry that he won’t let it
go, but he surprised me. He turned to me and said: “I am sorry,
Anna, James is right, we shouldn’t let your parents wait. Yes, do
you think it would be possible to meet here in the morning, let’s
say in nine, and I will be better prepared for the proper
official interview? And yes, if what you told me is really so,
then you could help a lot to make people who made your life
complicated be punished for this mess. I would really appreciate
if you could help me to get them.”</p>
<p>“Uncle Harry, …”</p>
<p>“Just Harry, please.”</p>
<p>“Right, yes, I am a law student, it is my duty to help law, and
it would be fun to find out how your law enforcement works. We
will be here. I guess, if there was some problem with time, James
can connect you via that mirror thingy, right?”</p>
<p>Harry just nodded while James was drawing me out of the room,
calling our goodbyes to his parents. When we left the house, he
kissed me again. This time we enjoyed ourselves a little longer,
but this time it was me who interrupted us.</p>
<p>“James, we should really go. It is at least twenty minutes’ walk,
and I have promised to be there in five minutes.”</p>
<p>James kissed me again and when I struggled to get away from him,
he calmly told we had enough time.</p>
<p>“We will probably apparate there to make it on time anyway. Will
you be able to make it once more today?”</p>
<p>“Will it get better, or I should prepare to throw again all over
this jumper, which is not even mine?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid it won’t get really better, I heard that side-along
apparition by Muggles is always a horrible experience, but
I think you will eventually learn how to endure it. If you just
let it go and you won’t fight it, you may eventually learn to
survive it without vomiting.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for consoling words. Oh well, let’s do it.”</p>
<p>James embraced me completely and when we reappeared in the field
behind the Lintzgarth, the feeling was horrible, but at least
I didn’t throw up this time. Oh well.</p>
