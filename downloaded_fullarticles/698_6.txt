    <p>The Weasley twins duck as their room shakes with the force of a medium sized explosion, they look at each other with a bemused look; for once it wasn’t their potion making the house rock slightly. Harry sighs as he surveys the damage he had done, it was quite an impressive mess, there was goop everywhere and dust had fallen from the roof.</p><p>“Fred! George! What are you two doing up there?” Molly Weasley yells up the small staircase. “I swear if I come up there and you have damaged that room, I don’t care if you have the money to replace anything that is broken; I will kick you both out!” The twins grab Harry by the arms and shove him into the closet before vanishing the goop.</p><p>“It’s okay, mum, just mistimed an ingredient drop,” Fred says smoothly. “I know the explosion was almost as bad as that time we let Ron brew a potion, but we promise that no one else uses our cauldron.”</p><p>“If I find out you are lying, both of you and whoever else is using the cauldron will be out!” Molly warns before heading back down to the kitchen.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, guys,” Harry apologises as they let him out of the small closet.</p><p>“It’s no issue, Harry... But we do require,” George pauses looking for the right word.</p><p>“Payment?” Fred offers and George nods, “we are planning on moving out by Christmas,” he continues and Harry wonders why that matters.</p><p>“If you can fulfill our bargain, then your honour is safe,” George carries on the conversation.</p><p>“If you cannot, we tell mum about your potion making,” Fred grins. Harry sighs and waves his hand to signal he was ready for their bargain. “By the time we move out, you have to hit on all of the professors at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“What? No way!” Harry gasps; George opens his mouth to call for their mum. “Wait, okay, what do I have to do? Just flirt with them? How will you know if I’ve done it?” Fred taps his temple and rummages through a drawer before pulling out a small bowl.</p><p>“It’s a mini pensieve, you just put the memory of you hitting on the professors in here, and it will transfer to our one here,” Fred points to a larger bowl in the drawer.</p><p>“Deal,” Harry grumbles holding out his wand. Fred and George touch the tips of his wand to theirs creating a slight golden glow.</p><p>“Remember, you only have till Christmas,” George grins before pushing Harry out the door.</p>
