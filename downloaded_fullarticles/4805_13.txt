<p>Unbelievable</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Robards is sadistic,” James moaned, limping in. </p>
<p>Scorpius sighed. “What now?” </p>
<p>“We’re doing forced marches! Just when I thought he couldn’t make Auror training any worse.” </p>
<p>“Sit,” Scorpius instructed. “Give me your feet.” </p>
<p>“Kinky.” James’ laughter faded once Scorpius began rubbing his feet. “Godric! That feels…unbelievable.” </p>
<p>“Good thing your boyfriend’s a healer,” Scorpius murmured, massaging James’ arches.</p>
<p>“Fuck, yes.” James’ eyes fluttered closed. “I don’t deserve you.” </p>
<p>Scorpius laughed. “Don’t worry, you’ll repay me later.” </p>
<p>James cracked open an eye. “I can’t manage anything strenuous tonight.” </p>
<p>“Relax.” Scorpius winked. “What I’ve planned allows you to keep your feet up.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Feet okay?” Scorpius panted, fucking James slowly.</p>
<p>James, legs draped over Scorpius’ shoulders, whimpered. </p>
<p>“Good. Must…take care…of them.” </p>
<p>“Just…fuck me, you…unbelievable prat,” James growled, dragging Scorpius down for a kiss. </p>
<p>“Is that…any way…to talk about…the love of…your life?” Scorpius whispered against James’ lips. </p>
<p>“When he’s…being a…fucking tease? Yes!” </p>
<p>“Not teasing.” Speeding up, Scorpius drove deep, eyes glittering.</p>
<p>Afterwards, James spooned Scorpius. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Anytime. Ready to return to training tomorrow?”</p>
<p>James snorted. “If you’re ready to fuck me through whatever Robards does to me.”  </p>
<p>“Of course, baby,” Scorpius purred. “Of course.” </p>
