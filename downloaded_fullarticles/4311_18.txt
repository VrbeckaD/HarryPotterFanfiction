    <p>“Is this it?” </p><p>               The question hung in the dusty, stale air of the cab. </p><p>“Aye, sir,” the cabbie replied.  “Sorry, that’s as far as the road will go – you’ll have to foot it from here.” </p><p>“How far is it?” </p><p>               The man scratched the stubble on his chin before extending his knobbly finger toward the mountain range.  It projected a bold, north-bound course between the rising cliffs.  A tentative footpath crawled upwards through the grasses, like a trail from an overly ambitious slug. </p><p>“S’about three kilometers up the path, you’ll see it,” he promised with the confident air of a trusty local. </p><p>“Oh, Potty,” drawled another voice.  “Will a naïve little boy like you brave the ordeal?” </p><p>“It’s Potter,” grunted Harry, pushing open the cab door.  “And height has nothing to do with innocence, so yeah, I will.” </p><p>               Stretching with a little groan, he headed over to the back of the car and bent over it to feel for the ever-elusive boot button. </p><p>“Huh.  So, what you’re saying is, if you <em>were</em> innocent and naïve, you wouldn’t make the journey?”  His partner asked lazily, stepping out as well and closing the door on his own side. </p><p>“What, in such shady company as yourself?” Harry grinned.  “Hardly – bingo.” </p><p>He snapped the boot open triumphantly.</p><p>“You wound me.  You drive a sword through my heart.”   </p><p>“Oh, so you have one, then?  I’d wondered.” </p><p>“You have a brain to wonder with?..  Could’ve fooled me,” Malfoy snorted. </p><p>               Harry gave a grunt as he hauled at the smooth leather handle. </p><p>“Here’s your suitcase.” </p><p>“I would’ve sworn this thing’s too heavy to – whatever,” Malfoy grabbed hold of it and turned back to the cabbie.  “So, you said just follow the path until we see the place, right?” </p><p>“That’s right, sir,” he nodded, his brogue suddenly thickening.  “Best of luck to ye – they say there’s more to these crags than meets the eye…” </p><p>“Uh?” </p><p>“Cursed, they say,” the man bowed his head solemnly.  “It’s all the castle, you know.  All at the castle.” </p><p>               They stared at each other for a few tense moments, their awkward triangular standoff witnessed only by the desolate rocks.  Finally, Harry broke the silence. </p><p>“We’re not paying for a return ride, pal.  Not until three weeks are up.” </p><p>               The cabbie flashed him a brilliant smile. </p><p>“Was worth a try,” he shrugged.  “For what it’s worth, I’m still fairly certain the curse is real, though – so aye, best of luck to ye.”</p><p>               The car rustled around and sped off, leaving behind a whiff of bluish fumes as the last farewell of humanity.  Their stench seemed alien and wrong in the wind-swept valley, but it was soon gone and the wilderness was restored. </p><p>“Weirdo,” Harry decided, gazing after the quickly shrinking vehicle.  He pushed up his glasses. </p><p>“You’re telling me.” </p><p>“I wonder if that trick ever worked.” </p><p>“I don’t know, I’m quite convinced…  Then again, I have you to protect me.  My hero.  Ready to shield me from any danger, aren’t you, Saviour?” </p><p>“<em>Malfoy</em>.  Seriously, cut it out.” </p><p>“All that shit just now and it’s the nickname that gets you going?..  My, my.” </p><p>               Harry laughed, pulling up his own black suitcase.</p><p>“Shut up.  Anyway, I’d like to find the castle today, so hurry up.  Princess.” </p><p>“M’not a princess,” Malfoy grunted. </p><p>“Alright.  Generic rich kid who had thirty house-elves growing up,” Harry grinned, and turned around, making his way towards the twisting trail. </p><p>“Ha-ha, bloody ha.  Don’t act like you’re going to enjoy lugging a full suitcase up a fucking mountain.  We can’t even use magic, it’s Muggle territory!” </p><p>“True.  But it’s just three K, we’ll manage.  Quit whining.” </p><p>               They set off, following the barely existing path to the hills.  The sky was heavy with moisture.  Grey clouds moved across it with a regal gait – wild, ragged, beautiful, and above all, ominous. </p><p> </p><p>               The bell on the door gave a merry ding as it swung open into the polished interior of Barebone Castle.  Dark wood rose to the plaster ceiling, carved and intricate in its simplicity as it covered almost every surface.  The floor glinted dimly in the evening light. </p><p>“Huh.  Neat.” </p><p>“Just what I was hoping for,” Malfoy decided with a satisfied smile. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Harry frowned.  “Doesn’t the twilight seem a little…  Oppressive?” </p><p>“No.  It’s perfect,” he grinned.  “And besides, it’s almost seven.  You can’t expect it to be sunny, Potty.  The place is completely deserted, though…”</p><p>“I’m sorry – I’m right here, I’ll, I’ll be with you in a moment!” </p><p>               The voice bounced across the walls, followed closely by hurried footsteps, and a young man stumbled into the room.  He belonged in it so well, it was as if he materialized there in a cloud of smoke.  </p><p>“Hi – sorry again,” he panted, taking his place behind the cluttered reception desk. </p><p>“Don’t worry about it, it’s really no bother,” Harry said.  <em>Corners of mouth up.  Open gaze.  Relax eyebrows.</em>  “Hi.” </p><p>               The boy’s – man’s – face twitched into an awkward smile, and he looked down quickly.  His hand went up to fidget with a strand of his dark hair. </p><p>“Uh.  Hi,” he repeated.  “So, how can I help you?” </p><p>               Harry cast his partner a quick glance, but found him leaning lazily on a chiseled pillar, a far-away look in his eyes, and a maddening, smug smirk dancing on his lips.  Harry gave a mental groan, willing himself to unclench his jaw. </p><p>               <em>It’s been a long day but you can do this.</em> </p><p>“Um, we had two rooms reserved here?  For three weeks, starting today.” </p><p>               He gave another smile.  The receptionist pulled out a large leather binder and flipped it open.  The pages rustled around the wide metal rings, strikingly white in the dark reception hall.  Malfoy yawned elegantly behind them. </p><p>“Y-yes, you did – Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy?” </p><p>“Yeah, that’s us,” he agreed. </p><p>“Great – this will only take a minute,” he promised.  “Uh, I’ll need you both to sign here – and, uh, I’ll need some form of picture ID – ” </p><p>“Right – of course, hold on, I’ll just get it out – ”</p><p>               He fumbled with his pockets, while Malfoy finally deigned to approach the desk, pulling out his own papers with that single fluid motion that drove Harry nuts.  Why was it even legal to be this smooth?..  </p><p>“It’s a charming place,” Malfoy remarked casually.  “Antique décor, too.” </p><p>“Hasn’t changed in decades,” the receptionist admitted.  “I’ve got a restoration expert coming in, we’re still rebuilding the larger part of the castle…  Sign here too?” </p><p>“Of course…  There.” </p><p>“Perfect – that’s all done then – I’ll show you to your rooms, let me just get the keys – ”</p><p>               Fumbling again as he stuffed the binder back into its drawer, he edged from behind the desk and led them up the winding staircase.  His hand barely grazed the polished carvings of the banisters as the steps climbed on, the two sets of keys jangling quietly in his fingers. </p><p>               He paused right outside the landing, where a warmly lit hallway extended into the depths of the building, and pushed open a heavy door – dark polished wood, like everything else. </p><p>“Mr. Malfoy – that’s yours.  And Mr. Potter, you’re just there across the hall, third door.  Call me if you need anything.”</p><p>“Wait – about that,” Harry interrupted him just as he stepped back onto the landing.  “Sorry, we never did catch your name?” </p><p>               Their host turned around quickly. </p><p>“What – oh.  I’m sorry, I forgot to, uh – sorry,” he faltered, and his fingers picked up their fidgeting again. “I’m Credence Barebone.  I’m the, uh, the owner.” </p><p>               Harry felt his face heat up in embarrassment. </p><p>“Oh – oh, that’s great – um – ”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it.” </p><p>“I’m sorry.” </p><p>“It’s alright.” </p><p>“Uh.  I guess…  It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Barebone,” Harry said finally.  He would swear he could feel Malfoy’s amusement wafting past.    </p><p>“Please, call me Credence,” he interjected.  “I…  I don’t like my last name much.”  </p><p>“Okay,” Harry nodded, and grinned.  “I’ll remember.” </p><p>               Credence smiled back – another small twitch of his mouth, almost as if he wasn’t used to it moving that way. </p><p>“Thank you,” he said.  “Dinner’s in fifteen minutes.” </p><p>               He turned and descended back into the shadows of the reception floor.  Harry watched his head slowly disappear behind the curve of the steps, and then whipped around with a glare. </p><p>“You.  You were supposed to be the one talking to people, you prick.” </p><p>“And where’s the fun in that?..”  Malfoy drawled, raising his eyebrows.  “Everybody knows that my manners are already perfect, and you obviously need to practice.  The way I see it, I’m doing you a favour.” </p><p>“I don’t want your bloody favours, Malfoy,” Harry muttered tiredly, following him into the room. </p><p>“Exactly.  That’s what makes my actions so selfless,” Malfoy said, dumping his suitcase near the bed.  “Now quit glaring, Potter, it feels like an icy dagger stabbing through my ribs.” </p><p>“You deserve it.  Anyway, just thank your rich, pasty ancestors I liked him.” </p><p>               Malfoy lifted his eyes to the ceiling in theatrical reverence before falling on the mattress. </p><p>“Goodness me!  A miracle!  The department hermit liked another human being…  Really?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Harry decided, and flopped down next to him.  “He’s odd.” </p><p>“Naturally.  How could I forget, you’re the famed friend of all the fucking oddities on this planet.”</p><p>“I guess you’re right.” </p><p>               Malfoy stared at the ceiling silently for a moment. </p><p>“Seriously?” he asked finally. </p><p>“Well, I’m friends with you, aren’t I?”  Harry grinned.  “Ow!” </p><p>               He rolled over on his back, laughing quietly. </p><p>               The wind was picking up outside, and the open window creaked under its gusts.  The air was thick with the scent of imminent rain. </p><p>“You know, the name <em>Scotland</em> comes from Ancient Greek,” Harry mused.  “Hermione told me, before we went.  It means <em>Dark Country</em>.  Or something like that.” </p><p>               Malfoy’s chiseled profile seemed unusually soft in the strained evening light, and Harry traced the outline of it with his eyes, again and again.  There was something hypnotizing about it –</p><p>“So what?” </p><p>               Malfoy’s voice jolted him back into sleepy reality. </p><p>“Nothing,” Harry sighed.  “It’s fitting, I guess.” </p><p>               The window creaked in agreement. </p><p>“I suppose it is.”</p><p>               Malfoy turned his head to face him.  They were inches apart.  Harry’s chest suddenly felt like there was a small furry monster curled up inside of it, asleep – and there was a soft frown of confusion in Malfoy’s features. </p><p>               Harry frowned back. </p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>“Why are you even here?”</p><p>“Because the Auror department sent us?..” </p><p>“No, smartarse.  In this room.” </p><p>               Harry pondered the answer before replying.  Malfoy’s grey, stormy eyes were searching his face. </p><p>“I’m too lazy to go to my room right now,” he said finally.  “And this one’s nice.  This…  This is nice.” </p><p>               Malfoy gave a low hum in response.  The dark clouds outside swirled in the rising wind, as if they possessed their own, unfathomable sentience, and the first drops of rain pattered quietly against the windowsill, like silent tears. </p><p> </p><p>“…  Ugh, this is ridiculous.  Potter!  Wake up!” </p><p>“Argh!” </p><p>               Harry came to with a start, almost smacking Malfoy’s forehead with his own.  The window was closed, and the darkness behind it even more prevalent.  The room was lit with the yellowish glow of a table lamp, which reverberated softly off the pale wallpaper.  Malfoy was seated on the bed next to him, with a look of dramatic outrage on his face. </p><p>“W-hat the hell?” Harry inquired, pulling off his glasses.  He breathed at them, squinting, and rubbed at the lenses with the hem of his shirt.  His brain was still swimming somewhere in a sleepy daze, and he yawned, his jaw creaking wide open and nearly falling out of its socket. </p><p>“How decorous of you.” </p><p>“Thanks.” </p><p>               He pushed the glasses back onto his face and stretched.    </p><p>“It’s dinnertime,” Malfoy said haughtily.  “And you’ve been asleep for ten minutes.  Properly asleep, though I can’t figure out how.” </p><p>“Oh…  Yeah, sorry.  I do that,” Harry grinned sheepishly. </p><p>               Footsteps scuttled past their door, assaulting the echoing staircase with a series of clicks. </p><p>“You didn’t even check into your room, Potter.  Just barged into mine and fell asleep on my bed.” </p><p>“Oops,” Harry shrugged nonchalantly, swinging his legs over to get up.  “You could’ve just told me there’s food, I’d be up the moment I heard – ”</p><p>“We’ll miss all the fucking food if we don’t come down right now.  Dinner’s in a minute.”</p><p>“Antsy, aren’t we?..  Alright, you know I’d never let you starve.  Come on,” he laughed and headed to the door. </p><p>“With that hair you just slept in?” </p><p>“Yeah.  It always looks like a mess anyway, what are you worried about?” </p><p>“Can I pretend not to know you?” Malfoy asked hopefully, pausing outside to stuff his key in the lock. </p><p>               Harry laughed, waiting for it to click shut. </p><p>“No, Malfoy.  That’s what you get for waking me up,” he grinned cruelly, and almost skipped over to the narrow landing as Malfoy sputtered in outrage behind him. </p><p>               The stairs descended into the dark, deserted hall.  The only evidence of life were the muffled sounds coming from the heavy door in the north wall.  It was open just a little, so that a shining band highlighted its edge – like fairy lights, luring any hungry, helpless residents towards it.  Except fairy lights were meant to be blue, this light was gold – Harry bit at the side of his fingernail in frustration.  Damn it, fairies. </p><p>               Something rustled behind them, and he whipped around.  There was nothing except the heavy silhouetted furniture, but Harry’s pulse pounded for a while anyway, like their footsteps across the floor.  He groaned quietly.  The slightest sound, and he was ready to fucking fight.  Old Mad-Eye would be proud. </p><p>               They approached the door.  Malfoy pushed it open, and it creaked away to reveal several chatting faces, all of which turned towards the newcomers, as if on command. </p><p>“Uh,” Harry managed.  “Hi.” </p><p>               Malfoy scoffed. </p><p>“And that’s why you leave the talking to professionals, Potty,” he said, striding into the room with a perfect smile on his face.  “Good evening.  Do excuse my socially challenged friend.  Whatever I try, he just doesn’t understand how to interact with fellow human beings.” </p><p>“Hey!” Harry protested.  “I know how to…  Human.  Mostly.  I’m getting there.  I think.” </p><p>“And that’s perfectly fine, so don’t worry about it,” an elegant woman smiled good-naturedly.  “We’ve all been there…  I’m Dr.  Jin Bai, by the way – this is my daughter, Modesty.”</p><p>               She pointed at the slight girl of about ten, who sat next to her.  Modesty gave a polite nod, her eyes quickly darting over them – sharp and evaluating.  Harry thought for a moment and sat down next to Credence. </p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you both,” Malfoy said courteously and pulled out the chair next to Harry, who nodded along, smiled, and generally tried to avoid making eye contact with anyone.  “I am becoming more optimistic about this holiday by the minute.” </p><p>“Sorry I’m late!” </p><p>               A tall, blond man rushed into the room, his hair wet with rainwater and his face covered with a thick, full beard. </p><p>“I was leaving, I swear – and then remembered that I’d forgotten to close the greenhouses’ roofs for the night – and the storm was coming in like <em>mad</em> – ” he ranted, making straight for the napkins and wiping his hands. </p><p>“It’s alright, Adam,” said Credence quietly.  “You’re not late.” </p><p>“Wha – ?  Oh, good,” Adam exhaled in relief, plonking himself down next to Modesty.  “Hey – you guys are new.” </p><p>               He cast a confused look at Harry and Malfoy. </p><p>“Here on vacation, just arrived,” Malfoy informed him. </p><p>“You’re on vacation, then?” asked Dr. Bai in a rather wistful tone.  “Oh, I wish I was that lucky – I’m here for work…  To evaluate the place for restoration.”  </p><p>“Really?  That’s wonderful,” Malfoy told her, his face almost the exact one he used for Hogwarts professors.  “This castle is truly beautiful, it’s a relief to know that it’s not just going to crumble away…” </p><p>“Thank you,” Dr. Bai said with a pleased smile.  “So, you’re the new boys Credence was talking about?” </p><p>               Credence cast her an embarrassed look, but remained silent.  His fingers were fidgeting with his white table napkin, and he seemed completely consumed by the task. </p><p>“We are,” Malfoy confirmed in a regal tone.  “I’m Malfoy.  Draco Malfoy.” </p><p>“Harry,” uttered Harry with a sense of fulfilled duty.  “Harry Potter.” </p><p>“That’s a really pretty name, Draco,” Modesty said appreciatively.  “How long are you staying here?” </p><p>“Three weeks,” said Malfoy.  “Just arrived.” </p><p>“Oh?  I must have missed your arrival, then,” sighed Dr. Bai.  “There’s so much to be done in the North Wing alone…  It’s a miracle you missed the rain.” </p><p>“Well, we did have our cabbie’s blessing, didn’t we?” Harry smirked. </p><p>               Malfoy pressed his lips together to stifle what appeared to be a very unseemly snort, and Harry’s heart roared with satisfaction.  Adam’s beard moved in curiosity.   </p><p>“How so?” </p><p>“It’s a massive joke, actually,” Harry admitted.  “We hailed him at the airport, and he took us as far as the road went, right?  But just before we started the hike up here, he gives us this knowing look, and goes, <em>Wooooo, this place is cursed, so best of luck…”</em> </p><p>               Modesty giggled. </p><p>“You’re kidding.” </p><p>“Dead serious.  Like, at first, I think, he was just trying to scam us into paying for a ride back, but then we said we’re going anyway, and he was still bent on it – ”</p><p>“Kept on about the castle, and how it’s cursed,” explained Malfoy. </p><p>               Dr. Bai blinked. </p><p>“My goodness.  He really tried to talk you out of coming here?”</p><p>“I dunno,” Harry shrugged.  “The guy was weird.” </p><p>“At least you’ve got a nice story now,” Modesty sighed.  “None of our cabbies were very funny.  The last one smelled like sweaty feet.” </p><p>“Modesty!” </p><p>“It’s alright, Dr. Bai,” Harry chuckled, and leaned slightly forward with a conspiratorial grin.  “To tell the truth, our cabbie smelled too.  Like armpits.” </p><p>               Modesty started giggling again, relaxing against the back of her tall, carved chair.  Dr. Bai attempted to maintain a disapproving expression, but ended up smiling again instead – which somehow made her look much more human.  While previously, she sat perfect and glistening under the scattered light of the ornate chandelier, now she was just another person at the table, and the entire room seemed warmer. </p><p>               Harry stole a glance at Credence, and grinned; another uncertain smile was tugging at his mouth, and Harry checked that off as a victory.  Of sorts. </p><p>“Honestly.  Children, do we have to discuss this at dinnertime?..” Dr. Bai sighed helplessly. </p><p>“Definitely,” said Adam. </p><p>“Absolutely,” confirmed Modesty gleefully.  “Dinner’s not even here yet – Queenie and Jacob are still in the kitchen – ”</p><p>“Guess again, kid,” came a voice from the other side of the parlour, and a portly, moustachioed man rounded the corner with a trolley full of food. </p><p>               Modesty twisted around in her chair with a look of pure delight. </p><p>“Lookit, give her food and suddenly it’s like you’re the best person on the planet,” Jacob chuckled, setting the heavy platters on the table. </p><p>“You <em>are</em> the best person on the planet!” </p><p>“Don’t let Queenie hear you,” he grinned. </p><p>“Or your mum,” Harry added. </p><p>               Dr. Bai gave Modesty a pointed look. </p><p>“Or your mum,” Jacob agreed.  “But most of all Queenie.  She worked so hard on that new strudel, it’s practically magic.  I think I’ll have to concede the medal for today.” </p><p>“It hasn’t passed the test yet, honey,” laughed a tall, slender woman as she entered the room.  She pulled out the chair next to Malfoy’s and sat down, the picture of Veela-like grace.  “You know we have to let Modesty decide.” </p><p>“I – I thought I was the best person anyway?..”  Credence asked. </p><p>“You were,” Modesty said.  “But then Jacob made those doughnuts.” </p><p>“That’s fair,” Credence nodded.  “The doughnuts were delicious.” </p><p>               Harry grimly regretted not showing up at Barebone Castle sooner.  Malfoy was wearing a highly amused look, so he poked him in the leg, while Jacob finished positioning a massive dish in the middle of the round table and sat down next to his wife.  He gazed at the plates in appreciation. </p><p>“I suppose we may begin this humble meal,” he said cheerfully. </p><p>               The wind howled like a wounded animal outside. </p><p>“Awesome,” declared Modesty.  She picked up the fork and dug in.  “Oh, and…  Uh, Harry?”</p><p>               Harry looked up. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“What else did the cabbie – ”</p><p>“No smelly cabbies at the table, Modesty,” interrupted Dr. Bai. </p><p>               Jacob almost choked on his steak in a futile attempt to mask his guffaw.  Queenie patted his arm sympathetically, the same struggle clear on her face.  Adam was grinning behind his beard.  Credence smiled quietly into his plate. </p><p>“Muuum.  I was asking about the curse!” </p><p>“Uhuh.” </p><p>“I’m serious!  And anyway, <em>you</em> said it was real, so – ”</p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>               Harry perked up and fixed his eyes on Dr. Bai, who lifted her eyes to the ceiling in frustration. </p><p>“I regret ever opening my mouth,” she told the general assembly of people.  “All I said was that there exists a <em>legend</em> about a haunting.  That’s not even a curse, so it’s likely that the story got twisted by hearsay…” </p><p>               The rain clattered and splashed in the dreary night.  Blasts of thunder tore at the shrouded skies.  But within the castle walls, a crystal chandelier cast a tangled pattern of shadows on the table, and the silverware glistened in its warm electric light.   It felt safe. </p><p>“Dr. Bai,” Harry said slowly.  “It is a perfect night for ghost stories.” </p><p> </p><p>               For a moment, everybody gathered around the table was silent, waiting for the expert’s reaction.  Finally, she spoke up. </p><p>“Alright.  There is a legend.  But it belongs to the Barebone family, and I really believe that Credence should do the honours of – ”</p><p>“No, no, it’s alright,” he said hastily, still looking down at his plate.  “I’m – I’m not that great at telling stories.  Definitely not as good as you are.” </p><p>“What about the story you told me yesterday?” Modesty piped up. </p><p>               Credence looked up with a little smile. </p><p>“Those were gargoyles,” he said.  “That’s different.” </p><p>               Dr. Bai raised an eyebrow. </p><p>“You’re sure?” </p><p>“Yeah.  Yes,” he nodded, and turned his attention back to the food. </p><p>               She pursed her lips contemplatively.</p><p>“Okay.  That’s alright then, I suppose.” </p><p>“Perfect.  The stage is yours, Dr. Bai,” Malfoy drawled.  “What’s the story, then?” </p><p>               A hush fell over the round table.  Dr. Bai chewed at her food pensively. </p><p>“It’s a strange legend,” she said finally.  “Dating back to the family’s first century in this castle.  The story revolves around a very old myth, a rather disturbing one – ”</p><p>“Is there a myth that isn’t?..” Adam muttered.  </p><p>               Dr. Bai gave him a wry glance.    </p><p>“True,” she conceded.  “I don’t know what this says about humankind in general, but that’s very true.”  </p><p>“So, which freaky human creation is the story about?” Harry prompted.  He had to admit, he was curious.  And anyway, this could be evidence for all they knew – or at least some shred of it. </p><p>“A changeling child,” sighed Dr. Bai.  “The whole concept of fairies stealing a human baby and replacing it with one of their own is actually very common, there are stories like that everywhere around the British Isles, in Scandinavia, anywhere, really…” </p><p>“All sharing similar structure and methods of dealing with the fairy folk,” nodded Malfoy. </p><p>“Exactly – except this legend, it’s…  It’s not quite normal.  In most such stories, there’s all kinds of tricks a mother can use to make the fairies return her human baby, and they’re always similar, but this…” </p><p>               She fell silent for a moment, pondering the details.  The rain rushed behind the windows, but the clock’s ticking resounded in the room like a dull drum.  Credence was tugging at his cufflink. </p><p>“When the fairies steal the baby heir from his crib, the mother doesn’t even try to retrieve him by any conventional means.  Instead, she turns to witchcraft, and uses it to open a door to the fairy lands.  By then, she’s powerful enough to bring the changeling to that door, and exchange it there for her real son.” </p><p>“And the fairies didn’t…  Try to stop her?”  Jacob asked, his moustache somehow radiating skepticism. </p><p>“Oh, they did.  But by then, every force of nature obeyed her.  She carried out this transaction without even stepping on fairy ground.” </p><p>“Happy ending, for once, then,” smiled Queenie.  “The fairy baby didn’t even get stuffed in the oven like they usually are.” </p><p>               Credence looked up at her and shook his head. </p><p>“It gets twisted from here,” he promised dejectedly. </p><p>               Dr. Bai nodded sympathetically. </p><p>“It does,” she said.  “Mostly because of magic.   It takes a long time to learn, so by the time the mother could do what she did, her son – and the changeling – they were twenty-one years old.  Not exactly a <em>Finding Nemo</em> scenario, the son was changed forever.” </p><p>“Who’s Nemo?”  Malfoy whispered to Harry. </p><p>“You don’t know who Nemo is?!”</p><p>               Modesty was evidently appalled.  Queenie let out a silvery laugh, while her hand darted across the table to rescue the girl’s dangerously swaying glass of water. </p><p>“He’s a fish,” Harry explained, grinning at the withering look he received at that.  “Look, never mind, it’s nobody – I’ll explain later, alright?  She means that the end of the story isn’t ideal.” </p><p>“Something like that,” Dr. Bai agreed. </p><p>“Yeah…  Please go on, Dr. Bai.  Sorry about this.” </p><p>“It’s alright,” she sighed.  “Anyway, here is where the story turns to the haunting.  Keep in mind, I’m pretty sure this part was added on later, as a sort of a…  Cautionary tale, if you will.” </p><p>“Uhuh.  Lemme guess,” said Adam.  “Witchcraft?” </p><p>“Witchcraft,” confirmed Dr. Bai.  “Since it was considered a sin…  It killed the mother, and then she couldn’t pass on.  According to the legend, she is still trapped in this castle, as a ghost – with a purpose.  If a changeling is ever in the castle again, she appears and wanders around the place, preparing all the same spells, around the child’s twenty-first birthday.  Brings the real Barebone child back.” </p><p>“That’s… Nice, though?..” Jacob tried in a hopeful tone. </p><p>“She kills the changeling,” said Dr. Bai. </p><p>               A convenient peal of thunder ripped through the newborn silence. </p><p>“What?  <em>Why?</em>” Malfoy demanded.  “Didn’t she just exchange them?” </p><p>“When she was alive, yes,” admitted Dr. Bai.  “In death, however, she is angry with the fairies.  Blames them for not being able to find peace in the afterlife, and takes it out on the changeling.” </p><p>               Adam whistled. </p><p>“Huh,” said Harry.  “That’s…  Sad.  And kinda creepy.” </p><p>“I know,” sighed Credence.  “Sorry.” </p><p>“Not your fault your ancestors were messed up,” he waved it off, and relaxed in his chair.  “You go far enough up my line, and I’m related to a literal serial killer.”</p><p>               His brain fed him a flash of a pallid, inhuman face, and he shivered despite the warmth of the unnaturally cozy dining hall.  Shit. </p><p>“Really?” Modesty perked up.  “Cool!” </p><p>“No, Modesty,” Dr. Bai intoned.  “Not cool.  Serial killers aren’t cool.” </p><p>“Uh – I’m adopted anyway,” mumbled Credence, and trailed off. </p><p>               Modesty chattered on. </p><p>“But it’s cool when you’re related to one, Mum, it’s better than being related to nobody – how many people did he murder, Harry?..” </p><p>“A lot,” he said curtly, regretting ever having brought up the topic.  One joke wasn’t supposed to go this far –</p><p>“How did he kill them?  Was it a special way?  It’s usually a special way…  Ooh, were there guts – ”</p><p>“Strudel!” interjected Queenie. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Alriiight, showtime,” Harry said the moment Malfoy’s door closed behind them. </p><p>               Malfoy scoffed. </p><p>“Potter, seriously?  <em>Showtime?</em>” </p><p>               Harry waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I know,” he grumbled, briskly crossing the room and mimicked Malfoy’s voice.  “<em>We can’t afford to lose focus, Potter, it’s a serious investigation, Potter</em> – ”</p><p>“Serious?  Hardly,” Malfoy shrugged.  “The Ministry shouldn’t even bother with such surges of magic.  Even if they’ve grown lately, they’re too erratic to be connected to anything important – ”</p><p>“Then why send us up here?  We’re the best team on the force – ”</p><p>“Conceited as always, I see,” Malfoy sniffed, and pulled out his wand.  He twirled it in his long, pale fingers before casting several shielding charms on the door.  “They probably just wanted you out of the press for a while.  Took pity.” </p><p>“Huh.  You think so?” </p><p>“Say what you will about Savage, but he’s still human.” </p><p>“Barely,” snickered Harry, arranging a series of whirring detectors on the bed.  “I’m pretty sure he’s mostly caffeine by now.” </p><p>“That and trainee tears,” grunted Malfoy, enveloping the room with the final protective spell in one sweeping motion.  “Done.” </p><p>“Awesome, let’s go – ”</p><p>               Harry headed toward the door, but something snagged his elbow.  He stopped.</p><p>“What is it?” </p><p>               Malfoy’s face wore a strange pinched look as his eyes ran over Harry.    </p><p>“Nothing, just – are you sure you want to run the sweep tonight?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Harry shrugged.  “That’s what we always do, isn’t it?  Arrive, sweep, figure the rest out as we go along.” </p><p>“Yes, I know, but…  Are you sure?” </p><p>               Harry furrowed his eyebrows. </p><p>“What are you talking about?  Of course, I’m sure.” </p><p>“At dinner.  You, uh – your magic was…  I could feel it.  Angry.  And something else, too.”</p><p>               Harry stared at him. </p><p>“Yeah.  I know, I do that sometimes – it’s nothing, I’m fine, really.  You don’t have to worry,” he added after a pause. </p><p>               Malfoy sneered, and released his arm with a jerk. </p><p>“I’m not <em>worried</em>, Potter.  Forget it, let’s go.” </p><p>               Harry made a few hesitant steps toward the door and stopped again. </p><p>“Malfoy, I’m – I’m really alright – ” </p><p>“I said, forget it,” Malfoy snapped.  “Take the Sneakoscope.  Come on.” </p><p>               Harry sighed and pulled the door open.  The castle stood quiet and dark as its inhabitants snored in their rooms, and he felt the familiar thrill of adventure – it was dark, there were rumours of a homicidal ghost, and Malfoy was standing next to him, so close that he could hear his breathing – slow and even. </p><p>               Inhale.  Exhale.  Malfoy’s soft hair fluttered as they cast spell after spell, and he had Harry’s back.  Like he always did. </p><p>“Let’s take this part of the castle first,” Harry whispered.  “And then start moving to the West Wing, that’s gonna be the fastest way to explore all of it – ”</p><p>“It’s still a waste of time,” Malfoy grumbled.  “Modesty is the only shred of magic around here, and she’s not powerful enough – ”</p><p>“Wait, what?” Harry turned around.  “She’s a witch?” </p><p>“Regular wizarding kid, magic moderately under control, off to Hogwarts next year,” Malfoy rattled off.  “Nothing special though, definitely not anything that could cause the surges.” </p><p>“And anyway, they’ve been recording those years back,” Harry frowned.  “She’s too young…  Yeah, this is useless.” </p><p>               Malfoy cast the last mandatory charm and rolled his eyes as it came whooshing back. </p><p>“And the last one – nothing as well!..  Who knew?” </p><p>“Check that off, then,” Harry said, sliding his wand back into his sleeve.  “We can move.” </p><p>“Right, on to dozens more corridors,” Malfoy moaned in pure distress.  “And then the towers – I’ll blow my entire fortune on energy potions at this rate!” </p><p>“Savage will be proud.” </p><p>“Shut up, Potter.  Just…  Shut up.” </p><p>               Harry kept chuckling as they made their way towards the depths of Barebone Castle.  He couldn’t help it, he just felt alive – just like all those times he’d slunk through dark Hogwarts corridors, avoiding Filch’s shaky lantern – he felt <em>happy.</em> </p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy hissed.  “Quit laughing.  Seriously, somebody will hear us – ”</p><p>“I c-can’t,” Harry giggled, swishing his wand for a diagnostic.  “This feels like we’re – ghost hunters, or something – ”</p><p>               He pressed his hand to his mouth to stifle a particularly loud snort.</p><p>“Merlin.  Just do that fucking muffling charm, you laugh like a horse – who the fuck hunts ghosts?..”</p><p>               Malfoy shook his head as he threw a cautious <em>Revelio</em> over his shoulder. </p><p>“It’s not a real hunt, more like – oh, forget it,” Harry sighed, giving up and casting a quick Muffliato around them.  “There, happy?” </p><p>“Not particularly,” Malfoy maintained stubbornly.  “You’re still an idiot.” </p><p>“Thanks.  I knew you cared.”</p><p>               They continued the sweep, bickering quietly as they strolled down the painfully similar carpeted halls of the castle’s lived-in section.  Where the thick fabric ended, the wooden floor shone dully, sending every footstep echoing across the walls.  Harry’s neck prickled with anticipation; it was as if it could feel an unseen scrutiny on his back.  </p><p>               He thought of Mrs. Norris with her all-knowing stare and hastily reminded himself that, being an Auror on a mission, he had the right to lurk in the corridors past curfew for as long as he bloody well liked.</p><p>“Take that,” he muttered under his breath.  “I’m a fucking <em>adult</em>, bitch!” </p><p>“No, you’re not.” </p><p>“What?..”</p><p>“You’re talking to yourself again, Potter,” Malfoy drawled next to him in the darkness.  “First sign of madness, as they say…” </p><p>               Harry groaned. </p><p>“You sound like Phineas,” he told Malfoy irritably as he cast another diagnostic at the nearest stone wall.  Stone loved magic in general, more than wood ever did; so sometimes it talked.  Which was rather creepy when it happened. </p><p>               Malfoy frowned.  His face was pale in the silvery light of his <em>Lumos</em>. </p><p>“Phineas – Phineas Nigellus Black?  That Phineas?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said distractedly.  He still couldn’t shake the nagging feeling of being watched, and it was seriously beginning to bug him.  “I’ve got a portrait of him at home.  He’s annoying.” </p><p>               Malfoy gave him a pitying look. </p><p>“You merely lack social skills, Potter. And table manners.  Great-Uncle Phineas is a charming old man.” </p><p>“Oh, I’d bet he is,” Harry snorted.  “With you!  You two met up on Saturdays since you were seven, and had cute little tea parties, and – ” </p><p>               Malfoy stopped. </p><p>“He told you?” he asked, voice full of betrayed disbelief. </p><p>               Harry gaped at him. </p><p>“You’re not se – ”</p><p>               He broke off abruptly as they came to a halt. </p><p>               In front of them stood a plain door, made of heavy wood and generally unassuming – save for one detail.  There was a massive padlock hanging from it. </p><p>“Ooh.  Locked,” sneered Malfoy.  “We’re going through, aren’t we.” </p><p>               It wasn’t a question.  More like a passing remark that would normally refer to a boring, yet unavoidable conference. </p><p>“Yep,” Harry confirmed, and grinned.  “What do you think is behind it?” </p><p>“More empty corridors,” Malfoy yawned.  “Except dustier – that’s the West Wing.” </p><p>               Harry brought his wand’s light closer to the coarse surface.  It bounced unevenly off the rusty lock, which hung there, silent and infuriatingly omniscient. </p><p>“The one Dr. Bai said she didn’t get to evaluate properly yet?” </p><p>“That’s the one.” </p><p>               The door stood silent.  Harry glared at it, exasperated and throbbing with excitement. </p><p>“Well, there’s definitely something there,” he said slowly.  “If there’s anything in this castle at all.” </p><p>               He poked the keyhole with a short, muttered <em>Alohomora</em> and it clicked open – unwillingly.  It didn’t want its secrets to get out. </p><p>“What makes you say that?” </p><p>“Wha – ?..  Oh.  I don’t know, gut feeling, I suppose.  It just looks like an arse who’s hiding something important.” </p><p>“Uhuh,” Malfoy hummed.  He squinted at the lock, unconvinced.  “Come on then, are you going to open the door or not?” </p><p>“Can’t <em>you</em> do it?” </p><p>               Harry was becoming increasingly aware that they were still standing in front of a closed door, arguing, with nothing but darkness around them. </p><p>               Malfoy looked apalled. </p><p>“Those Killing Curses must’ve given you brain damage after all,” he said, wrinkling his nose.  “If you think I’m touching this dirt-coated handle, you’re – ” </p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Harry groaned.  He grasped the handle, and promptly discovered it to be indeed smeared with soil – he tried not to think of whatever else it might be. </p><p>               He pulled open the door, a little more roughly than he’d intended.  Its hinges gave a deep screech as it swung towards them. </p><p>“After you, Lord Malfoy,” he bit out, wiping his hand on his jeans. </p><p>“Because cleaning charms have ceased to exist, have they, Potter?” Malfoy smirked, stepping through the doorway as if it led into a throne room. </p><p>“Keep talking and you’ll join them.” </p><p>“Hm.  You and your barbarous tendencies.” </p><p>               Malfoy’s tone bordered on fondness, and Harry felt an odd rush of warmth prickling his face as he followed Malfoy inside.  Batting away the thought of this probably – definitely – imagined affection, he stared down the narrow, dark corridor. </p><p>               They walked on, cautiously.  The walls seemed to carry a sense of foreboding in every irregularity of their bare stone, which refused to shine in the light of Malfoy’s wand under its thick layer of dust.  Harry raised his own wand for a sweep.  Fuck those walls.  He could feel they were arseholes.  Something – a cobweb, he realized – brushed against his face, and he shivered. </p><p>               They’d reached a corner, and Malfoy was sending spell after spell down an identical grey passage, which extended into the unknown – just as dead, just as silent.  Harry glanced over his shoulder, but all he could see was darkness. </p><p>“Wow.  It’s dark,” he said, in a vague attempt to lighten the atmosphere. </p><p>“No shit, Potter.  There’s no windows in the inner halls, what do you expect?..” </p><p>               This was all wrong.  The arching ceilings they’d encountered everywhere else were gone; the ceiling here was flat, like the inside of a coffin lid.  The walls were grey, flat stone, and they were too close together.  He could hear his own pulse in this place, and if he listened too closely, it sounded like echoing footsteps. </p><p>               There was something concealed here, Harry was sure of it.  On the off chance that there was actually a case going on, the evidence would be at the end of this corridor, like the mythical pot of gold.  They would find it –</p><p>               Harry jumped at the sudden sound of Malfoy sneezing. </p><p>“Fucking dust.” </p><p>“Your nose is twitching,” Harry told him with glee.  “It’s cute.” </p><p>“Potter, I swear to – quick, in here!” </p><p>               Harry’s head connected dully with the wall, but he didn’t have time to wince or protest – because in a second, Malfoy was pressed flush against him.  He’d pushed them both back behind the corner, his hand was on Harry’s mouth and Harry could feel his hot breath against his neck – the git was always taller than him –</p><p>               The hand moved away from his lips.  Harry took a deep breath. </p><p>“What’re you – ” </p><p>“Shut up!” Malfoy hissed, pulling away slightly to glare at him, and Harry did. </p><p>               He’d suddenly noticed Malfoy’s wand.  It was clutched in his hand, pressed against the stone, and its tip was dark.  He shouldn’t be able to see it, he thought dazedly –</p><p>               Except that he could.  There was light – nothing like the clear, precise glow of a <em>Lumos</em> – it was yellow and shaky, and getting brighter with every tremor.  It was moving slowly towards them.  He could hear uneven, shuffling steps.  Ragged breathing – it was getting closer. </p><p>               Then a figure emerged from behind the corner, and his blood ran cold. </p><p>               It was a woman – tall, with wild, heavy hair and a face that was covered in patches of dirt.  Her sprawling shadow flickered in the light of a candle she held in her hand, and her sunken eyes stared unseeingly ahead as she kept walking into the depths of the silent castle.  Harry almost breathed a sigh of relief –</p><p>               When she stopped.  She stood, unmoving, almost at the edge of the corridors’ intersection.  Then, slowly, the same mirthless grin on her face, she turned her head –</p><p>               And looked straight at them. </p><p>               For one, excruciatingly long, second everything was still.  Then,</p><p>“Run!” yelped Malfoy, and they bolted. </p><p> </p><p>               Harry slammed the heavy door behind them, and leaned back against it, panting. </p><p>“Move, move, move, quickly!” </p><p>               Malfoy shoved him aside and fumbled with the lock, sliding it back into place.  It clicked shut, and he let it dangle down as it did before, and bent over, his hands on his knees. </p><p>               He stayed like that for a moment, and then stood up, pressing his ear to the door. </p><p>“Hear anything?” </p><p>“No, I – ” Malfoy began, and broke off, because they both heard it. </p><p>               A hoarse, empty laugh echoed behind the door – so close that the person had to be standing inches away from them.  A wheezing, drawn-out sigh followed – and then it was quiet. </p><p>               Malfoy pushed himself away from the door and looked up. </p><p>“What – ” Harry started. </p><p>“I don’t know, alright?” he snapped.  “I don’t know what the fuck is going on!” </p><p>               Harry watched as Malfoy walked over to the opposite wall and slid down to sit on the floor.  He shrugged and did the same, staring at the unassuming wooden door in front of them. </p><p>               He nudged Malfoy’s shoulder with his own. </p><p>“Hey…  What do you think just happened?” </p><p>               Malfoy moaned and buried his face in his hands.  His hair was limp. </p><p>“I mean, we could’ve just run away from a harmless old lady,” Harry pressed on. </p><p>“She’s not that old,” Malfoy said.  “I’d say mid-forties.  And no way she’s harmless.  That whole place was crackling with magic, didn’t you feel it?” </p><p>“What?  You’re serious?” </p><p>“Yes – it was just too erratic to show up on the diagnostics…  You really didn’t feel it?” </p><p>               Harry shook his head. </p><p>“I’ve no idea what people talk about when they say they can <em>feel</em> magic.  I mean, your own is one thing, or spells that – ”</p><p>“Whatever,” Malfoy cut him off, and let his head fall back to rest against the stone.  “Merlin’s balls, I’ve no idea what’s going on here.” </p><p>               Harry stared in front of him, thinking. </p><p>“Well, one thing’s for certain,” he said slowly.  “She’s definitely not a ghost.” </p><p>               Malfoy groaned. </p><p>“Thank you for your wisdom, O Saviour.” </p><p>“Anytime.” </p><p>               Malfoy punched Harry’s arm lightly, and he laughed. </p><p>“Alright, so what do we know?..  She’s not a ghost, and she’s not anyone we’ve met – and the haunting grounds are full of magic to the brim – ” </p><p>“And she’s got a <em>candle</em>,” complained Malfoy.  “Seriously, who uses candles anymore?..  If you’re a witch, bring a wand…” </p><p>“And if you’re a Muggle, take a torch,” Harry agreed.  “Yeah, none of this makes sense.” </p><p>               An unexpected weight dropped lightly on his shoulder, and he realized belatedly that it was Malfoy.  He was resting his head there, a stubborn pout on his face. </p><p>“I don’t know what’s going on,” Malfoy repeated in a whine, tucking his nose into Harry’s shirt.  “And I don’t <em>like</em> it.” </p><p>               Somewhere between his brain reeling with leftover excitement, and his face flushing, Harry’s heart melted.</p>
