    <p>November 1, 1981</p><p>“How could you Sirius? James and Lily trusted you! How could you betray them? You’ll pay for what you did! Incarcer-” Sirius Black growled lowly as Peter Pettigrew accused him of betraying his best friends when he, Peter, was the real traitor. Sirius raised his wand, intent on destroying the man who was responsible for the deaths of the two people Sirius loved most in the world, only to be caught by surprise when an explosion rocked the street.</p><p>“No!” Sirius yelled as he saw the tip of a rat’s tail disappear into the sewers. Anger, disbelief and sorrow combined to create a type of hysteria, and Sirius began laughing, throwing his head back and howling with laughter at the thought that they all, every one of them, had been tricked by the simpering, cowardly rat Peter. He was vaguely aware of Auror’s appearing, and retained just enough of his common sense to make a quick escape. Sirius ducked behind a building and underwent his own transformation, reappearing at the end of the alley as a large black dog. The Auror’s saw him, and then dismissed him, and Sirius was free to go. He needed to check on his godson, and then find someone who would listen to his side of the story. Dumbledore, perhaps? Or, would he call for the Aurors, as he had not been informed of the change in Secret Keeper? Well, he would worry about that later.</p><p>Sirius made his way through the small town, and transformed again at the edge of a small park. He immediately raised his wand, summoning the Knight Bus; the conductor didn’t bat an eye when he saw Sirius, so the news about the duel with Peter was not yet widely known. It had only been a day since James and Lily’s murders, and Sirius growled when he realized that all anyone could talk about was the “Savior” who had survived the killing curse and defeated “You-Know-Who”. No one even mentioned James and Lily, or wondered about the fate of the orphaned baby. Sirius was relieved to be deposited in London, so he could get away from the inane conversations of the other passengers.</p><p>Sirius slipped through the Leaky Cauldron and hurried to Gringott’s, where he met with Gorbunk, the goblin in charge of the Black vaults. He told Gorbunk about Peter’s betrayal and the Potter’s death, and underwent a grueling goblin test to prove the truthfulness of his statements. He prevailed, and as such won the loyalty of Gringotts; he would always have access to his vaults regardless of any decrees by the ministry, and he would always find a safe haven within the walls of the bank. Gorbunk, with the approval of the Chief Goblin, even gave Sirius an emergency portkey which would take him to a safe room within Gringotts.</p><p>His innocence proven, at least with the goblins, Sirius set about making some changes to his account and will, and exchanged some Galleons for Pounds. With Gorbunk’s assistance, he had an account set up at a Muggle Bank under a fake name, which was connected to his Gringott’s vault. Now he would be able to hide in the Muggle world indefinitely, if it came to it. That taken care of, he offered Gorbunk his thanks and wishes for financial success, then left Diagon Alley and rented a room in a nearby Muggle Inn, where he fell into a restless sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Sirius bought a ticket to Little Whinging and, when he arrived, he transformed back into his dog form to watch the happenings at 4 Privet Drive. Luckily, James had told him where Lily’s sister and her husband lived, and he had met them once at James and Lily’s wedding, so he knew what they looked like.</p><p>Sirius arrived on Privet Drive early enough to watch as Vernon Dursley left for work, and Petunia quickly locked the door behind him. Throughout the day, he heard Harry screaming constantly and another child laughing gleefully. Petunia, Lily’s horrible Muggle sister, was alternately screaming at Harry and cooing at the other child, and Sirius found himself disgusted. He observed all of this without being noticed by anyone until early evening.</p><p>“It is horrible, isn’t it?” Sirius spun around and growled, his fur bristling as a pale figure stepped out of the shadow of a tree, “Dumbledore said Lily’s son would be protected here, but I had to see for myself. It seems odd, does it not, for Dumbledore to place the boy in a home where he will be neglected and, at the very least, verbally abused when his reason for keeping him out of the Wizarding World is a fear for his mental stability?” Severus Snape tilted his head to the side in contemplation, but Sirius was acutely aware of the wand trained on him, and of the privacy ward Snape had raised. “You will return to your human form and tell me what happened that night or I will stun you and turn you over to the Aurors myself. The same applies if I do not like your answer.” Sirius transformed again, and glared at his school nemesis with cold grey eyes.</p><p>“Peter and I switched,” Sirius said, “I thought-I thought that no one would expect James to use Peter as the Secret Keeper instead of me, and that their Secret would be more secure. Peter was their Secret Keeper, and I was his; James and Lily-and Harry-should have been safe. No one should have been able to get to them.” The two men stood in silence for a few minutes, as Snape evaluated Sirius’ response.</p><p>“Ones animagus form can tell you a lot,” Snape said thoughtfully, lowering his wand but not putting it away, “For example, dogs are extremely loyal and protective…even if they are lacking in intelligence. Rats, on the other hand, are scavengers; they are very opportunistic and apt to attack at the first hint of weakness. Your trust was grossly misplaced, and because of that I have lost one of my only true friends.” Sirius met the other man’s glare for a long moment, before Snape sighed and continued, “If it were not for the fact that you also suffered a great loss, I would hex you until you were unrecognizable. As it stands, I have a proposition, and a way for you to help your godson. Come with me; we need to go to a safe place to talk.” Sirius eyed Snape’s outstretched hand with trepidation, but realized that the time for old grudges was past; they had both suffered a terrible loss in the last few days, and the time had come for them to work together.</p><p>November 17, 1981</p><p>“It is the safest option,” Severus glared at Sirius, tired of having this argument, “Harry has family there-family other than Petunia-and therefore the Bloodwards will still offer protection. This way, it will take longer for anyone to notice he is missing. This is what Lily wanted.” Severus tapped the envelope sitting on top of the table, “You’ve read the letter, you know that’s what Lily wanted; anything to keep him away from Petunia.”</p><p>The two men were at the Prince Estate in Cornwall, Severus having just recently accepted his title. They had been arguing for the past two weeks about the best course of action, and he was more than ready for the argument to be over.</p><p>“You don’t think Tuney will tell him as soon as I take Harry from her?” Sirius demanded, “And how am I supposed to even locate Harry’s-<em>her</em>? Isn’t she under a ward?”</p><p>“You will simply have to offer Petunia something she wants in exchange for her silence,” Severus said, “Or, you can hex her into silence, however they may be tracing your wand. As for locating Harry’s remaining family, you can start in Auradon. I have a map for you.” He passed over a sheet of parchment, “Magic is not widely used in Auradon anymore, so be careful. Find her, get her to sign the agreement, and set up the rune circle when you have settled on a safe place. Once you have accomplished that, return here and we will remove Harry from his current guardians.” Severus pushed a small chest towards Sirius, and the animagus reluctantly accepted it, slipping it into his pocket.</p><p>“Fine,” Sirius agreed, “I guess there isn’t any other choice right now. What will you be doing while I’m gone?”</p><p>“I will keep an eye on Harry, to make sure that their treatment of him does not escalate,” Severus replied, “I will also be making preparations so that you can safely teach him magic while you are in hiding, and I have accepted a job at Hogwarts so I can keep an eye on the headmaster.”</p><p>“Okay then, I’ll leave tonight,” Sirius said, “If things get bad before I return, I changed the wards on the Black Estate in Germany so that you will have access; take Harry there and keep him safe. You will also have access to my vaults.”</p><p>“I will use it only if necessary,” Severus assured him, “I will keep my promise to Lily, and protect her son. Work quickly Black, but don’t be reckless. Now, I have a potion to brew.” Severus left the room without a backwards glance or any further words of farewell.</p><p>At midnight, a large black dog could be seen jumping over the hedge marking the boundaries of Prince Estate. Once over the hedge, the dog looked back for a few seconds, and gave a soft woof, then took off running down the lane. A dark silhouette stood at the edge of the estate and watched the dog until it vanished into the night, before returning to his house. Neither one knew it, but it would be several years before they saw one another again.</p><p>August 29, 1985</p><p>Severus was just finishing his latest batch of Pepper-up Potion for Madame Pomphrey, when his Prince Heir ring sent a tingle down his arm. He frowned, and placed the potion in stasis; he had claimed his inheritance from his mother’s family several years ago, but he had never used the estate. To his knowledge, no one should be able to get past the wards and onto his property. Severus cast a quick Tempus, and saw that it was just after five in the morning; he decided to leave a note for the headmaster, rather than wake someone. It was August 29<sup>th</sup>, so he still had two days before the students arrived; Albus would have no reason to complain about his absence as long as he returned in time for the staff meeting on the morning of September 1<sup>st</sup>. Decision made, Severus erected a strong ward around his potions lab, then grabbed his cloak and made his way out of the castle.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Severus landed in the front parlor of his ancestral home, his wand drawn. A man with long, matted black hair and tattered clothing stood with his back to the room, holding his hands out to warm by the fire.</p><p>“Turn around slowly, hands in the air,” Severus commanded, his wand aimed with precision. The man raised his arms above his head to show that they were empty, and slowly turned.</p><p>“Why, Severus, aren’t you happy to see me?” Severus saw a mischievous grin and grey eyes set in a familiar face, and then his head exploded in pain.</p><p>“Snape! What the hell?” He vaguely felt arms supporting him as he fell, but he was more focused on the memories that were assaulting him.</p><p>He saw that night nearly five years ago, when he met Sirius outside the Dursley house in Surrey, as well as the night Sirius left to find Harry’s remaining family, and the day that led to his memory being altered…</p><p>
  <em>*********Flashback****************</em>
</p><p>
  <em>June 26, 1982</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Severus Snape sighed in relief as he stepped outside the school wards; he had just finished his first year of apprenticing to Professor Horace Slughorn, and he was relieved to finally be going home. The first thing he planned to do when he arrived home was pour himself a large brandy and relax with the latest Potions Journal. Before he could do that, however, Severus had an important stop to make. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Within fifteen minutes of leaving the wards, Severus was standing disillusioned in front of the Dursley house. He was looking in the living room window, where he could see Petunia gossiping on the phone while her son, Dudley, played with some toys. Harry was nowhere to be seen. After a few minutes of watching, Severus saw Dudley throw one of his toys, knocking a picture over and breaking it. The child immediately began to cry and scream, and Petunia quickly hung up the phone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What’s wrong Duddydums?” Petunia cooed, pulling the boy into a hug, “Are you hurt? What happened?” Dudley pointed at the broken picture lying on the floor and said one word;</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Fweak!” Petunia thinned her lips and glared towards the front door.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t worry, Sweetie,” Petunia comforted her son, “Mummy will take care of the freak. Does my little Dudders want some cake?” Severus lost sight of the Dursley’s as Petunia carried her son into the kitchen. About twenty minutes later, they reappeared, and Petunia carried a now-sleeping Dudley upstairs. When she came back down, she immediately went to the cupboard under the stairs and pulled the door open, then reached in and pulled out a small, thin boy covered in bruises.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I told you not to use your freakishness in my house!” Petunia hissed, slapping the child across the face; Harry-for the messy-haired, green-eyed boy was undoubtedly Lily’s son-whimpered softly, but made no other sound as Petunia drug him into the living room. “Clean up this mess,” she commanded, pointing at Dudley’s toys, “I’ll let your uncle deal with your behavior.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Sowwy,” Harry said quietly, earning himself another slap.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t speak unless you are told to,” Petunia snapped, “Hurry up and clean! Useless freak!” Severus fingered his wand, a curse on the tip of his tongue, when a car pulled into the drive. A man he recognized as Vernon, Petunia’s husband, stepped out of the car, and stomped towards the house. Vernon was extremely angry, if the red of his face was any indication. The man slammed the door shut after he entered the house, and his scowl became more pronounced when Harry was the first person he saw.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You little freak!” Vernon yelled, “This is all your fault!” Harry looked up from where he was picking up the broken glass from the picture frame, his green eyes wide with fear. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Vernon!” Petunia ran into the room, “Why on earth are you yelling? You’ll wake up Dudley!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s the freaks fault!” Vernon told his wife, “I was passed over for that promotion at work-and I know it was his doing! The freak is a curse on our family, and I’m going to teach him a lesson! I’ll make sure he never interferes in our affairs again!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, take him to the basement,” Petunia snapped, “Dudley was upset enough when the brat broke that picture; he needs his nap.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The freak did what?” Vernon thundered, “I’ll fix him!” He turned his attention back to Harry, who was shaking by now. As frightened as he was, the two-year old didn’t try to run when Vernon reached for him, and he didn’t struggle as he was picked up and carried out of the room. Severus had seen enough-more than enough-and he quickly ran to the front door. When he touched the handle, however, it burned his hand. With a heartfelt curse, Severus apparated to Hogsmeade, and ran up the drive from the front gates to the entrance hall. He made it to the headmaster’s office in record time, and was relieved that Albus hadn’t yet changed the password.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Severus, my boy!” Albus greeted him cheerfully, “Why, what brings you back so soon? Sit; have some tea!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No time for that!” Severus snapped, drinking a restorative draught to calm his heartbeat and return his breathing to normal, “As you know, upon Lily’s death I made a vow to always look after her son.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Of course,” Albus continued to smile, “You made me swear not to tell anyone, and I assure you I have not.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, I went to check on him at the Muggles,” Severus informed him, “I saw Petunia slapping him around, and he was covered in bruises. Vernon Dursley came home angry about being skipped over for a promotion, and he immediately blamed it on Harry, saying that he was a curse on their family. He told Petunia he was going to teach Harry a lesson, and she told him to take it to the basement so that Harry didn’t wake Dudley up with his screams. They are abusing that child Albus! You cannot let him remain with them, Albus; he is not safe.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You should not have visited the Dursley’s without speaking to me first,” Albus frowned, the twinkle gone from his eyes, “You must believe that I would never intentionally leave Harry in danger, and I will remedy this situation immediately.” Albus drew his wand as he stood and Severus relaxed, only slightly, but it was enough. “Obliviate.” Severus’s eyes glazed over, even as he tried to fight the spell; he could feel Dumbledore trying to eradicate his memories, and quickly gathered them into a corner of his mind, locking them in a box with a specific key; only one person could now unlock those memories, and Albus would never know they were there. His memories safe, Severus allowed himself to fall under the headmaster’s spell. “You checked on Harry Potter, and he is being well-taken care of. His relatives are spoiling him, and you have no doubt he will be just like James Potter by the time he attends Hogwarts. You will not waste any more of your time and energy worrying about the boy, and you hate all Potter’s, the Marauder’s and all things Gryffindor. You came here to tell me that you will be unavailable for a few days while you catch up on your personal potions projects.” Dumbledore finished the spell, and Severus blinked a few times, before scowling at the headmaster.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“As I said, I shall be unavailable for a few days, unless it is a dire emergency,” Severus said, “Good evening, Albus.” He stood up and made his way to the door.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Have a wonderful summer, my boy!” Albus called after him cheerfully.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>*************************</em>
</p><p>Severus groaned as his memories settled into place, and then he glared at the man staring down at him anxiously.</p><p>“You-where the hell have you been?” Severus demanded, pushing Black away from him and getting to his feet, “I told you to hurry, and it has been nearly four years! Do you know what Harry has gone through in that time?” He reached into his pocket and withdrew a headache potion, downing it in one gulp; he hid a sigh of relief as the potion began working immediately.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Sirius growled, tensing for a fight, “If anything bad happened, you were supposed to get him out of there-you promised!”</p><p>“And I tried, you idiotic mutt!” Severus snapped, “The house was warded so that I was unable to get in, so I went to Albus, and he Obliviated me! That old fool-what was he thinking!”</p><p>“Never mind that,” Sirius said impatiently, “What happened to Harry? Is he alright?” Severus’ shoulders slumped in defeat.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he admitted, “Albus performed the memory charm nearly three years ago. The last time I saw Harry, Petunia was slapping him around, his cousin broke something and blamed it on him, his uncle called him a curse on the family, and he was covered in bruises. Vernon Dursley was taking Harry to the basement for punishment the last time I saw him.”</p><p>“We have to go get him!” Sirius cried, running towards the door.</p><p>“Not so fast,” Severus closed the door and locked it with a spell, “We won’t be able to get into the house, and Dumbledore likely has people watching it. We need to get Petunia away from the house, and force her to give Harry to us. Do you still have a wand?”</p><p>“I stopped by Gringotts and traded my wand for one of the family wands,” Sirius said, striding towards the door, “We may not be able to get into the house, but we can watch it until one of those monster’s leaves.”</p><p>“You cannot seek revenge,” Severus cautioned, “Not yet. We need to get Harry out of that house and far away from here as quickly as possible; revenge can be taken care of once the child is safe.” Sirius growled, but nodded to show his agreement. “Very well, Mutt; let’s go.” Severus grabbed Sirius’ arm and apparated them to the same wooded area-consisting of nothing more than a few trees on a corner lot-which they had used to spy on the Dursley’s four years ago. Once there, Severus disillusioned himself and Sirius changed into his animagus form.</p><p>The two men were there for an hour when they saw Petunia leave the house with two children in tow; one was an overweight blond child, and the other was Harry. The blond was told to get into the car, while Harry was snapped at to hurry up and get to Mrs. Figg’s house. Petunia watched Harry with hawk-like eyes until he disappeared into a neighbor’s house, then climbed in the car and drove away. Severus cast a tracking charm on the vehicle, and then prepared to monitor the charm until the car came to a stop.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Severus and Sirius (the latter disguised as a Wizard with short, spiky brown hair and brown eyes) strolled casually through a Muggle shopping center, searching for Petunia Dursley. The two Wizard’s had forgone their robes, and were dressed simply in black slacks and button-up shirts-grey for Severus and dark red for Sirius. As they came upon the food court, Severus spotted Petunia sitting at a table with her son. Petunia had a salad, while her son had Pizza, fried chicken and a hamburger. As the two men approached the table, they could hear Petunia promising Dudley ice cream once he finished his lunch.</p><p>“Hello, Petunia,” Severus said softly, “What a pleasant surprise.” Petunia turned with a large fake smile on her face, which quickly disappeared when she realized who was standing behind her.</p><p>“You!” She hissed, “What are you-”</p><p>“Silence,” Severus spoke over her, not raising his voice but still commanding obedience, “Black and I have a proposal for you; if you agree to it, no harm will come to you or your son. Draw attention to us and…well, it won’t be pleasant.” Severus slipped his wand out of its holster, and smirked when Petunia paled.</p><p>“Fine!” she snapped, masking her fear with anger, “Tell me what you want, and then get away from me! I don’t want your kind around my son! It’s bad enough we have to let the freak live with us!” She shot a nervous look at her son, but he was too engrossed in his food to pay attention to their conversation.</p><p>“Don’t you call my godson a freak, bitch,” Sirius growled, making the woman pale, “You should count yourself lucky that Harry’s safety is more important to me than revenge.”</p><p>“As it stands, we are here to relieve you of your responsibility to the boy,” Severus announced, and didn’t even bother hiding his smirk when Petunia sat up straighter; it would take very little to convince the woman to give up her rights to Harry…</p><p>Later that evening, a blue sedan drove into a rundown neighborhood in Cokeworth, and stopped in front of a decrepit house. Petunia Dursley got out of the driver’s seat, and stepped around to the trunk of the car; Severus stood disillusioned on the front porch and watched in shock and disgust as the woman opened the trunk and reached inside. When she withdrew her arm, her hand was clutched around a scrawny wrist, and she yanked the boy from the car, quickly dropping him on the ground. The young boy began crying, and she snapped at him to be silent, before reaching down and yanking him to his feet. She pushed the boy towards the house.</p><p>“Go on, boy!” She ordered, “That’s your new home now, and don’t even think about coming back to us.” She gave Harry another hard shove and then quickly got back in the car and drove away, not even waiting until Harry made it out of the street. Severus immediately went to try and calm the sobbing child, while Sirius threw a hex at Petunia’s car-it missed, unfortunately.</p><p>“Please no! I be good! I be good!” Harry was crying out, his arms stretched towards where he had last seen his aunt; he strained against Severus’ hold, but made no real attempt to get free.</p><p>“Harry, look at me,” Severus spoke calmly, and wide, tear-filled green eyes looked up at him.</p><p>“Who Harry?” the boy asked, “I freak.”</p><p>Never had Severus regretted making a vow more than at his moment; Petunia had agreed to give them Harry with minimum fuss, only stating that she did not want to see the two Wizards again. She threatened to report them to Dumbledore unless they made an Unbreakable Vow not to approach her or seek revenge on her when she dropped Harry off. Neither Severus nor Sirius were thrilled with the vow, but they hadn’t expected to be forced to watch as Petunia abused the child in front of them, either. Severus’ only consolation was that the vow only stated they would not seek revenge when Petunia dropped Harry off-the vow said nothing about seeking revenge at a later time, and that was exactly what Severus planned to do. For now, however, his priority was the injured child in his arms.</p><p>“No, you are Harry,” Severus corrected gently, even as he planned Petunia’s death, “Harry is the name your parents gave you. My name is Severus, and this is Sirius. Come eat with us, and we’ll tell you what happened, okay?” Harry nodded uncertainly, but allowed Severus to carry him into the house. Severus took him straight to the kitchen, and placed a sandwich in front of the five-year-old; he’d asked his house elf, Trinity, to fix it earlier. “Eat your supper, Harry.” Harry hesitantly took a bite of the sandwich, his wide green eyes going back and forth between Severus and Sirius. After making sure Harry ate the whole thing, and drank the milk (which had been used to mask the taste of a healing potion), Severus started the explanation.</p><p>“Harry, as I said, my name is Severus,” he began, “I was friends with your mother a long time ago. This is Sirius, and he was friends with your father. The night your parents died, a powerful man took you to live with your aunt because he thought she was the only blood family you had left. We did not believe that, and Sirius knew your mother and Petunia did not get along, so he went to find someone else who could keep you safe. It took him a very long time, but he found someone. She lives very far away from here, and Sirius is going to take you to her. He will stay there too until he is sure you are safe.”</p><p>“Not go back?” Harry asked, “No more freak?”</p><p>“That’s right, pup,” Sirius smiled at him, “You’ll never have to go back there again, and if anyone calls you a freak, I’ll bite them for you.” Harry gasped as Sirius transformed into a dog and barked menacingly for a moment, before giving a happy “Yip!” and wagging his tail, causing Harry to laugh.</p><p>“I’ll keep you safe, okay Harry?” Sirius said as he returned to his human form.</p><p>“Safe,” Harry nodded, “Siri.” He tilted his head and looked at the other dark-haired man, who had been watching them with quiet amusement. “Sev-Sever-Serv-” Harry pouted, unable to remember the name, “Sev come? Sev safe too?”</p><p>“I will stay here,” Severus said, deciding not to call Harry out for butchering his name, “I will make sure it is safe here so you can come back and go to school when you are older.” Severus was surprised that Harry was taking everything so well, but he expected the child would have a breakdown later; he only hoped that Sirius would be able to handle it. Thankfully, Severus had packed several potions, including calming draughts. At least Harry’s cuts and bruises had been healed by the potion; a discreet diagnostic while Harry was eating had also confirmed there were no internal injuries, although there was evidence of improperly healed broken bones. In addition, the child was malnourished, but Severus had been able to tell that just from looking at him.</p><p>“Oh.” Harry frowned, as if he was trying to understand, then smiled, “Sev make school safe! Harry go school!”</p><p>“That’s right,” Severus smiled, “I will make the school safe for you to go to when you are older. Now, Harry, you and Sirius will be leaving soon, and you will use magic.”</p><p>“Magic real?” Harry asked, green eyes wide.</p><p>“Of course it’s real!” Sirius said, “Magic lets me turn into a dog, and it lets us travel really far. There’s a lot magic can do, and I’m going to teach you all of it!”</p><p>“You were successful in setting up the circle then?” Severus asked, and Sirius nodded.</p><p>“The magic circle is ready,” he confirmed, “Were you able to get everything else?”</p><p>“Yes,” Severus summoned three large trunks, and then shrunk them down to would fit in Sirius’ pocket, “I have included several practice wands, and a two-way endless journal so that we may keep in touch.”</p><p>“Good,” Sirius said, then looked down at Harry, “Now Harry, I want to tell you about the people we will be staying with. When your mother was a baby, a mean man kidnapped her, and gave her to a nice couple to raise. Your mother’s real mom was a fairy, named Maleficent, and she thought your mom was dead. I told her about you, and she wants you to come live with her, and be a brother to her other daughter, Mal.” Harry frowned in concentration again, and slowly understood what he was being told; Harry was an intelligent child, despite his speech not being very well-formed for his age. Severus was certain Sirius would be able to improve Harry’s speech as well, in time.</p><p>“I have mommy?” Harry’s green eyes were wide with wonder as a smile stretched across his face.</p><p>“You’re going to have a mom and a sister,” Sirius confirmed, “Are you ready to go?”</p><p>“Yes, go,” Harry said, letting Sirius lift him out of his chair. He turned to Severus and offered a sweet smile, “Bye Sev. Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Harry,” Severus replied, gently ruffling the small boy’s hair, “I shall see you in a few years. Take care of him, mutt.” He glared at Sirius, who responded with a laugh.</p><p>“I’ll miss you too, Sev,” he said, knowing and taking advantage of the fact that Severus wouldn’t hex him while he was holding Harry, “Okay Harry, hold onto me really tight. We’re going on the count of three. One…two…three…” Severus waited until the man and child had gone, then reapplied his wards before returning to Hogwarts. He had much to do if he was going to make the school safe for Harry.</p>
