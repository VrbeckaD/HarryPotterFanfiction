    <p>Harry was nervous and excited. He had never ridden on a plane before or been to another country. His new father explained to him that his new home was very far away and was also an island just like England! He was going to miss Dudley though, he hoped that he wouldn't be too sad with him gone. His new father told him that he would have a mother, and even grandparents! He hoped that they were nice.</p><p>Izuku noticed how excited the little boy was. It was a pity that Kurogiri's warp quirk didn't have a continental range, but at least his new son would get to experience a first class plane ride so it wasn't a total loss. He knew the child had never even been out of the country let alone been to Japan. "Are you excited?" He said smiling pretending not to see as one of the flight attendants snuck the child a chocolate bar cooing at how adorable he was. "Japan is a beautiful country. My parents are looking forward to meeting you." <br/>
"really?" Harry asked. "you think they'll like me?"<br/>
"Of course, my mother has always wanted grandchildren." Izuku hoped for the child's sake that his words were true. While his mother certainly would like him and treat him well, his father was capricious in his affections. All for One was not a man who believed in loving someone not of his blood. Just look at Shigaraki, ignored when All for One had no use for him. While he knew his father wouldn't be rude or outwardly cruel to Harry, there was no guarantee that he wouldn't do more than the bare minimum.<br/>
Harry smiled hopefully while getting comfortable for the long plane ride.</p>
<hr/><p>Inko was in the living room with a cup of tea excited for her son to come home. He had called her two days ago that he was coming in early from his business trip to England. She wondered if her son thought he was being subtle about his 'business trips'. While she didn't know the scope of what her son and husband got up to (and was thankful for that because she didn't want to know), she knew some. Poor Ochako, who wasn't happy with being married to a villain/crime boss. Inko tried her best to help her come to terms with it. She sympathized, since she wasn't happy with Hisashi being a villain either but she knew he would never let her go. Just like Izuku would never let Ochako go.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway her son had been excited over the phone. He told her that he had a surprise for her and Hisashi. She asked him if Ochako knew, and he said that it was a surprise for her too. She hoped it went well, she remembered the last surprise Izuku brought home. Hisashi was still finding kittens in his clothes.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry was looking through the window of the rented car with wide eyes. Everything was so new to him. Japan looked different from England so far, though he couldn't read the language. Luckily there where english translations under the signs or he wouldn't know what anything said. His new father promised to make sure that he got a tutor to help him learn Japanese. After all, if Izuku had his way, Harry would never leave Honshu until he was at least 30. It wouldn't do for him not to be able to speak or read the language. <br/>
<br/>
The car drove through the Japanese countryside and to an edo style mansion. Harry's eyes widen further and Izuku laughed. He didn't think the boy could be more nervous and excited. The car door open and Izuku ushered him out and led him into the house. <br/>
"Kurogiri", He called.<br/>
"Yes, young Master?" a voice called out. Harry nervously hid behind Izuku's pants as a man shrouded in dark mist appeared. "is this the surprise for Inko-sama and Ochako-sama?"<br/>
"Yes." said Izuku. "Take me to my mother" "Of course, Sir. She is waiting for you."</p><p>A portal opened and Harry clung tighter to Izuku's pant leg. "Don't be scared. The portal is harmless. I'll be with you every step of the way." Izuku soothed. He took his hand as the walked through the portal into a rather nice looking living room.<br/>
"Izuku!" Inko ran to hug him. "I've missed you so much! How was England? I heard it's cold and rainy there. Is that true? Did you stay warm?"<br/>
"Yes, mom." Izuku laughed as she pulled away. "my trip was fine, I had to reschedule though. I ran into an unexpected development. I have a surprise for you though." Izuku pushed harry forward and Inko gasped and bent down to his level. "You know how my wife and I have been having trouble having children? Well, I found Harry here. His family didn't want him and I know we have more than enough room. So I decided to adopt him. He doesn't speak Japanese yet."<br/>
Inko smiled at Harry as Izuku talked. "Hello little one." She said in accented english. "my name is Inko. I'm your new grandmother." </p><p>She reached out to him as he nervously returned the hug. "Does he know that you're a villain?" She said in Japanese. "what do you intend to do with him?" "He doesn't know yet, but he will. Until my wife and I have a child, he will be my heir."<br/>
"and if she does have a child, what then," she asked. He smiled, "don't worry mother. One way or another, he'll be part of the family. Maybe an advisor. I could give him a quirk, but he's ours either way."<br/>
Inko hugged Harry tighter to her. "I see." She pitied the boy in her arms. Izuku was truly his father's son. "Fine, but you'll tell your father about Harry." Izuku sighed.</p><p>She smiled at the boy. "come, let me show you to your room. Tell me about yourself." As she walked away with Harry's hand in her's, she hoped that she could prevent this gentle looking boy into becoming like her son. She lost Izuku to All for One, she prayed she wouldn't lose her new grandchild. </p>
