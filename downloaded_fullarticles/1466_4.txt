  <em>Well, how about that?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sensed something disturb their peaceful Sunday brunch, and turned to Harry. He was staring at today’s Daily Prophet, and it only took her a second to realize what the problem must be. Daily Prophet always made a point of publishing a list of all newcomers to the ranks of Ministry, and Hermione already knew who would be having his first Ministry day tomorrow. She had pondered whether to tell Harry about it, or just let him notice it himself — the mischievous part of Hermione had voted for the latter… but now, it seems, the cat was out of the bag. Or the dragon out of the manor. Whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Among the new Ministry employees this month is the former Death Eater <b><em>Draco Malfoy</em></b>, who has been recruited to the Office of Improper Use of Magic due to his extensive knowledge in analyzing and breaking various kinds of curses, both ancient and new. His employment has created a certain amount of conflict within the Ministry — it is common knowledge that the Malfoy family played a crucial role in furthering the rise to power of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. However, when Daily Prophet requested a comment from the Minister of Magic, <b><em>Minister Shacklebolt</em></b> stated that Mr Malfoy has paid his dues to the community by serving two years under home arrest, after which he has shown a considerable aptitude in his chosen area of magic, and that there is no question about his loyalties, nor about him being a great asset to the Office. Minister Shacklebolt requires that <b>all</b> Ministry officials be granted full cooperation from the British Wizarding World in fulfilling their duties.</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>”Well, how about that?” said Harry out loud, after having stared at the news snippet for another ten minutes. Hermione saw that Ron was actually clocking Harry, and trying very hard not to laugh, or say anything referring to Harry’s obsession during the Sixth Year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ron couldn’t help himself, however, when the next thing coming out of Harry’s mouth was ”He must be up to something”. Ron guffawed, tears pouring from his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Even Hermione sniggered; it was as if they had briefly stepped several years into the past. Like they were school children again, not (relatively, mostly) adult 21-year-old Ministry employees.</p><p> </p><p>”Harry, let’s not go down that road again, yeah? Malfoy’s been vetted by the Ministry, and if Kingsley is saying that he should be left alone to do his job, then I think we should do just that. Or don’t you trust Kingsley?”</p><p> </p><p>”Hermione, you know I do… it’s just… Just weird, ok. I know I testified for him at the trials… I know Dumbledore thought he should get a second chance, and I’m not opposed <em>per se</em>…. I guess I just didn’t think what it might actually <em>mean</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron had finally stopped laughing; he hiccuped and wiped tears from his cheeks. ”You know Harry, it’s not that I don’t get what you mean. I don’t exactly look forward to seeing His Highness The Insufferable Ferret during office hours, either. Or any hours, for that matter. But it’s not like we aren’t already used to working with unsavoury Slytherins. I mean, Zabini’s an Unspeakable, and I haven’t felt the need to retch while working with him since at least a few months now. And you know we go to Parkinson’s pub for a pint every now and then without her having tried to poison us, or vice versa. I’m not saying it’s not a bit different with Malfoy but…”</p><p> </p><p>”Ok, I get it. Or maybe I don’t, to be honest. But I know that I <em>should</em> get it. And maybe he won’t come to the Auror office at all. I mean, there <em>are</em> other cursebreakers in their office.”</p><p>”And I know I should get over this,” Harry continued, again staring at Daily Prophet. ”I’ve made my peace with Zabini, even Parkinson — and she wanted to give me over to Voldemort, for Merlin’s sake… I’m on civilized terms with Nott, and Ginny’s friends with Millie nowadays, so…”</p><p> </p><p>”Harry, we understand. It was always different with you and Malfoy. You both got out of your way to annoy each other for six years. I’m not making excuses, he was rather horrible to us all. Let’s face it, though, none of us made any effort to change his views about us, we were so certain that black was black and white was white and there could be no shades in between. And you two were always, <em>always</em> at each other’s throat, even when there was no reason at all for it. Can’t help it though, Malfoy was a hard one to like… And yes, he made a few decent choices during the last year of the war but it’s not like he was exactly pleasant while making them… did he ever even thank you for saving his life from Fiendfyre, or for testifying for him?”</p><p> </p><p>”I’m not looking for gratitude. I get quite enough of that as it is, and you know how I feel about it. I just don’t know what to expect. I haven’t seen him since the trials, so that’s, what, like, three years?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at the article some more. ”Maybe I just have to dig into my Gryffindor traits,” he said, smiling finally. ”You know, to boldly go where Harry hasn’t gone before,” (Hermione gave a gratifying giggle for the Star Trek reference) ”and give Malfoy an actual chance. See what this new colleague is all about. Delaying judgment, as it were, until there’s actually something TO judge. Settle with not hexing him on sight, not going for the jugular for the first snide smirk, and all that rot.”</p><p> </p><p>”That’s the spirit,” laughed Ron. ”I’m buying you a pint every week for the next six months IF you can do all that every time you see him. Starting tomorrow!”</p><p> </p><p><em>This </em> <b> <em>shouldn’t</em> </b> <em> be a problem. Even though Aurors work together with cursebreakers nearly on a daily basis, there are several of them, and the chances that they put a rookie on the field immediately are slim… Ok. Breathe, Harry. Ron is taking this in stride so far, why the hell am I being so nervous?</em></p><p> </p><p>But Harry couldn’t help it. He went to bed early and slept fitfully, with dreams about badges flashing, ferrets, blood and curses, and fire. So much fire.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Monday turned out to be such a hectic day that Harry didn’t have time to worry about Malfoy. What with the triple murder of a jewellery vendor and his assistants early Monday morning, a new turn in the smuggling case, and an anonymous tip about a possible case of counterfeit potions being sold at a shop on Knockturn Alley, the Aurors had their hands full. Harry had barely time to remember his own name, much less Malfoy’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>At five o’clock, Harry was scribbling his report on the progress with the smuggling case, when Ron trudged to their cubicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>”I don’t care what Robards says, I’m not writing my report today. I’m beat. I’ll come early tomorrow and put something together. Nasty case, those murders, just wanna go home and forget it for a while.”</p><p> </p><p>”Want to go have that pint you promised?”</p><p> </p><p>”What? Oh, that. Well, you didn’t bump into the ferret today now did you, and I’m not coughing up a pint without you having met <em>some</em> sort of a challenge!” Harry saw Ron smile — at least reminding him of his promise was good for something if it cheered him up a bit.</p><p> </p><p>”Ok, you go home. I want to finish this report before I leave. See you tomorrow, Ron!”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>After half an hour, Harry was finally done with the report. He put the scroll into the ”out” tray and it vanished with a faint pop. The office was blissfully silent for a change, all the other Aurors either gone home or out in the field. Harry stared at his hands and felt… odd. No other word for it. He was not prone to self-analysis but this time he stopped for a while to ask himself why exactly did he feel odd. And what did that even mean — <em>odd</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Then he smiled lopsidedly. No need for lengthy soulsearching, the reason was obvious, wasn’t it, even for him. He had spent a lot of energy worrying about today. Trying to prepare himself mentally to meeting his old nemesis. Then Monday had actually happened with all the murders and what not, he had forgotten all about Malfoy and his worries, and hadn’t seen the git either. All that worrying and being nervous, for nothing! Fitting, somehow — the prat caused him problems even without being present!</p><p> </p><p>Harry had half-risen from his chair when he heard a tiny sound from the cubicle door. Alert, Harry looked up so fast it made his head spin. <em>Too much residue nervousness</em>, he had time to reproach himself, when it hit him. The sound was made by none other than Draco Malfoy. <em>Speak of the devil and he will appear</em>, crossed Harry’s mind. <em>I jinxed myself, shouldn’t’ve thought of the ferret, SO close…</em></p><p> </p><p>Malfoy looked at Harry impassively, his face a pale mask, his voice steady and neutral. ”Sorry to bother you, Potter, I didn’t think you…anyone would be here anymore at this hour. Spencer gave me your smuggling case to analyse, you know, the curse problem of the caskets. Here’s the report, I thought I’d bring it personally, seeing as I’ve never been here, in the Auror department. Sudden bout of curiosity, you know, just wanted to have a look.”</p><p> </p><p>And what the bloody hell was going on here: Malfoy actually SMILED. A tiny, cautious smile, granted, but a smile nonetheless. Harry’s brain pretty much short-circuited. Never during their acquaintance had Malfoy smiled at him. Never.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Smirked, yes. Smiled, no.</p><p> </p><p>What was Malfoy up to??</p><p> </p><p>A voice that was clearly Ron’s, wailed in Harry’s brain, ”goddamnit Harry…not this, you <em>promised</em>!” The thought brought a smile to Harry’s face, which, ok, probably looked to Malfoy like Harry was <em>smiling back</em> at him.</p><p>These things happen, right? Coincidental smiles. It’s a thing, right?</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy’s smile grew a bit, and he stepped forward and handed a scroll to Harry. ”Here, I’m sure it will be useful, there were some distinctive traces in the curses which gave me some ideas about the probably caster. I’d appreciate if I could go to the last warehouse you found, I think there might be more traces there. Just to make sure, I mean; it wouldn’t do to drag someone to questioning on the basis of half-arsed evidence.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy kept smiling all through his speech. His voice was neutral and kind, but also confident, befitting a professional. Harry’s head was foggy — as annoying as it was to admit, Malfoy had taken him by surprise. Harry wasn’t used to being wrongfooted — he would’ve died ages ago (and not by choice!) had he been easily disturbed by suddenly changing circumstances, after all — but obviously Malfoy still had it in him to throw Harry off his stride. <em>Malfoy had never, ever, spoken to me calmly, without any intention to aggravate, without any malice. How to deal with that?</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Get yourself together, you’re a bloody Auror and he’s nothing but a rookie cursebreaker, a git, a twit, a ferret, a pain in my arse for six years. You can handle this.</em> ”Oh, thanks Malfoy, that was decent of you. Yeah, I’m not usually here this late but this was a hell of a day and I wanted to finish my report. To make a fresh start tomorrow, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy actually looked a bit thrown by Harry’s answer. <em>Didn’t he think I would reply in kind? Did he expect me to be, well, my old Hogwarts self? I DID speak for him at the trials, though, so…</em></p><p> </p><p>Harry cleared his throat. ”Umm, Malfoy, I had planned to go to the latest warehouse tomorrow, myself. It hasn’t been emptied quite yet, our team is taking its time because of the nature of the stuff, and the curses on the caskets, as you well know now. If you’d like to tag along..?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Well, this is a first. I’m actually actively asking for Malfoy’s company.</em> The irony of the whole situation started to get to Harry’s sense of humour, and he dearly wished that Hermione were there to see all this. She would have got a good giggle out of it.</p><p> </p><p>For a tiniest fraction of a second, Malfoy looked surprised, but he got ahold of himself quickly and his face was again the neutral mask. ”Perfect. What time do we leave?”</p><p> </p><p>”If you’re in the Atrium at nine, we’ll start from there, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>And that was it. Malfoy left for wherever it is he goes, and Harry walked home. He needed the short walk, to be out for a while, to clear his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>That was it. Not that terrible. There had been no shouting, no name-calling, no hostility whatsoever. It was almost as if the ten preceding years had never existed. Malfoy was just another colleague.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>Well, not quite, let’s not kid ourselves.</em> Harry snorted and a passer-by looked at him warily. <em>But close enough. If we just steer clear of anything war-related, maybe this can work out after all, and Ron will have to buy me that pint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>Harry went to bed feeling hopeful all of a sudden and fell asleep, easy as anything.</p><p> </p><p>But his dreams were about wands lowering, uncertain recognitions, smirks over long tables, origami crane messages.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>There was fire, like a great big hungry beast, ripping everything apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But also arms, tightly gripping Harry’s waist, keeping everything together.</p><p> </p><p>He woke up too early, shuddering, and couldn’t for the life of him say if it was a pleasant shudder or not.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Let it go, Harry, that was then. None of it matters anymore. To anyone.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry came to work later than usual, it was already half past eight when he barged into the cubicle he and Ron shared. Ron hardly paid him any notice, he was neck-deep in scrolls, writing furiously. ”Hello and goodbye, don’t disturb me, I’m dead if I can’t get this report to Robards in five minutes. Should’ve done this yesterday but nooooooooo, had to be all sensitive about it and run home, yeah, serves me right.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ron kept scribbling and scolding himself until he finally threw the quill away, scrolled the parchment and pushed it into the ’out’ tray. ”Wow, last minute panic is actually pretty productive!” said Ron, finally having the time to raise his eyes to Harry and smile. It took him all of half a second to ask ”What’s wrong? You look constipated. What’s the matter, Robards on your arse about the smuggling thing-y?”</p><p> </p><p>”You’d think, considering it’s been a month and we’re not making a lot of headway, but no. And today we might have something new but… as long as we’re discussing the case, there’s something… Prepare yourself to buying me a large pint in the very near future.” Harry smiled but Ron wasn’t far from the truth, Harry did feel a bit uptight. <em>Nervous, again? Come on…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>Ron was picking up the quill he had thrown to the floor but straightened up quickly. ”Are you saying what I think you’re saying? You’ve met Malfoy?”</p><p> </p><p>”And lived to tell the tale, yes.” Now Harry’s smile was a bit more cheerful, for real this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>”Yes, but does <em>he</em>? Live, I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>”Hey, what do you take me for? Don’t forget that I’m the mighty Harry Potter, Auror extraordinaire! I’d think I have the wherewithal to not go slaying relatively decent people left and right! Self-control, that’s my middle name.”</p><p> </p><p>”Dude, you’re hallucinating, you make me worried. Let me walk you to St Mungo’s, straight to the Janus Thickey ward. And who’s been teaching you weird words? Self-control? Admit it, you don’t know the meaning of it, you’re just throwing around words that sound impressive! <em>Wherewithal</em>, Harry, honestly…”</p><p> </p><p>The two friends laughed about their oh-so-funny bantering, but then Ron got down to business. ”So you did meet Malfoy. When did that happen? Was it awful? Did you have to concentrate real hard not to kill the guy? Were there words? Duels? Any blood, a bit of gore? I know you should’ve let Ginny teach you that bat-bogey hex, it might have come in handy.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at his watch. Ten to nine, he still had a few minutes for Ron. ”It wasn’t like that, surprisingly enough. I was just leaving when he came in here, bringing a curse-report. We talked. And, if you can believe it, there was smiling involved. It was sickeningly proper! And now we’re leaving to check out the latest smuggling warehouse together — Malfoy thinks he might find some useful traces there.”</p><p> </p><p>Both were silent for a moment. Then Harry went on, ”It was pretty NOT normal, actually, just because it WAS so, you know, NORMAL. Like we were anybody. Any colleagues. Not me and Malfoy at all. With everything. It was less hard than I had imagined, to be civil to him. I don’t know how hard he had to work for all that normalcy he was radiating….” ”Oh, he was <em>radiating</em> now, was he?” Ron was sniggering, the bastard.</p><p> </p><p>”That’s not what I meant, and you know it,” huffed Harry. ”I’ve got to go now, we’re meeting at nine down in the Atrium. Just you take care that you have the money for the pint ready. I’ll amaze you with my self-restraint (STOP laughing, you bad, bad friend!) and my non-judgementalness (YES it’s a word!! NO, don’t ask Hermione!!) and me not hexing Malfoy at sight. At least until I get that pint!”</p><p> </p><p>Ron’s laughter followed Harry as he was walking towards the elevators. He felt lighter, it had been good to talk to Ron, joke around a little. Made all this seem not so monumental.</p><p> </p><p><em>It shouldn’t be </em><b><em>monumental</em></b><em>, that sort of word shouldn’t come up in the first place! Again, Harry, what the everloving fuck is wrong with you. He’s a colleague. He’s a Dean, or a Sheppard, or an Angelina, or even a Zabini for heaven’s sake. Just a colleague. Deal with it</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy was waiting in the Atrium. Composed, head held up high, back ever so straight, face carefully neutral. The mask, so, so carefully held in place. Some of the other employees were making sidelong glances at him, some glared with open hostility. Nobody said anything, though.</p><p> </p><p>He hadn’t noticed Harry yet. Harry paused for a minute, took a sort of a birds-eye view on the scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>It is less than four years since the war ended. People are still trying to work through their losses. What had made Kingsley decide it was a good idea to employ a Death Eater? What had made </em> <b> <em>Malfoy</em> </b> <em> think it was a good idea to work among the people who had fought against him, suffered for the damage his side had caused? You might suggest it was stupidity, but Harry knew that whatever else Malfoy was, stupid wasn’t it. He had been an excellent student at school, second only to Hermione. He had been creative (let’s not forget the badges!… or the Vanishing Cabinet, if one must be more sombre) and clever, albeit in bad ways. He had been loyal — to his family, if nothing else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>For the first time, Harry wondered about Malfoy’s options after his house arrest. He hadn’t attended Eighth Year at Hogwarts, and Harry didn’t know if he had done his N.E.W.T.s in some other way. He must’ve had, how else would he have got a job at the Ministry? So he had probably gone the hard way, private tutoring (how did that even happen? who would have wanted to tutor the pariah of the Wizarding World?), private exams. He must have worked extra hard, to gain special knowledge of obscure curses in such a short period of time.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Again, what could he have done, after? Who would’ve employed him?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Other than Kingsley, who is sometimes too kind for his own good. And there had been ”conflicts”, the article in Daily Prophet had said. Kingsley must’ve put his foot down, pulled some ministerial weight in earnest.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Why didn’t I do anything? How did I just forget him like that? I didn’t spare one thought to the ”after”. I testified, because I wanted him to go free. Because I didn’t think he was truly evil, and because he did make those few decent choices in the end, like Hermione said. But I spared not a thought on how he would fare afterwards.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Should I have? Didn’t I do enough already?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If I should have, but didn’t, but forgot — what else should I have done? What else have I forgotten?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Did I just leave him hanging? Fending for himself, since for sure his parents had no power to help him.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>And now I watch him, wrapping his pride around himself like a warm robe. Radiating something, I don’t know what, to ward off unkind looks. People expecting, hoping, him to fail, to show his ”true colours”.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Do I want him to fail? For old times’ sake, tit for tat, revenge is sweet? If yes, then why did I even bother to testify? Do I really, really want to see how fast we can get each other angry, our wands drawn? It couldn’t have been easy for Malfoy yesterday. To be so civil, borderline friendly. If that twit is ready to try so hard, why shouldn’t I? I’m supposed to be one of the good guys, after all…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>”Malfoy, you’re already here, brilliant! Let’s go, I’m sure we’ll make a lot of headway now that you’ve cracked the curses.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry spoke in a loud, clear voice, making absolutely certain that as many people as possible in the Atrium heard him. And to be sure, there were surprised faces. That is not how they would’ve expected The Great Harry Potter to address Malfoy scum, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The ”Malfoy scum” hadn’t expected it either, that was clear from the startled look in Malfoy’s grey eyes. The mask fell back into place quickly, but Harry had caught it. <em>And enjoyed it. Hah! Let Malfoy learn that the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-Hotblooded can also have manners! A pureblooded snot like him should appreciate that — oh the sweet irony, I’m using their own tools to baffle him!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p><em>After all the soulsearching Harry had done, he actually </em> <b> <em>did</em> </b> <em> want to help Malfoy succeed — however, he wasn’t angelic enough to not draw pleasure from the fact that while they were waiting for their turn at the Floo fireplace, Malfoy threw some furtive looks his way which could only be described as ”slightly spooked”. Hah!</em></p>
