    <p>In the immediate aftermath of the war, Harry isolates himself. He can’t help it - he needs space to breathe. Thoughts swirl in his head, vying for attention. </p><p>People want to be near him and congratulate him. Harry doesn’t know how he feels - but ‘overwhelmed’ describes it pretty damn well. He needs quiet, which is impossible with the many voices all competing for attention. When a hand grabs his sleeve to pull him closer, his tolerance runs out. He looks the clamouring reporters and admirers in the eye and vanishes, without a spell or a wand. His magic is completely attuned to his needs: if only he had paused to think of the consequences of this little outburst. In the back of his mind, he knows he will be hounded - wordless <i>and</i> wandless magic? He can see the news headings now. They’ll say, ‘only Dark Wizards are capable of such deeds!’ and he’ll be feared for the rest of his life. </p><p>Deciding there won’t be anyone in the Forbidden Forest, Harry sets off. The trees don’t look quite as foreboding as they used to: nothing does; not since he died. However, he soon finds that even the forest cannot provide the respite he is craving since memories of the war are coming tumbling back. The tragedies he has faced are starting to sink in. He begins to shake. His magic echoes his unsettled state, it feels odd… jagged. </p><p>When he snapped he Elder wand, his magic felt alive. Rejuvenated. Harry didn't register it at the time, overwhelmed as he was with having finally won the war. </p><p>Currently, that power is making itself known. His magic is restless; it needs to be doing something. </p><p>Unexpectedly, it then shifts around his body and starts to heal all the wounds it comes across. Harry, who was never very good at healing spells, is stunned into quiet admiration. </p><p>Fueled by gleeful curiosity, Harry funnels his magic into healing a tree that was felled by one of the giants. He sends his magic into it, and he can see and feel the tendrils of golden light pulling the tree back together. It fits every individual piece of bark back together, without so much as a line where the halves had separated. He regards his power with newfound respect. He knows he’s capable of more still. </p><p>An owl hoots nearby and breaks Harry’s concentration. Harry hadn’t noticed the darkness creeping in, too concentrated on his magic. Had he subconsciously been supplementing his eyesight? Curious, he takes off his glasses. He feels a rush of magic to his eyes the surroundings gradually come into focus. </p><p>As intriguing as this is, Harry's body is tired. He can’t remember the last decent sleep he got, and the influx of power has left him physically and mentally drained. He sinks to the forest floor to sleep, lazily casting a reinforced Shield charm.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Green light clouds his vision as Harry shoots awake. For a few terrifying seconds, Harry is looking his death in the eye again, staring down the Killing Curse. He shakes his head to rid himself of the remnants of his fragmented sleep. When he surfaces fully from the memories of the nightmares, he realises his shield is still up. That’s unheard of - surely it should have dissipated by now. Harry wastes no further time and dives straight into exploring his magic. Harry being Harry, he gives himself a challenge and tasks himself to repairing Hogwarts. He Disillusions himself and walks back into the caste. </p><p>Hogwarts is truly in ruins. The gaping holes in the walls affect him deeply; this is his home, and a home should be safe. </p><p>He walks into the castle, remaining undetected. He tries to heal any visible wounds on the people he passes, then not so visible when he realises he can. Their gaunt faces gradually filling with happiness is reward enough for the Boy Who Lived. Harry walks on. </p><p>He debates going to the Great Hall, where all the injured and passed on are being treated or mourned, but decides against it. He isn’t ready to face the grieving families knowing he could maybe have stopped the war sooner. He doesn’t yet know where he fits in in terms of Ron and Hermione’s fledgeling relationship. When there are no more people in the corridors he walks through, he starts to heal Hogwarts and help it to heal itself. His magic can sense it’s grief and disarray. The castle lends him some strength, sensing he’s intent on rebuilding. While he’s healing the castle one brick at a time, he realises that with the strength the castle has given him, he can repair whole sections of the walls at a time. It’s cathartic. Shattered segments are moulded together again under his enraptured gaze. </p><p>Gradually, he becomes aware that he’s crying. While his mind surfaces from the challenge he has taken on, the magic surrounding his body gains a red hue. The reparations process stops. His extremities feel numb. </p><p>His magic is feeding off of his body to maintain enough energy for the immense feats it is performing. It desires power, it desires challenges. He slowly replaces the magic into his body and regains feeling. How? </p><p><i>No more feeding from me, got it?</i>, he says firmly to himself. Quickly, embarrassment takes a hold - he’s speaking to himself now apparently - and he blushes. He’s glad Ron wasn’t around to witness that. </p><p>The feeling of impatience doesn’t go away though, he needs more. He and his magic are one. He needs what it needs. </p><p>He suddenly refocuses his magic on the castle. It rejoices. The walls are repaired section by section, the flagstones glued back together by the strength of his magic. The castle is making things easier for him; people do not cross his path. His mind calms somewhat, his rational mind coming back into the fore. Hours fly by. </p><p>Harry comes across a person lying prone in an ill-used corridor. His magic reaches out to assess and revive. It determines that there is no pulse: the brain is dead. Harry moves closer. Any sympathy or grief he felt vanishes - the body is cloaked in a Death Eater robe. Overcome by a sudden fit of anger, Harry drains the body of its feeble residual magic. The body twitches as its magical core is depleted. Harry has no sympathy, merely curiosity as to how his magic will react to the absorption of someone else's power. With ease, apparently, as the cold, stolen magic quickly blends with his own. </p><p>The body does, though, remind him of the pointless killing that took place. That he took part in. </p><p>His magic reflects his grief, taking the form of a hurricane whipping around his body. This only stirs up his anguish rather than settling his mind. Harry labours under the onslaught of grief and misery. </p><p>His magic, confused by the volume and variety of his thoughts, directs itself instead towards healing. The swirling mass dissipates and he feels a tugging in his navel. He is led through the corridor. As he rounds a corner, he sees where the healing magic is directed. Towards one Draco Malfoy, who lies curled up amongst the rubble. </p><p>He stares listlessly into the middle distance, tear tracks running down his face. Harry stops. His magic stops, confused. It yearns to heal the broken boy. Why won’t Harry let it? Because Malfoy doesn’t deserve it, that’s why! He almost got many of his friends killed in their sixth year! </p><p>Malfoy suddenly turns his head towards a now-visible Harry, who has cancelled his Disillusionment charm. If possible, he seems to slump further. His magic is listless, pooling uselessly around his navel. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy was having difficulty accessing his magic, as it was buried deep inside his body. Harry pities him, but it doesn’t cancel out the weight of the boy’s actions. </p><p>His magic decides for him and reaches out to engulf Malfoy. Malfoy scrambles away from him, looking horrified at the sensation. Harry feels the reverberation of his pain: there aren't any glaring wounds, he's mostly been mentally affected. He senses the Cruciatus curse. He can empathise. His magic labours to help his mind, insistent when Malfoy continues moving away. Harry walks forwards slowly. He supposes he must look a bit terrifying, tendrils of magic weaving in and out without even a wand to conduct them. Malfoy halts as he reaches the section of the corridor that Harry hasn’t gotten to repair yet. He can go no further. He turns around slowly and prepares to fight, not accepting his death at the hands of the Golden Boy. Harry’s magic takes control and makes him stop, a subconscious body bind. </p><p>Harry doesn’t really want Malfoy terrified of him, so he sits down. He can’t think of anything else. </p><p>“It’s trying to help you.” He calls out, rather redundantly. Malfoy tries to open his mouth to snap a response but presumably thinks better of it. Harry drops the body bind.</p><p>He sighs. “Alright, Potter. Do your worst.” Harry’s magic doesn’t even wait for the sentence to finish before it surrounds him, seeping into his every pore and healing everything it comes across. Malfoy shudders. The half-formed sneer falls from his face. The sensation is like heat. It’s intense, it’s almost too much. Harry can see the gold sandstorm of his magic sweeping in and around Malfoy's stiffened form. </p><p>Then it recedes, and Malfoy stands taller. Harry droops slightly - he'd been focusing on not overloading Malfoy. His magic is not quite as restless as before. Attempting to heal Malfoy's mind had taken considerable effort. His magic had to be subtle and precise - a lot more thought was required than when he’d been testing how easily he could repair the castle. In contrast, Malfoy’s magic is now full of life, running freely throughout his body. Its colour is reflecting his newfound vivacity: it has changed drastically, from a murky grey to an icy blue. </p><p>Malfoy makes fleeting eye contact. “Thanks,” he says, consciously unclenching his jaw. Harry shrugs. He almost didn’t heal him after all. Harry walks around him and pieces the flagstones in the floor back together as he goes. This time, the process is less rushed. He is taking care to ensure that everything is exactly as it was. As such, he’s only a few meters ahead of Malfoy when he says snidely, “You’ll need to do more than that to fix Hogwarts. Honestly, do you know anything?” Harry whirls around. </p><p>“Is that so? Remind me what you’re doing to make amends for the mess <i>your</i> side made. Go ahead, Malfoy,” Harry spits. Malfoy is silent for a minute. </p><p>“Fuck,” he says, without anger. Harry stands in astounded silence. Malfoy, speechless? Ineloquent? <i>What?</i> “Potter, you’ve misunderstood. I simply meant that the spellwork imbued in the castle must also be paid attention to.” </p><p>Harry is the one at a loss for words now. “Oh. Er, thanks,” he says. He is reminded fondly of Hermione’s lectures about his refusal to read ‘Hogwarts: A History’. Unsure of anything else to say, Harry turns again to the walls and investigates the magic signatures within. At first glance, he had disregarded the weak, disconnected magic that barely held the bricks together. Now he could sense how the magic yearned to be strong again. It needed purpose, it wanted to become whole again. </p><p>Harry and his magic were enthralled. </p><p>He began, instantly feeding power into the floors, walls, and the roof. He took care not to bombard the weakened structure but to delicately weave the strings of magic back together. It was a slow process but one he found himself enjoying immensely. Soft gold strands of magic spider out from where the stream enters the stones. He reaches out to try and better channel his power. He feels a tingling in his fingers again. This time, it doesn’t feel malicious - he feels the magic working with him instead of draining him. </p><p>However, Harry is nearing exhaustion. He is so focused on the wall right in front of him that he fails to notice the strain of his magic spreading at an alarming rate throughout the castle. His mind is wrapped in the work. Whole corridors are being repaired, not just the one he stands in. The passing of time goes unnoticed by Harry, captured as he is by the magic. It is Malfoy who eventually tears his eyes away from the awe-inspiring event before him and notices how Harry’s eyes are closing, how his movements are getting clumsier and are slowing. </p><p>“Potter, give it a rest. You’re falling asleep in front of my very eyes.” Malfoy intones. Harry, startled, looks over at him. His magic has spread across multiple floors. As much as he is loath to pausing the reparations, it’s a bit too much. Instantly, he retracts his power from the castle. He stumbles due to the magnitude of magic that is instantly absorbed back into him. It hums in his veins. Black spots clear from the edges of his vision. </p><p>Only then does he realise Malfoy is right: he <i>is</i> tired. He sits down, leaning against the wall like Malfoy is doing just a few meters away. Tucking his legs in close, he tries not to think of the scarring events of the day before. His efforts, though, are fruitless. </p><p>He can hear the screams. The injuries and blood spilt sit waiting behind his eyes every time they close. </p><p>Once more he is walking towards his death. The grim acceptance of his fate washes over him again. He is drowning, unable to pull free from memories no one should ever be subjected to. </p><p>Bitter tears fall. His sobs are quiet; he is well aware that his once-enemy sits only metres to his left. His magic is turbulent, shifting restlessly around his motionless form. The storm of magic surrounding him has become murky and black, isolating him from his surroundings. His feelings of helplessness and terror are magnified. </p><p>He’s too tired. Too tired to have to deal with any of this. He’d rather curl up on the floor and sleep. Curling up, he achieves, but sleep is more elusive. The deafening noises from the war just won’t subside. </p><p>The sound of gentle crying lifts his thoughts from their vicious cycle. Malfoy is crying. Waves of guilt wash over him as he is reminded of their ill-fated duel. Even so, the sound of Malfoy crying eases him out of his head and back into the present. Just before he descends into sleep, he sends a Cushioning charm over to a still-sobbing Malfoy. His thoughts are slipping away when he dimly recognises one being cast in return.</p>
