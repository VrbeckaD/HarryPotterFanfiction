    <p>Harry slammed the door of his room in Number 12, Grimmauld Place, leaning back against the wooden surface, wincing at the sharp, stabbing pains in his forehead. An uncontrollable feeling of rage was swelling inside of him, dark and heavy, and he wanted nothing more than to scream and scream until it went away, or at least until he had some understanding of <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Why did he feel this way? Was he going insane? Was he finally losing his mind? Was Dumbledore right in his apparent decision that Harry couldn’t take being involved anymore? Was he breaking?</p>
<p>Another sharp pain shot its way through his skull, and he couldn’t hold back the moan of agony that escaped him, which only fueled his anger even further. His mind was racing, and suddenly through the pain he was thinking everything at once, the injustice of being left clueless in Privet Drive, Pettigrew’s escape, Voldemort’s return, that awful night, Cedric’s blank, unseeing eyes, his parents…</p>
<p>The pain reached its peak, and it was all Harry could do not to scream. He realized that at some point his body had slid down the door until he was sitting against it, but he couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t feel, until the sting of his fingernails piercing his palm-</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>He jerked reflexively away from the door, where Sirius’s voice came from the hallway.</p>
<p>“Harry, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, yeah, m’alright, just tired,” he stammered, trying to calm his breath.  </p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Yeah, I’m fine.” He held his breath, praying Sirius would brush it off.</p>
<p>“Alright… Molly’ll have dinner ready in an hour,” his godfather said tentatively.</p>
<p>“Okay! I’ll be down,” Harry said, trying to sound normal. He heard Sirius shuffle away down the hall and let out a breath of relief. He thought he’d managed to slip upstairs unnoticed, when the pain had started to overwhelm him, but Sirius had obviously sensed something had been wrong. He didn’t want Sirius, or any of the others, to see him like this, weak and broken.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how much longer he could go on like this. The past few months had been hell. No sleep, the little sleep he managed to get riddled with nightmares. No word from his friends, the people he called his family… they had just left him there. <em>You almost died again, watched a friend be murdered in front of you, were tortured by the fully-resurrected maniac who destroyed your family, and they didn’t believe you anyway, but oh well, have a good holiday, see you next year… </em></p>
<p>Wearily, Harry wiped the sweat off his brow, but felt a lot more moisture than he expected. Surprised, he looked at his hand and saw his palm covered in red. Blood trickled out of the crescent-shaped imprints his fingernails had left when he’d clenched his fist. Now that he’d noticed, he felt the stinging pain throbbing in his skin.</p>
<p>Cursing under his breath and holding his hand close to his chest, Harry went to his trunk and rifled through his belongings until he found a clean handkerchief. He used it to wipe the blood from his forehead, and then pressed it into his palm, wincing as the sting intensified.</p>
<p>Breathing steadily, and hesitating only for a moment, Harry applied more pressure to the wounds. The pain became sharper, but it was different from the pain that still lingered in his head. It was calming, almost… it sharpened his focus, brought him back to earth, made him feel a little less small. Harry realized he quite enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Gingerly, he ground his thumb into the handkerchief on his palm, and immediately felt the sting spread, inching outward into his fingers. His mind felt clear, his heart raced with the leftover adrenaline… he felt <em>alive</em> again.</p>
<p>The pain itself had peaked, and as the initial shock to his nerves subsided, he came back to himself. Guilt rose in him, and he stiffly wrapped the handkerchief around the width of his hand and worked it into a knot above his thumb.</p>
<p>He’d heard of Muggles his age doing similar things. Once he’d heard Dudley and Pierre laughing about a boy at Smeltings who had left his sleeve rolled up one day, revealing bunches of neat, white lines on his arm. <em>Disgusting,</em> Dudley had said.</p>
<p>Still… it had made him feel so grounded. It had made him feel… <em>in control. </em>And that was something he could barely remember ever feeling in his life.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. He glanced at the door, and on instinct, took out his wand and silently locked it. It would be easy enough for someone to unlock it and get in if they really wanted to, but it made him feel more secure.</p>
<p>Rolling up his sleeve, he looked intently at the bare, pale skin inside his elbow.</p>
<p>Was he really going to do this? Harry wasn’t sure why the idea was so appealing, but it was. He liked the idea of having control over whether he did it or not. He liked the thought of having a secret that Sirius and Remus and the others would be furious about if they knew. They all seemed to do nothing but keep secrets from him; why couldn’t he do the same? He had a right.</p>
<p>Steeling his nerve, Harry went back to his trunk, and rummaged until he found the pocket knife Sirius had given him.</p>
<p>He sat on the edge of his bed, rolled up his sleeve once more, and slowly raised the knife to press it into his flesh. He hesitated for only a moment. Gingerly, he pressed and pulled the blade across the inside of his upper arm, not quite hard enough to break skin, but the pressure was enticing. Breathing deeply, he tried it once more over the same spot, pressing a little harder until a sharp sting pulsed underneath his skin.</p>
<p>Panicking, he pulled the blade away quickly. He saw nothing at first. Then, slowly, blood beaded to the surface in tiny drops, the bright red striking against white. Harry watched, fascinated, as it slowly ran into the entire cut, a perfect red line. He raised a finger and gently brushed it across the cut, and stared at the small red smear left on his fingertip.</p>
<p>Harry felt his heart racing in his chest. He had made this. The small pain now burning in his arm had been his own doing. And he was the only one who knew.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>Suddenly eager, he raised the blade again to a spot right above the first cut, where the blood was gathering a little more thickly now, and dragged it ever so slowly in a line parallel to the first. The sting came more quickly and deeply now, but he expected it this time. The blood filled the wound faster, and gathered into a couple of bigger drops that almost seemed ready to stream down his arm.</p>
<p>Adjusted, Harry placed the knife to his skin for a third time, and then a fourth, and a fifth, until five bright red slices into his flesh were clustered neatly above the crook of his elbow.</p>
<p>The pain had spread from isolated little spots into the entire area surrounded his handiwork, a couple inches in diameter. It burned in his veins, and Harry sat and stared at them for a while, admiring them with a sense of pride.</p>
<p>A knock at the door sent Harry’s heart into his stomach, and he leapt up from the bed and threw his knife back into his trunk. “Just- just a second!” he called in a voice that probably sounded a little manic.</p>
<p>Mind going blank, he gathered himself enough to dab gently at his bleeding arm with the handkerchief still tied around his right hand. Satisfied, he yanked his sleeve back down to his wrist, wincing slightly at the friction of the fabric against his newly-mutilated arm. Catching his breath and trying desperately to replace any evidence on his face of what he’d been doing with polite curiosity, he unlocked the door and pulled it open.</p>
<p>Ron stood there with a slightly questioning expression. “Mum says dinner’s nearly done… wanted us to help lay the table.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, sure,” Harry agreed readily, inwardly cursing his excess enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Ron raised an eyebrow. “You alright, mate?”</p>
<p>Harry took a breath and shook his head. “No, yeah, I’m- I’m fine,” he said quickly. “Just tired.”</p>
<p>Ron gave him a once-over, but seemed to take his word for it. “Right, well, might as well get this over with. <em>Why </em>she couldn’t set it with magic, beats me…”</p>
<p>Letting out a silent breath of relief, Harry followed Ron to the stairs, letting the pain in his arm seep into him, looking forward to a normal evening.</p>
