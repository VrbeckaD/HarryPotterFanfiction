          <div class="userstuff"><p>For years you’ve been dancing around each other, ever since that first kiss in an alcove at a charity ball, neither of you courageous enough to make the next move. </p>
<p>It’s ironic, that all it finally took was the friendship between your sons, that the catalyst was your wives insisting you two start getting along.</p>
<p>If they only knew how well you get along now.</p>
<p>You’re not his first, nor is he yours, but when you’re with him, you feel as if you’re new. Like you can breathe. You forget about everything else. </p>
<p>Your wives. </p>
<p>Your kids. </p>
<p>What everyone would think. </p>
<p>Pressed up against your office wall, his hands everywhere, you don’t care that this is wrong, that everyone would object because of who you are. Because of who he is. </p>
<p>You let yourself pretend that this could be your life, that this could be the way it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p>As he breaches you for the first time your only thought is you should have done this sooner.</p>
<p>It’s almost comical how neither of you saw this coming.</p>
<p>The sounds he makes as he comes makes you ache for it to last forever.</p>
<p>When he leaves, you know it will happen again.</p>
<p>You’ve had your first taste of him.</p>
<p>You’ll never be able to stay away now.</p></div>
