  <span>"What? Wh...what are you talking about?" Harry stuttered. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Harry, listen. Please. You have to believe me. They are trying to go back in time to kill you." Draco pleaded. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They. The Death Eaters. After the Battle of Hogwarts, some of them had ran, some captured. Most died. They were no longer a threat. Their master was gone after all, they lost. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A few days ago, five of the captured death eaters from Azkaban had escaped. Ginny was a little worried, but Harry had comforted her. Azkaban is no longer as secure compared to the past. Ever since the betrayal of the Dementors, the Ministry of Magic had removed all Dementors from Azkaban and had just resorted to enchantments and spells to keep the prisoners in. The spells were enough to keep prisoners in jail, but there were still some people that managed to escape. But of course, the Ministry eventually did find them and imprisoned them again. "I mean sure, five is a lot compared to the past but the Ministry always finds them" Harry had said, but he was worried. Harry had a pit in his stomach ever since finding out that news but he couldn't let Ginny worry, she was pregnant with their first child after all. Harry had decided he would talk about this issue with Ron and Hermione during the Fifth Anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, there was going to be ball in Hogwarts to celebrate the day that they'd won the war. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Which brings us to the present. Draco had dragged Harry to the lavatory where the Chamber of Secrets was. This brings back memories, Harry thought bitterly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"This can't happen." Harry said. He had too much to lose, this can't happen. Not when things are finally getting better. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I know. And that's why I have a plan. You, me, Hermione and Ron." Draco whispered. "We are going to stop them. We are going back in time."</span>
