          <div class="userstuff"><p>“What are you up to?” Regulus asked warily as Sirius sauntered up to the door with a suspiciously happy look and her wand tucked in the back pocket of her muggle jeans. If their parents saw her in that there’d be another screaming match.</p>
<p>                “I‘m just going to greet your new boyfriend. Jonathon, right?” Sirius said happily.</p>
<p>                Regulus abandoned her make-up and desperately ran after her sister. “It’s Sebastian, and no you don’t I’m not having you driving him away.”</p>
<p>                The doorbell rings just as Sirius opens it, pulling out her wand, “Evening. Sebastian, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>                Regulus yanked the wand out of Sirius’s hand- or tried to as Sirius lifted it out of her reach, while Sebastian stammered. Regulus jumped, trying to grab the wand, but Sirius kept it out of reach.</p>
<p>                “I’m just seeing you two off. Have a good time. Oh, and Sebastian, honey. If you break her heart, I’ll hex your dick off.”</p>
<p>                Sebastian drew pale while Regulus turned red. “Why don’t you go shag your girlfriend and stay out of my love life!”</p>
<p>                “Reggie dear, Remus and I have a nice healthy relationship. We don’t need to spend every moment with each other,” Sirius told her with a patronizing smile before sauntering off like a boss.</p>
<p>                Sebastion swallowed. “Your sister is terrifying.”</p></div>
