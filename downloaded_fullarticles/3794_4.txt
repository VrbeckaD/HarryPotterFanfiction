    <p>I've been obsessed with this ship ever since I saw this fanart of it and I wanted to try out a fanfic! So here's my jeddy fanfic:)</p>
<p>I'm really excited to try this out, it's not a popular ship or anything, but it's cute. Okay. In here, James, Scorpius and Fred</p>
<p>are sixth years, Teddy and Victoire are seventh years. I de-aged Teddy so that I could have James and Teddy interacting at</p>
<p>Hogwars as well as at home. I hope y'all enjoy:)</p>
