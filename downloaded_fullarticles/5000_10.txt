          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy,” Astoria says softly, and then almost spills her teacup on her lap when Narcissa looks at her. </p><p>Normally such clumsiness would annoy her, but today it pleases her. </p><p>Narcissa knows what the girl is thinking; can read Astoria’s growing desire in every lingering look, every fumbling movement, every careful word. </p><p>It’s no secret to Narcissa that Astoria wants her, dreams about her. Narcissa doesn’t mind — she quite likes the thought of taking the girl for herself, and Astoria certainly is a pretty little thing. She’ll look lovely in Narcissa’s bed. </p><p>Astoria’s longing limns her sweet body, a smoldering fire that only Narcissa can see. A fire that first burned red, then orange as the girl’s lust slowly ignited. The flickering flame is now amber — Astoria’s in the middle of the spectrum.</p><p>But Narcissa wants the girl to burn white-hot with desire before she claims her, wants her to be so desperate that Astoria will combust at the lightest touch. </p><p>She wants Astoria to ache with need, unable to think of anything else. </p><p>Narcissa notices the dreamy expression in Astoria’s green eyes, and smirks to herself. </p><p>Maybe she doesn’t have that much longer to wait.</p></div>
