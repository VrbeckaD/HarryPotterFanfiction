    <p>1990</p><p>Dumbledore and the werewolf were having tea, so Severus was lingering in the dungeons in the hope that he could avoid bumping into said werewolf in the corridors. In a castle as vast as Hogwarts, the frequency with which Severus accidentally crossed paths with Remus Lupin was statistically impossible. Of course, Hogwarts was not a mere building, without obligation to the restrictions of physics let alone architecture, and the extent to which it controlled the destinies of its occupants was unknown but, Severus suspected, significant.</p><p>The damned place had never shown Severus any leniency, either. He didn’t pretend to prescribe simple human motivations on a centuries-old magical structure, and according to principles of houselore, Hogwarts was bound to have perpetually confused loyalties and motives, making it the magical space’s equivalent of a mad old aunt – generally benevolent, maybe; dangerously eccentric, certainly. If Severus didn’t have sentimental feelings about the old heap, he might have advocated more strongly for building anew, the way Durmstrang had when its original quarters began locking Professors in their offices and moving the most untidy students to the lawn while they slept.</p><p>Instead, Severus banked the coals of animosity that flared when he recalled the myriad injustices he’d experienced in the Hogwarts halls due to seeming coincidence, and dwelt on the fact that he was alive and not in Azkaban. Free to brew potions and suffer the constant torment that was teaching a delicate art to bumbling schoolchildren. Severus owed that to Dumbledore and his mad castle, respectively, in unknown shares.</p><p>“Professor,” Argus said just as Severus emerged cautiously from his quarters. Severus almost startled at the unexpected greeting, but years of espionage followed by years of potions accidents had rendered him largely immune to the physical counterparts of inner feelings and thoughts. Therefore, his body did not betray his shock, but he did allow his irritation to manifest in a quick scowl that came as naturally to him as breathing.</p><p>Argus, faced on a daily basis with the sight of Severus’s sneer, did not react. He continued to lean against the wall, looking rather less terrifying than he did when classes were in session, since there were no students about for him to intimidate. His hair was obviously recently washed and combed, his cheeks glowed in indication of a recent, close shave, and his robes were neat and orderly. Even Argus’s wizened cat had dampened the luminosity of her eyes and was sprawled on the rock floor at his feet, batting at a scrap of parchment that had been collecting dust where the wall met the floor. The elves worked with much less enthusiasm in the castle’s lower levels for inexplicable reasons.</p><p>“Dumbledore’s appointment has concluded,” Filch said, “and he would have a word with you.”</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes. “Carrying the old man’s messages, again?”</p><p>Filch didn’t acknowledge the question. “Maybe after, you’d be interested in seeing to the docks with me.”</p><p>Severus thought with longing about the leisure reading he’d been putting off while he had papers to mark and endless detentions to supervise. There were no fewer than three quarterly potions subscriptions with new issues he hadn’t yet had the opportunity to read. But as soon as he glanced at Argus’s carefully blank face, he knew he couldn’t say no.</p><p>“Yes,” Severus sighed. “But we may as well go after dinner. I’m sure it will take half the night, but that rogue Grindylow shouldn’t bother us since it’s supposed to be a clear night.” Moonlight repelled almost all of the unpleasant aquatic magical creatures, after all. Argus’s eyes crinkled very slightly in his version of a smile, but only for a moment. Then he nodded stiffly and ambled off. Mrs. Norris reluctantly abandoned her parchment scrap and trotted after him.</p><p>The least direct route to Albus’s office was a little-used, cramped back stairway that snaked around the base of Ravenclaw tower, then split into three dark corridors like a maze. There were some storage closets that Severus had once explored as a younger and more curious Professor, wishing he had known where they were when he’d needed a refuge from the pressures of being a half blood in Slytherin House, and also lacking the inherent qualities of a foot soldier.</p><p>Past the storage closet corridor was a wider hallway that permitted access between Ravenclaw Tower and the little known Ravenclaw Library, where the books that wouldn’t fit in the towering shelves of the common room and dormitories found their home, and where certain Ravenclaws studied as an alternative to the main library. The Hogwarts library was enormous and while it probably had a maximum capacity, it expanded at will when there was the slightest indication of crowding and even at the height of exam time when nearly every student was ensconced there, Severus had never known every table to be filled.</p><p>The Ravenclaw Library was probably appealing to Ravenclaw students for reasons Severus would never know without resorting to breaking and entering, which he wasn’t keen to do. Once, after a staff Christmas party wherein Flitwick had drank overmuch, Severus had tried to wheedle the mystery out of him, but Flitwick had expressed a sort of confused ignorance that might have been convincing if he hadn’t followed it up with a jovial wink.</p><p>It would be hypocritical of Severus to accuse Ravenclaw of hoarding resources and giving students unfair academic advantages. He didn’t conceal his preference for his snakes, nor shirk away from giving them exclusive information, advice and tutoring that he wouldn’t offer to students outside his house. But he imagined Minerva and Pomona would be chagrined, and were also too willing to believe that Ravenclaw Library was just a source of storage and not something else entirely.</p><p>At that moment – a surprising coincidence, if one believed in those – Filius emerged from the gleaming blue doors to the Ravenclaw Library, a golden haze erupting around the doorway so that what lay beyond it wasn’t visible. Severus rolled his eyes. Flitwick beamed at him in his characteristic way, and Severus felt equal parts warmed and annoyed, his characteristic response.</p><p>“Severus!” Filius exclaimed, cheeks ruddy with good cheer. Severus was familiar with the early-summer delirium that seemed to afflict all Hogwarts professors, for Severus was not immune to it himself. But it manifested most obviously in Flitwick, who seemed to struggle the most with the reserved professorial air that was part of the faculty culture at Hogwarts. His natural gregariousness was alarming to Severus, though not to the degree it had been during Severus’s first year teaching, when Flitwick had determinedly befriended him through a combination of dogged determination, Firewhiskey, and a terrible tendency to declare all Severus’s past wrongs and bigotry forgiven, then burst into happy tears.</p><p>Severus watched the doors swing silently closed behind Filius, seeming to come together and form a seal, the golden light winked out.</p><p>“It’s nearly lunch time! The morning quite got away from me!”</p><p>“Quite,” Severus acknowledged, dragging his gaze away from the doors to focus on Filius. His lips twitched in his approximation of a polite smile. Filius, appearing thrilled, adjusted his grip on the stack of books he was carrying. Severus’s eyes narrowed, trying to make out the titles – did they come from the Ravenclaw Library? Were they rarer even than what was kept in the special faculty section of the main library?</p><p>“Just found these old texts a student must have left,” Filius said, thrusting the books toward Severus rather than jealously guarding them like a secret.</p><p>Crestfallen, Severus let his eyes scan the proffered covers and saw that they were nothing more than the Charms, Transfigurations and Potions text books of some forgetful third-year.</p><p>“I’m off to the owlery to see about shipping them to her. Her name wasn’t written in them in the traditional sense, but apparently she had, ah, something of a crush on a faculty member, and I was able to deduce the student in question.” Filius had gone a little pink along the sharp ridges of his cheekbones. Severus grimaced. He really didn’t want to know.</p><p>“Good bye then, Severus. See you at dinner, I’m sure!” Filius bustled off, and Severus lingered in his study of the blue doors for only another moment before stalking along himself. He was bored. He knew that was the only explanation for a resurgence in his curiosity about the library. He wasn’t a Gryffindor; he was a Slytherin. He had accepted there were things under his nose that he had no need to know. But he had made his study of Hogwarts and its history something of a hobby over the years. It made him feel better about spending every school day within its walls and most of the holidays, too. It gave him a sense – though he would certainly never admit it to anyone – of being part of something, something old and significant.</p><p>Lost in these musings, he was surprised <em>again</em> by someone in the corridors. This time, his discomfort was so great that for the briefest moment, his lips parted in shock before he clenched his jaw shut again.</p><p>“Lupin.”</p><p>“Ah, Severus,” said the werewolf, in the same awkward way he had during each of their “accidental” encounters over the years. Like he wanted to apologize for every injustice he’d ever stood aside for, but sensed – correctly – that his sentiments would be unwelcome. “How is your summer going?”</p><p>“We’re only a week in,” Severus observed dryly. “But it has been as dreadfully uneventful as ever.”</p><p>“Ah,” Remus said, avoiding eye contact and nodding with much more vehemence than the meaningless exchange deserved. “I’ll just be going, then. Already running late.”</p><p>Severus’s lips compressed. “Indeed.” Quite late! Severus had heard from Argus at least twenty minutes ago that Dumbledore was done with Remus, and he had deliberately taken the course that would be least likely to result in this very encounter…</p><p>Severus’s eyes narrowed at a sudden thought. Perhaps Lupin, familiar with the castle’s many routes himself, had <em>also</em> looked for a path that would be unlikely to be occupied by someone housed in the dungeons. This far corner of the castle, near Ravenclaw Tower, a safe distance from the library, Great Hall, and even the entrance to Dumbledore’s office.</p><p>“Good bye, then, Lupin,” he said crisply, and watched Remus nod his unkempt head a few more times before making a grateful escape. Severus took a moment to gather himself, then continued at a brisk pace to the Headmaster.</p><p>“Severus, my boy,” Dumbledore exclaimed as Severus ascended the staircase. Dumbledore had been writing, and must have almost been ready to finish whatever correspondence he was composing, because the little trio of barn owls that delivered all his ordinary mail were perched on the floo mantle, bickering with one another over who would have the honor of taking the letter.</p><p>“Headmaster,” Severus replied with his ordinary degree of stiffness, taking his usual chair across Dumbledore’s desk. Most would take the one closest to the door, but he preferred the other one, which prevented anyone entering without his notice.</p><p>“I have terrific news,” Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling even more than they usually did. Severus braced himself.</p><p>“It seems Harry Potter has demonstrated magical ability,” Dumbledore declared, in the tone of someone who is not surprised, but satisfied to be proven correct.</p><p>“As though there was ever any real doubt,” Severus muttered. The Potters had famously never produced a Squib, and while such things could be covered up, considering the delight other Pureblood families would have taken in disproving the claim, Severus thought it was likely true. Further, the child had survived a killing curse and bore a curse scar to prove it. Powerful, natural accidental protective magic seemed like the only possible explanation.</p><p>“Further, I am under the impression that Lily Evans Potter is amenable to enrolling Harry at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Startled, Severus’s customary frown deepened. “Lupin just informed you of all this?” That seemed unlikely. For all his faults, Lupin was presumably a good friend, and counted Lily among his closest. He couldn’t imagine him reporting on her every whim and inclination, when he wouldn’t even directly confirm to Dumbledore that she was in touch with him at all.</p><p>“Not in so many words. It was a careful deduction.” Dumbledore waved a hand dismissively. Severus studied the Headmaster thoughtfully as he busied himself signing his letter and rolling up the parchment to prepare it to be sealed. He wondered if Dumbledore had permitted himself a bit of nonconsensual legilimency. It wouldn’t align well with Dumbledore’s scruples, but over the years Severus had noticed that Dumbledore could be very ruthless in concluding that certain means were justified by certain ends. And he had plans for the Potter boy, that much had been evident for some time.</p><p>Severus found he cared not at all for the idea of Lily’s child. He was incontrovertible evidence of her choice of husband made human. In Severus’s imagination, the boy was a clone of James, a waste of Lily’s time and potential. It didn’t make sense to loathe James Potter, a dead man, just as fervently as Severus had when he was alive. Some would say the circumstances of James’s death – standing between the dark lord and his infant son, begging for the boy’s life – should absolve James of his childhood sins where Severus was concerned. But Severus had long since ceased measuring himself by ordinary human standards. He knew his personality was particularly black and particularly unforgiving, and he didn’t see the utility in struggling against his tendencies.</p><p>“Is this why you asked me here?” Severus rarely felt <em>comfortable</em> around Dumbledore, but right now he was trying not to fidget, as awkward as a student. His thoughts strayed toward Lily far too frequently for him to lose his composure entirely when she was brought to mind, but there was still something emotionally invasive about hearing someone else speak of her, even indirectly. He’d nearly <em>cried</em> several months before when Filius had made a passing remark about Lily’s latest published article on the long-term effects of blood magic on different types of wood, wherein she made some very intelligent correlations to wandlore, though it wasn’t her area at all…</p><p>“I knew you would be pleased,” Dumbledore said, clearly mistaking what Severus feared was a fond and absent expression on Severus’s face for something related to a Potter. Automatically, Severus scowled and shrugged.</p><p>“I don’t really care one way or the other,” he lied. He would greatly prefer for the boy to attend school somewhere – anywhere, else. Even the prospect of catching a glimpse of Lily was more painful than exciting. He felt nauseated at the thought of being reduced back to the pathetic teenager, observing Lily’s smile and hearing her laughter bestowed on other students, while he lurked in the shadows like some kind of unwanted animal…</p><p>“I only thought, given your particular friendship with the boy’s mother, you might…” something Dumbledore observed in Severus’s face had him fall into thoughtful silence, stroking the end of his beard, the twinkle going still in his eyes. Then he gestured to the owls and said, “Here, Pinkett,” and one of the trio fluttered over to him with a soft hoot, while the other two ruffled their feathers, apparently dejected.</p><p>The owl flapped its wings furiously after the scroll had been attached to its leg, rising quickly up the soaring ceiling of the office toward a narrow skylight that was charmed to allow owls to pass from the inside out. After a few moments the other two owls followed at a slower pace, presumably back toward the owlery.</p><p>“Perhaps a letter from a friend would ease her decision,” Dumbledore said. “She does not trust me to watch over her son, I’m afraid. But perhaps you…”</p><p>“She’s more likely to see my presence as a deterrent than an attraction,” Severus murmured.</p><p>“Mmm,” said Dumbledore, beginning to eye his candy jar in a familiar way. He lasted a full three seconds, which was two seconds longer than Severus would have guessed, before he reached out a long-fingered hand and lifted the lid. “Lemon drop?” he asked Severus.</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes. “Have I ever said yes?” he sighed.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled, popping a candy into his mouth and winking unreservedly at Severus. “I was carefully trained in good manners, I’m afraid,” was his apology. The two men sat in silence for a period, then Severus admitted: “I wouldn’t know where to owl her. I have not been…successful, in the past.”</p><p>What led him to admit that he had written Lily letters, Severus couldn’t say. But he felt a degree of relief at telling someone. He had sent them to the corners of the world by the cumbersome international method, where postmen hand-delivered bundles of letters by a combination of apparition, floo, flight and boat, then sent local rented owls when the recipients were within range. But it required the sender hazard a guess as to where the recipient might be. Severus had also, of course, exhausted a range of hardy owls intermittently, and they had presumably scoured much of western Europe at his bidding, but always returned harried and with his letters still firmly tied to their legs.</p><p>Albus was watching him very closely, Severus saw. Over the years, they had not had occasion to test Dumbledore’s belief in Severus’s loyalty. Neither man believed the war was truly won – rather, in a long and periodic stasis – but their enemy was long hidden, perhaps even dead. Severus’s opportunity to prove himself to be on the light side had yet to come.</p><p>Yet in a remarkable moment of trust, Dumbledore extracted a second lemon drop from his candy dish, and told Dumbledore that Lily and her son were in MACUSA territory, though Dumbledore himself did not know more than that.</p><p>Dismissed, Severus roamed the Hogwarts halls aimlessly. Every time he had sent a letter before, he had been relieved when it came back. Sometimes his relief was more profound than others, because his letters ranged from hideously emotional, when written in one of his weaker periods, to rather <em>too</em> detached and matter-of-fact, which he only slightly preferred. Through a combination of his natural character and the circumstances of his adult life, Severus had only been close to one person in all his years on Earth, and while the powerlessness of that fact frustrated him, he could never feel truly ashamed of loving Lily.</p><p>Sometimes when Severus read her more philosophical work on the arbitrariness of “dark” and “light” magic labels, he felt a paralyzing, terrible hope that it indicated some sort of forgiveness for Severus himself. As a teenager, Lily had abhorred what she perceived to be “dark.” As an adult, she appeared to feel differently. But he doubted her feelings about marked Death Eaters had changed overmuch because, unlike Severus, Lily had always known exactly where to find her first best friend. If she wanted to send him a letter, she would have.</p><p>Trelawney had descended from her tower to join them for dinner. She was no more likely to do so during the holidays than she was during term, and when she did, she was sure to do her best to terrify someone at the table with a vague and terrible prediction. Severus stood in the Great Hall entrance, watching her take her seat, and then abruptly rerouted toward the dungeons. He would take dinner in his rooms. Before he could get very far, Minerva McGonagall’s voice stopped him.</p><p>“Avoiding our resident ‘seer’, as well, Professor Snape?”</p><p>He shot her a look over his shoulder. She was carrying what looked suspiciously like a shrunken picnic basket. She jerked her chin in a “follow me” gesture as she turned and began walking away.</p><p>Severus knew what this was. He considered for a long moment, his strong tendency to protect himself from social interaction warring with the part of him that was curious – and, yes, flattered – and then he followed Minerva through the corridors, out a side exit and down a short, mossy stone staircase where the Great Lake lapped against the castle walls. There, where a naturally formed slab of rock jutted out into the water, Pomona Sprout was clumsily transfiguring rocks into a table and chairs.</p><p>She lowered her wand in relief at the sight of Minerva.</p><p>“Oh, thank goodness. You do it,” she suggested, smiling brightly at Severus. “Professor Snape! You’re joining us! How lovely!”</p><p>She seemed to mean it, Severus thought as he responded with a wary nod.</p><p>“What about Filius?” a third voice popped up, and when Severus turned he found that Poppy Pomfrey was also making her way toward the water’s edge, cradling a very large bottle of wine.</p><p>“He’s certain to take pity on poor Sybil, and have dinner with her in the Great Hall,” Minerva said grimly.</p><p>“Perhaps we all should…” Pomona began tentatively, and she earned three sharp looks and, from Minerva and Poppy, a perfect chorus of “No.”</p><p>Relieved, Severus accepted the chair Minerva produced for him, and watched in some trepidation as she unshrunk the basket and spread out a simple meal of bread and cheese. It was surprisingly simple fare. Seeing his raised brow, Minerva chuckled.</p><p>“The key ingredient, this evening, is of course the alcohol.” She drew four wine glasses from her basket with a slight flourish, and winked at him.</p><p>Absorbing the surreal scene before him, made all the more incredible by <em>Minerva McGonagall’s wink</em>, Severus watched Pomfrey uncork her wind bottle with a wandless spell, and pour out with a heavy hand.</p><p>Severus had never been invited to the lakeside dinners before, though he knew they were taking place. He didn’t want to enjoy being included this much, but he felt his heart thudding as though he was ten years old and included at the most exclusive cafeteria table. And, of course, he hated himself through every minute of it.</p><p>Well, until they had made it through several glasses each, whereupon Severus’s reserve had receded to a point where he reached out and snatched the bottle from the center of the table and tilted it suspiciously to and fro in front of his face.</p><p>“It’s still more than half full,” he said thoughtfully. “Replenishing charm, or…?”</p><p>“Well spotted,” said Pomfrey. “Very common in medicine containers. But it isn’t bottomless, so be sure you share.”</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes, then diplomatically topped off everyone else’s glass before his own.</p><p>“Still seeing that gentleman of yours, Pomona?” Pomfrey wanted to know. Startled, Severus looked over at Sprout, whose face had gone rather rosy. She brushed her curls out of her face.</p><p>“We’re on a bit of a hiatus,” she said lightly. “He wanted to travel over the holidays, but I have a batch of mandrakes that were rather late maturing I have to monitor.”</p><p>Pomfrey stared. “You do realize any second year could harvest mandrakes, Pomona. Let alone any one of your friends on the staff.”</p><p>Sprout shrugged.</p><p>“It’s better to be direct, if you want to end things,” Minerva declared. Her voice, Severus thought, seemed to become both higher and sharper the more she drank. Which was quite a lot, so far, with occasional disparaging comments about why anyone would choose to drink wine over whiskey.</p><p>“Minerva would know,” Pomfrey said, with a sly grin. “Our resident heartbreaker.”</p><p>Minerva was nonplussed. “Relationships are rather transactional for me. I am not a romantic person, nor do I desire or require constant companionship.”</p><p>“And they say Gryffindors mate for life!” Pomona hooted.</p><p>“No, no, that’s Slytherins,” Pomfrey said, and at once they all looked at Severus, who had been trying to melt into the background during this particular bit of conversation.</p><p>“Never heard it said,” he managed, rather coolly, considering.</p><p>“It’s Purebloods, regardless of their house,” supplied Minerva, rescuing him – deliberately, it would seem, considering she <em>winked. Again</em>. Severus was going to develop indigestion. He reached for a slice of bread and tore a piece off, stuffing it in his mouth so no one could try to make him talk. “A Pureblood, I am not,” Minerva continued.</p><p>None of their assemblage was, Severus noted, and not for the first time.</p><p>“What about you, Severus?” Pomfrey asked, fixing him with a long, interested look that clearly communicated how little she minded embarrassing him. “You’re young! Surely you have your own trail of broken hearts.”</p><p>Severus snorted. “Hardly,” he said. Why was he encouraging them? He’d really had too much to drink.</p><p>“Professor Snape is very career minded,” Pomona remarked in a kindly way, as though she was describing an unfortunate but treatable medical condition.</p><p>“But it’s summer!” Pomfrey insisted. “Summer is the time for romance. Or whatever Minerva calls it.”</p><p>“Sex,” Minerva said, and the other two women burst into laughter while Severus felt his entire face become red and hot.</p><p>“I just remembered,” he said, standing abruptly, “that I am supposed to be helping Mr. Filch this evening. With the boats.” He had never been so happy to remember a prior commitment.</p><p>Still grinning and wheezing, Pomfrey rolled her eyes. Minerva arched a brow. Pomona gave him a pitying look.</p><p>They thought he was lying!</p><p>“I shall…see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“What is it that Mr. Filch needs?” Pomfrey asked innocently.</p><p>“Boats. The boats are, ah, in need of a scrape. We do it every June.”</p><p>“Do you?” Pomona asked, as though he had just revealed something fascinating. “What else does he do? I have never really understood Mr. Filch’s role.”</p><p>Minerva looked at Pomona in amusement. “You mean you had thought he had no purpose, aside from very ineffective nightly patrols that the prefects are meant to do, anyway?”</p><p>“The first years fear him, and fear can be useful,” said Pomfrey.</p><p>Severus felt a sudden need to defend Argus. “He completes a number of tasks that the house elves will not. And supervises the house elves, to a certain extent.” It did sound feeble when he said it out loud.</p><p>“Dumbledore likes him,” said Pomfrey, as though that explained everything.</p><p>“It’s good for the children to see a Squib in society,” Pomona said, then tentatively added, “though I’m not sure Mr. Filch’s particular job is…”</p><p>“Real?” Minerva asked.</p><p>Pomona blushed, clearly loathe to imply anything unkind. Severus glared at Minerva and started to leave, but to his surprise all three women leapt to their feet to follow him.</p><p>When he looked back, annoyed, Pomfrey said, “Surely the help of four people is preferable to just one?”</p><p>Severus sighed, and they trailed after him toward the boathouse, where they didn’t bother to conceal their unanimous surprise when they found Argus Filch bent over a boat with a wire brush, scowling up at Professor Snape as soon as he heard them coming.</p><p>“A bit late, aren’t you?” He took in the three women and his sour expression didn’t falter. “Come to watch, did they?”</p><p>Severus shed his robes and rolled up his sleeves. “We’re all here to help, Argus,” he said, and couldn’t contain a tiny smile when he turned to face his colleagues. “Isn’t that right?”</p><p>“Can’t use magic,” Argus said. “Hard on the wood.”</p><p>Maybe it was and maybe it wasn’t. Severus had never investigated the claim. He took another brush from the pail and tossed it to Minerva. When she blinked at him, startled, Severus couldn’t help it – he winked.</p><p>A slow, pleased smile spread over Minerva’s face, and then she cleared her throat, drawing her own sleeves up toward her elbows. “Certainly. We’re here to help. A little manual labor can be quite refreshing, I’ve found.”</p><p>Pomfrey was the last one to pick up a brush. By the time she did, everyone but Severus had begun scrubbing the overturned boat with varying levels of enthusiasm. She met Severus’s eye and smirked.</p><p>“You’re all right, Sev,” she declared.</p><p>“Summers are so strange,” said Pomona.</p><p>“Indeed,” sighed Severus, and joined them.</p>
