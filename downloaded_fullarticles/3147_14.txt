</p><p>"Hey Pans," I greeted, as she walked into the common room. </p><p>"Why are you so happy?" She asked, curiosity colouring her voice. </p><p>"No reason," I replied, not being able to keep the grin off my face. </p><p>"Yeah, well," she said, pulling her phone out, "is this why?" </p><p>And there was a picture of me. And Harry. Snogging. Outside of the common room. Fuck. </p><p>"Uhm. Pans, How have you got that?" </p><p>She sighed, looking at her manicured finger, "Some Ranvenclaw girl took an picture of you two, and posted it all over Instagram. So, basically the whole school knows." </p><p>"I really don't get muggle technology, but... the whole school knows? Like.... everyone?" </p><p>She nodded, and put a hand on my shoulder, trying to soothe me. I knocked it away. "I'm sorry Draco." </p><p>"Don't be." </p><p> </p><p>Harry was eating in the Great Hall when Draco came up to him, everyone's beady eyes on them. "We need to talk." </p><p>Draco grabbed his hand and dragged him out of the room. "The whole school knows about us, Harry."  </p><p>"I know," he said, calmly. </p><p>"So the picture of us kissing is all over whatever you call it?" Draco demanded, actually looking upset, his silver eyes watering.</p><p>"Instagram," Harry said. "And yes. Everyone knows. I still really like you Draco. I still want to be your boyfriend." </p><p>Draco sighed, walking over to Harry and resting his head on his shoulder. Harry rubbed Draco's back soothingly and kissed his forehead. He heard a small mutter, the words barely audible. </p><p>"Fuck muggle technolgy."</p></div>
