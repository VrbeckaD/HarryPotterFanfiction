    <p>When I was a little girl, my grandfather told me of a war that was yet to happen. All the muggles would find out about magic on a global scale, which would result in a long and debilitating war with mass casualties and devastating consequences for both sides. He taught me to prepare; to live seamlessly in both muggle and magical worlds. He gave me the tools to survive and thrive in any environment; skills I practiced, honed and perfected well after his passing. He taught me how to cloak my magic so that even other magicals would think me muggle. He taught me how to connect seamlessly with my magic; to be able to call it forth with naught but a single thought and a twitch of a finger. He taught me how to use <em>the sight</em> to my best advantage and he raised me to be a strong independent witch.</p><p>Nobody ever hid the fact that they thought my grandfather a senile old fool. They spoke the words to his face when he tried to warn them what was to come. That though the war was started by muggles, the downfall to all would be caused by wizards. But he and I, we knew the truth. He saw the future and it scared him. He knew he wouldn’t live to see the end of the war, but he wanted to give me the best chance. The wizards would soon become desperate to end the war they so arrogantly assumed they would win and would bring upon a plague that would affect both the living and the dead.</p><p>My grandpa gave me the greatest gifts anyone had ever given me: knowledge, determination and an iron strong will. My name is Indiana Torrez and this apocalypse ain’t got nothing on me.</p>
