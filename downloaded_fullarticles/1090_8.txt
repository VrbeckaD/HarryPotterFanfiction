  <strong>August 2001</strong>
</p>
<p>The steaming cuppa was very much needed today, and Bill inhaled the strong scent of the Welsh tea blend he preferred with a happy sigh. The first of three full moon nights has been straining. He could feel the pull of the moon in his blood growing and knew tonight was going to be even worse. One more day at work though and it will be the weekend so he didn't see the point in taking the day off. He just hoped that he could keep his temper in check with the new person coming in today for their induction, to finally fill in the investigator role that their department needed desperately since the end of the war.</p>
<p>Much has changed for all of them in the past three years. After the war, the British Wizarding society took some time to repair itself. His family took time to mourn the loss of Fred, though Bill still felt a pang in his chest at the thought of his deceased brother. He was the eldest and had been there for the birth and the first years of all his siblings, and loved them dearly. Of course George was inconsolable in his grief for a long while but Bill was glad to see the remaining twin back in business and now mostly having good days with only a few bad days in between. Mum and dad were getting on a bit now and sometimes he worried about mum. She was proud of all of them, he knew, but the stress of the war did her no good and while she was still bustling about to make them all happy and keep the renovated Burrow running, he could see she missed having a full family home. Dad was doing better than ever as the new Deputy Prime Minister under Kingsley, which helped ease Bill's worries over their parents pension. Between the six of the remaining children, his parents would never need for anything anyway. But at least now with the good income and less expenses, they could afford to travel, make savings, and keep renovating their home.</p>
<p>As for Shell Cottage, that was another story. He looked around his new home and while there was a part of him that missed the peace at the sea side cottage, his new cottage near Penderyn in Wales was much more suited to him. He was surrounded by the Brecon national park and loved running in the fields and forests, away from the small villages and in the wilderness. The paperwork for his divorce with Fleur was finalised six months ago and honestly he felt a sense of relief. As time went by after Greyback's attack, he felt the wolf part of himself growing stronger and merging with his mind and body in unexpected ways. He would never transform physically, he wasn't by any means a full lycanthrope, but he had several of the wolfish traits. He used to enjoy the dangerous side of being a curse breaker, but now he revelled in it in a more primal way. He preferred his meat very much on the rare side, occasionally a blue steak during the full moon helped settle what he suspected was an element of blood-thirst. His temper was a little bit more pronounced around the full moon but simmered under the surface most of the time if pushed hard enough.</p>
<p>All these changes and Bill's increased wildness led to the failing of his marriage. Fleur grew displeased with him for always running outside, and her inner-Veela distrusted his unstable wolfish side, preventing her from conceiving a child despite it being her dear wish. So she packed her bags and left, leaving a note to expect the divorce papers. At the time, Bill was devastated at the loss of a wife and his pack but now he accepted that it was better for them both. As far as he knew, Fleur was engaged again and happy these days, and he wished her all the happiness he could never give her.</p>
<p>He looked down at his hands, wrapped around the hot mug, slim and long fingers that held more strength than one would think at first sight. He adjusted the bandage around his middle-finger that covered a deep cut that was healing slower than most of his other scrapes. He could swear he had grown another inch after the attack and was an impressive 6' 3" of strong sinewy build. He has always been active but since he began running in the woods much more and eating more protein, his body continued to grow stronger and warmer. Apparently it was another wolf trait, running a few degrees higher than the regular human body temperature. Poppy was very helpful when she gave him his annual check up a few months ago and suggested how to deal with some of the changes that he was undergoing.</p>
<p>He rotated his head slightly and clicked a few tense spots before finishing his tea and putting on his waistcoat. The goblins in Gringotts preferred wizarding suits to robes due to the impracticality of long robes and their small frames. Bill had spent several years out in Egypt on digs in a ratty pair of jeans and a long sleeve top to keep the sun at bay, and rarely had the chance to wear a suit. He always looked clean in fitted trousers, shirt and a waistcoat but he wasn't going to suffer the stuffy summer in a blazer as well. He snapped his gold shirt armbands into place to keep his sleeves down and headed for the fireplace.</p>
<p>He flooed over to his office and charmed the soot off himself before stepping in and looking at the memos already awaiting in his inbox. He had a quick browse through them and prioritised them according to urgency before he returned to his currently open case of a derelict vault that has passed into the bank's ownership a week ago and needed to be assessed for any curses and dark magic. He was well into his report when a rapid knock on his door interrupted his work.</p>
<p>"Come in," he called, perhaps a little more forcefully than he intended to, stumping down the impatience in his blood. Merlin he couldn't wait to run tonight…</p>
<p>Grindung, one of the executive managers, stepped in with a familiar-looking blond close at heel. All Bill could focus on however was the scent that hit him the moment the door opened. A wolf. No, not a full lycan. A lyco, a part wolf like himself. Someone like him who smelled of human, and the sea, and the earthy wolf. His head snapped up and he suppressed the deep growl that was attempting to climb up from within his chest.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>He stood and walked around his table, barely listening to the introductions Grindung made, announcing that the blond would be joining their department as the new investigator. His attention was however diverted to the light shine to Draco's eyes when their gaze met, hinting at the animal inside that could see in the dark. He could feel his magical core reaching out to the blond curiously but reigned himself in. This was neither the time, nor the place.</p>
<p>When Grindung lapsed into silence following the introduction, Bill forced his muscles to cooperate and extended his hand to the blond. "Pleasure to meet you," the appropriate thing to say, though he was surprised at the deep gravel in his voice.</p>
<p>Draco suppressed a shudder and accepted the offered hand, forcing himself to not show any outward sign of the prickling magic that danced across his skin at the physical contact. An alpha, he just met a lyco alpha and he was equally excited and terrified. No one knew what he had to go through when the Dark Lord took over his household, and very few people knew that he was a lyco himself. This was more than unexpected.</p>
<p>The time when his house was occupied by the evil lord and saturated with dark magic were the worst months of his life. Not only was father too weak to protect mother and himself, but he also allowed the other Death Eaters to treat them like dirt. He could never forget the look in his mother's eyes after he punched Avery to get him off her immobilised form. The bastard liked to do that, petrify women from the neck down and listen to them plead as he took what he wanted form their bodies. After that incident, Avery was so furious with him that he and Lestrange took their revenge on him in the most cruel of ways.</p>
<p>One night they sneaked into his room and past his wards to petrify him and throw him to the wolves, quite literally. When they locked him in the dungeons with Greyback and his lot, Draco knew he was going to either die or leave scarred for life, and he wasn't ready to die just yet. So he fought and screamed, and used magic where he could to fend the pack off, praying that they would stay at kicks and punches and verbal abuse. Sadly it was to no avail. The violent alpha bit his thigh viciously, and though it wasn't a full moon, he could feel the infection take hold in his blood and alter his very being.</p>
<p>When the war finally ended, his father got the dementor's kiss for his crimes and his mother died of an unknown curse, leaving him an orphan with barely any social standing, and less than half of the once grand Malfoy fortune left. It took him three years to finish his N.E.W.T.s and complete a Mastery in runes and artefacts so he could once again build the Malfoy family name while Malfoy industries pulled through and began making profit again. And as everyone healed and the society recovered, so did his social standing and his faith in having a somewhat normal life some time soon.</p>
<p>Even though it was expected of him to marry either Pansy or some other pureblood lady, he never did and decided to finally live true to himself. He never had a preference really but lately found himself drawn towards men more so than women. Nevertheless he remained single, it wasn't as if once whoever he was with found out about his bite, they would stay with him long. He knew that Greyback had bitten a lot of people, turning some into werewolves, changing others into the part-lycan state of never being full wolf or human like himself, but he never actually met any of them before. Now that he was standing in front of one, he didn't know how to deal with the fact that instead of running, all he wanted to do was stay and get closer, drawn to the man before him like a moth to a flame.</p>
<p>"Likewise," he finally pulled himself together enough to respond before they let go of each other, his palm still tingling.</p>
<p>With a last look they parted ways and Bill watched as Grindung led the blond to his new office, right across from Bill's, to settle in. Bill closed his door again and leaned against it heavily, trying to calm his racing pulse. He met several lycos since the war but hasn't yet met one that he wanted to form a pack with or get closer to. And not all of those he had met were alphas either, some were betas searching for a suitable alpha like himself. This felt different. The blond wizard didn't feel like a threat but rather….prey? Maybe, he wasn't sure. He wanted to give chase instead of harming the blond, and that feeling was so unfamiliar he had to sit down and slowly calm down his heart beat. It would however appear that he was to get no reprieve as an hour later, just as he was finally finding his focus, Grindung led the blond back into his office.</p>
<p>"I have a deposition to attend at the Ministry, so I shall leave Mister Malfoy with you, William. I would appreciate if you finished his induction," he said with a severe look, clearly displeased that he had to leave for the court on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>"I will do my best before I have to leave for a case review as well," Bill replied politely and motioned for Draco to step inside the office as the goblin closed the door, his footsteps rapidly leaving Bill's office.</p>
<p>There was a beat of silence between them before Draco unwisely took two steps closer and Bill stiffened, a small growl rising in his throat. The blond instantly stilled and had to keep himself from presenting his throat to the alpha, worried that a single movement could make him jump.</p>
<p>Bill gripped the side of the table where he stood, barely managing to stop himself from advancing on the blond. Draco was rooted to the spot where he stood by the office door. He consciously knew he would have to leave, but it appeared he couldn't move. As much as he wanted to run in the other direction, his body was calling out to the alpha now that they were alone and in such close proximity. His pulse was racing, he could feel a bead of sweat travel down between his shoulder blades as he tried to calm himself. And when he noticed the golden flecks in the redhead's blue eyes flash brightly, he knew that the alpha was aware of his desire.</p>
<p>Bill could smell the change in the delicious scent rolling off the blond. That scent, it was new but not unfamiliar. His senses finally registered what it was that he was smelling and he nearly groaned in delight. The blond was an omega, and he was aroused. Fuck. That realisation made him grit his teeth tightly as he tried to stop himself from giving chase. It would be just his luck that he would meet a deliciously smelling omega when he least expected it and the moon had a hold on him.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Gringotts. I'm afraid your induction will have to resume on Monday morning at 7.00 o'clock," he managed to force himself to speak the words slowly but with clear command. "Please excuse me, I am on my way out as well," he added, hoping the blond would take the hint and leave any second now before his resolve broke.</p>
<p>Draco opened his mouth to tell him that he wanted to stay but realised that resisting the clear command would push the man which didn't currently feel very wise. Finally finding his feet, Draco took half a step back and fumbled with the door handle, eyes never leaving the alpha across the room as he continued to back away and exited mutely.</p>
<p>Once the door was closed and their connection broken, he shuddered, forcing his muscles to release some of the tension in his limbs. He didn't expect this. It was supposed to be his first job after graduation and it was meant to set him up in a good position to re-build the Malfoy name. William Weasley was…. he shuddered again, closing his eyes for a moment in memory of that wild magical energy and raw power in those sparking eyes. The most frightening part however was that deep inside he knew this man was exactly what he needed in his life, even if he gets hurt during the chase.</p>
