He was happy that they were, he headed upstairs. When he got to the loft he open the door. When he walked in, he was met with the cutest sight.</p><p>Elena was on the couch stretched out asleep with her godson Teddy asleep on her chest. They were watching Teddy for the weekend. Elena wanted to be very active in Teddy's life.<br/>
Elena and Teddy had a lot in common. Both lost their parents in a war and were children of Marauders. Elena called Teddy her cub just like Remus called her.</p><p>He walked over to them and slowly picked up Teddy without waking Elena up.
