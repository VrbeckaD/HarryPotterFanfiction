    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The first class of the term was slightly nerve racking and what made it worse was that it was seventh years. Being thrown in at the deep end was not Remus’s ideal start to his first year teaching at Hogwarts, but he didn’t whine about it, he needed this job so he would just do as he was told and not complain about anything. </p>
<p>     The class began settling in and Remus kindly smiled at the oldest students in the school, some of them looking suspiciously hungover and others clearly feeling a little sad that this would be their last year at Hogwarts. It didn’t go unnoticed that there was an empty seat at the very back of the class, no one else seemed to care too much that there was a student missing, so Remus went about calling the register.</p>
<p>     ‘Where is Miss Carter?’ Remus directed his question at the Gryffindor girl sitting next to the empty seat, who just shrugged and gave no indication that this was a one off occurrence. ‘Right, well, hopefully she will be along soon.’</p>
<p>     Remus turned back to the board and heard one of the students say ‘not bloody likely’. He continued the rest of the lesson and gave out the first assignment of the year much to the disappointment of the students. </p>
<p>     The seat remained empty. Remus didn’t have much time to dwell on it any longer as his next class was about to begin. </p>
<p>     The whole week had gone well, apart from the mysterious empty seat and the absence of Miss Rosaline Carter. Remus decided to ask McGonagall about it.</p>
<p>     ‘She hasn’t shown up to any of my classes yet either,’ the Transfiguration professor sighed outside her classroom. ‘Though to miss an entire week of one subject is unusual even for her.’</p>
<p>     ‘So, this is a regular occurrence?’</p>
<p>     ‘Unfortunately, yes. Miss Carter is probably the top student in the whole school, despite her punctuality and Professor Dumbledore has already spoken with her about it. They came to an agreement that she show up to at least one class of each subject every week, I’m sure there is a good reason for her neglect.’ McGonagall was about to walk away, but the whole thing seemed incredibly bizarre.</p>
<p>     ‘Sorry, but,’ Remus stopped her. ‘You’re telling me we have a student who may or may not show up to classes and that Dumbledore is okay with this?’</p>
<p>     ‘Well, of course not. Poppy is the one that has recommended we adhere to her requests until a form of treatment can be found.’</p>
<p>     ‘Treatment for what?’</p>
<p>     McGonagall’s eyes widened momentarily. ‘You haven’t been informed? You should see the Headmaster immediately Remus, I can only apologise, I thought you were informed of her circumstances.’</p>
<p>     Remus didn’t bother asking any more questions, he went straight to Dumbledore to ask him about Miss Carter.</p>
<p>     ‘I had hoped that she would come forward herself,’ Dumbledore said rather cryptically. ‘But I can understand that the last few years have been hard for her. I will speak with her over the weekend and see that she makes it to at least one of your classes next week.’</p>
<p>     ‘That would be preferable, but I would like to know if there is an issue I need to be aware of.’ Remus was a little too close to a full moon to have much patience, but he was doing his best.</p>
<p>     The headmaster thought and looked at Fawkes for a few moments. ‘Miss Carter is the daughter of Margaret Carter, you might not have heard of her, but she was the reason for the end of the war. An incredibly smart woman, quiet and calm, extremely skilled in dark magic… she was a Death Eater who, with Severus, decided to risk their lives and become agents for the Order. Margaret was killed eleven years ago, her daughter is the only witness and she has never spoken on the subject. She is the only one who knows what really happened that night and has yet to confide in anyone.’</p>
<p>     ‘Another Death Eater?’</p>
<p>     ‘Possibly.’ Dumbledore nodded. ‘I wonder if given the chance to speak with her, you might be able to encourage her to speak about those events.’</p>
<p>     ‘I’ve never even met her, what makes you think I will be able to do any more than you?’</p>
<p>     ‘You might have more in common than you think,’ Dumbledore leaned forward. ‘She has seen a great deal of horror and pain in her life and very little in the way of kindness, something you may be able to relate to, and I can only imagine the dementors will inflict a great deal of pressure onto her already fractured mind.’</p>
<p>     Remus wasn’t keen on Dumbledore’s assumption, he’d seen plenty of kindness, but very little of it directed towards him. He left the headmaster in peace and took a wander around the grounds, it was one of the things he found kept him calm in the midst of confusion or stress. </p>
<p>     It was another couple of weeks until finally Miss Carter made herself known to him, she sat quietly at the back and had her head buried in a book. It was Oliver Wood who moved the smirking Gryffindor girl away from her and took the seat beside her, once again no one thought this a particularly unusual event and simply said nothing as they settled. </p>
<p>     Remus needed to rest a little after his morning with the third years and had the seventh year class look at a few essay subjects that they might have wanted to write about for their next assignment. He took the time in between helping a few of the students, to observe Rosaline Carter.</p>
<p>     She was almost completely silent, only speaking when Oliver needed some more ink or to apologise for barely knocking his hand while he was writing. Remus couldn’t quite see all of her face, but it was clear she had a strong, small frame and judging from the way Wood had behaved around her, she was probably on the Quidditch team. Her dark hair was thick and tied up in a loose bun, while her focussed gaze remained in her book, she didn’t even look up when he called her name in the register.</p>
<p>     ‘Wood, what are you researching?’ Remus decided to take the plunge and talk to her.</p>
<p>     ‘Vampires?’ Wood looked up and it was clear he wasn’t exactly concentrating. ‘Thought it would be an interesting project?’</p>
<p>     ‘Yes, well, maybe you could look into something a little more local? I’ve been told you have an interest in centaurs?’ Remus spent a few minutes talking to the Gryffindor Keeper about his project on Centaurs, all the while keeping his eye on Rosaline. He could see her face a little more clearly and a whip of pain shot through his chest. It was like looking in a mirror, the pained expression on her face said it all, her watery green eyes broke his heart in a way he wasn’t ready for. </p>
<p>     Remus dismissed anyone in the class who wanted to get an early lunch or start on their essay project, that was the cue for most of the class to leave. He had hoped that Miss Carter would stay, but it seemed she missed the announcement altogether and Wood was the one to ask her something, ushering the both of them out of the classroom. </p>
<p>     It was only when Remus turned around to tidy a few things on his desk that he got the feeling that told him he wasn’t alone. He took a moment to see her stopped at the door, saying something to Wood. Remus watched as the young man gave a small smile and nodded, leaving her in the classroom.</p>
<p>     Remus continued tidying his desk, as the last few students finally began leaving, he didn’t go towards Miss Carter, instead allowing her to move towards him at her own pace. It took her a long time to actually move away from the door, but when she did, she walked right up to him and took a breath. </p>
<p>     ‘Professor Dumbledore said I should apologise,’ her voice was incredibly soft, she really didn’t use it a lot. ‘He advised me, said it would be a good idea to let you know that I am sorry for missing your classes over the last couple of weeks.’</p>
<p>     ‘That’s quite alright,’ Remus smiled and tried to be as cheerful as he could. ‘You’re here now. Can I look forward to you returning tomorrow? We’ll be starting work on duelling, mostly theory, but that’ll depend on everyone’s ability and confidence.’ It was like she was holding back tears constantly and it made Remus feel deeply heartbroken for the young woman standing in front of him. </p>
<p>     ‘I… I don’t like duelling.’ She said, it was so quiet that Remus had to step forward a little to hear her.</p>
<p>     ‘Well, I won’t make you do anything you don’t want to.’ Remus assured her. ‘If you would feel more comfortable sitting to the side, reading up on the theory or working on anything else you need to, then I’ve got no problem with that.’ Again, it was another few moments where she was clearly thinking on something and Remus felt no inclination to interrupt her. </p>
<p>     ‘Will it be on the exam?’</p>
<p>     ‘Duelling? Yes, I’m afraid it will be,’ Remus nodded. ‘But I am more than happy to make special arrangements if you don’t feel comfortable performing in front of your classmates.’</p>
<p>     ‘Really?’</p>
<p>     ‘Of course,’ Remus frowned, almost laughing. ‘I want you pass with flying colours and I will do everything I can to ensure you are ready for your exams. You will need to practice a few of the more complex spells in the meantime though, again, I’m more than happy to help with this if you feel you need it. It’s entirely up to you Miss Carter-‘</p>
<p>     ‘Rosaline.’ She suddenly snapped. ‘No one calls me that, my name is Rosaline.’ It was a flash of uncontrolled fury and Remus could only imagine why. </p>
<p>     ‘Rosaline.’ Remus nodded. ‘I’m only here to help and my door will always remain open for any student who asks for it.’</p>
<p>     It took her a few moments to think on what he said and before he could say anything else, she nodded to herself and left the classroom. There was no guarantee that Remus would see her again, but it seemed McGonagall was hopeful about the whole thing.</p>
<p>     ‘I don’t think any teacher has managed to get her to talk quite as much as that in her entire time at the school.’</p>
<p>     ‘She barely said a word.’ Remus scoffed, looking out at the courtyard on their way past.</p>
<p>     ‘Remus, let me be as clear as I can.’ McGonagall suddenly stopped. ‘Rosaline Carter has never asked a teacher a question in all her years here at Hogwarts, she’s barely given more than two sentences to any other staff member. Believe me, this is a big step for her.’</p>
<p>     Remus was left to think on what McGonagall had said, could it really be true that this scared young woman had said more to him in their brief encounter than she had to any other teacher in the seven years that she had been at the school? </p>
<p>     Remus was surprised to find that she returned to his class the next day, she didn’t participate and in fact the second Remus decided to get the class up and doing some basic duelling drills, she disappeared. </p>
<p>     He thought he’d blown it, that she would never come back to his class, Rosaline Carter was gone and for the next few weeks Remus was right. He hadn’t seen her even in the halls, she obviously went to Quidditch training, because everyone was talking about the next game. Remus wasn’t actually sure of what position she played, but he was excited to see her nonetheless. </p>
<p>     It was quite by chance when Remus was walking around the grounds, clearing his head that he saw her sitting on a large rock by the lake, reading a heavy book, she didn’t seem to be wearing anything more than her school jumper and a pair of jeans, she must have been freezing.</p>
<p>     ‘Rosaline?’ Remus kept his distance, trying not to startle her, but as it happened, she was an easy scare. ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to frighten you.’ She just watched him for a moment, unsure of what to do. ‘Mind if I sit with you? The view is quite something.’</p>
<p>     Rosaline took a few seconds to actually shift over and allow Remus to sit with her. After another minute or so, she went back to reading, but it was clear from where he was sitting that she was shaking violently with the cold.</p>
<p>     ‘Are you cold?’ Remus asked, keeping his voice low, again so as not to startle her. She nodded but never looked up from her book. ‘Maybe we should go inside, get up you warmed up a bit.’ Rosaline’s eyes stopped moving, but she shook her head. ‘It’s no use sitting out here and freezing-‘</p>
<p>     ‘I need to stay awake.’ Her voice was just above a whisper, but Remus heard her loud and clear. </p>
<p>     ‘That would indicate that you’re not sleeping properly?’</p>
<p>     Rosaline nodded.</p>
<p>     ‘Have you told Madame Pomfrey?’ </p>
<p>     She nodded again. Remus wondered why Poppy wouldn’t help her if she was struggling to sleep, possibly she was refusing any treatment? Maybe it was time for a different approach.</p>
<p>     ‘Rosaline, I have been here for almost two months and in that time, I have spoken to you twice,’ Remus started, perhaps honesty was the best policy. ‘I was worried when you didn’t show up for the first few classes and one of your classmates eluded to the fact that this was a regular and unsurprising occurrence. My curiosity peeked and I asked Professor McGonagall about you, that led me to the Headmaster.’ Remus took a breath, Rosaline had yet to look up or even move, but her eyes were still. Her attention was fully focussed on Remus. ‘Professor Dumbledore informed me of your mother, a subject that I would never press you on, he told me a few other things that I’m sure you’d rather no one know about and again, I would never ask or force you to say anything, it’s not my place to do so.’ Remus looked back at the young woman sitting next to him, she was about to burst into tears, any second now the floodgates would open and Remus tried to be ready for it. ‘Rosaline, the only thing I would like to know is if you are capable of producing a patronus? From the little I have been told, its clear that if the dementors who are currently guarding the school sense what is in your past, they will attempt to feed from you. All I want is for you to be able to defend yourself, should one of your teachers fail to reach you in time.’</p>
<p>     The floodgates opened and it was an unusual sight. She was crying at a pace that Remus had never seen before, but she was doing it silently and without expression. She was practised, very well practised. </p>
<p>     Remus wasn’t sure what to do, he didn’t want to touch her in case it upset her in any way, but he wanted to comfort her. He took his warm cloak off and very carefully draped it over her shoulders, her whole body relaxed into the tiredness she felt. </p>
<p>     Rosaline closed her eyes for a moment and breathed steadily. ‘I don’t.’ She whispered. ‘I’m sorry.’ </p>
<p>     ‘There’s never any need to apologise for not knowing something, especially not to me.’ Remus smiled, trying to reassure her. ‘If you would like me to, I can teach you how to perform a patronus with which to defend yourself. Do you think that’s something you would be interested in?’ </p>
<p>     It was another few moments where Rosaline looked out at the lake, before she answered quietly. ‘I don’t think I can do it.’ </p>
<p>     ‘Why would you think that?’ </p>
<p>     Remus watched her mouth open and then close abruptly, there was something she was embarrassed to say out loud. ‘I don’t have any happy memories.’ The tears came out again and once again she had no expression to speak of. </p>
<p>     Remus felt an immense sadness that he hadn’t felt in a long time, how could she have no happy memories? </p>
<p>     ‘Everyone has a happy memory,’ Remus tried to encourage her. ‘What about when you play Quidditch? Surely you’re happy doing that?’</p>
<p>     To Remus’s great surprise, she shook her head. </p>
<p>     ‘Then why are you on the team?’</p>
<p>     ‘Madame Pomfrey said it would be good for me… but it doesn’t feel good.’</p>
<p>     ‘I see.’ Remus sighed. ‘Then we need to find something that feels good, a new hobby, one you can enjoy.’</p>
<p>     It was the first time she actually looked at Remus, her bright green eyes were bloodshot and wet, she was still shaking and Remus was at a loss for what to do. </p>
<p>     ‘Like what?’ She asked, Remus could see such desperation and pain behind her eyes, everything just seemed to hurt and he felt such a connection to that, it pained him. </p>
<p>     ‘Well,’ Remus swallowed, thinking about anything that was the desperation in her eyes. ‘Some people enjoy playing chess,’ a miniscule frown appeared on her face and Remus proceeded to go through a list of possible things that she could pick up as a hobby, none of them seemed to sound too appealing to her though. ‘I personally enjoy walking around the grounds and Hogsmeade, just seeing the sights.’ Rosaline wasn’t as down on the idea of wandering around. ‘Well, if you fancy a walk, feel free to come and see me. There’s a lovely spot in the hills that overlooks the entirety of Hogwarts, would you like to see it?’</p>
<p>     Rosaline turned to face him and nodded.</p>
<p>     ‘I’ll take you up there any time you like,’ Remus promised, he could see that her eyes were struggling to remain open, but at least she wasn’t shivering anymore. ‘Though you may have to bring a coat with you when we do, it’s cold up there anyway, but with the winter coming in it’ll be a little worse. You’ll need to stay warm.’</p>
<p>     There was a sudden frown on her face, like some memory was playing out behind her eyes. She didn’t take her gaze away, instead she almost assessed his face, Remus couldn’t quite work out what was happening, but he was also afraid to ask. </p>
<p>     ‘I don’t mind the cold.’ She said. Remus was unsure of how to respond. ‘It keeps me awake.’</p>
<p>     Remus smiled kindly. ‘Most people your age enjoy sleep more than most other things… though I have to admit, I feel the same way about it.’ It hit Remus in a matter of seconds, she didn’t want to go to sleep because she had nightmares, probably vicious, possibly so realistic and based in reality that just closing her eyes must have been painful. Maybe this was what Dumbledore was hoping she would open up about. </p>
<p>     ‘Do you have nightmares as well?’ She asked. Remus could see all she wanted was to know was that someone understood the fear of falling asleep.</p>
<p>     ‘I do.’ Remus nodded. ‘Mostly about the war, I expect you’re the same?’ Remus watched her slowly turn to look out at the lake again. ‘It was a terrifying time for me as an adult, I can’t imagine being a child in amongst it all.’</p>
<p>     Rosaline didn’t say anything, instead she just sat watching the water for a while, Remus allowed her the room to do just that and found the company oddly relaxing. </p>
<p>     ‘I…’ Remus could see her hands balling up into fists, she was in a great deal of pain and it almost looked physical for a while. ‘I want to talk about it.’ She said and Remus automatically turned to listen to her. ‘But… I don’t want to remember anything about it.’ </p>
<p>     Remus took a breath and tried to think quickly. ‘There are a great many things in our pasts that cause us pain, things we’d rather forget. But talking about it, creating an understanding can help us to move past the pain and suddenly the horror of it, doesn’t seem so terrifying.’ She couldn’t quite look at him again. ‘Rosaline, I won’t force you to talk about your past, I won’t even ask you to think about it if you don’t want to, but I’ve always found wisdom in talking about the things that bother me.’ </p>
<p>     Rosaline sniffed. ‘Like what?’</p>
<p>     ‘Like how worried I am for you,’ Remus responded, there was no way he was going to reveal his secrets to her, he could never put anyone in that kind of danger. ‘I find myself more often than not, wondering if you’re okay, hoping that you’re somewhere laughing with your friends and having the time of your life. I worry that it might not be the case and that you might need someone to talk to who isn’t exactly a friend, someone you can trust to keep your secrets.’ Rosaline suddenly looked at him. ‘I’m keeping a fair few secrets of my own, I’ve gotten very good at it.’</p>
<p>     It was another few minutes, but Rosaline didn’t say anymore and Remus decided not to press her on the subject, but rather he suggested they go back to the castle and get something to eat. He also suggested an early night, possibly even seeing Madame Pomfrey for something that may help her to get a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>     ‘We can’t give her anymore dreamless sleep, I’m afraid.’ Poppy said, the matron was tired by the time Remus went to visit her. It was a quiet night in the hospital wing. ‘She has built up a tolerance for it over the summer, I warn her at the end of every year to be cautious when using dreamless sleep, but she never listens.’</p>
<p>     ‘It doesn’t work for her?’ Remus questioned, stepping a little further inside the office. </p>
<p>     ‘The potion should only be taken in extreme circumstances,’ Poppy sighed. ‘Unfortunately, Miss Carter’s situation is extreme by definition.’</p>
<p>     ‘In what way?’</p>
<p>     ‘I think she’s cursed, Remus.’ The matron suddenly had a much more serious look on her face. ‘Her threshold for pain is unprecedented, though I have my fears that it isn’t, rather, she has just gotten used to it.’</p>
<p>     ‘What kind of pain? Physical? Can’t we give her something for it?’</p>
<p>     ‘I’ve tried.’ Poppy shook her head. ‘No painkiller we’ve tried seems to work, unless she tells us what happened on the day her mother died, there isn’t much more we can do beyond guesswork. I wish there was another way, but there’s only one curse that can cause this kind of damage.’ Cruciatis. Remus felt his entire body weaken. ‘She was seven years old when her mother was killed, can you imagine being seven and seeing such a thing?’</p>
<p>     Remus couldn’t believe it, there was no way that someone could survive the Cruciatis curse at that age. He thought about the way she walked around, rigid, like it was painful to move, like it was painful to breathe, to simply exist. </p>
<p>     ‘Has she ever… tried to stop the pain?’ Remus really didn’t want the answer to his question, but Poppy’s expression said it all. He suddenly understood everything, Rosaline Carter had seen the worst of humanity and survived, but it was clear she had never seen any evidence that her sacrifice was worth it.</p>
<p>     ‘I hope you can help her Remus. She is an extraordinary talent, potential beyond potential, but if she can’t get past this, then she may never make it that far. I’ve done all I can and it hasn’t been enough.’ Poppy sighed and it was obvious that the Healer had a huge amount of guilt over her lack of progress with this patient. </p>
<p>     ‘Everyone can be saved, Poppy. You just have to figure out how, we’ll get there, you can be sure of that.’ Remus tried so hard to be reassuring, but something was telling him that Rosaline would be a difficult person to unlock.</p>
