  <em>The wolf got up to examine his territory. The wind smelled of security and calmness and told him his pup had been here some time ago. But at this time, the pup would be fast asleep, too young to take a nighttime stroll with him and Shaggy Lynx.
</em></p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Shaggy Lynx who had been the Pack’s pup before, but was now old enough to find a mate for himself greeted him with enthusiastic purrs. He was the son of Pack brother with antlers and his mate Red.</em></p><p>

<em>Pack brother with antlers and Red, the former alpha couple would never come again if the wolf called out for them, the wolf had stopped calling out for them moons and moons ago, and he was an alpha in his own right by now, but he would always keep calling out for his own Mate. He had seen his Mate fall through the Veil, but his heart refused to believe that he would never see his Mate’s gloriously shaggy black fur again or smell his intoxicating scent, the best scent the wolf had ever smelled.</em></p><p>

The wolf strolled at a sedate pace around the plants, left a few scent marks on trees, and called out for his Mate. As in all the moons since the Mate had fallen through the Veil, there was no reply. There was just Shaggy lynx who made soothing sounds and rubbed his head against the wolf’s side. The wolf smelled that Shaggy lynx felt the sadness too, was also missing the wolf’s mate painfully. They both and the wolf’s pup were all that was left of what should have been the wolf’s happy pack.</em>

 After another hour of strolling around, the wolf curled up between the roots of a tree, and Shaggy lynx sat down beside him and purred softly until the wolf drifted into a dreamless sleep.</em>

A groan beside him woke Harry up. As usual, he turned in a way to see Remus’ face first. Only when Remus whispered “Okay,” to express that he had accioed a towel and covered his crotch, did Harry start examining Remus for injuries.</p>
<p>

By now it had developed into a routine; Harry had become an Animagus about one year after the War, and now, four years later, Harry only needed to summon a healer at particularly bad full moons. He knew all post-full-moon diagnostic and routine healing spells as well as the healers at St. Mungo’s did, so he would only have to take Remus to St. Mungo’s if anything out of the ordinary were to happen.</p>

Harry applied dittany salve to Remus’ arms and legs and levitated him carefully to his bed and watched over him until the older man had fallen asleep. Then, Harry conjured his Patronus, told it to keep watch over Remus and went to his study.</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
He firecalled Surya Patil, Remus’ healer, “Everything is normal, all diagnostics are good.”</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
“I’ve received the duplicate. Thank you, Mr. Potter. It’s rare that someone who is neither a spouse nor a blood relative takes such good care of a lycanthropy patient,” the healer said in a tone that made Harry slightly uncomfortable, as it reeked of hero worship.</p>

“Remus is my second godfather, due to his lycanthropy he wasn’t allowed to be that officially, but unofficially he is.” In fact, when Harry had gone to Godric’s Hollow again after the War, he had found his mother’s diary and learned that his first word after Mama and Dada had in fact been, Moo’ey, a week before the more difficult Pafoo. He had read how Remus would sing for him for hours before the Potters had to go into hiding.</p>

Also, as much as he loved the Weasleys, he considered Remus more his family than Molly, who tried to persuade Ginny to get back with him, even though both had told her over and over that this wasn’t ever going to happen. Ginny was dating Luna and was happy with her.</p>

Harry started with his job; he was working home office, as he would do every post-full moon day. He had not become an Auror, but was the founder and chairman of Magic of Diversity an umbrella organization for different associations and foundations dedicated to making wizarding Britain more inclusive. It had been Remus’ idea when Harry had been unable to decide which one of different associations and foundations to dedicate his time to, when some of his friends founded them. There was Remus’ FILP (Foundation for the Inclusion of Lycanthropy Patients), Ron and Hermione’s E4AMB (Equality 4 All Magical Beings) – dedicated to equal rights for house elves and goblins and named by Ron, Dean and Seamus’ LILA (Love is Love Association), Charlie’s WWAuAD (Wix with Autism or ADHD; Harry had ADHD himself) – founded after Charlie had returned from Romania to share the job of COMC teacher with Hagrid, or Dennis Creevey and Neville’s Muggleborn and Pureblood Dialogue Centre. The other three organizations currently under the umbrella of Magic of Diversity were Tonks’ NTHEY (Nonbinary and Trans Humans: Emerging You), and Mrs. Figgs’ Squibs In Wizarding Britain.</p>

Remus had been elected chairman of Magic of Diversity, and Harry had found himself in the role of a director of administration, but to his surprise, he loved it, as the associations did their own paperwork, and he made sure they all had a comfortable place in Grimmauld Place, which adapted to their needs and coordinated conference rooms and events.</p>

And he ran a café with the help of Draco Malfoy, for whom the job was part of his probation.</p>

But today, Harry calculated catering and made spellphone calls from home, the renovated Lupin Cottage, where Remus had given him the two rooms above his own study and Teddy's room, where the boy stayed every other week. It was what both Harry and Remus needed: Just to go out of the door and have someone who cared. Maybe, Harry thought, this was a bit like having a father.</p>

The Floo roared to life, and Harry hurried to it. “Harry, is Remus awake?” That was Minerva McGonagall, sounding untypically excited.</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>
“No, he’s still asleep. Can I help you?”</p>

“Poppy found something interesting in a medical magazine. Something you and Remus have to see.” She almost bounced with excitement, a state in which probably no Hogwarts alumnus had ever seen the headmistress.</p>

She shook her head, but still beamed at him. “No, but there is hope Sirius might be alive.”</p>
