    <p>“The boy has disappeared, Albus,” Severus spat.</p><p>Shadowed blue eyes stared back at him in shock.</p><p>“And what of Voldemort?”  </p><p>Severus flinched in pain at the sound of the accursed name.</p><p>“The Dark Lord is every bit as flummoxed by this as you are.”</p><p>“Do you think that Harry is responsible for his relatives’ deaths?”  Albus wondered aloud.</p><p>Severus scowled.  </p><p>“If he is, then I feel certain that he was justified.”</p><p>He swirled and made to stride from the room.</p><p>“You believe that he was mistreated?”</p><p>Severus scowled, but dutifully floated over a copy of the letter he had received at the beginning of the week.</p><p>Albus read it and was shocked.  </p><p>“He refers to himself as, ‘The Freak,’” Severus stated matter-of-factly.  “I feel certain that he did not come up with the name on his own. So yes,” He snarled.  “I believe he was mistreated.”</p><p>“The Order will watch the usual places, my boy.  If you receive further correspondence from him, you will send it to me immediately, understand?”  Albus’ eyes were glinty with resolve.</p><p>Severus sneered but then nodded and left.  </p><p>. . .</p><p>He threw back the glass of firewhiskey and shuddered at the burn.</p><p>On his lap lay the latest letter from Potter--the one he had <em> conveniently </em> forgotten to mention to Dumbledore.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Professor Snakey, </em>
</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes at the idiocy but managed to control the hysterical laugh that threatened to bubble forth.</p><p>
  <em> I’m staying with the goblins for a bit while I get on my feet. </em>
</p><p>“Only you, Potter.”</p><p>
  <em> They seem to like me.  I think it’s because I treat them like equals.  I can’t imagine why someone would be cruel to the one who holds their money, but apparently the wizarding world is stupider than I thought. </em>
</p><p>“You have <em> no </em> idea,” Severus whispered, thinking in particular of a certain twinkly eyed bastard.</p><p>
  <em> I’m learning a lot more than I would during a normal summer.  And eating a lot. The goblins seem to think I should be a bit bigger than I am.  They keep pushing nutrition potions at me. </em>
</p><p>Severus’ stomach clenched at the unspoken meaning of the boy’s words.</p><p>
  <em> I never knew that pomegranates were something to be eaten.  I just thought they were used in potions. </em>
</p><p>He closed his eyes against a wave of sudden vertigo.  His world view was shifting rapidly, enough that his stomach was rolling against the changes.</p><p>
  <em> Every time I come into a room, the goblins tell me to sit.  To read. To eat. To do all of these things that I’ve never been allowed to do in peace.   </em>
</p><p>Perhaps he would move in with the goblins as well.  He snorted and returned to the ridiculous letter.</p><p>
  <em> I shaved my head.  And the goblins fixed my eyes.  They also gave me some jewelry that helps with going undetected.  Just thought you should know. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Oh, and I’m going to meet with Mr Dark Lord at his manor tomorrow.  Feel free to come. 10:14, sharp. Haha. No, really. </em>
</p><p>Severus silently summoned a calming draught and downed it without shuddering.  The vial fell from unfeeling fingers and shattered on the floor with a tiny tinkling sound.  </p><p>The letter was signed the same as before.  </p><p>
  <em> Sincerely, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Freak </em>
