    <p>Another Summer, gone.<br/>
Though honestly, you were more than happy to be returning. Your muggle parents understood nothing of the wizarding world, nor did they want to. Once again, they tried to get you to stay behind from traveling to the school you were rather pleased to see. They cared little to nothing about your studies in magic, or proper wand holding, and casting spells. They rather you develop a 'real' education studying mathematics, and English; as well as learning how to drive. You had recently turned 15, and were ready to learn the basics of driving- yet being the young witch you were, you had been taught during 1st year how to fly via broomstick. Driving was pointless and useless to you now.</p><p>You sat on your seat on the Hogwarts Express, having recently changed into your school robes. Staring out the window through the darkness, you could see the gleaming castle of Hogwarts becoming clearer, as the train traveled on faster. You had made up your mind, as soon as your muggle parents had dropped you off at the train station; and left you to head to the train platform of 9 3/4 alone once more. You were going to prove them wrong. You were going to prove that you could excel at both Wizarding and Muggle studies, and still pass your O.W.L.s with flying colors. The only problem, you already knew- would, of course, be passing Potions. It sure didn't matter to your parents that you had not only topped your class at the end of 4th year, and had become none other than a prefect to your proud Gryffindor house. You were still wasting away time to them.</p><p>As the train slowly began to come to a stop, you stood up from your seat. Your thoughts had left you unapproachable to those who had been wanting to speak to you, but now you had duties to perform. Straightening your prefect badge, you headed down the corridors of the Hogwarts express towards the first years who sat on the side of the Gryffindor house. "First years!" You yelled. "Follow me out of the Hogwarts Express. Don't worry about your things; they will be taken to the castle for you." You turned your back quickly to the first years and started to walk towards the exit of the train. You could hear the first years behind you stumbling to get up and follow after you. You chuckled lightly to yourself. Your first year was quite the same, aside from the fact that you had fallen flat on your face rushing to get out of the train following a former graduate prefect.</p><p>You lead the way out of the Hogwarts express, and at once saw a familiar face. Hagrid was yelling for all first years to come to him, as he usually took them to the school by boat. The first years around you scrambled to head over to him, the booming yet friendly semi giant. He turned to face the other first years coming towards him and easily saw you over their small heads. He gave you a wave, and you waved back, before heading on your way to the prefects' carriage where you were to be instructed by the Head Boy and Girl, before the Great Feast and lead the new, young Gryffindor's to their dormitories.</p><p> </p><p>The carriage ride wasn't long, and the instructions you were given were simple enough. You talked with the few other recently made Prefects from the other houses, before jumping out of the carriage. Hogwarts was roaring with life as expected. The lights and enchantments were full blown just like the years before when you arrived, yet they never failed to leave you in awe. You entered the castle, and headed towards the Great hall, entering and at once seeing the other students, aside from the First years. Seeing some your friends that waved you over, you pushed your (Hair length) (Hair color) hair from your face and sat down at the place that was saved for you. "(Your name)! (Your name)! How was your summer? I hear you're a prefect now!" Your smile grew. "It was an ok summer, and yeah-" You held out your prefect badge for all those around to see. "I AM a prefect now."<br/>
"Wow. That's amazing. You're the next Mudblood after Hermione to become a prefect. I didn't think it would happen again so soon." You bit your lip to hold back a crude comment and instead looked towards the Great Hall doors where the First years were flooding in, ready and nervous about being sorted into their houses.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore gave a few welcoming words before the sorting began. You clapped your hands loudly at every new Gryffindor that got sorted into your house. A little distance away, you could see Ginny Weasley who was a grade below you, as well as the famous Harry Potter and Friends sitting a bit farther down, also in 5th year. Looking up towards the Head of houses, you saw Professor Sprout- head of Hufflepuff, Professor Flitwick- head of Ravenclaw, Professor McGonagall- head of Gryffindor, and Professor Snape- head of Slytherin house. His gaze was following every new member of his house, yet it seemed that he had sensed your gaze. Looking up, the two of you locked eyes for a few moments, before you quickly looked away. You looked up a few moments later, to see his gaze had left you once more. Shivering slightly you sighed. You'd have to get on his good side sooner or later, even though you disliked him with a harsh passion. The feast soon started, and you and your friends all ate your fill before you stood up and headed towards the new 1st years of the Gryffindor house, leading them to the dormitories. "Mimbulus mimbletonia." You said to the fat lady, as she swung open with the password. You lead the 1st years into the dormitories, showing them around. It wasn't long before everyone headed on their own to unpack their things and claim beds.</p><p>You headed up to the girl's dormitories, heading to your own room and unpacking your things and putting them in your school trunk next to your bed. You changed out of your school robes and into your bed robes, before heading back down to the common room to chat for a bit, before instructing the 1st years to head to bed, before doing the same yourself.</p>
