    <p>Newt never imagined there would be consequences for skipping the Travers’ party.</p><p>He’d had other things on his mind when Theseus called around to pick him up that night: namely a certain American witch with the prettiest brown eyes he’d ever seen. For months he’d pined and agonised over his feelings for her, but after their last conversation, one thing was certain. Tina Goldstein fancied him. Not only that: she wanted to be with him.</p><p>He knew there would be obstacles. Her living across the Atlantic was the most obvious one, but the recent setback to Grindelwald’s campaign across Europe had made them bolder. Bold enough to confess their true feelings. Bold enough to share a first kiss he wouldn’t soon forget. Bold enough even to tell Theseus to bugger off when he came to pick Newt up for a party he hadn’t wanted to go to anyway, thank you very much. Somewhere along the line, that giddiness had given way to something more serious. “This isn’t going to be easy,” Tina had said. “We live so far apart, we might not get to see each other very often…”</p><p>“We’ll make it work,” he’d responded. “We’ll make a plan.”</p><p>She’d chuckled at that. “You’ve never been much good at making plans, Mr. Scamander.”</p><p>Fair point, he’d conceded. She had him there. “Well then, I’ll leave the planning in your more than capable hands, Miss Goldstein.”</p><p>Before they parted for the night, they’d agreed to meet at the Leaky Cauldron for lunch next time she was in town. She’d had to gone home to New York after the fight with Grindelwald, but now, only a few weeks later, she was back in London to do some liaising between MACUSA and the British Ministry of Magic. So he was very annoyed to wake up to an irate letter from Theseus.</p><p>“All right, all right,” he muttered as he retrieved the letter from his brother’s handsome tawny owl. The bird accepted a few owl treats but he still hooted reproachfully at Newt before departing, as if he shared his master’s disapproval.</p><p>The letter was short and brusque:<em>       </em></p><p>
  <em>Dear Newt,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We missed you at the party the other night. Leta was terribly put out and Miss Bunty was worried sick about you. I hope you weren’t off gallivanting with that muggle chum of yours. Or perhaps you were with that American girl. Either way, I thought we already discussed your more questionable friendships and decided you could do better.</em>
</p><p>Newt bristled at that. Better how? Jacob is the best friend I’ve ever had. And Tina… Theseus doesn’t even know her, but he’s already decided he doesn’t like her. What does it matter to him who I choose to spend my time with? He’s always been on my case to make friends and connect with people. But when I finally do, he tries to tell me they’re not the right sort of people.</p><p>He scanned the rest of the letter:</p><p>
  <em>I made excuses for you this time, but I might not be inclined to do so in the future. This is your life, Newt. You’re a success now. People are dying to meet you and you have an obligation to your public. I know being in the spotlight is not easy for you. But I want to help. Please believe that I only have your best interests at heart.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your brother, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Theseus</em>
</p><p>Newt’s hand clenched involuntarily, crumpling the letter in the process. How dare Theseus, he thought. He has no right to tell me how to live my life. He forfeited that right when he started seeing Leta behind my back.</p><p>Newt had already talked things out with Leta and she’d apologized for her part in it. But it still rankled him. If they’d both just been honest with me from the start, Theseus and I wouldn’t be in such a bad place now, he thought darkly. They kept their relationship secret to spare my feelings because they both thought I still fancied Leta. But if they’d just told me, I would have accepted it a lot sooner. And I could have gotten back to Tina sooner.</p><p>He stowed the letter in his desk drawer and went about his usual morning routine. There were other letters to answer and creatures that needed tending to. But once all of that was taken care of, he could put on some nicer clothes and meet Tina. The very thought of seeing her lovely face again and hearing the soft sound of her voice made him forget all about the letter. He hummed to himself as he washed up, taking care to ensure his hair was tousled just so: pleasantly unkempt without being too messy. That was how he preferred it. And from the way Tina had woven her fingers through it when she’d kissed him goodbye, he suspected she shared his preference.</p><p>He materialized in the alleyway beside The Leaky Cauldron, feeling a fluttering sensation in his stomach that had nothing to do with the aftereffect of Apparating. His hopeful heart pounded as ducked inside, beating louder with every step he took. His eyes scanned all around the room before spotting her familiar shape at the bar. Just the sight of her profile was enough to put a goofy smile on his face.</p><p>She heard his approach and turned her head, tucking a flyaway strand of hair behind her ear as she nodded a tight-lipped greeting. He faltered in his approach, not knowing what to make of her. Her hair was a bit messy and when he moved closer he saw her eyes were bloodshot and tired. But what made him stop in his tracks was the small suitcase that rested beside her.</p><p>“Do you have to leave already?” He asked, his smile faltering. Please say no, he prayed. She’s supposed to be here all week…</p><p>“Just the Cauldron,” she responded, her eyes darting about nervously. “It’s good to see you, Newt.”</p><p>Newt sagged against the barstool beside her. Thank God, he thought. But that doesn’t explain why she seems so out of sorts. “Are you quite alright, Tina?”</p><p>Her lower lip trembled and she shook her head. “Not really. Someone… someone tried to break into my room last night.” She raised her eyes to his, fearful and hesitant.</p><p>He scooted closer to her – close enough to rest his hand beside hers on the counter. “Are you hurt? What happened?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said, though her rigid posture and trembling hands suggested otherwise. He hooked his baby finger over hers, hoping his touch would calm her. “I scared them off with a few good hexes,” she said as she let her fingers twine between his. “Then they moved me to another room and put wards up. But my roommate snored all night. I barely got a wink of sleep.”</p><p>“Bloody hell,” he murmured. “You can’t stay here. They might come back…” Maybe we’ve been foolish, he fretted. In the wake of the last battle with Grindelwald, the dark wizard had been hit with so many curses and hexes, it would be at least a year before he was strong enough to strike back. But many of his followers were still out there. And if they knew Tina was back in town, she could be in danger. He had to do something.</p><p>“I already tried to find other accommodations, but everything else is booked up,” she told him. “So I’m stuck here until I go home.”</p><p>Unacceptable, he thought. I can’t just leave her here. But maybe… “You could stay with me,” he suggested. “I know a place…”</p><p>She pulled away, looking scandalized. “Excuse me? I can’t stay with you and you know it! It wouldn’t be… you know… proper.”</p><p>Damn it, that’s not what I meant. Why can’t I ever say what I mean around her? “I don’t mean with me at my place,” he said, hasty to reassure her of his intentions. “I meant at my family’s place. The Scamander Estate.”</p><p>Her expression softened ever so slightly. “The Scamander… Estate? Your family has an estate?”</p><p>Perhaps it would have been smart to have mentioned that before now. He cleared his throat, suddenly unable to look her in the eye. “Erm… yes. We do.” He tried to smile, but it felt unnatural. Not like before.</p><p>Tina’s eyebrows disappeared behind her fringe. “An estate,” she repeated, shaking her head. “Mercy Lewis, Newt. I had no idea your family was so well off.” She was eyeing him warily now, uncertain what to say next. “And they won’t mind me staying there?”</p><p>“Not at all,” he assured her. “Mum has had the run of the place since dad passed away. She’d be grateful for the company.”</p><p>This time Tina was the one who tried to smile. Her lips quirked upward hesitantly and he breathed a sigh of relief. She was going to be all right. “So, let me get this straight. We’ve only been together for two weeks and you’re already bringing me home to meet your mother?”</p><p>What can I say, he thought. When you know, you know. “It’s a bit sudden, I know. But it’s better than being stuck here with someone who keeps you up all night.”</p><p>Tina shuddered. “It was dreadful. She’s a sweet elderly lady, but she has some sort of sinus complaint…” she trailed off, laughing a little despite herself. “It was like listening to a dragon snore.”</p><p>That made him laugh too. “Let’s have a bite to eat,” he said. “Then we can take our leave.”</p><p align="center">****</p><p>Tina didn’t know what to expect. The word “estate” conjured up images of grand manor houses the likes of which they didn’t have back home in the States. Sprawling residences of brick and stone with turrets and balconies and gardens. When she took hold of Newt’s arm to apparate, she held on more tightly than she needed to. If she could ground herself by clinging to him, stepping into the unknown wouldn’t be so terrifying.</p><p>The house blinked into existence at the end of the stone laneway they landed on. Tina swallowed, still holding onto him while she got her bearings. The building could best be described as a mansion: it had elegant red brick, a dark shingled roof, wide picture windows, and several chimneys. It sat on a plot of land ringed by trees and flowerbeds. But it wasn’t huge, thank God. As far as mansions went, there was something almost cozy about it. But it was a grand house. There was no doubt about that. “This is where you grew up?” she said as they started off down the lane. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p>Newt ducked his head in his familiar modest way. “I hope you like it here,” he said softly. When they got to the front door, Newt got out his wand and gave it a series of swift taps before knocking. “Secret code,” he explained when he saw her confused look. “Scamander family secret.”</p><p>To keep out the riffraff? She wondered. I hope I’m not riffraff. She wished she’d had the time to fix her hair before leaving the Leaky Cauldron. She wasn’t wearing her auror’s coat today – it was stowed in her suitcase now that she was off duty – so she couldn’t help but feel shabby in her wrinkled white blouse, her baggy trousers, and her scuffed old shoes.</p><p>The door swung open and they were greeted by a man in a butler’s uniform. An actual butler, like in one of those historical novels Queenie loved to read. Newt greeted the butler like an old friend and soon they were inside, treading lightly on the marble floor of the foyer. “Mr. Baxter can take your suitcase,” Newt said, startling her from her thoughts. “To the guest room please,” he added to the butler. Tina shifted on her feet as she handed the case over, her eyes sliding this way and that to take in the décor. A spiral staircase bloomed from her left, trailing its way to the upper level of the house, framing an intricate chandelier of crystalline glass. And to her right, an elegantly dressed older woman watched from an archway, her face so impassive she could have been a statue.</p><p>Newt didn’t seem to notice. “Mum!” he exclaimed, breaking away from Tina to greet the woman. “It’s so good to see you.”</p><p>“It’s good to see you too, Newton.” The woman surveyed her son with a keen eye and brushed a bit of lint off the shoulder of his jacket. “Home at last. And not alone, I see.” Her gaze cut in Tina’s direction, making Tina freeze on the spot. I really should have changed before I got here, she worried as the formidable lady’s eyes swept over her plain clothes and frazzled hair. This is not the first impression I wanted to make. But Newt had insisted they leave the Leaky Cauldron before her attacker came back for another go, and at the time, she’d agreed. But now her heart was pounding and her hands were sweating under the scrutiny. But there was nothing she could do about it now. She’d have to make the best of it. And Newt was walking over to her with a smile that was so infectious, she couldn’t help but smile too. I’ve dueled Grindelwald twice and lived to tell the tale, she reminded herself. Surely I can survive this.</p><p>“Mum,” Newt said, his eyes never leaving Tina’s, “I’d like you to meet Miss Porpentina Goldstein. Tina, this is my mother, Mrs. Helen Scamander.”</p><p>“Mrs. Scamander,” Tina repeated, holding out a hand to shake. “It’s such a pleasure to meet you.” A bit of politeness and good manners go a long way, she reminded herself. That was the first thing she’d learned in England. The British wizards and witches she’d met at the Ministry were much more formal than the ones she knew back home.</p><p>“The pleasure’s all mine, Miss Goldstein.” Mrs. Scamander shook her hand and if Tina’s sweaty palm put her off she gave no indication. “I daresay Newton, this is quite a surprise. Usually it’s your brother who brings home young ladies to meet me.”</p><p>I wonder how many young ladies Theseus Scamander brought home before setting his sights on Leta, Tina wondered. And I wonder if Leta knows.</p><p>“It was a bit last minute,” Newt confessed. “There was a spot of bother at The Leaky Cauldron. Er – a break in, to be precise. I told Tina – Miss Goldstein – she could stay here until…”</p><p>“But of course!” Mrs. Scamander said, catching his drift. “How dreadful for you, Miss Goldstein. I trust you’re no worse for wear?”</p><p>“A little shaken up, but I’m fine,” she said. “And if my being here is a hindrance to you at all, I can find other lodgings…”</p><p>Mrs. Scamander gave a slight – almost unnoticeable – nod of approval. “No need for that,” she insisted. “But we will have to make up an extra place setting for you for tonight’s dinner party. Cook won’t be happy, but we shall have to make do.”</p><p>“Oh bugger,” Newt mumbled. “I forgot that was tonight.”</p><p>“Language, Newton.” His mother admonished him. “It will be a good chance for your friend to meet your brother and his fiancée. Now run along, Newton. The hippogriffs will be happy to see you. I’ll make sure your guest settles in.”</p><p>Don’t leave me, Tina wanted to say. I’m not ready to be alone with your very intimidating mother. But she saw no way of avoiding it. Newt gave her a reassuring smile and promised he’d come find her before the party. Then he was off, disappearing down the hallway, taking half of her heart with him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">****</p><p> </p><p>Helen Scamander had spent much of her adult life cultivating an air of dignity and poise. She prided herself on always knowing what was going on in the lives of her sons, their friends, and the rest of her social circle. But to see her younger boy show up unannounced with a strange young woman was not something she’d prepared herself for.</p><p>She recovered herself quickly, recalling that Newton had spoken at great length about a girl he’d met in New York. Surely this Miss Goldstein was the very same girl, for he hadn’t mentioned any other young ladies in the recent past. Indeed, the only other young lady who’d ever turned Newton’s head was now engaged to Theseus.</p><p>Miss Lestrange and Miss Goldstein were a study in contrasts. One short where the other was tall. One elegant where the other was gawky. One pretty where the other was plain. No, that was an unfair assessment, Helen thought as she led the nervous Miss Goldstein up the spiral staircase. Despite her casual attire, she has a decent figure and good bone structure to her face. She’ll be much more presentable once we get her in a dress and do something about that hair. Then hopefully the rest of my guests will forgive the American accent.</p><p>“You have a lovely home, Mrs. Scamander,” the girl was saying as they reached the top of the stairs and started down the carpeted hallway.</p><p>“Yes indeed,” Helen said. Miss Goldstein had been drinking in every little detail since crossing the threshold. Her dark eyes lingered on the damask wallpaper and gold leaf picture frames that dominated the walls and the plush rugs that covered the floor. She’s not used to being in a place this fine, Helen surmised. A far cry from Miss Lestrange, who grew up in an estate even grander than this one. The poor child is so far out of her depth and Newton didn’t even think to warn her. Silly boy. I’ll have to take this one under my wing, or she’ll be completely adrift. “You’ll be staying here,” she said, ushering Miss Goldstein into the guest room. “There is an en suite lavatory should you have need of it. It’s early still, so you’ll have plenty of time for a quick nap. Cocktail hour starts at 6:00pm with dinner to follow at 7:00pm sharp.”</p><p>Miss Goldstein nodded, wringing her hands as she stepped into the room.  </p><p>“We dress for dinner here,” Helen continued. “Put on whatever you brought that’s best, or feel free to transfigure yourself a dress if need be. I’d lend you something more formal but you’re a good deal taller than myself or Miss Lestrange.”</p><p>“I can transfigure something,” Miss Goldstein said.</p><p>“Hmm.” Helen dreaded to think of what this fashion-challenged girl might conjure up for herself. “Perhaps I’ll send Miss Lestrange up to assist you when she arrives. She has such an eye for style.” Miss Goldstein flinched, her eyes dropping to the floor. “I suspect the fashions in New York are quite different then they are here,” Helen elaborated. “And we wouldn’t want you to look out of place on your first visit.”</p><p>Miss Goldstein managed a hesitant smile. “Thank you, Mrs. Scamander. I appreciate that.”</p><p>“Very good.” Helen Scamander took her leave, taking one last look over her shoulder at Miss Goldstein from the doorway. No, Helen Scamander did not like surprises. But she suspected Miss Goldstein might be a welcome one.</p><p> </p>
