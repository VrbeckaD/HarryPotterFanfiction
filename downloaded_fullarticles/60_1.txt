    <p>Two voices could be heard shouting from the Headmaster’s tower of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“Please Albus, tell me why must you be so hard to bargain with?” He said.</p>
<p>“Why, I have no idea what you mean Cornelius. Have I been unaccommodating to you? I’ve taken your course suggestions, allowed your textbooks, even let you examine our boundary wards!”</p>
<p>“You know exactly what I mean! You have blatantly refused to even look at my candidate for the Defense against the Dark Arts position!”</p>
<p>“As I told you before, the position has already been filled! I cannot offer an opening that no longer exists. It would be an act of sheer lunacy!”</p>
<p>“You haven’t allowed me to meet them! Never give any information about them! For all I know, you could be giving your students away to a mad man!” The implication rang clear in the air.</p>
<p>“You know as well as I do that I would have saved Cedric if I had known!” Albus retorted, rising from his chair. “This wizard was hired to keep the students safe and to calm any anxiety over the events of last year.”</p>
<p>“I believe my candidate could do the same, if not better. Yet, you still refuse to even see them! They’ve been preparing for months, I handpicked her myself.”</p>
<p>“Cornelius, you know how much I dislike repeating myself. The position has been filled since June!”</p>
<p>“At least allow me to meet them, perhaps it would assure the Daily Prophets anxieties over your leadership. Anxieties which you and that Potter boy created in the first place! You’d get a certified stamp of approval from the Minister! Surely that’s worth something!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked over his glasses at the Minister, making a face one might expect from a chef judging a flavor. “Very well, I shall arrange a meeting. Perhaps even a demonstration to convince you of his skills.”</p>
<p>“And when should I expect this to be?”</p>
<p>“The professor should have arrived this morning,” Fudge made a note of his tardiness in his mind. “ please don’t hold it against him. Travel overseas is quite a time-consuming thing these days, even in the best situations.”</p>
<p>“Then perhaps I should stay to meet him.”</p>
<p>“Surely the Minister of Magic has more important things to do than wait for one Wizard.” The words were light and teasing, like a swarm of pixies on a farm.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you could understand that nothing is more important to me than the student's welfare.” The remark felt weighty in the air, pressing down the heat of the summer into a tense atmosphere. They sat in it, waiting for any indication of change. While either one of them could simply speak and whisk away the feeling, neither of them would allow such a defeat.</p>
<p>Luckily, neither of them had to yield. A light knock on the door made it squeak open. The man behind it peaked into the room.</p>
<p>He spoke in a heavy accent, sounding like he was from the Americas. “Pardon me, sir, would either one of you happen to know where the Headmaster’s office is? This castle is quite large and, in truth, quite empty.” He grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Oh! Please come in, you’ve arrived at the correct destination. I,” Albus pressed a hand to his chest, “am Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster of this institution. Would you happen to be our new instructor?”</p>
<p>The man dragged in a suitcase, giving them both a smile. “Yes sir, I believe so.” He extended a hand to Dumbledore, who accepted it quickly. “I’m Edmond Carmine Goldstein, please just call me Ed though. I’ve been told my names are a mouthful.”</p>
<p>“I certainly will.” Albus smiled, “Now then, you wouldn’t happen to have some sort of letter from my colleague, would you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, Professor Walsh told me to give you this when I saw you.” He handed a small red envelope to Dumbledore, covered in scrawling golden script. He opened it, turned it upside down and held his hand out. A small mint fell into the palm of his hand, which he popped in his mouth. He grimaced at the flavor.</p>
<p>“This certainly is from Sam. Only he would put something so foul into a mint.” Albus turned to Fudge and told him, “It seems to be ash flavored. Quite dreadful.”</p>
<p>Edmond extended a hand to Fudge. “Excuse me, I don’t believe I’ve met you. Are you part of the faculty as well?”</p>
<p>Fudge drew in a breath of air, puffing himself up to introduce himself. “Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.”</p>
<p>“He’s here to appraise you,” Dumbledore said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Edmond looked confused, “I thought I already had the job?”</p>
<p>“You do. The Minister has simply decided to take a more involved approach to education this year. The new curriculum, new textbooks, things of that variety. I’m sure I forwarded some of the notes he sent, but please feel free to give him your credentials.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re the man who looked over my lesson plans and sent notes.” His smile tightened. “Wonderful.” Edmond took a breath and smoothed out his clothes. “As you know, I’m Edmond Goldstein. I graduated from the Zavala School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1982, then I worked for ten years in the government as a Ranger, though I suppose you call them Aurors here. I specialized in higher-level personnel emergencies that ranged from rogue magical creatures to dealing with wizards in a one on one setting. I retired two years ago and I’ve been working at Zavala as an assistant.”</p>
<p>Fudge sighed, seeming disappointed. “Those are quite impressive credentials, but Albus I am afraid that I cannot give him my approval. My candidate is simply more experienced, and she was a student of Hogwarts herself. She would understand the way this school works far better than any American.” He glanced over at Ed, “Please don’t think I hold it against you, it’s just that I know the schools work differently here.”</p>
<p>“None taken, sir, but if it helps at all, I’m from Texas. We aren’t part of the MACUSA, so I believe Zavala was based on Beauxbatons.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore chimed in, “I am quite assured of his qualifications as a teacher, now if you wouldn’t mind Minister, I would like to begin the introduction of Professor Goldstein to the school.”</p>
<p>Fudge shot Dumbledore a foul look but turned towards the door. There was sure to be more to come, but for now, he would let it rest.</p>
