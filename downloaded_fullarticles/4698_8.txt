  <b>Chapter One: The First Day</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Tuesday, August 27th</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A stately man approached the counter. Having waltzed into the coffee shop as if he owned the place, it was made apparent that he was a regular at Witchy Brews, the closest coffee shop to the precinct. As he got closer to the counter he noticed the man who usually took his order was absent. In his place stood the petite brunette who was normally in the back of the shop, taking inventory and stocking. He did not like it when his routine was changed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You never work the counter," a cool drawl stated, coupled with an appraising eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh. Um, yes. Someone called out today."  The woman, startled by his abrupt statement, answered the man while nervously tucking a loose curl behind her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, why? Why are you working the counter?" His voice spoke of his character: distinguished, educated, and haughty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She narrowed her eyes at him, thinking to herself, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Well that's none of his business.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Putting on her cordial business owner facade she answered the man. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We’re short staffed and someone unexpectedly quit. I'll have to fill in up front until Harry and I can get another employee." Recognition bells went off the in man's memory, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry, I wonder... </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just hire some college kid. This job can't be hard." The off hand comment spoke of this upbringing, he probably never worked a customer service job in his privileged life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not that simple. We don't hire college kids. I'm sorry, but what would you like to order?" She was getting annoyed with him, and didn't bother to hide it anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Coffee. Black. Malfoy."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, people usually give us their first name," she countered with her chin slightly raised, a little miffed at his attitude. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever.  Keep the change.”  A few bills were tossed in her direction, the measly three pennies change were dropped unceremoniously in a small ceramic tip jar, clearly homemade.  The woman rolled her eyes at this Malfoy’s behavior, scrawled his name on the cup, and passed it along to the barista on the line.  She reached behind her head and tucked the sharpie back into her riotous curls which were swept into a high messy bun.  With another huff she took the next customer’s order.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you’ve decided to grace us with your presence, Detective Malfoy!” The jovial voice broke up the chatter in the room, and all eyes turned to face the blonde man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, shove it Potter.  Someone new made my coffee this morning and I think she spit it in,” he replied with a casual shrug and a smirk.  His coffee was in one hand, with an angry looking scribble that was supposed to say “Malfoy” on it, and his other hand was near his shoulder, draping his camel colored jacket down his back.  His posture and demeanor screamed elegant ease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Hermione would do that… No doubt you deserve it.  I still don’t know why he’s here Harry!” A new voice bellowed and whined.  The owner of this voice, a tall, fit young man, with a mop of orange hair and a stampede of freckles across his face, crossed his arms</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione’s working counter, huh?” The man named Harry asked, raising a brow at the redhead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Delacroix violated his probation so he lost the job.  Hermione’s been nagging me to help her set up some interviews but with this streak of hate crimes it’s been hard to set them up,” the redhead replied, his muscular frame leaning against the desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah Ron, now that you mention it I’m pretty sure she told me, too.  Shit, that’s gonna take forever,” Harry sighed, “Maybe one of the interns can find us a list of potentials.  Oh and just ignore Malfoy-” a cursory hand was waved at Malfoy.  “I know you two don’t get along but he’s got good intuition and experience with hate crimes.”  Malfoy’s eye twitched in annoyance, as interesting he found this conversation about the snooty brunette at the coffee shop, Hermione apparently, he hated being ignored.  One does not simply </span>
  <em>
    <span>ignore</span>
  </em>
  <span> a Malfoy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah?  Experience with hate crimes?” Ron spat out, angrily, “You mean his family’s just a buncha white nationalists?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Watch it Weasley,” up until this moment Malfoy’s disposition was carefree and almost playful, but at the insult thrown at his family he stiffened up, an iciness creeping into voice.  “Leave my family out of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah…” Ron countered, getting riled up.  Harry, noticing the tension was coming to peak, butted in directing focus to their current case.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Save it for your lunch breaks, boys.  Another Jewish business in town was ransacked.  That makes the third hate crime this month…”  Harry drawled on as the men took a seat and began to look over the files, trying to draw any connections.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, Harry!  You would not </span>
  <em>
    <span>believe</span>
  </em>
  <span> the pompous </span>
  <em>
    <span>jerk</span>
  </em>
  <span> who came into the shop today!  I just wanted to throttle him!” Hermione’s exasperated cry burst through the door of Harry and Ron’s apartment.  She all but slammed the door behind and threw her wool peacoat on the coat rack.  With an exaggerated sigh she plopped down into a large, green armchair and gave Harry a sour look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Hermione,” he greeted her with a small chuckle.  “So you’ve met Draco, then?” he asked with a raised brow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco</span>
  </em>
  <span>?  His name is </span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco</span>
  </em>
  <span>?  That’s about as bourgeois as it gets!”  She threw her arms up in distaste, then quickly crossed them over her chest. “And how do </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> know him?” She asked with a piercing glare, “Please don’t tell you have to </span>
  <em>
    <span>work</span>
  </em>
  <span> with that snob!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah we do!  He’s a right prick!” Another voice joined the fray as Ron poked his head into the room, his mouth half full of what look like a deep dish pizza slice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t eat all the pizza you glutton!” Hermione countered back, jolting upright and running into Harry and Ron’s rather spacious kitchen.  Harry followed her with a smile and a slight shake to his head.  He was never quite sure how he loved his friends so much when they were so goddamn annoying. “I’ll grab the plates!  Paper or real plates, Harry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Use the paper plates, with this new case we’re not going to have time to do dishes,” Harry grumbled as he sat down next to Ron at the small maple dining table.  Hermione set down the plates in front of the boys, a napkin on each side.  In front of Harry she placed a glass of water and Ron got a glass of milk.  Hot sauce and ranch dressing were also gracefully set on the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah shit, Mione, you always remember what I like!” exclaimed Ron, dumping ranch dressing and hot sauce onto his pizza.  Hermione rolled her eyes,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not that hard Ronald.  You’ll eat everything,” though cruel sounding the words were spoken with love.  She grabbed a small slice of pizza and took a small bite.  “So is this big case the reason why you two haven’t found me a new employee yet?”  She asked, fully aware of how naggy she sounded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, actually, it is.  There’s been a lot of hate crimes targeting minority owned businesses in the area.  It’s clear they’re all connected but there’s been no message or real clues as to how.  Or what their endgame is.”  Harry grabbed another slice of pizza, “Ron, this from Martone’s?  It’s better than normal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep!  Grabbed a fresh pie on my home from the precinct.  If ya have your badge displayed they make ya a fresh pie,” Ron boasted with a broad grin and cheesy smile.  “But on a serious note Hermione, you gotta be careful.  These people are torching businesses and ruining livelihoods.  Witchy Brews is close to the precinct so you’re probably safe but you just watch out.”  Hermione hid an eye roll; she new Ron meant well but she wasn’t a child.  The incident had happened three years ago and she was fully recovered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry Ron.  We’ve got the best cameras and panic buttons due to our government funding.  Witchy Brews will be fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not just talking about the coffee shop, Mione.  These people are targeting specific groups.  Amani Kenyan Market was torched last week.  And the dumpling shop two weeks before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ron, I know.  You forget that I was on the force, too.  Just ‘cause I haven’t been in uniform for a few years doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten that people hate minorities and jewish folks.  My business and I will be fine.”  She turned a stern look on two men at the table, “So long as I get another employee to replace Delacroix.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeesh, Hermione, we’ll get it done!” Ron replied, melted cheese and pizza sauce all over his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gross Ron!  Chew with your mouth closed!!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione laid in bed, hand absent-mindedly rubbing a scar on her forearm.  She replayed the day’s events in her head, starting with the man at the coffee shop.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>So he’s a detective</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she thought.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>He must well educated, he doesn’t look very old, maybe my age.  I wonder if Harry and Ron have worked with him before.  They seemed to not like him, not that I can blame them!</span>
  </em>
  <span>  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She continued to get lost in her own thoughts, snuggled up in her cozy bed, a dark orange cat at her feet and a hand-knit afghan thrown over her quilt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her apartment was small, but she liked it that way.  Besides her bedroom there was an open concept living room and kitchen, a full bathroom, and a small office.  After the incident Harry and Ron had wanted her to move in with them but she loved her apartment and freedom.  If there was anything that Hermione hated, it was being coddled.  She had always been a free spirit with a heck of a lot of fight in her.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her apartment was tastefully decorated, with small touches of knick-knacks and kitschy items here and there.  And plenty of photos on the walls of her, Ron, and Harry.  A few photos included some other redheads, looking quite closely related to Ron.  There was an empty space on the wall, where a photo had clearly been hanging.  It must have been up for a long time because the edges of the empty space were dusty and sun faded.  A picture frame laid facedown on the console in the entry way.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sat at a fine dark oak desk, with hand carved legs and mahogany inlays.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>2:00am</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The clock blinked insistently as Draco rested his head on his hand, his other hand rubbing his sleepy eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There has to be some clues here.  A hint or something to their next target.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco often stayed up late working on cases.  He found he never slept well when there was a large case to be solved.  He sighed and looked over the reports of the past several arson crimes.  He had looked over the papers damn near a hundred times but nothing stood out.  His mind began to wander to the brat at the coffee shop…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She certainly had an attitude.  Acting like the owned the place.  Doesn’t she know the customer is king?  I certainly hope she’s not taking orders again tomorrow…</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
<span>With that errant thought he forced himself up and to bed.  He lived on the outskirts of the city in a stately manor, well adorned with the finest finishings.  It was his childhood home that had been willed to him upon his father’s passing.  His mother still lived but she preferred their summer home on the coast.  He rarely saw her but they spoke frequently on the phone.  The manor seems quite empty and lonely at times, though Draco would never admit it.  Two wings, eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, a powder room, a library… He could go on forever.  Overall the manor just felt cold to him, and often found himself wondering if it always had.</span>
