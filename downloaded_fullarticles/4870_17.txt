<br/>
Draco Malfoy could feel the noose tightening around his neck. Resisting the urge to tug at his collar and squirm in his seat, he stared his father and his damned smug smile down, wishing he could hurl himself from the window and end it all quite dramatically. Simply put, if Lucius Malfoy had his way, Draco’s life was already over. Anything he did now was of no consequence; anything he had wanted before no longer mattered. If Draco was a lesser man, he might have wept from the frustration of it all.<br/>
<br/>
“Astoria Greengrass is an exceptional young woman,” Lucius was saying, patting an all too familiar manila folder with one finger in time with his words. “She has impeccable breeding and can trace her bloodline back nine centuries. She is polite, well-mannered, and not at all hard on the eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
All of this was true, although it didn’t matter at all to Draco. He’d had his fill of polite, well-mannered, beautiful women, and had meant to go on having many more. Glaring at the manila folder, he chewed at his lip to keep from speaking.<br/>
<br/>
“Her family has been kind enough to overlook certain… political issues within our own family,” said his father with a delicate sniff. This meant, of course, that Lucius Malfoy was prepared to settle a substantial financial sum on the polite, well-mannered, beautiful, and also money hungry woman with whom they’d met earlier. Draco barely managed to suppress an eye roll. “All seems to be in line for a spring wedding.”<br/>
<br/>
Not if Draco hurled himself from the window or changed his name and vanished from the country. Swallowing hard, he tried to envision himself tied down for the rest of his life and almost had a panic attack then and there.  <br/>
<br/>
“Would it not be preferable,” he spit out from between clenched teeth, “to find a woman we do not have to buy?” This, Draco was certain, would take years.<br/>
<br/>
Lucius gave a long-suffering sigh. When he spoke next, it was to say, “And what good woman would be willing to tie herself to a Malfoy? These are ugly times for our family. Do not pretend to be ignorant of it.” Hints of impatience threaded themselves through his haughty tones. “Furthermore, what women our political allegiances haven’t frightened off have been promptly alienated by <em>you</em> and your ways.”<br/>
<br/>
These ways, oft mentioned and warned against, involved whore-mongering, drinking, gambling, and other less than reputable pursuits that made life worth living. In fact, Draco thought he excelled at all of them. Sadly, it was impossible to put this into words in a way that made for a good argument.  <br/>
<br/>
Thusly, Draco said rather lamely, “I’m only twenty-four.”<br/>
<br/>
“And I was twenty when I married your mother.” Lucius rose, hiding the cursed manila folder inside of his robes in one elegant sweep. “Speaking of, she’ll be waiting at the Manor for news. We must depart at once.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco imagined his mother hearing that he’d finally succumbed to one lucky lady in the damned Bride Folder and barely suppressed a shudder. Looking around the room, he said, “I think I’d like to stay here for the weekend.”  <br/>
<br/>
Lucius narrowed his eyes and took a look around their surroundings. The meeting with Astoria and her grasping father had occurred at a small inn in the middle of nowhere. The population of the village was dreadfully tiny, sadly lacking any stereotypical bar maidens with heaving bosoms. Draco hated it here.<br/>
<br/>
“You do not want to destroy this union,” warned Lucius, clearing having decided that there were no women around under fifty who were likely to get in the way of a spring wedding.<br/>
<br/>
Not that that had ever stopped Draco. Rising, he shook his father’s hand and actually managed to sound a little sincere when he said, “Nothing is further from my mind.”<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
“I have got to find a way out of this damned engagement.”<br/>
<br/>
Flopping back onto the couch, Draco blinked blurrily up at the ceiling. He had been angry—no, he had been livid—and then he’d been melancholy, utterly bereft. Now, he was just drunk and feeling very little outside of sorry for himself. Well, that and a strange warm floating feeling.  <br/>
<br/>
“You could kill yourself,” offered a female someone very helpfully from his left.<br/>
<br/>
Turning his head made the room spin but Draco concentrated and set his gaze on Pansy Parkinson. She was seated quite primly, red nose the only betrayal of her own inebriation. He grinned widely at her. Had he ever told her how wonderful she was? He couldn’t quite recall.<br/>
<br/>
“I love you,” he informed her, quite passionately. This had nothing to do with the conversation they’d been having and he thought hard at remembering it. Yes, his own suicide. Mournfully, he added, “I can’t very well do that. I’m the only Malfoy hair.” What? He tried again, focusing on the movement of his tongue. “<em>Heir</em>.”  <br/>
<br/>
Laughter sounded out from the chair beside Pansy. Draco loved Blaise Zabini too and extended his grin to include his friend.<br/>
<br/>
“And you’re much too vain to ever harm yourself,” Zabini interjected, smiling. “Perhaps we could hire kidnappers and hold you hostage until Astoria’s found someone richer.”<br/>
<br/>
“There is no one richer,” sighed Draco, thinking how gloriously wealthy he really was. Then he realized he couldn’t feel his toes. When had that happened? Also, he had the most overwhelming urge of a sudden to take a piss. Merlin help him, his bladder was set to explode. Standing on a lurch, he was immediately distracted from his physical needs by the fact that he could now see down Pansy’s shirt. He grinned at the gentle curve of almost hidden cleavage and was about to turn his smarmy smile to her face when she slapped him on the arm.<br/>
<br/>
“That happened once years ago,” she said, narrowing her eyes, “and it will never happen again. Focus, you randy sod.”<br/>
<br/>
Focus, yes. The loo was too far away so he went to the balcony, tripping on his feet twice on the journey. The cool night air hit him hard and he shivered, setting about relieving himself quickly. As if from a distance, he noticed lights from the window below theirs—the innkeeper, whatever her name was, was obviously still up—and he zipped his trousers swiftly to avoid being caught pissing from a balcony like a common drunk, which was precisely what he was at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
“There is a party going on downstairs,” he told his friends, pulling up his zip as he re-entered the room.<br/>
<br/>
“Should we crash it?” Around the mouth of the wine bottle, Zabini’s grin was wicked. <br/>
<br/>
“No, we shall not,” ruined Pansy. “Draco summoned us here to help him out. Do try to be a good friend, Zabini.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh yes, the problem at hand.” Zabini wrinkled his brow, apparently having as much difficultly processing thought as Draco. Wobbling, he made his way back to the couch, swiping the wine bottle on his way.<br/>
<br/>
“Do people still die in childbirth?” Zabini pondered, tapping his chin.<br/>
<br/>
“What? I don’t want Astoria <em>dead</em>. I just don’t want her alive and married to me.” His friends! What barbarians! Seriously, Draco made an internal vow to love them forever anyway. So that they might know this, he added, “Faults are what make people beau—”<br/>
<br/>
“Did you hear that Elizabeth Andrews died last week?” interrupted Pansy.<br/>
<br/>
“Elizabeth who? Have I shagged her?”<br/>
<br/>
“No,” she said to Zabini. “She is too much of a witch even for you. And, by witch, I do in fact mean bitch. Anyway, you know she only just married Jonathon two months ago. Forced marriage. Now, she’s dead and he’s free. Poor thing and all that. Perhaps someone liked her. It is very tragic not to be liked—”  <br/>
<br/>
“Pansy, we like you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Malfoy. I do not hate you either.”  <br/>
<br/>
There was a pause, filled only by the sound of three good mates proceeding to get even more sloshed. Draco was in the middle of admiring his sweater when Pansy piped up again, this time with barely contained enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
“What if you married someone everyone hates who is already dying?” she enthused, clapping her hands together at the very idea. “No one expects Jonathon to remarry, not now. In time, of course, but currently he is so busy spouting rot about much he loved that crotchety bag, rest her soul, that no one would dream of forcing another bride on him for, oh, at least a few years!”<br/>
<br/>
Draco did some mental math. He thought about all the things he could get up to in a few years, all the women he could meet, and all the liquor he could consume. The idea held potential. Thusly, he asked, “Perfect! Who do we know who is both acceptable and dying?”<br/>
<br/>
“And loathsome,” added Pansy. “That is very important so that you don’t feel bad about it at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“I can see you as a widower, Malfoy,” said Zabini. “Yes, I can see it now…”<br/>
<br/>
But there was a hitch; there was always a hitch. Sighing, Draco slouched back and admitted, “I don’t know anyone who is dying.”<br/>
<br/>
After a moment’s thought, both of his friends had to admit defeat as well. It was a true tragedy that one so beautiful, rich, and desirable as he had to be swept off the singles’ scene when he’d only worked his through a good quarter of it. Frowning, he took a morose sip of his drink, wishing that the ground would open and swallow him whole.<br/>
<br/>
“At least you’re not engaged to some one old enough to be your father,” sighed Pansy, referring to Alexander Gold. Her tone as morose as Malfoy’s expression, she added, “At least Astoria is a <em>reasonable</em> choice.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco pictured Gold, who was pushing sixty and was notoriously stingy and cruel mannered. Pansy Parkinson had accepted her fate with a stiff upper lip; truthfully, this was the first word of complaint he’d heard from her. From across the room, Zabini met Draco’s gaze.  <br/>
<br/>
“Or already married to a harpy,” Zabini said.<br/>
<br/>
That was true too. Zabini’s wife, one Mary Calder, was as demanding and high-strung as they came. Still, Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel completely sorry for his friend; he suspected that, despite the fact that Mary was clearly off her bird, Zabini was halfway to besotted, or at very least completely addled by lust. In fact, as far as Pureblooded arranged marriages went—<br/>
<br/>
A loud crash from the hallway outside of their door interrupted Draco’s brooding. Glancing at his friends, he made himself stand, listening to the cursing and muffled voices from the other side of the door. Stumbling over to it to take a peak, Draco took a sobering breath and stuck his head out. Mrs. What’s-her-name, the innkeeper, was just emerging from the room across the hall, accompanied by a man Draco didn’t recognize.  <br/>
<br/>
“What’s all this racket?” he demanded, tone lofty enough to suggest he hadn’t just pissed off a balcony or snuck in two friends without paying the extra rate.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. What’s-her-name shook her head sadly and pursed her lips. “Poor little mite,” she murmured, eyes downcast. “Too sick to travel and too sick to Apparate.”<br/>
<br/>
Great, thought Draco. Now he—or rather his father—was paying for a room across the hall from someone infected with Merlin knew what. Resisting the urge to cover his nose and mouth, Draco scowled at the innkeeper and barked, “Well, Portkey her out of here.”<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. What’s-her-name’s eyes actually watered and she sniffled into her hand, undignified and loud. Draco tipped his nose up and increased the force of his scowl.<br/>
<br/>
“It’ll have to wait until morning. We don’t have one activated to St. Mungo’s. Such a brave girl. She probably won’t last the night.”<br/>
<br/>
At that dim proclamation, the innkeeper let out a tiny sob and shook her head. Draco, drunk that he was, felt behoved to pat her awkwardly on the arm. However, halfway to her person, he hesitated, thinking of contagion and all manner of disgusting things. Standing with his arm stuck out, he shot a look over his shoulder at his friends, whose faces mirrored curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
“Who is this brave little girl then?” demanded Draco, crossing his arms to cover his awkward not-quite-reach.<br/>
<br/>
“Hermione Granger,” cried the innkeeper, dabbing at her eyes. “Worse yet, Mr. Malfoy, I can’t even reach her friends.”<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank Merlin for that. The last thing he needed was to spend one of his last single nights with a handful of glorious war heroes. He hoped Hermione Granger would die quietly; there was drinking to be done, after all. If something pinched inside him, something close to sorrow, he would simply drown it out with brandy. He didn’t give a rat’s ass about that holier than thou witch, although he could acknowledge it was somewhat… pathetic to have to die in a little inn in the middle of nowhere, too sick to travel and too sick to Apparate, without a Portkey activated. Speaking of which, it seemed like shoddy management not to have one at the ready; Draco meant to have a strong word or two about that in the morning, when he was sober.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sure she’ll be fine,” he said stiffly, before slamming the door shut in the innkeeper’s face. Grief made him uncomfortable; he had never been good with death.<br/>
<br/>
“Well?” prodded Pansy, once he was back in the living room.<br/>
<br/>
“Well,” said Draco, plopping back into his seat, “it seems that one third of the Golden Trio is dying across the hall from us. Granger, as it were.”<br/>
<br/>
It was a shame it wasn’t Weasley, he thought. Sure, he didn’t give a rat’s ass about her either way, but Granger had always been the most tolerable of the three. Perhaps he’d say a brief something in way of a eulogy over breakfast.  <em>Dearest Hermione</em>, he planned, <em>the memory of your horrid hair will be forever burned into my brain. The sound of your shrill voice will haunt my ears for eternity</em>. He rather thought it had a nice ring to it. Across the room, Pansy’s face wrinkled in thought.<br/>
<br/>
“Granger?” Zabini was saying. “She’s been poking her nose around our house all last month. She’s doing some anthro… anthropo…” He snapped his fingers. “<em>Anthropological</em> study on house elves.”<br/>
<br/>
So Draco had heard. She’d been causing quite a fuss, researching the pathetic lives of house elves in order to strengthen her case that they should be freed. He’d also heard something else. Taking a bit of glee from his next statement, he said, “I heard the Ministry has cut her funding.”<br/>
<br/>
Zabini shook his head. “And to think she’s just now dying. Not her month, is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Not at all,” agreed Draco, taking a drunken moment to sympathize with his childhood enemy. “Then again, she’s not engaged to Astoria Greengrass, is she?”<br/>
<br/>
“Suppose we should go over there and visit?” Zabini continued. “Think of it as PR work.”<br/>
<br/>
“Think of it as—”<br/>
<br/>
“The perfect solution!”<br/>
<br/>
Snapping her fingers, Pansy smiled at her friends. Draco, who had rather forgotten about her in the room, sent her a confused look; naturally, he did not like Granger, but <em>smiling</em> about her death seemed a tad cold. In fact, it was a shame that she should have such an undignified end, if he really thought about it.<br/>
<br/>
“To what?” he asked, cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
Standing, Pansy looked about ready to clap her hands. “She’s dying, Draco!”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” he agreed.<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, she most likely will not last the night. I heard Mrs. Hill. You hate her, we hate her, and all of good society hates her and her meddling ways. Think of it now, you halfwit!”<br/>
<br/>
So Draco thought, which was harder than it should have been, cursed brandy. He thought about a lot of things, and in the end, his smile was just as fiendish.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
Granger’s room, to Draco’s shock, was not guarded and the door was not locked. There was no sign of Potter or Weasley; there was no sign of anyone. Merlin bless him, it was looking like he might just get away with this most nefarious scheme. Still, he wished Pansy was with him for this terrible moment of kidnapping Granger from her sickbed; he did so hate germs.<br/>
<br/>
Swallowing, he turned the knob and pushed open the door. Darkness greeted him, broken up only by the shallow sounds of Granger’s breathing. The room stank of sickness and he almost abandoned the plan then and there. However, he reminded himself of Astoria’s money hungry ways and his own love for freedom, and it was enough to propel him forward, guided by the light of his wand.<br/>
<br/>
This room was considerably smaller than his; it took no more than ten steps to reach the single bed pushed under the window. Granger lay on her side, face shadowed and sallow. She seemed shrunken somehow; the death knell of her breathing set him on edge. From somewhere distant, he felt a pang of something that might have been a sick combination of surprised grief and guilt, but he was quick to squash it. Granger, after all, was saving him; she’d always been about saving people. Yes, it made sense that she’d probably volunteer for this position, if she was conscious.  <br/>
<br/>
“Granger,” he hissed, prodding her arm with his wand.<br/>
<br/>
She moved a little, face wrinkling, and let out a moan. Not dead yet, then. He wondered if he could levitate her down the stairs; the thought of touching someone as sick as she made his skin crawl. There was a pot by her bed, mercifully unused, and he stepped around it to get closer.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you contagious?” he whispered, voice urgent. “Say something. I do not wish to be infected by your Muggle germs.” Dying himself, after all, did ruin the plan.<br/>
<br/>
Granger muttered something and opened her eyes, gaze blank and unfocused. She coughed her way through a few breaths; Draco, freezing, waited a moment until he was certain the innkeeper wasn’t coming. Then, Granger looked at him and muttered something about daisies. Delirious then. Taking a steadying breath, he leaned forward and tugged her into a sitting position. She was hot to the touch, a scalding and stinking shell of her former glory.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re going to take a fieldtrip,” he told her, trying not to breathe in her vicinity as he pushed an arm under her. “Can you stand?”<br/>
<br/>
She couldn’t. He tried twice to get her on her feet before admitting defeat. Holding his breath, he got both arms under her and lifted her, cradling her awkwardly to his chest. Her hair tickled his chin and she felt too light, brittle even. That pang came back but he forced himself to hold steady, ignoring the disgusting scent of stale vomit that clung to her like a diseased cloak.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m going to make you the toast of Pureblood society,” he told her. “How will you like that?”<br/>
<br/>
Her forehead crinkled at his voice and she made a noise of displeasure, but she was too weak to do anything more than twitch in his hold. Adjusting, Draco took the ten steps to the door and peeked his head out. The coast was clear.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m going to make you a Malfoy,” he whispered, creeping down the hall and taking care not to smack her head or her legs into anything. There was, after all, no need to make anything worse. “My parents will be furious, of course, but at least you won’t live long enough to pollute our name. That ought to count for something.” In fact, it could even be spun favourably, all things considered.<br/>
<br/>
Granger’s lips pushed together, puckering before parting on a sigh. Out in the light of the hallway, she was completely ashen. It was a shame, he thought. However much he’d hated her, however awful he was being now, he didn’t precisely wish death upon her. It was unsettling seeing her so weak. He was used to her fire, even if he hadn’t been caught directly in its path since the end of the war.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re going on one final mission,” he crooned, reaching the door that led to the back stairs. Pansy, who had gone to bribe someone capable of performing a wedding ceremony, and Zabini, who was putting his questionable ethics to work and drawing up legal papers that could be touched up at the last moment, were supposed to be waiting for him outside. “Don’t you like missions? This is a very grand one. You’re saving me for marriage by marrying me. Such lovely trickery, don’t you think?”<br/>
<br/>
Granger’s hand fisted into his shirt. “Ron?” she muttered, voice cracking.<br/>
<br/>
The pang became a clamour. This was low, even for him. Thinking of the end goal, Draco gulped past a twang of conscience.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry,” he continued, wobbling down the steps. “I’ll see you get a funeral suitable of a Malfoy. Perhaps I’ll even donate to one of your ridiculous crusades. Would you like that?”<br/>
<br/>
“Save the house elves,” she muttered, pressing her cheek into his shoulder. She took a deep breath, lungs whining, and blinked. Her face was red and shiny; in his arms, she began to shiver.  <br/>
<br/>
“Yes, of course.” He rolled his eyes. Hermione Granger, noble until the bitter end.<br/>
<br/>
Pushing open the door with his hip, Draco manipulated them both outside. It was chilly out; Granger’s shivers became shudders. He had to hold onto her a little too much when he set her on her feet, but he managed to get his cloak around her shoulders without dropping her. There was no need to be a complete arse; in the morning, he would simply burn his contaminated clothing.<br/>
<br/>
“Merlin, she’s a mess,” breathed a voice he didn’t recognize.<br/>
<br/>
Looking up, Draco spotted his friends a few yards away, standing with a portly man of middling age.  <br/>
<br/>
“Draco, please meet Mr. Underhill,” Pansy introduced, peering at Granger with morbid curiosity. “He’s a friend of my father’s.”<br/>
<br/>
That explained away all the questionable niceties of illegal marriages, thought Draco. Zabini’s mouth was grim, but he held up a few papers.<br/>
<br/>
“Half done,” he said. “It’ll look very legitimate by <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> morning.”<br/>
<br/>
“We’re ready if you are.” Even Pansy looked like she was having qualms of conscience.<br/>
<br/>
Granger, the most oblivious of them all, swayed against his side and gagged up air. Cringing, Draco held her closer and braced himself to go through with this. He clearly was the worst sort of person.<br/>
<br/>
“So, what now?” he asked, rubbing at Granger’s arm to warm her. “Do we need a church or…?”<br/>
<br/>
“Here is fine,” decided Mr. Underhill, turning beady eyes on Draco, who had the strangest feeling that her death didn’t unnerve him at all. In fact, he looked full of fiendish delight. Unexpectedly, Draco was glad Granger wasn’t more with it. “I was made to understand that time is of the essence.”<br/>
<br/>
“That it is.” Gulping, Draco gave his soon-to-be-wife an uncomfortable squeeze. “Proceed.”<br/>
<br/>
From a distance, Draco listened to Mr. Underhill’s droning vows, focusing mainly on keeping Granger upright. She was blinking at everything, eyes unfocused, and was leaning too heavily on his side. Her hair was sticking to her forehead; Draco had never felt so uncomfortable in all of his life.<br/>
<br/>
But the end goal, and all that. As such, when the time was right, he said, “I do” quite steadily.<br/>
<br/>
Getting Granger to say it was another matter; Mr. Underhill, as underhanded as he was, insisted upon it. It took almost ten minutes of leading questions to get her to mutter the appropriate phrase. More appropriate still, Draco had to help her vomit in a bush immediately after proclaiming it.  <br/>
<br/>
Not feeling much better himself, he pried off the Malfoy ring from his finger, slipping it onto her pointer finger, the only one it would fit. The diamonds in the M winked up at him, laughed at him it seemed, and he had to pass his bride to Zabini in order to sign the papers. It was another load of work getting Granger to do so as well; in the end, her signature was hardly legible. He wished he was still sloshed. As it was, the alcohol content of his body was fading enough to leave him with the beginnings of a dull headache.<br/>
<br/>
“It’ll do,” shrugged Zabini.  <br/>
<br/>
And, just like that, it was a done deal. There was an awkward moment after the faux ceremony, before Mr. Underhill cleared his throat and departed with a pop.  <br/>
<br/>
“Congratulations?” offered Zabini, eyeing Granger as she lilted against Draco. “Poor thing really doesn’t look very well, does she?”<br/>
<br/>
Pansy, too, looked a little grey. “We did right for Draco,” she insisted, tipping up her chin. “May Granger pass quickly, for her own sake.”<br/>
<br/>
“She was a good woman, wasn’t she?” Zabini admitted, looking uncomfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
They were all terrible people, decided Draco. Aloud, he said, “I should get her back to bed.”<br/>
<br/>
His friends nodded and muttered excuses about places to be and people to see. They left him alone in the night, a shuddering Granger in his arms. Sighing, he lifted his bride—Merlin, what a term—and went back inside.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
He had expected to drift off to a blissful sleep, content in his own freedom. Astoria Greengrass would never have him now; he meant to spin a wild tale of forbidden love, complete with a tragic end. He meant many things, but all that happened in actuality was insomnia and an uneasy conscience.  <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, three in the morning found him sneaking across the hall and into Granger’s room. She was where he had left her, curled once again into her side. She’d been sick once upon returning and Draco cleared the mess from the pot with a wave of his wand. He’d heard Mrs. What’s-her-name check on her twice but now she was alone, facing death rather stoutly, he thought. If the innkeeper had noticed the addition of her client’s ring, she’d said nothing to him.<br/>
<br/>
Sighing, Draco made to sit on the bed, ignoring his germ fears in favour of easing his conscience. It was a tight fit with the both of them, but he managed to finagle enough room for her to burrow into his side. Pushing her hair off her forehead, he held her hand and listened to her breathe. He would go in an hour, he decided, but for now, he would sit with her. No one should have to die alone.  <br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry your friends couldn’t be here,” he whispered. “If that useless woman hasn’t found them by morning, I will try my best. Maybe I’ll even find you a medi-witch. Perhaps she can help ease… help make it better.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>If you’re still alive</em>, he added mentally. Granger coughed, chest heaving, and squeezed his hand weakly. She wasn’t upset, which meant she still didn’t know it was him. That was good in Draco’s books.<br/>
<br/>
“Well, Mrs. Malfoy,” he murmured, “I suppose I owe you a heartfelt thank you.”<br/>
<br/>
Except, in the darkness of her bedroom, thank you seemed like a stupid sentiment. Rubbing her back, he closed his eyes and said a quick prayer for her sake. His conscience was alive and loud but it would fade in time. He had done some horrible things, and it had always quieted in the past. Granger was dying but she had freed him. Still, it didn’t comfort him. Gently, he curled his fingers around hers and took a deep breath, listening to the clock tick in the hallway.  <br/>
<br/>
It was like this that Mrs. What’s-her-name found them an hour later. Her face was flushed with grief; truly, Draco realized, she thought Hermione Granger wasn’t going to make it. He tightened his grip on her hand, although he wasn’t sure exactly what he was wishing for. Her fingers, sticky and damp with fever, squeezed weakly back.<br/>
<br/>
“Mr. Malfoy?” exclaimed Mrs. What’s-her-name, clearly startled.<br/>
<br/>
Draco took a look at Granger’s sallow features. Now was as good a time as any to start, he figured, wishing all the bad feelings he was having would bugger off. Looking mournful was not as difficult as he’d imagined it might be when he turned his gaze on the innkeeper.<br/>
<br/>
“I imagine it must be a shock to see me like this.” Here, Draco chuckled, noting it sounded appropriately downtrodden and self-mocking.  <br/>
<br/>
“To say the least,” she said.<br/>
<br/>
Draco schooled his expression for pure melancholy, and took a deep breath. “We’re in love,” he admitted on a guilty rush. “You won’t have heard. It’s been secret, what with my father and…” He let the pause say <em>her questionable bloodlines</em> for him. It was, most importantly, all in being tactful.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. What’s-her-name looked pained. “Oh, you poor dear! I had no idea!”<br/>
<br/>
He wondered if slamming the door in her face earlier had given her that impression. Resisting the urge to roll his eyes, he angled Hermione’s hand so that the innkeeper could see his ring.<br/>
<br/>
“I know it’s not the done thing,” he murmured, hoping his downward glance looked devastated and not guilty. “I was just so afraid…” Oh, if only he could fake a sob!<br/>
<br/>
However, Mrs. What’s-her-name didn’t need fake sobs. Coming to Draco’s side, she touched his arm and offered a truly sympathetic smile. Draco died a little on the inside.  <br/>
<br/>
“That’s very romantic,” insisted the innkeeper. “She’s lucky to have a man like you.”<br/>
