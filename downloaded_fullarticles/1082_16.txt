    <p>“Draco Malfoy, do you have anything to say for yourself?” Lucius asked in a low voice.</p><p>Draco was rigid and silent as he stood in front of his father. His 19 years stood not a chance with his father's 56 years, in height and size. But the one thing that made Draco stand taller than his father was he was finally doing what he wanted to do.</p><p>“I love her father, and if you can’t accept that than you can disown me,” Draco said, grabbing the hand of the woman he was talking about.</p><p>“No, he won’t.” Narcissa stormed into the room. “Draco, can we talk to you?” Her eyes darted to the woman standing beside her son. “Alone?”</p><p>“No.” Draco held the woman's hand tighter and pulled her closer. “Anything you can say to me, you can stay to Luna.”</p><p>“Fine,” Narcissa hissed, standing up straighter. “I don’t think she is an adequate partner for you. Her hips are not wide enough to birth a child and she is much too slender to hold a child to term.”</p><p>“We’re just dating, Mother!” Draco said with an exasperated look on his face.</p><p>“She could be pregnant now!” Narcissa said, her eyes widened.</p><p>“Actually, not right now I couldn’t,” Luna said.</p><p>Draco was forced in a room with his mother and father and that was the last time he was ever separated from the girl when he was with his parents. That was also the last time Narcissa and Lucius ever questioned Luna possibly being pregnant.</p>
