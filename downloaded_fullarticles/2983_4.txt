  <span>The group of redheads waited patiently for the door to open.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Warnings of best behaviors and manners bounced between the members.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A chorus of “Yes, mum.” and “Okays” were thrown back.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>His tongue peeked out from the corner of his lip from concentration. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When the door opened, their scarred professor welcomed them in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shoes were untied and left by the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And a plate of desserts were thrust into the host’s hands. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But she could see the tears streaming silently down his cheeks.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t be too loud. Avoid touching him without permission.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The teacher instructed passing the plate off to the potion master.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Be patient,” he turned back to the family, “He’s gone through a lot.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry, dear,” She asked his head snapping up, “What’s wrong?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What happened?” It was the youngest. Her mother sent her a glare.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had all wondered but haven’t got an answer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s up to him to tell you,” was the response.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I just,” he grabbed his hair in frustration and tugged, “I can’t do it. I don’t-”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was sitting in the kitchen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes watched the snow fall through the window.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took a moment to realize that there were others around him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>In that moment she saw the effect the muggles had on him. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He avoided hugs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nearly tripped over a chair when Percy stood to close.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Severus saw the panic and started regretting inviting others over.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He seemed so small, so unsure, so fragile. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wasn’t the only one. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The defense professor took half the family for a tour.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>An attempt to avoid the claustrophobia that was attacking the boy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Would you like me to show you how to wrap gifts?” She asked softly.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As the body number decreased his breaths seemed to slow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was noticed any question about what happened was ignored.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At one point he sat on the floor holding a chocolate lab. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s so stupid,” He cried, “I’m so stupid. It’s simple. I just-” But she shushed him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They all spent individual time with him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It helped avoiding him becoming overwhelmed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With each conversation they started to see. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s okay.” she soothed to him. “It’s okay to ask for help. Even over small things.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That he wasn’t the same person that left for holiday.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That boy was shattered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was broken upon repair.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She rubbed her thumb over his knuckles, “You’ll be okay.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But there was someone new emerging.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rising from the ashes was someone who was happy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Who was strong beyond compare.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>In the moment those words left her mouth, she knew it to be true. </span>
  </em>
