</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“I hate Draco Malfoy.” Ron snarled, throwing his bag onto the floor. “I hate him and his precious pureblood this and his precious pureblood that.”</p><p>“You’re a pureblood.” Fred reminded his brother, grinning, as he dropped his own bag on the floor.</p><p>“Well, we’re blood traitors, aren’t we, so it doesn’t count.” Ron slumped into a chair.</p><p>“You can’t help blood.” Mrs Weasley said from where she was stirring something at the stove. Fred, George, Ginny, Harry and Hermione joined Ron at the table.</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Ron asked, puzzled.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to explain but Mrs Weasley stopped her with a finger.</p><p>“You have to find out for yourself.” Mrs Weasley told him. “All of you, you have to find out what it means for yourself.”</p><p>Ron squirmed uncomfortably. That had not been the reaction he expected.</p><p>“Have you got homework?” Mrs Weasley asked. Everyone apart from Ginny nodded. “Go and do it, then. Ginny, would you feed the pigs?”</p><p>Harry, Ron and Hermione left Mrs Weasley and Ginny to argue and climbed up the stairs. The Weasleys- and during term and most holidays Harry and Hermione- lived on a large farm three miles away from Hogwarts. They had pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, a pond full of frogs, fields full of barley and a house with many magically added extensions to accommodate everyone and the ghoul in the attic. It was home for Harry, because there were no abusive relatives, and home for Hermione, because she could roam at large with her magic in the wizarding world.</p><p>There were nine people around the table at dinner that night; Mr Weasley who had come in from trimming sheep hooves and Percy, the third eldest of the Weasley clan, who had been at Hogwarts fulfilling prefect duties. Percy teased Fred and George relentlessly throughout dinner, calling them out on their low grads and letter home record which was worse than Bill, Charlie and Ron (none of which had been perfect) put together. He had just finished making a particularly nasty remark about a prank they had pulled on the charms teacher when he yawned loudly. “I’d best be off to do my homework before I fall asleep. Goodnight.”</p><p>Fred and George glared at his back as he walked away. “You know,” Ginny said quietly so that neither of the adults heard, “I was going to keep this to myself so I could blackmail him, but you could use this better than I can. Percy’s got a girlfriend.”</p><p>“Has he?” George gaped joyously. “Who?”</p><p>“Penelope Clearwater. She’s a Ravenclaw. She’s a prefect, too.” Ginny wrapped her arms around herself smugly.</p><p>“How did you find out?” Ron gasped. “He didn’t actually tell you, did he?”</p><p>“Course not. I walked in on them snogging in an empty classroom.”</p><p>Fred and George were nearly beside themselves. “Really?”</p><p>Ginny nodded. “He gave me four Galleons not to say anything, but I never agreed to anything.”</p><p>“Have we told you you’re our favourite sister?” Fred beamed.</p><p>“I’m your only sister,” Ginny grumbled, but she smiled anyway.</p><p>Fred and George leaped up from their chairs and bounded over to Mrs Weasley, who was stacking plates up. “Mum, guess what?”</p><p>Mrs Weasley took a deep breath. “What’ve you done?”</p><p>“Percy’s got a girlfriend!”</p><p>Mrs Weasley’s face lit up. “Has he?” she scurried up the stairs, calling out to Percy.</p><p>The others collapsed in laughter all around the table.</p><p>“How long have you known for?” Ron asked Ginny wiping his eyes.</p><p>“Since last year.”</p><p>“And you kept quiet all summer?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Hermione pulled her timetable out of her bag and examined it. “We’ve got our first lesson with Hagrid tomorrow.”</p><p>“Any idea what it’ll be like?” Harry leaned over her shoulder and took in the rest of the next day’s classes. “Oh, we’ve got Divination tomorrow.”</p><p>“Divination? Isn’t that the one with Trelawney?” George asked.</p><p>“That’s what the timetable says.” Hermione shrugged. “Why? She isn’t awful, like Snape or someone, is she?”</p><p>“She’s not awful,” Fred began.</p><p>“But it really depends on what she’s seen in her crystal ball about your death that day.” George finished.</p><p>“I thought you two didn’t take divination.” Ginny frowned.</p><p>“We didn’t. We’ve just heard absolutely loads about her from our mates.”</p><p>“Most of them aren’t even sure why Dumbledore hired her. Apparently she’s only made one correct prophecy in class ever.” George flicked Ron on the ear. “Now lovely as this has been, and thanks again Ginny, we’ve got to go and do things.”</p><p>“I’m sure Professor Trelawney can’t be all that bad.” Hermione, always on the side of the teacher, said as Fred and George pushed and shoved each other up the stairs. “Their friends are probably just too busy messing about to notice it.”</p><p>“I need to go and put the chickens to bed.” Ginny glanced out of the window. “It’s nearly dark. You coming Hermione?”</p><p>Hermione got up and followed Ginny outside.</p><p>“What do you think my mum meant?” Ron asked suddenly.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“When she said that Malfoy couldn’t help his blood.”</p><p>“She didn’t say that.”</p><p>“She basically did.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry thought for a moment. “I dunno, really.”</p><p>“Nevermind. Mum’ll have forgotten about it completely come tomorrow.” Ron picked up the timetable Hermione had left. “Hagrid, charms, Divination, Double Transfiguration and Astronomy.”</p><p>“When does Defence Against the Dark Arts start again?”</p><p>“Uh, Thursday.”</p><p>“Do you want a game of Exploding Snap before bed?”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p align="center">~</p><p>Harry couldn’t sleep that night. He kept on thinking about what Care of Magical Creatures and Divination would be like tomorrow and that day’s run in with Malfoy was bugging him more and more every time he thought about it. He put his glasses back on and stared up at the ceiling. Ron was fast asleep, snoring slightly like he did every night, and moonlight was filtering in through a gap in the curtains.</p><p>He got up silently and padded over to the window. He peered out into the yard. Fred and George were slinking out of one of the sheds, looking suspicious. Fred glanced up and spotted Harry. He winked, grinned and held a finger to his lips, then drew a line across his throat with a finger. Harry’s eyebrows shot up into his forehead and he nodded rapidly.</p><p>Fred and George slunk back into the house and Harry went back to bed with no idea what the twins were up to, but feeling far more peaceful than he had done before having a death threat. At least the twins were still acting normally.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>
  <em>“SHUT UP!” Harry roared. The grey and white shapeless, floating figures began to cluster around him, moaning and muttering, stretching out ghoulish fingers to try and snatch him away from himself. He twisted and turned, trying to get away. One hand closed around his upper arm and he screamed as it seemed to be sucked into his bloodstream, pulling all the other figures in with it. Harry watched as his legs, hands, arms and upper body all began to turn grey and he felt his whole body turning from a solid figure into ghost-like mush. He tried to scream, but only a pitiful squeak of a despondent scream came out. He clawed at his own face but felt nothing. He thrashed and fought, trying to shake the grey out of his body but they only seemed to get sucked in more, in a never-ending stream.</em>
</p><p>“Harry! Wake up!” Ron was shaking Harry violently. “Wake up, you idiot, come on!”</p><p>Harry jolted awake. Ron was hovering over him, face pale and anxious. Harry felt hot and sticky, his hair plastered to his forehead, and realised he was lying in a pool of his own sweat. He fumbled blindly for his glasses and Ron pressed them into his hand. The smooth, cold metal felt almost alien to touch as Harry pushed them onto his face.</p><p>“You were having a nightmare.” Ron said quietly. “You were screaming and screaming and screaming. I had to wake you up, coz, I couldn’t leave you in there and besides, you were going to wake the whole house up!”</p><p>“Thanks.” Harry wiped his face on the duvet. “What time is it?”</p><p>Ron glanced at a clock. “It’s half past three. Too early to get up.”</p><p>Harry sank his head onto his pillow and yet again found himself staring unblinkingly up at the ceiling. “Was I screaming much?”</p><p>Ron nodded. “It sounded like a really bloody awful dream, mate. Can you remember it?”</p><p>“Yeah. There were loads of grey things and then they were all getting sucked into me and then I was turning into one of the grey things and it was awful.”</p><p>“Sounded it.” Ron yawned.</p><p>“Did I wake you up?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“No worries.” Ron shook his head and climbed back into bed. “G’night Harry.”</p><p>“Night Ron.”</p><p align="center">-</p><p>Harry barely got any sleep that night. He reckoned he got another hour of sleep between being woken up from his nightmare and getting up to get ready for school. The Burrow, as always in the mornings, was full of people rushing about getting ready for work or school while Mrs Weasley tried her very best to feed them all before they left the house. Mr Weasley was the first to leave, going up to the cow shed mere moments after Harry and Ron walked blearily into the kitchen and started eating sausages.</p><p>Percy was next to leave, wearing perfectly ironed robes and with impeccably combed hair, shooting a smirk at his siblings. Hermione came down for breakfast, already dressed, and Ginny tried to finish a Charms essay while shoveling scrambled eggs into her mouth. There was a loud chorus of squawking chickens from outside and Mrs Weasley rushed to go and feed them as well.</p><p>Fred and George came in, ruffled everyone’s hair and in doing so knocked a goblet of pumpkin juice all over Ginny and her essay. Mrs Weasley had it all cleared up and Ginny’s essay back in pristine condition in a matter of seconds but that didn’t stop Ginny from yelling blue murder at her brothers. Harry, Ron and Hermione made a hasty retreat when a teapot started getting thrown around.</p><p>“I’m just going to get my bag quickly and then I’m going to school. I want to see if I can catch Professor Flitwick to talk about the Hexes we were doing the other day.”</p><p>“Alright.” Harry and Ron jogged upstairs to get ready and Hermione left out of the rarely used front door (which was almost completely covered in ivy) as to go out of the back door, would have meant crossing the firing line between Ginny and the twins.</p><p>“Don’t forget your gloves.” Harry reminded Ron as they consulted their timetable for the books they’d need.</p><p>“what do we need them for?” Ron frowned.</p><p>“Care of Magical creatures. On the kit list for the year, it said we’d need them.”</p><p>Ron groaned. “Ugh, does that mean we have to take the textbook in with us today?”</p><p>Harry nodded and looked at the suitcase he and Ron had locked theirs up in. “Shall we take them out of the suitcase and tie them up or shall we just carry them in the suitcase?”</p><p>“Suitcase.” they said simultaneously.</p><p>“I’ll carry it if you take my bag.” Harry offered.</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>In the kitchen, Ginny was washing scrambled egg out of her hair in the sink and Fred and George were wolfing down pieces of toast. By the colour of her face, Harry guessed that Mrs Weasley had just been telling them off.</p><p>“We’re going now.” Ron said.</p><p>Mrs Weasley brightened up. “Okay dears.” she gave them each a hug. Just as they were walking out of the door, she called for them to stop. “Have you got your homework?”</p><p>“Yes.” they chorused.</p><p>“And all your books?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Good. Try not to get into trouble and remember what I said last night. You have to find out what not being able to help blood means.”</p><p>“Do we have to?” Ron groaned.</p><p>“Yes. Now off you go or you’ll be late for school! Ginny have you finished washing your hair yet? School starts in- goodness me is that really the time?”</p><p>Harry and Ron began their trek through the farmyard and onto the road to school.</p>
