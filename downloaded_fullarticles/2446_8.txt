    <p>Harry came into the common room after winning the Triwizard tournament. As he was putting the sack of gold in his trunk, he heard Ron mutter from the other side of the room, “As if he didn’t already have enough gold and fame…”</p><p>Harry sighed. He had had it up to here with his so-called best friend. He had been considering offering this since he found the spell and had told himself that Ron seemed better since they reconciled. He had decided that he would offer it though the next time the redhead’s jealousy flared up and it looked like it didn’t take as long as he thought. “You know what, Ron? You have no idea what my life is like.”</p><p>Ron snorted. “Oh like it’s really so bad.” Ron had heard the little Harry said about his relatives but took it with a grain of salt. It was just Harry trying to get sympathy with the little orphan routine. He was sure of it. </p><p>Harry sighed. “I’ll tell you what. I found a spell when I was studying for the third task. It will allow us to switch places. It lasts six months. If you want, we can do it. You can be me and I’ll be you.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes lit up with greed. If he was Harry Potter, he would have access to all his money and he would get all the fame. “What’s the catch?” he asked suspiciously. </p><p>Harry shrugged. “No catch. The only side effects are the fact that if one of us dies then the switch is permanent.”</p><p>Ron considered it for a moment. How hard would it be to get Harry killed when he was in Ron’s body? Then he could be Harry Potter for good. That was assuming Harry could die in the first place which he wasn’t so sure about. Maybe that Potter luck would come with the body and Harry would end up with Ron Weasley’s crappy luck. Then it should be a piece of cake. “Okay, sure. Let’s do the spell. Then you can see what it’s like to be me.” See how Harry likes being poor and the least of his brothers and looked down on by the whole family for it. </p><p>Harry shook his head at Ron’s stupidity and went to the library to find the book with the spell. An hour later, Ron was Harry and Harry was Ron. Ron waited until Harry went to sleep and opened his trunk and pulled out the sack of gold and just let it run through his fingers for a few minutes. He had never seen so much gold in his life. He fell asleep that night with a smile on his face. </p><p>Harry figured out one downside to the spell that night. He may be in Ron’s body, but he still had his own mind. He still remembered the death of his parents and Cedric and the nightmares followed him over. Oh well, at least he could be at least somewhat incognito like this. He was definitely looking forward to a break from being ‘The Boy Who Lived’.  </p><p>The next morning they got down to the great hall, and one look at the newspaper showed that the Daily Prophet didn’t waste any time. The headline “The Boy Who Lied” was blazoned across the front page. He looked over to see Ron’s reaction and saw him basking in the glory of being on the front page and not even noticing how people were looking at him. Harry shook his head at the ridiculousness and continued eating. He was surprised at how much he ate before he was full. Even after four years of Hogwarts cooking ten months of the year, he still was never able to eat as much as he probably should. The side-effect of being starved all his life. </p><p>Over the next two weeks before the express took them home, Harry watched Ron continue to be oblivious about how people were looking at him and the things they were saying behind his back. He continued to bask in a spotlight that wasn’t there. It only took about three days before Hermione asked him, “What is going on with Harry? He’s not acting like himself.”</p><p>Harry shrugged and looked over at the parody of himself that Ron was playing. “I think he’s just on a high after surviving the tournament. I’m sure he’ll be back to normal after the summer,” he lied. He figured a summer of the Dursley’s would take the shine off Ron’s attitude. At least he should be acting a little more like Harry then. Hermione still looked suspicious but let it drop. By the time they got on the express to go home, Harry was more than a little excited. He would get to see what it was like to be a part of a real family. To be greeted by parents at the station and go to a real home. He knew that Mrs. Weasley considered him part of the family anyway, but it wasn’t the same. Not really. </p><p>Ron pulled Harry aside on the train to ask for some info. “So your family…what are their names again? Just so I don’t look like an idiot and all.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but smirk. “Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, my cousin.” The smirk dropped from his face. “Look. Ron. Whatever you do this summer, just keep your head down. Do what they say and try not to cause any trouble. You’ll just make it worse on yourself.”</p><p>Ron snorted. So Harry was still trying to pull the ‘my family is mean’ game. Like Ron wouldn’t see through that the moment he went home with them. “Sure, Harry. Don’t worry,” he placated his friend. </p><p>Harry could see that Ron was just brushing him off and sighed. That was okay. He would see. It would serve him right to be a punching bag for the summer and he knew if it got too bad, Dumbledore would pull him out. He insisted that he’d been keeping an eye on things and that Harry would be fine. He trusted the headmaster to keep that promise. </p><p>The train pulled into the station and Harry pulled Ron’s battered trunk down from the luggage rack with a smile. Time for the best summer of his life. He was pulled into Mrs. Weasley’s waiting arms when he stepped off the train and hugged her back just as tightly, not noticing her surprise at that. He watched impassively as she hugged Ron as Harry too and told him to have a good summer and write. Harry watched him walk over towards the Dursley’s with a little bit of trepidation. Part of him felt bad for putting Ron in this position, but he really did bring it on himself. </p><p>Ron walked over to the Dursley’s. He recognized them from when they picked Harry up for the world cup. “Hey. We ready to go?” he asked cheerfully. Vernon grunted at him and turned to walk towards the car and he frowned slightly as Petunia looked down her nose at him before turning and following her husband. “Hey, can I get a little help?” he asked hopefully dragging the trunk and Hedwig’s cage along with him. He didn’t get a response. </p><p>Once he got to the car and managed to get everything in the trunk, he got in the backseat. “About time, boy,” Vernon snapped impatiently. </p><p>Ron figured they may just be in a bad mood from something so changed the subject. “So, where’s Dudey? He didn’t come?” </p><p>Vernon’s hands tightened on the steering wheel as his face began to turn red. Petunia sneered at him. “/Dudley/ is at home. He doesn’t need to be exposed to your freakishness any more than he has to be.”</p><p>Ron blinked at that. She must be upset because he got the name wrong. “Sorry. Okay. How’s about you drop me off at Diagon Alley so I can do some shopping and you can pick me back up in a few hours?” Ron suggested hopefully. There was no way he was gonna wear Harry’s orphan rags all summer. </p><p>The car suddenly screeched to a halt at the side of the road and Vernon turned around with a face full of fury. “If you think for one second that we will be playing your chauffer then you must have been hit on the head at that freak school of yours. You will sit back there and shut up until we get home and then you will start on your chores. You have a lot of time to make up for after that freakishness you went to last summer and there’s a lot that needs to be done, and so help me if you don’t wipe that smile off your face I’ll beat it off of you.”</p><p>Ron’s eyes went wide and he nodded slowly. Okay, so maybe Harry was telling the truth about his family being nasty.</p>
