  <strong>Saturday, 24th October 1981<strong></strong></strong>
</p>
<p>It was horrible. The war was horrible, and yet, there was nothing they could do. After three years of joining the Order of the Phoenix, they had hoped to make a difference. They were Gryffindors, damn it! If there was anything they could have done, they would have done it a thousand times over. But was there truly a way? Was there anyone strong enough to take the Dark Lord down? Twenty-one-year old Elizabeth Lena Pine clenched her fists, digging her nails deep into her palm. They had lost too many good people over the years.</p>
<p>Marlene McKinnon.</p>
<p>Dorcas Meadowes.</p>
<p>Edgar Bones.</p>
<p>Caradoc Dearborn.</p>
<p>Benjy Fenwick.</p>
<p>The Prewett Twins: Fabian and Gideon. God, she missed them both and their god-awful jokes. They were all killed, murdered, desecrated, overpowered. Lena took a deep breath. No, no, <em>no<em>. They will not be remembered that way. They will be remembered as fighters, survivors, brave, talented. They had all fought bravely and they should be remembered for that. Lena stood up from her chair and paced the room, her shoes tapping the wooden floorboards in an annoying manner. She stopped, feeling a hand on her shoulder. Lena turned around, forcing a smile onto her face.</em></em></p>
<p>“Sorry, Lils,” she apologised to her auburn-haired best friend. She noticed the one-year-old in Lily’s arms and she started cooing at the baby, trying to make him laugh, or whatever it is babies do that represented laughter.</p>
<p>Lily smiled softly, holding up her young Harry for Lena to carry. Lena took Harry into her arms and continued cooing at the giggly boy. “Don’t worry, Lena. I <em>know<em> how you’re feeling.” Lily’s eyes glazed over, as though she was remembering happier times. Lena knew she did that quite a lot too. “I missed them too… I missed them all.”</em></em></p>
<p>“C’mon now, ladies,” James Potter interrupted, making his way over to his wife to plant a kiss on her cheek. “Dumbledore must have a plan. We should trust him.” James reached over, picking his only son up and stuck his tongue out at Lena. “<em>My<em> son. Go get your own son.” </em></em></p>
<p>Lena smack James’ arm and glared. “In case you need help seeing, I don’t have a son, James.”</p>
<p>Lily was just shaking her head at her husband and her best friend. The talented witch walked off to the kitchen and left the two bickering about Harry as they usually did the minute Harry was born and Lily named Lena as Harry’s godmother. She carried a tray of three cups of hot tea over to the living room and placed them on the table. She beckoned at the bickering duo to take a seat as she snatched Harry from her husband’s arms. James pouted, but didn’t try to take his son back.</p>
<p>“Are they going to be here soon?” Lena interrupted the silence, feeling the itch to start pacing again as her left hand reached into her pocket to feel her wand. She always felt safer with a wand in her hand; it had saved her life countless of times, after all. “I’m going to be late meeting Moody at this rate.” She ran her fingers through her shoulder-length black hair, untangling the knots that formed while mumbling ‘ow’ under her breath.</p>
<p>Lily shook her head, bouncing Harry on her lap to get the boy to sleep, but Harry was too excited to see his godmother. “I don’t like it. Why are they always sending you out? Why can’t they send <em>someone else<em>?” Lily pulled Lena close to her as James took Harry from Lily to give the two women a chance to talk. “What if- what if you die out there, Lena?” </em></em></p>
<p>The tears threatening to fall from Lily’s eyes made Lena’s own eyes start to water. “Don’t you dare! Lils, don’t start crying because if you do, I will too and I really hate crying. Please don’t cry.” Lena pleaded, trying to get Lily to stop. Lena sighed as Lily continued to sniff. “You know I have to go on these missions. We don’t have that many members left. You and James, and Frank and Alice are in hiding. Remus is undercover with the werewolves. We don’t have that many Order members left and you know we can’t call anyone else. And we can’t even think about calling Arthur and Molly to join the group. You know the Weasleys have six children to care for.”</p>
<p>A warm hand placed on Lena’s shoulder made everyone turn around to see a familiar charming black-haired wizard by the name of Sirius Black. He instantly reached out and placed an index finger on Lena’s lips. “I know, I know. I’m late. You can yell at me later, but right now, we have to talk.”</p>
<p>“Did anyone die today, Padfoot?” James asked.</p>
<p>Sirius’ face hardened. “Yes, seven muggles are dead.” He squeezed Lena’s shoulder as she closed her eyes and bit her bottom lip. “Thankfully, Diggle and I captured the three Death Eaters before more could be killed.”</p>
<p>Lena placed her hand on Sirius’ and sighed, “is Diggle still wearing that hideous purple top hat of his? That thing’s attracting too much attention.” She shook her head, moving to stand up and give Sirius Black a hug.<br/>
“If there’s one thing we know about Diggle,” Sirius began, a twinkle of mirth in his eyes. “He sure knows how to get attention.”</p>
<p>James chuckled, standing up to pass Harry to the young boy’s godfather. “Harry here has been missing his dog, Padfoot. That and his broom.”</p>
<p>“<em>What<em>? Does young Harry have plans to be a Chaser like <em>you<em>, Prongs?” Sirius watched as Harry reached out to grab his moustache. Sirius kept moving his head back to avoid the boy’s grubby hands, but Harry just giggled and kept trying. “Restless little thing!” Sirius teased, barking out a laugh. James took Harry back into his arms while the two women just shook their head with a soft smile. The quartet continued talking and reminiscing about their schooling days, none of them wanted to talk about the present and the war. By the time they were done with their cups of tea, Lena stood up and hugged each of them.</em></em></em></em></p>
<p>“I can’t possibly sit around and wait for Peter to get here,” Lena announced, pulling out her wand from her pocket. “Are you sure you want to have Peter as your Secret Keeper, Lils, James?”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t suspect him, Lena,” Sirius interrupted, adamant about the plan. “The Death Eaters wouldn’t think of Wormtail. It’s the <em>perfect<em> plan!” </em></em></p>
<p>Lena rubbed her neck, a feeling of unease forming. She looked reluctant, but she knew that Lily needed her approval. Lily needed Lena to agree with this plan and Lena wanted nothing more than to assure Lily’s safety. “Alright, fine.” Lena said at last, giving Lily one last tight hug and Harry a peck on the forehead. “Just, <em>please<em> be careful. If you need anything, anything at all, you know where to find me.”</em></em></p>
<p>“Of course, you too,” Lily agreed, her eyes watering again. “Be careful out there.”</p>
<p>Lena grinned, flipping her black hair back with flair, “what are you talking about? I’m always careful.”</p>
<p>Sirius smirked. “And I’m a purple hippogriff.”</p>
<p>Lena rolled her eyes, flashing her middle finger at Sirius as she apparated away to the sound of people laughing.</p>

<strong>Saturday, 31st October 1981<strong></strong></strong>
</p>
<p>Lena should have listened to her own feelings. She knew something bad was going to happen. The lack of Death Eater activity should have raised a lot of alarm, but for some reason, everyone seemed to take it as a sign of the enemy weakening. That was, of course, a whole load of bull. Lena didn’t like feeling helpless. She didn’t like being kept in the dark and, so she went off to the Ministry of Magic. Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, in all his gruff glory, guffawed as soon as he saw her. Lena rolled her eyes.<br/>
“Come on, Moody, there must be something for me today,” she said, walking over to the famed auror.</p>
<p>“And as I’ve been telling you all morning, Pine,” his mouth twisted into an awkward smile. “There’s nothing for you. Take a break, Pine. You deserved it.”</p>
<p>Lena scrunched up her nose, letting out a long sigh. “<em>I can’t<em>.  Somethin’ bad is happening today and I can just feel it in my bones.” She raised her index finger up, silencing the older auror. “I trust my instincts, Moody and you know they’ve never steered me wrong.” She leaned against the table, her fingers drumming it in an attempt to calm her nerves. She needed to do something.  Anything. Capture more Death Eaters. Get in a fight. Heal someone. <em>Anything!<em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p>Moody grunted, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. “Look, Pine, you were out in the field too much and you’re just not used to a break.”</p>
<p>Lena threw her hands up in the air. “I’m going on patrol then. Don’t try to stop me, Moody.” She warned, pulling her wand out.</p>
<p>Moody just shook his head, a smirk on his face. The poor man had no idea that he should have stopped her while he had the chance. He had no idea how right the young female auror was and how he was going to regret his decision.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Lena Pine apparated to the familiar streets of London, keeping an eye out on anyone suspicious. Unlike the other aurors in the Ministry of Magic, Lena knew how to blend in with the muggle community. She always had a talent for dressing appropriately to avoid unwanted attention. She pulled on the sleeves of her sweater, shivering a little from the cold. She didn’t want to believe that something bad would happen, but she wouldn’t put it past her luck. Besides, trouble tended to follow her—no matter what.</p>
<p>Lena ignored the ogling eyes of several muggle men and continued walking. She didn’t have time for any of that when there’s war. She wondered how Lily and James were doing with young Harry. Lena missed her little godson. She knew Lily would be so annoyed but happy as the Marauders and Lena wanted to bestow on Harry some of their greatest Hogwarts pranks. Lena could easily hear the reprimanding voice of Professor Minerva McGonagall. She missed the older woman. She missed being in Hogwarts and not having to keep fighting in the war. She forced her way through the dinner time rush, her heels clacking along the pavement floor. Maybe she should drop by Godric’s Hollow, Lena thought to herself. It didn’t seem like the Order or the Ministry would be calling for her anytime soon. She rounded into an empty alleyway and apparated to Godric’s Hollow, moving quickly to the Potter’s cottage.</p>
<p>That was when everything went wrong.</p>
<p>Lena looked up at the visible Potter’s cottage and froze. She shouldn’t have been able to see the building. The door to the cottage was left wide open. No, she thought to herself. No, no, no, no, no. Her feet hurried over to the cottage before her mind could even process it. She noticed the swaying black-haired man standing by the doorway, a look of shock, fear, sadness, and anger etched on his face. “S-Sirius,” Lena whispered, rubbing at her eyes. Sirius staggered towards her, wrapping her in his arms. A familiar hand lying on the floor by the door made her choked back a sob. “What… what happened?” Though she didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>Sirius tightened his hold on her, “they’re <em>dead<em>, Lena.” His mellow tone made her heart break. Sirius was anything but mellow. He was always the heart of the party. He was always the fire, the lion charging into everything and anything head first. He was always one of her closest confidante. She untangled herself from him and made to enter the house when Sirius pulled her back, shaking his head. “No, let me go in first. If <em>He<em> is still here, I want you to run and get Dumbledore. <em>Don’t<em>. I can’t lose you too, Lena.”</em></em></em></em></em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em>Lena nodded, though she had her wand out and had absolutely no intention of running away. If Voldemort was still there, she was going to kill him, or she would die trying. She didn’t care anymore. They made their way inside, Lena holding back her tears at the sight of James Potter’s dead body on the floor. She clenched her fist. The Potters were unprepared. James was unarmed. Lena squeezed Sirius’ hand, reminding the older wizard to keep moving on. They needed to find young Harry. The stairs creaked under their combined weight. Sirius pulled his own wand out as they leaned close to the wall. The door to Harry’s room was left ajar. Sirius pushed the creaky door and he heaved a sigh of relief at the crying toddler. Sirius pulled Harry into his arms, rocking him and trying to calm the young boy. Lena froze again at the sight of Lily’s dead body. She got on her knees and pulled Lily close to her. Her breathing grew ragged as her tears ran down her cheeks.</em>

          <em>
            <em>Sirius got down and forced Lena to look at him. “I’m sorry, Lena,” he whispered.</em>

      <em></em>
        <em></em>
          <em></em>
            Lena took a deep breath, “me too.” She glanced at Sirius’ grief-stricken face and knew that she was probably mirroring him. She stood up. There was no way she could leave it like this. No, someone had to take responsibility for this… <em>attack<em>. She ran her fingers over Sirius’ cheek and leaned in to kiss Harry on the forehead. “I’m sorry, Sirius. I truly am. Take care of Harry.” She gave one last long look at her deceased best friend and apparated away.</em></em><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>“<em>Bombarda Maxima<em>!” Lena’s brown eyes flashed dangerously as an entire column of wall crumbled down. “Peter Pettigrew!” She yelled, as she noted that his hiding place was perfectly intact except for the wall she destroyed. No struggle. Her heart sank. They were all played by that sneaky rat. Lena tightened her grasp on her wand, scanning the place for the betrayer—the one who helped kill James and Lily. How dare he?! She heard a twig snap. “<em>Protego<em>.” Lena muttered as she turned around to see four Death Eaters surrounding her.
</em></em></em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em></em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>It was a trap. Of course, it was. A forest had to be the best place to launch an attack. They must have expected someone to drop by, but it didn’t matter. Lena knew she could take them on if she need to, but there was no time for that</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em></em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“<em>Everte Statum<em>!” Lena didn’t stay to watch if the Death Eaters were chasing her after being flung away by her spell. She knew they would chase her as soon as they got on their feet again and she took off running. “</em>Fumos</em>.” Dark smoke began covering the entire area, making it almost impossible to see. Lena felt a certain tingling sensation in her body, a familiar sensation that she didn’t want to have now. “Not now,” she muttered, breathing heavily as she fled. She needed to warn Sirius, Remus, and Dumbledore. She didn’t have time to duel with the robe-clad worshippers of Voldemort. She didn’t have time to vanish off the face of the earth. The buzzing noise ringing in her ears was like a warning. She didn’t have time. She had wanted to stay here. She had made friends and family here. She didn’t want to leave before avenging her friends’ death.
</p>
<p>

      <em></em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
 Lena stopped running, turning around to face the four Death Eaters again. She smirked, looking at the wands pointed straight at her. She raised her beautiful ebony wand and thought of the moment she and Lily decided to be best friends as they ignored the Marauders with cheerful laughter ringing in the Gryffindor Common Room. <em>“Expecto Patronum<em>!” She yelled, and sent her Patronus with a clear message to the Order members: <em>Peter Pettigrew has betrayed us<em>.</em></em></em></em></p>

<p>
  <em><em><em>She had heard the Death Eaters yelling </em>Avada Kedavra as everything vanished from view. Where she was going, the killing curse would not get to her in time. Once the ringing in her ears stopped, she looked around and groaned. Lena was still dressed in the same dirty, but now oversized clothes as before and she was still having her wand in her hand. She looked up to see the familiar and majestic Hogwarts Castle. She had thought she had left this world. Pulling out a pocket watch from where it was hidden around her neck, she flipped it open.
