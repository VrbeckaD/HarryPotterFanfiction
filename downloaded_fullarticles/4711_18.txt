    <p>Y/N's heart sank as she read the news that lay printed in black and white in front of her. The ministry was now under Death Eaters control from what she could gather though it was still functioning. The news reports that were surrounding her government had become increasingly worrisome.<br/>
A few days ago, she had received the Daily Prophet that informed her that muggleborns would now be subjected to a registration process. The article was inconclusive but Y/N knew what this meant, muggleborns were no longer safe. The world has been hurtling towards darkness for the past few years and her type of wizard were some of the most uninviting kind to the dark lord. Now he had control he wasn't going to spare them.<br/>
Her mother was out and her younger brother was upstairs sleeping so she was left to eat breakfast alone. Sipping coffee and reading the newspaper the quiet made the news feel heavier. It was the phone that made her jump. The loud ringing echoed from the phone that rested upon the kitchen wall. Collecting herself she raised up from her seat and stretched to pull it down.<br/>
‘Hello,’ she said and listened as a low hoarse voice spoke through the phone<br/>
‘YN is that you?’ the voice said, though it was strained as pain was making it hard to speak, nevertheless she recognised it immediately.<br/>
‘Dean? What's the matter I- ‘<br/>
‘I need to see you.’<br/>
‘Why?’<br/>
‘It's important, look I have to go- but meet me at that cafe we went to last time I visited your house the one on the high street in like half an hour,’ the phone clicked off and the dial tone rang out. Panicked Y/N threw the receiver back in its holder and headed upstairs to change. Leaving a note for her brother she grabbed her coat and keys and headed out the door.</p><p>It wasn't far from her house, the cafe, she and Dean had gone there with Seamus a couple years back then the boys had been to visit over summer. She got there quickly and when she arrived her eyes scanned the small array of tables for Dean. There were only a couple of other people in the cafe and a young waitress who sat behind the counter with an expression of boredom. However, Dean was nowhere around and so she entered the cafe and plonked herself in a seat facing the large window that made the shops face.</p><p>At every person who walked past or each jingle of the bell as people came and went Y/N’s head flicked in hope. She ordered a cup of tea in hopes of not being thrown out and continued waiting. Eventually, Y/N heard a distinct popping noise outside the cafe and the rattle of a bell. Looking up she saw Dean as he ambled in, wincing as he walked. He was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and though it was summer he was bundled into a hoodie. His lip was split and there was a purplish hue to his dark skin around his eye. He approached the table and sat down, smiling forcefully as he did.</p><p>‘Hey,’ he said as Y/N looked at him in disbelief<br/>
‘Hey? You call me out of the blue demanding a meeting and show up looking like shit and all you can say is hey. What the hell is going on?’<br/>
‘It's complicated,’ YN paused for a minute biting back the sarcastic retort the bubbled on her tongue and then quietly she whispered, ‘Dean who did this to you?’<br/>
‘Snatchers.’<br/>
‘Snatchers?!?!’ She shouted before looking round to see if she had diverted any attention she liked at Dean for him to continue<br/>
‘Yes.’<br/>
‘Shit, do you mean- ‘<br/>
‘The ministry started a muggleborn registration commission. I was one of the first on the list for some reason so I got a letter to report to the ministry early last week but I heard what they'd been doing to muggleborns," he paused his bruised face looking sour, "taking them in stripping them of their wands. Saying they weren't wizards. There are stories everywhere, whispers. So, I didn't show and they sent snatchers to find me, nasty bunch. Gave me these," he said gesturing at the bruises.<br/>
‘They did that?’<br/>
‘Half and half. Some nasty curses and me trying to escape.’<br/>
‘Oh, my God.’<br/>
‘So, when I got out I went home, packed a bag and ran. Got them off my tail I think’<br/>
‘So why come here?’<br/>
‘Because you’re not safe,’ Y/N frowned. She and Dean had been friends since their first year navigating the wizarding world as two kids without a clue, relying on Seamus for help.</p><p>‘What do I do?’<br/>
‘Same as I’m doing, staying out of the way and laying low.<br/>
‘What about school?<br/>
‘School?’<br/>
‘You can't just leave school!’<br/>
‘With Snape as headmaster and new teachers there. They're really suspicious, I've been reading up and it's not safe anymore! I’m going on the run and you can come with me.’<br/>
‘You really think this is it?’<br/>
‘Yeah, I do," he said reaching forward and placing a hand on hers, ‘we’re in danger and I think this is our only option.’<br/>
‘I don't think- ‘Y/N started but her sentence was cut off by a blast. Their conversation had been so riveting she hadn't noticed the two snatchers slip in the door.<br/></p>
