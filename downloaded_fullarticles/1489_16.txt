    <p>Izaya groaned and clutched his head as he lifted himself off the ground. Everything hurt. What the hell happened? Last thing he remembered was fighting with Shizuo then... nothing. He looked around. Everything was empty, just pure blank whiteness, like an empty sheet of paper. Izaya sighed.</p><p>"I can't be dead, it's too bright and shiny and clean to be hell. I'm probably in a coma, or I'm just asleep." He muttered, sitting down on the hard white ground.</p><p>"IIIIZAAAAYAAAA!" Shizuo's voice suddenly rang out. Izaya turned towards the other male, as the blond stormed towards him.</p><p>"Yep, that settles it. This is a dream. No way Shizu-chan would die after killing me, he'd go to jail but wouldn't die." The informant chuckled to himself as the blond grew closer</p><p>"What the hell are you talking about flea? Where the hell are we and what the hell did you do?" Shizuo yelled, picking Izaya up and shaking him angrily.</p><p>"Hush, dream Shizu-chan." Izaya said, smirking and closing his eyes as if expecting something. Shizuo dropped the informant, causing him to look at the blond in surprise. </p><p>"What the hell is wrong with you, flea? This isn't a damn dream!" He growled, as confusion flashed on Izaya's face.</p><p>"Well, it certainly seems to not be a dream now, you didn't do what Shizu-chan usually does in my dreams." The raven haired male sighed.</p><p>"What the hell are you dreaming about me doing, flea?" Shizuo said, his discomfort evident on his face as he stepped away from Izaya. </p><p>"Nothing like that, Shizu-chan, you dirty boy, just you try to punch me but can't land a single hit, and you get so angry.~" Izaya chuckled at Shizuo's enraged face.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky changed, instead of plain white it seemed to be like a movie screen, well, it was a bit more like a first person video game. Izaya and Shizuo watched in shock as whoever they were watching opened a door and stepped out before closing it. The arms of the person were skinny and their clothes hung off their body, clearly way too big for them. The person walked towards another door, when it was suddenly stopped and turned around. A women's face appeared in front of them. </p><p>"You ungrateful brat! You were supposed to be up two hours ago! Go make breakfast now! And you aren't getting any of it!" Her shrill voice screeched as she delivered a slap to the persons face. A small voice spoke out, coming from the person Izaya and Shizuo were watching.</p><p>"Sorry Aunt Petunia." The meek voice said, before the person quickly rushed into the kitchen and started making breakfast. Shizuo let out a growl.</p><p>"The hell? This kid can't be more than 6, why is this woman making them make breakfast? And refusing them the breakfast their being forced to make?" He yelled, turning to Izaya, who was on his phone. Izaya then threw his phone down in frustration.</p><p>"I tried to call the cops but I couldn't connect, then I tried to call somebody else to call the cops, but for some reason my phone just refuses to work!" He yelled out. There were only a few things that humans did that Izaya didn't love and abusing children was one of them.</p><p>"Please stop yelling." The meek voice from before whispered. Shizuo and Izaya looked around, before realizing it had come from the screen.</p><p>"You can hear us?" Izaya questioned, stepping closer to the screen. The screen bobbed, like the person had nodded. Izaya and Shizuo shared a wide eyed glance. ]"Uhm, what's your name?" Izaya asked as gently as possible.</p><p>"I think it's Harry, but my aunt and uncle usually just call me Brat and Boy." The voice, Harry, answered.</p><p>"Ha... Ri. Hari? That's an odd name." Shizuo muttered.</p><p>"Shizu-chan it's an English name, not Japanese. It's not odd in English speaking countries." Izaya explained.</p><p>"You guys are Japanese?" Harry questioned.</p><p>"Yep. The names Izaya Orihara, and the dumb one is Shizuo Heiwajima, but I call him Shizu-chan!" Izaya grinned. </p><p>"Hey!" Shizuo yelled, glaring at Izaya. At Shizuo's yell, Harry winced. </p><p>"Oh, sorry." The blond said, much softer this time.</p><p>"It's ok. I know the yelling isn't directed at me, it's just hard to deal with because it's right in my head." Harry explained.</p><p>"Anyway, I think I'm part Japanese, or some sort of Asian, because my cousin always makes fun of my for my eyes and my uncle sometimes mutters about me being 'yellow' or something like that." Harry said, looking down.</p><p>"I'll kill them." Shizuo said in a low, angry voice.</p><p>"No, no! Don't! It's my own fault for being ungrateful. I deserve everything they say to me." Harry said, before suddenly looking up a the door to the kitchen slammed open. A pudgy boy stood there, glaring at Harry. </p><p>Dudley.. what are yo-." Harry was cut off by the other boy yelling.</p><p>"Mummy! Daddy! Harry was speaking in a weird ching chong language!" He yelled, before sending an evil grin towards Harry. </p><p>"Your going to get in soooo much trouble." He said, is face filled with glee. Loud footsteps came rumbling through the house and the skinny woman from before and a large man came running through the kitchen door. Harry backed away in fear as the man walked towards him. </p><p>"Harry Potter as long as you live in my house you will speak English! I will not allow you to speak that nonsense gibberish while you're under my roof!" He growled, as he grabbed Harry and dragged him out of the kitchen. He threw open the door that Harry and came out of this morning and threw the boy in.</p><p>"You won't be coming out of here for 3 hours, and not a single meal for you for a week! You'd better remember to speak a proper language next time." He hissed, slamming the door shut and locking it. Izaya and Shizuo were burning with anger, but Harry just sighed and lay on his bed. He closed his eyes and soon the screen disappeared. Then, his voice came out from behind them.</p><p>"Hello." He quietly said, giving them a small wave. Both men turned suddenly and took in the appearance of the boy. He was short and dangerously skinny. He had bruises on his arms, legs, and a fresh one on his face. His shirt hung off his skeletal frame and his shorts were held up by a rope.</p><p>"By the way, Mr. Heiwajima and Mr. Orihara, I'm not 6. I'm 9. I heard you say that I couldn't be more than 6, so I just wanted to clear things up." He said. Both men felt a strong pulse of rage through them, and both were vividly planning the deaths of Harry's aunt, uncle and cousin. Izaya knelt down to Harry's height and gently put a hand on his should.</p><p>"Harry, from here on out, we're gonna protect you as best we can. Okay?" He asked the small boy. Harry nodded. </p><p>"So from here on out are you guys my parents?" Harry asked.</p><p>"Uh.. if you want us to be... I guess." Izaya muttered.</p><p>"Okay, then I'm gonna need to use your guys' last names. Cuz you're my dads, so it only makes sense." Harry said with a slight smile.</p><p>"Fine but then we're changing your first name too, to something easier, like Haru." Shizuo grumbled.</p><p>"Haru Orihara-Heiwajima? I like it." Izaya said with a smile.</p><p>"Um... I kinda like the sound of Haru Heiwajima-Orihara better, sorry Mr. Orihara." Harry, no, Haru said, putting his hands up as if to block a hit, clenching his eyes shut.</p><p>"Fine, Haru Heiwajima-Orihara it is. Well, they do say save the best for last." Izaya said, not having noticed Haru preparing for a hit. Haru's eyes opened in surprise. </p><p>"You're not mad at me? You're not gonna hit me for talking back?" He questioned, his eyes wide.</p><p>"Wha-? No! Of course not! What your aunt and uncle do is wrong, and Shizu-chan and I will not be treating you like that." Izaya said, trying not to let his voice get too loud. Haru's eyes started watering and he flung himself at Izaya, wrapping his arms around him in a big hug. </p><p>"Thank you Mr. Orihara." He whimpered, squeezing the raven. Izaya gave him a sad smile and wrapped his arms around Haru.</p><p>"Call me dad. And call Shizu-chan papa, or something like that. But don't call us Mr. Orihara and Mr. Heiwajima. We're your dads now, little Haru. Remember that." He said, gently stroking Haru's back so as to calm him down. Shizuo walked over and joined the hug, making sure not to squeeze, since he didn't want to hurt his new son. And, I suppose he didn't want to hurt his new co-parent either. Because it'd be bad for Haru to witness that. Obviously. That's the only reason he didn't squeeze Izaya to death. He didn't want a traumatized kid. Because, obviously, he doesn't care for Izaya, but he does care for Haru so he can't let him lose Izaya because for some reason the kid seems to like the damned flea. That's it. No other reason at all.</p><p> </p>
