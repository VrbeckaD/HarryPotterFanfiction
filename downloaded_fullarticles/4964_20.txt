    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The man was tall, with sharp shoulders and a stern look on a face chiseled from stone. His clothes were dark, and simple in make, but obviously of the finest quality. A gray suit clung to his shape for dear life, a black dress coat covered that, and finishing the look a dark fedora perched atop his head making him seem even taller.</p>
<p>
He has dark, graying hair that peeked out from under his hat, and a high collar whispering of a high position in society. Everything about him was dull and sharp at the same time. Like a rusty knife, even if the wound didn’t look that bad, you’d still have to worry about the rust getting into your bloodstream and a slow agonizing death. His eyes were like fire. His face is twisted into a hard scowl.</p>
<p>
He had drawn his wand and was now gripping it in his right hand with white knuckles, his wand another thing that spoke of the power he held. A black diamond styled into the shape of a spear with a menacing tip headed the imposing wand. It's body was silver chromium metal, with a white river monster spine core, and ended in a large black pearl that was cut to look like the fledgings of an arrow with 3 ridges. The body had a thin rope of silver around the middle, designed to look like the white river monster core it contained. Right before the diamond on the bottom though, there were 6 tiny circular jewels, all about 4 millimeters in diameter in a straight row. Starting from the bottom is a purple musgravite, a pink taaffeite, a deep blue tanzanite, a jadeite, a pink star diamond, and at the top a red painite. All were the rarest gems of the world. White River Monster was hard to tame, but not the hardest. It chose  only the wizards that it thought would use it the best. It prefers powerful wizards, but refuses to work transfigurations. However, if it chooses to do so, it can turn on it’s master, and has no real loyalties to any one master.</p>
<p>
The girls eyes match his, filled with fire, but hers is a cold burn. Like shards of ice. She too, was all sharp edges and the very way she stood emitted power. That was where the resemblance ended. While his hair was a dull shade of gray, hers was several shades of silver. His skin was tan and leathery, hers was pale and almost iridescent with the glow of youth clinging to her skin. Her form fitting baby blue sweater paired with her black pants were of simple make. The sweater was threading in some places, and her pants were faded with wear. Her status as an orphan spelled out across her body. Her stance was relaxed and rigid all at once. Like a pacing wildcat.</p>
<p>
She twirls her wand with her fingers, and stares furiously at the man. Her wand was made of metal, like his, but not the same. Her wand is headed by colorless, clear taaffeite styled into a triangle pyramid cradled by the metal, also with a sharp tip. It's body was made of black tungsten, a stronger metal, with a thunderbird feather core, and ended in a large lightning ridge black opal. Hers was slender but designed. In the middles of the body was a simple  double twist, leaving a small space where her wand was not solid, and the rest widened at each base but tapered as it headed for the middle. At the bottom circling the black opal embedded in the metal were 3 other opals, all 5 millimeters in diameter. One was a dragon’s breath opal, another was a white opal, and the last was a green opal. Thunderbird is harder to tame than white river monster, and is more adept at casting wordless spells. It’s also largely more loyal. It was easily the most expensive thing she owned.</p>
<p>
They wage war with their eyes, and draw weapons with their bodies. On even ground, neither could break the other. In the midst of battle, the girl finally spoke.</p>
<p>
"No." Her voice wavers but does not break, her face showing her contempt for the man that stands before her. The man’s eyes flash dangerously, but he keeps his face a mask of indifference.</p>
<p>
"You are a Fortis, a strong blood line, you have no right-"</p>
<p>
The girl’s eyes widen a fraction and she, impulsive;y, thrusts her wand to point at the man, magic crackling at the tip, and in the air menacingly. Her magic presence whips at his, and he jerks in discomfort. Her Summa Aspectu, her magical force, is very strong. Stronger than most. She speaks low, her voice razor sharp, "I have every right. 11 years. 11. The last time I saw you, I was six. Even then, you had nothing to do with me,” she gulped down the bile rising in her throat, “ nothing to do with us, and now you come to me like you know me, like I owe you something! Until now, I was nothing to you, a bit of dirt under your nail that was just deep enough that you couldn't get me out.” her voice grows steadily  louder, “ Don't pretend like if you could have gotten rid of me you would not have taken the first chance you got. Oh, but now - now you’re interested in me because you sent someone to spy on me? To see if I’m as powerful as you wish me to be?  Now you see that I’m at the top of my class in every way? Because I have some kind of ‘potential’? I don’t think so. You can go and die for all I care!" The last sentence scrapes out of her mouth in shreds, meant to harm, but the man sighs as if speaking to a child who just couldn’t understand sense. He stares at her for a fraction of a second more before he continues.</p>
<p>
“Addison, I know you went through a rough time with your mom. I left because of reasons you wouldn’t understand. I loved Ivette-”</p>
<p>
“How dare you speak her name!” She roars out, and this time when her Aspectu lashes out, he slides back a few feet, as if pushed by a strong wind, and takes a step back with a pained face. He lets her seeth for a second, and recovers. After a pause he starts again.</p>
<p>
"Addison, your very name states what you are. You are my daughter. The daughter of a ruler. You cannot dishonor that." The air grew warm with his words, and the way he looks at her reveals the truth. This is her father.</p>
<p>
And she utterly despises him.</p>
<p>
"Then hear this, Adam." She says it with disdain, " I renounce my name and inheritance. I want nothing to do with you or your plans - forget me heading it! You are nothing to me, and if I never see you again, it will be too soon." She didn’t wait for him to respond; instead she sends a reducto his way, and apparates in a swirl of black smoke, the action telling of a strength the father cannot control.</p>
<p>
She reappears at her school. Ilvermorny. She races to the headmaster's office and explains that because of a dire emergency, she has to leave America. The headmaster nods his nearly ancient head, but his eyes were grave. Addison could tell he knew something was different than what she has disclosed. She left hesitantly, he had grown on her, but she knew that she had to leave. With a solemn goodbye, she apperates again.</p>
<p>
She emerges on the sidewalk of a small building in a tiny harbor town. The heated air clings heavily to her skin, however the natural coolness of her body creates a slight halo of steam around her body. The building, in all of its ancientness used to be white, but now was a yellowing, sagging thing. It’s boards were cracked, and the paint was peeling off. The front porch had 2 holes, and the stairs were barely stable at best. It was 3 stories high and housed orphans from the surrounding counties. She was one of the oldest there, a part of The Originals as the younger kids tended to call them.</p>
<p>
It’s an orphanage like every other, a prison, and it will never be home.</p>
<p>
She rushes in through the front door, and up the stairs, away from the other kids prying eyes, and whispering mouths. Like always, they wonder how she could be so strange, and how she was never very sociable. They think it’s strange how a snake seems to be her only friend. They whisper about how some rich person is apparently paying for her to go a boarding school every year, and how she comes back during the summer and holidays looking more and more ragged every time, but also somehow more intimidating.</p>
<p>
She’s almost to the top when she runs into the oldest boy. He had come into the orphanage the same day she had, unlike other stories, they did not become friends. They despise each other. He’s slightly taller than she is and has a head full of unruly brown hair. His eyes are a dull shade of pale brown, and his clothes were simple at best. Too large shirts and pants that were too small cluttered his closet. His face morphing into a snarl when he sees her.</p>
<p>
“Where’ve ya been Freak? I know ya don’tve any friends, so what crap are ya gettin inta?” He brings his face too close to hers, and she can smell the mix of liquor and tobacco on his breath.</p>
<p>
“It’s not really any of your business, is it Hayden? However, I am touched that you’re worried about me.” She ends sweetly, and revels in the way his face flips to disgust. “Move.”</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t fink I weel.” He seems to settle in his spot in the middle of the staircase. Addison sighs.</p>
<p>
“Do I need to tell Mrs.Hudison that you’ve been smoking and drinking again. It’s obviously clouded your puny brain, and addled your senses.”</p>
<p>
“Don’t spweak that crap to me, freak. That hag won’t do nuttin.” Spit flies out of his mouth and lands on the staircase, just barely missing her shoe. She breaths in and out to calm herself, and closes her eyes, before looking back up and into his eyes. She flashes her animagus eyes to him, and his face immediately slacks in fear. He pushes past her, almost sprinting down the stairs, and nearly trips down the last flight.</p>
<p>
Her victory is short lived when she remembers that she needs to move fast. She gets to her room, the last door in the hall, and taps it twice with her wand to unlock it. She always locks it with magic when she leaves, because she does not want the other kids snooping in her room. Especially when she leaves her snake there. Normal locks won’t work because almost all of the kids are experienced lock pickers, though she can’t judge. So is she. She slings the door open, and lurches into the room.</p>
<p>
Hurriedly she begins shoving her meager belongings into a gray duffel bag she got down from the closet, flicking her wand, her magic aiding in pulling the cloths from the drawers and folding them neatly into the bag. She falls gracefully to her knees and casts a revealing spell, and a small,  long wooden box appears. She fishes it out from under her bed, and opens it reverently. Her mother's wand sits, and hums slightly, sensing her. Her mother’s wand was made of tungsten, like Addison’s, but it was pure white. The top is a spear shaped pink poudretteite, and the bottom was a rounded red sunstone. The body had a single line of chocolate diamond designed to look like a vine with small green serendibite leaves that started at the bottom and ended at the top where bigger green serendibite leaves cupped the poudretteite. It had a wumpus hair core, one of the loyalest cores, it took only to a loving master, and it’s strongest capabilities were in healing. Don’t think it can’t cast powerful defensive and offensive spells though, not many have and survived unscathed. It hummed affectionately when she touched it, but Addison had never tried to use it, afraid that it would reject her. Wumpus cores were only ever truly loyal to one master. She grabs the small photo laying on top of the wand, and strokes it lovingly. A woman stands with her arms wrapped around the shoulders of a small laughing girl. The resemblance is striking, the little girl looks like a carbon copy, albeit  younger version, of the woman. Her eyes well with tears that were shed 10 years ago, but movement on her shoulder startles her out of her trance-like state. Somehow her snake, Inferno, has made his way onto her shoulder without her noticing.</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong precious one?”</p>
<p>
Long ago she had figured out her own spell that allowed her to be able to talk to Inferno. A spell of her own making, it also allowed her to talk to him as well. He was a black ball python with orange markings that made it look like fire was racing down his body.<br/>
“I’m ok Inferno. I’m just tired.”<br/>
He nuzzles Addison’s face gently, and she banishes her tears with one swipe of a hand and places the picture in the bag. She stands back up, and continues to pack. She has no more tears to shed for what was lost.<br/>
She’s almost finished when there’s a rustle outside her door that announces the arrival of the old woman who was the closest she has to a mother now. She flicks her wand again, and the clothes stop floating through the air, and drop to the floor with a soft thud. She shoves her wand in a hidden pocket in her sweater in a move that takes her only a second.<br/>
“Mrs.Hudison,” she said as the woman entered the room. The woman’s eyes were sweet, and it made Addison’s heart ache. Mrs.Hudison embraced her quickly, and patted Inferno’s head, before realizing the state of Addison’s room. The smile slides off her face, and she looks to the bed where Addison’s bag was still open.<br/>
“What’s this? I thought your boarding school didn’t start for another week at least.” She searches the girl’s face, and sees it. The hurt and desperation.<br/>
“What? What’s happened? I swear if Hayden has said something that has made you become like this, I’ll toss him out, I swear it I will! That boy-” The girl cut her off with a broken laugh.<br/>
“No. It wasn't Hayden. You know he can’t affect me this way.” She pauses and Mrs.Hudison waits patiently.<br/>
“I met my father today.” Mrs.Hudison stands frozen for a moment before she embraces Addison again, harder this time. Addison stiffens before she lets some of the tears fall, and Mrs.Hudison rubs soothing circles on her back. Letting go, the woman nods in understanding.<br/>
“I wish you every happiness, and know that I will always welcome you here.” She turns to go, but Addison’s hand shoots out to grip her thin wrist.<br/>
“I hope you know that if I had another choice, I wouldn’t do this. Please forgive me…” She trails off as she lifts her wand to Mrs.Hudison’s temple. Right before the words slip out of her mouth, the old woman turns and smiles softly.<br/>
“Obliviate.”  Silent tears fall down Addison’s face as she watches Mrs.Hudison’s eyes dull for a moment. A few seconds later her eyes clear and she looks as if she’s lost, and then ambles out of the room.<br/>
After that she does the same thing to each of the other orphans. She couldn’t miss even one. If her father ever discovered this place, none of them would survive unscathed.<br/>
“New den?” Inferno questions excitedly. He’d never really liked the kids here. They stared at his precious one strangely.<br/>
“Yes, new den.” she agreed.<br/>
The girl finishes packing, and picks up the bag. She apparates fast, and lands at an airport.<br/>
“Where you headed?” A brown haired man asks her when she gets to the counter.<br/>
“Scotland” she replies quickly. He hands her the ticket and she steps back, heading to the hanger.<br/>
To Hogwarts.</p><p>Any comments that you have would be much appreciated! Thank you~</p>
