        <strong>Prelude</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The last days of autumn made a hasty exit and Winter slipped upon Hogwarts like a wicked, frigid wraith. Hermione felt the chill of December's first morning in her very being as she descended the stone stairs to the Potions classroom.</p>
      <p>The previous month, Professor Slughorn had returned to his post as Potions Master, and Hermione was actually grateful to no longer be subject to Severus' daily presence as her classroom teacher. It was one complication taken off her shoulders, at the very least.</p>
      <p>As she walked into the Potions dungeon, the scent of fresh aconite blossoms reached Hermione's nostrils. Frowning, she wondered if they were to indeed brew Grand Wiggenweld Potion today, as Professor Slughorn had implied previously.</p>
      <p>She set her cauldron and scales down upon a desk and began organizing her other supplies. Neville Longbottom wordlessly slipped into the seat beside her, his own materials clattering rather ungracefully as he prepared to attempt Potions work far beyond his mastery.</p>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, Hermione had settled back into a quiet and comfortable friendship with Neville, particularly during lessons. Perhaps it was because they were all one another <em>truly</em> seemed to have left anymore, at least within House and Year. Seamus Finnigan seemed more interested in fraternizing with his latest female accomplice than with Neville. While Hermione had Luna (or at least the part of Luna's mind that paid attention), they did not have lessons together. So, every Potions or [Defense Against the] Dark Arts or Muggle Studies lesson, Hermione always sat beside Neville. They rarely conversed, and if they did, it was just small talk. But he was a reliable ally, she knew, and that fact required no conversation whatsoever.</p>
      <p>Today, Neville cleared his throat and softly asked, "What are you doing for the holidays, Hermione?"</p>
      <p>Her eyebrows crumpled in confusion and she turned to Neville, trying not to scoff as she asked, "Where would I go for the holidays, Neville?"</p>
      <p>"Home." He said the word simply, as though it were obvious. He shrugged and shook his head. "I know you're married now, but surely you'll want to visit with your parents over Christmas? Having not seen them since summer?"</p>
      <p>Hermione felt her eyes sear then, suddenly and without warning. She felt her mouth fall open, felt her breath catch almost painfully in her throat. She finally managed to swallow the lump there and lowered her eyes to her cauldron.</p>
      <p>"I - they - they've gone on holiday to Australia," she lied, stammering over her own untruth as her own mind raced to the horrible final time she'd seen her mother's face. She could still see the very instant that all recognition, all maternal love, left her mother's eyes. It still sent a shockwave of physical pain through her.</p>
      <p>Neville was silent in the fact of Hermione's blatant and clumsy lie. He, better than anyone in the world, understood what it meant to be an orphan with living parents. After all, his parents had both been alive his whole life, but he'd never once heard them say his name. Hermione felt shame flush through her veins at the way she was letting emotion boil up in her, since Neville had always handled his parents' debilitating torture with such grace. She did not wish to lie about her parents. Not to Neville, of all people.</p>
      <p>"They don't know me anymore," she whispered at last, still staring down at the desk. "It's for their own safety. They're gone."</p>
      <p>There was another long silence as Neville contemplated this. Then he reached wordlessly into his school bag and pulled out a small burlap pouch. He opened the pouch and very carefully extracted a few pieces of wrinkled blue wax paper, which he placed delicately upon the table in front of him. He looked down at them for a minute and then turned his face to Hermione.</p>
      <p>"These are from my mum," he told her. "She gives me a Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper every time I visit her. Gran always tells me to toss them into the bin; that they're useless. But, you see, they're all I have of her. The only thing she's ever given me… and they mean more to me than a million Galleons."</p>
      <p>Neville put all the wrappers back into his pouch, touching the wax paper as if it were breakable glass. He kept one lone wrapper out on the table. He pulled the tie of the bag shut and tucked it back into his rucksack.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it is easier to pretend they're gone. but I think that would not be the right thing to do. I really hope one day you get to see your mum and dad again, Hermione."</p>
      <p>Neville pushed the solitary Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper on the desk toward Hermione, nodding to signify that it was a gift.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, Neville." Hermione picked up the blue wrapper and stared down at it, not bothering now to fight away tears. "Thank you."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Crack!</em>
      </p>
      <p>Severus had arrived outside Malfoy Manor unannounced; this was a rare meeting that had been planned far enough in advance that no one's Dark Marks had needed triggering. Severus was thankful for that. His left arm had burned more in the past year than in his entire previous life.</p>
      <p>But he was early, having left Hogwarts immediately after dinner in the Great Hall was finished. He'd headed straight out to the Apparition Point and had arrived fifteen minutes prior to the call time. He was usually one of the last ones to file into a meeting or Summoning, so his prompt arrival was a rare occasion indeed.</p>
      <p>The house was seemingly empty when Severus walked through the front door, which was slightly ajar. It was also very cold. Couldn't anyone around here at least be bothered to cast Warming Charms or light fires in the myriad ornate fireplaces? Severus shivered a bit, quite against his will, as he climbed the stone stairs to the normal meeting space. But he paused near the top when he heard the sibilant voice of the Dark Lord mingling with the murmur of Bellatrix Lestrange.</p>
      <p>He strained to listen, casting a silent <em>Amplio Audito</em>. The sounds of the voices grew louder to Severus' ears, as though someone had cranked up the volume on a Muggle television.</p>
      <p>"And the cup I gave you? It is -"</p>
      <p>"Safe and sound, My Lord." Bellatrix's voice was a gentle hum, oddly soothing in tone, almost condescending. "It is in my vault at Gringott's. Impenetrable."</p>
      <p>"Hmph." Voldemort scoffed a bit at Bellatrix's overconfidence. Then Severus heard him say, "bring in Aberforth. I want him here for the meeting."</p>
      <p>"My Lord, he is hardly alive -"</p>
      <p>"Do you question me, Bella?" The Dark Lord's voice was cold and hard as frozen iron then, and there was a beat of weighty silence.</p>
      <p>"No, My Lord. Never," Bellatrix breathed. "I shall go and fetch him."</p>
      <p>Severus briskly released himself from the amplification charm and held back, pretending he was just climbing the stairs when he saw Bellatrix's shadow rounding the corner.</p>
      <p>"Oh," she acknowledged him coldly, sticking her chin upward in a haughty little gesture. "Hello, Snape. Good thing you're here early. He'd wanted to speak with you, I think."</p>
      <p>An ugly sneer caused her lip to curl up, revealing her teeth, which had rotted after years in Azkaban. Severus nodded indifferently at Bellatrix and continued up the stairs past her. He reached the top landing and squared his jaw, throwing up every mental block he had in case his mind was invaded tonight.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Dark, expansive skies. Bottomless lakes with glassy surfaces. Clouds and shadows and doors that lead nowhere.</em>
      </p>
      <p>When he felt his mind was sufficiently barricaded, Severus cleared his throat delicately and stepped into the dining room. Voldemort, as usual, was seated in the place of honor at the head of the table.</p>
      <p>"Severus," he said in a low hiss, flashing Severus an eerie smile. He gestured toward one of the chairs with a majestic sweep of his bony grey arm and said, "Please, sit and talk with me."</p>
      <p>"My Lord." As Severus pulled out the chair and sat, his consciousness wandered to what he had overheard. A cup, given from Voldemort to Bellatrix… seemingly for safekeeping, since she was keeping it at Gringotts. Why a cup? Why Bellatrix?</p>
      <p>Well, Bellatrix because she was more loyal than anyone currently in Voldemort's retinue. She'd never once denied Voldemort, not even when it seemed an undeniable truth that the Dark Lord had fallen. Bellatrix had been his most devoted servant from the start. And Voldemort himself had told Severus that she loved him in a way none of the rest of them did.</p>
      <p>Why a cup? An object that sounded so simple, and yet seemed to need protection that Bellatrix called "impregnable"?</p>
      <p>It was a Horcrux, Severus thought with a fizzle of alarm. That was why. Whatever exactly this cup was, it was being kept in Bellatrix's Gringotts vault for safekeeping because it was a precious Horcrux.</p>
      <p>And, undoubtedly, the Dark Lord was panicking a bit of late. He'd <em>nearly</em> caught Harry Potter, nearly lured the Boy Who Lived into a trap, but had been defeated by House Elf magic. In the weeks since, no one had been able to track Potter and Ginny Weasley down - not the infamous Snatchers, and not the general populace who had been informed that handing Harry Potter over would make them very rich.</p>
      <p>"Severus, I've not yet received any happy news of an impending birth," Voldemort said without any further pretense, his terrible voice a smooth grating sound in the otherwise silent room. Severus felt his dark eyes go wide and he feigned ignorance as he said,</p>
      <p>"Erm - no, My Lord. Indeed not. My wife has not yet conceived."</p>
      <p>"You are making a valiant effort, I'm sure," Voldemort pronounced smoothly, rolling his pale serpentine eyes. Then, without waiting for an answer, he continued, "Nonetheless, the issue at hand is that you have been married to the girl for two months and the only public image you've accomplished is that of the Headmaster wedding and bedding a student. Is there something wrong with her?"</p>
      <p>Severus was silent for a brief moment, considering his words, and then he said carefully, "I believe it is very common, My Lord, for it to take quite a while for a pregnancy to occur… even in a healthy union such as mine. I would not be concerned for her health for a good many months yet -"</p>
      <p>"You do not have the luxury of time in this matter, Severus." Voldemort's thin lips curled up a little when he saw his beloved snake Nagini (<em>another damned Horcrux</em>, Severus thought angrily) slinked up onto the table and curled up before him. She bobbed her head up as if asking him to pet her, and Voldemort acquiesced by coursing his skeletal fingers over the snake's head. Sounding bored, he prompted Severus, "There are spells and potions for issues such as this. I suggest you brew a batch of Ferax Elixir and dose the girl and yourself with it immediately. Also cast <em>fecunditatem</em> upon the girl's belly and yourself before each instance of the marital act. Test her in a few weeks. If these measures prove ineffective, then I believe she will have proven herself utterly useless, and we will find you a more fertile womb. A quick and visible pregnancy is essential for the public campaign of half-blood marriages."</p>
      <p>Severus felt a shock of horror flush through him as he quickly tried to think through his options. Could they falsify a pregnancy? How? He could not bring himself to dose Hermione with the antidote of the contraceptive potion she'd taken, and then just as swiftly put a child inside of her. Not in this world. Not now.</p>
      <p>But instead of voicing the objections screaming and rattling about in his brain, Severus merely nodded and flashed a little smirk toward the Dark Lord. "I shall begin brewing the Ferax Elixir as soon as possible, My Lord."</p>

    <p></p>
    <div>
      <p>Severus pulled out the chair at his desk and sat down heavily, letting out a bit of weary sigh. He'd spent a long while looking for the book he lay upon the desk before him, and had finally located it among his personally bookshelves with a Summoning Charm. He had decided to read through it in his old office in the dungeons - he did not want even the portraits of the dead to peek over his shoulder as he pored through the contents of this tome. He warded up the door of his office and examined the cover.</p>
      <p><em>Darkest Deceptions And Magical Forgeries</em> by Megaera Brummagem.</p>
      <p>It was a worn and beaten text from the late 19th century, published by a Dark witch infamous for having spent her life deceiving seventeen men into successive marriages before murdering them and taking their wealth for her own. Megaera Brummagem was best known for changing her appearance and taking on pseudonyms, hunting down unsuspecting wealthy Muggles and wizards and beguiling them just long enough to weasel her way onto the will. Then a carefully staged illness or accident would leave her wealthy, and she would disappear again.</p>
      <p><em>Darkest Deceptions and Magical Forgeries</em> was only in print for six weeks before the Ministry of Magic banned it and burned every copy it could seize, claiming the terrible spells and potions recipes inside would encourage similar antisocial behavior. Severus had obtained this copy, the only one he knew to exist, decades previously from Othello Copperfield, the same book specialist who had tracked down <em>Ende Of Deth</em> for him.</p>
      <p>Severus opened the thick book and drew his finger down the table of contents, pausing when he saw the words <em>On Gravidity And Child-Bearing - Page 193.</em></p>
      <p>He carefully turned the text until he reached the worn, yellow page as directed, and he scanned his black eyes over the unevenly printed text there.</p>
      <p>'<em>At times, a witch (or her accompanying wizard) might find it of benefit to falsify a gestation. The author of this tome judges not those for whom this circumstance presents itself - the world has long demonstrated that a woman's purpose upon this Earth is ostensibly procreative in nature. There are times, however, when the illusion of pregnancy is far more beneficial than the actual production of a child.</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>To this end, Madam Brummagem is pleased to put forth several options.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>First, there is the quick and abrupt illusion of an early abortive miscarriage. This scenario may prove itself useful in an unhappy marriage. It allows a witch to show she is fertile and has 'conceived,' and, yet, does not require the follow-through of a long, arduous pregnancy, a delivery, or of a birthed child.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In order to achieve this illusion, a witch (or her accompanying wizard) may cast the incantation 'Praeceps Cruentamque.' The incantation should be cast upon the lower abdominal region, over the womb, thrice. Make a circular motion with the tip of the wand.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The result of the incantation will be near-immediate feminine bleeding, cramping, and vomiting that will last for several hours to two days. This should achieve the illusion of a naturally terminated pregnancy.'</em>
      </p>
      <p>Severus paused and sighed deeply. He considered whether or not this spell would be a viable solution for himself and Hermione. No, he realized. It wouldn't. They'd have to do it over and over again, and even then the Dark Lord would eventually simply say that Hermione was unable to carry a pregnancy 'properly' and would cast her aside, putting someone else in her place. Severus frowned and continued reading.</p>
      <p>'<em>The second and more radical option is a potion which can be brewed to give the illusion of a developing pregnancy. This potion is called the Graviditate Elixir, and the admittedly complicated instructions may be found upon the following page.</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>Madam Brummagem advises that this potion only be utilized by a witch who finds herself under most severe pressure to present the public illusion of pregnancy, but who has absolutely no desire or ability to birth or parent a child.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Graviditate Elixir works rather like Polyjuice Potion insofar as it must be taken continuously (once daily) or its effects will immediately wear off. If the Graviditate Elixir is dosed once daily, the witch will bear visible signs of pregnancy - a growing belly, mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, and other outward manifestations that she bears a child within her womb. However, there will in fact be nothing growing inside her; it shall be a false pregnancy. If at any moment the witch desires to cease and desist the deception, she need only stop taking the Graviditate Elixir, and within several days, her body shall return to its original form. Otherwise, she shall appear to carry to full-term.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The obvious conundrum is what to do at the end of a gestational term. No witch has ever used the Graviditate Elixir for a full nine months' worth of deception. The author of this text can not advise to do so, for it is unknown what might pass after that time. It is only known that there is no child growing in the womb, and therefore the social consequences for the deceiving witch and any participating allies would undoubtedly be quite grave.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would be strongly advised to only use the Graviditate Elixir for a few months, then combine with the 'Praeceps Cruentamque' incantation to simulate a miscarriage.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And, as always, Madam Brummagem reminds her readers that these deceptions are cruel and Dark, and none should be attempted in the first place.'</em>
      </p>
      <p>Severus flicked his eyes to the following page, reading over the instructions for the potion. When he realized that it would take a solid week to brew, he decided to get to work at once. If Hermione decided against it, he would simply Vanish the work he'd already done, but time was precious to them now.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The first snowfall was delicate and light, the snowflakes looking like tiny pieces of lace as they cascaded down from the heavens. Hermione stood near an arched opening in the cloisters and stared down into the glen below, watching the snowflakes tumble and whirl through sky in their graceful ballet. She breathed the cold, sharp air through her nostrils and relished the cutting bite of winter.</p>
      <p>"Hello, Hermione."</p>
      <p>She turned to see Luna Lovegood beside her, the girl's blonde tresses blowing smoothly behind her in the breeze. Luna flashed her serene little smile.</p>
      <p>"Hi, Luna." Hermione curled up her lips, grateful for the friendly presence of a peer, and asked, "How are you doing?"</p>
      <p>Luna ignored the pleasantry and prompted softly, "Have you seen this morning's edition of the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, Hermione?"</p>
      <p>There was a note of concern then in Luna's voice, and she spoke so softly that she was almost whispering. Hermione turned to face her more squarely and frowned. Ever since Voldemort's followers had taken over the Ministry of Magic, the <em>Prophet</em> had existed solely as a tool for Death Eater propaganda. Hermione had only ever seen Luna reading her father's paper, <em>The Quibbler</em>, so if she was asking Hermione about the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, it must be important. Hermione shook her head and asked, "What's wrong, Luna?"</p>
      <p>Luna kept up her preternaturally calm smile, though her eyes went a bit bleak, and she reached inside her school bag for a folded copy of the newspaper. She handed it to Hermione carefully, and Hermione unfurled it and immediately gasped when she read the headline.</p>
      <p>HOGWARTS BABY WATCH!</p>
      <p>Beneath the loud and obnoxious print were two moving photographs - one of Severus, taken a few years previously, and one of Hermione taken with Harry (they'd conveniently cropped Harry out of the photo). The <em>Prophet</em>editors had placed the two separate photographs side-by-side since they had no photo of Hermione and Severus together. The smaller sub-headline read,</p>
      <p>'<em>Wizarding World awaits pregnancy news from hunky Hogwarts headmaster and his youthful wife!'</em></p>
      <p>Feeling abruptly nauseated from her abject humiliation, Hermione read on with a great deal of horror. Unsurprisingly, the byline indicated the article was by Rita Skeeter.</p>
      <p>'<em>Unconventionally handsome Hogwarts Headmaster Severus Snape has recently married the young and beautiful Hermione Granger. This May-December marriage, while perhaps unexpected and idiosyncratic, does also seem quite romantic to this reporter! But it's not the dress Miss Granger wore while wedding Master Snape that has the tongues of the Wizarding World wagging - it's when she's going to announce her pregnancy!</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, the eyes and ears of Wizarding Britain are upon Hogwarts Castle, waiting for word that the Snapes have done their duty in increasing the Two Magical Parent Population. The Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet would like to extend their most heartfelt congratulations to the married couple and wish them the best of luck in being a shining example of the Two Magical Parent Population Act!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This reporter can assure her readers that she waits with bated breath for news of a Hogwarts Baby!'</em>
      </p>
      <p>Hermione felt her jaw drop open and her eyebrows fly up as she read the shameful article. She felt her stomach flop and then plummet, and she wanted to be sick. She crumpled the newspaper in her fist, shaking her head fiercely.</p>
      <p>"How… that terrible woman!" she hissed at Luna, feeling her eyes burn. "'Hogwarts baby'? I'm not a damned broodmare! I'm a human!"</p>
      <p>"I know, Hermione!" Luna assured her, putting her hand gently on Hermione's shoulder and nodding. "And your husband knows that, too. I'm quite certain Professor Snape did not marry you in order to make Rita Skeeter happy."</p>
      <p>Hermione shook her head no. Luna sighed and continued in a low murmur,</p>
      <p>"Even so, it might be best… it might be the most <em>safe</em> thing to do, don't you think… to give them what they want? Bread and circuses and all of that?" She smiled and shrugged.</p>
      <p>"So, I'm meant to conceive and birth and raise a child, just to assuage the lust of the public - more specifically, of Rita Skeeter?" Hermione sneered, and Luna patiently shook her head.</p>
      <p>"No! Of course not. You're supposed to conceive and birth and raise a child because you married man you love, and you will be a wonderful mother. The fact that a pregnancy will save all of your lives is just an added bonus - the true gift is being a family."</p>
      <p>She patted Hermione's shoulder and stepped away, smiling gently over her shoulder. As Hermione watched her go, she trembled with confusion, and knew she needed to find Severus immediately.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>She appeared a few feet away from him with a small <em>pop</em>, holding his pocket-watch in her hand, and Severus looked up from the bubbling cauldron over which he stood to see her tucking the <em>Oraverit</em> back into her robes.</p>
      <p>"Hello," he greeted her softly, his hand continuing to carefully stir the potion. He had made a small work station in his dungeon office, and, having assembled all the necessary ingredients, had begun work on the Graviditate Elixir<em>.</em></p>
      <p>He had removed his black frock coat and tossed it over the back of his desk chair and stood in his white dress shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and the top few buttons undone, and he'd pulled his hair back into a small tie so none fell into the cauldron. He wanted to ensure everything was just so with this potion, and he worked best under these conditions. Hermione stared at him for a long beat, unused to seeing him dressed like this, and he pinched his lips tightly at her, his hand still moving his stirring-stick in a fluid circle.</p>
      <p>"When you've quite finished ogling, Ms. Granger, would you care to inform me why you've Apparated into my office when I happen to know you're meant to be in Advanced Arithmancy lessons?"</p>
      <p>"Erm…" Hermione lowered her eyes and blinked a few times. Finally she said, "Did you see this morning's <em>Prophet</em>?"</p>
      <p>Severus scowled. He made a habit of avoiding the newspaper of late; it was frequently filled with either hateful bile or ridiculous drivel. "No," he said shortly. "I did not. Why?" He looked down and watched as the potion turned bright blue, and he tossed in some chopped rose petals and stirred more vigorously before letting the mixture sit. Setting down the stirring stick, he glanced up at Hermione and cocked an eyebrow, folding his arms over his chest.</p>
      <p>Hermione pulled a crumpled copy of the <em>Daily Prophet </em>from her robes and held it out to Severus gingerly. He smoothed it on the table and read, '<em>HOGWARTS BABY WATCH!'</em></p>
      <p>There was a lurid article following the terrible headline, and Severus felt a flutter of awful anxiety rush through him. Obviously, he thought, the Dark Lord had indirectly instructed someone at the <em>Prophet</em> to run this story.</p>
      <p>It wasn't just that he and Hermione were to be shining beacons of Half-Blood procreation, Severus realized. This was the Dark Lord's way of discerning whether or not he could truly trust Severus - whether Severus followed orders. The article was a clear way of showing Severus that the Dark Lord was not fooling around about the issue. Either he and Hermione produce a visible, public pregnancy, or their marriage would be outed as a sham and a deception, and Severus' credibility would be destroyed in the world of the Death Eaters. The article was also an effective means by Voldemort of humiliation, one of his favorite tactics of exerting power over his followers.</p>
      <p>Severus swallowed heavily and cleared his throat. He had not discussed with Hermione what Voldemort had said to him at the last meeting, because he'd not had time over the past two days to come up with an adequate solution. Only in the past few hours had he discovered the potion as an option in <em>Darkest Deceptions And Magical Forgeries,</em> and Hermione had been in lessons all day. He'd meant to discuss it this evening after dinner, of course.</p>
      <p>"Well," he said delicately, folding up the newspaper and Vanishing it with neither wand nor incantation, "this issue is actually why I'm standing over a cauldron instead of working up in the Headmaster's Tower today, Hermione."</p>
      <p>"Oh?" Hermione shifted her weight and pinched her lips. Her voice was rather sour, and Severus could scarcely blame her. She probably felt as though her worth were being measured by many people in her ability to either be or appear pregnant. It was unjust and ridiculous for such a young woman to feel that way, Severus thought bitterly.</p>
      <p>"Indeed," he said, his voice smooth. He jerked his head a bit toward the cauldron and said, "This potion is called Graviditate Elixir. It is taken daily to simulate pregnancy - you would have outward, visible manifestations of a pregnancy. But, of course, you would not actually be pregnant. It would be a false pregnancy."</p>
      <p>"And what about at the end of nine months, with nothing to show for it?" Hermione asked skeptically.</p>
      <p>Severus frowned and licked his lips carefully. "Yes, well… the author of the book stated that there was some risk about that. No one has ever taken it for a full nine months… one would seek to cease use before then -"</p>
      <p>"What if one could not?" Hermione cocked her eyebrows up. "What if a certain Dark wizard demanded proof of a miscarriage? I appreciate your research and work, Severus. Really, I do. But I don't think you've thought this all the way through. This level of deception could get us both killed. I have a distended belly, a swollen face, et cetera… and nothing at <em>all</em> to show for it at the end of nine months? You don't suspect that that degree of ongoing deception, if discovered, would result in hideous torture of murder of both you and me?"</p>
      <p>She was right, of course. She was so right it hurt Severus' chest to think about it. He glared down at the cauldron of partially-brewed potion and dragged his teeth over his bottom lip. "I do not have a better solution," he admitted quietly. "I have pondered it for two days and searched through several books…"</p>
      <p>Hermione stepped up to stand in front of him, and she reached her hand up to touch his cheek with shaking fingertips. "Don't you think, after all that reading," she began, "that the only real option is to actually <em>try</em>?"</p>
      <p>Severus shook his head firmly. "I will not do that to you."</p>
      <p>"So you would instead have me engage in an ongoing lie so deep and duplicitous that I would be killed for it?" Hermione asked. She nodded and raised her eyebrows. "They would kill me if they found out. You know they would."</p>
      <p>Severus shook his head, shutting his eyes against the reality facing him. "You are too young for this. You have a life to live," he insisted, but Hermione interrupted him.</p>
      <p>"Are we existing in the same world at present, you and I?" she demanded. "What sort of life am I meant to live? You are my life." She raised herself up onto her toes and pressed her lips gently against his. "Please give me the antidote to the <em>Elixir Infecundum. </em>You said you had it."</p>
      <p>Severus squared his jaw and gritted his teeth. Yes, he possessed a bottle of the antidote to the contraceptive - the only bottle he knew to exist. Its effects would be immediate. He could give it to her, take her through to door to their private chambers, and start 'trying' straight away.</p>
      <p>But what sort of a scoundrel would he have to be to do that? She was still in school. She'd not even taken her N.E.W.T.s yet. She'd not had a chance to travel the world, to have a professional life, to be her own adult person without the burden of motherhood. How could he shackle her with a child - deliberately?</p>
      <p>Then again, what if she was right? What if this was the only way to keep them alive and together? Voldemort had vowed that if Severus failed to produce evidence of Hermione's pregnancy, she would be cast aside and quickly replaced. The <em>Daily Prophet</em> was deliberately stirring up public interest in their private lives, and Hermione was almost certainly correct that the deceptive potion would have a terrible outcome. Severus' mind swirled with a vision of a fruitless lie ending in torture and death when discovered.</p>
      <p>Could he be a father? He did not <em>want</em> to be a father - at least, not under the present circumstances. Where on Earth would an infant live at Hogwarts, anyway? He'd have to put Hermione and a child up in a house in Hogsmeade, at the very least. And the thought of a wailing, then crawling, then complaining child made his hair stand on end unpleasantly. There may well be positive aspects to fatherhood, but Severus had never personally been on the receiving end of any of them, so they were difficult to imagine.</p>
      <p>No, he did not particularly desire parenthood. Not currently. But it seemed there was little choice but to at least <em>try</em>… if for no other reason than to keep Hermione alive and with him. He felt ill as he picked his wand up off the desk and pointed it at his private stores.</p>
      <p>"<em>Accio</em> <em>Elixir Infecundum</em> Antidote."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>He'd given her the antidote and told her to go back to lessons, that it would look poorly upon the both of them for her to have disappeared in the middle of the day. The antidote did not make Hermione feel any differently, but she was left with the mingled taste of chalk and sugar and chili pepper in her mouth for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>At dinner, there were a fair number of eyes trained upon her as students engaged in amused conversations with one another about that morning's <em>Daily Prophet.</em> Hermione sat red-faced for the entire meal and tried to ignore all of them, until finally a small gaggle of Slytherin girls came striding up to the Gryffindor table.</p>
      <p>"Hello, Granger," sneered Pansy Parkinson, crossing her arms over her chest and flicking her bobbed hair from her face. She cocked her face to the side and smirked. "Any news for us? We're all waiting with <em>bated breath</em>, you know."</p>
      <p>"Are you?" Hermione asked distantly, flicking through the Herbology book passage she was reading about the use of sea kelp in healing pastes.</p>
      <p>"I've heard that the Headmaster only married you in order to demonstrate the Two Magical Parent Population Act," said Daphne Greengrass snidely, from where she stood behind Pansy and Millicent Bulstrode, and Hermione snapped her eyes up with a sharp glare. Daphne continued, "I heard that bit… isn't going well."</p>
      <p>"Well, Daphne, I've <em>no</em> idea who would have told you that," Hermione said, feeling her cheeks grow warm. "I suggest you shove -"</p>
      <p>She was about to snap a very rude remark to all of the Slytherin girls, but then she heard the liquid voice of her husband say,</p>
      <p>"I must admit, I never thought I'd see this group socializing. An unlikely cohort."</p>
      <p>Hermione snapped her head around to see Severus gliding smoothly down the row between the tables, having come down from the Staff Table when he sensed trouble. Pansy Parkinson lowered her arms from her chest and stammered,</p>
      <p>"We… we were just congratulating, erm… asking…"</p>
      <p>"I believe the House-Elves have just served dessert," Severus noted, raising his eyebrows, "if you ladies will find your way back to the Slytherin table."</p>
      <p>"Yes, Headmaster," Daphne nodded briskly, and the girls turned on their heels and strode quickly away from Hermione.</p>
      <p>"I can stand up for myself," Hermione hissed under her breath at him when they'd gone, looking down at her book.</p>
      <p>"Of course you can," he affirmed quietly. "That doesn't mean I don't enjoy seeing them flee in terror."</p>
      <p>Hermione chuckled a little then, unable to help herself. She flicked her eyes to the side and watched as Severus made his way back up to the Staff Table, his black robe billowing authoritatively behind him.</p>
      <p>A half hour later, she made her way to the library to retrieve a stack of books she needed for an Astronomy essay, and then she finally retired to the dungeons for the night. She was weary and sick of ignoring whispers and stares. Feeling rather like a zoo animal, she was relieved when she finally entered the deserted Potions corridor and was free of the eyes and voices of the rest of the castle.</p>
      <p>When she opened the door to the rooms she shared with Severus, she could hear the soft plinking of piano music coming from his old record player.</p>
      <p>"Evening," she greeted him, closing the door softly behind her. He was already in for the night, sitting in a wingback chair in his dark green cotton robe. It bared much of his chest, and Hermione had to cast away a flutter of want in her throat at the sight of his skin in the flickering firelight. He had a half-empty glass of Elf-made wine in his hand, and was staring into the fireplace. When she came in, he flicked his black eyes over to her and smiled a bit sadly.</p>
      <p>"Are you feeling all right?" he asked as she stepped into the room, and she knew he was referring to the contraceptive antidote she'd taken earlier. She nodded as she stripped off her school robes and jumper and kicked off her shoes and knee-high socks.</p>
      <p>"No side effects," she confirmed, and Severus nodded his approval. He took a sip of his wine thoughtfully. Hermione felt a little unnerved at the quiet, contemplative mood he seemed to be in. He was peaceful and collected, almost as though he'd taken a - "Calming draught," Hermione intoned under her breath, raising an eyebrow questioningly at Severus. He smirked and nodded.</p>
      <p>"I was quite anxious, I admit," he said, taking another little sip of wine. "I am both intimidated and discouraged by the idea of actively attempting procreation. I thought perhaps a Calming draught might at least ease the process. There's some for you, should you require it."</p>
      <p>He gestured loosely to the little table beside him, where there was another glass of wine and a small clear vial. Hermione frowned deeply.</p>
      <p>"You don't have to ply me with alcohol and sedative potions in order to bed me, Severus," she insisted, unbuttoning her white blouse nimbly as she padded barefoot toward him. "You're my husband. I'm your wife. This is what is supposed to happen."</p>
      <p>"Hmph," Severus said gruffly, draining the last of his wine. He set down his empty glass upon the little table and put his slender hands on the arms of the chair, narrowing his dark eyes at Hermione. "Why don't you come show me <em>precisely </em>what is supposed to happen?"</p>
      <p>Hermione smirked a little, undoing the final button of her shirt as she stood before the chair. She peeled the shirt from her torso and tossed it aside, and then moved her hands to her waist, flicking open the clasp on her skirt and letting it fall to the floor before kicking it away. She stood before Severus in her bra and knickers and dragged her fingertips lightly around her form - down her neck, over her breasts and stomach and hips, under the waistband of her knickers. She pulled them down and then unclasped her bra, revealing her milky flesh to him.</p>
      <p>Suddenly Severus' hands reached up from the arms of the chair and he growled from the back of his throat. He grabbed roughly onto Hermione's waist and yanked her down so that she was straddling him, one thigh on each side of him. He pulled her down and ground her against him, and she felt his hardness beneath her and moaned helplessly.</p>
      <p>"What is supposed to happen, little wife?" Severus demanded, his onyx eyes piercing hers as his bulge pushed over and over against her increasingly drenched entrance. Hermione closed her eyes and listened to how his breath came hard and fast through his nostrils, felt how his hands held her waist with a powerful grip, and she shuddered. Her own hands reached down between them and pulled desperately at his boxer-briefs, freeing his stiff cock.</p>
      <p>She shifted her hips, up and forward, until she felt his tip press against her. She hissed as she sank onto him, and she buried her face into the crook of his neck.</p>
      <p>She rocked against him, and it felt <em>good; </em>it felt right. The fluid movement of shared magic between them, the link forged by their vow of <em>Magnum Verbum Honoris</em>, was particularly palpable tonight. She felt every fleck of pleasure he felt, deep in her marrow. When she came, it was with a juddering sort of tremor in her very core, and it seemed to go on for a very long while. She sighed Severus' name against his shoulder and kissed his neck as she recovered, and then she felt him grow and stiffen inside of her. She felt his hands course up and down her ribcage and then tighten on her waist.</p>
      <p>And then, very abruptly, she felt one of his hands fly to her front, to the spot just below her belly button.</p>
      <p>"<em>Breviter steralitatem,</em>" she heard Severus mumble frantically, and Hermione pulled back to stare at him in wide-eyed shock and horror. She felt a terrible mix of betrayal and pleasure wash over her as he wrenched his eyes shut and filled her in his climax. The pleasure was his, and the betrayal was hers. The conflicting emotions mixed to make Hermione feel profoundly confused, and as his seed leaked out of her, she felt dirty.</p>
      <p>She climbed quickly off of him and recoiled away from the chair, pulling one of her hands up unconsciously to cover her breasts. Severus still had his eyes shut where he sat upon the chair, looking rather pathetic with his softening member, wet from both of them and glistening in the firelight, his hair a tousled mess, his chest heaving.</p>
      <p>"Why did you do that?" Hermione demanded, her voice cracking with shame and anger. "Why did you cast the sterility charm? We agreed… <em>you</em> agreed that we would try!"</p>
      <p>"I can't, Hermione." Severus shook his head resolutely. "It isn't the right thing for you, or for me, or for any child that would come of it."</p>
      <p>Hermione felt her cheeks flush with fury, and she reached in her crumpled school robe for her wand. She pointed it at herself and exclaimed in a shaking voice, "<em>Finite incantatem!"</em></p>
      <p>She watched as Severus sighed, shook his head, and said patiently, "It doesn't work like that. I'm sorry, Hermione."</p>
      <p>She growled, filled with rage she couldn't explain, and she turned on her heel to go into the bathroom. She suddenly wanted nothing more than to wash the feel and smell of his seed completely from her body.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Severus stood in front of the armchair before the fire and cinched his dark grey dressing-gown around his waist. He sank into the chair and tapped his fingertips nervously on the small glass bottle in his hand. Staring into the crackling flames, he listened to the shower running in the bathroom and wondered how long Hermione had been in there. A half hour, at least. Probably longer.</p>
      <p>She must hate him now, he thought. She must hate him because he'd hastily cast a Sterility Charm upon her just before spilling himself inside of her. But what she did not realize was that he'd been absolutely terrified in the moment that his body had readied for climax. An awful thought had flown through his mind, a horrific vision: Hermione with a round belly, waddling through the Hogwarts corridors in student robes, everyone staring at her. It wouldn't matter whether there was a child in her womb or not. She deserved to enter and live young adulthood without the heavy cloak of motherhood upon her, and if that wasn't possible, then both she and he deserved to fight to the end. But it was in <em>no one</em>'s best interest, Severus thought, for that vision to come to fruition.</p>
      <p>He stared down at the bottle in his hand and dragged the pad of his thumb over the cork. He squared his jaw and felt his eyes burn, wondering whether he'd made a terrible mistake in binding himself to Hermione with <em>Magnum Verbum Honoris. </em>It was hardly that he did not love her enough. No. That wasn't it. It was that he loved her far too much, and his greatest fear was dying and leaving her behind with a splintered soul.</p>
      <p>Severus now knew that Bellatrix Lestrange had a cup of some kind in her vault at Gringotts, and he strongly suspected that cup was a Horcrux. He also suspected Nagini to be one. There were probably more, and Severus knew that the Dark magic meant Voldemort could not die until all the Horcruxes were destroyed. The way Dumbledore had indicated that there was a 'strong connection' between Harry Potter and Voldemort was interesting, as well. Dumbledore had said that a piece of Voldemort was inside Potter, and that the boy would have to die in order for the Dark Lord to be defeated. Was it possible that Potter himself was a Horcrux, as well?</p>
      <p>If those three Horcruxes needed destroying, Severus thought, and he and Hermione were among the only people with knowledge of them, they were unlikely to survive. At the very least, he figured, <em>he</em> was unlikely to survive a mission to destroy the Horcruxes. And since he'd selfishly bound himself to Hermione, if he died, she would soon follow.</p>
      <p>The water stopped running in the shower, and there was a long silence that made Severus feel uneasy. At last there was a rather bright light as the door to the bathroom opened and Hermione emerged, her torso wrapped in a black towel and with patted-dry tendrils of hair falling in a mess around her face. She paused in the doorway of the bathroom and rested her hand against the doorjamb, sighing as she stared at Severus for a long moment.</p>
      <p>"Will you come here, please?" he asked, his voice a quiet purr, and she did. Her feet padded upon the carpet with gentle footfalls, and she stopped when she stood directly in front of the armchair. Then, rather unexpectedly, she pulled at the towel until it fell from her body at revealed her naked form. It wasn't a sexual gesture; it was intimate. She moved to nestle her nude body atop him, curling onto his lap and lacing her arms around his neck.</p>
      <p>Severus tensed a little, surprised by the way she'd silently meshed her naked body onto his. He felt a warmth pulsing through his veins - <em>love</em>, at its most private and visceral - and he could not tell if the feeling originated from her or him. He swallowed a lump in his throat and coughed delicately, wrapping his arms around her back and feeling the way her skin was still sticky and warm from the shower.</p>
      <p>"Do you <em>want</em> a child?" he asked Hermione, and there was a frankness in his own voice that he hoped she could hear. "Can you see yourself, any time in the near future, wanting to conceive and carry, to birth and raise, a child, Hermione?"</p>
      <p>She did not answer him for a very long moment, but he didn't repeat the question. Hermione's fingers played a little with the dusting of hair upon Severus' chest, and she finally hummed a small sigh against his collarbone.</p>
      <p>"No," she murmured at last, and Severus felt a flood of relief wash over him. But then Hermione began to shake with sudden tears, and he pulled her more tightly against him. She was shaking her head onto him, her wet hair rubbing oddly at the day-old scruff on his chin. "No," she said again, over and over. "I know there's no good option, no good way around this mess, but… I am nowhere near ready…"</p>
      <p>"Hermione," Severus said then, and he heard a sharp clip in his voice that he quickly tried to correct, "The Dark Lord has no possession over your body, and neither do I. You must decide… if you want this."</p>
      <p>He pulled her back away from him a little and held up the bottle in his right hand to her. She frowned deeply when she read the label.</p>
      <p>"<em>Elixir Infecundum</em>?" she asked incredulously. She took the bottle and chewed her lip. "You said you had no more antidote. That it takes five years to brew."</p>
      <p>"That is so," Severus nodded, pinching his lips. "But you will still be young in five years' time, Hermione. If all of this is over, and we are still alive, then perhaps at that time it will be safe for you to be a mother. I don't think it is now. I think it best that you are safe…"</p>
      <p>He expected her to put up more of an argument. He expected her to bicker with him about the permanency of the potion, about how he had no antidote in case they should get fickle again and change their minds once more before five years were up. He expected her to rail on about how he'd gone against their joint decision and had cast a Sterility Charm upon her without asking.</p>
      <p>He was thoroughly unprepared to see her pluck out the little cork and tip the bottle back into her mouth.</p>
      <p>He was even less prepared for the next moment, when his left arm started burning with a searing, uncomfortable heat. Hermione looked down at her own arm in alarm, for she could feel some of Severus' pain. She brushed her fingertips over her own forearm, over the phantom Dark Mark that was paining her there, and she raised her chestnut eyes to Severus. She dropped the empty bottle of <em>Elixir Infecundum</em> and put her hands upon each of his cheeks.</p>
      <p>"Please come back to me quickly," she said softly. "I do not like to sleep without you."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The front door of Malfoy Manor was already opening as Severus approached it. In the threshold stood Bellatrix Lestrange, looking ornery and troubled, and Severus felt ill at the sight of her.</p>
      <p>"Hurry up, hurry up!" Bellatrix huffed, and Severus frowned, for he'd come straight away upon feeling the burn on his arm. "They're upstairs."</p>
      <p>"Is it worth my time to inquire of you <em>who</em> is upstairs, Bella, or shall I simply make haste to see for myself?" Severus drawled. Bellatrix did not give him a snippy response as she was wont to do. The way she simply shut the door behind Severus and started up the stone stairs made him feel abruptly uneasy.</p>
      <p>He stalked into the dining room and threw up his mental defenses, just as he did every time he came here. When he entered the dining room, Aberforth Dumbledore was at the table, his head resting upon his hands as though he were in a drunken stupor. The old wizard's white-and-grey hair and beard looked dirty and ragged, as if he'd been too long deprived a bath. Severus had obviously heard from Hogsmeade that the proprietor of the Hog's Head had vanished, though no one was willing to speak aloud their suspicions of where Aberforth Dumbledore had gone.</p>
      <p>Voldemort was standing up beside the fireplace, and Nagini was curled at his feet. Severus quickly realized that this was to be a fairly private meeting when the Dark Lord said in a low his, "Leave us, Bellatrix."</p>
      <p>Bellatrix nodded but looked reluctant as she shut the dining room door behind herself. Severus felt a silent shudder in the space as it was warded by the Dark Lord, and it suddenly seemed as though the walls were closing in a bit.</p>
      <p>Aberforth Dumbledore looked up from the table toward Severus, who squared his jaw and gave the old man an icy glare. Aberforth chuckled, low and under his breath, and whispered dryly, "You're the one I kicked out all those years ago… when you heard the Prophecy. You only heard part. Too bad. I should have let you stay for the whole thing, I suppose."</p>
      <p>"We have been interrogating him for weeks," Voldemort said in a slick murmur to Severus, "but the only information I can get on Potter are little flashes… reflections in a broken mirror. We have had the Hog's Head searched. We have searched <em>him</em>. There is no broken mirror. Something with a Protean Charm? I'd assume the boy has the other piece. I saw the House-Elf in his head. He is the one who sent the Elf here to fetch Ginevra Weasley."</p>
      <p>"If he serves no further purpose, My Lord," Severus began carefully, "May I ask why it is you are keeping him alive?"</p>
      <p>Voldemort looked a bit uncomfortable as he admitted, "Yours are the only other Legilimency skills I trust, Severus. Before I kill him… take a look, will you? Anything useful would be… both appreciated and rewarded."</p>
      <p>"Of course, My Lord." Severus cleared his throat and prepared to enter Aberforth Dumbledore's mind. Then, rather unexpectedly, Aberforth looked straight at Severus and said,</p>
      <p>"He had you get that book - <em>Ende of Deth -</em> for the girl. I saw you carrying it out of the bookshop. I know why. It's the wand, the old wand from the story. It's true, you know; Albus had it for ages. It must be mastered -"</p>
      <p>Severus felt a shaking sort of anxiety ripple through him as Aberforth spoke. He was revealing too much; he was not saying enough. Was this about the Elder Wand from the Tale of the Three Brothers? And, if it was, <em>why</em> would Aberforth Dumbledore talk about it in front of Voldemort? Severus opened his mouth, and, in a trembling voice, said, "<em>Legilimens!"</em></p>
      <p>At precisely the same moment, he heard the hoarse, serpentine voice of the Dark Lord cry out, "<em>Legilimens!"</em></p>
      <p>An odd thing happened then, a thing that Severus would later realize was the phenomenon called <em>Conlisio Legilimens.</em> The extremely rare occurrence happened when two people practicing Legilimency entered a mind at exactly the same time. Instead of reading the mind of the intended subject, those locked in <em>Conlisio Legilimens </em>entered the minds of one another, and were likely to have difficulty pulling away.</p>
      <p>This was precisely what happened. Severus did not see Aberforth Dumbledore's thoughts. Instead, he saw a swirling collision of his own memories tangled with the horrifying thoughts of Lord Voldemort.</p>

        <em>Severus in the armchair, with Hermione rocking back and forth atop him. His hand flying to her abdomen. Whispering, 'Breviter Steralitatem.'</em>
      </p>
      <p>Severus suddenly managed to yank himself out of Voldemort's mind and thought very quickly. He knew that the Dark Lord had just spent the last frenzied minute trying to wrench himself from the Legilimency lock, as well. Severus had only a split second, he knew, to escape.</p>
      <p>The quick flash of memories had been devastating for the both of them. They were both vulnerable now. Severus had seen critical and confidential information from Voldemort's mind about Horcruxes, about the Elder Wand. And Voldemort had seen that Severus had been spying for Dumbledore, and that he had been disobedient with Hermione. His lack of loyalty had been made abundantly clear.</p>
      <p>There was a Killing Curse headed straight for him, Severus knew. He had to act <em>now</em>.</p>
      <p>So he thrust his hand down his collar and snatched at the iron pendant there. He clutched it in his fist and said, "<em>Oraverit!'</em></p>
      <p>And then he was gone.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Hermione had managed to yank a comb through her messy hair and had pulled it into a low braid down her back. She'd donned a simple white tank top and an old pair of red flannel pyjama pants, and had arranged herself under the blankets of the bed.</p>
      <p>Usually these meetings meant Severus was gone a few hours. It was already late enough tonight that Hermione thought she ought to go ahead and sleep, knowing he'd wake her up a bit when he settled into bed later. But something was niggling at her, keeping her wide awake and antsy. It was a sort of anxiety that wasn't hers. Something was wrong.</p>
      <p>He wasn't in pain. She would have felt it if he was. But just in the past two minutes or so, she'd felt a quick flush of terrible fear and unease come over her, and she knew that whatever was happening with Severus, it wasn't good.</p>
      <p>So she climbed back out of bed and paced a bit upon the floor, trying to slow the way her heart had begun pounding in her chest. His anxiety was a bit overwhelming, and now Hermione was feeling some of her own, and it melded with his. It was all becoming too much, and she quickly wondered whether she might dissolve into a panic attack.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Crack!</em>
      </p>
      <p>He startled her by appearing beside her with a louder-than-usual noise. Severus did not use his <em>Oraverit</em> as a matter of practice, and Hermione was shocked to see him Apparate straight into their living space. She put her fingers to her lips and whispered,</p>
      <p>"What's happened?"</p>
      <p>His face was white as a sheet as he wordlessly began dashing about the room. "Where is your bag - the one you Expanded? Get it. Get it now." Hermione felt her breath hitch in her chest, felt her feet frozen to the ground for a split second. Then Severus flashed his eyes back to her as he flung open the wardrobe. He snapped again, "Hermione! Get your bag. We have to leave, you understand? <em>Now</em>."</p>
      <p>She did not understand. She had no idea what had happened, though of course she was certain he would explain. Obviously, there was no time now. Hermione nodded and swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat. She managed to stumble over to her trunk and opened the lid, rummaging about until she pulled out the small purple bag. Inside it, she still had a good amount of emergency supplies - Dittany and other medical essentials, non-perishable food items, and some clothes. She began hurriedly putting everything she could stuff from her trunk into the bag, and looked up when she saw Severus' dragon-hide boots beside her.</p>
      <p>He was holding out her warm winter peacoat, a hat, and a pair of slip-on trainers. Hermione stood and wordlessly donned the shoes and warm goods before stuffing her purple bag into her coat pocket. She dashed over to the bedside table and snatched her wand, tucking it away before asking Severus in a tentative voice,</p>
      <p>"Where are we going?"</p>
      <p>"Not certain yet," Severus admitted. "Come with me."</p>
      <p>He began walking quickly out of their chambers, not bothering to look back. Once again, Hermione was struck by his urgency. He'd arrived perhaps sixty seconds previously, and already they were running out the door into his office. She followed Severus through the doorway and nearly ran into him when he paused for a brief moment to place strong Disillusionment Charms on both of them. She heard a small <em>clang</em> on the stone floor of the office and frowned when she realized Severus had yanked off the heavy wedding band he wore upon his left ring finger.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea what that thing can do," he said gravely, "but if there's any chance it can track us… well, in any case, it's staying here. We're going out to the Apparition Point. We're going to run - <em>run</em> - you understand me? When we get there, grab hold of me and we'll do Side-Along Apparition."</p>
      <p>Hermione felt queasy. What on Earth had happened to so quickly endanger their lives? Had someone else died, as well? Was Harry alive? Ginny? Neville? Luna? What had come to pass this night?</p>
      <p>As they sprinted up the staircases from the dungeons, Hermione brushed fearful tears from her eyes and tried to steel herself. She and Severus finally made it up to the main level of the castle and passed by the heavy wooden doors of the Great Hall. She knew their steps were clattering loudly in the corridors, and she was grateful it was the middle of the night and that the castle was deserted.</p>
      <p>She followed Severus' mostly-invisible form as he flung open the doors that led outside to the main entrance of the school, and they pattered through the icy night over the cobblestones. Then down over the path they trotted until Hermione's chest ached and burned and her breath was stinging through her nostrils.</p>
      <p>Finally, they reached the Apparition Point, and Hermione slowed her steps. She heard Severus breathlessly murmur, "Take… take my hand, Hermione."</p>
      <p>She turned back toward the castle for the briefest of moments, staring at its black silhouette in the still night air. This was the second time she'd left Hogwarts under duress. She did not think she'd be lucky enough to see it again. This was probably goodbye to the school. She tried to sear the image of the place into her head, the school where she'd grown from a child to a woman.</p>
      <p>Then she felt Severus' hand roughly clasp over hers and squeeze tightly, and she was suddenly pinching and whirling as they Disapparated together.</p>
