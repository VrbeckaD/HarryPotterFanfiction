    <p> </p><p>Albus marched purposefully into his dorm. Scorpius had been in there with the curtains pulled around his four-poster since he had left the Great Hall early the night before. Albus wasn’t about to let his friend stay in there <em>all </em>day, moping about who-knows-what.</p><p>            “Scorpius?” Albus called, as he walked into the room. He yanked back the curtains to find Scorpius curled up in a ball, under a mountain of blankets and books. Scorpius groaned, reluctantly facing him, and Albus saw that his eyes were red. “Scorpius, what’s wrong? And what’s with all these books, even for you, this is excessive…” he trailed off, looking at the covers. “The Notebook...and….is that Romeo and Juliet?” Albus asked incredulously.</p><p>            “Rosebrokeupwithme…” Scorpius mumbled quickly.</p><p>            Albus felt his heart start to beat faster. “Oh, merlin. Sorry Scorpius.” Truth be told, Albus was perfectly fine with giving him his condolences, letting him cry a bit, and then having him stay <em>far </em>away from Rose. She was his cousin, but he had no bloody idea why Scorpius was so hung up on her. Not to mention the whole fancying him bit. So, he would have to help his, his best-friend-who-he-sometimes-hugs get his bloody girlfriend back.</p><p>If Albus knew one thing about Scorpius, it was that he was a nerdy romantic. Appealing to this was a foolproof way to get him back on track.</p><p>Albus sat down on the bed and began, “But this doesn’t mean you’re gonna give up on her, right?”</p><p>Scorpius looked back up, miserably. “Well, what am I <em>supposed </em>to do?”</p><p>“Chase after her!” Albus exclaimed.</p><p>“I think-I think I’ll just stay right here. I have a toilet, chocolate frogs, and a comfortable bed. What else do I need?”</p><p>“Scorpius!” Albus said, shaking his head. “You can’t just stay here forever!”</p><p>“Well, actually, I kinda can…”</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes.  “You know how my dad brought home from work that portrait of Dumbledore?”</p><p>Scorpius looked at him suspiciously. “...yeah.”</p><p>“Well, er, I didn’t tell you about this, but I’ve been-I’ve been talking with him.”</p><p>“Wasn’t that for like, top-secret Ministry business? You’re allowed to go and talk to him?”</p><p>“Er-not technically, no. I snuck into my dad’s study over the holidays.”</p><p>Scorpius let out a laugh and clapped him on the shoulder. “That’s brilliant! Dumbledore must know so much stuff about, well, <em>everything. </em>I wouldn’t even know what to ask him. What did he tell you?”</p><p>“First he told me something about wishing my dad hadn’t named me Albus and that he hoped I grew up nothing like him.” Albus muttured.</p><p>“How… encouraging.”</p><p>Albus laughed. “Yeah, I walked right out after that. Almost didn’t come back. But, I dunno, at the same time, I wanted to hear more.” Albus was suddenly conscious of the fact that Scorpius’ hand had never left his shoulder. “Er-anway, he’s been telling me stories about the old days, you know, the First Wizarding War. And…I asked him about my grandparents.”</p><p>Scorpius removed his arm from Albus and looked at him closely, causing Albus to blush more than if Scorpius had still been touching him.“Your dad doesn’t talk about them that much, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean they died when he was kids and all….yeah, er, it turns out there’s <em>loads </em>to talk about. They were like, the greatest romance that ever happened in this castle. So, I’m gonna tell you a story.” Without waiting for Scorpius’ response, he reached out for Scorpius’ wrist. Then he touched the tip of his wand to his head and began to murmur under his breath, “<em>Relatus fabulam horoma, relatus fabulam horoma, relatus fabulam horoma…” </em>As Albus repeated the enchantment, magic surged through the air and mist began to flow from the tip of Albus’ wand.  “Al!” Scorpius said, alarmed. “What the hell’s going on!?” And despite Scorpius holding tightly to a pole on his four-poster, their surroundings began to melt and morph until they were standing on a familiar train.</p><p>The train lurched, pulling out of the station, and Scorpius shook his head, trying to get his bearings.</p><p>“So, are we-- are we in the story?” He asked hesitantly, as he looked around.</p><p>Albus nodded, proudly. “I’m telling the story in my head, and the magic responds to my thoughts, playing it out in front of you.”</p><p>“Woah, Al.” Scorpius said, running his hand through his hair. “This-this is brilliant.” Albus looked down to hide his blush. “I was cross at you for dragging me from my comfy pity party, but this is bloody amazing! Where did you learn how to do it?”</p><p>Albus smirked. “Dumbledore taught me a thing or two."</p><p>"This is a complicated bit of magic, it must have taken <em>years </em>to perfect! I was reading about something like this in the library the other day, it was a research paper by a man who spent his life-”</p><p>"I’d love to hear about this later, but if you keep talking about how brilliant it is, you’re gonna miss the story.” Albus grinned at him. “Look!” He pointed to a redheaded girl, running into the compartment next to them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
