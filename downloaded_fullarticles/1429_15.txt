      <b>The Creating of a Life Debt</b>
    </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>5th September 1974 – They were in the first potions lesson of the new school year and it seemed like many of their classmates had lost the ability to read or to use their common sense while brewing potions. That could be the only way to explain the idiocy of James Potter and Sirius Black, who had somehow managed to grab the wrong ingredients from the student’s stores as they were working on brewing a standard burn salve.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Severus and Lily were almost finished with their potions because, once again, Severus used his own adaptations and he had taught Lily, who preferred to brew following Professor Slughorn’s method, well. Severus had already reduced the heat under his cauldron and started to clean his work space. Even though he had begun cleaning up and his potion was nearly finished, Severus kept a strong shield up around his work station, to avoid anyone sabotaging his potions. It was one of a few shields he could perform using wandless magic– and he had drilled Lily mercilessly until she could concentrate and maintain her own shield, even at a time when somewhere in class a cauldron melted or exploded.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Checking the cauldron again, Severus noticed that his burn salve was finished, so </span>
  <span>— </span>
  <span>dousing the heat, Severus lifted his hand to call the professor over while carefully filling a vial with his potion. If Slughorn deemed his potion acceptable, then he would empty the cauldron into numerous vials so that he would have enough to get rid of some of the evidence of his prior abuse at his father’s hands. It was the only remedy he had found that was strong enough to remove the scars from cigarette burns from his limbs.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>That was another secret he could not share with Lily, or most people really. She didn’t know anything about his previous home life…well, except the bare necessities, and Severus would do anything for it to stay that way. He would not be able to endure her pity, nor did he want to be responsible for making her cry. And Lilly would cry if she saw all the scars caused by Tobias’ fury and cruelty.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Professor Slughorn walked over and tested the salve before marking an ‘O’ for Severus in his notebook. He patted Severus’ shoulder and informed him that his potion was good enough for the hospital wing and asked if Severus would please fill at least ten vials with his potion for Poppy, while Slughorn took one for his own stores.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Severus grimaced as he had plans for that salve, but he obeyed his professor. He could always brew more since he knew that his modified recipe worked, and that was enough for the young Slytherin. Severus filled the requested vials and sealed them, before continuing to clean his workstation. This was the moment when the young Slytherin looked up and his eyes landed on the mishmash ingredients on Potter and Black’s workstation, and Severus lost his last bit of colour.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Those dunderheads had not just grabbed the wrong ingredients </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> aren’t they able to read?! Severus mind screamed. In addition to getting the wrong ingredients, they were preparing them incorrectly. If they mixed those into the boiling mixture as they were preparing to do, it would explode and harm the whole class. Not only was their concoction explosive, but it also looked to be very acidic.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Without considering the consequences, Severus drew his wand and cast the strongest protection shield he knew for such problems around Professor Slughorn and the other students, before tackling Black and Potter. It worked… too well for them, but Severus had still been right in front of the exploding cauldron and he got a direct hit </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> his own shield disappeared, as did all his clothes due to the acidic mixture and the of fumes and potion. Finally, the lithe Slytherin got thrown directly into Professor Slughorn’s desk.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Gasping in shock at the scene, Professor Slughorn belatedly pulled out his own wand to contain the exploded potion under a strong stasis field, as was the procedure demanded by the Potions Guild for such an occurrence. The professor then sent a Patronus to Poppy, urgently demanding her presence in the Potions class room.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Potter and Black didn’t really understand what had happened, not even as they saw the unconscious Slytherin lying in front of Slughorn’s desk. Lily had knelt beside him, crying silently, when she realised how much her best friend had to suffer at home. Due to him being naked, she finally saw Severus’ scars, though she realized that those scars were most likely only a small part of the story. Lilly felt like her heart would break as she began to realise the truth.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Poppy stormed into the room and she wasn’t alone. Minerva had been with her since she had a free slot during this hour. Together they conjured a robe to lay over Severus and transfigured a stretcher and placed the injured boy on it.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>I can’t heal him here, Minerva, there is too much damage. He needs to be taken to St. Mungo’s. We also need to collect the memories of the students and Professor Slughorn in order to learn how this fiasco could have happened. But I can already tell you that they are very lucky that nothing more happened, because from the way things look, they all could have died if young Mr. Snape had reacted one minute later”, said Poppy seriously.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Does that mean that they all owe him their lives, Poppy?”, asked Minerva flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>That is exactly what it means, Minerva. I told you and the others time and time again that Severus is a good person. It is quite overdue that you lot took off your blinders regarding Severus, but that is not what is important right now”, Poppy responded. “We need to call for help from St. Mungo’s and then someone has to inform his legal guardians.”</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Er, Madame Pomfrey”, Evan interrupted quietly, “Severus has been living with the Malfoys since last Yule. I don’t know why, but Lord Malfoy had been adamant, at the time, about the necessity of becoming his new guardian.”</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>It doesn’t matter now, but thank you for your information”, Minerva answered for Poppy. “We need to get him to St. Mungo’s and then we need to figure out how this could have happened. But all of you should be very grateful that Mr. Snape acted to protect your lives when he did. Without his actions you would all have died in that explosion!”</span></p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Poppy sent her Patronus to St. Mungo’s while Minerva sent her own to Malfoy Manor to inform Lord Malfoy about the accident. This day would change the course of history, as never before had one single action resulted in </span>
  <span>
    <b>50 life debts owed to a single person</b>
  </span>
  <span>. Both women were convinced that Albus would not like the results of this day at all, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. Magic simply would not allow it.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The healers arrived with their own stretcher and carefully placed the injured boy on it. They then used their emergency portkey to take them to the surgical area of St. Mungo’s. Their scans had shown that at least one </span>
  <span>surgery</span>
  <span> would be needed to ensure that Severus would wake up again.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Both the Slytherins and the Gryffindors waited until Minerva ordered them back to their common room </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> none of them would need to go to class for the rest of the day. But they were told that they should be ready to be interviewed about the accident at any time. Meals would be served in the common rooms for both houses.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>When will we be allowed to visit Severus, Professor?”, Avery asked Minerva politely. “We want to see how he is doing, and we want to thank him for saving our lives.”</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Minerva smiled sadly at them and replied, “I do not know at this time. But I will go to St. Mungo’s and speak with his healers about it. Until then, I want you all to promise that none of you will speak or even write to anyone about what has happened here today. Should you disobey me, I will be very displeased and punish the offenders harshly. You have been warned!”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Professor Slughorn coughed and told them all to go back to their common rooms. Homework would be ten inches about lab safety and potions accident prevention. The homework was set to be due the next morning at breakfast.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The students left the Potions classroom with their book bags in their hands, quietly murmuring to each other about what had happened. Evan made sure to grab Severus’ satchel and would place it on Severus’ bed when he got back to the Slytherin dormitory. It was the least he could do for his friend. He hoped that Severus would soon be feeling better and return to Hogwarts. Things would not be the same without him.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>And then Evan remembered something else. Severus was being courted by an older man </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> something which had begun after he had moved in with the Malfoys. There may even be an old marriage contract between their families, but the older man had still decided to court Severus according to their traditions. After all, it was only fair in his opinion. Severus deserved to be treated much better than he was in the past. When his suitor found out what happened…well, that would not end well for any of them. It was too bad that someone would need to inform him, despite Professor </span>
  <span>McGonnagall’s</span>
  <span> warning to keep quiet about it, or the reaction would be even worse. The suitor’s temper was legendary among the Slytherin families.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Marvolo, Severus’ suitor, had offered to hire the best tutors available should Severus decide that he did not want to return to Hogwarts after passing his OWLs, but Severus had not indicated that he would accept or reject this courting gift. Even though Evan would miss his friend, he felt that Severus would benefit far more from having excellent tutors, than staying at Hogwarts. Especially after having to put up with the abuse from the Marauders and neglect from most of the professors.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Come what may, they would inform Lucius about the accident and ask him to inform Marvolo. Hopefully they would not need to wait long for Severus to wake up again. A short nod to Mulciber indicated that they would talk later about it. It was time to devise a strategy for how they would handle certain Gryffindors. They really could not wait to see the student’s reaction once the events of that morning got around, particularly the reaction of the Marauders, after the shock wore off. Honestly, Evan and his friends would enjoy holding the fact that the Marauders now owed their lives to Severus over their heads. They wondered if the Marauders would still dare to behave like they were Merlin’s gift to mankind after it got around school that a </span>
  <span>
    <em>slimy Slytherin</em>
  </span>
  <span>, one who they had bullied relentlessly, </span>
  <span>had to save their pathetic lives.</span>
