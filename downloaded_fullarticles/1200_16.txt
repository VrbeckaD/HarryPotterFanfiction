  <strong> <em>Ohh, can't anybody see</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>We've got a war to fight</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>Never found our way</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>Regardless of what they say</em> </strong>

  <em>‘Ron, catch — and GO!’ he yelled, throwing two wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and he spun on the spot to Disapparate.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>As he turned into darkness, he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing</em>—</p><p align="justify">Harry reacted instinctively, his Seeker reflexes kicking into gear. He shoved Dobby’s hand onto the goblin’s arm, dropping the goblin to his feet, and, as his friends vanished, he grabbed the silver dagger, the blade biting his flesh. Everyone stared speechless at Harry, standing alone in the wrecked room with Malfoy’s wand in one hand and the knife in the other. Drops of blood spilled from his palm on the rose carpet, and the pain gave Harry pause.</p><p align="justify">But only for a second. Before a weaponless Bellatrix had a chance to react, before Narcissa had even thought of moving, and with his scar blinding him with pain, Harry turned on the spot to Disapparate, but he still wasn’t fast enough: a hand grabbed his wrist. Harry turned into darkness, but the person’s hands were tight on his, pulling the wand, and he thought feverishly: <em>not Bill and Fleur’s</em>, <em>take me away, not Tinworth, away, away</em>. He twisted and fought and turned…</p><p align="justify">And found himself on a windy seaside cliff with Draco Malfoy, both of them wrestling with the wand for a brief moment, until Malfoy released it with a grunt and collapsed on the ground.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Panting, Harry raised the wand. He glimpsed the unforgiving chasm behind his back and took a step sideways, while in front of him, on his knees, Malfoy clutched his shoulder, blood oozing from his robes from where he’d been Splinched. Harry took a few more careful steps, walking around Malfoy, keeping the wand trained on him. The roar of the waves drowned out any coherent thought except for the pounding of his heart, but his hand remained steady.</p><p align="justify">Breathing heavily, Malfoy looked up, his face a portrait of fury. ‘That’s mine, you prick,’ he spat, his eyes on the wand.</p><p align="justify">‘Tough shit.’ Having put a few feet distance between them, Harry turned on the spot before Malfoy could rush him, thinking of his destination, but nothing happened. He spun again urgently, concentrating on Shell Cottage, but the magic failed him. Malfoy slowly rose to his feet, and Harry pointed the wand at him and cried, ‘Stupefy!’</p><p align="justify">All the wand did was emit a thin column of acrid smoke.</p><p align="justify">Panicked, Harry called out another set of curses, but the wand let out yellow, rancid-smelling sparks.</p><p align="justify">‘What’s wrong with my wand?’ Malfoy asked, horrified.</p><p align="justify">Harry examined it, his mind refusing to accept he had a malfunctioning wand in his hands. Any last shred of hope he might have still entertained left him: a deep crack ran along the length of it and something silvery-white peeked from inside. <em>Shit</em>.</p><p align="justify">‘Your wand’s ruined.’ Harry pocketed it, unwilling to part with a wand, no matter how broken, and brandished the dagger. The wind howled as it whipped the dark waves below them into fury and cut through Harry’s jumper, goosebumps erupting on his skin.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy huffed, cold and contemptuous, his eyes on his aunt’s knife. ‘Will you kill me, Potter?’ he asked, his voice taunting. Malfoy had never been that good of an actor; the trembling of his hands and his shallow breathing belied his uncertainty in Harry’s benevolent nature.</p><p align="justify">It pissed Harry off. ‘I’m not like <em>you</em>,’ he spat. ‘Ambushing wizards in towers to kill them in cold blood.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy flinched. A step backwards brought him almost to the edge. ‘Careful!’ Harry blurted out, as some gravel fell off the cliff and disappeared in the yawning darkness. Malfoy hurried away from the edge, and Harry, holding the dagger high, retreated towards the slope behind him, eager to put some distance between the two of them, and <em>think.</em></p><p align="justify">And that’s when his scar split open and he dropped to his knees, crying in pain.</p><p align="justify">His eyes surveyed the drawing room again; Lucius, Bellatrix and Narcissa writhing on the floor, their faces contorted in agony, but for Bellatrix’s deranged, ecstatic martyr’s smile.</p><p align="justify">‘Your son should’ve reached out to me <em>instantly,</em>’ Harry hissed, lowering the wand.</p><p align="justify">‘Perhaps he’s hurt,’ Narcissa gasped. ‘He’s not disloyal, my Lord, he’s probably just hurt.’</p><p align="justify">‘Perhaps. Or perhaps he decided to aid Potter.’</p><p align="justify">‘No, no.’ Lucius shook his head. ‘No, he’d never do that… If you let me or my wife look for him—’</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Enough</em>, Lucius. You’re mistaken if you think I’ll allow you to leave this residence again. I’ll let you keep your lives, which is more than you deserve.’</p><p align="justify">‘Th-thank you, my Lord,’ said Lucius, and Bellatrix knelt and touched her forehead to Voldemort’s shoe. Narcissa simply bowed, her terrified eyes stark on her pale face.</p><p align="justify">For all their poise and arrogance, for all their vanity and talk of great deeds, the Malfoys scurried out of the room in an undignified haste, and Voldemort would laugh at their blatant cowardice if he hadn’t been simmering with rage and frustration. He paced past the shattered chandelier until Rookwood and Dolohov came and kneeled at his feet.</p><p align="justify">‘My Lord?’ said Dolohov.</p><p align="justify">‘Find them,’ the cold voice said. ‘Find them and bring them both to me alive.’</p><p align="justify">‘The Malfoy boy, too?’ Rookwood dared to ask and earned a slash in the face for it.</p><p align="justify">Voldemort’s — Harry’s — long, white fingers caressed his wand. ‘I said <em>both</em>. Bring the Malfoy brat so he can die, squealing, in front of Lucius. The Malfoys need to be taken to task. I’ve allowed their incompetence to go unpunished for far too long.’ Fury coursed through his veins at the thought of Potter escaping his grasp again. ‘But don’t speak of this. Pretend their son is coming home.’ This would make it all the more painful for the Malfoys. All the more edifying a lesson.</p><p align="justify">The men bowed, foreheads on a floor still covered in broken glass and blood, and Harry came to, his scar pulsing with pain.</p><p align="justify">A soft drizzle fell on his fevered face and he took deep breaths, letting the smell of the ocean fill his lungs. He wasn’t used to this scent; the Dursleys rarely took him to the seaside with them when he was little. He found it overwhelming.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy had divested him of wand and dagger, the latter pointed at his face by a trembling hand. He shivered, his fancy robes too thin for this weather, flapping in the wind. Harry ignored Malfoy’s dagger and tried to stand up, but couldn’t. His forehead still stung and he felt clammy and weak. He dug his fingers into the soil — <em>his</em> fingers, not Voldemort’s — and took another deep breath of salt air.</p><p align="justify">‘What happened to you?’ Malfoy asked in a quavering voice.</p><p align="justify">‘Your parents are alive,’ Harry said.</p><p align="justify">‘How do you know?’ Malfoy gasped. ‘Potter, how do— can you see— can you see <em>him</em>?’</p><p align="justify">Harry said nothing. The vision flitted in and out of his mind, pulling him back to Voldemort’s brain. Briefly, he closed his eyes: an announcement to the Malfoys that Dolohov and Rookwood were out searching for their son. <em>The boy will be returned to you</em>. Narcissa stood straight, white as marble, and Lucius knelt, a man broken and humiliated.</p><p align="justify">Harry opened his eyes again. He could keep his connection to Voldemort a secret, but what was the point anymore? ‘You-Know-Who is sending two of his Death Eaters to find us.’ Malfoy’s horrified eyes surprised him, but perhaps he had enough sense to know what that meant. ‘He told your parents he’ll bring you home but, in truth, he’s planning to kill you in front of them. To punish them.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy looked sick, but not particularly surprised. Harry rose to his feet. ‘He Crucioed your parents. You can imagine what that was like.’</p><p align="justify">‘Stop it.’</p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t stop. ‘You can call him, you know. Get yourself out of this mess. Just touch that little Dark Mark you have on your arm, and he’ll be here in a jiffy.’</p><p align="justify">‘Shut up, Potter!’</p><p align="justify">‘He wants us both. He’ll kill you to punish your father, and he’ll kill me because he’s been trying to do that my whole life, which means if the Death Eaters find us, we’re both dead,’ Harry continued, relentless. ‘This is how much you matter to him. This is how much he cares for his followers. <em>This</em> is the man you chose to give your allegiance to.’</p><p align="justify">‘Do you think I don’t fucking know that?’ Malfoy snarled. The wind whipped his hair around his face, bright even in the darkness. ‘Do you think I don’t know by now what I’ve <em>done</em>? Did you think I was waiting for <em>you</em> to come and <em>enlighten</em> me about— the things I’ve <em>seen</em>— you have no fucking clue how much I—’ He staggered back a step, breathing hard, his hand on the knife unsteady.</p><p align="justify">‘Cry me a river,’ Harry said, full of contempt. ‘Don’t expect any fucking sympathy from me. You made your bed and now you’re sleeping in it.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy stared at him, eyes growing cold. ‘Maybe he’ll reward me if I give you to him. Maybe you’re lying.’</p><p align="justify">‘Go on then — if you’re so sure you can deliver me. Press that fucking tattoo on your arm and he’ll come. You’ll be with your parents again. Wouldn’t bet on how long.’</p><p align="justify">Harry’s heart beat frantically. If Malfoy did actually try to Summon his lord, then Harry would have to— incapacitate him in some way. His body tensed in anticipation of a fight.</p><p align="justify">However, despite his posturing, Malfoy seemed reluctant to take advantage of his direct line to Voldemort. The hand that held the dagger fell limp by his side.</p><p align="justify">‘Where the fuck are we?’ he said instead.</p><p align="justify">That was a good question. Harry had first thought of Shell Cottage, but when Malfoy grabbed him, he kept thinking ‘<em>away</em>’. Did the magic take him <em>away </em>from the cottage? Were they in Cornwall, perhaps within walking distance to Tinworth, or did they end up in Wales or, Merlin forbid, <em>Yorkshire</em>?</p><p align="justify">‘I’ve no idea.’</p><p align="justify">They were certainly in the countryside: a few pinpricks of light punctuated dark, endless fields. Headlights from a car slithered in the distance. Harry turned — he doubted Malfoy would stab him in the back, he’d had plenty of opportunity to do so when Harry lay helplessly on the ground — and set off down the hill, stumbling in the dark. He needed to figure out where he was and perhaps find somewhere to spend the night. Lost, wandless, alone, and unable to contact his friends; things couldn’t get any worse. At the thought of Ron and Hermione, his chest hurt. Were they safe? Was Hermione OK? Hate flared in his chest for Malfoy; Malfoy, who stood there and watched a young girl being tortured by his evil aunt.</p><p align="justify">Footsteps sounded behind him.</p><p align="justify">‘Where do you think you’re going?’ Harry snapped.</p><p align="justify">‘I’m not staying in the middle of fucking nowhere, Potter.’</p><p align="justify">‘Well, don’t bloody well follow me!’</p><p align="justify">‘I’m not following <em>you</em>, idiot. I’m going in the same direction.’</p><p align="justify">Harry stopped and indicated he should go first. ‘Arse,’ Malfoy muttered as he passed in front of him. Harry resisted the urge to punch him.</p><p align="justify">By the time they reached the road, Malfoy at the front and Harry at his heels, the drizzle turned into rain and it was bone-chillingly cold. Reluctant to walk along a country road at night, Harry cast his eye around him. A ruin of a building loomed in the darkness, not far from Harry, and he turned towards it. From the sound of shoes trudging the soft, wet earth, Malfoy was heading that way, too.</p><p align="justify">It was farther than Harry had assumed. He let his thoughts drift back to the Manor, back to the things he’d heard there, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. His thoughts beat with the rhythm of his footsteps on the ground. Hallows… Horcruxes… Hallows… Horcruxes… The obsessive longing for the Hallows burned in him, but his worry about his friends and the predicament he found himself in had dimmed the fire. No matter how much it’d cost him to lose the holly and phoenix wand, he hadn’t had to do without one completely. Despair filled him. He felt impotent. He realised how crucial the loss of the wand was, because he was beginning to understand, and he knew — he could feel — Voldemort beginning to understand as well. He knew where the Elder Wand had been all this time and Harry, unable to stop what was about to happen, knew that he’d lost. He’d lost one of the Hallows.</p><p align="justify">He wished for so many things under that vast, dark sky: he wished he knew what Dumbledore had really wanted him to do; he wished he hadn’t failed him; he wished the next Horcrux wasn’t where he suspected it was; but most of all he wished this whole mission didn’t feel increasingly like a march to his death. He wished he was wrong about this.</p><p align="justify">The derelict stone farmhouse smelled of animals and dust, and half of the front wall had collapsed, but it had a roof and the floor was dry. It’d have to do. He sat heavily in a corner as far from Malfoy as he could.</p><p align="justify">As the fatigue of the evening washed over Harry, he dropped his head against the wall and closed his eyes. He wondered if he should keep them open, if he should be alert with Malfoy around — c<em>onstant vigilance</em>! — but he realised, as the day’s aches slowly manifested in various parts of his body, that he wasn’t afraid of Malfoy. That he actually felt safe — or rather, not <em>unsafe</em>.</p><p align="justify">Still, sounds of activity from the other boy’s corner made him look. His eyes could just make out the fair hair and the slow movements, as Malfoy unbuttoned his damp robes and winced when he uncovered the hurt shoulder. Harry struggled to make out the injury in the dark until Malfoy stood and walked to the collapsed wall, which let in what little light there was to be found that night. The skin appeared to be torn. A deep scratch, that was all. <em>Serves him right</em>.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy cupped his hand and stretched it outside, gathering rain water. He washed the wound on his shoulder, then he started on his face. He tried to extract what must have been tiny pieces of glass from the shattered chandelier, but without a mirror his job was hard. Harry could have helped him. He didn’t want to. The sight of the unconscious, tormented Hermione, too fresh in his memory, caused only uncharitable resentment. So he watched him instead, what little he could discern in the dark. Draco’s movements were careful and delicate. Neither of them spoke; not Malfoy cleaning his wounds, nor Harry watching him.</p><p align="justify">Eventually, Malfoy covered the hurt shoulder. Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly. He drew his knees close to his chest and shut his eyes, trying to forget about the hunger, the aches, the damp clothes, the helplessness. He longed for some rest, although he was too tense to imagine he’d sleep through the night.</p><p align="justify">He raised his head at the sound of approaching footsteps.</p><p align="justify">‘Here.’ Malfoy stretched out his hand, half a chocolate frog in it. ‘I had it in my pocket. Take it.’</p><p align="justify">For a second, Harry almost reached for the chocolate, but his rage over the events at the Manor took over and he told him where to shove his chocolate frog. ‘I don’t want anything from you, <em>ever</em>.’ A hunger pang almost split him in half, but he ignored it.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy’s eyes grew cold at the rejection. ‘Suit yourself.’ Staring at Harry, he bit into the chocolate. Before he turned to leave, he threw the card at Harry’s feet. ‘Take this then. He’s your hero.’</p><p align="justify">Harry picked the card up with shaking hands. Dumbledore winked at him and straightened his hat. Harry was seized by the irrational desire to shout at the image of the man who waved at him, oblivious to the feelings of grief and love and resentment warring inside Harry at the thought of his old Professor. He gave vent to his frustration, not towards the portrait of the man on the collector’s card, but to the flesh and blood man sitting some feet away.</p><p align="justify">‘Can’t stand to see the man you almost killed?’</p><p align="justify">‘How about you shut up?’ </p><p align="justify">‘Is that why you tried to stop me? To prove yourself to your Master?’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy didn’t speak for a moment. ‘I’m not sure I was trying to stop you.’</p><p align="justify">‘Then what were you trying to do? Come with me? <em>Join my side</em>? Do you really think I’ll buy that?’</p><p align="justify">‘I just wanted my fucking wand back, Potter.’</p><p align="justify">‘Rich bloke like you can’t get another wand? Oh, but of course — unlikely to find a decent one when you put the wandmaker in chains in your dungeon.’</p><p align="justify">‘That had <em>nothing</em> to do with me,’ Malfoy hissed.</p><p align="justify">‘Everything to do with your father.’</p><p align="justify">‘How thick can you get, Potter? Do you believe we have a say what happens in our house anymore? We live at the pleasure of the Dark Lord. Or not, as the case might be; as you, so helpfully, have witnessed in whatever creepy way you—<em> h</em><em>old on</em>, can <em>he</em> read your mind, too? Can he see where you are?’</p><p align="justify">‘He won’t.’ Harry pressed his knees to his chest and hoped he was right. He shivered under his damp clothes and the constant rumblings from his stomach made him wish he’d accepted the chocolate frog.</p><p align="justify">‘How can you be so sure?’</p><p align="justify">‘I am.’</p><p align="justify">‘How <em>Potter</em>.’ A pause, then gently, ‘Can you see where he is now?’</p><p align="justify">Harry hated how easy it was to do that. Closing his eyes and sinking into the connection, he could see Voldemort’s mind reaching the same conclusion about the Elder Wand. He could see Voldemort Apparating into Hogsmeade, walking the quiet, familiar streets on his way to the castle. ‘He’s— far north. He’s after a wand.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy shuffled a little. ‘It’s all about the wand. You were raised by Muggles, you have no idea. No wand means you’re more useless than flobberworms. Did you hear what Aunt Bella said to my father? That he lost his authority when he lost his wand? <em>That’s</em> why I grabbed you, Potter. I’d rather lose an arm than my wand.’</p><p align="justify">‘Well, now you’ll lose more than that.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy chuckled mirthlessly. ‘In case it’s escaped your notice, we’re both screwed, Potter.’</p><p align="justify">‘Thanks to you,’ Harry murmured full of resentment.</p><p align="justify">‘If you think our past history played any role in me grabbing you tonight, you’re a bigger idiot than I thought.’</p><p align="justify">‘It didn’t?’ Harry’s voice dripped with sarcasm. ‘Sure.’</p><p align="justify">‘It might surprise you to know this, but I <em>don’t </em>hate you, Potter.’ The <em>anymore</em> went unsaid. ‘There are worse things that an attention-seeking, specky git. If you were in school this year, you’d know.’</p><p align="justify">Harry ignored the insults, but the mention of Hogwarts piqued his curiosity. Snape was Headmaster and Malfoy ought to have loved lording it over everyone else with impunity, but his voice betrayed barely contained disgust. ‘How was school?’</p><p align="justify">‘Horrendous. The only good thing about the shit we’re in now is that I won’t have to go back.’</p><p align="justify">They didn’t speak much after that. Harry started feeling drowsy, the soft patter of the rain calming his heartbeats, soothing his burning mind; sleep started creeping in. Harry would have to think of a plan, how to get himself out of this situation. But first, with a last look at Malfoy’s curled, silent figure, he lay on the hard floor and let sleep take him.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p align="justify">Grey light woke Harry from a cold, troubled sleep. He took stock of his body before he got up: his head was heavy, his muscles ached, his stomach was seriously empty. He felt colder than he’d ever felt in his life, a chill under his skin that he couldn’t shake off. This was how it would have been if Hermione hadn’t packed her beaded bag with all the essentials. He felt a sudden pang of nostalgia for the tent, a palace compared to this musty ruin, what with the beds and blankets, the hot shower, and the woodstove.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy was sitting on the collapsed wall, facing the dew-covered fields that stretched in the distance. Harry came to stand next to him. The fresh, wet grass smell grounded him and dispelled the memory of the troubling dream. Often, after dreams or visions of Voldemort, Harry felt disconnected from his body, disoriented to be back in himself, and it troubled him more than anything. At such moments he needed touch or smell or taste; strong sensations to remind him he occupied <em>his </em>body; that he was Harry, and not an extension of Voldemort, a feeling that he couldn’t shake off and which terrified him.</p><p align="justify">A low mist hung over the land, clinging to the grass, swirling slowly with drifts of wind. Everything felt dreamlike and Harry wondered if he wasn’t, in fact, sleeping: never could he imagine that one day he’d end up stranded in the countryside with Draco Malfoy.</p><p align="justify">‘They’re doing blood magic,’ Malfoy said conversationally. ‘I can feel it under my skin. But they don’t have my actual blood, they’re probably using my parents’, so they won’t be able to track me down.’</p><p align="justify">‘Blood magic?’</p><p align="justify">‘For tracking. It’s an old pureblood spell. Keep a drop of your child’s blood in a glass vial and you’ll find him if he’s ever kidnapped. But a few years ago I destroyed the vial my mother kept. There’s all sorts of dark magic you can do with someone’s blood.’</p><p align="justify">Harry knew. He touched the forearm where Wormtail had slashed his skin.</p><p align="justify">Draco didn’t notice. ‘That’s why I make sure I never leave a single drop around at the Manor, not with all those… thugs coming and going.’</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Thugs</em>? Your parents’ friends?’ Harry scoffed.</p><p align="justify">‘Greyback and some others aren’t my parents’ friends.’</p><p align="justify">‘Sure. They just work for them.’</p><p align="justify">‘They work for <em>him</em>!’ Malfoy snapped.</p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t pursue the subject any more; an argument required more energy than he had to spare at the moment. Still, he marvelled at Malfoy’s insistence on distancing himself from the Master he so eagerly agreed to serve two years ago. They stayed silent for a while, both glaring at the sky as if it was its fault they were helpless.</p><p align="justify">Harry rubbed his palm. ‘I’ve left some of my blood in the Manor.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy looked at him in alarm. His eyes fell on Harry’s open palm and the soft, swollen pink tissue where the dagger had nicked him.</p><p align="justify">‘Do you feel a tug? Under your belly button?’</p><p align="justify">‘No. Is that what it feels like?’</p><p align="justify">‘Yes, and a silver thread connects your body to the blood. But, not to fret,’ he said. ‘If we’re lucky, the house-elves have cleaned up the mess already. Hopefully, no one will realise it’s <em>your</em> precious blood on our floor.’</p><p align="justify">Luck didn’t seem to be on Harry’s side lately. ‘What happens if they do the spell?’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy met his eyes. ‘They find you,’ he said simply. ‘Within minutes.’</p><p align="justify">It seemed the bad news wouldn’t stop. Harry had to hope the Malfoy house-elves performed their duties with diligence, but he couldn’t worry about it now. His priority was to find a way to Tinworth and his friends.</p><p align="justify">‘There’s a way to confuse the spell,’ Malfoy said, staring at the fields. ‘Mix your blood with someone else’s. Willingly.’</p><p align="justify">‘How?’</p><p align="justify">‘We both cut into our palms and hold hands. That’s all. We figured it out as kids, when Vincent’s mother — <em>so</em> controlling — kept using the spell when we played Quidditch for too long in the gardens.’</p><p align="justify">‘So I’m supposed to trust you with my blood? Thanks, but no thanks.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy pressed his lips tight. ‘Suit yourself.’</p><p align="justify">Harry examined Malfoy’s profile in silence. He couldn’t understand why he was being helpful, except to assume he had an ulterior motive. ‘I’m going to find out where we are,’ Harry said, setting off across the field. Wordlessly, Malfoy followed him.</p><p align="justify">They trudged through muddy fields and along a tree-lined path that lead to the country road. The temperature rose slightly as they walked, drying their still damp clothing. Harry knew what he must look like if Malfoy’s appearance was anything to go by. He felt damp <em>everywhere</em>, mud covered his trouser legs, and he probably smelled quite bad. Malfoy was all of that plus he sported a bloody shoulder.</p><p align="justify">Harry stared at him walking ahead with long strides and a straight back. He wondered whether Malfoy regretted his hasty decision to regain his wand. Harry’s brain, rested and calmer, reminded him of Malfoy’s refusal to identify Harry; the fear in his eyes when he saw the prisoners. He remembered how Malfoy’d offered the chocolate; a startling gesture of kindness that Harry hadn’t thought possible coming from him. Malfoy marched ahead, and Harry wondered if he felt as lost as Harry did; if he felt as unmoored, drifting down a swift current to a likely fatal end.</p><p align="justify">Shortly, they arrived at a sign that read: <em>Camelford 4 miles</em>. Harry tried to remember what he knew about UK geography — not much — but Malfoy recognised the name, explaining its link to the Arthurian legends. ‘We’re in Cornwall. Is that where you wanted to go?’</p><p align="justify">‘Wouldn’t you like to know.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘If you think this is an elaborate plan to spy on you and your precious Order, I wish you’d give me credit to concoct a scheme that wouldn’t end with my imminent death by snake.’</p><p align="justify">‘And I hope you don’t expect me to trust your word, because you’ll be disappointed.’</p><p align="justify">They marched along the road single file as the day brightened. Finally, some good news: now that he knew he was in Cornwall, Harry was certain he could walk to Tinworth; only he didn’t know where exactly Camelford was situated and also how to find Tinworth, since it wouldn’t appear on Muggle maps. Malfoy might know, but there’s no way he’d trust him with his intended destination. As he walked, Harry took out his broken wand from his pouch and then the shard of mirror where he’d seen the blue eye, desperately hoping for the eye to save him again. This time he could only see himself. He decided against attempting to Summon Dobby. He wasn’t even sure if the same magic that tied him to Kreacher tied him to the free elf, but he couldn’t afford the chance that Dobby had been taken, the same way Kreacher had been compromised. The last thing he needed was Death Eaters Apparating along with the elves, while Harry was defenceless.</p><p align="justify">By the time they reached the town, Harry was famished. His examination of his pockets had resulted in one positive discovery: a crumpled tenner, courtesy of the Snatchers’ ignorance of Muggle money. Harry stopped in front of a bakery, practically drooling at the shop window with the pastries and the rolls, and Malfoy paused next to him.</p><p align="justify">‘Looking at the food is worse,’ he said.</p><p align="justify">Harry said, ‘I’ve Muggle money. I won’t be just looking.’ He went inside.</p><p align="justify">When he came out, Malfoy had left. Harry took in the town, the shops, Muggle life chugging along, and the enormity of his current catastrophe hit him. He also felt unexpectedly alone. It was odd; although Malfoy was the last person he wanted to spend time with, there was comfort being with someone who shared his predicament. He dreaded to think how things would have turned out for him had he set out on his own without Ron and Hermione. He’d have gone mad. Harry had never thought consciously before of how much he owed to them for their company, let alone everything else, and his chest ached with how much he missed them.</p><p align="justify">Camelford’s narrow streets led to a pretty river where Malfoy sat on a bench in muddy, bloody robes, attracting hostile looks from the locals. Harry stood for a moment, clutching his purchases, and watched him. Malfoy looked defeated, head in his hands, staring at the ground. A little voice told Harry that he could leave. He owed nothing to Malfoy. He could simply walk away and start figuring out how to reach his friends.</p><p align="justify">Instead, Harry approached him. ‘This is for you.’</p><p align="justify">Malfoy’s eyes widened in surprise when he saw the proffered Cornish pasty in Harry’s hand.</p><p align="justify">He wondered if Malfoy would throw it back in his face, the way Harry had with the chocolate. But Malfoy, unlike Harry, didn’t let his pride override common sense. He thanked Harry, unwrapped the pasty, and bit into it while Harry sat on the next bench, eating his own and sipping from a bottle of orange juice. His shopping had left him with about three quid. That was nothing to go on in the Muggle world.</p><p align="justify">‘I’m going to try and make it to Tinworth,’ Malfoy said, balling up the wrapping. He threw the ball in the nearest bin and gave a small smile when it landed neatly inside. ‘It’s a wizarding village in Cornwall. There’s bound to be someone there who can fix my wand — or at least, a second-hand wand shop.’</p><p align="justify">Harry realised it’d be hard to disguise the fact he was also going to Tinworth if they bumped into each other along the way. ‘I think I’m gonna head there, too,’ he admitted. He turned to Malfoy. ‘You’ll buy a wand? Do you even have money with you?’</p><p align="justify">‘Of course,’ Malfoy said, ‘I always carry a few galleons.’</p><p align="justify">A few turned out to be nine pieces, something close to a hundred and eighty pounds. Malfoy put the coins back in his pocket and said carefully, ‘We’re both on the run, Potter. Both going to Tinworth.’</p><p align="justify">The implication of what he was suggesting hit Harry with sudden clarity.</p><p align="justify">‘I have gold,’ Malfoy continued. ‘You have Muggle knowledge. We can help each other get there.’</p><p align="justify">Harry’s mind warned him about everything that could go wrong — about the madness of trusting a Malfoy. But he didn’t like the alternative and he had to admit Malfoy’s suggestion made sense. Besides, Harry needn't mention Shell Cottage. As soon as they reached Tinworth, he’d clear off and leave Malfoy to his own schemes.</p><p align="justify">‘Alright then,’ he heard himself say.</p><p align="justify">Malfoy’s shoulders relaxed. ‘Truce?’  </p><p align="justify">The river sang softly behind them, and Harry thought he must have gone mad after all.</p><p align="justify">‘Truce.’ </p>
