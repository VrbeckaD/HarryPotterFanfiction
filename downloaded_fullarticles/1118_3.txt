    <p>Harry walked through the castle grounds after a failed attempt to visit Hagrid, who was apparently not back from whatever mission Dumbledore had sent him on. It was Sunday before term and the students were enjoying their last bit of freedom in the unseasonably warm weather. Not in a real hurry to get back to Gryffindor Tower after being accused of lying by half of his housemates, Harry took a winding, leisurely path around the lake as he went along his way.</p><p>“Oi, Potter!”</p><p>He looked over to see Pansy Parkinson sitting on a mat underneath a tree waving at him.</p><p>And it had been such a good day.</p><p>“What do you want, Parkinson?”</p><p>“I need a favor. Come here.”</p><p>Harry thought that the day he did a favor for a Slytherin would be the day Snape proposed to Lupin, but he found himself walking over anyway. What could it hurt, he thought. Usually when she and Draco were up to something, they didn’t tell him first.</p><p>On her large, colorful mat sat deck of cards. They were taller and thinner that a normal deck and there seemed to be more cards than usual.</p><p>“What do you want?” He repeated.</p><p>“Sit down,” she said, ignoring the question. “Let’s talk.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Fine then, I’ll stand.” Getting up, she said, “Trewlaney told us last year that if we wanted to take N.E.W.T. level divination we had to do a special project in 5th year. Do you remember?”</p><p>He didn’t. He barely paid attention in divination. He was too busy trying to come up with lies for his homework.</p><p>“I didn’t think so. Well, this is mine. I’m doing Tarot readings this year. I’m going to follow up on my readings and write an essay about what I got right and wrong. And I want you,” here she pointed at him, “to be one of my clients. Free of charge, of course.”</p><p>‘Cause <em>that</em> had been what he’d been worrying about.</p><p>“I figure having your name in my report couldn’t hurt. Especially if I predict your death.” She picked up the top card of her deck and waved it. On it was the word Death a skeletal figure holding a scythe and with snakes coming out of it’s mouth. It looked disturbingly like the Dark Mark. Harry raised is eyebrow, wondering if she had had it on top waiting for him. Pansy looked at it and cringed.</p><p>“Sorry.” For once, she actually sounded like she meant it.</p><p>“But why should I help you, of all people?”</p><p>“Because it’ll help you too. You know how...interesting, shall we say, your life gets every year. Wouldn’t you like to know what’s coming your way?”</p><p>“And playing cards with you will help. Tell me you don’t take Trelawney seriously. I thought you Slytherins were supposed to clever.”</p><p>“If you paid attention Potter, you’d realize she’s almost always right. She just doesn’t always know how to interpret what she sees.”</p><p>When he didn’t buy it, she said, “I could owe you a favor?” He could tell she knew it was weak.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>“Fine. Look, I know we haven’t been nice to each other over the years, but this is our chance to bury the hatchet, you know? Wouldn’t be nice to not be at each other’s throats for a change? Why don’t you let me do a reading on you. If you still don’t trust me, I’ll leave you alone.”</p><p>She offered her hand. “Swear on my magic I’m not plotting against you.”</p><p>Harry hesitated. Trusting one of Malfoy’s friends was usually a bad idea. But even their most convoluted plans didn’t involve homework. And she <em>had</em> just sworn on her magic. And, if he was being honest with himself, he was s little curious.</p><p>What’s the worst that could happen, he thought again.</p><p>He shook her hand, not liking the resulting smirk on Parkinson’s face.</p><p>“Fantastic. <em>Now</em> will you sit down?”</p><p>They sat across from each other and Pansy started shuffling her cards. “So what do you want know? Want to know who to bet on for the world cup? Witch caught your eye? Maybe I could look into your past life.”</p><p>Harry didn’t have any questions. Well, not any was going to trust to her anyway. Even if she wasn’t planning anything at the moment didn’t mean he needed to give her ammunition either.</p><p>“Nothing, really. Can’t you just do, I don’t, something general?”</p><p>“Oh, you’re so dull, but fine. One general reading, coming up. Why don’t we see what your summer was like?”</p><p>She finished shuffling the deck and dealt out a line of three cards. She flipped the first one over, revealing an upside down foot with wings on the heels, surrounded on all sides by seven swords.</p><p>“Seven of Swords, reversed. Deception and repression. People were trying to keep things from you or bring you down and you had to overcome them. That’ll be the trial then.”</p><p>She flipped over a second card, this one bearing a bald man with and long black beard and an equally silly mustache.</p><p>“The Hierophant, the keeper of knowledge. Someone in your life has all the answers. The question is,” her deep blue eyes fixed his, “were they the ones keeping things from you?”</p><p>When Harry didn’t answer, she flipped over the final card. On it was man in pink wearing a crown and holding a curvy sword.</p><p>“The King of Swords. All sides got to speak their peace and a wise decision was made. You were let off. Not like they were ever really going to expel the Boy-Who-Lived.”</p><p>She looked up from the cards at him again. “Well? What do you think?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. She hadn’t made fun of him like he’d been expecting her too. On the contrary, he didn’t remember her ever taking anything this seriously before. But...</p><p>“I don’t know. It seems like this could all be stuff you heard before hand.”</p><p>“But that’s what the cards mean! I’m not making this up!”</p><p>“I didn’t say you were.” He didn’t even think she was, because what would be the point of that? “I don’t think you are. But, I mean, you knew about the trial. What’s to say you’re not filling in the blanks with what you already know?”</p><p>“Please, you’re not that interesting, especially now that you’ve started to sound like Granger. And ask her, if you don’t believe me. I’m sure she’s memorized the symbolism.”</p><p>Harry got up. “Thanks for the reading, but I don’t think this is going to work out.”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>He left her sulking as he went back to the castle.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had almost drifted of to sleep when his eyes shot open. Something been nagging at about his meeting with Parkinson and now he knew what. <em>“If you paid attention Potter, you’d realize she’s almost always right. She just doesn’t always know how to interpret what she sees.”</em> Isn’t that what she’d said? What if it wasn’t just true for Trelawney?</p><p>Every card she pulled was true for what happened at Grimmauld Place too. He was having things kept from him, even when he deserved to know. The Hierophant must have been Dumbledore. He was the one who always knew what was going on and Parkinson had even said he might not be telling him everything.</p><p>The King of Swords was the hardest in the interpret. What wise decision had been made when he met the Order of the Phoenix? Was it their decision to tell him some things? To not tell him everything? To not let him join the Order? There was no way to be sure. What he did know was that her words were truer than she knew.</p><p>If only he knew what to do with this information.</p>
