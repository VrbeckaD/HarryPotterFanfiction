          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry was turning various shades of red and Draco knew it wasn't good for his love's health. He looked at Harry and held up a hand to forestall the building explosion. His love might not be a Weasley, but he sure as shit had their temper!<br/>
<br/>
"Harry! I did <strong>NOT</strong> push her. She fell when I startled her. She startled because she tripped the proximity alarms on the roof and didn't expect me to pop up behind her like a Jack-in-the-box. She was <strong>ON</strong> the roof because she was trying to sneak into the house. She was trying to sneak into the house <strong>BECAUSE</strong> she had various lust and fertility potions on her person. She <strong>HAD</strong> those potions because she's a deranged fan girl that doesn't respect our marriage, or understand that <strong>NO</strong> Is a complete sentence. Now you can't be totally mad at me, seeing as how I did let the aurors know that she needed a medic too. I will <strong>NOT</strong> ignore her behavior, we have a restraining order against the horrible little git for a reason."<br/>
<br/>
Draco stopped talking and Harry just stood blinking at him before beginning to grin. "I swear, I think you said all of that without even drawing an additional breath".<br/>
<br/>
Draco's smirk would make the muggle devil himself blush. "Well, Harry. I don't remember you ever complaining about my breath control before. But if you wish, I'm sure we can find some more interesting ways to test your theory." The blonde smiled when Harry took the hand he was offering without any hesitation. And if he pulled his love towards their bedroom while whistling "Free Fallin'", he wasn't going to apologize for it. Not when Harry let out a startled laugh after all. Besides, Harry knew he had a petty streak and married him anyway. Good thing for the Malfoy Lord that Harry liked his men snarky, and just on the right side of mean.Â <br/>
