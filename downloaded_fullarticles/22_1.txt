    <p>“I never thought I would see this day,” Lips were turned into a lopsided grin as he watched none other than Harry Potter show a mark on his arm. It wasn’t the symbol of the Dark Mark, but it had a similar serpent. On the other arm, there was a deep cut that had yet to be healed.  “I could turn you in for this,” Harry snorted at the fake Alastor Moody.</p><p>“On what grounds, <em>Barty</em>? You would also give yourself away.” Harry teased back and smirked more at the comically wide eyes. Well, eye. Seeing as that the other one was a magical eye.</p><p>“Clever. I take it the Dark Lord told you.” Snorting again, Harry shook his head.</p><p>“Hardly. Figured it out all on my own, thank you very much.” Barty rose an eyebrow and gave the boy a look. “Don’t give me that look. I had it figured out months ago.”</p><p>“And you never thought to turn me in?” Barty was becoming even more interested in the boy, who gave a small shrug.</p><p>“Not really. You weren’t hurting anyone, so why would I bother?”</p><p>“I could have killed you.” Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>“Sure, but anyone could have. I could have died by the dragon in my first trial. No, you were required to make sure I made it to the graveyard and give my blood for the ritual.” Not Moody was watching him, magic eye frozen for once.  “That was the only thing I never figured out until later.” He admitted, giving another little shrug. “All I knew is that whoever wanted me in the tournament wanted me to make it to the last part.”</p><p>“I always knew there was something I liked about you.” Harry laughed at the joke and grinned at him, mischief in his green eyes. There was more to be said, but that had to wait until much later that night. Harry began to move his arm and immediately winced, biting his lips to stop the gasp of pain.</p><p>Barty paused and glanced to the deep cut- too deep if you asked him, and hastily stood up. His concerned eyes stole one last look at the cut before heading over to his cabinets and rummaging through them, eventually pulling forth a cloth and salve. He took a swig from his flask before making his way back.</p><p> “Sir?” Harry asked, looking to the container.</p><p>“Your arm needs to be cleaned, Potter. We can talk afterward. Besides,” He shot Harry an amused look. “We both know they’re bound to barge in at any moment. CONSTANT VIGILANCE and all.” Harry snorted, giving a nod.</p><p>“Point taken. Dumbledore has a tendency to march in at the last moment. Thank Merlin you’re not actively trying to kill me. I’d probably be dead by now.” He was pulling his other sleeve down, hiding away the new mark on his arm. “How did you manage to turn the trophy into a portkey, by the way? Won’t they suspect you?” Harry asked, recalling that someone mentioned ‘Alastor’ was the one responsible for hiding the trophy a few weeks ago.</p><p>“A simple imperious curse. I managed to convince the judges that someone else should place the cup in the center of the maze. All I had to do was make it into a portkey. They won’t suspect me now.” Harry grinned at that; eyes bright.</p><p>“Something tells me you were either a Ravenclaw or a Slytherin.” Not Moody laughed wholeheartedly as he began to soak the cloth in a liquid substance.</p><p>“Ravenclaw, actually. You know, most people assume I was a Slytherin because I was a Death Eater.” Harry snorted and rolled his eyes.</p><p>“How about a Gryffindor as a Death Eater now?” Harry teased as he held out his arm, gasping at the sting. It reminded him of peroxide. “Is that a muggle product?” He asked before Barty could respond to his other statement.</p><p>“What gave it away?” Barty was curious despite his sarcastic tone. He was too busy dabbing the wound to notice the flinch and blank look that crossed Harry’s face, but he did feel the other man tense. Barty stole a glance, catching onto the distant look. “Harry?” It snapped the younger wizard out of his trance, who quickly tried to regain control.</p><p>“Uh, it’s not really that important.” He would have let it drop, but there was something that was nagging him about it. Something he couldn’t quite place. As soon as he went to question him again, his door was flung open by Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall.</p><p>“Harry! Are you all right?” Dumbledore asked, marching into the middle of the room.</p><p>“I’m fine, sir,” Harry spoke in a soft tone, arm still outstretched as Not Moody cleaned his injury.</p><p>“Alastor?” Dumbledore put his eyes on him now. There was a slight suspicion to them, but it seemed to be slowly ebbing away.</p><p>“I keep extra Star grass solve in my cabinets. I figured I would be just as efficient as Madam Pomphrey would. Potter needs to relax and I’m not sure he’ll be able to with Diggory a few feet away from him.”</p><p>There was a somber look on Dumbledore’s face at that. Cedric was in the infirmary right now, resting after the strain of tonight’s events. He gave a nod as if he were pleased with that answer.</p><p>“Yes, that’s quite understandable….” Something different flashed through Dumbledore’s eyes. “Harry, can you tell us what happened?” Harry sighed, wanting nothing more than for them to leave. He had already told them what had happened, but he figured they were still suspicious about the entire thing.</p><p>“It’s like I told everyone before, Headmaster. Voldemort is back. The trophy was a portkey and it teleported us to a Graveyard, where Pettigrew was waiting. He attacked Cedric by knocking him out with a spell I had never heard before, then he bound me and used my blood in a ritual to bring back Voldemort.” Harry explained, rubbing his temples tiredly, putting on a show for them. “We dueled but I was able to escape by using the summoning charm on Cedric and the cup.”</p><p>“Is that all?” Knowing not to look into his eyes, Harry looked down and nodded, feigning tiredness,</p><p>“Yes, that’s all. I’d rather not think about it anymore.” He said in a small tone, getting the professor to back off.</p><p>“Thank you for your time, Harry. I’m sorry you had to deal with this.” Dumbledore was looking back to Alastor, frowning. “Do you have any idea who was in charge of putting the trophy in the maze? I know you weren’t able to.”</p><p>“I’ve no idea, Albus.” Not Alastor sighed, putting up a great façade of being distraught. “Had I known this would have happened, I would have canceled my appointment and placed the trophy there myself. The judges are the only ones who know.” He explained, becoming frustrated. “Death Eater scum! If I ever find out who-“</p><p>“That’s alright, Alastor. You had no way of knowing.” Dumbledore calmly rose a hand to stop the tirade from continuing. “We will find out who did this soon enough.” He turned back to Harry, a twinkle in his eyes. “Come to my office if you ever need to talk to me, my boy. My door is always open for you.” Harry unconsciously shifted closer to Barty, who had a protective hand around his arm. “Goodnight,” He called, leaving with the other two professors. Snape seemed to hesitate in the doorway, sparing a glance at the two. Not long after that, he left as well.</p><p> “Can you cast a few wards so they can’t do that again?” Harry huffed quietly, casting his own privacy charm around them in precaution. Barty smirked, waving his wand a few times and mumbling something Harry didn’t understand.</p><p>“A little anxious, aren’t we?” He teased the younger who rolled his eyes again.</p><p>“When it involves Dumbledore, yes,” Harry mumbled, giving his full attention to the other man. “How long until you change back? I wouldn’t mind talking to the real you.” Smirking more, Barty leaned back.</p><p>“Lucky for you, I’ve created a spell that ends Polyjuice potions. It can’t be used on someone, though. It has to the used by the person who is Polyjuiced.” He explained, raising an eyebrow at the way the younger wizard seemed to light up.</p><p>“That’s bloody brilliant! Have you created more spells besides that one?” Harry was on the edge of his seat, forgetting that Barty was still cleaning his arm. “What?” He asked as the other man seemed to laugh.</p><p>“Merlin, Potter. You’re reminding me of myself when I was your age.” He chuckled again. “More so now that you have that lovely symbol on your arm.” Barty snickered, but soon waved his wand and allowed for the Polyjuice potion to end. The only thing that made Harry wince was when he ripped the fake eye out.</p><p>“Does that hurt?” He questioned, looking towards the twitching eye on the table.</p><p>“Horribly,” Barty admitted, running a hand through his natural hair and fixing it up a bit. Soon, he was back to tending Harry’s arm. “Alright. I’m going to add the salve next, okay? It’s gonna sting worse than the other did at first, but it’ll heal in no time.” Barty summoned the salve and opened the jar, gently applying it to the deep injury. Harry was expecting a horrible sting, but none came. Instead, there was a slight tingling sensation.</p><p>“I thought you said it was gonna sting?” Harry asked, brows furrowed. Barty paused at that, his own rising in surprise.</p><p>“It doesn’t hurt?” He seemed interested in this answer, surprised at what the other was telling him.</p><p>“Not really. It just sort of tingles, I suppose.” Harry admitted, not thinking much of it. “It’s kind of refreshing, actually.” Harry found himself relaxing as Barty applied the rest of the salve, watching as the cut completely vanish. “Man, I love magic.” The older wizard laughed at the reaction, despite still being curious as to how the salve didn’t burn like it usually did.</p><p>“So," Barty began to pull his hand away, crossing his arms as he met the green eyes in front of him. “What are you going to do now, Potter? What does the dark lord have you doing? And, why did you take it?” Grinning at all the questions, Harry hummed.</p><p>“Continuing on as normal for now. He didn’t mark me as a follower.” He pulled up his sleeve, revealing the serpent. “Voldemort has the same mark on his arm.” Interested by that information, Barty leaned forward.</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>“Apparently, Dumbledore kept some family secrets hidden from me,” Harry explained. “My mother, while Voldemort didn’t know it at the time, was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin as well, from a squib. It’s part of the reason I can talk to snakes and share a connection with the Voldemort.”</p><p>“And the other reason?” Barty questioned.</p><p>“It’s not as common anymore, from what he told me, but wizards of the same blood used to be able to communicate through a telepathic link. It’s why I had dreams of you meeting with him before the tournament. It’s the reason the killing curse backfired and killed him instead.”</p><p>“But why wouldn’t it have backfired when he killed your mother? She was of the same blood.”</p><p>“When she sacrificed herself for me, it essentially made a barrier that would redirect the killing curse. She used ancient magic in doing so.” Harry explained.</p><p>“That does sound like ancient magic.” Barty mused, drumming his fingers of the arms of the chairs. “What made you want to go against Dumbledore? I pegged you as one of his mindless followers.” Harry smirked at that, leaning forward.</p><p>“Did an awfully good job at faking that, didn’t I?” Barty couldn’t stop the cackle that escaped. “I had Remus Lupin help me with Occlumency last year, which was when I began to sincerely doubt him.”</p><p>“Occlumency?” Barty composed himself quickly. “That’s not an easy thing to master- and you tell me you did it at the age of fourteen?”</p><p>“Also managed to form a corporeal Patronus at that age too.” Again, Barty laughed.</p><p>“You just became even more interesting, Harry Potter.”</p>
