    <p>The Morning House Ch. 1</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">July 30, 1986</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius shrunk the last of Harry’s birthday presents and tucked them into his pocket. Even made the size of dice, they created a bulge in the fabric the size of his fist. He had forgotten the charm that could reveal a package’s contents without breaking the packaging, and he had also forgotten what all but the most recently purchased gifts contained. He loved buying things for Harry, and he always started making impulsive purchases some time shortly after Christmas, concluding in the few days before he </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Portkeyed</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> to the U.S. His displays of excess never failed to delight Har</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">ry nor to elicit exasperation from</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> Lily. Fond exasperation, though, he was </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">fairly</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> sure.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">He spent an extra moment brushing his fingertips against a certain long, rectangular package. There had been one gift that had made him think with such particular pain about James,</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">he couldn’t forget which one it was and what it contained. Reminders of James, and what Sirius lost when he died, still left him breathless, and after nearly five years of waiting for that feeling to pass, Sirius had resigned himself to its permanence. While the days leading up to visiting Lily and Harry bore a direct correlation to a spike in moments like this one, the longer periods of joy more than made up for it.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">This year, Sirius</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> hadn’t been invited for the week leading up to Harry’s birth</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">day, and he had suspicions as to</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> the reason. Which was why he had taken it upon himself to arrive early, even though it surely meant Lily would take him to task.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">One of the pleasanter side effects of bearing the title of Lord Black was that upon filling out a more or less painless paper form, at least one week in advance, his pile of gold in </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Gringott’s</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> became infinitesimally smaller and a Ministry barn owl delivered a carefully packaged international Portkey directly to Sirius’s window. If he kept office hours at the Ministry like his grandfather had, he might have had it even faster. But Sirius avoided the ancestral office </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">with such dedication</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> as to </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">have</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> never set foot there since the chair behind the polished desk was occupied by his own father. </span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius gingerly removed the packaging from the Portkey without making skin</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">-</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">to</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">-</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">skin contact, cast a spell Lily had taught him to be sure the magic had been safely and correctly applied, and checked his pockets a final time to ensure he hadn’t forgotten a crucial bit of luggage. </span>
  </span>
</p><p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Bracing himself for the sensation of a long-distance Portkey, Sirius reached out and seized the empty plastic water </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">bottle, and</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> was swept through time and space</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">.</span></span> He landed<span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> neatly on his feet, taking a few steading steps as he looked around </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">at </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">a </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">commercial </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">street that would have been distinctly Muggle-looking if it weren’t for the animated figures on </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">the </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">wooden-painted signs along the rows of buildings, and the odd tricorn hat among the persons milling about on the sidewalk.</span></span></p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius never missed Harry’s birthday, and Lily had relocated around the States a time or two, so he wasn’t totally unaccustomed to landing in a foreign Yankee wizarding district </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">and not knowing where to go. </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">It still made him uncomfortable, and while Lily, painfully punctual creature that she was, never let him loiter long when he kept to their prior arrangements, she wouldn’t expect him until the following morning.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">So</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> Sirius stepped alone out of the </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Porkey</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> point and dropped the bottle in the bin stationed alongside it for that purpose, and quickly removed his cloak and folded it over his arm. It was hot here, a heat that had a quality that made his skin prickle with memory, and suddenly Sirius knew where he was.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Bibbleville</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">, the nonsensically named district nearest Taos, but nearer Mexico. Sirius was delighted to recognize it. It meant tracking Lily down would be much easier, since nearly the only explanation was that she was at the Pueblo. She couldn’t be this near that original home of hers in MACUSA, he didn’t think, and not be back at the Pueblo. It had too strong a draw.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Only a few uncomfortable minutes later, Sirius approached a shopkeeper to ask about getting to Taos Pueblo, and with that singularly American gregariousness, the shopkeeper (“oh, call me Samuel”) had arranged for Siri</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">us (“may I call </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">ya</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> Sirius? What a name!”) to have a Muggle taxi driven by a Squib (“puts you at ease when you don’t have to worry ‘bout slipping up, don’t it?”) meet him at the boundary of </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Bibbleville</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> and take him directly to the Pueblo (“tell the docs hello from Samuel!”).</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius felt almost relaxed, waiting in the hot sunshine for the taxi without stepping through the crackling air that gave away the presence of wards to any magical person. They weren’t something you would see in Britain, where Muggle repelling charms were usually enough, considering wizarding space was used for most wizarding districts, neighborhoods and homes. But there was so much </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s3">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">space </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">out here in the American southwest that it was easier to share with the Muggle world, using wards that would curtain the wizarding areas under the guise of more of the vast empty landscape, while gently but firmly deterring sustained interest or a desire to trespass.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">No Muggles were about—a narrow blacktop highway stretched from one horizon to the next, with no sign of habitation or a vehicle in sight—but Sirius preferred to stay inside the wards, anyway, until a bright yellow sedan appeared, some part of its inner workings emitting a sharp wheeze, and came to a stop. A woman with a shiny, dark brown ponytail and coffee-colored skin leaned out the window, looking around as though she knew someone was there and did not expect to actually see them, but wasn’t too concerned about it. Squibs were often easy to pick out.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius stepped through the wards, and the woman smiled in a businesslike manner at his sudden appearance.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“One way to the Pueblo?” she asked, and when Sirius gave a confirming nod, she got out of the taxi and opened the rear door after a brief struggle with the handle. “Sticks sometimes,” she explained to Sirius. “Hop in!”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">The wheeze was duller but also more apparent as Sirius slid into the backseat.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“AC has been fussy,” said the driver, whatever that meant. “I’m Carla. Sam says you’re an out-of-towner,” she added, with an exaggerated wink in the rearview mirror. The inside of the vehicle was close and almost unbearably hot. Sirius’s hand brushed the metal buckle of one half of the safety restraint, and he swore.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Sorry </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">bout</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> that,” said the driver, and they started off.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">It was well known that Muggle machines could misbehave when exposed to magic, so Sirius sat still and dug his fingers into his thighs to restrain the strong urge he had to cast a cooling charm out of habit. He pulled the collar of his shirt away from his neck and breathed in and out slowly through his nose, the way his instructor had told him to during a mind healing session about meditation. He hadn’t gone back for a second lesson, though, and had never practiced, so the skill was underdeveloped and rusty to boot.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“How far is it to the Pueblo?” Sirius asked, thinking he might rather not know.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“About an hour,” said the driver. Sirius let his head fall back against the seat with an audible thump.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">One hour and fifteen minutes later, Sirius all but tumbled out of the Muggle car and cast a drying and cooling charm on himself so enthusiastically that a glaze of ice appeared briefly across his knuckles on his wand hand.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Carla was stepping out of the vehicle, too, and squinting at the Pueblo. “You’ll want to go to the gift shop, I expect, and see where the docs are. There’s always someone in there, even in the middle of the afternoon.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius thanked her and settled up, then hiked up toward the gift shop, a homely modern building in contrast to the Pueblo itself. He felt completely disgusting. Even magic couldn’t fully erase the effects of being trapped in a hot car like the victim of a particularly inhumane kidnapping. He vowed to arrange for alternative travel on the return trip.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">He was shaping the next step of his plan in his mind as he reached for the glass door, which the sun was hitting in such a way as to make it reflective instead of transparent. Due to the distraction and the behavior of the sunlight, Sirius didn’t see the person coming out until they were bumping into one another, both seizing the other’s forearm for balance.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">A distinct smell of parchment and mint and sandalwood assailed him so that, as sure as when he was a dog, he knew who he would see even before he blinked and focused.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Moony,” Sirius murmured. A smile so wide his jaw cracked came to his face before he could contain himself. His eyes roved over the man in front of him, feeling the ever-spare flesh of Remus’s arm under a ratty sleeve, seeing those golden-brown eyes up close, unchanged by the past four years, while there were new lines and faint scars on </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">his cheeks and a new strain around his mouth. The sight of these signs of hardship almost banished Sirius’s smile, but not quite.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Sirius,” Remus said calmly, extricating himself from Sirius’s grasp. “I thought you were coming tomorrow.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“I know that’s what you thought, which is why I came today.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus tried to look annoyed, but his mouth was twitching. “I know Lily didn’t tell you, but I should have known she wouldn’t have to.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“I’ve come for a week the past three years,” Sirius said, by way of agreement. “What else could the snub mean? Certainly not that I was unwanted.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus glanced at him quickly at the last word. “Certainly not,” he said, soft and much too serious.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“This is more of </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Padfoot’s</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> luck, I think,” Sirius said, still grinning like an idiot and starting to sweat again, but he didn’t care. “I thought it might take me all day to find Lily and then sniff you out, but here we are. Forget to buy Harry a present, did you?”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus winced, and Sirius cursed himself. Any reference to money or expenditure was fatal around Remus. Then he cursed Remus a bit, too. His silliness on this subject would never make sense to Sirius, but he had a new strategy where Remus was concerned, in the hope that they would not erupt into one of their protracted, festering rows. He would not enter into an argument on the subject of Sirius’s unearned fortune which he could never hope to spend no matter how freely he shared it, or Remus’s unearned destitution which he could never hope to satisfactorily remedy in a world that feared his wolf. </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Certainly</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> Sirius would not mention—directly, anyway—the logical solution to their complimentary problems. The last time he had, they hadn’t spoken for a year, and only now was Remus consistently returning his letters.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Lily asked me to drop something by the shop,” Remus said, after a long hesitation. Then, at last, he smiled. Requiring no further encouragement, Sirius’s grin returned at its maximum intensity, and Remus blinked and glanced over his shoulder, as though Sirius, like the sun, could not be regarded directly.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“I’ll walk you up to the house, then,” Remus said, his reserve intact. “Harry will be pleased.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Sirius turned back toward the house, feeling a contented warmth, the way he only did (any more) with Remus, the way he hadn’t, consistently, since school. He tried not to think about it too much. It was a Marauder feeling, and as such, reflecting upon it had an equal power to bring happiness or pain. </span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“How is our little Potter?” Sirius murmured, matching Remus’s longer stride with the ease of muscle memory. The sun was on their backs now, and hot enough to make him want to swear.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus noticed Sirius’s wince, and his reluctant little grin made another brief appearance. “Too hot for you, Black?”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Not all of us have a skewed thermo-neutral zone, Lupin,” Sirius said, but resented the heat a little less when he noted that Remus was wearing a light linen shirt, folded back a bit at the wrists. Clearly the climate suited him as most of Britain, and certainly Scotland, never had. He even had a bit of a tan on his neck, proof he’d voluntarily gone outside uncovered. He looked good, now that Sirius had adjusted to the subtle indicators of stress that hadn’t been there the last time they’d been together. “Look at you, though, you’re practically a local. We tourists will at least be in short sleeves as soon as we settle in.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus snorted. “Harry is well,” he said, deigning to address Sirius’s original question. “He’s a proper terror,” he added, and suddenly he was smiling for real, though it was gone again in a moment.</span>
  </span>
</p><p> <span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">“Anything else would be an enormous disappointment,” Sirius said. </span></span></p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">They were at the house now, mounting the steps, when the door suddenly flew open. A small version of James Potter with bright green eyes stood in the doorway, hair pasted to the side of his head on the right </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s4">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">side</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> and standing on end on the left. He pointed a stick at Remus and cried, “</span>
  </span>
  <em><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Stillio</span></span> <span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">totalo</span></span></em>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">!” Remus obediently froze. Then Harry noticed Sirius.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“I think the incantation you’re looking for is </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s3">
      <span class="bumpedFont15">petrificus </span>
    </span>
    <span class="s3">
      <span class="bumpedFont15">totalus</span>
    </span>
  </em>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">,” Sirius said.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Harry grinned and dropped his stick, then hurtled into Sirius’s knees. </span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Remus smiled down at </span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Harry,</span>
  </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15"> and Sirius took in the sight for a moment before bending down to give the boy a tight hug.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Terrible habit, dropping your wand,” said Remus, picking up the stick. “Now how will you block my hex?” He gave the stick an artful twirl and then assumed a dueler’s stance and pointed it at Harry, still smiling.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Harry squirmed in Sirius’s arms and then turned his head to smile smugly at Remus. “Uncle Sirius will protect me.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Their eyes met over Harry’s head, and Remus’s smile faded slowly from something sincere to something sad. “That’s right, Harry. Don’t forget it.” He ducked his head and went into the house, leaving Harry and Sirius alone on the step.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">Harry craned his head up to look into Sirius’s face, obviously contented. “How many presents?” he asked hopefully.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Dozens,” Sirius assured him. “Let’s go inside, shall we? You and your mother live in the hottest place on Earth, I’m fairly sure.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“The hottest place on Earth is Death Valley,” said Harry, and for a moment he w</span>
  </span>
  <a name="_GoBack" rel="nofollow" id="_GoBack"></a>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">as entirely Lily’s son. Then he added, “Mom made me go. It was boring.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">James’s son, too, though. Sirius ruffled his hair and swept him up under his arm, making him squeal.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <span class="bumpedFont15">“Let’s go say hello to your mum, then, shall we?”</span>
  </span>
