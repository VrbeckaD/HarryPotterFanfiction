    <p>    Ever since I was young I was treated as a Malfoy, people knew my name since I was one of the first females of the pure bloodline. My grandfather was first upset about the news wanting them to try again so they would keep the name, but then saw this as an opportunity to make headlines about my gender. I was treated as almost famous in the wizard world, and my father Draco, I believe always had a little pride in it since he wanted to be known when he was a kid. I didn't believe I was not meant to be a Malfoy since at a young age because I knew who they supported, and since I didn't have the blinding blonde hair. I do have to say its a bit of an exaggeration when they say I don't look like any of them because I look like my mom and dad together, brown hair from my mom and blue eyes from my dad.</p><p>   When I was a kid they always had me stand next to them for hours while reporters took pictures of me, and asked me questions about the Weasley and Potter kids. I never hated them as much as my relatives did but the newspapers always made it seem like that, twisting my words. I was always admitted into the best elementary schools before Hogwarts, which I found a bit odd since I was still young.</p><p>   The break before my first year at Hogwarts Draco allowed me to go alone to shop for the items I needed on the list, he gave me more than enough galleons in a pouch. Once I got my uniform clothes, the books, and most of the equipment, my last stop was Olivander's Wand shop. When I was walking down I saw the nimbus 2013 I marveled how up to date it was compared to the last one, looking in on how fast it goes since you cant really update the outside even though it did look sleek. My father wanted me to get one but it would be put to no use since I can't use it my first year. I finally arrived at the dusty shop and my eyes scurried around with a mild disgusted look, I ran my finger along the dusty furniture in the seemly empty store. </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>"A Malfoy" I turned around in shock, it was a grey haired old man "I assumed since no one taught you the manners not to touch."</p>
  <p>"Olivander, I assume since no one taught you how to clean." I look up at the man with a changeling stare, he begins to chuckle.</p>
  <p>"Touché, I didn't believe it was true. You really don't look anything like your father more your mother, should I really even call you Malfoy?" He reaches out to grab my hand and I politely say my name and he responds with " I know, the Daily Prophet couldn't stop talking about you, I remember when your father first came. He was with his dad and he wouldn't even let him pick out a wand."</p>
  <p>"My father is somewhat not like his dad, he trusts me a little more to make decisions plus he had a meeting I didn't want to attend."</p>
  <p>"Well, let's get too it!" He exclaims like it was his first time doing it, you can tell he enjoys this job seeing how the kids would grow up it can also be disappointing. He tried a bunch out it seemed like 30 mins already went by and I was getting frustrated, he saw this and said he would be right back. He came out with a black box in terrible condition like it was in there for ages. "Try this one" he opens the box to a chipped wand inside.</p>
  <p>"I don't think my father would want me to come home with a hand me down wand or one that looks like it" I exclaim in clear annoyance. "at least give me a reason why this wand is still here if it was clearly someone's already."</p>
  <p>"um..well you see this wand wasn't anyone's" He looks down a little shy with a nervous chuckle " I always tried to use it but every time I would, it chips..."</p>
  <p>"Why would you want to use a wand that doesn't fit you, or why would you make a wand like that?" I ask in confusion.</p>
  <p>"Its because I didn't make the wand, someone else did I guess I should give you some background. You know the story of the Deathly Hallows?' I nod it was a story you had to learn when we were younger since Voldemort. ' You know the story of the elder wand-' I was about it ask it if was the elder wand but he began talking before I could make a sound. 'No, its not the elder wand it was destroyed, it was a different wand one that Death created to make it balanced, there could be no such thing as the most powerful wand and Death knew it. He had to make a counter one from the same tree, an opposite one, the <strong>boxelder</strong> wand."</p>
  <p>"Boxelder? You mean cheap wood' I begin to scoff ' and wouldn't someone have to know? And how did you get it before any other wand store an-"</p>
  <p>"Let me finish, you're right it isn't a pricey tree maybe that's why it chips, but it does have elder wood in it and its leaves. The leaves are known to be toxic so Death had to hide it so no one would know, what he created was the boxelder coating on it so it would look like a cheap wand. It's said that it wouldn't fit anyone so the elder wand would be the most powerful but it would match its power with a counter attack if used by the right wizard for it. The reason no one new of this wand was because people wanted to believe magic could be like that without any flaws to be that powerful, but magic always has to be balanced....How I got this wand was an accident, I came across it when creating one of my wands 70 years ago it hit me on the noggin and it came with a brief note about it. I showed Dumbledore and he got the truth he said to keep it hidden so no one else could get, he said it could fall into the wrong hands." </p>
</blockquote><p>  At this information I scoffed, obliviously Dumbledore wanted to keep it secret so he could be the one with the most powerful wand. I also understood where he was coming from maybe he really didn't want it falling into the wrong hands or maybe even good hands so no one could be a target. </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>" If no one can use this wand why do you think I can, and don't you think its dangerous for me to have it?" I ask still skeptical.</p>
  <p>"I feel this energy from the wand that I have been trying to avoid, it is dangerous but I sense you will do great things with this wand. You are not like your relatives, no matter how hard they try to make you embrace it...you could change the Malfoy's image I'm assuming like your father wanted to deep down inside." Those words now that I think about it, was maybe what I need to get me ready for Hogwarts. So I sacked up and grabs the old damn thing, and all the chip's started to disappear and it felt like mine an I didn't even have to use it. "Do great things Rebecca, and remember a wand is only as powerful as its holder. Good Luck on your first day of Hogwarts, I would test that thing out before hand."</p>
</blockquote><p>    He didn't want me to pay for the wand but I left him enough galleons to get this place cleaned up on the table, once I left the store with this information I felt like everyone was already watching me. My dad was furious that I didn't get the wand from his tree every Malfoy gets and he went down with my Grandfather as I stayed in my room getting a better look at it. It was a pitch black wand like my fathers it had a plain top half of the stick, but where the top half meets the handle there was a tight swirl. At the end of the wand there was a sort of sphere/cylinder with one side blank and the with some sort of writing in a smaller circle design that you could see from the flat end. Once I got the new wand it was definitely stronger than my trainer one, I realized that I would have a little more experience than new comers since I was raised with magic and also taught in secret.</p><p>   The news spread fast, once my grandfather got the truth out of Olivander he spread it like wildfire gloating about it choosing me. I felt so bad I had my owl send a note and money asking if he wanted it back, overall he said he knew it was going to happened and to keep the wand so I did. My father came with me to Platform 9 3/4 to help me get loaded on the train, when he were walking we heard laughter and pictures in front of us. Of course it was for the golden trio and their kids, you could tell which one was a Wealsey by the hair and eye color. Her name was Chloe, and her friend on the right was Aubrey Potter the oldest of the potter bloodline since they recently had another kid. Aubrey changed over the break and decide to get blonde hair almost like my fathers, she could probably pass more of a Malfoy then me. My dad sent a scowl towards them and got on in return, when I looked down I found Aubrey looking at me with the same look I ignored it when we headed on the train.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>"Bloody Potters, they always have the Prophet up there ass asking questions. They should be asking you, you are the one with the most powerful wand since they destroyed the other one." I look at him as I clearly see jealousy in his eyes.</p>
  <p>"Most people didn't believe us dad, because they still believe that its not possible. They think you guys just said it to get more attention, and everyone is making it a big deal since its the first kids that go to Hogwarts from them." I can tell he considered it for a quick second before he put up is signature scowl again.</p>
  <p>"It's your first year too, and that a pretty big deal for me and should be for them as well. C'mon I'll take your bags, you go find a seat next to Goyle and Crabbe" I really hate sitting next to dufus 1 and dufus 2, I hug my father and a photo snaps. Another news paper took a picture of us, then I see a smile from my dad. I walk to the train and turn my back looking to see my dad one last time, but instead I see him take the photo from the camera to put it in his wallet. That's the dad I know not putting up a front, I just wish people would see that not just me. I zoned out of what Bumper was saying and Donald too as I stare at the window then Bumper tapped me on the shoulder. </p>
  <p>"Is it true? About your wand?" </p>
  <p>"Yeah, you think my family would lie? If so tell me now, then I'll show you how powerful this wand is." Bumper looks down and Donald smiles.</p>
  <p>"Sorry, but one more question if its the opposite of the elder wand doesn't it mean its the worse wand?" Bumper mumbles, I didn't realize this before but maybe it was?</p>
  <p>"I hope not, I mean if it was supposed to counter the effects of the Elder wander I don't think so."</p>
</blockquote><p>~~~~~~</p><p>   Once the train stops we get on the boats to Hogwarts, I was again stuck with Goyle and Crabbe even on the carriages, finally we went into the Great hall to get sorted. I didn't even need to do the hat I knew I was a Slytherin not because of my family either, most traits are similar to me unfortunately. When Headmaster McGonagall finally called my name, I walked up in a fast pace to speed up the process so once I got under the old thing I could go to my table. </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>"Malfoy? Oh, so different from the past ones, a female in the bloodline. Maybe explains why you got the Boxelder wand or maybe something completely different. I assure you will find out later once you see what your meant to do, notice that's a powerful wand you have if you are a great wizard in that case.' People gasp as their questions have been answered but a question popped in my head from what the hat blabbered ' You already know what house you are in, so just go join them." I jump out of the chair as the room falls silent everyone was looking at me including Chloe Weasley with the same expression of confusion. I was treated different a little harsher than most and some even scared that I possessed such a power, I kinda liked it since people treated me with more authority. A week into settling in I see my father yelling at McGonagall and I begin to hide He wants me to become a seeker, she said uneasily I can after my broom lesson but that didn't make her stop. She still wanted to include that I will not be able to buy myself into the team if I don't make it, and stated very obviously that the last 1st year quittage player was Harry Potter. He walked off a little tense with that answer in a pretty fast pace and I followed with a faster speed, while everyone was in class.</p>
  <p>"Dad why do you want me to become Harry Potter so bad." I say as I'm close behind, he stops dead in his tracks as I bump into him. He turns around in such a blind rage, I back up a little bit causing me to bite my lip.</p>
  <p>"What did you say?" He says trying to calm himself down, I open my mouth. "THE last thing I want you to become is anything near POTTER! The only thing I want you to do is be better than him." He turned around harshly, as I stayed put thinking about how much pressure I'll get from my dad at Hogwarts.</p>
