    <p>Percy Weasley is fourteen when he realises that he enjoys looking at other boys. One of his dormmates in particular. </p><p>He does feel a bit guilty about it. </p><p>'As long as you don't act on it, everything is fine,' he tells himself every time he goes out of his way to be in the same space as Oliver Wood. </p><p> </p><p>... </p><p> </p><p>Percy Weasley is fifteen when he finds out he has been appointed a prefect. </p><p>It's a very convenient excuse to finally show up for quidditch matches. </p><p>Oliver Wood becomes the quidditch team captain. </p><p>They start talking more about things that aren't homework. Students going to practice during study time or representing Gryffindor properly in important school events. </p><p> </p><p>... </p><p> </p><p>Percy Weasley is sixteen when he finds out Oliver Wood likes him too.</p><p>The quidditch captain gets drunk during a party after a successful game against Slytherin and tries kissing him in their dorm. Percy pushes him away gently with his hands. </p><p>'He's drunk, he's not thinking clearly,' he tells himself as he opens his history of magic textbook again.</p><p> </p><p>A few days after Oliver finds the prefect on the grounds near the castle, reading a book. </p><p>Percy looks up when he hears someone approaching him. </p><p>Oliver sits next to him. The prefect stares at him for a few more seconds and his eyes turn back to the book. </p><p>"I'm sorry," Wood finally blurts out. </p><p>"For what exactly?" </p><p>"For what happened on Saturday. I shouldn't have done it."</p><p>"I didn't mind," Percy said, still looking at the book. </p><p>"You pushed me away, I clearly crossed a boundary." </p><p>"I pushed you away because you were drunk."</p><p>Oliver stares at him. Percy knows, even if he doesn't look up to see it.</p><p>"So you...?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>They sit in awkward silence for maybe twenty seconds when Oliver speaks again. </p><p>"Would you want to try...?" </p><p>"What, a relationship?" </p><p>"Yes." </p><p>"I'd love to," Percy says, smiles at Wood and subtly grabs his hand. </p><p> </p><p>Percy comes to watch quidditch practice. He loves how passionate Oliver is about good strategy and winning the games. Even if they don't have a chance against Ravenclaw this year, he keeps the team's morale high.</p><p>Oliver kisses him for the first time when they meet under the stands after quidditch practice. It's Percy's first kiss, but he doesn't say a word about it. He isn't sure how he feels about kissing overall, but he enjoys being this close to Oliver, so even if his preferred way of showing affection is far from this, he doesn't mind Wood's warm and wet lips on his own.  </p><p>Oliver gets injured during quidditch practice and matches a lot, and even though the injuries are never all that serious, Percy is always worried and can't sleep whenever Wood is spending the night in the hospital wing. </p><p>Oliver starts coming to the library with Percy. He enjoys watching the prefect study and he even manages to do more of his studying that way. </p><p>He tries to comfort Percy when he's worried about his little sister and he lets him cry on his shoulder when she turns out to be one of the petrified students. Percy has to tell his parents and when he's too tired and shocked by all of this, Oliver offers to write the letter for him if he tells him what to write.</p><p> </p><p>When the holidays come, they agree to write to each other and at least go shopping together in the Diagon Alley - Percy knows Oliver has a busy summer planned ahead and Oliver is well aware of the Weasleys' financial situation and he wouldn't want to make Percy use any more floo powder than necessary. They exchange some short letters and end up meeting twice before going to Diagon Alley. </p>
