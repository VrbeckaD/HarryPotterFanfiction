  <em> <strong>Decisions</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>It all began one day in September 1944, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In the Slytherin Common Room, a small cluster of boys sat near the fireplace and talked about what their plans for their future were. In the middle of their group sat their uncontested leader, 17-year old Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr., better known to his friends as Marvolo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are your plans after getting your NEWTS?”, Abraxas Malfoy asked his friends. His platinum blond hair was gleaming in the semi-darkness of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Cygnus and I will be introduced to the Wizengamot, and replace our father during the summer session”, Orion Black explained.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Marvolo, what are your plans for the future?”, Abraxas - one of the two other young men in their group asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I haven't any plans finalized, yet. Why do you ask, Abraxas?” Marvolo replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I have spoken with my father about you”, Abraxas responded. “He was enraged that the old coot continues to send you back to those disgusting muggles.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There is nothing that you can do about it. Nobody cares what the old coot does. They all think the sun shines out of his arse”, Marvolo replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But you are the heir of Slytherin!”, Abraxas insisted. “I've got an idea. At the next Hogsmeade weekend, we should go to Gringotts and get the goblins to give you an inheritance test.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Headmaster would never let us go”, Marvolo pointed out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are correct. However, Slughorn never says no to you, Marvolo”, Abraxas reassured his friend. “It is him that I suggest we approach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Perhaps that is true, and really what do I have to lose?”, asked Marvolo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nothing, my friend, but you have so much to gain”, Abraxas replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<span>Have I already informed you all that I will be bonded to Walburga on my 21</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> birthday?”, Orion asked. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, but why are you waiting so long to bond?”, Marvolo responded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Our father thinks that it is better to wait as we have to secure our social standing first, along with deciding who will take over which company”, Orion replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That makes sense and what about you Cygnus?”, Marvolo asked. “With whom have you decided to bond?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will be bonded to Druella, when I turn 21. Besides what Orion said, it's practically tradition in our family that the males wait for four years after reaching their maturity before getting married”, said Cygnus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That is better than behaving like a reckless Gryffindor rushing into things”, Abraxas said thoughtfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hear, hear!”, agreed the other boys.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And you Marvolo, do you have a sweetheart?”, Orion inquired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is… complicated”, Marvolo began. “There is a girl I like, but her parents would never agree to the match as long as I have nothing to my name. As you are aware, I am only a half-blood, even if I'm the heir of Slytherin. Currently, I have no means with which to support a family.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But if you had the funds, which girl has caught your fancy?”, nagged Orion smirking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Eileen Aurora Prince”, Marvolo replied, with a smirk of his own. “She is my light on the darkest of nights.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, she definitely suits you, but the Prince heiress will be difficult to capture” Orion replied seriously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know, let's wait to see what my visit at Gringotts will show, before trying to capture a dream”, Marvolo decided realistically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Augustus Severus Septimus Prince is not an easy man, but I am sure you will be able to convince him that you are the best choice of suitor for his daughter. I have no doubts about that”, said Abraxas in a nonchalant manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Have you seen any of the Lestrange Triplets?” Orion ask suddenly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I haven't seen them since DADA, why do you ask, Orion?” Marvolo inquired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's just strange that they are not here. They are usually the first to reach the common room after the end of the afternoon lessons”, Orion replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe they had an important meeting with Professor Slughorn”, suggested Marvolo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You really think that there is nothing else?” asked Orion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What else could it be? Not even the brashest of Gryffindors would be stupid enough to harass one of them”, Marvolo said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s true, for they are very good duellists”, agreed Abraxas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, Helix, Dextro and Nucleus Lestrange all know how to wipe the floor with their opponents.”, smirked Cygnus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But they weren't so very fortunate with their names”, Marvolo chuckled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, alas that is to be expected, the Lestrange Matriarch was always abnormal even by the usual Pureblood standards”, admitted Abraxas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then why did she bond at all?” Marvolo asked. “If I understood the facts correctly Ajax Lestrange owed a life debt to the Rosiers, which would result in a marriage contract to an unborn daughter. They claimed that Lionel Rosier saved Ajax from a rogue werewolf. That he killed the werewolf, before the werewolf could injure Ajax.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The clock sounds 10 times, interrupting their conversation. Tom Riddle Jr. stood up and said, “It's late we should all go to bed. What time should we meet on Saturday?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How about 9 a.m.?”, suggested Abraxas. “Then we would have plenty of time for the appointment at Gringotts.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All right, I'll talk to Sluggy after Potions class then we will all meet here afterwards, and I will let you know if he has approved our request”, Marvolo suggested.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That is fine with me, Marvolo”, Orion answered for himself and his two other friends. It was a sign of honour for their leader, that they called him by his middle name. His friends were aware of how much he despised his Muggle heritage and they all supported him willingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silently, they all went to their dorms to get some sleep so that they would be prepared enough for the new day.</p>
