    <p>When Alexandria Marie Granger first showed up in England to visit her beloved cousin, she did not expect that she would have to go to different places in order to find her damnable cousin. </p><p>"When I get my hands on her," Allie muttered to herself "I'm putting a goddamn tracking charm on her."<br/>
"For fucks sake the fuck is she doing here?!" She exclaimed upon seeing 12 Grimmuld place. 

"HERMIONE JEAN GET YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS OUT HERE NOW AND GIVE ME A FUCKING HUG YOU BITCH" Allie screamed towards the door "AND DONT YOU FUCKING THINK I HAVE ANY ISSUES CAUSING A SCENE TO BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DONT" </p><p>The door opened and a tall man with messy black hair, glasses and a lighting bolt scar on his forehead pokes his head out. "Uh excuse me Miss, but what are you doing?" Ha asks in a soft British accent "Looking for my cousin Green Bean. And seeing as you don't have red hair I'm going to assume your Harry,  'Mione's friend/brother? Correct?" Allie asks 
"Yeah that's me,  you don't know who I am?" He asks amazed someone doesn't know who he is.  "Nope,  I'm an American we usually try to keep away from you Brits issues" Allie shrugs and proceeds to walk up the stoop to the door "Now ya going to let me in or what Harry?" She asks laughing at his dumbfounded expression. </p><p>Harry opens the door and let's Allie in. Upon entering Mrs. Black starts screaming her usually obscenities at the person entering. Allie takes one look at her and then unleashes on the painting "LOOK HERE YOU OBSCENE PEICE OF POOR TASTE IN DECOR. SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH BEFORE I SHUT IT FOR YOU. YOU STUPID FUCKING,  DUMB FUCK, IDIOT, BITCH." In the living room Allie heard someone laughing because after that rant Mrs. Black promptly shut up and when to the back of her painting. "Oh that's amazing I don't think anyone has ever said that to her before. Hermione your cousin is allowed to stay here when ever she wants." Upon entering the room Allie saw who it was talking and she walked over to him and hugged him. "Thank you,  for taking care of 'Mione. After Aunt Jean and Uncle David died I was worried about her. Thank you for watching over her." Allie said quietly as she had started crying into Sirius's chest while hugging him. After letting him go,  she turned around and noticed the rest of who was there. A short red haired woman had wrapped her arms around Harry's waist looking at Allie smiling softly "Hello you must be Ginny, nice to finally have a face to the name, that Butterbeer bread recipe you sent me was amazing by the way" Allie shakes Ginny's hand. </p><p>Another red head comes up to Allie and tries to introduce himself but Allie holds up her hand and doesn't let him. She looks right at Hermione, who's stand next to Sirius who has his arm around her shoulders, and sees that her cousin has a look of fear and dread on her face along with what looks like bruising on her one wrist. "Look here, I find out your hurting my cousin I'll kill ya. Won't Nobody be missing ya neither cuz there won't be a body to find. Put your hands on my cousin again and you better hope your god is merciful to you because mine won't be." She whispers to Ron smiling slightly at seeing the rage she sees in his eyes, his eyes dart to Hermione and the rage becomes more clear in his eyes,  but before he can even take one step towards her Allie is there in front of him again. And she pulls her arm back and cold clocks Ron right in the face,  as he holds his face in his hands Allie brings up her foot and basically mule kicks Ron right in the center of his chest. Knocking him onto his back gasping for air.</p><p>As Ron lays the ground Allie stands over him looking like a certain insane witch as she starts to cackle and taunt him. "Whats the matter there boy? Shocked that a female has put you on your back?  Or is it that Hermione here has had enough of being you punching bag and wants you to feel like she did?  Let me tell you what Weasel you've done fucked up now, because you put your hands on an heiress. That's right Me and Hermione here are heirs to the Great and Noble House of LaFey. You done fucked up." Allie says with a look of disgust on her face. </p><p>As everyone in the room looks at Ron in shock at what just happened Allie sees someone go up behind her cousin another tall male, but this one has white-blonde hair and gray eyes. She smiles at him and nods. Hermione looks over her should to see Draco Malfoy.</p>
