    <p>“<em>Stupefy</em>!” “<em>Expelliarmus</em>!” “<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>!”<br/><br/> Spells flew wildly around the cave, each one illuminating dark corners for a moment as they travelled through the damp air. Aurors Malfoy and Potter had been working this case since they were first partnered together 6 months ago, and it had led them to this cave which, as it turns out, was the secret base for a gang of dark wizards who had been slowly working on their plan to terrorize magical London. Fortunately, Harry and Draco had managed to get to them before they did any major damage. As Harry dashed about the cave dodging spells, a small part of his brain reflected on when they'd first started the case. There was a bit of tension when he started spending most of his time with Draco at work, but they had distracted themselves with the case to avoid awkward “catching up.” Harry had figured he knew what he needed to know about Malfoy without trying to get to know him any better: he'd been in the Prophet a few times for his charity work, he had climbed the ladder at the Ministry quickly and had a reputation as a dedicated (if a bit obsessive) Auror, and- because people really don't change much- he was still a pretentious, narcissistic, annoying git.<br/><br/> In reality, Draco spent more time getting his work done than bothering Harry- he really was a diligent worker, to the point that total silence was much more common in their office than traded insults. Of course, Draco had a bit of a temper, and was still as pompous as ever, so if Harry ever had the audacity to not know anything, Draco was sure to loom it over him. There was an exception, though, and it was when Draco knew more about the Dark Arts than Harry did. Harry could tell Draco hated talking about it, but they both knew it was necessary. I mean, it’s not like Harry got a kick out of researching Voldemort’s supporters.<br/><br/> Now that they had cracked the case and were (hopefully) about to silence the terrorist cell once and for all, Harry couldn't help but admit they were at least good team in the field. Not that they hadn’t argued for a few hours about how best to ambush the cave.<br/><br/> Harry was sat behind a rock formation, and he leaned out for a moment to get a look at his options. Malfoy wasn’t too far off, firing from behind the shield of another large rock, which looked pretty damaged from Harry’s side. Just as he looked out, he saw Malfoy take down another terrorist: only two were left standing. Harry quickly hit one with <em>Stupefy</em>, which sent him flying into a rock wall, knocked out unconscious (whoops). However, as he did, the other disarmed him, leaving Harry vulnerable. Malfoy disarmed the attacker in return, but before they could stop him, the terrorist grabbed a phial from the table behind him, which was quite small but bright pink.<br/><br/> “Nobody move,” he said, dangling the phial. Harry strongly considered moving anyways, not phased by the fact he had a tiny potion (<em>What’s he going to do, drink it and fall in love with us?</em> Harry chuckled to himself). However, Malfoy shot him a pretty severe glare, so he stayed still.<br/><br/> “Ah, you know what this is, then,” the wizard smiled, looking at Malfoy.<br/><br/> “Obviously,” Malfoy frowned. Damn, the man really loved being sarcastic.<br/><br/> “So you know that if I drop it, we’ll all get blown to itty bitty bits,” the wizard continued.<br/><br/> “Again, yes. Not the brightest attempted murderer, are you?” Malfoy retorted.<br/><br/> “Now, now, no need to be rude Mr. Malfoy,” he clicked his tongue. Harry noticed Draco’s hand tighten on his wand.  “I remember when that name had power, commanded respect. Sad to see it wasted on you,” the wizard grimaced. “Your father, though, he had a better idea. Lucius was always-”<br/><br/> “You can keep my father’s name out of your filthy mouth,” Draco demanded through a clenched jaw.<br/><br/> “Filthy? Defending mudbloods, running around with the enemy,” he motioned to Harry when he said that, “tarnishing sacred pureblood tradition, and you’re talking about filthy?”<br/> Harry was starting to get anxious. He was waiting for the right time to summon his wand (using wandless magic to summon your wand: a bit paradoxical but quite handy) so the terrorist wouldn’t see, but it hadn’t come yet, and Draco seemed intent on pissing this guy off.<br/><br/> “You know,” the wizard continued, “sometimes I think blood traitors are even worse, because they had a chance and they wasted it. Not everyone is so lucky to be born to a proper pureblooded lineage- really, it’s ungrateful. I promise, when our mission is complete, there won’t be any room for people like y-”<br/><br/> “<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>!” Draco shouted all of a sudden, lifting the phial right out of his hands and, with a flick of the wrist, flinging it towards Harry. <em>Fuck you too, Malfoy</em>, Harry thought to himself as he jumped up to catch the phial, <em>if this thing explodes on my hand and kills us all, I’m requesting a transfer</em>.<br/><br/> Harry just barely caught it, and by the time he’d landed, Malfoy had the final dark wizard bound and dangling by a rope from a stalactite.<br/><br/> “I really hate meeting Dad’s old friends,” Malfoy sighed, speaking over the muffled screams of the wizard above them. Harry wanted to laugh, but he wasn’t sure it was a joke, so he just nodded instead. Harry sent out a Patronus, signalling to their backup that it was safe to enter and help round up the suspects. Harry and Draco started collecting evidence from the various cabinets strewn about the cave.  It seemed like the group had their own little collection of dark artifacts. The backup team entered a few minutes later.<br/><br/> “Damn, looks like they put up a good fight,” Auror Withers noted as he scanned the cave.<br/><br/> “Yeah, we could’ve used you during the action,” Harry replied, “but there was never a good time to send a patronus. Stalactites are pretty flimsy as far as cover goes.”<br/><br/> “Stalagmites,” Draco corrected without looking back.<br/><br/> “Huh?” Harry turned to him, but Draco continued labelling potions and putting them in his bag.<br/><br/> “They’re stalagmites. The ones on the ceiling are stalactites.”<br/><br/> “Oh,” Harry rolled his eyes. Did Draco always have to be right? If so, did he have to be so prattish about it?<br/><br/> “Well, we’ll start Apparating these guys back to containment,” Withers nodded as he walked towards a groaning, half-conscious suspect strewn across the floor.<br/><br/> “Be careful with our friend on the ceiling,” Draco smirked, “he’s an old pal. Isn’t that right?” Draco shifted his attention to the dangling terrorist, smiling up at him. He just screamed through his gag, face red from the improper blood flow of being upside down. Draco just chuckled and went back to his work.<br/><br/> “I see, you do all that work on your charity, and then come here and get out all your pent-up sadistic energy,” Harry joked. Hermione was always blabbing about how great the Muggle-Born Reparational Fund was, but come on, <em>Malfoy</em> founded it, so Harry was sure there was some ulterior motive- probably registering muggle-borns for some sick reason. Harry had been trying to get him to talk about it more so he could investigate, but Draco was extremely secretive (which was even more suspicious).<br/><br/> “The Fund and the sadistic energy are both side effects of my inner desire for justice,” Draco explained, “and, of course, ridiculous amounts of money,” Draco finished, and Harry wasn’t sure whether to laugh or not. The words indicated a joke, but his tone was stern. Harry figured it was better to let Draco think his joke failed, than to laugh at Draco when he was being serious.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/> After most of the artefacts had been packed up for inspection and delivered to the Ministry, only a few unconscious wizards remained (they should’ve all been gone by now, but the back-up team had a penchant for smoke breaks).<br/><br/> “Looks like we’re about done here. Want to Apparate back together?” Draco asked nonchalantly.<br/><br/> “Er, sure,” Harry replied, a little taken aback. It’s more efficient to Apparate together when you’re both going to the same place, but he never thought Draco would just up and do it.<br/><br/> Draco slinked an arm around Harry’s waist. Well, that certainly didn’t make it any less awkward. Just as Harry felt that swirly feeling pull on his gut, and as the cave started to spin away, he heard the sound of struggle, and saw an escaped suspect grab a wand and send a spell flying their way. Harry felt the force of it ripple through the space around them as they tumbled away into the Ministry Apparition point.<br/><br/> Draco and Harry stood motionless as they landed.<br/><br/> “What just happened?” Harry asked quietly.<br/><br/> “He hexed us, just as we apparated,” Draco answered, which wasn’t exactly the answer Harry was looking for.<br/><br/> “Did it hit us?”<br/><br/> “I… can’t tell. I feel a bit odd,” Draco pressed his hands to his body a bit, as if it would help reveal what hex had hit (or not hit) them.<br/><br/> “Did you hear what he said, when he cast it?” Harry asked.<br/><br/> “Only part of it. Something <em>corporis</em>,” Draco began to walk away, but suddenly, he stopped. “Er, Potter?”<br/><br/> “What is it?” Harry was starting to get nervous.<br/><br/> “I can’t move,” Draco stepped back. “I mean, I can move, but not past this point.”<br/><br/> Harry was speechless. What the hell kind of hex was this? Draco dashed to the left, stopping almost a few steps later, then repeated to the right. Harry followed him, and felt it too: it was like an invisible wall. Experimentally, Harry attempted to lean against it. It sort of worked, but it didn’t feel very comfortable, so he quit.<br/><br/> “So, we’re stuck at the Apparition point?” Harry asked no one in particular. Draco didn’t reply, just kept walking around the perimeter. Harry decided there wasn’t much else to do but test it further, and when he did, Draco stepped further away.<br/><br/> “Hey, it’s widening!” Harry exclaimed.<br/><br/> “No, I think it’s relative to where you’re standing…” Draco stroked his chin, clearly in deep thought.<br/><br/> “What if we step forward at the same time?” Harry postulated.<br/><br/> They tried it. Then they tried it again. Quickly it became apparent that they could go past the perimeter if they were both moving. However, when Draco tried to run back, the limit stopped him.<br/><br/> “It seems the perimeter is based on our relative distance to each other,” Draco observed.<br/><br/> “Let’s keep walking then,” Harry sighed, “and go to Kingsley’s office.”<br/><br/> After some awkward starts and re-starts to try and walk together (Draco’s legs were so much longer than Harry’s and that Type A attitude made him walk quite briskly: it was hard to keep up, and it felt like it got harder each time they tried), they reached the Minister’s office.<br/><br/> “Minister Shacklebolt?” Draco called into the room.<br/><br/> “Ah! Malfoy and Potter! Heard your bust went well,” Kingsley stood up to greet them, smiling.<br/><br/> “The bust was fine,” Harry butted in, “but one of them managed to hex us at the last second.”<br/><br/> “Oh my, are you two alright?” Kingsley asked with concern.<br/><br/> They paused for a moment.<br/><br/> “Er, not… we’ve been better. It seems we can’t be more than a few feet apart,” Draco explained.<br/><br/> “I’ve… never heard of a hex that causes that before,” Kingsley pondered.<br/><br/> “Well, it should wear off soon, right? I mean, it barely got us as we Apparated-” Harry rushed.<br/><br/> “You were Apparating when it hit you?” Kingsley’s eyes widened.<br/><br/> “Er, yes?” Draco answered nervously.<br/><br/> “Oh, that’s not good,” Kingsley sighed. “Not much is known about how the magic of Apparition mixes with anything else. It’s considered highly dangerous to cast any spells while Apparating, let alone get hit by them.”<br/><br/> “What <em>do</em> we know about being cursed while Apparating?” Draco asked.<br/><br/> “It doesn’t make it temporary, if that’s what you’re asking,” Kingsley frowned, shooting a look at Harry. <em>Excuse me for not wanting to be glued to a former Death Eater</em>, Harry thought, but generously chose not to say.<br/><br/> “You must be joking,” Draco laughed, but not in an amused way. “We’re stuck like this? For who knows how long?”<br/><br/> “Well, maybe there’s a silver lining to all this. You two work together well in the field, but the most important work in a case is done here in the Ministry, and that’s where the most issues between you two arise. Perhaps learning to work together, even if it’s mandatory, is a chance to boost partner morale!”<br/><br/> Harry’s jaw dropped. Kingsley was nearly <em>excited</em> that this had happened.<br/><br/> Harry and Draco both started to protest, but Kingsley beat them to it.<br/><br/> “I know, it’s very inconvenient. But, it could be a lot worse.”<br/><br/> “Like what?” Draco blurted out.<br/><br/> “You could’ve been injured!” Kingsley replied, shocked.<br/><br/> “We might injure each other.” Draco crossed his arms. Harry wasn’t too ecstatic to hear that, but he didn’t disagree, either.<br/><br/> “That’s ridiculous. You two will figure this out,” Kingsley said in an attempt at a comforting voice.<br/><br/> “How do you know that?” Harry asked.<br/><br/> “I know because, you’re the two strongest Aurors in the department!” Kingsley smiled. “And, because you’re the two newest members of the Inquisitorial Squad investigating what this curse is and how to cure it.”<br/><br/> Draco began massaging his temples while Harry dropped his forehead into his hand.<br/><br/>-</p><p><br/> “Leave it to Kingsley to treat a work injury with more work,” Draco grumbled on his way out of the office.<br/><br/> “Pfft, yeah,” Harry replied. Okay, now Harry was really concerned: was that another joke? “When he said that, I rolled my eyes so hard I saw my own brain,” Harry continued.<br/><br/> “Mm, so you’ve confirmed there is <em>something</em> in there?” Draco said smugly. Harry frowned: same old Malfoy.<br/><br/> “Glad to see the curse didn’t knock that stick out of your arse,” Harry shot back. Draco didn’t say anything.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/> After making it back to their office, with a stop by the library to grab some literature that might help with their research on this stupid curse, they found they were able to sit at their own desks… after Draco had magically moved his a few feet closer. Now their desks made an L shape, which was weirdly close for Harry’s tastes, but obviously they had no choice.<br/><br/> Harry grabbed a book and began flipping through it, <em>the History of Apparition and Transportational Magics</em>, and after a while, he reached into his top right drawer and grabbed some Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans to snack on while he read. After a minute, Harry noticed his chair had rolled to the right a little, but when he tried to push back it didn’t work (the wheels were always getting stuck), so he just moved his book closer, too focused on his reading to care. Then it happened again. And again. Soon, the end of Harry’s desk was pressing into his leg.<br/><br/> “Malfoy, something’s wrong with my-” Harry began with a mouthful of Beans.<br/><br/> “Sweet Merlin, Potter, could you be chewing any louder? I can’t hear myself think!” Draco spat.<br/><br/> All of a sudden, Harry and his chair were pulled all the way to the end of the L.<br/><br/> “What was that?” Draco asked, too shocked by the magical chair to stay mad about the Beans.<br/><br/> “I don’t know,” Harry replied. He tried to push himself back, but it didn’t work.<br/><br/> “Oh Merlin’s tit, the perimeter is shrinking,” Draco sighed, resting his head in his hands.<br/><br/> However, when Harry pushed against the perimeter again, he was able to move back, albeit not a lot.<br/><br/> “No, look, it’s moving again,” Harry observed, rolling around on his chair.<br/><br/> “What?” Draco watched him, wide-eyed.<br/><br/> “I think the perimeter changes,” Harry thought aloud.<br/><br/> “But why? What made it shrink?” Draco questioned.<br/><br/> “I don’t know. It’s not like anything changed, all I did was eat Bertie Bott’s-” Harry began.<br/><br/> “I got mad at you!” Draco exclaimed. “When you were eating them, it was so bloody loud I was sure I was going to stab myself in the ears,” Draco recalled, “and then the perimeter shrank.”<br/><br/> “So, what? Our moods impact the perimeter?” Harry asked, trying to ignore Draco’s unnecessarily detailed recollection.<br/><br/> “No, because it didn’t get that small in Kingsley’s office, and we were both frustrated then. I think, because the spell has connected us somehow, it’s dependent on our feelings towards each other, specifically,” Draco theorized.<br/><br/> All this talk of <em>us</em> and <em>each other</em> was a lot for Harry to take in. <em>The spell has connected us somehow</em>, Harry repeated internally.<br/><br/> “Well, that’s a major breakthrough. Good thing these chairs roll, or you’d have probably fallen onto the floor,” Draco chuckled, turning back to his book.<br/><br/> <em>Why wouldn’t he want me to fall on the floor?</em> Harry wondered.<br/><br/> “Actually,” Draco added, “that would’ve been hilarious. Nevermind.”<br/><br/> <em>Same old Malfoy</em>, Harry thought with a smile.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/> “I’ve found it,” Draco stood up, shifting the book over to Harry. He pointed to a specific spell. “<em>Vinculum corporis</em>. It bonds two people so that they stick together for a few minutes. It’s handy in battle, apparently, because those affected will be hit by any spell together.”<br/><br/> “So, his plan was to stick us together and then <em>kedavra</em> us both to smithereens,” Harry continued.<br/><br/> “That’d be my guess. He probably figured that he could only get to one of us before the other would kill him,” Draco smirked a bit. Even in these trying times, might as well take a hex as a compliment.<br/><br/> “But this says the two people are stuck together completely, and we have a little legroom. What gives?” Harry questioned.<br/><br/> “Obviously, I don’t know yet,” Draco sighed. The words sounded like they could’ve been a traditional Malfoy rude tease, but they seemed genuine, and Harry was taken aback at his own comfort with Draco’s words.<br/><br/> “We have to assume the Apparating is what altered it, right?” Harry theorized.<br/><br/> “I don’t see what else it could be,” Draco shrugged. “Kingsley implied that mixing with Apparition increases of the duration of a curse. And since the original spell is only supposed to be pretty brief…”<br/><br/> “It’s probably going to stay until we find a counter-curse,” Harry sighed.<br/><br/> Draco looked out the window. It had been dark for a while.<br/><br/> “Well, we’ve pretty much established we won’t find the fix tonight, and I’m afraid if I read any more my brain will melt out of my ears,” Draco yawned.<br/><br/> “How are we going to sleep? I mean, where will we go?” Harry anxiously questioned.<br/><br/> “If we can manage to stay friendly, we can probably share a room,” Draco replied groggily.<br/><br/> “Well, my apartment only has the one bed,” Harry awkwardly remembered.<br/><br/> “We can get a room at a hotel, that way there will be two beds, but close enough so we can stay inside the perimeter,” Draco suggested. “I know a place not too far from here that’s clean and cheap-ish, and the rooms are small which is actually handy, now.”<br/><br/> <em>What possible reason would Draco have to know about hotels in the area?</em> Harry wondered, electing not to consider possible answers.<br/><br/> “Er, sure, but we’ll have to go by my place for an overnight bag,” Harry said with a raised eyebrow.<br/><br/> “Of course, Potter, I’m not an animal,” Draco scoffed, “we’ll go by my place as well.”<br/><br/>-<br/><br/> “Welcome to my humble abode,” Harry said plainly, gesturing around the living area as he opened the door to his flat, Draco trailing behind him.<br/><br/> “It’s… rather nice,” Draco said, sound a bit more surprised than Harry liked. It was a pretty large space, especially for an apartment, but it had a cozy feel because of all the colorful, cushy furniture. Pictures and posters adorned the walls: it would’ve been cute if it weren’t so messy.<br/><br/> “Let me just pack a few things,” Harry said, walking to his bedroom. Draco almost forgot to follow him (the whole thing was still taking some getting used to), but fortunately their neutral emotions toward each other presently let Harry get pretty far before Draco had to move.<br/><br/> The bedroom was quite dishevelled, and the comforter was mostly fallen off the bed. Harry dug through a pile of clothes, seemingly picking some at near random, much to Draco’s dismay. Harry slipped into the bathroom to toss random toiletries into his bag, and then they were out the door.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/> Draco wordlessly unlocked his apartment, getting right to work gathering his things rather than inviting Harry in (who followed him in anyways). Harry was rather surprised: nearly everything in the apartment was white, with the occasional green accent. Everything looked new, and incredibly clean, aside from the occasional antique decoration or book. Undoubtedly the most striking and obvious feature of the apartment was that the entire side facing the outside was one giant window, overlooking the edge of the city and the rolling hills behind it. Harry noticed the radio was already playing when they entered, but Draco didn’t turn it off when they came in: did he leave it on all the time?<br/><br/> “Wow, your place is spotless. You must entertain a lot,” Harry thought out loud.<br/><br/> “Why would you think that?” Draco asked absentmindedly, flipping through clothes in his closet.<br/><br/> “I…” Harry began, but he never finished.<br/><br/> Draco carefully folded his clothes, selecting a bunch of white shirts and black pants Harry couldn’t even tell apart. For good measure, Draco packed a black shirt and a green shirt, just in case.<br/><br/> Harry was surprised at how many pillows Malfoy had on his bed. What possible reason could any man have for 20-something pillows? Were they decorative? Were they for fort-building?<br/> Harry looked up and realized Draco’s ceiling was charmed to look like the night sky, and he smiled fondly remembering Hogwarts. The effect wasn’t as good as the one in the Great Hall, but Harry had never seen anyone else even try to recreate the charm, so he had no right to judge.<br/><br/> Once Malfoy was packed, they apparated together to the hotel. Harry browsed through the Prophet sitting on the table while Malfoy booked the room.<br/><br/> Once they were inside, Harry’s heart sank, although he wasn’t sure what he had been expecting. The room was small: just the two twin-size beds, with a nightstand in between and a window on the furthest wall, and a bathroom off to the side.<br/><br/> “Well, I guess this is actually rather convenient,” Harry said aloud even though he was talking to himself more than Draco. “Won’t have to wake the other up to go the bathroom in the middle of the night.”<br/><br/> “Try not to get angsty in your sleep, Potter,” Draco smiled. “I don’t know about you, but I’m exhausted.”<br/><br/> “It’s certainly been a wild day,” Potter sighed, sitting down on the closest bed. Draco walked over to his bed, setting his bag on it. He pulled his pyjamas out, laid them on the bed, and started unbuttoning his shirt.<br/><br/> Harry’s eyes widened. Was Malfoy about to change right in front of him?<br/><br/> “Close your eyes,” Draco instructed. <em>Don’t have to tell me twice!</em> Harry thought, shutting them tightly. He heard the sound of fabric against skin to his left. Harry tried not to listen, but there was nothing else to focus on. Soon, the sound of shoes being toed off and a belt being undone echoed through the room. Harry swallowed, but found his mouth rather dry all of a sudden.<br/> Harry heard the jingling of the belt fall down, and a clunk hit the floor, and he knew Draco was only in his pants now. Then, much to Harry’s horror, he heard more fabric slide: Draco slept without pants on! Harry may have felt his cock twitch, but he certainly didn’t let himself acknowledge it. Finally, he heard the sounds of silky fabric sliding off the bed’s scratchy comforter, and the pop of the band as Draco adjusted his pyjama bottoms. Harry dared to open his eyes, just in time to see a glimpse of a pale, muscular back as Draco slipped on his pyjama top and started buttoning it. The pyjamas were Slytherin green, of course, and had Draco’s initials embroidered on a front chest pocket.<br/><br/> “Aren’t you going to get in pyjamas?” Draco asked without looking back.<br/><br/> “Oh, I, er, don’t really…” Harry trailed off, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly. Draco spun back, eyes wide.<br/><br/> “You don’t wear nightclothes?” Draco was turning a little red. It looked good with the green.<br/><br/> “Not usually, no,” Harry blushed. Draco just shook his head and turned back to his bag, putting his old clothes back in. Harry slipped off his shirt, shoes, and jeans rather quickly, hoping to hop into bed before he made Draco uncomfortable with his just-wearing-pants-ness. By the time he was done, Draco had slipped under the covers and turned away.<br/><br/> “Goodnight, Potter,” Draco stated plainly.<br/><br/> “Goodnight, Malfoy,” Harry returned, flicking off the light and setting his glasses on the nightstand.<br/><br/> The freedom felt good. Not having someone breathing down his neck, being able to roll around in bed without hitting an invisible wall, it was nice. For the first few minutes. But listening to Draco breathe peacefully as he slept, Harry found himself almost… missing the feeling of being that close to someone. Working together, researching the curse, testing its limits, Harry had felt like his relationship with Draco had grown tenfold more in the past day than it had in these few months of being partners. I mean sure, it had come with its share of frustrations (and then some), but it felt satisfying in its own way. But another part of Harry was rapidly growing in its need to be satisfied: Harry had a bit of a bad habit of getting himself before bed, and he needed to wank or he probably wouldn’t be able to sleep. Looking over at Draco to make sure he was still sound asleep, Harry delicately reached down and touched his cock. It was already half-hard, as it had been for a while (<em>since Draco changed clothes</em>, a voice in his head very annoyingly added), and it perked at Harry’s touch. He closed his eyes, taking it into his hand and giving it a proper stroke. Once he reached full hardness, he heard his breathing get louder, and looked back at Draco again to make sure he hadn’t awoken. Looking at Draco made his cock twitch, a fact he elected to ignore as he continued, reaching down to fondle his balls. A nearly-silent whimper emerged, and Harry realized he hadn’t looked away from Draco. And yet, for some reason, he still didn’t look away. He continued to stroke himself, watching Draco’s slender form rise and fall with his steady breaths. Before he knew it, his orgasm was tumbling out of him, and he managed to restrain himself to only letting a sigh escape.<br/><br/> Harry didn’t remember closing his eyes or looking away from Draco, but when he woke up, sunlight was streaming into the room and Draco was brushing his teeth in the bathroom.</p>
