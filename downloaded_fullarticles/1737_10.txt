    <p>‟And how was Cairo?” Elphias asks as soon as he and Albus have sat down at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.</p><p>Around them, the air is filled with laughter and joy as all the students of Hogwarts are back for a new school year and most are getting reacquainted with their friends for the first time in months.</p><p>On the table, plates are suddenly magically filled with various types of food. Both seventh years realize how hungry they are as they quickly load their plates with a little of everything.</p><p>The Start-of-Term Feast looks even more scrumptious than ever and it seems the house-elves have outdone themselves once more.</p><p>Aberforth, Albus’ sibling, sits down a few vacant seats away from his brother and his best friend, but chimes in their conversation anyway, like he always does.</p><p>The latter is more of a loner and doesn’t have a steady group of friends. ‟He won a gold medal for <em>Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference </em>or something along that line, ” he says as he too starts to fill his plate. ‟Mother was so proud of his achievement that she’s been telling everyone around Godric’s Hollow how brilliant her prodigious son is. To top it all off, Mr. Perfect was named Head Boy as well.”</p><p>To say Aberforth and Albus don’t really get along anymore is an understatement.</p><p>If when they were young boys, they spent countless hours playing together in the backyard of their family’s house, wore identical clothes and sported the same haircut to look even more alike, as soon as Albus’ superior intelligence began to show, their mother quickly focussed her attention and her affection on him instead of on her middle child, putting Aberforth, who was wilder in nature and wasn’t interested in school that much in the back of her mind.</p><p>With Ariana being ill and her husband having been sent to prison, Kendra Dumbledore has her arms full already and taking care of Aberforth sadly isn’t very high on her priority list.</p><p>Elphias quirks an eyebrow at Aberforth, as he takes a bite of a deliciously crispy chicken drumstick. ‟Well, it makes perfect sense Albus was picked to be Head Boy. Who else would Headmaster Black choose anyway?”</p><p>‟Indeed, who else?” Aberforth sourly replies before he quickly turns his back on them.</p><p>‟Certainly not Henry Potter…” replies Alicia Sparrow, a fellow Gryffindor, who’s sitting across from Elphias, as she winks at both boys.</p><p>The three start to snort as soon as they spot the bespectacled and messy-haired Henry, who is sitting not too far from them and who is once more trying to land a date with Lexia Fleamont.</p><p>‟And how was the rest of your summer, Elphias?” Albus asks as the anxious-looking first years are being lined up by Professor Merrythought for the Sorting Ceremony.</p><p>The friends pause their conversation for a while as Headmaster Black brings in the Sorting Hat and the little first years are being sorted into their new house, only getting back to it when the sorting is over and the feast goes on.</p><p>‟Well, you know how my aunt is. I’ve had to work at her shop for most of the time. She says I’m not bright enough to handle the customers and the potion brewing, but at least she lets me carry around crates and stuff and I can fill up the vials too. I’ve earned some money out of it and I’m pretty sure I look more fit  by now.”</p><p>Elphias flexes his right arm just to prove his point and Alicia rolls her eyes at him, while Albus smirks a little in his pumpkin juice.</p><p>Truth be told, the two of them sadly are rather skinny things;  Albus preferring to read and study instead of working out and Elphias generally avoiding physical work whenever he can and his aunt isn’t looking.</p><p>You see, Elphias, who had contracted the dragon pox shortly before he had begun his first year at Hogwarts, had lost his parents to the illness and had been taken in since then, by his aunt, who was a bit harsh at times but was also very protective of him. The latter owned a potion shop in the magical village of Puddlemere, which was located in the West Country.</p><p>If it was true Elphias wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, his unwavering loyalty and kindness more than made up for his lack of wit.</p><p>The two outcasts, Elphias because of his pockmarks and Albus because of the family drama that had surrounded his father’s arrest, had quickly bonded together during their first day at Hogwarts and had been inseparable since then.</p><p>Both boys laughed as they exchanged more stories about their summer, while other Gryffindors joined in their conversation every now and then to greet them and to congratulate Albus on his Head Boy nomination.</p><p>After a while, the food vanished from the table and Clarissa Abbott, who finally caught Albus’ eyes for the first time since the feast had begun, smiled sweetly at him from the Hufflepuff table.</p><p>Elphias, who had always had a good eye, spotted the girl’s gesture and quickly commented on it. ‟Seems like Clarissa still has a crush on you. You should ask her out.”</p><p>‟She’s kind, but she’s not really my type. Plus, with school and everything, I’m too busy to even have a girlfriend.” Albus declares as he avoids Clarissa’s stare and glances at the teacher’s table instead.</p><p>Elphias stares at his friend with incredulity. ‟Merlin knows I would do anything at this point to get a girlfriend of my own. If Merope Bulstrode asked me on a date, I would say yes if it meant I would finally get laid.”</p><p>Alicia knocks Elphias in the ribs, while Albus rolls his eyes at him.</p><p>‟I mean we are 17 years old, Al.” Elphias points out.</p><p>The fact Albus doesn’t seem more interested by girls has always struck him as odd. His aunt told him is friend probably was a late bloomer, whatever that meant, but still... ‟Most of us will be married by the end of next year. I don’t know how you even-”</p><p>‟Sush, Headmaster Black is about to start his speech!” quickly states Albus, a faint blush present on his cheeks, as he focuses his attention on their Headmaster, which forces Elphias to drop the matter.</p><p>It was true though that the dark haired older wizard was standing up and was waiting for everyone’s silence to begin his start of year speech, now that all the first years had been sorted into their respective house and that everyone’s belly was pleasantly full.</p><p>‟I am very happy to see you here tonight and back to our school, children.”The headmaster began as the last mutterings died into the room.</p><p>‟Of course, we know you don’t really care about us; which is fine because we don’t like you either...” Muttered Henry Potter loudly enough for everyone around him to hear and a prefect had to kick him under the table in order to shut him up.</p><p>It’s true though that the Headmaster isn’t very popular among his students and it would be a lie not to say that many share Potter’s view on the topic...</p><p>If Black heard the comment, it doesn’t show on his face, as he continues to talk.</p><p>‟This year, some of our students will be able to experience an incredible adventure. The Ministry has decided that the Triwizard Tournament is going to be held after a hundred years hiatus. Students from fourth to seven year will be able to place their name in the Goblet of Fire, and one of them will be selected to represent our school against Durmstrang and Beauxbâtons.  The first task will be held at Hogwarts and I’m counting on everyone’s best behavior to warmly welcome our foreign visitors once they get here.  The second task will be held at Beauxbâtons, which is located in the Pyrénées mountains and lastly, the third task will be held at Durmstrang, which location, as some of you already know, is unplottable.”</p><p>‟I’ve heard a Cockatrice had been let loose on the jury last time and the death rate had been so high, they decided to cancel it afterwards,” commented Arthur McGrawth to no one in particular before the Headmaster went on with his speech.</p><p>‟The prize, which of course will be won by the Hogwarts’ champion, will be eternal glory, the Triwizard cup, which is a thing of beauty, and money. Of course, the sixth and seventh years students who will desire to do so will be able to accompany our champion to the other tasks.” The older students cheered upon hearing this, while the younger ones seemed very bitter about it. ‟Prefects, I will now ask you to escort the first years to their dormitories and hope to see everyone up and early in class tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Black stared at his students one last time before they all began to leave the Great Hall to get back to their respective common rooms in a symphony of laughter and excited whispering.</p><p>After all, eternal glory, a dangerous competition, a glittering trophy and a pile of money sounded way too fantastic to be true.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Albus muttered a quick Nox as soon as he closed the ugly new set of curtains that has been placed around his four poster bed to substitute the ones he had burned for the second time last semester.</p><p>He thinks about the tournament as he settles down in his crimson and gold blankets. To say he would love to add the Triwizard cup to his ever-growing collection of prizes is an euphemism. After all, he was made for eternal glory…</p><p>In another dormitory, Aberforth thinks about the competition too. He sees in it a way to finally outshine his prat of a big brother. If he was chosen as the Hogwarts’ champion, their mother would probably be proud of him once more.</p><p>He can easily picture how she and Ariana would look like once they would learn he was the chosen one, which makes his dreams way sweeter than usual.</p><p>As he closes his eyes, Elphias secretly wants to participate to the Triwizard Tournament too. Surely, if he was selected as the Hogwarts’ champion, the girls would look past his look and he too might finally be able to find a nice girlfriend. Having been an only child and an orphan for a while now, he would love to settle down and have a family of his own too.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Albus and Elphias quickly settle back into their old school routine.  It’s their seventh year at Hogwarts after all.</p><p>The redhead is soon back to being top of all of their classes and his Head Boy duties keep him somewhat busy too.  He regularly sends home owls to keep his mother informed of his whereabouts and tells her in one of his letters that he is going to place his name in the Goblet of Fire once the subscriptions for the tournament have begun.</p><p>If Aberforth tells her the same, Kendra doesn’t comment on it…</p><p>As the days go by, the students are more and more eager to see the foreign visitors arrive, which finally happens at the end of September, when the delegation from Beauxbâtons arrives in the middle of dinner in a large blue carriage pulled by Abraxan horses.</p><p>It looks magnificent and so does the Beauxbâtons students, who all look gorgeous in their silky blue uniforms. Most of them are seventh and sixth years, but there are at least three fifth years and two fourth years among them.  Most have brown hair and brown eyes and they quickly befriend the Ravenclaws and sit at their table in the Great Hall, since the blue of their uniform matches theirs so well.</p><p>A week later, during one of the meals, Headmaster Black declares the Goblet of Fire will soon be placed in the Great Hall and would be ready to receive the names of everyone who dreamed of participating in the tournament.</p><p>The only thing missing for it to happen is for the Durmstrang students to get here, which shouldn’t be too long by now…</p><p align="center">***</p><p>When October finally rolls by and the Durmstrang delegation hasn’t made it yet to the castle, people start to gossip.</p><p>Had Durmstrang decided not to participate in the competition after all?</p><p>Would the tournament be canceled?</p><p>Madame Clémence Touraine, Beauxbâtons’ headmistress even comments on it with the other teachers in the Great Hall one evening, which soon makes the students panic.</p><p>When finally, one stormy evening, the doors of the Great Hall are suddenly opened and the lights are dimmed down, everyone lets out a sigh of relief as in storms Nikita Volodya, Durmstrang’s headmistress, a short woman of four feet tall you wouldn’t want to mess with.</p><p>The Durmstrang delegation silently follows her and looks quite small.  She barely has ten students with her as both Madame Clémence and Headmaster Black rush forward to greet her with cordial handshakes.</p><p>Mistress Volodya quickly declares with a strong accent that their ship has been stuck in a sea storm for a few days, and that they had to send some students back home due to seasickness, which explains the smallness of her delegation.</p><p>The Durmstrang students all look well behaved and are wearing red capes that are trimmed with fur. They wear a plain black buttoned-up shirt underneath it, black trousers, knee length boots, a red tie with their school’s crest embroidered on it and brown belts with a shiny silver buckle to complete their look.</p><p>Some are even wearing fur hats, which really is way too much considering the weather in Scotland right now. It seems the rumors were true though and that Durmstrang really is located in one of the northern regions of the world…</p><p>‟Is it me or do they all look as though they have a stick up their ass? ” asks Henry to no one in particular, while Elphias burst out laughing.</p><p>Aberforth, whose not sitting too far away from them once more, takes the opportunity to comment on that fact as well.‟That tall blonde in the rear looks so pompous. With his girly curls and that look, he probably does and doesn’t mind it.”</p><p>The three boys snort out loud as Albus glares at them with authority and throws them rolls from his side of the table in order to shut them up.</p><p>The Durmstrang students quickly sit down at the Slytherin table, while everyone in the room begin to talk at once.</p><p>Finally, the Triwizard Tournament could be set into motion.</p>
