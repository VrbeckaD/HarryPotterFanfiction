    <hr/><p>“Honestly, if that stupid bint of a barista moves any slower, we might as well just take a Portkey to Brazil and roast our own coffee beans!” Draco grumbled and scowled darkly when Pansy rolled her eyes at him.<br/> <br/> “It’s been ten minutes since we placed our order, have a little patience, Drake.” </p><p>“I will have no such thing. I need my coffee and I need it <em>now</em>. And for Merlin’s sake, <em>stop</em> butchering my name like that, Parkinson. You truly are an insufferable brat.”</p><p>“Salazar, you get really nasty when you need a caffeine fix, don’t you?”</p><p>Draco glared daggers and pointedly crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>“There’s absolutely no way it’s only been ten minutes,” he mumbled. His wand hand itched terribly and he very much wanted to throw a stinging hex at the barista in the hope it would make her move faster. Then again, judging by the snail-like speed with which she was operating the Italian espresso machine, he was quite certain that it would take a swarm of hornets to encourage her to produce more than one cup of coffee every five minutes.</p><p>“I swear, Parkinson, I could finish everyone’s coffee orders in a quarter of the time it takes her to complete one order!”</p><p>“I dare you!” Pansy said and glancing sideways, Draco frowned at his best friend, occasionally fake-girlfriend or sometimes even boyfriend, and long-standing partner-in-crime.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Pans, I’m not working here, I’m hardly going to commandeer the shop and start making coffee.”</p><p>“Because you can’t,” Pansy muttered under her breath and narrowing his eyes, Draco fixed her with an ice-cold death stare.</p><p>“What was that now, Parkinson?”</p><p>“You heard me, Drake. You have no idea how to work a coffee machine. You’d hex those Muggles on your first day. Within the first ten minutes probably,” Pansy chuckled and Draco gave her a black look.</p><p>“Well, isn’t that just lovely. Best friends for over two decades and you have zero faith in me.”</p><p>Pansy shrugged.<br/> <br/> “I know you, darling. You don’t have it in you. You’d give up on your very first day. That or you’ll end up in Azkaban for attacking a Muggle.” </p><p>“I would absolutely make it work!” Draco snapped.</p><p>“Want to make a bet?” Pansy teased.</p><p>Draco gave her a dirty look, held her gaze for the longest time, then broke it to glance at the barista. She hadn’t made any progress whatsoever.</p><p>“You’re on, Parkinson, I’ll prove you wrong.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Pansy said with feigned boredom and Draco felt the intense urge to hex her.</p><p>“One month, Drake, if you can last one month working in a coffee shop without getting yourself fired, hexing anyone or losing the plot, I’ll—”</p><p>“You’ll pay for your own shopping for a year,” Draco interrupted her and she regarded him carefully for several seconds, then nodded.</p><p>“Deal, Drake.”</p><p>She extended her hand and Draco shook it. He should have known then that Pansy had played him but she had wounded his pride and his brain needed coffee to function properly. How he had ever survived on tea alone was a mystery to him.</p>
