    <p>
  <span>“It’s a wrap for the day,” the director called out, and Harry felt like he could finally breathe again. They’d been at it for days, dragged in and out of this interview and that, everyone wanting a piece of him, of their story.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A </span>
  <em>
    <span>Press Junket</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the Ministry had called it, although Harry thought it was more like torture, and most days he’d rather trade it for one in the tent during their Horcrux hunt, when they were starving and surrounded by trees and fear. At least there he was with friends, and he could breathe fresh air, and he wasn’t confined to a couch or a high-backed chair, or sometimes a rocky stool.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The junket did have food though, lots of tarts and pies and chips, and Harry ate until he was past full. It had always been hard for him to not fill his belly after so many nights going without.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the beginning, Hermione and Ron had been there, answering questions, confident at his side. But then Hermione had gotten pregnant, unexpected but still exciting, and she and Ron had backed out. Neville had also escaped, blaming his upcoming position at Hogwarts as a valid excuse to avoid the cameras.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It left only he and Malfoy, both forced to participate if they wanted to still enter Auror training in the fall. The Ministry was encouraging the release of their stories, to build trust and promote transparency. Harry wondered if it was worth it, all the pressure of microphones and cameras and directors; if he still wanted to be an Auror after everything that had happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wondered how Malfoy felt about the whole thing. They spoke occasionally, usually exchanging pleasantries in between sets, the errant nod over the craft service table. Since the rest of the group had departed, and only the two of them remained, they’d even had a couple of decent conversations. Malfoy had mentioned how his father had always expected big things of him, and how much it would piss him off that Malfoy joined the very team that was holding him in Azkaban, but Harry thought there may be more to him joining their particular career path.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For Harry, it was a matter of restoring and keeping balance, of offering the protection he always wished he himself could have relied on. The need to constantly help.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He still felt that urge, that pull, but being forced into doing things against his will already, before he’d even joined, had made him question the very backbone of the department. It seemed a little soon to already have doubts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry hurried to the exit door, eager to get back to his flat and to the comfort of his bed, when he was swamped by the paparazzi. He tried to cover his scar in a feeble attempt to ruin their pictures, but he knew there was no use. He’d be there, front and center on every wizarding magazine whether he liked it or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last cover had screamed, “Chosen One Searches for His Chosen One,” with a picture of Harry leaving Fortescue's with two ice cream cones. Merlin forbid he bring his pregnant friend her favourite craving food of vanilla ice cream and pickles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The one before that had really irked him. “Golden Boy Dumps Girl,” with a large image of Ginny fleeing his flat, tears streaming down her cheeks. As if breaking up with his childhood sweetheart hadn’t been hard enough, he’d had to relive it even weeks later when he ducked into Flourish and Blotts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why everyone was so obsessed with who he was dating, Harry had no clue. Surely, just weeks after the end of the war, there were better things to talk about than who was in Harry’s bed. But if the camera flash that he regularly saw outside his flat was any indication, the press were no closer to tiring of Harry’s dating life than Harry was tired of being reminded of his celebrity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pushed a cameraman out of the way as he hurried to the Apparition point, wand gripped by his side, and with a final twist, he found himself in the safety of his home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do they bother you like this?” Harry asked Malfoy the next day, when security pulled a stray fan from the set of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Good Morning, Diagon!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes, Potter. Hardly a day goes by that the press isn’t asking me which bloke I’m shagging.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloke?” Harry swallowed, and reached for his glass of ice water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm,” Malfoy nodded. “Problem?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s just. Well, I didn’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s common knowledge around those of us who actually stayed and finished up our seventh year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry I missed class, Malfoy, I was out saving the world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please,” he rolled his eyes. “The Boy Who Lived Twice, I do declare!” Draco placed a delicate hand on his throat. “Let me just drop my knickers at your feet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Toss off,” Harry laughed and shoved Malfoy playfully in the shoulder. “So the press doesn’t follow you at all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say that,” Malfoy shrugged. “They’re just not worried about who I’m shagging, more who I’m threatening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Threatening?” Harry blinked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes, Dark Mark, Death Eater. I’m still a dangerous man, didn’t you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m terrified of you,” Harry grinned and took another sip of water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lights!” the director called, and Harry straightened his back, ready to begin another day of false smiles and fake laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, if it really bothers you, I have an idea,” Malfoy mentioned after a painful three-hour interview about how Harry felt walking into the forest, and how Malfoy survived with Voldemort in his home for six months.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Terrified, how do you think I felt?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“It was glorious, we braided each other’s hair and even got matching nose rings.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“An idea for what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get the paps off your back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The paps? What, are we nicknaming them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes,” Malfoy grinned. “I call that one over there Umbridge because he-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks like a toad, yes, I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway, my idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The one for the paps.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The brilliant one, yes,” Malfoy smirked. “We get them off of your back by saying you’re on mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry coughed aggressively. Malfoy tapped his shoulder with very little force.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There, there, Potter, didn’t mean to startle you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t,” Harry gasped, trying to catch his breath. “I just wasn’t ready for -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My proposition?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. That.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By making the paps think that you’re in a happy relationship, they might leave you alone. Happy people are boring,” Malfoy shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think we’d be happy?” Harry stared. He tried to envision it, the two of them holding hands, kissing under a streetlamp. The things he’d always seen happy couples do in the movies Petunia used to watch on the telly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s all pretend. Surely even you can pretend to be happy, Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But wouldn’t you-” Harry frowned. “Why aren’t you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“ In a relationship? Currently getting fucked up against a wall?” Malfoy stared as Harry spluttered. “No one wants a former Death Eater, no matter how good they look in the news.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just mean-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was just an idea. No need to get your knickers in a twist.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not wearing knickers, Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good to know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-----------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry couldn’t sleep that night. He kept tossing and turning, thinking of Malfoy’s proposition. On one hand, he knew he wasn’t ready to date, especially this soon after his breakup with Ginny. And while he was somewhere on the scale of homosexuality, he wasn’t sure that fake-dating Malfoy was exactly how he wanted the public to find out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He also couldn’t hide behind the fact that if they entered into this fake-but totally real-looking relationship that they would have to actually do things. Harry knew the papers wouldn’t stop until they witnessed them holding hands, or canoodling, or kissing. It wouldn’t be until their kisses became a constant that they would finally leave them alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thought about how it would feel to hold Malfoy’s hand while he was shopping at the market, or in between interviews. How it would feel to have Malfoy at his flat, eating dinner, maybe even leaving the next morning, if they were going to make the whole thing believable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How would it feel to have Malfoy’s lips on his own, whether they’d be soft and timid or hard and passionate. And how, as his hand dropped down to the hardening length of his cock, he’d have to start thinking of Malfoy as Draco instead. Especially as he tugged, thinking of blond hair and grey eyes and pale skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next morning Harry approached Mal-</span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco</span>
  </em>
  <span> with an extra large grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s do it,” Harry said, and Draco looked at him with his usual bored expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Brilliant,” he answered blandly, as though Harry had just suggested they split a croissant instead of form a fake-dating relationship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So how do we start,” Harry asked, nervously tapping his foot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We start by </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> getting </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> a coffee,” Draco murmured, running a hand through his hair as he prepared for the spotlight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day continued just like the day before, with makeup artists touching up his bronzer, and producers in his face, and directors in his ear shouting words like “Action!” and “Again, but this time look at the camera, Harry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept looking at Draco, who appeared as calm as the surface of the black lake. Harry, meanwhile, couldn’t stop shaking his knee and tapping his foot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, the director cut them for lunch, and Draco stared petulantly at him for the first time in four hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck, Potter,” he grunted, shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if I can do this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We haven’t even started.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But what if they find out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Find out what? That we’re not actually fucking? Are they photographing your sheets, looking for signs of both of our come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blushed and Draco chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They won’t find out, would you just relax?” Draco murmured low, and then -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he laced his fingers in Harry’s and squeezed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry could feel his cheeks tint even darker as Draco smirked at him, sipping his water as if it was just another day on-set.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were still holding hands when the producer made his rounds. His eyes went wide as he noted the small token of affection between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, is this a new development? Rita will definitely want to cover this in her next segment. Would you feel comfortable talking about your relationship on </span>
  <em>
    <span>Skeeter Speaks</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, I guess so?” Harry stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, absolutely,” Draco concurred, lifting their joined hands in confirmation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-----------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As all of the Wizarding World knows, Harry Potter and I have a very trusting relationship, isn’t that right, Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Erm,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re quite old friends, and since we’re so close, darling Harry has decided to announce something very exciting and very private on my show!” Rita continued, oblivious to Harry’s awkward glances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what special news have you decided to ONLY share on my show, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Skeeter Speaks</span>
  </em>
  <span>, because we have such a wonderful relationship, Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I guess,” Harry started.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and Mr. Malfoy here are in a loving and caring relationship! I, for one, am so excited for the both of you,” Rita exclaimed, glancing quickly at Draco but then diverting her attention back at Harry. “And to come on my show, and provide us an exclusive because you and I are such good friends!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t exactly,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, we are in a relationship,” Draco nodded, reaching for Harry’s hand. “We’re so in love, and we’re so excited to celebrate with you, Rita, our closest friend!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rita grinned to the point where Harry thought her lipstick would spread over her entire face. “Yes, close friends, aren’t we, Draco! And we’re so happy for you both! Now give us a kiss!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes darted from Rita’s to Draco’s in a panic. He knew they’d have to kiss eventually, but now? Here? With the cameras rolling? They had only just held hands, and this all seemed to be moving too fast and-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got you,” Draco leaned in and murmured in his ear before pressing his lips softly onto Harry’s own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry barely had a chance to close his eyes before the kiss was over, his head tilting forward as Draco retreated. Draco smiled sweetly at Rita, and the sight of it made Harry feel nauseous, and weak, and unsure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew he needed to talk to Draco and set some guidelines before they continued, but first, he had to get through this god-awful interview.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, well Rita, we’re just super happy, and our lives are pretty boring, so there’s really not much else to tell!” Harry attempted his most genuine smile, hoping to speed the interview along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-----------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Subtle,” Draco smirked after the director called a wrap. “Super realistic. I especially loved that bit at the end about how we mostly just listen to the wireless and eat soup.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted us to sound boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You made us sound comatose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we see if they bought it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco threaded his fingers into Harry’s and opened the door to flashing lights and their names screamed into the wind.</span>
