    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Frederick Connelly was enjoying his tea while he patiently waited for his daughter Selene to come downstairs. His shoulder length red hair was unkempt and there was a hole in the shoulder of his blue robe. It was a beautiful morning. A pleasant breeze blew through the open window, carrying with it the birds' morning song. He glanced at the picture on the mantle above the fireplace. A beautiful woman with raven black hair and ice blue eyes was laughing and pointing at something out of frame. Like many of the pictures in the house this one moved and would occasionally smile and wave at those who looked at it. With a sigh and a slightly sad smile Frederick began speaking softly to the picture, as if the woman could really hear him.</p><p>"It's finally time, Kelly. I'm a little worried how things will go…but if anyone can make it work out, she can. I was worried in the beginning. After we lost you…when she just stopped talking, I didn't know what to do. I used to get so frustrated…wishing she would say something, anything. I kept waiting for her to yell or scream. To rage at the loss of her mother, to cry and break things, just like I felt like doing. But no, she just went quiet. I blame you for that, you know. You almost always reacted in a way that was surprising to me. So when she stopped talking, I didn't know what to do. I waited and then, when I got tired of waiting, I tried pushing her to talk. But she would just shake her head no…no…and when I saw her tears I realized she was hurting too. She was hurting, just as I was hurting. We both missed you so much, we simply showed it in different ways. And as time passed, we found other ways for her to communicate. She learned how to sign words with her hands. She learned so fast she ended up giving me extra lessons!" he chuckled. "I'm not sure how she will cope with leaning spells, but there is no denying her magic. Why, just last night she somehow managed to summon the biscuits off the top shelf when I sent her to bed with no dessert! Luckily, I caught them before they made it down the hall." He smiled lovingly, "I see so much of you in her. You would be proud of how she has grown. I just hope she is able to progress in Hogwarts. She wants to make you proud, and going to the same school we did seems important to her."</p><p>Just then Selene came staggering into the kitchen, blearily wiping sleep from her eyes. Her waist length hair was the same blue-black as a raven's wings, and she had the same ice blue eyes as her mother. Black dressing robe untied with a shirt declaring in bold letters <em>The Singing Sorceress</em> showing through. She flopped onto a seat at the table and smiled at her dad when he poured her a fresh cup of tea.</p><p>"Morning, Star-shine." Frederick said. He rose and gathered a plate of food from the counter, canceling the warming charm left on it with a simple flick of his wand. He slid the plate in front of Selene and then proceeded to make another pot of tea. "I know you just got up, but did you think about why I sent you to bed early last night?" he looked up to see her nod her head yes. "And do you have anything to say after what happened yesterday?" he asked sternly.</p><p>*I'm sorry, Father.* Selene signed. *I shouldn't have taken Darcy out flying yesterday by myself. You asked me to wait until you were done with your potions work for the day but I was too impatient. I promise to think more about my actions before making decisions in the future*</p><p>"Why does that just sound like you are promising to be sneakier and not get caught?" Frederick grumbled as he sat back down at the table. Selene just smirked at him and continued eating. "Anyway, you should probably hurry up with your breakfast. We have a busy day today."</p><p>Selene tilted her head to the side questioningly, *Why? I thought we were just going to work in the gardens today.*</p><p>"Well we could do that, but I rather thought you might want to go with me to Diagon Alley. I have to drop off a shipment to Mr. Jiggs at the apothecary. He owled this morning to say he was low on bicorn horn and tentacula leaves. You know how important it is he stay well stocked this close to the start of school term." Frederick noticed how disappointed Selene looked at the mention of school. He cleared his throat and sat up straighter. "There is something else we need to talk about first though. Your acceptance letter from Hogwarts came with the post this morning." Selene's fork clattered to her plate, her face showing nothing but shock. Frederick continued, "I know we get on well enough here, but you understand most people don't know sign language."</p><p>Selene nodded and hastily pulled out a small notebook from her robe pocket. She tapped it slightly with her other hand.</p><p>"That will work for some things, but much of the school curriculum is based off verbal spells." He paused when he realized Selene was frowning at him but then rushed on to say, "I'm sure you will do great in Herbology and Potions, you already know so much from helping me out here. I'm just worried for how you might handle your other classwork.</p><p>Selene crossed her arms and stared at her dad for a few moments before sighing *I want to try. I want to go to school like you and Mom. I will just have to work hard and find a way. If I can't keep up…then I guess I will come back home and learn what I can from you. But, I have to try.*</p><p>Frederick thought a moment and then smiled, handing over the acceptance letter, "Your mom believed anything was possible, and hated to be told she couldn't do something. If you are determined to make things work, then I'm sure you will find a way."</p><p>Selene ripped open the letter, reading the first few lines rapidly:</p><p>
  <em>Dear Miss Connelly,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are pleased to inform you, you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry…</em>
</p><p>Selene jumped up, knocking her chair over in her haste to get around to her father's side. She hugged him tightly and when she stepped back she had a huge grin on her face. *You really mean it? You are letting me go?*</p><p>He ruffled her hair affectionately and laughed, "Yes, you can go. Now hurry and get ready. We leave in half an hour."</p><p>Selene clapped her hands in excitement before speeding off to go get dressed for the day. A door slammed upstairs and Frederick shook his head, a small smile playing on his lips. He walked over to the mantle and picked up the picture of his wife Kelly. "I will write Headmaster Dumbledore later to thank him for allowing her to attend, knowing her circumstances. Seeing how happy she is to even be allowed to try to attend…it makes it all worth the risk." He kissed the frame gently, placed it back on the mantle, and walked off with a wave. "This leaves me just enough time to get dressed and talk to Zooby about what I need packed. Good thing no one requested anything that needs brewing today."</p><p>Half an hour later, Frederick was waiting by the front door. He looked very different from how he was at breakfast. Dressed in well pressed slacks, white button down shirt and a steel grey vest, he looked every bit like the stark business man. He pulled a silver pocket watch out and checked the time, closing it with a soft click. "Star-shine! Let's go. We can't be late!" he yelled. He heard Selene as she practically ran down the spiral staircase into the main living room. She was dressed in a full floor-length skirt, a soft white poet shirt with a cream colored vest that matched her skirt. Her hair was brushed to a shine and her eyes nearly sparkled with her excitement. She came to a stop and did a little spin before looking as him questioningly. "Yes, you look beautiful. Now, do you have your supplies list?" he asked. She tapped a small bag at her side with a smile and he continued, "Good, then we can go." He reached towards the door but was stopped by Selene's hand on his elbow. "What? Am I forgetting something?"</p><p>Selene nodded, then snapped her fingers twice. There was a soft pop and a house elf appeared. She was dressed in a uniform made from black tea towels tied in a toga-like fashion, a large green "C" was embroidered into the front. "Young Miss needs Tinsel?" the house elf asked in a high, squeaky voice. Selene made a few quick signs. "Yes, Young Miss! Tinsel will be right back." And before you would say "butterbeer" she was back with a set of black over-robes and a dark green ribbon.</p><p>"Now really! Must I wear those? It's warm out today and those robes always make me itch." Frederick asked, and no he most definitely was not whining at all. Selene simply handed him the robes and pointed down towards the floor. Frederick sighed and knelt down, shrugging on the robes as he did so. "I never should have taught you about Pureblood customs." He grumbled as she tied his hair back with the ribbon. "Bloody inconvenient is what they are."</p><p>*You know certain clients respond better when you follow the customs. You taught me how wearing the mask and playing the Game has its benefits.* Selene signed to her father, then turned to thank Tinsel.</p><p>As if on some unheard cue, another house elf appeared with a much louder POP. "Master and Young Miss will be late." the wizened looking elf said in a gravelly voice. "Zooby has packed what Master required. Zooby wishes Master and Young Miss safe travel." He tossed the case towards Frederick, who caught it with a practiced ease. "Zooby must go add fertilizer to Greenhouse Four." with that he bowed and then vanished with another POP.</p><p>Tinsel shook her head with a fond smile and started ushering them out the door. "Master and Young Miss be almost late. They has lots to do and buy. Tinsel must get started on the draperies. Tinsel wishes Master and Young Miss safe travels." and she shut the door on them.</p><p>"I blame you. If you didn't indulge them so often I wouldn't have such willful servants. I'm probably the only master to be bossed around by his own house-elves." Frederick grumbled. Selene just smiled at him and took his hand. "Yes, I know…we wouldn't want them any other way." He walked with her quickly, across the grounds until they passed through the gate. He checked his watch one more time. "Ok. Mr. Jiggs is expecting us in 30 seconds. You ready?" Selene nodded and hugged her father tightly. "Don't let go." he warned. One second they were standing outside the gate to their home, the next they appeared in a small room in the back of Slug and Jiggers Apothecary.</p><p>Mr. Jiggs was standing in the doorway. "Punctual as ever Mr. Connelly. And you brought your daughter along this time too! How lovely." He was a portly and balding man with greasy skin and a nasally voice. Selene did not like the man…not that she would ever show it of course. He was a valued client of her father's. Mr. Jiggs leaned down in front of her and spoke in a ridiculously loud voice. "How are you today?! Good?!"</p><p>Selene just smiled sweetly and walked past him. She went to stand outside the shop while her dad conducted his business. She hated that shop. It smelled like bad eggs and rotten cabbaged mixed. The greenhouses and storage areas at home never smelled that bad. But Slug and Jiggers were solid, constant clients who always paid fair for the ingredients her father sold them, so she couldn't really complain.</p><p>Diagon Alley was teaming with people. Families were out in mass trying to get all the shopping done for the start of the next school term. Parents yelled after their kids, who ran ahead in all the excitement, darting from the window of Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, to Quality Quidditch Supplies, or darting into Gambol and Japes to stock up on prank supplies. It was chaos. Stall venders shouting out their wares, trying to attract buyers. Depending on which way the wind blew, you could either smell the rotten smell of the Apothecary, or warm bread from the Leaky Cauldron down the street, or any number of other fragrances coming from one of the stalls. Over it all was the hum of many voices raised in excitement.</p><p>A bell jingled and her father stepped out of the store, quickly shrinking his case and tucking it into one of his many coat pockets. "Well, that's done. And he gave us such a fair payment that we don't even have to stop at Gringotts." he said with a smile. "So how about we get out that list and work our way down the street?" he paused and looked around. "No telling who we might meet today. Looks like everyone is out." He took a deep breath and stood a little taller. "Shall we play the Game?" Selene nodded, straightened her shoulders and lifted her head a little higher. Frederick couldn't resist leaning down to whisper, "But when we get home, we relax and get out of these stuffy clothes. We can have dinner and celebrate you getting accepted properly, ok?"</p><p>Again Selene nodded and would have looked bored to anyone who didn't notice the mirth in her eyes. *You just want an excuse to be lazy the rest of the day instead of working.*</p><p>Frederick huffed softly before straightening back up. He set off down the street, walking with measured steps. Seeing him walking with such purpose naturally made people step to the side as they approached. Selene allowed a small smirk as she followed in her father's wake. This was all part of the Game. All Purebloods were masters of it. Any politician or serious business man also knew the Game. It was moves and counter-moves. A constant dance between speaking one thing and meaning another. Demanding respect and giving respect when it was due. Knowing when your partner outranked you and trying to outplay their hand. The Connelly family may not have been part of the "Sacred Twenty-eight" pureblood families, but they had been well respected as purveyors of some of the finest quality potions ingredients (both plant and animal based) for 15 generations. They had earned their place of respect as strong businessmen; when out in public Frederick had taught Selene the proper customs and traditions to use when playing the Game. Personally he was often annoyed by it, which is why at home they allowed tradition to drop and just be themselves. After four years of coaching and lessons, Selene was proud to say she had learned the proper customs…she might even say she followed them better than her father (he would probably agree).</p><p>The morning went by very quickly and with little incident. Selene was thrilled when her wand chose her (a beautiful but simple pear wood wand with a gold filigree handle, unicorn hair core, twelve inches), and felt like a princess when being fitted for her school robes. At Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment, they picked up her new telescope and a set of brass scales. While they were there they also found a beautiful solid oak trunk that would switch between 5 separate storage spaces with just a tap of your wand and responded only to your personal magical signature once set (guaranteed to last all your years at Hogwarts and beyond or your money back). At Florish and Blotts they purchased a full set of first year course books and found a book called <em>Spell Me Speechless: A Comprehensive Guide to Nonverbal Casting</em> that looked helpful.</p><p>It was well past lunch when they walked into their final stop at Eeylops Owl Emporium. It was only dimly lit and all around were the sounds of wings rustling and the soft hooting of the many owls of the shop. At the counter, a very aristocratic looking man stood with his son. They were obviously in the process of buying a very large eagle owl. At the sound of the shop door opening, they had turned to see who was walking in. The Connelly's paused only long enough for their eyes to adjust before Frederick led the way to greet a person who could only be Lucius Malfoy. "Lord Malfoy, pleasure to see you here. I sent the ingredients you requested by owl this morning. I trust you found them satisfactory?" Frederick asked in a polite yet confident voice.</p><p>"They were adequate, Mr. Connelly. I needed them for Draco's school supplies. He is starting Hogwarts this year." Mr. Malfoy said. He somehow managed to sound appreciative yet superior all at the same time.</p><p>"This is my daughter, Selene. She will be starting this year as well." Frederick gestured toward Selene, who gave a slight bow of her head, smiled and made a few quick signs. "She says it is a pleasure to meet you Lord Malfoy and Draco." Frederick translated swiftly.</p><p>"Indeed." Mr. Malfoy said, his face looked somewhat pinched. He studied Selene for a moment before turning back towards her father. "It's surprising to me that you would allow such a…precious…daughter to go to Hogwarts. Surely some other school might be a better fit?" he drawled.</p><p>Selene made sure to keep her face a mix of boredom and polite smiling, even though on the inside she was outraged.</p><p>Mr. Malfoy continued as if he was talking about something as bland as the weather "I originally wanted to send Draco to Durmstrang but Lady Malfoy could not bear it if he was so far away. I suppose you wouldn't have to worry about dealing with a mother's instincts though." He tossed some Galleons on the counter and grabbed the eagle owl's cage. "Say goodbye to the Connelly's, Draco." He strolled out of the shop without a backwards glance.</p><p>Draco, the pale, pointy faced boy who had been looking at Selene with a curious expression said, "Maybe I will see you at school? Goodbye, Mr. Connelly." and then rushed out after his father.</p><p>Frederick let out a slow breath, waving in response to the shopkeeper asking if they needed any help. He looked at Selene and raised one eyebrow, silently asking if she was alright. She nodded and then began to look around the shop. There were owls of all shapes and sizes, several small elf owls, a few large eagle owls, and even one gorgeous snowy owl. She continued to make her way around the shop, studying the different types of owls carefully. A loud screech combined with a whistle came from a back corner, drawing her attention. A single cage set slightly apart from the others with a sign reading <em>I BITE</em>. In the cage was a larger than usual barn owl. When it noticed her approach it shuffled forward, raising its wings and bobbing its head. It let out an almost continuous hiss, doing its best to look menacing.</p><p>"Be careful miss, that one has a temper." The shopkeeper called.</p><p>Selene took another step towards the cage and smiled. The barn owl hissed some more, flapping its' wings, and then screeched. Selene tilted her head and put a few fingers into the cage. She smiled reassuringly and kept her gaze locked with the owl. The owl shrieked and darted forward as if to bite but Selene didn't move. This seemed to confuse the owl, who immediately stopped hissing and tiled its head one way and then the other (as if looking at the situation upside down would make more sense). After a short time it gave a small chirrup and bowed its head, allowing Selene to pet it. Selene smiled and looked back at her father.</p><p>"We will take that one." Frederick said to the stunned shopkeeper. "The cage, some feed and treats, and any other supplies you might recommend as well, please."</p><p>"You don't even pay me for that bird. Hatched him myself and he has never taken to anyone like that, including me! He is meant to go with that little lady. Just pay me for the rest and take that pesky bird out of here." The shopkeeper said, still looking stunned.</p><p>A short time and a wild ride on the Knight bus later, the Connellys breathed a sigh of relief to be standing outside the gate to their estate. The newly named "Heckle" ruffled his feathers and nipped at the bars to his cage, clearly anxious to be freed after such a harrowing ride. Frederick laughed, "Well, go show him where he can stay in the barn and introduce him to Zooby and my owl Bubo. Then come wash up for dinner. You can pack your trunk properly later."</p><p>Selene nodded, sat Heckle's cage down and opened the latch. Heckle took the sky with a victorious screech, circling overhead while he waited for his new mistress. Selene turned, hugged her father close, and then whispered "Thank you." She gathered her skirts and started running towards the barn. Heckle began darting and diving around her and Selene laughed with joy.</p><p>Frederick smiled a soft, slightly sad smile at Tinsel who had appeared to take the packages to Selene's room. "Tinsel is happy to hear Young Miss laugh. Master and Young Miss must have had a good day." she said softly, then vanished with the packages with a simple snap of her fingers.</p><p>Frederick walking into the house, shedding the more "itchy" layers of clothing as he went. In his private study, he poured himself a shot of firewhiskey and sat in the chair behind his desk. On the corner of this desk was another picture of Kelly. In this one she was curled up on a couch in front of a fire, reading a book. She would look up every so often and smile before continuing her reading. "She laughed and even talked to me a little today, Kelly." Frederick whispered. "Even after all the stress of the day and Malfoy insulting her, she still felt good enough to laugh out loud and whisper to me. It's so rare to hear even that much from her." tears fell from his eyes and he took a bracing sip of the firewhiskey. "Maybe her going to Hogwarts will be a really good thing. Maybe it can help her heal in a way I couldn't. Maybe making friends will let her laugh more. Even if she still never speaks in public…if this can make her relaxed and happy enough at home…I will do everything in my power to make it work."</p>
