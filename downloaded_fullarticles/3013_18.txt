    <p>Newt Scamander sat alone on the bench at platform 9 ¾. He’d owled his parents days before, and yet still he sat cuddling his scarf close to himself, and counting down the minutes till he could call upon the Knight Bus.</p><p>Or could he even call the Knight Bus? Technically, he still had his wand but with the amount of trace currently on him until the hearing, he was told something as simple as ‘lumos’ would expedite the whole banned process and essentially excommunicate from this world altogether. </p><p>He had never been particularly bothered by the premise of being alone. It was quiet, and quite frankly comfortable. He had never considered his solitude to be anything but beneficial... until he had to sulk in it. For as much as he ignored the status quo of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he would miss it. And if the hearing went wrong, he'd miss magic. </p><p>“Aren’t you cold?”</p><p>One of the Bowtruckles who’d opted to leave the Hogwarts countryside---- Pickett, had popped out of his front shirt pocket and resided on his shoulder to respond to Newt's question. He didn’t do anything, rather just looked at Newt. Usually, between the pair Newt was the quiet one, but for the first time in his life he didn’t feel like being quiet. Frankly, he felt like crying, but the tears just wouldn’t materialize. Pickett was the rational one in this duo, and simply used his beady eyes to express what words would fail.</p><p>“I think I’ve really done it now, Pick.” Newt continued, sadly. Aside from Pickett, he was truly alone. He’d been thoroughly searched on his way out of Hogwarts--- and all of his animals found given to some magical law enforcement who would surely treat them as exhibits rather than intelligent creatures. The only one who was able to slide by undetected was Pickett, but even Newt could tell he didn’t like the new scenery change. And Newt didn't like abandoning his friends either---- who would feed the Doxy's? Keep the Imp's out of trouble? Maybe Professor Folwel was right, Newt Scamander was more trouble than he was worth.</p><p>When Pickett refused to indulge him, and Newt's thoughts were doing him no favors he made the unwise choice to join the world around him--- even if only as a third party. There were few other people on the platform, but none stopped to wonder about the boy talking to his sleeve. Some however, talked of him.</p><p>“Did you hear of that Scamander boy? Terrible tragedy. And after that business with his parents, no less!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, but it didn’t affect his brother, now did it? I tell you, there’s always one in the brood…”</p><p>Maybe this wasn't really his world anyway.</p><p>Newt sighed and allowed the back of his head to hit the wall. Where would he go from here?</p><p>How would he get home? He didn’t have any muggle money, and he couldn’t apparate without getting arrested. And his parents, well… eventually, he’d have to come to terms with that. There was a reason his owl was never returned, and at some point he'd have to stop blaming poor postage.</p><p>Maybe he’d walk. To where, he didn’t know, but he did know that staying here was out of the question.</p><p>“Come on, Pick.” Pickett gave him a look, but hopped back into his pocket regardless. He was sixteen, and somewhere around third year had traded all the space for clothes in his suitcase for comfortable living room for his animals. But now, he had an empty suitcase, a lonesome Pickett, and a wand that would not be his for much longer. Suffice to say his options were limited.</p><p>Regardless, Newt gathered his things, and began to walk out. He didn't have a plan, but frankly anywhere was better than here. Maybe he'd find fare to Hogsmeade and get there in time for the birth of those new Skrewts. Maybe he'd go the cemetery by his old home, where the name 'Scamander' was written in stone. Maybe he'd just walk until the path ended, he wasn't really sure of anything other than he couldn't stay here any longer. Before he could make the turn into the wall, another body materialized, blocking his exit.</p><p>He could only register the auburn hair, and sensible ministry apparel before he felt the embrace. Long, strong arms wrapped around his entire form, and within his own right to shock and the fact he had bags in both hands he did not return the sentiment.</p><p>Theseus.</p><p>He hadn’t told him, and he’d even asked Dumbledore not to reach out. Maybe it was guilt, stubbornness, or perhaps a mixture of both but he hadn't wanted Theseus to answer his call.</p><p>But right now, with nothing but a train that would no longer take him, and hollow suitcases that held a world who no longer wanted him, he was really glad his brother was so relentless.</p><p>“<em>Newt.</em>” Theseus whispered. There was pain behind the word. Pain, sorrow, and a fair amount of chastise which Newt assumed his brother was saving for later. It was a word he was used to being tethered to a sigh of discontent, or perhaps even shame---- but never such despair. </p><p>He hadn't meant to be a burden. In fact, he had maturely decided to go about this on his own. Apparently, Theseus had come to a different conclusion. </p><p>“I---I’m sorry, I didn't know, I thought----“ </p><p>“I know, Newt.” Theseus broke apart, and with his red rimmed eyes and haphazard hair Newt could tell he’d been frantic today. Theseus was a man who was rarely disheveled, and in this moment he looked almost like a different, incredibly unhinged man. Maybe it was about their parents. Maybe it was about the war. Maybe it was about <em>him</em>. But in that moment, Newt felt that he needed Theseus as desperately as Theseus needed him. "I know."</p><p>Newt nodded sadly, and redirected his eyes at the ground. He hadn't meant for things to go this way. For the Jarvey, for himself, for Leta... And now he was dragging his brother down with him. Animals weren't this complicated. It was his human side that was self-destructing. But if this were the price he had to pay to save Leta from the same fate, then he would accept it. Maybe Hogwarts wasn't the place for him. Maybe he hadn't found his place yet. </p><p>In his pocket, Pickett cooed quietly and Newt had to agree. He'd very much like to be home now.</p><p>“Let’s go home, Newt.” Theseus broke the silence, and finally, the embrace. He looked worse than Newt could remember ever seeing him, and even still he looked upon Newt like a brother instead of a delinquent as he'd been called as much in the past day. Theseus grabbed the first suitcase, pulled his wand from his jacket, and together the two brothers exited the platform, and returned to the face the world. For as much strife as the world would cause them, there was comfort in the knowledge it would be combated together. </p>
