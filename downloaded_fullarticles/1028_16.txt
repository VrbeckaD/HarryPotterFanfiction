          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Lie to me”, I ask.</p><p>You lift your gaze from the chessboard in front of you and scratch your chin, thoughtful. The white queen huffs in annoyance. You haven’t moved her once.</p><p>“I think the Chudley Cannons have a fair chance this year”. You say, sending your knight to its death. </p><p>My lips twitch, while I strike. “Checkmate”.</p><p>“Looks like I’m winning!” You declare.</p><p>You play the part, your excitement almost convincing. Your hand reaches for a pawn. It’s the wrong move. The queen intercepts your wandering fingers and bites down hard, on your pinky. She clearly thinks you are an idiot. This time, I almost smile.</p><p> </p><p>Lies. They look at me, and tell me I am brave. Like I have a choice. They mean well, but I don’t believe them. </p><p> </p><p>“Lie to me” I demand. </p><p>I found you in the garden. The rain is light, yet your drenched clothes tell me you have been out here for a while. I don’t ask, but when I sit next to you I make sure our shoulders touch. I can feel my arm getting wet but I don’t move, and neither do you. </p><p>“That,” you reply, pointing to a frog sheltering under the rusty pile of chairs by the shed “Is a prince. I kissed him once. Said he wasn’t interested”</p><p>This, I don’t believe. I’ve been at the receiving end of your kisses, and it would be an understatement to say one ought to be affected. </p><p>“The Royals have standards, don’t take it personally ”. I say, instead. </p><p>“I don’t. And commoners are better kissers, anyway” you tell me. </p><p>The frog croaks, as if offended, and hops away. You laugh and the rain slides on your lips. </p><p>I proceed to show you how true your assertion really is.</p><p> </p><p>They tell me it will get better. Sometimes I think I want it to be true. Sometimes I am exhausted. It’s not what I need. Because now, in this moment, it just really fucking hurts. I don’t want their lies. </p><p> </p><p>“Lie to me” I pray. </p><p>My cheeks are wet, my eyes sting. </p><p>You don’t ask, just walk into the room and sit at the end of the bed. </p><p>I can’t see your face, but when you tilt your neck towards the ceiling I can imagine the dreamy expression in your pretty eyes. </p><p>“When I was eight I wanted to be a professional ballerina. I used to sneak out at night and try on Dudley’s tutu”. </p><p>Your voice is levelled. Even when you stand up and pirouette around the room, your expression remains solemn.</p><p>I muffle my laugh in the covers. I don’t know what’s more ridiculous: you, dancing on an invisible stage, or the idea of your obnoxious cousin in a frilly skirt. </p><p>You land a particularly impressive jump with a bow, and grin at me. I take your hand and drag you into my sanctuary.<br/>
If, in the fever of the night, I forget to tell you I am falling quite in love with you, it doesn’t make it any less true. </p><p> </p><p>They say I will be happy again. It’s a lie this, that everyday sounds a little more true. </p><p> </p><p>“Lie to me”.</p><p>“Trelawney was my favourite teacher”.</p><p> </p><p>“Lie to me”.</p><p>“Ron received an owl from Witch Weekly. He has been nominated sexiest war hero. I believe they will title the article He is a keeper”.</p><p> </p><p>Lie to me.<br/>
Lie to me.<br/>
Lie to me.</p><p> </p><p>Today is difficult. Some days are better, others are like today. </p><p>I hear a faint rustle coming from the kitchen and soon you appear carrying a tray of biscuits. They are burnt, one of todays failures. You kick your shoes under the sofa and collapse on the armchair in front of mine. </p><p>I don’t say anything and watch as your teeth sink into one the biscuits, inciting an ominous crunch.<br/>
“Those are. . .” You say, with a grimace “truly disgusting”.</p><p>I let out a wet chuckle and our eyes meet.</p><p>“Tell me the truth” I beg. </p><p>“George” you tell me, and your voice is a soft caress “Fred is dead”.</p><p>They won’t say it. They don’t talk about it, just look at me with their eyes full of pity. I don’t need that. </p><p>“He is not coming back, right?”<br/>
I feel silly, asking you. You that have lost so much. </p><p>“No” you say, simply.</p><p>I asked you to lie, your silly, funny lies. I’ve asked you, because I knew that for big things, important things, you would never lie to me. And with you, I can handle the truth. </p><p>I hide myself in your arms. You kiss my hair and whisper “I got you”.</p><p>And I believe you. </p><p>I believe I can be brave.</p><p>I believe it will get better.</p><p>I believe I can be happy. </p><p>And when I am not, when I can’t, I know that you got me. </p><p>So, lie to me.<br/>
Tell me all your absurd stories and ludicrous secrets.<br/>
I know that, when I am ready, you will tell me the truth.</p></div>
