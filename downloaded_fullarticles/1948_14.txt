</center><p>Kidnapping, even with the use of magic, was a difficult business. Even after you had your victim neatly captured by <em>Incarcerous</em>, there was also the matter of transporting a physically restrained body through public passageways without detection.</p><p>Draco hadn’t ever used <em>Incarcerous</em> in a sustained way before, either, and he found that he was nervously watching the softly glowing bindings as though they’d disappear any moment. To soothe his anxiety, he Transfigured a shoelace into an unnecessary amount of rope and wound it tightly around Potter the old-fashioned way. At the same time, he had to ignore Potter’s moans, interspersed with terse threats, and his own wrenching gut.</p><p>His father had always said he had his mother’s soft-heartedness, and Draco was ashamed to know it was true. Like Narcissa, he was quick to form bonds and long to mourn betrayal. And look at the mess all that clap had gotten him into.</p><p>Now, he had to focus on the task at hand or he would curl up in a corner and cry. He just wanted to go back into the darkness and hear Jay’s voice. Not stupid Potter’s voice saying things like, “You said you <em>loved</em> me.”</p><p>That one drew Draco up short. He was crouched close to Potter, cinching the rope tighter around his calves. Potter now looked like a creature emerging headfirst from a cocoon. Draco thought, distantly, that he could probably stop adding rope.</p><p>“I did,” Draco sniffed, standing back up, and kicked Potter’s bound legs halfheartedly. Potter winced, the big baby.</p><p>“Then how can you do this?” Potter demanded.</p><p>Draco sniffed. “First of all, I didn’t know who I was talking to.” That train of thought was dangerously emotional, so, blinking rapidly, Draco changed tactics. “It’s your fault, now that I think about it,” he amended in a steadier voice, “If I’d spent all that time fixing the Vanishing Cabinet, instead of talking to <em>you</em>, I wouldn’t be this desperate.”</p><p>Potter gaped. Clearly he had no idea what Draco was talking about, but even his understandable ignorance chafed. Draco had thought he was on the cusp of having someone who was <em>his</em>, who truly understood him...and it was <em>Potter</em> all along.</p><p>Draco kicked him again, and harder this time. Potter didn’t flinch. He turned his head away listlessly, and neither of them said anything else. Draco levitated him a short distance to where he’d left the Invisibility Cloak, which Draco then arranged over Potter. It was easier to bear the situation when he couldn’t see Potter’s dejected face staring into the middle distance.</p><p>He hoped the Dark Lord was eager for his prize, and it would be a quick hand-off. Steeling himself to face his father—thinking, at least, Lucius would be <em>freed</em>, and his mother would be safe—Draco set out into the corridors with his strongest Silencing Charm in place and prayed for safe passage to Professor Snape’s office and the open Floo.</p>

    <em>1996, July</em>

</center><p>Draco had always loved the summers. While Slytherin was a home away from home, and he enjoyed constant power struggles as much as any member of his House, he loved being at the Manor best of all.</p><p>It wasn’t the general opulence, and all the comforts, though they didn’t hurt. The Slytherin dormitories had probably seemed luxurious a thousand years earlier—or whenever the school was founded, precisely—but by modern standards they were quite primitive. Still, they had been a second home so long, Draco rarely turned his nose up at anything anymore. And he was a Malfoy: being in the dungeons made him feel close to all the past generations of Malfoys to have slept and dreamed and laughed and suffered anxiety attacks from exams within those walls.</p><p>It was walking the gardens in mid-morning and watching the crups scatter the gnomes. It was going room to room past portraits with whom he had inside jokes dating back to when he was five years old. It was sitting by the fire in his father’s study reading a book while his father returned letters, and recalling falling asleep in his lap on those same sorts of evenings as a toddler, drugged by the scent of ink.</p><p>It was his mother, undoubtedly. Draco wouldn’t apologize for enjoying being spoiled.</p><p>But this summer was different, of course, in Lucius’ absence. Narcissa had begun all their traditions with a determined cheeriness that Draco found deeply suspect. He was bewildered by the reality that it was up to him to support her, and not the other way around. It wasn’t that he was unwilling, only that he was perfectly ill-equipped. When she affectionately batted aside his efforts to talk to her about his father or the brewing war, he let her do it.</p><p>Of course, whether they talked about it or not, events were in motion. Lucius had stood for the family before, but just because he was no longer available, didn’t mean the Dark Lord would forget the Malfoys. Draco knew it was cowardice, but he almost hoped the Dark Lord <em>would </em>forget them; after all, if Lucius hadn’t been able to elevate the family in the Dark Lord’s eyes, Draco certainly couldn’t be expected to do so in his place.</p><p>But in the end, it wasn’t up to Draco. The Dark Lord called on Malfoy Manor in the early summer, on a hot, starry evening. He was heralded by Draco’s Aunt Bella.</p><p>A few minutes before all the fog was cast from Draco’s life, revealing his destiny in all its terrible clarity, he was lying on a chaise lounge on the third-story veranda with his mother, stargazing.</p><p>“There’s Arcturus,” Draco said, pointing toward the reddish star which was still bright, though not as shocking so as it had been in June.</p><p>“Do you remember how to find Spica?” Narcissa murmured. Their chaises were drawn close together, and she reached out easily to touch Draco’s hair, stroking it back from his forehead with cool fingertips.</p><p>“Yes,” Draco said, turning his face slightly toward her touch, then pointed again, though from her vantage point the sweep of his hand meant nothing. “Along the Plough,” he said quietly, narrowing his eyes on the row of stars above his fingertip. “‘Arc to Arcturus, then speed on to Spica.’”</p><p>They always did this when the moon was at its weakest; pajama-clad and absently passing back and forth a silver tray of snacks which the elves occasionally appeared to refill. A clear night in the fall was the best opportunity, but of course they’d been strictly relegated to the summers and brief holidays for years now. It had less to do with picking out the details of the certain stars after which his mother’s family had a penchant for naming their babies, and more to do with the long periods of companionable silence in between.</p><p>Those evenings were the closest Draco had gotten to feeling at peace since he received word of his father’s arrest. So he should have known, the way his luck ran, that they’d be interrupted by the gong-like chiming of the Floo.</p><p>“Who…?” Draco sat up. His mother did the same, more slowly, and stared down the French doors that led back into the house with a hard, watchful expression.</p><p>Draco had yet to get used to the sight of his Aunt, though she’d been dropping in frequently since the previous summer. Though her nearly black eyes had lost some of their sparkle since she’d fallen into the shadow of the Malfoys’ disfavor, they retained a manic gleam as she met Narcissa’s stare.</p><p>“Sister,” said Bellatrix. Draco couldn’t help comparing the woman before him to the gentler, younger version of her face occupied a portrait his mother had hung lovingly in her private study.</p><p>Draco froze, baffled by his mother’s icy silence. But fortunately, the Stupefy she had fallen under appeared to be broken a moment later. She reached out, without turning her head, and put her hand on Draco’s knee. Her sure touch put him slightly more at ease.</p><p>“Sister,” Narcissa said.</p><p>Draco tried to keep his chin up, and not shudder, when Bellatrix’s eyes traveled from his mother’s face to his. She was a beautiful woman; she had that in common with his mother. Though they didn’t distinctly resemble one another, he recognized a certain attractive haughtiness to her posture, a resilient distance in her manner. Bellatrix’s hair was as dark as Narcissa’s was fair, and her eyes were darker still, as brown as wet chestnuts. They were a sharp contrast to Narcissa’s—and Draco’s—clear grey.</p><p>“Nephew,” she murmured.</p><p>“If you are here, then the Dark Lord must not be far behind,” Narcissa continued evenly.</p><p>Draco’s heart began to pound. The Dark Lord? <em>Among them</em>? He looked down at his pajamas in flustered dread.</p><p>“If that’s true, should we dress?” he blurted.</p><p>Narcissa removed her hand from Draco’s leg. “You shall go to your room, Draco. I will receive the Dark Lord, of course. I’m sure he has no interest in children.”</p><p>Draco wasn’t sure if he was more outraged or relieved, but he had no opportunity to argue, as it turned out. While his mother spoke, his Aunt watched Draco, a faint smile on her dark red, very full lips, the gleam of teeth just visible where they parted. Her smile was growing now, her gaze drinking him in as though the longer she looked, the more she liked what she saw.</p><p>“In fact, <em>you</em> may go to bed, sister. The Dark Lord desires to speak to Draco, and Draco alone.”</p><p>A buzzing noise and a sense of vertigo filled Draco’s head, and didn’t subside. His mother turned her head to look at him. She met his eyes, her face perfectly blank, and Draco stared back, trying to find whatever message she was trying to send him. But he felt that whatever she had meant to communicate, he missed. And then she was standing, kissing Bellatrix’s cheeks, and walking through the open French Doors back inside without ever speaking a word.</p><p>“Where…” Draco managed to say, thinking of what his father would do in these circumstances. For one thing, his father would be on his feet, Draco thought. So Draco stood, only staggering a little when his dizziness intensified.</p><p>Then his Aunt Bellatrix reached out and took his arm in a bruising grip. His gaze shot to hers, and this time the look on her face left him totally clear-headed. Here was the guidance Narcissa hadn’t offered; it was so obvious, she needn’t have said anything. But she said it anyway.</p><p>“Draco, you are your family’s final chance,” she said.</p><p>He nodded, and she released his arm, but held his eye.</p><p>“There is no greater glory to be had than at the right hand of the Dark Lord. Serve him well, and you too will know it.”</p><p>She spoke with such vehement reverence, Draco was instantly convinced. Hadn’t he been raised on whispered stories of the Dark Lord’s greatness? That if the Dark Lord rose again, the world would be righted and the old families’ power and influence restored?</p><p>“Thank you, Aunt,” he said. His voice sounded deep and sure; it surprised Draco, and visibly pleased Bellatrix. She was smiling that slow, blooming smile once more. The hand that had taken his arm so forcefully now floated up to gently brush his cheek. Her wrist smelled strongly of an herb with a name Draco couldn’t recall, but associated with poison.</p><p>“Now, come.”</p><p>Draco quietly dressed in the darkness of his bedchamber, Bellatrix prowling about with no concern for his modesty, picking up and putting down objects at random, occasionally laughing or muttering to herself. He had been teased, once, about the Black madness, and cried to his mother. She hadn’t visibly reacted, but he’d later heard that his playmate had an unexplained hex that was too stubborn to fully cure. Theodore Nott’s right ear was still missing a small notch from the lobe.</p><p>He wondered if madness should shame anyone, when it could make you as mesmerizing and fierce as he found his Aunt.</p><p>The Dark Lord was already there when Bellatrix led him into the ballroom. Draco had never seen him in person, but recalled his grandfather describing a beautiful, eloquent man. The figure of the Dark Lord whom Draco met was fully terrible, what a child’s nightmare might conjure, but that seemed fitting.</p><p>The marble floor was littered with candles, so the faint light cast strange and terrible shadows on the Dark Lord’s visage. His red eyes watched Draco, his long white fingers nearly blue from paleness, steepled over his lipless mouth.</p><p>“Here he is,” the Dark Lord said in his high, breathy voice. His fingers parted and his arms spread to either side. Bellatrix stepped away from Draco. He released her arm, which he’d held as though he was escorting her to a dance. When Bellatrix knelt, so did Draco. He lowered his head even though the sight of the Dark Lord had an undeniable allure. Draco wanted to keep looking at him, in all his haunting strangeness, but instead his gaze fell on the handful of candles that were arranged around him, some almost guttering in a pool of wax, some appearing freshly lit. What was this spell? The fire seemed real; the wax appeared to melt.</p><p>“And Bellatrix,” the Dark Lord said. Draco did not move as his Aunt got to her feet in a whisper of silk robes. Draco then chanced an upward glance, and found his Aunt directly before the Dark Lord, dropping back to a kneel and with her head still bowed, while he placed one of his unearthly hands on her head. His spidery fingers were so long, he appeared to cup her entire skull. Then his hand fell away, and Draco hastily looked down.</p><p>“This is the boy. Lucius’s boy.” The Dark Lord stepped between the candles, his robes pooled around him so that he seemed to glide, not walk. Their little flames quivered as he stirred the air in passing. “Abraxas’s grandson,” he added, sounding bemused. He was before Draco now. He smelled of fresh blood, like the ritual room on Samhain after Lucius bled a lamb to fill the carved bowls.</p><p>“I am Draco Malfoy, my Lord,” Draco murmured, mesmerized by the ragged hem of the Dark Lord’s robes.</p><p>“Look at me, Draco,” said the Dark Lord. Draco steeled himself, and looked up, obedient.</p><p>The Dark Lord had a long face, with a sloping forehead and a diminutive chin, further emphasized by how featureless he was, except for the eyes.</p><p>Draco met his gaze helplessly. He felt the needles of Legilimency slip deftly past the Draco’s defenses, which he’d always thought respectable, to tangle in his thoughts and memories.</p><p>The Dark Lord wasn’t looking for anything specific. He breezed through like someone who wanted to know Draco’s nature, not any particular detail of his personality or memory.</p><p>It was over in short order.</p><p>The Dark Lord frowned. He did not seem displeased, but neither did he seem impressed. A deep wound flared within Draco at that realization: that someone could inventory the root of all Draco was and emerge nonplussed.</p><p>“There is potential here, Bella, as we hoped,” the Dark Lord said, and that same part of Draco which had been injured by the Dark Lord’s reaction a few moments before now brightened at the possibility Draco could yet improve.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord,” his Aunt agreed in a fervent whisper. She was watching them, though she continued to kneel where the Dark Lord had left her.</p><p>“We shall see how he chooses to utilize our respective gifts,” said Lord Voldemort, and he held out his right hand for Draco’s arm.</p><p>Draco held it out immediately, shock gripping him. Would he be marked, now? With no greater ceremony, no demonstration of worthiness? Or perhaps he’d misread the Dark Lord altogether; perhaps he <em>had</em> appreciated whatever he’d found when he examined Draco’s mind.</p><p>But the Dark Lord didn’t mark him. He only held Draco’s wrist, his fingers and palm as cool and smooth as a reptile, and studied it thoughtfully. He <em>did</em> tap his wand against the underside of his own elbow, as though considering touching it to Draco’s arm, but then he let his arm fall back to his side just as he released Draco’s arm and turned away in a swirl of robes. As they lifted around his feet, Draco had a glimpse of his bare ankles and his long, slender toes.</p><p>“You have one month,” the Dark Lord said to Draco’s Aunt as he stepped past her. He did not pause, or touch her again, though Draco saw her strain slightly toward him as he passed by. As though magnetized; as though she couldn’t stop herself. Something hot and uncomfortable swelled inside Draco and threatened to make him sick, though he didn’t understand the impulse himself.</p><p>“Thank you, my lord,” said Bellatrix, her voice a low rasp. The Dark Lord did not turn or pause. If he heard her, he did not feel the need to acknowledge her. When he was out of the ballroom, the candles all extinguished at once. In the sudden, total darkness, Draco could see the thin fingers of smoke where just a moment before there had been flames.</p>
