          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus Snape sighed as he prepared the bedroom for another cold night. "Any luck?" he asked his wife, Hermione, who looked wearily.</p><p>She shook her head, no. "I have no idea how to reset the furnaces to keep the entire school warm! And it's supposed to be the coldest night."</p><p>"Have you tried <i>Incendio</i>?" Severus questioned her curiously.</p><p>"Yes! The furnaces have to be so damn stubborn! Do we still have hot water?"</p><p>"We do, but use it sparinglyâ€¦" Severus' voice trailed off as he watched his wife dashed into the bathroom to take a quick hot shower.  He had already had his bath earlier and had dressed for bed.  Severus had graded his paperwork, patiently waiting for Hermione's return.</p><p>Hermione felt better as she wrapped a towel around her naked body.  "Severus, do you know who Minerva spends a snuggle session with each night while it's cold?"  She had wrapped herself around Severus' hot body.</p><p>"No, who is it? Perhaps Lucius? Or Kingsley?"  They had quickly dived underneath the covers.  She cozies up to Severus as close as she could.</p><p>She giggled, "Oh, you would be surprised! And it's not either one of them!"</p><p>It dawned on Severus as to whom Hermione referred to, "Horace?"</p><p>Hermione kissed him, doused the lights out in the bedroom as she pulled him close to her body. "Get some sleep, dear. Come tomorrow, and we've got a long day ahead of us."</p></div>
