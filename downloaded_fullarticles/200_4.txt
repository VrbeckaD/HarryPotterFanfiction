    <p>Life One</p><p> </p><p>It was over. Voldemort was finally dead, as were many of his more violent Death Eaters, others had surrendered and were in a mixture of Order and Auror custody, and still more had fled when it had become obvious that the Dark Side had lost. Harry was tired; no, he was exhausted. His chest felt tight, and pain radiated from a single point on the left side just above where his heart rested. The exact place where he’d been hit with the killing curse less than an hour before, it seemed so much longer than that. Despite this Harry forced himself to continue moving towards the castle stepping around the bodies of the fallen, friend and foe alike. As his feet brought him closer to the doors he tried not to look at the dead, but he couldn’t help himself. Four feet to his right lay a body, completely still, in the silence of death and seeming too small and far too young to be dead as a casualty of war, Harry turned his head away from the sight of Colin Creevy’s lifeless eyes but he couldn’t escape the results of the war. He could see the body of yet another student he knew, Romilda Vane. He blinked, before lifting his eyes to see yet another body, this one a Death Eater with a student kneeling and crying over the prone form as Harry slowly, and wearily trudged towards the living victim of battle. Wet brown eyes looked up at him. Theodore Nott, one of the few upper year Slytherins who had fought with the defenders of Hogwarts. It hit Harry suddenly that those Slytherins and a few other students who had stayed to fight, like Theodore, had fought against their family members, and those they loved. Harry crouched down beside where Theodore sat in the mud clutching the mask less remains of an older man who looked much like Theodore.</p><p>	“My father,” Theodore whispered the answer to the unasked question. “I hated the man he was but I loved him for the father he used to be.”</p><p>	“For what it’s worth I am sorry,” Harry whispered back doing his best to comfort the boy who now had one less parent to rely on in the world. Harry stood once more and patted at Theodore’s shoulder before continuing on. People were searching the battlefield like vultures and crows, picking through the dead to find those they knew and cared for. Red hair flashed across his vision followed quickly by bushy brown and suddenly Harry was in a strong embrace. </p><p>	“Never again mate you hear me? Never again,” Ron said as the three held onto one another for several long moments, Ron was the first to pull away followed quickly by Hermione. Hermione punched him hard in the arm before pulling him back into a strong hug. When she pulled away she looked at him silently eyes full of tears. Somehow she realized Harry did not want to speak. Harry felt only slightly less detached now as they walked towards the entrance of the school together. People, adults mostly were magically carrying the bodies around them into the school, and the Trio had to move out of the way more than once as they walked up the school steps and into the entrance hall. </p><p>	Though he hated the reasons why, he was glad that most people were more engrossed with their own grieving rather than hounding him. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to take it, on top of everything else that had happened in the last twenty-four hours. He, Hermione and Ron realized at the same time that the rest of the Weasley family, with their distinctive red hair were huddled together around a body that lay upon a white sheet on the floor. Ron predictably was the fastest and all but pushed past the other two to get to his family. Hermione followed fast behind while Harry moved much slower, both sore and afraid. </p><p>	Though he knew the Weasley family loved him and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley often likened him to being another son, it was obvious one of their own had perished and he was unsure exactly how they would take it. He was unnoticed when he finally got close enough to see who it was on the ground. Fred, one of the dynamic and devilish Gryffindor duo. It seemed the cruelest form of punishment ever. Harry looked towards where Bill and Charlie where both holding almost all the weight of George up as the man stared down at the dead body of his twin, eyes both seeing and unseeing. As though he knew it was his twin that lie on the ground empty of life and yet still couldn’t process it.  </p><p>	“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, but it was loud enough for them to hear as all eyes except for George’s. Harry shook as he stared down at Fred’s body. “I think I should go,” Harry said. “I don’t think I should be here right now.” Harry didn’t give any of them the chance to disagree before he walked away. He didn’t get far before he saw a sight that brought him almost to his knees.  He hurried faster despite his injuries finally beginning to catch up to him and dropped beside the two bodies that were set side by side their arms reaching out to one another even in death. </p><p>	“I’m, sorry, I’m so sorry,” Harry said as he reached out to touch Remus’s face tracing the scars the man had given, himself, over the years of being a werewolf. Remus was the last thing that Harry had to any semblance of a father, or connection to his long perished parents, and now too, he was gone. Beside him was Tonk’s, her metamorphic looks faded to her natural looks now that she was dead. It was uncanny the way he could see Sirius as well as Bellatrix and Narcissa in her natural features. She had curly and somewhat wild dark hair much like her aunt instead of the short choppy purple color she’d favored, while her eyes were the same grey blue eyes that Sirius and Narcissa shared. Tears slowly rolled down his cheeks, not only were they gone but they had left someone behind, someone he couldn’t liken to anyone but himself, little Edward or Teddy. </p><p>	“I’ll take good care of him I promise,” Harry vowed as he took each of their hold hands into one of his own and just cried. </p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------Three Weeks Later----------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>	The funerals were all over and with the utilization of magic and the general unification of the survivors of the war had ensured that Hogwarts was ready for the next generation of students. Harry was tired but he put Teddy down on his bed keeping pillows in between the babe and the edge of the bed even though the child was far too young to actually role over Harry was unwilling to take the chance. </p><p>	“Just a minute bug,” Harry said to Teddy, as he quickly set about changing his own clothing. He had permanently moved into Grimmauld Place, Andromeda had helped him in cleaning up the place, along with of course, the much changed and highly loyal Kreacher. Harry had even managed a mutually beneficial bargain with the ex-lady Black. Edward, or Teddy would be raised in a mixture of Potter and Black Traditions so that he would be ready to become Lord Black, and as long as Walburga refrained from insults and screaming.  She’d also be allowed to teach in Black History, as the only person, and he used the term ironically, living able to do it. Narcissa had only learned enough to befit a traditional highborn lady, while Andromeda had learned even less having had the same education before leaving the family altogether. Had Bellatrix been alive Harry wouldn’t have let her anywhere near Teddy in the first place and there were no other living Blacks, besides Draco who had only education into the Malfoy history, and Harry himself who was in the same position Teddy was. Plus Harry didn’t want Teddy to lose anymore of his family as despicable as some members might be and Walburga was only one of many portraits Harry had arranged to help Harry, teach young Edward. </p><p>	Kreacher popped in with barely a sound as Harry hopped back and forth in his pants trying to get his legs in. </p><p>	“I get little Lord dressed?” Kreacher asked.</p><p>	“That would be very helpful, but him in something cool, the Weasley lunch is going to be outside, I don’t want him to get to hot, make sure you put some of that Baby Blast Sunscreen on him as well,” Harry said. “Best pack his umbrella too, even if it’s not set to rain I might use it to cover him from the sun after a bit.”</p><p>	“Of course Master Harry,” Kreacher said. Harry sighed even after three weeks he still hadn’t been able to get the old elf to just call him Harry. At least it wasn’t Master Lord Potter though. Andromeda had gotten him to take up the mantel, and helped him in setting everything up with both his Lordship and the future of Teddy’s Lordship. Sirius had made Harry his heir and Harry had restored Andromeda’s and therefore, young Teddy’s status before passing the title on to the boy and instating Andromeda as interim head of House Black and also placed her in his own Wizenmagot seats. She’d forced him to get new clothing, and had even moved into Grimmauld Place with him and had helped him file all the necessary forms needed to officially adopt Teddy. </p><p>	When Harry visited Andromeda only a day after the battle, to figure out exactly what was to happen in regards to young Teddy. Harry had had no wish to remove the child from his grandmother’s care but he also had no intentions of shirking his godfatherly duties either.  Andromeda had admitted that not only was she worried that her age might play a factor in taking care of an extremely young babe but also the fact that the child may inherit his father’s, ‘ailment’ worried her as she had no idea how to care for a werewolf child. Thankfully Teddy had displayed little more than a slight agitation during the night of the full moon. Instead of having full custody they shared joint custody of Teddy and shared the responsibilities that came with it. </p><p>Today Andromeda was at the ministry. As Harry had given her the responsibility of serving House Potter as well as House Black in the Wizenmagot, and really the woman was much more suited to the job than Harry would have been, she was often out of the house helping with the restoration and restructuring of the Ministry. Harry was left to care for Teddy by himself today, but he was fine with that. They were heading to the Weasley’s anyways for dinner; he could pass Teddy off to Mrs. Weasley for an hour while he took a nap. He was sure that Andromeda was putting pepper up potion in her morning coffee because some how she seemed fresh and perky every morning despite the fact that they shared equally the nighttime feedings and general comforting.</p><p>	He moved to pull his shirt up over his body whilst casting a tempus charm to check the time. It was just after noon and Harry hurried to speed up his movements. He was already late after all. </p><p>	Twenty minutes later found him landing with a pop just outside the Weasley wards push carriage holding Teddy right in front of him while Harry held a diaper bag on one arm and an umbrella under the other. </p><p>	“We all good bug?” Harry asked rhetorically to the cooing babe as he double-checked that everything had gone alright in the transition. Everything had turned out perfectly fine and he was quickly pushing Teddy’s black and white old style baby buggy up the lane. </p><p> </p><p>	“Harry!” Mrs. Weasley called out happily being the first to see him as he walked up the lane. It was quite obvious that the woman had kept everyone from eating before he got there and he was a little guilty that he was almost twenty minutes late. </p><p>	“Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said as he pushed the buggy up to the table that had been set outside and overloaded with food so they could eat in the sun. “Thank-you for inviting me and I’m sorry I’m late.” He continued returning the hug she quickly gave him before leaning down to coo at little Teddy. </p><p>	“Nonsense, we would have waited much longer if it was necessary. I’m sure this little man has been a bit of a handful too,” Mrs. Weasley said. Harry smiled. </p><p>	“He definitely lets everyone know if something’s wrong,” Harry said before cooing down at the babe. “Healthy set of lungs on you, right bug?” Harry said in a baby voice. Teddy gave his baby smile before shoving his fist towards his mouth. Harry chuckled before quickly digging through the diaper bag for the pacifier Kreacher had packed for him. Finding it he gently pulled Teddy’s fingers from his mouth and before the babe could make his displeasure known plopped the dummy into his mouth.  Teddy immediately started sucking the dummy happily.</p><p>	“You are very good with him,” Molly said. </p><p>	“He’s very easily pleased,” Harry said, “Plus Andromeda and Kreacher are a great help.” </p><p>	“If you ever need a break dear just let me know, I’d be happy to watch the babe for a few hours or even days if you would like. You know I don’t completely agree with you taking care of a baby full time. You certainly are nowhere near old enough for that responsibility and when you think about everything you’re giving up. Oh well I’m sure you’ll be a good father, but you aren’t even married yet, what will people think?” Molly said monologuing slightly.</p><p>	“I’ll be fine, but as for asking for a break every once in a while I’ll be sure to keep you in mind,” Harry said forcing himself to keep the annoyance out of his voice. He was slightly tired and that wasn’t helping. “Now I know you’ve worked hard and I can not wait to eat some of your wonderful food and I’m sure I’m not the only hungry one here. Shall we eat?” Harry asked.</p><p>	“Of course, of course!” Molly said. Everyone was quick to sit at the table and while conversation on Harry’s end of the table was slightly muted as George was sitting to the left of him whilst Percy sat across. Teddy managed to wait until Harry had just finished dessert before he started fussing. </p><p>	“Hungry bug?” Harry asked calmly as he pushed his plate away and stood to quickly dig through the diaper bag for the bottle he’d had Kreacher prepare before he left the house. By the time he’d pulled it out Teddy had already managed to spit out his dummy and was full blown crying his hair changing to an spiky ashen grey that often showed the babes frustrated and sad emotion. </p><p>	“I’m coming, I’m coming,” Harry tried to pacify the babe as he checked the temperature of the milk before setting the bottle on the table adjusting the burp rag on his shoulder and lifting Teddy out of the buggy. A quick rearrangement so that Teddy was cradled perfectly in his arms, Harry brought the nipple of the bottle to Teddy’s mouth, quieting and satisfying him. As the babe drank his hair color slowly faded into the tawny curls that were natural to him. Harry shifted towards George who was still sitting at the table. The man hadn’t eaten much. </p><p>	“Would you hold and a feed him for a minute George?” I really have to take a piss,” Harry said ignoring Mrs. Weasley’s gasp at his language. He couldn’t care less, and perhaps it was his petty annoyance at her earlier words but it actually gave him a sort of pleasure. </p><p>	When he returned George was still looking slightly awkward but still more comfortable than when Harry had left as he continued feeding Teddy the bottle. </p><p>	“You’re doing good,” Harry said as he sat down beside George once more. “Would you like to try burping him?” Harry asked. George let out a soft chuckle that had everyone freezing for a moment. George had barely talked let alone laughed since the Battle of Hogwarts and his twin’s death. </p><p>	“You trying to get some form of revenge? Get the baby to puke on me for all the pranks that me and Fr….” George choked as he fought to complete the name, “Fr…Free… Frrred pulled over the um years?” George finally finished and although he was not crying Harry could see the wetness in his eyes. </p><p>	“Not exactly,” Harry said. “Me and Andromeda talked. We figured as I had officially adopted Teddy he needs a new godfather. We both agreed that you were the best choice. I figured I’d give you the opportunity to get in some bonding time. I hear puking on someone is a bonding experience. At least that’s what you told me in my fifth year when you and Fred got me so drunk I puked in your lap,” Harry said. </p><p>	“Me?” George asked. “You both want me as his godfather?” George asked.</p><p>	“Only if you’ll accept of course,” Harry said. “You’d share the duties with Hermione of course. Remus and Tonks made her his godmother the only reason Andromeda didn’t approach Hermione about joint custody is because I approached her first and then Hermione had officially decided she was going to go back for a last year at Hogwarts with Ron. We’ve made Luna his second godmother as well,” Harry nodded in the direction of Hermione. None of the trio had really talked since the funerals, when Harry had announced that he was taking over the official guardianship of Teddy and therefore wouldn’t be returning to Hogwarts or applying to be an Auror at the Ministry. All three of them had gotten into a heated argument when Hermione had forbidden him from doing so practically demanding he return to Hogwarts or get a worthwhile job as being as stay at home dad was not an acceptable action for the Man-Who-Conquered. To say Harry had been angry would have been an understatement, and had they not been at the memorial funeral for the fallen of Hogwarts he’d have showed the two just how fucking livid he truly was. Instead they had just not talked to one another since. </p><p>	That hadn’t kept Mrs. Weasley from inviting him to lunch however. Harry assumed it was her way of trying to get them to reconcile but considering they sat at opposite ends of the table with the living Order Members between them ignoring each other’s presence it was unlikely. </p><p>	“I accept,” George said. “I’ll be the cool Uncle to little Teddy won’t I?” George cooed down at the babe, previous sadness all but forgotten for now. </p><p>	“I’d like it if you would take the official oath as well?” Harry asked. “Luna did so and had I not adopted him I’d have done it with him as well.” </p><p>	“Of course,” George said. “How about right now, it only needs my wand and my oath right?” George asked. </p><p>	“Yeah, though it might be easier if I hold him,” Harry said. There were whispers of protest but neither Harry nor George paid attention to them as George passed Teddy over, the whispers quickly being shut down by others who were around them. One whisper of protest in particular set Harry’s teeth on edge though he fought to keep himself from reacting. Molly Weasley had no say whatsoever in his decisions, and no longer had any in George’s either as the man was an adult in both the Wizarding and Muggle world. </p><p>	“George Gideon Weasley, tu iurare in animam meam, et de magica ut sit custos parens ac interm Edward Remus Lupin in prima res suae custodem mortem non posse?” Harry asked in Latin (George Gideon Weasley do you swear on your life and magic to serve as guardian and interm parent to Edward Remus Lupin, in the even of primary caregiver death?”)</p><p>	“Et sicut custos parens serve manum meam ad Dominum ut in humero meo responsibility cadunt,” George answered in the same language holding his wand in his palm facing up in one hand while the other was set over his heart. (I swear to serve as guardian and parent should the responsibility fall to my shoulders) A ribbon of light connected George and Teddy for a few seconds before it disappeared. </p><p>	Like many ancient protection magics will and desire guided those even when they did not know what to do. Though Harry had looked up the words he needed to speak the confusion displayed on George’s face told Harry that George had no idea why they had just been speaking Latin instead of English.</p><p>	“Magic,” Harry said the single word as an explanation before settling the babe on his shoulder and lightly beginning to burp him. </p><p>	Rather than Mrs. Weasley taking Teddy while Harry took a nap, George took the responsibility, saying that he had to get a lot more bonding time if he was supposed to be the cool uncle. Though Mrs. Weasley had started to complain again saying something along the lines of both Harry and George being far to young to be caring for a child, but some choice words from, surprisingly Percy, had her backing off. It wasn’t as though they weren’t true, Harry and George were both adults, and this was the happiest anyone had seen George in almost a month. Both of the statements had raised Percy in Harry’s books, and Harry had given him a nod in acknowledgement. Both Hermione and Ron had remained silent towards the entire issue, electing to pretend the whole thing wasn’t occurring. Harry had noticed that Hermione hadn’t pressed to go through the godparent oaths herself and was more than happy Andromeda had managed to convince him that a second godmother should be found. Luna would do the job well if anything ever occurred to him or Andromeda. </p><p>	While Harry was hoping to get at least an hour of extra sleep, he found himself being shook awake after only forty-five minutes, according to the tempus charm he set. </p><p>	“Whaa?” He asked groggily, before hearing Teddy’s fussing cries and snapping awake. </p><p>	“I don’t know what’s wrong and mum told me that I needed to figure it out myself if I wanted the responsibility, the rest of the Order has already left and Dad went to work. I don’t know what to do,” George said and he sounded close to tears. Harry was a little confused at Mrs. Weasley’s words and actions. He knew she didn’t agree with him raising Teddy or apparently George helping him, but he didn’t expect total hands off behavior, not after she’d told him to contact her if he needed any help at all with Teddy. Either way it didn’t matter right now, right now all that mattered was figuring out exactly what was wrong with Teddy. Harry took the babe from George and made a quick inspection before grinning. </p><p>	“Pass me the diaper bag, I’m going to teach you how to change a dirty diaper,” Harry said.</p><p>	“I was wrong before,” George said. “This is the revenge.” Harry just laughed as he quickly undid the diaper and used the cleanest bit to wipe away the larger portion of the waste, explaining everything as he went along. </p><p>	“Wait why don’t you just use cleaning charms instead of wipes?” George asked. </p><p>	“Because baby skin is extremely sensitive. Cleaning charms can cause abrasions on the skin, something that is not good on anyone’s skin let alone a babies, let alone on their bottom,” Harry said, before seeing the slightly overwhelmed look on George’s face. “Don’t worry I had to learn all of this too. It’ll get easier with practice,” Harry said trying to soothe George as he powdered Teddy’s bum with Barsley’s Magical Baby Bum Powder, before wrapping him up snug in a new diaper. </p><p>	“Who’s my clean little bug?” Harry cooed lightly tickling Teddy’s belly before he did up the baby blue sleeper and picked him up. While Teddy cooed when Harry picked him up and  cradled him he snuggled in and blinked tiredly. </p><p>	“It looks like someone needs a nap,” Harry said. </p><p>	“I think we ought to get going,” Harry said. “He’ll sleep better in his own bed.”</p><p>	“I’ll be heading out too,” George said. “Lee promised to help me fix up the store and well,” George scratched the back of his head sheepishly before his mood changed obviously more solemn. “I’m not feeling all that welcome here. Mums been….. off. I don’t mean just about Teddy, but about me and the shop. She wants me to give it up. Just give up everything me and Fred worked for like it meant nothing,” George said.  Harry put one hand on Fred’s shoulder for a moment being careful to keep Teddy stabilized. </p><p>	“Do what you believe is right, even if you have to fight the ones you love. I got your back all the way,” Harry said. </p><p>	“Right back at you Harry,” George said with a small smile before grinning softly down at Teddy, who was now asleep. </p><p>	“Well we’d best get going, he’s going to wake during the apparition and I want him to fall asleep again after,” Harry said. They both headed out of the twins room where Harry had been sleeping in George’s old bed. </p><p>	“It’s time for me to head out Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said as he made his way through the living area, towards the front door with Teddy sleeping in his arms. He just had to put Teddy in his buggy and he could be on his way once he exited the wards. He wasn’t sure if he’d be returning for a while. Despite enjoying the food itself, some of the company such as George and a few of others as well as getting the opportunity to catch a nap whilst Teddy was awake having had t take most of the night feedings lately as Andromeda was required daily in the Ministry. Kreacher was a great help, but the elf was old and could in no way keep up with an active two month old babe. Perhaps it was time to give in to both Kreacher and Andromeda and find a new elf for Kreacher to train up. </p><p>	“Are you sure dear?” Molly asked, wiping her hands. “I can watch Teddy for you while you talk with Ron and Hermione. I’m sure you want to make up with them both. You know they only want the best for you and their right you shouldn’t be giving up everything for fatherhood, not at your age, you’re far too young. Maybe you can spend a little time with Ginny too? I know you two broke up but from what she and my son have told me you did it for her protection, so I’m sure you both need to talk about getting back together. You were both meant to be I just know it,” she said fluttering her hand and ginning how he imagined any proud momma would. </p><p>	“As lovely as I’m sure you believe your words to be, I’m finding them more than offensive. In fact the only reason I haven’t given into my famous temper right now is the fact that ‘my adopted son’ is sleeping in my arms. My duty is not to fulfill your expectations or anyone else’s. My duty is to this child. If you and anyone else refuses to see that, it is your problem and I have ‘no problem’ problem cutting you or anyone else out of my life. I may have broken up with Ginny to keep her safe but I have had much time for reflection. I have changed in many ways and I do not feel the same for Ginny. She will always be a friend and I will always love her, just not the way that is necessary for us to be in a relationship, and I do not appreciate you pushing your way into my life and attempting to make decisions for me,” Harry said almost vibrating with the force it took to keep his volume low. “I believe I will be missing at next month’s scheduled lunch, and perhaps the one after that, we’ll see when I manage to calm down,” Harry said before turning refusing to give into Mrs. Weasley’s slightly teary and very offended face. He saw George with a raised eyebrow and smile on his face along with Percy who sat on one of the overstuffed seats by the window in the living area who gave him a nod. He knew at least two of the Weasley’s stood by with him in his decisions. Rather than spend anymore time in the house and not wanting for Mrs. Weasley’s inevitably loud and angry rebuttal to wake Teddy. </p><p>	He was almost at the edge of the wards when he heard the quick footsteps behind him. Taking no chances he flicked his wrist bringing his wand to his hand while he turned around. He kept it at his side and was glad he had when the person following him turned out to be Percy. </p><p>	“Hello Percy,” Harry said. Harry hadn’t talked much to Percy but he knew the other man had taken Fred’s death almost as hard as George had. Harry suspected it was a mixture of survival’s guilt and guilt that he had stood by the Ministry for so long instead of his family.</p><p>	“Hey Harry,” Percy said slowing down as he drew closer to Harry. “I just wanted to tell you that I’m sorry for the way my mother and certain other members of my family are treating you. And to congratulate you as well, no one stands up to my mother, at least not like that. I suggest you screen your mail though mate, her howls are famous, not just in Hogwarts but at the Ministry as well, and she didn’t get to have the last word while you were in there and that always makes it worse.”</p><p>	“Experience?” Harry asked. </p><p>	“No, I never got any myself, but I watched her send the one to Charlie when he first went to work with dragons. He told her and dad the day he was supposed to leave so he didn’t have to deal with all the yelling, learned from Bill I suppose. When Mum tried to argue and order him not to go he just walked out without a word. Didn’t come back till Christmas that year and even then only for a few hours, stayed with a friend apparently,” Percy said before cracking a smile as he adjusted his glasses. “It wasn’t funny then but looking back on it, it was, she sent him a howler that probably lasted five minutes, he sent one back that lasted ten and was accompanied by the roars of some of the dragon’s he was working with in the background.”</p><p>	“I wish I could have seen it myself,” Harry said with a half chuckle from just imagining it.<br/>
“Anyways,” Percy, rocked on his heels awkwardly with his hands in his pockets, “Just wanted to say that, you know?”</p><p>	“Thanks Percy,” Harry said. “I’d best get going though, before your mother realizes I’m still on the property and within shouting range.” </p><p>	“Yeah,” Percy chuckled. “Bye.” </p><p>	“Bye Percy,” Harry said and the red head turned to head back to the house while Harry turned to continue back to the edge of the wards. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------Eleven Years Later-----------------------------------------</p><p>	“Dad, have you seen my boots?” Teddy shouted down the stairs.</p><p>	“Didn’t you pack them in your trunk last night?” Harry called back, standing up, slightly shaky as he used his cane for balance, and made his way around his desk. </p><p>	“I forgot,” Teddy called back.</p><p>	“I think I saw them on the back step Edward,” Andromeda called out as she made her way to the kitchen where she’d been setting out breakfast Teensy had made. </p><p>	“Teensy packed them Master Teddy,” the elf said popping into the hallway as Teddy was about to barrel down the stairs. </p><p>	“Can you get them for me please Teensy? And switch them with my green trainers?” Teddy asked. “They go better with my clothes,” he continued before the boy disappeared back into his room and Teensy popped away. </p><p>	“I blame you for his fixation on fashion,” Harry said as he limped towards the kitchen. His childhood and adolescence had caught up with him a few years ago. Even magic couldn’t heal the injury and damage of long-term abuse, especially damage that had been little more than ignored until it became apparent it could be ignored no longer. Harry was on a regiment of daily potions that just barely kept him alive. Many of his organs had sustained damage from extreme malnutrition throughout his early childhood. His magic had sustained him throughout his teenage years but his body was slowly starting to shut down. He was just twenty nine, not even thirty yet and already he was moving as though he was four or five times his age, especially in the mornings. </p><p> </p><p>	“Oh no you don’t. You can’t blame me when you know damn right it’s all my nephew’s fault,” Andromeda said as she lent Harry her elbow as he stumbled slightly. </p><p>	“And pray tell me, who introduced him to the insufferable prick?” Harry asked. </p><p>	“Draco is not an insufferable prick. He’s simply…..” Andromeda paused trying to find a word. “Oh alright he’s a prick but he’s still family.” Harry chuckled before all but collapsing in the chair that had already been pulled out at the table. Teensy popped into the room placing vials of Harry’s potions in front of him along with a small bowl that contained several different vitamins. </p><p>	“Thank-you Teensy,” Harry said. “Can you bring all of Teddy’s things to the front door so it’s ready? We have to leave in forty-five minutes, and if you wouldn’t mind double checking that he’s packed everything?” Harry asked. </p><p>	Harry had purchased Teensy over ten years ago when Teddy was only about six months. Kreacher had trained the young elf so that he could be semi retired. Kreacher only worried about the library, and master bedroom while Teensy took over everything else. Kreacher had passed away in his sleep only a year and a half after that. Harry had buried him beside where he had buried Dobby, with his own headstone. </p><p>	Despite having ensured Teensy got Friday afternoons off along with Sunday mornings, and giving her a monthly allowance of five galleons, her own fully furnished room, and an order to wear properly fitted clothing, and ensuring she could speak properly, purchasing the house elf had become a huge point of contention with Hermione, and in turn with Ronald. </p><p>	Already strained, their relationship had devolved even further. In fact Teddy had met his first godmother a grand total of two times, both when he was too young to remember. The boy absolutely adored Luna and her equally as creature fanatic husband. Though who would think any different of a Scamander boy Harry had no idea. Of the Weasley’s only the four eldest kept in contact and even then Bill and Charlie only occasionally. </p><p>	Charlie of course was still with his dragons, though he’d been transferred to a reserve down in South Africa, and Bill had moved with his wife to France, and had a daughter only a few months younger than Teddy who was attending Beauxbatons this year. If Harry hadn’t been almost completely sure that Teddy was as gay as Harry was bisexual was he’d suspect Victorie and Teddy would make the perfect couple when they were older. </p><p>	George and Percy were the only two Weasley’s he often spent time with. After that first disastrous end to the Weasley’s luncheon so many years ago, Harry had brought Teddy to a second one, the fifth the Mrs. Weasley had put on. It was specifically for the members of the Order of Phoenix so many of them had been there. It was also the last time many of them had went. The lunch had dissolved into berating shouts and flippant yelling back and forth. Harry, Percy, George, and Charlie on one side, Molly, Hermione, Ronald, and Ginerva on the other, while everyone else just tried to stay out of the way. Bill had been holding Teddy at the time claiming Goduncle rights, and instead of joining had stayed back to protect his heavily pregnant wife, and Teddy. </p><p>	It had almost dissolved into outright spell casting when Molly had called Teddy wolf-spawn, spewing hate towards the babe, blaming Teddy as the reason for Harry’s falling out with Hermione and Ronald and also as the reason Harry was not getting back together with Ginerva. Harry cut all ties with those the three Weasley’s and Hermione, including Arthur as while the man had not stood with them, neither had he stood against them.</p><p>	Harry had left the dinner soon after but not before declaring a blood feud with the specific Weasley’s that he could no longer stand. About two years later, Harry blood adopted Teddy officially making him heir Potter along with his title of Lord Black adding to the adoption paperwork that he’d filed a few years before that when rumors had surfaced about possible laws being pushed through the Wizenmagot about half-blood creatures. The laws had never ended up reaching the Wizenmagot chambers but Harry had further dissolved his relationship with Hermione and Ronald when his private investigator revealed to him that it was in fact Hermione who had written the concepts behind the possible bill. Harry had wasted no time in calling the woman out and giving the evidence to be published by the credible magical political paper the Wizarding Herald. Hermione and those close to her, ie, Ronald and Ginerva, lost all the political capita they had gained after the Battle of Hogwarts as they had been named among the heroes. </p><p>	“Dad, can I bring your cloak to Hogwarts?” Teddy asked as he entered the room pulling Harry out of his reminiscing memories and back to the present. </p><p>	“Not a chance,” Andromeda answered before Harry could. “You will not be bringing such a thing to school. Who knows what you’d get up to with that at your disposal. Am I right Harry?” Andromeda asked with a tone of voice that Harry knew meant he’d best agree. </p><p>	“Please Da?” Teddy begged his hair flickering from turquoise to a tawny color while his eyes changed green, and he widened them into a puppy dog look. </p><p>	“Sorry my bug,” Harry said. “Grandma Andy has spoken.”</p><p>	“Awwww, and don’t call me bug,” Teddy said pouting as he sat down. </p><p>	“Your dad used to call me cub, you get to be bug,” Harry said. </p><p>	“I’m going to be late if I doddle anymore,” Andromeda said knocking back the last of her tea, and kissing both of their heads. “You boys will be fine?” she asked. “I’m sorry I won’t be able to see you off to Hogwarts Ted.”</p><p>	“It’s alright Grandma,” Teddy said in between mouthfuls of waffle. </p><p>	“We’ll be fine,” Harry said. “I’ll be taking a pepper up before we go and I’ll bring another one just in case.”</p><p>	“I know, I just worry,” Andromeda said ruffling Harry’s already salt and pepper colored curls. The moment the sound of the floo signaled Andromeda’s departure Teddy turned his puppy dog eyes back on Harry, causing him to chuckle. </p><p>	“It’s already packed,” Harry said. “I told Teensy to pack it yesterday. It should be in the bottom of your trunk. Now eat up. I’d like to get there a bit early. It’ll be easier for me if there are less people there, and you still need to brush your teeth and pack your toothbrush when you’re finished breakfast.”</p><p>	“Thanks Da,” Teddy said as he dug into his food with even more gusto. Harry smiled as he began taking all of his meds. Downing the last vial of potions he pulled his own breakfast closer so he could begin to eat. He had a strict regiment on what he could and couldn’t eat as set by his Healer. It wouldn’t help reverse anything but with luck it could slow the worsening of some of his conditions. </p><p>	His breakfast included exactly a cup and a half of unsweetened Greek yogurt with a handful of blackberries and blueberries each, a small cup of black freshly ground coffee, along with a cup of pure orange juice. He also had two hardboiled eggs, sliced avocado, and a single piece of whole-wheat toast with only a small amount of organic butter. Harry didn’t mind having to eat healthily, he wasn’t a large sweets fan to begin with. Honestly his only weakness was treacle tart. Something while he couldn’t have often, he was still able to have a portion of every once in a while. He pushed himself to continue eating despite his lack of hunger knowing that he needed to even if he didn’t feel like he did.</p><p>	Harry was only barely finishing up his breakfast, not even having touched his coffee yet when Teddy raced out of the room to go brush his teeth. Harry chuckled at his son’s exuberance. He couldn’t blame him. Today was after all his first day of Hogwarts, even if he wouldn’t actually arrive till dinner tonight. Harry finished the last of his coffee and picked up his toast in one hand as he slowly stood. Teensy popped in and quickly cleared the table as Harry slowly made his way to his bathroom. His bedroom and everything he needed access too had been moved down to the ground floor five years ago when his mobility had truly started being affected. </p><p>	By the time he had brushed his teeth Teddy was already by the front door bouncing up and down on his toes while his hair cycled through a verity of neon colors in his excitement. </p><p>	“You’re flashing bug,” Harry said as he carefully made his way to the bench that had been set up in the boot room. Sitting carefully Harry slowly leaned down to grab his boots. Grunting slightly as his body protested he pulled them slowly on his feet. His fingers fumbled, feeling fat and swollen, with the clasps and Teddy knelt and pushed Harry’s fingers out of the way. </p><p>	“I got it dad,” Teddy said. </p><p>	“Thanks bug,” Harry said his face a little sad. He was getting worse and worse everyday. Though neither he nor Andromeda had spoken too implicitly to Teddy about it they both new that the boy knew he was slowly dying, and was unlikely to get to see Teddy graduate from Hogwarts, but it remained unspoken. When his boots were properly buckled Teddy helped Harry get to his feet again. </p><p>	“Alright almost ready,” Harry said with a slight puff of exhausted air. “Teensy,” Harry called and the elf popped in. </p><p>	“What can I do for you Master Harry?” Teensy asked. </p><p>	“I need two pepper ups and once you’ve brought them I need you to bring Teddy’s luggage to platform nine and three quarters,” Harry said. </p><p>	“Of course Master Harry,” Teensy said popping off for a few seconds before reappearing with the two vials. </p><p>	“Thank-you, Teensy,” Harry said before taking both vials. The moment Harry took them Teensy popped out with Teddy’s things. </p><p>	“Alright bug time to go,” Harry said. Harry said ruffling Teddy’s once again turquoise hair. They didn’t even leave the step before Harry wrapped his arms around his son and apparated.</p><p>	Teddy steadied Harry as they landed, helping ensure that Harry’s legs didn’t give out from the strain of the sudden landing. </p><p>	“Good Da?” Teddy asked when Harry pulled away. </p><p>	“I’m good, thanks bug,” Harry said, putting his weight on his cane. A pop signified Teensy landing beside them with Teddy’s luggage. </p><p>	“Thank-you Teensy,” Harry said. “Can you help Teddy get everything on the train when we’ve finished saying goodbye?”</p><p>	“Of course Master Harry,” Teensy said. </p><p>	“Thank-you Teensy,” Harry said before turning his attention back to Teddy. “Well bug, this is it,” Harry said. “Off to Hogwarts. You know I still remember changing your nappies and making your bottles. You grew up fast bug. I miss that tiny little bug I used to be able to rock in my arms,” Harry said his voice slightly sad. Teddy didn’t say anything, instead wrapped his arms tightly around Harry and burying his head into Harry’s shoulder. Harry didn’t even have to lean down to put his face into Teddy’s turquoise curls. At eleven years old Teddy was almost as tall as Harry. Not that that was too much of an achievement given Harry’s height deficiency.</p><p>“Love you Daddy,” Teddy murmured into Harry’s shoulder.</p><p>	“I love you too bug,” Harry said. </p><p>	“Do you think they’d care what house I get?” Teddy asked vulnerably. </p><p>	“Oh bug,” Harry said. “They wouldn’t care if you were the puffiest puff or the slyest Slytherin and you know it, they loved you, and if they were still hear they would be so proud.”</p><p>	“I miss them Daddy. I wish they were here,” Teddy said. </p><p>	“I know bug,” Harry said. “I know, I wish there were here too.” They held one another for a few more minutes before Harry slowly pulled away. </p><p>	“It’s time to go bug. Don’t want you to miss the train when we’re right here do you?” Harry said with a playful tone. </p><p>	“No Da,” Teddy said. “I’ll write promise.”</p><p>	“You’d better, else I’ll come up to Hogwarts to give you the squishiest hug I can bug,” Harry said with a smile. </p><p>	“Bye Da,” Teddy said before turning to head towards the train. </p><p>	“Bye Bug,” Harry said as Teensy popped Teddy’s luggage into the train. </p><p>	Harry waited on the platform until the train pulled away, waving to Teddy who sat in a window seat until they couldn’t see each other anymore. Harry exhaled deeply before he pulled the second pepper up from his pocket and pounded it back. He vanished the vial before twisting away with a pop. </p><p>	He landed hard on the step of Grimmauld, and his left leg gave way causing him to fall. He screamed in pain as his hip crashed into the cement step. He felt his bone give way and snap. </p><p>	“Fffffuuck,” Harry hissed as he tried to shift over into a sitting position. He pulled out his wand and aimed it at his hip. “Funduntur,” he cast, freezing the wound so it didn’t hurt so much. “Os stabiliendum” he cast the second spell stabilizing the broken bone. </p><p>	“Expecto Patronium,” Harry cast. Rather than the stag that once appeared, instead it was a small dragonfly. Rather than representing his father the patronus represented Teddy, it was why his son held the nickname of bug. </p><p>	“Go to Andromeda, tell her she’s needed at home that there is an issue with a prongslet,” Harry said giving the code word, “Tell her not to apparate directly on the step as i left something there.” Harry fought off the tears of pain as the spell that had numbed his leg slowly wore off and the pain bled through. </p><p>	It was only four minutes later that Harry heard the pop that indicated Andromeda had arrived. </p><p>	“Harry what happened?” Andromeda asked as she hurried towards him. </p><p>	“Fumbled the landing. I’m pretty sure I broke my hip. I have to go in don’t i?” Harry asked, pain coloring his voice.</p><p>	“You can’t take skelegrow when you’re on strengthening solutions, and the rejuvenating tonics, the ingredients clash. Neither of us can cast the spells, you have to go in, I’m sorry,” Andromeda said. </p><p>	“Alright, no use delaying,” Harry said. “Promise we don’t tell Teddy till tomorrow. I don’t want to ruin his first night.”</p><p>	“Deal,” Andromeda said coming closer. </p><p>	“You’re gonna have to use petrificus totalus. I’m not going to be standing anytime soon,” Harry said. Andromeda nodded and cast the spell before apparating them to the emergency bay of St. Mungos. Harry had been here multiple times over the years, the majority of the issues being broken bones, occurring often given the brittleness of his bones. </p><p> </p><p>	“Lord Potter,” said the Healer who rushed forward to take control of Harry’s floating body from Andromeda waving off the medi-witch. </p><p>	“Hello, Healer Malfoy,” Harry said. “And I believe I told you, you could call me Harry, Astoria.”</p><p>	“My apologies Harry, my husband’s habits have a way of transferring,” Astoria said as she cast diagnosis spells on him.<br/>
“Tell me about it. Teddy’s already taking on his fashion fixations,” Harry said. “Fell, it’s my hip.”</p><p>	“I can see that, “ Astoria said. “Have you had problems sleeping?” Astoria asked. </p><p>	“Lately, yeah. I just can’t seem to get comfortable, always itch and  sore, even when I do sleep I’m still tired,” Harry said. “Even with the pain potions you prescribed last time I was here.”</p><p>	“Yeah, I was afraid of that,” Astoria said taking his hand in hers and looking at it. “How long have your fingers been swollen?” she asked.</p><p>	“This week I think?” Harry answered, with a sigh. He knew being truthful even if it would get him more time in the hospital was best. “I didn’t really notice till it got a bit harder to write and buckle my shoes. Thought it was just the season change, the arthritis you know.”</p><p>	“Lack of appetite?” she asked, looking a bit worried. </p><p>	“Yes, but I’ve made sure to stick to my regime even when I don’t feel hungry,” Harry said. “How bad is it?” Harry asked.</p><p>	“It’s certainly not good,” Astoria said. “Along with a broken hip, it looks like some of the meds we’ve given you have compromised your kidneys. We always knew it was a possibility but the other meds that were available are even stronger and were even more likely to cause this. We can lower the dosage and put you on the magical transplant list, but Harry,” She paused shaking her head. “It’s really not good, you’re in full renal failure.  We’ll have you started on dialysis but if we can’t find you a donor, and with magic it becomes even hard because not only do we need blood matches we also need a magical match, you could be on dialysis for a long time. But even then we have complications. The meds necessary to treat your other assortment of issues will continue poisoning your body. Even with dialysis your systems are going to continue shutting down. If we do not find you a donor, you have at the most two years. But they aren’t going to be easy. I’m not gonna lie, this is going to be painful Harry. I’m sorry,” Astoria said. “Lets get you in a room okay?”</p><p>	“Don’t apologize,” Harry said his voice filled with both pain and sadness. “Like you said, we knew it was going to happen, we just didn’t think it was going to happen so soon.” </p><p>----------------------------------------Two Years Later-----------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>	“I don’t want to go Daddy,” Teddy said tears streaming down his stormy eyes. His hair was a dull black color and looked lank in the hospital lights. </p><p>	“I know bug,” Harry said with as sad smile as he gently squeezed the hand that held his own. “I love you so much and I’m so proud of you, you know that right bug?” Harry said, weakly. </p><p>	“I know Daddy,” Teddy sniffled. “I love you too.”</p><p>	“You be good for your grandma you hear me? And you listen to Wacky Walburga too, but not about all that pureblood stuff, just about manners,” Harry said. </p><p>	“I will Daddy promise,” Teddy said. “Can I come back tomorrow?” </p><p>	“You have to go to Hogwarts tomorrow bug. But Grandma will bring you on the weekend,” Harry said. </p><p>	“You Promise?” Teddy asked. Harry looked at the thirteen year old, doing his best to blink away the tears from his eyes as he looked upon his son. </p><p>	“I promise bug. Now Uncle George is going to take you home tonight, and he’ll bring you to the platform tomorrow okay?” Harry said. </p><p>	“Okay,” Teddy said before leaning his tall lanky frame over Harry’s bed so he could give his father a hug. “I love you Daddy.” Teddy said. </p><p>	“I love you too bug, I love you too,” Harry said, letting his tears fall as he watched his son leave the room. </p><p>	“Harry,” Draco said shaking his head slightly, “Are you sure that was the right thing to do?” Draco asked. </p><p>	“No, but he shouldn’t be hear. He shouldn’t have to watch me die,” Harry said looking at the blond. </p><p>	“No,” said Andromeda tears in both her eyes and voice. “But he should get to say goodbye. You know what the Healers have said.”</p><p>	“I know Andy. There’s nothing more they can do. It’s okay,” Harry said. “You’ll tell him I loved him everyday won’t you?” Harry asked. </p><p>	“I promise,” Andromeda said sitting down in the chair beside the bed.<br/>
“I made both you and Draco officiators for my will. The goblins already have arraignments for my funeral. I didn’t want you to have to do all that; you’ve done far to much already, you don’t need that burden too,” Harry said reaching out weakly to her from his bed. She took his hand in her own. </p><p>	“You’ve never been a burden sweet boy,” Andromeda said. </p><p>	“Yes, I have,” Harry said with a slightly wry smile. </p><p>	“Get some rest Harry,” Andromeda said. “You need it.” Harry’s voice filled with dark humor as he spoke again.</p><p>	“I’ll be getting far more than enough rest soon. I can stay up a little longer,” Harry said. </p><p>	“Potter,” Draco said.  “Get some rest.” Harry sighed and nodded. </p><p>	“Fine,” Harry said, “but just for the record, I still think you’re an ass.” </p><p>	“And I still think you’re a goody two shoes,” Draco said. “Now rest idiot.” Harry snorted weakly, and settled back, letting the meds he’d been pumped with wash away the pain an lull him to sleep. As he closed his eyes some how he knew, this was the last time, and he was right, he never woke up.</p>
