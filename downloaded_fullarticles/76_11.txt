    <p>Kakashi was tired. The amount of paperwork from being Hokage was <em> ridiculous </em>. No wonder Lady Tsunade drank so much during the job.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe he should skip on it, Kakashi mused. He was the Hokage after all. He could always come up with an excuse.</p><p> </p><p>He could say that Pakkun's paw was cut.</p><p> </p><p>It was a bad excuse, but an excuse nonetheless. It wasn't like anyone was gonna call him out on it.</p><p> </p><p>But then again, he didn't want to pile his work up. There was no doubt that he would still have to eventually do the work.</p><p> </p><p>As Kakashi was debating on this, he heard a tapping noise on the window. Kakashi hoped that it wasn't Naruto.</p><p> </p><p>He loved the kid - he was a teenager, but his students will <em> always </em>be kids to him - but he was way too eager sometimes.</p><p> </p><p>When Kakashi checked the window, he didn't see blonde hair or obnoxiously bright orange. There was only an owl with a rolled up piece of parchment tied to its leg.</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi blinked at it, wondering who had the audacity to send a summon to the Hokage. If he was more stuck up, he would have either ignored it or sent it away.</p><p> </p><p>But he didn't really care.</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi shrugged, opening the window. The owl stretched out the leg with the letter on it towards him expectedly. Instead, Kakashi patted down the owl, making sure it wouldn't explode or that there were any traps.</p><p> </p><p>When he was done, the owl managed to send an annoyed look at him as Kakashi raised an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>"Standard protocol," Kakashi said, although that wasn't really true.</p><p> </p><p>The owl seemed to doubt him too, nipping at his hand when he tried to grab the letter. Kakashi paused, before determining that the owl really wasn't trying to kill him and grabbed the paper.</p><p> </p><p>He opened the letter and started to read it, before realizing that he couldn't. The thing was in English.</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi sighed before pulling up his laptop, grateful that Konoha was growing more modern as he went to google translate.</p>
<hr/><p>Kakashi hated whoever sent the letter. Three hours had passed by. Apparently google translate was crap.</p><p> </p><p>Why didn't it have a copy paste option?</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi had tried to make sense of the thing with it, but what came out were words such as 'wizards', 'teachers', and 'pigs'.</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi then tried to learn the whole English language in two and a half hours before getting a migraine.</p><p> </p><p>Kakashi groaned, massaging his temples before deciding to just write back with kanji.</p><p> </p><p>When he was done with his letter he rolled it up and set it off with the owl, hoping that they had a Japanese translator or something.</p>
<hr/><p>Dumbledore needed manpower. He needed reassurance.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore didn't want to trouble Hiruzen. It's been a long time since he even contacted him.</p><p> </p><p>But he needed more resources.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to prevent Voldemort's plans.</p><p> </p><p>And so Dumbledore had sent a letter to Konoha.</p><p> </p><p>When he had gotten a letter back, he noted that it was in Japanese. Dumbledore found it strange, since Hiruzen knew enough English to initiate conversation.</p><p> </p><p>He muttered a translation spell before finally reading the letter and getting slightly perplexed at both the unfamiliar handwriting and the bluntness of it.</p><p> </p><p>
