    <strong>*My POV*</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>I love the nights. Because its when wonderful things happen.</p>
<p>Life begins at night!</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Some nights are made for torture, or reflection or the savouring of loneliness." - Poppy Z. Brite.</strong>
</p>
<p>Night is like a blotting paper.</p>
<p>It's true. I think the people who not only faced every damn crap life gave, but accepted it and lived through it are the ones who knows the beauty of night.</p>
<p>Because they know what real darkness in life is. They know what hope is. They know what pain is. They know what emptiness is.</p>
<p>Because they wait for night to come, To drown everything and to light up few things.</p>
<p>
  <strong>"The day has eyes; the night has ears." ~David Fergusson</strong>
</p>
<p>The dark sky represents the darkness in our lives.</p>
<p>The moon and the stars represents the hope. Hope can liven up anything.</p>
<p>And the dark sky on a new moon night represents the emptiness and pain when there is no hope.</p>
<p>And you wait desperately for atleast a faint Star to show up.</p>
<p>Desperation kills you from the inside sometimes when you know the things you wish to happen are impossible.</p>
<p>But still the night is beautiful. Because at last your soul is free. The world is silent. Everyone is asleep and you let your mind, heart and soul to roam and conquer the world.</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Nothing like a night time stroll to give you ideas."</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>~J.K. Rowling, "The Egg and The Eye," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>"No sight is more provocative of awe than is the night sky."</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>~Llewelyn Powys, quoted in Highs by Alex J. Packer.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Some praise the Lord for Light,</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The living spark;</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I thank God for the Night</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The healing dark."</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>~Robert William Service, "Weary".</strong>
</p>
<p>I say, Night is full of wonders.</p>
<p>It heals.</p>
<p>It helps.</p>
<p>It's serene.</p>
<p>It's dangerous and yet</p>
<p>It is beautiful.</p>
<p>The stars. I dnno how to describe them.</p>
<p>They make you dream.</p>
<p>They make you think.</p>
<p>They are enchanting.</p>
<p>They make you fall in love with them.</p>
<p>Whenever you are alone and stargazing, and a smart or quirky or a funny idea crosses your mind, you can see a star wink as if it read your mind and agrees with you!</p>
<p>I donno about anyone out there, but the night sky makes me fall in love with myself. It encourages me. It strengthens me from within.</p>
<p>And the stars, they are sexy!</p>
<p>Life gave me all kinds of shit from the beginning... Believe me... All kinds of shit... It dint care about my age or maturity.</p>
<p>After allÂ <strong>" Life isn't fair."</strong></p>
