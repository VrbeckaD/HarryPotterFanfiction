          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Ginny?" Harry asked, looking down on the girl who held his heart.</p>
<p>"Hmmmm?" She asked, snuggling into his embrace deeper.</p>
<p>"Ginny, I need to say something, and it's important." He said, his heart racing.</p>
<p>She sat up, her face laced with confusion. "Harry, is something wrong?"</p>
<p>Harry got up off the sofa and began pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>Ginny reached out, grabbing his hand. "Bloody hell, Harry, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>Abruptly, he leant down and placed a kiss on her soft lips. It was sweet, just like her.</p>
<p>Pulling back, he grinned, then dropped to his knee.</p>
<p>Ginny's eyes widened in surprise, and a slow smile spread across her face.</p>
<p>"Ginevra Weasley, I love you more than anything in this world. You had been there for me when I needed you. You understood my actions, and have always been accepting of me. You love me, as I love you. And you love me for me, not because I'm famous, or anything other stupid reason. I'm so madly in love with you... You're the first thing I think of when I wake up, and the last thing I think about before I go to bed. You're in my every thought and all my dreams. I can't even imagine my life without you."</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, then pulled out a ring. It was gold, with a diamond in the centre and two smaller diamonds on the side. There was an inscription on the inside reading: "I'll always love you."</p>
<p>Harry looked up at Ginny's eyes and saw that they were filled with tears. She was smiling that smile; her whole self was radiating with happiness.</p>
<p>"Will you marry me, Ginny?" He asked, feeling more nervous than he ever had in his entire life.</p>
<p>She jumped off the couch and tackled him into a hug. "Oh Harry," she cried, planting kisses all over his face. "Yes, yes, yes, yes, oh Merlin yes."</p>
<p>Their next kiss was filled with so much passion and love, they both felt as it if would consume them whole. </p>
<p>"Oh Harry, I love you so much." She said, firmly pressing another kiss to his lips.</p>
<p>"And I love you, Ginny," he said, kissing her back. This was the happiest day of his life.</p></div>
