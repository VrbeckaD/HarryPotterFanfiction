    <p>Draco covered his face with his favourite silk scarf as he entered the smoke-filled pub. It was only midday and already the pub was filled with drunk sailors and the kind of riff raff they attracted. Draco sighed mentally. This was the last place he wanted to ever be seen in, but if the rumours were true, this would be the only place to find the person he was looking for.</p><p>This pub was last true safe heaven for magical pirates. If he was back in English waters, he’d be here.</p><p>Draco walked up to the bar and ordered two pints. The grumpy, one toothed bar keeper glared at him as he poured the drinks. Draco cleared his throat. ‘Excuse me.’</p><p>‘Wha?’ The man slammed both drinks on the table ‘tha’ be sixteen sickles.’</p><p>‘You haven’t seen Captain Potter, lately have you?’ Draco tried to sound as casual and nonchalant as he could be, as if it didn’t really matter if the captain was in or not.</p><p>‘Tha depends.’ The bartender leaned on the bar and grinned nastily at Draco ‘Was a rich twit like you doin’ looking for the Cap huh?’</p><p>‘I’m an old friend.’ Draco placed two galleons on the warn wood of the bar, ignoring the insult. ‘I have an offer that might interest him.’ The bartender eyed him for a moment longer and then took the gold.</p><p>‘Upstairs, second door on the right.’</p><p>‘Thank you.’ Draco took the pint glasses and then carefully made his way to the staircase the corner of the room. Draco really hoped he wasn’t going to walk into something embarrassing. Not that the captain was ever easily embarrassed. The last time Draco had paid a visit to a dingy pub like this, he had opened the door to find Potter half naked and receiving a blow job. Draco hadn’t been able to get out the room fast enough. He knew being at sea for months at a time could be lonely, but really, couldn’t Potter control himself on land? The subject never came up unless one of them was drunk and Draco hated it.</p><p>He kicked the door gently, unable to use his hands to knock and received a curt ‘come in.’ He shouldered the door open. Potter was sitting in a worn leather chair, feet resting on the foot stool. He looked utterly relaxed.</p><p>‘It’s been a while.’ Potter stood and strode in confident steps over to Draco, taking the drinks out of the other boy’s hand.</p><p>‘I know, you look well.’ There was a new scar under Potter’s left eye, Draco noticed and probably more he couldn’t see. Potter’s skin was still beautifully tanned, evidence of that the boy spent of his time sailing in warmer climates. Potter had also bulked out a bit since Draco had last seen him, he had also grown a couple of inches. Draco swallowed, the boy was still gorgeous. Potter placed one of the glasses on a small pine table and took a swig from the other.</p><p>‘Still alive,’ Potter agreed casually ‘So what brings you to my door?’ Draco tried not to squirm as Potter ran his eyes over him. Potter retook his seat, green eyes glinting with mischief.</p><p>‘A business proposal.’ Draco sat on the floor next to Potter. The other boy stank of the sea, smoke and booze. Draco wrinkled his nose. Maybe he could persuade Potter to take a bath? Memories of Potter naked flashed in his minds eye and shook his head, trying to clear them. No was not the time to go down memory lane.</p><p>‘First time for everything.’ Potter teased. ‘How much?’</p><p>‘200 galleons and six cases of whatever alcohol you want.’ Potter narrowed his eyes, a sure sign that Draco had started off too low. Damn it.</p><p>‘Seriously, 200? You gotta do better than that, remember Draco I know you can pay.’</p><p>‘Fine, two thousand. I’ll pay whatever you want to get the job done.’</p><p>‘So, what’s the job?’ Potter’s body relaxed, placed he had the upper hand.</p><p>‘The Dark Lord needs safe passage abroad. Travel by Floo is dangerous – the Ministry is monitoring all the fireplaces and International Portkeys are well, hazards to one’s health.’ Potter took another sip of his drink. He had heard the tales of Portkeys going wrong if you tried to travel too far. Most Ministries insisted of multiple Portkey’s just to be safe.</p><p>‘So, Apparition is also out then, as powerful as the Dark Lord is, even he can’t Apparate over oceans.’</p><p>‘Very true. You see our problem? The Dark Lord suggested flying – well yes, my thoughts exactly.’ Potter had pulled a sour face.</p><p>‘So, you really do need my help.’ Potter closed his eyes as he thought it over. ‘Where to; when and how many.’</p><p>Draco grinned. ‘America – preferably New York, as soon as you can. Ten people, maybe twelve people.’</p><p>‘Your lucky, today is my last day on land. My ship sails tomorrow – is that soon enough for you?’</p><p>‘Tomorrow is perfect.’ Draco sighed with relief all tension gone from his body. He could go back and tell his Lord the good news.</p><p>‘Excellent, get your people ready, my ship sails at dawn and I’m not going to wait.’ Draco nodded. Potter never waited for stragglers. ‘Oh, and Draco?’</p><p>‘Yeah?’</p><p>Potter stood, grabbing the front of Draco’s shirt and pinning the other boy to nearest table. The green-eyed boy smirked before claiming Draco’s mouth in a passionate kiss. Draco was breathless when they finally broke apart and furious with himself enjoying the kiss, hadn’t he learned anything?</p><p>‘I look forward to having you on my ship.’ Potter leaned back down and recaptured Draco’s lips.</p><p>‘Isn’t that what your first mate is for?’ Draco pushed the other boy away, pissed beyond belief. The <em>nerve</em> of him.</p><p>‘Why have him, when I can have you?’ Potter grabbed crotch and smirked ‘Seems like I’m not the only one who feels this way.’ Draco was rock hard.</p><p>‘You are an asshole.’ Why did his body have to react positively to him? He wasn’t interested in the arrogant captain anymore.</p><p>‘And the best Captain on the sea’s. Why else come to me for help?’</p><p>Draco glared at Potter. ‘We are not a couple anymore and we are not going to sleep together on this trip.’</p><p>Potter snorted ‘I’ll remind you of that when you’re sneaking into my cabin, wanting my cock.’</p><p>‘Keep dreaming.’ Draco spat.</p><p>‘I don’t even have to dream. I have <em>memories</em>.’ Potter smirked as Draco stormed past him ‘Remember what I said. I leave at dawn and I am not going to wait for you or any or your Death Eater buddies. Be on time, or get left behind.’</p><p>Draco opened the door and closed it firmly behind him. Maybe hiring Potter was a mistake, there were plenty of other captains in need of money. No. He didn’t trust them like he trusted Potter. Sure, the boy was an arrogant asshole, but he was a great sailor and Draco knew he would get them to America safely. Draco leaned his head back on the closed door. Damn it. He wasn’t going to fall for Potter again. He wasn’t.</p>
