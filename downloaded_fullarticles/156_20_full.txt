    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It all started when Fred set up the meeting with Sanders. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scratch that. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I suppose the real beginning was back at Hogwarts when we were kids. Even as a kid, she was a raging bitch. I hated her. She never wasted an opportunity to sneer at my out-of-style robes, the frayed edges of my school books, even my goddamn freckles, as if freckles were a telltale sign of poverty. As if there was nothing more despicable in this world than being poor. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She got under my skin, and it didn’t take long to figure out how to get under hers. Pug-nosed Pansy, I teased. The first couple of times, she turned away angrily and I caught the subtle shake of her shoulders as she walked away, and once, the swipe of her nose with her uniform sleeve. I got great satisfaction from making her cry. I wanted to cut her as much as she cut me. My little taunt caught on, and a couple of the boys in Gryffindor would press their fingers to their noses whenever she walked by, or making barking noises. Eventually, she perfected this upward roll of her eyes and snooty little scoff, like our insults glossed right off her. It only made me want to cut her deeper. Later, when she was falling all over herself fawning after Draco Malfoy, we started calling her Malfoy’s </span>
  <span class="s2">bitch</span>
  <span class="s1">, followed by this panting sound, like a dog in heat. She deserved it. She had called my best friend a mudblood. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After we finished school, after the war, the tabloids made her a socialite, or train wreck, depending on who you ask. Witch’s Weekly’s gossip column, run by my ex-girlfriend, Parvati Patil, had a field day detailing the Parkinsons’ fall from grace. First the Death Eater trials, then the fraud charges against Pansy’s mother, then the seizure of their assets. After some time, she and her horrible family faded from the tabloids. The last I heard, she was penniless, living abroad on the continent somewhere with distant relatives. And yeah, I was happy about it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I want to say I didn’t think about her much after that, but I guess that chip on my shoulder remained even after all those years. I still remembered the way she turned that squat nose up at me, the ugly curl of her lips when she called me dirty and poor. This is all a roundabout way of explaining why I did what I did when I saw her for the first time in nearly a decade during that weekend at Sanders. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You see, the joke shop that my brothers had dropped out of school to start, and that I had dropped out of the auror department to join, has grown to be a blooming success. Not to brag or anything, but we have locations on every continent, and have quite successfully branched off into other industries. There’s Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, the original joke shop, which then spawned Weasley’s Wonky Wanderings (our travel or pharmaceutical subsidiary, depending on which entrance you use), Weasley’s Wonderful Wards (our security sector), and most recently, Weasley’s Wanton Wishes - our foray into the adult goods industry. And let me tell you, it’s been an interesting foray indeed. We’re in the process of developing high quality toys, potions, and elixirs to enhance one’s bedroom experience. Many products are developed based on muggle sex toys and ancient love potions. I would have paid more attention in school had Muggle Studies and History of Magic covered this stuff.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Most product designers, manufacturers, and distributors that we formed relationships with are as professional and polite as you get in any other industry. We have our usual meetings with the slide shows and the product demonstrations, interviews and brainstorm sessions and whatnot.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then, you have Sanders. He owns a couple of high-end sex clubs, mostly BDSM stuff geared toward the rich and wacky. Case in point, Fred and Angie, who are as wealthy and “free-spirited” as they come, tried out one of his venues a few months ago, and have since become regulars. I personally didn’t see the appeal, prefer my sex life without the extra effort of handcuffs, but for research purposes, I went as well. I took this twenty year old waitress with amazing tits I’d met the weekend before at a nightclub in Berlin. If she thought it was weird I was taking her to a sex club on our first date, she certainly didn’t show it. She let me tie her up, opened her mouth when I took my cock out, and basically gargled my dick until I came on her chest. It was an alright experience, a nice orgasm and all but nothing that spectacular. All the bondage and whips and rituals seemed so contrived, like some piss-poor attempt to make slapping my dick on some bint’s face feel like more than it is. It isn’t. Fucking a stranger in a poncy sex club isn’t really any better than fucking one in the Three Broomstick’s bathroom. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I said as much at that dinner with Sanders. I just didn’t get the appeal, didn’t think all the black and leather were on brand for us. By then, Fred and Angie had disappeared off to do Merlin knows what in some curated dungeon room. Despite how mischievous he was back in school, my brother takes our business seriously. He would never wander off in the middle of a work dinner for a tryst with his wife, but there was something about Sanders and his world that normalized, even encouraged this sort of deviancy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The thing you have to understand about Sanders is that he’s really a very likable bloke. He’s tall, but not too tall. Good looking, but not overly so. He comes across as approachable, manageable. He claps you on the back, invites you to his private bar for some rare edition firewhisky. He laughs good-naturedly when you drink too much and insult his business to his face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It isn’t about the props,” he said with this knowing smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What is it about then?” I asked. “Control?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“For some, yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I just don’t want to pigeonhole us with something so niche before we get off the ground,” I answered before downing the drink. I could hear myself slurring my words. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He motioned for the bartender to pour me another, and I watched as the flame and liquid splashed into my glass.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Try something for me, won’t you, Ron?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mm?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come to my estate in Tuscany this weekend. It’s the perfect time of year for a stay at the villa. I’m hosting a rather debaucherous gathering for some of our elite members. Fred and Angelina are invited of course. You can partake in the revelry, or just enjoy the scenery, but there are some very special ladies there I want you to meet.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I crushed my teeth together in a grin to hide my groan. Was this man seriously trying to buy me off with bimbos? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t know,” I answered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come now,” he pleaded. “Don’t tell me you have better plans.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I thought about Malfoy’s birthday party that Hermione had invited me to on that upcoming weekend. I mean fine, she and I hadn’t been right for each other. I know I wasn’t the perfect boyfriend, never tried to be, wasn’t ready to make a real commitment, didn’t like talking about books and the greater good all the goddamn time. Plus I couldn’t take her constant nagging to push myself to do more important things for the world than run a joke shop. Our split was this passive aggressive little taper into being better off as friends. It took some time, but we’re genuinely good with each other now. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, did she have to go and get engaged to Draco Malfoy? What’s worse is that the bugger turned out alright in the end. They had some romantic little adventure, a long boring story involving some chance meeting in South Africa, and now they can’t live without each other, blah blah blah. To make amends, he went so far as to personally apologize to me and every member of my family for all of his and his father’s wrongdoings. Yeah, he’s proper whipped, that one. Anyway, my point is, I didn’t really want to go to Malfoy’s poncy birthday party, so “work trip” to Tuscany it was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Alright, twist my arm,” I agreed. “How do I get a portkey?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fast forward a week later, and I found myself at Sanders’s villa in Italy. The property was impressive, extravagant, the sort of place teenage me secretly fantasized about owning one day. He had these scantily clad servers everywhere, holding trays of champagne and dildos and libido-boosting potions. After the initial cocktail hour, we sat down to a formal dinner. To my surprise (and relief, because it’s undeniably weird to be with your brother and his wife when they’re getting freaky), Fred and Angie were seated all the way at the other end of the table. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I sat down at my name card and waited for the tart he hired for me. After some time, a pretty blonde sat down next to me. She smiled a lot and would throw her head back to laugh at jokes that weren’t really that funny. I was way too sober and clearly out of my element, so naturally, I downed my drink as quickly as possible. At least Sanders served good booze. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Despite my initial reservations, I had reviewed the spreadsheets, knew what sort of profit margins his clubs generated. Not now, but in a year or two, a partnership might prove highly lucrative for both our ventures. Maybe I should have said as much to put Sanders’s mind at ease, but I liked the game, the back and forth of negotiations, the having the upper hand. It didn’t occur to me that he had Pansy fucking Parkinson up his sleeve. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I didn’t even recognize her at first. The first thing that caught my eye were her tits, and then her arse. There were lots on display that night, but hers were truly spectacular. She looked like some comic book fantasy, scantily clad in this tight, dark green, lacy number. Around her neck was an impressive chain of thumbnail-sized emeralds. Her eyes were lined with heavy, black glittery stuff. Her lips were painted red and glossy. Her hair was in this sleek angular bob that made her high cheekbones seem more exotic than I remembered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I think my jaw must have dropped a little when I realized who she was. Like an idiot, I couldn’t stop starring as she sauntered over in her fuck-me stilettos and sat down on the other side of me. Up close, she was beautiful, like actually quite possibly the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen. And her nose - Merlin, she must have spent a fortune on glamours because that dainty little thing on her face was not what she had in our school days. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Enjoying the view, Weasley?” she asked smugly, with that same lilting posh accent I remembered from school.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good to see you finally did something about your pug face,” I answered reflexively. I couldn’t help it. I was always petty when it came to her, and it was indeed good to see that she’d gone through great lengths to rectify the flaw I teased her about. It meant I had gotten under her skin too. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The corners of her eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but she didn’t react more than that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tut tut,” she said with a smile. “Play nice, Ronniekins. After all, aren’t we in the same business now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I scowled. Before, I could reply, she turned to greet the bloke on the other side of her. Pansy was one of the last to arrive at the table, and dinner service began shortly after. I never thought I’d say this, but I actually wished I had just gone to Malfoy’s birthday party instead. The blonde kept trying to make small talk about the food, but I don’t remember a single thing they served during that dinner. Even the caviar tasted like sand. I think at some point, some models crawled naked across the table to serve dessert, but honestly, my mind was focused on Pansy and the shape of her hardened nipples through the thin fabric of her dress. After sitting down, she spent dinner chatting animatedly with everyone around her but me, which just made me more irritable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eventually though, after enough drinks, I warmed up to the idea of fucking the blonde, who was now rubbing my dick through my trousers. Sometimes, easy tarts are exactly what one needs in life.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It wasn’t until we were all sipping our digestifs that Sanders came over. My companion smiled and withdrew her hand when she saw him. I tried to not let my surprise show when she tilted her head back and let Sanders kiss her mouth, then her neck. And Pansy, well, she stood up and kissed Sanders possessively with tongue. My eyes fell to the arm he wrapped around her waist, and the easy way she leaned into him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How are you enjoying yourself tonight, Ron?“ he asked. “You’re sandwiched between my two favorite pets.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I worked my mouth into what I hoped was a casual smile. “Great party,” I answered politely. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Lucy, darling,” Pansy spoke up. “Won’t you excuse us a moment?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without a word, she got up and stepped aside. Then Pansy sat down in her seat, and Sanders sat down in Pansy’s original seat. I had the odd feeling that I was being circled by wolves. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Greg, my love, I’m afraid Weasley here may not enjoy my companionship much. You see, we have a bit of a past, something of a schoolyard tussle.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looked at me as she said this and I gulped at the way her lips pouted slightly as she enunciated tussle. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is that right, my pet?” he asked in a manner that didn’t sound like asking at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">”Yes,” she said lightly. “I’m afraid he doesn’t want anything to do with me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“My, oh my,” he said with a hard glance her way. Then he looked at me. “Is this true?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I might have imagined it, but for a split second, his eyes lost their usual twinkle before he clapped me on he back and smirked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No matter,” he said, before I could reply. With a tilt of his head, he beckoned the blonde back to the table. “Why don’t you let Lucy here take you on a tour of everything we have to offer.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">”Sounds like a plan,” I answered. I had no idea what was going on, what had just transpired. I wouldn’t know until much later in the evening when I was balls deep in Pansy Parkinson, but I’m getting ahead of myself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the moment, I blinked bewildered as he fished a length of leather from his pocket. At the end was a clasp. He reached forward and latched it onto the choker around Pansy’s neck.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was no mistaking the look of alarm on her face. It was clear she didn’t want this. I recognized the stiffening of her shoulders and the flaring of her now much delicate looking nostrils, and much expected her to fly into a sharp-tongues tirade like she would have in school. Instead, she only widened her eyes at him and shook her head ever so slightly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sanders, on the other hand, had the same casual smile on his face, like it was no big deal that he had just leashed a woman and now pulling her so she was forced to get on her hands and knees on the marble floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Enjoy your evening, Ron,” he said, then gave another sharp tug at Pansy, forcing her to crawl as he began strolling from the dining table. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right, thanks. You too,” I said awkwardly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If it were any other woman, I would have intervened. Obviously, she was being coerced and coercion is wrong, but this was Pansy snobby-face Parkinson, and I </span>
  <span class="s2">liked</span>
  <span class="s1">seeing her degraded, liked watching her round arse sway as she scampered clumsily on hands and knees after Sanders. What’s more, I wanted it to be me that held her leash in my hands. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By the time Sander stepped away, dinner had formally concluded, and most of the other revelers had rifled out of the dining room. I had forgotten the blonde was even there before she returned to stroking my now very, very hard dick. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“My,” she said breathily. “I can’t wait to have you in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I’m usually a respectful partner, usually at least sort of care about the woman’s pleasure, but I didn’t give a fuck about this random bint who for all intents and purposes was a bribe to get me to sign some bloody contract. I gripped her by her hair, and of course she liked that or moaned like she did anyway, and pressed her facedown on the soiled dining table. Since she wasn’t wearing underwear, it only took half a second to whip out my cock shove it all the way inside of her. This isn’t bragging, or maybe it is, but I’m big down there. I usually can’t work my way into a pussy just like that, but she was so wet and had obviously taken her fair share of dick in her day, so I was soon pounding away inside of her and came quicker than I’m proud of. She acted like she was coming too, and no, I didn’t care that she was faking it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Afterward, she smiled brightly and breathily helped me zip back up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That was a nice warm up,” she said, pleasantly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I had to give her props for her positive attitude.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thanks for that. You got me all worked up over dinner,” I replied, and even though I found her sort of annoying, I kissed her like a gentleman.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come on,” she said, smiling. “I have so much to show you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I was pretty drunk by the time Lucy began our tour of the villa. We walked by the ballroom, where some guests were dancing, and others were fucking. She swiped a bottle of gin from the bar there, and we took turns swigging as we walked by the enchanted baths, the various rooms that seemed to be fabric themed (leather, silk, velvet). I found myself giggling along with her inane chatter, and it was probably all the booze, but I was having fun. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At some point, we ended up voyeurs to an orgy in the gardens. She got down on her knees to suck my dick, but I pulled her up and kissed her instead. She really was very pretty, and if Pansy hadn’t been at dinner, I would have been content to spend the weekend with agreeable little Lucy. But Pansy </span>
  <span class="s2">was</span>
  <span class="s1">here, and here, she lived on a leash held by a man trying to win my favor. I couldn’t stop thinking about this, and I suppose that makes me no better than Sanders.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I think Lucy knew what I really wanted, because eventually, she took me down to the wine cellar. I heard the fucking long before I saw it, echoing against the cool, damp walls.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I don’t know what I expected to see. Based on the wails and grunts, maybe another cluster of naked bodies, pelvises thrusting, legs spread apart, mouths contorted open, all conjoined in some abstract chain. I was going to suggest we turn around, when I saw the scraps of dark green lace littering the long walk way. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Abruptly, I could no longer focus on whatever Lucy was saying. All I could hear was my pulse in my head. I think I began to walk faster, because she had to trot to keep up with my longer stride. At the end of the passage was a turn into an empty foyer. There were four men in various states of undress, and in the middle speared between their thrusting cocks was my old classmate, her neck and wrists and ankles wrapped in iron restraints that were chained to the ground. There were red marks all over her body, handprints and what I presumed to be cane marks. Off to the side, Sanders was relaxed in a leather armchair, watching from a darkened corner with a sadistic little smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His face lit up when he saw us. “Fred gave me a sample of your latest aphrodisiac. Sure makes her hungry for cock, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I shook my head in confusion. Our latest aphrodisiac, Potion 84, was far from ready for live use. Why would Fred share this with Sanders? I turned my gaze back to Pansy, who was on all fours. She did look hungry, head tilted back and mouth gaped open for the cock being shoved in her mouth. On the other end, her legs were spread with her ass in the air, and some fit bloke in a rumpled tuxedo was ramming his dick into her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A different bloke, fat and bald, moaned loudly then, and came on her back. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re one lucky man, Sanders,” he said after tucking himself back into his pants. “Thanks for sharing your pet.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sanders gave a little wave with two fingers, like it was nothing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man left, brushing past me on his way out. “Sanders never shares that one,” he said to me, conspiratorially. “Guess it’s our lucky night, eh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just then, the guy in her mouth blew his loud on her face, and I swear to Merlin, she actually opened her mouth and tried to catch his cum. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That was when she saw me. Her eyes were glazed over like she was high. I mean, she </span>
  <span class="s2">was</span>
  <span class="s1">high. Potion 84 was originally meant to be a mild party drug, but was tabled after we found it to have unexpectedly strong side effects on one’s libido. Only recently did we make another batch, with intentions to modify it safely for our newest venture. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Even through the drug’s effects, her body stiffened and recoiled a bit at the sight of me. I could tell she was going to say something in protest of my presence, when the fourth guy slapped her face with his dick.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come on,” he grunted. “Take it!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She did, even as she glared pointedly at me.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I’d never been so hard, will never forget the dirty sex smell of that cellar, and her moans and whimpers as she bobbed her head back and forth over some guy’s dick, and her wail of pleasure as the bloke behind her started pumping harder and faster.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucy was saying something, and snaking her hand up my chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“... don’t mind sharing, do you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I stood there dumbly and shook my head. She made her way to Sanders and knelt at his feet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good girl,” he brushed his hand affectionately through Lucy’s curls. She pulled him gently down by his collar and whispered something in his ear.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, you’d like that wouldn’t you?” he laughed, then stood, pulling her up with him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just then, both men came on either end of Pansy. Like the ones who had left earlier, they got dressed, thanked Sanders, strolled away. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She hung her head down to her chest, still shaking from her latest orgasm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You can guess by now, that this,” he gestured to Pansy, “Was my surprise for you this weekend. You told me you don’t get the point of all the whips and chains, but tell me that this isn’t the hottest thing you’ve seen in your life - the snobby bitch from your childhood trussed up and being fucked like a two penny whore.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He reached into his pocket, and like he had been reading my mind all night, he pulled out the leather leash and handed it to me. “It’s enchanted to make her do whatever you want. And in case the war hero in you has qualms, let me assure you that she loves this shite, lives for it. Consider her my gift to you for the rest of this weekend.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And with that, he led Lucy out of the cellar, leaving Pansy and me alone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I want to say that I cleaned her up, unchained her, and gave her the antidote to the potion. I always carry a special tincture with bezoar extract with me, a habit from my auror days. It was tucked away in the hidden fold inside my pocket, and all I had to do was pull it out and offer it to her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead, I walked over to the lone leather chair, sat down, and watched her. She was curled into a ball now, turned away from me, no doubt avoiding my gaze. She was still trembling and I could guess that it was from the potion’s effects. I’d taken it myself years ago, and know firsthand the insatiable need to be touched. It led to a pretty memorable night with Parvati, but that’s a story for another time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In my hand was the leather leash Sanders had given me. I fingered the little gold clasp that would link to her choker.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Parkinson?” I said her name after some awkward silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She ignored me, though now she was rocking her pelvis back and forth a little, desperate for someone, me, to fill her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I finally gave in and gripped my cock through my pants. I was rock hard, and thanks to the earlier fuck I’d had with Lucy, I would probably last ages if I wanted to, fucking all of Pansy Parkinson’s holes. My mouth literally watered at the thought. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I knew it was wrong. I knew she would hate me for it, but she already hated me, didn’t she? And how was I any worse than any of those other men who had already fucked her tonight? I’d be just another cock. And I’d make it good for her. I can do that if I try. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What gives, Weasley,” she snarled, jolting me from my thoughts. “Are you going to just sit there all night?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I might,” I said coldly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She uncurled herself and shot me a glare. She was beginning to sweat, despite the coolness of the cellar. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t be an arse,” she snapped.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I smirked at her, and stroked my cock slowly, teasing her. I watched her eyes fall to my crotch, savored how she licked her lips in anticipation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just ask nicely,” I told her her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She narrowed her eyes but didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I got out of the chair then and stood over her. She was so beautiful, even with dried cum on her skin and hair, and red marks all over her body. Sanders was right. I was loving every minute of Pansy chained at my feet, loved that she was covered in filth from the rough gangbang I’d just witnessed, and that even though she was literally shaking in need, her pride was in the way of her asking for what she wanted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I took my cock out and dangled it over her face. Her lips opened a little and her breath quickened. I loved the rise and fall of her chest, wanted desperately to squeeze her tits and slide my cock between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just ask for it,” I told her again, resting my cock against the opening of her parted lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The first little lick from her tongue is still one of the most erotic moments of my life. Pansy Parkinson was licking my cock and with a little push, I was inside her mouth, and just a little more, and I was gagging her throat. I held her head against my crotch till tears filled her eyes and then pulled out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You are such a bastard,” she gasped, trying to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah,” I said.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then, I took out my wand and released her from the shackles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” she asked in surprise. “That’s it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” I said again, and sat back down in the chair. “You want more? You gotta do all the work.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I thought she was going to slap me, and I would have deserved it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Or,” I told her. “You could just walk away.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">For a minute, I thought she would. I was sorely disappointed of course, but knew I had done the right thing. Fucking a drugged up, tied up woman was rape. And rape was wrong.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then, to my relief, and shame that I wasn’t a better man, she practically lunged at me in the chair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I fucking hate you for this,” she snarled, even as she gripped my cock and aimed it at her pussy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I half-heartedly fumbled with her hands to stop her, and of course, I could have stopped her if I really wanted to. After all, I am at least twice her size. But then, her pussy was sinking down, wrapping itself around my cock and I couldn’t help but grip her hips and thrust up into her. Like I mentioned earlier, I’m big down there, and I could tell I was hurting her a little as she tensed over me. I should have stopped, but fuck, she was so hot and wet and messy, nasty with pussy juice and multiple men’s cum and so so needy, squirming over me, mewing and moaning. I should have stopped it, could have, but I didn’t want to. I rested my hands on her hips and let her bounce on my cock, let her squeeze my dick with her inner walls, and shake her tits in my face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was muttering something under her breath, and it took me a while to make out her words.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dirty fucking Weasley,” she was saying. “I always knew your cock would be big and dumb like you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Never knew you’ve thought about my cock so much,” I shot back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Big, stupid oaf,” she sneered. “You think you’ve won, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” I said. “I do.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then, I gripped her hips again and went back to thrusting up roughly inside of her, fast and hard and ruthless. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sanders was right. She loved this. She clung to my shoulders to steady herself, and for a moment I thought she might kiss me, before she turned her head to the side and collapsed against my chest. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t stop, don’t stop,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I obeyed, kept thrusting hard as I could. When I felt she was close, I reached down between us and found the hard nub of her clit. She came apart completely, beautifully, as I pressed and rubbed. Her pussy throbbed around me and the rest of her went limp such that I had to wrap my arms around her to hold her up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I gripped her by her shiny black hair and tilted her head back so she was forced to look up at me. I didn’t say anything, just savored the defeat in her eyes as I creamed in her cunt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It didn’t take long for the self-loathing to set in. Yeah, she was Pansy Parkinson, who was still a raging bitch after all these years, but I had crossed a line I shouldn’t have. I pushed her off me, and she collapsed into a tired heap on the cold cellar floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Bastard,” she said half-heartedly, but stayed down and closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I tucked my cock back inside my pants, then reached into my pocket and found the tincture vial. I pulled the stopper from the small bottle and leaned forward and tipped the potent potion into her mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her eyes flew open and she shoved me away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What the fuck was that?” she snapped, spiting what she could out onto the cellar floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Relax,” I said tiredly. “It’s tincture of bezoar.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I expected her to be grateful. After all, I had relieved her of the potion’s painful arousal effects. Instead, a look of sheer panic came over her face, and she scrambled away from me all the way to the far wall.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You idiot,” she screeched, and curled her body away from me and threw an arm up over her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t look at me!” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I had never heard Pansy sound so panicked, except maybe that one time when she tried to hand Harry over to Tom Riddle. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What gives?” I snapped, annoyed that she was upset.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t look!” she cried again. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course I looked, watched her distress in fascination as the makeup melted from her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Give me your wand!” she demanded.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No fucking way.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Give it here!” She was nearly in tears, still curled away from me, hands obscuring her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So the potion took away your makeup. Big deal. I’ve seen you without make up before.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You really are such IDIOT,” she spat. “Accio Weasley’s wand.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I felt my wand start to slip out of my pocket, but I easily accio’d it back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What gives, Parkinson?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I held up my hands so she could see I meant no harm, and stepped slowly towards her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her eyes hardened then, and she dropped her arms and stood up proudly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It took me a second to realize what I had done. I had neutralized all her glamours with the potion, and well, she looked different, more like the girl from school.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I had to hand it to her for that haughty fucking pose she struck as I advanced towards her. There, on her face, was that pug nose I had teased her about all throughout our childhood. It wasn’t nearly as ugly as I remembered. Really, it wasn’t ugly at all. Maybe she had grown into it. Or maybe I had made her uglier in my mind over time, since she had been so<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>nasty to me and my friends in school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My point, I suppose, is that she was still drop dead gorgeous. She looked younger without the heavy make up, more approachable, but definitely still the hottest girl I’ve ever been with. And Merlin, those tits, and that waist, and the flare or her hips into that delicious arse. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t like my women under the influence of potions,” I said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not your woman,” she shot back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Neither one of us mentioned her lack of glamours. I think it would have hurt her more somehow if I’d said something about her still being pretty without them. Or teased her about her initial distress. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” I said. “I suppose you’re not.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I was less than an arm’s length away from her now and she didn’t move to stop me.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Look,” I told her. “We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to. I know you would never actually want to be with me if Sanders wasn’t forcing you to-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He isn’t forcing me to do anything.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So fucking me was your idea then?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Greg and I are partners.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So where’s your name in the company byline?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She didn’t say anything to that, and I could tell I had struck a nerve.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Whatever, Weasley, should have known you’d be too vanilla to stick out the weekend.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What did you call me?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You heard me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I reached behind her head and gripped her by the hair again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Alright then,” I said, thumbing her plush lips with my other hand. I reached into my pocket, pulled out the leash, and clipped it to her necklace. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t say I didn’t give you an out.”</span>
