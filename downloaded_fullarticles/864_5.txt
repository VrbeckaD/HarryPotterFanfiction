  <strong>PART ONE</strong>
</p>

  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Draco sat up on the bed with a gasp. He tried to look around the room, but his head was throbbing too badly. </span> <span class="s1"><em>What the hell happened</em>? he wondered. A sharp pain went through his head, and he had to lie back down, closing his eyes once more. His senses were finally connecting to his brain. He was in a bed, he had the worst headache he had ever had in his life, and his arm was burning where the Dark Mark was. </span></p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Wait... no, it wasn’t. Eyes still shut, Draco moved his hand towards his arm. What should have been the transfer of skin to the bumps that made up a menacing skull, was instead just unblemished smoothness. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Squeezing his eyes shut more tightly, Draco frantically felt up and down his arm. His breaths became shallow, and the bed sheets were becoming tangled from all his kicking around. After taking a deep breath, he slowly sat back up, gripping a hand over his forearm. Cracking open an eye, Draco saw himself clutching onto nothing but pale skin.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Dark Mark was gone.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dumbly, Draco stared at his arm until a sharp <em>crack</em> sounded from the foot of the bed, and the over-powering smell of food began seeping through his confusion. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Master Draco? Dobby has brought breakfast for Young Master; Dobby has prepared poached salmon and mint salad, sir. Master Draco is needing to be waking up now." A squeaky voice was at the side of the bed. A small, skinny being with saucer-wide eyes and bat-like ears was holding a breakfast tray of tea and said food.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"<em>Dobby</em>? Is that you?" Draco stared at the house-elf in shock, not believing his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dobby is Dobby, Master Draco. Dobby has brought Master Draco’s breakfast up, sir,“ the house-elf informed. He looked exactly as Draco remembered him: Ratty uniform, all skin and bones, and giant, green eyes. Yet it didn’t make any sense.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I... I thought you were freed.” <em>Plus you disappeared when I was in the second year.</em> Horror filled the house-elf's face at Draco's words.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"N-No! Never will Dobby leave Master’s house, sir! Honest!" The servant dropped the tray, making it cling loudly onto the floor as he pulled harshly on his ears. The house-elf squeaked in surprise at the sound and yanked harder at his ears.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But—“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Dobby has been part of Master's family for years and will always be!" Dobby got on his hands and knees and started slamming his head onto the floor, barely missing the broken glass. "Bad Dobby! Bad for making Master Draco think Dobby was free!"</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dobby, please, calm down!" Draco jumped out of bed, pulling on the pillowcase uniform to stop any more harm. Glassy eyes looked up at him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Master Draco has never been so good to Dobby before," Dobby simpered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I'm having a good morning," Draco snapped, confusion souring his temper. "Where's my wand? I’ll clean this up,” he said as he nodded over to the broken china and the spilled tea.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A wand will be given to Master Draco today! Today, Master's family is to be going to Diagon Alley to buy supplies for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! Let Dobby clean it, sir." A loud snap of Dobby's bony fingers and the tray was as good as new, the mess completely gone.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What? Today?” Nothing was making sense. <em>Why is Dobby here? What does he mean I'll be getting my wand today? I already have my wand... Don't I?</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Master is wanting his son to be ready by noon. Best hurry, Master Draco." Another crack and Dobby was gone, leaving the blond to figure out the conversation alone. Didn't he have his wand? Why was he supposed to be getting ready? Why was Dobby here? He had too many questions.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Getting my supplies?" Draco's eyes widened as he suddenly realised that something wasn’t right with his voice. A hand flew up to his throat. His voice was higher.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1" align="left">
  <span class="s1">Springing up from the floor, he rushed to the mirror in the corner of the room that he finally recognised as his childhood bedroom. A pale, pointy face stared back at him, looking shocked. Large, grey eyes went wide. He was wearing black silk pyjamas which had sleeves that were too long, making it so that only his fingertips stuck out. His blond, baby-fine hair was in the messiest bedhead. Draco swallowed thickly, biting back the scream in his throat. Everything was numb. He couldn’t feel anything.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5199b31864a3504922afcfcc7810691b/tumblr_ovu6gn9rPP1wwg2jao1_540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="681" align="center" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1406605475" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1406605475" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was eleven. An eleven-year-old boy. <em>Again</em>. As if the last six years had never happened. Like it was all some... dream. Was all of that a dream? His entire life, nothing more than figments of the imagination of an eleven-year-old boy? Going to Hogwarts and being forced to become a...</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No. It couldn't have been. It was all too vivid. It was too <em>real</em>. It actually happened, and he was certain of it. He brought his attention back to the mirror.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco was a good foot shorter and hadn't yet grown into his features as well as he later would, but what really got him was his eyes. It was his eyes. His <em>seventeen-year-old eyes</em>. They held so much age, belonging to a person who had already seen too much. They were no longer shining silver but rather were weathered down into a bleak grey. His eyes travelled around the room.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was his room all right, filled with his dusty storybooks and his racing broom that was leaning against the bookshelf. Moving pictures of Quidditch players took over a select spot on the wall.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>What is happening?</em> The room was spinning, everything in his entire body felt nauseated. Draco wrapped his arms around himself in an attempt to stop shaking.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Was this another chance? To do what? To do the same thing? Or to change something, perhaps. He thought back to... ten minutes ago.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">"HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!" Voldemort yelled.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">"No!" the Weasley girl shouted, rushing forward in desperation, only to be held back.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">Voldemort, powerful and now unchallenged, began speaking of a new Wizarding World. A better one, a perfect one. Where only the pure could thrive without those infected with muggle blood to tarnish their beliefs. He asked for those who wanted to join him to come over to the crowd of Death Eaters, spewing promises of survival and riches.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">"Draco!" Draco's father was yelling at him to come over to their side. Draco did not move.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">“Draco, come, please,“ his mother tried as well. He glanced at the Dark Lord, then at the students and professors of Hogwarts who were watching him with baited breath.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">“No.” He didn’t leave from his spot. Voldemort's eyes narrowed at him, anger filling them and making the red irises seemingly darken.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1"><em> <span class="s1">“It seems like young Malfoy thinks he is too </span> </em> <span class="s1">good</span> <em> <span class="s1"> for us.” The Dark Lord’s voice was cold, unforgiving. “Young Malfoy thinks... he is better than us.” A ripple of laughter went through the Death Eaters standing behind him. “Well... I think this is a perfect opportunity to show everyone here what happens after you make such a statement.”</span> </em></p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">Draco knew what was going to happen.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em> <span class="s1">"AVADA KEDAVRA!" Draco hit the ground.</span> </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"But what happened after that?" Draco asked himself. <em>I woke up in my bed, eleven years old again.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How was he even here? Why was he even here? What was he supposed to do? Not die? His survival was not necessary for victory.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Harry Potter's survival was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Did Potter actually die? Draco didn’t think so. Even he accepted that Potter's the strongest wizard in the world, especially considering he could cause Voldemort such fear. He couldn’t have just died. Was that what he was supposed to do then? Help Potter not die this time?</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was. Merlin, it <em>was</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Master Draco? It is time for you to leave." Dobby apparated in to see him still not ready. "Master Draco is still not dressed?!"</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tell them...“ Draco ran his hands through his hair, trying to calm himself with deep breaths. ”Tell my parents that I shall be down in a minute. It took me awhile to wake up.” To wake up, indeed.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As he was getting dressed, Draco made himself a vow: <em>This time will be different.</em></span>
</p>
