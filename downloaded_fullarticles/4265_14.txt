          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tom watched.</p>
<p>It was cruel, almost, how perfect those fingers were, as they reached down into the bowl and drew out a small seed. Red flesh covering hard, white stone. It was horrid, almost, how beautiful those lips seemed to be, as they parted slowly and sucked the seed in. Those pretty white teeth were tainted pink with the juice. It was awful, almost, how that same mouth let out a low chuckle, sneering at the staring boy with an amused sort of spite. Oh, and how that tongue snaked out to lick those lips clean, it wasâ€¦ Repulsive. Almost.</p>
<p>"Anything wrong, Tom?"</p>
<p>"No, Abraxas, I remain perfectly well, thank you."</p>
<p>There it was again, that irritating chuckle, that made him have difficulty keeping himself from leaping out of his seat and devouring those lips, there and then.</p>
<p>"If you say so, snake."</p>
<p>It was then, on that day, that he decided he hated Abraxas Malfoy.</p>
<p>Almost.</p></div>
