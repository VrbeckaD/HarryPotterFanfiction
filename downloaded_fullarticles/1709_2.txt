  <em>Dearest Petunia,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Per your last letter, I've sent this letter through the ordinary method of mail - I hope the mailman gets this to you on time! Please pass on my apology to Vernon for startling him with the owl.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you so much for the Christmas present, James and I love it. He thinks we should keep lilies and petunias in it, though I was thinking of peonies instead, for mother. Remember when I first found out peonies were flowers? We were the Flower Girls.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I imagine if Harry had been a girl I might have called her Peony too. Or Iris. Hyacinth Potter sounds out of sort, don't you think?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you and Vernon liked the present from us. We tried our best to find something that seemed to suit your tastes, though I made sure to tuck in the receipt if you'd rather swap it out for something else.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Speaking of presents, I know it's six months out yet, but any ideas for Dudley's first birthday? I want to be prepared. Harry's growing out of his clothes like mad, so I've found clothes presents to be helpful but very brief! Maybe one of those Etch-a-Sketch boards? Or that telephone with the little face maybe?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Let me know!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I wondered if you might want to visit one day? If Vernon doesn't, that's quite alright. It would be nice to see you in person again, that's all. We could go out for coffee, if you'd rather.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love, Lily</em>
