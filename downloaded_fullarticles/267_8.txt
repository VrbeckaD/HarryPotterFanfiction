    <p>With a thud, she dropped the large stack of papers down onto the table by his bedside - a pile of her notes, which she had made two copies of for his sake, the homework assignments they’d been given that day, and a few of his textbooks, which Harry had handed off to her on his way to Quidditch practice. </p>
<p>“All that? From one day?” Ron stared at her in disbelief, and grimaced at the stack, which seemed to appear larger by the minute. He’d finally agreed to going to Madam Pompfrey after the bite on his hand had begun to ooze eerily, and for a few sacred hours, had been relaxing with his hand covered in some odd gauze, grateful for the break from classes. </p>
<p>But of course, Hermione never failed to make sure he was up to speed on his homework. </p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, narrowing her eyes at the grimace on his face. “And if you’re going to look so disappointed, next time you wind up in here, I won’t bring you your homework and you’ll have to spend much longer getting caught up.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, but she saw his lips twitch upwards into a small smile as he mumbled, “Thanks.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.” She sat down on the stool beside his bed and let out a heavy sigh, pulling a book of her own out of her bag. “Harry’s at Quidditch practice,” she explained, “If you want to start on homework now, I’ll do it with you. You didn’t miss much in Charms, we’re still working on the Softening Charm - ”</p>
<p>“I’ve barely been here two hours and you’re already asking me to do homework with you?” He shook his head, “I’m injured, woman!” </p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at his hand, which, though bandaged, he seemed perfectly able to wave it around in the air with no pain at all. </p>
<p>“I’m offering to help you, you know.”</p>
<p>He grinned and let out a laugh. “I’m seriously injured. You may just have to do my homework without me.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha. Next time you end up in here, I’m definitely not letting you see my notes.”</p>
<p>“Well then, I guess I’ll just have to keep myself out of trouble for the next seven years, huh?”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>She opened up her book, a small smile on his face, and he reached over to grab the first page of her notes off the top of the stack. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, for both of them, it was not their last time in the Hospital Wing - not just during their time at Hogwarts, but during that year. A few months later, Madam Pomfrey was startled in the middle of the night as the two of them came stumbling through the double doors, Ron limping slightly and Hermione dragging him along, clearly strained by his weight. </p>
<p>“Ron’s been hurt - “</p>
<p>“Harry’s down below, with the Stone - “</p>
<p>“We’ve just talked to Dumbledore, he’s gone to get Harry, he told us to come here - “</p>
<p>“Harry will probably be here soon - “</p>
<p>“There was this giant chess piece, Ron was unconscious, he only just woke up and we ran up here as fast as we could - “</p>
<p>They erupted into a cacophony of explanations - Madam Pomfrey could barely keep up. “Quiet!” she demanded, raising a hand and eyeing the two of them. “Now slowly - what happened?” </p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, after a lengthy explanation involving a rather gruesome game of chess, Madam Pomfrey had successfully mended the red-haired boy’s foot, which had appeared to be broken, and had already begun to tend to the dark haired, bespeckled boy, who had just arrived in the company of Albus Dumbledore. “Is he okay?” the other two questioned, as Harry Potter slept. </p>
<p>“He’ll be okay,” Albus Dumbledore reassured. </p>
<p>Hermione Granger sat by Ron Weasley’s side all night, the two of them worriedly watching Harry’s steady breathing in the bed across from Ron’s, until Madam Pomfrey gave him permission to leave and ushered him out.</p>
