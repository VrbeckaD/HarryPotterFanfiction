    <p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Now Come on!” cried Albus, “We don't have much time!”</p>
<p>“Make sure we got everything first!” said Scorpius frantically, and Albus groaned in irritation. “We've already checked it, thrice! We got everything! We'd better hurry up before dad comes here!”</p>
<p>Albus watched as his brother paced around the room like a headless chicken, making him grab a handful of his hair as he shouted in frustration, “Scorpius!”</p>
<p>“Alright!” Scorpius exhaled loudly, “Sorry, I'm just very nervous about this.”</p>
<p>Albus sighed seeing his brother's expression, he can't help but softened, “I know, but we have to do this. Together.”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked up to him and smiled, “Together.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” he continued, and took a deep breath to calm himself, “Alright, three past possessions of the intended. Papa’s robe?”</p>
<p>Albus picked up the old robe with the Slytherin crest and nodded, “Here.”</p>
<p>“Papa’s old books?”</p>
<p>“Check!”</p>
<p>“Papa’s 18 year old photo?”</p>
<p>“Very handsome, here!”</p>
<p>“Wait, are you sure those books were the one papa used in his 8th year?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Albus rolled his eyes, “Proceed!”</p>
<p>“Alright!" Scorpius clasped his hand together. "Next, you've memorised the spells?”</p>
<p>“Scorp, we've memorised it together!”</p>
<p>“I'm just making sure!” Scorpius huffed, “Alright then, let's begin.”</p>
<p>Together, they gathered the possessions in a center, making sure everything was in place before they stood facing each other in between the piles. “Wands ready?”</p>
<p>Albus held up the familiar ten inched hawthorn wand, as the holly wand with phoenix feather core sat firmly in Scorpius’ hand.</p>
<p>“Dad's going to kill us both,” said Scorpius.</p>
<p>“Not if we're trying to save the love of his life.” Albus countered.</p>
<p>“The love of our life.” said Scorpius, eyes flared with determination and Albus grinned.</p>
<p>They looked into each other's eyes and with a nod, Scorpius began the incantation and Albus followed. They recited the spells over and over again, overlapping each other's voices until a soft glow emerged through the possessions, creeping towards their bodies, seeping through their clothes and skins. The lights were becoming brighter and brighter around them, and Albus quickly held onto Scorpius’ hand when they felt the pressure of air pressing from all directions, sucking their bodies into thin air leaving two wands clucking innocently down the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first thing Albus felt the moment his arse touchdown was the solid ground. He made a quick pat around his body to ensure everything was intact.</p>
<p>“Oh dear Merlin, I'm alive! Scorpius, we're alive!”<br/>He looked around for his brother only to see him standing in front of an old lady with a stern face, who was looking at him with a pair of wise eyes.</p>
<p>“Al, come here!” Scorpius whispered sharply and Albus scrambled to his leg in an instant, walking towards his brother with a quick pace.</p>
<p>“Al, this is Headmistress McGonagall and we're currently at the Headmistress’ office.” said Scorpius carefully once Albus stood next to him, his eyes were wild despite his calm demeanor and Albus know how much his brother wanted to expressed their success; a proper manner however, was what they need to show in front of a stranger- that was what papa always said.</p>
<p>Headmistress McGonagall carved a warm smile as she regarded them both. “Nice to meet you both, gentlemen.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too, Headmistress McGonagall.” replied Albus politely, a beat after his brother.</p>
<p>“I am sure there was a definite explanation regarding the sudden appearance of you both at Hogwarts and specifically at my office.” said McGonagall kindly, but her eyes were firm and calculating, darting back and forth between the two of them.</p>
<p>“I was just about to explain to the Headmistress about our situation when you arrived.” said Scorpius, silently asking Albus with his eyes. When Albus nodded, Scorpius turned his attention towards Headmistress McGonagall and smiled confidently.</p>
<p>“Headmistress, my name is Scorpius Hyperion Potter and this is my twin brother, Albus Severus Potter.” said Scorpius with determination. When McGonagall’s eyes widened with surprise, Scorpius immediately continued, “We are Harry Potter's sons.”</p>
<p>There were a few moments of silence as the two of them watched as Headmistress McGonagall pressed her lips together as if contemplating the information she has just received. “Harry Potter's son.” she began, and they nodded. “I am sure Mr. Potter is currently sitting at the Great Hall with his friends.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but we don't really mind about dad.” said Albus, “We’ve traveled back in time in order to save our papa.”</p>
<p>“Albus!” scolded Scorpius and McGonagall raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You see, Headmistress,” Albus continued, ignoring his brother exasperated face, “Our papa is currently has fallen ill, he's been cursed- a curse that turned his blood into poisons, and the only person who can save him is his very own self.”</p>
<p>McGonagall pursed her lips with a pinched look, “You were hoping that the both of you will get the help you've wanted by meeting with the younger version of your father?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” They chorused in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“And by sheer dumb luck, trust and faith, the both of you decided to travel back in time without thinking of the danger and the consequences of your action.”<br/>McGonagall only received a twin of sheepish smiles, that she was pretty sure belonged to Harry Potter. “May I know why the both of you decided to act on your own without getting the help of the adults?”</p>
<p>“They were too busy being intelligent and searching for complex solutions!” cried Albus, and Scorpius facepalm, giving up of his brother's manner. “Papa is getting weaker by the day and it's only a matter of time for his body to shut down!”</p>
<p>“Albus, calm down.” Scorpius hissed but again, he was ignored.</p>
<p>“Headmistress, we've heard from the healer that there was no solution for papa’s curse because it was an old curse." explained Albus. "We tried to help by reading books about curses and Scorpius found one solution which involved papa’s virgin blood. That was the reason why we're here.” said Albus firmly, his eyes determined as they met McGonagall’s.</p>
<p>McGonagall tried to suppress her smile seeing the familiar expression of the child in front of her. “And how sure are both of you of your father's virgin identity?”</p>
<p>When the two boys shared a look, McGonagall can't help the strange instincts that she knows the identity of their other father.</p>
<p>“We had our trusted sources, Headmistress.” Scorpius smiled innocently, and McGonagal was sure she could confirm her suspicion.</p>
<p>“Very well, I am sure for your dangerous effort,” McGoganall began, making the two boys winced at her words, “The only thing I can provide for the both of you is to help you as much as I can give.”</p>
<p>Albus whooped and Scorpius dropped his jaw in disbelief, “That's it? You just put your trust in us that easily?”</p>
<p>“Travelling back in time requires the caster’s purposes. If the caster’s purposes can threaten the balance of magic, the magic itself won't allow the travelling.” explained McGonagall calmly.</p>
<p>“But you believe that we're Harry Potter's sons?” asked Scorpius, feeling a little bit hysterical that they were just granted help from McGonagall herself.</p>
<p>“I'm pretty sure you won't be here if you were not Harry Potter's sons.” McGonagall pointed out, and Albus broke into a fit of giggles that got a smile from Scorpius.</p>
<p>McGonagall smiled despite herself. “Come now, children. It's dinner time and I'm sure you're hungry.”</p>
<p>A set of identical grins answered her invitation. They were making their way towards the gargoyle when Scorpius timidly tugged down McGonagall’s robe.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Potter?”</p>
<p>“Headmistress, I wonder if you can transfigure our clothes into Hogwarts uniform?”</p>
<p>McGonagall regarded the two boys, both eyes shining with hopes and she sighed internally, “May I ask what house of Hogwarts do you both prefer?”</p>
<p>The twins then grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. McGonagall is now very sure of their other father's identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Merlin’s beard!”</p>
<p>Harry heard the chaos before he heard Ron's exclamation. He followed Ron's line of sight along with the rest of the student to see Headmistress McGonagall strived into the Great Hall with two little boys on her tail, watching their surroundings with great interest.</p>
<p>They were identical; twins.</p>
<p>The only feature that separated their looks was the colour of their hair. Whilst they were matching sets of unruly hair, one of the boys had midnight black hair while the other had a white-blond hair.</p>
<p>He gaped.</p>
<p>“Are those Slytherin uniforms?” asked Ginny with bewilderment, asking no one in particular.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell, mate.” Ron commented, “Did someone shrink the Slytherins?”</p>
<p>“I don't think so, Ron,” said Hermione, “They look pretty excited for students who were just being shrunk.”</p>
<p>Harry had to agree. The two boys were practically skipping through their steps, as they followed McGonagall proceeding towards the High Table. The boys took their seats when McGonagall conjured a high chair for the both of them and Harry had to admit that the sight was pretty adorable.</p>
<p>“Today, we received special guests from far away,” McGonagall began as the students quieted down. "They are very precious guests to me. Therefore, I look forward to good cooperation from all of you. Apart from that, I would also like to address; under my protection, there shall be no harm to be done for the both of them or they shall receive a fair punishment.”</p>
<p>“Who in the right mind wants to harm children?” Ron snorted, a beat after McGonagall has concluded her speech while eyeing the two boys. “I mean, despite the Slytherin’s robes, they were kind of adorable. Don't you think, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Yea.” Harry agreed. He can't completely point out, but there was definitely something about the boys that got him unable to take his eyes off. “Why do you think they were here?”</p>
<p>“Probably just visiting.” said Hermione.</p>
<p>“They seem familiar, don't you think?” Ginny tilted her head, calculating with her eyes. “As if we've seen them before.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, “That's what I thought too.”</p>
<p>Foods forgotten, Harry put his attention towards the boys who were helping themselves with food, while his friends resumed their activities.</p>
<p>Sometimes the boys will look up and drag their delighted eyes throughout the Great Hall, taking the scenery around them and sometimes they will look at the students, table from table as if they were looking for something. They talked to each other, and politely exchanged conversations with some of the professors. Too engrossed with his watching, he was startled when the boy with the black hair suddenly turned his head towards their table and locked his eyes with him. The boy raised an eyebrow, his expression uncanningly reminded him of <em>someone</em>- he can't help but taken aback. He reached for the nearest person and continuously prodded his index finger at them, fishing for attention.</p>
<p>“What, Harry?” asked Hermione, who turned out to be the victim of Harry's jab attack. She swatted Harry's finger away, a little frown decorating her face.</p>
<p>“Did you guys see that?” Harry pointed to the boys, ignoring the look on her face. “One of them just looks at me- dead in the eyes- like he's challenging me!”</p>
<p>His three friends looked at one another with the same confused look upon their faces, but decided to humour Harry and followed the direction of where Harry has pointed out to see the two boys were whispering with each other; the black haired boy mindlessly gestured to their table. After exchanging a few more whispers, the black haired boy looked at their table again, this time followed by the white-blond haired boy. They shared a look full of mischief, locking their eyes to Harry and <em>smirked</em>.</p>
<p>Ginny and Hermione gasped as Ron choked into his drink. “I know that look anywhere!” Ron coughed heavily, “As much as I hate it!”</p>
<p>“They- they remind me of-"</p>
<p>“Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Hermione sharply threw her wild gaze at Harry and frowned, lips pursed together but nodded slowly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>A sudden delight of shriek from the High Table grabbed their attention. Both of the boys’ eyes widened with a great amount of happiness and anticipation; opened and bright. The identical grinned turns into a full blown smile as they stared at the front of the Great Hall with wonders.</p>
<p>Harry bemusedly followed their eyesight to see Draco Malfoy strode down the Great Hall together with his friends approaching the Slytherin’s table. Before he can even comprehend the situation, the sound of fallen chairs caught his ears and he watched in bewilderment as the two boys runs with all their might towards the Malfoy’s heir and knocked him down the floor with an identical shouts of,</p>
<p>“Papa!”</p>
