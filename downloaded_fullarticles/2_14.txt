    <p>I woke up on my eleventh birthday with excitement. It was a Saturday, which would normally mean I’d sleep til noon, but it’s not every day you turn eleven, so I was up by nine. I could smell my mum making eggs and bacon, so I hurried downstairs.</p>
<p>Mum kissed me on the top of my head and told me to sit down, and I began shoveling food in my mouth. Once she and Dad sat down, they began their adult talk: politics, weather, gossip about the neighbours, etc. I stayed quiet, thinking of how old I was getting. Maybe I should start looking for grey hairs, I jokingly thought to myself.</p>
<p>I stared out the large kitchen window, people-watching. It’s extremely difficult to people-watch, however, if there’s no people to be watching! I got so caught up in the frustration that all the pedestrians in London had suddenly disappeared overnight, when I caught a disgusting whiff of something. I saw smoke.</p>
<p>“Dad, the oven’s burning!” I managed to get out, just before flames erupted. This was especially strange, considering the oven wasn’t even on.</p>
<p>We all jumped up, and mum and dad sprayed the oven with the fire extinguisher. I’d hoped that wasn’t the highlight of the day. I soon got distracted by the mail truck heading down the street. I grew excited, as I always enjoy being the person to grab the mail. </p>
<p>I sorted through the five envelopes: three bills, a birthday card from my gran, and another letter for me that I didn’t recognise. Laying the other four on the front table near the door, I sat on the sofa to open the strange letter. What was so odd about it is how it was addressed. It read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sabrina Stratford</p>
<p>Small Second-Floor Bedroom</p>
<p>16 Shawfield Street</p>
<p>Chelsea</p>
<p>London</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper of the envelope was very old-fashioned. It seemed to be made from parchment, and there was a red wax seal on the back that had the letter “H”, surrounded by a lion, eagle, badger, and snake. There was no stamp or return address.</p>
<p>I opened the letter, very curious. There were three pieces of parchment inside. The first one read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster</p>
<p>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Supreme Mugwump, International Confederation of Wizards),</p>
<p>Dear Miss Stratford,</p>
<p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1st September. We await your owl by no later than 31st July.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall,</p>
<p>Deputy Headmistress</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was utterly baffled. I’d think this is a prank, but even I, who was notorious for being mischievous, wouldn’t go so far to scope out where a person slept. I wondered how this arrived in my mail slot without a stamp. I continued to read, to see if I could find out more information. The second piece of parchment was a list. It detailed that students would have to wear robes, and there was a book list. My goodness, the kinds of books that were listed! I couldn’t tell which was funnier, the titles of the books or the names of the authors. I nearly fell over laughing when I read that Magical Drafts and Potions was written by one “Arsenius Jigger”.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be required that students should purchase a wand, cauldron, and a few other items. Oh, and of course, I should be well informed that first years are not permitted to bring their own broomsticks, silly me!</p>
<p>I didn’t believe any of this rubbish for a second. This was probably some advertisement for a cult of some kind. Of course, there was a part in the back of my mind that tugged at me. It sounded awfully marvelous. I mean, could you imagine? Going to a school to learn magic?</p>
<p>I decided to go back into the kitchen to show Mum. She was reading a book and had a cup of tea in her hand. “Mum!” I called, “You’ll never believe what rubbish was sent to me. Read this,”</p>
<p>I handed her the envelope and she proceeded to read the parchment. After a few minutes, she handed them back to me and said, seemingly uninterested, “I don’t know who sent it to you or their intentions, but I suggest you throw it out.”</p>
<p>I was a bit disappointed. Whoever wrote it clearly put effort into all of the little details, and I really wanted to put it up on my bulletin board. “Yes, ma’am,” I went back upstairs and started to toss the envelope out, but I stopped myself. Instead, I walked up to my bed and, lifting my mattress, placed it underneath. I let go of the mattress and went to go see what was on television.</p>
