    <p>“Thirteen cases with escaping evidence, eight cases with unnecessary causalities, five cases where the statue of secrecy was broken due to No-Maj exposure to the content of said cases, three cases remaining unsolved due to lack of information, and two cases with the jury still indecisive due to <em>your</em> Auror’s misconduct during fieldwork. What is your response, Mr. Graves?”</p>
<p>President Picquery’s words echoes across the chamber, the meeting room dim and cold as her glare sweeps over the sparse crowd, her curt words a foreboding promise to any who dared to defy her. The room was filled with only the directors and second in commands of every department, a total of twenty-six members desperately trying to fill the space meant for hundreds. Her posture was stiff and regal, face calm and unyielding as her words continued to ring out over the scattered crowd, bouncing off the walls as her voice reverberated around the room.</p>
<p>Percival Graves stood from his seat, his second in command, Josephine Hudson, shifting tensely in her seat as the members of the meeting turned their sights to him. It was a rarity for Graves to be brought to attention, his department the shining glory of MACUSA, and since his promotion to Director, there had yet to be a scandal or incident to earn his department a single smudge to its record. At least, until a few months prior, when every criminal from Seattle to New York had seemed to find the wealth held in the magical beast trade. The rise of wizards and squibs buying and selling creatures for profit, ingredients for the dark arts, breeding, potions, and the many healing properties of the beasts’ insides drew the rich and poor alike to the lucrative business. It was a slew of cruel and inhumane cases, some of the crime scenes leaving a foul taste in Graves’s mouth. The heightened crime in one of America’s busiest cities, matched with MACUSA left in the dark on all things relating to magical creatures, leading to Picquery looking murderous at the mere mention of a murtlap.</p>
<p>“My senior Aurors are working around the clock to close these cases, but due to the absent knowledge of these beasts and their…habits, my men and I are working with what we can.” Graves concludes, his pride refusing to let him take the full brunt of the blame. </p>
<p>But, what he said was the truth – just last week Hudson herself had a nasty run in with a Jarvey, the sly burrowing beast  giving Hudson a harsh bite on her ankle and then going on to extensively insulting her mother. Yesterday, one of his Aurors almost had his arm ripped off by an angry Clabbert, and the day before that, Goldstein had almost been run over by a ten foot tall Nogtail. </p>
<p>During these times, he could not blame his employees for not following procedure for almost being run over by a very large pig-looking beast or being mauled by a glowing bald monkey. Graves could readily admit that this department was being overwhelmed by the growing obscurity of the situations, which much was obvious due to the extensive reports which had seemed to always find a way to his inbox. Despite this, Graves knew his Aurors were the best in North America as he had handpicked them himself. His senior employees worked hard and didn’t complain about the policies or rules. They understood the importance of their job, and did the best they could with the tools provided.<br/>
“Are you saying that none of this is your fault?” Picquery dares; spine straight and regal as she looked down at him from her perch on her golden chair.</p>
<p>Before Graves could reply, his back straight and lips parted when a scoff from the other side of the room draws all attention away from him, all eyes settling to a weasel-like man sitting closest to the door, a vaguely familiar smirk known to many of the Department Heads. Mr. Jerry Jones was not a well-known man, but was something akin to a phenomenon due to his surprising and sudden promotion to becoming the director of the Magical Cleaning Department last month. Jones’s beady eyes rose from the floor, and settles upon the broad shoulders of Graves. </p>
<p>“Anything to add, Mr. Jones?” President Picquery growls, a silent threat which Graves had no doubt she would follow through with.</p>
<p>Graves had seen the same gaze many times during his schooling, and despite being from different houses and different class years, Picquery was something akin to an urban legend within Ilvermorny. Even back then, she had been well known for being an untouchable beauty, a woman who strode with all the power a teenager could have while wearing a knee-length plaid skirt and button up blouse. She had been a student who was rarely seen outside of the classroom, one who disappeared within the tall towering shelves of the library and only left to seek retribution on some poor sod who had managed to ignite the fury of Seraphina.</p>
<p>Jones, however, unlike many of the room’s inhabitants, had not attended Ilvermorny with Picquery. At her words, the man took them as permission to speak, rather than to cower, and steps forward from the dark shroud of the doorway. Hudson leans forward in her seat beside Graves, a predatory glint in her eye as she watches the growing spectacle.</p>
<p>“I just find it hard to believe, is all. How can some of the best Aurors in America be foiled by a handful of animals? Are your men,” Hudson growls, her right hand twitching towards her wand, “so inept that they can be outsmarted by a couple of beasts?” </p>
<p>“May I, Sir?” Hudson mutters, wand now in hand as she leans forward further, legs tense and ready to lunge at the rodent-like man smirking down at them. The last thing Graves needs was another report, let alone one on why his second in command had decided to hex one of her superiors.</p>
<p>Graves waves his hand in dismissal, just as Picquery turns her attention back to him, Hudson relaxing back into her seat as she even goes as far as to offer a smile to the regal woman. Picquery simply ignores the seated woman, turning to Graves with a glint of hidden mirth in her golden eyes. </p>
<p>“And your response to this, Mr. Graves?” Picquery queries, a small upwards tilt of her lips seen in the corner of his eye as Graves starts. </p>
<p>“I believe if Mr. Jones believes he is better suited to classify and contain the Yeti wandering the sewers in Chinatown than cleaning up after the paper mice downstairs; then he is free to take Mrs. Goodwin’s place.” Graves replies coolly, ignoring the stuttering man. </p>
<p>“’Ey now! I wasn’t offerin’ my services-“Jones protested. </p>
<p>Picquery set her sights on the man below her, “Mr. Jones, if you have enough time to waste time during this meeting then it must mean you have enough time to help protect the Statue of Secrecy. Should I remind you that because of these unsolved cases that our Obliviators are working nonstop to keep the peace between No-Maj and Wizard kind. We are in a time of tension; one misstep, and everything falls apart.”</p>
<p>If it was possible, the room grows colder. Graves knew Picquery spoke the truth, the New Salemers’ crowds grew larger and larger with every strange occurrence, magical or not. Unrest silently flourished like a disease, as Grindelwald’s forces advanced with every passing day over in Europe, the man’s words reaching even the ears of wizards in America. With a wave of her hand, the President dismissed them, tension creasing her brow as she kept her chin level. Graves stayed standing, keeping his place as the departments filed out with hushed whispers. Hudson gave him a nod as she left as well, her blond hair never straying from her tight bun as she closed the oak doors behind herself. </p>
<p>“Percival.” Picquery started, eyes never straying from the closed door.</p>
<p>“Seraphina.” </p>
<p>“I want these cases solved, Percival. No exceptions.” Picquery spoke, her voice soft in the empty room. It was a haunting sound, the feeling of an impossible task being placed on Graves’s shoulders as he stood still.</p>
<p>“Have I ever failed you, Sera.” Graves stated. </p>
<p>He was a Graves, and failure had never been in his vocabulary. He steps down from his spot next to her, crossing the room with echoing steps as he reached for the door. </p>
<p>“You fail me now, Graves.”</p>
