    <p>The grass beneath Draco's head wasn't quite as soft as he hoped it would be. But he had decided to lie down on it, and he wasn't planning on getting up anytime soon. </p><p>Approaching footsteps caught Draco's attention, but he was too humiliated from his team's recent defeat to bother lifting his head to see who it was. </p><p>"Mind if I join you?" a voice asked. Regretfully, it was the voice of Harry Potter, the captain of the team that had just brutally demolished Draco's. </p><p>"Mm," Draco grunted noncommittally.</p><p>Harry sat down on the ground beside him. "Upset about losing, huh?"</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>"This is your first loss in a while, isn't it? It'll be okay, buddy. You'll get through it."</p><p>Draco turned his head to glare at the Tutshill Tornados Seeker. He wore an expression of amused concern, which only served to further infuriate Draco. "Don't condescend to me, Potter."</p><p>Harry raised his hands in mock surrender. "Hey, just trying to help."</p><p>A silence stretched between them, during which Draco took the opportunity to peruse his rival. Harry was still dressed in his light blue Quidditch robes, emblazoned with Beater bats and a Bludger. He also looked much too lively for someone who had just played in a 5-hour Quidditch match. His green eyes flashed with energy, his grin was full of vigour, and the dirt on his skin just added to his rugged charm.</p><p>It was at that exact moment that rain began to pour down over the pitch. Draco groaned as moisture soaked through his yellow Wimbourne Wasps uniform. He must look like the sorriest excuse for a Quidditch captain in Wizarding history. "Fuck this sodding rain."</p><p>"I dunno," Harry replied. "I quite like it."</p><p>Draco looked at him in disbelief. "You're having me on."</p><p>"No, I'm serious. Rainy weather is my favourite kind." Harry grinned and stood up. He extended a hand to Draco. "Come on, let's get out of the rain before it ruins your beautiful hair."</p><p>Draco ignored the offered hand, but stood up anyway. "Glad my hair is receiving the praise it deserves, even from the likes of you."</p><p>Harry laughed. "Come on, I'll buy you a drink."</p><p>"Fine."</p>
