  <em>Once a King or Queen of Narnia,</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Always a King or Queen.</em>
</p><p>Twenty years after the death of her siblings, Susan thought that things had settled. She'd accepted their death, and accepted that in the end she'd been wrong and they'd been right. After all, she now lived in a world of magic didn't she? If fairies and Goblins and Leprechauns could be real then why not Talking Beasts? And Wizarding history spoke of alternate worlds as a definite reality. Who was she to argue with the reality of Narnia? If anything, her place was one of guilt and shame, for she was the one the one who had forsworn Narnia - she who had once been Narnia's Queen. <br/>And then Fate conspired to wreck her life once again.<br/>Caught between a werewolf-hating fanatical husband and a newly-turned son can Susan Lupin nee Pevensie find the heart and soul that once made her She Who is Given Unto The Radiant Southern Sun, Queen Susan the Gentle, of Narnia?</p></div>
