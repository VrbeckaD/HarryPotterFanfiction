    <p>Remus had been aware of his feelings for Sirius for a while. He believed the pinnacle point was when the other boy had betrayed his secret near the end of their fifth year, using his Lycanthropy for revenge. It was the feeling of absolute betrayal that it had been <em>Sirius</em> who had almost turned him into a monster that pushed him into the realisation that his feelings had long since passed the point of platonic.</p><p>Regardless, if Remus was good at one thing, it was suffering in silence. In the long months that followed the now classified ‘Incident’, he had been successful in shutting Sirius out. To begin with, his indignant rage had been the cause of rift in their friendship, but once Remus had all but forgiven the other, he found it easier if Sirius remained at arm’s length.</p><p>But of course, life has a way of screwing up one’s plans.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“Moony, this has gone past the point of ridiculousness! I know you forgave him ages ago. So why are you still ignoring him?!’</p><p>“James, look… its complicated.”</p><p>“Remus, please. Enough is enough.”</p><p>Remus sighed as he looked into his friends exasperated eyes. He and James had managed to grow even closer in the wake of the ‘Incident’. Initially Remus believed it was due to James’ guilt. But as time passed, he realised it was because of his stilted friendship with Sirius that allowed him to spend more time with his other friends.</p><p>However, it was the first day of the second term of the 6<sup>th</sup> year, and it seemed James had gotten fed up of watching the two boys grow apart.</p><p>“Come on Remus, why do you still avoid him?” James continued.</p><p>“Prongs, you can hardly say I ignore him when I seem to remember both me and Pads having a nice long conversation in our free this morning,” Remus countered.</p><p>James just glared at Remus, sharply replying, “don’t try to play this off Rem. I know you, I’ve seen how you have distanced yourself from Sirius. And I can see this distance hurts you just as much, if not more, than it does him!”</p><p>“I know your concerned, but…”</p><p>“But what? I am not letting you mope any longer!”</p><p>“Mope?”</p><p>“Mope!”</p><p>Remus looked into his friends concerned, if not slightly frustrated, eyes and let out yet another sigh. “Fine! Fine I will try.”</p><p>At his earnest response, James cracked a smile, his serious demeanour deteriorating as he slapped Remus on his back and left the common rooms, just as Sirius entered, as if by magic.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Since his altercation with James, Remus had begun making more of an effort with Sirius, opening up to the other boy once again. They were able to almost reconcile their prior friendship within the month, leaving all the Marauders pleased.</p><p>Yet with their reborn friendship came stronger feelings. Remus found himself fighting the urge to just touch Sirius, to hold him, to snog him, to confess his feelings. He felt he was going mad.</p><p>Remus also felt the desire to come out. Not because he believed this would help gain Sirius’ affections, but because he held hope that if he could move on with someone else, he would be fine.</p><p>So, after many internal debates, Remus got the other Marauder’s to settle down to come out.</p><p>“Okay, I know you lot are all curious as to why I have called an unscheduled meeting,” Remus began.</p><p>“What prank have you thought of?” James questioned; his excitement clear. Well, understandably too. While Remus often fought the other boys on pranks, he was easily the most creative of the lot, and it tended to be his ideas that were met with the most enthusiasm and respect.  </p><p>“No prank, prongs!” Remus said in response, stifling a laugh as the other boys visibly deflated.</p><p>“Well, if not a prank, what is this about?” Peter injected, before either James or Sirius had a chance to dramatically bemoan this development.</p><p>“Okay, well, I have something I need to tell you guys.”</p><p>“No! NO! You are not allowed to date Evans. She is no—” James began to shout, getting up from his position on Remus’ bed.</p><p>“Shut UP prongs! I doubt that is Moony’s announcement and Lily does NOT belong to you” Sirius shouted in response, pulling his best friend back down onto the bed. “Sorry, do continue Moons,” Sirius added, smiling at Remus in a way that made butterflies erupt in his stomach.</p><p>Fighting the blush that Sirius’ smile had caused, Remus began again. “What I was <em>trying</em> to say, is that yes I have an announcement, once which <em>only</em> concerns me.” Remus paused for dramatic effect, watching the other boys lean inwards in their curiosity. “I’m Bi.”</p><p>He waited with bated breath for his friend’s reactions, only then fearing the possibility they would regret him. But he was brought out of his head by a heavy slap on the back by James, who was looking at him with a huge smile.</p><p>“Good on you for telling us mate,” James stated.</p><p>“Yeah” Peter agreed with a slap of his own.</p><p>James continued with a quick squeeze of Remus’ shoulder, “Seriously mate, thanks for telling us! And if it helps, not to take the moment away from you or anything, but I think I might be the same.”</p><p>Remus felt both elated and shocked, giving James’ knee a squeeze at the announcement.</p><p>“And here I though you were Lily-sexual” Sirius joked, smiling at both Remus and James, letting both know he loved them regardless.</p><p>“I think this calls for a celebration!” Peter added, grinning at the enthusiastic shouts at his suggestion.</p><p>It was only at the end of the night, when all the other boys had passed out from too much firewhiskey drunken from their secret stash that Remus realised he was disappointed that Sirius hadn’t had a similar announcement of his own. And the selfishness of that desire only brought shame.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Since Remus had come out, not a lot had changed. He and Sirius had gotten even closer, though that was more due to the increased amount of time they were spending together since mending their friendship. Yet, this new proximity also called Sirius to once again become more tactile, always coming up with an excuse to touch Remus, making him go mad.</p><p>The only other difference was that a few more men seemed to pay attention to him. As much as that boosted his ego, he still was head over arse for Sirius. A fact that was now harder to hide. He knew it was only a matter of time that one of his friends noticed. Still, he was surprised when after a DADA lesson James asked for a word. The two went in the opposite direction to the Gryffindor common rooms, splitting of to leave a confused Sirius and Peter.</p><p>Once the two had made their way out onto the grounds, James stopped and turned to Remus.</p><p>“I know,” he began.</p><p>Remus felt the prickle of nerves, but kept his cool. “Know what, Potter?”</p><p>“I’ve finally worked out why it took you so long to forgive Padfoot.”</p><p>“And that is?”</p><p>“You’re in love with him aren’t you.”</p><p>Remus wanted to deny the statement, to say he would never have been so stupid as to fall for not only his mate, but his straight mate. He wanted to run away and never have to deal with his feelings. But he knew when to concede defeat. He looked into James eyes and said “Yes. Yes I am.”</p><p>James seemed to deflate at Remus’ confession, no doubt planning on having to fight to get Remus to admit what was clearly painfully obvious.</p><p>“Is that all you wanted to say to me?” Remus continued, filling the silence.</p><p>“How long have you felt this way?”</p><p>“Long enough.”</p><p>“Fuck!” James exhaled, causing Remus to smile at his friend.</p><p>“Yes, fuck.”</p><p>James began walking again, and Remus followed. “I won’t say anything to him, don’t worry.”</p><p>“I know you won’t.”</p><p>“Shit. I hoped you would tell me I was being a daft git again. Fuck.”</p><p>Remus laughed then. “Nope. I’m just stupid.”</p><p>At the self-deprecating tone, James sharply turned to glare at him. “Don’t you dare! You are not stupid and you cannot help who you like. I mean, look at me, if I could help it, do you really think I’d still be after Evans?”</p><p>“I guess I can join you in your unrequited love club.”</p><p>Instead of trying to convince Remus that Lily would come around, James began to focus on the horizon.</p><p>“Oh no. No. Prongs that is your thinking face. You <em>know</em> how I feel about your thinking face!”</p><p>Remus watched with no lack of trepidation as James had a clear light-bulb moment.</p><p>“That’s it!! Remus! Yes!”</p><p>“Fucks sake prongs, whatever it is, no!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“N-O”</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Oh shit, sorry. Look, we are both in…. tough situations, both involved in one-sided affairs. But we also both know something to be universally true. You like what you can’t have.”</p><p>“So…?”</p><p>“So, my bisexual, attractive young friend, be my boyfriend!”</p><p>Remus felt as if something must have malfunctioned either in his brain or James’.</p><p>“What!?”</p><p>“Be my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Look, Prongs, I’m flattered, really, you are a very good mate, and I care a lot for you, but if you think that we should date, then-“</p><p>“No, you idiot! Let’s pretend date! Moony, will you be my fake boyfriend so we can both show what the loves of our lives are missing out on!”</p><p>As much as he loved his friend, Remus was having trouble believing that he wasn’t a complete imbecil at that point in time. “James, I’m sure you think this is a good idea. But that is exactly <em>why</em> it is not.”</p><p>“Why?” James questioned, beginning to pout.</p><p>“Look, convincing Lily we were together wouldn’t be too hard, considering that we don’t see her 24/7, unlike some other people like, I don’t know, Sirius!”</p><p>“Ehh, how hard can it be. We’re both kinda gay, and we can say we are taking things slow as to not ruin our friendship in case it all goes pear shaped.”</p><p>“James, no one in their right mind would believe you’ve moved on from Lily so quick.”</p><p>“Okay… fair point. But, I don’t know, maybe we could say that’s exactly how this began. We can say since I came out and became an option, you have been trying to help me get over Evans. And while I am not fully their yet, a new a beautiful relationship of our own began!”</p><p>“Nope James, I cannot see this working. Plus, that just makes me a rebound!”</p><p>“Exactly! And so when our prospective interests begin to feel the same way, we can break things off and no one would be the wiser!”</p><p>“No James, this will NEVER work!” But Remus found himself slowly warming to the idea.</p><p>“Please Moony,” James begged, pouting as if sensing Remus’ indecision.</p><p>“Look, I’m not saying yes, but what about all the intimate stuff, like kissing and such.”</p><p>James began to smirk. “Well, it would be no chore to give you a kiss or cuddle here and there, but if we are taking things slow and don’t want to upset the group dynamic, we won’t be expected to display PDA all the time.”</p><p>Remus sighed, realising that James would not let this go. “Fine! Fine, but the moment things get weird, or too complex, we are breaking this off.”</p><p>“YES!!!! Oooooh moony, moony moony, I love you too the moon and back!”</p><p>“Also, this means no hitting on or oogling Lily. Can you handle that?!”</p><p>“For the sake of love, I will keep my words and eyes to myself!”</p><p>“Okay then…. Let’s head back in, I’m frozen.”</p><p>“Shall I tell them or you when we get back?”</p><p>“I think its best if we play things cool to begin with, make it seem more natural.”</p><p>“Okay, yeah great idea Moony!”</p>
