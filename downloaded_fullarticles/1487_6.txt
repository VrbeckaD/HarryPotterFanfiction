</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Hail pummeling the castle made studying inside Hogwarts Library impossible for Charlie Weasley. During the worst of it, his brothers Percy and Bill took a break and relaxed with their respective periodicals while Charlie reclined with his textbook in his lap, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>It was easy for Nymphadora Tonks to approach Charlie unnoticed. She tapped his crown. "I thought I'd find you in the library... I'm calling in my marker, <em>Weasley." </em>(1)</p><p>Charlie rose from his chair, towering over the petite Hufflepuff. "That didn't take long; It hasn't even been a week."</p><p>At the mention of his surname, Bill, who had been sitting next to Charlie, folded his copy of <em>The Daily Prophet</em>, and regarded Tonks.</p><p>She straightened. "Oh, hello, William."</p><p>Bill smiled. "Hello, Nymphadora."</p><p>Charlie gasped. <em>Did he just call her...?</em></p><p>Tonks leaned against Bill's desk, her dainty finger twirling a lock of her pink hair. "Sorry, I didn't see you there."</p><p>Charlie's book fell from his relaxed grip. It landed on his foot, snapping him out of his shock, and he quickly retrieved it for fear that Madam Pince might pounce. His gaze alternated between Tonks and Bill with a pinched brow. <em>Am I the only one that noticed…?</em></p><p>Tonks glanced at the familiar headline of the article Bill had been reading:</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>"UNICORN BLACK MARKET RING BAFFLES MINISTRY"</p>
</center><p>"Terrible, that news about the unicorns, innit?" she said.</p><p>"Yes, Nymphadora, I hope the Aurors catch those responsible—"</p><p>"<em>SHHHH!"</em> The cacophony of the hail's onslaught was not enough to defeat Madam Pince's trained ear.</p><p>Having had enough, Charlie took Tonks brusquely by her arm, causing her to involuntarily yelp, and led her to an out-of-the-way aisle, next to a window, against which the unrelenting hail afforded better acoustical concealment than any Silencing Spell.</p><p>Exasperated, Tonks said, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"You tell me, <em>Nymphadora."</em></p><p>Tonks' glower gave him notice, underscored by her hair magically diffusing into a bright shade of crimson. "Don't. Call me. Nymphadora!"</p><p>He stepped back. "There it is: <em>the reddening</em>… even gets in your eyes, doesn't it...?"</p><p>"You <em>know</em> that I don't like that word, Chuck."</p><p>"Then why does my elder brother get to call you That-which-makes-your-hair-turn-red?"</p><p>"He never called me anything of the sort."</p><p>Charlie blinked. "Really…? So, what did you hear exactly when he addressed you just now?"</p><p>Her stare went blank; she hugged her books to her breast, sighing with head cocked askew, and answered, "<em>Dearest…"</em></p><p>He grimaced. "That word doesn't even <em>remotely</em> sound like Nympha—er, that particular parlance that permanently pesters you…"</p><p>"Focus, Chuck." She blinked thrice, and the red disappeared from her eyes. "I require your expertise in dragonology."</p><p>He sniffed haughtily. "Continue."</p><p>"What do you know about <em>Ridgebit's thesis?"</em></p><p>"A great deal," he said. "Why the sudden interest in dragons?"</p><p>"Ever since the story broke in the <em>Prophet</em> regarding the influx of unicorn blood on the black market."</p><p>"That <em>is</em> a mystery. The Aurors can't find where it's coming from—as no one has reported any dead unicorns—and there have been no sightings of 'half-lifers' walking around."(2)</p><p>"And that got me thinking… what if the unicorns aren't being slain?"</p><p>"That would affect their blood's healing power, but theoretically, neither would any suffer the dreadful side effects." He rubbed his chin. "Either way, you'd need more of it… like a drug."</p><p>She nodded. "If I were going to harvest unicorn blood, the herds that roam wild and unmonitored in the Forbidden Forest would be my first choice."</p><p>"But, Hagrid has spent the better part of a week trying to track the herds to no avail, and if <em>he</em> can't find them, nobody can."</p><p>"What if Hagrid's been looking in the wrong place?"</p><p>"Why do you say that?"</p><p>"I was hoping you could tell <em>me,</em> going back to <em>Ridgebit's thesis</em>."</p><p>"Of course…." In an inspired epiphany, he led her to the Dragon Section. With a flourish of his wand, a large book magically leapt from the shelf and landed on the table. Charlie opened it, showcasing a map of the Forbidden Forest. "Given that dragons are particularly fond of eating unicorns, Harvey Ridgebit asserted that unicorn migratory patterns are dependent upon dragon mating behaviour: they go into hiding during the seasons where dragons are most prolific, and they likewise breed to offset predation."</p><p>"If these multiple correlations can be used to predict dragon behaviour, will it work in the reverse?" she asked.</p><p>"Who knows?" He replied. "The dragon population in this region is nonexistent."</p><p>"But, the unicorns don't know that. They'll have continued to follow their instincts bred into them over generations, wouldn't they?"</p><p>"Let's examine that." His fingered stilled to the relevant area on the map. "Hagrid would be <em>here</em> if he is following the yearly migration patterns of our unicorns." He then invoked the Summoning Spell; an almanac flew off the shelf and alit, opened thus, on the table next to the map. He pursed his lips as his eyes scrolled down the chart on the page, saying, "According to the Dragon Almanac, the females of the dragon breeds that were once native to this region ovulate every five years..."</p><p>Tonks leaned in, looking over his shoulder. "Would this year be such a year?"</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. "Yes... Not only that, we're right in the middle of their historic mating season."</p><p>"Unicorns are very intelligent," she said. "They have genetic memory."</p><p>He grinned. "I didn't know you were such a unicorn afficianado."</p><p>Tonks shrugged. "I inherited it from my mum; her patronus was a unicorn, as was her mum." (3)</p><p>Charlie returned to the map. "If <em>I</em> were a unicorn, so aware, I would be as far away from my natural stomping grounds as possible..." His finger glided to the opposite side of the map. "Further taking the aforementioned into account, the herd should be situated <em>here."</em> He snorted as he drew the obvious conclusion. "I believe you may be right…" He regarded her beaming eyes. "Brilliant!"</p><p>"It's about time you noticed." She smiled. "So, bring your map, and meet me in the second floor corridor at half past midnight—"</p><p>"Er, why?"</p><p>"Sneaking <em>out</em> of the castle is easy, but I'm going to need a guide in the Forbidden Forest."</p><p>Charlie folded his arms. "Do you fancy yourself an Auror now?"</p><p>With her hands on her hips, she met his glare. "And what if I do?"</p><p>"We should inform the headmaster."</p><p>"Dumbledore will dismiss us without proof," she said. "We should confirm our theory first."</p><p>"And risk expulsion? I don't think so."</p><p>"But, you owe me, Chuck." She pouted, and her reddened hair reverted back to its usual gentle pink hue.</p><p>"I'm a prefect now, Tonks. I have to set an example."</p><p>Her eyes widened, and her head tilted as she hugged her chest. "<em>Pleeeease…"</em></p><p>"That's <em>not</em> going to work!"</p><p>She grabbed his arm, placing her head on his shoulder. "I'll be your best friend…"</p><p>He wagged his finger at her sternly. "There is no way you're going to talk me into going along with this rubbish scheme of yours!"</p><p>"<em>SHHHH!"</em></p><p>The students quieted upon Madam Pince's stealthy arrival, and they averted their eyes under her disapproving frown.</p><p>This, however, did not stop Charlie from whispering to Tonks one last, "Never gonna happen...<em>"</em></p>
