    <p>"Ah, yes, another Weasley," the Sorting Hat announced. "I know just what to do with you!" But the Hat said that before Professor McGonagall placed it on Ron.</p><p>NO, thought Ron Weasley, and the Hat watched as memories of older brothers leaving him alone with Percy flashed by. The Hat felt the redhead's disgust, and more than that, his fear. Percy was a prefect and prefects are in charge of first years. Prefects are allowed into the younger boys' dorms, Ron knows that from eavesdropping on Fred and George. Ron had just spent a summer with his family and thought NO, Hat, YOU WILL NOT SORT ME WITH HIM -</p><p>And the Hat despised children mocking its authority; "Potter, Harry" was placed in Slytherin for that very reason. But desperation reeked off the young Weasley in waves, desperation self-preservation ambition oh alright.</p><p>"Slytherin!" The Hat shouted, and a relieved smile fell onto Ron's face. Professor McGonagall removed the Hat - her surprise from Potter's sorting made her immune to further surprise at Weasley's. From the professors' table, Professor Snape glared at Ron, who'd begun walking to the end of the Slytherin table where Harry from the train was sitting alone.</p><p>"Well..." Harry was unsure what to say - both boys had been bad-mouthing Slytherin on their way to Hogwarts. "Reckon it can't be too bad if you're here!"</p><p>Ron immediately began filling his plate, raising his eyebrows at Harry's empty one. Tan hands then begun scooping vegetables, while freckled ones attacked the meat. "Least we've got each other, yeah? Still wanna be friends?"</p><p>Harry looked at the arrogant blonde who was loudly boasting about already knowing his way around the castle. He had never had a friend before, but even if he did want Malfoy as one, he'd already insulted the pureblood. Harry didn't want to befriend a boy like the wizarding Dudley, and Ron was, if a bit coarse and presumptuous, humble. "Yeah, friends. How do you think your family will take the sorting?" Harry started the conversation. Question asking was allowed here, he had tested the waters earlier on the train.</p><p>"Fred and George will tease me mercilessly. Charlie will write pressuring me to join the Quidditch team, guarantee it. Mum will pretend not to be disappointed and reassure me in her letters that she still loves me, but she will put in some rot about how I'm still brave or Gryffindor in spirit if not in reality. Dad will ignore me, as usual. Percy - Percy's the only one I can see being angry about the sorting, and I don't care what the git thinks of me." He had, once. Once, before he knew any better, before he knew wrong when he felt it, Ron had wanted nothing more than to impress Percy. To grow up to be just like him. Then, well, then he turned ten and Dad gave him the Talk where Ron found out his dad thought "what you boys do is fine at home, but outside you can only be seen snogging and/or having sexual relations with witches, not wizards." Meaning his parents had known and done nothing, Percy knew it was wrong (because Dad said during the Talk touching someone who didn't want it was wrong) and still - still did <em>it</em>. Ron didn't care about his family outside of Fred, George, and Ginny. He had some warm, friendly feelings for Charlie and Bill, but he didn't love like he was supposed to. He didn't love his family. Not anymore.</p><p>Ron realized the silence had turned awkward, and tried to restart the conversation. "What about your family? They okay with you coming to Hogwarts and all?" Harry hadn't brought up anything about his family the entire trip, other than that he was used to hand-me-downs.</p><p>"No," Harry laughed bitterly. "I believe my relatives feel the same way about me that you do about Percy." Ron swallowed. Was his resentment that obvious? At home Ron simply avoided all contact regarding Percy, but at Hogwarts avoiding a prefect, even on the express, was impossible.</p><p>"They really hate you? What'd you do to them?" Ron regretted that question the moment it left his mouth. Harry's joy from eating vanished as he responded.</p><p>"Existing while being magical was enough to earn me a decade living in a room the size of the train compartment." Then, Dumbledore began speaking to the crowd. Harry's relief at the distraction must've shown, because Ron muttered an apology for the question. Or possibly for Harry's answer.</p><p>Ron feared what Harry must think of his obvious hatred towards his sibling, but he couldn't think of a way to explain that it wasn't like Harry's family without going into what Percy did. But that would occur later, when trust developed and Malfoy wasn't two seats away eavesdropping enviously. For now, Ron dug in to dessert.</p>
