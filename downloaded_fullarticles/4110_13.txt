    <p>~Remus pov~</p>
<p>I feel myself pulling anxiously at the sleeves of my beige sweater. You always thought the color to be hideous and would joke about buying me one of the silly leather jackets you always insisted on </p>
<p>The mug slips from my left hand from my trembling, the glass hits the floor and the shattering awakens something in me. Time slows to a gentle breeze and as I bend to pick up the broken pieces, my hands graze the edge of the fine ceramic and rose blood pools down my palm and drips from the edges of my hand. </p>
<p>Right. I remember now. I can't fix anything that's broken. You always made me feel I wasn't alone. You always picked me up but what was I? I was useless. I could never pick your wings up and now you stand among the gods in trial of madness. They claim the spillage of blood was nothing they'd ever seen. I went through the stages of grief as anyone would. Denial. Rage. Bargaining….depression… </p>
<p>...and acceptance, the acceptance that the true monster was always you. The smug smiles and gentle laughs we shared were nothing to a mad man with cruel intent, I find myself in a pool of pity for my state of mind but why..why I ask myself. I was nothing but a fool and you were nothing but the man to deal the cards.</p>
<p> I sit back as the dried blood slows its foul descent towards the ground. That's something you never followed, the rules. Gravity meant nothing as you soared above my expectations and made me feel real. </p>
<p>The clock chimes and I beg for this to be a dream. I beg for my conclusions to be an illusion within the whirlpools of disappointment swirling around in my mind. </p>
<p>They claim you are a madman but I feel myself slipping into a state worse than ever. The warm embrace on a cold day with our bodies intertwining in a love lock, the sensation enough to have me watering at the mouth...everything ends. You awaken from dreams and you were nothing but a false prophecy, Sirius Black. A dream. </p>
<p>(Sirius' Pov is chap 2)</p>
